        "text": "until 12.10. | #4363ARTatBerlin | Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery Berlin shows from 13. September 2024 the exhibition “Passenger” by the artist Luella Bartley. Luella Bartley’s solo exhibition at Galerie Kristin Hjellegjerde in Berlin presents a new body of work created through the artist’s visits to Royal Ballet dance rehearsals with choreographer Wayne McGregor. The resulting works explore the balance between effort and elegance, vulnerability and strength that Bartley observed in the dance studio, while also marking an important shift in her own practice. While her earlier works explored the complex feelings of vulnerability and exposure of the female body, the more recent works capture a powerful kind of physicality that is not only androgynous, but also expansive, fluid and dynamic. As Bartley watched the rehearsals, she was mesmerised by the beauty and flow of the dancers’ movements as well as the energy, intensity and stamina demanded of their bodies. “This idea of fragility and strength, of the effort required to create something that seems so effortless, struck me as a metaphor for the friction between how we deal with things internally and how we appear externally, how we can accommodate, express and experience all these different, seemingly contradictory feelings in a […]\n\nuntil 02.11. | #4364ARTatBerlin | Galerie Brockstedt shows from 19. September 2024 the exhibition “Von anderer Wirklichkeit” by the artist Pit Morell. Why commit myself to peat cutters, ploughing farmers. That’s only part of what I intend to process. What moved me? I used this and that from my life and my way of looking at things. I went through the events. Went through the anterooms, main rooms, side rooms, penetrated the tarmac surface of the streets in and around Worpswede, which again let the brick lattices emerge in places, as they do every spring. Worked my way through half of Jark’s thatched roof, through the milk churns. Stopped at the edge of the path. Looked back at a buzzard flying up. The man sharpening his scythe at the edge of the meadow made me think for a moment. Happy again about everything that had happened, I watched him doing the work he had to do at this time of year. He had done the same thing 365 days earlier and I had thought the same thing. It was as if it had only been yesterday. Seeing him meant happiness. He was standing there, in the meadow that belonged to […]\n\nuntil 02.10. | #4362ARTatBerlin | Jarmuschek + Partner shows from 24. August 2024 (Vernissage: 23.08.) the exhibition SO SIEHT SIE DER KUNDE by the artist Petra Lottje. A quirky beep while swiping the card through an ageing machine and we enter it: a microcosm full of stories, personal destinies, interpersonal relationships and emotions – a department store. With her latest works, Petra Lottje presents us an artistically condensed personal view of a place steeped in tradition that symbolises the changes in our society. With dynamic strokes, she creates individual portraits, group constellations and atmospherically charged places of action, which as key moments can shed light on our everyday coexistence, our working and living realities. By pausing to look at what is visible on the outside, Petra Lottje visualises individual inner worlds and possible states of our community on the basis of the smallest social units. PETRA LOTTJE was born in 1973 in Rheda-Wiedenbrück (NRW) and lives in Berlin. After completing her intermediate diploma in social work, she began studying fine art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Braunschweig – with interim stays in Canada and the USA. After graduating in 2005, Petra Lottje was a master student of Professor […]\n\nuntil 31.08. | #4361ARTatBerlin | Galerie SCHMALFUSS BERLIN shows from 03. August 2024 the exhibition “Poetische Malerei versus expressive Bildhauerkunst” with paintings by Michel Meyer und Hans Scheib. MICHEL MEYER wrote about the content of his painting in 1999: “My painting is not just a game with colors, pencils and material to obtain heads, figures and their fragments and relationships. […] Through the ongoing process of painting, all thoughts disposed of in the picture disappear and transform themselves caterpillar-like into beautiful and humorous things. Into stories with an open ending.” Experiences full of emotional emotion are reflected in HANS SCHEIB’s legendary sculptures. His wooden sculptures in particular, with their rugged surface treatment, represent snapshots of extreme excitement – from moments of shock to self-awareness. For health reasons, HANS SCHEIB has been unable to work with wood since 2023. His work now focuses on bronzes. MICHEL MEYER, Die große Kurve | Acryl auf Leinwand, 100 x 100 cm, 2020 The exhibition MICHEL MEYER | HANS SCHEIB once again offers a range of bronze and wood sculptures by the sculptor HANS SCHEIB, who was influenced by Berlin Realism and German Expressionism and is much sought-after by collectors. Opening: Saturday, 03. August 2024, […]\n\nuntil 02.11. | #4360ARTatBerlin | Galerie Judin shows from 10. September 2024 the group exhibition Ghost Image by the artists Alexander Basil, Pablo Bronstein, Elijah Burgher, Michael Buthe, Daniel Correa Mejía, Anders Dickson, Hervé Guibert, Christoph Hänsli, Almut Heise, Hortensia Mi Kafchin, Pierre Klossowski, Sholem Krishtalka, Karen Lamassonne, Jannis Marwitz, Piotr Nathan, Paul P., Maaike Schoorel, Helen Verhoeven, Amelie von Wulffen. The exhibition Ghost Image takes the example of Guibert’s intimacy with his mother as a starting point to question the representation of the self beyond the grasp of an image, one that is fueled by the depiction of memory and loss and rendered through the lens of painting. With each of the many artists responding to this subject in his or her own way, the show presents a testament to the complexities of self-presentation and, in particular, questions the understanding of memory and depiction. The French author and photographer Hervé Guibert once wrote “My body, due to the effects of lust or pain, has entered a state of theatricality, of climax, that I would like to reproduce in any matter possible: by photo, by video, by audio recording. It’s a laboratory that I offer up as a performance…”. He […]\n\nuntil 28.08. | #4359ARTatBerlin | Luisa Catucci Gallery (Brunnenstraße) shows from 16. August 2024 the exhibition Untitled (back when we met) by the artists Nitsan Margaliot and Antoine Mermet. “ Untitled (back when we met)”, presents the collaborative work of Nitsan Margaliot and Antoine Mermet. Their work relates to various queer meetings in private and public spaces using video, textile, text, sound, and performance. The exhibition revolves around two performances, Unfolded and We Met, as well as two screenings — This Gentle Moment and a diary. The exhibition holds testimonies and traces related to encounters around the bed and the weight it carries, exploring intimacy and queer trajectories. Nitsan Margaliot is a choreographer, dancer, and curator deeply engaged with queer archives, re-enactments, and vulnerable encounters. Antoine Mermet is a versatile musician, composer, improviser, and multidisciplinary artist,active in dance, theater, visual arts, and performance. Opening: Friday, 16. August 2024 6 – 10 pm.

July 2024 an art presentation of 15 selected works from Thomas Hoepker’s oeuvre. With the death of Thomas Hoepker, the gallery has lost one of the most important German photographers in history, but above all Hoepker the man, whom it represented for more than 20 years and presented at exhibitions and art fairs. It comprises 15 selected works by the photographer. In addition to his portraits of boxing legend Muhammad Ali, photographs by Andy Warhol and works from Hoepker’s “Berlin Wall Children” series will also be on display. Thomas Hoepker (1936-2024) gained his first experience with the medium of photography at the age of 14. He received two Photokina awards during his studies and from 1959 worked regularly as an advertising photographer for magazines and book publications. He devoted himself to photojournalism and later also became interested in the moving image, shooting films and working as a cameraman. In 1974, he was the first accredited photographer to go to East Berlin for Stern magazine, where he worked temporarily as art director. In 1989, Thomas Hoepker became the first German photographer to become a full member of the Magnum Photos agency […]\n\nuntil 19.09. | #4356ARTatBerlin | Galerie Gilla Lörcher shows from 16. August 2024 the exhibition LETTRES MORTES by the artist John Cornu. Galerie Gilla Loercher presents the 5th solo show by French artist John Cornu. John Cornu spent several months in Okinawa as part of a residency fellowship at the Nanjo Art Museum (Japan) in 2022. The results of his residency and research trip will be presented in the exhibition LETTRES MORTES during the BERLIN ART WEEK at Galerie Gilla Loercher. John Cornu (born in 1976, lives and works in Paris and Renes) works with an inherited from Minimalism and Modernism (monochromy, seriality, modularity, the primacy of the materials), while maintaining a relation to (historical, architectural, societal) context and a form of contemporary Romanticism (Dionysianism, erosion, blindness, references to different sonic universes, and entropy). With an interest for modern ruins, logics of power, and anthropological gaps, the artist imbues his productions with an atmosphere at once poetic, cathartic and without compromise. Whether sculptural, performative, or installation-based, they address forces, setting up a multiplicity of meanings and readings. John Cornu‘s work has been shown in numerous solo and group shows at: Institut Giacometti (Paris, FR), Palais de Tokyo and Maison rouge (Paris, FR), […]\n\nbis 26.10. | #4352ARTatBerlin | Meyer Riegger presents from 14th September 2024 the exhibition Le Rhin by the artist Caroline Bachmann. If one begins the exhibition tour on the first floor and then goes down to the ground floor, one follows the course of the river from Reichenau to Rotterdam. Caroline Bachmann travelled along the river twice for her Rhine series. Together, the 24 paintings create a portrait of the river from different perspectives. As if you were looking through the porthole of a ship, through a telescope or a keyhole, Bachmann frames her depictions of the Rhine in round frames. 24 views of the Rhine are not a lot when you compare this number with the number of pictures of Lake Geneva that Bachmann has painted to date. The decision to start painting landscapes in the 2000s, as Bachmann did at the time, certainly took courage. During her trips along the Rhine, she produced around 100 sketches, from which she selected 24 and turned them into paintings in her studio in Cully. While landscape painters such as Ferdinand Hodler or Giovanni Segantini always painted plein air, i.e. in the open air, Bachmann preferred to go into her “cave”, as […]\n\nuntil 09.08. | #4350ARTatBerlin | Galerie Gilla Lörcher shows from 02.

Galerie Gilla Loercher is very pleased to present the Summer exhibition with artists of the gallery.

July 2024 the group exhibition Zeichnung heute. The exhibition brings together thirteen graphic positions from more than fifty years. Arnulf Rainer, 1980, Klimt-Aktüberzeichnung, Ölkreide und Graphit, 25 x 35 cm The medium of paper as an essential carrier of artistic images has a tradition going back well over a thousand years. Drawing in the narrower sense has also gained in importance since the Renaissance, often as an autonomous work of art. Jack Sal, White/Wash, Memorial, Kielce 2003 This applies in full to the further development of art. However, the idea of reducing drawing to its serving function and defining it as a sketch, draft, notation and the like, always referring to its spontaneity, persists to this day. Sharka Hyland, Else Lasker-Schüler, Styx, 2023, Bleistift auf Papier, 30,4 x 40,5 cm und Detail Not only are works on paper generally extremely important in modernism, as the works of almost all important artists show, but drawing itself also receives the greatest attention today, which it has always deserved. Its history cannot be written here, but George Seurat must be mentioned (and it is precisely in this context that the above quote stands).

July 2024 the duo-exhibition When Dusk Falls by the artists Jamie Luoto and Tonia Nneji. “When Dusk Falls”, the duo exhibition of paintings by Jamie Luoto and Tonia Nneji at Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery Berlin, explores the complex psychological effects of trauma in relation to the female body and the potential of art as a powerful form of revelation and resistance. Jamie Luoto’s paintings form part of an ongoing investigation into her own experience of complex post-traumatic stress disorder. Drawing on the occult and horror genre, she uses a symbolic visual language to make visible unseen symptoms of sexual abuse such as flashbacks, nightmares, dissociation, and intrusive thoughts. While Luoto typically works with self-portraiture, for this exhibition she has also created a series of smaller, still lifes that explore the ways in which our internal experience can bleed into and alter our perception of the world around us. For instance, in Are You Good Men and True? a white porcelain cat becomes both a surrogate for the female figure, pushed into a corner, and a figure of authority, passing judgment on the ‘men’, who are alluded to through condoms, a recurring […]\n\nuntil 10.08. | #4347ARTatBerlin | Jarmuschek + Partner shows from 09. July 2024 (Opening: 06.07.) the exhibition HALF LIGHT by the artist Majla Zeneli. Diffuse blurs, geometric-abstract forms and complex collages – Majla Zeneli repeatedly uses the almost forgotten technique of mezzotint to create touching visual worlds that immerse the viewer, encouraging them to linger and think further. In the interplay of patterns, layers and variables, the artist focuses on light in her latest works. Contrasts of light and dark, black and white in all their facets and fusions through to text passages and letters lead into a multi-layered meditation on emptiness, the hidden, origins and eternities. Opening: Saturday, 06. July 2024, 4 – 8 pm Exhibition dates: Tuesday, 09. July 2024 until Saturday, 10. August 2024 Title image caption: MAJLA ZENELI, o.T.

September 2024 the exhibition “Reciting from memory” by the artist Pablo Benzo. Pablo Benzo’s new series, which will be on display in the Reciting from Memory exhibition in September, focuses on surreal, cubist three-dimensional picture-in-picture constructions. This technique enables him to depict objects and landscapes in a multi-layered and profound way. The main motifs of his paintings are clearly defined, clearly delineated in terms of colour and form, and combine unusual objects and themes that leave a contrasting impression in their constellation. These contrasts invite the viewer to reflect on their memories and feelings and to make a personal connection through the subtle references in the paintings. Opening: Thursday, 12.

September 2024 the exhibition London by the artist Christopher Lehmpfuhl. The exhibition Christopher Lehmpfuhl: London presents for the first time the works of Berlin plein air painter Christopher Lehmpfuhl, which the artist painted on the streets of the British capital in the footsteps of the Impressionists. Accompanied by Mamuka Bliadze and Patrick Bence-Trower from the KORNFELD Gallery Berlin, Lehmpfuhl’s journey has resulted in a collection of new paintings and watercolours that capture the essence of London and combine painterly traditions with the artist’s own style.

Letizia Werth is interested in drawing and its materiality as well as in the relationship between drawing and other media such as photography and video. Under the title “Shadow Flowers”, she summarises a series of monochrome works in which she transforms images of found anonymous — “lost” — photographs from private living spaces onto canvas in graphite and ink. In the process of leaving the photographic model, categories such as space, time, fiction and reality come to light in all their fragility. Letizia Werth, Ohne Titel, Graphit,Tusche auf Molino, 60 x 80cm, 2019 ©LWerth “Drawing is an immediate process of assimilation and digestion […]. It is comparable to the flow of air when breathing in and out, pausing and letting go, and that is exactly how I stop time for a few moments and move into new pictorial worlds.” Letizia Werth has studied the influence of various media on perception in depth, from photography and video to X-rays and séances.

Galerie Z22 presents the exhibition “ARTISTIC STEPS” by Immanuel Rohringer and Frank Massholder. Frank Massholder and Immanuel Rohringer dedicate themselves to the accidental beauty of floors in large series that have been running for years and are still unfinished today. While the art photographer and gallery owner Massholder finds his motifs during visits to his artists’ studios, the visual artist Rohringer creates them in experimental and open processes. FRANK MASSHOLDER | LANDAUER #4 | 2023 | UV.DRUCK AUF ALUDIBOND BUTLERFINISH Massholder calls his discoveries “concrete coincidences” and has been consistently “collecting” such “deliberate photographs of accidentally created objects” for years. In his words, the floors of artists’ studios are “snapshots of an artist’s inner landscape over the course of time. They are a collection of movements, colours, splashes, pieces of inspiration from each individual work that unintentionally document the artist’s work as a whole.” IMMANUEL ROHRINGER | ARTISTIC STEPS | 1/30 | 2023 | MISCHTECHNIK AUF LEINWAND | 200 x 185 For him, such studio floors are “canvases that guide us through time and perhaps give […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4340ARTatBerlin | ZWINGER Galerie shows from 06. July 2024 (Vernissage: 05.07.) the exhibition Identities by the artist Susi Pop. SUSI POP is me claims the model. “Flaubert is me,” says Madame Bovary, and without further ado, she sets herself up as the author of her own character. Flaubert has understood this and is wary of any moral or other kind of judgment. Omai (Mai), Polynesian prince (around 1751-1780), brought to England by Captain Cook in 1775, was introduced to “the highest circles” there and presented to members of the Royal Society and George III as a “noble savage”. The life-size portrait of Omai in antique garb painted by Joshua Reynolds in 1776 is unironically regarded as an “important British cultural asset”. Long privately owned, the painting appeared on the art market at regular intervals, each time experiencing an extreme price increase. In 2023, it was “secured” for the National Portrait Gallery with the involvement of the Getty Foundation. Blue Boy Arkhom. Inspired by Gainsborough’s “Blue Boy”, Arkhom grabs a hat and poses in front of the famous painting in the SUSI POP version, imitating its courtly gesture. A double travesty.

In it, the Potsdam-based artist explore his identity, fashion and gender as well as spaces, castles and palaces. Image caption: Ich und meine Burg, 220×170, Öl, raedy-made auf Baumwoll e, 2024 With the exhibition title, Grote wants to make a statement as an unknown in the art world.

Images from 7 October, from Palestine, Haiti and the Ukraine, which we reflexively close our eyes to, gain a new visibility in his paintings. The works that Theuerkauff juxtaposes with his political paintings would also have been unthinkable two years ago: The Berlin city views under his private address and the picturesque, flooded landscapes have their origins in the AI.

The German artist studied at the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe and is considered an important figure in the European tradition of sculpture. He has received prestigious awards such as the Prize for Drawing at the III Biennial of Contemporary Art, Vila Nova de Cerveira, Portugal (1982), the Joan Miró International Prize for Drawing, Barcelona (1986) and the Grand Prize at the II International Biennial of Sculpture in Obidos, Portugal (1989). From 1989-1990 Schad held a guest professorship at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart. Today he lives and works in Larians-et-Munans in France and in Chamosinhos in Portugal. He is known for his large installations in public spaces. Schad’s works combine two forms of design: Drawing and sculpture.

Galerie Thomas Schulte presents Richard Deacon’s upcoming exhibition About Us in the Corner Space. The show brings together the artist’s fundamental mediums of drawing and sculpture, featuring two works: an almost life-size steel sculpture along with an intricate black and white wall drawing. While both works showcase his mastery of materials and mediums, they also offer a unique glimpse into two decades of Deacon’s analytical form language and innovative artistry.

Robert Mapplethorpe’s photographs of flowers are well known, and recognizable for their delicate yet erotic beauty. What is less discussed is the role of the specific set of objects often appearing within their carefully constructed compositions. Frequently drawn from the artist’s collection, the vases and bowls found in these still lifes reveal a deep appreciation for design – reflecting the confident eye and regard for classical form exemplified by his photographic work. It is the connection between the two, that forms the starting point of Behold the Lowly Vessel. Presented at Galerie Thomas Schulte, the exhibition takes a distinctive point of view, bringing thoughtful arrangements of Mapplethorpe’s photographs together with a private collection of vases inspired by them.

Peres Projects presents Bloom, the fourth solo exhibition by Rafa Silvares (b. 1984 in Santos, BR) at the gallery and his second in Berlin. ‘[…] His latest works are defined by a clear, sharp and reduced vocabulary of colour and everyday objects. Assertive compositions of red, green and blue architectures mingle with realistic images of ordinary reflective objects, painted in such a way that they could be photographs, with flowers or cloudy forms of liquids. In his work, these soft forms appear as water, air, vapour, fire, smell, cream. The tension between the shiny parts and the abstract forms embodies a tension between physical phenomena and emotional power. These are the parts you can identify with the most; you can almost feel, smell and touch the texture of Silvares’ paintings, get close to them in their bubbling, round, full, spherical, sensual waves of sensation. Or there are the tubular curtains, vertical waves of soft, velvety fabric. His works gain movement and warmth through such parts. There is no one in these scenes.

Galerie Tanja Wagner presents the second solo exhibition by Anna Steinert: Was am Tiefsten in der Welt liegt. While Steinert undertook an exploratory journey into the transcendence of the imaginative power in her first solo exhibition Wanderings, she now turns her attention to what surrounds us on, above and below the earth. The title of her exhibition, which features video, sculpture and paintings, is based on Emanuele Coccia’s The Roots of the World – an essay that helps us to understand plants as creators of the world, the vital basis of existence, mediators between sun and earth and living beings of equal value with hidden bodies in the ground. In her new 3-channel video installation Erdemojies – Forscher*innen der Mischung, Steinert brings in reinforcements: The performers and fellow artists Monika Michalko, Nschotschi Haslinger, Cora Saller, Katharina Duve, Hanna Matthes, Helena Ratka, Sophie Labrey and Helena Wittmann (camera) appear as naturalists, healers and superheroes who, in an experimental and playful approach, accompanied by darkly wavering electro sounds and drums, summon nature and elemental forces with the common […]\n\nuntil 03.08. | #4331ARTatBerlin | Contemporary Fine Arts presents from 22nd June 2024 (Vernissage: 21st June) the exhibition Flugelhorns by the artist Ellen Berkenblit. Contemporary Fine Arts presents Flugelhorns, the first solo-exhibition from Ellen Berkenblit in the gallery and the first of the artist in Germany. On display are paintings and drawings featuring female figures that dominate much of the canvas, gazing not at the viewer but at something or someone within their own realm, the specifics of which remain obscure to us. The figures are never centered; instead, they are slightly off-balance, drawing attention only to deflect it. Cut out from their surroundings and cropped out of context, their emotional states become the main story. Complex, innate emotions manifest through paint, while the relationships between characters shape the composition. Somewhat of a rarity for Berkenblit, the women are not entirely isolated from their stories but appear alongside others, and in addition to tigers, horses, and birds, one gets a glimpse of motherhood, sisterhood, friendship, or perhaps even its opposite; the dynamics of their relationships are contained within the expressive brushstrokes and muted colors. For Berkenblit, the canvas is a world in which she strives for balance, but the laws […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4330ARTatBerlin | WENTRUP presents from 28th June 2024 the exhibition Tempo Primo by the artist Thomas Wachholz. An English riddle, which gained popularity around 1900, presents a predicament: “A man walks into a dark room. He has a match in his hand. In the dim light, he can make out three objects: a candle, a fireplace, and a kerosene lamp. The question is, which should he light first?” Against all expectations, the three objects, which can provide either light or warmth, are not the primary concern. The overlooked fact is that the answer is already in his hand. Without striking the match, he cannot light anything else. Throughout his artistic career, Thomas Wachholz has handled many matches, even entire series of them. For “Tempo Primo”, these matches join brushes and other utensils that Wachholz has used in recent years for his deep exploration into the possibilities of pictorial creation. At times, the matches have served as a model, a motif, a subject matter, or even a tool in this practical relationship. Wachholz’s paintings consistently showcase his fascination with matchboxes and matchbooks. This fascination stems from their iconicity, practicality, the chemical processes of ignition, and ultimately, fire. The […]\n\nuntil 17.08 | #4329ARTatBerlin | Haverkampf Leistenschneider shows from 21st June 2024 the exhibition NEUE WELT by the artist Stefan Hirsig. In a restless exchange of movement, gesture and texture, Stefan Hirsig‘s work has always questioned what painting is capable of and what abstraction can be. Integrating a rich pool of references from classical and modern painting, pop culture and today’s oversaturated media, his dynamic compositions bear witness to the hyper-connected, always-on cacophony of our present moment. Yet Hirsig’s imagery resists quick consumption. If you look long enough, you’ll discover a processual logic: marks made like chess moves, a series of calculated responses, both destructive and creative; sometimes in opposition, sometimes in dance. In Neue Welt, Hirsig reflects on the endless cycle of global conflicts and wars that break out, subside, and escalate again without permanent resolve, keeping our world in a state of constant anxiety. The artist observes that everywhere we look, the leaders of these conflicts are almost always men. Why do so many despotic, egotistical men dominate world affairs? he asks. Is masculinity the driving force behind the world’s cycle of violence? These conflicts are not perpetuated in the name of caution or protection, but rather masculinity at its worst: […]\n\nuntil 17.08. | #4328ARTatBerlin | CAMERA WORK shows from 8th June 2024 a solo exhibition by the artist Dean Wests. Galerie CAMERA WORK shows Dean West’s first solo exhibition in Germany from 8th June, 2024. The exhibition comprises over 20 predominantly large-format works from a decade of the conceptual artist’s work as well as a short film. Alongside other photographs created in 2024, this will be shown in an exhibition for the first time worldwide. CAMERA WORK represents the artist in Europe as the main gallery. The exhibition shows elaborately conceived, serial works from the oeuvre of the artist Dean West – including photographs from the latest series “American West” and “The Palms”, which deal with cowboy culture in the USA and scenically condense facets of everyday life in Florida. This also includes the figure of the lone wolf, which two of West’s works depict using different storytelling techniques. The monochrome photographs in the series are presented across two exhibition rooms. In these atmospheric works, West stages motionless moments removed from time. They are theatrically charged fragments of narratives that are structured by means of color and clear symmetry. The exhibition also provides insights into “Pink Dreams” and “New York”, […]\n\nuntil 18.07. | #4327ARTatBerlin | Raab Galerie presents from 22nd June 2024 (Vernissage: 21.06) the exhibition Me, myself and Ei by the artist Björn Heyn. it is not necessary to explain Björn Heyn’s works, they are beautiful and mysterious, full of temptation. While I look at a variety of forms, colours and hints, paintings come to my mind that are known to me: A quarter of a century ago the works of Picasso and Matisse were celebrated in exhibitions all over the world as represetative of the spirit of the twentieth century. At that time Björn Heyn was still a child. Today, he adds to these images Fernand Léger and uses words as images, to find out what could best be done with it to create a contemporary painting. The reaction of the observers is prompt: These works are loveable, subtle, colourful and stimulating. They are an interesting company at home to think about life. Painting always existed, even in times of political correctness, when dualism between politics and culture did not exist anymore. While paintings don’t explain things to you, they enlighten your thinking. As the great Swiss philosopher Jean Starobinski explains, enlightenment saves us from danger. Very often, […]\n\nuntil 02.08. | #4325ARTatBerlin | AOA;87 contemporary shows from 28. June 2024 (Vernissage: 27.06.) the exhibition 層 | Layering the Void by the artist Noriko Ambe. AOA;87 presents the exhibition “層 | Layers of Emptiness” by Japanese artist Noriko Ambe, renowned for her intricate white-on-white paper cuttings, displayed as wall reliefs, free-standing sculptures, and installations. The exhibition is accompanied by video works from video artist Mami Kosemura. Noriko Ambe, No. 1 Curtain piece, Tracking through the curtain, 2022, Cut on Yupo paper, 160 cm x 10 m Noriko Ambe (*1967, Saitama) creates delicate, sculptural works through her “Linear-Actions” series, which began in 1999, by meticulously cutting and layering hundreds to thousands of sheets of paper. These works evoke topographic and organic forms, with fine lines reminiscent of tree rings. These lines represent not only the physical structure of the paper but also a metaphorical journey through time. Each cut and layer symbolizes a past moment, with the cross-sections representing instances within the countless layers of time that permeate the existence of a work.

Heiner Franzen has been collecting non-verbal video material from ANCHORS, presenters of international news programmes, for over ten years. In these video loops, Franzen focuses on the moment when someone is silent in the broadcast – be it because of a malfunction or because he or she is allowing guests to discuss. He further developed the extensive source material into For his first solo exhibition with EBENSPERGER Berlin – Hachmeister takes up the fragile physicality of being human, which is expressed in a strange domesticity full of subtle humour and sensuality, thus creating a counterpoint to the raw architecture of the Fichtebunker.

June 2024 the exhibition Twilight is a Place of Promise with works by 19 artists. Participating artists: Eileen Agar, Bettina von Arnim, Merikokeb Berhanu, Huguette Caland, Caroline Coon, Hélène Delprat, Bracha L. Ettinger, Roey Victoria Heifetz, Andrea Joyce Heimer, Monilola Olayemi Ilupeju, Kamala Ibrahim Ishag, Pia Krajewski, Jinju Lee, Iva Lulashi, Isabel Nolan, Pan Yuliang, Isabel Quintanilla, Anys Reimann, and Cecilia Vicuña. Esther Schipper is delighted to present Twilight is a Place of Promise featuring the work of 19 international artists born between 1895 and 1996. The exhibition offers a perspective on the politics of image-making— personal, social, political, historical—taking painting and the artists’ diverse approaches to the practice as its focus. It is partisan in its polysemy, insistent only on the confluence of nuance and power. Emerging three years after the gallery’s 2021 exhibition L‘Invitation au voyage, which invoked the freedom of imaginary travel in the form of fantasy or dreams, Twilight is a Place of Promise presents works of painters that look beyond conventional categorizations of subject and object, external and internal worlds. The works in the exhibition imagine spaces of inwardness, spirituality, and shared humanity, with […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4323ARTatBerlin | Galerie Georg Nothelfer shows from 22. June 2024 the exhibition In diesem Jahr kacken die Störche anders by the artist Thomas Hartmann. Galerie Georg Nothelfer presents a solo exhibition of works by the Berlin painter Thomas Hartmann (*1950). The show includes works from the 1980s to the present day. Thomas Hartmann’s paintings paradoxically embody both a sense of order and a chaotic liveliness. Known since the 1980s for his expressive, impasto landscapes and cityscapes, his work is characterized by a meticulous attention to detail and an almost obsessive inclusion of numerous small figures and elements. The resulting effect is reminiscent of late Gothic hidden object paintings, inviting viewers to explore the narrative richness of each individual work. Hartmann’s scenes have a timeless quality, as if they dissolve the boundaries between past, present and future. This temporal ambiguity invites us to reconsider our own place in the continuum of time and space. (Text excerpt by Nicola E. Petek) Vernissage: Friday, 21.

Hugo Wilson has chosen “The Raft” as title for his upcoming Berlin exhibition. Of course, this immediately evokes associations with the most famous raft in art history, Gericault’s Raft of the Medusa – and inevitably with the theme of “salvation.” So how does this tie in with this exhibition, the first in which his abstract and his figurative works are shown side by side? Firstly, we need to understand the two poles between which Wilson’s work oscillates. On the one hand, there are the figurative, highly tangible compositions in which animals play a decisive role. They are metaphors of complex processes and moments – not in the animal kingdom, but in our highly technological human societies. The double monkey, for example, that we see in ReTro is the result of recent cloning experiments. The symbol in the background even refers to the corresponding laboratory. Wilson’s horses (State I and II) can also be read symbolically. They are versions of the famous painting Whistlejacket (1762) by Georges Stubbs, which is now one of the icons in the collection of the National Gallery in London. It shows […]\n\nuntil 30.08. | #4321ARTatBerlin | Luisa Catucci Gallery (Brunnenstraße) shows from 20. June 2024 the exhibition A PSALM FOR THE WILD BUILT by the artists Marion Mandeng, Barbara Boekelman, Eleonora Roaro , Cathy Jardon and Irina Gabiani. Taking its title from the eponymous book by Becky Chambers, this exhibition aspires to be a visual poem in reverence of the wild built. It stands as a declaration of love and solidarity from four wild built women artists, alongside the four wild built women running the Luisa Catucci Gallery, to their untamed peers—women, men and those in between, alike. The inner wildness is a profound, untamed force residing deep within many individuals. Embracing this inner wildness enables women to access their primal power, reconnect with their natural instincts, and navigate life’s complexities with a fierce, unyielding spirit. This wildness defies societal expectations and limitations; it may be contained or restrained temporarily, but it inevitably finds its path to eruption. It is a source of immense strength, resilience, and intuition, manifesting in expressions of profound creativity, fierce protection, and unwavering determination. This torrent of raw creativity places women artists at the forefront of the wild built, despite the historical and societal disadvantages that […]\n\nuntil 12.07. | #4320ARTatBerlin | OFFICE IMPART is currently showing the exhibition Magenta Elephants by the artist Damjanski. Nobody is Here aka Outis Arrives and Nemo Appears “Friends, Nobody is murdering me by craft.

Can you see it? The image? The image that is an idea, a phrase, a picture, and do any one of those images mean more, do more, show more than the other? Damjanski’s “Ceiling Cat” (2024) riffs on Eva and Franco Mattes’ “Ceiling Cat” (2016) responding to the internet meme, which was itself a 2006 photograph taken by nobody, not even anonymous, just no one yet known, or to be known, or willing to stand up for the peculiar photographic set-up captured in the first decade of this strange, nigh uncanny century.

June 2024 the exhibition KONTROLLE by the artist Moritz Stumm and Stefan Neuberger. What does the exploitation of animals by the police in order to wield their monopoly of violence at the beginning of the 21st century tell us about man’s claim to power over nature and the state over its citizens? What parallels can be drawn to human nature, our desires and instincts? The series KONTROLLE addresses the power structure between animals, state power and, implicitly, citizens – in the form of stylised images of training sessions of police service horses and dogs. The focus of the works is on the animals, which calmy, agressively and even at times playfully obey commands. The composition is reminiscent of the iconography of authority of equestrian statues and raises the question of the staging of state power in the present day. Vernissage: Friday, 14.

June 2024 the exhibition Sunless Circuit by the artist Su Yu Hsin. “Memory is not something we have, it is something that happens: a network of unintended connections. While remembering is a form of caring, storing is a way of safely forgetting. Our devices know us better than we know them. The algorithm is an oracle that tracks our secrets and predicts both questions and answers. The promises of technology are many. Among them, that all information will be always available. But the internet, like the past, is also made of broken links and errors. No cloud lasts forever, not even those born in a silicon valley. How many times have we felt the vertigo of the no longer accessible data? When machines fail, we stop taking them for granted. Glitches are part of their agency. When they work again, they regain their deceptive immateriality.” (excerpt of text by Sonia Fernández Pan) Vernissage: Friday, 14. June 2024, 6 – 9 pm Exhibition period: Friday, 14.

June 2024 the exhibition HOMESICK WANDERER by the artist Rosanna Burford. Homesick for a place that never was. In the exhibition Homesick Wanderer, Rosanna Burford’s art invites viewers to travel through invented landscapes of longing and memory. Informed by the gardens of her childhood in England, Burford’s work searches for a personal paradise. The garden – a place where organic landscape meets man-made structure is an archetypal space where humanity has sought paradise since our beginnings. Strange Beginnings, 80 x 80 cm, oil on canvas, 2023 Burford’s latest works evoke a homesickness for a place that never was. The past plays an important role in creating this place and is considered as an intertwined cultural heritage of family legacy, memories of travel, and mythological characters or spaces such as the hanging gardens of Babylon. These influences of the past merge with a strong desire for a new world. Reflecting on the current context of our relationship with nature, this new world is a place where nature acts as a refuge – a contemporary reflection on paradise as a walled garden – an ancient concept of home. Autumn in […]\n\nuntil 26.06. | #4317ARTatBerlin | Michaela Helfrich Galerie shows from 12 June 2024 the exhibition Changelings in Nighttown by the artist Noël O’Callaghan. The exhibition ‘Changelings in Nighttown’ from 12 to 26 June 2024 is a solo exhibition by Irish artist Noël O’Callaghan, showing paintings and drawings from her ‘Changelings’ series. These works were created during the lockdown when, in the absence of her regular drawing group, the artist began to alter existing drawings by allowing them to freely mutate into new beings. Girls can play too!, 2020, watercolor and graphite, 30 x 20cm Die „Nighttown“ des Titels bezieht sich auf das Circe-Kapitel in James Joyce’s Ulysses.

In a cross-epochal exhibition, ARTES sheds light on the essential role of the flower in the history of art in the 20th and 21st centuries and thus presents a penetrating look at the development of this timeless motif. ‘I can buy myself flowers’ reflects not only the aesthetic qualities of the flower, but also its profound symbolism and cultural significance throughout history. From the structured elegance of Classical Modernism to the bold vitality of Pop Art and the innovative perspectives of contemporary artists, the exhibition offers a unique insight into the many ways in which the flower has been depicted as a symbol of beauty, transience and transcendence. Among the names gathered are: Georg Baselitz, Christoph Bouet, Anne Böddeker, Marc Chagall, Klaus Fußmann, Marion Eichmann, E. B. Gordon, Erich Heckel, Damien Hirst, Roy Lichtenstein, Takashi Murakami, Gabriele Münter, Otto Piene, Christian Rohlfs, Thomas Röthel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, David Shrigley, Lars Teichmann, Andy Warhol and many more.

June 2024 (Opening: 27.06.) the exhibition UNCANNY by Mathias Vef & friends. nüüd.berlin gallery introduces Mathias Vef as the gallery’s new artist with the exhibition ‘Uncanny’ from 28 June 2024. In his works, the artist explores the interplay of body and identity, inspired by people who look at their bodies experimentally. Through photography, video and 3D scans, he deconstructs these bodies and uses artificial intelligence to create new surreal works that reflect the ambiguity of being human in the age of AI and synthetic reality. These works are contrasted with works by other artists to create a multi-layered field of discussion. Mathias Vef, Angus Love 1.0, 2024, 40 x 50 cm Mathias Vef explores the fascinating interplay of body and identity with the help of people who see their bodies as something changeable. For him, this fluidity is the means of human existence. Through photography, videos and 3D scans, he collects danced forms of ballet dancers, digitally manipulated bodybuilders, transpersons or portraits of sex workers, which he transforms and digitally collages with the help of chemical substances. With these embodiments, he creates fascinatingly surreal images, collages and choreographies that offer […]\n\nuntil 31.08. | #4313ARTatBerlin | Crone Berlin presents from 22. June 2024 the exhibition Needs by the artist Tobias Hoffknecht. Düsseldorf-based Tobias Hoffknecht is committed to both classical sculpture and minimalism. In his new solo exhibition “Needs” at Crone Berlin, new sculptures can now be seen that pick up on both influences and put our perception to the test. Tobias Hoffknecht can’t help himself: time and again, he repeatedly confronts an overpowering opponent or friend — the omnipresent aesthetics of the Bauhaus that still abound today. Hoffknecht’s minimalist, highly precise yet humorous sculptures raise the question of why Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) continues to dominate our everyday lives and our viewing habits; what its core, its meaning or perhaps even its sensuality actually is; why we cannot escape it and whether it is possible to reduce the reduced even further. Tobias Hoffknecht, Courtesy Crone Berlin For his new series Needs, Hoffknecht uses the visual Bauhaus metaphor to tell of the futility of the ephemeral even more forcefully than previously: heavy tubular steel structures are seemingly effortlessly swallowed up by walls, curved metal bodies sink into the floor with determined resistance — as if they were one with everything and present even in their […]\n\nuntil 10.08. | #4312ARTatBerlin | Galerie Max Hetzler (Potsdamer Straße) shows from 14. June 2024 the exhibition letters home by the artist Edmund de Waal. In his visual art, Edmund de Waal uses objects as vehicles for human narrative, emotion and history. His installations of handmade porcelain vessels, often contained in minimalist structures, investigate themes of diaspora, memory and materiality. His works offer a kind of visual lyrical narration, created through elements such as rhythm and repetition or light and shadow. In addition to black, white and oak vitrines made this year, the current exhibition includes both the largest free-standing clay vessels the artist has ever created, and a large-scale pavilion titled there are still songs to sing beyond mankind, 2024. Despite their differences in size and material, all the works are ultimately vessels whose interiors only seem to become more intimate as their dimensions increase. Individual words or phrases from poems by Denise Riley (b. 1948), Paul Celan (1920–1970) and Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926) are interwoven in the titles or surfaces of these works by de Waal. Here, the focus is not on analysing the texts, but rather on their emotional heft. A further reference to language can be found […]\n\nuntil 03.08. | #4311ARTatBerlin | Galerie Max Hetzler (Bleibtreustraße) shows from 8. June 2024 the duo exhibition by the artists André Butzer and Hans Josephsohn. Galerie Max Hetzler presents a duo exhibition of André Butzer and Hans Josephsohn at Bleibtreustraße 15/16, in Berlin. Flight, desolation and displacement are deeply inscribed in the work of Hans Josephsohn (1920–2012). Not in terms of motifs or themes, but as a fundamental life experience. Unlike the smooth, gracefully fluid agility of Lehmbruck or Maillol, who inspired him in his youth, and unlike Giacometti’s fraying dissolution of the figure in the glistening backlight of an atomic flash, for instance, Josephsohn clings firmly to the figure. Every grasp of the shapeless plaster solidifies the human form. Whether in the case of a tiny figurine or a monumental body, he always strives to achieve the appropriate composure, as if trying to reassure himself again and again of the enduring presence of his sitters. A presence that is brought abruptly and inevitably into the space. Josephsohn works towards a space, into a space. He takes nothing away, but rather brings something new into the world. Positive placements, solid and massive, fragile and delicate. With their jagged and agitated surfaces, with their restrained but […]\n\nuntil 03.08. | #4310ARTatBerlin | Galerie Max Hetzler (Goethestraße ) shows from 7. June 2024 the exhibition You think that you know but you know that you don’t by the artist Eddie Martinez. Galerie Max Hetzler is pleased to present You think that you know but you know that you don’t, a solo exhibition of new works by Eddie Martinez at Goethestraße 2/3, in Berlin. This is the artist’s inaugural exhibition with the gallery. Eddie Martinez’s artistic practice is characterised by his personal iconography, featuring signature elements such as bug-eyed humans in eclectic headgear, blockheads and the recurring butterfly motif of the ‘Buflies’. Brimming with cross-references to his everyday visual experiences, art history, and his own earlier work, his paintings show an energetic use of colour and bold contours, executed in various combinations of oil, enamel, spray paint, collage and studio detritus. Martinez is best known for his large-scale wall works incorporating figuration and abstraction, painting and drawing, which foreground his signature muscular brushwork. In his paintings, Martinez seeks to translate the speed and immediacy of drawing – his original primary medium – into complex compositions on large-scale canvases. His use of different media owes much to his desire to emulate the creative velocity of […]\n\nuntil 03.08. | #4309ARTatBerlin | Galerie Max Hetzler (Bleibtreustraße) shows from 7. June 2024 the exhibition Teratology of Love by the artist Jeremy Demester. Galerie Max Hetzler is pleased to present Teratology of Love, a solo exhibition of work by Jeremy Demester at Bleibtreustraße 45 in Berlin. This is the artist’s eighth solo exhibition with the gallery. ‘The word teratology or teratoid, when not being used by biology and medicine in an organic way, has a meaning that has to do with marvels, portends, monsters, mutations and prodigious things. The word teratoid, like the word dinosaur, suggests extraordinary scales, immense regions, an infinite quantity. […] Organic word meanings, when applied to abstract or mental structures, have a way of returning art to the biological condition of naturalism and realism. The marvelous meaning of that word has to be brought to consciousness again.’ – Robert Smithson, 1967 Ouidah, 16. May 2024 ‘These paintings, assembled as a Teratology of Love, call us and lead us into the passages of time, those specific points of our consciousness where there can be no metrics. These paintings are markers. They let us know how much time has gone by since we set off, and how long is left till the […]\n\nuntil 06.07. | #4308ARTatBerlin | Galerie Tammen currently shows the exhibition FIGURE IT OUT by the artists Stephanie Pech and Sonja Edle von Hoeßle. Stephanie Pech has been dealing with the “anthropometry” for years, literally translated the teaching of human level. In the visual art, this term describes working with the human body as a “lively brush”, as it came up with for the first time at Yves Klein. For bad luck, this form of painting elementary is part of its concept, harbors an inconceivable component and is therefore the basis for the exciting structure of your pictures between abstraction and figuration, artificiality and naturalness. In her large -format color -intensive paintings, Stephanie Pech Body Art, Figuration and Abstraction balances in an exciting way. (Stephan Berg, artistic art museum Bonn, Catalog Floating Strangers, 2023). IMPRESSIONEN der Ausstellung FIGURE IT OUT, Stephanie Pech + Sonja Edle von Hoeßle In the sculptures by Sonja Edle von Hoessle, the idea and body, construction and emotion, material and transparency combine.

June 2024 the group exhibition “Embodied Vessels – Between body and vessel” with works by Andreas Amrhein, Wilhelm Frederking, Diane Haefner, Daniel Kruger and Roland Stratmann. Images of people and animals have been found on vases and amphorae since well before antiquity. Even prehistoric finds show figurative elements on vessel shapes and everyday objects. Figurative representations in connection with functional objects of everyday and sacred use are visible signs of culture in many societies.

The artists explore the world of objects and place them in relation to their own bodies, linking them with fragmented bodies, historical figures, ethnological artifacts or current pictorial inventions. In the puzzle game of artistic transformation, bodies become vessels and vessels simmer towards their embodiment. This leads to unusual juxtapositions and references. In the exhibition, superimpositions of contemporary […]\n\nuntil 13.07| #4305ARTatBerlin | Laura Mars Gallery shows from 8. June 2024 (Vernissage: 7.06.) the exhibition extra stone next surface by the artist Claude Horstmann. The exhibition shows works by the artist that examine material phenomena as well as sculptural gestures and conditions. In addition to 3D-cutted sculptures made of black marble, concrete and stone, conglomerate and chrome also come into play. The plastic potential of various materials – some of which are derived from urban contexts – is also analysed, translated and condensed in drawing and textual work. A specific terrain is always physical, scientific-physical, but also mental and imaginary. The focus is on form and non-form, on substance and surface, on energetic trace. Here, the examination of materiality, abstraction and transformation probes a ‘geology of the present’, also touching on border areas of the material. In the exhibition, sculpture and drawing as well as textual work correspond with each other and are complemented by the publication AIRE (Fantôme Verlag), in which the artist concentrates photographic images on the materiality and minerality of urban, cultural and nature-like space. The conceptual translation into different media and formats opens up a field of precise references between the works. Claude Horstmann lives and […]\n\nuntil 11.07. | #4304ARTatBerlin | Galerie feinart Berlin presents from 8. June 2024 the exhibition VOYAGE COLLAGE with collages of the three artists Maud Tutsche, ARATORA and Jürgen Tenz († 2021) Works by Maud Tutsche, Jürgen Tenz († 2021) and ARATORA will be presented as the first in an annual series of exhibitions on the theme of collage. The exhibition aims to arouse curiosity about collage in a broader sense and thus raise awareness of the importance of searching for, collecting and reorganising things for the artistic process. The everyday, damaged and discarded objects are transformed and reinterpreted in this playful artistic work. In addition to classic collages, the three protagonists of the exhibition will be showing text-images, digital collages, assemblages, montages and objects. Maud Tutsche, O.T., 2024, Printed book cover, 21 x 13 cm, © Maud Tutsche „In my collages, I combine two aspects that are important to me: on the one hand, the critical examination of socio-political issues and, on the other, beauty and aesthetics. For me, the two are interdependent and inseparable. My examination of social conflicts, disharmony and destruction leads to the search for harmony and beauty, which I want to realise in every work, and […]\n\nuntil 27.07. | #4303ARTatBerlin | Galerie Martin Mertens shows from 20.

June 2024 the exhibition I Belong Here by the artist Ken Nwadiogbu. Who gets to call a place home? This question is at the centre of I Belong Here, a solo exhibition by Ken Nwadiogbu at Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery, Berlin. In a series of vividly coloured paintings and a mixed-media installation, the Nigerian artist layers his own memories and migration experience with that of his friends and family to explore the ways in which we inhabit and claim space. Nwadiogbu moved to London in 2022 to further pursue his artistic studies at the Royal College of Art and while it is an experience that has enriched his practice in many ways, it has also brought about a feeling of dislocation that relates not only to the struggle of adapting to a new culture but also to his position as a migrant and an African artist. After travelling back to Lagos earlier this year, he began making this latest body of work as a way of reflecting on the varied and complex processes of home-building but also as a tribute to anyone who has been made to feel unwelcome, […]\n\nuntil 29.06. | #4301ARTatBerlin | Semjon Contemporary shows from 31. May 2024 (Vernissage: 30.05.) the exhibition Lumière & Bright Cells by the artist Hitomi Uchikura. For the artist who lives near Tokyo, paper is a very important material. Hitomi Uchikura is able to coax from paper properties that one would not necessarily associate with it. For the artist who lives near Tokyo, paper is a very important material. Lumière Hitomi Uchikura is able to coax from paper properties that one would not necessarily associate with it. She moulds the paper by applying force locally. There are configurations like in the series Lumière, staged in an apparent state of suspension in front of the wall and accommodating a sea of circular medallions of different sizes. The areas between the discs are cut free to allow the light behind them to shine through. Once visually fixed, the medallions appear to flip between concave and convex, thus underlining an air of lightness, levitation and, at the same time, suspended animation. These are visual shifts that take place unexpectedly, but without suggesting agitation or chaos. The artwork becomes a meditative plane or relief, particularly when it floats in front of a background as a floor-to-ceiling […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4300ARTatBerlin | Galerie Kornfeld shows from 21. June 2024 the exhibition Das jüngste Gerücht by the artists Franziska Klotz and Jan Muche. From June 21, 2024, Kornfeld Galerie will present the exhibition Das jüngste Gerücht, which is borrowed from a cabaret program by Wolfgang Neuss from 1963. Paintings by Franziska Klotz enter into a dialogue with paintings and sculptures by Jan Muche. What the two artists have in common is that they are inspired by images that have caught their eye. These can be documentation or images of historical events and works of art, but also digital or analogue images that illustrate current events. Their works are representational, but both often work with structures that make their pictures and sculptures appear almost abstract. For them, art is a means of relating to the world in which we live, of dealing with it and of questioning it. In their works, they take up topics that move them for very personal reasons, but which they also think are worth depicting because they tell us something about the world – the one in which we live, but also the one in which we perhaps like to live would. At the […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4299ARTatBerlin | 68 projects shows from 21. June 2024 the exhibition Berlin On My Mind: Celebrating 10 Years of Artistic Residency with works by 21 artists. On June 21st, 68projects will show 21 works by the 21 artists who have been guests at 68projects by KORNFELD as artists-in-residence over the 10 years – with “Berlin On My Mind”. They are celebrating their 10th anniversary with 68 KORNFELD projects and the 10-year artist-in-residence program – but also the future they want to shape – in Berlin, a place that international artists continually look for as a perspective in which we reflect each other and others meet.

June 2024 (Vernissage 07.06.) the exhibition Portrait of the Earth by the artist Chingiz Farzaliyev. The work of the renowned Azerbaijani artist Chingiz Farzaliyev plays an important role in the modern history of art in Azerbaijan. Farzaliyev’s creative credo is the result of a deep reflection on human existence, its spiritual values and its historical destiny in the context of its relationship with nature, its “alma mater”. Chingiz Farzaliyev, Kapaz Gebirge. 2017. Oil on canvas, 85 x 116 cm This artistic vision characterises his particular attitude towards the untouched beauty of nature, untainted by the destructive influence of man. Farzaliyev’s paintings function as visualised meditations on the meaning of life, the position and role of nature and man within the natural order. Chingiz Farzaliyev, Abend, 2004. Oil on canvas, 38 x 48 cm In his works, the boundaries between reality and ideal, between man and nature merge into a harmonious whole that invites the viewer to reflect on profound philosophical questions.

And yes, after extensive ‘transformation nautical miles’, his graphic ‘catching nets’ are equipped with unusually rich and at the same time unmistakable landings: comb-like swaying pencil lines, feather-light and feather-light, orthogonal ink textures, gently shimmering oil pastels, blackish shadow formations, (color) Folds with a physically cuddly appearance, idiosyncratic ‘black runners’, recently also mixed with color panels… there is no end to the line-up of pieces that lure you into the waters of the imagination – and all of this on papers of the finest to the most strange quality.

Portrait of Oskar Manigk in 2024, Courtesy Galerie Mutare Oskar Manigk was born in Berlin in 1934 as the son of the painter Otto Manigk (1902-1972). After graduating from high school and completing an apprenticeship as a carpenter, he was a guest student at the Berlin-Weißensee School of Art from 1956 to 1957, then a guest student at the Institute for Art Education at the Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald. Since 1965 he has been a member of the Association of Visual Artists of the GDR and has been a member of the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Artists’ Association since 1990. His works have been on view in solo and group exhibitions in Germany since 1966. In 1993 he received the Caspar David Friedrich Prize from the Heinemann Foundation Rendsburg, and in 2005 he received the Culture Prize of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania for his life’s work. In March 2024, Oskar Manigk was awarded the Egmont Schaefer Prize for Drawing by the Berliner Kabinett association.

May 2024 the exhibition Nature’s Veil by the artists Juheon Cho, Beate Köhne, Susanne Piotter, Oscar Contreras Rojas and Adonis Stoantzikis. A veil always conceals what actually lies behind it; at best, it allows us to surmise what appears on the surface. The exhibition ‘Nature’s Veil’ presents the works of five different artists, each of whom explore the complicated relationship between humans and nature through paintings, drawings or sculptures. The title ‘Nature’s Veil’ suggests a rather metaphorical examination of nature, the origin of which – like a fleeting perception – appears to be veiled. The exhibited works of art challenge the viewer: what do we perceive with our eyes, how do we really explore what is initially concealed by preconceived ideas, cultural influences or personal bias. A veil often also conveys a sense of mystery, of intrigue, and is worth discovering. About the exhibiting artists Juheon Cho, Mindscape-24102023, 2023, 125 × 175 × 10 cm.

May 2024 the exhibition Suddenly there was no place to build anymore by the artist Francisco Rozas. Galerie Gilla Loercher | Contemporary Art is thrilled to present recent objects and drawings by Chilean artist Francisco Rozas (*1980). The large-format geometric objects for which the artist is known oscillate between flatness and three-dimensionality. They embody exemplary visualisations of mathematical dependencies. Assuming that the sculptures are made of stone or matt lacquered wood, the observer will only recognize on second sight, that he has been decieved. The massive sculptures turn out to be precisely manufactured objects made of light material. The artist’s works are concerned with the theme of deception. The deception of perception. In this logic, the artist found it extremely appealing to deal with the double modular façade of the building erected in the 1970s on the former site of the headquarters of the Ministry of State Security of the GDR in Berlin. The grid structure of the modular façade was designed to allow light in, but not transparency. It served to ensure that the employees of the State Security Service (Stasi) could not be photographed from outside the […]\n\nuntil 29.06. | #4293ARTatBerlin | Jarmuschek + Partner shows from 25. May 2024 (Vernissage: 24.05.) the exhibition Wer Schmetterlinge lachen hört, der weiß, wie Wolken schmecken by the artist Oliver Gröne. Whether heads or still lifes, landscapes or abstract colour spaces – the radical achievements of European art history always form the basis and starting point for Oliver Grönes’ painting, which for him is a form of organising space and a search for a visual essence of our world. Under the title Wer Schmetterlinge lachen hört, der weiß, wie Wolken schmecken, Jarmuschek + Partner will be presenting recently created works by the artist alongside those from earlier phases of his oeuvre. Vernissage: Friday, 24. May 2024, 6 – 9 pm Exhibition period: Saturday, 25. May 2024 until Saturday, 29.

May 2024 the group exhibition Echoes of Past Dreams by the artists Rowan Corkill, Michele Guidarini, Dayana Montesano, Marta Sklodowska and Jaya Suberg. “Echoes of Past Dreams” is a group exhibition featuring works by five diverse artists, each offering a unique interpretation of portraiture: Rowan Corkill, Michele Guidarini, Dayana Montesano, Marta Sklodowska, and Jaya Suberg. Through surreal portraits, black and white photography, collages, and paintings, these artists are transforming into captivating storytellers, creating narratives that resonate on both personal and collective levels. Rowan Corkill‘s artworks depict the trees surrounding his home, alongside the tragic narrative of bird deaths caused by pollution. They evoke a profound consciousness of the interconnectedness between human actions, and their impact on the delicate balance of nature. Rowan Corkill “Ablutio Canaria Domestica” Marta Sklodowska‘s photography channels the folklore of the Slavic culture, particularly through the figure of Baba Yaga, often associated with forest wildlife, exploring themes of mysticism, and cultural heritage. Dayana Montesano‘s portraits delve into intimate moments between lovers, intertwining erotic allusions with deeper explorations of human connection and desire. Jaya Suberg utilizes her own photographs and urban textures to capture the vitality of the moment, reflecting on the pursuit of meaning, […]\n\nuntil 27.07. | #4291ARTatBerlin | Galerie aKonzept shows from 18. May 2024 the group exhibition ART… as an indifferent reality. Galerie aKonzept, Emmanuelle Rapin and Raphaël Levy present the first part of a series of exhibitions dedicated to GALLERY ST:PETRI ARCHIVE OF EXPERIMENTAL AND MARGINAL ART (Lund, Sweden). Founded in 1971 by Jean Sellem, for more than 10 years it was one of the centers where the most current international artistic activities converged. The independence of Jean Sellem’s mind, his speed in organizing events (at least 25 in 1976), allowed the dissemination of ideas from artists whose experimental activities and the political context in which they lived limited visibility. Jean Sellem’s non-commercial gallery was connected to many places and cultural actors in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe. This very active network was animated by artists, some theorists and curators alike. Works and ideas, exhibitions were exchanged and organized by post. At a time when the work of art was not so much seen as a commodity, artists did not hesitate to circulate their creations. Communication and distribution took priority over the material aspect of the work. The NET manifesto, written by Andrzej Kostołowski and Jarosław Kozłowski in 1971, testifies to […]\n\nuntil 06.07. | #4290ARTatBerlin | Galerie Dittmar shows from 16. May 2024 an exhibition by the artist Horst Schäfer. Horst Schäfer (1932-2022) emigrated to New York in 1961. He became an early employee of the New York office of Agence France-Press (AFP), thereby gaining access to important press agencies and photo magazines. His work appears in Newsweek, Harper’s Bazaar, Life, Fortune, among others. First major article in 1962 in US Camera, 1964 exhibition of “Architectural Views” at the Rockefeller Center, subsequently several photo reports in the New York Times. In addition, there is free work, which often develops from dealing with the topography of Manhattan. The architectural photographs, with their abstract, structural conception and lighting, open up their own aesthetic world and open up new possibilities for the medium. Likewise, the street scenes, the images of the parks and urban outskirts condense a specific moment, as they convey something timeless through the compositional quality, the black and white values and the atmospheric content. Horst Schäfer, 42nd Street, 1971, Courtesy Galerie Dittmar In 1968 he was named “Outstanding Press Photographer of the Year 1968”. After returning to Germany in 1980, he resumed agency work.

Christian Holze was born in Naumburg in 1988. He studied fine art at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, at the Academy of Visual Arts Leipzig under Prof Joachim Blank and at the Academy of Fine Arts Hamburg under Prof Anselm Reyle. Christian Holze was a master student of Prof Joachim Blank in Leipzig. In 2022 he received the Goslar Kaiserring Scholarship. The artist lives and works in Leipzig. Christian Holze combines different artistic categories to create hybrids. His research topics are the interfaces between art, technology and business. In his work, he not only explores the connections between these three subject areas, but also poses questions about authorship, commodification and copying in the visual arts. Furthermore, Holze’s works connect the viewer’s art-historical memory with the omnipresence of the commodity image world in the digital age, disguising themselves as a metaproduct.

Dorothée Nilsson Gallery is happy to invite you to the opening of Jenny Magnusson’s solo-exhibition “Scores”. Magnusson’s site-specific sculpture explores internalisation of space, place, artefact, and materiality. The materiality of the, at times, found object is brought to the foreground. For Magnusson form follows materials, not the other way around. The found material is not revised or altered but instead allowed to become part of a constellation, creating a surprising or humorous interplay between otherwise ordinary elements that might have been discarded or overlooked. A sense of dependency, or interconnectedness arises. Revisiting and reusing material, objects, and artefacts is a key part of her practice. Her archive acts as a material pool she dips in and out of. Construction and deconstruction. She says: ‘For me, sculpture is an act of the making, the materiality is the place, and the act of borrowing is interactivity. An exhibition is an interruption in an oscillating movement in which works are created and dissolved. A temporary endpoint.’ Exhibition period: Saturday, 27. April until Saturday, 15. June 2024 Title image caption: Jenny Magnusson, Untitled, 2024, ph.

Spatial designs ranging from the architectural to the archaic. Portrait Klaus Hack © Florian Selig, Berlin Klaus Hack’s works are created directly from the wooden trunk, which provides the direction for the upward verticality. This is always based on the idea of the stele. His figures – seated, standing, moving on stilts or raised on pedestals – are also figures of verticality. Both the architectural elements and the varied interpretations and independent motifs of the human body are designs in space: three-dimensional, spatial and physical. Hack’s open-worked wooden sculptures are not only independent sculptures, the sculptor also uses them as printing blocks for large-format woodcuts. The cylindrical sculptures are rolled up on canvases for this purpose and can thus be printed several times. The sculptures, deliberately left raw and smelling of wood and printing ink, then form an attractive contrast to the wide-span prints at exhibitions. Klaus Hack, Kronos, 1998, Holzschnitt, 150 x 129,5 cm, ed. 7 expl. Klaus Hack was born in Bayreuth in 1966. From 1989-91 […]\n\nuntil 15.06. | #4286ARTatBerlin | Galerie Schindler in Potsdam presents from 25. April 2024 the exhibition GAIA with new works by the artist Birgit Klerch. Birgit Klerch – Gaia Worlds collide in Birgit Klerch’s paintings: both in terms of painting and content. Under the title “Gaia”, a reference to the mythological personification of the earth, the artist shows natural landscapes and floral still lifes. In these, she makes use of classic subjects from art history and, after a brief irritation, leads them towards a new horizon of meaning, which draws explosive new perspectives from the conservative theme. Birgit Klerch, Green, 2024, Oil on Canvas, 140 x 160 cm The tipping point is marked first and foremost by the painterly dissolution of the motif. What initially appears to be painted realistically crumbles into a skillful interplay between finely painted sections and their abstract counterparts, paint flows and drips across the canvas, is splashed or squeegeed. Some areas of the picture are painted through to the last detail, while others remain vaguely blurred. The atmosphere that the artist imbues her landscapes with through sometimes unusual color combinations is also diffuse to unsettling. Birgit Klerch, Wiedehopf, 2024, Oil on Canvas, 70 x 60 […]\n\nuntil 22.06. | #4284ARTatBerlin | Klosterfelde Edition shows from 27. April 2024 the group exhibition More Than Once.

Rosemarie Trockel, Geld stört nie, 1991, Courtesy Klosterfelde Edition The title of the exhibition, which celebrates the 35th anniversary of Klosterfelde Edition, sums up the central characteristic of the edition as an art form. The fact that they are available ‘more than once’ radically distinguishes editions and multiples from the idea that an artistic work must be exclusive. It is a democratic idea that manifests itself here: Editions mean participation. They undermine the elitism of the art world by making it accessible and visible. Keeping the idea of editions alive is the central concern of the gallery. Since it was founded by Helga Maria Klosterfelde in 1989, 140 editions have been produced in an intensive dialogue with around 40 artists. The artworks will […]\n\nuntil 08.06. | #4283ARTatBerlin | Galerie Tanja Wagner presents from 26. April 2024 the exhibition “Glück auf in Deutschland” by the artist Pınar Öğrenci. Galerie Tanja Wagner is pleased to present Glück auf in Deutschland, our first solo exhibition by Pınar Öğrenci. Glück auf is a greeting used in the Ruhr region, the old center of German coal mining, to wish luck to the miners, ensuring they return from the pit profitably and safely. The video, photographic and collage works shown in the exhibition, include visual materials from private and public archives. Using photographs taken in the region between 1950 and 1990, Pınar Öğrenci explores the politics of the body and architecture in the mining industry and transformation of mining buildings, the construction of a German national miners’ identity, the invisible labor and struggles of women, the lack of representation of migrant workers, and racist practices in the health and insurance system in the Ruhr area. Through her collage works produced with archival photographs taken from the Ruhr Museum, she questions the conjoined relationship between migrant labor, factory space, industrial landscape, and the worker’s body in the Ruhr region, the heart of German industry. In a new video work titled I Wish […]\n\nuntil 15.06. | #4282ARTatBerlin | Galerie Thomas Schulte shows from 27. April 2024 the exhibition New Edinburgh Encyclopedia, 1825 by the artist Matt Mullican. Galerie Thomas Schulte presents a solo exhibition of installations along with editions by Matt Mullican on the occasion of this year’s Gallery Weekend Berlin. In rows of assembled images and objects in metal, paper and glass, New Edinburgh Encyclopedia, 1825 foregrounds the artist’s long-established encyclopedic approach and engagement with systems of knowledge, order and representation. While the works on view—produced in the 1990s—draw on an encyclopedia dating back nearly 200 years, they also point to the ways—virtual and real, in which we attempt to categorize, contain, and make sense of the world at present. The work referred to in the exhibition title consists of two parts, which each in turn contain multiple components: 449 magnesium relief plates that carry the contents of the titular book, and the rubbings on paper that were made from them. Rarely shown together, the physical transfer and reproduction of images and information is enacted through their proximity and across different spaces of the gallery. The metal plates become a sort of origin—the source from which reproductions can continuously be made. Propped up on […]\n\nuntil 01.06. | #4281ARTatBerlin | KLEMM’S presents from 20.

On Flourishing reflects exhibitions of the past eleven years at Klemm’s gallery in Prinzessinnenstrasse, opening tomorrow, Saturday APR 20, 2024, from 4—8 pm. With the next, exciting chapter in the new gallery space about to start, we have decided to gather a selection of significant pieces that have inhabited these walls over the past years — each one a different, individual chapter of a shared history — now dialoguing together on the occasion of the very last group show hosted by Klemm’s Kreuzberg location. This celebration is not just a reflection of the past but a bridge to the future. It is an invitation to get together and celebrate not only the gallery’s history but also the vibrant community that shares our memories, emotions, and visions. Vernissage: Saturday, 20.

April 2024 the exhibition Kitchens by the artist Mark Grotjahn. Galerie Max Hetzler is pleased to present Kitchens, an exhibition of large-scale butterfly drawings by Mark Grotjahn, and the artist’s inaugural solo presentation with the gallery, at Potsdamer Straße 77-87, in Berlin. Over the course of three decades, Mark Grotjahn has produced a diverse oeuvre which pushes the boundaries of visual language. Encompassing painting, drawing and sculpture, his multimedia practice foregrounds the tensions and intersections between the abstract and figurative divide. The artist works in distinctive series with a meticulous, almost obsessive drive. Treading the line between geometry and gesture, Grotjahn has developed a unique pictorial lexicon that is at once idiosyncratic and continually evolving. Since his initial ‘Sign Exchange’ project in the 1990s, alongside other significant bodies of work, the artist has gone on to create his renowned and ongoing series of ‘Butterfly’ drawings, with ‘50 Kitchens’ – first shown at LACMA in 2018 – amongst them. Comprising angular motifs, a capricious sense of symmetry, reductive forms and a vibrant palette, Grotjahn seeks to challenge and upturn the hermetic structures of artistic production. The ‘Kitchen Drawings’ originate from the ‘Butterfly’ […]\n\nuntil 04.05. | #4278ARTatBerlin | Galerie Z22 presents from 04. May 2024 the exhibition EIN HAUCH VOM LEBEN by the artist Maryam Motallebzadeh. Maryam Motallebzadeh comes from Iran, where she won an art prize at the age of 13. She studied, went to Ramsar on a travelling scholarship and ran her own gallery in Tehran for around 20 years, where she took part in the Biennial of Painting at the Museum of Contemporary Art in 1995 and 1997 and since then in exhibitions in various European countries before moving to Germany in 1999. Here she studied again, at the University of the Arts in Bremen, and graduated with a diploma. Whether painting, ink drawing on paper, installation or film – Maryam Motallebzadeh’s artworks can be understood as a kind of contemporary witness – created in awareness of certain times in her life and the influence of certain social and political circumstances that affect the artist’s experience and thinking. This is another reason why travelling and encounters with other cultures have always been an important source of inspiration for her artistic themes. Exhibitions by the Iranian-born artist often have the character of rooms that are filled like diaries with notes and […]\n\nuntil 15.06. | #4277ARTatBerlin | Galerie Esther Schipper shows from 26. April 2024 the exhibition spring show by the artist Ann Veronica Janssens. Esther Schipper is pleased to announce spring show, Ann Veronica Janssens’ sixth solo exhibition with the gallery. Coming just a year after the artist’s celebrated solo presentation at Milan’s Pirelli HangarBicocca, spring show brings together a wide range of new and historical works by Janssens. Since the late 1970s, Janssens has developed an artistic practice based on light, color, and natural optical phenomena. She continuously experiments with the characteristic attributes of carefully chosen materials (glass, mirrors, aluminum, artificial fog), shapes, and light, wielding our perception of reality as her medium. Her works give the impression of great simplicity yet create vivid experiences of the act of seeing. With their sense of constant transformation, the works heighten the viewers awareness of the mutability and transience of human cognition. Featuring a careful arrangement of works, spring show in subtle ways materializes the empty space between them. Janssens’ “performative sculptures” require observers to move to fully experience them. Each has its own experiential rhythm, as if requiring a set of gestures from visitors to unlock their essence. We peer into the blocks of optical glass […]\n\nuntil 08.06. | #4275ARTatBerlin | Peres Projects presents from 26. April 2024 (Vernissage:26.04) the exhibition Memoria by the artist Paolo Salvador. Peres Projects presents Memoria, Paolo Salvador’s (*1990, Lima, PE) fifth solo exhibition at the gallery and his third in Berlin. Salvador’s new works tell stories of circulation, transformation, and convergence. His expansive landscapes, populated with voyagers and a diverse bestiary, embark the viewer on a journey that extends far beyond any individual’s orientation in time and space. In several instances throughout the exhibition, Salvador’s characteristic metaphysical backgrounds, in which overlapping planes of color create multiple horizons suggestive of the multiple dimensions of existence, develop into seascapes. Reminiscent of the coastline of his hometown of Lima, they also gesture to mythological odysseys, and historical and contemporary narratives of migration. Inspired by disparate sources such as Andean cosmology and culture and the canon of Western art, the works speak to Salvador’s diasporic experience, the tangling of cultures that make up present-day Peru, and the arts made in today’s global context.
