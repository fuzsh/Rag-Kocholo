        "text": "Eva Braun (born February 6, 1912, Munich, Germany—died April 30, 1945, Berlin) was the mistress and later wife of Adolf Hitler.\n\nShe was born into a lower middle-class Bavarian family and was educated at the Catholic Young Women’s Institute in Simbach-am-Inn. In 1930 she was employed as a saleswoman in the shop of Heinrich Hoffman, Hitler’s photographer, and in this way met Hitler. She became his mistress and lived in a house that he provided in Munich; in 1936 she went to live at his chalet Berghof in Berchtesgaden.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\nThere is no evidence that the relationship between Hitler and Eva Braun was other than a normal one, except that the pleasures that she provided him were those of domesticity and relaxation rather than eroticism. She was an accomplished swimmer and skier. Hitler never allowed her to be seen in public with him or to accompany him to Berlin, and she had no influence on his political life."
