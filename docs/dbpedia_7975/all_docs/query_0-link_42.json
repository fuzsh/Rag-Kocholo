Through various encounters he turned to meaningful performance practice, so-called 'early music' and now studied with Nikolaus Harnoncourt and attended classes with Ingrid Seifert, Reinhard Goebel, Monica Huggett and Jaap Schröder. To understand the music by movement, he studied historical dance with Margarida Basto da Silva Amaral and Sibylle Dahms at the Musicology Institute of the University of Salzburg. As a founding member of the ensemble 'La Follia Salzburg' he won the Early Music Competition in Bruges a second prize. Rasch began a busy concert schedule with major Central European ensembles (Freiburg Baroque Orchestra, Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, Concerto Köln, Les Amis de Philippe, Musica Antiqua Köln, Stuttgart Baroque Orchestra, Cambini quartet, La Fontaine Switzerland, Concert Lorrain etc.) that him in the most important music centers of the world led.
