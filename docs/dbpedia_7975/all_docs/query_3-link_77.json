        "text": "Publishing Institution:\n\nEconomics for Inclusive Prosperity (EfIP)\n\nWe live in an age of astonishing inequality. Income and wealth disparities between the rich and the poor in the United States have risen to heights not seen since the gilded age in the early part of the 20th century. Technological changes and globalization have fueled great wealth accumulation among those able to take advantage of them, but have left large segments of the population behind. Advances in automation and digitization threaten even greater labor market disruptions in the years ahead. Climate change fueled disasters increasingly disrupt everyday life. This is a time when we need new ideas for policy. We think economists, among other social scientists, have a responsibility to be part of the solution, and that mainstream economics – the kind of economics that is practiced in the leading academic centers of the country – is indispensable for generating useful policy ideas. Much of this work is already being done. In our daily grind as professional economists, we see a lot of policy ideas being discussed in seminar rooms, policy forums, and social media. There is considerable ferment in economics that is often not visible to outsiders. At the same time, the sociology of the profession – career incentives, norms, socialization patterns – often mitigates against adequate engagement with the world of policy, especially on the part of younger academic economists. We believe the tools of mainstream economists not only lend themselves to, but are critical to the development of a policy framework for what we call “inclusive prosperity.” While prosperity is the traditional concern of economists, the “inclusive” modifier demands both that we consider the interest of all people, not simply the average person, and that we consider prosperity broadly, including non-pecuniary sources of well-being, from health to climate change to political rights.\n\nVisit Site\n\nResources:\n\nSeptember 01, 2022 Inequality and the Decline of Small Business\n\nBy: Sebastian Doerr, Thomas Drechsel, Donggyu Lee\n\nJuly 01, 2021 EfIP Online Panel: A New Macroeconomics?\n\nBy: Jón Steinsson\n\nJuly 01, 2021 New Directions in Macroeconomics\n\nBy: Gillian Brunet\n\nJune 01, 2021 Majoritarian versus Proportional Representation Voting\n\nBy: Ethan Kaplan\n\nApril 01, 2021 A Policy Matrix for Inclusive Prosperity\n\nBy: Dani Rodrik, Stefanie Stantcheva\n\nMarch 01, 2021 The Divide between Economic History and History: From Ideology to Methodology\n\nBy: Gavin Wright\n\nAugust 01, 2020 Why, When, and How to Teach the Fundamentals of Inequality in Principles\n\nBy: Can Erbil, Geoffrey Sanzenbacher\n\nJune 01, 2020 Racial Inequality\n\nBy: Lisa D.
