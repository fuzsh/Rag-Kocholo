        "text": "The friendly relationship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea sustained sound development in 2013.\n\nThe two countries enjoyed close political exchanges and increasing mutual trust. In September, Zhao Hongzhu, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Deputy Secretary of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, led a CPC delegation to Equatorial Guinea. He met and had talks with President of Equatorial Guinea and President of the ruling Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Prime Minister Vicente Ehate Tomi as well as Secretary General of the PDGE and Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education and Science Lucas Nguema Esono Mbang respectively. In November, Second Vice President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue paid an informal visit to China. He met with Vice President Li Yuanchao and had an in-depth exchange of views with him on bilateral relations, practical cooperation and other issues. In June, Secretary General of the PDGE Nguema visited China. In September, Equatorial Guinea's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Agapito Mba Mokuy attended the third round of Political Consultations between Chinese and African Foreign Ministers on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.\n\nOn 19 April, China's new Ambassador to Equatorial Guinea Zhao Hongsheng presented his Letter of Credence to President Obiang.\n\nSteady progress was made in the cooperation between the two countries in various fields. The construction of the Chinese-assisted Malabo Building project of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Equatorial Guinea proceeded smoothly. Projects assisted by China under the framework of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, such as the building of a vocational school and a demonstration farm and the donation of solar cells, went well underway. China provided Equatorial Guinea with a batch of anti-malaria drugs and concluded the training program on antimalaria technologies. The first \"China Film Week\" was successfully held at the National Cultural Center of Equatorial Guinea."
