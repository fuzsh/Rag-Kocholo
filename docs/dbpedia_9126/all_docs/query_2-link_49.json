        "text": "In pre-colonial times, present-day Equatorial Guinea was inhabited by the Pygmy and Ndowe tribes. Control of the country was then contested by multiple European powers before coming under the control of the Spanish in the 19th century. Equatorial Guinea became an independent nation in 1968. Since then, it has been governed by two authoritarian presidents. Francisco Macías Nguema ruled from 1968 to 1979, and Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo – the world’s longest-serving leader – deposed Nguema in a coup in 1979. Since the discovery of oil in 1996, cautious steps toward democratization ended and President Obiang has further consolidated his power in a successful attempt to control the country’s oil rents. Proceeds from oil production flow into the hands of only a small elite, and the regime utilizes clientelism and repression to maintain its power. Elections are not free and fair, and human rights abuses and arbitrary detentions are commonplace. There is only one legal opposition party (members of which face detention and torture), the governing party holds every seat in the legislature, and Obiang regularly receives more than 95 per cent of votes in elections – including in his reelection to a sixth term in 2022.\n\nFor the regime, politics is driven by the goal of maintaining its oil wealth and pursuing large-scale infrastructure projects, which account for about 80 per cent of the state’s budget. For the general population, health and education are the most salient issues, as only 65 per cent of people have access to basic drinking water, vaccination rates are among the worst in the world, and nearly 40 per cent of children are not enrolled in primary school. Despite its high GDP per capita, Equatorial Guinea performs poorly in the Human Development Index due to extreme wealth inequality. Graft is also endemic, as the country is among the most corrupt in the world.\n\nWhile the country has made some progress toward gender equality, violence and discrimination against women remain common, and pregnant girls are banned from attending school. While female representation in the legislature has improved, women suffer low levels of employment and high rates of gender-based violence. The country’s minority ethnic groups suffer discrimination and persecution, most notably the Bubi people on the island of Bioco, who have been subject to property expropriation and restrictions on their freedom of movement. Equatorial Guinea’s LGBTQIA+ community has been the subject of state-perpetrated human rights abuses, including torture and forced evictions."
