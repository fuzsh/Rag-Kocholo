        "text": "The national health system of Equatorial Guinea consists of four levels: health posts in each village of 600 people, dispensaries in health centres with a qualified nurse at the intermediate level, district level hospitals, and two referral hospitals at the most centralized level. In 2004, there were an estimated 25 physicians, 40 nurses, 1 dentist, 1 pharmacist, and 2 midwives per 100,000 people. Major health problems (1992 data) are preventable diseases, mainly malaria (increasingly chloroquine resistant), parasitic disease, upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and complications of pregnancy. In the continental zone, sickle cell anaemia is common.\n\nAHO PRIORITIES FOR HEALTH DELIVERY PLAN IN EQUATORIAL GUINEA\n\nHealth systems.\n\nChronic, noncommunicable diseases.\n\nFood, nutrition, and physical activity.\n\nFamily health, with special emphasis on the health of the elderly.\n\nEnvironment and health.\n\nInstitutional services.\n\nMental health and substance abuse.\n\nHuman resource development and management.\n\nCommunicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS.\n\nRESOURCES (USD)\n\nAHO EQUATORIAL GUINEA BUDGET 2020 (USD million)* based on 2017 pop 1.268 million World Bank\n\nSO BUDGET ITEM AMOUNT* 1 Combating communicable diseases\n\n26\n\n2 Tackling non communicable diseases\n\n30\n\n3 Addressing determinants of health & risk factors\n\n15\n\n4 Modernising health system and health service\n\n17\n\n5 Improving preparedness, surveillance and response\n\n18\n\n6 Developing good governance & corporate services\n\n20\n\nTotal\n\n126\n\nAHO estimates that it needs to spend at least USD100 per capita on health to meet the basic health needs of the people in Africa.
