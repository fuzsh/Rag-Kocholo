        "text": "Equatorial Guinea – 157th Country. To see where I have been so far, check out my map as I count down the final 93 countries on the road to all 193 UN countries. Equatorial Guinea is my 157th country.\n\nCheck out the best 193 travel books to read!\n\nEquatorial Guinea is a small country located on the west coast of Central Africa, bordered by Cameroon and Gabon. The area that is now Equatorial Guinea was originally inhabited by various Bantu-speaking groups before being colonized by the Portuguese and later, the Spanish. It is the only Spanish speaking nation in Africa. The country gained independence from Spain in 1968 and has since been led by a series of authoritarian regimes. Equatorial Guinea has significant reserves of oil and gas, which have been a major driver of the economy, but there have been concerns about corruption and human rights abuses. The country has also faced challenges related to poverty, health, and education. EG is comprised of a mainland portion as well as a island where the capital resides.\n\nThis was another odd visit, this time to the capital, Malabo. I hooked up with a guide who worked for the VIP diplomatic area of the government. We had two aborted tours and a successful circumnavigation of the island, Bioka. Otherwise, this trip was characterized by one comical mishap after another."
