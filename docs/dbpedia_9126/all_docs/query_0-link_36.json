        "text": "Abstract\n\nEquatorial Guinea is the only officially Spanish-speaking nation in Africa and the only country in sub-Saharan Africa where Spanish is spoken natively or nearnatively by a significant proportion of the population. French and Portuguese are acknowledged as official languages but have few non-immigrant speakers. Fang, Bubi, and Ndowé are among the most prominent African languages spoken in Equatorial Guinea, which together with Pidgin English and the Portuguese-lexified creole Fa d’Ambú (Annobonese creole), make up the linguistic matrix of this small but territorially and ethnically complex nation. At the official level, only Spanish is used, although for most Guineans it is a second language. Equatorial Guinean Spanish has many consistently identifiable traits, as well as variation due to varying levels of individual proficiency.\n\nLipski, John M.. \"28 Equatorial Guinea\".
