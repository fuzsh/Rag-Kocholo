As you already know, our country has an equatorial climate characterized by warm and constant temperatures throughout the year. However, there are two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season.\n\nDuring the dry season, the climate is less humid and temperatures are higher. This makes it the perfect time to enjoy our beaches and outdoor activities on the island of Bioko or in the mainland region. On the other hand, the rainy season is when the vegetation of our country becomes a true spectacle of color and life. The rainfall is very abundant and regular, and can exceed 1,500 or 2,000 mm per year. Although some people may think that this could be a problem for tourism, the truth is that it is a unique and surprising experience for those who visit us. The island of Bioko is covered in intense green color and the fauna and flora of our country become even more exuberant.\n\nWhat is the typical vegetation of Equatorial Guinea?\n\nUndoubtedly one of the greatest attractions in Equatorial Guinea.

You will experience fascinate scenery like perfectly formed beaches with black volcanic or rocky sand, such as the Sipopo coast, to incredibly lush forests in Moca as well as alpine lands at heights of 3,000 meters, such as the Pico Basilé.\n\nThree-quarters of the Continental Region is virgin forest,\n\nincredibly beautiful. The rain forest is of great abundance. This type of jungle is common in the tropical or equatorial climate. Photos reveal how green and lush—a marvel the forest becomes.\n\nAlthough part remains untapped today, on Bioko Island, cocoa, coffee and banana plantations abound. Finca Sampaca in recovering part of the industrial production of cocoa for its subsequent treatment and consumption. The quantities, unfortunately, are not yet enough to export, but little by little they begin to nourish the supermarkets with 100% national produce, a piece of excellent news for cocoa lovers.\n\nIn the southern part of Bioko island, there is another type of rain forest, rich in orchids; mostly due to a large amount of rain that occurs in this area, especially in the rainiest season.\n\nCloser to the Basilé peak, the vegetation changes due to the decrease in oxygen levels, the towering trees and lush vegetation, give way to a perennial jungle from 700m to 1,800m, with a large number of tree ferns. From there, the prairies begin to appear along with all kinds of lower plant formations.\n\nWhich animals can we find in Equatorial Guinea?\n\nEquatorial Guinea is a country that boasts a great diversity of animals due to its geographical position and the wide variety of habitats found in its territory. From terrestrial to aquatic animals, Equatorial Guinea is a paradise for animal lovers.\n\nOne of the most emblematic animals of Equatorial Guinea is the gorilla, where the albino gorilla Copito de Nieve stands out. Gorillas are primates that inhabit the tropical forests of central and western Africa. Although they are usually quite shy, it is possible to spot them in some national parks in the country, such as Monte Alen National Park.\n\nAnother land animal that can be found in Equatorial Guinea is the elephant. These elephants are very important animals for the ecological balance of the forests, as they help to disperse seeds and create new clearings in the vegetation. Primates such as colobus monkeys, vervet monkeys, and chimpanzees can also be found.\n\nSeveral species of cetaceans such as whales and dolphins inhabit the waters surrounding Equatorial Guinea, which can be spotted on whale and dolphin watching excursions in the Gulf of Guinea and around Corisco Island. Sea turtles, such as the Leatherback, Olive Ridley, and Green turtles, can also be found, as well as African manatees and a wide variety of fish and crustaceans.\n\nThe island of Bioko is the habitat of seven species of diurnal primates. Currently, they are endangered due to the historical abuse of their poaching for human consumption. These types of primates are mainly found in Pico Basile National Park and the Great Caldera Scientific Reserve, which is the only place where all seven species can be found in the same habitat, as we tell you in this post about primates in Equatorial Guinea.\n\nIn addition, in the insular region, several little-known endemic bird species can be found.\n\nIn summary, Equatorial Guinea is a country rich in biodiversity that offers nature lovers the opportunity to spot a wide variety of animals in their natural habitats. From majestic gorillas and elephants to colorful birds and marine creatures, Equatorial Guinea is a perfect destination for those seeking unique experiences in contact with nature.\n\nWhich tribes or ethnic groups form Equatorial Guinea?\n\nEquatoguineans is a conglomeration of people with different cultural backgrounds.
