        "text": "Located on the west coast of Africa, Equatorial Guinea consists of a mainland enclave, Río Muni, and five inhabited islands: Bioko (between 1973 and 1979, Macías Nguema Biyogo, and before that Fernando Póo), Annobón (Pagalu during the 1970s), Corisco, Elobey Chico, and Elobey Grande. The total area is 28,051 sq km (10,831 sq mi), of which Río Muni, along with Corisco and the Elobeys, accounts for 26,017 sq km (10,045 sq mi) and Bioko, along with Annobón, 2,034 sq km (785 sq mi). Comparatively, the area occupied by Equatorial Guinea is slightly larger than the state of Maryland. Río Muni is bounded on the N by Cameroon, on the E and S by Gabon, and on the W by the Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic Ocean), with a length of 248 km (154 mi) ENE – WSW and 167 km (104 mi) SSE – NNW . Bioko, situated 56 km (35 mi) W of Cameroon and about 259 km (161 mi) NW of Río Muni, extends 74 km (46 mi) NE – SW and 37 km (23 mi) SE – NW . Annobón is 686 km (426 mi) SW of Bioko; Corisco and the Elobeys are off the SW coast of Bioko, within sight of Gabon. The total boundary length of Equatorial Guinea is 835 km (519 mi), of which 296 km (183 mi) is coastline.\n\nThe capital city of Equatorial Guinea, Malabo, is located on the island of Bioko (Isla de Bioko)."
