It is one of the smallest countries in Africa and is bordered by Cameroon, Gabon, the Gulf of Guinea, and Sao Tome and Principe in the Gulf. The government system is a republic; the chief of state is the president, and the head of government is the prime minister. Equatorial Guinea has a traditional economic system in which the allocation of available resources is made on the basis of primitive methods, and many citizens engage in subsistence agriculture. Equatorial Guinea is a member of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)."
