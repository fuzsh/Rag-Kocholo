        "text": "Things to do and see in Equatorial Guinea\n\nThere are a lot of things and activities that you can seriously engage in while in Equatorial Guinea and these include the following:\n\nCorisco Island\n\nTravel back in time with a visit to the Corisco Island that also acts as a nature reserve. The Island is a home to some ruins from when the Portuguese colonialists were still in the country and it has the oldest cemetery that is believed to be about 2000 years old. Besides the colonial ruins and the cemetery, you will also get a chance to see some sea turtles as the Island is a breeding area for the different species of sea turtles. Relax at the white sand beaches that are found at the Island while watching the sea turtles and also take a walk around especially towards the abandoned airport that has not been used for quite some time.\n\nThe mainland\n\nThe Mainland should also be part of your tourist destinations if you are planning on visiting Equatorial Guinea. Some of the interesting things that you get to see as you drive through the mainland include;\n\nThe Alen National Park, this is a protected area covering about 14oo square kilometers and it is the perfect place for tourists to track down elephants as it has over 1100 elephants that habitate within the Park. The Monte Alen national Park is filled with some of the most unique dense rainforests found on the continent of Africa and within the forest are some of the most exciting hiking trails that are worth trying out. Besides being a home to quite a large herd of elephants, it is also a home to gorillas, chimpanzees and goliath frogs among others.\n\nExplore the Oyala city, the Oyala city is the new capital city of Equatorial Guinea and it is found right in the middle of the rain forest. Although some parts of the new capital city are still under construction, it is still worth visiting especially if you are a fun of nature walks.\n\nBioko Island\n\nThe Biko Island is one of the tourist destinations in Equatorial Guinea that is worth checking out. The Bioko Island is a home to the current capital city of Equatorial Guinea that is Malabo although before the end of this year 2020 they plan on finishing construction of the new city which will be named the new capital city.\n\nTake a walk around the Malabo city and get to see the numerous colonial buildings that are scattered all over the place, go explore the Horatio Giant tree that is found on the Island and relax at the beach after your long exploration of the Bioko Island.\n\nAnnobon Island\n\nThe Annobon Island is the least visited island in Equatorial Guinea although it has some stunning sites that are worth exploring. It is a home to the Crater Lake known as the Lago Mazafim and some of the water sports that are offered here include snorkeling and hiking. The Island is located in a secluded location making it the perfect get away for tourists who don’t like crowds and once you decide to visit the Island you will be ensured of having 99% of it to yourself that is of course minus the locals. The white sand beaches that are found along the Island provide a very good place for relaxation while enjoying the unique culture from the locals that is way too different from the culture in other parts of the country.\n\nMoca Valley\n\nThe Moca valley is found in the southern part of the Bioko Island. It is a home to some of the highest peaks in the country and the Buki ethnic group who have lived here for many years. The area has good hiking routes that you can get to explore and also meet up with the Buki people and enjoy their company as they sing and dance to folk songs. Do not forget to carry lots of water, good hiking boots because you are going to be walking a lot and a camera to take photos of beautiful scenery for when you get to the peaks.\n\nEvinayong\n\nEvinayong is located between the Altos de Nsork and the Monte Alen national Park making it a stop Centre for all tourists who love hiking. If you have a love for adventure then this is the town to be as you get a real one on one with the locals at the different bar joints. You can also go shopping while in the area and get to admire the different palm trees that are found on either side of the road in Evinayong.\n\nSanta Carlos Caldera\n\nWhen one talks about the Santa Carlos Caldera what comes to mind is the illegal selling of the sea turtle eggs. The Place is known littered with local law enforcers trying to stop the act and protect the sea turtles and although it is filled with dilapidated mud wattled houses unlike its former glory self, the hiking routes and the majestic waterfall found at the Santa Carlos Caldera will make your trip worthwhile.\n\nBata\n\nThis is the largest city in Equatorial Guinea with a population of over 170,000 people living within it. Bata was once the capital city of Equatorial Guinea and that is why it has some of the best buildings in the country most of which were constructed during the colonial era. One of the places that you should look out for is the Bata cathedral which was constructed using Spanish architecture during the colonial times and you can also go around the town shopping at the different markets. There is an airport for all those that want to travel to Cameroon as well.\n\nAccommodation facilities in Equatorial Guinea\n\nSince most of the cities that are located within the country are tourist destinations themselves, you will find a lot of hotels ranging from budget friendly, mid-range and luxury hotels and all you have to do is call your tour operator and find out which hotel range first into your budget and comfort. For those that are not so much into confined areas, you can try out camping but you will still need to find out whether it is safe to go camping. Some of the hotels found in Malabo that I think you should really try out include:\n\nMago suites\n\nThese are strategically located on your way from the airport. It is located in Malabo, has free WI-FI, airport shuttle lift, a casino where you get to relax from, sound proof self-contained rooms, 24 hour room service and each room goes for 172 dollars per night.\n\nThe Sofitel Malabo Sipopo Le Golf\n\nThe Sofitel Malabo Sipopo le Golf is a luxury hotel that is found in Malabo offering services like 24 hours room service, self-contained rooms that offer guests their privacy, a laundry room, family rooms, parking and free Wi-Fi and not forgetting games like tennis at the tennis court and relaxation at the private beach where the hotel is located. Each room goes for 158 dollars per night.\n\nBest time to visit Equatorial Guinea\n\nEquatorial Guinea has different seasons almost happening at the same time in the different regions that is the different parts of Equatorial Guinea receive different types of climate and this is the main factors in determining when to visit the country because the activities that are carried out in the country also depend on the weather.
