        "text": "The president is both the head of state and head of government. It has extensive powers, including naming and dismissing members of the cabinet. It can make laws by decree, dissolve the chamber of representatives, negotiate and ratify treaties, call legislative elections, and act as commander in chief of the armed forces. The prime minister coordinates government activities in areas other than foreign affairs, national defense, and security.\n\nThe president is in charge with his judicial advisers (the supreme court). In descending rank are the appeals courts, chief judges for divisions, and local magistrates.\n\nLegislative power is vested in both the government and the chamber of people's representatives (the lower house of the parliament)."
