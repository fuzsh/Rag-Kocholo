        "text": "Overview\n\nSecurity Status\n\nHigh Degree of Caution\n\nLatest Travel Alert\n\nThe Government of Equatorial Guinea has declared the end of its outbreak of the Marburg Virus Disease, which was first reported in February 2023. The declaration comes after the last confirmed case was discharged from hospital in April 2023.\n\nTravel to Equatorial Guinea\n\nFor the latest information on the COVID-19 situation in Equatorial Guinea, including travel restrictions, please check here.\n\nGeneral Travel Advice\n\nTravellers are advised to exercise caution when travelling to Equatorial Guinea but particularly in Bata and Malabo where armed robberies and petty crime are prevalent. Demonstrations and large public gatherings should be avoided.\n\nIf you wish to travel outside Malabo on the island of Bioko or outside Bata on the mainland you will need to inform the local authorities in advance. You are advised to carry an appropriate form of identification with you at all times. The border with Cameroon is frequently closed and you should contact local authorities for the latest information.\n\nIf there is an emergency, or if you need help and advice, you can contact our Consular Assistance Unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.\n\nHealth\n\nGet travel and medical insurance\n\nBefore travelling, the Department strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.\n\nVaccinations\n\nCheck what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We can’t advise you on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.\n\nPolio vaccination is recommended for all travellers from Ireland to countries where polio transmission is a risk. Before travelling to areas where poliomyelitis cases are still occurring, travellers should ensure that they have completed the recommended age-appropriate polio vaccine schedule and have received a booster dose, if necessary. More information is available on the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre website.\n\nEvidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.\n\nMedication\n\nMake sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.\n\nAdditional information\n\nIf you are unsure about the entry requirements for Equatorial Guinea, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the country’s nearest Embassy or Consulate\n\nYou can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.\n\nPassports\n\nIt’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Equatorial Guinea and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.\n\nIf your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad, we can help.\n\nWhat we can do:\n\nIssue you a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;\n\nIssue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.\n\nWe’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Equatorial Guinea there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.\n\nYou should contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate to find out what you need to do to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise you on the fees which apply.\n\nMore advice\n\nIreland doesn’t have an Embassy or Consulate in Equatorial Guinea so we can’t verify detailed travel advice to ensure that it’s accurate, appropriate and up to date. However, we encourage you to conduct your own research and to read these links to travel advice from other foreign ministries:\n\nUK: Foreign and Commonwealth Office\n\nCanada: Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade\n\nNew Zealand: Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade\n\nAustralia: Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\n\nUSA: Department of State"
