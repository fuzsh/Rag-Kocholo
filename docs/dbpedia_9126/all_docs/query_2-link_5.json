        "text": "Summary\n\nUnder Spanish colonial rule for most of the modern era, Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968. At the time of independence, Equatorial Guinea had one of the highest per capita incomes and the highest literacy rates in Africa. Since independence, Equatorial Guinea has attracted investment from U.S. companies and the United States Government. With the increased U.S. investment presence, relations between the U.S. and the Government of Equatorial Guinea have been characterized by a positive, constructive relationship.\n\nModern Flag of Equatorial Guinea\n\nDiplomatic Relations\n\nEstablishment of Diplomatic Relations, .\n\nDiplomatic relations were established on November 21, 1968, when Ambassador Albert W. Sherer presented his credentials to the government of Equatorial Guinea. Sherer also was accredited to Togo and was resident at Lomé.\n\nEstablishment of the American Embassy in Malabo, .\n\nThe American Embassy at Santa Isabel (now Malabo) was established on August 1, 1969, with Albert N. Williams as Chargé d’Affaires ad interim.\n\nSuspension of Diplomatic Relations by the United States, .\n\nThe United States suspended diplomatic relations with Equatorial Guinea on March 14, 1976. The Department of State announced that the action had been taken after it learned the U.S. Ambassador, Herbert J. Spiro, and the U.S. Consul, had been declared personae non gratae, in what the Department termed an “unwarranted affront” to the two individuals and the U.S. government.\n\nResumption of Normal Diplomatic Relations, .\n\nNormal relations were resumed on December 19, 1979, when Mable Murphy Smythe presented her credentials as American Ambassador.\n\nAmerican Embassy in Equatorial Guinea Reestablished, .\n\nThe American Embassy in Malabo was reestablished on June 11, 1981, with Joanne Thompson as Chargé d’Affaires ad interim.\n\nClosure of American Embassy in Equatorial Guinea, .\n\nEmbassy Malabo was closed on October 31, 1995, and its functions were transferred to the Embassy in Yaounde November 1, 1995.\n\nReopening of the American Embassy in Malabo, .\n\nRecognizing the U.S.’s growing economic and political interests, the U.S. Government reopened Embassy Malabo in 2006. U.S. Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Donald J. Johnson presented his credentials on November 23, 2006, becoming the first resident ambassador in over ten years."
