        "text": "CORISCO ISLAND\n\nCorisco is a small island of Equatorial Guinea, located 29 kilometres (18 mi) southwest of the Rio Muni estuary that defines the border with Gabon. Corisco, whose name derives from the Portuguese word for lightning, has an area of just 14 km2, and its highest point is 35 metres (115 ft) above sea level. During the Iron Age (50 BC – 1400 AD) and prior to the arrival of the Portuguese, the island was densely settled.\n\nThe most important evidence of human occupation comes from the area of Nandá, near the eastern coast, where dozens of prehistoric burials have been excavated. After more than three centuries of abandonment, during which the island was sporadically visited by European sailors, Corisco was settled by the Benga people. They arrived during the second half of the 18th century attracted by the prospects of trade with the Europeans. The island was later acquired by Spain in 1843, as a result of an arrangement made by J. J. Lerena y Barry with Benga king Bonkoro I. Bonkoro I died in 1846 and was succeeded by his son Bonkoro II, but due to rivalries on the island, Bonkoro II moved to São Tomé, and Munga I ruled in Corisco 1848 to 1858, his son Munga II taking over, and meeting the explorer Manuel Iradier in the 1870s.\n\nIn general the Spanish paid little attention to Corisco. In the early part of the 20th century it was part of the administration of Elobey, Annobon, and Corisco, and postage stamps were issued under that name. It became an integral part of Equatorial Guinea upon independence. Corisco and the surrounding waters of Corisco Bay have become of interest in recent years for their oil prospects.\n\nANNOBON ISLAND\n\nAnnobón Province is a small province of Equatorial Guinea consisting of the island of Annobón and its associated islets in the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean’s Cameroon Line. The provincial capital is San Antonio de Palé on the north side of the island; the other town is Mabana, formerly known as San Pedro. The roadstead is relatively safe, and some passing vessels take advantage of it in order to obtain water and fresh provisions, of which Annobon offers an abundant supply. However, there is no regular shipping service to the rest of Equatorial Guinea, and ships call as infrequently as every few months. During the 2015 census, it had 5,232 inhabitants, a small population increase from the 5,008 registered by the 2001 census. The official language is Spanish but most of the inhabitants speak a creole form of Portuguese. The island’s main industries are fishing and timbering.\n\nCOGO\n\nCogo (also known as Kogo or Koszho, formerly Puerto Iradier) is a remote town on the Muni estuary in Rio Muni, Equatorial Guinea, lying east of Acalayong. It is known for its partly ruined Spanish Colonial architecture. It is the southernmost city of the Littoral province of Equatorial Guinea. It is located 121 km from Bata by road or 117 km when traveling through Acalayong. It is surrounded to the east and southeast by the Congüe River and to the west and southwest by the Mitemle River.\n\nBoth the Congüe and the Mitemle Rivers drain the Muni Estuary, sometimes giving the city of Cogo the shape and appearance of an island when in fact it is a peninsuala. A few meters from the port that is currently being renovated is the uninhabitable Island of Evele. Most of the population, especially the coastal population heavily rely on subsistence fishing and the Muni estuary was a major source of income as it was the gateway for passengers traveling to neighboring Gabon."
