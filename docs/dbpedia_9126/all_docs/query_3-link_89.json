        "text": "Map of Equatorial Guinea, Regions, Geography, and Facts\n\nEquatorial Guinea has 8 provinces. These are San Antonio de PalÃ©, Bioko Norte, Bioko Sur, Centro Sur, KiÃ©-Ntem, Litoral, Wele-Nzas, and Djibloho.\n\nIn this article, we will give some general information about the provinces of Equatorial Guinea such as population and area.\n\nYou can see the Provinces of Equatorial Guinea on the map below.\n\nProvinces of Equatorial Guinea Map\n\nProvinces of Equatorial Guinea\n\nAnnobÃ³n\n\nThe capital of the province is San Antonio de PalÃ©. The population of 2015 is 5,232. It also has an area of 17 square kilometers.\n\nBioko Norte\n\nThe capital of the province is Rebola. The population of 2015 is 299,836.

It also has an area of 5,478 square kilometers.\n\nCountry Facts\n\nPopulation: 1,343,011\n\nPopulation Density: 48 per Km2\n\nLand Area: 28,050 Km2\n\nEquatorial Guinea is one of the smallest countries in Africa, located in West Africa, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIt is bounded by Cameroon in the north, Gabon in the south and east, the Gulf of Guinea in the west and SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe in the southwest.\n\nGeography\n\nAs one of the smallest countries in the African continent, the country is spread over an area of 28.051 kmÂ². Of these, 26,000 kmÂ² is composed of the mainland, while the remaining area covers the islands. In the islands, Bioko is the biggest island of 2017 kmÂ². Starting from the mainland shore Mbini reaches up to 1,200 m inland.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe country is governed by a dictatorial regime, despite the countryâ€™s form of government as a parliamentary democracy. President Mbasogo is one of the top decision makers in the country.\n\nAnalysts say the country is governed by a Kleptocracy system and states that the country has one of the most corrupt systems in the world. With the constitutional amendment made in 1991, the president was elected for a period of seven years.\n\nThe head of state has the power to appoint the prime minister, members of the judiciary, and is also at the top of the armed forces.\n\nClimate\n\nIt has a tropical climate. The average temperature is around 26 Â° C. The average rainfall per year in the country with abundant rainfall varies between 2400-4600 mm. Between June and August, the Rio Muni region has a dry season, while Bioko has a rainy season. December â€“ February is the opposite situation. Temperatures in the island of Bioko vary around 16 to 33 degrees Celsius, while temperatures in the Rio Muni region are around 27 degrees.\n\nReligion\n\nOne of the characteristics that Spain left after the colonial period was religious. 87% of the people of Equatorial Guinea belong to the Catholic Christian faith. While 5% of the population is Protestant Christian, there are a group of about 1,000 Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses in the country. The proportion of those who believe in local religions is almost negligible.\n\nIndustry and Tourism\n\nThe majority of people are engaged in agriculture. After the discovery and processing of oil resources in 1996, the economic development of the country has been affected in recent years. As of 2004, Equatorial Guinea has become the 3rd largest oil producer in Sub-Saharan Africa. Forestry, farming, and fishing are also important factors that meet gross national product."
