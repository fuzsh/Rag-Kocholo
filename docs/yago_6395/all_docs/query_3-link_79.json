        "text": "\"Reading the [book] has been a source of endless delight. This scholarly and highly readable account brings England's Norman queens out of the shadows and dazzlingly to life. Drawing on a wealth of fascinating contemporary sources, Alison Weir presents the drama, passion and intrigue of these extraordinary women's lives and restores them to their rightful place in history. A masterpiece. I would like to wish Alison every success with this stunning book. I am already looking forward to Volume II!\" (Tracy Borman)\n\n\"Though Norman queens were largely unknowable, leave it to this prolific historical biographer to bring them to life. Having previously tackled the lives of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Isabella of France, Weir presents five queens of the post-Norman Invasion era who sometimes wielded power in their own right, and not just as queen consort. As usual, Weir is meticulous in her research. Another sound feminist resurrection by a seasoned historian.\" (Kirkus Reviews)\n\n\"Another polished, fascinating gem from Weir, herself the queen of history writing. It was a man's world, but, as Weir convincingly shows, the fove queens wielded real power, in front of, as well as behind, the throne.\" (Sunday Express)\n\n\"Weir pens another readable, well-researched English history. Weir's research skills and storytelling ability combine beautifully to tell a fascinating story supported by excellent historical research. Fans of her fiction and non-fiction will enjoy this latest work.\" (Starred Library Journal review)\n\n\"I read your book, and I thought it was fantastic. You were able to turn these queens into complex characters of flesh and blood and put them in the context of their time without the men overwhelming their stories. They are so much stronger than I ever realized!\" (Nancy Bilyeau)\n\n“Weir skillfully strips away centuries of romantic lore to share a balanced and authentic take on the importance of these female monarchs.\n\nWhat emerges is a seamless royal saga, an all-encompassing portrait of English medieval queenship, and a sweeping panorama of British his-\n\ntory.” (Bookreporter)\n\n\"Weir brings her charaaracters vibrantly to life.\" (Must Reads, Daily Mail)\n\n\"The proclaimed expert on all things Tudor presents the drama, passion and intrigue of these extraordinary women's lives - it's a masterpiece.\"\n\n(Waterstones' Picks)\n\n\"Alison Weir has the rare gift of being able to bring history vividly to life. This book... offers a fascinating perspective on a time of great change and uncertainty.\" (Choice magazine)\n\n\"A riveting history of the century following the Norman Conquest.\" (Paperback Pick of the Week, The Mail on Sunday)\n\n\"Underpinned by extensive reading in the original sources . . . [The book] will serve as a useful reference for those needing a detailed biographical compendium.\" (The Washington Post)\n\nAlison Weir on QUEENS OF THE CONQUEST:\n\nWriting the story of the Norman queens was essentially the piecing together of numerous pieces of research, and what struck me forcibly was not so much any particular strand of research, but the overarching theme that emerged from it all, which was the real power that these women wielded - more than any English medieval queen since, even Eleanor of Aquitaine. It's often said that medieval women were subservient in every way to men, but the Norman queens were sharers in the royal dominion. They even led armies and directed military campaigns. Two of them waged a civil war so fierce that it was said that God and His saints slept. I wrote my chapter on queenship before I wrote the main text - and I had to revise most of it later, in the light of what I had discovered. So, first and foremost, it's all about female power!\n\nSeveral other things struck me while writing the book, and I'm rather proud of my research on the children of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders, because this is a subject long hotly debated by historians, who can rarely agree on the number of daughters, their dates, names and marriages, and indeed the dates of birth and order of arrival of all the children. I think I've come up with a credible overview.\n\nOver the years, especially after I published Eleanor of Aquitaine, many people have asked if I would write a biography of Eleanor's mother-in-law, the Empress Maud (or Matilda), and I've now done so in Queens of the Conquest. Modern received wisdom is that she had a bad press among the chroniclers because she was a woman, that she was castigated for actions which would have been acceptable in a man, and that she deserves a better reputation. I thought this would be the outcome of my research, but it's not. So, although I think I have portrayed her fairly, my assessment of her is going to be controversial.\n\nOne strand of research enabled me to establish the history of the burials of Adeliza of Louvain, because it's rare to find an accurate account. I've also put forward theories that Adeliza and Matilda of Boulogne were much younger than is often suggested, and I did a lot of research on Matilda of Scotland's life in the nunneries of Romsey and Wilton, the chronology of which is often confused. The trajectory of events following the Pope's ban of the marriage of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders in 1049 is often recounted differently, but I believe the version in the book is the likeliest scenario. I have also debunked a lot of myths!\n\nThe book is about the five Norman queens. The names Matilda and Maud were then interchangeable (I won't give all othe other variants!), so for clarity, where their lives overlap, I have chosen to name them as follows: Matilda of Flanders, Matilda of Scotland, Adeliza of Louvain, Matilda of Boulogne and the Empress Maud.\n\nFASCINATING FACTS\n\nThe Norman queens were sharers in the royal dominion. They exercised real power. They even led armies. Two of them waged a civil war so fierce that it was said that God and His saints slept.\n\nFrom a beating by an offended suitor to an escape from a castle, camouflaged against the snow, theirs are colourful stories set in a turbulent age.\n\nOne Queen kept the mighty Conqueror faithful; another made the decision not to sleep with her husband; a third deserted hers and refused to use his title. On was married to a king who sired twenty-five bastards. Welcome to the age of feisty royal marriages.\n\nTwo of the queens in this book may have been as young as twelve when were married.\n\nOf the ninety-three royal children born to fifteen of England's twenty medieval queens, twenty-seven died in childhood - nearly thirty percent.\n\nPower, passion and piety - they all characterise the Norman queens, whose bounty and faith helped to construct a landscape of castles, abbey and churches that still stand today.\n\nOne Norman Queen loved an English noblemen, but he spurned her. It is said she did not forget it...\n\nAnother Queen had been veiled as a nun, then left her cloister to be marry a king.\n\nTwo queens defied their formidable husbands, one taking the part of her renegade son, the other of a saintly archbishop.\n\nTwo queens, by their marriages, united the royal Saxon line to that of the Norman conquerors.\n\nOne Queen wore a hair cloth under her royal habit, and trod the churches barefoot. She washed the feet of the diseased, handling their ulcers dripping with corruption, and kissed the sores of lepers.\n\nThe Norman queens set the standard for later medieval queenship in England, buttheir successors would rarely enjoy such authority and influence.\n\nREAD MORE ON QUEENS OF THE CONQUEST:\n\nTudor history Queen turns her gaze on medieval matriarchs\n\nhttp://www.royalhistorygeeks.com/tudor-history-queen-turns-her-gaze-on-medieval-matriarchs/\n\nBBC History Magazine: Norman England's Warrior Queen\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/article/358860451/Norman-England-S-Warrior-Queen\n\nAlison Weir on Queens of the Conquest: England's Medieval Queens: interview with author Nancy Bilyeau\n\nhttp://nancybilyeau.blogspot.co.uk/2017/11/interview-with-alison-weir-on-queens-of.html\n\nHistory Extra: England's Norman queens and the power they wielded: an interview with Alison Weir\n\nhttp://www.historyextra.com/article/norman/norman-queens-england-power-alison-weir-matilda\n\nQuick Q&A with BBC History Magazine in advance of my event at the BBC History Weekend in York, November 2017\n\nWhat can audiences look forward to in your talk?\n\nA fast-paced account of the Norman queens of England, with new insights and an overview of Norman queenship that might surprise some.\n\nWhy are you so fascinated by this topic?\n\nI've always been fascinated by women's histories, especially those of royal women, who lived such rarefied, ritualised lives; and I love piecing together fragments of research to see what emerges - such being the nature of medieval biography.\n\nTell us something that might surprise or shock us about this area of history.\n\nThe power that queens wielded in this brutal, male-dominated world.\n\nWhat is the hardest question you’ve ever been asked about your area of expertise?\n\nWhen I was giving a talk on Eleanor of Aquitaine, someone asked me if I could expound on the education of Hildegarde of Bingen. The answer was, er, actually, no!\n\nIf you could go back in time to meet one historical figure, who would you choose and why? AND/OR If you could go back in time to witness one moment in history, what would you choose and why?\n\nI would like to meet Anne Boleyn (who wouldn't?), and ask her how she really felt about Henry VIII, and what was the truth behind her fall.\n\nWhat historical mystery would you most like to solve?\n\nThat of the Princes in the Tower. Most of the evidence points to Richard III being responsible, but I'd love to see something that left no room for doubt either way.\n\nWhat job do you think you would be doing now if you weren’t a historian/author?\n\nI'd run my historical tours full-time. Or I'd be a lady of leisure!"
