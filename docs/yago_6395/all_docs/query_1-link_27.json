        "text": "Stephen of England (c. 1096–25 October 1154) was King of England from 1135 until 1154. He became the King after the death of his uncle Henry I. Stephan was the King until his own death in Dover, Kent. Stephen was crowned at Westminster Abbey on the 26 December 1135. Stephen is buried at the Clunaic Monastery in Faversham, Kent.\n\nKing Stephen was born in Blois, France, in 1096. He was the son of Stephen, Count of Blois and Adela of Normandy. His mother, Adela, was the daughter of William I of England and Matilda of Flanders. Stephen married Matilda of Boulogne in about 1125. They had five children. He fought a civil war with Henry I's only daughter, Matilda, from 1139-1153. This ended with the Treaty of Wallingford in 1153 after the death of Stephen's son and heir, Eustace IV. The treaty said that Stephen would be King for the rest of his lifetime. After his death, the throne passed to Henry, son of Matilda, and not Stephen's other son William Died on 25 of October in 1154.))\n\nCaptured\n\nHe was captured after the Battle of Lincoln in April 1141, he was released later and returned to the throne.\n\nReferences\n\nImages for kids\n\nNorthern France around the time of Stephen's birth\n\nA contemporary depiction of Stephen's family tree, with his mother Adela at the top, and, left to right, William, Theobald and Stephen\n\nAn early 14th-century depiction of the White Ship sinking in 1120\n\nA 13th-century depiction of the coronation of Stephen, by Matthew Paris\n\nContemporary depiction of Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, with his bishop's staff and ring\n\n14th century depiction of Stephen with a hunting bird\n\nThe stone keep at Goodrich in Herefordshire, an example of the style of fortification slowly beginning to replace wooden motte and bailey castle design by the late 1130s\n\nA Henry of Northumbria silver penny, minted in his own name at Corbridge in Northumberland after his peace deal with Stephen\n\nStephen's Great Seal\n\nContemporary depiction of the Empress Matilda\n\nPolitical map of the Angevin and Welsh revolt in 1140; red indicates those areas under Stephen's control; blue – Angevin; grey – indigenous Welsh\n\nNear contemporary illustration of the Battle of Lincoln; Stephen (fourth from the right) is listening to Baldwin of Clare orating a battle speech (left).\n\nSt George's Tower at Oxford Castle, where Stephen almost captured the Empress Matilda\n\nGeoffrey of Anjou's invasion of Normandy, 1142–43\n\n14th-century depiction of Henry FitzEmpress and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine\n\nA 13th-century depiction of Bernard of Clairvaux, with whom Stephen argued over ecclesiastical policy\n\nA political map of Britain in 1153; red indicates those areas broadly under Stephen's control; blue – Angevin; grey – indigenous Welsh; cream – Ranulf of Chester and Robert of Leicester; green – David I of Scotland\n\nThe first page of the Peterborough element of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written around 1150, which details the events of Stephen's reign\n\nSee also"
