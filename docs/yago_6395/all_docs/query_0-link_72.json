Matilda was buried there in 1151, and their eldest son, Eustache, in 1153. The large retrochoir contained a relic of the Holy Cross presented to Stephen by Godfrey de Bouillon, and the royal tombs were probably installed beside it. There is no record of the tombs, which were most likely demolished following the surrender of the abbey in 1538. Leland makes no mention of them. Speed claims Stephen's remains were scattered following the Dissolution (of the monasteries), a claim repeated by Sanford. Later the abbey church was converted into stables and the other buildings demolished; only the gatehouse survives.\n\nKing Stephen and Faversham Abbey\n\nFaversham Abbey, located near the town of Faversham in Kent, was founded in 1148 by King Stephen and Queen Matilda. The site was just to the north-east of the town, about where the playing fields of the Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School are now. The aim of Stephen and Matilda was to found a mausoleum for the House of Blois. They hoped the dynasty would rule over England for generations to come. In fact it began and ended with them. King Stephen, in 1154, his wife, Matilda in 1152, and son Eustace, in 1153, were all buried in the abbey church. When the abbey was excavated in 1964, their empty graves were found close to the very centre of the quire. Their bones are said to have been thrown into Faversham Creek when the building was dismantled. However, in the nearby Faversham Parish Church of St. Mary of Charity is a canopy tomb with no contemporary inscription, where, it is said, their bones were re-interred. The abbey was dissolved in 1538 and subsequently most it demolished as part of Henry VIII's plans to sweep the monasteries from England. Much of the abbey building material was removed by military engineers and transported by sea to France, where it was used to strengthen the fortifications of the towns in the Pale of Calais, which at the time was England's continental bridgehead. https://web.archive.org/web/20160408031030/http://www.faversham.org/history/buildings/abbey.aspx\n\nTimeline\n\nc.1096: Born at Blois 1102Father dies at Battle of Ramlah in Jerusalem on crusade. 1106Arrives at court and shortly after acquires other lands in England, including honours of Eye and Lancaster; after 1120 a part of the honour of Eudo Dapifer. before 1115: Count of Mortain before 1125: m.
