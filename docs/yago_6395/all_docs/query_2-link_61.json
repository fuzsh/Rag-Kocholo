        "text": "From The Emperor’s Desk: I could not cover the entirety of King Stephen’s reign therefore this post will cover his succession to the English throne.\n\nStephen of Blois (1092 or 1096 – October 25, 1154) was King of England from December 22, 1135 to his death in 1154. He was Count of Boulogne jure uxoris from 1125 until 1147 and Duke of Normandy from 1135 until 1144.\n\nStephen’s father was Stephen II Henry, Count of Blois and Chartres, an important French nobleman and an active crusader who died when Stephen was at most ten years old.\n\nStephen’s mother, Adela, was the daughter of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. She was famous among her contemporaries for her piety and strong personality. Indeed, Adela was a major reason for Stephen II Henry’s return to the Levant. She had a strong formative influence on Stephen during his growing years; she would live to see her son take her father’s throne of England, but would die within a year after that.\n\nHis father died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother. Placed into the court of his uncle King Henry I of England, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands.\n\nKing Henry had only one other legitimate child, the future Empress Matilda, but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage. Shortly after the death of his son, the King took a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, but it became increasingly clear that he would not have another legitimate son, and he instead looked to Matilda as his intended heir.\n\nMatilda claimed the title of Holy Roman Empress through her marriage to Emperor Heinrich V, but her husband died in 1125, and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy.\n\nGeoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry’s domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the King’s personality and reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, the King arranged for Stephen to marry Matilda of Boulogne, inheriting additional estates in Kent and Boulogne that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen became Count of Boulogne by jure uxoris, by right of his wife.\n\nMatilda of Boulogne was the daughter of Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Her mother, Mary of Scotland, was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Margaret of Wessex, (also known as Saint Margaret of Scotland) the daughter of the English Prince Edward the Exile of Wessex and his wife Agatha. Matilda of Boulogne was also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England.\n\nAgatha, wife of Edward the Exile, is from unknown parentage. Her antecedents are unclear and the subject of much speculation and one of the unresolved questions of medieval genealogy.\n\nStephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I’s son, William Adelin (Ætheling), in the sinking of the White Ship in 1120; William’s death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge.\n\nWhen news began to spread of Henry I’s death on December 1, 1135 many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda’s supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.\n\nMany of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late King was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Stephen’s brother Theobald was further south still, in Blois.\n\nStephen, however, was in Boulogne, and when news reached him of Henry’s death he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless, Stephen probably reached his own estate on the edge of London by December 8th and over the next week he began to seize power in England.\n\nThe crowds in London traditionally claimed a right to elect the King, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return.\n\nHenry of Blois delivered the support of the church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, Bishop of Salisbury and Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen.\n\nOn December 15, Henry of Blois delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late king had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.\n\nFurthermore, the late king had only insisted on that oath to protect the stability of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late king’s royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen’s coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December 1135.\n\nMeanwhile, the Norman nobility gathered at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring Theobald II, Count of Blois and Count of Champagne as King of England, probably following the news that Stephen was gathering support in England.\n\nTheobald II was the son of Count Stephen II Henry of Blois and his wife Adela of Normandy (daughter of William the Conqueror), and the elder brother of King Stephen of England. Although he was the second son, Theobald was appointed above his older brother William the Simple, Count of Sully.\n\nWilliam, Count of Sully was the eldest legitimate grandson of William the Conqueror. He would thus have been the principal rival to King Henry I’s daughter Matilda to inherit the throne after Henry’s death. However, William was not considered as a candidate for the English crown. Several historians have taken the view that he was passed over because of mental deficiency; hence his soubriquet “William the Simple”. Though widely argued, this has never been clearly substantiated.\n\nThe Normans argued that Count Theobald II, as the more senior grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the Duchy of Normandy, and was certainly preferable to Matilda.\n\nTheobald met with the Norman barons and Robert of Gloucester at Lisieux on 21 December 21st. Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen’s coronation was to occur the next day."
