Near the beginning of the Civil War between Stephen and Empress Matilda, Stephen had just defeated a Scottish invasion and was faced with Matilda and her followers arriving in England and based themselves at Arundel. Stephen had a chance to bottle up and capture Matilda then, but for whatever reason, he let her escape to Bristol, and that kicked off The Anarchy in earnest. Had he been able to capture Matilda, there certainly would have been a war, but Stephen would have had an enormous bargaining chip and possibly could have forced Matilda to recognize him as King of England.\n\nAssuming war still breaks out, Stephen's son and designated heir Eustace of Boulogne, needs to survive. Perhaps with Matilda in custody, The Anarchy doesn't last as long as it did OTL, and Eustace died well towards the end of the war. His death really led to Stephen packing it in and recognizing Henry of Anjou as his heir while being allowed to remain king.\n\nSo Matilda gives up her claim to the throne and Eustace survives to succeed Stephen as King. However, the would-be Blois dynasty still has to deal with the very legitimate claim of Henry of Anjou, who would remain an extremely dangerous for for King Stephen (and subsequently, King Eustace), especially from all his Angevin holdings. Fortunately for the House of Blois, Eustace is married to Constance, sister of King Louis VII of France, so that's a potential ally for Eustace with which to further isolate Henry. In order for the Blois dynasty to really thrive, Henry has to be defeated and neutralized. If this doesn't happen, Louis VII ends up annulling his marriage with one Eleanor of Aquitaine.

Assuming the Blois/Capet alliance continues, then I have to imagine Henry tries to ally himself with the Holy Roman Emperor, who at this time would be the newly crowned Frederick Barbarossa, whose Swabian powerbase borders the French realm.\n\nThis feels like a giant powder keg.

An awfully fascinating and truly intriguing powder keg.\n\nIn all honesty, my knowledge on the subject is lacking, but the timeline would probably fairly uninteresting without some intrigue. I really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nHere are a few things that happen that create \"An English War of Succession\"\n\nStephen maintains England, He forces Matilda to give up her claims entirely\n\nStephen dies, Eustace becomes King. Eustace is now Count of Boulogne as well as King of England and Duke of Normandy.\n\nStephen's older brother William's line dies out, Eustace is now Count of Blois as well (This would improve the Blois odds a fair bit)\n\nEustace marries Constance of France, Louis and Eustace become allies\n\nHenry of Anjou is adamant not to lose his claim, Louis VII annuls marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine\n\nHenry marries Eleanor\n\nHenry makes a pact with Frederick Barbarossa to defeat the Blois-Capet Alliance\n\nI don't know what the timing between all of these events would be. Would it be logical for Frederick to want to have the Capets as vassals or just take over Burgundy?\n\nThese Angevins are going to be especially tough. Henry the Younger has a pair of very talented younger brothers in Richard and Geoffrey, and with fewer lands and more enemies, there may not be as much infighting between the brothers and the OG Henry of Anjou, as well as less of Eleanor playing her sons against her husband. They all need to be on the same page to survive here, even with the support of Frederick Barbarossa. They probably even bother to train John to be an actual warrior and let him look after some land.\n\nAround this time, I think Provence was considered a part of the HRE, so there's a pool of potential brides from there and any number of Imperial fiefs throughout Germany, Italy, Burgundy, and Bohemia. On top of all that, there going to have to be plenty of marriages to arrange for Henry's and Eleanor's daughters.\n\nAnother thing, especially as the new timeline proceeds and butterflies are abounding, this new political situation probably won't permit many of these guys to join the Third Crusade in late 12th Century, at least not anyone who's in charge of any of these states because the situation could explode into warfare at any sign of weakness. Assuming that following the Crusader defeat at Hattin still occurs in 1188, the presumed crowned heads here would be King Stephen II of England, Duke Henry of Aquitaine (the former Henry the Younger, who would now have full inheritance over Anjou and Aquitaine and may even try to make himself a king in these lands), King Philip II Augustus of France, and Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire. I doubt these 4 would go on Crusade, but guys like Richard, Geoffrey, and John would probably all go, especially John, the runt of the litter.\n\nThese Angevins are going to be especially tough.

I doubt these 4 would go on Crusade, but guys like Richard, Geoffrey, and John would probably all go, especially John, the runt of the litter.\n\nDouce II of Provence can marry a child of Eleanor...\n\nAdditional Events\n\nRichard of Anjou marries Constance of Brittany thereby making Brittany an Angevin fief\n\nGeoffery and John fight in the crusades. Geoffery dies while John distinguishes himself as a great warrior despite defeat at Hattin.\n\nJohn agitates for land and Henry marries him is to Douce II of Provence, thereby making Provence an Angevin fief\n\nFrederick I dies and Frederick II becomes Emperor and pledges to support his brother-in-law when Henry declares himself King of Aquitaine (Aquitaine, Brittany, Anjou, Provence, Normandy)\n\nHenry has a son, Frederick\n\nStephen has a son, Stephen,\n\nThe Capets are now reduced to ruling over a few counties and the Ile de France. Phillip II wants to change that\n\nThe Capets, Blois, and Toulouse make a deal that will split the Angevin lands among themselves\n\nNormandy is taken by the English\n\nRichard of Anjou pays homage to Philip and joins him\n\nJohn, Count of Provence decides to also bend the knee\n\nHenry the Younger and his court fled to Sicily\n\nAnjou and Aquitaine are now part of the French royal domain.\n\nThis leads to the second largest landowner in France being the English\n\nPhilip dies before having any heirs, the Blois now can claim the French throne as well\n\nI think Henry the Younger might want to claim the French throne as well. Richard would support him, but not John\n\nIf Frederick II dies early, Frederick of Anjou could inherit the HRE, Burgundy, and Sicily\n\nFrance could be split in the half between English and the Angevins possibly\n\nWhat should I represent the Coat of Arms of England to be? A Quartering of the Capetian Coat of Arms, Boulogne Coat of Arms, Blois Coat of Arms, and the Norman Coat of Arms. That would be cool\n\nAnd unfortunately highly anachronistic.\n\nThis is the period when arms settle down and become hereditary. They were likely either family or individual arms at this point.\n\nBlois is simplest and was likely the blues (Blois in canting) separated by the white stripe.\n\nCapet probably had yellow check on blue pattern, maybe sometimes skewed, with the king using fleurs instead.\n\nThe Normans probably just had red. Perhaps with a yellow personal sigil - Henry II seems to have had a yellow lion on red from his father's 6 yellow lions on blue. This is where the English and Norman and possible Aquitaine leopards/lions-passant-gardant come from.\n\nThe OTL Boulogne arms come from Mathias of Flanders and were the Alsace red on yellow colours. The discs being canting - Boules for Boulogne.\n\nCheck out the pedigrees on earlyblazon.com and that should highlight what I've said.\n\nSo whatever Steven uses, or his son, will likely become the English Arms. The centaur with bow is probably a later invention attributed to him.\n\nThis could possibly be a red version of the Blois family arms. See this image:"
