She was also wife of King Stephen of England and Queen of England.\n\nShe was born in Boulogne, France, the daughter of Eustace III, Count of Boulogne and his wife Mary of Scotland, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Matilda was first cousin of her husband's rival, Empress Matilda. Through her maternal grandmother, Matilda was descended from the pre-Conquest English kings.\n\nIn 1125, Matilda married Stephen of Blois, Count of Mortain, who possessed a large honour in England. When Matilda's father abdicated and retired to a monastery the same year, this was joined with Boulogne and the similarly large English honour Matilda inherited. On Eustace III's death, Matilda and her husband became joint rulers of Boulogne. Two children, a son and a daughter, were born to the Countess and Count of Boulogne during the reign of King Henry I, who had granted Stephen and Matilda a residence in London.[1] The son was named Baldwin, after Matilda's uncle, King Baldwin I of Jerusalem.[1] The daughter was named Matilda. Baldwin died in early childhood and the young Matilda is thought to have died during childhood too, although some scholars state that she lived long enough to be espoused to the count of Milan.[1]\n\nOn the death of Henry I of England in 1135, Stephen rushed to England, taking advantage of Boulogne's control of the closest seaports, and was crowned king, beating his rival, the Empress Matilda. Matilda was heavily pregnant at that time and crossed the Channel after giving birth to a son, Eustace, who would one day succeed her as Count of Boulogne. Matilda was crowned queen at Easter - 22 March 1136.[1]\n\nMatilda was a supporter of the Knights Templar. She founded Cressing Temple in 1137 and Temple Cowley in 1139.[2]\n\nIn the civil war that followed, known as the Anarchy, Matilda proved to be her husband's strongest supporter. When England was invaded, she called troups from Boulogne and its ally Flanders and besieged Dover Castle with success and then went north to Durham, where she made a treaty with David I of Scotland.[3]\n\nAfter Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln she rallied the king's partisans, and raised an army with the help of William of Ypres. Empress Matilda was besieging Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, but she, in turn, besieged the Empress, driving her away and capturing the Empress's brother, Robert of Gloucester.\n\nMatilda died of a fever at Hedingham Castle, Essex, England and is buried at Faversham Abbey, which was founded by her and her husband.[1]\n\nStephen and Matilda had three sons:\n\nEustace IV, Count of Boulogne\n\nBaldwin of Boulogne (d. before 1135)\n\nWilliam of Blois, Count of Mortain and Boulogne and Earl of Surrey\n\nThey also had two daughters:\n\nMatilda of Boulogne\n\nMarie of Boulogne\n\nNOTES:\n\n1 a b c d e Agnes Strickland, Elisabeth Strickland: Lives of the Queens of England\n\n2 Hilton, Lisa (2008).
