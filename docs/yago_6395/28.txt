Individual Note

Matilda I (or Maud) (1105?  3 May 1152) was suo jure Countess of Boulogne. She was also wife of King Stephen of England and Queen of England.

She was born in Boulogne, France, the daughter of Eustace III, Count of Boulogne and his wife Mary of Scotland, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Matilda was first cousin of her husband's rival, Empress Matilda. Through her maternal grandmother, Matilda was descended from the pre-Conquest English kings.

In 1125, Matilda married Stephen of Blois, Count of Mortain, who possessed a large honour in England. When Matilda's father abdicated and retired to a monastery the same year, this was joined with Boulogne and the similarly large English honour Matilda inherited. On Eustace III's death, Matilda and her husband became joint rulers of Boulogne. Two children, a son and a daughter, were born to the Countess and Count of Boulogne during the reign of King Henry I, who had granted Stephen and Matilda a residence in London.[1] The son was named Baldwin, after Matilda's uncle, King Baldwin I of Jerusalem.[1] The daughter was named Matilda. Baldwin died in early childhood and the young Matilda is thought to have died during childhood too, although some scholars state that she lived long enough to be espoused to the count of Milan.[1]

On the death of Henry I of England in 1135, Stephen rushed to England, taking advantage of Boulogne's control of the closest seaports, and was crowned king, beating his rival, the Empress Matilda. Matilda was heavily pregnant at that time and crossed the Channel after giving birth to a son, Eustace, who would one day succeed her as Count of Boulogne. Matilda was crowned queen at Easter - 22 March 1136.[1]

Matilda was a supporter of the Knights Templar. She founded Cressing Temple in 1137 and Temple Cowley in 1139.[2]

In the civil war that followed, known as the Anarchy, Matilda proved to be her husband's strongest supporter. When England was invaded, she called troups from Boulogne and its ally Flanders and besieged Dover Castle with success and then went north to Durham, where she made a treaty with David I of Scotland.[3]

After Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln she rallied the king's partisans, and raised an army with the help of William of Ypres. Empress Matilda was besieging Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, but she, in turn, besieged the Empress, driving her away and capturing the Empress's brother, Robert of Gloucester.

Matilda died of a fever at Hedingham Castle, Essex, England and is buried at Faversham Abbey, which was founded by her and her husband.[1]

Stephen and Matilda had three sons:

Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne

Baldwin of Boulogne (d. before 1135)

William of Blois, Count of Mortain and Boulogne and Earl of Surrey

They also had two daughters:

Matilda of Boulogne

Marie of Boulogne
