The coins in circulation are in denominations of 5, 10, and 25 centavos, as well as 1 and 5 córdobas.

This article explores the Nicaraguan córdoba, the national currency of Nicaragua. It delves into the history of the córdoba, including its establishment and subsequent transformations, alongside interesting facts about the currency.

Historical Journey of Nicaragua Currency

Over the years, Nicaragua has had a diverse range of currencies. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the indigenous people used cocoa beans as currency. However, when the Spanish arrived in Nicaragua in 1502, they brought their coins, and Nicaraguans began using them to buy and sell goods.

Even after the country permanently gained independence from Spain in 1838, the country lacked a national currency. The first currency that was officially introduced in Nicaragua was the peso moneda corriente, which was circulated by the Central American Republic.

In 1912, the Nicaraguan government created the National Bank of Nicaragua (Banco Nacional de Nicaragua Incorporado) and introduced the first córdoba, which replaced the peso moneda corriente.

The córdoba was named after Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, a Spanish conquistador who founded the first permanent settlement at Grenada on Lake Nicaragua.

During the Somoza regime, the córdoba was pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 1:1. However, after the Sandinista government came to power in 1979, the currency was devalued to 10 córdobas per US dollar.

In the 1980s, Nicaragua experienced hyperinflation, and the córdoba lost its value rapidly. In response, the government introduced a new currency, the “new córdoba,” in 1991, which was equivalent to 1,000 old córdobas.

Today, the córdoba is the official currency of Nicaragua and is subdivided into 100 centavos. The current exchange rate is approximately 1 US dollar to 34 Nicaraguan córdobas.

History of Coins

In 1912, Nicaragua introduced its first series of córdoba coins in various denominations, utilizing materials like bronze for the lowest values, cupro-nickel for intermediate ones, and silver for the higher denominations.

Over time, the materials and denominations evolved in response to economic conditions and policy changes. By 1939, cupro-nickel replaced silver for certain coins, and by the 1980s, new designs featuring Augusto César Sandino were introduced, with materials ranging from aluminum to nickel-clad steel.

The second córdoba saw no coin issuance, but the third córdoba oro, reintroduced in 1991, brought about denominations in modern materials like chrome-plated steel, nickel-clad steel, and later, brass-plated steel, reflecting ongoing adjustments to inflation and economic needs.

Various series over the years have commemorated significant national themes, with the most recent 2022 series incorporating materials like stainless steel for durability and anti-counterfeiting measures, maintaining a focus on national symbols and landmarks.

This progression demonstrates Nicaragua’s adaptive approach to its currency’s physical representation amidst changing economic landscapes.

History of Bills

The history of Nicaraguan banknotes spans several periods, starting in 1912 when the National Bank of Nicaragua introduced a range of denominations, including innovative overprinted notes for smaller values.

By the 1930s and 1940s, further denominations were introduced, including high-value notes during periods of economic change. In 1962, the Central Bank took over issuance, marking a shift to more durable and secure forms of currency, including the replacement of some notes with coins.

The introduction of the second córdoba was exclusive to banknotes, adapting to economic conditions with a variety of denominations. The third córdoba, or córdoba oro, introduced in 1991, continued this evolution with new denominations and the gradual replacement of lower-value notes with coins.

Throughout these changes, Nicaraguan banknotes have featured prominent national figures and landmarks, evolving in design and security features to include modern polymer materials and advanced anti-counterfeiting measures.

The most recent series, introduced between 2015 and 2019, includes polymer notes for durability and security, reflecting Nicaragua’s rich cultural heritage and historical milestones, such as the commemoration of poet Rubén Darío, while also addressing practical needs for secure and convenient high-value transactions.

Inflation and Buying Power of Nicaragua Currency

If you’re planning a trip to Nicaragua, it’s important to understand the current state of the country’s currency. The official currency of Nicaragua is the Nicaraguan córdoba (NIO).

As of February 2024, the inflation rate in Nicaragua is 5.79% Trading Economics. This means that the prices of goods and services are increasing at a rate of 5.79% per year, on average.

Inflation can have a significant impact on the buying power of the Nicaraguan córdoba. As the value of the currency decreases, it takes more córdobas to purchase the same amount of goods and services.

For example, if a cup of coffee costs 20 córdobas today and the inflation rate is 5.79%, next year that same cup of coffee would cost 21.16 córdobas.

To put this in perspective, let’s look at the historical inflation rate of the Nicaraguan córdoba. According to Inflation Calculator, the inflation rate in Nicaragua has averaged around 8.54% per year since 1970. This means that the buying power of the Nicaraguan córdoba has decreased significantly over time.

Despite the high inflation rate, the Nicaraguan córdoba remains a relatively stable currency. According to FocusEconomics, the exchange rate between the Nicaraguan córdoba and the US dollar has remained relatively stable in recent years. However, it’s important to keep in mind that exchange rates can fluctuate and impact the value of your money when traveling.

Overall, it’s important to be aware of the current inflation rate and exchange rate when planning a trip to Nicaragua. By keeping an eye on these factors, you can make informed decisions about how to budget and spend your money while traveling.
