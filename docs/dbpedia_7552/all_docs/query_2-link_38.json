        "text": "Country Listing\n\nNicaragua Table of Contents\n\nNicaragua\n\nCurrency\n\nFrom 1912 to 1988, the c�rdoba was the basic unit of currency. Relatively stable during most of that period, the value of the c�rdoba was pegged to the United States dollar. One of the last economic decisions by the Somoza administration was a devaluation in April 1979 of the c�rdoba from US$1 = 7C$ to US$1 = 10C$, a value it held until 1985.\n\nIn 1985 mounting economic problems, especially the imposition of the trade embargo by the United States, forced the Ortega administration to opt for a multitiered exchange rate, with one rate for petroleum imports, one for agricultural goods, one for capital goods, and another used at government exchange houses. Amid this confusion, a black market sprang up offering significantly more c�rdobas per dollar than any of the official government rates. As inflation increased from 1985 through 1988, the value of the c�rdoba plummeted, and by mid-1988 the government exchange houses offered US$1 = C$20,000, while a United States dollar on the black market fetched 60,000 c�rdobas.\n\nTo curb hyperinflation, the government introduced its economic shock program in February 1988. Currency stabilization was an integral part of this package, and a new currency, the new c�rdoba (C$n--for value, see Glossary), was introduced. Each new c�rdoba equaled 1,000 old c�rdobas, and the new currency's exchange rate was set at US$1 = 10 new c�rdobas. By the end of 1988, however, the rate at government exchange houses had dropped to US$1 = 920 new c�rdobas.\n\nDevaluation accelerated in 1989 and 1990. Immediately after the 1990 elections, the currency lost four-fifths of its value. By the end of 1990, it took 3.2 million new c�rdobas to buy a United States dollar on the black market. The government was unable to print money in large enough denominations to make simple transactions convenient.\n\nTo help control inflation, the Chamorro government introduced a third currency, the gold c�rdoba, in mid-1990. At first used only as an accounting device, this new currency was introduced gradually to the general populace, and for six months both currencies were legal tender, with a conversion rate of 5 million new c�rdobas to one gold c�rdoba. After April 31, 1991, the gold c�rdoba became the sole legal currency and was pegged to the United States dollar at a rate of US$1 = 5 gold c�rdobas, a rate it maintained throughout 1992. By July 1993, the exchange rate had slipped only slightly, to US$1 = 6.15 gold c�rdobas."
