        "text": "Currently the NIO is about US$0.0445. As for how it changes, I can't find that, and would be surprised if that is what happens - perhaps on the black-market as in somewhere like Uzbekistan where the rate is different from the official rate, but others may have some more information.\n\nhttp://www.currencyconverter.co.uk/currencies/nicaragua-cordobas090326155555 has a really good summary of the history of the currency, how to get it, including through the 'coyote' street money traders, what to watch out for, and how the evolution of the currency has caused massive inflation.\n\nYou can always check the National Central Bank for the exchange rate. \"Tipo de Cambio\" is the current value of a dollar in NIO. Of course there is always an unofficial exchange rate. But in Nicaragua the dollar is pretty common so most of the malls (Metrocentro, Galeria, Plaza Americas) have dollar prices but with local stores and markets (Oriental and Huembes) you would be better off carrying Cordobas (NIO)."
