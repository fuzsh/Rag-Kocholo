        "text": "About Nicaragua\n\nIn 1502, explorer Christopher Columbus became the first European known to have reached what is now Nicaragua, the largest country in Central America. In 1524, conquistador Francisco Hernández de Córdoba founded the first permanent Spanish settlement at Granada on Lake Nicaragua. In September 1821, after the dissolution of the Captaincy General of Guatemala (an administrative division of the Spanish Empire including present-day Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas), Nicaragua briefly became part of the First Mexican Empire, before joining the newly formed United Provinces of Central America (renamed the Federal Republic of Central America) in 1823. Nicaragua finally became an independent republic in 1838.\n\nCanada: Pure Gold And Colour Four- Coin Set Marks 60th Anniversary Of Iconic Canadian Flag\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mint release new gold and colour proof coins in celebration of one of the country's most treasured symbols of nationhood.\n\nNCBA Honors Outstanding Members At Annual Awards Ceremony\n\nNCBA recognized Gary Knaus, and groups of members from Wisconsin and Kentucky.\n\nRomania: New Silver Proof Coins Honour Internationally Renowned Architect George Matei Cantacuzino\n\nThe National Bank of Romania release new silver proof coins honouring one of the country's most internationally renowned architects.\n\nLegal Disclaimer\n\nThe prices listed in our database are intended to be used as an indication only.
