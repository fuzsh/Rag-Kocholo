        "text": "hat currency is used in Nicaragua and where do I get it?\n\nNicaragua uses the Cordoba. One American dollar is worth approximately 23 cordobas. Dollars are also readily acceptable in most places in Nicaragua. Be sure to have smaller denominations, ($10s or $20s) as most businesses will not accept large bills. It is also important to note that the local banks are very picky about the condition of dollars. Be sure that the dollars you bring are crisp and in near perfect shape. All Nicaraguan banks will exchange dollars for cordobas. Normal bank hours in Nicaragua are from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm. Be advised that there are many holidays in Nicaragua and banks will close for a few days at a time without much warning.\n\nThere are many ATM machines throughout Nicaragua and most businesses accept major credit cards.\n\n<< Back to FAQÂ´s"
