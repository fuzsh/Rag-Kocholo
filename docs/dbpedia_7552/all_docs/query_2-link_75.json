        "text": "Time Difference\n\nThe United Kingdom GMT is seven hours ahead of Nicaragua. Nicaragua currently observe Central Standard Time (CST) all year. DST is no longer in use and the clocks do not change.\n\nMoney\n\nThe US Dollar, either in cash or travellers’ cheques, is the only foreign currency freely exchangeable in Nicaragua and banks don’t exchange sterling. It is advisable to avoid using informal street money changers. Banks will however often have affiliated money changers outside the branch, which helps to avoid the long queues. These recognised money changers work bank hours and display identification, allowing you to withdraw cash in US dollars or local Cordobas from ATMs. Banks are open from 8.30am to 4pm Monday to Friday and from 8.30am to 11.30am on Saturday.\n\nElectricity\n\nThe voltage is 120 volts and the sockets are different from the UK meaning it’s necessary to bring a universal adapter and a transformer. There are two associated plug types, types A and B. Plug type A is the plug which has two flat parallel pins and plug type B is the plug which has two flat parallel pins and a grounding pin.\n\nShops and Amenities\n\nGenerally, merchants open from 8am until 5pm, Monday to Saturday. A few shops open on Sundays. Grocery stores are generally open Monday to Friday from 8am to 9pm and Sunday from 9am to noon.\n\nMedia\n\nThe main Nicaraguan newspaper is La Prensa, which is a daily publication. Another popular daily paper is El Nuevo Diario. Only 4 radios that transmit from Managua have national coverage: Radio Sandino, Radio Nicaragua, Radio Corporación and Radio Ya and there are 11 open television channels in Nicaragua.\n\nPost\n\nIn most towns there is a post office.\n\nPhone\n\nTo call United Kingdom from Nicaragua, dial: 00 - 44 - Area Code - Land Phone Number 00 - 44 - 10 Digit Mobile Number. Follow the dialling format shown above while calling United Kingdom from Nicaragua.\n\nInternet and Mobile Coverage\n\nThere are multiple internet service providers in Nicaragua, and they cover most of the country. The network in Nicaragua is good and largely considered stable enough to work remotely, as is the mobile coverage.\n\nCurrency\n\nNIO"
