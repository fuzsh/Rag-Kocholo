        "text": "Nicaragua currency is the Nicaraguan córdoba, which is abbreviated as NIO. The córdoba has been the country’s official currency since 1912 and is used for all transactions within Nicaragua.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN), is responsible for regulating the country’s monetary policy and issuing new banknotes and coins. The current banknotes in circulation are in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 córdobas. The coins in circulation are in denominations of 5, 10, and 25 centavos, as well as 1 and 5 córdobas.\n\nThis article explores the Nicaraguan córdoba, the national currency of Nicaragua. It delves into the history of the córdoba, including its establishment and subsequent transformations, alongside interesting facts about the currency.\n\nHistorical Journey of Nicaragua Currency\n\nOver the years, Nicaragua has had a diverse range of currencies. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the indigenous people used cocoa beans as currency. However, when the Spanish arrived in Nicaragua in 1502, they brought their coins, and Nicaraguans began using them to buy and sell goods.\n\nEven after the country permanently gained independence from Spain in 1838, the country lacked a national currency. The first currency that was officially introduced in Nicaragua was the peso moneda corriente, which was circulated by the Central American Republic.\n\nIn 1912, the Nicaraguan government created the National Bank of Nicaragua (Banco Nacional de Nicaragua Incorporado) and introduced the first córdoba, which replaced the peso moneda corriente.\n\nThe córdoba was named after Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, a Spanish conquistador who founded the first permanent settlement at Grenada on Lake Nicaragua.\n\nDuring the Somoza regime, the córdoba was pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 1:1. However, after the Sandinista government came to power in 1979, the currency was devalued to 10 córdobas per US dollar.\n\nIn the 1980s, Nicaragua experienced hyperinflation, and the córdoba lost its value rapidly. In response, the government introduced a new currency, the “new córdoba,” in 1991, which was equivalent to 1,000 old córdobas.\n\nToday, the córdoba is the official currency of Nicaragua and is subdivided into 100 centavos. The current exchange rate is approximately 1 US dollar to 34 Nicaraguan córdobas.\n\nHistory of Coins\n\nIn 1912, Nicaragua introduced its first series of córdoba coins in various denominations, utilizing materials like bronze for the lowest values, cupro-nickel for intermediate ones, and silver for the higher denominations.\n\nOver time, the materials and denominations evolved in response to economic conditions and policy changes. By 1939, cupro-nickel replaced silver for certain coins, and by the 1980s, new designs featuring Augusto César Sandino were introduced, with materials ranging from aluminum to nickel-clad steel.\n\nThe second córdoba saw no coin issuance, but the third córdoba oro, reintroduced in 1991, brought about denominations in modern materials like chrome-plated steel, nickel-clad steel, and later, brass-plated steel, reflecting ongoing adjustments to inflation and economic needs.\n\nVarious series over the years have commemorated significant national themes, with the most recent 2022 series incorporating materials like stainless steel for durability and anti-counterfeiting measures, maintaining a focus on national symbols and landmarks.\n\nThis progression demonstrates Nicaragua’s adaptive approach to its currency’s physical representation amidst changing economic landscapes.\n\nHistory of Bills\n\nThe history of Nicaraguan banknotes spans several periods, starting in 1912 when the National Bank of Nicaragua introduced a range of denominations, including innovative overprinted notes for smaller values.\n\nBy the 1930s and 1940s, further denominations were introduced, including high-value notes during periods of economic change. In 1962, the Central Bank took over issuance, marking a shift to more durable and secure forms of currency, including the replacement of some notes with coins.\n\nThe introduction of the second córdoba was exclusive to banknotes, adapting to economic conditions with a variety of denominations. The third córdoba, or córdoba oro, introduced in 1991, continued this evolution with new denominations and the gradual replacement of lower-value notes with coins.\n\nThroughout these changes, Nicaraguan banknotes have featured prominent national figures and landmarks, evolving in design and security features to include modern polymer materials and advanced anti-counterfeiting measures.\n\nThe most recent series, introduced between 2015 and 2019, includes polymer notes for durability and security, reflecting Nicaragua’s rich cultural heritage and historical milestones, such as the commemoration of poet Rubén Darío, while also addressing practical needs for secure and convenient high-value transactions.\n\nInflation and Buying Power of Nicaragua Currency\n\nIf you’re planning a trip to Nicaragua, it’s important to understand the current state of the country’s currency. The official currency of Nicaragua is the Nicaraguan córdoba (NIO).\n\nAs of February 2024, the inflation rate in Nicaragua is 5.79% Trading Economics. This means that the prices of goods and services are increasing at a rate of 5.79% per year, on average.\n\nInflation can have a significant impact on the buying power of the Nicaraguan córdoba. As the value of the currency decreases, it takes more córdobas to purchase the same amount of goods and services.\n\nFor example, if a cup of coffee costs 20 córdobas today and the inflation rate is 5.79%, next year that same cup of coffee would cost 21.16 córdobas.\n\nTo put this in perspective, let’s look at the historical inflation rate of the Nicaraguan córdoba. According to Inflation Calculator, the inflation rate in Nicaragua has averaged around 8.54% per year since 1970. This means that the buying power of the Nicaraguan córdoba has decreased significantly over time.\n\nDespite the high inflation rate, the Nicaraguan córdoba remains a relatively stable currency. According to FocusEconomics, the exchange rate between the Nicaraguan córdoba and the US dollar has remained relatively stable in recent years. However, it’s important to keep in mind that exchange rates can fluctuate and impact the value of your money when traveling.\n\nOverall, it’s important to be aware of the current inflation rate and exchange rate when planning a trip to Nicaragua. By keeping an eye on these factors, you can make informed decisions about how to budget and spend your money while traveling.\n\nNicaraguan Cordoba\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Nicaragua released a new series of banknotes, approved by a resolution on March 26, 2014. These notes feature iconic Nicaraguan landmarks and cultural symbols on both their obverse and reverse sides.\n\nThe series includes denominations from C$5 to C$1,000, with most notes printed on polymer for enhanced durability and security, except for the initial C$500 and C$1,000 notes which were initially issued on paper.\n\nC$5\n\nThe C$5 note showcases the Nicaraguan central bank building and Las Piedrecitas overpass.\n\nC$10\n\nThe C$10 note features Puerto Salvador Allende in Managua and La Vaquita, representing the Patron Saint festivities of Managua.\n\nC$20\n\nThe C$20 note highlights the Moravian church in Laguna de Perlas and the Mayo Ya Festival.\n\nC$50\n\nThe C$50 note depicts the Artisan Market in Masaya and a folkloristic ballet.\n\nC$100\n\nThe C$100 note displays the Cathedral of Granada and a horse cart.\n\nC$200\n\nThe C$200 note features the Rubén Darío National Theater in Managua and the El Güegüense comedy ballet.\n\nC$500\n\nThe C$500 note, initially issued on paper and later in polymer, features the Cathedral of León and the Momotombo Volcano.\n\nC$1,000\n\nLastly, the C$1,000 note, also initially issued on paper before a polymer version was released, showcases Hacienda San Jacinto, Tipitapa, and the Castle of the Immaculate Conception, Río San Juan, reflecting Nicaragua’s rich cultural heritage and natural beauty.\n\nCurrency Usage in Nicaragua\n\nNicaragua’s official currency is the Nicaraguan córdoba (NIO), which is divided into 100 centavos.

There are also coins available in denominations of C$0.10, C$0.25, C$0.50, C$1, and C$5.\n\nIs USD accepted in Nicaragua?\n\nYes, the US dollar (USD) is widely accepted in Nicaragua, especially in tourist areas and major cities. Many businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and shops, accept USD as payment, and some even prefer it over the local currency.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that you may receive change in córdoba, and the exchange rate may not always be in your favor.\n\nIt is recommended to carry both córdobas and USD when traveling to Nicaragua. ATMs are widely available, and most of them dispense both córdobas and USD. However, it is advisable to check with your bank about any foreign transaction fees or ATM withdrawal fees before traveling.\n\nWhile the official currency of Nicaragua is the córdoba, USD is widely accepted in the country.
