        "text": "In the bitterest days of the conflict between this country's former Sandinista leaders and American-backed rebels, all Nicaraguans shared one crucial piece of common ground: their reliance on the American dollar.\n\nAgainst a background of economic sanctions and hyperinflation, Sandinistas and contra supporters alike scrambled to convert their Nicaraguan cordobas to American currency. Sandinista leaders created an elaborate empire of official dollar-based stores and enterprises to help keep their cash-starved government afloat.\n\nNow, with the war years presumably behind it, Nicaragua's new Government is attempting to break free from the economic legacy of that chaotic era - not by breaking the country's addiction to the dollar, but by embracing it.\n\nGradual Introduction\n\nBacked by $900 million in foreign commitments to help shore up the country's foundering economy, economic advisers to President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro have inaugurated an entirely new, convertible hard currency that is to be pegged permanently to the value of the American dollar.\n\nThe new money, known as the gold cordoba, is being introduced gradually as a complete replacement for the current inflation-battered cordoba. Government officials say it is to be backed on a strict one-to-one basis with official dollar reserves, making it, in effect, a direct local substitute for the American bills that Nicaraguan black-marketers now wave at potential buyers on street corners throughout the country.\n\nIn contrast to the old cordoba, which does not circulate internationally and is thus considered a ''soft'' currency, the gold cordoba is to remain freely convertible with American dollars.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
