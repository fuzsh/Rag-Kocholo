        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to Nicaragua - or planning to move there to live, work or study - you’ve got an exciting time ahead. As the Nicaraguan Cordoba (NIO) is the official currency in Nicaragua you’ll need to find convenient ways to spend in NIO while you’re there.\n\nThis guide walks through how to use the Wise card in Nicaragua for convenient and secure transactions, and offers some handy hints about making your money go further when you’re abroad.\n\nCan I use the Wise card in Nicaragua?\n\nIf you are a resident of Australia and have a Wise card - or if you’re thinking of getting one - you’re probably wondering: can I use my Wise card to pay for things in Nicaragua?\n\nThe answer is yes, you can use the Wise card for everyday spending in Nicaragua. You can use the card to pay for things in Nicaraguan Cordobas with competitive exchange rates and low transaction fees. This guide walks through how you’ll be able to use your Wise card to help manage your travel spending.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wise card is not yet available for residents of Nicaragua. You may find that Revolut is a better option for residents; check whether Revolut is available below.\n\nSee alternatives to Wise\n\nWhat happens if I move to Nicaragua?\n\nYou can continue using your Wise card until it expires, but you will not be issued a new card as Wise does not offer the card in Nicaragua. You may be able to continue using other Wise services, such as money transfers.\n\nWhile your ATM card will work in Nicaragua it’s useful to know that cash is still the preferred payment method for many merchants.\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to use your card in smaller stores and restaurants, so carrying cash is essential.\n\nCarrying a low cost ATM card when you’re in Nicaragua is still a smart idea, so you can take out cash when you do find an ATM. You may also be able to use your card in larger hotels or restaurants, particularly in tourist areas.\n\nHowever, keeping some cash on you at all times, as well as your card or cards is a smart plan, so you’re prepared no matter what happens.\n\nThe Nicaraguan Cordoba (NIO) is the official currency in Nicaragua.\n\nYou can exchange your AUD before you leave Australia if you’d like - but bear in mind that you won’t be able to spend AUD in Nicaragua. If you arrive with cash in your pocket you’ll need to exchange it locally, which may come with unexpected costs, and take time out of your trip unnecessarily.\n\nA better plan for lots of people is to get a travel card for spending in NIO while in Nicaragua, with low costs and secure transactions."
