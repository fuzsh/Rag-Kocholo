        "text": "Money\n\nMoney\n\nNicaragua has its own currency: the córdoba. The US dollar is also virtually everywhere accepted. Often prices are based on dollars but quoted in córdobas. If you pay in dollars, you will receive your change in córdobas.\n\nPrices in córdobas are given using the letter 'c' and a dollar sign (for example, C$100). The ISO-4217 abbreviation for the Córdoba is NIO. Use the form below to convert córdobas to euros or dollars:\n\nC$\n\nFor real time currency exchange rates you can use the Oanda Currency Converter.\n\nCredit cards are accepted in most stores, hotels, and restaurants throughout the country (not in little towns and off-road destinations). You can get cash from the ATMs, located in banks and gas stations.\n\nThere are ATM machines in the following cities:\n\nChinandega – MC, V\n\nEstelí – V\n\nGranada – MC, V\n\nJinotega – MC\n\nJuigalpa – V\n\nLeón – MC, V\n\nManagua – MC, V\n\nMatagalpa – MC, V\n\nMasaya – MC, V\n\nRivas – MC, V\n\nSan Juan del Sur – MC\n\nV = Visa\n\nMC = MasterCard\n\nDid you find ATM machines in other cities? Let us know!\n\nAround the 15th and 30th of every month, banks are more crowded because people receive their paycheck on those days. Keep this in mind when you have to visit the bank. In general, the banking system in Nicaragua is old fashioned and slow. But if you only use the ATMs, you will not be bothered by this.\n\nCoins\n\nThere are coins for C$5 and C$1, as well as 50¢, 25¢, 10¢, and 5¢. Below are images of those coins. Click on a coin for a larger picture and more information.\n\nBanknotes\n\nThere are banknotes for C$500, C$100, C$50, C$20, C$10. Also available but rarely used are 25¢, 10¢, 5¢, and 1¢ banknotes. Below are images of those banknotes. For a larger image and additional information, click on one of the banknotes."
