        "text": "In this article, we’re discussing the best currency for Nicaragua tourists and visitors. Not surprisingly, the answer is the Nicaraguan córdoba.\n\nBut depending on where you are traveling to, this can change. In this article, we’re going to answer important questions about the córdoba and share suggestions on where to exchange funds at reasonable rates as a foreign tourist.\n\nThis article is part of our free series on opening a foreign currency account which you can access here.\n\nFeel free to use the table of contents to jump ahead to the sections most relevant to you.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCurrency for Nicaragua\n\nWhat’s the Best Way to Get Nicaraguan Cordoba in Nicaragua?\n\nHow to Transfer Money to Nicaragua?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nDo You Want Help Opening Bank Accounts?\n\nCurrency for Nicaragua\n\nThe currency for Nicaragua is the Nicaraguan córdoba with currency symbol C$ and ISO 4217 code NIO. Nicaraguan banknotes were first legalized in 1912, though they did not circulate until 1913.\n\nGetting córdobas in Nicaragua will require you to either exchange physical foreign currency in Nicaragua or withdraw directly from your foreign bank account. That said, choosing between ATMs in Nicaragua and Forex in Nicaragua often comes down to where you are traveling.\n\nWith this in mind, visitors are often encouraged to withdraw sufficient travel money for Nicaragua prior to leaving major cities and tourist destinations.\n\nOf course, finding the best currency conversion rates when exchanging money in Nicaragua can be a challenge. This is true both in terms of finding a reputable currency exchange in Nicaragua and securing the best currency conversion rates.\n\nWhile it is possible to visit currency exchange offices, currency conversion services at banks are often a suitable option to secure a reasonable USD to NIO exchange rate.\n\nWhat’s the Best Way to Get Nicaraguan Córdoba in Nicaragua?\n\nThe best way to get Nicaraguan córdoba in Nicaragua is to visit a commercial bank, foreign exchange counter, or withdraw córdobas directly from a bank ATM. It’s important to note that while ATMs are available in most cities and major tourist destinations, they will not be available throughout the country. So, if you plan to travel outside of major tourist destinations, you should consider withdrawing sufficient córdobas to support your travels.\n\nHow to Transfer Money to Nicaragua?\n\nIn order to send money to Nicaragua, individuals and businesses can choose from a wide range of options, including conventional transfer methods and more obscure options.\n\nNot surprisingly, the first option that most people consider is sending a bank transfer through the SWIFT network.\n\nSWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, which is a network of international banks that facilitate international transfers across the globe.\n\nThat said, there are a wide range of alternative transfer methods to choose from as well, including the following.\n\nOptions for Sending Money to Nicaragua\n\nInternational transfer services\n\nMoney order services\n\nPaypal or other peer-to-peer transfer services\n\nCryptocurrency transfers\n\nHere is a closer look at a few of the most popular options in great detail.\n\nInternational Transfer Services\n\nThere are a wide range of international transfer services to choose from when sending money to Nicaragua. In most cases, these services are delivered through digital platforms and mobile applications.\n\nIn addition to offering convenience, international transfer services are also one of the lowest cost options available. Additionally, if you choose to use one of the larger transfer services, your transfers will be secure with large licensed financial institutions.\n\nMoney Order Services\n\nInternational money orders are available in most countries. However, it’s important to note that they are often more expensive than some of the other options available.\n\nThat said, money orders are secure and offer an immediate solution to sending funds. When using a large money order service provider, you can also arrange for money to be picked up in cash or to have it deposited directly into a bank account.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Transfer Services\n\nPeer-to-peer transfer services are another option for sending money to Nicaragua. In fact, they are one of the fastest and most affordable ways to transfer funds.\n\nHowever, peer-to-peer transfer services do require both parties to have accounts with the same platform. Additionally, they can often be more challenging to fund and withdraw funds from than traditional bank accounts.\n\nHow to Choose a Method for Sending Money to Nicaragua?\n\nAs you can see, each of the options above have different pros and cons. So, it’s important to consider your specific objectives and situation when selecting a method to send money to Nicaragua.\n\nAdditionally, you should consider all of the options available. When doing so, consider the security, cost, and delay in your funds arriving to the intended recipient.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nBelow are three of the most common questions that we receive from people looking into the currency for Nicaragua. If you have further questions you would like answered, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us directly.\n\nWhat’s the Currency in Nicaragua?\n\nThe official currency in Nicaragua is the Nicaraguan córdoba with currency symbol C$ and ISO 4217 code NIO. The córdoba was first introduced in 1912 following the formation of the National Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) and Nicaragua’s monetary law. When introduced, the córdoba was near par with the United States dollar, which may have been influenced by the United States’ presence in the country at the time of introduction.\n\nHow Much is $100 US in Nicaragua?\n\nOver the last five years, the value of $100 US dollars in Nicaragua has ranged from a low of NIO 31.52 to a high of NIO 39.69. That said, in recent years, the value of $100 United States dollar in Nicaragua typically ranges between NIO 35.94 and NIO 37.00.\n\nWhat Is the Best Currency to Use in Nicaragua?\n\nThe best currency to use in Nicaragua is the Nicaraguan córdoba (NIO). The córdoba is the official currency of Nicaragua and the only currency widely accepted across the entire country. That said, it is possible to use United States dollars (USD) in certain parts of the country as well. However, USD acceptance is not universal. So, if you are traveling to areas of Nicaragua that are not heavily visited by tourists, you should always ensure you have sufficient NIO with you for your needs.\n\nDo You Want Help Opening Bank Accounts?\n\nIf so, you can access GlobalBanks Insider and start the process of applying for an offshore account in a few clicks.\n\nGlobalBanks Insider is a dedicated account opening solution that involves direct support from our team and direct introductions to the banks of your choosing.
