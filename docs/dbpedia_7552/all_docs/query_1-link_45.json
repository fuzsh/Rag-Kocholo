        "text": "I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance General. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but data quality can be improved in national accounts, fiscal, debt, and external sector statistics. Further efforts are needed to improve source data in the real sector, particularly for tourism, manufacturing, and retail; incorporate the results of the 2017/18 household survey in the national accounts; conclude and disseminate new series using 2019 as a benchmark; harmonize public sector debt with external sector debt data; monitor assets and liabilities of public enterprises; and improve coverage of FDI statistics. National Accounts. The BCN disseminates national accounts (NA) series in current values and chained volume indices with previous year weights based on 2006. As part of this dataset the annual accounts by institutional sector for 2005–18 are disseminated, in accordance with the recommendations of the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA), and most relevant recommendations of the 2008 SNA for which source data are available. Since December 2018, the economic surveys for national accounts and price indices are collected by the national statistical institute (INIDE). The BCN is finishing a project to update the national accounts benchmark to 2019, including continuing the implementation of the main recommendations of the 2008 SNA. Price and Labor Statistics. The consumer price index (CPI) uses expenditure weights derived from a 2006/07 household expenditure survey. The CPI covers Managua and eight other cities and is published monthly. Expenditures (weights) and prices in rural areas are excluded. From April 2017 to March 2018 a Household Income and Expenditure Survey was collected to update the period of reference of the current CPI, this survey covers only urban population. The producer price index (PPI) (July 2006=100) covers a sample of small and medium-size establishments, as well as goods for processing establishments in the maquila sector. There is also scope for expanding the coverage of the PPI to the service sector. Since September 2018, the price quotations and compilation of the CPI and PPI moved from the BCN to INIDE, but the technical validation of both indices remains as the BCN responsibility. As of December 2023, the CPI and the PPI are published by INIDE. Labor market statistics’ and unemployment figures’ availability and frequency have improved in recent years. Government Finance Statistics (GFS). The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) reports annual GFS to STA with the institutional coverage of the budgetary central government (BCG) and social security funds for the publication of the GFS Yearbook while compiling and disseminating fiscal statistics with a monthly frequency on its website with more comprehensive data coverage. Shortcomings of the data submitted to STA include lack of financing data (below the line) and its statistical discrepancy with nonfinancial data (above the line) for the BCG and limited institutional data coverage for extrabudgetary units (EBUs), local governments, and nonfinancial public corporations (NFPCs). The MHCP compiles and reports public sector debt statistics (PSDS) for the central government to the joint WB/IMF Quarterly Public Sector Debt Statistics database with the instrument coverage of debt securities and loans. Debt data can be improved by reconciling inconsistencies with external debt data, expanding both the instrument coverage to include other accounts payable and the institutional coverage to include nonfinancial public sector, applying the nominal valuation method for debt instruments and residency criteria according to international standards to adequately account for domestic and external debt securities. The MHCP would soon publish annual BCG GFS and PSDS data on the SECMCA website in the short term in line with the Central American GFS/PSDS regional harmonization implementation plan where their fiscal data tables need to be presented in the format based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014) instead of a national presentation. This expected publication will make Nicaragua be the last CAPTAC-DR member country to adhere to the regional implementation plan; pending tasks include to advance harmonization process, including timeliness, lack of high frequency data and limited public sector coverage. Monetary and Financial Statistics. The BCN reports monthly monetary statistics for the central bank, other depository corporations, and other financial corporations based on the standardized report forms. These accord with the concepts and definitions of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide 2016 (MFSMCG 2016). However, the lack of proper sectorization detract from the ability to accurately compile the net credit to central government and the rest of the nonfinancial public sector. The institutional coverage of other depository corporations currently includes commercial banks and finance companies. Data excludes most microfinance institutions and saving and loans cooperatives. Other financial corporations comprise the Banco Produzcamos, most microfinance institutions, insurance corporations, and depository warehouses. The BCN reports the 13 core financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and seven encouraged FSIs for deposit takers with a quarterly frequency. SIBOIF reports additional bank-level statistics. The BCN reports data on some indicators of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile and internet banking, mobile money, the two indicators (commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults and ATMs per 100,000 adults) adopted by the UN to monitor Target 8.10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). BCN does not report gender disaggregated data. External Sector Statistics. Balance of payments and international investment statistics follow the concepts and definitions set out in the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6), within the limits set by the availability of information sources. Data is available at least since 2005. Resident institutional units are defined in conformity with BPM6’s concepts of economic territory, residency, and center of economic interest, with free trade zones considered residents and included in the item for goods and services. However, the coverage of the private sector is incomplete for the current and financial accounts and there is difficulty in obtaining a higher level of information on the nonfinancial private debt and other assets and liabilities with nonresidents. Considerable advance has been made in implementing BPM6, but direct investment stocks are estimated accumulating transactions and there are still shortcomings challenges in recording some of the standard components of the direct investment position, due to lack of information. The large errors and omissions in the balance of payments represent a shortcoming for the assessment of the external sustainability and are due in part from uses related to data sources and quality of reporting; the persistent negative sign suggests that credit entries have been overstated or debit entries have been understated or omitted. An STA external sector statistics mission (November 2019) identified that data compilation was hampered in part by the lack of sanctions to companies that do not provide data or provide erroneous or incomplete information. Further, consideration could be given to enhancing the IT systems, the institutional arrangements and cross-sectoral collaboration for data-sharing as this would contribute to close data gaps, improve data consistencies, and facilitate data validation."
