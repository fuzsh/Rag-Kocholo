        "text": "Description\n\nThe Córdoba is the official currency in Nicaragua since 1912, replacing the “peso current currency”. The country had a period of monetary chaos that caused the inclusion of córdoba in 3 different stages, the last being after the 1990s. Coins were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos and 1 and 5 córdobas.\n\nThe 1 Córdoba coin front design features the National Coat of Arms (consists of an equilateral triangle of gold, a mountain range of five volcanoes, the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, a Phrygian cap, a rainbow of seven stripes and the legend in gold letters: “República de Nicaragua – América Central”. The reverse coin design has the denomination. This coin is part of the 2002 – 2014 series, its rim is fluted, and its color is silver.\n\nText: 1 Córdoba, Republica de Nicaragua, América Central, En Dios Confiamos, 2012."
