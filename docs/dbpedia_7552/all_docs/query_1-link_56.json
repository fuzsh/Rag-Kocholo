        "text": "Safety and security\n\nPolitical situation\n\nThe political situation is volatile in Nicaragua. The country has experienced periods of political unrest since April 2018, resulting in hundreds of deaths and detentions.\n\nSince the 2021 Presidential elections, Nicaraguan government officials and law enforcement have severely repressed those critical or opposed to government policies. According to UN reports, Nicaraguan authorities:\n\nundertake arbitrary arrests and detentions\n\ncensure media\n\nprevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land for political reasons\n\narbitrarily seize and search private property, including personal phones and computers for anti-government content\n\narbitrarily charge individuals with terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime offenses for political reasons\n\nIf you are in Nicaragua:\n\nrefrain from discussing the political situation in public or online\n\navoid all political activities\n\navoid posting information on social media\n\nThe ability of the Embassy of Canada to Nicaragua to provide consular assistance may be limited in some circumstances.\n\nCrime\n\nPetty crime\n\nPetty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs.

Assaults mostly take place in major cities but sometimes also in rural areas.\n\nForeigners are rarely targeted but you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nExpress kidnappings\n\nExpress kidnappings, where kidnappers demand small immediate ransoms, have occurred.\n\nKidnappers usually take the victim to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. The victim is sometimes held overnight for a second withdrawal the next day.\n\nCriminal taxi drivers sometimes use this ploy.\n\nOnly use reputable taxi companies\n\nAvoid hailing a taxi on the street\n\nIf you are threatened, do not resist\n\nDemonstrations and civil unrest\n\nDemonstrations and civil unrest may occur.\n\nNicaraguan law prohibits political activity by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations or promoting dissent, including on social media, may result in you being detained or deported.\n\nEven peaceful demonstrations, although infrequent, can turn violent at any time.

Except on the Pan-American Highway, driving conditions may be hazardous due to:\n\npotholes\n\ninadequate lighting\n\nnarrow or unpaved roads\n\nlack of guardrails\n\nlack of traffic signs\n\nunnamed streets\n\nroaming livestock\n\nRoad safety\n\nDrivers don’t always respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds. They may be aggressive and reckless. Drinking and driving is prevalent.\n\nVehicles are poorly maintained. Roadside assistance is not available. Cell phone coverage outside urban areas can be lacking, particularly in mountainous areas. If you drive in Nicaragua:\n\nalways drive defensively\n\nplan your trip ahead of time, especially if you plan to visit a rural area\n\navoid road travel at night\n\ntravel in convoys of at least two vehicles\n\nkeep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times\n\navoid picking up hitchhikers\n\ncarry a cell phone and a charger\n\nPublic transportation\n\nPublic transportation is unreliable and often overcrowded.

The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.\n\nWe have obtained the information on this page from the Nicaraguan authorities. It can, however, change at any time.\n\nVerify this information with the Foreign Representatives in Canada.\n\nPassport\n\nEntry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.\n\nBefore you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.\n\nRegular Canadian passport\n\nYour passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Nicaragua.\n\nPassport for official travel\n\nDifferent entry rules may apply.\n\nOfficial travel\n\nPassport with “X” gender identifier\n\nWhile the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries.

Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is required if you are coming from a countrywhere yellow fever occurs.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centre\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nThere is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication may be recommended depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\n• Cover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\n• Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\n• Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\n• Wear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nDengue\n\nIn this country,dengue is a risk to travellers. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue.\n\nZika virus\n\nZika virus is a risk in this country.\n\nZika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects.\n\nDuring your trip:\n\nPrevent mosquito bites at all times.\n\nUse condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact, particularly if you are pregnant.\n\nIf you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss the potential risks of travelling to this destination with your health care provider. You may choose to avoid or postpone travel.\n\nFor more information, see Zika virus: Pregnant or planning a pregnancy.\n\nAmerican trypanosomiasis\n\nAmerican trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) is a risk in this country. It is caused by a parasite spread by infected triatomine bugs. The infection can be inactive for decades, but humans can eventually develop complications causing disability and even death.\n\nRisk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from triatomine bugs, which are active at night, by using mosquito nets if staying in poorly-constructed housing. There is no vaccine available for Chagas disease.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nGood health care is limited, especially outside of Managua. Quality of care varies greatly throughout the country. Most healthcare workers are located on the Pacific coast region, and rather scarce in the centre and along the Caribbean coast regions.\n\nPublic hospitals and clinics remain below Canadian standards. Services are limited. They may lack of medical supplies and adequately trained professionals.\n\nPrivate facilities may be better equipped and provide better health care. They are mostly located in Managua and non-existent in rural areas. Services may be expensive and many institutions expect immediate cash payment.\n\nDoctors may not speak English.\n\nEmergency services are unreliable throughout the country. Ambulance services provide transportation and basic first aid only.\n\nYou might need medical evacuation in case of serious illness or injury.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nMedication\n\nSome prescription medication may not be available in Nicaragua.\n\nIf you take prescription medication, you’re responsible for determining their legality in the country.\n\nBring sufficient quantities of your medication with you\n\nAlways keep your medication in the original container\n\nPack your medication in your carry-on luggage\n\nCarry a copy of your prescriptions\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\nTransfer to a Canadian prison\n\nCanada and Nicaragua accede the Inter-American Convention on Serving Criminal Sentences abroad. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Nicaragua to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Nicaraguan authorities.
