        "text": "MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Beset by out-of-control inflation that has wracked the country's economy, Nicaragua Wednesday devalued its currency by 72 percent against the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe Central Bank, in announcing the fifth currency devaluation since a major monetary reform was announced in February, said the official exchange rate for the Cordoba, Nicaragua's currency, would be dropped from 320 Cordobas to the dollar to 550.\n\nReform measures put into effect earlier this year were aimed at halting inflation, but private economists say prices in Nicaragua are rising by 50 to 100 percent each month. Francisco Mayorga, a respected private economist, said the inflation rate for 1988 could reach a staggering 40,000 percent.\n\nThe announcement immediately triggered speculation that prices of imported goods would rise. Government supermarkets and other shops closed their doors and thousands of drivers jammed gas stations in the capital to try to fill their tanks before fuel prices rise.\n\nThe government gave no reason for Wednesday's devaluation, but economists said the move was necessary to reflect the spiralling inflation.\n\nThe official exchange rate is applied to all import and export transactions by the government and private business.\n\nThe government maintains a separate, 'parallel' exchange market for individuals with valid reason to purchase or sell dollars at rates of about 1,300 Corbodas to the dollar.\n\nBut the demand for stable foreign currency is so intense that one U.S. dollar will fetch as many as 1,600 Cordobas on the black market.\n\nThree months ago the parallel and black market rates for the dollar were a mere 400 Cordobas per dollar.\n\nGovernment officials said new economic guidelines adopted in June call for devaluations to maintain a realistic relationship between domestic and international prices.\n\nThe officials said damage caused by hurricane Joan, which killed 116 people and caused uncounted millions of dollars of damage to agriculture and the economy, would add to an already critical economic situation."
