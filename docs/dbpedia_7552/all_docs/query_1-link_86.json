        "text": "What do your blood pressure numbers mean?\n\nHigh blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can lead to serious health problems including heart attack or stroke. Measuring your blood pressure is the only way to know if you have it. Controlling high blood pressure can help prevent major health problems.\n\nHealthy and unhealthy blood pressure ranges\n\nBlood Pressure Chart BLOOD PRESSURE CATEGORY SYSTOLIC mm Hg (upper number) and/or DIASTOLIC mm Hg (lower number) NORMAL LESS THAN 120 and LESS THAN 80 ELEVATED 120 – 129 and LESS THAN 80 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION) STAGE 1 130 – 139 or 80 – 89 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION) STAGE 2 140 OR HIGHER or 90 OR HIGHER HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS (consult your doctor immediately) HIGHER THAN 180 and/or HIGHER THAN 120\n\nNote: Only a doctor or other medical professional can confirm a high blood pressure diagnosis. They also can check if your blood pressure is too low.\n\nDownload this chart\n\nEnglish PDF | JPEG\n\nSpanish PDF | JPEG\n\nTraditional Chinese PDF | JPEG\n\nLoading...\n\nKnow Your Numbers\n\nIs your blood pressure in a healthy range? The best way to know is to get it checked.\n\nThen, enter your numbers into this calculator to see which blood pressure category you are in.\n\nGet Started\n\nSystolic Pressure\n\nUsing your most recent blood pressure measurement, what is your systolic (upper) number?\n\n119 or lower\n\n120-129\n\n130-139\n\n140-179\n\n180 or higher\n\n1 of 2\n\nBack Next\n\nDiastolic Pressure\n\nUsing your most recent blood pressure measurement, what is your diastolic (lower) number?\n\nLess than 80\n\n80-89\n\n90-119\n\n120 or higher\n\n2 of 2\n\nBack\n\nNormal Blood Pressure\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nCongratulations! Your blood pressure is normal. Keep up the good work. Stick with these heart-healthy habits.\n\nElevated Blood Pressure\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nYou have elevated blood pressure. Unless steps are taken to control it, elevated blood pressure can turn into high blood pressure.\n\nWork with your health care team to get your blood pressure in the normal range. Lifestyle changes can help.\n\nHigh Blood Pressure Stage 1\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nYou have high blood pressure Stage 1. Your health care professional should prescribe lifestyle changes. They may add medication based on your risk of heart disease or stroke. Medication should also be added if you have conditions such as diabetes, heart failure and kidney disease.\n\nHigh Blood Pressure Stage 2\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nYou have high blood pressure Stage 2. Your health care professional should prescribe lifestyle changes and medication to lower your blood pressure. You may need one or more medications to keep your blood pressure in a healthy range.\n\nHypertensive Crisis\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nYou may be in hypertensive crisis.\n\nWait five minutes.\n\nTake your blood pressure again.\n\nIf your readings are still high, call your health care professional right away.\n\nCall 911 if your blood pressure is higher than 180/120 and you are having chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, numbness, weakness, change in vision or difficulty speaking.\n\nUh oh, it appears that there was a network issue.\n\nBack\n\nControlling blood pressure\n\nIf your blood pressure is in the normal range, stick with heart-healthy habits such as following a balanced diet and getting regular exercise.\n\nIf your blood pressure is elevated, work with your health care professional to control the condition.\n\nIn hypertension Stage 1, your health care professional is likely to prescribe lifestyle changes. They may consider adding medication based on your risk of heart disease or stroke and should add medication if you have other conditions such as diabetes, heart failure and kidney disease.\n\nIn hypertension Stage 2, your health care professional should prescribe blood pressure medication and lifestyle changes.\n\nIn hypertensive crisis, you need medical attention.\n\nWait five minutes after your first reading.\n\nTake your blood pressure again.\n\nIf your readings are still unusually high, contact your health care professional immediately.\n\nCall 911 if your blood pressure is higher than 180/120 and you are having:\n\nchest pain\n\nshortness of breath\n\nback pain\n\nnumbness\n\nweakness\n\nchange in vision\n\ndifficulty speaking\n\nYour blood pressure numbers and what they mean\n\nYour blood pressure is recorded as two numbers:\n\nSystolic blood pressure is the first number. It measures the pressure your blood is pushing against your artery walls when the heart beats.\n\nDiastolic blood pressure is the second number. It measures the pressure your blood is pushing against your artery walls while the heart muscle rests between beats.\n\nWhich number is more important?\n\nA higher systolic or diastolic reading may be used to diagnose high blood pressure. But the systolic blood pressure tells more about risk factors for heart disease for people over 50. As people get older, their systolic blood pressure usually goes up because:\n\nLarge arteries become stiffer\n\nThere is more plaque buildup over time\n\nHigher rates of heart and blood vessel diseases\n\nRead more about high blood pressure."
