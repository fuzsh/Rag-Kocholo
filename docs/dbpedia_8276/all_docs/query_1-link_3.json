        "text": "Scarlet Johansson\n\n-Woody Allen: \"Sheâs a total joy. Itâs like I hit the lottery or something. She simply has everything. She just lucked out in life; sheâs beautiful, sexy, very bright, funny, nice, quick-minded, easy to work with. Sheâs got range; dramatically powerful, and funny when you need her to be funny. There are certain people Iâve worked with over the years â Diane Keaton was one â who were just hit with the talent stick and had it all. And Scarlett has got it all. She lights up the set when she comes on; the crew loves her. Sheâs full of energy, and infuses the whole set with positive feeling all the time. Itâs a treat to work with her, and Iâm not just saying this as her costar; everyone in the company looked forward to working with her on the second picture after the first pictureâs experience.\" [4]\n\n-Woody Allen: \"Oh, [Scarlet Johansson] leaves me for dead. laughs I mean, sheâs one of those people that always â offstage or on â always tops me. No matter how good a line I come up with â when weâre putting each other down, teasing each other, whatever â she always nails me last, and best. Of course, that, to me, earns a lot of respect. Because I always think that Iâm quick and witty, and so when someone outguns me consistently, Iâm just amazed by it. But itâs true â and everyone on the set will tell you that.\" [4]\n\n-One of the movieâs biggest surprises is that Johansson and Allen actually have decent comic chemistry together. Johansson claimed their in-movie relationship mirrors the one they have in real life, which shines through in that they seem relaxed and comfortable, unlike many of Allenâs other recent female co-stars (Tea Leoni, Debra Messing, Helen Hunt, Charlize Theron) who were at times painfully awkward around him. [2]\n\n-Despite their compatibility, after working with Johansson on several films, Allen decided they should take a break: âI have every intention of working with her again, but I just didnât think it was a great idea for either one of us to work together too intensely, picture after picture. I didnât want her to be burdened by, âOh, sheâs in all the Woody Allen pictures, itâs so predictable,â and sheâs my new muse, and all that silliness.â Johansson does not share his opinion: âI donât think anythingâs played out. Iâm waiting for him to write my Citizen Kane.â [9]\n\nCritical Reception\n\n-Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"You may recall that the 1977 Oscar-winner \"Annie Hall\" was originally envisioned as a comic murder mystery, but Allen decided to concentrate on the romantic comedy instead. He resurrected some of the discarded \"Annie Hall\" stuff for \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" (also co-starring Diane Keaton) sixteen years later. \"Scoop\" feels like the leftovers from that, after they've been strained through \"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion.\" Does it mean anything anymore to describe a new Woody Allen movie as \"minor Woody Allen\"? He's been stuck in minor for so long, \"Match Point\" looked like major to some. \"Bullets Over Broadway\" was a delightful comedy, but in 1994 it seemed lightweight -- even compared to \"Love and Death.\" After the likes of \"Celebrity,\" \"Small Time Crooks,\" \"Jade Scorpion,\" \"Hollywood Ending\" and the aptly titled \"Anything Else,\" you wonder what Allen could possibly mean when he says \"Scoop\" will be his last comedy.\n\n-Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post called it the \"worst movie Woody Allen has ever made\": Basically the movie decodes into a Hardy Boys-level mystery. It's not, of course, that comedies must display documentary realism on this sort of thing. You forgive anything in a movie if it's funny. Scoop is never funny enough â except for the odd, whiny Allen gibe, mainly because it recalls better days â to achieve this dispensation; the lack of realism becomes a crippling attribute. This gives nobody, least of all me, any pleasure, but a truth must be faced: Scoop is the worst movie Woody Allen has ever made.[3]\n\n-At the other extreme, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, who also gave positive reviews to Allen's Melinda and Melinda, called it \"the funniest movie of the year so far\" and Allen's funniest film in a decade. He also said: Scoop has something Match Point didn't, something that none of Allen's films have had to quite this degree in 10 years. It's really, really funny. Not funny \"heh-heh\", but laugh-out-loud funny. Funny like you walk out wanting to tell your friends its best lines. Funny like you're walking down the street and remember a moment and start laughing like an idiot. Woody Allen has written himself an ideal role, creating a character and a situation that result in a continuous stream of winning bits. And he's paired himself with a partner in Scarlett Johansson who brings deftness and freshness to Allen's familiar comic universe.[3]\n\n-Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it \"not especially funny yet oddly appealing\": Mr. Allen doesnât seem to be working terribly hard in Scoop, and while that makes for some apparent goofs and lots of ragged edges, it gives the whole thing a pleasantly carefree vibe. After the first 20 or so clunky minutes, the film settles into a groove and then, ever so slightly, deepens. Mr. Allenâs invocation of the Thin Man films in an interview makes sense, even if heâs no William Powell and Ms. Johansson is certainly no Myrna Loy. Scoop was made by someone who understands that what makes the âThin Manâ series enduring isnât whodunit and why, but the way Nick and Nora look at each other as they sip their martinis, Asta nipping at their heels.[3]\n\n-Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called it \"fluffy, fatally implausible farce\": You can assume this kind of humor goes over well with the Europeans who are the director's financial backers and primary audience these days. Like Charlie Chaplin in his final years, Allen has found refuge in exile, far from the US audiences who have turned their backs on him (because we're lowbrow slobs or because his films have stopped being very good; your call). When we see him onstage as The Great Splendini, Allen even eerily resembles Chaplin in Limelight, shyly smiling out at the audience with the comedian's eternal hope of unconditional love. Does he see anything besides the beautiful young woman and himself? Sweet and woebegone, Scoop says no.[3]\n\n-\"Allen is like an addict to laziness and here he has had a relapse...Now it seems like Allen does movies, not from a genuine love of film but because he canât be retired. It is like the man has no hobbies and no friends to hang out with so doing something like Jade Scorpion is a better thing to do during the work week rather than sitting at home doing nothing. The ideas for his comedies lately have been rejected joke concepts that he keeps in a dresser drawer that he blows the dust off of. It doesnât help he makes cracks that he only does one take with actors because he would rather be at the Knicks game than doing this. [6]\n\n-Every Woody Allen Movie website critic Trevor Gilks wrote, \"In the late â70s and early â80s, Allen was as innovative and modern as any director, but he seems to have regressed with age. Scoop is more cluelessly, obliviously old-fashioned than any other â00s movie I can recall. If it had opened with a title card saying âLondon, 1965â that would have explained a few things. As it is, weâre left being asked to believe that a Brooklyn magician named Splendini would be selling out theatres in London in 2006 and that college journalists are out tracking down âscoopsâ in foreign cities with their pads of paper and pencils.\" [2]\n\n-Scoop has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 41% as of 2021."
