More...\n\nDVD Releases for November 21, 2006\n\nNovember 21st, 2006\n\nThe official start of the Christmas shopping season is just ahead and while this week is not as busy as last in terms of quantity, the quality is still very high with several contenders for DVD Pick of the Week. Narrowing it down to the short list gives us three films, An Inconvenient Truth - Buy from Amazon, Seinfeld - Season 7 - Buy from Amazon, and Star Trek The Animated Series - The Animated Adventures of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek - Buy from Amazon. And if I was forced to pick just one, it would have to be An Inconvenient Truth - Buy from Amazon. More...\n\nInternational Details - Box Office is Far From Dead\n\nNovember 19th, 2006\n\nDesu Noto 2, a.k.a., Death Note 2: The Last Name held on strong adding $5.12 million on 397 screens in 2 markets for a two week total of $20.85 million.

The film opened in a handful of markets including placing first in Mexico with $927,000 on 310 screens, but that's a little low for this type of film in that market.

More...\n\nInternational Details - Marching to the Top\n\nOctober 15th, 2006\n\nThe German Film, Deutschland. Ein Sommermarchen, which could translate into English as Germany, A Summer March, but I wouldn't bet money on it. ...

More...\n\nUnrated Unbeatable on the Per Theatre Charts\n\nSeptember 6th, 2006\n\nThis Film is Not Yet Rated started its run with a first place finish on the per theatre charts as it took in $30,664 in 2 theatres for an average of $15,332. The only other film to top $10,000 was Mutual Appreciation with $13,142 in its lone theatre. More...\n\nSun is Still Shining on Per Theatre Charts\n\nAugust 8th, 2006\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine saw its theatre count explode from 7 to 58 over the weekend and this obviously had a detrimental effect on its per theatre average. However, it held on as strong as one could expect and earned more than enough to win the race on the per theatre charts. In fact, its $25,521 was double to second place film. That film was the overall box office leader, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, which opened with just over $47 million in 3,803 theatres for an average of $12,370. The final film to top $10,000 was Quinceanera with an average of $11,925 in its 8 theatres.

More...\n\nMiami Finishes North of Caribbean\n\nJuly 31st, 2006\n\nFirst of all, I don't think there's enough geography humor in entertainment reporting, so I'm glad to help correct that with my headline. As for the box office, there were a few surprises this week, split evenly between the good and the bad. This did help push the overall box office down to $131 million over the weekend and that's down 13.2% from last weekend. But more importantly that was still 6.1% higher than the same weekend last year. Year-to-date 2006 has extended its lead to 5%, well above ticket price inflation meaning for the first time since 2002 we could see growth in that area. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for July 22 - July 28\n\nJuly 28th, 2006\n\nAnother big week for movie sites with several excellent entries. In this crowded field there were a lot of sites that showed promise and could be just one big update away from winning the award. But this week the best of the best was World Trade Center - Official Site. Let's hope that the movie can live up to the site. More...\n\nWill Pirates Finally Succumb to Vice?\n\nJuly 27th, 2006\n\nWe should have a new film atop the box office charts this week with Miami Vice the odds-on favorite to finish first. However, there are some questions regarding how well it, and the other two wide releases, will do. More...\n\n2006 Preview: July\n\nJuly 1st, 2006\n\nNeither of June's potential monster hits lived up to expectations, and that's a trend that everyone hopes doesn't continue into July. There is only one real monster hit in the making this month, and it opens right away. But while the rest of the month is decidedly weaker, there are still several other movies that should earn more than $100 million. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for June 10th - June 16th\n\nJune 16th, 2006\n\nThis is actually a pretty busy week with more than two-dozen site on the list. That makes it the busiest week in a month. However, it was one of the site that had no real updates this week that won the Weekly Website Award this week and it was, Nacho Libre - Official Site. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for June 3rd - June 9\n\nJune 9th, 2006\n\nIt was a slow week it terms of major updates and that allowed the Fanboy in me to grant The Transformers - Official Site the gloriously premature Weekly Website Award. Let's hope the full site lives up to this title. More..."
