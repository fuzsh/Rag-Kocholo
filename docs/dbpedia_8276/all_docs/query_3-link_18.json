        "text": "If you happen to fetch a ticket to a screening of (not your mother’s) Mean Girls this weekend and find yourself wondering where you’ve seen some of the actors before, the answer is… TV!\n\nThe big-screen adaptation of the Mean Girls Broadway musical is stacked with small-screen stars. And while the cast does include several fresh faces — like Tony Award nominee Jaquel Spivey, who’s making his screen debut as Damian — it’s also loaded with familiar ones that you’ve been watching for years. Or in some cases, decades.\n\nFrom live televised musicals to Emmy Award-winning sitcoms to one of the hottest teen dramas at the moment, this cast’s collective resume covers an insanely wide spectrum."
