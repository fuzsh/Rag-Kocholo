He drowned in Bartlett Lake in Arizona near his home Sunday afternoon. Authorities say divers will continue searching the lake for his body on Monday.

The following statement was released by the Castillo family to KVIA on Monday:

Frank Castillo died on Sunday in a drowning accident while with his family at a lake near his home. Frank was a wonderful son, terrific brother, and an extraordinary father to his two beautiful girls.

Everyone who knew Frank loved Frank. We are devastated by this loss.

It is impossible to express in words the level of sadness we feel due to this tragedy.

All of those who counted Frank as a personal friend, and to all those wonderful fans who cheered for him during his major league career, we genuinely appreciate your prayers and kind words during this extremely difficult time.

While we may not be able to thank each of you in person, it is very comforting to know that you are with us in spirit.
