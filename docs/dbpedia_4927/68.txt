In the wake of yesterday's shocking news about the death of former Red Sox first baseman George Scott, it was announced today that Frank Castillo—who pitched for Boston from 2001-2004—also passed away yesterday at age 44. Castillo perished in a drowning accident on a lake in Arizona. Castillo pitched in 64 games for Boston (mostly as a starter), compiling a 4.66 ERA. Although he did not contribute much during their first championship season in 86 years (only one inning pitched), Castillo did receive a 2004 World Series ring. RIP.
