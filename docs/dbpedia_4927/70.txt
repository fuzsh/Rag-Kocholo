Retired major league pitcher Frank Castillo died after going for a swim in Arizona's Bartlett Lake near his home Sunday afternoon. He was 44.

Castillo's family confirmed his passing Monday in a statement to El Paso, Texas, TV station KVIA.

"Frank Castillo died on Sunday in a drowning accident while with his family at a lake near his home. Frank was a wonderful son, terrific brother, and an extraordinary father to his two beautiful girls.

"Everyone who knew Frank loved Frank. We are devastated by this loss."

Castillo was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1987, beginning his major league career in 1991. He also played for the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers and Florida Marlins between 1991 and 2005.

Over his 13-year career, Castillo went 82-104 with a 4.56 ERA in 297 career games.
