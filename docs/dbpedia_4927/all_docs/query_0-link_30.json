        "text": "Arizona resumed executions in May 2022 when it carried out the lethal injection of Clarence Dixon. Dixon was the first person put to death by Arizona since the botched execution of Joseph Wood in 2014.\n\nFollowing the Wood execution, Arizona changed its lethal injection protocol to a single drug: pentobarbital. The state announced in 2021 that it had found a supply of that drug and a pharmacist who could compound it into an injectable form. But questions over the expiration date of the drugs pushed back the state’s pursuit of the death penalty to 2022.\n\nThe next man put to death by Arizona after Dixon was Frank Atwood in June 2022.\n\nMurray Hooper was executed on Nov. 16, 2022.\n\nThere are more than 100 prisoners on Arizona’s death row.
