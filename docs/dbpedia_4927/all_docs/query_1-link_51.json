        "text": "Author:\n\nNo name\n\n[ Edit | View ] Date Posted: 13:02:00 08/21/24 Wed\n\n(NoHost/12.233.34.186)\n\nORK, Pa. (WHP)  It's a competition that has been going on since the 1920's, and just days before this year's Miss Pennsylvania pageant was set to begin, one contestant is dropping out.\n\nFormer Miss Susquehanna Valley Robyn Kass-Gerji announced she was hanging up the crown out of fears for her safety, throwing away what would have been her last chance to earn scholarship money and the coveted Miss Pennsylvania crown.\n\nShe made the announcement on social media just a few days before the pageant was set to start on Thursday at the Appell Center in York.\n\nKass-Gerji says she's been the subject of death threats and bullying for the past several months, at the hands of a fellow Miss Pennsylvania contestant who is also competing for the Miss Pennsylvania crown.\n\nKass-Gerji shared just some of the texts with CBS 21 News, hundreds sent from a phone number that was connected with a fellow contestant. That person has not been charged with a crime, and that is why we're not releasing their name.\n\nThe threats were directed to Kass-Gerji, her loved ones and even her pets.\n\nI can't wait to see the life leave your eyes as I crush your whole world. You will kill yourself or I will kill you.\n\nAnother read, \"I will come to D.C. and set your house on fire and watch you scream as your dogs die. It will be so funny.\" That is one of just a few of the texts, others used explicit language and Kassgerji said others threatened to kill her boyfriend and her mother.\n\nKass-Gerji also claims the same person also threatened her in person.\n\n\"It happened at the Miss Pennsylvania orientation actually. It was a very quick incident. I was going into the bathroom as she was coming out and she whispered, \"I will get rid of you, I will punch you and she just kept walking and I just kind of stood there,\" Kassgerji said.\n\nKass-Gerji has been performing in pageants for years. Competing for the crown, and she says it was to avoid behavior like this.\"I was getting bullied in really badly high school and my mom said to put me back in the pageants to help with my self confidence.\"\n\nThe two women eventually went to court. Kass-Gerji was granted an anti-stalking order in a Washington, D.C. court. It states, \"the respondent shall stay at least 100 yards away from petitioners person, home, workplace, vehicle, animals, and loved ones.\" However, it did include a carve out for pageants, where it says the two must be separated by 20 feet.\n\nKass-Gerji said leading up to the pageant she didn't receive any specific plans from the Miss Pennsylvania Scholarship Foundation about how the security would be handled during the pageant, and the events that were scheduled to take place leading up to it. Which is why she made the announcement to relinquish her Miss Susquehanna Valley crown.\n\n\"I didn't want to, but ultimately it was the best decision for the safety of myself and my loved ones,\" Kassgerji said.\n\nMISS PENNSYLVANIA SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION RESPONDS\n\nThe Miss Pennsylvania Scholarship Foundation responded to those allegations in a two page statement sent to CBS 21 News.\n\nThe organization said it had put together a detailed safety plan for the upcoming pageant. Writing, \"we engaged additional security services from an external local company to help us ensure that this week's activities happen according to plan, and we can create a positive and memorable experience for all involved with our program.\"\n\nThe organization said the York City Police were also notified of the anti-stalking order, and the organization wrote that plans were put in place to keep the two contestants separated. They said that was in addition to security provided at the event venue.\n\nThe Miss Pennsylvania Scholarship Foundation also said that it told Kass-Gerji the specifics of the plan, but she says that did not happen, and that's part of the reason why she decided to take off the crown.\n\n\"Unfortunately, my time with the organization is up, but I am not the only one that this is happening to and I want them to take a stand against this and let the other victims that are currently competing know that there are options for them and that by coming forward isn't going to bring some kind of retribution on them by Miss America,\" Kass-Gerji said.\n\nThe Miss Pennsylvania Scholarship Foundation said it believes there is another reason why Kass-Gerji may have resigned.\n\nUpon further investigation, it was discovered that the petitioner appears to be registered to vote in Washington D.C., she has a car registered in Washington D.C. and she has worked there since 2023. She also appears to be listed as a current candidate for a competing pageant in Washington D.C., which is a separate violation of her contract. Prior to moving to Washington D.C., she apparently lived in Alaska, where she competed in the Miss Alaska pageant previously. Additionally, it was discovered that she never provided a copy of her current drivers license or other required documents to confirm her residency when she turned in her contract.\n\nAs a result of this new information, the organization asked the petitioner to provide a copy of her current drivers license to confirm that her actual residence was in Pennsylvania. In lieu of providing this documentation, the petitioner withdrew from the pageant, citing safety concerns despite having the Anti-Stalking Order in place, and being provided with the detailed security plan, referenced herein.\n\nKass-Gerji admitted to CBS 21 she has a Washington, D.C. drivers license. She says she spends 50% of the year in D.C. where she has a job, and the other half of the year in the Pittsburgh area.\n\n\"I own a house in Pennsylvania, spend 50% of my time here, I pay taxes here and had my eligibility been up for question, why didn't they ask that when I was crowned,\" Kass-Gerji said.\n\nThe foundation also wrote in it's statement that it could take legal action against Kass-Gerji but called it an avenue of last resort. Kass-Gerji said if that were to happen she would be prepared.\n\nShe says the foundation is putting the spotlight on the wrong issue, \"There's still seven girls competing this week that are absolutely terrified of this person and of what the organization will do if they come forward.\"\n\nBoth sides say empowering women is their goal. The Miss Pennsylvania Scholarship Foundation wrote: \"Our organization remains committed to our mission of empowering young women as well as raising awareness on a variety of social issues. This includes supporting the petitioners goal to raise awareness against human trafficking, sexual abuse and domestic violence.\"\n\nHowever, moving forward Kass-Gerji says,\"if you are truly an organization that is supposed to empower and uplift women, don't allow bullying, harassment and death threats in your organization.\"\n\n[ Post a Reply to This Message ]\n\nAuthor:\n\nNo name\n\n[ Edit | View ] Date Posted: 12:52:35 08/21/24 Wed\n\n(NoHost/12.233.34.186)\n\nAir Force 2nd Lt. Madison Marsh made big plans for herself when she was young, although she never really factored becoming Miss America into that equation. However, after a tough competition in January, Marsh became the first active-duty service member to earn the crown. The 22-year-old U.S. Air Force Academy graduate is now learning to navigate life as a military member, a cancer research scholar and a public figure.\n\nAn Early Eye on the Sky\n\nGrowing up, Marsh wanted to be a pilot and an astronaut, so she attended NASA's Space Camp at age 13. When she learned that she could further her ambitions by going to the Air Force Academy, she started working toward becoming a cadet, even earning her civilian pilot's license at 17 years old.\n\nIn 2018, Marsh lost her mother, Whitney, to pancreatic cancer. In her honor, the family started the Whitney Marsh Foundation, which raises funds for research and awareness to increase patients' chances of early detection. Marsh took on the role of co-founder and president.\n\nThe following year, Marsh made it to the Air Force Academy, but she initially had bouts of homesickness.\n\n\"I was struggling  being removed from my family, grieving my mom, and now I'm in a really tough military environment,\" she said, thinking back on her freshman year. That's when she was inspired by her cousin, who was a pageant contestant, to give pageantry a try. \"I decided to take a stab at pageants to see all the different ways that it could help me.\"\n\nHighlighting Similar Values\n\nThere are a lot of stereotypes regarding beauty pageants and the people involved in them, but Marsh said there are actually a lot of overlapping core values that pageants and the military share.\n\n\"I realized pageants have always been about community service, leadership, resume building and public speaking, and I think that is what made me be able to be successful in the Air Force,\" she said.\n\nAfter a lot of studying and several internships, including with NASA, Marsh graduated from the Air Force Academy in the spring of 2023 with a degree in physics. Upon her commissioning, she received a pilot's billet. But soon after, she was crowned Miss Colorado, and her career trajectory started to change.\n\nIn September, Marsh decided to defer her pilot training to pursue a master's degree in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School  an option made possible through the Air Force Institute of Technology's Civilian Institution Programs. She's also a graduate intern at Harvard Medical School and is working with experts from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute on early cancer detection research  continuing her work for the foundation dedicated to her mom.\n\nIn January, Marsh won the title of Miss America during the national pageant in Orlando, Florida. Between her Air Force commitment, her studies and now these public-facing duties, she's got a lot to juggle. Thankfully, the Air Force has rolled with her change of fortune and put her into a public affairs/recruiting position for the year that she is Miss America.\n\n\"The Air Force has been really, really wonderful with me,\" Marsh said during a USO event she attended on Capitol Hill in February. \"Basically, anytime I go and do Miss America events, I'm also giving back to the Air Force to ensure people know about the message of what it means to serve as 2nd Lt. Marsh  the different ways that they can get involved in the military, whether it be in the Air Force or other branches or different jobs.\"\n\nHonoring Her Mother\n\nAs far as her Harvard research goes, Marsh said she's still working with her advisor and is excited about the possibility of bringing potential legislation related to their research to Capitol Hill over the next year.\n\n\"Now I understand the science side and [how to ask] medical professionals, 'What do you think needs to be done for patients, and how can we get that done through legislation?' Because through Harvard, even though I only got to do one semester there, I have learned that it is really easy to make bad policy,\" Marsh said. \"I think the best way to making good policy is by intimately understanding from the source  with patients  and intimately understanding that scientifically so we're enacting it properly. Now that I have all of those communities able to give me that knowledge, I'm really excited to get to use that piece to come forward here on the Hill and maybe get some things done.\"\n\nDozens of people line up at a starting line for a foot race.\n\nShe said it's also a blessing for her to be able to share her mother's story on such a large stage.\n\n\"Losing her when she was 41 to pancreatic cancer  I want people to know her story. I want them to know the signs, the ways to get help because I don't think we do enough for pancreatic cancer,\" Marsh said. \"My mom was misdiagnosed when we had no cancer history in our family. She was healthy. She didn't have any of those warning signs, and she still passed away. We need to do more for our patients, and being able to have a national platform and a voice now to work with people is so important. I can't think of a better way to [showcase] the legacy of my mom.\"\n\nDispelling Misconceptions About Pageantry & Service\n\nAs the first active-duty service member to earn the Miss America crown, Marsh's national platform may help dispel the lingering assumption that military roles are too masculine for the average woman. Marsh said young women can make any position their own.\n\n\"I hope that women are able to see that they can define their own role in the military  whether they want to take it in the more feminine path or not  knowing that they are empowered to make that decision,\" Marsh said. \"I hope young girls can see that you can lead in the military, or you can lead in a board room, in the courthouse, in medical boardrooms  whatever it might be  and you can be taken seriously. Whether I'm in a crown and sash or whether I'm in my uniform, I serve as 2nd Lt. Marsh and I serve as Miss America simultaneously, and they do not take away from one another.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Miss America, there are several phases of competition: the public and private interviews, the talent portion, the evening gown and fitness competitions, as well as the social impact pitch. Between military fitness requirements and her work with the Whitney Marsh Foundation, the latter two weren't a problem for Marsh. For her, she said the hardest part was talent.\n\n[ Post a Reply to This Message ]"
