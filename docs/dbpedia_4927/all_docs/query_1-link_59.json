        "text": "Mapping Police Violence collected data on more than 1,200 killings by police in 2023. We compiled this information from media reports, obituaries, public records, and databases like The Gun Violence Archive and the Washington Post. As such, this report represents the most comprehensive public accounting of deadly police violence in 2023. Our analysis suggests a substantial proportion of all killings by police in 2023 could have been prevented and that specific policies and practices might prevent police killings in the future.\n\nScroll to explore the findings.\n\nAt least people were killed by police in 2023.\n\nMore people were killed by police in 2023 than any other year in the past decade.\n\nNew Mexico had theÂ highest rate of killings by policeÂ of any state in 2023. Over the past decade, New Mexico has consistently had one of the highest rates of police violence in the nation.\n\nof people killed by police in 2023 were killed by police shootings. Tasers, physical force, and police vehicles accounted for most other deaths.\n\nOfficers were charged with a crime in only of these cases. One percent of all killings by police.\n\nEach year, fewer than 3% of killings by police result in officers being charged with a crime. Officers are disproportionately prosecuted by Black prosecutors â especially Black women. Representing only 1% of the nationâs elected prosecutors, Black women were 8% of prosecutors who charged officers for killing someone, 11% of prosecutors convicting officers and 17% of prosecutors charging officers in two or more deadly force incidents from 2013-2023.\n\nWhite Male\n\nWhite Female\n\nBlack Male\n\nBlack Female\n\nHispanic Male\n\nHispanic Female\n\nAsian Male\n\nAsian Female\n\nOther\n\nWe were able to identify officers in cases. At least had shot or killed someone before.\n\nOfficers identified ( )\n\nOfficers with one prior shooting ( )\n\nOfficers not reported/unable to be identified ( )\n\nMost killings began with police responding to suspected non-violent offenses or cases where no crime was reported. people were killed after police stopped them for a traffic violation.\n\nSuspected non-violent offense or no reported crime ()\n\nTraffic violation ( )\n\nUnknown ( )\n\nIn 2023, the Investing in Safer Traffic Stops Act was introduced in Congress. TheÂ billÂ would create a $100 million fund to invest in non-police alternatives to traffic enforcement, like hiring civilians or using automated traffic enforcement technology instead.\n\nWhile promising, efforts to implement automated enforcement systems can present their own challenges. For example,Â researchÂ on automated traffic enforcement in Washington, DC found that drivers in predominantly Black communities were significantly more likely to be fined for moving violations than drivers in white communities despite not experiencing a greater number of crashes. As such, automation couldÂ increaseÂ racial disparities in traffic enforcement unless these programs are implemented with an âaffirmative effort to equitably site automated traffic cameras.â\n\npeople were killed after police responded to reports of someone behaving erratically or having a mental health crisis.\n\nMental Health/Welfare Check ( )\n\nTraffic Stop ( )\n\nDomestic Disturbance ( )\n\nOther Non-Violent Offense ( )\n\nPerson with a Weapon ( )\n\nOther Crimes Against People ( )\n\nViolent Crime ( )\n\nNone/Unknown ( )\n\nThe State of California began implementing the CRISES Act in 2023, beginning to fund and scale up community-based alternative responses to mental health crises. The law prioritizes funding for communities with the highest rates of police violence and misconduct in the state, protecting residents from violent police responses to mental health crises.\n\npeople killed by police were unarmed.\n\nUnarmed ( )\n\nVehicle ( )\n\nKnife/sharp object ( )\n\nOther object ( )\n\nGun ( )\n\nUndetermined ( )\n\nMost unarmed people killed by police were people of color.\n\nBlack ( )\n\nHispanic ( )\n\nAsian/Pacific Islander ( )\n\nWhite ( )\n\nUnknown ( )\n\nBlack people were more likely to be killed by police, more likely to be unarmed and less likely to be threatening someone when killed.\n\nBlack\n\nHispanic\n\nWhite\n\nOther / Unknown\n\nPolice disproportionately kill Black people, year after year.\n\nBlack\n\nHispanic\n\nWhite\n\nOther / Unknown\n\npeople killed by police had a vehicle as a weapon.\n\nUnarmed ( )\n\nVehicle ( )\n\nKnife/sharp object ( )\n\nOther object ( )\n\nGun ( )\n\nUndetermined ( )\n\nof these people were killed when police shot at a moving vehicle, a practice many experts say should be banned.\n\nVehicle, Killed by Police Shooting ( )\n\nKilled by Police Vehicle ( )\n\nExperts, law enforcement groups, and the US Department of Justice recommend that police be banned from shooting at people in moving vehicles. These shootings are particularly ineffective and dangerous, since shooting the driver can make the vehicle an uncontrollable threat to both officers and the public.\n\nDespite this, most police departments continue to allow officers to shoot people in these situations.\n\nIn many countries, police routinely disarm people who have knivesÂ without shooting them.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a country of 67 million people where police encounter knife attacks at aÂ similar rateÂ as US police, policeÂ fatally shot zero people with knives in 2023. In Los Angeles County, with a population of 10 million, law enforcement officersÂ fatally shot 15 peopleÂ allegedly armed with knives in 2023.\n\n% of killings by police in 2023 â deaths â were traffic stops, police responses to mental health crises, or situations where the person was not reportedly threatening anyone with a gun. Creating alternatives responses to these situations could substantially reduce this violence nationwide.\n\nMental Health/Welfare Check ( )\n\nTraffic Stop ( )\n\nPerson Not Alleged to be Threatening with a Gun ( )\n\nUndetermined ( )\n\nWhich would mean substantially fewer people killed by police in almost every city."
