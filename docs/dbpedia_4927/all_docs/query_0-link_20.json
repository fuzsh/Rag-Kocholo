        "text": "Former major league pitcher Frank Castillo, who spent parts of three seasons with the Red Sox, died Sunday in a drowning accident near his home in Arizona. He was 44.\n\nCastillo’s family released the following statement to KVIA in El Paso, Texas:\n\n“Frank Castillo died on Sunday in a drowning accident while with his family at a lake near his home. Frank was a wonderful son, terrific brother, and an extraordinary father to his two beautiful girls.\n\n“Everyone who knew Frank loved Frank. We are devastated by this loss.\n\n“It is impossible to express in words the level of sadness we feel due to this tragedy. All of those who counted Frank as a personal friend, and to all those wonderful fans who cheered for him during his major league career, we genuinely appreciate your prayers and kind words during this extremely difficult time.\n\n“While we may not be able to thank each of you in person, it is very comforting to know that you are with us in spirit.”\n\nCastillo appeared in 64 games for the Red Sox (49 starts) from 2001-04, going 16-24 with a 4.66 ERA. He spent the first six years of his career with the Cubs, and most recently served as the pitching coach for Chicago’s Arizona Rookie League affiliate in Mesa."
