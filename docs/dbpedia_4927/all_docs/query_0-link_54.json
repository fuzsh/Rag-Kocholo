The Diamondbacks won their seventh straight series and moved into the first National League wild-card spot.\n\nRodriguez, who joined Arizona on a four-year contract in December, had been sidelined with a left shoulder strain. The left-hander gave up three runs and is 7-0 with a 2.51 ERA in nine career starts against Cleveland.\n\nJustin Martinez loaded the bases in the ninth before striking out Lane Thomas to end the game, earning his second save of the series and his career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nCatcher Adrian Del Castillo made his major league debut — doubling in a run in his initial plate appearance — and Randal Grichuk had a solo homer for the Diamondbacks, who are 24-9 since June 29.\n\nThe Guardians extended their longest losing streak of the season to five, but lead the American League Central by 3 1/2 games over Minnesota.

Carlos Carrasco (3-10) allowed four runs in 4 1/3 innings for the loss.\n\nGIANTS 7, NATIONALS 4\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) —Heliot Ramos and Matt Chapman hit fifth-inning solo homers to break a 3-3 tie and the San Francisco beat Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRamos homered for the second straight game, and Chapman finished a triple short of the cycle for the Giants, who have won nine of 12. Mike Yastrzemski added a solo homer and an RBI triple.\n\nBlake Snell (2-3), coming off a no-hitter against the A’s in his last start, gave up three runs on four hits over six innings, retiring the last nine hitters he faced. He had allowed only two earned runs total in his five starts since coming off the injured list. Snell, who struck out eight and walked one, threw 93 pitches.\n\nThe Nationals loaded the bases against closer Camilo Doval with one out in the bottom of the ninth, but Doval got Alex Call to ground into a double play for his 22nd save.\n\nMARLINS 6, REDS 4\n\nMIAMI (AP) — Derek Hill’s grand slam capped a five-run first inning and Marlins starter Valente Bellozo carried a shutout into the sixth as Miami held off a late rally and beat Cincinnati.\n\nHill, claimed on waivers from San Francisco on Saturday, drove a fastball from Reds starter Andrew Abbott (9-9) 412 feet to center after Jonah Bride singled and Jesus Sanchez and Otto Lopez walked. It was the left fielder’s fourth homer of the season and first as a Marlin.\n\nThat came after designated hitter Jake Burger opened the scoring with a 399-foot homer to center. He then hit a 422-foot shot to left in the fifth, for his 18th and 19th homers of the season. He has six in his last nine games.\n\nORIOLES 7, BLUE JAYS 3\n\nTOTONTO (AP) — Anthony Santander hit two home runs and made a spectacular catch while Jackson Holliday added a two-run homer of his own to help Baltimore beat Toronto.\n\nThe switch-hitting Santander connected for a two-run shot off Blue Jays right-hander Bowden Francis in the first inning, then added a solo homer off left-hander Ryan Yarbrough from the other side of the plate in the eighth. The homers were his 33rd and 34th, a career high.\n\nSantander leads MLB with 25 home runs since the start of June. It was his third multi-homer game of the season and the 16th of his career.\n\nHolliday went deep for the third straight game for the Orioles, who lead the majors with 178 home runs. Holliday has at least one RBI in five straight games.\n\nEloy Jiménez added a two-run double as the Orioles bounced back after losing Tuesday’s series opener.\n\nMaking his second start for Baltimore, left-hander Trevor Rogers allowed three runs, two earned, and seven hits in five innings.

Nick Mears, Joel Payamps, Jared Koenig and Devin Williams each pitched an inning of relief.\n\nROYALS 8, RED SOX 4\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Bobby Witt Jr. had two homers, a double and four RBIs as Kansas City beat Boston and salvaged the final game of a three-game series.\n\nWith the victory, the Royals moved 1 1/2 games ahead of Boston in the race for a wild-card spot in the American League. In the AL Central, Kansas City moved within a half-game of second-place Minnesota, which lost to the Chicago Cubs. The Royals are four games back of Cleveland, which was swept in a doubleheader by Arizona.\n\nWitt had his fourth multi-homer game of the season, getting the Royals on the scoreboard in the first with his 21st homer. Witt’s second homer of the game was a 421-foot blast to center field in the sixth inning. He also added a two-run double.\n\nThe Royals have homered in 13 consecutive games, tied for the second-longest streak in club history.\n\nCole Ragans (9-7) allowed four runs, one earned, on six hits in 6 1/3 innings, striking out seven and walking two.\n\nYANKEES 5, ANGELS 2, 1ST GAME\n\nANGELS 8, YANKEES 2, 2ND GAME\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Zach Neto hit his first career grand slam in a six-run second inning off rookie Will Warren and drove in a career-high six runs as the Los Angeles Angels beat the New York Yankees for a doubleheader split on Wednesday night.\n\nIn the first game, New York rookie Luis Gil battled command issues but pitched five scoreless innings of two-hit ball in a 5-2 victory. Neto hit a two-run homer in the seventh of the opener before the best game of his career in the nightcap.\n\nWarren was one strike away from escaping the second with just a 2-0 deficit, but Neto turned on a full-count sinker and lifted it to the back of the Angels’ bullpen in left field to make it 6-0.\n\nNeto’s 412-foot drive gave him five homers in his last nine games and was Los Angeles’ fifth grand slam this season.\n\nPADRES 9, PIRATES 8, 10 INNINGS\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — Jackson Merrill had two homers, Xander Bogaerts singled in the go-ahead run in a three-run 10th inning and San Diego held on for a victory over Pittsburgh.\n\nBogaerts led off the 10th with a line drive to left field off Colin Holderman (3-5), scoring automatic runner Luis Arraez. The Padres tacked on two runs on a sacrifice fly by Manny Machado and an error on catcher Yasmani Grandal.\n\nThe Padres needed those extra runs as the Pirates cut the lead with a bases-loaded walk by Tanner Scott (7-5) and wild pitch by Adrian Morejon. Morejon relieved with runners on second and third with none out and earned his first career save.\n\nSan Diego is 13-3 since the All-Star break and entered the night four games behind the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.\n\nThe Pirates have lost three in a row for the first time since May 7-10 as they fell under .500 at 56-57.\n\nMETS 5, ROCKIES 3\n\nDENVER (AP) — Francisco Lindor hit a tie-breaking, two-run single in the ninth inning, Jesse Winker had three hits, and the New York Mets beat the Colorado Rockies 5-3 on Wednesday night.\n\nWith the game tied 2-2 in the ninth, Lindor singled to left off Colorado’s Victor Vodnik (3-2) to score Harrison Bader and Ben Gamel, putting the Mets ahead. Bader was pinch running for Francisco Alvarez, who hit an opposite-field triple off the out-of-town scoreboard in right field with one out. Gamel and Tyrone Taylor then walked to load the bases for Lindor.\n\nWinker then added a single with two outs to drive in Taylor for a 5-2 lead. The Mets had 11 hits, 10 of which were singles.\n\nEzequiel Tovar homered in the first for the Rockies, who have 72 homers since June 15. Atlanta leads the majors with 73 during that span. The Mets are third with 71.\n\nJose Butto (5-3) gave up one hit and struck out two in two scoreless innings for the win. Edwin Diaz pitched the ninth for his 14th save in 19 chances, giving up a Michael Toglia triple and an RBI groundout before recording the final out.\n\nTIGERS 6, MARINERS 2\n\nSEATTLE (AP) — Tarik Skubal allowed two runs over seven innings, Parker Meadows made a homer-saving catch in the eighth inning and Detroit beat Seattle.\n\nSkubal (13-4) was overpowering in stretches. The 27-year-old left-hander allowed three hits, struck out nine and continued to strengthen his resume in the AL Cy Young Award conversation.\n\nBut Meadows’ catch will be the lasting image of the game as Seattle fell out of first place in the AL West, slipping a half-game behind Houston.\n\nPHILLIES 9, DODGERS 4\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Kyle Schwarber homered three times and drove in seven of Philadelphia’s nine runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nSchwarber hit his 27th homer of the season leading off the ninth against Michael Grove. It was his second career three-run homer game, the last coming in 2021.\n\nThe seven RBIs are the most by a Phillies player since Carlos Ruiz had that many against Atlanta in 2012."
