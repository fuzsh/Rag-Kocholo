Curlee Memorial Scholarship in Speech-Language Pathology was made possible through the generous gift of Jenrose H. Curlee.\n\nRichard F. Curlee was born in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1935. He completed his bachelor’s degree at Wake Forest University. During his undergraduate education, he worked at a radio and television station to support himself and his young bride, Jenrose “Jennie” Hodge. Fortunately for all, he decided to forego a career in weather and sports announcing, and instead chose to attain his master’s and doctoral degrees at the University of Southern California. A fellow USC alumnus convinced Curlee to work at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association as the Executive Secretary of Research in Rockville, MD. But eventually, he was recruited out west to the University of Arizona, beginning his tenure as a “Wildcat” in 1975. During his time at the UA, he served the Department as an Associate Professor, Full Professor and Department Head. He also served as Associate Dean of the Graduate College. He retired from the Department in the spring of 2000.\n\nDr. Curlee was recognized for his distinguished contribution to the field of communication sciences and disorders, especially in the area of stuttering. Through his remarkable career, he received numerous awards, among them the UA Faculty of Science Distinguished Teaching Award, the Honors of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and his most prized award the Malcolm Fraser Award from the Stuttering Foundation of America. He died in Tucson on January 29, 2008.\n\nRecipients of the Richard F. Curlee Memorial Scholarship will be full-time master’s students in speech-language pathology at the University of Arizona and completed one semester at the graduate level. One annual award will be made each year. This scholarship is a one-time award.
