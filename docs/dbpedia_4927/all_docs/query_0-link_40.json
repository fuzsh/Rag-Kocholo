        "text": "Andy Marte, a former York Revolution player who went on to the big leagues, died early Sunday in a crash that occurred in his native Dominican Republic.\n\nMetropolitan traffic authorities say Marte, 33, died when the Mercedes Benz he was driving hit a house along a road between San Francisco de Macoris and Pimentel, about 95 miles north of the capital.\n\nThe York Revolution tweeted condolences on Sunday: \"Marte, who was with York in 2013, was a consummate pro, highly respected by his teammates, and one of the nicest men off the field as well.\"\n\nAfter his time in York, Marte went on to play infield for several Major League teams, including the Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians and Arizona Diamondbacks, and was most recently playing in the Korean league. At the time of his death, he was in the Dominican winter league with the Aguilas Cibaenas team.\n\nSince the Revs began play in 2007, Marte's death marks at least the second unexpected death of a former player. Frank Castillo died in 2013 in a drowning incident."
