The meeting intended to update the ten-year-old safety guidelines for the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in research and clinical settings (Rossi et al., 2009). Therefore, only emerging and new issues are covered in detail, leaving still valid the 2009 recommendations regarding the description of conventional or patterned TMS protocols, the screening of subjects/patients, the need of neurophysiological monitoring for new protocols, the utilization of reference thresholds of stimulation, the managing of seizures and the list of minor side effects.\n\nNew issues discussed in detail from the meeting up to April 2020 are safety issues of recently developed stimulation devices and pulse configurations; duties and responsibility of device makers; novel scenarios of TMS applications such as in the neuroimaging context or imaging-guided and robot-guided TMS; TMS interleaved with transcranial electrical stimulation; safety during paired associative stimulation interventions; and risks of using TMS to induce therapeutic seizures (magnetic seizure therapy).\n\nAn update on the possible induction of seizures, theoretically the most serious risk of TMS, is provided. It has become apparent that such a risk is low, even in patients taking drugs acting on the central nervous system, at least with the use of traditional stimulation parameters and focal coils for which large data sets are available. Finally, new operational guidelines are provided for safety in planning future trials based on traditional and patterned TMS protocols, as well as a summary of the minimal training requirements for operators, and a note on ethics of neuroenhancement.\n\nKeywords: TMS, rTMS, TBS, QPS, Safety, Neuromodulation, Neurology, Psychiatry\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThis is the third article on safety of use of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in clinical practice and research following by eleven years the last IFCN guidelines (Rossi et al., 2009), which itself followed the first guidelines by eleven years (Wassermann, 1998). To minimize redundancy, the current update (that began at the meeting in October 2018 and lasted up to April 2020) does not cover again some basic topics that have previously been fully discussed and approved on a consensus basis, nor will it discuss again certain guidelines and recommendations to prevent adverse effects which have proved useful in the interim: the need for neurophysiological monitoring for every new intervention protocol that exceeds, or is close to, the limits suggested in the original safety tables (Wassermann, 1998); pros and cons on resting motor threshold (RMT) or phosphene threshold as reference for “dosing” rTMS; minor side effects as local pain, headache or discomfort; description of conventional or patterned TMS protocols; and screening questionnaires for subjects/patients undergoing rTMS.\n\nRather, the update focuses on recent technological developments of stimulation devices and pulse configuration, including duties for device manufacturers, novel scenarios of application such as TMS in a neuroimaging context or imaging- and robot-guided TMS and TMS interleaved with other techniques of transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), as well as potential risks of new pharmacological interactions, especially in patient populations. Potential risks of paired associative stimulation (PAS) techniques are also covered.\n\nWe also address risks of magnetic-seizure therapy (MST), a topic that was not covered in previous guidelines. We provide an update on TMS-induced seizures, which remains the most serious risk of this technique, although by now it is certain that such a risk is very low. In this framework, we also remark on the need to distinguish at a clinical level between seizure and convulsive syncope. Finally, new operational guidelines will be provided for traditional and patterned TMS protocols whenever substantial data are available, as well as a summary of the minimal training requirements for operators.\n\nWhen encountered in the text, the term “new” is intended to be in regard to previous 2009 safety guidelines, with the exception of “new” TMS devices which refers to the state of evidence for their safety.\n\nCurrent guidelines reflect expert opinion based on the available evidence. The rating of the level of evidence is something that would have been very useful. Unfortunately, this is impossible, as virtually none of the studies were done with the specific purpose of assessing safety. In these studies, the safety information is just incidental.\n\nIn order to facilitate reading, in we report the standardized classification of adverse events (AEs), with relative abbreviations. “Serious” adverse events (SAEs) are defined as those events which are life-threatening, result in death, require patient’s hospitalization or prolongation of their hospitalization.\n\nTable 1\n\nAbbreviationDefinitionHints for interpretationAEAdverse eventAny untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any untoward clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or other persons whether or not related to the investigational medical deviceSAESerious adverse eventAdverse event that: (a) led to a death, injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.

New TMS devices and methods\n\nThis section addresses safety and risk management relevant to any new TMS device or method of use. For the purpose of this section, a TMS device or method of intervention is considered new when first introduced or functionally reconfigured (e.g., with new waveforms, coils, pulse train patterns, or intensity) by a device maker or user. A device will remain to be considered new until sufficiently strong evidence of safety is generated, regardless of absolute chronology. Devices and specific paradigms that have been subject of significant clinical testing, including as part of regulatory clearance [e.g., by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)], would not be considered new; guidelines for them will be discussed in subsequent sections of this document. Those recommendations for established TMS systems cannot automatically be applied directly to new TMS devices and paradigms, and new TMS devices generally require additional risk analysis and management.\n\n2.1. Risk analysis and management\n\nRisk analysis is warranted whenever there is a change in the TMS equipment or method of use, including hardware and software configuration, dose selection, environment, or subject population that result in potential new risks compared to TMS devices and methods with established safety records. Changes to complementary technologies and methods such as neuronavigation, coil holders, dosing algorithms, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners may also affect risk. New instrumentation or methods do not necessarily imply increased risks; the risk level may possibly be lowered with more accurate targeting, optimized electric field (Efield) shaping, more sensitive and specific detection of responses, or more efficient threshold or dose determination algorithms. However, even if the risk analysis suggests unchanged or lower risks, when new technologies and methods of use are deployed, increased vigilance is warranted. The process (framework) of risk analysis for new TMS systems is already established through regulations such as those governing human trials [e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval] and medical device manufacturing (e.g., IEC/IEEE standards). Therefore, the following sections should not be understood as suggesting additional or new processes, but rather providing insight on how to apply relevant existing processes for new TMS devices and paradigms. Risk analysis and management is the overall principle guiding these processes. In deciding whether to proceed with a new TMS approach (either device or protocol), risk is also considered against benefit.\n\n2.2. Technical safety\n\nTechnical safety of a TMS device refers to hazards to the subject or operator other than those related to the effects of the E-field induced in a body when the intended magnetic field is generated around the TMS coil. For example, technical aspects relevant to TMS safety include electrical insulation of high voltages; heating, vibration, fractures, acoustic clicking, biocompatibility and weight of the coil; reliability of generating the intended magnetic field; electromagnetic interference with other devices; neck pain due to head posture; headache or neck pain due to pressure on the scalp; and human factors (e.g., incorrect use or access by unqualified personnel) (Ruohonen and Ilmoniemi, 2005).\n\nTechnical safety is largely an issue of medical equipment design, manufacturing, maintenance, and proper use. Risk management for technical safety begins with compliance of the design and manufacturing with relevant medical device safety standards and guidelines, as well as consideration of novel contexts in which the device is intended to be used, such as in conjunction with another device such as an MRI scanner or EEG equipment. As applicable, national regulatory agencies (such as EU and Asian regulators and USA FDA) require compliance with a range of medical equipment standards; such standards indicate equipment-specific testing and cannot be based on “equivalence” when the hardware is unique (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011).\n\nThe risk management during the design, manufacture, delivery, maintenance, and use of medical devices as a formal process is the cornerstone for guaranteeing safety. It should be performed continuously throughout the device lifecycle. Formal risk management is defined as the application of engineering practices to analyze, evaluate, and control risk. As applicable, practices of risk management for medical devices can be informed by various national and international standards, including the ISO 14971 standard (International Organization for Standardization, 2007). The process involves identifying possible ways in which the device could bring harm to a user or patient. Then, the device maker determines the likelihood of occurrence of each potential risk and their gravity (e.g., the severity of the potential harm should the risk be realized, ranging from minor inconvenience to severe injury). Finally, the maker identifies and implements safety measures, called mitigators, that act to reduce each identified risk to an acceptable level. These can span warning labels (instructions) to features that automatically shut down the device when errant conditions are detected.\n\n2.3. Stimulation dose safety\n\nStimulation dose safety refers to the effects of the TMS magnetic field with the intended dose induced in the body of anyone exposed to the field, including subject, operator, bystander, or fetus. The dose of TMS is defined as all device parameters that influence the generated magnetic field and the resultant induced E-field in the body (Peterchev et al., 2012). TMS accessories such as coil arms, neuronavigation, and software can affect the dose selection and delivery. The risks of stimulation can be subject-dependent. A stimulation dose that is safe for one subject may not be safe for another, e.g., because of a different seizure threshold or interaction with different drugs. Doses that are considered safe may depend on the cortical region that is targeted by stimulation and may differ depending on the precise shape of the E-field that is generated by a specific coil. Moreover, the subject or operator may have implants or other objects attached to their body that introduce risk when exposed to the magnetic field and/or E-field (see Section 3.2). Further, because of different risk-benefit ratios, the criteria of what is an acceptable risk may vary when applied to a subject, pregnant woman, or patient who is the intended target of TMS versus an operator or fetus who are not targeted. Stimulation dose may be hard-limited by equipment design or guided by device instructions (indications for use), but given that most TMS devices allow for a wide range of waveforms, coil placements and off-label use, stimulation dose safety largely relies on risk management by the operator (see Section 2.5).\n\nRisk analysis of the stimulation dose of new TMS devices or protocols begins with theoretical considerations related to the induced magnetic field, computational models or estimates of the resulting induced E-field, and theories or evidence of how pulse train parameters affect relevant neuronal activation. Given certain unknowns about the neurobiological mechanisms of TMS, comparison with the electromagnetic output and effects of other devices and protocols is useful, including documented AEs and approvals of instruments by regulatory agencies around the world. Risks to be evaluated include (but are not necessarily limited to) effects on the brain (e.g., seizures or thought processing), on implanted objects (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, brain implants, hearing aids, surgical clips), and on a fetus and operator. With the most significant established dose-related risk of TMS being induction of seizure, changes that may affect seizure threshold should be weighed, including alterations in the E-field distribution (e.g., more distributed field or field in new brain regions); temporal pulse repetition rates, patterns, or number of pulses; pulse waveforms; or intensity selection and individualization. For example, holding other parameters constant, one would generally expect higher risk for strong versus weak pulse intensities and more versus fewer pulses. When, based on such analysis, new potential risks are identified, then additional safety studies and careful safety monitoring during a research or clinical study are warranted.\n\nRisk analysis can include evidence of one or more TMS predicates. This “biological effect equivalence” with predicates is based on stimulation dose safety. For stimulation dose safety (and efficacy), this is a model adopted by regulatory agencies such as the FDA when evaluating the safety and efficacy of TMS. Whereas, starting in 2008, the approval of the first rTMS system by the FDA involved substantial clinical trials with measures of efficacy and safety, new systems may be approved with little or no clinical trials if “the proposed device is sufficiently similar to the predicate device in terms of indications, device specifications, and energy output” (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011). When new TMS devices have equivalent output, i.e. can provide stimulation doses for the same indications as comparative (approved) predicate devices, FDA considers them to be capable of the same clinical performance demonstrated by the predicate. Note that when a device cleared by a regulatory body is used in an off-label manner (e.g., a waveform available through a research mode, a patient population not included in the original label, or a new coil), risk analysis is warranted and the sanctioning by the regulatory agency may or may not apply.\n\n2.4. Experimental/animal models\n\nAn ongoing body of work on animal models has been steadily accumulating since the 2009 TMS safety guidelines. Most of the studies were performed in rodents or using in-vitro preparations, with the bulk of this work originating from a small number of specialized groups investigating mechanisms of action of TMS and the translational potential for clinical applications. In the following two paragraphs some emerging issues potentially relevant for safety are highlighted, as they raise two types of questions: (i) whether rTMS effects can act by eliciting action potentials or modulating axon membrane potentials only, or also by inducing intracellular changes in neuron architecture, axonal transport, or cytoskeleton; (ii) and therefore whether the magnetic field can influence cellular targets other than neurons, beyond the mechanisms affecting transmembrane potential (Rodger and Sherrard, 2015).\n\nKey work in this sense has been carried out to understand the role of cortical inhibitory interneurons in plasticity induction. This work has highlighted the ability of protocols such as theta burst stimulation (TBS) to modulate fast spiking neurons (Funke and Benali, 2011; Trippe et al., 2009). At the cellular level, single-pulse TMS has been shown to induce GABA-mediated inhibition of cortical dendrites in layer V pyramidal neurons (Murphy et al., 2016), while very high intensity TMS in a rat model has been shown to transiently increase permeability across the blood brain barrier in a mechanism that is mediated by glutamate release (Vazana et al., 2016). An important technical achievement has been the development of a system in primates for focal TMS and single neuronal recording at the coil focus (Mueller et al., 2014). This work follows the fundamental work combining TMS with electrophysiological recordings undertaken in cat visual cortex (Allen et al., 2007; Moliadze et al., 2003). Using this setup, action potentials were recorded around 1 ms after the TMS pulses (Li et al., 2017).\n\nIt has been shown that low-intensity magnetic stimulation using small (<10 mm in diameter) circular coils with an iron core generating fields of less than 100mT at their surface modulate intracellular calcium release (Grehl et al., 2015), influence motor learning (Tang et al., 2018), increase levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Kim et al., 2016), induce topographical changes in visual cortex (Rodiger et al., 2012; Makowiecki et al., 2014) generate electrophysiological effects in in-vitro preparations that last beyond the stimulation period (Lenz et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016a; Vlachos et al., 2012), and especially induce axon outgrowth and neural repair, possibly due to the presence of cryptochrome, a magnetoreceptor able to activate intracellular signaling cascades (Dufor et al., 2019; Sherrard et al., 2018).\n\nEffects of repeated rTMS sessions have received attention with regard to mechanisms and safety. For example, following repeated sessions of 10 Hz rTMS over 5 days in rats, no changes were found in development of body and organ weights in female rats (Sato et al., 2017). However, high-intensity stimulation (150% of RMT) induced thinning of post-synaptic density, disordered synaptic structure, reduced the number of synapses, and downregulated BDNF–TrkB and synaptic proteins (Ma et al., 2014). Following 2000 pulses at 100% of RMT in a rat model, no evidence of DNA damage in brain cells was seen (de Sauvage et al., 2008). A study in which aged mice were exposed to 25 Hz rTMS over 14 days, showed a reversal of certain metabolic and behavioral markers of cognitive decline (Wang et al., 2013); a study in a guinea pig model found that 10 daily sessions of 1 Hz low-intensity stimulation significantly reduced tinnitus without affecting BDNF levels or hyperactivity (Mulders et al., 2016), and a study in an animal model of depression found that 10 days of low- (1 Hz) or high-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation generated antidepressant effects (Hesselberg et al., 2016).\n\nFinally, initial studies with regard to the pro- and anti-convulsant effects of TMS were examined in dedicated rat models (Chameh et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2014; Shojaei et al., 2014). The role of anesthesia in animal TMS studies on findings has been highlighted (Gersner et al., 2011) in which high-frequency rTMS in rats led alternatively to decreased and raised levels of neuroplasticity markers such as BDNF in anesthetized and awake animals, respectively. Diagnostic TMS in anesthetized rats showed that while long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) was observed, its level was significantly reduced following injection of a convulsant agent, although single-pulse measures of excitability were unchanged (Vahabzadeh-Hagh et al., 2012). Metabolic effects of single sessions of high- versus low-frequency rTMS have been investigated using microPET in a rat model (Parthoens et al., 2014). Regional distribution of cerebral uptake of [18F]-PET was found to be largely similar between 1 Hz and 50 Hz sessions, (but the scale of uptake was larger for the high frequency), while high- (10 Hz) and low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation differently affect regional cerebral blood flow, with more widespread or more pronounced effects, respectively (Wyckhuys et al., 2013).\n\nSeveral issues need to be considered when translating the findings in rodent models to the safe use of TMS of the human brain (Vahabzadeh-Hagh et al., 2012). Many studies use electrical rather than inductive magnetic stimulation in small animal models (that moreover have to be anaesthetised) in order to better mimic the effects of TMS due to the impact of head size and coil-to-brain ratio on the distribution of induced fields (used for example by (Levy et al., 2007; Moshe et al., 2016), and the translational implications have been discussed. Finally, a significant body of work has addressed the issue of building practical and efficient TMS coils for small animals (for example, Rastogi et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016b).\n\nIn summary, while TMS studies in small animals are by now not conclusive, mainly because focality of stimulation in these circumstances cannot be achieved, (thus, they do not directly mirror the actual stimulation conditions in humans), they still play an important role in investigating its basic mechanisms. Preclinical TMS studies are important for demonstrating safety at cellular and genetic levels, and they facilitate development of novel protocols and techniques.\n\n2.5. Manufacturer vs user responsibilities\n\nTechnical and stimulation-dose safety should be analyzed and managed during both manufacturing and the use of TMS devices.\n\nManufacturer responsibilities\n\nRisk management and quality assurance must be implemented by the entity that designed and constructed the TMS device, which is typically a commercial manufacturer but can be a maker based in an academic or medical center, e.g., a research laboratory. The maker should identify and manage aspects of the device operation that present either technical or stimulation-dose risk. As applicable, technical safety is defined and regulated by medical device safety standards such as IEC/ UL60601–1(UL,2003)andIEC/EN62304(InternationalElectrotechnical Commission, 2006) as well as by environmental exposure standards such as those by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). The degree of relevant regulations may vary with the nature and scale of deployment including production for clinical use, investigational use, and custom device. The dose may be limited by the device maker to address risks including excessive coil heating or adverse neuromodulatory effects. The maker should also address human factors, e.g., by providing protections so that the device cannot be operated incorrectly in a way that increases risk. The maker provides instructions for safe operation and maintenance of the device, which users should respect in limiting how the device is used.\n\nAs applicable, a manufacturer’s risk management may be audited by a regulatory agency. For example, in evaluating a device for approval, the FDA may require labeling materials, operator’s manual, flammability and biocompatibility test report for the coil, software report, FDA-recognized standard electrical safety test report (‘EN’ reports are not acceptable, ‘IEC’ reports are), FDA-recognized standard electromagnetic compatibility test report, bench performance testing (magnetic field output, cooling system, acoustic output, etc.). Some of these tests may have to be certified by independent test laboratories. In Europe, the CE mark process follows largely comparable testing and certification plans. Audits are part of a manufacturer receiving government regulatory clearance (e.g., US FDA clearance, CE Mark per EU directive 93/42/EEC), but risk management should be applied in any case, including investigational devices. The appropriate degree and processes of risk management (and what regulation may apply for example to “custom” devices) is the responsibility of the maker to determine.\n\nQuality assurance (or Quality System of Good Manufacturing Practice) comprises processes by device makers to ensure that their TMS systems perform safely and reliably. This includes delivering a magnetic field corresponding to the intended stimulation dose. If a device is provided without quality assurance in place, there are no comprehensive guarantees of what the device does. Even if the device appears to operate as expected initially, failures may emerge. One device may operate differently than others of the same serial and model number. For example, avoiding a production error that changes the coil inductance, resistance, or shape or the pulse generator capacitance in a way that changes the magnetic field is a quality issue. Another quality issue is that TMS coils and other system components may be subject to mechanical, electrical, or chemical stresses limiting the lifetime of the system. Quality is also in place to prevent technical hazards unrelated to the stimulation function such as electrical safety. Determining and implementing the appropriate degree and processes of quality control (including if and what regulations apply) is the responsibility of the maker. Medical device manufacturers are required to conform to ISO 13485 (Europe) or 21 CFR 820 (US) for their quality management system. If issues with the device quality are identified after the device has been cleared for use, regulatory agencies such as the FDA have mechanisms for postmarket reporting of AE, use errors, and product problems (U.S. FDA, 2018).\n\nUser responsibilities\n\nThe user should consider the provenance of any TMS device or accessory to ensure that the maker has implemented adequate risk management and quality assurance. Unless warranted, TMS devices should be operated according to the instructions, e.g., the user manual, in the frame of international guidelines (Rossini et al., 2015). The user can access information about device approvals as well as up-to-date safety communications from regulatory agencies (U.S. FDA, 2018). If operation beyond these instructions is attempted, risk analysis is necessary. Operating a device outside the maker’s specified environments, configuration, or accessories, such as connecting a custom coil or measuring EEG simultaneously, can negate assurance of technical safety, and requires additional risk analysis and management. The user also has to be mindful of the lifetime of each device; for instance, the maker may define the maximum safe number of pulses for a coil or other components of the system. Adequate hearing protection should be used (see Section 4.2). Regardless of prior technical safety testing and even if the device is operated correctly, the user should be aware of faults that may occur over the course of a device lifetime, such as cracks in the coil or device enclosure, compromises in the insulation, altered sound, smoke, or unexpected smells. In case of such, use of the device should be discontinued immediately and it should be serviced by qualified personnel. The potential for interaction of TMS with other devices and associated risk should be considered too, for example when combining TMS with an MRI scanner, a PET scanner, or an EEG system.\n\nRegarding dose, conventional TMS devices and paradigms should be operated in accordance with the safety guidelines presented in this paper (Section 7) or a risk analysis should be conducted. Novel devices, paradigms, or subject populations require additional risk management steps, since the effects on the body may differ from those of conventional devices or paradigms (for examples see next section). When a trial involves novel aspects that could reasonably introduce new risks, there are established approaches to increase vigilance in monitoring for early indicators of risk [e.g., Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) after discharges indicative of excessive excitation that could result in a seizure] or management of an unexpected AE (e.g. protocol to contact clinical support staff). It is not possible to precisely identify and mitigate every possible risk, but reliance on predicates (e.g. prior tests of an investigational coil or comparable waveforms) with prudent considerations of those novel aspects of the protocol, can support rational risk analysis. Predicates may be weighted by the size of the trial (number of subjects) and rigor of their monitoring.\n\nFor TMS studies involving human subjects, risk analysis and management is an established process governed by the relevant IRB or Ethics Committee. In such studies, the investigator is required to identify and report risks, along with methods to mitigate them or manage AEs. In the US, an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) is required for human studies with many medical devices; however, the FDA allows the local IRB to provide an IDE when specific conditions apply. IRBs may rely on approval by a regulatory body (e.g., FDA clearance or a CE mark) as evidence of risk management and quality control by the maker, but risk management is still needed if the method of device use (e.g., indication, environment) differs from that approved by the regulatory body. It is worth stressing that an IRB approval is always an approval of a study, not of a device, and that IRB requirements will vary between institutions and countries.\n\n2.6. Brief review of new devices and paradigms\n\nHere we review the evidence for safety of recently introduced TMS devices and paradigms. It should be noted that the majority of studies using novel devices or stimulation paradigms have been conducted with relatively small numbers of subjects, so the absence of unexpected side effects should be interpreted with caution.\n\n2.6.1. New pulse generators and stimulus waveforms\n\nOver the past decade, devices have been developed that allow more extensive control over the waveform of the individual magnetic pulses than in conventional TMS devices. The latter produce damped sinusoidal pulses with fixed pulse width, whereas other devices such as those called cTMS (Peterchev et al., 2014, 2011, 2008) and FlexTMS (Gattinger et al., 2012) generate more rectangular E-field pulses with continuous control of parameters such as the pulse width and the positive/negative phase amplitude ratio of the pulse. These novel pulse shapes can be delivered at both low and high rTMS frequencies. TMS devices with even more flexibility of pulse shaping are under development (Goetz et al., 2015; Peterchev et al., 2015).\n\nIt is known that briefer pulses require larger E-field amplitudes to activate neurons (as described by the so-called strength–duration curve) (Barker et al., 1991; Rothkegel et al., 2010; Peterchev et al., 2012). FDA-approved rTMS devices have pulse widths that differ by a factor of up to two. There is no evidence that pulse-width differences on this order affect the risk for seizure when the stimulation intensity is adjusted relative to the RMT. There is some evidence from single-pulse studies that the pulse width may affect scalp sensation, but the effect is small and it is unclear how it translates to rTMS (Peterchev et al., 2017).\n\nThere is significant literature on the effects of pulse waveform and E-field direction on the neuromodulatory effect of rTMS (Sommer et al., 2013). Earlier data came from comparisons between conventional biphasic and monophasic pulses (Antal et al., 2002; Arai et al., 2007, 2005; Hosono et al., 2008; Sommer et al., 2002; Taylor and Loo, 2007; Tings et al., 2005), whereas more recent studies have used cTMS (Sommer et al., 2014; Peterchev et al., 2015; Goetz et al., 2016). Collectively, these results suggest that TMS pulses with asymmetric E-field phase amplitude —i.e., one phase having significantly larger amplitude than the other, such as in conventional monophasic pulses— confer stronger and direction-specific neuromodulatory effects in rTMS (Halawa et al., 2019). While at present complete mechanistic explanation of these effects is lacking, the most likely factor is differential recruitment of neural elements and neural populations by pulses of varying waveform shape, duration, and direction, as witnessed, for example, by different MEP latencies (D’Ostilio et al., 2016; Goetz et al., 2015; Hannah and Rothwell, 2017; Hannah et al., 2020; Sakai et al., 1997; Sommer et al., 2018, 2016), different corticospinal volley composition (Di Lazzaro and Rothwell, 2014) and evoked EEG potentials (Casula et al., 2018).\n\nThese studies with unconventional pulse shapes did not report unexpected AEs, with one qualified exception: Tings et al. (2005) found that trains of 80 pulses at 5 Hz over primary motor cortex (M1) with intensity adjusted to yield baseline MEP amplitudes of about 1 mV resulted in an alternating pattern of low and very high MEP amplitudes and spreading of excitation in 8 of the 18 participants. This occurred with the most excitatory pulse configuration, monophasic pulses with posterior–anterior direction (Prof. Martin Sommer, personal communication, December 20, 2018). It should be noted, however, that the pulse train parameters significantly exceeded the range (10 pulses at 5 Hz) of the original safety tables (Wassermann, 1998).\n\nWhile instances of seizures have not been reported with waveforms other than conventional sinusoidal biphasic and sinusoidal polyphasic pulses used in early rTMS systems, the observations of stronger neuromodulation with asymmetric pulses should be flagged for appropriate risk management. For example, even if rTMS paradigms using alternative (especially asymmetrical) E-field pulses conform to the guidelines in Section 7, more extensive monitoring for potential seizure induction may be appropriate until there is adequate evidence that the risk is not significantly increased.\n\n2.6.2. New pulse sequences\n\nA protocol that combined features of TBS (200 ms interburst interval) and quadri-pulse TMS (four pulse bursts at 666 Hz or 200 Hz) applied at 90% of active motor threshold (AMT) with sinusoidal biphasic pulses has been shown to produce lasting neuromodulation in 16 healthy subjects, without AEs (Jung et al., 2016). This protocol did not only add a fourth pulse, but also chose an ultra-high pulse repetition rate within a single burst. The physiological impact of within-burst frequencies of 200 Hz or more remains to be explored. Regarding the number of pulses per burst in a TBS stimulation paradigm, modelling studies predict a fluctuating pattern of excitability increases and decreases with increasing number per burst rather than an increase in cortical excitability with the number of pulses per burst (Wilson et al., 2018).\n\nNo safety data are available yet for these new pulse sequences.\n\n2.6.3. New coils\n\nCoil characteristics relevant for TMS dose safety include shape, size, and number of winding turns. The shape and size of a coil as well as its placement and orientation determine the spatial pattern of the E-field induced in the body. The number of winding turns, in combination with the coil shape and size, affects the strength of the induced E-field as well as its pulse width (via the coil inductance). Pulse waveform effects are addressed above, and the strength of the E-field is adjustable by the coil current amplitude; therefore, here we focus on the effect of coil shape and size.\n\nThe simplest TMS coil type is circular (or round); it produces an annulus-shaped E-field pattern. A more focused E-field pattern is obtained with figure-8 coils, where the area of cortex significantly stimulated can be on the order of a square centimeter, depending on stimulation strength. For any coil shape, there is a fundamental trade-off between stimulation focality and depth, with larger coils having a deeper but less focal E-field (Deng et al., 2013; Gomez et al., 2018; Peterchev et al., 2015).\n\nLikewise, increasing the coil current deepens and spreads out the stimulation. Double-cone (or angled butterfly/double) coils are a larger version of figure-8 coils where the two circular windings are angled toward the subject’s head to increase the magnetic field strength in depth as well as the electrical efficiency. Consequently, the double-cone coil E-field penetrates deeper and is less focal than conventional figure-8 coils (Deng et al., 2014, 2013). Double-cone coils have been used to target various brain regions that may be difficult to reach with standard figure-8 coils, such as the leg motor area or medial prefrontal cortex, and were claimed to reach effectively the cingulate, insula, and cerebellum. In studies reviewed, no serious AEs such as seizures were reported (Ciampi de Andrade et al., 2012; Blumberger et al., 2018; Dunlop et al., 2015; Fernandez et al., 2018; Gerschlager et al., 2002; Grossheinrich et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2018; Kreuzer et al., 2015a; Kreuzer et al., 2015b; Modirrousta et al., 2015; Nauczyciel et al., 2014; Popa et al., 2010; Riehl, 2008; Ruohonen and Ilmoniemi, 2005; Sutter et al., 2015). Some double-cone coils have CE approval for use in Europe.\n\nH-coils are designed to induce an E-field penetrating deeper in the brain than typical figure-8 coils at the expense of reduced focality (Deng et al., 2013; Guadagnin et al., 2016; Parazzini et al., 2017; Tendler et al., 2016). While the H1 and H7 coils that are part of FDA-cleared systems are discussed in Section 4.1.2, other H-coils are considered new by our definition. When other (non-FDA approved) H-coils were used, no serious AEs such as seizures were reported (Avirame et al., 2016; Carmi et al., 2018; Cervigni et al., 2018; Chieffo et al., 2014, 2014b; Cohen et al., 2016; Coppi et al., 2016; Dinur-Klein et al., 2014; Enticott et al., 2011; Gersner et al., 2016; Kranz et al., 2010; Onesti et al., 2013; Shahar et al., 2015; Shimizu et al., 2017; Spagnolo et al., 2014; Torres et al., 2015; Vazana et al., 2016). It should be noted that the winding configuration of some H-coils, including H3, H6, H7, and H10 somewhat resembles double-cone coils (Peterchev et al., 2015; Tendler et al., 2016). Therefore, after assessing similarity by comparing the induced E-fields, safety data from double-cone coil trials could potentially be used to inform the safety of comparable H-coils, and vice versa.\n\nOther unconventional devices and paradigms include a pair of coils or coil arrays for multi-coil stimulation (Roth et al., 2014). In the latter case, one needs to analyze the safety issues that arise from the ability to stimulate two or more targets at the same time or with short time intervals. One such study used a pair of V-shaped coils activated synchronously at two sites in 43 patients to treat depression, without any reported seizures or other unexpected TMS-related AEs (Carpenter et al., 2017; Kavanaugh et al., 2018). A study of 16 subjects with four simultaneously activated V-shaped coils reported no serious AEs either (Tzabazis et al., 2013). Another study used a pair of H6 coils, activated synchronously at 10 Hz over the left PFC and 1 Hz over the right PFC, in 47 patients suffering from depression, with no reported seizures or other SAE (Harel et al., 2018). New types of TMS paradigms will be possible with multi-locus TMS devices (Koponen et al., 2018), which allow stimulation sequences with multiple arbitrarily located targets and arbitrary E-field directions, time differences, and intensities. At present, no significant data on safety for such multi-coil stimulation is available. Another recent technical advance is the computational design of coils that are more focal than figure-8 coils for a matched depth of stimulation (Gomez et al., 2018). This approach could potentially increase the precision of stimulation and reduce side effects; however, these designs have not been evaluated in human subjects yet.\n\n2.6.4. Other paradigms of stimulation (Low field magnetic stimulation; transcranial static magnetic stimulation)\n\nLow-field magnetic stimulation\n\nLow-field magnetic stimulation refers to TMS paradigms that induce E-field pulses of very low amplitude, generally below 10% of the neural activation threshold (Deng and Lisanby, 2017; Wang et al., 2018). Some low-field paradigms, for which there is evidence of neuromodulatory effects, are derived from MRI gradient sequences (Cook et al., 2019; Dubin et al., 2017). Other approaches use even lower electromagnetically-induced E-field intensities and frequencies (Capone et al., 2009; Martiny et al., 2010). Finally, low-intensity E-fields have also been induced with rotating permanent magnets, with evidence for neuromodulatory effects as well (Cook et al., 2019). These studies reported no AEs resulting from the electromagnetic stimulation. This is consistent with the fact that both the magnetic fields and E-fields were lower than those in conventional TMS and would therefore be expected to carry less risk. Moreover, for the paradigms derived from MRI gradient sequences, the extensive experience with the safety of MRI supports a low-risk profile. The literature of transcranial alternating current stimulation and cranial electrotherapy stimulation (Antal and Paulus, 2013; Chaieb et al., 2014, 2011; Zaghi et al., 2010) may also be relevant in risk analysis of low-field magnetic stimulation, since these techniques share some E-field characteristics, especially its subthreshold and pulsed/alternating nature.\n\nTranscranial static magnetic stimulation (tSMS)\n\nIt has been reported that a sufficiently long exposure to static magnetic fields on the order of hundreds of millitesla can alter cortical excitability (Carrasco-Lopez et al., 2017; Dileone et al., 2018; Gonzalez-Rosa et al., 2015; Kirimoto et al., 2018, 2016, 2014; Lozano-Soto et al., 2018; Oliviero et al., 2011). These magnetic fields are approximately ten times lower than those in MRI scanners (Rivadulla et al., 2014; Tharayil et al., 2018), which are well-characterized in terms of safety (Schenck, 2000). No safety concerns related to the magnetic field exposure of tSMS have been reported (Oliviero et al., 2015). However, there are very strong forces exerted between the permanent magnets used for tSMS as well as between the magnets and other ferromagnetic objects. As a result of these forces, in one instance, a tSMS magnet operator sustained a clean break of two different phalanx bones in two fingers (Antonio Oliviero and Casto Rivadulla, personal communication, June 12, 2018); another one squeezing of two fingers that resulted in bleeding (Andrea Antal, personal communication, July, 2016). Therefore, permanent magnets for tSMS should be handled with extreme caution. As is the case for the static magnetic field of MRI scanners, the strong localized magnetic field of tSMS can also affect implants that contain magnets (such as cochlear implants) or ferromagnetic materials, or that are otherwise sensitive to magnetic fields. The use of tSMS nearby such devices must therefore follow strict safety precautions.\n\n2.6.5. Role of neuroimaging in improving TMS safety\n\nThe combination of TMS with brain imaging has become common, if not standard, in research settings (Fox et al., 2012; Siebner et al., 2009) including large-scale clinical trials of rTMS for depression (Blumberger et al., 2018; George et al., 2010). Neuroimaging may help to improve patient selection (Drysdale et al., 2017), targeting (Fitzgerald et al., 2009; Fox et al., 2013; George et al., 2010; Opitz et al., 2016; Sack et al., 2009), and efficacy of TMS (Fitzgerald et al., 2009; Sack et al., 2009; Weigand et al., 2018). Therefore, an important question is whether neuroimaging can improve TMS safety, although neuroimaging is currently still rarely used in clinical practice (McClintock et al., 2013).\n\nThe use of neuroimaging is not necessary for most patients undergoing TMS unless neuronavigation software will be used for precision targeting. However, it should be considered in patients with structural brain abnormalities such as stroke, tumor, or multiple sclerosis and when the stimulation targets a brain region outside the motor cortex. Although the absolute risk of seizure remains low (Gaede et al., 2018; Jorge et al., 2004; Tarapore et al., 2016), there are cases in which TMS delivered close to brain lesions has induced seizure (Cogné et al., 2017; Groiss et al., 2017; Haupts et al., 2004). Neuroimaging can help avoid these lesion locations, improving safety without sacrificing clinical benefit (Caulfield et al., 2017). Structural MRI can inform realistic modelling of the E-field distribution in the brain, which can help predict how stimulated tissue may change in the setting of structural abnormalities (Wagner et al., 2008, 2006). Finally, neuroimaging may allow for individual adjustment of stimulation intensity, accounting for factors such as scalp-to-cortex distance that vary across different stimulation sites (Kozel et al., 2000; McConnell et al., 2001; Nahas et al., 2001; Nathou et al., 2015; Stokes et al., 2013, 2007, 2005). Indeed, adjustment of the rTMS intensity based on the individual scalp-to-cortex distance at the target site has been deployed in clinical trials (Blumberger et al., 2016; Koch et al., 2018).\n\nNeuroimaging and E-field modeling on an individual basis is recommended by the National Institute of Mental Health for any application of TMS as well as with TES to standardize coil placement and orientation, and to control for individual variation in delivered dose with the goal of improving the rigor and reproducibility of non invasive brain stimulation studies (Bikson et al., 2018; McMullen, 2018).\n\nIn theory, neuroimaging and increased neuroanatomical precision should lead to a reduction in off-target side effects and improved TMS safety, and therefore it should be recommended. The benefit of increased precision is evident comparing the side effects profile of TMS to non-focal electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), where AEs are due to the intense non-focal stimulation and generalzed seizure induction. However, improved neuroanatomical precision is only useful if one knows where one needs to stimulate to improve a target symptom and where one should avoid stimulating to avoid side effects. As these neuroanatomical targets become clearer (Fitzgerald et al., 2009; Fox et al., 2013; Weigand et al., 2018), neuroimaging is likely to take a stable place for therapeutic TMS applications.\n\n2.6.6. Image-guided frameless navigation and robots for improving TMS safety: an emerging issue\n\nFrameless navigation systems have been developed to integrate anatomical or functional brain imaging of subjects or patients to optimize the placement of the TMS coil on a defined target over their cortex (Ruohonen and Karhu, 2010). Navigation systems dedicated to MRI-based neuronavigated TMS (nTMS) practice have shown their reliability to determine cortical target location and to improve the reproducibility of coil placement throughout serial rTMS sessions (Lefaucheur, 2010). Only few comparative studies specifically addressed this issue, showing the beneficial impact of navigated (nTMS) versusnon-navigated rTMS protocols (Ayache et al., 2016; Bashir et al., 2011; Fitzgerald et al., 2009; Sack et al., 2009). However, these systems need to be further evaluated both in terms of risk-benefit ratio and therapeutic effectiveness\n\nOne of the most important areas of development of nTMS, with an increasing clinical use, is the cortical mapping of language and motor functions in preoperative time, especially in patients with brain tumors (Lefaucheur and Picht, 2016). For motor mapping, single TMS pulses above the RMT are delivered over the rolandic region (Picht et al., 2011, 2009), while brief rTMS trains are used to induce speech arrest or errors for language mapping (Picht et al., 2013). The accuracy of these methods was demonstrated in comparison to intraoperative direct cortical stimulation, which is the gold standard in this domain (Picht et al., 2013, 2011). One study (Tarapore et al., 2016) addressed both tolerability and safety issues of motor and language mapping procedures performed in 733 patients with brain tumors, 50% of whom with a history of seizures due to the brain lesion. The nTMS mapping procedure was found to produce discomfort in 5.1% of the cases for motor mapping and 23.4% for language mapping, and pain in 0.4% of the cases for motor mapping and 69.5% for language mapping. However, although patients had a high risk for seizures, no seizures occurred during the procedures. In fact, in the rest of the literature, there is also no reported seizure with this practice. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that the nTMS approach allows motor or language mapping to be safely performed, at least according to the specific methods currently used in the studies mentioned above.\n\nTo further improve the reliability and repeatability of TMS coil positioning, the use of a robot to hold the coil, combined with image-guided navigation has been proposed. To our knowledge, only three robots are commercially distributed specifically for rTMS practice, which are the Smartmove™ (ANT, Enschede, Netherlands), the TMS-Cobot™ and the TMS-Robot™ (Axilum Robotics, Strasbourg, France), the last one being the only one robot specially developed for TMS use and not derived from an “industrial” environment (Ginhoux et al., 2013; Zorn et al., 2012). These robots used either a dedicated neuronavigation system (ANT) or are compatible with various commercial TMS navigation systems (Axilum Robotics). It is estimated that about 40 robotized nTMS systems are installed worldwide, of which more than 10 are used for therapeutic applications (data courtesy of Axilum Robotics).\n\nTo date, only a few studies have reported results obtained in patients who underwent repeated sessions of robotized nTMS (Lefaucheur et al., 2017; Pommier et al., 2016; Quesada et al., 2018, 2020). In fact, most studies aimed at describing the accuracy of more or less automated motor mapping procedures using robotized nTMS (Finke et al., 2008; Grab et al., 2018; Harquel et al., 2017; Kantelhardt et al., 2010; Matthäus et al., 2006; Meincke et al., 2016, 2018; Grab et al., 2018; Goetz et al., 2019; Giuffre et al., 2019). Thus, it has been shown that the use of a robot improves accuracy and repeatability of TMS targeting and motor mapping versus manual procedures (Ginhoux et al., 2013; Lancaster et al., 2004; Richter et al., 2013).\n\nMost safety issues for using robots in TMS practice are related to various regulatory, mechanical, electrical, and software aspects, as discussed in Sections 2.1–2.3, 2.5 for any new device. Mechanical safety aspects are managed by either limiting the motion of the robot to an acceptable workspace, limiting motion speed or by adding force or torque sensors to detect a collision with the environment of the robot. Trajectory planning and execution remains challenging tasks, as motion must be restricted to avoid hitting the patient’s head or the environment while the robot aligns the coil on the head. For TMS, a small workspace could be a limitation. To this regard, systems based on standard industrial-type robots are often more limited compared to dedicated architectures (Zorn et al., 2012).\n\nThe noise level emitted by the system, the pressure exerted by the coil handled by the robot on the head of the patient are also important features, as untimely movements of the patient or unpleasantness due to acoustic or musculoskeletal discomfort should not force the cessation of stimulation. Electronic safety is ensured by electrical isolation and emergency buttons, which are usually accessible to the patient or the operator to stop any ongoing robot motion. Specific safety issues must be considered if the robot system is connected to the TMS stimulator, automatically triggering the pulses when the target position is reached and contact with the head is confirmed. Finally, when used in combination with EEG or EMG, attention has to be paid to avoid any electromagnetic interference while acquiring the signals.\n\nRobots are usually coupled with a navigation or 3D-targeting system to help the user to define a specific stimulation target. The usual precision of targeting is in the range of a few mm, taking into account the flexibility of the robot arm, the accuracy of the navigation system, and the method of manual registration, which needs an input from the operator (i.e. a possible source of human error). The risk of targeting and stimulating a wrong cortical region due to poor accuracy of the system itself is limited, as position feedback from the motors or by an external 3D sensor (usually a camera) ensures very low risk of positioning error. Some systems require the addition of optical markers on the coil or the robotic arm to adjust their position in real-time using a feedback control loop. This reduces any residual errors from the positioning system.\n\nThus, the main requirement for robot use in TMS practice is the need to maintain coil contact with the head at a given position and with a given orientation during a whole session of TMS pulse delivery. Systems may include a pressure or force sensor that measures if the coil is actually in close contact with head surface, so that the coil-to-head distance is maintained at the lowest value. The lack of pressure feedback is an acknowledged limitation of some robotic systems (Goetz et al., 2019). To conclude, a robotized nTMS procedure offers simplified positioning of the coil on the head, limits human bias and operator exposure to magnetic field, and allows for real-time compensation of head motion to increase targeting accuracy while the stimulation is executed.\n\nA yet unexplored but timely and plausible advantage of robot-guided TMS can be the reduction of the risk of human-to-human transmission of infections.\n\n3. Safety in combination with other devices\n\n3.1. MRI environment\n\nTMS can be combined with a wide range of brain mapping modalities based on MRI. The combined use of TMS with MRI or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has great clinical and neuroscientific potential (Siebner et al., 2009; Bestmann and Feredoes, 2013; Hallett et al., 2017). For example, it can capture TMS-induced changes in tissue concentrations of relevant molecules such as glutamate or GABA in brain regions of interest. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) can help to link TMS-induced plasticity to regional changes in brain microstructure and to derive information about the structural connectivity of the targeted brain region. TMS can also be combined with functional MRI (fMRI) to delineate immediate and longer lasting effects of the TMS intervention on regional brain activity as well as functional connectivity within and among brain networks (Bestmann et al., 2008; Ruff et al., 2009). In addition, fMRI can be used as functional localizer to identify the optimal cortical target. DWI and fMRI can also reveal brain regions that are indirectly stimulated by TMS through spread of excitation along pre-existing neuronal connections.\n\nIn the majority of combined TMS-MRI or TMS-MRS studies, TMS and MR-based mapping are strictly separated in space and time. TMS is given “offline” outside the scanner environment before or after the MR session. In these instances, standard safety procedures for TMS and MR-based examinations apply without any additional safety concerns. This is different for TMS studies in which TMS is delivered in the MR scanner room to probe acute changes in human brain function during or shortly before and after TMS. In this case, specific safety concerns apply; we refer to our previous consensus paper on TMS safety for a comprehensive list of specific precautions (Rossi et al., 2009; Siebner et al., 2009). Importantly, only dedicated TMS coils whose use is approved inside the scanner must be used. The TMS coil must not contain ferromagnetic material and must be able to cope with the increased mechanical stress caused by the Lorentz forces, which the static magnetic field of the MR scanner creates on the coil windings during the discharge of the TMS pulses. The number of total pulses that can be applied by the MR-conditional TMS coil, which is currently commercially available, has been restricted by the vendor. Once this number is reached, the coil is blocked and needs to be returned to the vendor. This precaution has been implemented to secure that the integrity of the coil, including the wires and their insulation, is not endangered over time due to the increased mechanical stress levels. Finally, while MRI-comparible coils have a standard figure-8 configuration and magnetic field pattern, the intensity and focality of the field may be reduced compared to conventional coils due to thicker casing (Koponen et al., 2018; Nieminen et al., 2015). Therefore, the difference in absolute field strength and motor thresholds with different coils should be accounted for to maintain safety and efficacy\n\nRecommendations: TMS coils dedicated for use in the MR scanner are currently only approved for MR systems with a magnet that produces a static field of 3T or less. They cannot be used in MR systems that have higher field strength than 3T. This also applies to a recently developed combined TMS-MR-coil design where the TMS coil is integrated into a multi-channel MR receiving coil (de Weijer et al., 2014; Lara et al., 2015).\n\n3.2. Implanted or non-removable intracranial metal or devices\n\n3.2.1. Heating\n\nThe heating produced by TMS in the brain is estimated to be very small (less than 0.1 °C) and this should not pose any safety issue (Brix et al., 2002; Ruohonen and Ilmoniemi, 2005). TMS can also induce currents in skin electrodes and implants that can heat them (Rotenberg et al., 2007; Roth et al., 1992). The heating depends on the structure, size, electrical conductivity, and placement of the electrode or implant, the geometrical and conductivity characteristics of the tissue it contacts, and the TMS coil configuration and pulse characteristics. Electrodes made of silver and gold have high conductivity and can heat up substantially, potentially leading to skin burns. Skin burns can be caused by temperature of 50 C for 100 s or 55 C for 10 s (Roth et al., 1992). Low-conductivity plastic electrodes are less prone to heating up. As well, radial slits that impede induced currents can reduce heating in electrodes and skull plates. Titanium skull plates tend to have low heating since this metal has low conductivity and the plates are either small in size or have radial slits (Rotenberg et al., 2007). Similarly, titanium rods for spinal implants showed no significant temperature change when exposed to magnetic stimulation (Petrosyan et al., 2015).\n\nMetallic brain implants could heat up as well. Heating of brain tissue over 43°C can cause irreversible damage (Matsumi et al., 1994). Ex vivo studies with rTMS applied over implantable electrodes found no significant heating (Phielipp et al., 2017; Shimojima et al., 2010). Likewise, rTMS applied over vascular stents placed in gelled saline detected temperature increase below 1°C which is considered safe (Varnerin et al., 2017).\n\nWhen there are electrodes or implants in the vicinity of the TMS coil, risk analysis should be conducted to assess the possibility of excessive heating (see Section 2.1). This analysis can be based on manufacturer data, results in the literature, theoretical calculations, simulations, and/or measurements. If measurements are conducted, ex vivo testing may be sufficient for the risk analysis. But sometimes it may be important to consider the electrical and thermal properties of the tissues in contact with the implant which would require modeling and/or in vivo testing. Sharing of the results of such safety analyses with the community via publications is encouraged.\n\n3.2.2. Forces and magnetization\n\nTMS pulses generate a magnetic field that exerts attractive forces on ferromagnetic objects as well as repulsive forces on non-ferromagnetic conducting objects. Thus, some head implants could experience forces and even be displaced by TMS. Ferromagnetic objects tend to experience larger electromagnetic forces than non-ferromagnetic conductors. Titanium skull plates, rods, and aneurysm clips do not appear to experience significant forces due to TMS (Petrosyan et al., 2015; Pridmore and Lawson, 2017; Rotenberg et al., 2007). This is because titanium is non-ferromagnetic and has relatively low electrical conductivity, and larger titanium plates tend to have slits. Similarly, it has been estimated that movement of a stainless steel aneurysm clip due to a TMS pulse is very small and unlikely to produce clinical complications (Barker, 1991). A modeling study suggested that mechanical movements induced by TMS in implanted electrodes, such as electrodes used for electrocorticography, are well below the limit for tissue damage (Golestanirad et al., 2012). This is consistent with the findings of ex-vivo studies that applied TMS over implantable cortical or deep electrodes and found no significant displacement (Phielipp et al., 2017; Shimojima et al., 2010). Cochlear or other implants incorporating a magnet could move or demagnetize when exposed to a TMS pulse. Eye makeup containing ferromagnetic particles may contribute to facial pain during rTMS with frontal coil placements potentially due to local heating or electric current concentration near skin receptor/trigeminal fibers (Redolar-Ripoll et al., 2015). While no data have been reported on permanent makeup (e.g. for alopecia) or scalp tatoos, they may contain ferromagnetic and/or conductive particles such as iron oxide or metalcontaining ink which may interact with the TMS induced magnetic field, but with no risk to induce SAE.\n\nSimilar to risk analyses for heating, the possibility of significant forces and/or movement on implants should be assessed. In many cases, simple ex vivo ballistic pendulum measurements can indicate the presence of significant forces (Barker, 1991; Pridmore and Lawson, 2017). Potentially conducting or ferromagnetic objects, such as hearing devices, or materials worn on the head, including piercings, jewelry and glasses, should be removed if they can interact with the TMS magnetic field.\n\n3.2.3. Induced electrode current\n\nThe TMS coil emits strong magnetic pulses that can induce high voltages and currents in adjacent wires and electronic devices. Wires connecting to surface electrodes, for example in EEG and TES, should be arranged to minimize loops that are coupled to the magnetic field and result in electromagnetically induced voltages and currents. Specifically, the wires should be arranged to be close or twisted together, without looping either between wires or of the whole wire bundle (Peterchev et al., 2012). Electronic implants, including systems for deep brain stimulation (DBS) or cochlear implants and subdural/epidural electrode arrays for cortical stimulation, contain intracranial electrodes connected to wires under the scalp. Spinal and cranial nerve stimulators, such as devices for vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), have subcutaneous wires too. Electrical currents can be induced in these electrode wires during the delivery of TMS, regardless of whether the implant is turned on or off; this can produce unintended stimulation in the central or peripheral nervous system (Hidding et al., 2006; Kühn et al., 2002). These induced currents may affect safety compared to TMS with no implant.\n\nSeveral ex vivo studies have specifically addressed the safety of the voltages induced in DBS, cortical, and VNS electrodes by TMS. Generally, two types of measurements have been reported: (1) induced voltages or currents between a pair of electrode contacts or a pair of lead wire contacts that connect to the implanted pulse generator (IPG), and (2) induced voltages or currents between an electrode contact and the IPG case or the IPG-side connector of the lead. The first type of measurements in DBS and VNS devices have detected relatively low voltages of <2.8 V at 100% TMS device output (Kühn et al., 2004; Kühn and Huebl, 2011; Kumar et al., 1999; Schrader et al., 2005). The second type of measurements in deep as well as cortical electrodes have identified substantially higher voltages ranging from 15–100 V with 100% TMS device output, depending on the specific setup (Deng et al., 2010; Phielipp et al., 2017; Shimojima et al., 2010). The latter measurements are more relevant to safety, since they are orders of magnitude higher than the former. The physical reason for these differences in the induced voltage magnitudes is that the circuit formed by the electrodes, lead wires, IPG, and conductive tissue path back to the electrodes constitutes a loop with a significantly larger area than the circuit formed by the wires connecting pairs of electrode contacts, which are very close to each other (Deng et al., 2010). Critical factors for the magnitude of the induced voltage are the TMS coil proximity to the lead as well as the number of lead loops. The highest voltages are induced when the center of the TMS coil is over the subcutaneous lead and the induced current orientation (e.g. axis between the two loops of a figure-8 coil) is aligned with the lead or when the TMS coil loops are centered over loops in the electrode lead (Deng et al., 2010; Shimojima et al., 2010). Depending on its size, each turn of a lead loop can contribute 16–28 V at 100% TMS intensity (Deng et al., 2010; Phielipp et al., 2017; Shimojima et al., 2010). The voltage induced in a lead loop can be calculated by the formula Vind = (π∙B∙Aloop)/(2∙tr), where B is the magnetic field (flux density) penetrating a loop with area Aloop, and tr is the rise time of the magnetic pulse (Mueller et al., 2014). Importantly, IPGs can conduct electrical current even if they are turned off, resulting in induced currents that are injected through the electrode contacts. Nevertheless, having the IPG off can offer some protection from induced currents, since the IPG may not conduct until the induced voltage reaches as high as 5 V, whereas it conducts for any induced voltage when on (Deng et al., 2010). The induced electrode current can be calculated by the formula Ielec = (Vind – VIPG)/ Relec, where VIPG is the IPG voltage drop which is typically negligible in on state but can be a few volts in off state, and Relec is the electrode impedance.\n\nThe voltages and currents induced by TMS in implanted stimulator electrodes can match and exceed the stimuli normally generated by the implant which are typically <10 V and <10 mA. Therefore, the safety of the induced currents should be assessed with respect to not only unintended neuromodulation, but also the potential for tissue damage. While strict limits have not been established, some implanted stimulator manufacturers specify a maximum allowable charge density of 30 μC/cm2/phase (Shimojima et al., 2010). For conventional sinusoidal TMS pulses, charge per phase through the electrode is calculated as Qelec = 2∙Ielec∙tr/π for monophasic pulses and twice that amount for biphasic pulses, and charge density per phase is Qelec/Aelec, where Aelec is the electrode surface area. A more sophisticated approach accounts for both charge per phase (in μC) as well as charge density per phase (in μC/cm2) according to the formula k = log(Qelec/Aelec) + log(Qelec), with evidence for no histological damage for k < 1.85 and potentially higher (Phielipp et al., 2017). Both of these limits can be exceeded for certain configurations of the TMS device and the implanted stimulator, in particular when the TMS coil is close to the lead, there is looping in the electrode lead under the coil, and high TMS pulse intensities are used (Shimojima et al., 2010; Phielipp et al., 2017).\n\nThese considerations may apply in some cases when the electrode leads are externalized and connected to an external stimulator or an amplifier for electrophysiological recordings. While bioamplifiers typically have very high input impedance, if a large voltage is induced in the leads, the amplifier input impedance may drop essentially to zero due to clamping of the input protection diodes to the internal power supply rails. Moreover, loops through reference or ground leads connected to the patient may inject currents as well. As with any external wiring in the vicinity of the TMS coil, inductive loops should be minimized by bundling and twisting wires/leads together and placing them as far as possible from the TMS coil. Ideally the amplifier input or external stimulator output should be electrically isolated from earth ground.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that burr holes or other openings in the skull do not affect significantly the E-field delivered to the brain by TMS. This is due to the fact that TMS induces an E-field that is primarily tangential to the scalp surface; therefore, openings in the skull generally do not result in additional current injected in the brain. This is in marked contrast to transcranial electrical stimulation which injects significant radial currents throught the skull and is therefore strongly affected by skull openings (Deng et al., 2010).\n\n3.2.4. Malfunction or damage of electronic implants\n\nThe TMS electromagnetic pulse can also damage electronic implants near the coil. Ex vivo studies showed that TMS with the coil at a distance of 2–10 cm could cause malfunction of a DBS IPG, and distances of 2 cm or less could lead to permanent damage of the IPG (Kumar et al., 1999; Kühn et al., 2004). However, another study reported that VNS IPG was not damaged by TMS pulses (Schrader et al., 2005). TMS over a DBS electrode lead can shut off the IPG, presumably due to voltages induced across the IPG through the electrode lead, but no damage to the IPG was reported (Ni et al., 2018).\n\nCochlear implants involve an electrode implanted in the cochlea, a magnet, a loop antenna, and an electronic chip under the scalp. Although there are no reports on TMS being performed in people with cochlear implants, it may be unsafe based on physics considerations. TMS can damage the electronic chip, cause movement or demagnetize the permanent magnet or induce high voltages in the loop antenna. In addition, most cochlear implants are not compatible with MRI, although some newer models are. Therefore, unless additional safety evaluation showed that there are no AEs, TMS should be avoided in subjects with cochlear implants.\n\n3.2.5. TMS in patients with implanted stimulating/recording electrodes\n\nMany TMS studies have been performed in patients with implanted electrodes in the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves for the treatment of migraine, chronic pain syndromes, movement disorders (Parkinson’s disease, tremor and dystonia), epilepsy, or psychiatric diseases (depression or obsessive- compulsive disorder). Most of them involved single or paired pulse TMS (ppTMS) and some used repetitive TMS (see Supplemental Material, Table S1). The main purposes of these studies were to:\n\nDetermine the effects of TMS on the brain or spinal cord by recording TMS-evoked responses or changes in spontaneous electrophysiological signals induced by TMS using the implanted electrodes;\n\nDetermine the effects of stimulation through the implanted electrodes on the central nervous system by measuring TMS-evoked responses;\n\nEvaluate the effects produced by paired stimulation combining TMS with DBS;\n\nThe first study of TMS in patients with implanted electrodes involved four patients with spinal cord stimulators. TMS was applied with the device turned on or off, and no AE was observed (Kofler et al., 1991). Subsequent studies involved patients implanted with five main types of electrodes: (1) epidural cortical or spinal cord electrodes; (2) subdural cortical electrodes; (3) DBS electrodes; (4) nerve stimulation electrodes over peripheral or cranial nerves (e.g., vagus nerve); or (5) cardiac pacemakers (Supplemental Material, Table S1). Some studies were conducted when the leads of the electrode were externalized, usually within several days after electrode implantation and before the electrode was connected to the IPG. Other studies involved patients with chronic, implanted devices with the leads connected to IPGs. Two of these studies in patients with DBS electrodes showed that TMS can induce lead currents that led to motor responses (Kühn et al., 2002; Hidding et al., 2006). This is likely due to induced currents between the electrode contacts and the IPG case. In a study with 5 patients with dystonia and DBS electrodes in the globus pallidus internus, the authors suggested that TMS induced currents in the subcutaneous wire loops, which activated the corticospinal tract subcortically near the DBS site, eliciting motor responses in hand muscles (Kühn et al., 2002). Another study reported similar findings in 8 patients with Parkinson’s disease who had subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS electrodes with leads connected to an IPG (Hidding et al., 2006). After the implantation, the latencies of the MEP in the relaxed first dorsal interosseous muscle were shorter compared to latencies before the operation. This decreased corticomotor conduction time was likely due to inadvertent stimulation of the corticospinal tract near the STN from current induced in the scalp leads near the TMS coil, connecting the IPG with STN electrodes. Importantly, no AEs were reported in these studies (Kühn et al., 2002; Hidding et al., 2006). Another study found that the MEP latencies induced by TMS varied with current directions as expected and were longer than the latencies of motor responses evoked by increasing the intensities of STN DBS. There was no evidence of activation of the corticospinal fibers in the vicinity of the STN by TMS in that study (Kuriakose et al., 2010). Some of these differences could be related to the TMS coil position relative to the electrode leads and if there was coiling of the lead in the scalp (Shimojima et al., 2010; Phielipp et al., 2017). However, TMS over the electrode lead can shut off the IPG, although no AEs in patients or damage to pulse generators have been reported (Ni et al., 2018). A patient with intractable neuropathic pain and motor cortical subdural electrodes was safely treated with rTMS over the M1 following ex-vivo studies (Phielipp et al., 2017).\n\nPhilip et al. (2014) pooled information on the use of rTMS in 20 patients with VNS implants across 17 medical centers. All centers used TMS systems with focal figure-8 coils. None of the sites reported any unique AE in VNS patients undergoing rTMS therapy. This safety profile is supported theoretically by the significant distance between the TMS coil and the VNS implant.\n\nThere are two reports of TMS in patients with a cardiac pacemaker. One patient with depression was treated with rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Hizli Sayar et al., 2016) and another patient with migraine was treated with single pulse TMS to the occipital cortex (Wei et al., 2018). No AE was reported.\n\nTMS studies have been carried out safely in patients with implanted electrodes for epidural spinal cord stimulation or DBS during the period of externalization of the leads prior to their connection to the IPG (see Supplemental Material, Table S1).\n\nFinally, TMS has been considered safe in patients with pressure-programmable valves to treat hydrocephalus; however, it is recommended to check the valve settings after a TMS session (Lefranc et al., 2010).\n\n3.2.6. Conclusions and recommendations\n\nEx vivo studies and studies in patients showed that TMS can be safely applied in patients with implanted stimulators in the central or peripheral nervous system. In summary: TMS with figure-8coils is considered safe in individuals with cardiac pacemakers, VNS systems, and spinal cord stimulators if the TMS coil is not activated close to (<10 cm) electronic components such as the IPG located in the neck or torso. Caution should be taken to avoid accidental firing of the TMS coil near electronic implants.\n\nTMS can also be conducted safely in patients with implanted electrodes in the central and peripheral nervous system that are not connected to an IPG; care should be taken to minimize the currents induced in any connections to external stimulators or amplifiers. Implants in the head that are MRI safe are more likely to be TMS safe than those that are not MRI safe.\n\nIn patients with DBS or cortical stimulation electrodes, TMS can induce currents in the electrode leads which could cause unintended stimulation: this may be a potential safety hazard. Therefore, when such systems are implanted, lead loops should be avoided if possible or wound with each turn circling in opposite direction (e.g. one turn clockwise and the next turn counterclockwise) in order to minimize electromagnetic induction.\n\nIf possible, TMS should be applied away from the electrode leads, particularly leads with loops. Specifically, it is desirable to minimize the magnetic coupling between the TMS coil and the electrode lead, i.e. minimize the magnetic flux encircled by the lead wire. For individual patients, this can be assessed by personnel with appropriate engineering or physics background based on information about the implant spatial configuration, e.g. from X-rays or detailed surgical records. While many studies have been conducted with the IPG on during TMS without AEs (Supplemental Material, Table S1), turning the IPG off during TMS confers some protection against induced electrode currents and should be considered in the overall risk/benefit analysis. TMS should start with low intensity and gradually increase to the desired intensity. If there is the potential of increased seizure risk due to expanded neural recruitment from induced currents through electrodes, for example during high-frequency rTMS and with cortical electrodes, EMG should be monitored for spread of excitation and afterdischarges. TMS in patients with DBS or cortical stimulators should only be done if there are justifiable scientific or medical reasons. There should be pre-specified protocols and oversight by IRB or Ethics Committee. Since TMS may be unsafe in subjects with cochlear implants, it should not be performed in these subjects unless thorough safety analysis is performed.\n\nFinally, it is important to evaluate new implant devices as they become available since their behavior may differ from what was reviewed here. As both TMS and implants are becoming more common and approved for treating a wider range of disorders, implant device manufacturers should consider compatibility with TMS at the design or characterization stage.\n\n3.3. tDCS/tACS/tRNS\n\nGenerally, the rationale for the combination of rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) protocols is to utilize mechanisms of priming or meta-plasticity to enhance the effect size of either of the protocols (Karabanov et al., 2015; Müller-Dahlhaus and Ziemann, 2015). In these studies, low intensity TES is applied in combination with rTMS either concomitantly or sequentially. Theoretically, the concomitant application of TES and rTMS or priming with tDCS or tACS might intensify the AEs of subsequent rTMS (Rossi et al., 2009).\n\nThe number of studies using these kinds of combination in healthy subjects (e.g., applying stimulation over the primary motor or visual cortices: anodal and cathodal tDCS with 1 or 1.5 mA intensity for 10–15 min combined with 1 or 5 Hz rTMS 100–600 pulses 85–130% of RMT or 100% AMT or 90 % phosphene threshold) is limited (Moliadze et al., 2003, 2010; Siebner et al., 2004; Lang et al., 2004, 2007; Cosentino et al., 2012; Bocci et al., 2014). Even though “safety” or reporting AEs were not a primary outcome measure, there are few studies in which tolerability and AEs are mentioned. No AEs were reported in any of the available studies.\n\nThere are a few studies in which a combination of intermittent theta burst (iTBS) or continuous theta burst (cTBS) and tACS were used, applying both TBS and tACS concurrently over M1 in order to enhance the modulation of cortical plasticity induced by TBS (Doeltgen et al., 2012; Goldsworthy et al., 2016; Guerra et al., 2018). No AEs were reported in any of these studies, but the evidence is insufficient due to the small sample sizes and since none of the studies had been designed to specifically evaluate safety.\n\nAs for pathological conditions, the combination of tDCS with rTMS has been investigated in patients with migraine (Antal et al., 2008), depression (Loo et al., 2009) and writer’s cramp (Quartarone et al., 2005) (e.g. anodal and cathodal tDCS over M1 with 1 or 1.5 mA intensity for 10–15 min combined with 1 or 5 Hz rTMS 100–900 pulses 85–130% of RMT), also with the aim to explore abnormal meta-plasticity usually reported in these disorders. None of the reviewed studies observed AEs apart from one pilot study that combined priming-tDCS with 10 Hz rTMS of DLPFC in patients with major depression (Loo et al., 2009). Here, patients experienced stronger scalp pain while receiving rTMS after tDCS, possibly due to increase scalp sensitivity, but no serious AE were reported.\n\nAs for the combination of single pulse TMS and tDCS/tACS/tRNS, a few investigations are available when considering either concurrent (e.g. Bergmann et al., 2009; Feurra et al., 2013, 2011; Groppa et al., 2010; Raco et al., 2017; Santarnecchi et al., 2014) or sequential application (e.g. (Antal et al., 2008; Moliadze et al., 2012; Romero Lauro et al., 2014; Terney et al., 2008; Varoli et al., 2018). As in the case of rTMS, no AE were reported, although safety-specific assessments were not carried out. Moreover, a recent study has investigated the effect of multifocal versus bifocal tDCS over M1, assessed via corticospinal excitability (i.e. single pulse TMS) at various time points before and after tDCS. A slightly lower rate of scalp itching, redness and burning sensation was reported during multifocal tDCS, possibly due to the higher number of scalp electrodes and resulting lower current density per electrode. Regardless, no differences in the perception of single pulse TMS were reported (Neri et al., 2020)\n\nRecommendations: the available evidence suggests that the combination of tDCS/tACS/tRNS and TMS/rTMS used up to now is safe, if technical risks from heating or magnetically induced currents through the TES electrodes are ruled out (see Section y.2).\n\n3.4. Drugs\n\nMany hundreds of thousands of patients have been treated with rTMS to prefrontal cortex for depression, or other cortical targets for many other neuropsychiatric diseases, since 2008. It is estimated that the majority of these were concurrently taking one or more psychotropic medications from multiple pharmacological classes. Systematic data are not available regarding the specific medications and adverse outcomes of patients treated with rTMS for depression in clinical settings. Nevertheless, despite the large numbers exposed to TMS in the past decade, no specific toxicities arising from the combination of rTMS with such medications have been identified. Moreover, the actual risk for induction of seizures may depend on additional, not yet specifically explored, factors; these are drug dose, speed of dose change (increase or decrease), combination with other CNS active drugs or other factors potentially contributing to lower the seizure threshold (i.e., sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption, marijuana therapeutic and recreational use).\n\nA number of medications have been reported to increase risk of seizure in clinical populations (Bhatti et al., 2017; Hitchings, 2016), and it was previously assumed that their use in combination with rTMS may confer heightened risk for seizure induction (Rossi et al., 2009). However, empirical evidence for this risk is lacking, and the observed seizure rate in rTMS patients is extremely low overall despite that the majority of them were on CNS-active medications. In a survey of researchers and clinicians performing sp/ppTMS or rTMS (Lerner et al., 2019), 19 seizures were reported in individuals at increased risk of seizure from all causes according to the previous guidelines (Rossi et al., 2009). These individuals underwent a collective total of 57185 rTMS sessions delivered within the previously published guidelines (Rossi et al., 2009). Among them, only three - all psychiatric patients free from anatomical lesions - were taking medications suspected of lowering the seizure threshold. Two seizures were reported in depressed individuals and one in a healthy individual on no medications. One seizure was reported in a healthy individual on an oral contraceptive.\n\nRecommendation: The previous TMS Safety guidelines advised caution in the application of TMS in persons taking medications known to lower seizure threshold. However, the currently available data showing low seizure rate no longer support this recommendation. However, documentation of concurrent intake of drugs and other potentially seizure threshold lowering factors (such as sleep deprivation, infection, alcohol consumption) during TMS application and systematic capture/reporting of side effect data are recommended to further inform the field.\n\n4.
