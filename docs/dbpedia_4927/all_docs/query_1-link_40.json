        "text": "Advance directives allow people to designate a health care agent and specify health care preferences for future medical situations (1). Advance directive laws were created in response to high-profile “right-to-die” legal cases, such as those of Nancy Cruzan and Karen Ann Quinlan, to protect patients’ rights of self-determination to decline life-sustaining treatments (1, 2). However, a fundamental tension exists between advance directive law and clinical practice.\n\nIn the clinical setting, advance directives often are used in conjunction with other forms of verbal or written communication of patients’ wishes. In contrast, advance directive law takes a strict, legal-transactional approach to advance care planning that is akin to signing a will. This approach has resulted in many legal requirements and restrictions to execute an advance directive. Moreover, each U.S. state and the District of Columbia has adopted its own statutes that govern advance directives, living wills, and durable powers of attorney for health care, resulting in profound variability (3).\n\nThe attempt to safeguard a patient’s right of self-determination through a legally driven process may have unintended consequences for patients (4). Although advance directives may stimulate discussions and reduce the stress of surrogate decision making (5–8), well-documented controversy exists over their clinical effectiveness, including their inability to affect clinicians’ and families’ understanding of patients’ preferences and the type of care received (9). Without a health care agent, the absence of an advance directive may result in undertreatment or overtreatment, yet advance directives often are not completed, especially among minority and disenfranchised populations (10). Advance directive legal requirements may actively impede people from engaging in advance care planning (11). Because of ongoing efforts at both state and federal levels to improve advance directive law (12–15), the unintended consequences of the current law on the clinical effectiveness of advance directives must be considered.\n\nWe describe unintended consequences of advance directive law that may prevent patients from making or communicating their end-of-life care preferences or having their preferences honored. We also discuss vulnerable patient subgroups who may be most affected by unintended consequences of specific laws, explain the effect of advance directive law on clinicians, and suggest changes to current law to improve the clinical effectiveness of advance directives.\n\nResults\n\nBarriers\n\nWe identified 5 overarching legal and content-related barriers: poor readability; health care agent restrictions; execution requirements (steps needed to make forms legally valid); inadequate reciprocity (acceptance of advance directives between states); and religious, cultural, and social inadequacies. summarizes these barriers, related case law or statute examples, and vulnerable populations particularly affected by these barriers. (available at www.annals.org) describes individual barriers for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We also identified physician immunity statutes that may profoundly affect patients and their families.\n\nAppendix Table 2\n\nStateProbate CodeReadability:\n\nMandatory Language\n\nRequirementsDPAHC RestrictionsExecution RequirementsReciprocity:\n\nLack of ReciprocityPersons Restricted From Being a\n\nDPAHCDomestic Partners\n\nNot Equal to\n\nSpouses as\n\nDefault\n\nSurrogatesRestrictions\n\non\n\nSurrogate\n\nAuthorityOral\n\nDirectives Not\n\nRecognized or\n\nAdditional\n\nRestrictionsConflicting Statutes/FormsWitness or Notary Signatures RequiredPersons Restricted From Being a\n\nWitnessAlabamaAla.

For example, some states, such as Ohio, require mandatory language to describe life-sustaining treatment and a 1700-word disclosure statement with warnings to patients (3). Other states, such as Oregon and Wisconsin, require the entire advance directive form to adhere to mandated legal language (3) ( and ).\n\nAlthough the Institute of Medicine recommends that health-related materials be written at or below a 6th-grade reading level (19), most advance directives are written above a 12th-grade level (17, 18) and are unavailable in many patients’ native languages (26). Furthermore, many directives contain ambiguous language, such as forgoing treatment if a condition is considered terminal or irreversible. Physicians, much less patients and their families, have been shown to have difficulty deciphering the meaning of these terms (29).\n\nApproximately 40% of the U.S. population reads at or below an 8th-grade level, and the mean reading level of older persons is a 5th-grade level (19). Being unable to read or understand advance directive forms threatens patients’ ability to understand their health care choices and may limit their ability to communicate their preferences. In fact, limited health literacy explains some of the racial or ethnic variability demonstrated in end-of-life preferences (30).\n\nHealth Care Agent or Default Surrogate Restrictions\n\nIn an attempt to prevent coercion, many states restrict who may serve as a health care agent ( and ), including primary clinicians, caseworkers, and persons working for the patient’s clinician or the care facility in which the patient resides. These restrictions occur in 37 states and the District of Columbia, but most states allow exceptions for immediate relatives.\n\nFurthermore, if a durable power of attorney for health care is not executed, most states also restrict who may serve as a default surrogate. Many states typically authorize next of kin in the following order of priority: spouse; adult children; parents; siblings; sometimes, the nearest living relative; and last, in about 20 states, a “close friend” ( and ).\n\nThe decision-making status of a patient’s domestic or same-sex partner is more complicated. Only 8 states (Arizona, Maine, Maryland, New York, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia) recognize domestic partners in their health decisions law (31). However, same-sex partners may be recognized as valid default surrogates through marriage (in California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and the District of Columbia) or explicit authorization in state statutes (in Arizona, Maryland, and New York). In other states, a domestic or same-sex partner may be considered a “close friend” at the end of the default priority list.\n\nIn most states, designated or default surrogates also have limited authority to consent to withdrawal or withhold life-sustaining treatments unless the patient is deemed to be in a terminal or persistent vegetative state (32). A few states, such as Oklahoma, have additional restrictions on withdrawal of artificial nutrition or hydration ( and ).\n\nRestrictions on who may serve as a health care agent have unintended consequences for the estimated 20% of homeless and uninsured persons (28, 33–35) and the 3% to 4% of older nursing home residents who cannot or do not wish to name a surrogate decision maker (24, 36). Homeless, institutionalized, socially isolated, disabled, or migratory patients often lack legally appropriate health care agents and frequently prefer to name their trusted case managers, social service providers, or physicians as surrogates (28, 35, 37). Health care agent restrictions may leave many isolated patients without advocates and potentially in the hands of court-appointed conservators who do not know these patients and may request treatment that is not in the patients’ best interests.\n\nIn addition, not recognizing same-sex or domestic partners in states’ health care decisions laws has unintended consequences for the 6 million Americans within these partnerships (38, 39). If these patients require medical care outside of the states that grant same-sex unions or recognize domestic partnerships, their partner may not be allowed to make medical decisions on their behalf. Because a patient’s same-sex or domestic partner often has greater knowledge of the patient’s values than statutorily recognized decision makers, such as estranged family (40, 41), presuming that the partner will “act in the patient’s best interest” (40) is reasonable. In this regard, having a patient’s same-sex or domestic partner act as his or her surrogate is morally and ethically justifiable and disregarding the partner’s input is unethical (40, 42).\n\nFurthermore, restrictions on the types of decisions that agents or surrogates can make also may prevent patients from having their wishes honored. Some states require documentation of the exact decisions that an agent can make, which may affect patients who prefer not to write attestations of their wishes in advance, such as racial or ethnic minority populations and people with limited literacy (43–45).\n\nExecution Requirements\n\nPatients must navigate many execution requirements, such as attainment of signatures and witnessing, for advance directives to be considered legally valid. Only 16 states recognize oral advance directives ( and ), and many of these states have additional execution requirements, such as witnessing. Furthermore, several states (for example, Missouri) have separate statutes governing living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care, resulting in separate forms and requirements and potential conflicts ( ). In addition, nearly all states require 2 witnesses to make advance directives legally valid, with 18 states permitting notarization as an alternative. However, North Carolina and West Virginia require both 2 witnesses and notarization. Furthermore, most states prohibit a patient’s appointed agent, spouse, relative, health care provider, or an employee of the provider from being able to act as a witness. Some states even exclude anyone considered to be an heir from acting as a witness ( and ).\n\nImproperly executed advance directives have caused patients’ documented wishes to be invalidated ( ). Even if physicians document a patient’s verbally expressed wishes, those wishes may not be honored because oral advance directives are not universally accepted. However, substantiated oral declarations are considered to be clear expressions of patients’ wishes and may provide the best evidence of their health care preferences (46). Ignoring such declarations may be legally justifiable but ethically problematic (40, 41).\n\nExecution barriers may most affect patients from culturally and socially diverse backgrounds or patients with limited literacy or English proficiency. These populations often prefer not to or cannot document their treatment preferences and may be unable to navigate all required paperwork (33).\n\nWitness restrictions may particularly affect socially isolated, unbefriended older adults, as well as patients who are homeless, institutionalized, or migratory and who often lack appropriate witnesses. Many disenfranchised patients also may not understand what a notary public is; know how to find one; or be able to pay for such services, which cost $0.50 in Wisconsin (47) and $10 in California (48).\n\nIn addition, a form of identification is required to use the services of a notary, which prevents patients without proper documentation from executing an advance directive. Finally, although some hospitals provide notary services, these are often unavailable during outpatient visits, potentially resulting in the completion of advance directives without a clinician’s input (11).\n\nInadequate Reciprocity\n\nReciprocity refers to whether an advance directive executed in one state will be accepted in another. Excluding Kentucky, Michigan, and Wyoming, 47 states and the District of Columbia have reciprocity laws. However, reciprocity laws ensure only that out-of-state directives be considered validly executed but do not ensure that the advance directive will be interpreted exactly the same way because of varying mandatory language, restrictions, and differences in how state statutes are interpreted (3). For example, a durable power of attorney for health care designated under Massachusetts law (49) includes the authority to withdraw life support (including artificial nutrition or hydration) and to consent to long-term care placement; whereas Wisconsin law requires that this authority be expressly documented ( and ).\n\nLack of reciprocity between states may most affect frail elderly people who live with various caregivers in different states, migrant and transient homeless patients, and persons who have the financial means to travel. Although court cases have shown that out-of-state advance directives may be enforceable as a clear expression of patients’ wishes, the acceptance of these directives is clinician-dependent and may require the financial, educational, and social means to retain legal counsel ( and ).\n\nReligious, Cultural, and Social Inadequacies\n\nAlthough the importance of providing culturally competent care is well recognized (50), standardized advance directive forms do not permit the expression of alternative religious, cultural, or social preferences. For example, almost all durable power of attorney for health care statutes anticipate the appointment of a single agent rather than a family unit, and most statutes require completion of a written directive instead of an oral one. In addition, cultural, religious, or social preferences, such as death rituals or religious health care beliefs, have not been in the purview of advance directive statutes and therefore are not incorporated in most advance directive forms. Lack of inclusion of alternative religious, cultural, or social preferences represents a Western, autonomy-oriented, educated cultural bias.\n\nThe U.S. population is becoming increasingly diverse (39), yet differing views on autonomy and shared decision making among religious and cultural groups are often not considered (50–52). Most advance directives ignore cultural differences regarding autonomy (such as the concept of family decision making) and individual preferences (such as whether patients want to be aware of their prognoses) (51, 53). Western cultures generally view autonomy as self-empowering, whereas members of other cultures, such as Latinos, Native Americans, and Asians, may view it as a burden, resulting in loss of hope (50, 52, 54). Cultural or religious rituals about body preparation after death also differ. Yet, advance directive forms do not include such choices, which are as important to patients as treatment preferences (55). Decisions based on culture, religion, or spirituality often reflect a patient’s inherent values and should be elicited and honored (40).\n\nAdvance directive forms also discourage documentation of alternative preferences, such as the desire of isolated older and homeless persons to document their willingness to go to a nursing home or an institution and to discuss the ethical disposal of their body after they die (24, 56). Furthermore, homeless patients often wish to document personal characteristics (for example, tattoos) that may aid health care providers in body identification, preventing an anonymous death (35). In addition, patients with physical disabilities often prefer to document what constitutes good quality of life and their concerns about premature withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (27, 57).\n\nBecause advance directive statues do not include cultural, religious, or social preferences, we identified few legal cases addressing these issues. The most prevalent cases involved adult Jehovah’s Witnesses whose wishes to refuse blood transfusions were not honored, even with legally executed directives ( ).\n\nLegal Protection for Clinicians\n\nIn addition to legal and content-related barriers of advance directive law, legal protection for clinicians may substantially affect patients and their families. Many states have provisions that enable physicians to presume the validity of an advance directive in the absence of actual knowledge that the directive is invalid ( , available at www.annals.org). Most states also have cumulative clauses that consider advance directives as only 1 method to express patients’ preferences and may allow for other expressions, such as oral directives. Furthermore, all states have immunity statutes that protect physicians from criminal or civil liability or disciplinary action if they are acting on information in an advance directive in “good faith.”\n\nAppendix Table 3\n\nStatutesExamplesPresumed validity of advance directive or appointed agent (except DC, FL, GA, KS, ME, NC, NH, NJ, NY, TX)In Idaho, the statute ID St § 39-4513(1) states, “No emergency medical services personnel, health care provider, facility, or individual employed by, acting as the agent of, or under contract with any such health care provider or facility shall be civilly or criminally liable or subject to discipline for unprofessional conduct for acts or omissions carried out or performed in good faith pursuant to the directives in a facially valid POLST form or living will or by the holder of a facially valid durable power of attorney or directive for health care.”Cumulative clause (except AK, KS, ME, MD, MA, MI, OR, which do not have cumulative and/or oral advance directive statutes)In Camp v. White, 510 So.2d 166 (Alabama 1987), a competent patient orally refused treatment after physicians determined that she should permanently be placed on a ventilator. Her physicians complied with this oral statement, and the patient died soon thereafter. The patient’s daughter sued the physicians for (among other things) failing to obtain her mother’s wishes in writing, as required by Alabama’s Natural Death Act. The Alabama Supreme Court concluded that written directives are not the only means of communicating patient preferences at the end of life and that following the oral directive of the patient in this case was proper. The physician was not held liable.Immunity statute (relying on advance directive or agent in “good faith”; upheld in all states)In Estate of Maxey v. Darden, 187 P.3d 144 (Nevada 2008), a patient attempted suicide by overdose. In the emergency department, the patient’s ex-husband requested comfort care even though Nevada law prohibits ex-spouses from acting as default agents. The medical team believed that the patient’s ex-husband was a valid surrogate and removed life-sustaining treatment, and the patient died. The Nevada Supreme Court stated that a physician’s “belief” that an individual was a permitted surrogate was not subject to judicial review.Provider right of refusal (except IN and MI)In Duarte v. Chino (Duarte et al. v. Chino Community Hospital et al., 72 Cal. App. 4th 849, 1999), a patient in California was in a persistent vegetative state after an automobile accident. The patient had not completed an advance directive or designated an agent. Thus, the patient’s family was left to make medical decisions. The family asked the patient’s physician to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, but the physician refused. The family and hospital negotiated an agreement that would release the physician and hospital from liability if the physician withdrew treatment, but the physician refused to sign the agreement. The family then sued the hospital and physician. The court held that, under California law, the physician could not be held liable for refusing to withdraw treatment as requested by the patient’s family. The court noted that, even if the patient had validly appointed a family member to be an agent, the physician would not be required to withdraw treatment if the agent requested this action. Furthermore, even if the patient directly requested to withdraw treatment through an advance directive or POLST, the physician would not be required to withdraw treatment but only to take reasonable steps to transfer the patient to another facility.\n\nHowever, nearly all states grant clinicians the right of refusal based on conscience or other objections ( ). The criteria for refusal vary considerably. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have entirely open-ended criteria that permit providers to decline to comply with patients’ wishes for any reason. Most states acknowledge that providers are not required to act contrary to the standard of care, whereas other states variously permit noncompliance on the basis of one’s conscience and personal, moral, religious, and philosophical beliefs (58). If a provider invokes a conscience objection, states require the provider or institution to notify the patient and permit his or her transfer to another provider. Obligations range from merely refraining from impeding a transfer (Kentucky) (59) to requiring clinicians or institutions to transfer the patient or comply with his or her wishes within a specified interval (Florida) (60).\n\nImmunity and conscience objection provisions may serve patients if surrogates are abusing their authority but also may give clinicians license to ignore patients’ wishes. Even if they receive advance notice of a clinician’s conscience objections, patients (especially those who are disenfranchised or live in rural areas) may have limited options. Thus, advance directive statutes meant to protect patients’ right of self-determination may instead better protect physicians from punitive action. Indeed, we identified only a few cases in which a physician faced punitive action. Our findings may reflect the inability of most disenfranchised patient populations to procure legal counsel, leaving many individuals without a voice.\n\nDiscussion\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that changing the focus of advance care planning from a legal-transactional approach to a relationship- and communication-based one would result in care consistent with patients’ goals (4, 7, 35, 61). In this paradigm of advance care planning, written advance directives are considered only 1 piece of information to be evaluated when a decision must be made (61).\n\nTherefore, for advance directives to be clinically useful, advance directive laws must allow flexibility. Patients have differing needs, learning styles, and preferences for information when engaging in advance care planning. Patients also exist within a complex web of culture, religion, relationships, and experiences and have dynamic clinical courses that may change from moment to moment. Therefore, a one-size-fits-all legal-transactional model is not clinically effective.\n\nSome experts suggest that merely designating a surrogate or adopting a universal advance directive form can remedy unintended consequences of advance directive law. However, these approaches do not address the legal restrictions on who may serve as a surrogate or witness; acknowledge that many patients may not have a surrogate (24, 36); or improve the readability, cultural inadequacies, or myriad execution requirements of advance directive forms. Others suggest using the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment paradigm for patients with advanced progressive illness (15). However, these orders do not encourage discussions about the patient’s wishes before he or she develops an acute or terminal illness or address cultural, religious, or values-based preferences.\n\nAs advance care planning continues to evolve toward a flexible, relationship- and communication-based model, any advance directive tool or discussion could help to guide clinical care. The American Bar Association already has advocated a flexible approach to advance care planning through the Uniform Health-Care Decision Act (UHCDA), which was drafted in 1994 but only adopted by a few states (62). The UHCDA attempted to simplify state legislation by combining living will and durable power of attorney for health care statutes, allowing oral directives, and decreasing execution requirements. Building on the UHCDA, specific changes to advance directive law may help mitigate its unintended consequences on clinical care, particularly for vulnerable patient populations ( ).\n\nTable\n\nBarrierRecommendationPoor readabilityAllow wide acceptance of diverse advance care planning tools and oral directives\n\nEliminate mandatory legal language\n\nMandate that forms be written in plain language at a 5th-grade reading level, and consider using pictures\n\nMandate translation of forms into patients’ native languages, and pilot-test these forms in target populationsDurable power of attorney for health care restrictionsAllow isolated patients the option of choosing a care provider as a surrogate\n\nAllow same-sex and domestic partners to act as default decision makers\n\nEliminate restrictions on the authority of surrogatesExecution requirementsUniversally accept oral advance directives\n\nEliminate witness and notary requirementsLack of reciprocityAdopt nonrestrictive reciprocity lawsReligious, cultural, and social inadequaciesInclude language concerning shared or group decision making and cultural, religious, and social options in statutes\n\nTo address readability barriers, we recommend eradicating mandatory legal language; writing advance directives at a 5th-grade reading level, which is the mean reading level of older persons in the United States; and, when possible, offering advance directives in patients’ native languages (19, 63). To address the problem of health care agent restrictions, clinicians should encourage socially isolated patients to discuss or document their health care wishes (28).\n\nFor patients who are unable or unwilling to do this and would prefer to designate a health care agent, clinicians should direct extensive effort toward helping patients to connect with social networks, distant family, or religious leaders. If a health care agent cannot be identified, we suggest that vulnerable patients with no other options be allowed to designate a professional who is not directly responsible for administering medical care, such as a social worker or case worker.\n\nWe also recommend eliminating health care agent or surrogate authority limitations, such as not allowing withdrawal from artificial nutrition and hydration. Clear documentation that the patient made these choices using his or her own judgment can prevent potential abuse (64). Internal ethics reviews also may be considered in such cases.\n\nTo address execution barriers, we recommend the universal acceptance of oral advance directives and the eradication of witness requirements. We also recommend that all states adopt nonrestrictive reciprocity laws, regardless of the location or type of advance care planning tools used. To address cultural and social insensitivity, we recommend allowing and encouraging patients to document their values, cultural traditions, and other socially or culturally important information and to consider group or shared decision making. By allowing flexibility to include religious, cultural, and social beliefs, clinicians and surrogates may determine a clearer course of action when deciding on the best treatment for an incapacitated patient.\n\nAt the bedside, many clinicians choose to use all available information from patients and their families to help provide the best possible clinical care (61). Many, but not all, states seem to accept such flexibility, given the immunity and cumulative clauses. A flexible rather than a legal-transactional approach to advance care planning may help to ensure that patients’ voices are heard even at the end of their lives.\n\nThis review has several limitations. First, advance directive laws are dynamic, and this assessment may not reflect the most up-to-date statutes. Second, most available case law information is found at the appellate level, which means that the cases have gone to trial and been appealed to a higher court. Because most disenfranchised populations lack the means to appeal, there may be many more cases that we were not able to ascertain. To elucidate the full scope of advance directive legal barriers, further studies should attempt to identify cases that have progressed only to an ethics review board or lower state courts. Finally, future advance care planning interventions should focus on eliciting individualized patient preferences and promoting discussions rather than solely encouraging advance directive completion.\n\nIn conclusion, unintended negative consequences of legal restrictions and requirements related to poor readability of advance directives; health care agent restrictions; execution requirements; insufficient reciprocity; and lack of attention to religious, cultural, and social issues may prevent all patients, and particularly vulnerable patients, from making and communicating their end-of-life wishes and having them honored. In an attempt to safeguard patient autonomy, legal restrictions have rendered advance directives less clinically useful. In addition, advance directive laws seem to protect physicians more than patients.\n\nWe recommend improving the readability of advance directives; eliminating surrogate restrictions; accepting oral and out-of-state advance directives; eradicating witness and notary requirements; and encouraging documentation of religious, cultural, and social beliefs. These changes could help to restore the clinical effectiveness of advance directives and ensure that all patients’ wishes are heard and honored."
