Former Major League Baseball pitcher Frank Castillo has died in a drowning accident, his family has told KVIA El Paso Monday.

The accident occurred Sunday in Arizona's Bartlett Lake, which is reportedly near Castillo's home. He was out with a friend on a pontoon boot when he went out for a swim. He didn't come back up from under the water so his friend reportedly called for help.

Castillo spent parts of 13 seasons in the majors between 1991 and 2005. He appeared in 297 games, starting 268. He was 82-104 with a 4.56 ERA. Most of his career was spent with the Cubs, with whom he spent his first seven seasons. He also pitched for the Red Sox, Rockies, Marlins, Tigers and Blue Jays.
