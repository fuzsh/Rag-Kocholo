        "text": "Gail Berman‘s Jackal Group is developing a biographical project about the late legendary comedian George Carlin, which will be written by Stan Chervin, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter behind Brad Pitt’s Moneyball.\n\nCarlin’s prolific career spanned over five decades, more than 130 Tonight Show appearances, 14 HBO specials and 23 solo albums that earned him five Grammy Awards. His infamous 1972 set “Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television” put him at the center of a U.S. Supreme Court case, FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, that would outline the extent to which the government could regulate speech on broadcast and radio.\n\nCarlin passed away at the age of 71 in 2008, the same year he was awarded the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain prize for American humor.\n\nChervin and Berman will produce, along with Jackal Group’s Joe Earley; Bruce Kaufman, under his new banner Wood Hollow Pictures; and Jerry Hamza, the comedian’s former manager and the executor of the George Carlin estate. It is currently unclear what format the project will take, but the longform biopic will either have a theatrical, streaming or television release.\n\n“We are honored to tell the story of one of the most important and influential comedians of all time, and to do so alongside those who knew him best. In addition to shaping comedy and culture for decades and entertaining generations of audiences, Carlin’s battle to protect free speech continues to impact our daily lives and is as relevant as ever,” Berman and Earley said in a joint statement.\n\nAdded Hamza: “It wasn’t until after George died, I realized he was a hero. As a performer, George would never ‘sell out,’ and never compromise his beliefs — I learned so much from him. I think the public will be very happy to learn about George’s life. He was truly the top of the ladder in his field.”\n\nThe Jackal Group is currently in production on MGM’s animated Addams Family movie starring Oscar Isaac and Charlize Theron.\n\nChervin is repped by ICM."
