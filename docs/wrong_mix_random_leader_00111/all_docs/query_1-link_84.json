Research Paper On Amelia Earhart One day she was flying over the ocean, the next day she was gone, never to be seen again. Amelia Earhart was a pilot and the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1937 Amelia was flying over the Pacific Ocean when she and her plane disappeared. Because Amelia Earhart was such an important person in American History, we need to find out what happened to her. There are quite a few theories about what happened to Earhart. Some of these are she was a spy, gathering information about the Japanese, or she crashed into the Pacific Ocean. One of the most widely believed theories is Amelia Earhart s disappearance was caused by her plane crashing onto Gardner Island. There is plenty of physical evidence proving she crashed onto the island. Also, there are experts that believe this is what happened to her and there are radio calls from Earhart after her disappearance. One of the biggest things proving Earhart crashed onto Gardner Island is the physical evidence found on the island. Having artifacts on the island that belonged to Amelia or her plane proves that she was on the island. One piece of physical evidence is that there were bones found on the island. The morphology of the recovered bones, as far as we can tell applying contemporary forensic methods to measurements taken at the time, appears consistent with a female of Earhart s height and ethnic origin ( Bryner 1). This quote shows that the bones could have been from Amelia Earhart. Another piece of physical ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n3. Fossil Fuels As A Source Of Energy Since the evolution of science, many people have become solely dependent on a variety of technologies to supply their essential needs of life. A key technology that people have a high level of dependency on is fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a source of energy people use in their everyday life as a way to get light, electricity, and to keep warm. Fossil fuels are perceived as a nuclear energy, which has been around for decades. Initially, scientists perceived this type of energy as affordable and safe; however, in the late 20th century, danger of nuclear plants began to threat regions of United States. Due to the increase of global warning from the burning of fossil fuels, climate scientists and environmental experts are considering ways to replace nuclear energy (Ferguson). Since the world uses fossil fuels as a source of energy supply, it would be beneficial if the world considered using alternatives means of energy sources once all the present energy has been used up. The world would greatly benefit from these alternatives since the production of present energy is polluting America. Yet with the world being greatly overpopulated and having insufficient supplies of resources, scientists all across the nation are thinking of ways to replace fossil fuels with alternative energies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explicate alternatives people could use as a source of energy instead of being merely dependent on fossil fuels, and the advantages and disadvantages of ...

The article examines the failures of the war on drug policy has had on society, such as, increasing violence, increasing the prison population, increased spending of billions of taxpayer funds, and being racially biased against minorities. The war on drugs policy reflects a deeper political agenda and is diverting attention away from the real issue by ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Therefore, president after president has adopted the war metaphor and declared drugs as a national security risk that must be fought at an international level to maintain society safe. In Bush s speech to the nation, he states the citizens must come together behind one plan of action, an assault on every front (cited in Elwood, 1995 p. 106). Consequently, the misuse of rhetoric, war metaphors, and the assault on drugs have had a negative impact on society which has failed American citizens. Additionally, the war on drugs is also having an impact on minorities and lower socio economic citizens by imprisoning African American and Hispanic citizens at alarming rates. Nationwide, the rate of persons admitted to prison on drug charges for black men is 13 times higher than that for White men (Fellner, 2000). Currently African American and Hispanic citizens make up the majority of the prison population that is the result of the harsher sentencing of drug related crimes. In 1989, the Bush administration targeted the public housing projects by devoting $50 million to fight crime in the public housing projects. This would help restore order and kick out the dealers for good (cited in Elwood, 1995 p. 104). In 1973, the Rockefeller drug law was enacted which provided extremely harsh sanction and mandatory minimum prison sentences, for example, sentencing someone to fifteen years to life for selling an ounce of heroin (as cited in ...

There have only been 15,213 men to play in the MLB, only 29 of those accumulated 3,000 career hits. Peter Edward Rose Sr, better known as just Pete, played Major League Baseball for 23 years.

He has had many supporters for his reinstatement over the years.

(Isn t It Time to Forgive Pete Rose and Put Him in Hall of Fame?) Similarly, Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan thinks it is long past time for his long time teammate Pete Rose to join him in Cooperstown. I think if you are going to allow guys with PEDs on the ballot, then we have to allow him on the Ballot, Morgan told USA Today. Let s face it, he s been punished for 24 years. I think they have to take a second look at Pete now that this (Biogenesis) has come out . (Joe Morgan: Time for Hall of Fame to Induct Pete Rose) You could ask What will reinstating Pete Rose do for baseball? really any answer would be valid. The right question to ask is What will not reinstating Pete Rose due for baseball? (Rethinking Rose s Reinstatement) He wouldn t be immediately inducted into Cooperstown if reinstated. Major League Baseball s Committee will have to vote Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame if the ban were removed. The Hall of Fame is controlled by Major League Baseball, nevertheless there is no Hall of Fame without the players. If the players were to show a united front for Rose, it could mean a great deal to the Commissioner and other high ranking baseball officials (Should Pete Rose Be in the Hall of Fame?

Often times articles present information in biased ways, or make completely inaccurate statements in order to emphasize an opinion. This often avoids addressing an issue with a serious discussion of the empirical data and known information on the topic. One specific topic in which data and studies are often presented carelessly or often misinterpreted is in the subject of IQ. According to one of the authors of a controversial book The Bell Curve, Charles Murray says; There s a dirty little secret that we try to expose in the book which is that the conventional wisdom in the media about IQ tests and what they measure and don t measure, and expert opinion, ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... One of the final points made in The Bell Curve is that by acknowledging IQ as a factor that exists, social policy and decisions made at the macro level can better be tailored to the needs of groups. To prevent a cognitive elite from isolating itself from the rest of society, the book offers a solution in which differences in abilities are recognized, and each individual can have a valued place(1). The bell Curve unsurprisingly is disregarded by many that fear utilizing IQ could have severely negative effects on society s views and treatments of minority groups or historically oppressed groups. The book is often described as a racist and bigoted book that tells its readers to treat groups with significantly different IQ differently (2). While both sides can make a strong case for the value of IQ in modern day society, without an understanding of the experiments and design structure of the tests used to collect data on the subject, both arguments should seem unconvincing. Arguing about IQ is a very sensitive subject, and to be able to do so in a beneficial way the arguments used to discuss the topic should utilize an understanding of principals learned in CBE ...

The weather also helps the reader understand the pressure that Stephen is faced with; both literally and physically The world was a maelstrom of darkness and wind (Nowlan Pg__). This further reinforces Stephens s unclear confused mind, and the harshness of his father s expectations. The wind struck his back like an alder switch (Nowlan Pg__). The shadowing of how Stephen feels the confusion and coldness he faces. The wind howled until Stephen expected it to wrench the roof from the camp (Nowlan Pg__).

The adversity he faces, weather to be submissive to his father or to pursue his dreams. Through repetition and imagery, Nowlan emphasizes the effect that the weather and his father has on Stephen.

Essay on Lovers Quarrels in Love, 20 cents the First... Lovers Quarrels in Love, 20 cents the First Quarter Mile Kenneth Fearing s poem Love, 20 cents the First Quarter Mile, expresses the wide range of emotions experienced in an argument. The poem depicts the all too familiar situation of a lover s quarrel in which the persona, whom we can assume is male, struggles to resolve an argument during a taxi ride. During his attempts to resolve the quarrel, the persona experiences a variety of emotions ranging from apologetic to accusatory to sarcastic to romantic. In this poem, the reader gains a personal insight into the conflicting and rapidly changing feelings of the persona. The first stanza of the poem leads the reader to ...

Evidently she has depicted herself as being totally innocent and without fault in the quarrel, giving him a reason to sardonically state that he forgives her for being beautiful and generous and wise...and for being alive (19 20). However, just as suddenly as his emotions turned from apologetic to sarcastic, they change again; this time from sarcastic to placating. He softly says: Because tonight you are in my hair and eyes,/ And every street light that our taxi passes shows me you again,/ still you,/ And because tonight all other nights are black, all other hours are/ cold and far away, and now, this minute, the stars are very/ near and bright (22 27).

Francisco De Goya Black Paintings Francisco de Goya s Pinturas negras, or Black Paintings, are some of the most grotesque and unsettling images in art history, with one painting in particular, Saturno devorando a su hijo, or Saturn Devouring One of His Sons, standing out the most amongst them all. With his wildly staring eyes, gaping mouth and half eaten son in his hands, it makes one wonder what would drive an artist to create an image like this. Goya, however, was not uneducated in the horrors of the world, witnessing the travesties of the Peninsular War, the atrocities of the Spanish Inquisition, surviving two life threatening illnesses, with one leaving him completely deaf, and the death of six of his seven children. Perhaps it was one of these instances in particular that encouraged him to conceiving this disconcerting figure, or perhaps it was a combination of the three. At the beginning of Goya s career, in 1777, he was commissioned to create a series of tapestry cartoons from the Royal Tapestry Factory, designing some 42 patterns over five years. Some of his more popular paintings were originally tapestry cartoons such as The Parasol. His use of the popular Rococo style, brought him to the attention of the aristocracy of Spain. In 1789, he was appointed to court painter to Charles IV and then the following year, he became First Court Painter. His portraits of the king, queen and royal family, were anything but flattering.

He was born in 46 AD in Chaeronea, Boeotia; and he died in 120 AD. Plutarch was also known as a historian, essayist and biographer who had left a huge literary heritage for humanity. By traveling abroad to other countries such as Egypt, Greece..., Plutarch assembled lots of information about the heroes of the Roman and Greece mythology. After that, he used that information to write about lives of heroes. He gathered all fascinating biographies in his massive books: Plutarch Greek Lives , Plutarch Roman Lives and The Parallel Lives of Plutarch . Those books bring a reputation to Plutarch and he became a famous biographer at that time. In his books, he wrote the lives of the heroes in order of time to show his respects to those people of both countries. The short biographies in his books are about childhood, achievements and deaths of the heroes. Besides that, he also added some interesting stories and lessons in those biographies to educate his readers. His books were translated into many different languages and they have great influences to modern historians and modern biographers.

Political rap hasn t been popular since the early 1990 s and Tupac was a famous rapper who got shot about three years ago but his record label is still releasing his work. The site obviously had not been updated in a while. There were about 5 or 6 people that voiced their opinion with only a sentence or two of effort put into it.

But of course they don t know if they are harmful before they test them on animals. Many high end makeup brands test on animals without anyone even knowing. Lush cosmetics does not test on animals, this ad is part of the campaign they have to get people involved in trying to end or replace animal testing.

High School Dropouts Is An Issue Today s Society The purpose of this proposal is to let people know that high school dropouts is an issue in today s society. At the present time, every year 1.2 million students drop out of high school. The average age that students dropout is between sixteen and twenty four years. Students drop out because of either personal factors, family factors, and community factors or all of the above. Drop out students should be encouraged to finish high school because non graduates fail to succeed in life. First of all, High school dropouts is an issue occurring since a very long time ago because it has been proven that many students are unsuccessful after dropping out of high school. As mentioned before, every year over 1.2 million students drop out of high school.

In Jesus Sermon on the Mount found in Matthew 5, He gives the world a path to follow, an outline of how to live commonly known as the Beatitudes. The Beatitudes are puzzling to us. They are difficult to put together rationally and find the logic in them. God s plans for our world and for our lives are not always logical to us, but He is God and does things for reasons we cannot understand. We can see through the Beatitudes and Beyond the Gates of Splendor that the Peacemaker is the Child of God who can rejoice when persecuted for righteousness sake. This type of persecution shows that the Peacemaker has been recognized as someone who has not conformed to the pattern of this world, and has lived a life worthy of their call of Christ Jesus which then allows them to enter the Kingdom of Heaven and be called children of God. One of the biggest contradictions we seem to be faced with in the Beatitudes is the eighth and final one.

Up until the late 1900 s people were not able to send anything up in space. But this changed when the Soviet Union sent up the first satellite, and then, the space race between America and Russia began! Many animals were sent up in space including dogs, rats, rabbits, and even chimpanzees. One famous chimpanzee named Ham was sent up and paved the way for other astronauts to go up in space. Ham s background, his expedition to space, and the design of the Mercury Redstone rocket caused more people to want to travel in space. It is hard to believe that a chimpanzee could go up into space. This chimp was born on July 1957, in the French Camaroon, West Africa. Ham was only 3 years old and weighed 37 pounds when he was chosen to go to space. He was picked because he had a sweet attitude and was intelligent. This chimp was named Ham after the lab Holloman Aerospace Medical Center, which was in New Mexico. As soon as the mission was done, Ham lived by himself in the Washington Zoo from 1963 to September 25, 1980. Sadly, on January 17, 1983, Ham died at North Carolina Zoological Park in Asheboro.

Erik Bork, an Emmy and Golden Globe winning author for HBO, states that Jumping around in time with flashbacks can be confusing in a script, and can make it hard for a reader to get oriented and settle into one particular story, in a specific time frame (Bork, par. 1).

This radioactive material is a byproduct of nuclear reactors, hospital, processing plants, and research facilities. Since the use of nuclear power began, the wastes have been transported and kept from the public successfully, but there are a large percentage of people that believe this industry needs to come to a halt until a solution has been devised for its disposal. There is a major concern that the long term containment plants and current burial grounds are not adequate solutions; this is due to the risk of potential environmental disturbances. When these substances are not disposed of properly, they can cause a multiplicity of dangers such as cancer and the destruction of the ecosystem. The most effective methods for the elimination of nuclear waste are building more reliable burial sites, turning the byproduct into electricity, transmuting these toxins into glass that can be handled normally and constructing launchers to send the most noxious substances into outer space. It is mandatory that measures are taken to eliminate nuclear waste because of the detrimental effect that these radioactive substances have.

These very first interactions were mostly positive due to the the generosity of the Indians but turned violent when the Europeans began to mistreat, kidnap, enslave, and kill the American Indians. Actions taken by the American Indians and European Colonists, especially actions of violence, during the 1600s caused the relationship between the two parties to be negative and conflicting in New England and Chesapeake. In New England, John Winthrop began conflicts early when he declared that the Indians had only a natural right to their land and no legal right.

Not many people were killed and the Narragansets did not fight back, but when the Puritans attacked the Pequot Indians, they fought back. The Pequot War was one of large massacres, rather than battles, from both sides and had many deaths.

Howard Zinn Critique A People s History of the United States written by Howard Zinn is exactly what the title says, from a socialist point of view. Written like Zinn has done his research, he makes an arguable case on the United States history from his standpoint. Viewing the United States history from a new perspective is the goal of this book, one not everyone will enjoy. Zinn is rather harsh on some figures and eras in the United States history, such as slavery, Native Americans, and corporations. Overall I d say the book has a very depressing tone that makes you really question our country s actions. Open mindedness is the key to enjoying this book while reading, with Zinn being anti government and with myself only ever being taught out of government funded textbooks there some collision to beliefs. Writing a book with an uncommonly taught perspective, Zinn tried to verify his take on U.S history. There are inserts from various documents, such as diaries, ledgers, and newspapers used as supporting documents to his claim, ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Was World War II the people s war, or the manufacturer s? That s the question Zinn bases this chapter on. Bringing in facts about the U.S entering multiple countries and intervening before the U.S declared war, he challenges the motivation behind U.S involvement in the war. One of these intervening being Vladivostok, Russia, with seven thousand troops, offsetting the effects of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia as told by the U.S state department. Zinn conveys it as we didn t enter the war as a concern for the people fighting it or being hurt by the Nazi party, any more than how we didn t enter the Civil War off the number of enslaved blacks. Rather, we entered because of the Japanese bombing and Roosevelt lied about it being the right cause. Challenging the reader, Zinn makes him or her ask themselves if we really are such a self centered country and leaves it to them to find the answer that ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n46.

Fanny also converts Lue to Christianity and encourages his garden research but keeps him financially dependent. Fanny is the daughter of a strict industrialist; she is well drawn in this novel. She is too strong to accept the lack of power women faced at the time. Uninterested in men, she invests all of her emotions in Jesus until she meets Lue Gim Gong. She sees Lue as her creation; others see him as her pet. In fact, he is more independent than she can accept. Rudely rejecting the possibility of a positive influence from his own family, she says how she made him as much of an improved variety of Chinaman as his salmonberry, cherry currant, and tomato were of plants (McCunn, 154). Though her closeness to him it allows her to be offended by others racism, as she regards him as someone special rather than a typical Chinaman. After Fanny s death, he was barred from the church they had regularly worshipped in, on account of his color. Finally there is Sheba, Fanny s black servant whose father was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan shortly after winning his freedom from slavery. Sheba worked alongside Lue in the orange groves and probably understood him best. This is because Sheba s eyes were the least blinded by prejudice and ignorance. Unlike their white neighbors, neither Lue nor Sheba was too proud to share their different knowledge and company. Sum Jui, Fanny, and Sheba are socially and culturally different in multiple ...

For Instance, in the beginning of the play Macbeth is feminized by his wife Lady Macbeth therefore he is not represent as the masculine character of the play. He is not thinking about honour, keeping promises, ruthlessness and therefore bravery. We can observe this attempt of making inferior and feminizing Macbeth by Lady Macbeth when she questions his masculinity in act 1 scene 7: When you durst do it, then you were a men; and to be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man. She knows that this argument is effective on Macbeth; as a result he will commit the murder. On the other hand, Banquo is presented as the masculine character of the play. As masculinity means for Shakespeare knowing the difference between right and wrong, obeying conscience and knowing the moral, we can say therefore that Banquo is masculine, and hence, the ideal man of the plot. Indeed, he is not tempted as Macbeth by the witches and by their predictions. In conclusion, throughout the play Macbeth, Shakespeare tries and manages to give us a definition of an Ideal Man for him. Macbeth embodies the opposition and Banquo the true masculine, ideal man: The model should be loyal, intelligent, brave, cautious, clever, and obeying the morality.

After Treatment Of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons AFTER TREATMENT OF PAH IN AUTOMOTIVE 1. Summary 2. Motivation 2.1. Environmental issues 2.2. Health issues 2.3. Laws and regulations 3. Objectives 3.1. Control techniques 3.2. Economics 4. Introduction Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) consist of two or more benzene ringed compounds made of only carbon and hydrogen. Compounds which are made of two rings are known as di aromatics whereas those made of three benzene rings are known as tri aromatics and so forth. As the number of rings increase, molecular weights of these compounds also increase and the compounds tend towards higher thermodynamic stability. Most common examples of PAHs are naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene etc. Further, as these compounds become heavier, the particle s size increases and hence these compounds are also known to be pre cursors of soot formation. In this report we will only be studying PAH in the vapour phase whose particle sizes will be restricted to less than 1.5 nm. Following diagram shows the formation of PAH resulting in soot, in a premixed flame. Figure 1: Formation of PAH followed by soot. (Howard originally in Bockhorn) In a study carried out by Y. Lev et al, it is seen that the concentration of total PAH is around 0.25 ng to 1 ng per µg of total particulate matter depending on the number of rings, which is a very small quantity of the total hydrocarbon emission from automotive.

The concentration of power into the emperor s hands led to many changes in the government of Japan. The samurai class was quickly abolished, a national army was formed, political parties formed, an upper House of Peers and lower House of Diet were formed, and a constitution was drafted. Russia was very agriculturally based and did not have the sufficient technology to industrialize. States could industrialize when an efficient agricultural system was implemented to provide sufficient food for the factory workers that did not have land to farm. It is the trend seen from the beginning of civilization. Trade specialization can only occur with a surplus of food. Therefore, the first step for Russia, on its way to industrialization, was to become more efficient at farming. This was achieved with the emancipation of the serfs. Still without a middle class, the government played a strong role in the early decisions with industrialization. The tsar during this time, Alexander II, had a great railroad network created that allowed for more efficient use of Russia s plentiful natural resources. With the change of government in Japan, economic change soon followed. Banks were founded to invest in capital, railways and steam boats were developed, restrictions on trade such as tariffs and guilds were removed, and land was re distributed.
