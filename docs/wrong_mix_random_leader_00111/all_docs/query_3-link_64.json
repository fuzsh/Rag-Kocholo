Dudesy's \"George Carlin: Dead and Loving It\" special, which was first uploaded in early January, gained hundreds of thousands of views and plenty of media attention for its presentation as a creation of an AI that had \"listened to all of George Carlin's material... to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today.\" But even before the Carlin estate lawsuit was filed, there were numerous signs that the special was not actually written by an AI, as Ars laid out in detail in a feature report.\n\nShortly after the Carlin estate filed its lawsuit against Dudesy in late January, a representative for Dudesy host Will Sasso told The New York Times that the special had actually been \"completely written by [Dudesy co-host] Chad Kultgen.\" Regardless of the special's actual authorship, though, the lawsuit also took Dudesy to task for \"capitaliz[ing] on the name, reputation, and likeness of George Carlin in creating, promoting, and distributing the Dudesy Special and using generated images of Carlin, Carlin's voice, and images designed to evoke Carlin's presence on a stage.\" The resulting \"association\" between the real Carlin and this ersatz version put Dudesy in potential legal jeopardy, even if the contentious and unsettled copyright issues regarding AI training and authorship weren't in play.\n\nCourt documents note that shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Dudesy had already \"taken reasonable steps\" to remove the special and any mention of Carlin from all of Dudesy's online accounts. The settlement restrains the Dudesy podcast (and those associated with it) from re-uploading the special anywhere and from \"using George Carlin's image, voice, or likeness\" in any content posted anywhere on the Internet. Archived copies of the special are still available on the Internet if you know where to look. While the settlement notes that those reposts are also in \"violat[ion] of this order,\" Dudesy will not be held liable for any reuploads made by unrelated third parties."
