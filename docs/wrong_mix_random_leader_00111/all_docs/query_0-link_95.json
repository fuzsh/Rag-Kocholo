        "text": "by Warren Feld\n\nThere are so many different kinds of things you can do business-wise to promote your jewelry designs. Post on every social media site. Conduct several email campaigns. Take out ads. Create websites. However, all these can get overwhelming and begin to impede on your time and energy for creating jewelry. To prevent this, it is important to be organized. It is important to rely on more limited, predictable, easily accessible, repeatable systems of things you need to do to sustain both your jewelry designing and your business.\n\nSome key business-related goals involve:\n\n(1) Impression management\n\n(2) Mentoring\n\n(3) Audience recruitment and retention\n\n(4) Networking and Partnering\n\n(5) Selling\n\nSome caveats:\n\n(a) To create that manageability’ you want to do as much as you can from your computer\n\n(b) In reality, selling actual pieces of jewelry, on average, only covers about 1/3 of your sustainability needs. You may have to take on additional work, and it makes the most sense that the work relate to jewelry designing.\n\n(c) You are in the trust-creating business. You must be able to establish instant trust about the value of your work and the desirability of your work for your core buying audience.\n\nImpression management\n\nWhat impression does someone get from interacting with you, either online or in-person or through some other point-of-sale? To what degree can you influence and control this impression? Key things to consider:\n\no Website\n\no Email Etiquette\n\no Cold Calling\n\no Follow Through\n\nWebsite. You want a professional website. This website will showcase your products. It will be home to lots of well-organized and accessible information, including: your bio, your art statement, your portfolio, testimonials, links to articles you have written, perhaps a creative-focused resume, and images of your work.\n\nIt might showcase shorter videos showing you at work, or delving into a particular work.\n\nIt will have links to your various social media pages. The layout, design and information presentation across social media sites needs to be very consistent across all your platforms. You should maintain separate pages for each social media for business vs. personal. You do not want anything personal to come up in your business page feed.\n\nIt may or may not have a shopping cart system attached. If not, then you need to make clear other alternatives for how people can buy your products from you.\n\nIt will have a FAQ page detailing contact information, purchasing and return policies, payment methods, any privacy concerns.\n\nIt will have a clear way for people to add their names to your mailing list.\n\nEmail Etiquette. It is critical to generate an email list of customers/potential customers. You want them to very formally and visibly opt-in to the list. You can generate sign-up sheets, online forms, and the like towards this end. You can also segment your list into smaller, targeted groups.\n\nEmail will be your best, primary and most powerful networking tool.\n\nYou can run your own email campaigns, or use an email client like MAILCHIMP (https://mailchimp.com) or CONSTANT CONTACT (https://www.constantcontact.com). I would suggest using an email client. This will prevent your own email address from getting blocked by the internet-powers-that-be as spam.\n\nEach time you get someone’s email address to add to your list, send them a special email, thanking them. Also direct them to your website or online presence, such as on social media, with an active link.\n\nA monthly contact is reasonable.\n\nCaution: many anti-spam programs reject email addresses that begin with Info, Contact, Shop, Store, Help and other very generic terms.\n\nIn writing and tone, be professional. Don’t use the kind of quick texts or posts you might use on social media.\n\nYou do not want your email to appear that it is wasting anyone’s time. Use a polite greeting and closing. In your first sentence or two be very clear in conveying why you are writing this email specifically to them. Don’t ramble. Get to your points quickly. Don’t use long blocks of texts. Segment/section things and use subheadings throughout. You want the email to be scannable. Don’t use any or many images. None to two images would be more than enough. Wait to share images until after someone requests to see them. Do, however, include an active link to where they might find images of your works online.\n\nTo the best you can, personalize things as much as possible. Direct the email to a named person. Make things sound as if you are not sending out the same email to a long list of contacts.\n\nSome examples of personalized phrasing:\n\no I visited your shop recently, and\n\no So and so suggested I contact you,\n\no I visited your website,\n\no I read about you in such-and-such magazine,\n\nCold Calling. With cold calling, you have two basic strategies: (a) Shoehorn, or (b) Direct. Whatever approach you use, be sure to have done some research about your target store/gallery, the designers they represent, a sense of preferred style and looks, and the characteristics of their primary customer audience.\n\nWith a shoehorn strategy, you begin to ease yourself into the world and universe of a particular store or gallery. You visit as a customer and ask questions. You contact and talk with other artists represented in the store. You participate in open houses and other events. You add your name to their emailing list. You begin to have more and longer conversations with the owner. Gradually you introduce the idea of having your jewelry represented in their venue. Always wear one or more pieces of your jewelry.\n\nWith a direct approach, you come into the store unannounced. Hopefully the owner is there then; otherwise, ask the staff when the best time to return is. Always wear one or more pieces of your jewelry. Be prepared with about 20 pieces, nicely organized and displayed in trays, that, if you are making headway, you can bring into the venue with you. It is also OK, if you have the inventory, to have even more pieces in your car that you can bring in, if it seems the owner is interested in purchasing some things.\n\nIf you are unable to visit in person, then send a letter. Don’t phone first. It is too easy for the store to ignore you. In your letter, keep it short and to the point. Establish your credibility as a designer, and clearly identify the fit between your work and their customer base. Sound authentic, not sales’y. Write about,\n\no Who you are\n\no Your style and design sense\n\no Why you think your jewelry would be a good fit for their customer base\n\no The materials and techniques you typically use\n\no Your previous experience selling your pieces\n\no Some sheets showing inventory, description, pricing\n\no End with a phrase like, “I’d like to get together with you to show my work in person. I will call you to set up an appointment, if interested.”\n\no Add links to your website of places which show your jewelry.\n\nFollow Through. Be very clear about this: You are not an information-sharer. Rather, you are a relationship builder. Sending out emails, posting on line, targeting letters, cold calling are all tools you use to build relationships. Relationships are built up by sharing understandings, not necessarily tid-bits of information. These understandings have to do with values, desires, assumptions, expectations, and perceptions. The more you establish shared understandings — and that does not mean having to have the same opinions — the tighter and more productive these relationships get.\n\nIf you are wanting a response to something from someone, and it’s not forthcoming in a reasonable time, follow up with that person.\n\nIf you have visited a store/gallery and had some conversation with someone there, follow up with a thank you note or some note that continues something about your conversation.\n\nIf someone sends you a comment about you or your work, send them a thank you note.\n\nIn your follow-ups, repeat the name of the person you are following up with.\n\nProvide additional valuable information in your follow-up conversations.\n\nMentoring\n\nShare your art/designer skills for a fee. You can teach classes or one-on-one. You can create instructional projects or tutorials. You can write articles. You can curate shows. You can become a coach. You can conduct online webinars.\n\nThings have synergistic effects — they amplify other things you are doing. Mentoring will result in a larger, more targeted email list. Students will look for all the mentoring activities you do. Students often will buy your pieces. Mentoring will increase the number of topics you can talk about when networking.\n\nKeep your initial goal simple: Aim to attract 5 students, interacting with them 1–4x each month, encouraging them to spend $50–250/student per month on your mentoring activities and product sales.\n\nAudience recruitment and retention\n\nWhat is most important about recruiting and retaining audience members is not the numbers of contacts, but the quality of your engagement with your contacts. Again, success is a matter of forming and sustaining one-on-one relationships. When you have relationships, it becomes much easier to ask for favors. On a regular basis, you can create content, for free, shared through emails, which helps you connect and form relationships with your core audience.\n\nYou don’t necessarily need 1000’s of people in your core audience. More likely, having 30–100 regular buyers of your work would suffice. This allows keeping connected and creating connections with your core audience much more attainable. Know what this limited group of buyers is looking for. Know where they hang out and where to find them. Offer them opportunities to interact with you and your jewelry, such as offering them a first look, or a time to watch you and learn a few design techniques as you work. Turn these buyers into true fans.\n\nThink about:\n\no What does this core buyer care about?\n\no What does this buyer read?\n\no Where do you find this buyer?\n\no What resonates with this buyer?\n\nAnswers to these questions could help you shape your marketing message when explaining how your jewelry could elevate this buyer’s life. Inspiring your buyer. Building trust. Note: you are not creating jewelry for this buyer per se; rather, given the jewelry you are creating and want to create, this assists you in finding that audience who might share your values and understandings as expressed within your designs and by you as an authentic jewelry designer.\n\nNetworking and Partnering\n\nWhen networking and partnering, you uncover more opportunities at less risk and cost to yourself, your creative energy, and your business fundamentals. There’s less effort to find opportunities. Less effort to put plans and projects into effect. Less effort to get visibility. Less effort to make a sale.\n\nIt might be useful to set a goal as making 3 networking contacts per week. Use your network to get help in creating these pitches. Make them shared pitches. Use the shared pitches to introduce yourself to their audiences, and conversely their products to your own audience.\n\nCaveat: Always direct people to specific webpages relevant to any pitch. Do not direct them to your home page on your website.\n\nSelling\n\nAs a jewelry designer, your self-concept is most likely one as an artist. But when you are in business, you need to expand this a bit and see yourself as both an artist and a salesperson. If this makes you feel a bit uncomfortable, it’s understandable, but you need to get over it. Jewelry doesn’t sell itself.\n\nYou want to always have on hand 15–20 coherent pieces available for sale. They need to feel as if they are part of a line of jewelry, with a similar emotional appeal to a defined target audience.\n\nYou want to have a list of about 50 places you could approach to carry your jewelry. Then you work the list, perhaps 3 contacts a week. Prioritize your contacts. Begin your process with your lower priority contacts so that you can gain some experience in presenting yourself and your products before approaching your most desired sites.\n\nYou do not close a sale. Keeping with a key theme of advice: You create a relationship. You are not selling a product. You are guiding someone, in a caring way, to come to understand how your jewelry might enhance and enrich their lives. You want them to make a buying decision that will be good for themselves. You are not trying to get something from them; rather, you are trying to give them something which will positively impact their lives. Your key skill here when selling is empathy.\n\nBe bold and confident when introducing yourself.\n\nAlways ask the person you are talking with what their name is; repeat their name several times while speaking with them.\n\nAsk a lot of questions; show interest in the client or customer. Get them talking about themselves. You should be talking about 25% of the time and your client/customer should be talking about 75% of the time.\n\nA great story about your jewelry will sell it. They are especially interested in your inspiration, as well as your process for creating jewelry.\n\nDon’t let your client/customer get away without at least asking them if they have any interested in purchasing your jewelry. Even if that person says No!, you would be in a better position than if you had not asked.\n\nFinal Words\n\nDon’t let the business aspects of succeeding in jewelry design kill your creative spark. Instead, make each broad business goal into a set series of systematic, repeatable activities.\n\nAs you can see, much of all this effort can be done from your studio on your computer. This will save you vast amounts of time which you can devote to the creative side of your life. Less time jewelry marketing. More time jewelry making. The end results of these activities should be increased exposure, relationships and engagements.\n\nThe most successful designers have\n\no Step-by-step plans\n\no Associations with expertise\n\no Become a part of a peer audience and community\n\nMake your jewelry design journey flourish. Take ownership over it — how you spend your time, energy and the use of resources around you. Put everything to best use to attain your own highest values.\n\n__________________________________\n\nI hope you found this article useful.

I can remember when I was 10 or 11 years old, my friend Gary and I, and sometimes Ira, who was sometimes a friend, sometimes someone we bullied, used to set fires, and then try to put them out. We would set fire to this field behind the Ford dealership on Rt. 22. We would set fire to homes and businesses under construction. We would set fires, let them burn awhile and then try to put them out by stamping them with our feet, putting blankets over them, pouring water on them.\n\nWe set fires until we were caught. By the police. Punished severely by our parents who could not figure out why we were setting fires. The word because was insufficient for them. We did it because we could. The fields and buildings were there waiting to be used. We used them the way we knew how. That gave us some fun. A feeling of power. And that was that.\n\nThat was that for Gary and Ira. Actually, not for me. I became mesmerized. The colors. The contrasts. The saturation and vibrancy. The interplay. The movement and rapid color changes. The certainty when it was all over.\n\nMy gaze locked in, never wavering, staring as the light tans and beiges of the tall field grasses, very still, began undulating with reds and oranges, some blues, some maroons, the fiery colors taking over, first a small area, then more and more, until the colors were more powerful than the heat generated by the fire. Once the fire was put out, I literally felt the strong juxtaposition between charcoal and beige, at once listless and lifeless, yet exuding a powerful finality.\n\nColor is such a powerful influencer. I never set fires again, but, at the same time, I had no one to share my very personal, very emotional, very primal color experiences with until I was in my late 20’s. In school, I was always tracked with the more intelligent kids. This meant rewards for math and science, and some put downs for art and music. My parents did not want to hear about anything else besides lawyer and doctor.\n\nSoon after Gary and Ira and I were caught, I moved away.\n\nBut I doubt color was in their forethoughts as we set fires to things.\n\nThe Jewelry Designer Colors Differently Than The Artist\n\nYou cannot paint with beads and other jewelry components.\n\nI am going to repeat this: You cannot paint with beads and other jewelry components.\n\nWhen you take color class after color class rooted in art, they are teaching you how to paint. You can’t do this with jewelry and beads.\n\nI give this warning to all my students. I repeat it frequently in the articles I write. I follow it carefully when designing my own pieces. I have been challenged frequently by people who make jewelry and consider themselves artists. But to create successful jewelry takes you beyond art, its ideas, constructs and precepts. Jewelry has some roots in art, which is true. But it also has roots in craft. It is very comparable to architecture. Its product — the outcome — plays a different role and must conform to different social and physical tensions than paintings and sculptures. I repeat: You cannot paint with beads.\n\nAs frustrating as this can be, you cannot ignore the fact that Color is the single most important Design Element. Colors, their selection, use and arrangement, are believed to have universal powers to get people to see things as harmonious and appealing. Color attracts attention. A great use of color within an object, not only makes that object more coherent, it can make it more contagious, as well. Using colors that do not work well together, or using too many colors or not enough colors, or using colors which look good on paper but distort in reality can put people off.\n\nJewelry Designers can learn the artistic basics of Color concepts and theories. They can reference this visual language of color to influence how they go about making choices, including those about picking and using colors. However, jewelry artists who are fluent in design will be very aware of the limitations this artistic, painterly language imposes on them. They will have to learn how to decode, adjust and leverage their thinking to anticipate how the bead and other related and integrated materials assert their needs for color, and how to strategically compose, construct and manipulate them.\n\nJewelry, unlike painting or sculpture, has certain characteristics and requirements which rely on the management and control of color, its sensation and its variability with a slightly different emphasis than learned in a traditional art class. Jewelry is a 3-dimensional object, composed of a range of materials. Jewelry situates, moves and adjusts in relation to the human body and what that body is doing at the moment.\n\nTo get the attention their jewelry deserves, jewelry artists must become fluent with color selection and application from their own disciplinary perspective. We must understand color in jewelry as the jewelry is worn, and worn in a particular context or situation. Ever-changing directions and intensities of light and shadow, reflection, absorption and refraction. The observation that color may be present, even projected (the color shadow), outside the boundaries of the bead or jewelry component itself.\n\nBeads [here I use ‘beads’ as a stand-in for all the component parts and stringing and canvas materials used in a piece of jewelry] are curved or faceted or otherwise shaped, and the shape and texture and material and dimensionality and even the hole through it affect the color, its variation and its placement and movement on the bead’s surface. They affect how light reflects and refracts, so depending on the angle at which you are standing, and how you are looking at the bead, you get some unexpected, unanticipated, sometimes unwanted colors in your piece of jewelry.\n\nAdditionally, you need to anticipate how the bead, when worn, can alter its color, depending on the source and positioning of light, the type and pace of movement of the wearer, and how the eye interacts with the bead at any point of time or positioning. There are many more color tensions that come from the interrelationships between positive and negative spaces. There are many gaps of light between each pair of beads, and you can’t paint these in. The colors don’t blend, don’t merge, don’t spill over, don’t integrate. You can’t create the millions of subtle color variations that you can with paint.\n\nI’m not suggesting that beaders and jewelry makers be afraid of colors. Rather, they should embrace them. They should learn insights into understanding colors. They should be inspired by colors. They should express their artistic and creative selves through color. They should use color palettes to their fullest. They should recognize how their various audiences see and claim and interact with color.\n\nIt is most important that jewelry designers understand color, its use and application from their own disciplinary standpoint. In some sense, however, the approaches of most bead artists and jewelry designers too often remain somewhat painterly — too rooted in the Art Model.\n\nThe Art Model ignores things about functionality and context. The Art Model does not anticipate all the additional management and control issues which arise with jewelry creation and how /where / when it is worn. The Art Model diminishes how the individuality of the designer, and the subjective responses of the wearer and viewer affect each other. In many respects, these are synergetic, mutually dependent and reciprocal. The Art Model understands the success of jewelry only as if the jewelry were sitting on an easel, not as it is worn. When jewelry is treated as an inanimate object, apart from when it is worn, then traditional art color theories would suffice and apply.\n\nAs a result, when the use of color is solely dictated by art theory, then color theories get oversimplified for the jewelry artist. “Value” is barely differentiated from “Intensity”. Color selection focuses too much on harmony and variety, and too little on resonance and edginess. Color training too often steers jewelry designers towards a step-by-step, paint-by-number sort of approach to color selection and application. Color theory seeks to explain the universal, and paintings, given that they are immobile, hung on a wall, give time and space for the viewer to experience these universals.\n\nJewelry, on the other hand, requires an understanding of how color can be adapted to more subjective experiences. It does not stay in the same place. It is not desired in the same way across individuals who view it and wear it. As such, the co-dependent relationship between Color and other Jewelry Design Elements is downplayed and glossed over. This is a major disservice.\n\nDesigners need to think of colors as building blocks, and the process of using colors, as one of Creative Construction. Creative Construction requires focusing on how color (and multiple co-existing colors) is (are) sensed, and sensed by various audiences which include the artist him- or herself, and the wearer and the viewer, and the exhibitor, collector, and the seller, if need be. Creative Construction also requires anticipating how color is sensed within those context(s) and situation(s) the jewelry will be worn. Creative Construction includes an ability to anticipate how the various audiences of the designer use color to assume, perceive, understand, express, value and desire jewelry within any context.\n\nAll jewelry designers, including myself, are challenged with tasks like controlling the presentation of color(s) along a jewelry object’s silhouette. Or in blending colors among fixed physical objects awkwardly aligning or misaligning within some positive and negative spaces. Or having two or more colors co-exist within the same space or form which may or may not harmonize, given the reality that beads and other jewelry objects do not come in every possible and desirable color, nor consistently express any particular color over their entire surface.\n\nI have found the use of simultaneity effects especially useful here. The one I use the most is that of grays. Gray takes on the colors around it. If I line up an orange bead, then a gray bead, then a blue bead, the middle gray bead will create the perception of a blended orange to blue form. Any bead with an underlying gray or black tone, strategically placed, will accomplish some color blending otherwise problematic.\n\nI often play with other simultaneity effects. Some colors in combination emphasize warmth, and others cold. A sense of temperature (for example a red square embedded within a white square vs. that same red square embedded within a black square) can sometimes be used to divert the mind’s attention from whether the colors correctly harmonize.\n\nIn a similar way, some colors in combination (example a yellow square within a black square vs. within a white square) can create the illusion of either projecting or receding, and this too can be used to divert the mind’s attention from whether the colors correctly harmonize.\n\nIn my pieces, you will often find colors which, if not used strategically in combination and placement, would not seem to go together. They don’t fit a color scheme. They do not perfectly conform to a mathematical algorithm. They might even clash. More often, however, they just seem off in some way. But by smartly using simultaneity effects, they feel whole, consistent, coherent, right in some way. But also intriguing as the viewer’s mind tries to make sense of them. The colors resonate and are edgy in some way, yet feel harmonious, and the viewers can never figure out why. I intentionally create an object which lacks inherent meaning in order to trap the viewer into trying to find inherent meaning. Fun stuff. And something which often draws the viewer’s attention to my pieces, and keeps their attention there.\n\nI like to play with color proportions. There are ideal proportions of the presence of any two or more colors. Red should appear in equal proportions to green. There should be one orange for any two blues. In art, we would strive to achieve the perfect proportions. In jewelry design, however, I would want to play with imperfections in proportions to give an edginess to my piece. This edginess, if not gone too far, enhances how the jewelry resonates emotionally for the wearer or buyer. We want our jewelry to have a little bit of edginess, or else it may feel harmonious yet boring and banal.\n\nI believe the jewelry designer needs to be able to apply the careful of consideration of color with the goal of evoking resonance in the viewer. Something beyond harmony. Something represented by the difference of the viewer saying I like it, from the viewer saying I want to wear it, or I want to buy it. The designer is here to perhaps emphasize a little bit of the absurdity in life, some playfulness, some inquisitiveness which result from tensions between order and chaos, meaning and meaninglessness.\n\nThe designer is there, in part, to challenge the viewer’s subjective interpretations. This is especially true as the jewelry is worn and the wearer moves from different situations, contexts, and lighting. The use of color in jewelry designer often fails when the designer merely tries to duplicate a perfect color scheme, given perfect lighting and no movement. Jewelry is not a painting or sculpture to be displayed in fixed position. It’s much more. Using color from the designer’s viewpoint, rather than of the artist, is a very useful tool.\n\nAll these and similar color tricks I use as a jewelry designer contribute to how my jewelry expresses and reflects my authenticity. They add the cachet to my pieces as contemporary. Uninhibited by social norms encapsulated in art theory rules for the use of color. Creating more of a sense of freedom in my pieces, a sense which affects the feelings of freedom the wearer has. Transcendence. A re-imagining. Revelation, connection, awakening.\n\nThat’s what my Rogue Elephant needs, wants, demands. In this chaotic and indifferent universe, that rogue-ness could not have it any other way.\n\n_______________________________\n\nI hope you found this article useful. Please consider sharing.

There is some fuzziness here. That inspiration has some elements of ideas, but not necessarily crystal clear ones. That inspiration has some elements of emotions — it makes you feel something — but not necessarily something you can put into words or images or fully explain. You then need to translate this fuzzy inspiration into materials, into techniques, into color, into arrangements, into a coherent whole.\n\nYou start to make something, but realize you don’t know how to do it. But you want to do it, and do it now. However, to pick up the needed skills, you realize you can’t learn things all at once. You can’t do everything you want to do all at once. That initial excitement often hits a wall. Things take time to learn. There are a lot of trial and error moments, with a lot of errors. Pieces break. Combining colors and other design elements feels very awkward. Picking the right clasps and rings and connectors and stringing materials is fraught with implications. Silhouettes are confusing. You might get the right shape for your piece, but it is difficult to get the right movement, drape and flow, without compromising that shape.\n\nTo add to this stress and strain, you need to show your jewelry off. You might want someone to like it. To want it. To need it. To desire it. To buy it. To wear it. To wear it more than once. To wear it often. To exhibit it. To collect it. To show and talk about it with others. And how will all these other people recognize your creative spark, and your abilities to translate that spark into a wonderful, beautiful, functional piece of jewelry, appropriate for the wearer and appropriate for the situation?\n\nFrequently, because of all this, the artist experiences some sense of doubt and self-doubt. Some paralysis. Can’t get started. Can’t finish something. Avoiding showing your pieces to others. Wondering why you became a jewelry designer in the first place.\n\nDoubt holds you back from seizing your opportunities.\n\nIt makes getting started or finishing things harder than they need to be.\n\nIt adds uncertainty.\n\nIt makes you question yourself.\n\nIt blocks your excitement, perhaps diminishing it.\n\nDoubt and Self-Doubt should be useful in forcing you to think about and question your choices. However, for many jewelry designers, it mostly holds them back.\n\nHaving doubt and self-doubt is common among all artistic types. After all, for much of what you do and how you spend your time, you’re mostly alone with your thoughts.\n\nWhat becomes important is how you manage and overcome it. You do not want your doubts to get in the way of your creative process and disciplinary development. You want your doubts, rather, to inform them.\n\n8 Major Ways Doubts Can Force You Into That Abyss\n\nThere are 8 major ways in which jewelry designers get caught beginning to fall into that abyss we call self-doubt:\n\n1) What If I’m Not Creative Enough or Original Enough or Cannot Learn or Master or Don’t Know a Particular Technique?\n\n2) What If No One Likes What I Make?\n\n3) What If No One Takes Me Seriously As An Artist And Designer?\n\n4) I Overthink Things and Am A Bit of a Perfectionist.\n\n5) How Can I Stay Inspired?\n\n6) Won’t People Steal My Work?\n\n7) Being Over Confident or Under Confident\n\n8) Role Confusion\n\n1. What If I’m Not Creative Enough or Original Enough or Cannot Learn or Master or Don’t Know a Particular Technique?\n\nEveryone has some creativity baked into their being. It is a matter of developing your way of thinking and doing so that you can apply it. This takes time.\n\nSo does originality. The word originality can be very off-putting, but it does not have to be.\n\nAt first, when you are getting started making jewelry, originality will mean that you will try different ways of personalizing projects. There are always things you can do to bring some aspects of originality to your pieces. This might be the choice of colors, or using a special clasp, or rearranging some elements in your composition.\n\nAgain, as with creativity, the ability to be more and more original will evolve over time. It is helpful to think of originality, not necessarily as coming up with something completely new, but rather as differentiation — how you differentiate yourself from other jewelry designers.\n\nFor almost everyone, you don’t begin your design career at the height of your levels of creativity and originality. Yes, if you look around you, other people are more creative and original than you or have more skills than you. Don’t let these observations be a barrier to your own development as a jewelry designer. You get there through persistence and hard work. You handle your inner critic. You may not be there, yet — the key word here is yet. But you will be.\n\n2. What If No One Likes What I Make?\n\nWe all have fears about how our creativity and originality are going to be evaluated and judged. We project our self-doubts to the doubts we think we see and feel from others. What if no one wants to wear my pieces, or buy my works?\n\nWe can’t let these outsider reactions dictate our lives and creative selves. A key part of successful jewelry design is learning how to introduce what we do publicly. At the least, it is the core nature of the things we create that they are to be worn on the body. Jewelry is a very public thing.\n\nTurn negative comments into positive ideas, motivators, insights, explorations. Allow yourself some give and take, some needs to step back awhile, some needs to tweak. Jewelry design and jewelry making are iterative processes. They in no way are linear. Your outcomes and their success are more evolutionary, than guaranteed.\n\nDistressing about what others may think of your work can be very damaging to your self-esteem. It can amplify your worries. Don’t go there.\n\nDon’t become your worst critic.\n\n3. What If No One Takes Me Seriously As An Artist And Designer?\n\nJewelry design is an occupation in search of a profession. You will find that a lot of people won’t recognize your passion and commitment. They may think anyone can design jewelry. They may think of jewelry making as a craft or some subset of art, not as something unique and important in and of itself. They may wonder how you can make a living at this.\n\nThe bottom line: if you don’t take yourself seriously as a jewelry designer, no one else will.\n\nPeople will take you seriously as they see all the steps you are taking to master your craft and develop yourself as a professional.\n\n4. I Over Think Things And Am A Bit Of A Perfectionist\n\nSome designers let a sense that their work is not as good as imagined get in the way. They never finish anything. They let doubt eat away at them.\n\nPerfectionism is the enemy of the good. It’s great to be meticulous, but emotionally, we get wrecked when anything goes astray, or any little thing is missing, or you don’t have that exact color or part you originally wanted.\n\nGo ahead and plan. Planning is good. It’s insightful. It can be strategic. But also be sure to be adaptable and realistic. Each piece is a stepping stone to something that will come next.\n\nThe better jewelry designer develops a Designer’s Toolbox — a collection of fix-it strategies to deal with the unfamiliar or the problematic.\n\nOverthinking can be very detrimental. You can’t keep changing your mind, trying out every option, thinking that somewhere, someplace there exists a better option. Make a choice and get on with it. You can tweak things later.\n\nYes, attention to detail is important. But so is the value of your time. You do not want to waste too much time on trivial details.\n\nBe aware when you begin over-analyzing things. Stop, take a breath, make a decision, and move on.\n\n5. How Can I Stay Inspired?\n\nDesigning a piece of jewelry takes time, sometimes a long time. That initial inspirational spark might feel like it’s a dying ember.\n\nDon’t let that happen.\n\nTranslate that inspiration into images, colors, words, sample designs, and surround your work space with these.\n\nTalk about your inspiration in detail with family and friends.\n\n6. Won’t People Steal My Work?\n\nMany jewelry designers fear that if they show their work publicly, people will steal their ideas. So they stop designing.\n\nYet jewelry design is a very communicative process which requires introducing your work publicly. If you are not doing this, then you are creating simple sculptures, not jewelry.\n\nYes, other people may copy your work. See this source of doubt as an excuse. It is a self-imposed, but unnecessary, barrier we might impose to prevent us from experiencing that excitement as a jewelry designer. Other people will never be able to copy your design prowess — how you translate inspiration into a finished piece. That is unique and special to you. It is why the general public responds positively to you and your work.\n\n7. Over Confidence can blind you to the things you need to be doing and learning, and Under Confidence can hinder your development as a designer.\n\nToo often, we allow under confidence to deter us from the jewelry design and making tasks at hand. We always question our lack of ability and technical prowess for accomplishing the necessary tasks at hand. It is important, however, to believe in yourself. To believe that you can work things out when confronted with unfamiliar or problematic situations. It is important to develop your skills for thinking like a designer. Fluency. Flexibility. Originality. There is a vocabulary to learn. Techniques to learn. Strategies to learn. These develop over time with practice and experience. You need to believe in your abilities to develop as a designer over time.\n\nWith over confidence comes a naivete. You close off the wisdom to listen to what others have to say or offer. You stunt your development as an artist. You overlook important factors about materials and techniques to the detriment of your final designs and products. You close yourself off to doubt and self-doubt, which is unfortunate. Doubt and self-doubt are tools for asking questions and questioning things. These help you grow and develop as an artist and designer. These influence your ability to make good, professional choices in your career.\n\n8. Role Confusion\n\nJewelry artists play many roles and wear different hats. Each has its own set of opportunities, requirements, and pressures that the artist must cope with. It’s a balancing act extraordinaire.\n\nFirst, people who make jewelry wear different hats: Artist and Designer, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, and Exhibitor.\n\nSecond, people who make jewelry have different needs: Artistic Excellence, Recognition, Monetary Gain, or Financial Stability.\n\nThird, the artist needs to please and satisfy themselves, as well as other various clients.\n\nFourth, the artist constructs pieces which need to function in different settings: Situational, Cultural, Sociological, Psychological.\n\nLast, the artist must negotiate a betwixt and between situation — a rite of passage — as they relinquish control over the piece and its underlying inspirations to the wearer and the viewer, who have their own needs, desires and expectations.\n\nThis gets confusing. It affects how you pick materials and supplies. Which techniques you use. What marketing strategies you employ. How you value and price things. Anticipating who your audience is. And the list goes on.\n\nIt is important to be aware (metacognitive) of what role(s) you play when, and why. Given the role, it is important to understand the types of choices you need to make, when constructing a piece of jewelry. It is critical to understand the tradeoffs you will invariably end up making, and their consequences for the aesthetic, emotional and functional success of your pieces.\n\nSome Advice\n\nWhile doubt and self-doubt can hinder our development as jewelry designers, some degree of these may be helpful, as well.\n\nTo develop yourself as a jewelry designer, and to continue to grow and expand in your profession, you must have a balanced amount of both doubt and self-doubt. Uncertainty leads to questioning. A search for knowledge. Some acceptance of trial and error and experimentation. A yearning for more reliable information and feedback.\n\nJewelry design uses a great deal of emotion as a Way of Knowing. Emotions cloud or distort how we perceive things. They may lead to more doubt and worry and lack of confidence. But they also enhance our excitement when translating inspirations into designs.\n\n· Don’t let your inner doubts spin out of control. Be aware and suppress them.\n\n· Be real with yourself and your abilities.\n\n· Keep a journal. Detail what your doubts are and the things you are doing to overcome them.\n\n· Create a developmental plan for yourself. Identify the knowledge, skills and understandings you want to develop and grow into.\n\n· Remember what happened in the past the last time doubt got in your way. Remember what you did to overcome this doubt. Remember that probably nothing negative actually happened.\n\n· Talk to people. These can be friends, relatives and colleagues. Don’t keep doubts unto yourself.\n\n· Don’t compare yourself to others. This is a trap. Self-reflect and self-evaluate you on your own terms.\n\n· Worrying about what others think? The truth is that people don’t really care that much about what you do or not do.\n\n· Don’t beat yourself up.\n\n· Get re-inspired. This might mean surrounding yourself with images and photos of things. It might mean a walk in nature. It might me letting someone else’s excitement flow over to you.\n\n· Take breaks.\n\n· See setbacks as temporary.\n\n· Celebrate small steps.\n\n· Keep developing your skills.\n\n· Set goals for yourself.\n\n_______________________________\n\nI hope you found this article useful.

Are they the same? Does one precede the other? Do you have to have one in order to have another? Can you have one without either of the others? Are these experienced universally? Subjectively? Do we have to experience any one of them at all?\n\nThis becomes even more confusing when we add the idea of jewelry to the mix. Does jewelry make sex or sensuousness or sexuality more obvious, less obvious? An invitation? A warning? A restriction? An assistive guide for caressing? A symbolic assertion about beliefs? A signal about desire? A confidence booster for self-esteem and self-expression through sex? A gender marker?\n\nWe let jewelry touch our body, though not necessarily everywhere. Its placement on the body tells a story. We often use it to attract the gaze of others, but can as easily use it to restrict that gaze or redirect it or cause it to be forbidden entirely. Jewelry can be inviting to the touch, or disinviting. We can use jewelry to demand respect. We can use jewelry to demand consent.\n\nJewelry is something we desire for its look, its value, but most importantly, for how it serves our needs and desires. Jewelry, indeed, can express our desires publicly without our having to articulate them out loud to anyone. These desires can be very sexual and sensual. Or not. These desires can be directed at certain people with certain traits, and hidden from others.\n\nTake the necklace. In one culture it can signal that the viewer must keep his gaze above the silhouette boundary line. In another culture, it affirms for the viewer, as if it were a pointer, that it was OK to touch the breast, even encouraging it. In still another culture, the colors of the necklace determine if the situation is sacred (that is, no sex now), or is profane (sex now). The design, composition and color choices within the necklace might demonstrate which characteristics of any viewer were desirable, or not. The necklace might indicate if the woman was married and unavailable, married and available, or unmarried and, yes, available. It might broadcast femininity or masculinity.\n\nThe jewelry designer is one of the few types of professionals, typically healers, that people allow to touch their bodies. The jewelry designer is allowed to measure the wrist or the neck. Allowed to position the piece relative to the breasts. Allowed to dress the body, putting the earring on their ear, or the necklace around their neck, or the bracelet around their wrist, or the anklet around the ankle. Allowed to push them towards one emotional direction or another.\n\nEveryone has their own personal journey learning about sex, experiencing it, becoming aware of what feels sensual and what feels sexual. People set some boundaries about what they find appealing and what they find repugnant. And they often rely on jewelry to signify all this.\n\nMy Personal Journey\n\nMy personal journey has had ups and downs and ins and outs and this ways and that ways. I consider myself gay. But I am still attracted to women, including having sex with women — I always have been so — but I like sex with men better, so I label myself gay. Not bi, not poly, not sapio, not asexual nor unisexual, not heteroflexible nor homoflexible, not fluid nor a switch. I did not consider myself gay, though, until I was in my 20’s.\n\nWhen I was 7 or 8, I used to fool around with Jay Smith. We would hide in the basement. Drop our pants. Grab each other’s genitals. This wasn’t gay. This was play. Homoerotic sexually, but not sensually. There was no desire here. No passion. We stopped playing when we were 9, but kept this a secret between us.\n\nWhen I was 10 or 11, I would stop at a gas station on my way walking home from school. The gas station had a little convenience store attached to it. In the store, there was a rack of porn books (hetero only, of course). I shop-lifted many on many occasions. And what I did with them, well, I’d probably make Portnoy in Portnoy’s Complaint blush. Of course, both Portnoy and I had the mother thing — the complaint! — in common. My mother did catch me with these porno books once. She made me return them. [A lot of material here for another book, but I digress.] I re-stocked later on. Would you have expected any less of me?\n\nFrom the first grade, when I was 6, until the sixth grade, when I was 12, I always remember having at least one girlfriend. Sometimes it was the same girl — that’s you, Arlene — but at different times in different grades. Sometimes it was two or three girls in my class. I repeatedly tried to kiss them on many occasions. This would probably be labeled some kind of date rape today. But it, too, was play. I always thought that I’d settle down with a woman, have two kids, a house, a dog and a yard.\n\nThe only jarring disruption occurred in second grade. The teacher was Miss O’Neal. She was very sensual, I could not help noticing, even at my young age. Miss O’Neal loved David. I was extremely jealous. I wanted her to love me. My second grade teacher was hot, what can I say. All through the school year, I wanted her to love on me, as she repeatedly did to David. She would gently place her hands on David’s face, covering each cheek with one hand. She would stare into his eyes and say, “Oohhhhhh…. David!” The words came out slowly, softly, deliberately, as if their sound struggled to never end. She slowly raised David’s head up closer to hers. Her lips would meet his. I tried every Machiavellian thing I could think of at my age of 7 to try to get her to gently stroke my cheeks, and say, “Oohhhhh… Warren!”, and share that kiss. Never happened. Could care less that this teacher was most likely a pedophile. “Oohhhhhh…. David!” Damn David.\n\nJEWELRY DESIGNS CREATE EMOTIONS\n\nAs a child, you are never certain about what your emotions are. How they came to be. How they get expressed. What they mean. But as you age, the recognition — conscious, subconscious or otherwise –of senses and their relationship to desires, sex and sexuality gets ever clearer. Sex with sensuality.\n\nA good jewelry designer helps steer the wearer and the buyer towards positive emotions. And in turn, positive emotions often form the core of the designer’s inspirations.\n\nBecause of this, jewelry designers need a deeper understanding of types of emotions and their psychological underpinnings. They need to be in touch with themselves about how they experience and reflect sexuality and sensuousness. They need to be able to translate these emotions into jewelry designs where their wearers and buyers share similar emotional understandings.\n\nJewelry, on one level, encapsulates sensuality. Even the plainest, simplest pieces wreak of it. People sense this emotionally as they interact with their jewelry as worn. The sensations of the wearing of jewelry and the touching of jewelry and the seeing of jewelry can feel good.\n\nPeople, in fact, develop emotions with jewelry on three levels of sensuality: (1) visceral (intrinsic), (2) behavioral (behavior), and reflective (reflection).\n\n(1) Visceral (wants to feel): attractiveness, first impressions, feelings\n\n(2) Behavioral (wants to do): usability, function, performance, effectiveness\n\n(3) Reflective (wants to be): meaning, impact, shared experience, psycho-socio-cultural fit\n\nPeople use their mastery of sensuality to attract others. These might be friends. These might be mates. This mastery might hold over time, or be ephemeral within a particular situation. Wearing jewelry, buying jewelry, making jewelry all contribute to making this mastery simpler, easier to apply and manipulate. And spill over into sex, if the wearer wants that.\n\nYes, I Did Go To The Prom\n\nJunior high and high school, for me, were almost a complete sexual bust. I fooled around with some girls, but there was always this racial barrier. I was Jewish, and that was a deal breaker over and over again. I attended some Jewish youth groups parties and mixers, but these were far away from where I lived. There was sex, but no sustained relationships.\n\nIn my senior year in high school, I did have a girlfriend for awhile. Her name was Jean. She was Church of Christ, and her parents were very, very wary of me. They said so. And while they were not liberal in any sense of the term, they let their daughter date me. They were unaware that we had sexual relations. I took her to the prom. Never saw her again after I graduated.\n\nAlso, when I was a senior in high school, I became very close to another student — Geoff. We had a very deep, platonic, male-to-male relationship. One night, we were outside talking, and he turned me around, and for no other reason than an especially strong feeling of closeness, he kissed me.\n\nMy reaction was quick. I turned stiff. I pulled away sharply. This was very disgusting to me. Two guys kissing. Made me very uncomfortable.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I found that I was disappointed in myself. Why shouldn’t two people, regardless of gender, be able to express their closeness with a kiss? I struggled with this. But a few weeks later, again later at night, outdoors, talking about whatever, I turned to him and kissed him. I felt OK about this.\n\nSEX, SEXUALITY, AND SENSUALITY\n\nAs a jewelry designer, you have to be very aware of the roles jewelry plays in sex, sexuality and sensuality. The act of sex. Everything leading up to it. Attraction. Intimacy. Pleasure. Eroticism. The sensations experienced and summed up by the label sensuality. The sexuality as an interpretation about how one wants to express their sensuality within the sexual act.\n\nIt is important to differentiate sex from sensuality. Sensuality is how the jewelry brings out the sensual — the gratification of the appetite for visuals, sounds, tastes, smells and touch. Sensuality always makes jewelry desirable. More attractive. More intimate. More pleasurable. More erotic. But perhaps no two people experience the sensuality of a piece of jewelry in the same way.\n\nSex, on the other hand, is sex. It can be mechanical, but more preferably, passionate. It can be a simple kiss, or completion of an act. The desire here is simple and limited. It’s simply a desire to maximize the biological. Sensuality adds emotion to this. Intimacy. Sexuality is how we desire to express sex and sensuality publicly. We need sex, sexuality and sensuality as human beings. We need to manage these through our choices about composition, construction and manipulation as designers.\n\nPart of managing sex, sensuality and sexuality is to understand the different roles jewelry plays in their expression. These sex-sexuality-sensuality roles, among others, include,\n\n(1) The Peacock Role\n\n(2) The Gender Role\n\n(3) The Safe Sex Role\n\nSee if you recognize any of these.\n\nOne sexual-sensual role of jewelry is the Peacock Role. People wear personal adornment to attract the viewer’s attention. This means that the jewelry not only needs to be flashy enough, or at least stylishly coherent, but also must contain culturally meaningful elements that the viewer will recognize and be sufficiently meaningful as to motivate the viewer to focus his or her attention on the jewelry and who is wearing it.\n\nThese culturally meaningful elements might include the use of color(s), talismans, shapes, forms. They clue the viewer to what is good, appealing, appropriate, and to what is not. But the jewelry must also provide clues to the individuality of the wearer — her (or his) personal style, social or cultural preferences, personal senses of the situation in which they find themselves.\n\nAnother of these sexuality-sensuality roles — The Gender Role — is to define gender and gender-rooted culture. Certain jewelry, jewelry styles, and ways of wearing jewelry are associated with females, and others with males. Some are used to signal androgyny, others non-binary identity, polyamory or gender fluidity. You can easily label which jewelry looks more masculine, and which more feminine. Some jewelry is associated with heterosexuality, and others with homosexuality. I remember when men, in a big way, started wearing one earring stud, it was critical to remember whether to wear the stud in the left ear lobe (hetero) or the right one (gay). For engaged and married women, it is important to recognize which style of ring is more appropriate, and which hand and finger to wear these on.\n\nOne of the most important sexuality-sensuality roles, however — The Safe Sex Role — concerns the placement of jewelry on the body. Placement will garner either attention or movement or both. Such placement is suggestive of where it is safe, and where it is unsafe, to look at (attention) or to touch (movement) the person wearing it. The length of the necklace, relative to the neck, the breast, or below the breast. How long the earring extends below the lobe of the ear. Whether the person wears bracelets. The size of the belt buckle. If a person has body piercings, where these are — the navel, the eyebrow, the nose, the lip.\n\nJewelry calls attention to areas of the body the wearer feels are safe to view or touch. It’s like taking a sharpie marker and drawing a boundary line across the body. Jewelry gives the viewer permission to look at these areas, say above the line, and not others below the line. Jewelry may give the viewer permission to touch these areas, as well. The wearer may want to call attention to the face, the neck, the hands, the ankle, but also to the breasts, the naval, the genital area.\n\nWe know that certain areas of the body are more sexually arousing than others. We know that different people are more or less comfortable with these areas on the body. But how does the wearer communicate that? How does the wearer communicate her (or his) personal views of what is sexually acceptable without having to physically and verbally interact with someone in order for that person to find out? Taking many minutes and 10’s of minutes before interacting and using this time to espouse your personal sexual philosophy of life can really be a buzz kill.\n\nJewelry. How jewelry is worn is one of the most critical and strategic ways for achieving this Safe-Sex goal. The linear form of the jewelry imposes a boundary line on the body. Do not cross it. And make no mistake, this boundary line separates the permissible from the impermissible, the non-erotic from the erotic, the safe from the unsafe. In a similar way the centerpiece focuses attention as if it were an arrow pointing the way. Jewelry is not just a style preference thing. It’s a safe-sex preference thing, as well.\n\nWhen news of the AIDS epidemic first burst on-stage in the 1980s, you witnessed a very dramatic change in jewelry and how it was worn. Right before the AIDS epidemic, large, long earrings were in style. Remember shoulder dusters. But as awareness of AIDS spread, most women stopped wearing earrings for awhile. Then gradually, they began wearing studs. Then very small hoops. It wasn’t until around 2004 that some women wore the new chandelier earrings, and you saw longer earrings on actresses as they paraded down the red carpets of one award show after another.\n\nPrior to AIDS, the necklace style was for longer necklaces — 24” to 36” long. The necklaces were full — multi-strand, lots of charms and dangles. Again, as awareness of AIDS spread, the necklace profile changed rapidly to no necklace at all, or to thin, short chains and chokers. You would typically find ONE tiny charm, not many, on a necklace. Attention was pulled away from the genital area, the navel and the breasts, all the way back up to the face.\n\nPrior to AIDS, necklaces and earrings were the best-sellers in my store. After AIDS, it became bracelets. Holding hands. Not necking. Not fondling. Not kissing the neck. Not sexual intercourse. Holding hands was now the acceptable norm. This was safe.\n\nBody piercings came into major vogue during the 1980s. And look what typically got pierced in this decade. Noses, belly buttons, eyebrows, lips. Think of this as a big Body Chart for safe sex. It was not until the early 2000’s that nipple piercings and genital piercings became widespread.\n\nAs society became more understanding of AIDS and how it spread, the jewelry became larger. It extended to more areas of the body. People wore more of it. But in 2009, it was still restrained, when compared to what people wore before the 1980s.\n\nIn the sexual hunt between the sexes, jewelry plays an important boundary-defining role. Let’s not forget about this. Jewelry, in some sense, is an embodiment of desire. Jewelry communicates to others how the wearer comes to define what desire might mean for the self. It communicates through placement, content, embellishment and elaboration.\n\nJewelry does not have to be visibly erotic, or include visual representations of sexual symbols, in order to play a role in sexuality and desire — a role that helps the hunter and the hunted define some acceptable rules for interacting without verbal communication.\n\nCollege\n\nI went to Brandeis University for college. This was a Jewish sponsored but secular institution. A large Jewish student body.\n\nDuring my freshman year in college, I was a sexual pig. You would not have liked me. Or respected me. I showed little respect to women. It was all about sex and conquest. I pushed boundaries. Inappropriately. I formed untenable attachments. I pushed a friend too far, and I knew it. But did it anyway. And lost a friend.\n\nLosing this friend bothered me a lot. I’m still atoning for that.\n\nI changed my ways.\n\nWhen I was a junior, I became very serious as a student. I studied all the time. I was eager to learn things. Philosophically. Practically. Artistically.\n\nAfter awhile, however, I could no longer suppress my sexual desires. My academic self was fighting my sexual self. My academic self was losing. I did not have time to form relationships. And I no longer felt comfortable taking sexual advantage of the girls around me.\n\nFor several months, I began to visit the red light district of Boston. I’d visit the gay movie theaters and have random sex. It was fun. It was a release.\n\nThen I tired of it.\n\nAdornment and Sexuality\n\nJewelry has been intertwined with sexuality and sensuality throughout history. Some cultures linked them with abandon; others feared such linkage. The movement of Buddhism from its origin in India to further east through Indochina, China and eventually Japan, is a key example of all this. In India, Buddhism was strongly linked to sexuality, and jewelry was very intricate, elaborate and elaborated and adorned all parts of the body. By the time Buddhism arrived in Japan, it had become more and more detached. In Japan, they passed a law forbidding the wearing of any jewelry that was anything but functional. Wearing jewelry as a belt buckle (netsuke) or as in the hair to keep it in place was acceptable; wearing jewelry for other than functional reasons was not, and was punishable by the authorities.\n\nFunctionality, however, could not fully contain the power of jewelry to excite, entice, attract. Functional jewelry was still made from valued materials like gold and jade and ivory. Functional jewelry still had sparkle and combinations of colors and patterns and textures of which people desired to see and touch and bring that experience into their inner selves. Functional jewelry could still be used to enhance a person’s physical features. Functional jewelry could not suppress the needs of people to interact sexually and sensuously, no matter how hard the authorities tried to make it.\n\nJewelry as adornment is a symbol of desire. And the exchange of desires. Whether a wedding ring or a gift to adorn the neck, jewelry makes it impossible to escape this symbolism.\n\nJewelry can be used to articulate eroticism. It can be very obvious like a nipple ring, or more subtle, such as where the jewelry, in its design, points to an erotic zone on your body. The sensation and perception of jewelry can influence the experience of pleasure, arousal, and intimacy in sexual and sensual contexts.\n\nJewelry can be used to signify someone’s gender or gender identity. It might take the look of a rainbow LBGTQ+ form. It might incorporate symbols specific to female or male genders, or specific to sexual preferences.\n\nWearing jewelry may be empowering. It may lead an individual to feel more confident in sex or in their sexuality and self-expression.\n\nJewelry has a power to physically and emotionally pull one person towards another. It can be used to overcome any shyness or hesitancy in initiating a relationship or following through on any attraction.\n\nWhen I Design Jewelry\n\nI design jewelry for all kinds of people for all kinds of events and situations. Often, when I am not doing custom work for a client, and I get to design something I want from scratch, I try to visualize a woman wearing the piece in context. I want the woman to feel that, by wearing my jewelry, she is somehow more attractive, more sensual, more powerful. I want my sense of desire to match her sense of desire.\n\nMy woman is in her late 30s / early 40s. She has some kind of career. She likes to dance. I always picture my woman wearing my piece on the dance floor. In a nightclub. Fast, not slow dancing. No matter what vantage point anyone else in the room is, and no matter what positioning of her body is in while she dances, my jewelry is designed to attract. To draw attention. To hold that attention. To experience that sensuality of the piece as she might experience it.\n\nMy jewelry is not garish. It is subtle. Parts of it are to be seen head-on. Other parts to be noticed from the sides. The parts comprising the whole composition form a vernacular that can be easily articulated. Other parts are designed to heighten experiences only. I visualize the necklace moving side to side, front and back, up and down, as she moves on the dance floor. And I want it always to look good, no matter its orientation relative to the other vantages points around the room.\n\nThere is always a subtle edginess. But not too much. The colors extend just beyond the boundaries of a color scheme. The textures vary always a step too far. A pattern will need more than a few words to describe. A concurrent formality and informality. I use adaptable elements so my pieces can work for more than one body type or for more than one situation.\n\nMy pieces must feel good to wear. I am always aware of that sense of touch. They must be comfortable, so I spend a great deal of thinking and reflection time about how to build in architectural features to make this so.\n\nMy woman wants to wear my jewelry over and over again. Not because she has to. Not because she is told to. Not because she is conforming to some social or cultural norm. But because it makes her feel good about herself. It is transformative. It projects a sensual, sexual, positive self-image to those around her.\n\nTo Exist Is To Be Sexual\n\nTo be authentic, to feel free, a person must be allowed to make choices about how to sexually express themselves, and to what degree such expression morphs into desire, identity and orientation. The contemporary jewelry designer has to rise above any societal or cultural norms which impact on or restrict this expression. The designer must be supremely cognitive of how that designer’s personal framework on life gets imposed on their jewelry all the while maintaining that sense of authenticity critical to whether someone will want to wear or buy their pieces.\n\nJewelry design becomes an act of reconciliation. There are the designer’s sexual and sensual preferences. There is the jewelry as a reflection of these things. There are the wearer’, viewer’, buyer’, exhibitor’, collector’, teacher’, student’s sexual and sensual preferences. There is the jewelry so designed in anticipation of these other preferences. Choices about silhouette, shapes, colors, forms, patterns, textures, themes. These choices lead to this reconciliation. Jewelry, and how it influences attention and movement, has a major role to play, triggering all this.\n\nTo be sexual is to grapple with questions about intimacy. Jewelry assists in setting the stage for such intimacy between two individuals. What jewelry is. What it is made of. How it is worn. When it is worn. Jewelry may lead these individuals to conclusions about the significance of their relationship, and the role of intimacy within it. Or it may fail to do that. In this latter case, the designer, in many respects, has failed in their design. The designer is a professional. She or he has a professional obligation to design jewelry in line with the values and desires of the client. Intimacy is one critical, valued desire which the jewelry design must design for.\n\nIn a concurrent way, jewelry should affect the situation between any two, intimate individuals whereby the experience of intimacy is pleasant, positive, fulfilling. Jewelry should reduce the anxiety and dread which can arise from thinking about sex, sensuality, sexuality and their expression through intimacy. The experience of sex can be fleeting. But the desire is that it be intimate and enduring. Jewelry can secure that desire. It makes things feel permanent, rather than impermanent. Persisting, rather than temporary. Impactful within a relationship, rather than chaotic or destructive.\n\nAs sex transforms into the sensual, this brings more pleasure, engagement, a heightened physical experience, a more aesthetic quality to the relationship. Jewelry plays a significant role in shaping a person’s subjective experience of existence, in this case, sex. Jewelry brings to the fore all those unarticulated, unformulated feelings, visions, tastes, smells, sensations of being alive. This allows the individual to transcend any narrow definitions they may have about the meaning and purpose of their lives. It allows them to surpass the limits of their everyday existence. That increased sensuality, which the jewelry has assisted in triggering, forces the individual to question how all this pleasure aligns with their sense of authenticity. In other words, jewelry impacts an individuals’ relationship with their desires, pleasures and bodily experiences.\n\nMy Decision To Be Gay\n\nWhen I was 21, my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She survived one more year. The last four months of her life were spent in Sloan Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. I lived in New Brunswick, NJ at the time, was attending Rutgers University to get a Masters in City and Regional Planning. I was also serving as a health planner in New Brunswick.\n\nI would take every opportunity to take the train into New York, and spend time with my mother. She was on high dosages of morphine. She lay quietly on her bed, darkened skin shrunk tightly on her skeletal body. I sat there. Sad, scared, horrified, in denial. She once suddenly sat up and shouted, “Ike,” then lay back down in a drug-induced slumber. I guess she liked Ike.\n\nWhen I would leave the hospital, I made my way down to the red light district. Just as I had done in Boston. It was a way to leave the real world and pretend nothing bad was happening. It was a way to relieve all the stresses which overwhelmed every part of my conscious and physical being.\n\nBack in New Brunswick, I had been dating two women. At various times, I had considered marriage to each. But the timing was all wrong. I was trying to get established in a career. I was dealing with family dynamics and responsibilities now turned topsy turvy because of my mom’s illness and eventual death. Neither Jeanne nor Robin was sufficiently empathetic to my plight. The emotional distance between each of them and myself kept widening.\n\nI cannot put all the blame on them. I was a lousy communicator. I never articulated what was going on in my head. I hid half my sexual self. I’m sure these unspoken things irritated them.\n\nWhen I moved to North Carolina to get my doctorate, one relationship ended, and the other I allowed, but shouldn’t have allowed, to slowly, over many years, die on the vine.\n\nI continued this pattern of dating women and running off to the gay bars for several years. Then the AIDS epidemic came, beginning on the coasts, but eventually working its way to the South and Midwest. I was a professor at Ole Miss with an apartment in Memphis when AIDS began to color my life.\n\nThere were many friends and many sex-partners in Memphis who came down with AIDS and died. One after another after another. I slammed the breaks on sex, though it took awhile to slow down.\n\nNow I was living in Nashville. I had taken a job as a health policy planner with the state of Tennessee. I was lonely. Bored with the women and the men I was dating. I had a little conversation with myself: the next interesting and creative person I meet — man or woman — that’s the path I’m going to follow.\n\nI met James.\n\nSex And The Single Rogue Elephant\n\nLet me get this straight, right up front. Finding your Rogue Elephant doesn’t mean to have sex with him. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nBut, on the other hand, this is not to make your Rogue Elephant asexual. He is not.\n\nHe likes his ears stroked. A gently pressure applied with both hands, one on one side and the other on the other, with a slow movement toward the ear’s end, can feel very sensual for him. With a warm attachment to you.\n\nPlayfully petting him, and playfully twirling the hair on his body, is all so sensuous for him.\n\nHis trunk can be warm and wet, or rough and dry.\n\nHe doesn’t stand there waiting for you to comfort him.\n\nComfort comes in the details.\n\nAs you bead him.\n\nAnd as he roams.\n\n_______________________________\n\nI hope you found this article useful.

How to gain the necessary design skills and be able to apply them, whether the situation is familiar or not.\n\n588pp, many images and diagrams Ebook , Kindle or Print formats\n\nThe Jewelry Journey Podcast\n\n“Building Jewelry That Works: Why Jewelry Design Is Like Architecture”\n\nPodcast, Part 1\n\nPodcast, Part 2\n\nPEARL KNOTTING…Warren’s Way\n\nEasy. Simple. No tools. Anyone Can Do!\n\nI developed a nontraditional technique which does not use tools because I found tools get in the way of tying good and well-positioned knots. I decided to bring two cords through the bead to minimize any negative effects resulting from the pearl rotating around the cord. I only have you glue one knot in the piece. I use a simple overhand knot which is easily centered. I developed a rule for choosing the thickness of your bead cord. I lay out different steps for starting and ending a piece, based on how you want to attach the piece to your clasp assembly.\n\n184pp, many images and diagrams Ebook, Kindle or Print\n\nSO YOU WANT TO DO CRAFT SHOWS: 16 Lessons I Learned Doing Craft Shows\n\nIn this book, I discuss 16 lessons I learned, Including How To (1) Find, Evaluate and Select Craft Shows Right for You, (2) Determine a Set of Realistic Goals, (3) Compute a Simple Break-Even Analysis, (4) Develop Your Applications and Apply in the Smartest Ways, (5) Understand How Much Inventory to Bring, (6) Set Up and Present Both Yourself and Your Wares, (7) Best Promote and Operate Your Craft Show Business before, during and after the show.\n\n198pp, many images and diagrams, Ebook, Kindle or Print\n\nBASICS OF BEAD STRINGING AND ATTACHING CLASPS\n\nLearning Bead Stringing Is More Than\n\nPutting Beads On A String And Tying On A Clasp\n\nThere is an art and skill to stringing beads. First, of course, is the selection of beads for a design, and the selection of the appropriate stringing material. Then is the selection of a clasp or closure, appropriate to the design and use of the piece.\n\nYou want your pieces to be appealing. You want them to wear well. You want someone to wear them or buy them. This means understanding the basic techniques, not only in terms of craft and art, but also with considerations about architecture, mechanics, and some sociology, anthropology and psychology.\n\nIn this book, I go into depth about: (1) Choosing stringing materials, and the pros and cons of each type, (2) Choosing clasps, and the pros and cons of different clasps, (3) All about the different jewelry findings and how you use them, (4) Architectural considerations and how to build these into your pieces, (5) How better designers use cable wires and crimp, as well as, use needle and thread to string beads, (6) How best to make stretchy bracelets, (7) How to make adjustable slip knots, coiled wire loops, and silk wraps, (8) How to finish off the ends of thicker cords or ropes, so that you can attach a clasp, (9) How to construct such projects as eyeglass leashes, mask chains, lariats, multi-strand pieces, twist multi-strand pieces, and memory wire bracelets, (10) How different teaching paradigms — craft vs. art vs. design — might influence the types of choices you make.\n\n452 pp, many images, illustrations, diagrams, Ebook, Kindle or Print\n\n___________________________________________\n\nI looked around, and there was no one whose life I wanted.\n\nNo one’s routine. No one’s status or power or celebrity. No one’s legacy.\n\nAnd yet, I wanted others to want my life, my values, my perspectives, my convictions. Even, though. Even, though. Even, though. Even, though, I was yet to live my full life or fully define and clarify my values, my perspectives, my too-often changing convictions.\n\nI’m not poor, but I’m not wealthy either. I’m not wealthy enough to get a building named after me at some university, or to be included in those all-too-often pay-to-play opportunities such as getting a board seat in a prominent nonprofit organization. I can’t use money, position or power to impose my legacy on anyone. Of course, I fantasize that I can, but I can’t.\n\nBut I can try to live out my life in a purposeful way, and hope that some kind of legacy emerges from that. Results from that. Takes over from that. I have doubts that it will.\n\nIn any case, I have not lived my life in a straight-forward purposeful way. While there’s always some kind of purpose in the background, it doesn’t feel like I’m in charge. I might be too insignificant. Survival has probably been the biggest purpose. But there is no flow to my existence. There’s a dart in one way, then another. A jumping off a cliff or two. A few dead ends.\n\nWhen I was 9 years old, I had an ultimate purpose. I thought I would fail as an adult guy if I didn’t get hairy arms. My friend Gary had hairy arms, but I did not. That bothered me. A lot. Gary would get to high school and be OK. I would not, at least with my currently hairless arms. No one would notice me. Listen to me. Let me participate with them in anything. Connect with me. No one. Not without hairy arms.\n\nOne day, I asked Gary how he got such hairy arms. He told me he ate a lot of peanut butter sandwiches. Well, I could do that. So, for the next several months, I ate a lot of peanut butter sandwiches. Every day. Sometimes 20 sandwiches a day. I didn’t get hairy arms, at least not then. But I did get fat.\n\nMy legacy.\n\nLegacy And The Jewelry Designer\n\nI didn’t begin making jewelry in order to leave a legacy. I began making jewelry to make money. That’s it. Didn’t care about beauty. Didn’t care about durability. Could care less if the buyer fulfilled their wishes and desires. Just give me the money.\n\nBut as I began to sense that Rogue Elephant somewhere out there waiting for me, things began to change. I designed some pieces for which I wanted to document — written patterns and sketches, photos, some sharing of information and photos. Then more pieces I wanted to preserve in memory.\n\nAs I created more custom pieces for people, particularly celebrity musicians and actors, I wanted to preserve these pieces rather than hand them off, so I made duplicates of these and showcased them.\n\nMy jewelry designs became more expressive. Impactful for people who wore or bought them. I created more ways to showcase them. Personal and business pages on all the social media sites. My own website. More frequent online posts. An artist statement and a portfolio. Workshops and kits to show others how to recreate these pieces. My jewelry was powerful enough to express my vision about the world and why people wear jewelry. My jewelry became a means for exploring how people become fluent in design. My jewelry became a framework through which to challenge and inspire others to think differently than craftsmen and differently than artists when designing their own jewelry creations.\n\nI often wonder who will inherit my jewelry once I am gone. Will I be remembered for my design work and my design philosophy? Will my ideas endure?\n\nI remember when one of my pieces was accepted for inclusion in a book. “ Little Tapestries/Ghindia (http://www.warrenfeldjewelry.com/wfjghindia.htm )” — was juried into the book SHOWCASE 500 BEADED JEWELRY, Lark Publications. August 2012, listed on Amazon.com at http://amzn.to/z6tZH2 . This played to my ego very well.\n\nWhen I received my own copy of this book and found the image for Little Tapestries/Ghindia, I felt a lot like in the movie Working Girl. There’s that last shot before the credits roll. The heroine finally gets into the executive suite and gets her own office. The camera focuses first on the window outside her office. Then it slowly pans back, eventually revealing hundreds and hundreds of office windows stacked up on the side of a tall skyscraper.\n\nThe Ugly Necklace Contest\n\nThe International Ugly Necklace Contest (http://www.warrenfeldjewelry.com/wfjuglynecklace.htm ). This is part of my legacy, I’m sure of this. I know this. A writeup about this contest and its design principles was included as a chapter in Margie Deeb’s book THE BEADER’S GUIDE TO JEWELRY DESIGN (https://www.amazon.com/Beaders-Guide-Jewelry-Design-Exploration/dp/1454704063).\n\nIt turns out, it is not easy to do Ugly! Our brains are prewired with an anxiety response. We are preset to avoid snakes and spiders and anything that might harm us. So it is very difficult to design an ugly necklace. We are biased towards beauty and harmony and things which won’t upset us. To achieve a truly hideous result, you have to be a very accomplished jewelry designer. You gotta know your stuff. Intimately. Fluently.\n\nMoreover, necklaces are arranged in a circle. The circle shape itself errs on the side of beauty, and anything arranged, ordered or organized, such as the component parts of a necklace, will err on the side of beauty.\n\nTo top things off, we required the necklace to be wearable. Design-wise, this was another push away from Ugly.\n\n[See The International Ugly Necklace Contest (http://www.warrenfeldjewelry.com/wfjuglynecklace.htm ) ]\n\nThe contest had been inspired by some work I was doing. In the late 1990s, our business collapsed and we went bankrupt. One of the things we did was to start up the jewelry and bead business again from scratch. While we did that, to pay the bills, I worked remotely with two companies as a website marketer. One company was in New Hope, Pennsylvania; the other in Vancouver, British Columbia. I was in Nashville. Both companies would link me up to various clients, and I would optimize their websites for search engines and do various online promotions to get them more visibility.\n\nOne client was SureFit that made slip covers for chairs and couches. Every year, they held an Ugly Couch contest. I was involved with some of the marketing for their contest. This was the origin of my idea for ugly necklaces. While the criteria for the Ugly Couch contest were simply color / pattern / texture, the criteria for judging jewelry could be so much more elaborated. I took this contest and its judging criteria further into the realm of physiology, cognition and design. But still in ‘English’. Still focusing on the fun. But subtly introducing the design philosophy ideas.\n\nWe launched the first The Ugly Necklace Contest in 2002, and held it 10 times over the next 15 years.\n\nDesigners were asked to push themselves to make hard choices, such things as:\n\n· Can I push myself to use more yellow than the purple warrants, and mix in some orange?\n\n· Can I make the piece off-sided or disorienting, or not have a clear beginning, middle or end?\n\n· Can I disrupt my pattern in a way that, rather than “jazz,” results in “discord?”\n\n· Can I work with colors and materials and patterns and textures and placements and proportions I don’t like?\n\n· Can I design something I do not personally like, and perhaps am unwilling, to wear around my neck?\n\n· Can I create a piece of jewelry that represents some awful feeling, emotion or experience I’m uncomfortable with?\n\n· Can I make something I know that others won’t like, and may ridicule me for it?\n\nBecause answering questions like these is not something people like to do, and in fact, avoid, jewelry designers who attempt to achieve “Ugly,” have to have a lot of control and discipline to override, perhaps overcome, intuitive, internally integrated principles of artistic beauty. The best jewelry designers, therefore, will be those designers who can prove that they can design a truly Ugly Necklace. These are designers who can break the boundaries of form, material and technique. That was the crux of the contest.\n\nWe often like to say that beauty (and by inference, ugly) is in the eye of the beholder. But once we utter that phrase, we deny the possibilities of design — and the perspective on beauty or ugly from the eye of the designer. If we are preset to create things that have some beauty to them, perhaps anyone then could create appealing jewelry. But, if we take away too much power to create from the designer — something beautiful or something ugly — we begin to deny the need for the designer in the first place. We leave too much to the situation, and too little to our abilities as jewelry designers to translate inspiration into aspiration into finished designs which emotionally affect those around us. We lose the experiencing of each individual designer’s choices in taking inspirations into finished designs. The challenge of designing an Ugly Necklace shows us that without the designer, there can be no design, no resonant beauty, no parsimonious attention to appeal, no true and full authenticity underlying a piece of jewelry.\n\nWe made the contest international. We launched it on-line. Our goal was to politely influence the entire beading and jewelry making communities to think in different terms and to try to work outside the box. We also wanted very actively to stimulate discussion about whether there are universal and practical design theories which underlie beadwork and jewelry design, and which can be taught. Or was everything merely a matter of subjective interpretation.\n\nVery enlightening for me, for our judges, for our students, for the participants and the larger jewelry making community.\n\nDefinitely a legacy. Most definitely a lot of fun. But still not enough for me. I still felt I had so many disparate things to bring together under the banner Jewelry Designer. I didn’t know what. I didn’t know where to find it. Wasn’t sure what I was doing. My felt purpose was still cloudy.\n\nLiving Out Other People’s Legacies\n\nI had to reach a much older age before I began to seriously think about my legacy. Yet, over the years, looking back, I think, for the most part, I was living out other people’s legacies. Sometimes perfectly, other times rejecting them.\n\nMy grandfather — my father’s father — in heavily accented, broken English, would say every time he saw me: You be pharmacist. All you need is one clerk. I’m sure that was my father’s wish as well. He wanted me to be a pharmacist and take over his pharmacy once he retired. I was always a big disappointment. Never even tried to become a pharmacist.\n\nI attended Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, for my undergraduate work. It is a university made up primarily of minorities — Jews, blacks, Latinos, Asians, poor whites. The students colloquially called Brandeis a second rate Jewish Harvard, because whether student or professor or employee, as Jews (or, this extends to other oppressed minorities), when Brandeis was founded in the 1950s, Harvard’s doors were closed to them.\n\nBrandeis has a strong commitment to social justice. It saturates you with that commitment. An infusion. You are told and guided and influenced and challenged to find Truth Until Its Innermost Parts. An emphasis on the importance of authenticity and integrity. A yearning for social justice seeps into your brain and blood and pores. You can never shake it off. It never leaves you. It has never left me.\n\nBut perhaps the most important and sustaining other person’s legacy I have been living has been that of my life partner, Jayden. Jayden and I were together over 36 years.\n\nWhen I met Jayden, Jayden was James. We met in a local bar in Nashville. At the time, I had lived in Nashville a couple of years. I was trying to find friends and trying to date and was always disappointed. The people I was meeting were kind of dull. Not particularly worldly. And definitely not very creative. At the time, most Nashvillians my age left Nashville for other places where they were more likely to find a spouse. And then they would return to Nashville. People my age that I worked with or met here in Nashville were already married.\n\nI dated both men and women. Virtually all of them were waiters, waitresses or hair dressers. At one point, I was so frustrated and so in need of a close human relationship, that I had a little conversation with God in my head. God, I said, the next very creative person I meet — man or woman — will be the way I want to go. I met James. I became gay.\n\nJames was the epitome of creativity. So was his whole family. Every craft you could think of, he was an accomplished artist. Leatherwork. Jewelry. Construction. Interior design. I could learn so much from him. He could teach me so much.\n\nOriginally from Alabama, James moved to Nashville. He was driving a truck at the time. It was during a recession, and he was having difficulty finding another job. At one point I asked what he could do, and he said he could design jewelry. I said, we could build a business around that.\n\nDuring this same time, I was directing a nonprofit healthcare organization, and was burnt out. Feeling very disconnected, and wanting to do something else. I quit my job. Jumped into retail. The rest is history: garage sale to flea market to physical store to the addition of an online catalog (www.landofodds.com ).\n\nOur relationship was always contentious. Lots of heated back and forth. Disagreements about life, about business, about friends and relationships. James had grown up in a home where physical and emotional abuse was the rule of the day. Both his father and his mother punished him, broke bones, poured grits on the floor and made him kneel on them for hours. His father was an iterant preacher, and when James was a boy, his father, in exchange for work or money, let other preachers sexually abuse him. James never had any sense of basic trust for anyone. As an adult, he had difficulty relinquishing control. Sometimes, I feel, he confused me with his father.\n\nWhen we were together about 23 years, James decided he needed to become Jayden. He underwent all the surgeries, and lived the rest of life as a woman. By that time, our relationship long since had ceased to become romantic or sexual. We were very close friends. Business partners. We stayed together. Friends, therapists always questioned my continued loyalty. Given all the tensions in our relationship, why did I remain loyal? Why didn’t I just leave?\n\nJayden had opened up the world I needed to live in. I learned from her until the point where, to continue to develop as a professional and as an artist, I needed to rely on myself. Legacy was no longer imitation. It had become inspiration. I was becoming the jewelry designer Jayden had wanted to become, but lacked the skills, insights, and energy. I was living out her legacy. But I was finding my own path, too.\n\nHer health was deteriorating rapidly.\n\nI stayed.\n\nIs Legacy The Same As Celebrity Status?\n\nProfessionally, I hit a spot where many people knew of me. I had a very positive, shining reputation. But I lacked that magnetic force which would bring people to me. I could offer a workshop, but not fill it with students. I could start an online discussion about jewelry design, but not get enough people to continue to discuss things.\n\nPart of the problem was me. I was a slave to my retail store. I did not have enough free hours to get outside the store and network, whether in the Nashville area, or nationally, or even internationally. Perhaps, if I were out there more, I would have developed that magnetic force which I wanted.\n\nOne summer, I applied and was invite"
