        "text": "Las Vegas headliners are being urged to take a moment and say a word -- or seven -- to honor comedy legend George Carlin.\n\n\"Let's all help to do something great -- for George's fans -- together,\" said Chris Ritter, a New York-based entertainment manager and comedy writer with local connections. Ritter hopes the entertainment community will pay tribute Saturday on their own stages.\n\nCarlin, a longtime Las Vegas headliner, died at age 71 on Sunday in Los Angeles.\n\nRitter initially proposed that Carlin's famous seven dirty words from his infamous routine \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\" be part of the tribute.\n\nInstead, \"even the squeakiest clean comics out there can opt to simply mention George or to do something extremely clever in a television friendly way,\" Ritter said in an e-mail to the media.\n\nThe idea, he said, is to put together \"a special reel of the various tributes as long as we have the permission of George Carlin's camp to do so. At that point, they can decide whether to put the reel up on YouTube.com or to do something else with it to best reach George's millions of fans.\"\n\nRitter has been reaching out to the reps of Las Vegas headliners, offering to take on the project. His telephone number is 646-285-7406.\n\n'LOVE' CHANGES\n\nAbout 30 percent of the cast of \"Love\" has been changed in recent weeks as the Beatles-Cirque du Soleil show nears its third anniversary.\n\nA Cirque du Soleil rep said most of the departees were dancers.\n\n\"Some wanted to explore other options,\" said Anita Nelving, who added that three are having babies and several youngsters had exceeded the height limit.\n\nShe said about 20 jobs were involved.\n\n\"They had been with the show for almost three years, counting a year of creation,\" Nelving said.\n\nThe show, which opened June 30, 2006, at The Mirage, has undergone subtle changes as well, including the blackbird act and the choreography for \"Come Together.\"\n\nHoldovers include Brazilian actor Silvia Aberne, 73, who portrays Eleanor Rigby; Craig Berman, who plays Her Majesty the Queen; gum boot dancer Michael Moloi, and Charlotte O'Dowd, a solo dancer in \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\"\n\nSIGHTINGS\n\nJessica Simpson, taping an interview at KCYE-FM 104.4 (Coyote Country) on Wednesday with Tom & Rick in the Morning. She was in town for an appearance on \"The View\" at Caesars Palace. \"She has a new country song, 'Come on Over,' and she made a visit to the station as part of coming into the country scene,\" said program director R.W. Smith. ... Simpson, dining at Trevi (Forum Shops at Caesars) on Wednesday. ... Barbara Walters took her fellow \"View\" co-hosts, Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, to Bette Midler's \"The Showgirl Must Go On\" at the Colosseum at Caesars. ... The Killers, performing on the VIP stage at Pure (Caesars) on Wednesday, with lead singer Brandon Flowers singing a cover of Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" ... British soccer star Wayne Rooney, who has been honeymooning in Las Vegas since last weekend, taking in a toga party at Blush Boutique Nightclub (Wynn) on Tuesday. The Manchester United star married Coleen McLoughlin on June 12 in Italy. They were seen dancing at George Michaels' concert at the MGM Grand over the weekend. ... Dancing on stage at The Time's tour-opening performance Tuesday at the Flamingo: singer Johnny Gill, Barry Bonds and Hollywood director Kevin Smith. In the audience: George Wallace, Nathan Burton, members of Mosaic, and the Alizma triplets. ... Pauly Shore, spotted at the Playboy Club with Devin Haman and Jeff Bozz of \"Sunset Tan\" along with Larry Rudolph, Britney Spears' manager. ... Flamingo headliner Burton, receiving the 2008 Merlin Award as the year's best comedy illusionist during his show Wednesday. ... Gerry McCambridge, receiving a diamond-studded Rolex from Hooters' Chief Operating Officer Gary Gregg on Friday to commemorate the mentalist's one-year anniversary at the property and a one-year contract extension.\n\nTHE PUNCH LINE\n\n\"Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone are going to be in a movie together. They're doing a movie called 'What the Hell Are They Saying?'\" -- Craig Ferguson\n\nNorm Clarke can be reached at (702) 383-0244 or norm@reviewjournal.com.
