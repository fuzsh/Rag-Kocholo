He attended Northern High School, where he graduated in 1957.\n\nAt Northern High School, Robinson formed the doo-wop group the Five Chimes, later known as the Miracles. The Miracles were one of the first groups to sign with Berry Gordy’s record label Tamla Records, later incorporated into Motown Records. Here, in 1960, Robinson and the Miracles recorded “Shop Around,” which became Motown’s first million-selling hit record and first number one hit on the R&B singles chart. As a songwriter, Robinson subsequently wrote hits for the group including “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me,” “Ooo Baby Baby,” “The Tracks of My Tears,” “Going to a Go-Go,” “More Love,” “Tears of a Clown,” co-written with Stevie Wonder, and “I Second That Emotion.” By the mid-1960’s, Robinson became vice president of Motown Records, serving as in-house producer, talent scout and songwriter. In this role, Robinson wrote and produced hits for other Motown greats including The Temptations, Mary Wells, Brenda Holloway, and Marvin Gaye, with the songs “The Way You Do the Things You Do,” “My Girl,” “Get Ready,” “You Beat Me to the Punch,” “Don’t Mess with Bill,” “Ain’t That Peculiar,” and “My Guy.” A year after retiring in 1972, Robinson began his solo career, recording hits including “Just to See Her,” “Quiet Storm,” “Cruisin’,” and “Being with You,” among others. He remained vice president of Motown Records until 1990; and, following his tenure at Motown, he continued his touring career and released several solo albums: Food for the Spirit (2004), Timeless Love (2006), Time Flies When You’re Having Fun (2009), Now And Then (2010), Smokey & Friends (2014), and Christmas Everyday (2017).\n\nSILKY NUTMEG GANACHE\n\nSilky Nutmeg Ganache is an American drag performer from Chicago, Illinois, who came to international attention in 2019 when she competed on the eleventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race finishing in third place, and later competed on the sixth season of\n\n​RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2021.\n\nCall Dante Rusciolelli 818-635-7910\n\nCEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER\n\nCedric the Entertainer, is an American actor, comedian, director, and game show host.

His humor stems from a childhood which caused him to escape reality at an early age through his imagination. He now uses his unique insight to entertain audiences with thoughts and ideas that make people think and laugh. His jokes range from the simple to the obscure, but always entertain and offend.He was raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio by a father born of Russian immigrants and a mother from the hills of Tennessee resulting in a cultural mix that was the catalyst to a lifetime of therapy. His therapist concluded that at the age of 7 after seeing his hillbilly mom invoke her 2nd ammendment rights by shooting his leftist father (he survived, but it put a permanent wrinkle in our dinner table conversations) may have caused him to withdraw from reality for a few years. It did, but when he returned he had a distinct outlook that few people have. His first observasion was to realize that the phrase “dysfunctional family” didn’t go nearly far enough to describe his upbringing. He just wants you to know he comes by his “dysfunction” honestly.\n\nJEFFREY PETERSON\n\nJeffrey is known as the 420 comic. He headlines all over the country.
