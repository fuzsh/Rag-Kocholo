        "text": "I always know it’s November when there’s not only a nip, but also creativity, in the air. The sheer number of cultural performances, gallery openings, and artistic collaborations happening community-wide attests to this. This season, perhaps more than ever, there is so much to take in. Maybe because of a pent-up desire to gather in concert halls and gallery spaces once again, or because recent transplants have caused our population to swell, the cultural calendar is brimming with possibilities. Turn to our Agenda section, beginning on page 172, to see the full scope of events for our entertainment and enrichment. This month alone, we present eight pages of happenings—and that’s just the beginning! One of the most notable performances this season will be the North American premiere of Alexei Ratmansky’s Swan Lake,…\n\n2021 EDUCATION AWARDS WHO: Palm Beach Illustrated WHAT: 2021 Education Awards WHERE: Hilton, West Palm Beach HIGHLIGHTS: Guests celebrated the winners for Educator of the Year, Institutional Excellence, and Outstanding Academic Program.

This month, the shiny new Town of Palm Beach Marina makes a splashy debut following its first major overhaul since it was built in the 1940s. Anchoring the southern side of the Royal Park Bridge on the western shoreline of Palm Beach, the renovated docks will reestablish their longtime presence along Australian, Brazilian, and Peruvian avenues while also introducing a new 250-foot Royal Palm Dock. Completion of the landmark project is set to alter the face of the town forever. Turn the page for a deep dive. “The vision was to upgrade the facility, because it hadn’t been touched in years,” says Mike Horn, who has presided as dockmaster since 2013. While the…\n\nFans of Marissa Collections, a Naples fashion institution since 1975, will no longer have to drive across the state to peruse the family-owned and-operated boutique’s curated selection of designer garb. Coming this month, a new outpost at The Royal Poinciana Plaza brings the store’s collection of fine jewelry, apparel, handbags, shoes, and accessories to Palm Beach shoppers. “If you have visited our Naples location, you know pink is our signature color, so there’s no better place than Palm Beach for our home away from home,” says Jay Hartington, CEO and son of founders Marissa and Burt Hartington. “Our family is bringing the best of our Naples boutique to Palm Beach, where we’ll focus on one-of-a-kind products and the client experience.” The Palm Beach location will center on fine jewelry—with many…\n\nMade famous by society photographer Slim Aarons in 1955, Villa Artemis has long been an icon of Palm Beach life. Artist Shannon Torrence will place it in the spotlight once again when he paints a composite take on the historic estate live at the Mtn Space Gallery in Lake Worth Beach this month. The interactive installation gives art fans a chance to observe Torrence as he creates Liquid Asset Management, which will serve as his flagship work for a 2022 show. Torrence doesn’t have to work solely from images—he has memory to rely on, too, thanks to a personal history with the villa. As a master finisher, Torrence has worked in Palm Beach homes—including some of the island’s most prominent—since 1988. “I worked in Villa Artemis in 2013, restoring two fireplaces,”…\n\nLeaving the Business Insider newsroom in New York’s Financial District, Reed Alexander answers his phone with cars honking and crosswalk signals ticking in the background. Then, someone approaches and asks, “Are you Nevel?” The 26-year-old journalist gets this question often, usually while dining on Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach, where he resides. The requests for photos have increased this summer since the hit Nickelodeon show iCarly, in which Alexander plays villain Nevel Papperman, launched a revival on Paramount+. Alexander grew up in Boca Raton and attended Pine Crest School, where the drama teacher encouraged him to pursue acting. At age 8, Alexander took it upon himself to call talent agents throughout South Florida, and when his mother got home from work, there were at least half a dozen messages on the answering…"
