        "text": "DATE June 23, 2008 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: George Carlin, from two separate interviews, after\n\nhis death at age 71\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nWe're going to remember the comedian and actor George Carlin, and listen back\n\nto a couple of his FRESH AIR interviews. Carlin died Sunday of heart failure.\n\nHe was 71. Last week he had been named the recipient of the Mark Twain Prize\n\nfor American Humor, which he was to receive at the Kennedy Center in November.\n\nCarlin was one of the more popular and influential comics that emerged from\n\nthe 1960s counterculture. His early humor was often about drugs. His long\n\nponytail became a trademark. He went on to skewer euphemistic language and\n\npolitical correctness. He made popular comedy albums and wrote best-selling\n\nhumor books. Carlin believed in free speech, including the open use of\n\nexpletives, and he was at the center of a famous Supreme Court case about his\n\nfamous comic monologue \"Seven Dirty Words You Can Never Say on Television. In\n\n1973 the Pacifica radio station in New York, WBAI, played this monologue.\n\nAfter a complaint was filed the FCC put WBAI on notice, threatening possible\n\nsanctions against the station if subsequent complaints were received. WBAI\n\nappealed the decision. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the FCC,\n\nestablishing the regulation of indecency on broadcasts. When I spoke with\n\nGeorge Carlin in 2004, we listened back to this 1972 recording of Carlin's\n\nmonologue. We, of course, bleeped the words that made this routine famous.\n\n(Soundbite of George Carlin monologue)\n\nMr. GEORGE CARLIN: There are 400,000 words in the English language, and\n\nthere are seven of them you can't say on television. What a ratio that is.\n\nThree hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three to\n\nseven. They must really be bad. They'd have to be outrageous to be separated\n\nfrom a group that large. All of you over here, you seven, bad words. That's\n\nwhat they told us they were, remember? `That's a bad word.'\n\nNo bad words. Bad thoughts, bad intentions and words. You know the seven,\n\ndon't you, that you can't say on television? (Censored by station)...huh?\n\n(Soundbite of applause)\n\nMr. CARLIN: Those are the heavy seven. Those are the ones that'll infect\n\nyour soul, curve your spine and keep the country from winning the war.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: George Carlin, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Thanks, Terry.\n\nGROSS: Can you talk about what led to this routine, like what you were\n\nthinking about, how you wrote it?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, I don't really know that there was a eureka moment or\n\nanything like that. What happened was, I'd always held these attitudes, I've\n\nalways been sort of anti-authoritarian and I really don't like arbitrary rules\n\nand regulations that are essentially designed to get people in the habit of\n\nconforming and obeying authority blindly. So I have always resisted that in\n\nmy life as a child, as an adolescent and as a young adult. And so I held that\n\nattitude. That's the fertile ground for all of this.\n\nSecondly, I have a strong interest in language that is, in part, genetic, in\n\npart fostered by my mother. And I have always taken great joy in looking more\n\nclosely at language. So those things were in place.\n\nOn these other things, we get into the field of hypocrisy, where you really\n\ncannot pin down what these rules they want to enforce are. It's just\n\nimpossible to say, `This is a blanket rule.' You'll see some newspapers print\n\n\"F--K.\" Some print \"F**K.\" Some put \"F---.\" Some put the word \"bleep.\" Some\n\nput \"expletive deleted.\" So there's no real consistent standard. It's not a\n\nscience. It's a notion that they have, and it's superstitious. These words\n\nhave no power. We give them this power by refusing to be free and easy with\n\nthem. We give them great power over us. They really, in themselves, have no\n\npower. It's the rest of the sentence that makes them either good or bad.\n\nGROSS: In your 1972 recording, you talk about how it's perfectly OK to say,\n\n`Don't prick your finger,' but you can't say, `Don't finger your blank.'\n\nMr. CARLIN: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you can't reverse the two.\n\nGROSS: You can't reverse the two words. So comics work with the power of\n\nwords.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: And, in a way, the fact certain words are supposed to be taboo, as you\n\npoint out, that gives them power.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yes. That's right.\n\nGROSS: And that makes those words more powerful for you when you want to use\n\nthem.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: So do you feel like you've been able to work with the taboo nature of\n\ncertain words and, you know, make that work in your favor?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, what...\n\nGROSS: Like in that classic routine?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yeah. That is an interestingly disguised way--and I don't mean\n\nyou were trying to deceive me or anything--but it's a disguised way of saying,\n\n`Well, don't some people just use these for shock value?' You get this phrase\n\nall the time from interviewers, shock value. Well, shock is a kind of a\n\nheightened form of surprise, and surprise is at the heart of comedy. So if\n\nyou're using the word in a way to heighten the impact of the sentence or\n\nseason the stew, they are, after all, great seasonings. There are sentences\n\nthat, without the use of hell or damn even, lose all their impact.\n\nSo they have a proper place in language. And in my case, I just like them\n\nbecause they are real and they do have impact. They do make a difference in a\n\nsentence. But if you're using them for their own sake, that's probably kind\n\nof weak. If you're using them in some way that you feel enhances what you're\n\ndoing and delivering, that's another thing.\n\nGROSS: Did you ever expect that that comedy routine would be actually played\n\non the radio, and it would be part of a case that made it all the way to the\n\nSupreme Court and that it would become as important and famous a case as it\n\nbecame?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, I knew that it wasn't out of the question that it may be\n\nplayed on the radio. FM radio stations at that time--and there were\n\ncommercial ones who qualified as what was called underground radio. And an\n\nawful lot of liberties were taken with music, too, music that had very--I\n\ndon't--God, I hate the words \"explicit\" and \"graphic,\" but those are the words\n\nthat would be used by someone to describe those kinds of songs, those lyrics.\n\nI knew there was a chance, but, of course, you know, no one ever sees other\n\nthings coming that are unexpected and larger, you know. I just knew that I\n\nhad done a piece that summed up my position very well and sort of had a\n\nnice--it had a wonderful rhythmic--the reading of those seven words, the way\n\nthey were placed together had a magnificent kind of a jazz feeling, a rhythm\n\nthat was just very natural and satisfying the way those syllables were placed\n\ntogether. And so I knew I had done something that was making an important\n\npoint about the hypocrisy of all of this.\n\nGROSS: Before we get back to our 2004 interview with George Carlin, let's\n\nlisten back to an excerpt from his 1990 FRESH AIR interview in which we also\n\ntalked about the court cases surrounding the broadcast of his \"Seven Dirty\n\nWords\" routine.\n\nDid the judges in the various trials get the point, do you think?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Absolutely not. I don't think they even listened. I'm sure\n\nthey didn't listen to the record to hear it in its fullest and best context.\n\nI'm sure they read portions of the transcript. It's in the interest, I guess,\n\nof the white male, religious corporate paramilitary state that we live in, to\n\ncontrol us. And the FCC, of course, has control only over broadcast media.\n\nAnd I guess they found a way to interpret that form of expression differently\n\nfrom the printed word and the spoken word.\n\nThe argument, which I think is specious, is that because this goes out into\n\nthe home, that somehow it's going to injure someone morally if it comes\n\nthrough the speaker. They don't take into account the fact that there is an\n\non/off switch on every radio and there is a station selector knob for changing\n\nthe station. The man who made the complaint, one of these moral commandos, a\n\nprofessional moralist who wants us to live his way, sat in his car with his\n\nson and listened to the entire broadcast. And I assume they were not morally\n\ndegraded in any way. I assume the child has developed in a normal way in\n\nspite of listening to that routine. So where is the argument? I don't follow\n\nthe damage. I don't see where the damage occurs in this language being used.\n\nGROSS: You know, Lenny Bruce always said that when he was up on obscenity\n\ncharges...\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...that he wished he could perform the material for the judges, you\n\nknow, because they were hearing, you know, either reading transcriptions or\n\nthey were hearing people quote the material.\n\nMr. CARLIN: A cop was doing his act poorly.\n\nGROSS: Right. That's it, yeah, yeah. And, you know, Bruce really felt,\n\n`Well, if they're going to get what it's about they have to hear me do it.'\n\nDid you feel that way yourself?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Sure. Well, I feel that the thing was rigged to start with, you\n\nknow.\n\nGROSS: Uh-huh.\n\nMr. CARLIN: I mean, I think the outcome was inevitable. But surely it would\n\nhave been fairer to the process to listen to the recording. And the other\n\nthing about it is, there was a warning given, there was a disclaimer given by\n\nthe radio station saying that `there'll be language on this next recording\n\nwhich you may find offensive.' There was the point made that it was in the\n\ncontext of speaking about protected speech. And certainly in that case that\n\nhas to be a redeeming artistic feature, which is one of the tests for\n\nobscenity. Of course they didn't test it for obscenity. They called it\n\nindecency and got around the obscenity law in that manner.\n\nGROSS: Now, you were arrested in Milwaukee in 1972.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yeah, now that was more for public, what you call it, disorderly\n\nconduct. The concert was outdoors and the speakers--the concert setting\n\noutdoors was in a larger setting of a fest, a festival, a summer fest.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. CARLIN: And so the complaint was made on the basis of the fact that the\n\nlanguage coming from these speakers flowed out of the concert area into the\n\narea of the general public, and the policemen felt that was wrong. I think\n\nhis idea was, he said, `There were mothers listening to this,' which I don't\n\nunderstand at all. But at any rate, we just waited. As the lawyer told me,\n\nhe said, `We're going to wait a few months on this case until a judge comes\n\naround who understands the First Amendment.' And apparently in Milwaukee that\n\ntook about six months.\n\nGROSS: Did you expect to be arrested?\n\nMr. CARLIN: No.\n\nGROSS: Did you have any idea this was coming?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Oh, absolutely not. No, and I think it was a spur of the moment\n\ndecision on the part of one policeman.\n\nGROSS: And how did they come get you?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Oh, they just came backstage. My wife came out onstage during\n\nthe show to warn me that they were back there. She came out, ostensibly, to\n\nbring me a glass of water. And it was a large, kind of unruly audience and\n\neverything, so an interruption like that wasn't particularly damaging to the\n\nflow of the show of anything. So she just got me aside and said, `There's\n\npolice backstage and they're going to arrest you.' So I went offstage a\n\ndifferent way where they weren't waiting. And at that time I was still a user\n\nof illegal substances. And so I got rid of what I had on me so that the only\n\narrest would be for this spoken violation and not for something else, which\n\nthey would have loved to catch me doing.\n\nGROSS: You went to Catholic school, right, as a boy?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yeah, I went to a rather progressive Catholic parochial school,\n\nwhich was very much different from the kind of horror stories we hear about\n\nCatholic schools, especially in that era. I went to a school where the nuns\n\nwere specially trained. They had special master's degrees from Catholic\n\nuniversity. We were taught religion, but we didn't have uniforms. We didn't\n\nhave the sexes in different classrooms. There was no corporal punishment. It\n\nwas very progressive. Certainly for the 1940s, it was progressive because\n\nwhat it amounted to was that the Catholic Church was actually experimenting\n\nwith humane treatment.\n\nAnd by the way, my third grade teacher, Sister Marie Richard, will be at my\n\nshow in Davenport, Iowa, this Sunday. I've been in touch with her over recent\n\nyears. She's now called Malita Conlon. She wears street clothes, but she's\n\nstill part of the Dominican Teaching Order. And she encourages me. She says,\n\n`I know that what you do is sort of in service of a larger objective.' And she\n\nhas given me--if I needed it, which maybe I did--a kind of imprimatur from my\n\nformer Catholic teachers that what I'm doing is OK.\n\nGROSS: So you're not going to worry about embarrassing her with your\n\nmaterial?\n\nMr. CARLIN: No, she's been at the shows before and I always warn her. And I\n\ntold her this time `Sister, it's a little rougher than it was two years ago.'\n\nShe says, `You're getting rougher?' And I said `yes.' But there are a few\n\nthings that, when I think they're like just too harsh I'll take them out when\n\nI do--she'll have a lot of priests and people with her, and I don't like\n\nmaking people uncomfortable. I don't think I have an obligation to force what\n\nI think is correct or OK into other people's lives. With Sister Conlon it's\n\nOK, but if she's going to have guests with her I'll probably try to protect\n\nthem, you know. I don't really want to injure someone.\n\nGROSS: George Carlin recorded in 1990. We'll hear more of his 2004 interview\n\nafter a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: We're remembering comic George Carlin. He died of heart failure\n\nyesterday at the age of 71. Let's get back to our 2004 interview with him.\n\nDo you remember how you were first exposed to four-letter words and what your\n\nreaction was when you first were?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, I was--I grew up in a part of New York City that's a very\n\ninteresting neighborhood. I lived--literally my front door was across the\n\nstreet--and I mean literally in its real sense here--literally across the\n\nstreet from Teachers College of Columbia University. And all around me to the\n\nsouth I had Columbia University Teachers College, Barnard College; Juilliard\n\nSchool of Music was around the corner, the original location. Riverside\n\nChurch, the 23-story interdenominational cathedral, the Gothic cathedral, was\n\nat the end of my street. Union Theological Seminary, the largest seminary in\n\nthe world of, again, interdenominational clergy. And around the corner the\n\nJewish Theological Seminary, the largest Jewish seminary in the world. St.\n\nJohn the Divine was nearby, and Grant's Tomb. So it was a highly\n\ninstitutional neighborhood full of learning and serious people.\n\nImmediately to the north down the hill we had the beginnings of Harlem. We\n\ncalled our section white Harlem because we thought it sounded tough, but there\n\nwere cross-pollination between these two groups. I lived very close by\n\nCubans, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, on the one hand, and blacks on the\n\nother. And when you're in those neighborhoods at the border--my part was a\n\nlittle Irish enclave, just a little wedge-shaped Irish enclave in the middle\n\nof all that, highly populated because we were quite fertile folks. Lot of\n\nkids, lot of kids on the street. And when you live near the border between\n\nall black and all white, you don't have the attitudes that the people who are\n\ninsulated and isolated in the center of those areas have. Those are people\n\nwho are not in contact day to day to day to day with the opposite.\n\nBut we did have contact all the time, and when you're on the border between\n\ntwo cultures, you sort of learn to live together. You have a common code of\n\nthe streets, in this case. And so I heard my language from the realistic\n\npeople in the neighborhood--my big brother, for one, but his friends and then\n\nall of the tiers and strata of the brothers and sisters under him. You know,\n\neverybody you knew had three or four brothers and sisters, and each of them\n\nwere the same age as your brothers and sisters. So it was kind of\n\ninteresting, but that's where I got a realistic feel and look at the world.\n\nGROSS: Did language get you into trouble as a kid?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, I--because I liked language--as I was saying, my\n\ngrandfather wrote out all of the works of Shakespeare in his adult life\n\nlonghand because of the joy it gave him--those were his words--`I do it for\n\nthe joy it gives me.' So that gene was active in our family, so I had that, as\n\nI described earlier. But I then started collecting exotic combinations of\n\ncurses that I heard in my neighborhood. I was probably 13 or 14 at the time.\n\nAnd there were guys who would put together a sentence in the heat of anger or\n\nin some ornate, descriptive passage in something they were describing, and\n\nthey would have an adjective or two, self-hyphenated; they would have made up\n\na form and tacked it onto some noun that it didn't really go with, and the\n\nrest of the sentence might have been some colorful verb that was, again, very\n\ninventive street language. And some of them were very colorful and exotic and\n\ndifferent. They weren't just flat-out curses.\n\nSo I heard these and I started writing them down. In another situation where\n\nI could tell you what they were, you'd understand a little better even what I\n\nmean. But I wrote them down and I had a little list of them--I had about 10\n\nor 12 of them. There are a few I can still remember. But I've had that in my\n\nwallet, and my mother was a snoop and discovered things I had stolen that way\n\nand confronted me with them. But in this case, and looking in my wallet, she\n\nfound this list. And I heard her--I came in one night and I opened the door\n\nvery slightly in the apartment on the second floor, and I heard her talking to\n\nmy Uncle John, and she was worried about me anyway because I was kind of a--I\n\nwas getting to be a loose cannon kind of an adolescent, defying, as you will\n\nand must then. And I heard her saying, `I think he may need a psychiatrist,\n\nJohn. I think we may have to get a child psychologist for him,' because she\n\nwas telling him these words and showing him this list. So yeah, they got me\n\nin trouble that way, but at least it was a creative effort.\n\nGROSS: Although your mother was appalled finding this list...\n\nMr. CARLIN: Mm-hmm, yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...of street words in your wallet, you earlier credited your mother\n\nwith having...\n\nMr. CARLIN: Oh, yes, she was...\n\nGROSS: ...a love of language and helping to instill it in you.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: How did her love of language express itself?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yeah. And, first of all, just to put it in perspective, the\n\nportion of my life when my mother and I were at odds is when you're supposed\n\nto differentiate yourself from the adult, the parent of the other sex, and I\n\nhad no father present in the home, so this was a battle between my mother and\n\nme for my identity sort of, to overdramatize it. But she was wonderful, and\n\nshe was my hero. She brought up two boys in the second world war in an\n\nadvertising job she had, and she stimulated that thing in me about\n\nlanguage--she would send me to the dictionary. I mean, that was pro forma in\n\na lot of families--I know that's what you do. But she would say, `Get the\n\ndictionary.'\n\nI asked her once what `peruse' meant. I said, `Ma, what's peruse?' She said,\n\n`Well, get the dictionary in here. Let's get the dictionary.' So I'd look it\n\nup and she'd have me use it in a sentence of my own, and we'd talk about the\n\nroot or the origin of it, and which definition was more useful and current and\n\nso forth. And so the next day when I gave her her newspaper--in the evening,\n\nit wasn't a nightly custom, but sometimes I went and bought her a newspaper\n\nwhen she'd come home from work--I brought it in her bedroom and gave her the\n\nnewspaper and I said, `Here, Ma,' I said, `Would you like to peruse this?' And\n\nshe said, `Well, maybe I'll give it a cursory glance.' And it was right back\n\nto the dictionary.\n\nAnd another thing she would do with that newspaper--she'd be reading a\n\ncolumnist, someone who wrote well, and she would call me into the room and\n\nsay, `Look at this. Listen to these words. Look how that word cuts--it just\n\ncuts through that sentence,' and she would make--she would do all these sort\n\nof dramatic--they had an effect on her and she was able to transmit that to me\n\nthrough her use--she was a person who employed a lot of melodramatic things in\n\nher life. She said, `I should have been on the stage, George. Someday you\n\nmust tell my story.' You know?\n\nGROSS: George Carlin recorded in 2004. We'll hear more of the interview in\n\nthe second half of the show. Carlin died of heart failure yesterday at the\n\nage of 71. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're listening back to our 2004\n\ninterview with comedian George Carlin. He died of heart failure yesterday at\n\nthe age of 71. Last week he'd been named the recipient of this year's Mark\n\nTwain Prize for American Humor, which he was to receive in November at the\n\nKennedy Center. He was famous, among other things, for his monologue \"Seven\n\nDirty Words You Can Never Say on Television\" and for his skewering of\n\neuphemisms and politically correct language.\n\nWhen we left off, he'd described how his mother got him interested in language\n\nand using the dictionary. Learning a little Latin helped, too.\n\nMr. CARLIN: I quit high school in ninth grade, but first year high school\n\nfor me had Latin I. And Latin I is when you learn all the vocabulary and when\n\nyou learn the declensions of the nouns and the conjugations of the verbs. So\n\nit was elemental. And I learned a lot about root formations and the language\n\nthat grew out of the Latin--the romance languages.\n\nGROSS: Why did you drop out of high school in ninth grade?\n\nMr. CARLIN: I could see that I--they weren't offering anything I really\n\nneeded. I wasn't interested in merely having a credential. And I knew I had\n\nthe skills I needed, and all I needed to do was to work hard on the English\n\nlanguage, and these skills I had, sharpen them. I had a very strong command\n\nof the language as I was at that time, and I knew that would develop further.\n\nAnd I knew that I didn't really need all of that stuff that they offered, that\n\nthey teach you, to do what I wanted to do. I was very inner-directed and very\n\nself-sufficient. I had an autonomy in my heart that kept me moving in my own\n\npath.\n\nGROSS: Did you know in ninth grade, when you dropped out, that you wanted to\n\nbe a comic?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Oh, yeah, I knew that in fifth grade. I wrote a little\n\nautobiography then. I said, `I want to be a comedian or an impersonator or an\n\nannouncer or an actor.' And I had a plan. The plan was radio first because\n\nthere's no audience there present. You get away with more. The nerves are\n\ndifferent. Second step would be standup comedy, and once I was good enough at\n\nthat, they'd have to let me in the movies, like Danny Kaye. That was my\n\nchildhood thought. I thought it was a birthright, and I thought that I had a\n\npath figured out. And the path worked that way. I just realized later I was\n\na better comedian than I thought, and I could abandon the actor part.\n\nGROSS: Now, I know you made it onto radio before you became...\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yes.\n\nGROSS: ...famous as a comic. What was your radio persona?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, I was on a--the first job I had was in a\n\nplace--Shreveport, Louisiana, which sounds like kind of an easily ignored\n\nplace, but it had nine stations. It was a hot radio market, as they said, and\n\nwe were number one. I had a 52 share. Imagine that, a 52 share in a\n\nnine-station market in my afternoon show. So it was top 40, but it wasn't as\n\nrigid as top 40 became. It wasn't as--it didn't sound, you know, like a\n\nrobot: time, temperature and the label and the name of the artist. You could\n\nbe a little bit of a personality, too. So we played top 40, and I was a\n\nvery--I was only 18. It was great to be playing the very music that I was\n\ndancing to at night. It was nice to go over to a girl in a situation like at\n\na bar or something and say, `Would you like me to play a song on the radio for\n\nyou tomorrow and dedicate it to you?' It was a little underhanded, but it sure\n\nworked a lot.\n\nGROSS: Works like a charm.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And would you talk your way through the instrumental up to the vocal\n\nof the record?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Some of the time, sure. Yeah, use you know, the first eight\n\nbars or 16 bars or whatever the instrumental intro was, you bring it up first\n\nfor about three or four seconds, then you bring it down. You say, `OK, the\n\nnew Connie Francis just came in.' And I'm exaggerating my disc jockey voice.\n\n`And here at 15 minutes past 5 on \"The George Carlin Show\" on KJEL, we're\n\ngoing to listen to this brand-new one,' and then, whoom, up with the vocals,\n\nyou know? I loved running a tight board. We ran our own boards, and I loved\n\nit. I was so proud of tight cues and segues that were tight, you know. It\n\nwas just a point of pride.\n\nGROSS: Now, you've always opposed authority. I mean, you dropped out of\n\nschool in ninth grade.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Hm. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: You joined the military. You were court-martialed twice in the\n\nmilitary.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Hm. Yeah, three times.\n\nGROSS: Three times? OK.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Why would somebody who opposes authority so much volunteer to go into\n\nthe military, which has such a hierarchical structure?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Hm. Yes. Well, at that time in our history, there was a draft.\n\nAnd the way you avoided the draft was to join. It's an odd thing. It sounds\n\nlike a paradox, but it's true. The way you stayed out of the military was to\n\nchoose when to go in, not to let them decide. See, I wanted the choice to be\n\nmine. I didn't want to wait to--in New York, the draft pool was very large,\n\nand therefore you wouldn't be drafted till your early 20s, which would have\n\ninterfered with my life plan. I had a little plan when I was 11 years old,\n\nand I was working through it in my teenage years. And I said, well, I'm not\n\ngoing to get to do this if they're go to draft me with all these other guys\n\nare 20, 21. I joined at 17 to get what they called then--get the military\n\nobligation out of the way.\n\nGROSS: And when you got in there, how'd you do inside? You mentioned you\n\nwere court-martialed three times. How did you respond to the authority within\n\nthe military?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Poorly to the authority. I was very good at the thing they\n\ntrained me for, which was electronics and analog computers. There was a\n\nsystem called the K system bomb system on the B-47, and I was trained in a\n\nvery elite squadron, I'm proud to say. It's one of the few conceits I have\n\nabout myself, but it is a genuine one. I qualified for a highly elite school\n\nand passed with the highest T score they'd ever had, and therefore--but I\n\nloved it because of the theory involved. It was all blackboard. It was none\n\nof this screwdriver stuff.\n\nSo when I got to my base to practice this art, science, that they taught\n\nme--spent a lot of money on me--right away they tell you, `Pick this up, put\n\nit over there. Put those there. And just take the'--I didn't care for that,\n\nand so I became a disc jockey in a downtown commercial station instead when I\n\nwas 18. And I had already begun my career while I was getting my military out\n\nof the way. But I was a behavior problem there, just as I was in school,\n\nbecause I didn't accept arbitrary orders from people who I thought were\n\npossibly inferior.\n\nGROSS: Now there's a lot in the universe that you find pretty absurd, and\n\nyou...\n\nMr. CARLIN: Hm. And wonderful.\n\nGROSS: And wonderful. But when it comes to the absurdity or the ridiculous\n\naspects of life...\n\nMr. CARLIN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...you're not going to be looking to religion to help you provide\n\nmeaning or a sense of...\n\nMr. CARLIN: No.\n\nGROSS: ...your place in the world. Is there anything that you do turn to to\n\nhelp provide, you know, meaning or a sense of like, you know, where do you fit\n\nin, or what are you doing here?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, sure. Some time ago I figured out, with\n\nthe help probably of some reading that I can't recall now, that if it's true\n\nthat we're all from the center of a star, every atom in each of us from the\n\ncenter of a star, the we're all the same thing. And even a Coke machine or a\n\ncigarette butt in the street in Buffalo is made out of atoms that came from a\n\nstar. They've all been recycled thousands of times, as have you and I. So if\n\nthat is true, then I am everywhere in the universe in an extended sense, and\n\ntherefore it's only me out there. So what is there to be afraid of? What is\n\nthere that needs solace-seeking? Nothing. There's nothing to be afraid of\n\nbecause it's all us.\n\nSo I just have that as a backdrop, and I don't have to go to it or think of it\n\nconsciously. I've kind of accepted this idea that I'm perfectly safe and that\n\nlife and nature have waves and troughs; there are ups and downs, left and\n\nright, black and white, night and day, fall and winter, positive and negative.\n\nEverything has an opposite. If it's a bad time, I'll have a good time coming.\n\nIf it's a good time, I'm prepared to have a bad time to sort of pay for it.\n\nSo nothing--it doesn't really--they don't really upset me a lot, these, you\n\nknow, things that happen in our lives.\n\nGROSS: You know, it's great the way you described it as how, like, the whole\n\nworld is really you; like, we're all of the same molecules and everything.\n\nMr. CARLIN: The whole universe, yeah.\n\nGROSS: The whole universe is you. It's this great mix of, like, narcissism\n\nand mysticism rolled into one, the way you put it.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Sure. And that's kind of--yeah. And that's essentially what we\n\nall are. The trouble is we have been separated from that universe by being\n\nborn and given a name and an identity and being individuated. We've been\n\nseparated from the oneness, and that's what religion exploits, that people\n\nhave this yearning to be part of the overall one again. So they exploit that.\n\nThey call it God. They say He has rules. And I think it's cruel. I think\n\nyou can do it absent religion.\n\nGROSS: Now, you've had your time spent with drugs and alcohol.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Mm-hmm. Yes.\n\nGROSS: And, you know, a lot of people in entertainment burn out or end up\n\nkilling themselves, you know, intentionally or inadvertently...\n\nMr. CARLIN: Hm. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...through that burnout with the help of drugs and alcohol. You've\n\nalso had three heart attacks.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yes.\n\nGROSS: So I'm wondering, are you ever nervous about death or illness or the\n\nprospect of being, you know, physically diminished at some point?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Is this the kind of thing, like, you have anxiety about, or do you\n\njust kind of like, `whatever'?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, I don't like the idea of not being here anymore because I\n\ndo have such a joy in living my life. I love my writing. I love to sit alone\n\nand write. I love Sally, and we have a wonderful love together. And I don't\n\nwant to leave those things, so that will be a hard thing to face if I have a\n\nmoment or two or a month or a year to face it. But I don't necessarily have\n\nanxiety about those things.\n\nI would hate to lose my power of speech because it is sort of my identity for\n\nme, forgetting the world for the moment. I feel whole when I'm able to speak\n\nmy thoughts. That would bother me. But if I were still able to somehow type,\n\nI could find some joy, and some--you know, it would be OK. If I couldn't,\n\nthen there's these people who are completely paralyzed, but they can operate a\n\nkeyboard by moving their eyes. I don't know if you've ever seen that.\n\nThey're probably not very common machines.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\n\nMr. CARLIN: But you can do that. So I thought, `Well, even if I'm\n\nparalyzed, I can sort of, like, write a few paragraphs each day,' you know?\n\nSo these are, you know, odd, extreme thoughts, but those are the thoughts I\n\nthink of when I contemplate these fates.\n\nGROSS: We're listening back to a 2004 interview with George Carlin. He died\n\nyesterday of heart failure. We'll hear the final part of the interview after\n\na break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: We're remembering comic George Carlin. He died of heart failure\n\nyesterday at the age of 71. This is an excerpt of his 1972 album \"AM and FM.\"\n\nHe's talking here about daytime TV.\n\n(Soundbite of \"AM and FM\")\n\nMr. CARLIN: And then there's \"Let's Make a Deal,\" the seat of greed in\n\nAmerica. You've seen the people on \"Let's Make a Deal.\" You should see the\n\nones they don't let on the show.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. CARLIN: `Take them away.' You know, but you've got to be a little bit\n\ndingy, I think, to be 43 years old and standing up there dressed like a\n\nradish, you know.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. CARLIN: And the ladies, God love them, they show that greed when Monty\n\nshows the money. `Hi, I'm Monty Hall and I have $500.'\n\n(Soundbite of whoosh)\n\nMr. CARLIN: `Not anymore, Monty.' `OK, you have the $500, what would you\n\nlike to do? Keep the $500 or do you want to buy what Jay has in his box he's\n\nbringing down the aisle? Jay, you want to bring that box on down? Jay, look\n\nout for the cord. Jay, look out. Jay!\n\n(Soundbite of tumbling noise)\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, now we know what Jay had in the box. It was a cheese\n\nstraightener. Deluxe model, too. OK, what do you want to do? Do you want to\n\nkeep the cheese straightener or do you want the $500, or do you want door\n\nnumber one, door number two, or door number three?' `Oh, Christ! Oh, Monty,\n\nMonty, what were the doors again?'\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: George Carlin recorded in 1972. Let's get back to our 2004 interview\n\nwith him.\n\nWho were the first comics that you heard where you thought, `They nailed it.\n\nThis is what life is about'? Like, they just described life.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Yeah. Well, you know, I don't know--I know that the gist of\n\nyour question, I can answer. Of course, comedy changed in the 1950s when the\n\nindividuals emerged, and nobody was all the same anymore. It used to be very\n\nsame, very safe and very same. And then Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, Nichols & May\n\nand a lot of other people in the improv groups and some underground press and\n\nso forth took hold of comedy and changed it. And so it was that crop in the\n\n'50s--I was then approaching my 20th birthday. And Lenny Bruce was, of\n\ncourse, the one who inspired me the most because I saw for the very first time\n\nutter and complete honesty on a stage. And it was a brilliant form of it. It\n\nwasn't just honesty, it was great satire. Even in his days of--just his\n\nparodies were great.\n\nBut then he started talking about religion and things, and I thought, `Boy,\n\nthat's wonderful to know that you can do that; that it can be done.' I didn't\n\nsay, `Well, I'm going to do that, too.' But I sort of said, `OK, now I know\n\nthat.' And it really did help me later to decide to be myself.\n\nGROSS: How much do you think your comedy has changed from when you first\n\nstarted doing standup?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, of course, the times helped--you know, the change is\n\nillustrated by the times. I began in 1960. I went through about eight or\n\nnine years of what essentially were the extended 1950s, sort of a button-down\n\nperiod. But that was when the country was changing. I was 30 in 1957. The\n\npeople I was entertaining were in their 40s, and they were the parents of the\n\npeople who were 20, 18, in college, beginning to change the nature of our\n\nsociety to a great extent. So I sided more with them because I was\n\nanti-authority, and I just let myself revert to my deferred adolescence and be\n\none of them in terms of my work rather than these people I really disliked,\n\nwho I was entertaining, these 40-year-old plus people.\n\nSo that's how my comedy has changed. The times were safer, and I was a safer,\n\nmainstream comic in the '60s. And then I became this other person, who was a\n\nlittle more honest and open with language and his thoughts, you know.\n\nGROSS: Were you performing to older audiences because those were the people\n\nwho could buy the tickets in the places that you were performing?\n\nMr. CARLIN: Well, no, not strictly speaking. What happened was this--and I\n\ncan do this briefly for you. I had always been this law breaker, outlaw-type\n\nkid and adolescent--and Air Force guy, as you pointed out--never stuck by the\n\nrules, always swimming against the tide. But I had a mainstream dream, and my\n\ndream was to be like Danny Kaye in the movies or to be like Bob Hope in the\n\nmovies. So I never put those two things together. I never saw that they\n\ndidn't go together. And I followed this other dream in the way that you did\n\nbecause the only way you could do it was to please people with mainstream,\n\nsafe comedy kits, what the period demanded and got. So I did that until the\n\ntwo became--it became an untenable situation. I could no longer be myself\n\ninside and serve these other things. And when I saw the mistake, I went about\n\ncorrecting it in a slow and orderly manner. It took about two or three years\n\nfor my changes, as it were, to take place.\n\nGROSS: Well, George Carlin, I'd like to ask you to end our interview by\n\nreading the final piece in your new book.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Oh, sure. OK.\n\nGROSS: And the book is called \"When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?\" And\n\nthis piece is called \"The Secret News.\" And you're welcome to say anything\n\nabout writing it before you read it or to just read it, whatever you prefer.\n\nMr. CARLIN: I have a big file called News, and it has a lot of odd news\n\nformats. And one of them was this one called \"The Secret News.\" And this was\n\nactually written and designed to be on an album, maybe, a studio-type album,\n\nwhere you could use sound effects and you were simulating actual broadcasting.\n\nBut it works this way, too, with the sound effects indicated verbally. I'll\n\ndo that for you. It's called \"The Secret News,\" and we hear a news ticker\n\nsound effect.\n\n(Soundbite of Carlin making news ticker effect)\n\nMr. CARLIN: And the announcer whispering, saying, `Good evening, ladies and\n\ngentlemen. It's time for \"The Secret News.\" And the news ticker gets louder,\n\nand he goes, `Sh.' And the ticker lowers. \"Here's the secret news. All\n\npeople are afraid. No one knows what they're doing. Everything is getting\n\nworse. Some people deserve to die. Your money is worthless. No one is\n\nproperly dressed. At least one of your children will disappoint you. The\n\nsystem is rigged. Your house will never be completely clean. All teachers\n\nare incompetent. There are people who really dislike you. Nothing is as good\n\nas it seems. Things don't last. No one is paying attention. The country is\n\ndying. God doesn't care. Sh.\"\n\nGROSS: George Carlin, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nMr. CARLIN: Sure. Thank you. I always appreciate--I'm not flattering\n\nhere--an intelligent interview, and thank you for that.\n\nGROSS: George Carlin, recorded in 2004.

Rock critic Ken\n\nTucker calls the result a pleasure. But does it stand up to classic Al Green\n\nrecords? Here's Ken's review.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Lay It Down\")\n\nMr. AL GREEN: (Singing) Lay it down\n\nLay it down\n\nLay it down\n\nPut your head on the floor\n\nLay it down\n\nLay it down\n\nLay it down\n\nI just met you...\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. KEN TUCKER: At age 62 Al Green has earned the right not only to have\n\nacolytes, but to allow them to give him his proper due, which is to try and\n\nhelp him build a hit record. To that end he agreed to have Ahmir Thompson,\n\naka Questlove, the drummer for the hip-hop group The Roots, assemble a group\n\nof performers influenced by Al Green's prime 1970s hit singles. They did him\n\nproud, recording in New York but capturing much of the mucky funk of the high\n\nrecord studios in Memphis where Green recorded his greatest music with the\n\nproducer Willie Mitchell.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMr. GREEN: (Singing) As I sit and watch my baby\n\nHow you do the things you do\n\nYea, I know deep down in your heart\n\nI never see all you do\n\nI smile and I'm glad\n\nYou're the best thing that I ever had\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. TUCKER: So with all this pretty music and these deep grooves, what keeps\n\n\"Lay It Down\" from being a great Al Green album? It's some mystical\n\ncombination of spirituality--that is, a lack of it--and the lyrics--that is,\n\nthe banality of them. Now, you might say that the man who made a hit by\n\nchanting \"love and happiness\" over and over doesn't have much need for tricky\n\nwordplay. And you're right, he doesn't. What he does need are sufficient\n\nphrases and refrains into which he can pour his smoldering passion.\n\nThat's why one of the best tracks here is the tight, precise construct called\n\n\"I'm Wild About You,\" with its slamming beats and airy room for Al to\n\nimprovise grunts and moans over the other nonverbal element, the \"woot woot\"s\n\nof the backup singers.\n\n(Soundbite of \"I'm Wild About You\")\n\nBackup Singers: (Singing) Woot, woot\n\nMr. GREEN: (Singing) No doubt, hey, hey\n\nI'm wild about you, baby\n\nHey! I'm wild\n\nI'm wild about you, baby\n\nThere ain't no doubt\n\nOh, Lord\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. TUCKER: One theme the new album mostly avoids is the explicit\n\nChristianity to which Green, the very active pastor of the Full Gospel\n\nTabernacle in Memphis, has devoted much of his last 20 years of music making.\n\nThe common wisdom is that once Green denied the secular in his music it lost\n\nmuch of his tension. But in steering him away from God talk, his admirers\n\nhave too often replaced it with mere nostalgia, summoning up memories of\n\nprevious Green hits rather than moving him forward with new ones.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Stay with Me (By the Sea)\")\n\nMr. GREEN: (Singing) Stay with me, my dear\n\nWalk with me and hold me near\n\nIt's not as late as it seems\n\nNo, no\n\nSo why'd you take your love away from me?\n\nBackup Singers: (Singing) La la la\n\nLa la la\n\nMr. GREEN: (Singing) La la la\n\nBackup Singers: (Singing) La la la\n\nStay with me\n\nMr. GREEN: (Singing) La stay\n\nBackup Singers: (Singing) La la la\n\nLa la la\n\nMr. GREEN: (Singing) Oh\n\nBackup Singers: (Singing) La la la\n\nStay with me\n\nMr. JOHN LEGEND: (Singing) In the morning light\n\nAre shades of white\n\nYou're the only one that's right\n\nSo what's the meaning of saying goodbye\n\nBackup Singers: (Singing) La la la\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. TUCKER: This album's duets with the singers Corinne Bailey Rae and John\n\nLegend--I just played the latter--are the collection's least interesting\n\ntunes. On the other hand, a song written and recorded with yet another\n\nneo-soul singer, Anthony Hamilton, has the right idea. \"You've Got The Love I\n\nNeed\" has a lightness that compels Green to reach for the high notes his\n\nfraying upper register can still attain with an effort which signals his\n\nenduring energy. The lyric, meanwhile, is ambiguous enough to suggest that\n\nGreen and Hamilton may be making an entreaty to Jesus as much as to a woman to\n\nbe seduced.\n\n(Soundbite of \"You've Got The Love I Need\")\n\nMr. GREEN and Mr. ANTHONY HAMILTON: (Singing)\n\nYou've got the love I need, babe\n\nYou've got the love I need, babe\n\nYeah\n\nYou've got the love I need, babe\n\nYou've got the love I need, babe\n\nMr. HAMILTON: (Singing) Oh, my only friend\n\nThe only truth I've know\n\nOh, you taught me things about me\n\nI never thought I'd know\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nTUCKER: If in the end \"Lay It Down\" is an Al Green album for Starbuck stores\n\nthat already show a waning desire to push vintage soul acts, it's enough of a\n\nshowcase for Green's senior citizen vigor to make you realize anew that it\n\ndoesn't matter how old he is or how young his admirers are, it's the vitality\n\nand resiliency of the music that matters."
