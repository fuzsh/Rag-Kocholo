        "text": "Photo Credit: Naomi Gingold\n\nBy Naomi Gingold\n\nWhen Kyaw Moe Khine was in 9th grade, he told his parents that he was an atheist. His parents didn’t quite get it, he says.\n\nThey didn’t even know what atheism meant.\n\nKyaw Moe Khine, who goes by the name “Bart,” is from Myanmar, frequently referred to as Burma, and it’s a pretty religious place. Most Burmese are Theravada Buddhists, but there are also plenty of religious minorities that have been there for centuries, from Catholics to Muslims of diverse origins all over the country.\n\nBart says now that he’s 19, his mom knows about atheism, but she still hasn’t come to terms with his new “faith.”\n\nOccasionally she still says things to him like, “You’re going to burn in hell! Allah’s going to punish you!”\n\nHe laughs: “Yeah. She says stuff like that.”\n\nBart was raised Muslim, but even as a kid he questioned everything: in Islam and the Quran, and in the Buddhism around him. He even read the Bible to see what it had to offer.\n\nBut he says in all of these faiths, people seemed as if they were just robotically following rules, mostly out of fear; and the rules didn’t make sense in the modern world.\n\nHe did find some kindred spirits, though.\n\n“When you read people like [Friedrich] Nietzsche or when you listen to people like George Carlin, they’re really making a point. And those books are not!”\n\nYes, the George Carlin, who regularly ranted about religion as “utter bulls—.”\n\nBart wholeheartedly agrees with that.\n\nThe first time Bart deliberately broke a religious rule he described the feeling as “emancipating.”\n\nSo he kept going.\n\nAs you might have guessed, Bart takes his name from the cartoon character, Bart Simpson. And like his namesake, the Burmese Bart has always had a rebellious streak.\n\nIt started when he was young. He liked to draw — a lot. (He’s now an artist.) And he was always getting in trouble at school for drawing in books, in class. Teachers would confiscate his drawing pads; sometimes he would steal them back. It was a constant battle, he says.\n\n“That’s where the rebellious nature came from, I guess. The more they me busted me, the more I would react. It became bigger and bigger; from school to religion,” Bart says.\n\nThere was something else pivotal in Bart’s experience growing up in Yangon, Burma’s main city.\n\n“In school they would treat Muslim kids differently,” he says. “The teachers and even the kids, they would bully kids. I got bullied for being Muslim.”\n\nWhile there’s long been anti-Muslim discrimination in the Myanmar, recently, it’s climbed to almost a fever pitch with the growing strength of the Ma Ba Tha, a group of extremist Buddhist monks who’ve been preaching anti-Muslim rhetoric. There are even new laws prohibiting interfaith marriages, laws primarily enacted to target Muslims. And the Muslim Rohingya population in the West have faced severe persecution.\n\nBart, himself, has plenty of Buddhist and Christian friends and has for years. But it all made him wonder, “Why am I Muslim and most people are Buddhists? That’s the question. Why am I different — in a way that’s not… good?”"
