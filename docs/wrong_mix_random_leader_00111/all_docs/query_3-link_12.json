        "text": "Kelly Carlin, daughter of the late GRAMMY-winning comedian George Carlin, began her showbiz career working in TV production for her mother and father on various shows for HBO. While at UCLA, Carlin discovered her voice as a writer, which led her to a brief career in writing for film and TV with her writing partner and husband, Robert McCall. The couple subsequently penned the Rose McGowan thriller Devil in the Flesh, and an episode of Fox’s The George Carlin Show. Carlin keeps busy with numerous projects, including serving as host of a monthly SiriusXM Radio show called The Kelly Carlin Show, which spotlights her conversations with iconic comedians, and a live weekly podcast, “Waking from the American Dream,” at smodcast.com. The podcast features conversations about the comedy and tragedy of life with comedians, authors, visionaries and artists. Currently, Carlin is touring the country with her one woman show, A Carlin Home Companion, which recently wrapped two sold-out performances at Garry Marshall’s Falcon Theatre in Burbank, California. On Sept. 15, St. Martin’s Press will publish Kelly Carlin’s memoir, A Carlin Home Companion: Growing Up With George. In conjunction with its latest exhibit, George Carlin: A Place For My Stuff (opening Sept. 30), the GRAMMY Museum welcomes Kelly Carlin to the Clive Davis Theater for an intimate discussion about her new book, and life with her father, moderated by Bob Santelli, Executive Director of the GRAMMY Museum. The conversation will be followed by a reading with special guest actor/comedian Kevin Pollak."
