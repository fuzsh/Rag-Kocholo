Regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comics of all time, he was dubbed \"the dean of counterculture comedians\".[1] He was known for his dark comedy and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and taboo subjects. His \"seven dirty words\" routine was central to the 1978 United States Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to censor indecent material on the public airwaves.\n\n1966 - Take-Offs and Put-Ons\n\n1972 - Class Clown\n\n1972 - FM & AM\n\n1973 - Occupation Foole\n\n1974 - Toledo Window Box\n\n1975 - An Evening with Wally Londo Featuring Bill Slaszo\n\n1977 - On the Road\n\n1981 - A Place for My Stuff\n\n1984 - Carlin on Campus\n\n1986 - Playin' with Your Head\n\n1988 - What Am I Doing In New Jersey\n\n1990 - Parental Advisory - Explicit Lyrics\n\n1992 - Jammin' in New York\n\n1996 - Back in Town\n\n1997 - Brain Droppings\n\n1999 - You Are All Diseased\n\n2001 - Complaints and Grievances\n\n2001 - Napalm and Silly Putty\n\n2002 - George Carlin on Comedy\n\n2004 - When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops"
