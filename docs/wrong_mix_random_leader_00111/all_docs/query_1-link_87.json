        "text": "FICTION AND NONFICTION\n\nWhen I first thought of writing this manual, the title that occurred to me was “Some Decent Sentences.” I liked that idea because it made a little fun of some of my colleagues in the English Department where I was teaching who complained about their student’s ignorance. The most offensive remarks sounded like this: “Why do we have to waste our time trying to teach these morons who can’t even write a decent sentence?” The cynicism and stupidity of such a remark tempted me once to respond, “Why don’t you quit and write pornographic novels?”\n\nThe word “decent” is a trap. A decent sentence to my colleagues meant a sentence with no misspelled words, grammatical errors or faulty punctuation. I thought my title would be ironic enough to jar the sensibilities of some of my colleagues. But it was an inside joke, and I found something better. A “good sentence” is something any reader knows is clear, has the force of an impelling thought, and may even be memorable.\n\nThis manual has several dozen sentences chosen as examples. They are better than correct; they are exemplary, or well crafted, or artistic, or beautiful. Their creators have pondered the wealth of possibilities the language offers and have written good sentences.\n\nPhilip Roth is a productive American novelist. His novels have entered the shelves of the Library of American Literature together with the works of Henry James, Mark Twain, Faulkner, and Melville, and have enriched our literary experience with thousands of exemplary sentences. He is a classic American novelist. Here is one of his sentences. I call it the sexual sentence.\n\nWe had imagined it beforehand in all its possibilities, dreamed it all out loud for many, many months now, and yet I am dumbstruck at the sight of The Monkey’s middle finger disappearing up into Lina’s cunt. (Portnoy’s Complaint by Philip Roth, Library of American Literature)\n\nTo understand the image that this sentence points to as it proceeds, the reader must know that The Monkey is Portnoy’s mistress, a sophisticated model from the lower classes and Lina is a whore, whom “we” have invited to take part in a ménage a trois in a Roman hotel room. The Monkey had extended the invitation. In the previous sentence Roth sets the image up: The Monkey “puts her hand between the whore’s legs.” The word “it” teases us into the sentence twice, first in an abstract predication and then as a sensual (poetic?) process “dreamed it all out loud”. The image is projected in a complete first-person singular predication by the narrator Portnoy. Each word expresses the horny features of Portnoy’s image: “dumbstruck” (no words are adequate), the “sight” (visionary), The Monkey’s middle finger (all the implications of “up yours”), “disappearing” (to what end?) “up into” (Portnoy’s technical expertise) “cunt” in the orgasmic final position of the full cadence of the last phrase in a well-crafted sentence. (In typing the sentence just now, I learned that the Old English word “cunt” is flagged with red dots by my word processor’s spell-check, the only word of George Carlin’s list of seven prohibited words so handled. I’m sure I spelled it right.) I hope I’ve convinced you that Roth’s sentence is well-crafted, maybe even beautiful.\n\nI’ve chosen only a very few sentences from fiction for this book. Sentences in fiction are too hard. I get that word from my daughter Linnea, who said it when my friend John Freund asked how she liked the movie “The Ox-Bow Incident,” which she had just seen in her seventh-grade English class. “It was hard,” she said.\n\nI’m ninety-one years old; I don’t have time to do the job right; I’d have to have gone into Portnoy’s whole personality, his Jewish heritage (different from that of the goyim, the gentiles, like The Monkey), his parent’s influence on him (his father’s debilitating constipation, the prunes and the suppositories, and his mother’s always referring to his manly schlong in baby talk as the “little thing”), his job as a lawyer appointed by Mayor Lindsay as Assistant Commissioner for the City of New York Commission on Human Opportunity. In a complete analysis of Roth’s sentence I would certainly have to have observed that the entire book is supposedly Portnoy’s monologue as he speaks from the couch of his psychiatrist, Herr Doktor Spielvogel.\n\nThe big difference between fiction and nonfiction is that fiction distinguishes between a narrator and the author, between Portnoy and Roth. When Roth writes an essay, the reader holds him personally responsible for every thought expressed; it comes from his mind, his whole personality, his self, his identity. When Roth writes a novel he invents a narrator. If the narrator writes, I did this to her and she did that to me, the author has created a personality within the novel’s action. The narrator is an extremely complex actor in the novel, a rich personality. But even if the novelist writes in the third person, he has invented a narrator, one the reader can’t see. The author has invented the narrator’s voice, his style, his moral stand, even his politics. But he is inactive in the novel. The novelist can (and often does) say, This is not me, it’s fiction. We’re getting to a sticky point. Isn’t the novelist responsible for the morals and politics of what he has written? Of course. Maybe he wanted his first- or third-person narrator to present the moral or political stand the reader gets. Maybe every novel unavoidably does that. Well, leave out the maybe.\n\nLet’s go to a classic first-person novel that has become controversial because of one word the narrator says. Huck says, “Nigger.” My spell-check allows that. But I’d rather analyze what I think is the best sentence in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. When the novel was published, it was banned in the public library of Concord, Massachusetts, not because Huck says Nigger but because he doesn’t speak correct English; his speech is “inelegant,” “immoral,” “rough,” “ignorant” and so on. (New York Herald, March 18, 1885) The only epithet the library board left out was “racist.” That was a twentieth-century problem; the word Nigger has banned the book any number of times since political correction became sort of vogue. I’ll be politically correct and choose this beautiful first-person sentence that has no dirty or politically incorrect words:\n\nWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop, we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where there was sick folks, maybe, and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad and awful still and grand. (The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, 1884)\n\nFour gross grammatical errors in one sentence does not a literary masterpiece make. Vernacular style, Mark Twain’s triumph in his novel, is the narrator’s powerful voice. This sentence fuses vulgarisms, the colloquial mode, realistic description, loose structure, and “high toned” language to describe a scene, evoke a mood, and mostly to characterize the narrator, the boy Huck Finn. “Well” establishes the colloquial mode, vulgarisms and the loose structure of Huck’s speech carries it through. The loose structure of the sentence, both subordinate and coordinate elements added on as Huck speaks, lets the reader share Huck’s perceptions in sequence. Mark Twain loved the river and wants us to see it the way he does. The same goes for Huck. Huck’s language isn’t always vulgar. He says Tom and me, not me and Tom, obeying school-teacher logic for correct, polite writing: always put yourself last in such cases. Mark Twain thought the incorrect “me” was enough vulgarity for his purposes. Huck and Tom look “away down” into the village, Huck’s neat confounding of “way” and “away” flavoring the perception. Then he looks very carefully and counts “three or four lights” – not some lights or a few lights. Both Huck and Mark Twain are realists; they specify as nearly as possible exactly what Huck sees. He sees in one image both pleasant twinkling and human frailty – “sick folks, maybe.” Huck sees the entire scene: man and nature are joined in the echoing image of sparkling stars.\n\nTwinkling lanterns and sparkling stars are ingenious parallels as well as symbols for the contrast between “sick folks” and “ever so fine.” Huck is a boy whose perceptions are finely tuned by compassion and aesthetic appreciation in the same moment. The beauty of the cosmos demands a vocabulary beyond his everyday talk. He borrows from Tom Sawyer’s “high toned” books the words “fine” and “still” and “grand” to convey his sensitivity to beauty. “Awful” is his everyday adjective/adverb for exceedingly.\n\n“Where there was sick folks, maybe” is the most telling perception in the book. The section preceding describes Jim’s weird superstitions, and it is followed by Tom Sawyer’s teaching his gang how to play a proper adventure according to the book. Between these passages of the unreal worlds of Tom’s innocence and Jim’s ignorance, Huck is his own man; he sees life truly. If Huckleberry Finn is a humorous book – and one may have serious doubts about that – the humor is heightened by Mark Twain’s and Huck’s tragic view of life.\n\nYou will notice that in my analysis of this sentence of fiction, I had to go to other parts of the novel to make points and that I should have gone still further into it to do the job right. I make no mention of Huck’s father or the two con men or Aunt Polly or Huck’s failed attempt to play a girl or the murder of a man on a public street. If this beautiful sentence is derived from Huck Finn’s tragic view of life I should have constructed the necessary links to the rest of the novel. Like my analysis of the sentence from Portnoy’s story, it fails to recognize the tangled web of fiction. Nonfiction has a web to be sure, but it’s not so tangled. So let’s analyze the makings of a descriptive sentence from another nineteenth-century classic, but which is not fiction.\n\nAfter this, came shaving and combing and brushing; and when, having spent the first part of the day in this way we sat down in the forecastle, in the afternoon, with clean duck trousers and shirts on, washed, shaved, and combed, and looking a dozen shades lighter for it, reading, sewing, and talking at our ease, with a clear sky and warm sun over our heads, a steady breeze over the starboard quarter, studding sails out alow and aloft and all the flying kites abroad – we felt that we had got back into the pleasantest part of a sailor’s life. (Richard Henry Dana, Two Years Before the Mast, 1840)\n\nA pretty long sentence, perfectly appropriate to its purpose. It comes from Richard Henry Dana’s Two Years Before the Mast. It was published when Dana was twenty-five years old. It was the first detailed description of life aboard a seagoing vessel written from the viewpoint of a seaman. “Viewpoint of a seaman” is sufficient identification of the narrator, a real person in a nonfictional work. Dana kept a full journal of the trip, feeling a moral obligation to tell it all, especially the life of the common seaman serving under a sadistic captain. The episodes of cruelty and daily life of hardship and danger are heightened in Dana’s record when he contrasts them with moments of serenity and pleasure in sentences like this one.\n\nEvery word in the sentence, ninety of them, add up to the main point in the bottom line: the pleasantest part of a sailor’s life. If an editor at Reader’s Digest tried to delete even one word, there would be serious loss of flavor in the sentence. The first part of the fairly lengthy paragraph shows the preparation the sailors made: the Sunday cleanup of their quarters and their bodies after a month of dirt accumulation – clearing out the forecastle, scrubbing and scraping the floor, drying and airing their bedding, washing and drying their filthy clothes, having a “freshwater wash” or bath with the sailors soaping and scrubbing, and dousing one another with buckets of water. At that point our sentence begins.\n\nIt describes a scene rather than an action, a still inserted into an adventure movie. The camera focuses on every aspect – the clean and refreshed sailors at center stage, enjoying their own company and the pleasant day and beautiful ship. With all our senses alerted, we share the pleasantest part of a sailor’s life. The sailor’s vocabulary is important to give the scene its flavor. The reader doesn’t have to know the vocabulary of the sea, exactly what the forecastle, the larboard quarter, the studding sails, and the flying kites are in order to share the feeling of the scene. (Of course, the experienced sailor reading it would know that the flying kites are abroad only in fair weather.) Dana was not parading his vocabulary inappropriately; he was using every means to convey the ambience of the scene at that moment. It took some doing for Dana to get it all into his one sentence: “When . . . we sat down in the forecastle” . . . (The cargo of ambience, fifty-eight words, come here) . . . “we felt that we had got back into the pleasantest part of a sailor’s life.” Without laboring the matter, I should point out that all the details have an appropriate and logical order, each part subordinated and coordinated properly with the other parts. All the spars and running lines are in order, and the sentence sails. The writer/narrator Dana is as meticulous with the sentence as if he were carving scrimshaw. I didn’t feel it necessary in order to appreciate his artistry to link the sentence with the rest of the book, with details of the captain’s cruelty or the crew’s responses or the interesting life they found in San Francisco. If the sentence were taken from a novel, I would have to have done just that. Why doesn’t he tell how the sailors felt about their nakedness as they bathed together? Why doesn’t he tell us what they were reading? What wonderful opportunities for fictional irony! Dana would have to say, “I’m not imagining this, it’s me, it’s nonfiction.” I hope you know now why most of my sentences are from nonfiction.\n\nWHAT IS A SENTENCE?\n\nMy teacher knew exactly. Evelyn Kottke in the sixth grade in Lincoln School in Stillwater, Minnesota, in 1930. Miss Kottke (None of my female teachers were married; against the rules.) taught us that a sentence was a complete thought. And she taught us how to make diagrams of complete thoughts right there on the blackboard. Most important, she taught us the names of all the parts of complete thoughts. The Huck Finn types in the class didn’t do so well. What good is this here junk? But I was a dutiful Tom Sawyer type and diagrammed with a flourish. I could rattle off the parts of speech and the helping verbs and the negatives like anything. When I taught English linguistics as a college professor I loved to take a deep breath and recite the helping verbs; they sounded like one long word. Be-am-is-are-was-were-been-have-has-had-do-did-does-may-can-shall-will-must-might-could-would-should. After the applause, I would tell them to forget that junk; we were going to learn about trees not diagrams, morphemes not lists of words. My mentor was Noam Chomsky, not Evelyn Kottke. We would ponder sentences like “Green ideas sleep furiously,” not “Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.” Do you think the Huck Finn types would have sat still parsing sentences? Page after page of “Time is a noun used as the subject of the verb in the nominative case.” Looking at those two sentences now, I do believe that Chomsky’s sentence is fiction and Miss Kottke’s is nonfiction. I sure would have a hard time now with green ideas. It was Miss Kottke who mentored me in the nonfiction narratives of classical Greek history. She drilled us furiously on the Greek battles and some of the Greek heroes. I’ll never forget Miltiades and Phidipedes and the Battles of Marathon and Salamis and the date 490 B.C.. I knew that Aristotle was close to that period and that helped me in my oral exam for the Masters Degree at the University of Minnesota when Professor Hornberger asked me when Aristotle lived. Thank you, Miss Kottke. But why didn’t you enlighten me a little about Greek mythology? Was it too hard? I guess she just wasn’t into fiction.\n\nNow I like the idea that a sentence is a complete thought. But when I was teaching, that idea was anathema among my colleagues, so I didn’t teach it. When I began teaching the English linguistics course in the 1950s, it was proper to tell the students that a sentence had a certain vocal shape, that the human voice in speech has variations in pitch: the voice goes from low to high in regular patterns that conform to the speaker’s meanings. A certain combination of pitch, stress (loudness) and pause signal the end of a sentence. The “structural linguists” at places like the University of Texas and Indiana University called this combination “an independent terminal juncture group” and when it was followed by silence, a sentence had been spoken. There were several other phonetic complications that were beyond me because I was a self-taught “linguist” with no guidance in how to hear sounds the way Professor Higgins could in “Pygmalion.” But a revolution occurred in 1957 with the publication of Noam Chomsky’s first book, Syntactic Structures. To be up to date, we had to teach “transformational grammar.” That suited me fine because I could handle the “trees” (they made more sense than diagrams) and I loved the morphemes that constituted the auxiliary part of the verb phrase: aux = t + (m) + (have + en) + (be + ing). The equals sign should be an arrow. That’s the way the experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology did it and I liked the mathematical look of it. T means tense, and M means modal. Very neat. It explains that stupid list of helping verbs that doesn’t distinguish the crucial difference between the T’s and the M’s. We called the exemplary, archetypical, root sentences “kernels.” Supposedly they underlay every actual sentence and the parenthetical elements in the kernel are optional. Tense is obligatory; every kernel has tense, of which there are only two in English, past and present. I realize this moment that being away from teaching for twenty-nine years, I’ve forgotten more of what I got from Chomsky fifty-two years ago than I have from what I got from Miss Kottke seventy-nine years ago. I couldn’t now teach a class about the nuances of grammaticality, deep structure, generative semantics, embedding, and all the rest of it. I even had to look up the formula for the auxiliary that I myself wrote. I wasn’t sure about it.\n\nAgain, what is a sentence? I’ll draw from all three systems of grammar I have lived through to arrive at a definition: Miss Kottke’s “prescriptive” grammar of complete thoughts, structural linguistics grammar of sounds converted into punctuation in writing, and Chomsky’s transformational grammar of deep structure. I’ll skip Chomsky’s matho-philosophical discussion, which I don’t understand, but I’ll cling to some of his basic assumptions for my discussion of good sentences. Transformations of sentences into questions, exclamations, indirect quotations, “there” sentences and “it” sentences, and many kinds of embeddings and modifications and subordinations – these changes in sentence structure remind the writer that he can choose from an infinite number of transformations as he writes a sentence. “Infinite” really means “no end of.” There is no possibility of writing the world’s longest sentence: you can always add another word to any sentence. Endless possibilities. Furthermore, you can add sentence structures inside sentence structures inside sentence structures inside, inside, inside . . . Grammar is recursive. A book about recursion I’ve tried to understand is Douglas Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. I recommend it if you’re young enough to want to tighten your mind.\n\nSince variety is often a quality that improves writing, making transformations is Chomsky’s contribution to the art of written style. Chomsky also revived the notion of the grammatical sentence. Chomsky wasn’t interested in reinforcing the grammatical purist’s fussing about who-whom and shall-will, but he made grammaticality a respectable and interesting concept by pointing out that “John is owning a house” and “Both of John’s parents are married to aunts of mine” are ungrammatical. (The second sentence would be OK now in states where same-sex marriage is legal.)\n\nThe definition of “sentence” for this manual derives from all three kinds of grammar I have lived through. A sentence is one of the infinitely variable expressions of the writer’s complete thought, punctuated into the code that translates the thought into written form. All of the example sentences I use here are good; some go beyond good and are artistic, poetic, and beautiful.\n\nSYNTAX AND RHYTHM\n\nAny sentence can be transformed into a different structure. This one, however seems unchangeable. As a matter of fact, this melodic sentence was created by Charles E. Weller as a slogan in Grant’s first campaign for President.\n\nNow is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.\n\nOne can easily come up with half a dozen different versions of a sentence. A writer polishing the thought he is constructing always keeps ringing changes on the sentence at hand. The opportunity to revise makes the difference between writing and speaking. One possible transformation is as follows: THE AID OF THE PARTY IS WHAT IT IS TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO COME TO NOW. Both “the aid of the party” and “now” are crucial elements in the sentence and deserve the emphatic prominence of initial and final position they have in the original and revised sentences. In the revision, however, they are reversed, conforming to the order of things in a kernel:\n\nsubject + verb + complement\n\nThis change required the use of a new element, the “what” clause, wordy and awkward. It also moved the object of the preposition “the aid of the party” away from the preposition “to” and resulted in the school-teacher’s bugaboo, ending the sentence (except for “now,” with a preposition). To conform with her rule, we can put “to” at the beginning – TO THE AID OF THE PARTY IS WHAT IT IS TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO COME NOW. This grammatically “correct” sentence is even more ludicrous than the first revision.\n\nA more proper version would be: THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO COME TO THE AID OF THE PARTY IS NOW. “Now” has even more emphasis than before but “the time” robs “the aid of the party” of its proper emphasis; “time” is just an empty word required for grammatical logic.\n\nHow about making “come” the main verb instead of “is”? ALL GOOD MEN SHOULD COME TO THE AID OF THE PARTY NOW. This change gives the active verb “come” a more important spot, which as is often said should make the sentence stronger. This new main verb seems to require the strong modal “should” to retain the meaning of the original. This revision is hard to fault. It has an admirable directness, the result of conforming to the model structure of the English declarative sentence:\n\nsubject + verb + adverb\n\nbut the two adverb elements, an adverb and a prepositional phrase, give the sentence a completely different rhythm. The original sings, or dances. Charles E. Weller must have loved the tune, three melodious phrases, the final one made up of three smaller phrases and ending with the only two-syllable word in the sentence. It’s the rhythm that gives the original its character.\n\nIt should be clear why I chose this sentence to analyze. We accept its meaning without question. No doubt that the writer certifies its intention in the real world. It intends what it says. Beyond that, the sentence is artistic. Its rhythm raises it above the ordinary sentence. Poetic is not too strong a word.\n\nNow I’d like to take a sentence that anyone would call poetic. It was written by America’s greatest poet, Emily Dickinson. I’m flabbergasted realizing that I have to classify it as nonfiction. Every word proclaims her identity. It’s part of a letter she wrote to a man she wanted to meet; she thought he might be her mentor: Mr. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a writer and newspaper publisher. I have to assume you know that Emily Dickinson was a single woman, part of a distinguished family in Amherst, Massachusetts, a recluse, who spent almost all of her time in her upstairs room, reading, thinking, and somewhat secretly writing poems. After she died, the large volume of poems appeared and eventually were published, after considerable editing, revising, and puzzling over. She made the Library of American Literature.\n\nI’ll quote the whole letter, which is in response to his earlier letter. The date is 1862, when Emily Dickinson, at the height of her power, wrote many of her greatest poems.\n\nYou think my gate “spasmodic” – I am in danger – Sir –\n\nYou think me “uncontrolled” – I have no Tribunal.\n\nWould you have time to be the “friend” you should think I need? I have a little shape – it would not crowd your Desk – nor make much Racket as the Mouse, that dents your Galleries –\n\nIf I might bring you what I do – not so frequent to trouble you – and ask you if I told it clear – ‘twould be control to me –\n\nThe sailor cannot see the North – but knows the needle can –\n\nThe “hand you stretch me in the dark,” I put mine in, and turn away – I have no Saxon, now –\n\nAs if I asked a common Alms,\n\nAnd in my wandering hand\n\nA stranger pressed a Kingdom,\n\nAnd I, bewildered, stand –\n\nAs if I asked the Orient\n\nHad it for me a Morn\n\nAnd it should lift it’s purple Dikes,\n\nAnd shatter me with Dawn!\n\nBut will you be my Preceptor, Mr. Higginson?\n\nWhen is Emily Dickinson writing nonfiction and when is she writing a poem? Every time she writes a line on her stationary or in her notebooks, the strong metrical note is iambic. It’s all poetry. Her punctuation in both letters and poems is primarily the seemingly casual dash, often used by many people in informal letters but, as scholars’ studies have revealed, not so casual in Dickinson. Any reading of her letters raises the same question I pose. Her poems are strictly metrical, like the one in her letter, iambic feet, three and four feet alternating:\n\nta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum –\n\nta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum –\n\nta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum –\n\nta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum –\n\nta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum –\n\ndum-ta – ta-dum – ta-dum –\n\nta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum –\n\nta-dum – ta-dum – ta-dum –\n\nThe metrics of our sentence would look like this:\n\nI-have – a-lit – tle-shape –\n\nIt-would – not-crowd – your-desk –\n\nNor-make – much-rack – et –\n\nLike – the-mouse –\n\nThat-dents – your-Gal – ler-ies –\n\nA perfect quatrain. As with the poem, there is no rhyme, but the poem has a trochaic foot in the sixth line. The sentence is rigidly unrhymed iambic trochaic.\n\nIf we ta-dum the previous sample sentence with the lines of a quatrain, we get the following:\n\ndum-ta – da-dum –\n\nNow is the time\n\nta-dum – ta-dum –\n\nFor all good men\n\nta-dum – ta-da-dum –\n\nTo come to the aid\n\nta-da – dum – ta\n\nof the party\n\nIt’s those anapests – the ta-da-dums – that give the catchy melody to the sentence. The syntax, the word order arranged by transformations, is my conception of style as I shall use the word in this book. Word order in nonfiction is my game. So I have to pay attention to prose rhythm.\n\nRhythm is intrinsic to all the arts. One of my favorite photographs made by my friend Dave Sadler is of three gulls flying in the sky. Their wings are in the same position, the direction of their flight is the same, the distances apart of their images are the same, but the distances from the viewer are different, making their sizes different, making them move. Rhythm is movement toward something. When my friend Dave Sadler was reading my manuscript for this work, he noticed something about my mention of the photo of three gulls. He got out the negative he used for the picture. He saw that in the darkroom he had taken out a fourth gull. It spoiled the image, he said. Yes, I said, you put rhythm into the picture; the fourth gull was flying in a different direction. This is a perfect example of how the artist can change nature to create an art object. Rhythm is obviously present in art, poetry, music, and dance. If you think of the Parthenon and Frank Gehry’s architecture, you see plenty of rhythm. We’ve had a glimpse of it in prose. Is there more to it than the occasional anapest?\n\nThe following idiomatic sentence was written by Dorothy Norman in her editor’s statement in the publication Twice a Year: A Book of Literature, the Arts, and Civil Liberties (1942). Her idealism and her elevated, formal style characterize the piece in which this sentence stands out. It has a strong rhythmic beat and moves forward to the central point. We were already in the war, but Dorothy Norman’s pacifist leanings still compel her to challenge the public support of the war:\n\nThe fact that the majority in America seem to believe in combating what threatens the core of our civilization on the field of battle, no matter whose the original fault, no matter whose the original error, no matter what the risk, no matter what the lack of clarity involved: this is the extraordinary fact.\n\nI remember well how I reacted to this statement. I was a rookie private in the army and also a member of “the majority in America.” Also willing to pay a large price (like two dollars) for something to read in the barracks. How can this woman criticize my intelligence? As far as I was concerned it was Hitler’s fault, the Draft Board made no error, I knew the risk I was taking, and nothing could be clearer. So there, Miss Norman. Ah, the sublime innocence of youth! (I was twenty-four.)\n\nNow, as an old man looking for rhythm in good sentences, I appreciate her words mightily. The sentence has a strong rhythmic beat, it moves forward to its concluding element, and it makes a strong central point. The beauty of the sentence lies in the idiom “no matter wh__” that introduces each repeated negative phrase. Idioms are the flavor of one’s native language, usually ungrammatical and confounding to the parser and diagrammer. H. W. Fowler’s A Dictionary of Modern English Usage says (that’s an idiom) that idiomatic English is “natural or racy or unaffected.” The foreign speaker learning English puzzles over idioms and makes crazy mistakes. He might come up with (another idiom) “The fault whose doesn’t matter.” For the native speaker, the correct and casual use of idioms is the sign of a realistic and often earthy perspective. The native listeners recognize the speaker as one of them; he is not talking down (another idiom) or hiding behind a screen. A forthright use of idiom imports into print the colloquial mode and its stylistic advantages.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary found “no matter wh__” in print as early as 1550. It is the elliptical vestige of something like “it is no matter” and must have gone through (another one) many speakers before achieving currency and respectability and status as a synonym for “regardless of” or “in spite of.” In Miss Norman’s sentence it seems stronger than the synonyms would be, probably because of the power of “no.” It’s more sweeping, more absolute. At any rate, (there I go again – and again, even in parentheses; those racy idioms must be recursive) that idiom contrasts sharply with the rest of the sentence. “Threatens the core of our civilization on the field of battle” is so overblown and hackneyed that the sentence would have fallen in a heap (that’s an analogy instead of an idiom, according to Fowler) had Norman not used the wonderful idiom four times to give the sentence some muscle (another analogy – or call it a metaphor).\n\nTRANSFORMATIONS\n\nGiving your sentences some variation is a good recommendation for writers. This manual enthusiastically recommends it, asks for it, begs for it, demands it, will keep you after school if you don’t obey. It’s the whole point of the manual. There are any number of ways to vary sentences. Syntactic variation is my aim, changes in the order of words, phrases, and clauses. Transformations. When changes in position are made, several other kinds of changes also occur because transformations are fundamental. When an architect makes one change in his plan anything else can change. A change in the size of a window may require a different color of rug, a different drain in the shower. I remember a movie like that with Cary Grant. Myrna Loy wanted some little changes and Cary got stuck paying for major alterations.\n\nI’ll build a paragraph and try some changes.\n\nThere’s a park in that part of the city that we visited often. There’s a beautiful fountain there that always refreshed us just to look at it from a distance. There used to be a kiosk there where we’d buy a magazine and sit down and read, but there is nothing commercial there any longer.\n\nI don’t like all the “theres.” There must be a way to change that. Some of the “theres” are the result of a particular transformation. It’s an empty word, has only grammatical meaning. As in Rudy Vallee’s drinking song “There Is a Tavern in the Town.” Without the transformation, the kernel that underlies it would be “A tavern is in the town.” The kernel nearly always has the verb “is,” but Emily Dickinson wrote a sentence that doesn’t: “There comes a wind like a bugle.” The kernel would be “A wind comes like a bugle.” The kernel in “there” transformations usually ends with an adverb denoting place. In my paragraph, the places are “that part of the city,” “there,” and “in the park.” Emily Dickinson, of course, goes her own way. She ends her sentence with an adverbial phrase “like a bugle” denoting how the wind acts, not where. She needed that because she chose the verb “come.” But her sentence still uses the “there” transformation.\n\n“There” can also be a full adverb itself, not an empty grammatical word. I wrote two of them in my paragraph: “a fountain there” and “a kiosk there.”\n\nA good copy editor would have red marks all over my paragraph. She would cut out two “there” transformations and one of the “there” adverbs. This is what she would send to the printer with no objections from me:\n\nWe often visited the park in that part of the city. The beautiful fountain there refreshed us, just to look at it from a distance. We bought a magazine in the kiosk and sat down and read, but now there’s nothing commercial in the park.\n\nInstead of the “be” verbs, also rather empty, except for tense, she uses “visited” and “refreshed” and “buy” as the main verbs. They put life in the scene. She keeps the final “there” transformation, giving “commercial” an emphasis that makes a strong assertion. And she saved a line of type. In art, they say, less is more.\n\nSuppose the copy editor tries another transformation that I’ll call the “it’s” transformation. Notice the apostrophe. (If you go back to Emily Dickinson’s poem in her letter to Mr. Higginson, she writes “And it should lift it’s purple Dikes.” There’s no “it’s” transformation in that line. Her spelling was bad; she meant “its,” the possessive pronoun and together with the two relative pronouns “it” in the poem all the itses refer to the antecedent “Orient.”) The “it’s” in the transformation, another empty word, is often followed by an adjective signaling a “that” noun clause. The “it’s” transformation has the stylistic effect of emphasizing one word:\n\nIt’s true that baby rats are cute.\n\nIt’s horrible that Aunt Lucy eats worms.\n\nIt’s incredible that President Buchanan was homosexual.\n\nBut not any old adjective can be emphasized in that way:\n\nIt’s blue that . . .\n\nIt’s large that . . .\n\nIt’s swift that . . .\n\nMy paragraph could use the “it’s” transformation sometimes:\n\nIt was often that we visited the park in that part of the city. It was refreshing just to look at the fountain from a distance. We used to buy a magazine in the kiosk, but it’s just as well that nothing commercial is allowed in the park now.\n\nNotice that “it’s” has to be “it was.” The adjective “often” doesn’t work here, but it would be fine if negative: “It wasn’t often that . . .” If I were teaching a class, I would suggest that the students could do an interesting study of different types of adjectives with “it’s” and negatives. Maybe they could determine whether “often” is an adjective or an adverb.\n\nOther changes in syntax could be used with these sentences; any writer with a little ingenuity can easily make them without the trained skill of a linguist. The native speaker of English has the transformations already installed and stored on his mental hard disk. When a writer feels that a sentence is unclear or awkward, he revises by ringing some transformational changes on it.\n\nPUNCTUATION\n\nMy teacher-colleagues would have ridiculed me had I, back then, called a sentence a complete thought. Now I like the idea and leave it as part of my definition of a sentence. It’s a reasonable idea, providing we are talking about a written sentence. All of my sample sentences are complete thoughts because the writers punctuated them as complete thoughts. When the writer has put a period down at the end of a group of words, he has completed the thought he is expressing. Only the writer knows that; it’s his thought. It’s the writer, not the reader, or the linguist, or the epistemologist who determines when his thought is complete. The thought may be dumb, irrelevant, weird, or thoughtless, but he is expressing it as he likes and ending its expression when he wants to. The writer is the only master of his own thoughts. I labor the point because I want writers to accept their privileges and responsibilities in the matter of the style and thought of his own sentences. In every sentence he writes, he must make and has the opportunity to make countless changes.\n\nA sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a period. That’s it. The punctuation code has evolved over the course of several centuries and is still evolving. It’s a difficult code to learn. Copy editors manage it, and writers keep personalizing it. Emily Dickinson pretty much ignored it. Regardless of the firm rules that editors follow from their style books, punctuation is to an important degree subjective and can be controlled by the writer’s predilections. It can be stylistically expressive. The writer can use punctuation so subtly that only an alert reader familiar with the writer’s style will be aware of some of his meanings. The writer’s own way of using semicolons, say, may lead to misinterpretation. Punctuation is a loose code. It is also extremely important for effective communication.\n\nLewis Mumford, author of several weighty dissertations on machines and cities, made the colon a distinctive part of his style. The colon, probably the least popular mark of punctuation, is usually found in sentences in which a complete statement announces an important piece of information that follows the colon: an emphatic completion of the sentence, like this one. The University of Chicago Press, Manual of Style points out, mysteriously, that the colon is used “to mark a discontinuity of grammatical construction greater than that indicated by a semicolon and less than that indicated by a period.” Less and more are anybody’s guess. Mumford often reinforces his declaratory style by using a colon. You need read only half a page to find an example. He uses the colon to announce what is coming, but he uses it for other reasons as well. I choose at random a passage from The City in History. (p. 284)\n\nBut there is still a brewery in Bruges which now occupies almost one whole side of Waalplaats, built on the same scale as the residence beside it: the loading is done in the courtyard.\n\nAt first glance the colon is puzzling. Why doesn’t Mumford use a period? Isn’t the thought complete? What’s the continuity to the part after the colon. A more alert reading of the preceding sentence provides the context to explain that colon:\n\nThe competition for space between the domestic and the working quarters, as business grew and the scale of production expanded, was doubtless responsible for encroachment over the original back gardens by shed, storage bins, and special workshops.\n\nIt’s clear now that the colon subtly links the apparently incidental comment about loading to the idea in the preceding sentence about the competition between domestic and working quarters and that loading is encroaching over the courtyard. We know now that loading is a working quarters matter and the courtyard is living quarters. The colon announces one result of the encroachment, the loading. The colon is doing its job of completing the thought. A period would lose the connection. I accept Mumford’s sentence as one complete though as punctuated. I must disagree with the University of Chicago Press saying that the semicolon indicates a closer link between two grammatical elements than does a colon. I leave you to ponder the extremely colonic structure of the following sentence from Mumford’s The Myth of the Machine. (p. 66)\n\nWhat Huizinga says of play is basic to man’s early expression in ritual: ritual creates order and is order: indeed, it is probably the aboriginal form of that make-believe which is inseparable from human culture: the game, the drama, the ceremony, the contest, in fact the whole range of the symbolic performance.\n\nThree colons in one sentence! And it is still just one sentence according to my definition.\n\nAs I have said, people do not speak spontaneously in sentences. Sentences are written artifacts. Structural linguists observed that in the human utterance various vocal pauses and changes in the pitch and stress of our stream of syllables give the listener a great many clues to our meaning. Some of these clues have been translated into our punctuation code. Thus the “terminal juncture group” translates to the period. Think of the sound as the parallel to a full cadence in music, a concluding note. “Down by the the gas house, free BEER” (or “Shave and a haircut, two BITS”) as a musical conclusion. Equating the terminal juncture group to the period fails when the voice changes one or more of the features of the sound. Speakers don’t always drop their voice when they pause, and a pause may come even in the middle of a word. Strictly translating the sounds into punctuation could result in what the English teacher would call run‑on sentences or sentence fragments, grave errors that she corrects with punctuation. I have no scientific proof of writers hearing their sentences as they write, but I know I hear mine. My mind catches every nuance. Remember Harold Hill in “The Music Man”? He got the kids to play instruments by thinking the tunes.\n\nAs I write, I think and hear my sentences, punctuation included. My earliest training in the rules of grammar taught me the classic form of the written English sentence: a subject followed by a verb and whatever goes with the verb, together with syntactic transformations. In short I like my words to conform to conventional syntax. I punctuate accordingly. When I silently pronounce sentences, I’m aware of various kinds of pauses and also of the length of my thoughts. I believe I’m conscious of regulating the length of my sentences. When I feel that I have said enough for my mind to apprehend the proper shape of the thought, I pause, I type a period. I assume (guess, that is) that my reader follows the rhythm of my thoughts and sentences.\n\nI think all the marks of punctuation. Commas are the hardest. When I listen to myself write, I can hear a slight rise in pitch and a slight pause. So I type a comma. But there are so many degrees of pitch and pause that I can’t be sure what I want until I look at the words and let their meanings make the decisions. I’m not consistent with commas.\n\nIn the publications I read these days, my school-teacher inclinations see lots of run‑on sentences and sentence fragments. Writers are creative and follow their own rules. Editors seem to accept them readily. Editors understand that writers break the old rules for the sake of creative expression.\n\n(Time out. I have a doctor’s appointment.)\n\nYesterday my driver, Dave, and I went to the hospital and saw the urologist’s nurse practitioner. We always chat up those cute women:\n\nNP: What did you do, what was your occupation?\n\nMe: I’m a retired English professor.\n\nNP: Oh, who’s your favorite author?\n\nMe: Right now, me.\n\nDave: He’s writing a book.\n\nNP: What about?\n\nMe: Style and grammar.\n\nNP: Oh, English grammar. Did you diagram sentences in school? Yeah, that was awful. I hated it.\n\nDave: Me too. I’ve forgotten all that junk. What good was it? I’d never use it.\n\nMe: When did you graduate from high school?\n\nNP: 1982.\n\nDave: 1953.\n\nMe: And I graduated in 1936. Loved diagramming.\n\nNP: Really? English never changes.\n\nYou can say that again. English never changes. The way it’s taught, that is. But English, like every language, is always changing. That includes the rules. Reputable writers break them all the time. They write run‑on sentences and sentence fragments fearlessly. Editors allow them, understanding that where writers put a period or a comma is a deliberate stylistic choice. Teachers, of course, don’t dare accept readily what may be a student’s ignorance of the code.\n\nI have chosen some passages I ran across in a book of essays from about fifteen years ago. The writers must be respectable because they were included in this book, The Best Essays of 1995. In spite of their nontraditional punctuation, are they good (correct)? Would you change the punctuation? Would you change something else? Does their punctuation convey any special meaning that you could express in a different way?\n\nThis drama had to be played out by the rules of passion. She denied my allegations, I returned to the window. She got out of bed, her face wet with tears, to prevent me from leaving in anger. She had only a T‑shirt on. (Joel Agee, p. 28)\n\nThe ambulance people came, and I whispered to them that I could not walk or sit up. Or breathe. They went down for a gurney and for oxygen. (Harold Brodkey, p. 42)\n\nThe exterior of the cathedral, like the day outside, was large, suburban, bland. Inside were perhaps sixty quiet men, a few women, in a great dim space splashed with stained glass and saints, banners and candles and embroidered robes. Rituals of ancient times, employed to comfort sufferers of the modern plague. (Dudley Clendinen, p. 66)\n\nI think about food. Just boiled water for instant Ramen noodles, threw in the spice packet and made my own sauce of watered down ketchup, basil, sesame seeds and soy sauce. With oil, a drop or two. There’re two pork chops in the refrigerator, rib ends at 1.99/lb, and these would be good later, with teriyaki sauce, pepper, and basil again, broiled with a spray of brown sugar when it’s close to done, a spray done with the hand, watercress on the side, that’s enough. And perhaps wine. No potatoes, no night shade. No grains with the meat. (Josephine Foo, p. 93)\n\nThe kitchen was permanent, irredeemable, irresistible kink. Unassimibly African. No matter what you did, no matter how hard you tried, you couldn’t de-kink a person’s kitchen. So you trimmed off as best you could. (Henry Louis Gates, p. 119)\n\nIt wasn’t just the drama of the animals, it was the landscape. (Diana Kappel-Smith, p. 141)\n\nUNITY AND COHERENCE\n\nI heard a writer say he was going crazy revising what he had written the day before. “Why don’t they make a computer that would do that for me?” An ad for movie software says “Rewriting is the bread and butter of the professional screenwriter.” And then it tries to sell you Magic Software that will make your Apple computer a revising machine that will do that horrible job “painlessly.”\n\nMaking text (I know some of that lingo) coherent is an important part of revision. Thoughts have to hang together. English provides pronouns to do that job. He, her, that in a sentence hangs it together with John, Mary, chocolate in a sentence coming before. “Why did he give her that?” is the cohering response to “John is allergic to chocolate.” The sentences are tightly bound together. I assume that the more coherent sentences are the longer they can be and still be one complete thought. For example, a sentence containing dozens of items in a long series separated by commas may be too long for a reader to comprehend, unless the items are organized in some simplifying way to reduce the separateness of them. Human perception can easily see wholeness (unity) in up to seven parts, but beyond seven, coherence weakens. If you’re asked to get eight items of groceries, you either have to write them down or organize them in your mind in a small number of related groups. (1. milk, butter, cheese; 2. wieners, bacon, and a chicken; 3. crackers, bread, cookies, and potato chips.) Three groups are easier to remember than seven.\n\nHere are some ways that English helps sentences cohere: The crucial words are in italics:\n\nHe looked fine when I saw him Christmas, but the next day he died.\n\nThe Dodgers took the Series that night, and the score was announced simultaneously on Johnny Carson.\n\nRonnie spent his allowance generously, but as for Jimmie, he’s a tightwad.\n\nDiana is always mocking the members, and that’s why we blackballed her.\n\nTom, Dick, and Harry like movies and all of them want to be doctors.\n\nThe baby was cranky about getting up and she was the same at bedtime.\n\nThere were fifteen football players on the bus; I didn’t think it would be so quiet.\n\nThe hotel was all lit up, and the top floor was reserved for the Yankees.\n\nVeronica saw the movie, and she read the novel too.\n\nThe secretary took the nominee’s names and he also passed out ballots.\n\nI am impressed by how many ways the language enables us, almost forces us to bind words together. We would never say “Joe thought Joe owed it to Joe.” We say, “Joe thought he owed it to himself.” The pronouns make connections. Coherence can be caused by rhythm. Lincoln said repetitiously and rhythmically, “Of the people, by the people and for the people.” If he had said “of, by, and for the people,” the expression would not have become so classic. A fairly strict line separates prose from poetry. Regular meter and rhyme are outlawed in prose. Alliteration is discouraged. Prose is devoted more to the straight communication of thought. The indirectness of poetic expression is distracting. Writers avoid jerky sentences and dragging rhythm, jarring effects, monotonous, boring repetition. Revising is removing distracting rhythm. (I should remove at least one of the ings in that sentence.) A climactic conclusion, a heavy beat at the end. I write the sentence “His favorite sports were tennis, golf and intercollegiate football,” reserving the strong beat for the end. “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. “Their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.” Don’t revise those words.\n\nSENTENCE SENSE\n\nWriters have a sentence sense. When Annie Dillard was a girl, putting together the chaotic world of her perceptions, she composed and memorized sentences to keep things together. Playing detective, she tried to remember the face of a “suspect” who had a case of beer in his car. “He has a wide mouth; his mouth corners fall directly beneath his eyes’ outer corners . . .” It was easier to remember a sentence than a sight, and the sentences suggested sights new or skewed. She discovered, of course, that the world of her perceptions would not remain still fastened down with her sentences, but reading her An American Childhood convinces me that her sentence sense reinforced her memory of childhood images.\n\nA writer without a sentence sense doesn’t exist. Experienced writers, I am sure, feel their work progressing sentence by sentence. Having begun a sentence they sense its ending. The fine tuning of revision is changing tiny details. Changing a detail in a present sentence can require a change anyplace in the previous parts. Each individual sentence is only settled when the whole piece is done. Sometimes a writer is so satisfied with one sentence that he chooses to cancel several others. He suffers an excruciating awareness of all aspects of his writing – the tone, the clarity, all the things I’ve been dealing with here. Underlying and supporting everything is his sentence sense. Compare it with the painter’s sense of contact with the canvas. Writing without a sentence sense would be like painting blind or painting like an elephant holding the brush, with his trunk. This may sound as if you have to be born a writer. If you’re blind, you’re blind; if you’re an elephant, you’re an elephant. On the contrary, I think writers develop their sentence sense. Practice, practice is the way to Carnegie Hall. Watch Itzhak Perlman play his violin and consider the practice that gave him his bowing sense. He doesn’t think about it, he just plays. He practiced endlessly, practiced the right things, as do the painter and the writer.\n\nThe rest of this manual contains my analyses of several dozen good sentences written by American writers, most of them writing in the twentieth century. You will notice that I often sound as if I’m reading the author’s mind. Impossible. I can’t avoid sounding like that because I have to attribute my thoughts to the writer. Every literary critic has to do that. He’s simply assuming that the writer knows what he is doing and so does he. He’s only describing the effect of the writing on him.\n\nHENRY GEORGE: The Metaphoric Sentence\n\nHenry George (1839–1897) wrote only one book of consequence. It was published in 1879 and was still in print in 1952 when I bought a copy. The Henry George Institute was founded in 1971 “in the belief that the philosophy of Henry George has important answers to today’s problems.” The institute subscribes to George’s main idea, a single tax on land. George had spent his early life as a sailor. At fifteen he sailed around the world and landed in San Francisco. There he became a printer in a new town. San Francisco was a town of criminals, shacks, and the destitute; he witnessed both progress and poverty. He began writing his book at night after having a revelation in San Francisco about land speculation and poverty:\n\nI asked a passing teamster . . . what land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing so far off they looked like mice, and said, I don’t know exactly, but there’s a man over there who will sell some land for a thousand dollars an acre. [a fantastic price at the time] Like a flash it came over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty with advancing wealth. With the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege. (Wikipedia)\n\nWhite parasols and elephants mad with pride are the flowers of a grant of land.\n\nThe sentence is a puzzler. How can “parasols” and “elephants” be linked together so casually and equated with “flowers”?\n\nHenry George’s book deals with the national economy, advocating a single tax, an extremely radical notion, argued so convincingly and expressed so well that its devotees have been and still may be legion. George’s point is in two parts, the problem and the remedy. Our sample sentence concludes the section that analyzes the problem. He expresses it in the most prosaic way:\n\nA consideration of the manner in which the speculative advance in land values cuts down the earnings of labor and capital and checks production, leads, I think, irresistibly to the conclusion that this is the main cause of industrial depressions to which every civilized country, and all civilized countries together, seem increasingly liable. . . . That land speculation is the true industrial depression is, in the United States, clearly evident. The land is the source of all wealth. It is the mine from which must be drawn the ore that labor fashions. . . . All the advantages gained by the march of progress go to the owners of land.\n\nNothing puzzling in these expository sentences leading up to our sentence: George’s writing is eminently clear, forceful, and direct. This sentence is the only one in the book that stirs the reader’s imagination with poetic indirection and poetic power. No wonder – George didn’t write it. Or, at least, he doesn’t want us to give him credit for it. He attributes it to the Brahmins, who “said it ages ago.” I have not found the origin of the words. The entire passage he quotes does not seem to be from a poem: “To whomsoever the soil at anytime belongs, to him belong the fruits of it. White parasols and elephants mad with pride are the flowers of a grant of land.” The striking imagery, “white parasols” and “elephants mad with pride” comes clear with some historical perspective.\n\nThe Brahmins, the Hindu priestly caste, resented the usurpations of the colonizing power, the British Empire. How bland would be a prosaic statement of their anger: The life-style of the British class is the privilege they have seized, the product of the land they have stolen from us and granted to themselves. But in our sentence, picture an English lady strolling in the sun under a white parasol shading her delicate white skin. Picture a highly trained elephant in the employ of an English landowner, sharing arrogantly in the superiority and pride of the Raj. These images are alive and give this otherwise indifferent sentence its distinction.\n\nHENRY MILLER: The Contextual Sentence\n\nWhen I was in college, Henry Miller’s books were banned in the library. They were so dirty, some of them, they were even banned by law and were confiscated by the authorities who searched the baggage of travelers returning from France. The only one we could find, The Colossus of Marousi, was so much fun that my friends and I read it aloud to each other. It was a perfectly clean book about Greece. A few years later, when I came across The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn, I blushed. They don’t seem that dirty today.\n\nI chose this sentence because it is singled out as “one surprisingly good sentence” in a review by Bernard Devoto of Henry Miller’s The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, a book about a trip Miller took across the country. I respect Devoto’s opinion and want to justify it. (Even though he considered the book dated and sophomoric.) First of all, the sentence is a fragment, a sin in Miss Kottke’s eyes, but I accept it as a complete thought. Devoto had no objection to fragments either; he wrote two of them in his review. He probably had smuggled a couple of Miller’s earlier books across the border as well.\n\nOur sentence is the final one of the chapter called “From Grand Canyon to Burbank.”\n\nThe real California began to make itself felt. I wanted to puke. But you have to get a permit to vomit in public. So I drove into a hotel and took a room with a radio apparatus that looked like a repository for dirty linen. Bing Crosby was crooning away – the same old tune which I had heard in Chattanooga, Boswell’s tavern, Chickamauga and other places. I wanted Connie Boswell but they were out of her for the moment. I took my socks off and hung them around the knob of the radio to choke it off. There were no beetles or bed-bugs – just the heavy roar of the traffic on the concrete strip. And Bing Crosby, of course, somewhere out in the blue on the invisible ether waves owned by the five-and-ten cent store.\n\nWriters characteristically lead up to a final sentence just as a composer leads up to a full cadence. Unlike this fragment, the typical final sentence sounds like a final sentence. This one sounds like a footnote or a PS, something tacked on. Miller must have wanted it that way, like a thought that just occurred to him. It’s part of his talky style. Don’t be fooled into thinking Miller was just winging it thoughtlessly.\n\nOn the contrary, this sentence reinforces the main point of the entire chapter. The chapter presents two Californias, the real California that made him want to puke and the ethereal one that expresses his dream, the lost “paradise” of his imagined pioneers coming through the pass and looking down on a new world. His imagined world, as invoked in the chapter is “somewhere about a mile up towards God” and he wants to go back through the pass “on foot, holding my hat reverently and saluting the Creator.” Miller wants to be out in the blue. Bing Crosby got there on the ether waves, but Miller knows that the ethereal California has been swallowed up by the dime-store world of the real California. He gives the real California the last word in this sentence.\n\nNobody loved the West more than Bernard Devoto. He wrote his best books about it. One understands his appreciation of this sentence. It’s ironic that Henry Miller stayed in California and made his home a mecca on the beach for the kind of sophomoric young people, idealistic hippies, that Devoto hated.\n\nThere is a lesson in this – look at an expert witness’s sensitivity to a good sentence. The effective sentence gets its strength from its relevance and appropriateness to context. Taken from the web of logical, semantic, and metaphorical threads that give the sentence its place in the context, the sentence is stripped of everything but grammatical structure. The good writer reinforces his sentences with a variety of contextual references that enrich the web.\n\nJAMES BALDWIN: The Logical Sentence\n\nI first read James Baldwin in an essay in a magazine. It was about how a black American feels living in Europe, and it was powerful. I knew I had found a really great writer. It was 1953, early in the civil rights movement, before all the demonstrations and marches. What I was reading by white writers in liberal publications gave me my stance on race relations. Like those writers, I was a naive partisan, waiting for ignition. I think Baldwin, with his later essays, was the spark for white liberal engagement. Baldwin taught us both outrage and understanding of the terribly complex matter that race relations in America is. Nobody else had Baldwin’s expressiveness and legitimacy.\n\nBaldwin’s works are on the shelves of the Library of American Literature, a good sign of his permanence as a writer. Our sentence is from an essay in Nobody Knows My Name (1960):\n\nIt is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one’s own: in the face of one’s victim, one sees oneself. Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become.\n\nFour “ones” in the sentence express the tone of formality and seriousness. “One” is everybody, and Baldwin meant everybody, male and female, black and white.\n\nIn his essays, Baldwin always deals with black and white, both logically (opposites) and socially (oppositionally). He always chooses the extreme word, the word that defies subtle distinctions: “a terrible, an inexorable law.” No shades of gray, no maybe. Some writers comb their thesauruses for synonyms that fine-tune their sentences and lose the reader who wants bottom-line meaning, but Baldwin chooses the absolute word for life-or-death confrontation: In the village essay, in sentences referring to the race problem, this is Baldwin’s vocabulary: disastrous, inescapable, impossibility, unforeseeable, terrorization, indispensable, bottomless, dead, monster, and absoluteness. The last word is the tone of the piece; it’s what grabbed me. For Baldwin, there was an absolute, fundamental discord between the races.\n\nThe main verb of our sentence is “is” and its complement is “law.” Given that framework, the sentence demands elements that are unyielding and uncompromising. Every element that follows conforms to the pattern, either negative or insistently extreme. The colon announces the ironic consequence of the law as it affects “one.” It also introduces the final sentence of the essay, the consequence to the nation: “Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become.”\n\n“We” are all of us, according to the inexorable law, and in Harlem black and white see and are seen by each other, and in that vision, both can know what the nation has become; Baldwin’s exacting logic has worked out a painful irony. Our sentence is the key to the essay.\n\nJOHN HERSEY: The Atomic Sentence\n\nWhen John Hersey was assigned the job of describing a situation, how it feels to survive the greatest catastrophe in history, he faced the challenge of creating new images he never before had seen in print. Our sentence is from a description of something no writer Hersey knew about had ever put down in words before. He was challenged to invent new ways to express the hitherto never expressed. Hersey met the challenge a year after the tragedy. His was the first detailed picture of the human dimension of the atom bomb explosion. Everything had to be given careful explanation. Our sentence from Hiroshima was a challenge for its many readers as well. What does an atomic explosion sound like? What’s an atomic burn?\n\nOur sentence focuses on one tiny facet of the atomic burn, presenting an astonishing unknown fact, not in itself a painful matter but completely surprising for Hersey and his readers of the result of the explosion. In the sentence, he works up to it in stages and saves the shock and irony to the end. The point comes to the reader as it probably came to observers at the scene.\n\nOn some undressed bodies, the burns had made patterns – of undershirt straps and suspenders and, on the skin of some women (since white repelled the heat from the bomb and dark clothes absorbed it and conducted it to the skin), the shapes of flowers they had had on their kimonos.\n\nFirst we see naked bodies – not unexpected. Then we see that on the bodies are patterns – slightly surprising. At this point, Hersey uses a dash – something new coming up. He has to prepare us for shock. The expected patterns, of straps and suspenders, segues into “the skin of some women” – why women? He explains carefully this curious circumstance in parentheses (not because it is incidental information but necessarily because it is a new, strange fact of life). Finally we get the shocker, “the shapes of flowers they had had on their kimonos.” The ironic symbol of the death not only of 80 to 100 thousand Japanese lives but of Japanese culture, which the bomb had reduced to a reflection on the backs of Japanese women.\n\nI must emphasize that Hersey’s sentence puts the new information about atomic bombs into parentheses not so that the reader can skip over it but because it prepares the reader for the shock of the new. If we do skip over it lightly, we have to go back and pay attention to it.\n\nA term paper about The New Yorker’s “Hiroshima” written by Steve Rothman of Trinity College and published on the Internet is worth checking out. Rothman says that two editors and the author spent over a week editing the manuscript and Harold Ross made over two hundred queries about the words. Can a wrecked bicycle be called “lopsided”? They agreed on “crumpled.” Rothman says, “Every sentence was carefully deliberated.”\n\nE. L. DOCTOROW: The Two Narrators Sentence\n\nOne difference between the prose of fiction and the prose of nonfiction is that the writer of fiction is creating a fictional narrator’s voice, a voice that is not his own. He uses his own voice in the real world of his life. All the references in his fiction sentences point to the world his imagination is creating. Henry James believed that every sentence of “characterization” is at the same time a sentence that moves the action of the plot. And so on; all the sentences contribute to all the functions that keep the novelist’s fictional world whole. The novelist is a juggler keeping all the balls in the air.\n\nThe narrator of E. L. Doctorow’s Billy Bathgate (1989) is a boy who takes great pride in being able to juggle things with his quick hands. As the narrator, he juggles the functions of storytelling as well as Henry James.\n\nAll the cans came back except one, and if a crowd had been standing around, which there wasn’t, for who in the fresh world of the morning wants to watch the cleanup of the night before, the truck motors grinding, the ashcans hitting the sidewalk with that tympanic carelessness of the profession, nobody would have noticed that the truck drove away with one packed garbage can embedded in all that odorous crap of the glamorous night, or dreamed that in an hour or two it would be shoveled by tractor deep below the anguished yearnings of the flights of seagulls wheeling over the Flushing Meadow landfill.\n\nOur sentence focuses on a garbage can representing to an onlooker the routine of the everyday world of the big city that Doctorow created. This big city world shows itself in several of its facets in the sentence: morning in the city, the city of the working person, the glamorous nightlife of the city, its residue of crap, its connection to the natural world – the feeding gulls. But, of course, we do not see any of this directly. All of it is what Billy and Doctorow see.\n\nBilly is a special onlooker in the novel, a boy who has been drawn into the lives of Dutch Schultz and his gang and to tell what he sees. Or not to tell what he sees. What he has just seen is a terrible murder by Schultz, and he is looking at the garbage can containing the body of the victim. It is not the first murder by Schultz that he has seen, but it is the most shocking. The victim is a fire inspector who has appeared at the door of Schultz’s headquarters possibly in the service of the city’s political system as a spy on the gang’s activities. Instead of simply getting him out of the building, Schultz falls on him, chokes him to death, and smashes his head to a pulp. Billy is sent for a garbage can and the monstrous Irving folds the body and pushes it into the can. Billy is now focusing on the can and reacting to its ordinary appearance. He is already trying to forget what he has seen, but even the image of the flying gulls will remind him. The sentence is freighted with the entire world of the novel, which is Billy’s world.\n\nThe question is, Who is talking? Billy is obviously perceiving, but just as obviously he is not speaking. These are not his words: “fresh world of the morning,” “tympanic carelessness,” and “anguished yearnings.” Doctorow is using his own vocabulary. “Which there wasn’t” and “crap” could be the everyday language of the boy from Brooklyn, but the language and the images of the workers and the seagulls are obviously Doctorow’s. He is not following the lead of Mark Twain, incorporating his own insights but attributing them to Huck Finn. Mark Twain did not merely suggest Huck’s speech, he created it wholly. For Doctorow, it was enough to suggest the boy’s voice. The somewhat loose structure suggests the boy’s artlessness, the innocent perspective – “Who would have thought?” – is the boy’s. The language that sustains the boy-narrator’s world. This distinction between the narrator’s voice and the author’s language is an admirable aspect of this remarkable fiction.\n\nTHORSTEIN VEBLEN: The Gobbledygook Sentence\n\nThe author of this sentence obviously had an “attitude.” His very popular book The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899) disparaged and satirized the wealthy of the Gilded Age. They are characterized as indulging in conspicuous consumption, a term created by him and so current and useful as to require no quotation marks.\n\nVeblen was a Midwesterner with the Midwestern view of life associated with the humor of Garrison Keillor, Charles Schultz, and Sinclair Lewis. He came from a Norwegian-American farm family and his books show his attachment to the realities of earthy life. But he was a highly regarded economist and wrote several books of economic wisdom. Our sentence comes from his remarks about bequests by the wealthy to found “charitable” institutions, for a foundling asylum or retreat for invalids.\n\n“The diversion of expenditure to honorific waste in such cases is not uncommon enough to cause surprise or even to raise a smile. An appreciable share of the funds is spent in the construction of an edifice faced with some aesthetically objectionable but expensive stone, covered with grotesque and incongruous details, and designed, in its battlemented walls and turrets and its massive portals and strategic approaches to suggest certain barbaric methods of warfare. The interior of the structure shows the same pervasive guidance of the canons of conspicuous waste and predatory exploit.”\n\nOur sentence follows:\n\nThe windows, for instance, to go no further into detail, are placed with a view to express their pecuniary excellence upon the chance beholder from the outside, rather than with a view to effectiveness or comfort of the beneficiaries within; and the detail of interior arrangement is required to conform itself as best it may to this alien but imperious requirement of pecuniary beauty.\n\nThe passage preceding our sentence explains the humor, why the sight should “raise a smile.” It raised a smile to Veblen and would to any reader with an ounce of Veblen’s cynicism. The incongruity of spending large sums of money on over-decorating, with symbols of warfare, a building ostensibly built to succor the unfortunate may not have raised a smile among the leisure class of that day. What he describes is like putting a pink ribbon on a potato before offering it to a starving man. Veblen’s humor was not enjoyed by economists either, whose language for the most part was gobbledygook. But I’m sure Veblen’s thoughts would have pleased his architect contemporaries Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, who were revolutionizing the architecture of Chicago, where Veblen was teaching at the university.\n\nReaders today appreciate Veblen’s humor, catching his style as parody of the writing of what he called “the higher learning.” Irony is his tool, irony and repetition. The tone is academic, very formal grammar. The passive voice. In spite of the specificity of his example of conspicuous waste, the language is general and abstract. Only the word “windows” represents a real thing. Only the idiom “as best it may” has a hint of the colloquial.\n\nBoth repetition and irony come into play in his repetition of “pecuniary” and its placement modifying the nouns “excellence” and especially “beauty.” How can anyone miss the irony and humor of “pecuniary beauty”? Putting two incompatible words together is Veblen’s favorite device of ironic incongruity. A sociologist writes “normative orientation,” which is merely pompous. Veblen goes a step further and writes “aesthetic nausea” and “honorific waste” and “invidious distinction.” The latter is such a commonly accepted phrase today that we don’t realize Veblen was talking about honor, not the difference between two terms. His use of “pecuniary” plays on the denotation money and the denotation greed. One senses Veblen’s glee when he nails the sentence down with “pecuniary beauty.”\n\nJAMES AGEE: The Paralytic Sentence\n\nIn this sentence, the writer is struggling to write what he believes is ultimately inexpressible. He is at his wit’s end to do justice in words of an experience of overwhelming poignancy. Even though he is an accomplished poet and his partner is an outstanding photographer, he feels that their project, describing the lives of Alabama sharecroppers, would inevitably fail. The book found no market; I bought my copy the year it was published and quickly remaindered for a dollar. It is my most precious book. I am mystified remembering that one of my students told me he was going to burn the book when the class was over. Now it’s a classic book on the shelves of the Library of American Literature.\n\nOur sentence is a desperate attempt to express Agee’s sense of failure. The chapter from which I chose the sentence is named “Colon,” an introduction to the microscopic examination of the hopelessly impoverished daily lives of three families, a painful attempt to explain how difficult it will be in view of the infinitely complex situation in which the individual sharecropper passes his existence. How, he asks in the chapter, can words written “only one word at a time” and “as if all in one sentence” be made to “yield it out that all strikes inward upon this center at once and in all its intersections and in the meaning of interrelations and inter-enhancements?” The difficulty paralyzes.\n\nThe way he writes the sentence symbolizes the paralysis:\n\nHere at a center is a creature: It would be our business to show how through every day of every year of his existence alive he is from all sides streamed in upon, bombarded, pierced, destroyed by that enormous sleeting of all objects forms and ghosts how great how small no matter, which surround and which his senses take: in as great and perfect and exact particularity as we can name them.\n\nWe must assume that he knew the strange shape of the sentence, that he deliberately wrote a paralyzed sentence. It begins in a state of tension and uncertainty when he chooses the words “would be our business” rather than “will be.” It would be – if – if it were possible. And his doubt becomes the reader’s. Then he specifies the every-ness of time, superfluously, that his creature’s “existence alive” (Does he have a dead existence as well?) is to be his focus, the individual human being subjected to the “sleeting” of everything in his world. The grammatical status of “sleeting” seems slightly obscure, but Agee proceeds to the quite unusual “how great how small no matter” and the curiously ungrammatical “which surround and whom his senses take.” The only way I can help make this clause grammatical is to insert the word “him” pointing to the antecedent “he,” but then I’m left with “and whom his senses take” and I’m stumped. If you can parse it, let me know.\n\nWith these anomalies, can we give the sentence a pass? I prefer to call it paralyzed and therefore symbolic of Agee’s mental state as he prepares to express the inexpressible. Were the “flaws” intentional? Intentionally writing a bad sentence seems too perverse. Agee was taking a great risk writing a paralyzed sentence. I grant him that privilege. I grant him also the privilege of using colons after “creature” and “take” instead of a period and a comma respectively.\n\nSTEPHEN JAY GOULD: The Periodic Sentence\n\nThe late Stephen Jay Gould was a highly awarded paleontologist professor at Harvard, many of whose publications were in popular science. His writings for Natural History magazine were first class in both style and content.\n\nIf we sensibly consider the limitations of memory and the limitations of the reader’s knowledge and patience, writers must avoid overloading the space between the first and last word of a sentence. The writer’s limits are infinite; he can write infinitely before putting down a period. The reader’s bites of input, like the hard disc’s bytes, can be compressed.\n\nOur sentence from Gould’s Eight Little Piggies (1993) is compressive.\n\nProgress as a predictable result of ordered causes there becomes a double delusion – first because we must seek its cause more in the quirkiness of the wheel, turning tires into sandals and big brains toward fear of death, than in the plodding predictability of the wedge, propelling monkeys into men; and secondly because the supposed sweep of life toward progress only records our myopic focus on the right tail of a distribution whose mode has never moved from a prokaryotic cell.\n\nThis sentence is compressive. It is an extremely well made summary sentence that has compressed two chapters of Eight Little Piggies. Only the reader who has paid attention to Gould’s discussion, a subtly argued put-down of the notion that evolution necessarily means progress, can possibly follow this compression. Many sentences this long are easy to comprehend because the writer demonstrates by its structure how his mind is moving: making a general assertion, then modifying it in a phrase, then adding an incidental thought, then listing descriptive examples, then repeating something for emphasis, then concluding with some strong syllables to show he is taking a breath. This kind of sentence is sometimes referred to as a loose sentence. Some rhetoricians claim that a loose sentence shows a man thinking. The suggestion is that the writer doesn’t know his thought until he has composed the sentence.\n\nThis contrasts with the periodic sentence, which supposedly expresses the completed thought that the writer knew before he put the words together. Whether these options are true is arguable, but the distinction is ancient and useful. Gould’s sentence, at any rate, is definitely periodic and we can be sure he formed his thought before he put these words down. We note that “double” becomes “first” and “secondly,” the major divisions in his design. Next we see that the “first” also has two parts, the “more in” and the “than in.” Each part of this comparison is fleshed out with parallel “‑ings.” The second major division proceeds with the guideposts of “supposed” and “only” and “myopic,” all of these words signaling the faulty evidence of progress, and “never” conclusively refuting any argument. This architecture of the sentence is orderly, clear, and strong. Less compression would have made it easier for a reader not versed in discussing this subject to understand.\n\nThe compression in the sentence is accomplished by the allusions and metaphors that fill out the design, each of them succinctly expressing a significant idea in the discussion of evolution, some of the metaphors Darwin’s own. Even in scientific writing, the poetic metaphor makes a good and efficient sentence more readable when compression is necessary. The big bite of information in this sentence I won’t chew over here; it is fully decompressed in Gould’s chapters “Wheels and Wedges” and “Tires to Sandals.”\n\nWILLIAM GIBSON: The Triple Ambiguity Sentence\n\nMuch of the autobiography from which this sentence is taken is as confessional and painful as this, the introspective description of the author’s family and his tension in recording their lives. The book is A Mass for the Dead, by William Gibson, the story of his ancestors. Gibson was a poet and playwright (“The Miracle Worker”) whose sixty-four year marriage to a psychoanalyst may account for the tenor of this work.\n\nIn every deed they saw me choose to divest myself of semblance to them, until on his deathbed my father with his eyes on the son he had created to perpetuate him – young sloven in his twenties, who had quit church, quit college, quit jobs, quit his family for communists, quit communists for a bride, quit his bride for a mistress, and came from writing on a fraudulent stipend of public relief checks in a tenement such as my parents had put behind them a generation ago – in fact failed to recognize me.\n\nThe sentence is a flash of the writer’s memory coinciding with a flash from the father’s slow death, an ironic reversal in which the life flashing before the eye is the writer’s life and the death is the father’s. It is not clear from the context whether the father’s failure to recognize the son is because the father is too far gone to recognize anyone or because the son is and has been an unrecognizable person in his eyes – or in the son’s own eyes. I assume the triple ambiguity is intentional. The dominant meaning, if we consider the way the son writes the sentence, is the son’s confession. Even if my father were completely conscious he would not recognize this failure, this quitter, this fraud, as the son he loved. “Recognize” is the joker in this deck.\n\nThe sentence incorporates the writer’s perspective at several times in his life, first generally “in every deed” during his life, then in the moment’s situation at the father’s bed, then in his many experiences of quitting, and then in the “fraudulent” attempt to be a writer. Finally comes the writer’s realization of the irony, which fuses all the moments and periods in on one flash, the perfect conclusion for the sentence.\n\nThat one single sentence manages to integrate many time perspectives with this writer’s skill and also acts as a dramatic illustration of the genius of our English grammar that can manage such manipulation of time in one simple past tense.\n\nI want to analyze another ambiguous sentence because ambiguity is such an important element of language. The sentence is not from a literary source. I saw it this morning on a jar of strawberry jam.\n\nWith a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good.\n\nThe slogan was created by an advertising executive, Lois Wyse, in 1962. Wyse wrote sixty-five books, including Funny, You Don’t Look Like A Grandmother, which was on The New York Times best seller list, and made into a musical. (With a name like Lois Wyse . . .)\n\nWhen I first saw this sentence, I noticed its ambiguity, two meanings. First, it meant that Smucker is the name of a company with the reputation of making good jam and that I should buy their jam rather than a jam without the fine reputation. Smucker’s is good jam. With this meaning, the slogan could be used by any company: With a name like Kodak . . . With a name like Ford . . . With a name like General Electric. . . .\n\nThe other meaning I got is that Smucker is such a goofy name that the company had to compensate for it by making extra good jam. I Googled the slogan and found a small opinion poll asking people what the slogan means to them. The respondents all said that it meant Smucker’s is good jam. But the word Smucker itself meant either of two things: goofy name or reputable name, the respondents were about evenly divided. One of the respondents made a translation: With a name like Dog-Poop, it must be good.\n\nThe company knows the slogan is ambiguous: “Initially it referred to the unusual name with the connotation that since it was such an odd name the company had better produce outstanding products. As the company’s reputation has grown and the name Smucker has become associate with high-quality products, the slogan meaning changed somewhat. According to customers, if you see the Smucker name on a product, you have assurance that the product will be good.”\n\nNotice that the company uses the term “will be” and loses the force of the powerful idiom “has to.” I discovered in Google that when the original immigrant, Christian Schmucker, came to America from Switzerland in 1762 he kept the unfortunate name Schmucker. His great grandson David changed it to Smoker, but his son, Jerome, who founded the company, changed it to Smucker because it was more fitting for a conservative family. David Schmucker must have known the Yiddish term Schmuck, meaning fool, jerk, or asshole, is derived from the word for penis.\n\nWILLIAM ALEXANDER PERCY: The Flooded Sentence\n\nA flood is nature’s largest phenomenon in many respects. The flood of the Mississippi in 1927 was monstrous. Scientists describing flood size depended on physical measurement: 50 feet above the levees, 27,000 square miles, etc. The synonyms for large that have been called upon to suggest its size – colossal, gigantic, massive, and so on – leave the reader unimpressed. It takes a sentence to make a flood:\n\nThe 1927 flood was a torrent ten feet deep the size of Rhode Island: it was thirty-six hours coming and four months going; it was deep enough to drown a man, swift enough to upset a boat, and lasting enough to cancel a crop year.\n\nWilliam Alexander Percy, a poet and gentleman planter, was chairman of the Flood Relief Committee and the Red Cross for Mississippi. The flood was the most colossal event in his genteel way of life. It hit him hard, as it hit the hundreds of thousands of black farmers who became refugee campers during the flood and later swelled the Great Migration to the north. That flood was all-consuming.\n\nI consider the words a sentence, even though it makes three independent predications or statements. If a writer separates predications with semicolons, he doesn’t want us mentally to drop our pitch and then pause for a breath as if we have come to a period, but rather to gather all the words in one bite.\n\nThe sentence opens the chapter called “The Flood of 1927” in Percy’s Lanterns on the Levee: Recollections of a Planter’s Son. How does a writer specify the dimensions of “the greatest flood in American history” (Not really true) in one sentence? In the first predication he gives us one word from his list of synonyms for large: “torrent,” which, of course, is a synonym for flood and suggests both “horror” and “terror.” Wise choice. Also he picks number terms for size and, in the second predication, duration. Duration suggests the slow or fast onset depending on one’s engagement with the flood, and then the lingering departure and release, suggesting the human suffering that had to be endured.\n\nThe final predication gets to the point of the chapter, the significance of the flood to Percy, director of flood relief. If George Bush had had a director of flood relief in the Katrina flood of New Orleans as humane and capable as Percy, his ratings would not have sunk so low. Proper to his role in the flood, Percy makes his point with telling understatement. “Enough” is just the right estimate of the amount and kind of damage caused in three dimensions. Three “enoughs” suggests that the flood had any additional number of dimensions.\n\nPercy’s “Flood of 1927” is a worthy complement to William Faulkner’s 1927 flood story “Old Man,” written from the perspective of a convict rather than an aristocratic poet.\n\nLOUIS SULLIVAN: The Apostrophic Sentence\n\nSullivan’s Autobiography of an Idea traces his life as a developing architect, his education, training, and goal as an architect. He arrives at the “Idea” at the end of the book: form follows function. He saw himself as an artist and his idea as the artist’s guiding principal. Our sentence, windy and orotund, is what classically is known as an apostrophe, a salute to a dead hero. It was Michelangelo, the supreme artist he saw as his spiritual mentor.\n\nThe man, the man of super-power, the glorified man of whom he prophesied in his childhood, as he watched his big, strong men build stone walls, hew down trees, drive huge horses – his mighty men, his heroes, his demi-gods, a powerful presentiment which he had seen and felt in the glory of the sunrise; which he had heard in the voice of spring; and which, personified through the haze of most mystical romantic trances, he had faith in – that faith which is near its source and secure.\n\nTry to ignore the grandiloquent style of the sentence and appreciate the eager, blooming young man Sullivan remembers through his romantic trance in his old age. In 1879 at age twenty-two, he was in Paris getting educated. He knew he wanted to become an architect, but he wasn’t sure he could be a true artist as an architect. Do I have an eye for the beautiful? He was determined to know that he had the proper eye. He had read in the work of the great critic Hippolyte Taine that Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling was a masterpiece but that the Last Judgment “was obviously done on momentum, as compared with the vigor of the ceiling.” He had to find out, so he went to Rome to check his own eye with that of Taine. “It was easy – oh, so easy!” He spent two days in the Sistine Chapel “in a supreme moment of relief.” Now, at the very end of his life, he was writing about the founding moment of his career.\n\nThis sentence has no main verb. I call it a sentence because that’s the way he wrote it. No predication. But it ends with a period. The apostrophe could have ended with an apostrophe mark. Taken out of the context of Sullivan’s life, the words are a fulsome, romantic indulgence that would be dismissed immediately by a modern editor. At the same time Sullivan wrote this, Harold Ross was about to launch The New Yorker, “not for the old lady from Topeka.” I am convinced that the tone of the sentence is not out of keeping with Sullivan’s purpose, remembering the ecstasy of his youth. Why not indulge extravagantly in these exclamations? Why not write an old fashioned apostrophe to his hero Michelangelo?\n\nBy its nature an apostrophe is repetitious, a series of phrases, each one expanding tone and content of the previous one. Keeping the form of the apostrophe, he conveys a synopsis of his youthful aspirations. First he salutes Michelangelo of his childish dreams, who is personified in the working men he had idolized as he watched them change the landscape of Boston with their big muscles. He sees them now through the imagery of Walt Whitman in a romantic trance as a presentiment of the future, which he had faith in.\n\nWas Sullivan completely naive when he wrote his autobiography? What was his self-knowledge? He knew that his epiphany in the Sistine Chapel was a romantic trance. He knew that being in the very presence of his hero’s masterpiece was real: he was at the source of his faith in himself. Again the last word is fittingly conclusive. He is “secure” in his career as an architect. The sentence has given us an intimate view of a crucial moment in the revolution of architecture that Louis Sullivan was central in creating.\n\nEUDORA WELTY: The Words Upon Words Sentence\n\nBefore looking at this sentence, we should look at another one from the same book, One Writer’s Beginnings (1983) by Eudora Welty, one of the great American short story writers (in that good old Library of American Literature): “Learning Latin (once I was free of Caesar) fed my love for words upon words, words in continuation and modification, and the beautiful, sober accretion of a sentence.” What better definition of a sentence – words upon words, accretion.\n\nSo a sentence builds on some beginning words. Linguists may argue about where a sentence begins, but we can sensibly accept the idea that the sentence begins somewhere in the completed, accretive sentence. I call it the kernel, the simple elements of the declarative sentence that the final sentence is built upon:\n\nIn “the library,” inside the mission-style bookcase with its three diamond-latticed glass doors, with my father’s Morris chair and the glass-shaded lamp on its table beside it, were books I could soon begin on – and I did, reading them all alike and as they came, straight down their rows, top shelf to bottom.\n\nIn Welty’s sentence, the kernel would be “Books are in the library.” The elements are the subject, the verb, and for the verb in this sentence the necessary adverb phrase. Before we find words upon words, these elements are transformed so that the adverb phrase comes first. Why did Welty write it that way? “Books (that) I could begin on” would be rather incomprehensible and surely less focused than the way she did it.\n\nWhen Welty said “words in continuation and modification,” she was speaking of what grammarians call coordination and subordination. All of her accretions except two are subordinate elements, elements that modify others, that make specifications about others. The other two are coordinate elements following “and.”\n\nEach modifier answers a specific question:\n\nWhere in the library? Inside the bookcase.\n\nWhat style of bookcase? Mission style.\n\nHow is the bookcase designed? With doors.\n\nWhat are the doors made of? Glass.\n\nHow are the doors designed? With lattices.\n\nWhat shape are the lattices? Diamond.\n\nHow many doors are there? Three.\n\nWhat things are near the bookcase? A chair and a table.\n\nAnd so on – a lot of modifiers in this typical sentence. A single sentence may carry an infinite number of modifiers. Another modifier can always be added. The final major element in her sentence, the continuation or coordinating element following a dash, is an interesting stylistic variation. The dash is like a pause before something she wants to emphasize. The “did” is especially emphatic, like “I DID begin on them.” The sentence ends with the image of the girlish Eudora picking up one book after another indiscriminately and reading until she finished the entire collection. One can imagine her gulping down accretion after accretion, marveling at how they formed beautiful paragraphs and books.\n\nAMIRI BARAKA: The Comma Fault Sentence\n\nSome English teachers and even some editors would correct the next sentence because of a glaring error. The error is called “comma fault” and means that two complete sentences have been separated by a comma instead of a period. So what? One could easily find hundreds of comma faults in works by esteemed writers. There must be some good reason for writers to commit comma faults. A reputable writer does not publish glaring errors unless he has been victimized by a copy editor. His decision to write a comma fault is deliberate.\n\nBlues means a Negro experience, it is the one music the Negro made that could not be transferred into a more general significance than the Negro gave it initially.\n\nWhere Baraka chooses a comma, he might have chosen one of four other marks of punctuation, a colon, a semicolon, a dash, or a period. Or nothing, a “run-on” fault. So he had six choices and he took the comma. I believe he saw six possible different meanings among these choices. Baraka is a poet and I assume that he makes very fine discriminations in meanings. But what meaning is the reader supposed to get? The readers of his book, Blues People: The Negro Experience in White America and the Music that Developed From It, may not have the fine discrimination he has.\n\nLet me say what I get. Keeping in mind his title for the book, I see a people who are like no other; in White America they have an emotional life that they call “blues.” In White America, no other people have that life. Out of that life, they developed an emotional music they also called “blues.” The life and the music have the same quality. The comma expresses that sameness, it links the life and the music inseparably. A comma maintains that link. (Notice that I just used the comma fault for about the same reason.) A period would separate them. It would make the first part of the sentence a definition of “blues.” But Baraka says they can’t be separated in any good definition of “blues.” A period would be wrong.\n\nIn British English, a period is called a “full stop.” An accurate term logically, phonetically, grammatically. The sentence is over with. It broke off. It’s finished. A period in Baraka’s sentence would mean to me that the White World “without a Negro experience” can “transfer” the music into a “general significance.” No indelible link between Negro blues life and Negro blues music. I see a subtle meaning of the comma. On the street, it would be expressed directly: White man can’t sing the blues. That comma fault is not only racially controversial; it neatly raises the whole problem of black identity. Baraka’s book is essentially about that.\n\nW. H. AUDEN: The Conjunction Sentence\n\nTwo ways of setting up words in a series concern the word “and.” It’s a subtle point. Let me illustrate with a simple example. Compare these two sentences:\n\nWright built many buildings, churches, banks, houses, and hotels.\n\nWright built many buildings, churches, banks, houses, hotels.\n\nRead them aloud and you’ll hear that “hotels” has a different sound in the two sentences. With “and” the sentence has a concluding tone: Wright built four kinds of buildings, no more. But without the “and,” the concluding tone suggests that he built more than four kinds, any number more.\n\nThe sentence by W. H. Auden is much more complex: two different series are different in length, a series of single words in the first and nouns with modifiers in the second. The first does not use “and,” but the second does. The sentence preceding provides context for ours:\n\nThe frightful falsehood which obsessed the"
