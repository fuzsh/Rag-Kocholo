        "text": "Ivujivik, named after the piles of ice that stack along the shore, is Nunavik, QC’s most northern village. Built on a sandy cove, the surrounding landscape is dominated by massive granite cliffs that dramatically drop into the turbulent waters of Digges Sound where the forceful currents of Hudson Bay meet the Hudson Strait. The nearby East Digges Island and Cape Wolstenhome are noted ecological sites for their large colonies of Thick-billed Murres.\n\nRich in plant and animal life—locals are familiar with occasional polar bear warnings shared on Facebook—Ivujivik winters are extremely cold, which can impede transportation in and out of the village, but rarely stops the local hunters.\n\nIvujivik has an important sculptural legacy, which includes artists such as Simon Luuku and Tivi Paningayak. While early carvings were mostly created out of steatite—which has become more difficult to source—many sculptors, such as Mattiusi Iyaituk, experiment with a variety of stones, including serpentine, sandstone and granite. Iyaituk, who, early in his career was influenced by the work of his brother Nutaraluk Iyaituk (1943–2005), is well known for his highly stylized abstract style, depicting visual representations of his personal experiences and observations.\n\nIn May 2017, artists Passa Mangiuk, Qumaq M. Iyaituk and Mary Paningajak worked with Lyne Bastien in her home studio to get trained on linocut printing, which led to Convergence North/South, a 2019 group exhibition of their work at Feheley Fine Arts in Toronto, ON. For the past decade, members of the community have been advocating for a dedicated arts space that would serve not just Ivujivik, but other nearby communities who come to the village for training in disciplines such as drawing and printmaking. Until the project comes to fruition, Paningajak’s home serves partly as a printmaking studio, and she also facilitates workshops through the local Nuvviti school. The hope is that a proper facility would also help revitalize and educate younger generations.\n\nDigital art and graphic design is an emerging discipline in Ivujivik, thanks to Nuvviti Director Thomassie Mangiok, whose company, Pirnoma Technologies, promotes Inuktitut language resurgence through films, apps, comics and colourful animations inspired by Japanese manga and other popular styles. The community’s current mayor, Adamie Qalingo, also serves as President of the Board of Directors for Théâtre Aaqsiiq, a theatre company working regionwide to offer training to local youth and to create Inuktitut-language plays based on stories from Nunavik and its people.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Mary Paningajak of Ivujivik, Nunavik, QC, and Avataq Cultural Institute in 2023.\n\nThe hamlet of Ikaahuk, meaning “where you go across to”, is located on the southwestern tip of Banks Island in the Western Arctic. The only permanent settlement on the island, Ikaahuk is home to approximately 100 residents and headquarters of Aulavik National Park, located on the northern end of the island. The park is famous for having the highest concentration of muskoxen on earth–an important link to artmaking in the community where hats, scarves, mittens and other items are created from qiviuq or the wool of the soft undercoat of the musk ox. Artists such as Lena Wolki and Tanis 'Akutuq' Simpson are renowned for their work with the material.\n\nClothing made from furs is also an important artistic activity in the community. Warm down parkas and beautifully crafted kamngit and slippers featuring wolf, polar bear and fox fur are staples, and nod to the community’s history as a major trapping community for Arctic fox in the 1960s and 70s. Artists known for their detailed textile works include Beverly Amos, Sharan Green, Edith and Betty Haogak, Jean Harry and Agnes Nasogaluak.\n\nThe White Fox Jamboree is held each May, an opportunity for community members to gather to celebrate the return of spring with traditional activities and food and a break from the long, cold winters Ikaahuk is known for.\n\nThis profile was authored by Tusaayaksat Magazine (Tyanna Bain and Jason Lau) and the IAQ, and created in collaboration with Bambi Amos of Ikaahuk, Inuvialuit Settlement Region, NT, in 2023.\n\nKnown as a major hub for Inuit art-making, Kinngait (Cape Dorset), NU, is located on Dorset Island, at the southern tip of Qikiqtaaluk (Baffin Island), and is named for its mountainous terrain (Kinngait meaning “place of the large mountains”).\n\nThe community has been operating printmaking programs since the late 50s and releasing an annual collection of prints since 1959. The Kenojuak Cultural Centre and Print Studio, opened in 2018, now houses the print studio and dedicated space for sculpture-buying, as well as exhibition, workshop and gathering spaces.\n\nKinngait’s natural surroundings are often the subject of art produced in the community. Iconic prints by Kenojuak Ashevak (1927–2013) CC, ONu, RCA regularly depict local fauna (particularly birds), and have become recognizable across the world. Mary Pudlat (1923–2001), Aqjangajuk Shaa (1937–2019) and Pauta Saila (1916–2009) also drew inspiration from animal life, and contemporary sculptors Ashevak Adla and Samonie Shaa are known for their bears, birds and walruses. Kinngait has also produced notable women sculptors including Ovilu Tunnillie, RCA (1949–2014), Goota Ashoona and Ning Ashoona.\n\nA fascination with documentation has been a strong current throughout the community’s history—from Peter Pitseolak (1902–1973)’s early photographs to Pudlo Pudlat’s (1916–1992) depictions of modern technologies, to Tim Pitsiulak’s (1967–2016) drawings and Jamasee Pitseolak’s sculptures of vehicles.\n\nKinngait drawing practices are renowned, and artists such as Pitseolak Ashoona, CM, RCA (c. 1904–1983), Napachie Pootoogook (1938–2002) and Annie Pootoogook (1969–2016) were prolific makers of largely autobiographical drawings. Works by Ningiukulu Teevee, Ooloosie Saila and Shuvinai Ashoona continue to garner recognition.\n\nTraditional sewing—including purses, kamiit, parkas, amautiit—has been a part of Kinngait’s artistic production for generations. Artists such as Annie Manning, CM, and Annie Manning Lampron are recognized for their doll-making and work in educating young sewists.\n\nMany well-known artists have achieved acclaim for their work in multiple media: including Jutai Toonoo (1959–2015), Qaunaq Mikkigak (1932–2020) and Lukta Qiatsuk (1928–2004). Many other Kinngait artists who have become known for their sculptures, printmaking, or drawings also work adeptly in other forms.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Nakasuk Alariaq of Kinngait, NU, in 2023.\n\nKangiqsujuaq is one of the 14 communities located on the Hudson Strait in Nunavik, QC, and the meaning of its name is “large bay.” Kangiqsujuaq is in a valley surrounded by mountains and hills, which are some of the highest in Nunavik. The community is known for its rich seafood and the cultural activities that surround it. During the winter, people engage in mussel picking under the ice during low tide, which has garnered attention from around the world. Throughout the summer the community boat is used to scrape the sea floor for scallops, sea urchins and starfish. In the fall, the Harvest Time Music Festival is a time to celebrate the bounty.\n\nNotably, the municipality is responsible for the Qajartalik petroglyph site from the Pre-Inuit Tuniit (Dorset) culture (2400-900 years old). Located on an island 40 km offshore, it is on the short-list to be considered for UNESCO Heritage Status. Qajartalik is the only known Dorset rock art site in the Arctic, with over 180 faces carved into a stone outcrop.\n\nIn Kangiqsujuaq, artists such as Mark Tertiluk, Jobie Arnaituk, Pitsiulaq Pinguatuk and Johny Pilurtuut (1928-1996) are known for their sculptural work. Striking photography comes from the region, such as the works of Yaaka Jaaka, and Kangiqsujuaq was also the home of writer Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk (1931-2007) author of Sanaaq (1984), considered the first Inuktitut language novel of all time. Painter Ulaayu Pilurtuut who designed a special issue five-dollar coin for the Royal Canadian Mint is also a well-known artist in the community.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Mary Pilurtuut of Kangiqsujuaq, Nunavik, QC in 2023.\n\nSalluit, Nunavik, QC, is the second most northern community in Nunavik, located on the Hudson Strait between the Ungava and Hudson Bays with a population of approximately 1600 people. Its name means “the thin ones,” a reference to a long ago period of starvation in the area. While fish are today plentiful in the area all year round, the water is known for being dangerous and rough.\n\nThe community has a strong desire to honour cultural traditions, visible through a number of local activities including a very active sewing group which works from a sewing centre in town, traditional dance lessons held during winter holidays and a local radio station with a strict Inuktitut-only language policy. Salluit’s Inuktitut musical scene is well developed, with an annual music festival that attracts singers from across Inuit Nunaat to perform each summer, and several famous town musicians, including the band Sugluk, led by singer George Kakayuk and guitarist Tayara Papigatuk, and Elisapie Isaac, who sang with Sugluk in her youth before going on to become famous in her own right.\n\nThere is public art located all around the community, including in hospitals, the church, local offices and the airport, which features a large bird sculpture by young sculptor Benjamin Isaac. Sculpture was the community’s artistic mainstay for many years, nurturing well-known artists like Tivi Illisituk, Sammy Kaitak (1926-2004) and Johnny Issaja Papigatok. Today, painting is growing rapidly as a favourite among local artists including Louisa Payungie, as well as graphic art by artists such as Putulik Ilisituk, who also serves as the local radio announcer.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Charlie Pinguartuq of Salluit, Nunavik, QC, in 2023.\n\nTasiujaq, Nunavik, QC, is located near the Ungava Bay, between Kuujjuaq and Aupaluk. The name of the community, meaning “lake-like”, comes from the small bay nearby. Established in the mid-1960s, the current location of the hamlet was chosen to support a growing population that was initially located on the other side of the bay in Tasiujatuqaq, where the Hudson’s Bay Company and the Révillon Frères French fur trading company had built trading posts at the turn of the 20th century. Tasiujaq is known for having the highest tide and the lowest tide in the world, and features a landscape characterized by many rolling hills in the area.\n\nThe community of Tasiujaq is culture-oriented and is today focused on reclaiming and promoting their culture. An ongoing project is the creation of an online virtual space named Piqalujaq Culture Committee which provides visitors with information about the community and promotes community events for youth, adults and Elders.\n\nArtists in Tasiujaq are known for creating beautiful parkas, snow pants, sealskin boots and jewelry. Printmakers like Cecilia Angatuk, who took part in the exhibition Revival: Printmaking in Nunavik 2014-2019 at the Musée d’Art de Joliette in 2021, are also creating new and innovative works. Community members established the Tasiujaq Cooperative Association in 1971 and in 2004 joined the Fédération des coopératives du Nouveau-Québec—the last Nunavik cooperative to join.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Mary Cain of Tasiujaq, Nunavik, QC in 2023.\n\n“Beautfiul little inlet,” is the English translation of Kangiqtugaapik (Clyde River), NU, a community of just over 1000 located in Patricia Bay on the northeast shore of Baffin Island. Surrounded by the dramatic landscape of Kangiqtugaapik Uqquqti, or Sam Ford Fjord, the area boasts a sheer cliff measuring approximately 1500 meters tall, well known among rock climbers and BASE jumpers around the globe. Kangiqtugaapik is home to Piqqusilirvvik, Nunavut’s only cultural learning centre, as well as Illaqsivik, a community centre that has programs for all community members, from prenatal care for mothers and infants to elders.\n\nHistorically the community has had robust sculpting activity, with many artists working with stone and antler. Through the years, notable sculptors have included Solomonie Tigullaraq (1924–2000), Simionee Qayaq (1920–1971) and Atiana Iqalukjuak (1914–1990), as well as Tommy Kunilussie and Mosha Arnakuk, who are both working with antler today.\n\nGraphic arts was another popular early medium for a host of artists including Lydia Jaypoody, Nubia Enuaraq (1927–1985) and Elisapee Enuaraq, all of whom were part of the Igutaq Group, an early artist collective. The Igutaq group worked with items historically classified as “craft,” such as doll-making, but also experimented with silk painting as well as screenprint, resulting in the creation of the community’s sole print collection in 1981. Today, a new generation of artists are depicting the dramatic land and abundant wildlife, this time through photography: Kangiqtugaapik’s celebrated photographers Robert Kautuk and Niore Iqalukjuak are both well known for documenting the land and animals around them.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with David Saila Qayaq of Kangiqtugaapik (Clyde River), NU, in 2023.\n\nLocated on the southeast of Baffin Island in the Pangnirtung Fjord, Panniqtuuq (Pangnirtung), NU, is a community bursting with art. Panniqtuuq, whose name translates to “land of the bull caribou,” is known for its turbot fishery as well as the Uqqurmuit Centre for Arts and Crafts, which has the distinction of being one of only four places in the world where unique contemporary tapestries are made by skilled artists like Kawtysie Kakee, Eena Angmarlik and Madeline Maniapik. Their tapestries can be found on display throughout the town, most notably at the airport.\n\nUqqurmuit also plays host to a printmaking studio, and a strong community of graphic artists who supply their drawings for use to both the printmakers and tapestry artists, as well as partaking in printmaking themselves as part of the community’s print program, which was released between 1973 and 2010, with a special release in 2018. Artists like Andrew Qappik, Joel Maniapik and Elisapie Ishulutaq (1925–2018) have made the landscape of Panniqtuuq famous, often depicting recognizable landmarks in their works.\n\nDespite limited access to materials, there are artists working in other mediums: Jaco Ishulutaq is one of the community’s most prolific and celebrated sculptors working in stone, and the town boasts a number of musicians like Tim Evic, Riit, Aasiva, Miali and Joey Nauyuk. Husband and wife team Alex Kilabuk and Annie Akulukjuk Kilabuk are also known in Panniqtuuq and beyond for their accessories and jewellery.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Henry Mike of Panniqtuuq (Pangnirtung), NU, in 2023.\n\nInuuvik, roughly meaning “the place of man” in Inuvialuktun, is the largest of six hamlets in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. Before its naming by Elder Ovin/Owen Allen, Inuuvik was previously known as “East Three”, because there were three potential locations for Inuvialuit from Aktlarvik (Aklavik) during their search for higher ground to avoid seasonal flooding.\n\nA major hub of connection between all six Inuvialuit hamlets, the town of Inuuvik is a centre of artistic diversity, as well as cultural revitalization. The Inuuvik Community Corporation is home to the Brighter Futures Program, where weekly sewing and Inuvialuktun language classes take place, as well as cultural activities such as Northern Games practices and Elders’ camps. The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation Craft Shop and Inuvialuit Cultural Resource Centre are also important spaces for cultural production and exchange.\n\nElder Brian Rogers (Nungkii) is a particularly esteemed seamster from Inuuvik who not only sews hats, mitts, maklaks, and atigis (parkas), but regularly mentors younger artists as a sewing class instructor. Nungkii is a major player in the continued revitalization of traditional Inuvialuit sewings, passing down patterns and knowledge to his students while cultivating a thriving sewing community. Other notable artists from Inuuvik include beader Jessie Colton and her mother Mary Kaglik, another notable Inuvialuk seamstress, as well as painters Brian Kowikchuk and Penny Chase, sculptor John Taylor, jeweller Erica Joan Donovan and filmmaker Jerri Thrasher.\n\nThe town of Inuuvik is best known for The Great Northern Arts Festival every summer, which takes place at the local Midnight Sun Recreation Complex and brings together artists and performers from across the North, as well as annual celebrations marking Inuvialuit Day and National Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\nThis profile was authored by Tusaayaksat Magazine (Tyanna Bain and Jason Lau) and the IAQ, and created in collaboration with Brian (Nungkii) Rogers of Inuuvik, Inuvialuit Settlement Region, NT, in 2023.\n\nLocated on the eastern shore of Tuvaaluk (Diana Bay), near the Ungava Bay the landscape of Quaqtaq is defined by mountains to the north and to the southeast, smaller, rocky hills. Meaning \"tapeworm\" in Inuktitut, the hamlet is one of the northernmost inhabited places in Nunavik.\n\nThe population of approximately 450 is known for its love square dancing during the winter holiday season, hosting an annual New Year’s Eve frozen lunch of aged walrus meat and other country foods at Nuvuk Lake about 10 km away from the town.\n\nArtists from the community are known for their work in textiles and clothing, as well as music. Notable musicians include singer-songwriters George Angnatuk and Beatrice Deer, and a gospel singing group comprised of Johnny Oovaut, Rhoda Ezekiel and Lizzie Niniuruvik. Jaaji (Sunchild Deer-Okpik), one half of award-winning duo Twin Flames was also raised in Quaqtaq.\n\nThe local airport features stone carvings of beluga by Jusipi Kulula displayed in a glass case as well as large metal mesh metal replicas, suspended from the ceiling–a nod to Quaqtaq’s role as a beluga hunting community. And although sculpture is not a central activity in the community today, there is a long history of miniature ivory carvings for trade and community use–a substantial collection of which can be found in the collection of the Avataq Cultural Institute.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Beatrice Deer of Quaqtaq, Nunavik, QC, in 2023.\n\nSituated on the west side of the Mackenzie Delta–Canada's largest freshwater delta–the hamlet of Aktlarvik (Aklavik) is home to approximately 530 residents. The former administrative centre for the region, the community has a long history as a settlement from the early movements of Iñupiat from Alaska who settled in the area in the early 1800s to the establishment of a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in 1912, an important site of the northern fur industry with plentiful caches of muskrat, beaver, fox and lynx furs.\n\nSewing and beading, including with furs, remains a core part of creative life in the community. Local workshops in parka making, for example, are an important aspect of knowledge transfer and learning–ensuring the skills honed over decades by Elders in the community are shared and carried forward by the next generation. Notable visual artists in the community include textile artist Nellie Arey, multimedia artists Danny C. Gordon and Tom Mcleod as well as jewelers Karlyn Blake and Megan Lennie and graphic artist\n\nJessica Malegana.\n\nAklavik is well known for the strength of its drum dancing. Groups such as the Aklavik Delta Drummers and Dancers, one of the three groups that formed out of the regional Mackenzie Delta Drummers and Dancers in 1989, are highly sought after for their work, including notable performances at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Featuring dancers of both Inuvialuit and Gwichin heritage, the group has continued to grow in part through their school program teaching youth from kindergarten to grade nine.\n\nThis profile was authored by Tusaayaksat Magazine (Tyanna Bain and Jason Lau) and the IAQ, and created in collaboration with Renie Arey of Aklavik, Inuvialuit Settlement Region, NT, in 2023.\n\nOne of the southernmost Inuit communities in Nunatsiavut, the Inuttitut name for Rigolet is Kikiak, meaning gathering place. An important local site during fishing season, Rigolet was also deemed a gathering place due to the establishment of the Hudson Bay Company which became a regional hub to trade furs, buy food or other necessities and obtain healthcare.\n\nRigolet has many unique places of interest such as the Net Loft Museum, a registered heritage museum built in 1876. Rigolet is also known for its lengthy wooden boardwalk that extends eight kilometres out from the community to Double Mer Point—the longest wooden boardwalk in North America.\n\nThe community hosts annual festivals including the Rigolet Salmon Festival held every August, while the Tikigiaksaugusik Festival is held every March and includes dog team races, games and the Francis Campbell Memorial Rifle Shoot.\n\nTextiles such as sealskin boots and slippers or saltwater seagrass baskets from the community are prized for their skill and artistry. Access to materials has always been a challenge for artists in the region, prompting them to work with what they could find. Artists like Derrick Pottle began carving at a young age using wood and stone. Today, artists from the region are exploring new mediums, such as Eldred Allen with photography and Tammy Ann Hannaford who creates jewellery out of antlers.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Inez Shiwak of Rigolet, NL, in 2023.\n\nLocated on the west coast of Victoria Island, the hamlet of Ulukhaqtuuq (Ulukhaktok) is well-known for its long history of printmaking and carving, as well as sewing and beading. Surrounded by the Beaufort Sea and named for “the place where material for uluit are found”, in 2006 the community officially changed its name back to Ulukhaqtuuq from Holman Island, a name given to the community by the federal government. The surrounding area is rich in natural resources including copper, stone, alabaster and muskox horns as well as sealskin, wolf pelts and caribou skin–all used in the creation of local artworks.\n\nIn 1961, a local cooperative was established to support economic development in the community as well as artmaking. Today, the Ulukhaktok Arts Centre is highly regarded for its rich printmaking history and the contributions of celebrated graphic artists including Peter Aliknak Banksland (1928–1998), Harry Egotak (1925–2009), Victor Ekootak (1916–1965), Agnes Nanogak Goose (1925–2001), Billy Goose (1943–1989), Helen Kalvak, CM, RCA (1901–1984), William Kagyut, Elsie Klengenberg, Susie Malgokak, Jimmy Memorana (1919–2009), Mary Okheena and Peter Palvik.\n\nSculpture remains an important practice and is prized by visitors to the community. Notable artists include Rex Goose, known for his miniature sculptures and jewellery, and Buddy Natuk who works primarily in horn to create delicate birds. Sewing and textile works from the community are distinct for their embroidery patterns and forms, such as mother hubbard parkas–recognizable throughout the Western Arctic region.\n\nThis profile was authored by Tusaayaksat Magazine (Tyanna Bain and Jason Lau) and the IAQ, and created in collaboration with Laverna Klengenberg of Ulukhaqtuuq (Ulukhaktok), Inuvialuit Settlement Region, NT, in 2023.\n\nThe second most northern community in Canada, Qausuittuq, NU, is located on the southern end of Cornwallis Island, where the island meets the northern shore of Resolute Bay. The area was populated by various peoples as early as 1500 BCE, but Qausuittuq was created as a permanent community in 1953, when the federal government relocated several families from Inukjuak, Nunavik, QC, to Qausuittuq (and Ausuittuq), places with much harsher environments than they were prepared for.\n\nThis harsher environment may be why the relocated Inuit gave the place the name Qausuittuq, which means “the place that never dawns,” recognizing that the area is in complete darkness from November to February, when the community holds a feast to celebrate the return of the sun. Qausuittuq also holds Christmas games to keep people busy during the darkest time of the year. The landscape is predominantly hilly with ample gravel and little plant life; there are several local lakes and a river where people swim when it’s briefly warm, but snow falls in the community from August to June.\n\nAlthough only about 200 people live in Qausuittuq, the community boasts several prominent artists, among them throatsinger and writer Celina Kalluk, illustrator Babah Kalluk and stone sculptors Isaac Naqtai and Alex Patsauq. Likely the best known artist from the area is Simeonie Amagoalik (1933–2011), one of the original relocatees from 1953. Amagoalik was involved in the early negotiations for the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement and carved a large stone monument of a lone man looking towards Ausuittuq, which stands in Qausuittuq today in recognition of the relocation.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Devon Manik of Qausuittuq, NU, in 2023.\n\nLocated on the edge of the boreal forest and the Koksoak River, the largest in the region, is the community Kuujjuaq. Named for the “Great River” in Inuktitut, life in the hamlet of approximately 2,700 residents is oriented to and closely tied to the river and is the largest village in Nunavik. Home to the annual music festival Aqpik Jam, established in 1996 and Nunavik's largest music festival, Kuujjuaq is host to numerous year-round activities, including Ski-Doo races and the annual fishing derby.\n\nNotably, Kuujjuaq is home to Jennie Snowball’s signature ookpik doll. These stuffed sealskin owls with large round eyes would eventually become a Canadian icon, putting Kuujjuaq on the map for an international audience. The financial success of Snowball’s dolls in the early 1960s, gave the community's recently opened co-operative the financial support it needed to build momentum. Today the co-op remains an important part of daily life.\n\nThe community is well-known for its many contemporary performers and storytellers including spoken word artist, curator and writer Taqralik Partridge; performer and playwright Sylvia Cloutier; circus performer Charlie Gordon; and musicians Etua Snowball and Juurini; as well as William Tagoona, a member of The Harpoons, one of the first Inuit rock groups, who settled in Kuujjuaq in the early 1970s from Qamani’tuaq (Baker Lake), NU.\n\nJewellery, graphic arts, photography and painting are also strongly associated with the hamlet today. Notable artists working in and often across these mediums include: Eva Saunders, Hannah Tooktoo, Jennifer La Page, Julie Grenier, Mary Gordon, Niap, Charleen Watt, Dawn Forrest, Janice Parsons Gordon, Sammy Kudluk and Tanya Innaarulik.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Charleen Watt of Kuujjuaq, Nunavik, QC, and Avataq Cultural Institute in 2022.\n\nKangiqliniq, the second-largest settlement in Nunavut (after Iqaluit), is named for its geographic location, a “deep inlet” on the Kudlulik Peninsula. The regional centre for Kivalliq, Kangiqliniq exhibits an active cultural and community life, with hockey, fishing and the annual Pakallak Tyme festival (featuring skidoo races, sculpture contests, singing, dancing and games on the sea ice) as major attractions. Cultural programming organized by community organizations offers opportunities to connect with art and culture—including food and sewing classes, and art and culture camps on the land.\n\nSeveral major economic shifts have informed the community’s artistic identity: the North Rankin Inlet Nickel Mine (1957–62) brought many Inuit off the land, a period of federal work projects in the 1960s (including a ceramics studio) created new working conditions in Kangiqliniq, Inuit-owned businesses gained prominence in the 1970s, and the nearby Meliadine Gold Mine (launched in 2017) has already influenced the creation of new infrastructure.\n\nThe community has been home to notable sculptors and ceramicists including Pierre Aupilardjuk, Patrick Kabluitok, Pierre Karlik (1931–2013), John Kavik (1897–1993), John Kurok and John Tiktak (1916–1981). Kangiqliniq is also developing a reputation for the work of seamstresses and makers of jewelry and accessories. Victoria’s Arctic Fashion, launched by Victoria Kakuktinniq, has become well known for its fusion of traditional parka design with couture details.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Denise Kusugak of Kangiqliniq, NU, in 2023.\n\nA large community with more than 1,800 inhabitants, Inukjuak, Nunavik, QC, is located along the eastern shore of Hudson Bay at the mouth of the Innuksuak River. Although internet sources often claim the community name means “giant,” community members tell two different stories: in one, the name came from a woman named Inukjuak who lived in the area long ago. In the other, a hunting party was arriving at the shore and someone yelled out “Inukjuak, Inukjuak,” meaning “many people,” to call people to greet them. Inukjuak is home to both the iglu-shaped Daniel Weetaluktuk Museum and the head office of the Avataq Cultural Institute.\n\nThe town’s public art includes two large stone monuments, one which celebrates the 1922 film Nanook of the North and one which commemorates the forced relocation of several Inukjuak families to the High Arctic in 1953, designed by Siasi Smiler. There are also two murals in Inukjuak, both created by Sarah Lisa Kasudluak.\n\nCarving and printmaking were the community’s initial claims to artistic fame; early sculptors in the community included Akeeaktashuk (1898-1954), Johnny Inukpuk (1911-2007), Lucassie Echalook, Charlie Inukpuk (1941–2022) and Eli Weetaluktuk (1910-1958), and dollmaker Elisapie Inukpuk, many of whom also released prints in the town’s 1976 print collection. Jewellery makers Laina and Andrew Nulukie, basket maker Anna Ohaituk and parka maker Sara Samisack are local working artists. Inukjuak is also home for the Qimutjuit band and author Markoosie Patsauq (1941-2020), whose book Harpoon of the Hunter (1970) is considered the first English novel written by an Inuk. Other notable artists with ties to Inukjuak today include printmaker Maggie Napartuk, filmmaker Jobie Weetaluktuk and multimedia artist asinnajaq.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Sarah Lisa Kasudluak of Inukjuak, Nunavik, QC, in 2023.\n\nLocated on an peninsula that juts out into Hudson Bay opposite Qikiqtarjuaq, NU, Akulivik, Nunavik, QC, was named for its geography: “akulivik” refers to the central prong of a kakivak, the traditional Inuit fishing spear. Aptly, fishing later became a major industry in the town due to its proximity to the migratory routes of many different types of fish and animals, and the prevalence of these animals in the area has meant that they are often represented in the town’s artwork.\n\nStone carving was the main source of income in the community when it was first incorporated in the late 1970s and early 80s; sculptors like Johnny Kakutuk (1946-2018) worked with steatite on larger pieces during this period. However, due to the difficulty involved in accessing suitable carving stone, sculpture is less prevalent today. Some sculptors like Levi Alashuak and Laly Ammituk are still working with stone on a smaller scale, but many others, like Simon Qinuajuak, have switched to antler and ivory. The antler pieces produced are often necklace pendants, rings and earrings.\n\nThere are multiple murals and paintings on public display around two: one mural outside the local school and two at the nursing clinic were created by Adamie Alaku Anauta (1946-2016) and Henry Qullialu Quissa and the municipal office displays paintings by Makusi Pangutu Anauta. Painting and drawing supplies are still readily available through the local co-op, but few artists in the community are working with painting or graphic art today. Musically, Akulivik is known as the home of Tumassi Quitsaq, a blue-rock singer who released music in the 1990s, as well as Nicolas Pirti-Duplessis, a singer-songwriter working in three languages today.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Eli Angiyou of Akulivik, Nunavik, QC, in 2023.\n\nSituated on the western shore of Ungava Bay, Aupaluk, Nunavik, QC, takes its name from the location’s iron-rich red soil, with a name that translates to “where the earth is red.” It is the least populous community in Nunavik, with approximately 230 residents, and features a mostly flat landscape with local lakes that provide mussel and clam picking opportunities.\n\nDespite the community’s small size, it is full of creativity, with artists working in graphic art, sculpture, clay and jewelry. Ivory and soapstone carving have taken place there for years; sculptor Johnny Akpahatak is particularly well known, having won the Fédération des coopératives du nouveau Québec’s carving contest in 2015 before becoming town mayor. Ellie Partridge is sought after for her bead and clay earrings, and artist Maggie Cain works in a variety of mediums, including printmaking.\n\nThere is also quite a large number of public artworks in the community in addition to the art found in private homes there: the school features a mural by Maggie Akpahatak, and there are sculptures around town created by Annie Akpahatak, Annie Ama and Eva Grey.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Maggie Cain of Aupaluk, Nunavik, QC, in 2023.\n\nLocated on the north coast of Labrador is the town of Makkovik, Nunatsiavut, NL. The hamlet’s name is derived from two Inuttitut words, maggok meaning “two” and vik meaning “place”. The landscape surrounding the community of 400 is defined by its treelined vistas. It is home to the White Elephant Museum, the Makkovik Craft Centre and, annually over four days in August, a trout festival known for its musical performances—a nod to local traditions of guitar, fiddle and accordion, and more recently the work of violinist Kendra Jacque.\n\nThe hamlet is widely regarded for its signature work in coat-making: silipaks (traditional and lightweight) and akuliks (lined and fur trimmed). Dr. Nellie Winters and her daughter Blanche Winters are particularly well-known for their work in this area as well as their teaching and skill sharing initiatives to support the next generation of textile artists.\n\nA massive untitled mural painted by artist Jessica Winters is situated on the side of Frank’s General Store. Created in 2020 with assistance from four local youth interns, the scene depicts marine and other local wildlife against a backdrop of vibrant teals. Adorning the wall at the local museum is a mural by artist Gerald Mitchell Sr. whose paintings and prints can also be found in homes throughout the community.\n\nThe work of photographer James “Uncle Jim” Andersen is also synonymous with the community of Makkovik, laying the groundwork for a rich local practice of image making that is carried forward today by Holly Andersen, Gary Andersen and others.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Joan Andersen of Makkovik, Nunatsiavut, NL, in 2022.\n\nSalliq, meaning “large, flat (island)” in Inuktitut, is both the name for Southampton Island, and its only hamlet, also known as Coral Harbour, NU. Part of the Kivalliq Region, the island is home to abundant wildlife, and known for natural features including steep cliffs, waterfalls and Fossil Creek (named for its fossilized coral), as well as for its many Tuniit archaeological sites.\n\nSewing, doll-making and carving are major artistic activities in the community. While Salliq’s community hall is an important gathering location, there is no dedicated venue for people to sew, carve and create art, and artists primarily work out of their own spaces. Nonetheless, Salliq has developed a distinct style of parka patterns, and boasts a number of well-recognized artists from the region. Renowned artist Pudlo Pudlat (1916–1992) was born at Ilupirlik, a small camp near Amadjuak, NU, but lived in Salliq until he was six years old. Salliq sculptors Daniel Shimout (1972–2022) and Noah Natakok are known for their carvings in stone, bone, antler, horn and ivory, often incorporating materials harvested on the island, and Kupapik Ningeocheak works primarily in stone to create abstract compositions of human and animal figures. Textile artists such as Mona Netser, Helen Ell-Natakok and Elizabeth Ningeongan are known for their skills as doll-makers and seamstresses. Salliq-born, Saskatoon-based jeweller, artist and writer Tarralik Duffy’s work has garnered international acclaim, and was the inaugural recipient of the 2021 Kenojuak Ashevak Memorial Award.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Marlene Watson of Iqaluit, NU, in 2023.\n\nAgvituk, ‘the place of whales’, is located at the midway point along the Labrador Coast. Renamed Hopedale in 1782 by Moravian Missionaries, the community is home to the legislative capital of the Nunatsiavut Government as well as some of oldest wooden-framed buildings in Canada. The Hopedale Mission Complex and Interpretation Centre houses thousands of objects and written materials that provide a first-hand view into the complex and intertwined histories of local Inuit, European missionaries, commerce, religion and culture.\n\nToday the community’s skyline is defined by a radically different structure—the Nunatsiavut Assembly Building. While the 2012 building nods to the architectural style of the mission through its windows and steeple, the Assembly is a decidedly Inuit structure featuring an iglu-shaped front with labradorite and sealskin decorated interiors, the latter an important and ubiquitous material in local artmaking. Like most communities along the Nunatsiavut coast, sewing and textile arts are well represented in Hopedale. Talented seamstresses such as Sarah Jensen and sisters Vanessa and Veronica Flowers work in sealskin, moosehide and furs to create boots, mitts and other wearable artworks. The Flowers, taught by their late grandmother Andrea Flowers, today carry on the skills and expertise needed to undertake the detailed and laborious process to make the black-bottomed sealskin boots (traditional waterproof boots).\n\nSculpture, particularly wood carving, is another distinct practice represented in Hopedale. Known for their delicately carved wooden caribou, the late Chesley Flowers, his son Gilbert Flowers and nephew George Flowers have created numerous miniature herds from soft aspen and caribou antler. Ross Flowers, also a sculptor like his uncle Chesley, also a sculptor works in wood and antler as well as whalebone and stone, and is highly sought-after for his handmade Inuit drums.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Sarah Jensen of Hopedale, Nunatsiavut, NL, in 2023.\n\nThe largest settlement on Victoria Island, Iqaluktuuttiaq (Cambridge Bay), NU, is located on the island’s southeast coast, between the Dease Strait and Queen Maud Gulf. Inuit had used the land for thousands of years as a place to hunt and fish—the community’s name means “where the fish are,”—but the permanent community wasn’t formed until the 20th century. There are three large hills visible from most places in town, the largest of which is Uvajuq (Mount Pelly); community lore states that these hills are what is left of a family of giants that used to roam the earth.\n\nToday, Iqaluktuuttiaq is the largest stop for passenger and research vessels crossing the Northwest Passage and acts as the administrative centre for Nunavut’s Kitikmeot Region; consequently, the community has informational signs posted in town and around the bay that detail the history of the area, as well as a lot of public art. The Canadian High Arctic Research Station in town features a number of textile murals as well as stone sculpture, and the Kiilinik High School Library houses more sculpture as well as a parka display. A popular youth welding program operated through the community’s Red Fish Arts Studio has created a large metalwork welcome sign outside the town and multiple sculptures in town. The studio has made training in many mediums more accessible to local youth since it opened in 2021, with courses in painting, weaving and traditional tool making and other skills.\n\nAmong the town’s celebrated artists are Polaris Prize and Juno award winning throat singer Tanya Tagaq, CM, sculptor Rudi Minilgak, tattooist Jana Angulalik, textile artist Bessie Omilgoetok and sculptor Damien Iquallaq.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Aghalingiak (Zoe Ohokannoak) of Iqaluktuuttiaq (Cambridge Bay), NU, in 2023.\n\nNain is both the northernmost and the largest permanent community in Newfoundland and Labrador, and also serves as the administrative capital of Nunatsiavut. Located on the eastern Labrador coast in Unity Bay, the community is surrounded by trees and mountains, and home to the Illusuak Culture Centre, showcasing the history of the town, and the OKâlaKatiget Society TV and radio station. Nain is one of the oldest permanent Inuit settlements in Canada; it was established in 1771 by Moravian missionaries, and the community continues to celebrate Moravian holidays like Married Couples’ Day and Widows’ Day, and carries on the brass band established a century ago by the missionaries.\n\nThe prevalence of Inuit cultural clothing in the community—Nain’s local garb is often white or beige with brightly coloured beaded or embroidered trimming and a highly decorated hood—has led to a robust community of sewers, men and women, who create their own kamiik, akulet, silapâk and accessories like sealskin mitts and train local youth to sew.\n\nSculptors like John Terriak and Gilbert Hay put Nain on the map for carving, creating detailed stonework pieces. Printmaking had a brief heyday in the community from the late 70’s to early 90’s with Hay, Michael Massie and others picking up the skill and introducing a printing press to the art room at the local high school, but is no longer widely practiced. Artists like Echo Henoche and Eli Merkeratsuk are today working more with painting and sketching, alongside a host of community beaders and sewers like Caitlyn Baikie and Heather Angnatok.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Heather Angnatok of Nain, Nunatsiavut, NL, in 2023.\n\nIgluligaarjuk, meaning “place with a few Thule houses” is so named to acknowledge the thousands of years of Inuit settlement in the region. Located at the mouth of Chesterfield Inlet on the western shore of Hudson Bay in the Kivalliq Region, Igluligaarjuk is the oldest settled community in Nunavut. The landscape surrounding the hamlet is defined by its flatness, with low granite outcrops and inland lakes punctuating the topography. With a population of around 400, the close knit community comes together each April for an annual fishing derby followed by Hamlet days.\n\nStorytelling remains an important part of community life in Igluligaarjuk. In 2015 the local Elder’s committee, the Parnaijiit (Katimajialaangit), launched the Chesterfield Inlet Stories project as a local initiative to gather stories, photos and histories from community members, catalogue locally made objects and “celebrate the spirit and identity of our people to preserve our culture and traditions for generations to come''. Writer and comedian Peter Igupttaq Autut, now based in Iqaluit, NU, was the inaugural winner of the Crackup Iqaluit Comedy Competition and the 2020 winner of the Sally Manning Award for Indigenous Creative Non-Fiction.\n\nSculptors Bertha Sinisiak Aggark whose stone carvings of bulbous musk oxen are recognizable for their diminutive legs and musk ox horn detailing, and Anita Issaluk known for her expressive, abstracted faces. Textile work is alo an important aspect of community artmaking with artists Agatha Alkomaksuitiksa, Majorie Autut and Eva Tanuyak creating colouorful wall hangings and beaded works.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Andre Tautuk of Igluligaarjuk (Chesterfield Inlet), NU, in 2023.\n\nA hamlet of less than 500 people on the western shore of Hudson Bay, Tikirarjuaq, NU, takes its name from the Inuktitut phrase, “long point.” Known for the variety of animals and beauty of the land, the community’s English name, Whale Cove, describes the belugas that pass through the bay every fall. Tikirarjuaq residents hunt and fish, harvesting traditional foods including caribou, seal and beluga whale, and atop a hill overlooking the community stands a monument recognizing the relationship between Tikirarjuaq residents and the sea, in the shape of a whale’s tail.\n\nTikirarjuaq’s population is young, with a majority of residents under 25 years old, and concerns among the community about the loss of Elders and traditional knowledge. There is currently little infrastructure for artistic programming in Tikirarjuaq, though community members organize their own opportunities—such as sled-building workshops or sewing groups—to share knowledge, and Tikirarjuaq seamstress are known for their work producing traditional clothing. Local celebrations including square dances often accompany major holidays and special events (such as hockey or Inuit games). Local artwork is sold at the co-op store, and the community has produced notable carvers such as Alex Alikasuak, who works in stone, antler and bone. Musician Kelly Fraser (1993–2019) was born in Tikirajuaq, and was well-known for her leadership as a songwriter and advocate for Inuit language, culture and youth.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Maxine Angoo of Tikirarjuaq, NU, in 2023.\n\nLocated on the Beaufort Sea in the Western Arctic, the landscape of Tuktuuyaqtuuq (Tuktoyaktuk), Inuvialuit Settlement Region, NT is defined by both flat expanses of coastline and pingos–ice-cored hills. Ibyuk Pingo is the largest of these landforms. It is Canada's tallest and the world's second-tallest pingo, reaching 49 metres in height and 300 metres across at its base.\n\nRecently accessible by land, the community is now connected to the regional centre of Inuuvik by the Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway, opened in 2017. Tuktuuyaqtuuq is named for tuktu (caribou in Inuvialuktun). Meaning “looks like a caribou”, the hamlet is known as a key site for caribou crossings and, at low tide, the rocks that protrude from the Arctic Ocean are said to resemble caribou swimming across the bay.\n\nEach spring, community members gather for the Beluga Jamboree, an annual celebration of square dancing, sled dog races and drumming by The Tuktoyaktuk Saliqmiut Drummers & Dancers. Music and the visual arts, specifically sculpture, are also key artistic practices in the community today. Noted carvers from the community include brothers Joe and Bill Nasogaluak, Angus Cockney and the Inuvialuit Carvers, an artist collective featuring several members of the Taylor family including Derrald Taylor, William Taylor and Priscilla Boulay. Painters Darcie Bernhardt and Brian Kowikchuk are known for their expressive and culturally rooted imagery while multimedia artist Maureen Gruben is celebrated for her contemporary approach using natural and found materials. Textile and fashion design are also important creative outlets for community members. Taalrumiq/Christina King and Elizabeth Arey, among many others, are known for their innovative fashion designs and detailed beadwork.\n\nThis profile was authored by Tusaayaksat Magazine (Tyanna Bain and Jason Lau) and the IAQ, and created in collaboration with Angus Cockney of Tuktuuyaqtuuq (Tuktoyaktuk), Inuvialuit Settlement Region, NT, in 2023.\n\nAusuittuq, NU, whose name means “rarely thaws from a frozen state,” is the northernmost civilian community in Canada, located on the southern tip of Ellesmere Island in the Qikiqtaaluk region of Nunavut. The island has been used by Inuit as far back as 2000 BCE, but Ausuittuq was created as a permanent community in 1953, when the federal government relocated several families from Inukjuak, Nunavik, QC, to Ausuittuq (and Qausuittuq), places with much harsher environments than they were prepared for. To honour this painful history there is a large stone monument in the community, carved by local sculptor Looty Pijamini, which depicts a mother and child looking towards Qausuittuq.\n\nAusuittuq is noted for its close-knit atmosphere—there are fewer than 150 inhabitants—and friendliness, with an annual fishing derby in May that celebrates spring. The surrounding Arctic Cordillera mountain range is popular among tourists, described as a must-climb for the view of the community. Ausuittuq is one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, which may help explain why much of the traditional art practiced here involves sewing warm winter clothes, and why hunting and trapping is still routinely taught and practiced.\n\nSculpture is the other main art form that has been popular in town over the years; local sculptors include Paul Kasudluak and Kavavoe Kiguktak, in addition to Pijamini and his father, Abraham Pijamini, both celebrated master carvers. Despite its small size and the lack of a dedicated workspace, Ausuittuq is also home to a number of other artists including jeweller Jennifer Ningiuk, photographer Laisa Audaluk-Watsko and writer Larry Audlaluk, CC, Ausuittuq’s longest-living resident, whose memoir What I Remember, What I Know: The Life of a High Arctic Exile was nominated for a Governor General’s literary award in 2021.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Susie Qaunaq of Ausuittuq, NU, in 2023.\n\nPostville is the smallest permanent community in Newfoundland and Labrador, with a population of only 195 people. Located on the Labrador coast in Kaipokok Bay, which translates to “frothy waters” in Inuttitut, due to the rapid headwaters in the area. Postville’s English name comes from its fur trade era past, as the central Hudson’s Bay Company post in the area prior to settlement. When a school and church was built there in the 1940s “The Post” was renamed Postville. It remains the only settlement in Kaipokok Bay. Postville was known for its lumber production because it has more trees than inland Nunatsiavut communities. Today, lumber production has been replaced by mineral exploration and uranium mining in the area.\n\nThe community hosts the Fun in the Sun Festival every summer and an annual Heritage dog team race. Postville is also a snowmobile access point for the rest of Nunatsiavut during the winter months through the Labrador Winter Trail system.\n\nThe primary artistic activities in Postville are craft related, slipper, boot and mitten making, stone carving, with newer generations of artists working in photography and painting. Notable artists from Postville include Jason Jacque, Jerry Edmunds, Morris Jacque Jr., Bronson Jacque and Katlyn Jacque, the small town is abound with creativity. With such a small population and range of artistic practices, the style of Postville artists is quite individual, with wood carving being a more standard practice compared with other Nunatsaivut communities who favour stone.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Jason Jacque of Postville, Nunatsiavut, NL, in 2023.\n\nKangiqsuk (Kangirsuk), Nunavik, QC, is located on the 60th parallel and approximately 13 kilometres inland from the west coast of the Ungava Bay, between Quaqtaq to the north and Aupaluk to the south. As such, the name Kangiqsuk means “the bay”. The community of approximately 500–one of the smallest in Nunavik–is surrounded by small mountains and experiences an impressive high tide in the bay during the summer months. Like many Arctic communities, the hamlet is remote and can only be accessed by plane or boat. In the winter months, neighbouring communities can access Kangiqsuk by snowmobile.\n\nCommon artistic practices from the region include carving, dancing and sewing, which is a central activity in the community. The sewing centre is a valued place in the community, where local seamstresses enjoy gathering to share knowledge and hone their skills. Well-known Kangirsuk artists include sculptor Thomassie Kudluk (1910-1989), known for his humorous and unique creations, accordion players Zebedee and Jeannie Nungak, seamstress Winifred Nungak who sells parkas and pualuuk through her own business and contemporary artist and curator Ulivia Uviluk.\n\nKangiqsuk is well-known for its excellent fishing and tourists from Canada and internationally travel annually to fish in the region. The community also has a music festival every few years called the Arctic Char Music Festival. The festival is a celebratory gathering which sees musicians and performers travel from all over Inuit Nunangat to participate.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Olivia Lya Thomassie of Kangiqsuk, Nunavik, QC in 2023.\n\nArviat is the second largest community in Nunavut with a very young population—the majority of the community’s population is under the age of 15. Meaning “place of the Bowhead whale”, Arviat is derived from the Inuktitut word ‘arviq’ meaning ‘bowhead whale’. Arviat has also been known as Tikirajualaaq which means ‘a little long point’ and Ittaliurvik which translates to ‘a place where people make tents.’ The flat landscape surrounding the community is so distinct, that Arviat is known for this across Nunavut.\n\nArt is a defining feature of life in Arviat, from wall-hangings, sculpture, mural-making and music. Some well-known artists from the community include award-winning performer Susan Aglukark and celebrated sculptors Eva Talooki Aliktiluk (1927–1994), Andy Miki (1918–1983), John Pangnark (1920–1980), Lucy Tasseor Tutsweetok (1934-2012) and others. The next generation of artists in the community are building on this rich history and venturing into other mediums including digital illustration, photography and painting. Murals by Charlotte Karetak can be found on buildings throughout the hamlet, picking up on the early legacy of graphic artist and painter Eric Anoee Sr. CM (1924-1989).\n\nThe Kakpik Fashion show is an important annual event, celebrating the talent of local sewers in the community and an opportunity to showcase their latest creations. Similarly, Kiluk, opened in 1996, provides a space for local artists–primarily sculptures and seamstresses–to market their work to the public. While studio space in the community is extremely limited, knowledge sharing, mentorship and creative exploration continue to shape artistic practices in Arviat today.\n\nThis profile was authored by the IAQ and created in collaboration with Ujarak Apadoo of Arviat, NU, in 2023."
