        "text": "FILMS\n\nI‘ve always thought Dick Powell, the first screen Philip Marlowe, was also the best. Director Edward Dmytryk, screenwriter John Paxton and producer Adrian Scott managed to captured the essence of Chandler that proved so elusive in so many other adaptations.\n\nHe was turned down for the lead in Double Indemnity (Paramount, 1944) because director, Billy Wilder thought the public would never buy Powell as anything but a lightweight song-and-dance man. But Powell nabbed the role of Marlowe in 1944’s Murder, My Sweet, now considered a film noir classic, and never looked back. In fact, Powell’s previous image actually may have helped since nobody had great expectations.\n\nWilliam K. Everson, in The Detective in Film, suggests that “Powell — because the realistic conception of the private eye was relatively new, and because Powell was totally new to it — became Marlowe far more easily than Bogart [in The Big Sleep (Warner Bros., 1946)], who had several other competing images working against him: the gangster image, Sam Spade, Rick from Casablanca. Powell tossed off the tired, contemptuous, yet biting Raymond Chandler wisecracks and insults with superbly underplayed style.”\n\nMe? I like Hawks’ The Big Sleep plenty–it’s a fun film, surprisingly light-hearted at times for a “film noir”–but it’s not Chandler’s Marlowe that Bogey’s playing. In the books, Marlowe is a gentleman, and even a bit of a prude, repelling Carmen’s advances, and wary of both romance and casual sex. In Hawks’ version, he’s a horny frat boy on the prowl, tearing his way through WWII Los Angeles, hitting on every babe in sight, including cabbies, booksellers and Vivian Sternwood.\n\nBut after the wild success of Bogart and Lauren Bacall in Hawks’ To Have Or Have Not, Warners was hot for another hit featuring the dynamic duo. Hawks told Warners he would need $50,000 to buy a story he was sure would be another smash, something tough yet romantic enough to capitalize on ther obvious chemistry between the two stars. That story was Chandler’s The Big Sleep.\n\nBut only $5,000 went to Chandler — the rest went to Hawks. Still, Hawks certainly earned his cut. By the time it was released, after numerous rewrites (and even going back and re-shooting key scenes almost a year later), Chandler’s dark existential stroll down the mean streets seen through the eyes of a world-weary detective had turned into a cheeky, sexy romp through LA, following a P.I. who spent much of his time flirting with man-hungry females.\n\nThere was another substantial difference between the two films, though. Mike Davis lays it out plainly in City of Quartz: “Film noir remained an ideologically ambiguous aesthetic that could be manipulated in dramatically different ways. ThusHoward Hawks chose to flatten the deep shadows of The Big Sleep (Chandler’s moist anti-rich novel) into an erotic ambience for Bogart and Bacall, while the more tough-minded Edwatd Dmytryk and Adrian Scott (both future members of the Hollywood Ten) evoked premonitions of fascism and brainwashing in… Murder, My Sweet.”\n\nAfter the one-two punch of Murder, My Sweet and The Big Sleep, films featuring Marlowe have been a decidedly mixed bag, ranging from the sleepily sublime (1975’s Farewell, My Lovely) starring a decidedly too-old-but-still-powerful Robert Mitchum to the ridiculous (1947’s Lady in the Lake, a stiff, pretentious piece of mangled film-making that utilized subjective camera, directed by and starring a very smarmy, gee-I’d-like-to-punch-him-in-the-face Robert Montgomry, the worst Marlowe ever). By comparison, such woozy creative re-interpretations as 1969’s Marlowe starring a too bemused James Garner, 1973’s The Long Goodbye directed by Robert Altman, with Elliot Gould as a half-stoned slacker and even 1978’s huh? remake of The Big Sleep with a half-awake Mitchum fumbling around 1970’s no-longer-swinging London, England don’t seem so bad.\n\nWell, that The Big Sleep remake was bad, but Mitchum’s rumbling voice-over at the end of Marlowe’s soliloquy (excised in the Hawks version) almost makes up for it:\n\n“What did it matter where you lay once you were dead? In a stagnant lake or in a marble tower on the top of a high hill? You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that. Oil and water were the same as wind and air to you. You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell. Me, I was part of the nastiness now.”\n\nThe Long Goodbye, meanwhile, remains notable for its audaciousness. The still controversial re-interpretation of Marlowe by Altman and Gould followed a lost and befuddled Marlowe meandering through seventies-era Los Angeles, a man definitively out of time. But at least Altman and Gould knew who Marlowe was. You might not agree with their interpretation, but at least it was an honest interpretation, an honest attempt to imagine Marlowe in another era.\n\nBy 2023’s Marlowe, directed by Neil Jordan and starring an elderly Liam Neeson, they barely bothered with Chandler at all, instead choosing to base the film on a so-so Chandler pastiche by Benjamin Black). This disappointing and cynical travesty was more about branding and marketing, than anything else—although by 2023, would the mention of Marlowe or Chandler really pack ‘em in? Really? Maybe that’s why everyone involved did whatever the hell they wanted, regardless of almost anything Chandler ever wrote. Neeson often seems confused, and who can blame him? The film made little sense. It couldn’t seem to make up its mind if it was Chinatown or Die Hard or yet another Neeson action flick or maybe just a bad burrito. Friend of this site Nick Anez called it “Dull, poorly directed, badly acted and unbelievable, with Neeson looking like he should be in a wheelchair playing bingo,” and that about sums it up.\n\nNice props, though.\n\nAnd then there’s MAZAN FILIP, a 2003 Czech comedy that was supposed to be an Airplane-type spoof of Chandler and American detective films of the 1940s in general, full of sight gags, wild puns, and slapstick humour, written and directed by Václav Marhoul. Tomás Hanák actually looked pretty good in the part of Marlowe, but Vilma Cibulková, who was supposed to be the femme fatale, was a bit long in the tooth for the role — she looks more like the femme fatale’s mother. But at least she could act, which is more than could be said for most of the rest of the cast — including Hanák — of this decidedly unfunny train wreck. According to one of its harshest online critics, it was “boring, almost narcoleptic,” while another suggested that is “puts the ‘sleep’ into The Big Sleep…”\n\nMURDER MY SWEET | Buy this video | Buy on DVD\n\n(UK title: “Farewell, My Lovely”)\n\n(1944, RKO)\n\nBased on the Farewell My Lovely by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by John Paxton\n\nDirected by Edward Dmytryk\n\nStarring Dick Powell as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Claire Trevor, Anne Shirley, Otto Kruger, Mike Mazurki, Miles Mander, Douglas Walton, Ron Douglas, Ralf Harolde, Esther Howard\n\nTHE BIG SLEEP | Buy this video | Buy this DVD | Buy the BluRay | Watch it now!\n\n(1946, Warner Brothers)\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by William Faulkner, Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett\n\nDirected by Howard Hawks\n\nStarring Humphrey Bogart as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Lauren Bacall, John Ridgeley, Martha Vickes, Dorothy Malone, Charles Waldron, Peggy Knudsen, Regis Toomey, Charles D.

Montgomery had the brilliant idea of using a “subjective” camera so we (the audience) would see everything the way detective Philip Marlowe does. It really is a clever idea–and it really does not work. I’m especially partial to the scene where a badly beaten Marlowe crawls to a phone booth. The knee-high view is priceless.”\n\n— D.L. Browne“Sheesh! They couldn’t even spell “Phillip” right on the office door. But the kissing of the camera lens has to be the nadir of all hard-boiled cinema.”\n\n— Kevin Burton Smith\n\nTHE BRASHER DOUBLOON | Buy the DVD\n\n(UK title: The High Window)\n\n(1947, 20th Century Fox)\n\n72 minutes\n\nBased on The High Window by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by Dorothy Hannah\n\nAdaptation by Leonard Praskins\n\nDirected by John Brahm\n\nProduced by Robert Bassler\n\nStarring George Montgomery as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Nancy Guild, Conrad Janis, Roy Roberts, Fritz Kortner, Florence Bates, Marvin Miller, Houseley Stevenson, Bob Adler\n\nLong considered the redheaded stepchild of Marlowe films, it’s usually dismissed as inconsequential, and certainly stills from the film, depicting George Montgomery as a Marlowe who sports a cheesy mustache don’t hold much promise. But the film, only recently made widely available, while slight, is a pleasant surprise. Some very effective camera work and some great character bits go a long way to making this quickie B-flick an enjoyably satisfying piece of film.\n\nMARLOWE | Buy this video | Buy the DVD\n\n(1969, Metrocolor/MGM)\n\n96 minutes\n\nBased on The Little Sister by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by Stirling Silliphant\n\nDirected by Paul Bogart\n\nCinematography by William H.

Daniels, H.M. Wynant, Jackie Coogan, Kenneth Tobey, Bruce Lee, Christopher Cary, George Tyne, Corinne Comacho, Paul Stevens, Roger Newman, Read Morgan, Warren Finner\n\nThis 1969 adaptation is well worth a look, even if Garner is a little stiff, caught somewhere between the hard-boiled dicks of 40s detective films and his future incarnation as easy-going Jim Rockford. Not essential, maybe, and too groovy for its own good, but fun nonetheless. And you get to see Bruce Lee tossed off a roof. Ouch!\n\nTHE LONG GOODBYE| Buy the video | Buy the DVD | Buy the Blu-Ray| Watch it now!\n\n(1973, United Artists)\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by Leigh Brackett\n\nDirected by Robert Altman\n\nStarring Elliot Gould as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Nina Van Pallandt, Sterling Hayden, Mark Rydell, Henry Gibson, David Arkin, Jim Bouton, Warren Berlinger, Jo Ann Brody ,Stephen Coit, Jack Knight, Pepe Callahan, Vincent Palmieri, Pancho Cordova, Arnold Schwarzenneger\n\nRobert Altman’s quirky, rabble-rousing 1973 revisionist ode to Chandler and Marlowe is either a grievous insult, or a perfect update, depending on where you stand. You hate it, or you love it — that’s all there is to it. Elliot Gould stars, though Leigh (The Big Sleep) Brackett’s script is the real draw here.\n\nAnd the funny thing is that, despite the howls of the alleged “purists,” The Long Goodbye is probably truer to Chandler’s Marlowe than Hawks’ much more celebrated version, which swaps the essential loneliness of the character and the tragedy of crushed ideals of Chandler’s character for a Marlowe who’s more horny fratboy than doomed knight. In Altman’s vision, Marlowe is truly and undeniably part of the nastiness by the finale. No romantic clinches with the babe as the credits roll in this one.\n\nFAREWELL, MY LOVELY | Buy this video | Buy on DVD | Watch it now!\n\n(1975, EK Corporation/ITC)\n\n95 minutes\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by David Zelag Goodman\n\nDirected by Dick Richards\n\nProduced by George Pappas, Jerry Bruckheimer\n\nStarring Robert Mitchum as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Charlotte Rampling, John Ireland, Sylvia Miles, Anthony Zerbe, Harry Dean Stanton, Jack O’Halloran, Joe Spinell, Kate Murtagh, Sylvester Stallone\n\nA solid, enjoyable flick, marred only by the fact Mitchum is about 30 or so years too late to play the role. But there’s something quite engaging in seeing Marlowe as a tired, aging bruiser plowing his way through a faithfully reproduced 1940s Los Angeles of mean streets and “shine bars.”\n\nTHE BIG SLEEP Buy this video | Buy this DVD | Watch it now!\n\n(1978, Winkast)\n\n99 minutes\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by Michael Winner\n\nDirected by Michael Winner\n\nProduced by Elliot Kastner and Michael Winner\n\nStarring Robert Mitchum as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Sarah Miles, Richard Boone, Candy Clark, Joan Collins, Edward Fox, Jimmy Stewart, Oliver Reed\n\nMitchum again, but even older and more tired, and for some reason now an ex-pat living and working London. There’s a solid cast, and in some ways it’s more faithful than Hawks’ classic (they restore the soliloquy, for example, and Candy Clark reclaims much of the disturbing, off-kilter sexuality of Carmen’s character) but it’s at best a curiosity, for die-hard fans only. It also underscores the fact they should have cast Mitchum as Marlowe thirty or so years earlier.\n\nMAZAN FILIP\n\naka “Smart Philip”\n\n(2003, Silver Screen)\n\nBased on the character created by Raymond Chandler\n\nand the play by Václav Marhoul\n\nDirected by Václav Marhoul\n\nStarring Tomás Hanák\n\nAlso starring Vilma Cibulková, Pavel Liska,\n\nInspired by Chandler, this Czech comedy was supposed to be an Airplane-type spoof of Chandler and American detective films of the 1940s, full of sight gags, wild puns, and slapstick humour.\n\nTHE LITTLE SISTER | Watch it on You Tube\n\n(2015, Brooklyn Multimedia)\n\nAnimated\n\n103 minutes\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nGrafted over the PC game Private Eye (1996, Simon & Schuster Interactive and Byron Preiss Multimedia)\n\nDirected and scripted by Josh Buckland\n\nJosh Buckland, the creator of this little animated gem of a bootleg, who put this together using elements of the old PC game Private Eye (which is also based on The Little Sister), admits “I don’t own the copyrights to any of this material, and I cannot imagine who would.” Sure, the audio’s sketchy in spots, its provenance is even sketchier, and the story strays a little too much at times from the original, but what a ride! As Barry Ergang says “it seems to have been grafted over an old videogame, but some parts look like it was lifted from Scooby Doo, or possibly the graphic novel (but) definitely worth investigating.” FanFic taken to a whole new level.\n\nMARLOWE\n\n(2022, Open Road Films/Briarcliff Entertainment)\n\nPremiere: December 2, 2022\n\nBased on the novel The Black-Eyed Blonde by Benjamin Black\n\nScreenplay by William Monahan\n\nDirected by Neil Jordan\n\nStarring Liam Neeson as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Diane Kruger, Jessica Lange, Danny Huston, Alan Cumming, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ian Hart, Colm Meaney, Daniela Melchior and Francois Arnaud. Neil Jordan directed the film from script by The Departed’s.\n\nRADIO & AUDIO\n\nDick Powell (him again!) reprised his role as Marlowe in a radio adaptation of Murder, My Sweet for Lux Radio Theatre in 1945. It was a toned-down but nevertheless successful version of the Chandler novel, and made Powell the first radio Marlowe. He later went on to become radio’s Richard Diamond.\n\nTwo years later, NBC produced Philip Marlowe as a summer replacement series for The Bob Hope Show. It featured several adaptations of Chandler short stories, but was considered too talky and slow-moving. Erle Stanley Gardner, in a letter to Chandler, confided he found it all rather difficult to follow. But the CBS series, The Adventures of Philip Marlowe, that followed the next year, really clicked.\n\nAfter a three episode trial run on The Pepsodent Program in September of 1947 with Van Hefflin in the title role, The Adventures of Philip Marlowe premiered as a weekly series on September 26, 1948. It was well-produced, less introspective than the books or the previous series on NBC, but it had a secret weapon: Gerald Mohr. Mohr excelled as Marlowe, and his snappy delivery, coupled with well-written stories and intriguing characters made for entertaining listening. By 1949 the show was pulling the biggest audience on American radio, with a rating of 10.3 million listeners. In 1950, Radio and Television Life Magazine named Gerald Mohr as the Best Male Actor on radio.\n\n“And it had the best hard-boiled opening lines of any radio detectives series,” according to faithful contributor and OTR fan Stewart Wright. “It has to be heard to be fully appreciated…\n\n“Get this and get it straight! Crime is a sucker’s road and those who travel it wind up in the gutter, the prison or the grave. There’s no other way, but they never learn.”\n\n“I once used it as the voice mail message on my work phone and people called just to hear it,” Stewart confesses. “When I got back, I had lots of blank messages.”.\n\nFinally, in 1977, the BBC had a whack at Marlowe, producing several full-length adaptations that, from all reports, are very very good, indeed. Raymond would have been pleased…\n\nLUX RADIO THEATRE: MURDER MY SWEET\n\n(June 11, 1945)\n\nBased on Farewell My Lovely by Raymond Chandler\n\nStarring Dick Powell as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Claire Trevor, Mike Mazursky, June Dupré\n\nTHE PEPSODENT PROGRAM: PHILIP MARLOWE\n\n(1947, NBC)\n\n13 30-minute episodes\n\nAdapted from short stories by Raymond Chandler\n\nWriter: Milton Geiger\n\nSponsor: Pepsodent\n\nStarring Van Hefflin as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nGuest stars: Gerald Mohr\n\nAnnouncer: Wendell Niles\n\n“Red Wind”\n\n“Trouble is My Busines”\n\n“The King in Yellow”\n\nHOLLYWOOD STARTIME: MURDER MY SWEET\n\n(June 8, 1948)\n\n30-minute episode\n\nBased on characters created by Raymond Chandler\n\nWritten by Milton Geiger\n\nDirected by Robert L.

Powell had, of course, played Marlowe ten years on the big screen, earlier in RKO’s Murder, My Sweet. By most accounts, it was generally a very good production, and was even featured on that week’s TV Guide cover, with a close-up of Powell as Marlowe in a clench with co-star Teresa Wright. But the live telecast is probably best known for the scene in which actor Tris Coffin, whose character had just died, gets up and walks away. Apparently Coffin thought he was out of camera range. He wasn’t. Unfortunately any recordings of the live episode have long since disappeared. Or been destroyed?\n\nThere’s not a whole lot of available information, either, on the first video series featuring of Chandler’s sleuth, PHILIP MARLOWE, which ran for 26 episodes from 1959-60 on ABC, and no memorable stories about it to make it stand out. Philip Carey, a big, tough and usually watchable actor, would seem to have been a decent choice to play Marlowe in 1959. Carey’s Marlowe differed from the books in at least two (and probably more) ways in that he sported a scar on one cheek and apparently had a marina apartment and his own boat. Huh?\n\nThe latter two changes prompted Time, in an article on the glut of TV detectives at the time, to question if Carey’s Marlowe might be on the take from some “wrongos. ” The series came out of the Goodson-Todman shop. These were the game show producers but they also made occasional forays into dramatic television (The Rebel, Branded). The line producer and frequent scripter was Gene Wang, a radio/television veteran who was also the first story editor on the Perry Mason television series. Frank MacShane’s biography of Chandler indicates that E. Jack Neuman, a top-drawer radio-television writer who later developed such long-running series as Dr. Kildare and Joseph Wambaugh’s Police Story, may have written for the series. Other writers included Charles Beaumont, best known for his work on The Twilight Zone, and James E. Moser, creator of Ben Casey and Medic. Obviously, some good talent behind the camera, but the show didn’t distinguish itself and only twenty-six episodes were aired. With so few episodes, it may not have even been syndicated. To my knowledge, episodes haven’t popped up on the video trading markets and it’s a question of whether the prints even still exist. Which is too bad. Even if the show were indifferent, it would be interesting to see what it looked like and, given the time, what the score sounded like. (Contributed by Ted Fitzgerald)\n\nFar more faithful to the source material was PHILIP MARLOWE, PRIVATE EYE, a short (five episodes) series produced in England (and a second series, produced in Canada, responsible for another six episodes), tailored for the American cable television market, starring Powers Boothe as Marlowe. A real plus was that the shows were all adapted from Chandler short stories, even if they weren’t all originally Marlowe stories.\n\nA lot of people really liked this one, but I thought it was all a little too fussy. Too much attention paid to detail, with not enough emphasis on how it all ties together made it look like an overly-bright, sterile period piece. Los Angeles in the dirty thirties and forties comes off as a quaint little setpiece with all the personality of an operating room. And the voice-over narration came off as overcooked Magnum. For me, Marlowe should carry a bit of world-weary introspection in his voice. And in this series, Marlowe had a girlfriend of sorts, in Annie Riordan, tucked away in (where else?) Bay City. The shows ran on HBO and the CBC in North America.\n\nIn July 1998, HBO took another crack at Marlowe, with the Bob Rafaelson-directed POODLE SPRINGS, starring James Caan as an aging Marlowe (it’s set in 1963). It’s based, at least theoretically, on the Robert B. Parker-completed version of Chandler’s unfinished novel. Caan was an intriguing choice, but some of the changes seem rather suspect. Linda Loring is now Laura Parker (?), and she’s no longer a spoiled rich kid, but a working attorney, and Poodle Springs is no longer Marlowe’s (and Chandler’s) derogative term for Palm Springs, but a small town where Phil and Laura settle down. Makes you wonder why they bothered paying for the rights to Chandler’s (or Parker’s) book at all, especially if they were going to let Tom Stoppard have free rein anyway.\n\nMind you, not everyone was disappointed. Cy Silver of Berkeley wrote in to say that he thought “it went well. The actual setting of the desert community in the production was very much like Palm Springs. And its location in the desert not too distant from the Nevada border does fit a Palm Springs-like ambience. And having James Caan play it as someone from another era gave it a time-warp quality, which I found intriguing and enjoyable. And not inconsistent with the inherent tension between Marlowe and Linda Loring.”\n\nThe next stab at reviving Marlowe on television was equally misguided. In 2007, ABC/Touchstone did a pilot/first episode for a potential series, MARLOWE, starring Jason O’Mara as Philip Marlowe. He is, of course, a Los Angeles private eye, but that’s where the resemblance ends. And it’s more than just the lame “updating” to modern times that sinks it — it’s the total lack of any meaningful relationship to Chandler that sends this one down the drain. O’Mara spouts a few predictable, obvious Chandlerisms, but this cocky, horny chatterbox (there’s plenty of voice-over narration) bears no resemblance at all to Marlowe or Chandler. There’s no poetry, no melancholy, no soul; no understanding of what made Chandler so special. Although this Marlowe has a secretary (who has a crush on the boss). But maybe I was hoping for too much. The less you think or Chandler or Marlowe, the easier it might be to enjoy this so-so P.I. outing. The pilot never even aired, but you can see it on YouTube.\n\nSix years later, in 2013, ABC was at it again. This time they decided they’d get Andrew Marlowe (no relation), then riding high as the creator, executive producer and showrunner of Castle, and feature producer Michael De Luca (Captain Phillips, Fifty Shades of Gray) to turn Chandler’s eye into television magic. Marlowe was reportedly going to co-write the script with his wife, Terri Edda Miller, who’d also wriiten for Castle. Alas, the only magic involved was the complete disappearance of the show–it never even reached the pilot stage.\n\nFaring much better was an unauthorized Japanese adaptation of THE LONG GOODBYE that came out the next year. The five-part mini-series, set in Tokyo (instead of Los Angeles) in the 1950s has private detective Banji Masuzawa looking into the death of his friend Tomotsu Harada, who apparently committed suicide after murdering his actress wife and fleeing to Taiwan. In its own way, this was as much a reimagining of the source material as Robert Altman’s 1973 feature film, the social and cultural upheavals of postwar Japan serving as the backdrop. I’ve never seen this one, though, so I’m only guessing. But it sure sounds intriguing.\n\nCLIMAX!\n\n(1954-58, CBS)\n\nDrama anthology\n\n“The Long Goodbye”\n\n(October 7, 1954)\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nStarring Dick Powell as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nAlso starring Cesar Romero, Teresa Wright, Tris Coffin\n\nPowell reprised his role as Marlowe, whom he had played a decade earlier in the theatrical release Murder, My Sweet.\n\nPHILIP MARLOWE\n\n(1959-60, ABC)\n\n26 30-minute B&W episodes\n\nBased on characters created by Raymond Chandler\n\nWriters: Gene Wang, Berne Giler, Robert Bloomfield, James E.

Marilyn Stasio of The New York Times Book Review said “So, I read comic books–you want to make something of it? Not that “comic book” is the proper term, anyway, for a work of art like Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe: The Little Sister … this stunning graphic novel is as visually alluring as the big, bad city after dark.” The cover’s pretty lame, but the inside’s the real thing.\n\nPLAYBACK | Buy this book (2004, Arcade (in French); 2006, Arcade (in English)\n\nWritten by Raymond Chandler\n\nAdapted by Ted Benoit\n\nArt by François Ayrole\n\nNot the Philip Marlowe novel but an adaptation of the original, unproduced screenplay that he eventually turned into the last Marlowe book, all about a Vancouver cop trying to get to the bottom of some nasty business and help a dame out of a jam. This handsome, if rather bleak, story was brought to graphic novel form by writer Ted Benoit and artist François Ayroles and published in France in 2004 — now it’s been translated into English, and it’s a righteous job, all shadow and menace and dark style, sorta like Sin City, but with much better writing.

Sadly, Al will not tell me when he plans to be out of town for a few days, or where he hides his spare key.\n\nRaymond Chandler’s Hamlet by Jonathan Van Post\n\nA short, short story; more a spoof of hardboiled cliches in general, than Chandler specifically, but still fun.
