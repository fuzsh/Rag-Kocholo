        "text": "This episode was packed! So many things happened, I can't believe they covered so much in a single episode.\n\nWe got:\n\nRita and Isabel's backstory (Rita was selling her body, Isabel killed to defend her, and was also her pimp, Carlo was the one requesting Isabel be a maid, Rita didn't start out cruel and manipulative),\n\nScooter trying to play the devious game, but not being smart enough to wait for the evidence to burn completely or at least not draw attention to the fire,\n\nCatherine finding out Scooter was Rita's lover, confronting him, and apparently convincing him to testify against Rita,\n\na new butler who is fiercely loyal to Catherine, was enjoying her fight with Scooter and seemed upset when they made up (unrequited love for Catherine, perhaps?)\n\nIsabel trying to blackmail Rita and Alma, and dropping enough hints to Vern that he figured out he must have caught the murderer(s) on camera,\n\nAlma suggesting killing as first recourse to deal with Isabel, then pretending to apologize to steal the drug so she could kill her when Bertram refused, then going through with it with ease\n\nBertram finding a way to get Rita out of jail without having to expose himself or Alma\n\nRita refusing to throw her cousin under the bus, or even expose her to save herself, which is Rita perhaps going back to her original self\n\nMrs. Yost's nephew showing up, discovering the missing items, and becoming suspicious of the neighbours\n\nDee discovering everything related to Mrs. Yost, from her disappearance, to the stolen items, to the body in one single episode, and then deciding to leave with Vern\n\nPuff! That's a lot of stuff! I don't think previous episodes packed so many plot developments in a single run. And I have to say, I didn't feel anything was rushed or too contrived.\n\nI wonder if Vern and/or Dee will eventually put the pieces together and realize Alma and Bertram murdered Carlo and Isabel.\n\nIt's interesting how they are developing Alma and Rita's arcs. Rita started out cruel and manipulative, and I guess we wouldn't have been surprised if she had actually killed Carlo, or if we found out she had murdered someone before. Now we know she has never killed anybody, she was being abused and someone else killed to defend her. And then she surprises us by refusing to endanger Isabel. In contrast, Alma started out meek, a victim of bullies, someone unhappy and aspiring to better things, who was shocked and horrified when she discovered her husband was a serial killer. Then she started playing devious games to climb up the social ladder, then she hid a body, then she actually manipulated her husband into killing someone for her gain (while framing someone else), and finally becoming a murderer herself.\n\nIf the next two episodes are as packed as this one, we're in for a wild ride.\n\nEdited July 16, 2021 by WearyTraveler\n\n1 hour ago, shapeshifter said:\n\nI did notice in this episode that \"Alma\" and \"Isabel\" were cast using actresses who were almost body doubles, and wondered if the police detectives could be convinced that the face in Vern's PI picture was Isabel, not Alma.\n\nAlma asked Bertram if he'd got the negatives when he got back in the car and he said \"Yes\", so, Vern sent Alma pictures and negatives, he can't print copies of the pictures anymore, which is why he was asking Scooter about what he heard/saw the night of the murder. It seems Vern will never see the pictures he took again, unless Bertram was lying, but why would he do that? If he thought the negatives could resurface, he would be less likely to try to set up Isabel as Carlo's killer.\n\n1 hour ago, shapeshifter said:\n\nBert is the only professional killer in the cast of characters. And Bert is a killer with scruples.\n\nWho was doing quite well for himself and had been getting away with it for decades without anyone suspecting a thing. If it hadn't been for Alma's obsession to get in the garden club, which led her to want to make a dress, which led her to a dropped object, which led her to Bertram's collection of victim keepsakes, he would have probably stayed undiscovered, successful, and happy as a clam!\n\nThis episode's title comes from the 1944 film noir starring Dick Powell, Claire Trevor, and Anne Shirley. It was the first film to feature PI Philip Marlowe, who appeared in 7 novels written by Raymond Chandler. (In 6 of the 7, the killer turns out to be a woman.)\n\nPutting Mrs. Yost's body in the garden was a stupid idea, wasn't it? The body should've gone away with her car, perhaps moved to the driver's seat before the car was pushed into the lake. That wouldn't have been a foolproof plan, but at least there wouldn't be a dead body in the front garden!\n\nDee has put things together (and even found Mrs. Yost's body), and I love it! In the season premiere, Dee told Vern, \"Oh, I love a good murder. The bloodier the better! You see, violence doesn't bother me.\" But now we see that (thankfully) isn't true at all.\n\n.\n\nCatherine knows about Scooter! And it wasn't because he said something stupid. Does Catherine really believe that Scooter has feelings for her? He seems to, but also he does like that she's rich.\n\nI think Bertram and Alma's marriage is as dead as poor Isabel. He called his wife horrible even before she killed Isabel; the spittle coming out of Isabel's mouth was a disgusting touch.\n\nMy favorite line of the episode: \"Bertram, for someone who's murdered dozens of people, you can be a real stick in the mud.\"\n\nI think the show wanted to differentiate between Bertram and Alma and the kind of killers they are. For better and worse Bertram has a moral code and won’t kill people that don’t fit into his “they are dying anyway I might as well make it beautiful” way of thinking. Alma has no such code. She is killing for the practicality of it. She doesn’t care who she hurts and I am not completely sure she wouldn’t kill Bertram or even Dee if she thought it was in her own best interest to do so. Bertram just wouldn’t unless he could find a way to justify it in his own mind as a “sickness” that was killing Alma which might be how it plays out between Bertram and Alma.\n\nAs for Rita this may actually be a reverse trajectory for her. She’s been a bad person all her life but seeing how quick she was vilified she might actually team up with Vern and Dee the only two people who may genuinely be on her side just because they believe in doing “the right thing”.\n\nI think Catherine may actually be more at ease knowing that Scooter is a gigolo. The way she was raised it makes it more comforting to know where everyone stands then to place too much faith on the heart. If you know he will stay because you have money then you give him money to stay. That is something Catherine would probably understand better then Scooter saying he is staying for love.\n\nEdited July 16, 2021 by Chaos Theory\n\nOtto is a great addition! He doesn’t miss a thing. And the scene with him sitting outside Catherine’s room with a drink, eavesdropping on Catherine and Scooter arguing, was priceless!\n\nBertram making Isabel’s death look like a suicide and pinning Carlo’s murder on her was genius. Anyone else notice that her dress matched so well with the bedspread she almost looked like part of the bed? It was visually interesting enough that I wonder if it was intentional, like the show was implying this woman was so insignificant she just blended into the bedspread. Speaking of visual effects, I notice Catherine is no longer dressing so drably, even though she’s supposed to be mourning Carlo.\n\nI loved Dee taking notes on Mrs. Yost’s disappearance. Maybe she’ll join Vern in his detective agency once the baby is old enough to go to school! He doesn’t seem like he’d be old fashioned enough to not want his wife to work. Plus by then World War II will be going on and plenty of women will be working.\n\nExactly how stupid are Alma and Bertram? They got the entire garden not just restored but greatly improved (BTW, getting in so many mature plants must have cost a pretty penny—likely more than they realistically could afford) but didn’t think to either move Mrs. Yost’s body before doing that, or at the very least bury her deeper!? When Dee was digging it seemed like Mrs. Yost was awfully close to the surface, like maybe no more than a foot down if even that. BTW despite reading many Temperance Brennan novels, I have no idea what a corpse at this point would look like, but it looked like they just had the actress lie down and scattered a thin layer of bark on her. Wouldn’t her face be either puffed up with gases or shriveled by now, and not so pink?\n\nI really hope Mrs. Yost’s nephew doesn’t think Dee murdered her since it was fairly obvious it was she who returned the stuff Alma took.\n\nRita’s black and gold ensemble in the scene where she gives Isabel the maid uniform was absolutely stunning. But who hangs around at home dressed like that in the middle of the day?!\n\nMore great lines:\n\n”I have learned that crushing one’s enemies is the best cosmetic.”\n\n”Have fun turning in your grave.”\n\n”Don’t tease Otto. He’s German. It’ll end badly.”\n\nThe look on Scooter’s face when Catherine said “You’ll be packing your bags before you know it”!\n\n”I’ve been thinking about Rita and her little cat. She loves him so much.” “Of course she loves him. They’re the same species.”\n\n”Actions have consequences.” “Well, you weren’t keen to face any when you were filling up graveyards with your previous victims.” (Gotta agree with Alma here; Bertram was being really hypocritical.)\n\n”Now, now, Rita is innocent until proven guilty.” “Is she sweet until proven bitchy? ‘Cause I want to serve on that jury.” (I loved the ladies’ over-the-top eveningwear in that scene.)\n\n”Everything you’ve just said is a lie! … But how much money are we talking?”\n\n”Yeah, I‘m awful. Picking on a nice lady just ‘cause she killed a man and framed my boss.”\n\n”Is he dead?” “He called me ugly. Who cares?”\n\n”I’ll return to our bed when you’re a little less lethal.” (I absolutely LOVED Alma’s floral robe in that scene.)\n\n”Bertram, for someone who’s murdered dozens of people, you can be a real stick in the mud.”\n\n”Killing is stressful enough without quarreling in front of the victim.”\n\nEdited July 17, 2021 by CarpeFelis"
