        "text": "(Also posted in the VI-Control Composition forum)\n\nDear Fellow Composers,\n\nI’ve been trained to write music on paper. My main teacher, one of the best composers of his generation, was also a copyist, and insisted on good and accurate calligraphy. Writing on paper seems like the most obvious way, when dealing with a very rational type of music, based on proportions and semi-automatic processes. It’s also the fastest way to notate some tightly integrated music gestures, made of a bundle of pitches, articulations, and expressions, that would be impossible to quickly notate with notation programs (an example: a violin playing a starting pitch, fading into a jété and gliding up to an uncertain pitch).\n\nAt the same time, I’ve always felt the need to feel the music under my fingers. Neither my mind, nor the calculated music coming out of a computer when listening to the results of what I was writing, has given me a satisfactory connection with my music. My mind, a powerful generator of music, is only a part of my body; and my ears, receiving the waves of pressure from the loudspeakers, are only a part of the sensorial experience. I need a tactile experience of my music, together with the auditory experience.\n\nWhen very young, I composed at the piano. Sometimes, I sat at the piano, and went on experimenting with stravinskian overlapping chords, bartókian hammering rhythms, schoenbergian piercing intervals and misty outburst of notes; some other times, I just checked at the piano what I was writing on paper. I had a physical connection with my music.\n\nLater, when I could afford one, I switched to computers. I tried to simulate “real” music and sounds. However, notation programs were unable to make my notes sound as I wrote them; I wrote them as music, the computer insisted to play them back as arithmetic expressions. The sounds I could feel when playing on the keyboard were not what they were named after: the piano lacked hammers and resonance, violins lacked wood and body, brass did not explode, woodwinds lacked breath and click. The computer was great for electronic music, not for simulating music made with real instruments.\n\nBut acoustic sound libraries improved over the years. VSL was a revolution. Other libraries appeared for specialized types of sound. For what I was looking for, VSL and XSample offered great support to my music. At first, I had something resembling realism in the libraries that came with the Native Instruments package (a taste of VSL, then the realistic chamber strings of Session Strings Pro). Then, I could finally afford the solo instruments of the XSample Library with their extended techniques, and the accurate orchestral sounds of the VSL Special Edition. I had a powerful, realistic sonic arsenal under my fingers. I had all the sound tools I could need.\n\nSo, I could compose at the computer again. But how? Notation programs continued to be cold as a grave. Wallander’s NotePerformer added life to my Sibelius scores, but still more the life of a lemur than that of a living body. And composing by patiently writing and sculpting pitches on the staff looked like underusing the tools I had. What I had was basically a glorified piano – the same keyboard on which the greatest composers of the past loved to improvise and compose, the same white and black technological interface with music they loved to spend time to imagine and feel their music – but capable to really *play*, and not only suggest, a full orchestra.\n\nIs composing at the keyboard legit? With Logic, I can keep the score, pianoroll and controller pages open, in a mix of traditional notation, evolving texture and cluster graphic notation, oscillator and modulator diagrams. I can move the input cursor where I have to insert a segment, and start recording from there. I can step-input pitches as I would do in a notation program. I can have rather accurate notation and realistic sonic rendering at the same time, write notes on staves, and later export a MusicXML file to refine notation with a dedicated program. Logic can also assist me with some serial-based elaborations, unless I want to cut and paste pitches generated by OpenMusic.\n\nWhat I feel is that, by composing at a DAW that lets me easily have accurate control on the piece’s micro- and macro-structure, I can really go further, and maintain a better control on the piece’s macro-structure and evolution. I can create a general structure and time signature map in advance, insert motives and focal points as placeholders, use the track arrangement space as a blank wall where to attach post-its, and create my piece by going from the general image to the finer details, gradually filling that wall. And always keeping contact with the actual sound, not simply a mental image of the sound.\n\nIsn’t this a lot like the old Maestros sitting at their klaviers, one hand on the keyboard and the other hand writing on a music sheet?\n\nPaolo\n\n[I hear Bill and what he says about smaller ensembles and hybrid ensembles, the latter actually being mainstream in musical theatre today].\n\nSerious musical tradition is almost lost in terms of everyday people partaking in it, and that dates back to the late 19th century, where composers steadily exceeded the technical abilities of the average family member to perform their pieces.\n\nWhat remains is thanks to schools still requiring children to attend music classes and shoving several orchestral instruments in their hands and mouths. Same with choral music.\n\nIf music at some point becomes the exclusive arena of professionals it will be the end.\n\nAs a composer not in his mid 20s or 30s anymore, and among hundreds of thousands of other composers and never-will-be-but-still-posing-as composers, I am appalled at the state of our affairs. Before I get into it though, we must define and then separate the 'professional' composer from everybody else:\n\nWhat defines a 'professional' composer in what is referred to as 'serious music' (for lack of a better term) worldwide, as opposed to a hobbyist? Talent and ability? A university degree (i.e. official recognition)? Demand for his work (as opposed to him begging all day for inclusion in programmes)? The requirement of a fee for his work? Something else still?\n\nI am not trying to define 'composers' in general, but the 'professional' composers, and the distinction is very important!\n\nIn my opinion, the 'professional' 'serious music' composer is somebody who is asked for his work and makes a living out of it, even if a supplementary one at that. Maybe there are others more talented, writing better than him etc., but they are not professionals until people ask for their music and/or organizations are willing to pay for it.\n\nNow, I have spent this time making this distinction not to begin an argument about who is a composer and who isn't, and who can become 'professional' by knowing the right people etc., but to make an even more important point, and the above definition was necessary towards that.\n\nApart from the tiniest fraction of 'professional' composers who are paid for their work, the vast majority of composers - professional in every other way - are not merely asked, but are expected to compose and proliferate their music in the concert hall/internet not merely for free(!!), but to actually fork out their own money to pay for parts and postage! And be happy!!\n\nWhy? And there comes the submoronic argument from all retards, which really shows how much they care to think about the issue: They say, \"But you are an artist. You do this for love not money, right?\" (The alternative is, \"You're no bloody good and we are doing you a favour\", but this cannot apply to almost every one of us, surely)\n\nNone of these f***s however would dream of asking a 'professional' painter to hang his paintings in a gallery with a sign saying \"Free. Take as you please\". None of these mutants would expect a 'professional' pianist or singer to perform in a concert for free (the fee could still be a few hundred €€). So what are they averring? Those painters and musicians are NOT artists? That they are in it for the money?...\n\nWhich brings me to the thread's topic in the following way:\n\nI am (sadly) not in my mid 20s or 30s anymore, and reality becomes ever more blinding. I consider myself a semi-professional composer of 'serious music' (according to my definition above), in that I am asked for my work (instead of me begging) more than occasionally. However, almost unfailingly, I am offered no money. Of course, most musicians that know me respect me, so most don't ask for new pieces for nothing, but ask me whether something already exists that they might perform. This makes not much difference however. They will get paid for performing it. People say they are sorry for not having any money to pay and if I wish for payment they will regrettably perform Schumann again (forgetting that legally they'd have to pay a publisher for the particular Schumann score they'd use). By the way, usually the performers are of a considerable calibre and I agree to their terms, which keeps me getting performed; but do the ends justify the means?..\n\n[Note: For my media work I have always contracted to get paid since I was 21, but I never really tried to make a serious career of it. For media music I advise youngsters to always ask for a fee and never work in any project for free, even if it's your first one. I don't care if you get €50 (say for expences). At least you can build on €50. In the next project you can ask for €70 or €100, etc. But you cannot build on €0. P.S.: If you are a Hans clone or use the software to write the music for you, offer money!]\n\nIn those instances where it is in my interests to get performed (an orchestra or a name-performer), the artistic results have been less than satisfying in many cases, mostly due to insufficient time allowed in rehearsals for the 'living' composer's work. This is a direct result of money not being involved. People - especially musicians - respect money!\n\nSo do I lock myself in my studio and program my beautiful, flawless, digital ensembles to exclusively perform my work? I have done so, partly as a process of compositional trial and error, mostly for the sheer pleasure of hearing the work performed. Do I consider it a good enough substitute? I consider the digital orchestra as a sine qua non, an irreplaceable part of my life, preferable artistically to an appalling live performance, but after decades of using such substitutes in tandem with the real thing (the Kurzweil 250 and other samplers since were not that much inferior, especially when we knew no better), I still find digital to be cold and completely soulless. I adore it for its beautiful sound and accuracy, I admire the top programmers for their skills, nuance, and musicality, but I suppose I needed to experience this kind of perfection to realize how much 'humanity' and fluidity are a great part of performance/interpretation. Plus, a musical work is not just notes, instruments, velocities, and impulse responses. Listen to Furtwangler, Stokowcki, Mitropoulos Celibidache, etc. The dimensions of an interpretive structure alone...\n\nMost of all, I still hear the 'fakeness' of the sounds, that takes a significant lot out of the enjoyment. Someday?...\n\nThe above is not gospel obviously, but it is my take on matters, plus you cannot do really modern scoring on sample libraries due to the notational/articulation complexities that are still unavailable in those libraries (to my knowledge), unless someone has already managed to simulate Lachenmann or Saariaho on Cinesamples.\n\nI have found all of the above to be true of my own personal experiences and sadly, indicative of the challenges artists have always faced. I remember when a Toronto-based composer of great repute passed away, another of his colleagues stated in a news story something to the effect of, \"we composers are some of the lonliest individuals, toiling in the conversation of our own minds, constantly feeling marginalized, inadequate in our abilities, yet optimistic and hopeful that we'll break through and be satisfied artistically as well as celebrated by the public.\"\n\nI'd like to distill some of the above observations down to a few simple factors, which make difficult the idea that one can be a \"serious composer\" and be remunerated/compensated/appreciated in a manner that would sustain a viable living. As a performer, educator, and recently, a composer (only in the past 3 years have I actually viewed myself in this light), the points below come from my interactions/observations wearing those various hats...you may completely disagree with me!\n\nFirst, a simple point to consider: composers create music, regardless of whether the music is \"serious\" or \"popular.\" Since music is ultimately designed to be enjoyed as a pleasurable experience (no different than a good story, good food, or a massage), in order to pay for it, it must bring a certain pleasure to an individual.\n\nIn order for individuals to value art music and the like, they must have enough exposure to it from an early enough age, including their own opportunity to \"try their hand at it\", such that when they're old enough to be a supporter/patron/consumer of arts, they can disseminate quality art music from drivel, for lack of a better term, and because they themselves, having learned music, but perhaps not excelled at it, respect the skill involved in those that continue to persue it professionally...and as such, choose to support it.\n\nThis is why sports, for example, are revered. Most people played football, basketball, baseball, etc. through their youth. They understand the nuances of the sports they now watch as adults. They can relate better to athletes, because to some extent, they were athletes themselves...just not good enough to be professionals. Now, they view all the passing, hitting, and dunking of professional athletes, and because they know they can't emulate that skill set, they pay to see others do it.\n\nSuch \"relatability\" does not exist in the realm of concert music. Very few people grow up learning about classical music in any significant enough way to \"relate\" to it. Without the skills necessary to disect it, it comes down to the notion of \"does this give me pleasure or not?\" Most serious modern music does not give listeners those things to which they can relate: rhythm, harmony, melody...and so, they turn to music which is simpler, more aesthetically pleasing, and accessible.\n\nAnd that's why \"serious\" composers become fans of each other's work, further alienating themselves from the public which simply wants music that's not a \"pill to swallow.\" Without public appreciation, dollars simply don't flow in to the classical arts...ergo, money isn't avilable for composers to compose and performers to perform. Highly skilled performers and composers that have studied music their whole lives simply don't relate to the \"common man\" (Copland did, lol) The same could be said for a group of highly skilled genetic scientists; or a group of architects, engineers, doctors, lawyers, etc. The difference is, their services and skill sets are valued in society, because people perceive their work to enhance/improve their quality of life and/or fulfill a NEED. Music and art fulfills many needs too, and there's no argument that the public consumes our product with voracity (although not necessarily art music)...however, because it's so freely available, and because music doesn't solve \"real problems\" (not my view, but rather a general thought) like fixing a bridge, or defending a murder charge, or finding a cure for cancer, it's strictly entertainment. And entertainment dollars go to \"products\" that serve the public at large. How many foreign language film festival films get viewed compared to Hollywood blockbusters?\n\nSimply put, serious composers have been, are, and always will be unfortunate victims of apathy, indifference, and exploitation. Some of it owes to the way society values (or doesn't value) art. Some of it is our own doing (as in, we compose freely, for pleasure, and often against the common sensibilties of a non-musically trained audience) and then lament the fact that nobody wants to pay us to hear our music.\n\nPerhaps, even sadder, though, and unrelated to the original theme of this thread, but a trend I've noticed on this forum and in my experiences as an artist in \"the real world\", is how a group of composers, regardless of our skill level/experience/interest/style of music, would at times make other members of their very own group feel less valuable than they themselves...putting themselves on a pedestal and/or undermining someone else to further elevate themselves. Artists are notorious for being \"cruel\" to their peers...of being judgmental...of being untrusting of the motivations of others...of being \"holier than thou\"...of flaunting their academic achievements, philosophies, and or historical knowledge in such a way as to further alienate themselves not from the public, but from their own kind. To this end, I would like to think that if we were all kinder to each other, we'd be rewarded with a more positive outlook and perspective on a career path that's fraught with so many obstacles and challenges.\n\nI could go on and on, but I doubt anyone's even read to this point, so I'll get back to my \"work\" (unpaid, unappreciated though it may be) because it brings ME pleasure :)\n\nDave\n\n\"Artists are the tellers of the human story...so, let's treat each other like humans!\"\n\nbogdan: Thanks for the thumbs up.\n\nA couple of comments to issues raised since my post: Plumbers, electricians, and sewage workers get paid a lot better than composers because people's need for a working toilet or general power outweighs their need for culture. However, one is in need of a plumber, an electrician, or a lawyer once in a blue moon, but in need of culture much more often, but it is now free-for-all all over the internet, and of all kinds...\n\nThe sports analogy was good, and that is why I claimed that whatever music they do at schools nowdays is what keeps the tradition alive since \"we\" have been too lofty for too long, refusing to compose for the amateur anymore.\n\nDave: I understand your good intentions but I disagree completely. One of the reasons that performers are afforded more respect than composers is that performers' artistic worth is readily quantifiable.\n\nComposers however are a different story. Since our stupid decision to emulate the visual arts - where one can urinate on a 2X1 canvas and then splash it all over with 10 cans of enamels, Christen it Solitude or WWIII Holocaust, a neo-post-anaphylactic-meta-mini-maximalistic-etc., and still sell that toilet paper for upwards of €13,000 - we shot ourselves in the foot...\n\nYou see, people react differently to the above canvas than they do to Jonh Cage's holding an empty manuscript to the light and then drawing notes where he spots imperfections in the texture. The reason people are more receptive to shyt on canvas than shyt in concert/record is not that the visual creation is unique whereas anybody can buy a copy of the musical work. The reason is that they can glance at the canvas for a few seconds and they will have seen it in its completeness. They can even talk to their friends sipping wine while looking at it. They may not really like or understand it, but at least the discomfort is over in seconds and then they can gossip for hours about it. They buy it if they can and if they are reassured enough that by owning it they are regarded in a higher light by exhibiting it to house-guests.\n\nContrarily, those same people would have to endure anything from 5-10 minutes, to a whole concert in forced silence and immobility, listening to absolute cacophony that brings strong discomfort rather than pleasure, so no enjoyment whatsoever is gained during this supposed absorption of culture. Why should they pay anything for torture? In addition, the artist-defecator needs to impose on nobody else to (ex)create his finished work of ars. In our case, performers willing to put serious time and effort into learning our sonic expectorations must be procured, and these are the same people performing Beethoven and Chopin for a living. So our stuff had better be at least 'interesting'; and I mean interesting to them, not us...\n\nWhere does this leave us? The same way one will not and should not be recognized as a concert pianist if they cannot perform anything over Grade 5, or as a concert singer if their vocal range is just shy of a perfect 5th - i.e. quantifiable measurements - the same way most people should not be recognized as composers if they can't ?????????????????\n\nNot as easily quantifiable, everybody seems to have their own minimum standard of what constitutes a composer worthy of professional performances, but in the meantime as we cannot agree on a universal definition, more and more hordes of non-musical orks pass themselves off as composers every day, tainting the profession and making it very hard for the real ones to get a place in the sun, the respect, and the remunerations they deserve.\n\nFor this reason I strongly recommend that instead of being touchy-feely and sweet to one another, we instead become protective of the great legacy we have been bequeathed, making certain that hacks and charlatans are kept clear of the 'professional' arena (as all other musicians/performers have done), and slowly claim back our rightful places in a society that has long since taken our hard work for granted.\n\nHow does all this relate to the thread's topic? In the unfortunate case that we reach a point where no new music is getting performances unless one actually pays(!!) for such, perhaps we should look into ways we can attract audiences to concerts of sampled orchestral performances. Create a new trend; maybe even sell CDs at the end...\n\nI wonder what the boys at the VI Control had to say about this; if someone would summarize for us...\n\nErrikos, as always, your comments are spot on in many ways. You are perceptive, insightful, and passionate in your arguments. Specifically, I found your comparison between music and visual arts to be spot on.\n\nIn terms of the social aspects of creating art, and then sharing it publicly, an additional level of frustration awaits composers (and dancers, painters, etc.) when they discover the superficiality behind the public's appreciation and/or understanding of the work to which they have listened/seen, etc. For example, a work of mine was performed by the symphony alongside several works by Haydn, etc. Following the performance, a trio of local laywers and \"arts patrons\" held a fund-raising coctail party on behalf of the symphony. During the course of the evening, as a \"living composer\" working the room, I was met with endless empty platitudes about how wonderful my piece was. Often, they would also try to impress me with stories of their culturally-rich lives, name-dropping the various symphony performances and operas they had attended.\n\nEventually, I decided to have a little fun with the next people I would meet. I began pushing them for specifics about what they enjoyed during the evening's performance, whether it be something about my piece or the Haydn, etc. Here are some of the comments I received: \"I just loved sitting up front...you could really see the Maestro's facial expressions well, and they were hillarious!\"... \"I thought the HAYDEN was ok, but YOUR piece was really great. I'd buy a CD of it right now if you have one!\"... \"I loved everything. Those musicians...wow, they're so good!\"...and my personal fave: \"I think those sticks moving in sync is so amazing!\"\n\nA few additional points to consider: One might liken highly skilled, learned composers vs. bedroom sequencers to a filet mignon prepared by a 3 star Michelin chef vs. a Big Mac. Surely the Big Mac is ubiquitous as are the influx of less-skilled composers, while the vast majority of people are content to consume a Big Mac, or a formulaic pop song, the high-end chef/composer simply needs to focus his/her energy on creating excellence and those with a more refined pallette will find/consume/appreciate it. By the very exercise of creating music of sophistication/complexity/substance, you eliminate it from the possibility of being enjoyed by 95% of the population that is simply not educated/exposed to this type of art. So, in essence, the composer must align themselves with small communities of like-minded individuals and perhaps over time, work to increase awareness/expposure to a larger audience. I still feel this is done first by creating great music, and then much like any other product or service, reaching out in creative ways to market it. And no, I personally don't know how to do this with any level of measurable success.\n\nAs a accordionist that grew up exposed to a newly emerging body of repertoire for an instrument that wasn't accepted as a serious instrument of the concert stage, through my teacher in Canada and several European pioneers of the free-bass accordion, I was used to playing modern works with little public appeal...works that exploit the technical and sonic possibilities of the accordion, much like the works you described Errikos. Often, a chamber concert of 6 musicians on stage would be attended by 5 audience members. The composers I worked with all had university positions, which allowed them the financial stability to compose and/or draw from faculty and students for public performances of their works.\n\nMany years later, I find myself composing with no academic appointment, and a desire to write tonal music that occasionally stretches the traditional boundaries, but doesn't devolve into complete dissoance/atonality. It is then that I feel accused by modern composers of \"pandering\" to audiences...this constant struggle to figure out how to balance the need to earn a living (ergo writing music with mass appeal) vs. fulfilling personal desires to grow artistically and push your compositional skills to their limits is one we all must deal with. There is no simple answer. I guess, as William suggested, we simply must compartmentalize our creative energies in to distinct lines of work: the commercial film/media music vs. the concert stage repertoire.\n\nIn my case, I can say, that your idea of virtual performances of orchestral works, is something my wife and I have already begun addressing. Last year, during our concerts (we're an accordion and clarinet duo), we introduced a medley of \"Disney\" hits in which I orchestrated a 10 minute arrangement for us live with \"backing tracks.\" Unlike a typical sax player playing alongside a backing track, this is a fully orchestrated, nuanced work, with endless tempo changes, timbral variations, etc. much in line with the sound of a finished Alan Menken soundtrack, except with accordion and clarinets (E flat, B flat, bass) playing live. It took a week to do the arrangement, and 6 months to program the virtual orchestra, including creating a custom tempo map and audio cues for us to perform on stage. It went over well, and the \"Disney\" choice was made to be the main attraction of our school shows for children.\n\nAdditionally, I have written an entire CD of music for us with string quartet, piano trio, brass quintet, and even a double concerto, all of which we are currently producing for our next CD, which is essentially \"Acclarion with Virtual Instruments.\" This was all born out of the same frustration/inability to get many public performances of my music and/or for us as a duo to work alongside other musicians due to time constraints, budgets, etc.\n\nOh, I have seriously rambled here! I'll end this now, but would like to thank Paolo, William, Errikos, and others for sharing your experiences, which have been immensely therapeutic and helpful to me. I often feel isolated as a musician (heck, being an accordionist, it was inevitable! lol) and moreso as a composer. It's nice to remember that we're all struggling with these issues and hopefully, some among us will have the opportunity to shed greater light on these issues, so that over time, the tides begin to change and improve our working conditions.\n\nAll the best,\n\nDave\n\nCheers Bill..\n\nDave: It isn't often that I communicate with kindred spirits, even on a forum such as this. I am grateful for the experience. By the way, I don't know much about accordion (although when I lived in Sydney Australia I had met a very good soloist - Ross Maio), but I have heard it in modern chamber scores, and I must say I found that the instrument's possibilities fit that aesthetic very much, and I was surprised by the possible range of expression. Congratulations on your concert success with your wife and your fellow collaborators. Finally, I very much enjoyed the post-concert anecdotes, I also receive a lot of attention from audience members at the end of the night (inquiries, congratulations, autograph requests, etc.), no matter how badly the performance has gone. Strange but enjoyable and, as it happens for a career, necessary...\n\nWhen the performances have been successful however, that's when the good stuff happens. Back in Sydney for example, and during the interval of a play that I had scored, a stranger approached me and said that they had come not for the play, but because they saw my name in the poster credits and they remembered having really liked my music in the past. I suppose it is moments such as this that make our pain and strife sufferable.\n\nPaoloT: I almost always write the music on (digital) paper first, even if the intended performance is a virtual one. I couldn't do otherwise as I can't begin an orchestral work with a loop, which I then modulate with my thumb as it keeps pounding, and then add some brass pads, spikes, or rips, then some choirs singing jibberish, and then keep adding layer upon layer etc.. This is for people that have come to symphonic writing from a DJ background and I cannot relate to them at any level. These are one type of charlatans to whom I was referring in my previous post.\n\nIn any case, thanks for the thread and your thoughts on these issues."
