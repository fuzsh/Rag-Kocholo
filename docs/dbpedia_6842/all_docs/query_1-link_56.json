        "text": "Matthew Sweet | 15 August 2015\n\nIn 1976, an old director and a young composer ate lunch in a small office at Paramount studios. The director had steak and a bottle of red wine. The composer nibbled salad. The talk was not of the film they were making together.\n\nInstead, they discussed their shared enthusiasm for contemporary music – about which, the young composer soon realised, the old director knew far more than he. Once lunch was over, it was back to work on Family Plot. For Alfred Hitchcock, the last line in the filmography. For John Williams, an intermezzo from his early period, between Jaws and Star Wars.\n\nHas any director understood the power of music more completely than Hitchcock?\n\nThink of the scene from Young and Innocent, when the camera moves through a crowd of dancers to find the eyes of a blackface swing-band drummer, whose twitching eyes reveal a murderous secret.\n\nOr the discordant electronica that amplifies the horrors of The Birds – and is the nearest thing offered to an explanation of their savagery. Or the weird howl of the Theremin on the soundtrack of Spellbound.\n\nBut he didn’t formulate all these on his own – Hitchcock developed his musical intelligence in conjunction with some of the screen’s greatest composers.\n\nWaxman and Hitchcock both went west to avoid the Nazis – though only Waxman was beaten up by them on the streets of Berlin.\n\nHis first score for Hitchcock was a landmark – not just for its shivery Novachord weirdness, but for its life beyond the screen – the Rebecca suite was one of the first Hollywood scores to be broadcast on the radio, sold on disc and performed in the concert hall.\n\nThere were three more collaborations. For Suspicion, Waxman crafted a theme that seemed to agree with the dark speculations of its heroine – the musical equivalent of the light bulb Hitch placed inside the doubtful glass of milk that Cary Grant offers to his bride at the climax of the picture.\n\nFor The Paradine Case Waxman produced a neurotically restless piano rhapsody. The score for Rear Window was another revolution: a mash-up of jingles and pop ballads that issued from the radios owned by the apartment-block residents spied upon by James Stewart’s immobilised hero, plus an original number, constructed in the course of the action by one of the characters – a songwriter played by Ross Bagdasarian.\n\nThe complexity of the exercise seemed to exhaust both director and composer, who never worked together again. “I had a motion picture songwriter when I should have had a popular songwriter,” Hitchcock told Truffaut in the 1960s. A parting shot, delivered a decade after the parting.\n\nThe Hungarian master Rozsa won an Oscar for his only work with Hitchcock: Spellbound – a thrilling and preposterous film set in a sanatorium where Ingrid Bergman plays a doctor who begins to have her suspicions about a new member of staff, played by Gregory Peck – a man with a morbid fear of black parallel lines.\n\nHitchcock commissioned Salvador Dali to produce a sequence in which we see the images that burn inside the mind of one of the characters – and Rozsa’s score proceeds at a similarly hysterical pitch. A Theremin haunts the work – which by 1945, already coded for the weird and the otherworldly.\n\nLydia Kavina reveals the secrets of the theremin\n\nRoy Webb adored the darkness – or so his CV suggests. He spent many years at RKO crafting atmospheric scores for films noir such as Murder My Sweet and Crossfire and Build My Gallows High.\n\nIn 1961 a house fire robbed Webb of his entire archive and reams of unperformed manuscripts.\n\nHe was a protégé of the composer Herbert Stothard, who invited him to Hollywood to orchestrate an early Technicolor talkie called Rio Rita. That interest in Brazilian rhythms came in useful in 1946, when Webb was assigned to Hitchcock’s Notorious, in which Cary Grant’s Agent Devlin recruits Ingrid Bergman to infiltrate a Nazi spy ring in South America – which is led by Claude Rains, a Hitler-loving mummy’s boy whose wine cellar is full of uranium-packed champagne bottles.\n\nIt’s as much a love story as a spy-thriller – Webb was as emphatic about the romance as the mystery and intrigue.\n\nNotorious was Webb’s only score for Hitchcock. If the director considered employing him again in later years, the request would have fallen on deaf ears. In 1961 a house fire robbed Webb of his entire archive and reams of unperformed manuscripts.\n\nDespondent, he never composed another note.\n\nDimitri Tiomkin had a catchphrase – “don’t hate me.” It was something he said to directors who were about to hear a painful truth.\n\nStrangers on a Train, however, may be Tiomkin’s Hitchcock masterpiece.\n\nTiomkin knew what he was talking about – he’d been putting music to film images since the early years of the Russian revolution, accompanying films by Eisenstein and Pudovkin.\n\nHe’d lived, too – his musical career took him from the Homeless Dog café in Tsarist St Petersburg, to the Weimar-Era Berlin Philharmonic to the recording studios of MGM and Universal.\n\nHis Hitchcock scores show a similar adaptability. The music of Shadow of a Doubt is founded on a waltz that reflects the punishing singlemindedness of the plot.\n\nDial M for Murder incorporates the ringing of the telephone into its elegant structure. Strangers on a Train, however, may be Tiomkin’s Hitchcock masterpiece.\n\nThe plot concerns two men hope to commit a perfect crime by exchanging murders. (“Criss-cross!” enthuses Farley Granger’s silky conspirator.) The music follows the same pattern, with motifs for its characters competing in a brash, frenetic score."
