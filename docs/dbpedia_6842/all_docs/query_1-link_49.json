        "text": "Murder, My Sweet is a French band formed in 2020 in Marseille, France. Taking their band name from the 1944 American film noir, which emphasizes a dark and moody lyrical universe, their music blends the raw and groovy energy of rock with the cathartic atmospherics of post-punk.\n\nMurder, My Sweetâs tracks\n\nAnother Night by Murder, My Sweet\n\npublished on 2022-04-05T10:57:00Z\n\nMy Sweet by Murder, My Sweet\n\npublished on 2022-04-05T10:53:45Z\n\n3m3k by Murder, My Sweet\n\npublished on 2022-02-05T08:55:01Z\n\nBlexa by Murder, My Sweet\n\npublished on 2022-04-05T10:51:46Z\n\nReflection by Murder, My Sweet\n\npublished on 2022-04-05T10:49:07Z\n\nShifting Lines by Murder, My Sweet\n\npublished on 2022-02-05T08:51:17Z\n\nGloomy State by Murder, My Sweet\n\npublished on 2022-02-05T08:46:40Z"
