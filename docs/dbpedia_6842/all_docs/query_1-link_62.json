        "text": "\"A swift visit to The Murder of My Sweet's website reveals that all of the band members all look about twelve years old which is really frightening and makes one wonder how young they were when they formed in Stockholm in 2006. Still, apparently they dig film noir which is decidedly cool and there is a certain cool darkness to their music, the focal point of which are the vocals of Angelica Rylin who delivers a crystal clear performance all the way through.\n\nIt's easy to compare vaguely Gothic female-fronted metal bands with superficially similar bands but \"Unbreakable\" mines a commercial seam that is not wholly like Nightwish, Nemesea or even Within temptation and that's good enough in my book. If I had a major criticism of Bye Bye Lullaby it would be that it is just a tad too long at thirteen tracks and it kind of sags around the middle of the record but if they can get out there and tour they have a chance of making it.\" - Sea Of Tranquility"
