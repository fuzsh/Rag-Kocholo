They do not sell advertizing.\n\nAll of the movies I have presented are for educational purposes and to preserve movie making & acting as an art form. Movies are a true form of art in storytelling that can be traced back to cavemen drawing pictures, in color, on cave walls. Making this art form available to the public goes back to chained libraries where a single book cost as much as a house. Find it in your heart to give what you can. THANK YOU!"
