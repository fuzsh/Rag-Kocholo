I'm into film noir these days. Tonight, as I'm watching 1944's Murder, My Sweet, it strikes me that Roy Webb was really a very good composer, confirmed by his illustrious career. I'm going to look out for more of his scores. Are any of you fans?

PS: I just read this tragic info:

After a house fire in 1961 destroyed most of Webb's film scores and unpublished concert music he ceased composing altogether.

Thanks for the tip, George, I'll look out for that one! FWIW, Giorgo Moroder did the soundtrack for the '82 remake!
