        "meta_description": "Introducing the Ernie Ball Music Man Mike Herrera StingRay bass. For more than two decades MXPX frontman and bassist Mike Herrera has wielded a custom StingRay, modified to his unique specifications. Now, Herreraâ€™s secret weapon is available to the public. The Mike Herrera StingRay features an ash body with Seafoam Green finish, a matching headstock, an engraved white pearloid pickguard, passive electronics (no battery required), and a custom laser-engraved Artist Series neckplate. Having the appearance of a traditional 2-band EQ StingRay, the Herrera StingRay's pickup is actually wired straight to the jack with three dummy knobs. Additional features include a maple neck and fretboard, 21 nickel frets, six bolt neck, and alnico magnets. New for 2022 the bass is available in a limited edition \"Flat Black\" package that includes a satin finish, numbered neck plate, certificate of authenticity signed by Mike Herrera and a Mono case. The Flat Black package is limited to 10 globally.",
