In this video, http://www.WatchMojo.com counts down our picks for the top pop punk bands. For this list, we've narrowed it down to bands that have been most often linked with the genre. Bands that have more of an association with genres like emo like My Chemical Romance and Jimmy Eat World, will be for another time. Be sure to also check out our list of the Top 10 Punk Anthems.\n\nSpecial thanks to our users Jose Delonge Angeles, Daniel McDonald, RUNES138, doworkson123123, Ardvarkis, Musiclover0821, Kate Hopcraft, hiorheyrcords and James Selway for submitting the idea on our Suggest Page at http://www.WatchMojo.comsuggest read more..."
