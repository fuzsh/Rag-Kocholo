        "text": "A Dream Too Late was a Christian experimental rock band from Albany, Oregon, United States. The band signed up with Tooth & Nail Records in 2007. They released their first album \"Intermission To The Moon\" on 6 November 2007. In 2007 they also toured with Falling Up, Run Kid Run, and The Send. In 2008, due to unknown reasons they were let go by Tooth & Nail Records. The band recently stated on their Myspace that they have broken up and that previous members have created a new band called \"Philadelphia\". The Philadelphia project was active up until February 2011 releasing only one song.\n\nAaron Marsh is an American singer, songwriter, musician and record producer from Florida. He first gained prominence as the lead singer, guitarist, and pianist for the Florida-based indie rock band Copeland, who formed in 2000. Marsh has since gone on to numerous production projects, co-producing his own band's studio albums usually along with either Matt Goldman or Aaron Sprinkle, as well as producing The Myriad's You Can't Trust a Ladder, the Be Fair EP by the band Estates, and The Positives by Person L. Marsh produced Anchor and Braille's debut album: Felt, which was released on August 4, 2009. Marsh's production was praised by both AbsolutePunk and Alternative Press in their reviews of the album.Marsh has reported that he will now be producing full-time in The Vanguard Room recording studio. He has been working on a new project called The Lulls in Traffic, and they released their first video June 2011. He has yet to publicly define his role in the band, but it can be gathered he is producing and singing in the group. He is producing the tracks while collaborating with Ivan Ives for The Lulls in Traffic. He calls it his \"skewed view\" of underground hip-hop.Marsh also stated that a Copeland reunion tour does not seem to be a possibility, however, they released Ixora on November 24, 2014."
