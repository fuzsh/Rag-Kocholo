        "text": "Who else has been loving the recent resurgence of 2000s punk rock act MXPX lately? Frontman Mike Herrera is honestly one of the hardest working musicians, and you’d kinda gather this if you’ve tuned into their many livestreams over the past year (suss our review of that here).\n\nThe band have just dropped their latest new track, ‘Say Yes’ and it’s a danceable, cool blend between ska punk and punk rock. Herrera has also asked Rivals vocalist Kalie Wolfe to jump on the track to really make the song shine as an upbeat love song. Her addition definitely gives it a little more of a poppier feel, and makes ‘Say Yes’ fit right in all things pop punk right now.\n\nIf you’re not yet familiar with Kalie’s band, Rivals just unleashed a stellar record of brooding emo-pop anthems called Sad Looks Pretty On Me (review here), which has become one of my go-to favourites this year.\n\nWords by Tamara May @citylightstam"
