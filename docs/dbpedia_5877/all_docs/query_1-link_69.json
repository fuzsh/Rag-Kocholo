        "text": "Tag: Punk Rock\n\nChris & Max Pick …songs from 2006\n\nHappy Friday and to readers in the U.S. hopefully a nice long holiday weekend. Welcome to the next installment of Chris & Max Pick…, a song series started by fellow blogger Max from PowerPop in June 2023. He covered the years 1955 through 1995, and I’ve picked it up starting with 1996, aiming to take it all the way to 2024. Max generously agreed to contribute. We’re up to 2006.\n\nArctic Monkeys/A Certain Romance\n\nKicking things off today are British indie rock band Arctic Monkeys, founded in Sheffield, England in 2002 by three 16-year-old friends: Alex Turner (lead vocals, guitar), Andy Nicholson (bass) and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals), together with Jamie Cook (guitar, keyboards). After starting out as an instrumental band, Turner became their lead singer and frontman. Arctic Monkeys are regarded as one of the first bands who effectively used social media to boost their popularity. They also hold the distinction to have released the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not. Off that January 2006 album, here’s the great closer A Certain Romance, credited to all members of the band.\n\nNeko Case/Hold On, Hold On\n\nSinger-songwriter Neko Case began her career in the mid-’90s, playing drums in various, mostly punk-oriented bands before launching a country-influenced solo project, Neko Case & Her Boyfriends, who debuted in 1997 with the album The Virginian. That same year, she also became part of indie rock collective The New Pornographers and remains a member to this day. She also continued solo work and in March 2006 released her fourth album Fox Confessor Brings the Flood. I decided to pick the captivating Hold On, Hold On.\n\nBand of Horses/The Funeral\n\nSeattle indie rock band Band of Horses have been around since 2004. By the time their debut album Everything All the Time appeared in March 2006, they already had seen various line-up changes. Singer-songwriter Ben Bridwell (lead vocals, guitar, pedal steel, keyboards) was the only remaining co-founding member and still is to this day. Here’s The Funeral, which also became the album’s first single. The stunning sound of the song, which is credited to the entire band, drew me in right away.\n\nThe Replacements/Message to the Boys\n\nThis brings me to the 2006 song pick by Max who always has cool stuff up his sleeve. Message to the Boys by The Replacements is no different! Max has covered the self-sabotaging punk-turned-alternative rock group various times on his blog and brought them on my radar screen. Formed in Minneapolis, Minn. in 1979, they released all of their seven studio albums during their initial run that lasted until 1991. Message to the Boys, penned by lead vocalist and guitarist Paul Westerberg, was a previously unreleased song included on a greatest hits compilation, Don’t You Know Who I Think I Was?, which came out in June 2006 – 15 years after the group’s first breakup. They would reunite in 2012 before disbanding for good three years later.\n\nJohn Mayer/Waiting On the World to Change\n\nWhen I was heard this next song by John Mayer, I was convinced it’s a cover. While I had known Mayer as a decent songwriter and a great guitarist, I simply didn’t think he had so much soul in him. Waiting On the World to Change, the opener of Mayer’s third studio album Continuum from September 2006, sounds like it could have been written by Marvin Gaye or Curtis Mayfield. I loved it right away!\n\nAmy Winehouse/Rehab\n\nThe last song pick for 2006 is Rehab by British singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse. With her distinct contralto vocals and style that blended different genres like soul, R&B and jazz, she was one of the UK’s biggest vocalists during the 2000s. Rehab, written by Winehouse, is an autobiographical song about her refusal to enter rehab for alcohol addiction. It became the lead single of her second and sadly final album Back to Black, released in October 2006. In July 2011, Winehouse died at age 27 from what was ruled an accidental alcohol overdose.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Acclaimed Music; YouTube; Spotify\n\nNew Music Musings\n\nRiverman, Apifera, Cody Dickinson, The Story So Far, Emilíana Torrini and Fastball\n\nIt’s Saturday and like in much of the U.S. elsewhere, it’s been toasty in my neck of the woods in central New Jersey. If you’re hit by the current heat wave as well, I hope you stay cool and are ready to listen to some new music! All picks are from albums released yesterday (June 21) except for the first, which dropped on June 20.\n\nRiverman/Summer Up\n\nWhile my area has had summer weather for some time, the season’s official start in the Northern Hemisphere, i.e., the summer solstice, just happened, on June 20. So what could be a better way to kick off this post than with Summer Up by Riverman, the moniker of North Carolina-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Steve Hedrick. He writes, records, produces and performs all of his music himself. Some of his favorite artists include Brian Wilson, Nick Drake, Jeff Buckley, Prefab Sprout, Stephen Sondheim, João Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim. Riverman’s entire new album, Summer Up/Summer Down, is dedicated to the season. I dig the laid back and upbeat vibe of Summer Up.\n\nApifera/Iris is Neil\n\nApifera are a four-piece from Los Angeles, who according to their Bandcamp profile meld their different musical backgrounds into an ever-evolving style that moves between genres. They debuted in January 2021 with Overstand, an alternative jazz-oriented album. Off their new sophomore release Keep the Outside Open, here’s the opener Iris is Neil. Credited to each of the members – Nitai Hershkovits, Yuvi Havkin (Rejoicer), Amir Bresler and Yonatan Albalak – other than it has a psychedelic, experimental feel, the song is tricky to characterize – not something you often hear, but I find it intriguing!\n\nCody Dickinson/Walk Right In (feat. Tikyra Jackson)\n\nCody Dickinson is a Mississippi-based musician and producer, who first gained prominence as a member of North Mississippi Allstars, a blues and southern rock band he co-founded in 1996. His credits as a producer include a wide range of artists, such as Lucero, Cisco Adler and Ian Siegal. In addition, Dickinson has contributed to several motion picture soundtracks like Barnyard, Snoop’s Hood of Horror and Black Snake Moan. Now he can add another accomplishment to his impressive credits: Homemade, his debut solo album. Here’s the fun blues rocker Walk Right In. It features Tikyra Jackson, drummer and backing vocalist of Southern Avenue, one of my favorite contemporary bands I’ve covered on multiple occasions, most recently here and here.\n\nThe Story So Far/All This Time\n\nThe Story So Far are a band blending punk rock and pop, formed in Walnut Creek, Calif. in 2007. Their current core line-up includes co-founders Parker Cannon (lead vocals), Kevin Geyer (lead guitar, vocals, keyboards) and Ryan Torf (drums, percussion, bass, guitar), along with Will Levy (guitar, backing vocals). Their debut studio album Under Soil and Dirt came out in June 2011. Off their fifth and latest, I Want to Disappear, here’s All This Time, credited to all members. Punk rock that’s easy on the ears – not a bad proposition!\n\nEmilíana Torrini/Black Lion Lane\n\nEmilíana Torrini (full name: Emilíana Torrini Davíðsdóttir) is a singer-songwriter from Iceland. Blending folk, electronica, trip hop and chamber pop, she’s best known for her 2009 single Jungle Drum, her 1999 album Love in the Time of Science and her performance of Gollum’s Song for the 2002 film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. That said, Torrini is all new to me. Her seventh and latest studio album is titled Miss Flower. Here’s Black Lion Lane. There’s just something seductive about her airy vocals that drew me in.\n\nFastball/Rather Be Me Than You\n\nI’m pleased to wrap up this week’s new music review with Fastball. For many years, I only had known of the alternative-rock-turned-power pop band from Texas because of their big 1998 hit The Way. It wasn’t until two years ago that I took a closer look and realized there’s more to the picture than the group’s best-known song. Off their ninth and latest studio album Sonic Ranch, here’s Rather Be Me Than You. The catchy pop rock song was co-written by Miles Zuniga (vocals, guitar) and Tony Scalzo (vocals, bass guitar, keyboards, guitar) who together with Joey Shuffield (drums, percussion) formed the group in Austin in 1994 and remain their core members.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Consequence; Apifera Bandcamp page; Apple Music; Wild Yaks Bandcamp page; Cody Dickinson website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nThe Sunday Six\n\nCelebrating music with six random tracks at a time\n\nIt’s Sunday and hard to believe another week has flown by. On the upside, this means the time has come again to embark on a little imaginary music time travel excursion. As always, the itinerary includes six stops in six different decades with music in different flavors.\n\nLester Young/I Can’t Get Started\n\nThis first pick, which takes us back to 1956, was inspired by fellow blogger and jazz connoisseur Cincinnati Babyhead, aka. CB, who the other reminded me of Lester Young. Nicknamed The President, the tenor saxophonist and occasional clarinetist was active between 1933 and 1959. Young first gained prominence as a member of Count Basie’s orchestra. I Can’t Get Started, initially a 1936 composition by Vernon Duke with lyrics by Ira Gershwin, was included on Young’s 1956 album The President Plays With the Oscar Peterson Trio. This smooth music is perfect to ease us into the trip!\n\nRamones/Blitzkrieg Bop\n\nHey! Ho! Let’s go! To April 1976, which saw the eponymous debut album by New York punk rockers Ramones. They had formed two years earlier in the Queens neighborhood of Forest Hills. The band originally featured lead vocalist Jeffrey Hyman (Joey Ramone), guitarist and backing vocalist John Cummings (Johnny Ramone), bassist and backing vocalist Douglas Colvin (Dee Dee Ramone) and drummer Thomas Erdelyi (Tommy Ramone). Blitzkrieg Bop, co-written by Tommy and Dee Dee, was the band’s debut single. This fun music is my kind of punk rock. One, two, three, four!\n\nGary Moore/Story of the Blues\n\nTime for some blistering electric blues with a nice soul touch by Gary Moore. Prior to releasing his solo debut Back on the Streets in 1978, the Northern Irish guitarist played with Irish bands Skid Row and Thin Lizzy. By the time he released his ninth solo album After Hours in March 1992, Moore had comfortably settled on blues and blues rock, which remained his main musical focus until his untimely death from a heart attack at age 58 in February 2011. Here’s Story of the Blues, a song he wrote.\n\nGregg Allman/Black Muddy River\n\nOur next stop takes us down south and to the present century. In March 2016, Gregg Allman recorded what would become his final album Southern Blood. Initially, the Allman Brothers co-founder had planned a sequel to his 2011 solo album Low Country Blues with original songs. But Allman who had been diagnosed with liver cancer in 2012 was running short of time, so he worked with his manager Michael Lehman to pick “meaningful” songs to cover. Southern Blood was recorded over just nine days at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Ala. The album was released in September 2017, four months after his death. Speaking of the Allmans, on Thursday, Dickey Betts passed away from cancer and COPD, leaving drummer Jaimoe (John Lee Johnson) as the former group’s only surviving co-founding member. Here’s Allman’s incredible rendition of the Grateful Dead’s Black Muddy River, co-written by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter.\n\nThe Hollies/Bus Stop\n\nI always get weirdly emotional when listening to music from Southern Blood, so my next proposition is more upbeat. Enter a catchy ’60s song with sweet harmony vocals: Bus Stop by The Hollies. Initially formed in the late ’50s as duo comprised of Allan Clarke (vocals, guitar) and Graham Nash (vocals, guitar), they became The Hollies in December 1962, together with Vic Steele (lead guitar), Eric Haydock (bass) and Don Rathbone (drums). Bus Stop, released in June 1966 and penned by future 10cc member Graham Gouldman, was one of the group’s biggest hit singles and was also the title track of their fourth U.S. album. The Hollies exist to this day as a touring act and most recently were on the road in the UK last year. Tony Hicks and Bobby Elliott, who played guitar and drums, respectively, on Bus Stop, are part of the current line-up.\n\nScorpions/Bad Boys Running Wild\n\nAnd just as this trip is in full swing, we need to wrap up again. Let’s push the pedal to the metal with Scorpions and the great opener of March 1984’s Love at First Sting. The German metal band’s ninth studio album cemented their status as an internationally popular act. With approximately 3.5 million sold units worldwide, Love at First Sting became their second-highest seller after Crazy World (November 1990). Initially were formed in 1965, Scorpiona continue to rock on and are currently on the road. Here’s Bad Boys Running Wild, with music composed by guitarist and co-founder Rudolf Schenker and lyrics written by lead vocalist Klaus Meine and then-drummer Herman Rarebell.\n\nOf course, I wouldn’t leave you without a Spotify playlist of the above track. Hope sometimes tickles your fancy and that you’ll be back for more!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nThe Sunday Six\n\nCelebrating music with six random tracks at a time\n\nHappy Sunday and, to those celebrating, Happy Easter! Once again, I’d like to invite you to join me on another imaginary travel through time and space to visit some great music of the past and the present. Let’s all have some fun together!\n\nSonny Rollins Quartet/When Your Lover Has Gone\n\nAs has become customary, we’ll kick off our journey with some beautiful jazz by the Sonny Rollins Quartet. After tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins had worked with Miles Davis and been part of the trumpeter’s band, he asked the members of Davis’ “First Great Quintet” – John Coltrane (tenor saxophone), Red Garland (piano), Paul Chambers (double bass) and Philly Joe Jones (drums) – to back him on an album titled Tenor Madness and released in October 1956. Here’s When Your Lover Has Gone, a 1931 composition by Einar Aaron Swan. The tune became a jazz standard after it had been featured in Blonde Crazy, a picture released the same year, starring James Cagney.\n\nThe Damned/Stranger On the Town\n\nLet’s pick up the speed and next head to October 1982, which saw the release of Strawberries, the fifth studio album by The Damned. AllMusic notes they were the first UK band to release a punk single (New Rose) in 1976, followed by the first UK punk album (Damned Damned Damned) the following year. Subsequently, they also began incorporating psychedelic and garage rock into their music. And other genres. Stranger On the Town, a track from Strawberries and another great tip from my dear longtime German music friend Gerd, has a cool soul vibe. The song is credited to band members Rat Scabies (drums, synthesizer), Captain Sensible (guitar, backing vocals, Paul Gray (bass) and Dave Vanian (lead vocals).\n\nSouthern Avenue/Be The Love You Want\n\nTime to jump back to the present and pay a visit to one of my favorite contemporary bands: Southern Avenue. The group from Memphis, Tenn., which has been around since 2015, blends blues and soul with flavors of contemporary R&B. Southern Avenue are Israeli blues guitarist Ori Naftaly; lead vocalist Tierinii Jackson and her sisters Tikyra Jackson (drums, backing vocals) and Ava Jackson (backing vocals); bassist Evan Sarver; and keyboarder Jeremy Powell. Be The Love You Want, co-written by the group’s co-founders Naftaly and Tierinii Jackson, is the title track of their third and most recent studio album. Released in August 2021, I reviewed it here at the time.\n\nThe Doors/The End\n\nThis next stop takes us back to January 1967 and the eponymous debut album by The Doors. My proposition is the epic closer The End. The bone-chilling lyrics, which as usual were written by lead vocalist Jim Morrison, initially revolved around the break-up with an ex-girlfriend but grew more complex over time with Oedipal themes of loving the mother and killing the father. Songfacts notes Morrison always remained vague about the meaning. The hypnotizing music was credited to the entire group who in addition to Morrison included Ray Manzarek (organ, piano, bass), Robby Krieger (guitar) and John Densmore (drums).\n\nMatthew Sweet/Girlfriend\n\nThe most recent occasion we stopped by Matthew Sweet on The Sunday Six dates back to late January 2023. I’d say it’s time for another visit. In October 1991, the alternative rock/power pop singer-songwriter put out his third studio album Girlfriend. It was the first that made the charts in the U.S., reaching no. 100 on the Billboard 200. While Sweet subsequently had higher-charting albums, Girlfriend was certified Gold (500,000 certified sold units) by RIAA in April 1995, becoming the first of two to date. Here’s the title track.\n\nPink Floyd/Time\n\nOnce again, we’re reaching our sixth and final stop. Let’s make it count with what I feel is an amazing track from one of the sonically most compelling albums I know: The Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd’s gem from March 1973. I could go on gushing about it but trust you know what I’m talking about. It’s hard to believe this music is 51 years old. Here’s the mighty Time, credited to all four band members Roger Waters (vocals, bass, VCS 3 synthesizer), David Gilmour (guitars, vocals), Richard Wright (organ, piano, synthesizers, vocals) and Nick Mason (drums, percussion).\n\nWhat’s missing? Of course, the Spotify playlist featuring all of the above goodies. Here you go and hope to see you again!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; Songfacts; YouTube; Spotify\n\nThe Sunday Six\n\nCelebrating music with six random tracks at a time\n\nGood morning/afternoon/evening/night – regardless in which time zone you are, I hope you’re feeling great. If you live in a U.S. state that observes daylight savings time and forgot to adjust your watch, don’t worry, you didn’t miss the departure of the magical music time machine that once again will take us to six different tracks from six different decades and in different flavors.\n\nMichael Brecker/Midnight Mood\n\nFor our first stop today, we’ll stay in the current century with soothing jazz by saxophone great Michael Brecker. Between 1969 until his untimely death in 2007 at the age of 57, he collaborated with many music artists outside the pure jazz realm, such as Steely Dan, Dire Straits, Joni Mitchell, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon. While Brecker’s recording career as a sideman started in 1969, his solo eponymous debut album didn’t appear until 1987. Midnight Mood, composed by Austrian jazz fusion keyboarder and Weather Report co-founder Joe Zawinul, is from Brecker’s June 2002 studio album Nearness of You: The Ballad Book.\n\nThe Replacements/Can’t Hardly Wait\n\nNext we shall head to July 1987, which saw the release of the fifth studio album by The Replacements, arguably one of the best and most influential rock & roll bands of the ’80s despite repeated acts of self-sabotage that hindered their success in the music industry. Pleased to Meet Me, the only album recorded by group as a trio, was well received by critics. In addition to its punk roots, the band got into other genres like soul and jazz. A case in point is Can’t Hardly Wait, penned by Paul Westerberg and featuring ex-Box Tops and Big Star vocalist Alex Chilton on guitar.\n\nHank Williams/Honky Tonk Blues\n\nOur next stop takes us all the way back to September 1952 and Moanin’ the Blues, the sophomore album by Hank Williams. Like his November 1961 debut Hank Williams Sings, it featured songs that all had been previously released as singles, including the hits Lovesick Blues, Long Gone Lonesome Blues and Honky Tonk Blues. Apparently, Honky Tonk Blues took various attempts to record between August 1947 and December 1951, making it one of the most challenging track for Williams to record. In the end, things worked out well and Honky Tonk Blues peaked at no. 2 on the U.S. Country charts.\n\nDeep Purple/Speed King\n\nTime to push the pedal to the metal with Deep Purple and a hard rock song with some of the coolest lyrics. Speed King, credited to all members of the group – Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (organ), Roger Glover (bass) and Ian Paice (drums), was on the British group’s fourth studio album Deep Purple in Rock released in June 1970. The song, which is made of lyrical bits of rock & roll hits by Little Richard, Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry, also became the albums lead single in May of the same year. Hang on to your seats – ha ha ha ha!\n\nSting/Shape of My Heart\n\nAfter some charging high-speed hard rock & roll, I think this would be an opportune moment to slow things down. For this we shall travel to March 1993 and Sting’s fourth solo studio album. Ten Summoner’s Tales is the ex-Police frontman’s Mount Rushmore, in my humble opinion. Here’s the beautiful Shape of My Heart, which Sting co-wrote with guitarist and his long-term sideman Dominic Miller. The song also became the album’s fifth single in August 1993.\n\nThe Beatles/Back In the U.S.S.R.\n\nOnce again, we’re reaching the final stop of another music excursion, which I hope you’ve enjoyed. Let’s make it count with a song by my all-time favorite band The Beatles from their self-titled November 1968 studio album, aka. The White Album: Back in the U.S.S.R.. The album’s opener was written by Paul McCartney and, as usual, credited to him and John Lennon. The song is a parody of the patriotic sentiments about the U.S. expressed in Chuck Berry’s Back in the U.S.A. and The Beach Boys’ California Girls. Take it away, lads!\n\nOf course, this post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist featuring the above tracks. So long and see you next time!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nNew Music Musings\n\nTerra Lightfoot, Tex Crick, A Beacon School, Anna Hillburg, The Menzingers and Ringo Starr\n\nHappy Saturday and welcome to the latest installment of my weekly new music review. All picks in this post are from albums and one EP, which dropped yesterday (October 13). Not a bad catch for a Friday the 13th – let’s get to it!\n\nTerra Lightfoot/Come Back Around\n\nKicking off is Canadian singer-songwriter Terra Lightfoot. Her last name begs an obvious question – no, she’s not related to the late Gordon Lightfoot but actually toured with him! The folk and roots rock-oriented artist released her self-titled debut album in 2011. In the early 2010, she also was a member of country folk group Dinner Belles and played on their 2011 and 2014 albums West Simcoe County and The River and the Willow, respectively. Lightfoot whose multi-octave mezzo-soprano singing voice has bee compared with Joan Jett and Dusty Springfield is now out with her fifth studio album Healing Power. Here’s Come Back Around, a song with less than upbeat lyrics but a bouncy vibe that drew me in.\n\nTex Crick/Silly Little Things\n\nTex Crick is an Australian singer-songwriter. From his AllMusic bio: Much like singer/songwriter forebears Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson, Australia’s Tex Crick writes melodic piano pop with a soft heart and wry intelligence. Rising from small town roots on the country’s south coast, he cut his teeth in the mid-2010s as a touring keyboardist for artists like Kirin J. Callinan, Iggy Pop, and Weyes Blood before a chance encounter with Mac DeMarco in New York led to the release of his solo debut. Off Crick’s sophomore and latest album Sweet Dreamin’, here’s Silly Little Things, which like all other tracks was solely written by him. I love his smooth delivery!\n\nA Beacon School/Alone\n\nA Beacon School is a dream pop project of New York-based songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Patrick J. Smith, which he started in 2009. His music has included uptempo jangly pop, lush shoegaze and intricately-arranged electronic soundscapes. In addition to his solo efforts, Smith has played with bands like Modern Rivals and Bluffing, and currently is a member of Maxband, which also features Max Savage of Parquet Courts, both rocks bands from New York. Off Yoyo, Smith’s first full-length album in five years, here’s Alone. I find the song’s dreamy sound pretty soothing.\n\nAnna Hillburg/How Do You Make Believe\n\nAnna Hillburg is a San Francisco-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who has spent several decades making music in the Bay Area. Here’s more from her bio: As a singer, songwriter, trumpet, guitar, drum, and bass player she has contributed to acts such as Shannon and The Clams, The Dodos, The Moore Brothers, Will Sprott, Dream Date, Greg Ashley, Shannon Shaw and her All Star Buddy Band, and more. Hillburg’s eponymous debut album from 2013 was followed by her 2018 sophomore release Really Real. From her third and latest album Tired Girls, here’s How Do You Make Believe. Neat song!\n\nThe Menzingers/Take It to Heart\n\nThe Menzingers are a punk rock band from Scranton, Pa. who have been around since 2006. I first came across them in February 2022 when co-founding vocalist and guitarist Greg Barnett released his debut solo album. Since their first full length album A Lesson in the Abuse of Information Technology came out in July 2007, The Menzingers have released seven additional studio albums, including their latest, Some of It Was True. Here’s the great sounding Take It to Heart, credited to all four members of the group who apart from Barnett include Tom May (guitar, vocals), Eric Keen (bass) and Joe Godino (drums).\n\nRingo Starr/Rewind Forward\n\nI’m thrilled to wrap up this post with new music by Ringo Starr, who at 83 years young keeps rockin’, on the road with his All-Starr Band, and in the studio with a little help from great friends. He just released Rewind Forward, his fourth EP since Zoom In (March 2021). The title track was written with his engineer, and oft co-writer, Bruce Sugar, notes Starr’s website. “We’ve been writing a song now for every EP,” said Ringo. “Rewind Forward was just one of those things I say and it made sense in the moment. Like a Hard Days Night – I thought, why don’t we just Rewind Forward? To make sense of it, sometimes it is good to go back and move forward from a place you left off, you don’t ever have to live in the past but it is good to check it occasionally.” And, yes, I wasn’t kidding, Ringo just wrapped up a fall tour with his All-Starr Band. I just love this man!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; A Beacon School Bandcamp page; Anna Hillburg website; Ringo Starr website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nNew Music Musings\n\nDiamond Dogs, Andrew Cushin, No-No Boy, The Vaughns, The Atom Age and Wilco\n\nHappy Saturday and welcome to the latest installment of my weekly new music revue. All picks are from albums that came out yesterday (September 29).\n\nDiamond Dogs/Get a Rock ‘n’ Roll Record\n\nDiamond Dogs are a Swedish rock band initially formed in the late 1990s. Wikipedia notes their line-up has seen various changes over time, and the band announced their break-up in September 2015. They since reformed and based on a recent Facebook post, co-founder and vocalist Sören ‘Sulo’ Karlsson is part of the group’s current line-up. From Diamond Dog’s 15th and latest album About the Hardest Nut to Crack, here’s the great Get a Rock ‘n’ Roll Record – the title says it all!\n\nAndrew Cushin/Just Like You’d Want Me To\n\nAndrew Cushin is an up-and-coming singer-songwriter from the UK who first emerged in October 2020 with Where’s My Family Gone, a song for which he had teamed up with ex-Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher, as NME reported at the time. Cushin is now out with his debut album Waiting For the Rain. Here’s the excellent Just Like You’d Want Me To, which also became the sixth upfront single. “It’s a song about resilience, hope and inner belief, standing tall and knowing that better days are gonna come,” Cushin said in a statement included in a recent review by NME. The 23-year-old certainly is off to a promising start!\n\nNo-No Boy/Little Monk\n\nNo-No Boy is a music project by Asian-American singer-songwriter Julian Saporiti. His website explains, The project developed as the central component of Saporiti’s PhD at Brown University, drawing on years of fieldwork and research on Asian American history to write folk songs with uncommon empathy and remarkable protagonists: prisoners at Japanese American internment camps who started a jazz band, Vietnamese musicians turned on to rock ‘n’ roll by American troops, a Cambodian American painter who painted only the most beautiful landscapes of his war-torn home. Off his third album Empire Electric, here’s Little Monk. It’s impossible to do this unusual artist full justice here, so I encourage you to check out his website.\n\nThe Vaughns/Turn Around\n\nThe Vaughns are an indie rock band from Springfield, N.J. who were formed in 2014 after their members had met in high school. Their eponymous debut EP appeared in August of the same year. After another EP, they independently issued their first full-length album F.O.M.O. in May 2019. The following year, they signed with Equal Vision Records and are now out with their sophomore album Egg Everything. Here’s Turn Around, a nice song written by co-founding members Anna Lies (vocals, guitar, synth) and Ryan Kenter (drums, percussion). Jordan Smith (guitar, vocals) and Brian Hughes (bass, vocals) complete the band’s current line-up.\n\nThe Atom Age/New Season\n\nThe Atom Age are a punk band from Oakland, Calif., who have been around since 2009. They describe their sound as follows: A rocket propelled ode to the unhinged power of ‘60s punk and R&B, the Age are more Sonics than Hives, and more Link Wray than Jack White. From their eponymous fifth and latest album, here’s New Season, a charging punk rocker with a garage vibe!\n\nWilco/Evicted\n\nWhile I imagine the previous bands and artists may be new to many readers, Wilco is likely a more familiar name. The Chicago alt. country-turned-alternative rock band around Jeff Tweedy emerged in 1994 as one of two groups following the break-up of alt. country outfit Uncle Tupelo. Tweedy’s former bandmate Jay Farrar went on to form Son Volt. Wilco’s new album, their 13th, is called Cousin. Here’s Evicted, which like all other tracks was penned by Tweedy. It had first appeared as a single on August 1.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Diamond Dogs Facebook page; NME; No-No Boy website; The Atom Age website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nNew Music Musings\n\nMason Jennings, MxPx, Sonny & The Sunsets, Ratboys, Old Crow Medicine Show and Alice Cooper\n\nHappy Saturday and welcome to the latest installment of my weekly new music review. All picks are included on albums that appeared yesterday (August 25).\n\nMason Jennings/Fear Is Wrong\n\nMason Jennings, who was born in Hawaii, is a Minneapolis-based roots and folk-oriented singer-songwriter who began playing guitar and writing songs when he was 13. AllMusic notes he blends the personal insights of a poet, the political broadsides of a protest singer, and the broad musical eclecticism of a jazz musician with a rock & roller’s passion. Since his self-released eponymous debut in June 1997, 15 additional studio albums have come out, including his latest, Underneath the Roses. Here’s the great Fear Is Wrong.\n\nMxPx/Stay Up All Night\n\nMxPx are a punk rock band from Bremerton, Wash., who were founded as Magnified Plaid in 1992 by 15-year-old high school students Mike Herrera (lead vocals, bass), Yuri Ruley (drums, percussion) and Andy Husted (lead guitar). Herrera and Ruley remain part of the current line-up, which also includes Tom Wisniewski (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Chris Adkins (rhythm guitar, backing vocals). To date, MxPx have released 14 studio albums. From their latest, Find a Way Home, here’s the melodic Stay Up All Night, written by Herrera.\n\nSonny & The Sunsets/Androids\n\nSonny & The Sunsets are a San Francisco-based band around songwriter, author, filmmaker and visual artist Sonny Smith. According to the group’s Bandcamp page, their busted beach-pop songs spark recollections of doo wop’s otherworldly despair, a dose of goofball humor from the Michael Hurley school, and positive possibilities exuded by Jonathan Richman. Sonny & The Sunsets’ full-length debut Tomorrow Is Alright appeared in 2009. Off their new album Self Awareness Through Macrame, here’s Androids.\n\nRatboys/Morning Zoo\n\nChicago-based indie rock band Ratboys were formed in 2010 by songwriters and then-Notre Dame students Julia Steiner (guitar, vocals) and Dave Sagan (guitar). The group also includes Sean Neumann (bass, vocals) and Marcus Nuccio (drums). In June 2015, they released their debut album AOID. Their fifth and latest album is titled The Window. Here’s Morning Zoo, a catchy tune credited to all four members of the band.\n\nOld Crow Medicine Show/One Drop\n\nOld Crow Medicine Show are a Nashville, Tenn.-based Americana string band formed in 1998. According to their Apple Music profile, they have influenced a generation of 21st-century roots musicians with their infectious mix of hollers, jug band favorites, and pre-rock ’n’ roll blues. I first featured them in this new music review from April 2022 with a tune from their then-latest album Paint This Town. One Drop featuring the great Mavis Staples is from their latest release Jubilee, an appropriate title as the band celebrates their 25th anniversary\n\nAlice Cooper/Welcome to the Show\n\nMy final pick for this week is by an artist who I trust doesn’t need much of an introduction. At 75 years and after a 50-year-plus recording career, Alice Cooper continues to shock rock. Following seven albums with the band of the same name, Cooper launched his solo career in 1975 with the release of the cheerfully titled the Welcome to My Nightmare. From his 22nd and latest solo album Road, which was recorded with his touring band live-in-studio, here’s Welcome to the Show – now, that’s what a call an upbeat title!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; Mason Jennings website; MxPx website; Sonny & The Sunsets Bandcamp page; Ratboys website; Old Crow Medicine Show website; Alice Cooper website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nThe Sunday Six\n\nCelebrating music with six random tracks at a time\n\nHappy Sunday and hope you’re in the mood to join me in the magical time machine to visit music of the past and the present. As always, our trip will have six stops, and it starts right now!\n\nChet Baker Quartet/Tasty Pudding\n\nToday, our journey begins 1955 with some delicious jazz by the Chet Baker Quartet. The American jazz trumpeter and vocalist, aka “Prince of Cool,” is renowned for major innovations in cool jazz. The recording of Tasty Pudding, which is included on a 1956 album titled Chet Baker in Paris Vol. 3 1955, falls into the period, during which Baker earned much attention. Due to heroin addiction and frequent incarceration, his career subsequently declined before Baker enjoyed a resurgence in the late ’70s and ’80s until his untimely death in May 1988 at age 58.\n\nNaked Eyes/Always Something There to Remind Me\n\nThis next pick may surprise some of you. Yes, it’s an ’80s synth-pop tune, but I’m a sucker for memorable melodies, and to me, this song is an earworm. In January 1983, British new wave act Naked Eyes released their debut single, a version of Always Something There to Remind Me. Co-written by songwriting powerhouse Burt Bacharach and Hal David, the tune was originally recorded as a demo by Dionne Warwick in 1963. American soul vocalist and pianist Lou Johnson releases the first charting rendition in 1964. Later that year, English pop singer Sandie Shaw took the tune to no. 1 in the UK. Naked Eyes’ rendition, which also appeared on their first album Burning Bridges, didn’t do badly either, especially outside the UK: No. 2 in New Zealand, no. 7 in Australia and no. 8 in each the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Lemon Pipers/Through With You\n\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: No Sunday Six trip can be without a stop in the ’60s as long as I’m the conductor of the time machine. The Lemon Pipers were a short-lived rock band from Oxford, Ohio. They only issued two albums during their less than 3-year run. Through With You is the hot closer of their February 1968 debut album Green Tambourine, which is best known for its title cut. The psychedelic extended track we’re visiting today was written by lead guitarist Bill Bartlett. Yes, it’s long, but it’s a pretty cool tune with a Byrds vibe.\n\nThe Front Bottoms/Punching Bag\n\nTime to go back to the present with New Jersey rock band The Front Bottoms. Since their formation in 2007, they have released eight albums to date. Off their latest, You Are Who You Hang Out With released on August 4, here’s Punching Bag. The tune was co-written by the group’s current core members and co-founders Brian Sella (vocals, guitar) and Mathew Uychich (drums).\n\nMink DeVille/Spanish Stroll\n\nNext, we shall go back to 1977 and a great tune by Mink DeVille. The group around singer-songwriter Willy DeVille blended elements of punk rock, roots rock, soul, R&B, Cajun, Blues and Latin – how’s that for trying to stick them into a genre? Spanish Stroll, penned by DeVille, is a track from the group’s debut album Cabretta, which appeared in the U.S. as Mink DeVille. They would go on to record five additional albums before disbanding in 1985. DeVille subsequently launched a solo career and continued to record until February 2008, about 1.5 years prior to his early death at age 58 from pancreatic cancer.\n\nTom Faulkner/When You Call Upon the Heart\n\nOnce again, we’re reaching our final destination. This time, our trip ends in April 1997 with great music by American singer-songwriter Tom Faulkner. If you’re a frequent Sunday Six music time traveler the name may sound familiar. Otherwise, maybe not, since Faulkner isn’t exactly a household name. To date, he has only released two albums. His most recent one, Raise the Roof, appeared in 2002. For the most part, Faulkner has made his living with commercial music for radio and TV. When You Call Upon the Heart is a tune from his first album, Lost In the Land of Texico, a true treasure trove!\n\nOf course, this post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist. Hope there’s something for you!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nNew Music Musings\n\nAllegra Krieger, The Oxys, The Arcadian Wild, Blur, Cut Worms and Greta Van Fleet\n\nHappy Saturday with ch-ch-ch-changes to my weekly look at new music. Hope you like the updated format! All picks are from albums that came out yesterday (July 21).\n\nAllegra Krieger/Lingering\n\nAllegra Krieger is a New York-based singer-songwriter and composer. She describes her songs as “at once cathartic and compelling,” with “emotive lyricism and explorative harmony.” Off her fourth album, I Keep My Feet On the Fragile Plane, here’s Lingering, which was solely penned by her.\n\nThe Oxys/Mr. Horrible\n\nAustin, Texas-based punk rock band The Oxys were formed in 2020 during the peak of the pandemic. Mr. Horrible, a song about deceased Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious, appears on their sophomore album Generation Irrelevant. It was written by the group’s guitarist Jason “Ginchy” Kottwitz.\n\nThe Arcadian Wild/Shoulders\n\nLed by songwriters Isaac Horn (acoustic guitar, vocals) and Lincoln Mick (mandolin, vocals), with Bailey Warren on fiddle, The Arcadian Wild from Nashville, Tenn. have their roots in formal vocal music and influences from progressive bluegrass and folk. From their new full-length album Welcome, here’s Shoulders.\n\nBlur/St. Charles Square\n\nBrit pop band Blur have been around since 1988. The Ballad of Darren is their ninth studio album and first since an 8-year hiatus. St. Charles Square is credited to all four members of the London-based group: Alex James (bass), Damon Albarn (vocals), Dave Rowntree (drums) and Graham Coxon (guitar).\n\nCut Worms/Don’t Fade Out\n\nCut Worms is the moniker of singer-songwriter Max Clarke who hails from Ohio and is currently based in Brooklyn, New York. According to his AllMusic bio, he blends early rock, country and Americana with a “contemporary D.I.Y spirit and lush arrangements.” Don’t Fade Out is a track from Cut Worms, Clarke’s third and latest studio album.\n\nGreta Van Fleet/The Falling Sky\n\nClosing out this post are Frankenmuth, Mich. rockers Greta Van Fleet whose sound has been compared to early Led Zeppelin since they emerged in 2012. The Falling Sky is off their third full-length studio album Starcatcher. The tune is credited to band members, brothers Joshua Kiszka (lead vocals), Jacob Kiszka (guitar, backing vocals) and Samuel Kiszka (bass, keyboards, backing vocals) and Daniel Wagner (drums, backing vocals), as well as co-producer Dave Cobb.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Allegra Krieger website; The Oxys Bandcamp page; The Arcadian Wild website; Cut Worms website; AllMusic; YouTube; Spotify"
