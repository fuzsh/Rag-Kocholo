        "text": "Screeching Weasel is an all time favorite band of mine. If not my number one, then definitely in the top three. They are responsible for classic albums like My Brain Hurts and Anthem for a New Tomorrow. With Green Day, they set the tone for the Lookout Records pop punk sound that became the blue print for bands to follow for years.\n\nThe Screeching Weasel line up has changed over and over throughout the course of the band’s history but the one constant is founder and front man, Ben Weasel. Weasel is a force of nature and has a history of being a lightening rod for controversy. Never one to back down from sharing his thoughts and opinions, Weasel has developed a reputation for being a prickly pear. Ask him the wrong question and the result will likely be a steady diet of ridicule. In the school of punk rock, Weasel is an ivy league professor demanding greatness from his student audience.\n\nI admit that the thought of interviewing Weasel was both exciting and stressful. Many have said that meeting your heroes is dangerous as many times they fail to live up to the your expectations. Although I had a million questions for Weasel, I felt like each one had the potential to unleash his verbal slings and arrows upon me. Whether he would like me to admit it or not, I am here to report that Ben Weasel was nothing short of amazing to speak with. He was insightful, measured in his responses, and willing to discuss every question that I asked. He was also gracious with his time allowing me over two hours to converse with him. I gambled on the potential to damage the esteem I hold for a band that has meant more to me than any other in order to bring you this interview. It is with complete and utter happiness that I can say that after speaking with Ben Weasel, my love for his art has only increased and the passion I have for Screeching Weasel’s music has been solidified.\n\nHow do you measure success on a personal level?\n\nI am extremely fortunate and I still have no idea how it happened. I don’t have to go to some job that I hate which is good for me because I have no real job skills, unless you need someone to write you a song. Otherwise, you’d be out of luck. I honestly don’t really think about it. In my younger days when I was insecure, I always wanted more. Sometimes I wasn’t even sure of what it was that I wanted. I was sure what I didn’t want but I don’t think I was sure of what it was that I did want. That’s not the case anymore. I’m happy where I’m at. Yeah, it would be nice if the music industry was different but it’s always been that way. It’s always been a mess since it started. It changes over time and the changes are ones that are never beneficial to the ones making the music but that’s part of the deal. If you can’t work within that scenario, then you are going to go nuts. Honestly, I feel very fortunate. I have been able to earn a living off of a bunch of dumb punk rock songs. I go out and play the songs and people clap and then afterward they want to shake my hand and tell me how great I am. I don’t know what there is to complain about. If that’s not success, then I don’t know. It’s something I am very happy with.\n\nWas there a mindshift you had to make when you starting having a family?\n\nNo, I’m not super-duper punk rock guy. I have the stage presence of a high school science teacher. I am not up there like the coolest guy up on the stage so there’s nothing to reconcile at all.\n\nHow old are your kids?\n\nI have 10 year old twin girls and an 8 year old boy.\n\nAre they familiar with Screeching Weasel’s music?\n\nThey were listening to the new album today. One daughter was saying, “I’m dad” and was pretending to use a microphone to sing on stage while my other daughter was pretending to play the guitar. It’s the first time I have ever seen them do something like that. They are into their own stuff. My daughters like a lot of pop and stuff like that and my son is mostly into classical music and has been since he was very young. He has an ambition to be a composer. They all play instruments. I have two piano players and a violinist. They don’t play rock music but if they ever want to, that’s fine.\n\nWhen I do the dad thing and say to them, you’ve got to hear this, it’s almost always the stuff that I grew up on. Like 70s rock and metal. Outside of the Ramones I don’t think I have ever… oh, I did play them, ‘I Can’t Stop Farting’ by the Queers which I thought was relevant.\n\nWhen we play shows in the Midwest, I will bring them to shows. It is important to me that they understand that musicians and performers aren’t special untouchable people. They are just regular people who often have families and live lives like everyone else. It may be a little bit different kind of life in terms of their work. But I want them to grow up without the wrong ideas and unhealthy ideas that people have about celebrity. You know, we even see it on our little level. It’s funny, I don’t get it, why people want me to sign things and stuff but they do. I think it is important to teach the kids. And there is the flip-side of this too. We went to a concert last fall and it was a conductor from out of town who conducted a few operas that I’ve enjoyed. I saw him after the concert with my daughter and corralled him for a minute to tell him I like his work and that I really liked what he had done on the previous things I saw him conduct as well. He was clearly on his way somewhere else so I didn’t monopolize his time. But I tried to set an example of the proper way to interact with someone whose work you appreciate as opposed to getting drunk and monopolizing someone’s time. You know, all the things that people do that are based on the wrong ideas about how to interact with someone in that type of situation.\n\nHave your kids experienced a bad interaction with fans at one of your shows? Anyone who is over the top, drunk talking you, or fan-boying you?\n\nYeah, the last time we were down in Chicago, I had to tell my wife and my old drummer, Brian Vermin, to just stay with the kids until we got to the hotel. It was nobody being a jerk but just people who may have had too much to drink. I was happy to talk with them but not the type of thing that your family should be around.\n\nDo you think that having your kids experience your shows and how the fans interact with you gives them a different perspective of who their dad is or the importance of your band to people? How do your kids process people wanting your autograph or talking your ear off?\n\nI don’t know what it is like for anyone else but I downplay that all so much that I think I am pretty adamant about keeping it all in perspective. Yeah, we got fans and some people are really, really, really into it but that is not really a reflection on me personally. That’s what someone puts on you which is fine but it is a bad idea to let that go to your head. You can’t get this idea that you are really great because once you do that, then that becomes your full time job. It’s better to keep your head down and work. That’s kind of what I tell my kids. All that stuff is kind of nice now and then. It’s like candy, a little bit’s good. It’s really nice, people shake your hand and tell you that you’re great. Thank you. And you are appreciative that your work has made a difference in somebody’s life, don’t get me wrong. But I don’t think focusing on that is a good idea because when I see people focusing on that I see people not keeping up their level of work like they should.\n\nI see you have the Ramones Leave Home LP framed on your wall. Is there a story about that?\n\nGeorge Tabb gave me that a while back. It is signed by the band and their tour manager, Monte signed it on the back although I have no idea why. It’s my favorite Ramones record. He sent that to me one day and it was a very nice thing of him to do.\n\nYou were a prolific writer of columns for magazines. You have also written a book and a rock opera. Do you miss that at all or do you get your fix from doing a daily stream on YouTube and things like that now?\n\nWell, I am actually writing more now than I have in years. I just haven’t published any of it. I write quite a lot of fiction. Obviously if you think what you are doing is good, you want an audience for it so that is a consideration. But just doing the work in and of itself, is very enjoyable to me. A lot of writers will talk about how they hate writing. I am not like that and I don’t get that. I enjoy the process of writing and rewriting. It’s hard and sometimes frustrating but if you are doing creative work, you are doing a large and complex jigsaw puzzle and the great thing about it is that no matter how difficult it is you know there is a solution.\n\nI never worry about not getting the work done. It’s just a matter of… a utilitarian perspective. The work is the important thing. You can talk about artistic inspiration and that matters to some extent but none of it means anything without rolling up the old shirt sleeves and putting in the hours. That’s my focus whether it’s prose, screenplays, stage plays, essays, songs – that workman like approach is most effective for me and it enables me to enjoy it. I think it is very unwise to want or expect consolations and inspirations to be coming at you all the time. I’ve never had writer’s block in my life but I think the cure for it is – shut up and work. If you can’t, it’s because you are looking for or hoping for inspiration outside of yourself. The answer is in you and you have to work through it. You have to sit down every day and do your work.\n\nHow does the process of writing a book and a rock opera compare?\n\nIt’s hard to compare because I was a very poor writer when I wrote my novel. I didn’t have any idea what I was doing. I had a little more idea what I was doing, at least in terms of constructing a narrative when I did the opera. Of course there was another aspect to that that is never involved in writing or even in writing an album and that is writing in sequence. You can’t just throw a bunch of tunes together and fit them in. You need to have certain music things happening at certain spots to coincide with the narrative. So it’s a lot more challenging. But I have slowly become more comfortable with the concept of narrative and I have taken the time to learn and internalize the basics of storytelling and why the foundations of storytelling never change and have been there since the beginning of time.\n\nI’m not the guy who is going to go out there and subvert all that. There are people who do that and some of them are genius enough that they do it well. Most of them are very amateurish and fail. The only people who are good at that are people who can and have written in conventional ways. If you go right off the bat and try and reinvent the wheel, you are probably going to fail. To me, I think it is important to stick to the basics and trust that what you bring to the table is what’s going to carry you. But the basic building blocks of how you construct something whether it be a song, or a painting, or a screenplay or whatever it is, there is a time honored tradition and it is there for a reason. The story arcs are there for a reason and they haven’t really changed since the time of Aristotle because they work. But within that, there are an infinite variety of things you can do.\n\nAt this point, I am pretty comfortable with it and I take much more of a story telling approach in my songwriting as well than I ever did in the past. If you consider a song off the new album like, ‘She’s Ain’t Your Baby’, that is a full on and deliberately done in this style, torn from a Broadway musical type song. Maybe musically it doesn’t sound like it although in my opinion it should. If you pay attention to the lyric, the approach is very much of a character giving a lecture to another character and develops a whole comedic thing. That’s actually the only songwriting I’m comfortable with as I don’t really do much in the way of autobiographic or confessional and I haven’t for a long time because I don’t find my life that interesting. As you get older you realize that all these things that you thought was so unique to your experience are not unique at all and that you are kind of boring people. That’s the kind of stuff where people grow up and say, “My god, I can’t believe I used to listen to that stuff.” When you’re young, you’re like, oh man, I thought I was the only person in the world who felt this way. You can get to the universal a lot easier through fiction and so I seem to be writing a lot of more effectively now using that approach.\n\nTalking about the process of writing, have you read any books on the process that have helped you or shaped you as a writer?\n\nThe specific one that was a big help to me for screenwriting was The Dramatic Writer’s Companion which is a well-known book in the playwright and screenwriter community. All those books are essentially saying the same thing but in slightly different ways. Basically, they are all getting back to the concept of what a story is. I am not one to remember a whole lot of details when reading stuff like that so I kind of get things out of it and create little maxims that I then follow. Maxim number one is that these conventions are here for a reason. The structure is there for a reason. Number 2, and I believe this really strongly, is that plot comes from character. If you have good characters that is how you figure out what is going to happen. If you want to have something to have the ring of truth it is less important to get all the little technical details right than it is to have all the characters behaving in a way that the character can conceivably behave based on who they are. Well, if you are going to do that, then you have to figure out who they are. Then you throw any situation at that character and it is going to go a very different way than it would with another character. That’s kind of my number one rule – that plot for its own sake is not worth anything. Plot has to come from character. Therefore, when you are starting to conceive something and you are beginning to start outlining, your most important element that you are starting with is your characters and you have to have characters that to some degree you sympathize with even if they are really bad people. You have to be able to sympathize to the point of being able to get in their head and figure out how this person would react in a situation, what does this person want and why are they behaving the way they are behaving.\n\nThe other maxim I would go with and this is probably much less to do with constructional pieces that I have read on writing and more to with a spiritual point of view is that story and art in general is about the universal. It is about precision in execution, it is not precision in result. If everything is neatly put together and at the end of it you can say, ah-ha this is an allegory for this or this represents that and everything fits really neatly, that’s kind of a too cute by half approach. I don’t think that has the ring of truth. I think there had to be loose ends.\n\nThere’s a story in the New Testament where Christ intervenes on behalf of the woman who has committed adultery and is about to be stoned to death. Christ says, “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.” Now there are a lot of biblical scholars who would say this was probably a later addition to the scripture and didn’t happen, but for me, it has the ring of truth. And the thing that gives it a ring of truth is that at some point while this is happening, Christ sits and draws with his finger in the sand and writes something. But we don’t know what he writes and it’s never resolved. It’s those little details that just hang there can open up a lot of interesting questions about characters but also give it a ring of truth. Somehow, this is a strange detail to put in if you were making something up so I think to get those idiosyncrasies and little moments that may not add up that are part of the narrative but don’t always contribute directly to the narrative but they give the thing a little bit of life and a little bit of depth and that’s all character based.\n\nThere are a few different schools of thought on the creation of characters. One has an author create a biography for the character. Another is to write key aspects like who they are and what’s their drive. When you are creating your characters, how in depth do you get in the pre-writing and when you talk about the drive of a character, do you find that a lot of times the drive question gets resolved while you are creating the actual story or do you go in with a very solid understanding?\n\nI have done it both ways and there is something to be said for each way. I think it depends on the individual and where you are at and how clear you are on things. There are times when I have felt compelled to write very specific biographical details about a character. Some of that is stuff that will come up in plot so you have to have it down. Like how old is the character, when and where is your setting and if you are setting it at a time, what does this mean for the character and what in their biography needs to be reconciled based on this. If you are setting your story during World War II, almost certainly where the character lives whether it is North America, Europe, or Japan you are going to have to incorporate certain realities into their character.\n\nBut as you write, it is not a black and white thing. I do say that plot comes from character but when the plot starts coming, you can learn some things about your character as well because you find yourself in the position of asking yourself, how is this character going to react? And if you don’t know, that’s the time to stop and say, Ok, what more do I need to know about this character? If this character is going to behave in such and such way, does that then have any ramifications about what has come before or what will come after. And if so, you go back and edit your sheet. We all do that, we all re-write. So don’t get the idea that I am advocating for this super-structured thing that doesn’t allow for fluctuations. That’s all part of the process. But as a general rule, you want the characters’ actions to inform the plot not vice versa. If you run into spots where you don’t have the answer that should be seen not as a problem but as an opportunity to figure out a little bit more about this character and if it isn’t consistent with their behavior earlier, maybe you need to go back to the drawing board.\n\nMost writers have had the experience of a character turns out not to be who they thought they were. You have to go back and start over and realize that this character is much more interesting than the other character that I had written. I didn’t realize who this person was. It’s almost like getting to know someone better. And certain aspects of their personality are revealed and you go, wow, there’s some depth to this person that I didn’t realize was there before. If you do that, you are bound to be in good shape because people are wildly inconsistent in their behaviors but are pretty consistent in their character so if you create characters in your story that are consistent in their character then you can get away with a lot in terms of their behavior because people will relate to that and will instinctively recognize a consistency in character and they will be inclined to forgive what seemed to be on the surface inconsistencies in behavior as long as they are tied together with the consistent character traits.\n\nAre there other areas that are important when developing as a writer?\n\nFor some novelists, their early novels are very good but not yet great because the writer hasn’t yet figured out what they are good at and what they are not very good at; how to accentuate the positives and how to eliminate or reduce the negatives. If you are any good at art, the thing that people are going to be drawn to, that’s already there. It’s a matter of doing the work and doing some self-analyzing to figure out what you are good at and your strengths and weaknesses and then focusing on the correct things. I don’t think there is or should be much that you can do other than hard work to capture that indefinable muse that we are all so interested in and are so convinced is the source of everything. It’s not the source of everything. The source of everything is actually hard work because that thing I think exists in all of us or at least in those of us who do creative work. The way we get in touch with that and express that is through hard work.\n\nSo how did you apply that to being a songwriter or performing in a band? With Screeching Weasel, there are some core elements that run consistently album to album but is there anything looking retrospectively where you recall as a 20 or 25 year old being introspective enough to take some of these ideas we are talking about at our age and apply them?\n\nI had no mentor and had no idea that this was a thing that should be taken seriously. It was a pretty painful process and I had to come across a lot of it by trial and error. So I had to do a lot of bad work and there’s nothing more painful than doing bad work publicly, and I did a lot of it. There were times and it was very inconsistent, when I knew I got it and I knew I was hitting on all cylinders. There were other times when I knew I wasn’t. Then there were a lot of times when I thought I was but wasn’t. It took a lot of years and a lot of regrets to force the issue in a deliberate and conscious way to say a lot of what I am doing isn’t working and I need to clear away the cobwebs.\n\nI remember having that moment. Well, it was probably a series of moments. I remember the year and the situation where I was working on something that just wasn’t working. I was working on essentially a concept album. I finally realized that the reason why it wasn’t working was because I was indulging bad habits and not doing the things that I was good at. There were some good songs and some of those songs ended up having life in different projects. But this project wasn’t working and this was about 16 or 17 years ago, but that was the point where I realized that I have to take a different attitude about this and take it more seriously just for the sake of doing it. At that point, there wasn’t much money in it so it wasn’t a financial thing it was a thing of, how do I get better at what I am doing? How do I take what I am doing to the level that I want it to be at and why do I want it to be at that level? And there are all sorts of other questions that come with that like why do I want it to be at that level and what does that mean and how do I define success? So I had to sort out a number of things and there were certain conclusions that I came to that I was one hundred percent sure about. One, being I need a very, very, very creatively minded producer. So I got one. I need to get a lot better at doing the things I am good at and not doing the things I’m not so good at.\n\nThose were the two main things and that enabled me to see my work with a clarity that wasn’t there prior to that because I was getting all caught up with what success meant to me or what I wanted without knowing why I wanted it or what things meant in the cultural or social context or the context of my business even. I dropped all of that and my goal became to write the best songs that I can write regardless of whether or not if they sell or whether or not if people even hear them but just for the sake of whatever talent I have and getting the best out of that as I can. It has worked out very well for me since then. It’s extremely gratifying from a creative point a view and an artistic point of view so that the work that I have done since 2004, I have been almost universally very happy with. The stuff I am not as happy with, the complaints that I have about it are pretty minor.\n\nScreeching Weasel has worked with a variety of producers in the past but you have been exclusively working with Mike Kennerty (All-American Rejects) for years now. Can you talk about his influence on Screeching Weasel’s music?\n\nWhat we are doing now with Mike is pretty different than we had done with producers in the past. He understands songs and he understands what is good about my songs when they are good and what is bad about them when they are bad. I can trust him to go through everything and pick out the best parts and move forward. He might come to me, as he often does, and say, “I want to add a verse to this song.” I go, “Well, OK, but now I need to rethink the whole lyric because I had it wrapping up here but I’ll do it because I trust you and you’ve gotten good results in the past.”\n\nSo generally speaking, he has an awful lot of latitude because he’s proved himself over and over. There are times, but they don’t happen often, where I’m really adamant about doing things a certain way and I will speak up. It happens far less often than people would assume. I am pretty easy going about things like arrangements and song structures and things like that because I am aware of my strengths and these are the times where Mike is really helpful.\n\nHow did you and Mike, your producer, initially find each other?\n\nHe did a piece for a magazine where people from big popular bands would interview people in not so popular bands like mine that they were fans of. I was asked to do that and said, “Yeah, I’ll do that.” and then I just stayed in touch with him. At that point I was trying to put together a record of new songs but all performed by different bands and asked him if his band would want to do a song for that. Actually, at that time it might have even been a covers thing for a tribute record. He was telling me that he was just getting into producing. I sent him one of my songs and he did some demo work on it and it was really interesting and exciting with what he did with that. I sent him a bunch of songs and we put together a record, ‘These Ones are Bitter’, my second solo record. He did a tremendous job on that and has been my go to guy for almost everything I’ve done since. With the Riverdales, I produced or co-produced the album with the engineer because that is so regimented and so clear what you need to do on that that it was relatively easy. For all the other stuff I’ve been working with Mike.\n\nWhat is the hidden gem from the Screeching Weasel catalog that either was under appreciated at the time or that its popularity surprises you?\n\nA song that we don’t play live because it never seems to work live but that people like a lot is Every Night off of Anthem for a New Tomorrow. That seems to resonate with a lot of people. Every so often I will offer hand written lyric sheets that people can buy and that one is always a pretty popular one there.\n\nI was wondering about the song Speed of Mutation off Television City Dream. It is a song that I feel is a little underappreciated and might be a little bit lost in the catalog. The progression from side A to side B on Television City Dream is a little bit different and maybe the song has a different vibe and it gets lost a little bit due to the turn that the album takes.\n\nI think it is a pretty good song. When Zac Damon was back in the band, it was in our live set most nights. It is not a great song for me to play live. It’s just one of those songs. There’s no logical reason but it’s just feeling like pushing a boulder uphill singing that song live. It’s not one I dread but I don’t look forward to it. We played that because he played on that record and we wanted to have a song or two from that record but it’s not in our live set anymore. It’s a hard song to place in our set and it is a hard song for me to sing.\n\nIt’s a good song but I don’t have a lot of fond memories about that record. I don’t think that was quite the right line up for the band. There were a few things that went wrong with that record. The biggest thing was my writing was getting pretty stale around that time. It had gone into that phase that I was talking about earlier where I had got off track. I think that record is the beginning of that. It took me then like 5 or 6 years to really get my head out of my ass and get back on track.\n\nA lot of bands have a hard time taking a song from another band, and doing a cover that is as good as or even surpasses the original. I think Screeching Weasel has picked songs where you were able to consistently do that whether it’s ‘I Can See Clearly’, ‘Linger’, ‘Suspect Device’, or ‘Ain’t Got No Sense’. How do you select a song and how are you successful making it your own?\n\nWhat you look for is something that indicates something that is in your wheelhouse and something that shows you are on the same wavelength. But I would disagree with what you said. I think we did a pretty nice job on ‘I Can See Clearly’ and that was really entirely based on the guitar thing that starts the song and then the decision to drop the bridge. The other covers I heard they keep the bridge and for a punk rock band it made more sense to drop the bridge and keep it as a three chord song. The only other cover I think we did that was legitimately good was ‘Linger’ and people hated that, absolutely hated it. It could have been better but I worked on that and tried to make that ours. There are other moments. Like ‘Johnny Are You Queer’ is OK, but we were not a good cover band and that is why we don’t do them anymore. I don’t think we did a good job of making them our own. Certainly not on the level or the same universe as The Dickies where they so transform these songs that everyone knew that it was like a new song. That’s like absolute genius level and we never approached that.\n\nYou have different reasons for doing covers and I don’t think our reasons were always good because I didn’t take everything into consideration. Like really liking a song or bringing it to an audience that wouldn’t be familiar with it is a good reason. But the compelling reason has to be that you are doing something with it that wasn’t done on the original and I don’t think we did that enough. We played it too straight and not giving it enough of a Screeching Weasel feel.\n\nOn your YouTube cast the other day someone brought up Anthem for a New Tomorrow and although you acknowledged its relevance to the current times we are experiencing with Corona, it seemed like you were also down on it for various reasons. A lot of fans see My Brain Hurts and Anthem as these classic and timeless albums but I wasn’t sure you felt the same way. Is there anything you feel has aged well in the catalog?\n\nI don’t think most musicians feel the same way as fans about stuff. We have a really different perspective. We think about when the songs were written, when they were recorded, the politics of interpersonal band relationships. Negotiations and frustrations with the label and the distributor sometimes. What was happening culturally and where the band fit in there. And of course you’re thinking about all the personal stuff… where you were at and what you were going through. So you bring a whole lot to it that the fans don’t bring to it. I would say that the fans have a more objective and more valid take on it. The one thing I will say about that for the most part the stuff that we did in the early 90s is not dated in the sense that you think, “Oh yeah, that’s what the bands sounded like in the early 90s.” We were not doing some typical early 90s sounding thing, I don’t think. So it’s not dated in that way.\n\nI also think that it’s not very good. It is hard to listen to that stuff because the performances are so bad. And there are of course songwriting things that I have regrets about as well. But that’s not the biggest thing. The biggest thing is looking at it and realizing that if the situation was a little different in terms of our personnel and budget and frankly, my attitude and my performances, it could have been so much better. There were plenty of bands around at that time that are still around that if you go back and listen to their earlier stuff you might think it is a little dated sounding but they were a good band playing well together. I am not even saying a band that I like but they sound like a real band that can play their instruments more or less. And you can’t really say that about us.\n\nIt’s kind of funny, I know people who say, I wish so and so were back in the band. Then you probably weren’t there or if you were there you’re deluding yourself because it wasn’t good. I was there, I knew, it wasn’t good. It was always a struggle just to get to that level of not being very good. But we never got to the level of great and to the extent that people like that old stuff I think it has to be the songs because there’s not much else to recommend about those records.\n\nSo is there something that would epitomize the band where you would point to as the peak of the band where you feel everything was clicking?\n\nEverybody says this, but it’s what we just did. I just gave Screeching Weasel fans the absolute best example of what I can do at my best and what my band that I put together can do at their best. Going back to my second solo record, ‘These Ones are Bitter’, if you want to hear my song writing at its best, listen to that record. I don’t get much better than that so if that’s not good enough for you then you can safely stop listening. If you think that’s not up to the level of My Brain Hurts. To my mind the song writing is almost objectively so superior that it seems a silly argument. So I don’t think we are really talking about the same thing at that point.\n\nIn terms of everything, not just songwriting, the performance of the band and the production, you can’t do better than ‘Some Freaks of Atavism’. This new record is by far the total package. The one that I would point to as this is what my band is and what it is supposed to be and encompasses everything that was ever good about the band. And I have been hearing this from older fans who have said I haven’t heard you do anything this good since the early 90s and I didn’t set out to do that. I didn’t set out to recapture anything but I think it is a matter of people hearing something in the songs that maybe ring a bell from maybe when they first got into the band. So I would say, I know this is not what people want to hear, but for my personal satisfaction, me saying I finally achieved, this is the absolute apogee of what I can do when given all the tools I need to get the job done, it doesn’t get any better than this.\n\nYou can check out Some Freaks of Atavism on Spotify or Amazon Music.\n\nOther links to punk rock posts on Underthought:\n\nScreeching Weasel – Freaks of Atavism overview\n\nScreeching Weasel – Punk 101\n\nDirect Hit! – Brainless God"
