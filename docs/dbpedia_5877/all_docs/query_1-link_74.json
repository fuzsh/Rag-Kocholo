        "text": "The grounds of San Manuel Amphitheater in Devore transformed into a punk rock nirvana on Saturday, Oct. 10, as the It’s Not Dead festival made its triumphant debut.\n\nA haven for those who bought every record that punk labels Epitaph Records and Fat Wreck Chords released in the 1990s, the biggest bands of the genre played across three stages, conjuring images of the early days of the Vans Warped Tour.\n\nDespite the heat that wilted all but the mightiest of mohawks, 25,000 fans came together to pump their fists, sing along and kick up some dust in the mosh pit.\n\nJohn Reese, of promoter Synergy Global Entertainment, which put on the festival in along with Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman, said the ticket buying audience represented 49 of 50 states (Mississippi was the outlier) and 12 countries.\n\nSee more photos from It’s Not Dead.\n\nLike the Warped Tour, set times weren’t announced until the event. And the order of the top four bands on bill, Descendents, NOFX, Bad Religion and Pennywise, was determined by a spinning wheel between late afternoon sets.\n\n(As someone who grew up with this music and went to many Warped Tours and basement shows before I got paid to do this for a living, I felt like a teenager again. Of course, after being up against the barricade in the front row for Descendents and Lagwagon on Saturday night, Sunday morning was a rude reminder that I am an adult now, sore neck and all.)\n\nMy only regret is that I didn’t spend time at the side stages. With the rotating stage and no break between bands, I was pretty much glued to the main stage all day. There were some sound issues on the stage, but when the bands couldn’t be heard, the fans filled in.\n\nAlso, not music-related, but one of the best things about It’s Not Dead (and the previous week’s event, Taste of Chaos), was the free water refill station, especially since water was going for the standard San Manuel Amphitheater price of $4.75 per bottle.\n\nHere’s a rundown of my favorite moments of It’s Not Dead:\n\nDescendents\n\nYou’d be hard pressed to find a band on the It’s Not Dead bill that wasn’t inspired by Descendents. While the SoCal pop punk band has been making more live appearances in recent years, like at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival a couple of years back, it’s still a rare treat to see the group perform.\n\nIn casual conversation with fellow music fans, it seemed like Descendents were the one band a lot of the fans loved but had yet to see live.\n\nThe group and its scientist lead singer Milo Aukerman (seriously, he’s a research scientist when he’s not rocking out), played a wide selection from across its catalog, from debut full length “Milo Goes to College\n\nthrough most recent release, 2004’s “Cool to Be You.”\n\nThe highlight had to be “Suburban Home” because so many of the middle-aged punk fans in the crowd, a good chunk with kids in tow, have suburban homes of their own.\n\nSee photos of Descendents at It’s Not Dead.\n\nGoldfinger\n\nI was surprised when Goldfinger took the stage in the blazing sun and on the bass was Mike Herrera of pop punkers MxPx and on the guitar was Philip Sneed from Story of the Year/Greek Fire.\n\nLead singer John Feldmann asked the crowd who else was missing their kids’ soccer games for the show. It turned out his young daughter scored the first goal, but she made it there by the end of the set.\n\nHe also gave a shout out to The Barn at UC Riverside, where he saw Reel Big Fish play and noted that Reel Big Fish played his wedding.\n\nLess Than Jake\n\nEvery punk show is better with toilet paper getting shot into the crowd via a toilet paper cannon. The sun was still bright as the Gainesville, Florida band played a mix from its catalog. Among the best moments in the set were “Johnny Quest Thinks We’re Sellouts,” “All My Best Friends are Metalheads,” “History of a Boring Town” and “Look What Happened.”\n\nBouncing Souls\n\nThe New Jersey band probably faced the worst of the sound issues. On the first three songs, singer Greg Attonito waded into the crowd and the fans were louder than the band was. Once the sound issues were fixed, the band had a much smoother set, with highlights being “Hopeless Romantic,” “Kate Is Great,” “Lean On Sheena” and “Gone.”\n\nLagwagon\n\nThe Santa Barbara band played as the sun was setting. Among the best songs in the performance were “Sleep,” “May 16” and “Razor Burn,” the latter of which had a nice sing-along to end the band’s set.\n\nSee photos of Lagwagon at It’s Not Dead.\n\nThe Vandals\n\nThe SoCal band is still as funny as ever, with “My Girlfriend’s Dead” and a cover of Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now” being the most memorable moments of the set.\n\nSee photos of The Vandals at It’s Not Dead.\n\nFishbone\n\nWearing full long-sleeved jumpsuits emblazoned with the Fishbone logo, the Los Angeles band had to be the hottest of the day. With an early afternoon set, the group brought more heat with “Everyday Sunshine” and “Party at Ground Zero.” It was cool to see the I.E.’s own Paul Hampton (of The Skeletones) on keys for the band, too.\n\nReel Big Fish\n\nThe Orange County ska-inspired punk band played “Sell Out,” “Beer” and its cover of “Take On Me,” but could have squeezed in one more song if the group had skipped the disco, metal and country versions of “Suburban Rhythm.”\n\n7 Seconds\n\nI like to think of 7 Seconds as the gateway hardcore band. Lead singer Kevin Seconds has still got it, the set was still a blast, I just wish they had drawn a later set time. I had to stop and take a water break."
