A lucky group of kids got an up close acoustic show from frontman Mike Herrera, and had the time of their lives.\n\nRead more: Mike Herrera performed an acoustic version of “Dead Man Walking”\n\nHerrera, who also plays bass for Goldfinger, shared the heartwarming video on MxPx's social media with the caption: “Sometimes, you just gotta remember life is supposed to be fun! Be happy! #mylifestory #donttakeyourselftooseriously #thisreallyhappened.”\n\nThe upbeat song you're hearing him play is “My Life Story” from the band's 2000 record, The Ever Passing Moment. The track title's fitting, given the circumstances.\n\nWe can't get over how adorable the whole situation is—and honestly, we're sad we missed the surprise concert.\n\nHerrera recently shared an acoustic performance of “Dead Man Walking” with Live! From The Rock Room. Check it out below:\n\nWhat did you think about Herrera's performance? Let us know in the comments!"
