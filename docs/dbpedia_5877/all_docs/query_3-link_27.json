        "text": "Reminiscing about my angsty teen days of high school, there was always one genre that somehow had a song for every one of my moods, and that genre was pop-punk. Pop-punk is a fusion music genre that combines elements of punk rock and pop music, and there’s no denying pop-punk was originally influenced by earlier styles of rock, rock punk, and hardcore genres, which you can identify by the loud and distorted guitars. Even though some bands in the 1970’s created pop-punk music, such as the Buzzcocks and the Ramones, it wasn’t until later in the 1990’s that pop-punk became commercially successful (B., 2013) with bands such as Blink 182, Green Day and The Offspring bringing life to the genre.\n\nThe Red Jumpsuit Apparatus – Face Down (2006)\n\nPop-punk is a result of combining quick chord changes, fast-paced tempo and loud guitars of punk rock music with power-pop melodies and lyrical themes, although delivered with an angsty vibe. However, pop-punk, like any genre, has evolved over the past few decades, which can be distinguished by the tonal changes mainly in the vocals and guitars. The vocals are more clean and not as harsh in recent years compared to earlier pop-punk when the vocals were more raw and were more in-your-face. An example of this would be the comparison on the delivery of the vocals between The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and The Offspring.\n\nThe Offspring – The Kids Aren’t Alright (1999)\n\nInstrumentation of pop-punk music has been fairly consistent over the years, bands generally consisting of two mild-heavily distorted electric guitars, one rhythm and one lead, bass, full drum kit and vocals, and generally backing vocals would be performed by one of the guitarists. Some pop-punk songs may even include an acoustic guitar or a keyboard, such as The Wonder Years and Panic! At The Disco. Despite the loudness of a pop-punk song, generally the focus would be on the vocal performance, like any pop song the production on the vocals must be clean, in most cases, and delivered with emotion through tone.\n\nThe Wonder Years – Came Out Swinging (2011)\n\nYou may think a typical pop-punk song would be about love, relationships or breakups, right? Well, exactly that! Lyrical themes of pop-punk songs generally consist of relationships (the good and the bad), adolescence and boredom.\n\nSome bands even portray a story with ‘fictional’ characters within the lyrical content, for example, My Chemical Romance’s Black Parade album released in 2006 tells a story with a protagonist called “The Patient” whose woes and feelings are translated lyrically (“Famous Last Words by My Chemical Romance”, 2018). The lyrics in the track ‘Famous Last Words’, to me, conveys a message of not being afraid to do things on your own and portrays a story with similar themes to Romeo And Juliet, a demanding love with a tragic end as The Patient realises at the end of the song his loved one is actually the one that’s dead.\n\nMy Chemical Romance – Famous Last Words (2006)\n\nJust like pop-punk evolved from earlier styles of punk rock music, pop-punk also influenced the creation of “emo” music, which is also referred to as “emotional hardcore”, with bands such as The Used, My Chemical Romance and Hawthorne Heights. You can still hear the elements of punk and earlier hardcore genres, however the lyrical content more in depth and can make you feel strongly especially if the lyrical content resonates with you.\n\nThe Used – I’m A Fake (2004)\n\nReferences\n\nB., K.
