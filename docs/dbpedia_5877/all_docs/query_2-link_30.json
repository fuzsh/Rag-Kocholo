        "text": "Stock photos. Wood grain can vary on each instrument.\n\nIntroducing the Ernie Ball Music Man Mike Herrera StingRay bass. For more than two decades MXPX frontman and bassist Mike Herrera has wielded a custom StingRay, modified to his unique specifications. Now, Herreraâ€™s secret weapon is available to the public. The Mike Herrera StingRay features an ash body with Seafoam Green finish, a matching headstock, an engraved white pearloid pickguard, passive electronics (no battery required), and a custom laser engraved Artist Series neckplate. Having the appearance of a traditional 2-band EQ StingRay, the Herrera StingRay's pickup is actually wired straight to the jack with three dummy knobs. Additional features include a maple neck and fretboard, 21 nickel frets, six bolt neck, and alnico magnets."
