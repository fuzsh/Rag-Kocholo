No, Captain Chunk! – Get Lost, Find Yourself\n\nTrack List\n\nPlaying Dead\n\nCity of Light\n\nThe Other Line\n\nSet it Straight\n\nPull You Under\n\nWhat Goes Around\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nTwist the Knife\n\nGet Lost, Find Yourself\n\nEvery Moment\n\nAbout the Album\n\nGet Lost, Find Yourself is the third studio album from French punk rock band, Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! The album was released on May 15th 2015 through Fearless Records. The album peaked at 113 on the Billboard 200 as well as peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hard Rock Albums and 13 on the Billboard Alternative Albums.\n\nThoughts on the album\n\nI forget how I came across Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! I think it was through Spotify’s “Discover Weekly” playlist. The band has a unique sound that takes on a life of it’s own. The first track I heard from this band was the single, The Other Line from today’s album, Get Lost, Find Yourself. The album is fuses melodic hardcore punk with pop-punk undertones. The result is an album that is melodic, heavy pop-punk that is filled with catchy hooks and hard chugging riffs.\n\nGet Lost, Find Yourself opens up with the lead single, Playing Dead. To me, it’s not the best of the album, but after listening through the band’s discography, I can say it’s a classic Chunk! song. It’s filled with catchy hooks, infectious riffs, a chorus that is damn near unstoppable, and a breakdown that’ll have you ready to slam dance your way through the day. However it’s in the little things. The little nuances that causes the band to outdo themselves. The way the band weaves infectious hooks and bouncy breakdowns transitioning from light to heavy songs on the album is a sight to behold (and listen to).\n\nUsually be the third album, you like to see the growth that a band has made or is making. The other single from this album, The Other Line, is the best example of how much growth the band as made. The song starts out with vocals from frontman Bertrand Poncet and a simple chugging guitar riff. It just builds and builds and builds until the other instruments kick in, creating a driving melodic aural experience. This is accented and highlighted with a brief breakdown featuring Poncet’s gutteral growls.\n\nSet It Straight is the closest to pop-punk on the album that I could find; complete with a jangly clean guitar intro and harmonizing gang vocals. Synth riffs interposed with heavy guitars gives it a pop sheen, but doesn’t go too far into pop, with the guitars bringing it right back to the hard stuff. The breakdown-to-chorus reprise is a definite must listen to on this track. Worst Case Scenario goes briefly into pop for a few seconds, with it’s acoustic guitars that seemingly saunter the song into life before the heavy electric guitar riffs bring the tune crashing right back into the pop-punk. The chorus of this song with infect your consciousness, that’s how catchy it is.\n\nConclusion\n\nBetween the catchy hooks and heavy riffs, Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! released a genre hopping titanic. Get Lost, Find Yourself crosses many different genre lines: melodic hardcore, metalcore, pop-punk, and melodic hardcore. But it never stays in one genre for too long, allowing the listener to gain introspective into the growth that the band has made. The choruses are infectious and soaring. The guitars bring the noise with heavy and chugging riffs that drive the album. Get Lost, Find Yourself is the definition of an amazing summertime album, being released in May 2015. Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! if they were lost, they definitely found themselves with this album.\n\n(Next Post – Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

Recorded in March of 1977, it was released on May 20th 1977 through Polydor Records. The album contains two cover songs, Slow Down originally by American rhythm and blues/rock and rock sing Larry Williams as well as the theme to the 1960’s television series, Batman (originally by Neal Hefti). The album features the band’s hit single and eponymous track, In the City.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nWe’re going back across the pond to Surrey, England for one of the legendary names in British punk, The Jam. We’re traveling all the way back to 1977 for The Jam‘s debut album, In the City. Though one listen of In the City, I can already see the influences of The Who‘s Pete Townshend and Dr. Feelgood‘s Wilko Johnson. Guitarist Paul Weller utilizes these influences to create an album that became a punk staple in England for decades.\n\nIn the City is a fusion of the core punk aggression (aka “destroy everything”) and 1960’s British R&B. The album as a whole is an incredibly strong melodic one. What The Jam did was take strong melodies with equally catchy hooks and turned it into a high energy album that doesn’t compromise on the punk values. For a punk album, In the City features excellent musicianship. It is this musicianship that puts it over the top in comparison to their fellow punk rockers of the era.\n\nThe Jam with this album bring working class sensibilities to punk, much like The Who, The Kinks, and the Small Faces. In fact, they were a working class band. The problem is, The Jam are overshadowed by fellow punk bands, The Sex Pistols which focused on anger over politics; The Clash which to a slightly less extent put politics over anger. The Jam, meanwhile took mod elements (pop and rhythm and blues) and incorporated it into their social and political commentary.\n\nEach of the songs on In the City can be grouped into punk, mod, and rock. For example, the opener Art School kicks down the door with as much urgency and aggression as a late 1970’s punk album. But it’s not just a mindless zombie of a song, it’s got the brains and brawn to match it’s aggression and urgency. The track is driven by Pete Townshend inspired guitar riffs. The second track, I’ve Changed My Address is a mod-loving R&B groove that has punk overtones thanks to the driving drums and bouncing bass. It’s like a lost R&B nugget, much in the vein of The Who‘s A Legal Matter. Away From the Numbers is a more straightforward rocker with thoughtful, insightful, and what some would define as “profound” lyrics. It slows the tempo down but adds in catchy hooks.\n\nOf course, the album itself is just figurative (and literal) centerpiece for the lead single, In the City. I would make an argument that the catchy and infectious pop/punk of today is born from this song. In the City, lyrically speaking, shows off the band’s working class roots while highlighting key social issues. Speaking out against police brutality…\n\nIn the city there’s a thousand men in uniforms,\n\nAnd I’ve heard they now have the right to kill a man,\n\nWe wanna say, we gonna tell ya,\n\nAbout the young idea,\n\nAnd if it don’t work, at least we still tried\n\nAs well as highlighting the youth movement…\n\nIn the city there’s a thousand faces all shining bright\n\nAnd those golden faces are under 25\n\nThey wanna say\n\nThey gonna tell ya\n\nAbout the young idea\n\nYou better listen now you’ve said your bit\n\nAs well questioning authority…\n\nAnd I know what you’re thinking\n\nYou’re sick of that kind of crap\n\nBut you’d better listen man\n\nBecause the kids know where it’s at\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Jam generally get overshadowed by their contemporaries, The Clash and the Sex Pistols. However despite being overshadowed, they are still just as important to the punk rock movement of the late ’70s. In the City is an essential punk album that gave birth to many a working class copycat albums. It is a punk album that stands the test of time. Regardless of arguments against against the band and album and the asterisks as well, The Jam created an album that paves the way for future bands and artists within punk. In the City is a genre defining album that is one of the definitive albums of the decade.\n\n(Next post – Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was released on March 4th 2016 through Specialist Subject Records in the United Kingdom, Uncle M Records in the rest of Europe, and Animal Style Records in the United States.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nThis album, for me, was on of the undiscovered gems. A diamond in the rough of a music genre flooded with overrated crap and overplayed garbage. It was a delight to discover this album while creating a new playlist on Spotify. From the first listen of Muncie Girls‘ debut album, From Caplan to Belsize, I was instantly hooked. The vocals are crisp. The guitars are a combination of bouncy and crunchy. The bass work powers the album and the drums provide a steady pace and groove.\n\nFrom Caplan to Belsize set the tone for indie rock with punchy and crunchy riffs combined with political overtones and personal lyrics. The album delves into a wide variety of topics and issues facing society today. For example, I Don’t Want to Talk About It discusses classism and gender roles through hazy guitar and moody, but blunt lyrics. Tracks like Learn in School and Gone With the Wind utilize their seemingly grungy vibes and infectious choruses to lift you up and inspire change.\n\nThe album opens with Learn in School, a track where lead singer Lande Hekt laments about how she was never taught any kind of radical political or social ideas in school and rather had to self-educate.\n\nAll the things you didn’t learn in school, and why it feels like no one knows the truth/ The systems we rely on aren’t for you, they’re for the lucky fucking few…\n\nShe uses this thirst and quest for knowledge to incite the listener. The mood of the song is one of activism rather than lethargy… to learn more than what people teach you. The guitar riff towards the end of the track is top notch and really powers the track to an excellent finish. The rhythm of the verses really swings and when combined with the soaring (and rather thumping) indie rock chorus, you get the makings of an excellent rock song.\n\nGenerally speaking, the first few tracks of an album make or break it. If the tracks that follow up the first one don’t work out all that well or don’t mesh well, the album will be dead on arrival. However, with From Caplan to Belsize, this is not the case. the second track, Gone With the Wind comes in, hot on the heels of Learn in School. The track seems to resonate with me, as it represents an abrupt change from the preceding track. Gone With the Wind follows a more… traditional indie punk format with repeated verses and the chorus. The track pulses with a fervor of antisocial and self-destructive behavior…\n\nYou can find me under the table, I’m not coming out/ I’ve had too many beers and I’ve got nothing to be happy about.\n\nThere is something to be said about the musicianship of an album. You can have an excellent album without equally excellent musicianship. Hekt and her bandmates project these complex, dense, and vivid images that both fit around the songwriting and the music. Hekt’s delivery on each track keeps each track from being bland and mundane.\n\nBalloon is a track that shines and shimmers throughout the album. It’s no wonder why it was chosen as the album’s lead single. It’s a track that is excellently written that sums up the themes of the entire album. A pop-punk gem whose chord progression and powerful drums make it one of the most exciting tracks to listen to on the album. It is on this track that Hekt’s voice is at it’s strongest and I would say the most fierce and magnificent.\n\nOther highlights for me include the slow starting but still excellent I Don’t Want to Talk About It, the anthemic Respect, and the rather touching Social Side.\n\nConclusion\n\nMuncie Girls‘ From Caplan to Belsize is an earnest and respectable effort. It’s labeled as “indie” but it’s has pop-punk and alternative rock styling filled throughout the album. The album creates a fresh touch to an other wise bland and over-saturated genre of indie.It hard for a band to produce such a variety of songs on an album and maintain consistency, but the Muncie Girls do it in such a manner that is refreshing. An album for the DIY (and DIY punks) out there, the band doesn’t shy away from utilizing their platform to speak out. From Caplan to Belsize is a sincere and catchy socially conscious album.\n\n(Next post – Previous post)\n\nGot Social Media? Click a button to share everywhere on the interwebs!\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is something new I wanted to try starting this year. I wanted to do three top ten lists that outline my favorite items (songs, albums, artists) listened to from the past year.\n\nThis list, will be my favorite albums that I listened to this year. Each album listed will have a short explanation as to why it was my favorite. If the album was previously featured on here, I’ll link out to the review.\n\nSo let me get it started with…\n\nNumber 10: ¡Carajo! – Donots (2016)\n\n(Click here for the album review!)\n\nIt was a really good year for me when it came to my favorite bands releasing new albums. Number ten on the list is ¡Carajo! by German punk band, Donots. The album was an English language release of their tenth studio album,\n\nFrom the album review:\n\nVersatility, diversity, and rock… those are three words that you never expect to hear in the same sentence. But the Donots have created an album that is both versatile and diverse, but manages to keep a classic punk rock sound.\n\nI Will Deny is a giant arena rocker. If you happen to see their performance at Rock am Ring last year, they played a version of Ich mach nicht mehr mit with two other drummers … this song is meant to be played live in front of thousands of people.\n\nNo Part of It, is a track that was written about the current refugee crisis throughout Germany and the rest of Europe. Much like Die Ärzte‘s Schrei nach Liebe, it is an anti-fascist/anti-Nazi anthem… It’s got this dance-punk vibe to it only with heavy and roaring guitars and a soaring. I found myself shouting along to the message of the song.\n\nNumber Nine: We Were Here – BOY (2015)\n\n(Click here for the album review!)\n\nAs I’ve said in multiple album reviews on here before, I love diversity in my music. I love contrast. I love versatility. More so contrast. This is why I love BOY’s We Were Here. The album provides much needed change of pace and contrast in my playlists that I listen to. I also have a thing for female singers, and Valeska Steiner’s voice is both breathtaking and stunning. Her vocal range is every bit impressive. Compared to the band’s first album, Mutual Friends, the album is more subdued, but is every bit as good as it. The first track grips you and doesn’t let go, giving you a sense of the journey that the duo BOY have been through.\n\nFrom the album review:\n\nWe Were Here is an excellent sophomore album and perfect follow up to their debut Mutual Friends. We Were Here is an ambitious and charming album that finds it impossible and unnecessary to follow in it’s predecessor’s path.\n\nNumber Eight: This Could be a Possibility – Valencia (2005)\n\n(Click here for the album review!)\n\nLoud and local. That’s how I roll sometimes. Valencia was one the bands I listened to so much in high school. So much so I wore out the first CD I ever bought… a copy of Valencia‘s 2005, This Could Be a Possibility. It as my favorite song from the band: Tenth Street. The band was pop punk at it’s finest, and man did I love this album. Each song has that catchy and melodic, yet edgy pop-punk feel to it without it going into too much of mainstream pop-rock.\n\nFrom the album review:\n\nIt’s every easy to dismiss Valencia as just another pop-punk, pop-rock, or emo band. But This Could Be A Possibility is a slick and well-crafted debut. The album is full of soaring choruses, crunchy guitar riffs which harmonize when needed, as well as filled with poppy hooks….\n\nAt roughly 33 minutes long, it could be the most fun you’ve ever listen to from a local band.\n\nNumber Seven: Music @ Work – The Tragically Hip (2000)\n\nAs a friend once told me, “Brian, when it comes to Canadian bands, you need two separate iPods for your Rush and your The Tragically Hip albums…” Well he wasn’t wrong. I listened the hell out of The Tragically Hip‘s Music @ Work. The eponymous track, Music at Work, is the ultimate disgruntled worker’s anthem. The lyrics of the tracks on here are odd and cryptic, yet give a view into the human condition. The album is a work of consistency and the old adage, “less is more”.\n\nNumber Six: From Caplan to Belsize – Muncie Girls (2016)\n\nOnce again, I struck gold within Spotify’s “suggested songs”. And man does From Caplan to Belsize from Muncie Girls hit a home run. The album is filled with smart lyrics and catchy indie-punk tracks. The album has excellent songwriting, excellent dynamics, and overall catchy quips within the songs. It’s a solid debut album. The album is full of variety while remaining consistent with the sound the band has made from previous smaller releases.\n\nNumber Five: Get Lost, Find Yourself – Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! (2015)\n\nAnother one of the rare finds from within the “suggestions” that Spotify offers. One listen to the third track, The Other Line, from French pop-punk band, Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!‘s Get Lost, Find Yourself, and I was instantly hooked. Tracks like Playing Dead, Set it Straight, as well as The Other Line remind us just how fun pop-punk can be. It’s just one of awesome albums to rock out to.\n\nNumber Four: Boombox – Beatsteaks (2011)\n\n(Click here for the album review!)\n\nOnce again, another German punk band sneak their way into my most listened to albums for the year. The Beatsteaks, much like the Donots, are veterans of German punk rock. Though Beatsteaks, to me, have always been closer to alternative rock. But I digress. One of my favorite songs from their album Boombox, is Milk & Honey. It’s one of my favorite songs ever.\n\nFrom the album review:\n\nMilk & Honey. Arnim Teutoburg-Weiß’s vocals on the track are perfect […] Maybe it’s because the song […] is a slightly more gentler side of the band. It’s guitar riffs are solid, the vocals are sharp and crisp, the bass bounces nicely, and piano riffs are excellent.\n\nWhile their old punk intensity may or may not be fully present on this album, the catchy choruses and riffs are bountiful. This album is a straightforward rocker, that’s no-nonsense. It’s a delightfully dirty, raw, rowdy, and gripping album.\n\nNumber Three: Ein Kleines Bisschen Horrorshau – Die Toten Hosen (1988)\n\nThird German punk band on here… and this time it is the “godfathers” of German punk. Ein Kleines Bisschen Horrorshau by Die Toten Hosen, is one of the quintessential German punk albums. It’s also the quintessential Die Toten Hosen album. This album was creatively written and the lyrics are imaginative.\n\nThe opening and closing songs are excellent Hier kommt Alex (Here comes Alex), starts off with snippet of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony. BEETHOVEN. This album is a concept album based on the film A Clockwork Orange. I mean seriously, how many bands can even pull off something like this? The ending track, Bye, Bye Alex is pretty much structurally and musically similar to the opening track, Hier kommt Alex. Overall it is a excellent album, especially if you have read and seen A Clockwork Orange. It’s even better if you understand German.\n\nNumber two: Afraid of Heights – Billy Talent (2016)\n\nI awaited this album for awhile. Canadian punk band Billy Talent, never disappoints. Their fifth album picks up where Dead Silence left off. Their fifth album, Afraid of Heights captures the essence of previous Billy Talent releases… from the catchy anthems of Billy Talent I, II, and III to the gravity and headiness of Dead Silence. The centerpiece of the album besides the tracks, February Winds, Horses & Chariots, and This is Our War is the two part Afraid of Heights. Part one, the single version and the second track of the album hits home on conquering fears and taking a step into the unknown. The second part of Afraid of Heights, the reprise (and final track), is punctuated by an extremely uplifting guitar solo and closes out the album beautifully.\n\nNumber One: Morning Report – Arkells (2016)\n\nHere we are, we’ve arrived at our final destination… number one. This was a no-brainer. I’ve worn out my CD copy of Arkells‘ 2016 release, Morning Report. It’s got so many different feelings and sounds to it, it might actually hurt the album. But it doesn’t. These different sounds and styles add layers of versatility; there is no one set, specific tone to any of the tracks. For me, some of the defining moments on the album are: Private School, Making Due, and My Heart’s Always Yours. Max Kerman, frontman for the band, has a voice that’s like a shape-shifter. Going from an almost gospel rock on Drake’s Dad to the jam that is Private School. While its a bit of a departure from previous work, I couldn’t say enough about this album… but I’ll save that for a later date.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere you have it my top 10 albums that I listened to from the past year. I would love to hear about your top 10 albums that you listened to in the past year. Here’s to an excellent 2017!\n\nGot Social Media?

The track Pay the Man was recorded in 1996 while the rest of the songs were recorded from July-September of 1998. The Album was released on November 10th 1998 through Columbia Records. The album debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 and peaked at number two on the chart while spending 22 nonconsecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200. The album is certified 5x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nThe final three albums. Man, I’m got some good albums in store for you. The 1990s were a weird time for music… I mean it was full of polar extremes: grunge and punk to boy and girl groups. Following their unexpected (and unprecedented) success of their third album, Smash, The Offspring where looking at a major question/decision/problem: what direction do you head in next? Enter today’s album, Americana.\n\nThe first thing that sticks out about the album, is the album cover and artwork. It is through the artwork that you see the themes of the album. Americana is personified as the evil creature, or a roach, each with an arm/tentacle that is holding an item that responsible for or a contributing factor to the decadence of American society (i.e. guns, drugs, television/other media, fast food, etc.). This is reflected by the musical content on the album such as an ode to urban decay and the disappointment of adulthood in The Kids Aren’t Alright; the low-life, slacker anthem, Why Don’t You Get a Job?; or the delinquent-woeing, Walla Walla.\n\nThe track that sticks out on the album is the one that is most recognizable: Pretty Fly (For a White Guy). While the song was panned as joke, it was massive hit that received equally massive airplay on the radio and TV screens thanks to an equally clever music video. The song itself is infectiously catchy, and equally clever and witty. The song does deserve some credit, it was an excellent commentary on a certain type of person from the 1990s that people had to put up with.\n\nThe following track, The Kids Are Alright is no slouch. It is a straightforward rocker. The riffs are excellent, the lyrics are sharp and biting, and it has the ability to make you sing along to it. The album opener, Have You Ever, combines blistering punk with intelligent lyrics and excellent melodies. Walla Walla is seemingly another joke song that is blisteringly fast and tells the story of a man who goes to prison (hence the reference to Walla Walla or Washington State Prison). Staring at the Sun and No Brakes are straight up punk rockers: no gimmicks, just guitar, bass, drums, excellent melodies, and excellent vocals.\n\nWhy Don’t You Get a Job? is another catchy track, filled with 1990s cheese pop-rock. The track is the most blatant rip off of the Beatles’ Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da. Which is incredibly ironic because the track lambastes the shack who takes and leeches off others. Ironic indeed. Americana, the eponymous track, is a dark and brooding mid-tempo rocker. The track is their most socio-critical track ever written. It is a highly underrated song.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmericana is arguably The Offspring‘s best album to date and one of the best rock albums of the 1990s period. While many dismiss the album thanks to pop-punk singles (and hits) Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) and Why Don’t You Get a Job?, there is no denying the massive success that the album is. For better or worse, you can see/hear the influence this album had on pop-punk bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/4R2blKzIP9cEhgz7bMsRSt\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was released on August 2nd 2005 through Rushmore Records, a sister label of Drive-Thru Records.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nHere we go, the homestretch. The final seven albums for year 4. It’s almost kind of sad… almost. You know, more as much as I rag on New Jersey, the do produce some killer pop-punk/power-pop music. Well… it’s more than just pop-punk, but punk in generally. It must benefit being in-between two different music scenes in New York City and Philadelphia.\n\nAnyway… today’s album is the debut from New Jersey pop-punk/power-pop band Houston Calls, A Collection of Short Stories. The album is a ridiculously catchy album that is in the same vein as Midtown, except with more of a pop edge to it. The guitar work is crisp and thick, the drums perfectly compliment the powerful and plentiful vocals and harmonies. It is a collection of fun, fast paced pop-punk (or power-pop depending on who you ask) songs.\n\nThe song that most people associate with this band is the second track, Exit, Emergency. It is a perfect dance-punk hit that’ll have you both singing and dancing along to it. It’s chorus is huge and soaring to the point where it is almost obnoxious… but it’s almost impossible NOT to sing along to it…\n\nSo I’ll kill the doubt,\n\nI’ll put the fire out,\n\nextinguish everything,\n\nmight even forget your name…\n\nThe intro track, Sunrise Goodbyes, is a track that is fast paced and has synths that are in the same vein as Motion City Soundtrack. The chorus is insanely catchy and the harmonies are almost perfect. Bob and Bonnie is a very nice mid-to-fast tempo rocker that lyrically is a ballad, but musically is mid-to-fast tempo. It’s a new twist on the stereotypical love song. One of my favorite tracks is Amtrak is For Lovers. The track’s chorus will have you rewinding the song over and over again just to hear it again…\n\nNo joke… she says “I’ll leave you. I never meant to treat you like this, I can’t believe it. I’ll give you three more chances then I’m gone for good.” He swears… he’s really worth it. Can’t have time to show it, this routine is over as he says to her, it hits her like a ton of bricks…\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile it’s a good album, there is a lack of depth between the tracks. The second half of the album sounds exactly like the first, which is a slight drawback. The production of the album is excellent, however. The guitars are thick and crunchy. The bass grooves fill out their sequences well, the drums are deep and rich. Given when the album was released (2005) it’s excellent pop-punk. Nowadays, it’s a good album that is lacking some depth and differences between the songs. However it’s an energetic and refined pop-punk/power-pop album.\n\nGot Social Media?

Recorded in April of 2012 as well as late June through November 2012, the album was released April 5th 2013 through Fueled by Ramen in the United States and Warner Bros. worldwide. Commercially speaking, the album was a massive success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. The album is currently certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nAs some of you probably already know, I do like Paramore. I can’t explain why really… well that’s technically not true. I mean, I could explain why, but this is not the time to be discussing philosophy. Simply put: they are a fun band to listen to and I honestly don’t feel any guilt about listening to them either. I digress. Today’s album is the fourth studio album by Paramore, their self-titled album.\n\nI do have a complaint about this album in that it’s pacing is strange to me. It’s 64 minutes and 17 tracks, it probably could have been shortened by a few tracks and still hold it’s edge. I just felt, not lost, but bogged down. The time signature changes from track to track is also slightly jarring, going from mid to slower tempo to quick tempo. Those are my only real complaints about this album. But every album has it’s flaws and this one is no different.\n\nOkay with that out of the way, let’s discuss why I like this album. It’s a more experimental album in that the dabble in ALL of the genres. There is something that is bound to appeal to everyone here. Whether it’s the sultry electro-rock Fast in My Car or the odd funk-rock Ain’t it Fun to the massively catchy Still Into You. As always, Hayley Williams’ voice shines on the album. She sings with such power and authority that her voice could lead armies… or stop time itself. Hayley Williams’ vocals imbue each album with such robust charisma, regardless of whether it’s tracks like Now, Still Into You, or the three softer Ukulele Interudes.\n\nI thought that this album not only stayed true to the band’s original sound and style, but experimented with different styles as well. Take for example the massively (and infectiously) catchy Still Into You. It’s classic Paramore, except made even better. The chorus (and hook) is so massive and soaring that it’ll get stuck in your head for days at a time.\n\nFast in My Car, the upbeat and sultry electro-rocker with the 90s guitar-driven rock vibe album opener. The drums at the start of song pace the song. It is one of the best rockers on this album, along with Grow Up. Looking for a bridge from brand new eyes to this album? Well look no further than the tracks Proof, Be Alone, and Last Hope. Those tracks are very much similar to the sound and style found on brand new eyes. The track Now reminds be a lot of Monster or Careful; the guitar chords and drums power the track and will have you foot tapping or singing along to it. Part II I’m guessing is a direct response to Riot!‘s Let the Flames Begin. For me, following Ain’t it Fun, Part II made my jaw drop. It has an explosive chorus, an awesome instrumental section, and an incredibly beautiful excellent ending.\n\nI understand why most long-time Paramore fans hate tracks Ain’t it Fun and Still Into You (especially Still Into You). Those two tracks are easily the most pop-like or poppiest (is this even a word?) tracks they have ever made to date. With Still Into You, it’s not some sappy generic love song. Nah man, there’s a difference… it’s an honest one. I mean rather describing just how she loves this person in question, Williams highlights how they first fell in love and how they still love each other even if there isn’t consistent and clear chemistry between them. Ain’t it Fun on the other hand steals the show with it’s infectious blend of 90s pop-rock, funk, and a choir. A choir.It’s pristine, sharp, and clear production make this track a cut above the rest. Combine that with it’s hugely catchy chorus, and you had a recipe for one of 2013’s best songs.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile I would have preferred the album closer, Future, to end with a massive Hayley Williams send off rather than five minutes of instrumentals, this album highlights a great transitional/experimental album. While I feel like the consistency is hit or miss on the album, it’s still a decent album that’ll have you replaying it. While I’ll also admit, the album’s probably not for everyone, but it certainly has something for everyone.\n\nGot Social Media?

The album is prototypical punk music as the album length is just 35 and a half minutes. The album was released on August 26th 1997 through Fat Wreck Chords.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nFor some reason this year on these posts, I’ve went the louder and heavier route with the albums in my music library. Today’s album is no different from that pattern, which is loud, hard, fast, and in-your-face. Today’s album is No Use for a Name‘s 1997 release Making Friends.\n\nOne of the downsides to punk albums is that the songs are hard to differentiate. But that’s not always a bad thing, especially with this album. It’s a chaotic mess, but there is definitely a method the madness. The first four tracks on Making Friends all lead into each other, starting with The Answer is Still No. The outro of The Answer is Still No flows right into the intro of Invincible.\n\nThe amazing thing about this album is the dynamic guitars. The guitars can set the tone as found on tracks Growing Down and Sidewalk or they can replace silence with a short interlude as found on Secret. If you listen to any No Use for a Name song, the guitars are dynamic and always the most interesting part of the song. The drumming is repetitive, not for lack of talent, it just follows the same patterns too much, and the bass work is barely noticeable. What really stands out is Tony Sly‘s vocals.\n\nFor me, the album lacks a bit of consistency from track to track though the themes of each track flow into the next track. I’ll attribute this to exploring different styles. This led to a guitar driven rhythm; it took away from the consistency, but makes the album more accessible and catchy.\n\nConclusion\n\nMaking Friends is a 35 minute blast to listen to. While the bass work is barely noticeable and the drums are nauseatingly repetitive, there is enough on this album to make it a great one. Tony Sly’s vocals, the dynamic guitars, the edge that the tracks have to them. Listen for Invincible, stay for the rest of the album.\n\nGot Social Media?
