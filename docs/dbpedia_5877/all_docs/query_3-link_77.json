        "text": "They’re in the business of victory. Let’s take it from the top.\n\nPop-punk is not dead. Quite the contrary. In Australia in 2019, it’s more alive than it’s been in at least a decade, and it’s being championed by a concourse of young, Australian artists uploading their music to triplejunearthed.com. They’re writing hits, not tragedies, and it’s leading them to all manner of success.\n\nPop-punk peaked in mainstream awareness and popularity in the mid-2000s, on the back of defining records by bands like Green Day, Blink, Paramore, and My Chemical Romance; artists who swore to shake it up, if you’d swear to listen. After that, the genre kind of went into a functional recession: MCR went the way of Myspace, Green Day could never again capture the magic of American Idiot, and Paramore, Panic! and Fall Out Boy all released records that dabbled in dubstep, and art rock, and power pop.\n\nBut to pronounce the scene dead is and was an error. That’s firstly because there were still bands flying the flag – say hi to State Champs, The Wonder Years, and Knuckle Puck if you have never, and know that the tropes that made pop-punk so inviting during its heyday (basically, its unyielding combination of energy and empathy) are still what makes it inviting today.\n\nImportantly, it’s also because pop-punk’s most die-hard fans are now all grown, and they’ve been cradling the flame for all of these years. We’re talking particularly about young women who became pop punk lifers during childhood and early adolescence, when the genre was at its most prescient, and are now emerging with newfound glory. They’re making more than just mmrs: they’re forming bands and making pop punk music themselves.\n\n“It’s not a phase, mum” jokes Mikaila Delgado, of Sydney band Yours Truly. This may call for a proper introduction – they’re one of the groups at the forefront of this movement, formed on a bedrock of huge choruses and Delgado’s montane vocals. YT were named one of Unearthed’s Ones To Watch for 2019, and are about to head to the UK to play Download Festival with bands like Tool, Smashing Pumpkins and Slayer. Delgado says her infatuation with pop-punk began in a Complicated kinda way:\n\n“Avril Lavigne was everything,” she revealed. “She was the cool girl. I heard [her music] in primary school, and I remember just being like: ‘oh my god, I love that. I want to do that.’ I had older cousins who went through their Myspace stage and introduced me to Evanescence and Paramore. After that, I don’t really remember a time in my life when I didn’t want to make this kind of music.”\n\nConsider it the universal law of pop-punk: once you’re in the club, you’re never not in the club; it’s a fever you can’t sweat out. Though the scene waxes and wanes in prevalence and public perception, pop-punk has serious staying power among its devotees, and a baseline of sustainability in its society of gig-goers, merch-buyers and song-streamers. It’s precisely what’s allowed pop-punk to survive through troughs of public aspersion, and to thrive when the harvest has arrived.\n\n“Everyone has really stuck it out,” Delgado says. “If you're into this kind of music, you stick to it, you love it. I've done side projects and done other styles of music, but somehow, I’ve always managed to come back to [pop-punk]. It pulls you back in.”\n\nThis article contains content that is not available.\n\nIt’s important to note also that the pop-punk boom of the ‘00s was more exception than it was rule: as a branch of punk rock, pop-punk is expectedly aligned more with alternativism and underdog status than with the mainstream, and the culture that has reformed around pop-punk since its mid ‘00s meridian is that of the broken, beaten, damned. It’s evident that this ain’t a scene – it’s a goddamn community.\n\n“For a long time there, pop-punk wasn’t getting any mainstream attention, or any attention from cool media like Pitchfork or Consequence of Sound,” says Bianca Davino, who sings in a new pop-punk band called Grenade Jumper – named after a Fall Out Boy song. We’ve just started playing their music on Unearthed radio, and it has all the hallmarks of great pop-punk: crunchy chords, heaps of energy, and a really memorable melody at the forefront. To date, the band have played 8 shows, total, but Davino speaks with a level of passion and insight that speaks to a lifelong pop-punk journey:\n\n“We have had to band together and be each other’s hype teams,” she says of her pop-punk fandom. “We really had to stick up for each other and what we loved, because [our favourite] bands were being bashed by anyone who liked cool music. I think the reason why it is thriving again now is because it has regained its underdog factor, especially in Australia.”\n\nDavino also credits the community’s renaissance to social media platforms like Tumblr and Twitter, where pop-punk fans have been able to connect and share in their dedication. Indeed, it does feel like so much of the rebuild has happened online, brick by blistering brick, through platforms like (the now-defunct) PropertyOfZack, and the Defend Pop Punk Australia group on Facebook. Davino says that Tumblr, in particular, should be looked to as one of the genre’s defining institutions:\n\n“That’s how I discovered all my favourite bands,” she says. “It was honestly a whole world that I had never seen before, where people would share gifs, and edits of their favourite lyrics. To be honest I think pop-punk generally has come so far lyrically since that time because people are conscious of that; of being able to make a statement.”\n\nInterestingly, Grenade Jumper’s debut ‘Get Ahead’, above, arrives as a critique of online one-upmanship, a statement of Davino’s own about the court of public opinion.\n\nThis article contains content that is not available.\n\nAs far as statement pop-punk anthems are concerned, you won’t find many bigger than in Redhook’s ‘Turn Up The Stereotype’, a genre-bender uploaded to triplejunearthed.com last year. It’s a song about schadenfreude and shitheads, and it’s delivered by a band who aren’t afraid to break with tradition, to fold, and divide. Their singer, Emmy Mack, explains:\n\n“I wrote Stereotype when I was I was feeling pretty angry,” she says. “I just wanted to write a f**k-you anthem to the kind of people that get off on other people's failures. I really wanted to say: take a look at yourself, who do you want to be like? Are you trying to put other people down to make yourself feel better? It was just me being pissed off.”\n\nThis article contains content that is not available.\n\nIt’s also significant that these kinds of pop-punk statements are being made, more and more, by young Australian women. Make no mistake – they are firmly at the forefront of this new Aussie movement, which Mack attributes to both the prominence of the pop-punk band Paramore in the Mid-2000s, and also the erstwhile absence of women in pop-punk up until recently:\n\n“Maybe it’s just timing, that it’s taken until now,” she reasons. “But in the past it’s felt like there's only ever been like one or two women that have really broken out [of this genre]. Lots of girls, I’m sure, wanted to grow up to be Hayley Williams from Paramore. But to now have this absolute, you know, influx of incredible bands and incredible women that making this kind of music is just so heartening.”\n\nHeartening too, that it coincides with the come-up of an entire community. It’s important to note that this community is not just made up of artists: Mack and Davino have both worked as music writers, and Delgado highlights the work of photographer Georgia Moloney – who designed the cover art for Yours Truly's EP Afterglow and will now photograph them in the UK – as evidence of how this community has embraces and supports each other in their successes across all facets of the music industry. Delgado posits that the generation of writers, musicians and artists coming through the pop-punk community in 2019 have literally grown up together through this music, and that makes the current period of pop-punk prosperity even more special:\n\n“It’s the bands, it’s the industry, people that were my age or a little bit older, a bit younger and we've all kind of grown up together. And now we're all kind of like at that same stage [of success]. We're all really going for it, but we’ve been working at it together for years. Plus, it also seems like this is like there’s now also this fresh bunch of people that are so excited to be there.”\n\n“That connection is so special,” says Mack. “Something that’s really important to point out about this type of music is that the kind of people that have always gravitated to towards pop-punk music are people that do feel kind of marginalized, so naturally it has become very much about the community that people are finding with each other and with the music. It’s intrinsically linked to this scene, and to seeing this music live. It’s an excuse for community, and for people to feel that sense of belonging. We’re all weirdos, but we’re weirdos together.”"
