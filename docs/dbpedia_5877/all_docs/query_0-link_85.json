        "text": "BREMERTON — Tyler Harms’ email to his wife, Hope, was composed entirely of crying emojis.\n\nHarms’ favorite band, MxPx, was hosting a once-in-a-lifetime show in its hometown of Bremerton. The band, 25 years to the day since they formed at a house in Central Kitsap, was inviting its biggest fans to an intimate show at the Manette Saloon, but offering a lucky few a chance to join them on stage for live karaoke.\n\nHarms, who lives in Gardner, Kansas, couldn’t see how he could possibly get there.\n\nOr so he thought.\n\n“Do it,” his wife replied to those crying emojis.\n\nSo the Harms hopped a plane, took the light rail and caught a ferry, spending one night in Bremerton with the city’s most famous of bands. Harms, along with other super fans, indeed took the stage at the Manette, surrounded by drummer Yuri Ruley, guitarist Tom Wisniewski and frontman Mike Herrera. He sang \"Invitation to Understanding,\" off the band’s “Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo” record.\n\nThe opportunity left him speechless.\n\n“I wish I'd said something about what an honor it was, or how cool it was, or how much MxPx means to me, or how unimaginably different my life would be if I hadn't bought ‘At The Show,’” said Harms, referencing the band’s 1999 live album.\n\nA few fist bumps would have to do.\n\nBorn “Magnified Plaid” on July 6, 1992, MxPx has sold millions of albums and has traveled the world behind an infectious brand of punk rock — true to the genre’s pace and edge but distinguished by Herrera’s penchant for an upbeat, melodic sound.\n\nCombine that with a band that savors connecting with its fans — in both its music and with special meet-and-greets like their own live karaoke — and you’ve got the recipe for rock band longevity.\n\n“It’s a feeling that somebody understands you, gets you,” said Sean Pedersen, a native of Kelso who now lives in Arizona and has listened to MxPx since high school. “Everybody’s been through the same (expletive) but it takes a band like this to say, ‘so have we.’”\n\nIt is MxPx’s work ethic and positivity that set it apart from the pack, according to Neutralboy, AKA Mike “The Pike” Moen, a legend of the Northwest punk scene.\n\n“There’s not a lot of pop punk you can sing along to, that you can dance to, even though it’s still at 100 miles per hour,” he said.\n\nAt 25, the band tries to strike a work-life balance that gives them time for family while still staying tour-sharp. They’re contemplating a new album, which would be the band’s first since 2012’s “Plans within Plans.” Herrera runs his own studio, Monkey Trench, and puts out a weekly podcast. They enjoy a good side project: this year Silver City even made a beer, “Secret Weapon,” named for a song and album released a decade ago.\n\nMany weeks of 2017, MxPx has headed out for back-to-back weekend shows — from Calgary to Tokyo to Seattle — only to return to Bremerton for the week. Wisniewski and Ruley still work at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard too. Herrera called it “the best of both worlds.”\n\nThe 40-year-old Herrera described their current mantra: “Enjoy what’s in front of you, try to plan ahead for the things that are important, and everything else — get to it if you can,” he said.\n\n'Still that guy'\n\nThere’s a humility to MxPx that goes back even before the band, its biggest fans say. Brandi Wallentine met Herrera at Silverdale Elementary, before the days of his signature look, tattoos, lip rings and dark jeans. Both in choir in junior high, the pair sang together at old folks’ homes and other community gatherings. She recalled a terrifying teenage moment — she once sang the wrong verse while performing Bryan Adams’ “Heaven” with Herrera. She says he quickly adapted to the errant verse, making it work out on the spot and avoiding further embarrassment.\n\n“He was just a sweet, honest kid,” she said. “And he’s still that guy.”\n\nHerrera remembers lugging around the band’s first CD in his backpack at school, fearing its success. They got some help from his church, Crossroads in East Bremerton, where they hosted shows.\n\nThe band maintained a reputation as being Christian-based for a while; Herrera said their brand of religiosity now is simple: “We’re good people and we don’t discriminate.” But soon, fans were dubbing cassette tapes of \"Pokinatcha,\" the band’s first album, like wildfire.\n\nThe band’s meteoric rise would come with the release of “Life in General,” an album that included hits like “Chick Magnet.” It also included a song that, Bremerton’s Naval history notwithstanding, put the band’s home city on the map.\n\n“I definitely didn’t think it was going to be a single or it was going to be anything,” Herrera said of “Move to Bremerton.” “It was just a funny song that I wrote, because I wanted more people to move to Bremerton, you know. ‘Let’s hang out, let’s do this.’ I wanted all the cool people I met on tour to be at home.”\n\nThe shows kept getting bigger. Herrera recalls playing a festival in Tokyo where, in front of thousands of screaming fans, he came out in a Mariners Ichiro (Suzuki) jersey. He tossed it into the crowd, it went wild, and they played.\n\n“It was everything I love about being in a rock band,” he said.\n\nHerrera says the band’s longevity has inspired some millennials to embrace the band’s brand of “Left Coast punk.” But the core of MxPx is a generation that grew up at the same time the band did. Shows today aren’t as rowdy, but they sell similar numbers of tickets.\n\n“It’s a different dynamic,” he said.\n\nHerrera said he savors the age of social media, replying to as many tweets and posts as he can. The band knew they wanted to do something truly intimate for their most devoted following.\n\nAnd, for a lucky bunch that included the Harms — the couple from Gardner, Kansas — they invited the most familial of fans to the shores of the Kitsap Peninsula for some karaoke.\n\n“It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime event for me, and a fantasy come true,” Harms said. “I’m so glad we were crazy enough to make it work.”"
