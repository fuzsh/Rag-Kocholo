        "text": "The link between most pop punk bands and their suburban America backdrop is fascinating.\n\nIt seems as though nearly all pop punk bands, even certain emo revival bands, are both implicitly and explicitly tied to the suburban cul-de-sac that they call home, whether near Philly, New York City or any other metropolitan mecca surrounded by the tried and true Americana realness that is suburbia.\n\nThat’s why, when I came across Mike B. Mann’s blog post If I Die, I Wanna Die In The Suburbs: Pop Punk, Suburban Angst and Quarter Life Crises, I was enthralled by its subject matter. Nevermind that he gives shout outs to three solid songs and bands (especially The Wonder Years’ “We Could Die Like This…” Goddamn, The Greatest Generation is an utterly awe-inspiring album), what I adored about Mann’s post was just how frank he was being regarding his own experiences in suburbia.\n\nI grew up in a slightly more working class neighborhood of a very affluent Boston suburb, and the D.I.Y. ethic and sense of camaraderie that characterized the kids in my little enclave went hand in hand with the themes and sentiments commonly expressed in the various sub genres of punk rock. So it was natural that some of my neighborhood friends and I would come to embrace this kind of music in our middle and high school years. In some ways, punk rock, pop punk, and later on, emo, numbed the pain that accompanied my life as a confused, underachieving outcast lost in a sea of privileged overachievers.\n\nI think tackling what American suburbia represents within the pop punk community is pretty important. Though it is extremely obvious how intertwined the suburbs are to the pop punk juggernauts mentioned in Mann’s article, I think it’s worth further exploration than that. Suburban upbringing is the root of many people’s origin stories, whether they are part of a band, a frequent show attendee, or someone cultivating their own musical community with fellow fans.\n\nWith all that being said, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to learn that the number of Americans living in suburbia has been growing since the 1950s, and still continues to grow.\n\nAround the same time I read Mann’s post, I was super invested in Marc Dunkelman’s book, The Vanishing Neighbor: The Transformation of American Community, which discussed how sustained socioeconomic trends and massive changes in the way Americans perceived interpersonal relationships effectively altered the way Americans connect with each other. So yes, on top of being a huge emo nerd, I’m also apparently a big American demographics nerd. Who knew?\n\nWithout getting into the nitty gritty details, Dunkelman essentially theorizes that, due to the rise of social media (among a whole lot of other things, mind you), Americans are now way more able to exclusively connect with those they have most in common.\n\nYou like Paramore? Awesome, there’s seven bajillion Paramore fan sites, forums, blogs and what have you that you can follow. You like all things that can be considered scene? Great, check out PropertyofZack, AlterthePress, Alternative Press and hell, maybe even DIYDSevents.com!\n\n(Sorry for the shameless plug, but it had to be done.)\n\nWhether it’s regarding music, politics, personal opinion or nearly any other topic, we’ve been afforded the luxury of connecting with the people who we have a whole lot in common; at the same time, it’s also allowing us to distance ourselves from those that don’t share our interests.\n\nThose people you talked to once or twice since high school come right to mind, don’t they? Wishing them a happy birthday doesn’t count either dude, sorry.\n\nI’d totally recommend checking out the book if my bastardization of the author’s theory seems at least mildly interesting, but for now, let’s get back on track.\n\nA key fact that Dunkleman lays out in his book is that the number of Americans living in the same suburbs vilified or glorified by our favorite pop punk bands have been on the uprise since the 1950s:\n\nbetween 1950 and 2000, the percentage of Americans living in the suburbs doubled from a fifth to a full half, while the percentage living in nonmetropolitan areas plummeted from 44 to 20.\n\nThe Daily Beast confirms that these increases have been sustained since the 2000s, too, as does New Geography.\n\nSo what does this mean for us pop punkers? Well, for starters, there’s the potential for there to be more of us, statistically speaking. With more people living in the suburbs, just think of how much suburban angst could continue to be bred!\n\nAnother topic to consider here: ever take a step back and realize that our generation (the ‘millenials’) seem to be just so lambasted by the older generations? I mean, Time did call us the Me Me Me Generation, after all.\n\nWhen introducing his theory, Dunkleman brings up The Lonely Crowd, an analysis of social characteristics experienced within the U.S. written in 1950 by David Riesman. In this analysis, Riesman (along with co-authors Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney) identified three character types that flourished during that specific part of American history. I’m going to focus on one particular type, the other-directed person:\n\nThe other-directed person wants to be loved rather than esteemed; he wants not to gull or impress, let alone oppress, others, but, in the current phrase, to relate to them; he seeks less a snobbish status in the eyes of others than assurance of being emotionally in tune with them.\n\nThe Lonely Crowd, according to Dunkleman, “was written to warn Americans of the emerging threat from within,” as Riesman truly believed that as the other-directed person character type rose to prominence, autonomy would be effectively compromised. That argument can be addressed elsewhere, however — what I find fascinating about this character type? I find these qualities wholeheartedly ringing in those involved in DIY communities, whether as a performer, a booker, or as someone who attended every single basement or garage show in his neighborhood since they were eleven.\n\nIt’s the people that can be described as other-directed persons that I personally hope to connect with whenever I attend some sort of concert.\n\nBut even if the above description was written as a sign of warning, I just can’t find any negative to a person who wishes “not to gull or impress, let alone oppress, others, but…to relate to them.”\n\nAnd isn’t seeking the “assurance of being emotionally in tune” with someone exactly what people like Mike Mann found in his suburban, DIY community? Isn’t it what we find in our own music communities?\n\nAnd while my high school escapist habits of occasionally raiding the liquor cabinet, sneaking a cigarette, or smoking pot in the alley behind the coffee shop where I used to work have been replaced mostly by distance running, I feel like I’m still running from my suburban roots, running to escape the town I was born and raised in, running toward an uncertain but still promising and alluring future of living somewhere that feels more like home and finding my life’s purpose after taking all these fascinating detours.\n\nAt the end of the day, there are some facts to consider about suburban America, our generation and our pop punk:\n\na) The number of Americans living in suburbia has been on the rise for nearly 70 years straight. As it increases, that token angst found in the songs we all enjoy will do just the same.\n\nb) No matter what they say or do, the younger generation will always be insulted by the older generation. Millenials will probably always be considered narcissistic, entitled and lazy — it comes with the territory of being born into the generation of selfies and status updates.\n\nc) Like Mike Mann, we may all spend a significant portion of our lives running from our suburban roots — I know I sure as hell did, and still continue to do. But suburbia, with all its lackluster qualities and truly monotonous sensibilities, gave rise to the music that has gotten us through life’s mishaps and misfortunes.\n\nHey, our generation may be full of entitled pricks, but our music communities are changing us for the better."
