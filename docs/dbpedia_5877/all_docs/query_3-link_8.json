        "text": "Pop punk is a subgenre of punk rock that combines catchy melodies with fast-paced guitar riffs and lyrics that often deal with teenage angst and rebellion. It emerged in the late 1970s and gained mainstream popularity in the 1990s thanks to bands like Green Day, Blink-182, and Sum 41."
