        "text": "Five Iron Frenzy - When They Find You (Feat. Mike Herrera of MxPx)\n\nIn honor of Five Iron Frenzy day, the band drops hard hitting new song – “When They Find You”. The song features backing vocals from Mike Herrera of long running left coast punk act, MxPx. Listening to this song first time through I made up assumptions and drew targets to throw foam darts at in the hopes making my confusion stick somehow. I read through some comments on different social media sites, scratching my head reading some of the responses then instantly connected with the lyrics Reese Roper posted in the comments of the FIF page (Facebook).… Continued →\n\nSong of the Day: MxPx - Want Ad\n\nY’all better to get ready to put your boxing gloves on. You ready for this? Pokinatcha is the best MxPx (Magnified Plaid) album. Why? It was melodic, but still very much punk–bordering even on old school hardcore at times. It’s by far their most unique record, before they settled into the more polished pop-punk sound that everyone remembers. To be clear, I have no problem with the direction they later took (except for maybe moving further away from Christian spirituality and theology as the years went by, but that’s another post altogether).… Continued →\n\nNate Parrish to Release New Single \"God Knows\" (Feat. David Bunton of The Showdown)\n\nI bet you didn’t see that coming did you? Yes sir (or ma’am or whatever), Nate Parrish is BACK and with a vengeance, a most righteous, glorified vengeance of the melodic punk rock n’ roll variety. He is releasing his first new single of 2022 titled “God Knows” which features David Bunton of the great band – The Showdown (Get Snake Bit) lending his vocal talents. You might not know this but David also was a melodic punk band years ago before The Showdown so this pairing is absolutely perfect!… Continued →\n\nToo Bad Eugene Returns\n\nOne of my favorite 00’s pop-punk/melodic punk acts – Too Bad Eugene, returns this year with new music. While we await such a magnificent return by Adam Nigh and company, the band has just put up the now classic year 2000 full length, “At Any Rate”, for download and streaming on all digital networks. For the first time in over 20 years you’ll finally be able to listen to this album I’ve been raving about ever since it’s release on CD 20 years ago.… Continued →\n\nMike Herrera - Don't Walk Away (Official Music Video)\n\nMike Herrera (MXPX) has dropped a surprise acoustic cover of the classic 2003 song “Don’t Walk Away” off their criminally underrated album “Before Everything and After” (2003). Check out the music video below and find the song on digital networks now including Spotify. Don’t be negative on this post or I’ll fight you 😉… Continued →\n\nHeart Like War - Screaming (New Song)\n\nIndie Vision Music is proud to present the brand new song from Heart Like War titled “Screaming”. The song appears off the band’s upcoming Ep “Start Over” which will release in July. Check out the song below.… Continued →\n\nMike and Holli Herrera to Be on Fixer Upper (HGTV) April 3rd\n\nMike Herrera’s wife Holli just let the cat out of the bag and has announced that Mike, her, and the kids will be on an upcoming episode of Chip & Joanna Gaines HGTV show “Fixer Upper” where the family is relocating to Waco, Texas. This is huge and I am sure will be an enjoyable show to watch since many of us whether we like it or not, have that special connection to MXPX and their music for the past 25+ years. Check out the page on HGTV website here and and get ready to watch on April 3rd.… Continued →\n\nTumbledown - Great Big World\n\nTumbledown, the alt-country project of Mike Herrera (Mxpx) has a new music video for their track “Great Big World”, which can be seen below.… Continued →\n\nREVIEW : Arthur - Watch the Years Crawl By\n\nSofter side-project from all three members of MxPx and their stage tech. Catchy love songs with a doo-wop flair."
