Abstract

The content of this Kellogg Working Paper is not typical. Rather than presenting a piece of research or scholarship, this document offers public addresses by two leaders of the Catholic Church in Chile. Raúl Cardinal Silva is archbishop emeritus of the Archdiocese of Santiago, having served in that office both during and after the last democratically elected government in Chile. Monsignor Cristián Precht is currently vicar of the Archdiocese of Santiago, having served previously as head of the Vicariate for Solidarity, the human rights arm of the Archdiocese.

These addresses were delivered in March, 1986 at St. George's College in Santiago, Chile. They were offered as part of a seminar on the Bases of Democracy for invited Chilean university student leaders, co-sponsored by the Kellogg Institute, CIEPLAN and St. George's College. The addresses have been translated by Timothy Scully, C.S.C., of the Political Science Department of the University of California at Berkeley and are also available in Spanish from CIEPLAN in Santiago.
