        "text": "When Newton came home [on August 13, 1974,] the men took him by the arms and he called out to my mother who was in the kitchen. “Mother, the DINA is taking me away.” My mother didn’t understand what was happening at the time because she had never been political. The men tried to assure her because she was grasping my brother. One of the agents took her aside and said, “Don’t worry ma’am; we’ll bring him back in ten minutes—we only want to speak with him. We’re friends from work.” My brother looked pale and didn’t say anything, probably so as not to frighten our mother. . . . When they took my brother Newton away from home, my other brother was arriving and followed the wagon in his taxi. From a distance he saw them bring Newton close to the church of San Francisco . . .\n\nAfter our brother’s disappearance, we began looking for him everywhere—like all the relatives of the detained. The DINA, Directorate of National Intelligence, was created in July 1974, and the military continued refining its methods and applying them more cruelly. We began doing things immediately and found out that at the Pro-Paz Committee, which was located on Santa Monica Street, they were getting all types of reports about abuses and violations of human rights. We began looking for our brother in jails, cemeteries, morgues, commissaries, and anywhere a military regiment existed. We also went to the law courts, and at many of the places we went, they received us with machine guns just for asking questions and for going around searching for the detained-disappeared. We sent thousands of letters abroad asking for help as well. We even went so far as sending letters to the leaders of the dictatorship themselves, but nothing came of all this. . . .\n\nFrom the despair emerged the idea of making arpilleras. . . . We didn’t want to make something that would function as a decoration. We wanted to design a handmade product that would denounce what we and our country were living. We wanted to tell people about our personal experiences through pieces of our own clothing. We wanted to embroider our story, the harsh and sad story of our ruined country. At first, we had problems getting the materials, especially the cloth and the wool. So, we got the idea of cutting up our own clothes and unraveling our sweaters to make the first arpilleras.\n\nWe opened our workshop in 1974, but we didn’t go public until 1975. In those years, I took full responsibility for the search of my brother. My sister had been kidnapped by a cab driver who interrogated her about the names of people she knew. She told him about her years as a volunteer worker in rural organizations and about all her activities as a university student [and then she was released]. After that, my sister was afraid to go out into the street to look for our brother. I was scared too. We were all afraid to keep on asking and searching. Then I put all my energy into the arpillera workshop; it was sometimes the only thing that kept me balanced emotionally. There I found other people who were suffering from the same thing and trying to help them sometimes helped me with my own tragedy. . . .\n\nIn the same arpillera workshops, we started training sessions to teach the women about solidarity and their role in the soup kitchens and other group activities. Sometimes it was hard teaching the women in the townships because they treated us worse than lepers; they believed that our protest activities would put them in jail or among the disappeared. It was hard convincing them that if we didn’t unite and support each other, then we wouldn’t be able to do anything. Many times the money that we got from the sale of arpilleras paid some child’s medical fees or gave relief to a workshop family member. . . .\n\nWe women of Chile who were involved in the struggle had a more difficult time because, as we now realize, our men were so machista [male chauvinist]. Instead of helping us in those years, they pulled us down. Some of the women’s husbands would not let them attend meetings or help in the training or with the solidarity work. In those years, men never said, “Compañera, let’s go out and struggle together to change the reality of this country.” Women were the ones who fought. . . .\n\nAs a woman, I realized as part of this process of fighting for liberty in my country that the myth that they had driven into our heads all our lives—that the man is the one with the power and physical force to control everything—only goes so far. It’s relative, and it’s like all the other myths that they implanted in us women. It was the women comrades who managed to end the military nightmare in our country; they had the strength that the men lacked or lost along the way. Women, who were always housewives, woke up and didn’t submit until freedom returned to their country and its citizens. . . ."
