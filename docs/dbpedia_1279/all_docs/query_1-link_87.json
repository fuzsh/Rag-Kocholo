        "text": "Before, during, and after his visit Lefebvre was the target of a hostile barrage from Roman Catholic prelates in Latin America. The friendliest comment came from Argentine Archbishop of Parana, Adolfo Tortolo  a conservative-who said: \"Not everything is negative in the demands of Monsignor Lefebvre. But his way of going about things is completely negative.\"\n\nOther Church leaders were less inhibited. Chilean Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez said Lefebvre was \"a traitor to the Church and to the Pope, a Judas. Colombian Cardinal Anibal Munoz pronounced: Those who are loyal to Monsignor Lefebvre are disloyal to the Pope. The Archbishop of Buenos Aires threatened any priest who let Lefebvre use church facilities with punishment according to Canon Law. A Patagonian bishop said he prayed daily to \"God and the Holy Mother to preserve me from such attitudes as Lefebvre's.\n\nAs Lefebvre sailed for home Church authorities prepared the faithful at ports of call. Montevideo Archbishop Carlos Parteli drew up a pastoral letter in which he said Lefebvre was scandalizing the faithful with his behavior. Parteli also denounced the use of Latin in the Mass saying: The Church cannot go on using an archaic language which nobody understands any more.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, bishops' conference president, Monsignor Aloisio Lorscheider, himself something of a conservative, fired a parting volley by saying that anyone who takes part in a Mass given by Lefebvre is committing a mortal sin.\n\nIt is, then, hardly surprising that many of those who would like to have heard what the Archbishop had to say were browbeaten into staying away.\n\nBuenos Aires (NC): Police prevented Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre from saying Mass at a makeshift altar in a suburban barracks and told some 300 of his followers there that security laws did not allow any public demonstrations.\n\nAbout 200 persons had welcomed him at Ezeiza International Airport July 20, but only one priest responded to repeated invitations by an organizing committee to greet the French churchman.\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre had been warned that his presence would not be welcomed in Argentina. Argentine diplomats in Switzerland, where he has his headquarters, and in Colombia, where he visited a sister, had said that the government was supporting the Vatican's stand in suspending the archbishop, and did not want to allow further public display of disobedience.\n\nAfter learning of the ban on the Mass at the barracks, the archbishops followers angrily called police Communists.\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre has repeatedly denounced the Church renewal that followed the Second Vatican Council and said it has opened the Church to Communist infiltration. Under Argentina's rightist military regime, police and security forces have been repressing leftist groups under state of siege, allegedly to protect national security. In this context, observers said, calling police \"communists\" makes little sense.\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre's followers are identified in Argentina as members of several conservative organizations: Phalanx for Faith, the Knights of Queen Mary, and groups affiliated with the Defense of Family, Fatherland and Property organization.\n\nSponsors of the rightist magazine Roma also joined Faith Forever, the umbrella organization that made preparations for the visit of the Archbishop.\n\nAbout 30 persons attended a Latin Mass Archbishop Lefebvre said at a private home in Buenos Aires a few hours after his arrival. Newsman and photographers in large numbers gave coverage to every move by the archbishop. Spokesmen for Faith Forever said he was to spend six days in Buenos Aires but did not plan to visit other places in Argentina.\n\nForeign Minister Oscar Antonio Montes said that Archbishop Lefebvre had been admitted into the country under \"freedom of worship laws.\n\nCardinal Juan Carlos Aramburu of Buenos Aires issued a warning to all pastors, reminding them that \"no place of Catholic worship should be made available to the archbishop for any religious services, under pain of canonical sanctions.\"\n\nCatholics must also abstain from participating in any Mass offered by the archbishop, the warning said. Instead, they \"should pray so that the Lord will touch his heart and Archbishop Lefebvre will renounce his rebellious attitude,\" the cardinal said.\n\nCardinal Raul Primatesta of Cordoba, who chairs the Argentine Bishops' Conference, said the French prelate's visit should not be magnified and reminded Catholics they can identify the true Church by the time-proven formula: \"Where Peter is, where his successor the Pope is, there is the Church.\"\n\nTraditionalists announced plans to open a seminary in Argentina under Archbishop Lefebvre's Priestly Fraternity of St. Pius X, from which the Vatican has withdrawn recognition. The archbishop was suspended of all priestly functions a year ago after performing illicit ordinations.\n\nLater, at a stormy press conference, Archbishop Lefebvre said he does not have \"bellicose intentions\" in his opposition to Church renewal and the Vatican.\n\nAbout 150 local followers of the suspended French archbishop entered the hall of a downtown hotel where the press conference took place and booed 50 newsmen every time the followers disapproved of the questions.\n\nThe bitterest reaction came when a newsman asked whether a book written by Archbishop Lefebvre, A Bishop Speaks, did not raise the issue of disobedience and arrogance.\n\nOnce calm was restored, Archbishop Lefebvre replied that obedience is a relative obligation. He stated:\n\n\"As soon as authority fails its mandate, it also loses its right to obedience. When the Pope by his policies leads us into contacts with Protestants and other religions, in such a way that we lose our faith, in that case the Pope forfeits the right to obedience by his subordinates.\"\n\nAt another point the followers of the Archbishop requested that photographers leave the hall. After vigorous protests from the press, organizers said they could stay.\n\nAsked how he felt about his suspension from priestly ministry by the Vatican a year ago, Archbishop Lefebvre commented:\n\nI have no awareness of committing a grave sin by keeping my Catholic Faith.\n\nHe said that, in his view, the post-conciliar liturgical changes are leading the faithful, almost unconsciously, to a conversion into Protestantism.\n\nTo another question the archbishop replied that he did not seek to form another church.\n\nI hold no bellicose intentions, I do not wish to fight anyone. I am not opposing the Pope, I am just asking him to be the Pope, the successor of Peter. I am perhaps the son who loves the Pope most, but I pray to God that he may show a constant concern to preserve the Catholic faith in every place and at each opportunity, he said."
