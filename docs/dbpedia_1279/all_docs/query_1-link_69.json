        "text": "By Luis Chacon\n\nOn the auspicious occasion of Labor Day, the Salesian community in Los Angeles came together in a heartwarming display of unity and collaboration with the local clergy. This gathering, held in the spirit of fellowship and goodwill, not only celebrated the simple joys of sharing a meal but also emphasized the strengthening of bonds within the Salesian family and the broader community. In this article, we will delve into the heartwarming details of this event, highlighting the significance of collaboration between the Salesians and the local clergy in serving the parishes of Saint Bridget, Saint Mary’s, and Saint Isabel.\n\nA Special Guest: Bishop-elect Brian Nunes\n\nOne of the highlights of this heartwarming gathering was the presence of Bishop-elect Brian Nunes, a significant figure in the Church, who Pope Francis appointed as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles on July 18, 2023. Bishop-elect Nunes is set to be ordained as a bishop on September 26, 2023, at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels by Archbishop José Gómez. The event provided an ideal opportunity for the Salesian community to extend their warm wishes to Bishop-elect Nunes as he prepares for this momentous milestone in his journey.\n\nA Call to Cherish Togetherness:\n\nAs we reflect on this special Labor Day gathering, it is clear that these moments of togetherness and camaraderie are invaluable. They strengthen the bonds within the Salesian community and foster collaboration with the local clergy. This unity is crucial as we serve the parishes of Saint Bridget, Saint Mary’s, and Saint Isabel. Together, we are working towards building a stronger, more compassionate community.\n\nThe Labor Day gathering in Los Angeles was a heartwarming testament to the spirit of collaboration between the Salesians and the local clergy. It emphasized the importance of unity, faith, and the simple act of breaking bread together in building a stronger and more compassionate community. As we look forward to more days of fellowship, good food, and lasting friendships, let us cherish these moments of togetherness that strengthen the Salesian family and serve the broader community."
