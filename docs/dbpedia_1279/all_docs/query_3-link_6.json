        "meta_description": "This second volume of A Social History of the Catholic Church in Chile explores the life of the Chilean Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez (1907-1999) who became the most important Chilean ecclesiastical figure of the 20th Century. As archbishop of Santiago he involved the Chilean Church in the changes effected by the Second Vatican Council while playing an active political role within the governments of presidents Jorge Alessandri (1958-1964), Eduardo Frei (1964-1970) and Salvador Allende (1970-1973). During the military period, Cardinal Silva Henríquez became the voice of the persecuted and managed to establish an alternative welfare state that helped the hungry, the unemployed and those who had lost relatives after the military coup. It is clear that in analyzing his life this work provides a church-centered analysis of religion and politics in Chile.",
