        "text": "Pinochet‘s Military Dictatorship:\n\nReligious Control\n\nSelena Haddad\n\nMarch 30th, 2023\n\nAugusto Pinochet Ugarte was a heavy-handed ruler, a character trait which is necessary for a successful military coup. Through various newspaper articles, US state declassified documents, and secondary sources, it is clear to see Pinochet’s connection to Roman Catholic Church, and the impact that relationship had on his leadership of Chile. Pinochet was supported by many Catholics from before his rule that supported him taking power. Pinochet also used God as a way to express himself to the people of Chile on many occasions, which shows how significant of a role God played in the general’s life. While Pinochet’s rule implied the separation of church from state, the Chilean Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez, had a connection to Pinochet that allowed for some church influence. This can be seen through their many interactions and Pinochet’s apparent willingness to support the Cardinal’s wishes and requests. General Pinochet’s connection to Catholicism had a small, yet significant impact on his rule and this is seen through Pinochet’s personal connection to Roman Catholicism, Pinochet’s interactions with church leaders such as Cardinal Silva, and the changes that came from these interactions.\n\nThe Generals References to God\n\nGeneral Pinochet was a well-known Roman Catholic, and his connection to the religion can be seen throughout his speeches and records. The United States Army listed Pinochet’s religion as Roman Catholic in his biographical sketches. 1 This continued as a pattern throughout the years with different branches of US intelligence also listing Pinochet’s religion as Roman Catholic. A New York Times article that discussed Pinochet in 1973 describes him, his wife, and their children as Roman Catholic. 2 This consensus that he was Catholic is not well supported by 1 United States Army, Army South. [Augusto Pinochet Ugarte] 1974. 2 \"Chile's Strongman: Augusto Pinochet Ugarte Man in the News Served in U.\" New York Times (1923-), Sep 15, 1973.\n\nof the military’s supporters were religious democrats who wanted them to fix the country and restore its peace that they could not find in democracy. 6 A highly reported meeting was with Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez, in 1974 which was covered by a number of news sources as well as US intelligence reports. The US embassy report of this meeting shows how the Cardinal was able to voice his concerns about the junta, especially the human rights violations that were occurring under the new regime. Pinochet’s overall position on the Cardinal’s concerns was said to be sympathetic. 7 In The Irish Times, an article discussing this meeting is titled \"Church Supports Chilean Junta.\", compared to the US document, this article discussed how Cardinal Silva wanted to congratulate Pinochet on his rule and how the church is offering its cooperation with Pinochet as long as their concerns are considered. 8 Pinochet inviting the Cardinal over for this discussion in itself shows a level of respect Pinochet had for the Church and the wishes of those with religious power. This may be an indication of a strong personal religious connection rather than a connection between Pinochet and Silva themselves. Another way in which the church interacted with Pinochet is through a letter signed by Cardinal Silva, a few months after his meeting with Pinochet, which discussed the junta-church relationship. In the letter, the church called on Pinochet to end the violence and human rights violations, as well as release prisoners who were in jail for social and political reasons. 9 This call to action by the church to Pinochet in both the meeting with the Cardinal and the letter was met with Pinochet explaining that he had given orders for the violence to stop however he planned to look deeper into the issues if they were said to be continuing. Around this time the New York Times reported that there was hope for change in Pinochet and that they believed he was taking on a more sensitive approach to 6 Power, Margaret. Right-Wing Women in Chile: Feminine Power and the Struggle Against Allende, 1964-1973. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2002. 247. 7 United States Embassy. Chile. Gen. Pinochet-Cardinal Silva Meeting 1974. 8 \"Church Supports Chilean Junta.\" The Irish Times (1921-), Jul 04, 1974. 9 \"Chilean Church Leaders Appeal.\" The Irish Times (1921-), Sep 03, 1974.\n\ngoverning while also taking constructive criticism from outside forces. 10 The continued communication between the church and Pinochet showed his weakness for his spirituality as he took what the church was saying into consideration, which is not something he did in any aspect for institutions outside of the church.\n\nHis Actions to Support His Beliefs\n\nWhile being open to discussion is important for voices to be heard, the actions that follow these discussions are most important to the progression of the relationship. Pinochet had many concerns voiced to him by the church over his years in power, and while some of his responses to these concerns were weaker than others, there was an underlying respect for religion in his actions. During the previously mentioned meeting between Pinochet and Cardinal Silva, Pinochet did not only say he would take some of his concerns into account, but he also promised the Cardinal that within 90 days Catholic Universities would have power given back to the Church. 11 This shows a level of respect for the teaching of Catholicism by Pinochet, he could have ignored any request for change, especially with the brutal regime he was running however, he chose to continue Catholic education. Likewise, in 1975 Pinochet released almost 200 prisoners as a response to the Catholic Church’s grant for freedom. 12 This example is connected to Catholicism in two ways, firstly by Pinochet considering the church’s wishes and taking action and secondly, by these releases being granted for the Christmas season. Pinochet was a brutal dictator, however he managed to put this aside with respect to certain religious requests and celebrations. The quickness that this request was delivered in also shows how important religion 10 \"Hopes for Pinochet.\" New York Times Jun 27, 1974. 11 United States Embassy. Chile. Gen. Pinochet-Cardinal Silva Meeting 1974. 12 Albuquerque Journal (1926-2004), Dec 20, 1975 (Page 33 of 68).\n\nPinochet had with the Cardinal, he denied any human rights violations which were clearly seen happening. The US CIA report in 1983 discussed many of these violations that were suspected to be ordered by Pinochet, although they could not say that they were ordered by him directly. 17 Also, many news sources reported the violations and the UN voted against Chile for their many human rights violations close to the end of Pinochet’s rule, showing that this is something that continued. 18 While some may argue that this shows his disregard for Catholicism, his actions for Catholicism proved against this. Pinochet was still a brutal military dictator and in order to keep his power as well as keep the church and state separate, he could not be bossed around by the church. This may help to explain why he often did not acknowledge what he had done as a response to the church’s requests and often acted as though it was simply something he decided. To keep his strong stance as junta leader Pinochet put his brutal regime above all, however he still had a soft spot for the Catholic church which influenced his political decisions and allowed for prisoners to be freed on Catholic holidays, for meetings with important church members to happen, and for the requests and letters of the church to be heard by Pinochet. If there was more data on direct interactions and action between the church and state it would decrease the limits of the data.\n\nConclusion Overall, Augusto Pinochet Ugarte did have a connection to the Catholic Church that influenced many of his political decisions. While foreign intelligence agencies can discuss his faith to an extent, the leader’s consistent reference to God in a positive, spiritual and savour light\n\n17 CIA, SECRET Intelligence Report [Executions in Chile Since the Coup], October 27, 1973. (pg-188) 18 JUAN de ONIS Special to The New,York Times. \"Chileans Voting Today in Plebiscite on Pinochet's Rule: Why She Will Vote no.\" New York Times (1923-), Jan 04, 1978.\n\ncontributes to the proof of his personal beliefs. Taking into account only three of Pinochet’s speeches, there is not one that leaves out God or does not discuss a spiritual aspect to his people or his regime. As the military dictator leader Pinochet did not have to discuss his actions with anyone outside of his government however, he consistently decided to discuss and take into consideration the wants and needs of the Catholic church. From meetings with high-ranking members of the church, letters signed by the church, or requests to release prisoners, Pinochet was always available to listen to these concerns. President Pinochet took it upon himself to make actions that favour the Catholic church’s requests, such as handing educational power back to the church and releasing prisoners in time for the holidays so they may enjoy it as they please. While Pinochet’s government did want to keep the church and the state separate, it is evident that this was hard for Pinochet to follow through with. This weakness for the Catholic church and the many requests Pinochet granted Chilean Cardinal Raúl Silva, prove that his connection to his faith as a Roman Catholic did impact his rule.\n\nBibliography\n\nAlbuquerque Journal (1926-2004), Dec 20, 1975. \"Chile's Strongman: Augusto Pinochet Ugarte Man in the News Served in U.\" New York Times (1923-), Sep 15, 1973. \"Church Supports Chilean Junta.\" The Irish Times (1921-), Jul 04, 1974.\n\nUnited States Army, Army South.
