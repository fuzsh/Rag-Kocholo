Comments and suggestions for topics to be treated in the future will be welcomed. iLs this a Communist congress or an ecumeni- cal council?\" There was some excuse for the cynicism of the bourgeois journalist who put this query after hear- ing Secretary-General Luigi Longo's opening report to the Eleventh Congress of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) on January 25, 1966. In his four-and- a-half-hour speech, Longo had dwelt-at icono- clastic length-on the similarity of many Marxist and Christian \"values\" and had called on Commu- nists to undertake a \"dialogue\" not only with in- dividual believers but with Catholic organizations On leave of absence from Radio Free Europe, Munich, where he served as political analyst, Mr. Devlin is presently a Senior Fellow at the Research Institute on Communist Affairs, Columbia. Univer- sity, New York. He has published a number of studies on Communist activities in the non-Com- munist world and last appeared in this journal with \"Moscow and the Italian CP\" (September-October 1965). and with the Church itself. The delegates had heard him voice fulsome praise of Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI (\"outrageous in its low Machiavellianism,\" commented Corriere della Sera sourly, and anxiously'); they had listened as he repeatedly quoted papal encyclicals and Vatican Council documents, adding: In these and other recent Church documents we find motives, changes and objectives which have guided us in our struggle. Today, the possibilities of an encounter between Catholics and Communists have become greater, and there is a more widespread awareness that this is the road which must be fol- lowed if one wishes to change the present course of international politics.2 ' Panfilo Gentile, \"L'Appello ai Cattolici,\" Corriere Bella Sera (Milan), Jan. 27, 1966. 2 L'Uniti (Rome), Jan. 26, 1966.

It would he a `:socialist\" society, of course; but the Catholic collaborators, lie promised, would help to determine its features. Meanwhile, there were certain firm guarantees to be given. The Russian Mikhail Suslov was among the foreign party emissaries who im- passively listened to Longo's criticism of outmoded \"conservative ideological positions [which] identi- fied the religious `ideology' as the opium of the people\" and to his further declaration that \"just as we are against a theocratic state, so we are against state atheism. This means that we are against the state's conferring any privileges what- ever on an ideology, philosophy, religious faith, or cultural and artistic school of thought, to the detri- ment of others.\" The element of political opportunism in these statements, delivered from the rostrum of a Com- munist party congress, was clear enough-particu- larly when Longo took it upon himself to defend the Pope and the Council against \"the criticisms and scarcely veiled attacks\" of the Christian Demo- cratic right wing, or when he urged that Italy adopt \"a neutrality parallel to the neutrality of the Church, which has abandoned the politics of blocs.\" Nevertheless, political opportunism is only part of the story. The emphasis which the Eleventh Congress of the PCI placed on an approach to Catholics draws much of its significance from the fact that it is not an isolated phenomenon. It must, rather, be seen against the background of a wider pattern of change in the relationship be- tween communism and organized religion, particu- larly in Western Europe, in recent years. This in turn has been the result of a continuing process of ferment and transformation both in the Christian churches (as expressed in ecumenism and the con- scious adaptation to secular realities) and in the Communist movement (revisionist polycentrism and the consequent erosion of ideology). Probings by the Church On the Catholic side, this radical rethinking of received teachings and revision of traditional at- titudes has been associated above all with John XXIII, the elderly \"caretaker Pope\" who jolted his Church by calling for an aggiornamento, a com- ing-to-terms with the modern world and with the non-Catholic religious, political and intellectual forces at work in it. The change in attitudes to- wards what his predecessors had consistently anath- ematized as \"atheistic communism\" was memor- ably expressed, less than two months before Pope John's death, in his encyclical Pacem. in Terris (April 1963).' Instead of sweeping condemnation, there was a tranquil warning against confusing \"false philosophical teachings\" with the \"historical movements [inspired by these teachings] that have economic, social, cultural or political ends.\" Not only were such movements (Marxism was obviously meant, but not named) subject to development and change, but \"insofar as they conform to the dic- tates of right reason and are interpreters of the law- ful aspirations of the human person, [they) con- tain elements that are positive and deserving of approval.\" This was startling enough; but Pope John went further in suggesting that \"a drawing together or a meeting for the attainment of some practical end, which was formerly deemed inop- portune or unproductive, might now or in the future be considered opportune and useful.\" Pru- dence would guide Catholics in deciding \"the ways and degrees in which work in common [with Com- munists] might be possible for the achievement of economic, social and political ends which are honorable and useful.\" The line thus traced out by Pope John was continued under his successor, Paul VI, and, as it were, institutionalized-not without strong con- servative opposition *-in the debates and docu- ments of the Vatican Council, particularly those on the Church in the modern world and on religious liberty, and in the establishment in April 1965 of a permanent secretariat for relrions with nonbe- lievers (primarily Marxists). La Main Tendue Actually these altered Catholic attitudes and the Communist response to them were not quite as novel as they appeared to most. It was the late French Communist leader, Maurice Thorez, who had first used the now familiar phrase, \"the out- stretched hand\" (la main tendue), in his appeal to Catholic workers for political cooperation in April 1936. Thorez's appeal was made within the \" For abridged texts of this and other papal encyclicals mentioned later, see A. Fremantle, ed., The Social Teach- ings of the Church, New York, 1963. For full texts of all but Pacem in Terris, see F. J. Powers, ed., Papal Pro- nouncements on the Political Order, Westminster, Md., 1952. 4 Some 450 prelates, out of nearly 2,200 voting on this question, campaigned unsuccessfully to have an explicit condemnation of communism included in the text on the Church in the modern world. They were hardly mollified by the insertion in the final version of a phrase quietly reconfirming previous papal criticisms of atheistic doc- trines (\"sicut antra reprobatur\"). This nod to the past was more than balanced by the open invitation to atheists to engage in \"prudent dialogue\" for the betterment of the world.

There was, however, a response from some Christian intellectuals, notably in a book entitled Communism and Christianity,5 a collection of essays by the Catholics Francois Mauriac, Pere Ducattillon (O.P.), Alexandre Marc, and Daniel-Rops; the Orthodox Nicolas Berdiaev; and the Calvinist Denis de Rougemont. In the main, the essayists main- tained a dispassionate emphasis on discussion rather than polemic.? This was, in effect, an invitation to a \"dialogue,\".but it was not taken up by Communist intellectu, al's. Apart from any reaction to Communist moves, a ,mall but important segment of French Catholic intellectuals was working during the prewar years, towards a revision of traditional socio-political at- titudes. The leaders here were Emmanuel Mounier and the group gathered around his periodical, Esprit; their \"personalism\" included a radical critique of bourgeois capitalism but still kept them far from the authoritarian and materialistic Marxist posi- tions.' Later, the thought of Jacques Maritain moved in a similar direction, with greater em- phasis on representative democracy.8 Moreover, these thinkers could claim support from the official social teachings of the Church: for example, Pope Pius XI, who harshly condemned \"atheistic com- munism\" in the encyclical Divini Redemptoris ? English edition, with translator's preface by J. F. Scanlan, London, 1938. 'The tone may be suggested by a few brief quotations: \"Communism has too often been refuted by controversial- ists who did not know what it meant\" (Ducattillon, op. cit., p. 88) ; \"In a period of acute social struggle, such as we are witnessing today, the system which corresponds best to Christian personalism is 'personalist socialism' \" (Berdiaev, p. 226); and \"In adopting a position vis-a-vis communism two attitudes are forbidden to a Christian at the outset, on the one hand the attitude of systematic hatred and suspicion, on the other that of a willingness to defend an intolerable condition of affairs [in non-Com- munist society] \" (Daniel-Rops, p. 260). ' See E. Mounier, De la propriete capitaliste a la pro- priete humaine, Paris, 1936. Cf. also the manifesto of Mounier's group in Esprit (Paris), Oct. 1935. ? It is interesting to note that President Eduardo Frei of Chile has acknowledged his Christian Democrat re- gime's debt to the social and political thought of Maritain. See E. Frei and I. Bustos, Maritain entre nosotros, San- tiago, 1964 (cited by E. Halperin, The Christian Demo- cratic Alternative in Chile, Center for International Studies, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1964).. (1937), had earlier criticized the-injustices of the capitalist order in Quadragesimo Anno (1931).9 Between the mid-1930's and the mid-1950's, then, France was the scene of the most notable prepara- tions on the Catholic side for a future \"dialogue.\" 10 During the same period, the major developments on the Communist side took place in Italy. The Italian CP Even before the war, the clandestine, persecuted Italian Communist Party was aware of the need to come to some kind of terms with Catholicism in the homeland of the Church. Thus, in Septem- ber 1936 and again in April 1938, the PCI Central Committee issued appeals urging Italian Catholics to join in the struggle against the Fascist regime,' which had also crushed Don Luigi Sturzo's Chris- tian Democratic movement, and emphasizing the Communists' \"absolute respect for religious opin- ions\" (Sept. 1936 text).- When Togliatti returned to Italy from Moscow. in 1944, he reaffirmed and strengthened this ap- proach, committing his revivified party (in his im- portant policy report delivered in April 1944 at Naples) to a constitutional regime that would guarantee \"freedom of thought and speech; free- dom of the press, association and assembly; freedom of religion and worship.\" At the ,Fifth PCI Congress in late December 1945, he extended the list to \"freedom of religious propaganda and organiza- tion.\" The new party statutes broke daringly with 9In fact, Pius XI hit both targets in one sentence of Quadragesimo Anno: \"It remains for us, then, to call up for judgment the economic order as it actually exists and socialism, its bitterest accuser; and to pronounce upon them both a frank and just sentence.\" The Communist charge that organized religion had, in practice, made it- self the ally of the capitalist establishment contained much truth-but it was far from the whole truth. 10 A major postwar development in France was the Church's attempt to reassert its presence among the \"post-Christian\" masses through the \"Mission de France\" and the priest-worker experiment. This project was halted by Vatican decree in 1954 but again authorized on an experimental basis in October 1965. 11 Both these documents were reproduced in Rinascita, Feb. 19, 1966. Although the Spanish Civil War had brought Catholic-Communist antagonism to a peak, there was apparently some tentative response to the April 1938 \"Open Letter to Italian Catholics.\" In his preface to the republished documents, Franco Ferri reveals that in August 1938 talks took place at a Swiss convent be- tween \"Monsignor Rampolla, Secretary of the Congre- gation of Seminaries, and the Communists Donini and Sereni . . . in the course of which there was discussion of political alternatives and of the basis of the real guarantees contemplated by the Communists for the Church, not only in Italy.\" Ferro adds that there were \"many [other] top-level contacts.\" Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/06/28: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400010030-5 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/06/28: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400010030-5 all Communist precedent by offering membership to \"all citizens who-without regard to race, religious faith, and philosophical convictions-accept the po- litical program of the party.\" In the Constituent Assembly of 1946-47, it was the decisive Communist vote (in contrast to Socialist, Republican and Lib- eral opposition) which assured the incorporation in the Constitution of the Lateran Treaty, giving the Church a privileged position in Italian life. But the Communists' \"outstretched hand\" was rejected-as it was bound to be in view of the ad- vent of the Cold War and the persecution of religion by the new Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. An anti-Communist campaign by Catholic leaders, clerical and lay, helped to defeat the Communist- Socialist coalition in the 1948 elections and was climaxed in July 1949 by Pius XII's decree ex- communicating Communists and their supporters.\" Shortly afterwards the left-wing Christian Demo- crats led by Giuseppe Dossetti were heavily defeated at the party's congress. During the 1950's Dossetti's follower, Giorgio La Pita, the \"holy mayor\" of Florence, was among the few lonely voices calling for Catholic-Communist collaboration. By the early 1960's, however, attitudes in both camps had changed considerably. In Florence, Bologna and other centers, groups of \"advanced\" Catholics were reconsidering Marxism in personal meetings and through small-circulation magazines like Tertimonianze (Florence). On the Italian Communist side, the hand was repeatedly stretched out-in the theses of the Ninth PCI Congress in January 1960 (\"action for an understanding with the Catholic world is conceived as one aspect of the Italian way to socialism\"); in the theses of the Tenth Congress in December 1962 (\"the aspiration toward a socialist society . . . can find a stimulus in the religious conscience\"); and in articles and statements such as Togliatti's speech of March 1963 in which he rejected \"the ingenuous and mis- taken idea\" that religious beliefs would fade away under socialism. Togliatti's remark presaged another turning point: the emergence of Western Communist criti- cism of established Communist theory and practice regarding religion. This appeared first in reaction to Leonid Ilichev's report to the CPSU Central Committee in November 1963, in which he de- nounced religion in traditional fashion as \"dia- metrically opposed\" to communism and called for an intensification of atheistic campaigns to \"con- 12 Despite the aggiornamento under Pope John, this decree is still binding on Catholics, as the conservative Cardinal Ottaviani tartly recalled in August 1965 (interview in Studi Sociali, Rome). However, it has obviously been ignored by large numbers of Italian Catho- lic voters-which may have had something to do with Pope John's shift in emphasis. quer\" it finally. Italian Communist criticism of this \"fundamentalist\" line was belated and at first restrained. Initially expressed in an article by Professor Lucio Lombardo-Radice (Rinascita, July 4, 1964), it found fuller expression some months later in the most interesting book that the \"dialogue\" has , yet produced: 11 dialogo alla prova (The Dialogue Put to the Test), made up of essays by five Catholics and five Communists.\" Difficulties and Dilemmas The initiative for this joint work came not from the Communists but from the \"Lapirian\" Catholics, i who drew a rebuke from L'Osservatore Romano for their pains. The actual effect of the \"dialogue\" was to emphasize the \"ideological\" gap between the j two sides-and; the limitations of any possible dis- course. Thus, the Catholic participants generally stressed that there was no question of political col- laboration on the level of organizations; their con- cern was rather to explore doctrinal implications in a Johannine spirit of goodwill. For the Commu- nists, on the other hand, political collaboration was frankly the goal, however obscured by talk of \"com- mon human values.\" They were at pains to clear themselves of the charge of opportunism and strumentalismo (using others for their own ends). They also insisted that what mattered was the reality of communism in Italy, -not elsewhere; they deplored the Soviet \"call for a struggle against religious survivals\" (Delogu) and admitted that in the name of \"vulgar materialism\" believers were wrongly subjected to legal and civil discrimination in the USSR (Lombardo-Radice).\" Both sides generally agreed that there could be no ideological compromise; only the Catholic Zolo saw \"the pos- sibility of a doctrinal integration of some aspects of Marxist humanism with aspects of the Christian conception of man.\" In fact, the Italian Communists were in a di- lemma, torn between the legacy of the past and. the demands of the future. Their problem was formulated with unusual clarity by Togliatti in his Yalta Memorandum of August 1964: 19 Florence, 1964. The contributors are alternately Catholic and Communists beginning with the Catholic Mario Gozzini, followed by L. Lombardo-Radice, N. Fabro, L. Gruppi, R. Orfei, A. Cecchi, G.-P, Meucci, I. Delogu, D. Zolo, and S. Di Marco. 14 Even when some public Soviet attitudes toward religion were modified, Italian comrades continued to criticize them as inadequate. E.g., see L. Gruppi's dis- cussion of M. Mchedlov's Kommunist article of October 1964 in the March 1965 issue of Il Contemporanro (sup- plement to Rinascita)-a special issue devoted to the \"dialogue.\" Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/06/28: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400010030-5 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/06/28: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400010030-5 The old atheistic propaganda is of no use. The very problem of religious conscience, its content and its roots among the masses, the way of over- coming it, must be presented in a different manner from that adopted in the past if we wish to reach the Catholic masses and be understood by them. Otherwise our outstretched hand to the Catholics would be regarded as pure expediency and almost as hypocrisy.15 The outstretched hand was indeed generally regarded as \"pure expediency\"-and not without reason. Communist attempts to publicize the \"mes- sage\" of Il dialogo alla prova through articles and local meetings with Catholic participation were weakened by obvious political moves, such as Pietro Ingrao's call in January 1965 for a Communist understanding not only with the Catholic masses but also with Catholic organizations and the whole \"Catholic world\" (it was assumed that his aim was to exploit deepening division in the Christian Democratic Party). This maneuver promptly back- fired: , a week after Ingrao's call, the Christian Democratic factions united to issue a National Council resolution denouncing communism, and within the next few months, the major Catholic professional and labor organizations followed suit, warning members against taking part in any dialogue.16 But in spite of repeated warnings by L'Osservatore Romano and the Italian Jesuit organ La Civiltii Cattolica,11 the discussion nevertheless continued- if only with scattered groups of Catholics and their little magazines. On the Communist side, this led inevitably to a further development of re- visionist positions, usefully recapitulated in Luigi Fabbri's recent book, I communisti e la religione.'s Renewed Initiative Across the Alps in France, meanwhile, the dia- logue was developing along different lines. First, it had less direct relevance to national politics, the Catholic MRP party having become a minor factor. Communism and Religion: The Selective Approach The various historic-social vicissitudes through which each group of people or civili- zations passed determined the crystallization of beliefs, the creation of determined pre- cepts or religious norms. In almost all the globe and throughout almost all epochs, re- ligion has held back historic-social develop- ment. But in determined historic phases and utilized by the ascending classes, it played a positive role, it was utilized as a revolution- ary banner. Engels indicates it in speaking of the war of the peasants in Germany, and Lenin himself does in a letter to Gorki. \"There was a time\" he said, \"when in spite of the origin and real significance of the idea of God, the struggle of democracy and the proletariat was brought about under the form of a struggle of one religious idea against the other.\" Lenin adds that \"this time passed long ago.\" This is true. But in the ideas of goodness, ,equality, fraternity among human beings, which the Christian religion also speaks of and which are reflected in the honest religi- ous and sincere conscience of any believers, there are elements capable of contributing to an emancipating struggle. These elements do not have their origin in religion as such, but they have been taken from non-religious, objective forms of relations between men as members of society. Perhaps these elements, instead of being a restraint to such a strug- gle, might constitute a stimulus? Our re- sponse is positive.- . . . Religion is an en- couraging idea where the religious movement supports the social transformations and socialism. \" English text in The New York Times, Sept. 5, 1964. 16 Norman Kogan, \"Italian Communism, the Working Class and Organized Catholicism,\" prepared for delivery at the 1965 annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Washington, D.C., September 1965. 17 In this matter there is a notable difference between the position of Civilth Cattolica and that of the French Jesuit organ, Etudes.

Thirdly, the French Communist Party did not commit itself organizationally to the debate to anywhere near the extent that the P(.'1 did: the burden of Com- munist discussion was carried, rather, by a small number of individuals, notably Roger Garaudy, Gilbert 11urv, Andre Moide and Michel Verret. if the French Conununist conumitntcnt to the de- hate has been less impressive than that of the Italian comrades, it has been met by a more receptive at- titude on the part of sonic French Catholics.

Mury and J. Bruliat, attended the \"Semaine des intellectuels Catholigttes.\" =r' The leading Communist spokesman has been Roger Garaudy, director of the party's Marxist research center (and editor of its theoretical organ, Cal(iers du Cmmninnisnre, until \"relieved\" of his duties in October 1961 together with a third of the stall). His revisionist ideas on religion, developed over the past few years, are most fully expressed in his recent hook, Dc 1'anathein.e au dialogue .21 Like the Italians, Garaudy criticizes the Soviet- Fast European model. In fact, he was the first prominent W(.-stern Communist to do so: in Fcbru- ary 1964, five: months before the Italian Lonthardo- Radice spoke out, he told a Catholic-Comnutnist seminar in Lyons that \"we cannot as Marxists adopt the present position of our Soviet comrades on the religious problem, as given by Ilichcv. It is not a question of tactics, but of principle.\" Garaudy makes no doctrinal concessions; on the contrary, he stands by Marxist materialism, holding to the chiliastic belief that religion will eventually (lie under true and complete communism. But it will die of natural causes, he maintains, and there should be no attempt to kill it. This strain of eclectic revisionism was summed tip in an article which -'Yhe \"Week of Marxist \"Thought\" held at Nantes in the spring of 1965 was devoted to Marxist-Christian relations. See the proceedings in La Nouvelle rrilique (Paris), May 1965, especially the contributions of Michel Verret and the Dominican Pere Duquoc. !\"'See G. Mury, \"Le dialogue se poursuit,\" France Nouvelle (Paris), March 31-April 6, 1965. \"' Paris, 1965. See the sympathetic review by the Dominican priest Pere Gardey, in Le Monde (Paris), Dec. 10, 1965. From the Catholic viewpoint, De 1'anat/r, me au dialogue represents a considerable advance from the rather condescending attitudes expressed in Garaudy's earlier work, Quest-ce que in ,norvrle marx- isie'' (Paris, 1963). Cf. also A. Maine, Corn,nurnsles el rhritiens (Paris, 1965) and M. Verret, Les marxislrs et in religion (Italian edition, L'atei.smr, mnderna, 196.3). The concept of Christian love . . . is the highest image that mean can conceive of himself and of the meaning of his life; and that is wily Marxism would be impoverished if Saint Augustine, Saint Joan of the Cross, or Teresa of Avila hero me alien to it. On this ground surely there can be a meeting of Marxists drterrnined to understand, to integrate and to realize the human '.substance' of Christian- ity; and of Christians who understand the purifying virtue of Marxism as against all the disincarnated spiritual systems, and who are determined not to desert man's struggle .22 In Italy and France the \"dialogue,\" such as it is, takes place in the open. In Spain, however, the complex confrontation between religion and Marx- ism proceeds in clandestinity, or in exile; it is conditioned by the hitter memories of civil war, and it is extremely difficult to trace its course. The leaders of the Spanish Communist Party have re- peatedly made it clear that they now place their hopes in an alliance of anti-Franco forces in which Catholic organizations would have to play an im- portant part. The grounds for these hopes were expounded-and exaggerated-in an article (\"To- wards an Alliance of Communists and Catholics\") which Santiago Alvarez of the) party Central Com- mittee contribute(] to the June 1965 issue of World Marxist Review. Alvarez's main point is that \"the Catholics are our main allies today in the struggle' against Franco,\" and he claims that \"this process of. rap- prochement has quickened in recent months.\" To hack this claim, he cites examples of priests sup- porting workers' protests in the Asturias and Ca- talonia; anti-Franco movements among Catholic students; a few Icft-wing'Catholic publications like Cuadernos para rl Dialogo; the formation in Janu- ary 1965 of the Christian Democratic Union with a program of economic and social reform; and the positions taken by individual lay and clerical spokes- men-particularly that expressed by Msgr.

In general, however, the French bishops have been much more permissive than the Italian hierarchy and have dis- sociated themselves from the positions of the \"intcgristes\" on the Catholic right wing.

The Problems Ahead The importance of the Catholic-Communist dia- logue, especially in Western Europe, is clear; but so are its limitations. These arise above all from the fact that communism-like Catholicism-makes absolute claims affecting every sphere of life: as Reinhold Niebuhr has said, Marxism is \"an irreli- gion transmuted into a new political religion.\"26 Consequently, neither side can compromise on the essentials of doctrine-and the doctrines are es- sentially incompatible. Moreover, the Communists are, naturally, interested primarily in political col- laboration, whereas wary Catholics generally insist that any political cooperation be limited to what a French theologian has called \"specific objectives, recognized as acceptable to Catholics, important to the common good, in circumstances where there is no danger that such cooperation will end by going beyond the limits agreed upon\" 20-which leaves little scope for opportunism, even if one discounts the weight of the past. These limitations emerged clearly in the most impressive personal confrontation that has yet taken place-the Salzburg conference of May 1965, which brought together some 250 scholars from both camps to discuss \"Christianity and Marxism Today.\" The initiative came from the largely Catholic St. Paul's Society (Paulus-Gesellschaft) based in Munich. The discussion between theologians like Rahner and Reding and ideologists like Garaudy and Gruppi proceeded in an atmosphere of anxious goodwill; but it moved on the level of ideas, not on that of prac- tical politics. The conceptual and semantic gap remained, and there were no concessions on the incompatible essentials. The participants, however, did resolve (by 200 votes to 20, with 30 abstentions) that \"the dialogue is possible and fruitful, and . . must be continued and widened. They hope for greater reciprocal information and mutual knowl- edge, in the awareness that both the Christian world and the Communist world are going through a phase of evolution.\" 27 25 Introduction to Marx and Engels on Religion, New York, 1964.' 20 Yves Calvez, \"Chretiens et communistes,\" Revue de faction populaire (Paris), November 1965. 27 For non-Communist accounts of the Salzburg con- ference see Siiddeutsche Zeitung (Munich), May 4, 1965; Die Presse (Vienna), May 5; and Frankfurter dllge- meine Zeitung, May 5.

The available evidence suggests that the opposition to the Franco regime comes today mainly from non-Communist forces, with left-wing Catholics playing a major role. Party Secretary- General Santiago Carrillo's recent claim that \"work- ers' commissions\" consisting of Catholics, Commu- nists, and other leftist elements have been formed \"in all the principal centers of the country\" 24 has the ring of propaganda; and the dream of Catholic- Communist collaboration in building a socialist Spain seems far from realization. Less significant developments in other countries can be noted only briefly. In Belgium, for example, an enthusiastic Communist reviewer (L. Goty, in Le Drapeau Rouge, Jan. 16, 1966) reports that Garaudy's De l'anatheme au dialogue \"is selling like hot cakes, and supply cannot keep up with demand.\" But the Belgian Communists have made little contribution to any dialogue. Much the same is true of Austria. In Holland, the most \"advanced\" Catholic community in Europe finds no partner for discussion in an ideologically sclerotic Commu- nist party. In West Germany, Catholic intellectuals have made a notable contribution to the reassess- ment of Marxism, but no response comes from the clandestine Communists. North America has pro- duced little beyond an \"outstretched-hand\" pam- phlet by Gus Hall of the CPUSA (the decision of the new Communist Party in Quebec to welcome Catholic believers into its ranks will make little impact on French Canadian conservatism). There is no lack of significance in the interaction of religion and communism in Latin America al- though only in Chile does one find anything like a sustained \"dialogue\" in the European sense. How- ever, the Latin American situation-marked by the growing reaction of some Catholics to social in- justice, by the Church's links with the \"establish- 23 Bishop Guerra Campos' address was reproduced in the October 1965 issue of the Spanish CP's monthly organ, Espafla Republicana, published in Havana.

Pope Paul VI declared in this connection that one could not speak of the Council having \"reformed\" or \"transformed\" the Church, but one could say that it had \"renovated\" it. Press com- mentators use the Italian word \"aggiornamento\", meaning \"modernisation\", to describe this new development. A Change in the attitude among the clergy is evident also in Chile: It can be said that in certain respects the Church is departing from its traditional positions. Some of our views regarding the Church are, therefore, no longer valid and need to be modified. Unlike religion, Marxism-Leninism does not require \"aggiorna- mento\", for its very essence is constant critical reflection, examina- tion of reality and rapidly cognising the new. Let us, therefore, frankly, carefully and dialectically examine the problem of Catholic \"renovation\". The Real World-the Basis of the Changes The act of convening the Ecumenical Council signified a departure from the dogmatic extremes associated with the personal dictator- ship of the Pope. After the First Vatican Council in 1870 affirmed the infallibility of the Pope, it was announced that there would no longer be any need for such meetings. Pius XII based his absolutism on the principle: \"The Church, I am the Church\". Numerous articles published at the time in the Vatican repeated the sacramental phrase: \"The living directives of Pius XII are the direct and universal norms of the faith.\" During his office bishops were reduced to mere vicars of the Pope. The Council, on the contrary, is a collective authority, and its recent meeting accented the need for partial decentralisation which would create the prerequisites for semi- autonomous initiative by the dioceses. The authoritative Catholic commentator Rene Laurentin in his The Dispute about the Council, which appeared shortly after John Christianity with its cultus of abstract man, more especially in its bourgeois developments, Protestantism, Deism, etc., is the most fitting form of religion,\" and that \"the religious reflex of the real world can, in any case, only then finally vanish, when the practical relations of everyday life offer to man; none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to his fellowmen and to Nature\". The process ofadequately reflecting society is extremely complex and difficult. In our times too the protest against \"real misery\" is expressed in the shape of \"religious misery\", \"the sigh of the oppressed creature\", \"criticism of the vale of tears, the halo of which is religion\", disillusionment which leads to critical reflection and revolutionary action-all these feelings are closely interwoven in the hearts and minds of millions of people. The Standpoint of the Communists We know of innumerable cases of deeply religious people taking an active part in the struggle headed by the Communists, even though this participation meant for them the personal tragedy of excom- munication. We know of many families where the mothers or ,grandmothers who, although devout Catholics, helped their Com- munist sons and grandsons in the struggle during the periods of repression. They would return heartbroken from the Sunday Mass at which the priest had anathematised Communism as being \"evil ,from its very birth\". We explained to these families that at the beginning of the last century Pius VII had intimidated fighters for the independence of Chile by invoking the wrath of the Lord, and that Leo XII in one of his encyclicals had denounced the founders of our republic as miscreants.

In Chile growing numbers of young Catholics identify the very vague and ambiguous concept \"communitarian system\", regarded as the Christian ideal, with Socialism and Communism. The Christian-Democrat deputy, Julio Silva Solar, in a book on this thesis upholds \"ideological pluralism\", by which is implied com- petition and even the possible co-operation of Marxists, Catholics and people of other ideological trends in building socialism and communism, understood as a social system in which there is no private ownership of the means of production. Similar views are shared by many deputies and also by most of the leaders of the youth organisations of the Christian-Democratic Party. The Communists, who are striving for unity of all working people, do not reject this pluralism. In Chile the People's Front was in power for ten years. Towards the end this democratic coalition government included representatives of our Party. Communists have been, and still are, the majority in some municipal councils. And Catholics can confirm that never once have we used our influence to the detriment of their religious feelings. Lack of mutual understanding was due to the militant anti-communism of many Popes who unscrupulously used their religion for reactionary political aims. After the publication of \"Rerum Novarum\", prac- tically every Vatican document (irrespective of its subject) contained sharp attacks against the working-class movement and especially against the Communists. When fascism was on the upsurge, Pius XII heaped curses on \"materialist and atheist communism\". John XXIII's \"Mater at Magistra\", written in much more fraternal and humane tones, marked a significant change in the style of the Pope; it heralded, in a way, a return to that image of Christianity which was brought into being by movements of the exploited, movements which in the past had been religious in character and had usually been considered heretical. But the most important new feature introduced by the encyclical was its approval of socialisation, understood as \"the progressive multiplication of relations in society, with different forms of life and activity and juridical institutionalisation\". John XXIII emphatically refuted the fears of his predecessors in the following words: \"Ought it to be concluded, then, that socialisation, growing in extent and depth, necessarily reduces men to automatons? It is a question which must be answered in the negative.\" As for the social struggle in the epoch of the transition from capitalism to socialism, John XXIII expressed his sympathy for it or, at any rate, recognition of its historical necessity. \"Socialisation\", he said, \"is not to be considered as a product of natural forces working in a deterministic way. It is, on the contrary, as we have observed, a erstan tng an recognised the need for joint action based on un respect for the historical mass movements not connected with Christianity. New Campaign to Recruit Followers Undoubtedly a considerable part of the hierarchy understand \"aggiornamentO\" to mean the adoption of more modern and flexible methods and shedding, so to speak, all that is redundant, with a view to creating new possibilities for gaining followers. In the case of these groups it is a question of making up for time lost and of achieving by different means their old aims of ousting the Communists, neutralising the mass movement and blunting its militant character. The Catholic propaganda apparatus has been reorganised accordingly. A veritable army of sociologists is now at work. With practically unlimited resources at their disposal, they are making the fullest use of the advances in industry and sociology, in the system of \"human relations\", publicity and education. The International Catholic Centre of Social Research in Brussels with its ramified network of branches is the principal co-ordinating centre of this activity for Latin America. An enumeration of all the organisations engaged in clerical activity would take up too much space. Among the more important are those grouped according to ideological trends of international importance as, for example Opus Dei, also called the Sacred Society of the Holy Cross and the Works of the Lord. A reactionary integralist organisation, it has a membership of nearly 100,000 organised in 200 secret lodges in different parts of the world. Its rival organisation is the \"Left\" Economy and Humanism, headed by the Dominican, Lebret, who also heads several research centres, and around whom are grouped a large number of reformist priests and leaders of Christian-Democratic parties. Mention should also be made of Columbianum (Genoa), a Jesuit organisation for neo-colonialist contacts between Europe, on the one hand, and Africa, Asia and Latin America, on the other. The European-Latin American Centre is one of the branches of this organisation. Thus, a variety of trends are represented-from the \"Right\" Opus Dei, to the \"Centrist\" Columbianum and the \"Left\" Economy and Humanism. We are witnessing an intensive Catholic campaign to recruit new followers, a campaign which is being conducted much more effec- tively than in previous years, and directly among the masses. The \"marginal\" theory advanced by Christian sociologists recognises the tendency on the part of all individuals to join the social struggle, but notes at the same time that considerable sections of the population have not been able to achieve this either in the countryside or in urban working-class areas where women in particular play hardly any part inpublic life; the same is true, they add, of different social categories who have no access to culture. The Christian leaders of the new type pay special attention to these \"marginal\" sections which include people who have recently joined the ranks of the working class, farm labourers, men employed in Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/06/28: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400010030-5 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/06/28: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400010030-5 small workshops and the members of their families not engaged in production, and the petty-bourgeoisie. They appoint \"leaders\" from among these sections, form organisations for them, act as their spokesmen and channel their activity into reformism and certain forms of class collaboration. They call this policy \"popular advancement\". U.S. imperialism has rendered very substantial aid to the Chilean Church in its campaign to win now followers. it has supplied the Church, through the American Catholic charity organisation, with food, medicaments, clothing And money. The Chilean Cardinal, Raul Silva Henriquez, heads the charity organisation Caritas Internacional. . Quite a few Catholic organisations are financed from U.S. Imperialist Influence sources. One of the factors facilitating this is that the Vatican and What is the attitude of U.S. imperialism to the new clerical religious orders invest their capital in those U.S. monopolies policy? operating in Chile and in Latin America generally, which announced In his interesting article, \"The Ideological Offensive of Catholicism in advance their readiness to give part of their profits to aid the in Latin America: the Social Sciences\" published last year in the clerical institutions. Uruguay journal Estudios, Manuel Facal noted that one of the decisive factors contributing to the proliferation of new Catholic organisations is the financial support given by U.S. and West European foundations, mostly non-clerical. Although the Gregorian University in Rome indisputably remains the alma mater of this tendency, after the Alliance for Progress was launched and, in general, beginning with the first steps of President Kennedy's Administration, the United States became the second centre. The Belgian Jesuit Roger Vekemans, the \"grey eminence\" of the Christian-Democrat government of Chile, welcomed the Alliance for Progress with the same enthusiasm. as his European fellow-priests had welcomed the Marshall Plan. Vekemans has established in Santiago the Centre for the Economic and Social Development of Latin America, which has links with the Organisa- tion of American States. This Centre collaborates with the Loyola University in New Orleans. The relations between imperialism and the modern clerical trends are not those of unconditional' subordination of the latter to the former; they are more in the nature of reciprocal relations.

Having failed to split the working class, the Latin American, Confederation of Trade Unions set up its own organisa- impop, the Chilean Trade Union Movement (ASICH) which trains union officials and operates inside the unions. The Christian- Democratic Latin-American Federation of Peasants and Farm Labourers has, on the contrary, been able to establish parallel organisations, which in the struggle for agrarian reform are beginning to carry out joint actions with the Federation of Peasants and Indians, an affiliate of the Trade Union Centre of Working People. The ultra-reactionaries in the Pentagon and the State Department who consider violence and military dictatorships to be the lot of Latin America do not believe in the effectiveness of the actions of the clericals and, as it rule, view their reformism with hostility. It is symptomatic, however, that a paper like El Mercurio (Santiago), mouthpiece of the U.S. Embassy and known for its sympathies for p the \"gorillas\", should at the same time support the Catholic groups, in power.

The religious world, in the throes of a crisis, is rent by many contradictions. However, the theological changes, far from miti- gating these contradictions, are exacerbating them. The result is a deep-going moral conflict attended by many misgivings and far- reaching aspirations. Many Catholics, including priests, go much farther than the stand proposed by their colleagues who are anxious to adapt Catholicism to the condition of the last phase of capitalism in 'order to maintain contact with the masses, and to .retain their influence, at any price, on the historical process. The well-known and instructive example of the worker priests, many of whom have, become imbued with the spirit of class consciousness, is now being repeated on a wider scale. Imperialism's investments in some of the clerical organisations might well lead to results it least expected. There was it time when the broad-minced approach of the Jesuits to the new social reality of our times setmed astonishing. In Chile the Jesuit college San Ignacio educated several generations of Christian-Democrats, the first to join progressive movements. But the Jesuits soon systematised their aims in the framework of reformism which Roger Vekemans hitched to the Alliance for Progress, thus revealing its feebleness. The reformism of the Jesuits is limited. It assiduously avoids anything that might injure the U.S. monopolies. And yet the Jesuits have had to release the deluge, held in check so long and whose course they cannot block. Although a ncu-colonialist trend was apparent at the Second Vatican Council, with Paul VI as its main spokesman, the voices of other prelates were heard during the deliberations, among them H:~,'.- Camara of Brazil and Tchidimo of Guinea, who went further. And it is not a question of individual dignitaries. Constant contacts with Catholics in the trade unions, in residential areas and in the mass movements show that a large number of them want tc break with capitalism. The same is true also of many priests. Thl men of this trend sincerely believe that the democratisation of their churches would be a truly Christian undertaking.
