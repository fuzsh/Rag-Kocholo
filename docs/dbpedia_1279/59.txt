The various pastoral and evangelization interventions promoted by Cardinal Silva Henríquez include, in general, three elements that still appear essential today in addressing many of the challenges the current pandemic continues to awaken in the Church, in civil society, in politics, and in the economy: unifying gazes and with common purposes so the current crises are transformed into opportunities for recovery and consolidation.

- Formation in the life of the Chilean rural world, with a family of 17 siblings, which helped to forge in him a courageous and determined character to face needs and adversities. With the pandemic, we are re-learning the courage to overcome crises and to remember that we need each other.

- As a Salesian, the educational dimension of every process of formation and accompaniment of young people according to Don Bosco's proposal: to be good Christians and upright citizens remains the motto which, in the life of school courtyards and in Salesian classes, is of vital importance. With the pandemic, we are learning to revive this practice in the virtual environment with the presence of an accompaniment that builds and fosters trust.

- As an exponent of the Chilean Church, the Cardinal took up the requests and was himself an expression of closeness to the people and the most needy, promoting numerous actions and works of solidarity. With the pandemic, we empathize and support those who suffer most and we suffer for not being able to be close to those who need it most. Let us take part in initiatives that bring the necessary aid into their homes.

In this perspective, a few days after the launch of the new encyclical Fratelli Tutti - Brothers All of Pope Francis, it is appropriate to recall the example of Card. Raúl Silva Henríquez to strengthen courage, cultivate goodness and multiply solidarity as an expression of human brotherhood.
