        "text": "Minnesota’s exports to Mexico have jumped more than 250 percent in the last decade, and Gov. Mark Dayton said Thursday there’s room to match that increase in coming years.\n\nThe governor is in the middle of a trade mission to Mexico alongside a delegation of three dozen state and business leaders. The group is meeting with Mexican officials this week with an eye toward deeper trade ties and education partnerships.\n\nSo far, Dayton said on a conference call from Guadalajara, it has been the most productive trade mission since he took office. Mexico stepped into the spotlight as a primary trade partner for Minnesota businesses last year, when it leapfrogged China to become the state’s No. 2 foreign customer with $2.2 billion in exports received.\n\n“We’ve already seen a really dramatic increase in our exports to Mexico and we should aim to double that,” Dayton said, pointing to opportunities for trade expansion in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors.\n\nLast year alone, Mexican exports from Minnesota surged 52 percent to $2.2 billion, according to state figures. Only Canada spent more on Minnesota-made goods, with $5.6 billion purchased in 2014.\n\nKathleen Motzenbecker, executive director of the Minnesota Trade Office, attributed the increase to two significant changes that in recent years have reshaped Mexico’s appetite for imports and the North American trade marketplace in general.\n\nFirst, North American companies and consumers are loosening their relationships with China, mainly by bringing their operations on shore and seeking out products made closer to home. Mexico’s major commercial centers are geographically closer and in the same time zone as Minnesota, making it easier to cultivate relationships and follow through on deals.\n\nIn addition, Motzenbecker said, the Mexican economy is going strong two decades after the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement. Purchasing power is up, stoking demand for a wider range of high-quality products.\n\n“These are things we see on a continued trajectory. We anticipate further growth,” she said. “We want to make sure we are in good touch with our neighbors – Canada and Mexico – and we’re pleased to hear Gov. Dayton’s commitment to this.”\n\nMinnesota’s agriculture industry will continue to be a primary growth driver as the state seeks to boost trade with Mexico.\n\nAlready, local farmers are a major supplier of soybean, corn products and wheat products into Mexico. The country last year imported grains, including soybeans and soybean flour, worth $127 million, according to state numbers, marking a 261 percent increase over the previous year.\n\n“When people have more resources available, they invest in food and so we’re really pleased to be a major suppliers, state Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson said. “We have a big crop coming in and we can’t use all we produce, so export markets are incredibly important.”\n\nAside from work to expand trade, Dayton and the delegation – including representatives from Minnesota’s biggest colleges and universities – struck education-related agreements with Mexican officials.\n\nPartnerships between Mexican and Minnesotan schools would broaden student and faculty exchanges and streamline research collaborations.\n\nTransforming Minnesota into the Silicon Valley of water technologies will require more than just a loose collection of businesses working in the same field, Ecolab CEO Doug Baker told an economic development conference this week.\n\nIt will require “thought leadership” and tangible benefits that make the costs of moving or expanding here worth the risks, Baker said during a speech at the International Economic Development Council’s spring conference at the Radisson Blu Mall of America.\n\nWhile Minnesota is billed as a hub of water technology companies, Ecolab offers an example of the limits to such claims to fame: Its 2,760 workers in Minnesota comprise only 3.5 percent of the company’s workforce, while just 1 percent of the company’s sales are in Minnesota, Baker said. Most of the company’s water research is in Chicago and the Houston, Texas, area.\n\n“Somebody’s going to have to create a magnet and change gravity because right now gravity says I leave it there,” he said. “We have, if you will, a number of companies, but I don’t know that that alone creates a cluster because we don’t all have our research here.”\n\nBaker’s comments came in response to Minnesota’s push to become a so-called “water cluster.” He and other leaders in the effort say the above average number of water technology companies in the Land of 10,000 Lakes gives the state a competitive advantage in creating technology for a resource that’s only going to become more limited.\n\nThe concentration of water and wastewater treatment technology in Minnesota is about 39 percent greater than the national average. The state’s industry had about 900 entities employing 16,334 people in 2012, according to the Minnesota Trade Office.\n\nSt. Paul-based Ecolab produces wastewater treatment products, membranes and other water technology products for a variety of industries. Chaska-based Aeration Industries creates technology that aerates water.\n\nThe state’s companies do a good job of seeking one another out when necessary, said Steve Riedel, an international trade representative with the Minnesota Trade Office. But he agrees with Baker about a need for leadership to make the most of the opportunity.\n\n“There are all kinds of ingredients to an industrial cluster, and it’s usually driven by government for economic development reasons,” he said.\n\nStill, there’s a reason those companies are here in the first place, said Lee Munnich, a senior fellow and director of the State and Local Policy Program at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs.\n\nBack in the 1970s and 1980s, Minnesota companies developed products centered on water issues. Minnesota’s water industry also grew as companies recognized that water use and conservation is likely to be a big issue in the future, and the university had researchers involved in water technology. The result is what Munnich describes as an “emerging cluster.”\n\n“It’s not completely clear how the cluster is going to evolve over time, but there are a lot of companies already here,” he said.\n\nBut the mere presence of other companies won’t be enough to persuade out-of-state companies to move here, Baker said. Relocation is a risky proposition. Not all of a company’s employees will make the move, and those who don’t are apt to wind up working for competitors.\n\nIt’s a tough decision for companies looking to retain the most talented workers, and they need to see some clear advantage before making the leap.\n\n“I don’t believe it’s economic incentives, in this case, that’s going to drive the formation of a cluster,” Baker said. “I believe it’s got to be thought leadership, and you’ve got to create a center of gravity that makes it smarter for us to, over time, move our research here versus somewhere else.”\n\nRiedel pointed to Minnesota’s medical device industry as an example of what could be done.\n\nCompanies like Medtronic invented successful products, and the university offered cutting-edge research. Employees eventually launched their own businesses; supporting industries and services started. In 1984, the state helped launch a trade association called Medical Alley to market the region and bring people in the industry together. The association eventually became strong enough to stand on its own and now exists as LifeScience Alley.\n\nThe state is exploring whether there’s sufficient interest to do something similar with water technology, Riedel said.\n\nIn 2012, the state ranked 10th in the nation with $729 million in foreign sales of water and wastewater treatment technology, according to the Minnesota Trade Office. Neighboring Wisconsin, with $647 million in water technology exports, is ranked 11th, and Milwaukee leaders have organized a Water Council, partnerships with universities and more to boost the industry.\n\nOne way to compete is to focus on a subset of the industry, Riedel said. On-site water reuse is one option because sustainability is becoming such a big issue.\n\n“This is not an original idea,” he said. “So in order to get noticed and get attention, you need a niche, something to set you apart.”\n\nMinnesota’s exports dipped slightly in 2013 after a record-breaking performance in 2012, according to a report out Thursday from the state Department of Employment and Economic Development.\n\nThe state exported $20.7 billion worth of manufactured, mining and agricultural products last year, down $106 million, or 0.5 percent, from a record $20.8 billion in 2012.\n\n“They held pretty steady,” said Kathleen Motzenbecker, executive director of the Minnesota Trade Office.\n\nThe release of annual export numbers lags the end of the year because of the time involved in compiling the data. DEED expects to have numbers for the first quarter of 2014 in the next few weeks.\n\nMinnesota ranked 20th in the nation for exports, the same as it did in 2012. The state had $3,823 in exports per person. That’s about 23 percent less than the national average of $4,994.\n\nThe state suffered its biggest loss in the mineral fuel and oil category, which plummeted $503 million or 69 percent between 2012 and 2013. In addition, the ores, slag and ash category fell $351 million or 53 percent.\n\nThe latter sector is a particularly volatile category, Motzenbecker said. If it’s excluded, the declines are much more modest.\n\nThis was the case for Minnesota’s largest trading partners — Canada and China.\n\nExports to Canada, Minnesota’s top export destination, fell 8 percent overall. But ores, slag and ash exports there fell $65 million and mineral fuel and oil exports dropped $284 million. Together the two categories accounted for $349 million, or 65.8 percent, of the $530 million total decline.\n\nSimilarly, ores, slag and ash exports to China decreased $37 million — more than twice the $16 million total decline for that country. Motzenbecker said she’s monitoring exports to China in the wake of last year’s 1 percent decline but that she’s not unduly concerned yet.\n\nThird-ranked Mexico was the standout among the state’s export destinations. Mexico didn’t break into the state’s top five export destinations until 2008. But since then, exports to Mexico have grown 71 percent. Between 2012 and 2013, Minnesota boosted exports there by $178 million or 14 percent. Machinery, electrical machinery and vehicles had the biggest growth.\n\nMachinery remained Minnesota’s biggest export, but it slipped by 1 percent to $4 billion. Losses were particularly acute in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy.\n\nOn the plus side, food byproducts rose 19 percent to $613 million in response to growing demand in the Philippines, China and Mexico. Orders from the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia contributed to 32 percent growth in the $606 million aircraft and spacecraft sector. And the beverage sector — which covers denatured alcohol not for consumption — grew 71 percent to $350 million to serve Canadian demand for biofuels.\n\nA proposed free trade agreement between the European Union and the United States could increase Minnesota’s exports to the region by 40 percent and bring 15,000 new jobs to the state, a Swedish trade representative said Monday in Minneapolis.\n\nU.S. and foreign officials on Monday opened the fifth round of negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership treaty in Washington, D.C. But at a Minnesota Trade Office forum at Dorsey & Whitney’s office, U.S. Rep. Erik Paulsen promoted the treaty with Swedish Ambassador Björn Lyrvall and Andreas von Uexküll, the Embassy of Sweden’s “minister counselor head of trade and economic affairs.”\n\nUexküll’s numbers echo a joint report promoting the treaty from the Atlantic Council, the Bertelsmann Foundation and the British Embassy.\n\nMinnesota’s annual exports to Sweden are worth $113.7 million, and Sweden estimates that those exports support about 1,054 jobs. A comprehensive trade agreement would make those numbers much bigger, Lyrvall said.\n\n“These are positive and good numbers — and they could be improved even further,” he said. “It’s the most complex and most important [trade agreement] being struck ever.”\n\nMinnesota’s medical device industry received particular attention because of the treaty’s focus on streamlining the two markets’ regulatory procedures. Tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean are already low, so the treaty focuses much of its attention on aligning non-tariff regulations, standards, testing requirements and other “behind-the-border measures that needlessly increase the cost of trade,” said Paulsen, a Republican member of the bipartisan Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Caucus in Congress.\n\nVon Uexküll estimated that 80 percent of the treaty’s benefits arise from such non-tariff measures. The challenge negotiators face is that non-tariff measures are the main points of contention between the two sides.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and other officials object to the Europeans’ insistence that the agreement cover financial services. They argue that could water down reforms under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Financial regulation is not a trade issue and should not be included in the trade agreement, they say.\n\nSimilarly, Europeans want to exclude their mass media and culture sectors because they say it is necessary to protect cultural and linguistic diversity. Certain French treaties, for example, allow for subsidized mass media and quotas for local shows and music on TV and radio.\n\n“There are loads of issues where we are probably not able to make it all the way,” Uexküll said. “But you should also see it as a living agreement. The facts on the ground will change, and maybe as we move along, there will be a time when some of the things that we will not agree on will be possible.”\n\nPaulsen said he has sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman asking for financial services to be included in the treaty. Yet he doesn’t see the treaty moving forward until after this November’s midterm elections.\n\nThe Minnesota Trade Office is not officially promoting or lobbying for the treaty, said Kathleen Motzenbecker, the office’s executive director. Still, the state views measures that ease trade, such as TTIP and the comparable Trans-Pacific Partnership “in a very positive light,” she said.\n\nThe Trade Office has sponsored a handful of forums about the proposal, most recently a speech in March by European Union Ambassador João Vale de Almeida.\n\n“We want to see trade fostered on both sides of the Atlantic,” she said.\n\nThe Land of 10,000 Lakes may still be covered in ice, but water was on the minds of state officials and business leaders who gathered Tuesday at Ecolab’s Schuman Campus in Eagan.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development’s Water Technology Business Summit, attended by more than 150 people, is the latest of 19 state-sponsored events since 2009 that have aimed to make the most of the state’s position as a leader in water technology.\n\nMinnesota’s water technology companies make up one of the state’s so-called business clusters, a group of closely related industries operating in a particular region, said Lee Munnich, a senior fellow and director of the State and Local Policy Program at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs.\n\nIn 2012, the state ranked 10th in the nation for $729 million in foreign sales of water and wastewater treatment technology. In all, the industry’s concentration in Minnesota is about 39 percent greater than the national average, a measure called a location quotient.\n\nThe economic activity can be seen in the major companies operating in Minnesota. Switzerland-based Pentair, which has its U.S. headquarters in Golden Valley, worked with Target Field on a water reuse system that saves 2 million gallons of water a year. Chaska-based Aeration Industries creates technology that aerates water. St. Paul-based Ecolab produces wastewater treatment products, membranes and other water technology products for a variety of industries.\n\nThe industry had about 900 entities employing 16,334 people in 2012, according to the Minnesota Trade Office. The size of the workforce is on par with those in the hospitality and tourism or entertainment industries, Munnich said during a presentation. Pay for workers in the Twin Cities ranges from $20.87 per hour for chemical equipment operators and tenders to $53.30 for natural sciences managers, according to Greater MSP.\n\nMunnich said in an interview after his presentation that Minnesota has become a water powerhouse largely because existing companies see business opportunities.\n\nRyan Rogers, a global business manager for water infrastructure renewal in 3M Co.’s Electrical Markets Division, described how the Maplewood-based company’s scientists created a lining that seals leaking pipes without forcing utility companies to dig a trench.\n\nThe opportunities for making money could be huge. By 2025, about 40 percent of the world’s population, or 3.2 billion people, are expected to live in “water-stressed environments,” Rogers told attendees. That’s up from 24 percent, or 1.6 billion, in 2007. With about 20 percent of water lost through leaky pipes and other network problems across the globe, there will be great demand for 3M and others like it to provide technology that makes the most of limited resources.\n\nMichael Langley, CEO of Greater MSP, said the industry meshes well with other strong industries in the state — such as medical devices and food — that address growing challenges.\n\n“Our economic development premise is that food solutions, water solutions and health solutions will drive the global economy,” said Langley, whose regional economic development group was among the event’s sponsors.\n\nBut competition from other water clusters is huge, as well. Wisconsin, with $647 million in water technology exports, is ranked 11th behind Minnesota. Milwaukee leaders have organized a Water Council, partnerships with universities, and more to boost the industry. Todd Gleason, Pentair’s senior vice president for growth, noted that his company accounts for a third of Milwaukee’s water technology jobs.\n\n“Make no mistake about it: Milwaukee is creating a cluster,” Gleason said.\n\nMinnesota’s water technology workforce has also declined from a high of 22,584 in 2008 to 15,781 in 2011, according to the Minnesota Trade Office.\n\nStill, the 11,395 water-related jobs in the Twin Cities in 2012 were about twice that of Milwaukee and ahead of other Midwestern challengers like St. Louis; Oakland County, Mich., and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, according to Greater MSP. That total is expected to grow 9 percent over the next decade.\n\nMeanwhile, state leaders plan to continue efforts to make Minnesota a water leader. The Trade Office and other organizations have roundtables planned. Twelve University of Minnesota researchers, led by Munnich, are submitting a grant request to study commercialization activities.\n\n“It is exciting to see an industry with so much potential right in our sweet spot,” Langley said.\n\nMinnesota innovation is falling off. At least, that’s how the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce read the tea leaves at presentations to business groups in February.\n\nIn 2003-04, 75.5 percent of the 550 Minnesota companies contacted by the chamber reported that they introduced a new product in the previous year. By 2012-13, that had fallen to 63.4 percent of 722 companies surveyed. The rate was just 55.9 percent for the 195 Twin Cities companies surveyed that year.\n\n“You have to constantly be innovating or else someone is going to out-innovate you,” said Bill Blazar, the chamber’s senior vice president for public affairs and business development. “I’m not sure that we are innovating and creating both new ideas and new services as quickly as we need to.”\n\nAnd yet, the situation may not be that dire. Business filings in Minnesota actually grew 15 percent over the past eight years, from 50,666 in 2006 to 58,260 in 2013, according to data from the Secretary of State’s Office. Filings reached an all-time high of 63,338 in 2009.\n\nSecretary of State Mark Ritchie expects filings to grow 20 percent over the next eight years. His office is so confident in that projection that the agency is investing in measures to handle the bigger loads.\n\nMinnesota is also in the midst of a patent boom that started in 2010, according to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office statistics. The 3,902 patents that originated from Minnesota in 2012 (the latest year available) marked the third consecutive year the state saw patents hit an all-time high. By contrast, there were just 2,535 patents from Minnesota as recently as 2008.\n\nThe University of Minnesota’s Office for Technology Commercialization has launched new programs to make it easier and less risky for companies to license university technology. In 2013, the office spun off a record 14 startup companies, had a record 91 new licenses and filed a record 148 new U.S. patents, according to the office.\n\n“From my purview at the university, I see increased activity,” said Jay Schrankler, the office’s executive director.\n\nBut the best evidence that Minnesota is a place for innovative businesses may be the way out-of-state companies are spending their money here, Ritchie said. He ticked off several major investments, such as new FedEx distribution centers and an Underwriters Laboratories expansion in Mounds View.\n\n“You just see nothing but their heavy investment in expanding capacity,” he said. “They’re certainly betting with their dollars.”\n\nMeasuring success\n\nInnovation is hard to quantify. “I’ve never seen anything that can measure it in a firm way,” Ritchie said.\n\nBlazar is the first to admit the chamber’s surveys aren’t definitive. The chamber interviewed a small fraction of the state’s businesses, and those companies weren’t randomly selected. The chamber is in the process of digging into the details further.\n\nAt times, it seems every positive indicator is offset by a negative statistic. Minnesota scored dead last on last year’s Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, which looks at the proportion of residents in a state who start a new business. About 0.15 percent of Minnesotans started a new business in 2012, half the nationwide average of 0.3 percent.\n\nMichael Mrnak, a Minneapolis-based business banking senior client manager with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, saw inertia like that in last year’s tepid loan growth. As Finance & Commerce reported early this month, the 3.09 percent growth that Minnesota banks had at the end of 2013 is about half the 20-year median. That’s partly because fewer new businesses are entering the market, Mrnak said. While he has seen companies looking to acquire manufacturers and distributors as baby boomers sell their businesses, he hasn’t seen the same appetite for starting new small businesses.\n\nNew Minnesota businesses also die at slightly greater rates than those in other parts of the country, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Of the 7,297 Minnesota businesses launched in the year ending March 2009, 59.8 percent were still around in 2013. The rate is 60.9 percent for the country as a whole.\n\nHard as innovation may be to quantify, Blazar said it’s a critical issue for the state because Minnesota is a “homegrown” economy. Every one of Minnesota’s 19 Fortune 500 companies — 3M Co., Medtronic and St. Jude Medical among them — started here. The big private companies like Minnetonka-based Cargill launched here as well.\n\nOutside companies often move into the state only after acquiring an existing Minnesota company. That’s what happened when Natick, Mass.-based Boston Scientific bought Guidant, which began life as Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. of St. Paul.\n\nMinnesota Cup director Melissa Kjolsing, who oversees the annual contest for new entrepreneurs, echoed that point: “Minnesota is a place that creates companies. We don’t attract companies.”\n\nThe U of M’s Schrankler said Minnesota is partly a victim of its own success. Because the state has so many successful companies, there hasn’t always been an urgency to cultivate new businesses or an organized way to help entrepreneurs find the right path forward.\n\nPeople working at large companies may have honed the necessary technical expertise, but they don’t always have the entrepreneurial skills they’ll need when starting a new business, he said.\n\n“I think there’s this notion in Minnesota that this must’ve worked in the past since that’s how all these companies got founded,” Schrankler said.\n\n‘Development of the economy’\n\nKjolsing said the business community is more active in supporting new businesses than it was in the past. Companies are working together and collaborating more often instead of sticking to themselves, and there are more resources available.\n\n“I would say [that] where we’re at today versus where we were 10 years ago, there is definitely a buzz around the startup community,” she said.\n\nStill, Schrankler says, the state should play a bigger role because entrepreneurs often struggle to find early-stage investors. He’d like to see Minnesota renew and expand its Angel Tax Credit program, which ran out by March 3 this year and is set to expire after 2014.\n\n“The trend for much of economic development has been: Let’s see if we can steal a company from Wisconsin or Florida to move here. But in the U.S., that’s a zero sum game,” he said.\n\nBlazar said Minnesotans need to take a more active role in helping businesses thrive. Too often people talking about “economic development” are focused on attracting specific types of businesses to specific, underused properties, he said.\n\nInstead of economic development, people should focus on “development of the economy,” Blazar said. That could be as simple as bringing businesses together. But it could also mean developing technologies to create new industries wholesale, as happened with taconite.\n\nBy the 1950s, the state’s iron mines were running dry. The University of Minnesota developed a way to economically extract iron from taconite formations. By the 1960s, companies were making major investments in an industry that still supports the Iron Range today. Blazar sees similar possibilities from the inaugural Minnesota Water Technology Business Summit, which the Minnesota Trade Office is hosting March 25.\n\n“Maybe the problem we have today is we haven’t focused enough recently on what those strategic industries are,” he said. “Instead, we’ve been captivated by real estate deals.”\n\nA proposed free trade agreement between the European Union and the United States would make it easier for Minnesota’s medical device companies and other businesses to clear regulatory hurdles, the European Union’s ambassador to the United States told attendees at a Minnesota Trade Office talk Monday.\n\nPart of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership focuses on what Ambassador João Vale de Almeida described as “regulatory convergence” during a speech to more than 70 people at the Minneapolis-based Dorsey & Whitney law firm.\n\nRight now, manufacturers’ products often must win approval from both European and U.S. regulators, even when the rules have the same high standards. As an example, Vale de Almeida noted that he rode in an American car after his arrival in Minneapolis without worrying that the car didn’t go through European safety checks. The trade agreement aims to eliminate that duplication, as well as tariffs and other trade barriers.\n\nDuplication has a cost. Multiple approval processes make it slower and costlier to bring products to market, Sarah Moeller, a CEO of The Greenlight Group, said in an interview after she listened to the talk.\n\nMoeller’s Minneapolis-based company runs clinical trials for diagnostics, nutrition and pharmaceutical companies. Greenlight has to navigate different standards for contracting, ethics reviews and other approval requirements depending on the country where the trial is taking place.\n\n“Sometimes it’s not as simple as EU and U.S.,” she added.\n\nVale de Almeida, a native of Portugal and former journalist, said aligning these standards could offer European and U.S. companies a competitive advantage over other regions. EU analysis estimates that the agreement would add $132 billion a year to the U.S. economy and $165 billion a year to the European economy. Tariffs between the two sides average 4 percent.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in an email to Finance & Commerce that the agreement would be the most significant trade agreement in years and that it would accelerate economic growth and generate high-quality jobs.\n\nNot everyone is on board with this convergence, though. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and other officials object to the Europeans’ insistence that the agreement cover financial services. They argue that could water down reforms under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Financial regulation is not a trade issue and so should not be included in the trade agreement, they say.\n\nVale de Almeida disagrees that U.S. banks are better regulated but conceded that Europe was more conservative in assessing risk when it comes to health, consumer safety and environmental issues. Europeans tend to believe that products should not be allowed until companies prove they’re not harmful, he said. Americans, on the other hand, tend to believe products should be allowed unless it’s proved they are harmful, he said.\n\nYet, he said, both sides have good reasons to reach a deal.
