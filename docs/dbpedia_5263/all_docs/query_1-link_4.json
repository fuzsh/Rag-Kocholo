        "text": "By Patrick Kennedy\n\nJune 3, 2019 at 3:56PM\n\nThrivent President and CEO Terry Rasmussen: “Our advisers love the mission and they like serving members. They like seeing members really engage in the community and, really, better communities. There’s nothing more enjoyable than being out in the field and listening to their stories.” (Star Tribune)\n\nAmong the North American cooperatives Cook studied, the average age is 75 to 90 years, partly because their structure, history and ownership tend to be more complicated than those firms traded on exchanges.\n\nThe average age of companies on the S&P 500 index was 20.2 years as of Jan. 1, 2018, according to Esgauge, an ESG intelligence and analytics firm that collects data on companies in the index.\n\n\"The low average age is surely the result of the profound transformation of the makeup of the S&P 500 in the last 30 years, for the increased M&A and buyout activities and the phenomenal growth of many new-economy companies,\" said Matteo Tonello, a managing director at the Conference Board, a business membership and research association.\n\nLike cooperatives, fraternal organizations are similarly long-lived. According to the American Fraternal Alliance — which advocates for 60 fraternal benefit organization members, including Thrivent — most fraternals were formed early in the 20th century, although some came to be shortly after the Civil War.\n\n\"The incredible longevity of these organizations is a testament to their adaptability, financial strength and the strong bond of shared values among their members,\" said Joseph Annotti, the alliance's CEO.\n\nMembers of these organizations also elect their board of directors and may sell and purchase products from the companies. CHS members might buy seed, fertilizer, ag-chemicals and fuel from CHS and then turn around and sell the grain they produce back to CHS. Depending on the type of membership organization members might also get other benefits.\n\nPatrick Kennedy\n\nReporter\n\nBusiness reporter Patrick Kennedy covers executive compensation and public companies. He has reported on the Minnesota business community for more than 20 years.\n\nSee More"
