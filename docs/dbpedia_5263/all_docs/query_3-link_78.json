First announced in May 2017, this marks the ultimate move in a long line of restructuring efforts that redefines Pentair as a pure-play water company.\n\nIn this Research Note, Bluefield’s water experts analyze the strategy behind Pentair’s restructuring and its position in the smart home and connected commercial building markets."
