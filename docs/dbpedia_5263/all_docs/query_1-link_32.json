        "text": "In January the Ackerberg Group joined a growing number of Twin Cities companies that have signed on as members of the Minnesota Sustainable Growth Coalition, a new effort to invest in clean energy, waste reduction and improved water management.\n\nMinneapolis-based Ackerberg is the first commercial real estate company to join the coalition. Chief Executive Officer Stuart Ackerberg said that commercial buildings “can have a negative impact on the world in which we live” and that he hoped to learn from larger coalition members how to leave a smaller environmental footprint.\n\n“We made the commitment as a company to really try to minimize the impact our property holdings have on our communities and the world,” Ackerberg said. “We want to look at how we can play a bigger role — by being more efficient, more effective and by being better stewards of our environment and of our communities.”\n\nThe coalition has gained traction quickly, attracting 32 members, according to Mike Harley, executive director of the Environmental Initiative, which convenes the partnership. The movement came out of a desire by several large corporations to do something significant about climate change and other environmental issues, he said.\n\nAmong the founders are Andersen Corp. of Bayport; Blaine-based Aveda Corp.; St. Paul-based Ecolab; Bloomington-based HealthPartners; Minneapolis-based Tennant Co.; Golden Valley-based Pentair; and Golden Valley-based Wenck.\n\nEliza Clark, Andersen’s director of sustainability, said the window and door manufacturer realized it could not by itself solve systemic problems within the industry and regional issues involving water and waste. “We’d gotten to the point in our journey where we needed to move beyond best practices to identifying projects that could drive real action,” she said.\n\nThe circular economy\n\nThe coalition uses as its organizing principle the emerging concept of a “circular economy” in which companies deploy clean energy for operations, minimize waste and reduce water use through everything from pervious pavers to green roofs, she said.\n\nHarley emphasizes that the coalition is the country’s first regional approach organized by business.\n\n“We want Minnesota to be the reference point for this transformation,” he said. “We are the only North American effort we’re aware of that is focused on the circular economy. There are examples in Europe, but there is no other regional initiative in North America other than this.”\n\nSharing best practices and working together on energy, water and organic waste isn’t as simple as it sounds. The Twin Cities’ economy is much broader than those in many other metropolitan areas. Ideas such as creating less wasteful supply chains are difficult because there are so many of them — for retail, health care, manufacturing, technology and so forth, Harley said.\n\nConquering global problems seemed to many coalition members an even more daunting challenge. Why not work together to, say, buy clean energy, share waste-reduction strategies, improve efficiency and create a platform to show the world how it is done?\n\n“Smart, progressive companies are thinking about what the sustainability agenda looks like in an era where collaboration — public and private, private to private, business to business — is going to be key to moving the needle and advancing,” Harley said.\n\nWith that in mind, the coalition chose to concentrate broadly on three areas: clean energy, the water infrastructure and organic waste. The first was the easiest because many companies have already set ambitious goals for renewable energy, including several that want their operations to run eventually on 100 percent clean power, Harley said.\n\nThe Minnesota Public Utilities Commission recently gave the green light to an Xcel Energy program called Renewable Connect. The utility now has the right to sell large amounts of renewable energy — from wind and solar farms — to corporate customers. Coalition members could be among the first clients of Renewable Connect, he suggested.\n\n“Green and gray infrastructure,” another category, is not as fully developed though it will include dealing with water pollution issues through applications of rain gardens and other approaches.\n\nConfronting organic waste has just begun, too, though Harley suggested that companies may someday improve composting and share in the cost of building anaerobic digesters to “maximize the value of organic waste,” he said.\n\nWary of making it appear as though the coalition members will drive the circular economy while leaving others behind, Harley points out the movement will spread to smaller concerns. Minnesota corporations with national and international operations can grow the circular economy by establishing best practices for others to adopt.\n\n“These are the companies that have the position, the responsibility, the resources to help accelerate our progress, he said. “In any of these efforts we’re going to be sure to open those opportunities to all businesses in all communities.”\n\nAckerberg’s approach\n\nSince joining the coalition, Ackerberg already has begun to set goals and make changes. And what the company learns in this regard, from buying clean energy to offering new products, will be shared with other real estate-related organizations, Stuart Ackerberg promised.\n\nOne goal Ackerberg has set for this year is a 20 percent reduction in energy consumption. Part of the challenge, he said, is that tenants control their own space and may not share the company’s enthusiasm for energy reduction. Still, Ackerberg said a compelling argument can be made to tenants that better energy and water management will decrease their utility bills.\n\nTo that end, Ackerberg set up a task force of building managers to work on energy strategies. One goal is to share information — videos, studies and data — with tenants and hope it goes to the right individual — which is easier said than done.\n\n“The trick is how do we communicate that to all our relationships at the right level?” Ackerberg said. “The materials we send out might end up with an accountant, and we may need to get to the office manager, or C-level person, to say this is really important. We can suggest that these are three or four steps that can help [them] financially and make the world better.”\n\nThe company has never had a focused effort on energy efficiency like this one, he said. Learning how to collect the right data and learning how to use it to see if progress has occurred is a key. “It will be fun to see how this plays out this year,” he said.\n\nAckerberg Senior Managing Director Jackie Knight has been attending coalition meetings with a colleague, Senior Development Manager Frank Clark. One of the topics under discussion has been on improving electric car infrastructure, she said. Ackerberg has no fleet it can electrify, but it does have tenants who might drive electric vehicles if they had access to charging stations, Knight said.\n\nThe company is considering adding charging stations in new projects and encouraging others in the real estate industry to do the same. Charging stations had not been a priority in Ackerberg’s portfolio before joining the coalition, Knight said, but learning more about it from other members may change that.\n\nThe coalition has offered a sense of excitement for Knight.\n\n“We all go to a lot of public and private meetings with passionate individuals talking about a problem,” Knight said. “With this organization, you have amazing people talking about how to solve problems. There is a different energy and momentum you see in the meetings that I think is positive and it’s exciting to be a part of it.”"
