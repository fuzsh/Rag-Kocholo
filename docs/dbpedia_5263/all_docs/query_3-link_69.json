        "text": "KeyBanc's Jeffrey Hammond raised their price target on Pentair (NYSE: PNR) by 5.4% from $92 to $97 on 2024/07/24. The analyst maintained their Strong Buy rating on the stock.\n\nAfter reviewing Pentair's 2024/07/23-dated Q2 2024 earnings report, Hammond said they remained impressed by the company's \"self-help measures,\" which have allowed for significant margin improvement to continue even though the macro environment is slightly unstable.\n\nWith a clearer view of the whole picture, the analyst said they left the earnings call with more faith in their thesis.\n\nIn addition, Hammond believes that the stock will continue to re-rate higher in the long run because of the undervaluation of \"significant transformation tailwinds\" at current levels.\n\nEarnings Report\n\nFor Q2 2024, Pentair reported:\n\nEPS of $1.22, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 and, by 18.5%, Q2 2023's $1.03.\n\nRevenue of $1.1B, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.76% and, by 1.9%, Q2 2023's $1.08B.\n\nManagement guided:\n\nFor Q3 2024:\n\nEPS of $1.06 to $1.08.\n\nRevenue decline of 2% to 3%.\n\nFor FY 2024:\n\nEPS of $4.25.\n\nRevenue growth of 0% to (1)%.\n\nPresident & CEO John L. Stauch commented “We delivered a strong Q2 driven by continued execution across our balanced water portfolio.\n\n“Our pool segment returned to sales growth and all three of our segments drove significant margin expansion due primarily to strong productivity in Transformation.\n\n“I’m equally excited about the early stages of our 80/20 analysis which provides further confidence in our long-term growth and margin targets that we introduced at our March Investor Day.\n\n“During the quarter, we delivered strong free cash flow which we deployed to further strengthen our balance sheet, restart our share repurchases, and pay a dividend.\n\n“As a dividend aristocrat, we have increased our dividend for 48 consecutive years.”"
