        "text": "Prepping for the lesson Last November my granddaughter Raya called me super excited about a field trip she would take in January 2024. The conversation went something like this:\n\nRaya: “Nana, will you volunteer to come to JA BizTown with me on a class field trip?”\n\nMe: “Raya, tell me more about JA BizTown, what you will be doing, and why you want me to come.”\n\nRaya: “JA BizTown is a city with lots of different businesses, just like our city. Our whole fourth grade is going and we get to run the businesses. We need adults to volunteer to help us when we get stuck and don’t know how to do something.”\n\nMe: “Raya, how will you know how to run a business?”\n\nRaya: “Well, we are starting next week to learn all about different things about how business works, how to be a good citizen, and what it’s like to have a job instead of being in school.”\n\nMe: “Raya, that sounds super interesting. I would be happy to volunteer. And by the way, why are you asking me and not your mom or dad?”\n\nRaya: “Because you own a business, so you know how to make the business work!”\n\n(She knows how to flatter her Nana!)\n\nAs the weeks passed, Raya reported she had learned how to write checks, make deposits to her bank account, balance her checkbook, earn money, pay for things, and even vote!\n\nAs the field trip approached, Raya’s classmates had elected her to be the CEO of the company she would be running—Cambria. When she asked me if I knew what Cambria did and if I could help her, I wondered if she could see me smile.\n\nInspiring experience JA BizTown was so much more than I expected, with 18 companies participating: Cambria, Delta Airlines, US Bank, KS95 radio, Federated Insurance, Mortenson Construction, Cargill, Pentair, Polaris, United Healthcare, Xcel Energy, City Hall, JA Café, and more. Some roles assigned to students included CEO, sales manager, CFO, production engineer, radio DJ, design consultant, bank teller, table server, technician, and design engineer.\n\nUpon arriving, students received a job description of their role. They were immersed in a simulated economy, giving them real-world, hands-on experience in applying their classroom learning.\n\nIt was gratifying to watch fourth graders build financial skills, collaborate with classmates to solve problems, understand civic responsibilities, learn skills, and establish a mindset to build a thriving community—the skills you need to succeed in business and contribute to your community.\n\nAs the CEO, Raya had to do things that were not always comfortable, like giving a two-minute speech to community citizens, overseeing other students working for Cambria, applying for a loan, and working with the CFO to ensure there was money for payroll. As the day rolled on, she and her classmates gained confidence in their work, became increasingly diligent, and became more fully engaged with the community.\n\nAnd I became convinced that the future is in good hands as long as we teach our children well and let them lead.\n\nMentoring grownup employees My JA BizTown experience reminded me that grownups and the organizations they work for benefit greatly from mentoring. An effective mentoring program helps attract and retain great people.\n\nIt makes people feel like they matter – “people here want me to succeed.”\n\nIt’s ideal for knowledge transfer, with more experienced employees sharing specific insights related to systems and processes. Younger, newer mentees may provide technology knowledge transfer to their mentors.\n\nMentors support career development by guiding mentees on their career paths and setting goals for the next step.\n\nMentoring also leads to great leadership skills, preparing people to be the next leaders and creating strong bench strength and succession planning across the organization.\n\nIn general mentoring:\n\nIncreases confidence\n\nExpands the employees’ internal network\n\nExpedites skill acquisition and proficiency\n\nCreates a deeper understanding of the company (culture, ethos, values, practices)\n\nCreates better/greater problem-solving skills\n\nGetting started Here are some basic first steps in adopting mentorship:\n\nIncorporate mentorship as part of your people development strategy.It can be as simple as including “growth” in your values instead of a disciplined HR process. You could start by having existing employees volunteer to mentor new staff members.\n\nMentorship, delivered authentically, shows that you care about employees’ professional progression. To understand a mentee’s ambitions and capabilities, successes and challenges, and ways you can help them move, design a questionnaire to share with the mentor.\n\nConsider making your program a more systematic and thoughtful program, once your casual mentorship program is off and running. You may want to include any or all of these three types of mentoring: formal, informal, and peer-to-peer. In any case, provide clear guidelines about how the program operates, including the roles and expectations of mentors and mentees. This will help mentees to set achievable real goals and focus on areas where they need to improve."
