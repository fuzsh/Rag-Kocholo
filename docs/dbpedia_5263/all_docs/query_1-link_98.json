        "text": "HELP!!\n\nFor weeks now and actually periodically for months- 2 year old pool, my pump shuts off with error and causes the system to not circulate. I have checked for air...leaves..., water seems to fill the basket fine, but then kicks off!\n\nToday, I noticed that I could turn on the air blower to the spa and the cleaner, and the waterfalls, and the pump seems to stay on. Then I noticed that after shocking the pool (due to no chlorine circulation for almost a week) I got the pump to work and stay on, but the spa is yuck, and not getting any circulation!\n\nI hate this pool, it has never been 'no hassle' as advertised.\n\nI have a new Pentair Intelliflo VS + SVRS. Please help\n\nJ,\n\nWelcome to TFP... A Great resource for all your new pump issues...\n\nThis is the downside of having the SVRS option... Sigh. The pump basically thinks that something is blocking the input line to the pump and is shutting down.\n\nSo, either the pump is bad, and since it is new should be covered under warranty, or there really is a problem with the input line.\n\nMy guess is that you have a plumbing issue, or a plumbing design issue, but that is just a guess.\n\nHow about providing us with a couple of pics of your equipment pad, showing the valves on the input side to the pump and another showing the whole pad.\n\nWhen was the last time you cleaned your filter?\n\nWhat is your current filter pressure?\n\nWhat color is your water?\n\nDoes your pool have an automation system?\n\nHow do you currently chlorinate your pool?\n\nThanks for posting and looking forward to your answers,\n\nJim R.\n\nSee answers below\n\nUnfortunately our Pool builder is a jerk and doesn't return phone calls because the large $150k large pool/ patio job had many other small issues that he was tired of dealing with.\n\nThis is te first time that the spa is not circulating. The pump has done this many times (but never for this long) and somehow I always get it to work for a while.\n\nHow do I post photos?? ;-) (I'm on mobile version)\n\nHow about providing us with a couple of pics of your equipment pad, showing the valves on the input side to the pump and another showing the whole pad.\n\nI will take photos tomorrow of the equipment/ valves.\n\nWhen was the last time you cleaned your filter?\n\n3 wks ago\n\nWhat is your current filter pressure?\n\nAbout 40\n\n(The dial is in 'clean filter' range). But we had a pool guy come and clean it about 3 wks ago.\n\nI never have opened the filter thing- have always paid a service to do it. And I wasn't here when they did.\n\nWhat color is your water?\n\nIt was cloudy blue/green\n\nSpa is now bright cloudy blue.\n\nDoes your pool have an automation system?\n\nYes\n\nHow do you currently chlorinate your pool?\n\nAuto Chlorinator with stacked tablets.\n\nBut since no circulation recently, I put in 2 scoops of chlorine granules and almost gallon of acid. (The chlorine test showed almost no chlorine prior)\n\n40 PSI is high for filter pressure. Filter may be clogged up with that blue muck or algae. You may need to shock you pool with liquid shock to clear the water and the filter.\n\nIs it possible that you could be low on water as for the pumps can sometimes suck more from a skimmer when the water is low and get air in the pump and that shuts it off.\n\nI thought that was high too\n\nBut I'm newby and can do things if there is a knob or handle, but big wrench thing- scares me! Lol\n\nWater is full and I even added water to the spa.\n\nDo you find it odd that when I turned on the 'air' to the spa, that I was able to keep the pump on?\n\nNow the pump has been running all day, and it is spa that is still, motionless.\n\nBtw: once I turned the cleaner off and air off, the pump shuts off again. But now with the cleaner on- it will stay on...\n\nDoes any of this make sense?\n\nJulz,\n\nOk... Based upon your answers here is what I think..\n\nYou have been using 3\" chlorine tablets which have over a period of time has increased the CYA level in your pool to a point that a normal amount of chlorine will no longer prevent algae.\n\nThe reason your water is not clear is because of the algae and this same algae is what is quickly clogging your filter.\n\nWith the filter clogged, the weak flow through the pump causes it to go into the SVRS safety mode and shut off.\n\nSorry, but I have more questions..\n\n1. What type of filter do you have?\n\n2. Can you please post a couple of pics of your equipment pad?\n\nThanks,\n\nJim R.\n\nIf I reset the system at the panel- then turn on the cleaner, then go to the small 'pool pump' panel and hit reset...\n\nThen the pump (and eventually cleaner) will come on, which is why the pool looks a lot better!!!! As you can see in pic, but the spa is still not circulating- thus cloudy and blue.\n\nDuring the summer we put the granules into the pool in addition to the tabs- but didn't over the winter, as the pool co said only needed when hot/ sunny.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhy isn't the spa circulating?\n\nWhy do I need the cleaner on to keep the pump on?\n\nThe spring 'fall' caused a lot of leaves and debris, but after that, I had pool guy clean/ chemicals (3x in march), and clean filter also.\n\nUghhh\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\nJulz,\n\nMore questions and something you can try..\n\n1. Does your spa \"normally\" overflow into your pool?\n\n2. I assume you have an EasyTouch Automation system. If so, do you also have the ScreenLogic system to control things via your PC or phone?\n\n3. I see you have the Intelliflo pump (a great pump). Do you know what speed it is running when the filter is at 35 to 40 PSI?\n\nSo, looking at your pics it appears to me your valves are in the Pool position with the Spa shut off. These are the two automated valves..\n\nPlease try pushing the \"V\" button and selecting the Spa mode.. I'm interested if both automated valves turn about 180 degrees from their current position.\n\nThen push it once more and see if it goes into the \"spillover\" mode.. (It may not..) If it does water should overflow into the pool.\n\nThen pushing it again should return it to its current position.\n\nI'm just trying to confirm the automated valves are working.\n\nI still think the main problem is a clogged filter.\n\nJim R."
