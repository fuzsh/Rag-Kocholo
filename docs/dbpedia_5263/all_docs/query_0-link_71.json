        "text": "This case study on culture and leadership is worth a listen! It's inspiring to hear from senior leaders who view culture, and culture evolution, as a business imperative and a pivotal enabler of their strategy. Some sticky concepts for me: 1) Spending minutes on the \"how\" (e.g., talent processes and culture) needs to be proportionate to the minutes spent on the \"what\" (the strategy) 2) Leader reflection \"at the end of the day, would I want to be led by me?\" If the answer is no, what should I do to show up differently tomorrow? 3) The incredible velocity that is possible when senior leaders (including the CEO) are in lockstep with what the culture needs to be and willing to commit the time to connect it to their desired business outcomes.\n\nOnly ONE day left to seize your chance at the Business Hunter Awards! ⏳The clock is ticking, and this is your final opportunity to be part of a prestigious event that celebrates business excellence in our region.

This is one of the key challenges of #AI #implementation. Several tensions emerge in this process, making the impact assessment of such technologies much more complex than commonly believed. With Nathan Perrott, Daniel Pfeiffer, and Steven Ehrlich, we explored some of these issues. I'm grateful to Radancy Europe for inviting me to join this panel at the Talent Acquisition Leaders Day. The interaction between research and practice is fundamental to generating new ideas to navigate these challenges 🚀\n\n🚀 Exciting Times!

Share your feedback and thoughts with me in the comments below. #operationalexcellence #cardinalhealth #highperformanceteams #grndublin\n\nThis week Grads of Life hosted an interactive discussion with cross-sector leaders on the value and ROI of skills-first talent practices. Insights centered on: 1) Buy-in for skills-first transformation cannot just be at the C-suite (whether CHRO/CDO/CEO) but across the top/bottom and all levels of the organization. 2) To have skills-first commitments move to action – ROI metrics and stories must be tailored to change agents across the organization. Hiring managers are the critical unlock - messaging needs to focus on what helps them be successful such as increased productivity with skills-first hiring, and cost savings of reduced turnover and internal mobility. 3) What GOL has been advocating for years - hiring managers, HR, etc. - those doing the work every day - need support, tools, and the space to discuss their concerns and hopes! Thank you and appreciation to our panelists representing so many GOL partners over the past 10 years Bank of America Blackstone United Airlines Walmart SHRM Foundation Business Roundtable OneTen Harvard Business School And thank you to exceptional GOL team planning this event! – Tori, Kayla, Kelly, Laura, Elyse Finally, check out SkillsSpeak.org an insightful - but quick! - read on how employers in their own words are finding, hiring, and growing skills-first talent!"
