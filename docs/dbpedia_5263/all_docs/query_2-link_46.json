If you have trouble receiving our emails, change your email preferences to allow all emails from Pentairaes.com and Pentair.com. If the problem persists, contact your ISP for assistance. Remember that you can call us at 877-347-4788 if you need your order-related questions answered immediately.\n\nIf you have ordered from us online before, then double check that you have entered your email address and password correctly. Passwords are case sensitive, so you have to pay attention to upper and lower case letters. If you have your password saved in a file on your computer, copying and pasting often works best.\n\nSIGNING IN ONLINE\n\nHow do I sign in when your website says my email address or password is invalid?\n\nIf you haven't ordered from us online before, you need to create a new account first (make sure you have an item in your shopping cart). On the first checkout page, type in the email address you want to use, click on the \"I am a new customer\" radio button to select it and then click the \"Sign In\" button to move to the next step in registering where you'll type your name and create a password.\n\nI ordered on your website before, but it's been a while. I want to sign in using my old email address, but how do I do that if your website says my password is invalid?\n\nIf you had an account on our old website (in use until March 10, 2008), then you can still use the same email address as before, but you'll have to reset your password first by clicking \"Forgot your password?\" Make sure your email spam filter will allow email from [email protected]. You'll receive an email with a new, randomly generated password that you can change later online if you wish.\n\nKeep in mind that all passwords are case sensitive, so you have to pay attention to upper and lower case letters if you type in your password. Also, if you use an auto-fill or autocomplete feature in your browser, you must type in or paste your new password once so your browser will save it and automatically use it in the future.\n\nHow do I change my password or email address?\n\nSign in after clicking \"My Account\" at the top of any webpage on Pentairaes.com, and then click \"Change your password\" or \"Change your email address\" to get started.\n\nSEARCH TIPS"
