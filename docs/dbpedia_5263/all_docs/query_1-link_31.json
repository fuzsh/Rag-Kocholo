The all-stock deal will transform Pentair, doubling it in size and giving it a stronger presence in fast-growing developing countries.\n\nThe deal, announced Wednesday, March 28, combines Tyco’s flow-control business with Pentair, creating a powerhouse in the industry. Investors cheered the merger, pushing shares of Pentair up 15 percent, to $46.32.\n\nRandall Hogan, Pentair’s chairman and chief executive, will lead the merged company.\n\n“The bottom line: This transaction creates an organization with the scale and reach to fully capitalize on the underlying trends driving customer demand,” Hogan told analysts Wednesday.\n\nWith the deal, Pentair adds valves, pipes and controls to its portfolio of water- and fluid-filtration systems for agriculture, commercial and residential markets. The company aims to capitalize on the increasing water, food and energy needs of a 4 billion-person global middle class, Hogan said.\n\nThe deal will give Pentair global reach and scale and a bigger presence in the industrial sector and fast-growth regions of Asia. As a larger company with a larger portfolio of products, there are more opportunities for cross-selling.\n\n“We’ll get more at bats for our heavy-hitting investments,” Hogan said.\n\nAfter the deal is completed, Pentair will more than double its revenue to $7.7 billion and its head count to 30,000. The combined company will be incorporated in Switzerland, where Tyco is currently, with main U.S. offices in Golden Valley.\n\nPentair has about 2,000 employees in Minnesota. Besides its headquarters, Pentair has plants in New Brighton, White Bear Lake and Anoka. Combined, the merged company will have more than 100 manufacturing plants and 90 service centers worldwide.\n\nFor Tyco’s part, the move is part of a strategy the company announced in September to break itself into three parts. The Pentair deal’s completion is contingent on that happening; the breakup is expected to close by the end of September 2012.\n\nHogan told analysts Wednesday morning that Pentair had been looking at ways to expand geographically. After Tyco’s breakup announcement, Pentair executives started looking at Tyco’s flow business. Hogan began talks with Edward Breen, Tyco International’s chief executive, in January.\n\nThe all-stock deal is valued at about $4.9 billion, including $275 million in assumed debt and minority interest of $94 million.\n\nUpon its completion, Tyco shareholders will own 52.5 percent of the combined company and Pentair shareholders will own about 47.5 percent. “We now have the opportunity to accelerate this value creation that would not be available to Tyco Flow on its own,” Breen told analysts.\n\n“I think it’s a transformational deal,” said Jim Krapfel, an analyst with Morningstar in Chicago. “It roughly doubles revenue, diversifies Pentair’s product lines and gives them more international exposure.”\n\nThere’s not a lot of product overlap. “It looks like a good strategic and product fit,” he said. “It does make sense.”\n\nThe deal is expected to add to Pentair’s 2013 adjusted profit by about 40 cents per share and will boost its annual profit to more than $5 per share by 2015, reflecting $200 million in expected savings pre-tax, largely by eliminating duplicate costs and streamlining operations, the company said.\n\nWhen the transaction closes, two new directors designated by Tyco will join Pentair’s board of directors. The Pentair executive team will remain in place.\n\nJulie Forster can be reached at 651-228-5189. Follow her at twitter.com/bizbeatPiPress.\n\nOriginally Published: March 28, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
