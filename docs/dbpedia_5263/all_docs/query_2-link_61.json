        "text": "Learn what to look for when buying and installing an ENERGY STAR certified pool pump.\n\nPlease see the Pool Pump Fact Sheet (PDF, 244 KB) to learn more about when you need a pool pump, how to know if your pool pump was installed properly, and how to choose a pool pump contractor.\n\nVariable speed and multi-speed pool pumps can help cut energy costs, as well as offer other desired features. For example, variable speed pumps are quieter, require less maintenance and last longer. Both variable speed and multi-speed pumps, through slower water filtration rates, allow for better and more effective filtration of the pool water. The slower circulation rates also put less strain on the filters, plumbing, and other parts of the system, reducing the chance of leaks, repairs, or premature plumbing component replacement.1 In addition, ENERGY STAR certified pool pumps can use more efficient motors and advanced hydraulic designs. ENERGY STAR certified pool pumps include in-ground pool pumps, above-ground pool pumps and pressure cleaner booster pumps.\n\nBeyond the pool pump you choose, the following are other ways to make your pool more energy-efficient:"
