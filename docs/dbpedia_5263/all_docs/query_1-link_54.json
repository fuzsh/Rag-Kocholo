        "text": "King led the organization to franchise records in corporate partnerships the past three seasons\n\nMINNEAPOLIS and ST. PAUL – The Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal named David King, Senior Vice President of Corporate Partnerships of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx a 40 Under 40 honoree. Since joining the Timberwolves and Lynx in 2014, King has earned multiple promotions, including his current role as Senior Vice President of Corporate Partnerships.\n\n“I’m incredibly grateful to be recognized and want to congratulate all the other honorees,” said King. “This award is truly a reflection of the incredible leaders who have invested in me, and the amazing team I’m blessed to work beside each day.”\n\n“David is one of the most genuine and hardworking leaders I have had the pleasure to work alongside,” said Timberwolves and Lynx Chief Executive Officer Ethan Casson. “He has established himself as one of the brightest corporate partnership executives inside our league, and I am thrilled he is being recognized with this well-deserved honor.”\n\nKing has led the franchise to three consecutive record-setting seasons in corporate partnerships with double digit revenue growth each year. Focused on building meaningful relationships with local brands, King’s team added Fortune 500 UnitedHealthcare, Pentair, Marvin, Post Consumer Brands, Schwan’s Company and nVent to its partnership roster. King was also responsible for helping secure the Timberwolves jersey patch partner, Aura.\n\nAn innovator in the industry, King has led multiple best practices in recent years. As the NBA opened International Marketing Rights, he was responsible for the team’s first international partner, Caribou Coffee, who activated at the 2023 NBA Abu Dhabi Games. Additionally, King worked alongside partner Pentair to create Career Development Training Camps, designed to empower, educate, and inspire BIPOC students.\n\nOn behalf of the Minnesota Lynx, King helped spearhead the creation of Changemakers, a new local platform aimed at elevating the next generation of female leaders. Target has signed on as the inaugural partner.\n\nThe 40 Under 40 awards are in its 31st year and recognize local leaders under the age of 40 for their professional accomplishments, community involvement and industry leadership. The editorial team at Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal selected this year’s class from hundreds of nominations.\n\nA feature profile on King and all honorees will be published online the week of March 18 and in a special print edition March 22. Honorees will be celebrated at an awards reception on March 21."
