        "text": "Today’s consumers expect automation to make their lives easier – from adjusting their home thermostat, to closing their garage door and cleaning with robotic vacuum cleaners – home automation devices are the norm.\n\nIt’s only natural this trend would take hold in the pool industry, with pool owners looking for ways to make it easier and more efficient to maintain their pools and spas. But as a pool professional, have you considered how automation can make your job easier and help you grow your business?\n\nHere are four tips for using automation to help take your pool business to the next level and provide your customers with more consistent, efficient and outstanding service.\n\nWork smarter with Pentair IntelliCenter® Pool Control System.\n\nThe IntelliCenter Pool Control System is the most versatile Pentair automation system, delivering better-than-ever technology to pool owners, servicers and builders.\n\nIt’s called the “brain of the pool” for a reason. With five to 40 relays, adding features such as colored lights, water features and more to the automation system is easy with the Setup Wizard’s optional step-by-step instructions and new proprietary autodetect functionality. The IntelliCenter system allows you to effortlessly set automation schedules, monitor pool and spa status, and check water chemistry.\n\nWhether it’s regular maintenance or something more complex, pool professionals can quickly troubleshoot problems, resolve issues, and get out of the backyard faster using the intuitive touch screen.\n\n“I’ve been using Pentair automation for over two decades now. The service from Pentair played a big role because they keep us up to date on what’s next and what’s coming,” said David Russell, owner of Preferred Pools of Houston. “Once you use IntelliCenter, it will probably be the only thing you want to sell.”\n\nAnd for customers with older automation systems who need an upgrade without replacing their whole system, use the IntelliCenter Upgrade Kit for IntelliTouch® and EasyTouch® pool control systems to easily upgrade their older pool automation systems to the latest technology. With the Upgrade Kit, you get all the benefits of IntelliCenter including an intuitive touch screen display that effectively shows functions and offers day and nighttime modes.\n\nThe Upgrade Kit turns legacy Pentair EasyTouch® or IntelliTouch® Control Systems, into a fully functioning IntelliCenter system. By building on the products’ existing capabilities to bring these systems up to date, it allows pool owners and professionals to experience all the latest features Pentair has to offer. And installation is easy: it installs on the current wiring and housing, just change the bezel, board and transformer.\n\nWith the IntelliCenter Upgrade Kit, it’s easy to give your customers what they want, and give yourself some new business too as you continue to add upgrades to their pool pads in the future.\n\nSave time in the backyard while offering an effortless pool experience.\n\nThe days of staying after hours at your customers’ homes for impromptu fixes to the pool pad are nearly over. Using remote monitoring accessed through their Pentair Pro account, pool professionals can remotely monitor a customer’s pool with the IntelliCenter Pool Control System.\n\nMonitoring and controlling your customers’ systems remotely will potentially prevent extra service trips to customers’ backyards while increasing your ability to offer white glove service to pool owners so they can enjoy an effortless pool experience. And because the system interfaces with iOS and Android mobile devices, it offers pool owners convenient, remote control from anywhere.\n\nSupport and service that has your back.\n\nWhite glove service isn’t just for your customers – it’s for you too. Pentair is happy to provide you with support that has your back 24/7. Dedicated automation specialists are available to help you over the phone or on the ground.\n\nPentair automation specialists like Pat Dickerson teach classes and give one-on-one training to pool builders. “I work with all aspects of automation, including setting up builders and homeowners with automation. Once they see the ease of use, they’re very receptive to using these platforms, especially IntelliCenter.”\n\nAs Pentair leads the charge in automation, customer service is prioritized to ensure pool professionals have the right technical support and are informed on how continued innovations will help customers have an effortless and joyful pool experience.\n\nIn addition to exceptional customer service, Pentair offers support through a warranty program available for both the Upgrade Kit and IntelliCenter. When these products are purchased as part of a bundle with other Pentair pool products, pool owners receive a three-year warranty for the full pool pad, instead of a one-year warranty when the products are purchased separately. With the purchase of the Upgrade Kit, your customers’ warranty and UL compliance will be maintained – giving them one less thing to worry about.\n\nUltimate peace of mind for your customers to enjoy water.\n\nNo matter the size or complexity, Pentair’s solutions offer a virtually hands-off, connected automation experience for consumers with pools of nearly any shape or size. The IntelliCenter Pool Control System is designed to easily accommodate new equipment add-ons as your customers’ backyard oasis grows – whether that’s adding colored lights, a water feature or more.\n\nAnd with the IntelliCenter system, pool owners are now able to control water features, monitor water chemistry, spot clean their spa and more – all from the comfort of their home using the Pentair Home App. Homeowners currently using the Intellicenter2 app are also being migrated to the Pentair Home App starting this fall.\n\nUsing the app, pool owners can access an easy-to-use dashboard on their smart device and receive alerts sent directly to their phones – offering peace of mind, anytime, from anywhere, so they can get back to enjoying their pool."
