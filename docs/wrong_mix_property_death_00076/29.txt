Biography

Harold Lloyd Sr. is Notable.

"Harold Lloyd was an American actor, comedian, director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is best known for his silent comedy films.

Lloyd ranks alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as one of the most popular and influential film comedians of the silent film era. Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and 'talkies,' between 1914 and 1947.

He is best known for his bespectacled 'Glasses' character, resourceful, success-seeking go-getter who was perfectly in tune with 1920s-era United States" (wikipedia excerpt).
