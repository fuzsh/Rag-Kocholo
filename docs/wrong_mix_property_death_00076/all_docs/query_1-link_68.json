        "text": "Hal Roach (born January 14, 1892, Elmira, New York, U.S.—died November 2, 1992, Bel Air, California) was an American motion-picture producer, director, and writer best known for his production of comedies of the 1920s and ’30s featuring Harold Lloyd, Will Rogers, Snub Pollard, and Charley Chase, and for the enduringly popular films of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and those of the youngsters of the Our Gang (The Little Rascals) comedy series. He ranks with Mack Sennett as a creator of inspired chaos in the early Hollywood comic style.\n\nAfter a number of miscellaneous jobs, including gold prospector and mule skinner, Roach began his film career in 1912 as a bit player in westerns. In 1914 he formed a company to produce the comedies of Harold Lloyd, achieving his first success with Just Nuts (1915). Five years later he established the Hal Roach Studios at Culver City, California. From that studio, he went on to produce other Lloyd films, including his famous Safety Last! (1923). In all Roach produced some 2,000 comedy shorts and a large number of full-length features during the 1920s, including the Will Rogers series (beginning in 1923) that often satirized the moviemaking industry; the Our Gang comedies; the two-reel ethnic comedies of Max Davidson; the Dippity-Doo-Dads, featuring an all-animal cast; and adventures featuring Rex the Wonder Horse. Roach’s insistence on carefully constructed scripts with solid story lines and well-worked characterizations resulted in a humour based on character and situation rather than on a string of sight gags; because of this emphasis, his comedies have withstood the test of time better than the rather one-dimensional slapstick efforts of Sennett. The most successful Roach comedies were those starring the team of Laurel and Hardy, whose classic films for Roach include Liberty (1928), Big Business (1929), Helpmates (1931), Sons of the Desert (1933), and Way Out West (1937).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nSeveral Hollywood luminaries, including directors Leo McCarey, George Marshall, and George Stevens, and actors Jean Harlow, Boris Karloff, and Paulette Goddard, worked for Roach early in their careers. Roach maintained a loose, friendly atmosphere at his studio and afforded his artisans the time and money required to make the best films possible. He would occasionally allow a picture to go over budget if he thought it would make for a better film, even at the expense of a lower profit. The “Lot of Fun,” as it was known to those who worked there, therefore became a place where comedy flourished. Roach’s efforts were rewarded with two Academy Awards for best short subject, the first for Laurel and Hardy’s The Music Box (1932) and the second for the Our Gang entry Bored of Education (1936).\n\nRoach gradually phased out the production of comedy shorts throughout the 1930s; by 1940 all of his top comedy acts were working for other studios. He produced a few feature films of note, including Topper (1937), Of Mice and Men (1939), Captain Fury (1939), and One Million B.C. (1940). After World War II, Roach had difficulty reestablishing himself in Hollywood until the advent of television in the late 1940s. He leased his studio facilities for various television productions and produced a few popular shows of his own, such as My Little Margie (1952–55). It was also about this time that Roach turned the operation of the studio over to his son, Hal Roach, Jr., whose ill-advised business dealings caused the studio to go bankrupt by 1959."
