        "text": "Of late, while writing a new book, Another City, Not My Own, which is subtitled A Novel in the Form of a Memoir, I have been in a somewhat reminiscent frame of mind, thinking back to earlier times. The city of the book’s title is Los Angeles, where, in a previous career and what seems like a different lifetime, I lived for a great many years. My wife and I raised our children there. I was a member of what is referred to as the Industry, meaning the film-and-television business. My source material for the reawakening of memory consists of 15 leather-bound scrapbooks which I kept with meticulous care for six or seven years, until the circumstances of my life began to change and I ceased to record it. Looking back now, I often say to myself, “I can’t believe I ever lived like that.”\n\nMy wife, whose name was Ellen but who was called Lenny, and I, along with our two sons, moved to Los Angeles from New York in 1957. It was a heady experience to arrive there as newcomers and be “taken up” in the social life of the film community the way we were. For two years we rented Harold Lloyd’s beach house in Santa Monica. Down the beach on one side, past Darryl Zanuck’s house, lived Peter and Patricia Kennedy Lawford, who had just bought the Louis B. Mayer house, which had its own projection room. On the other side, to the north of us, Mae West lived in a Neutra-designed house, which was next to the massive Colonial-style beach house that William Randolph Hearst had built for Marion Davies, which was then in the process of being converted into a private club.\n\nPeter Lawford is not remembered well today, but in the years of our friendship, before the deluge that engulfed him—which happened in the lives of so many of the people in this story, myself included—he was a charming and funny fellow, the center of a group of friends who rode waves, played volleyball, and gambled at poker. He and Pat, whose brother was about to be the president of the United States, were still very much in love. They ran a house where the atmosphere was relaxed and the dress was casual. Judy Garland used to come to dinner, as did Marilyn Monroe. When President Kennedy helicoptered in for Sunday lunch on a couple of occasions, you knew that where you were was the best place to be at that moment in time.\n\nWhen our daughter was born, we left the beach and moved into Beverly Hills, where we bought a house on Walden Drive which we both loved from the minute we stepped in the front door. For whatever reasons, it became one of those houses that people liked to come to, and come they did. It was always full of people. English lords, on their grand tour of America, stayed with us. We seemed to be forever giving dinners and lunches for someone or other who was passing through town. We lived extravagantly—far too well for a couple our age. We spent much too much money. We took it for granted, or at least I did. Lenny was inclined to hold back. I was of the more-more-more school.\n\nDuring part of that time, I was under contract to Twentieth Century Fox, as a producer in its new television department, and Darryl Zanuck was the head of the studio. Even though this was the swan-song period of the studio system, the Twentieth lot was still run like old times. My bungalow was next to the producer Jerry Wald’s. Marilyn Monroe, before her deluge, was the queen of the lot, beloved by all except the front office. One night at a party at Romanoff’s, which was the swellest restaurant in town, Marilyn arrived late—having just been sewn into the tightest green sequined dress imaginable by the wardrobe department at Fox—and taught some of the Hollywood society ladies, such as Mrs. Billy Wilder and Mrs. Fred de Cordova, how to walk her famous walk, roaring with laughter as she led them in a line. How carefree it all seemed.\n\nThe founder of MCA, Jules Stein, and his wife, Doris, the William Goetzes, the Gary Coopers, and Merle Oberon were the big hosts in filmland society. The Steins, who mixed European titles and Hollywood stars, lived in a spectacular house at the top of Angelo Drive, where the Rupert Murdochs now live, and always had their butler, Charles, stand next to the guest book in the front hall to make sure everyone signed. At Merle Oberon’s house, on Ladera Drive, you were likely to have lunch in the garden with Barbara Hutton, the much-married Woolworth heiress, or dinner in the candlelit dining room with Prince Philip, the consort of Queen Elizabeth. Mrs. Goetz, Edie by name, was always referred to as Hollywood royalty, which she was. She was the daughter of Louis B. Mayer, the co-founder of MGM; the wife of William Goetz, who had been one of the founders of Twentieth Century Fox; and the onetime sister-in-law of the great film producer David Selznick, who divorced her sister, Irene, to marry Jennifer Jones. The Goetzes, who had the best art collection in town, entertained moguls and titans. They had a printed menu at each place at dinner and always showed the latest movie after dinner, when the Picassos were raised to reveal the projection-room windows and a CinemaScope screen was lowered from the ceiling. Rocky Cooper, the elegant wife of Gary, mixed Southampton society people such as Henry and Anne Ford with movie stars such as Audrey Hepburn and Rock Hudson. It was a very glamorous time.\n\nEven Sunday church was not like it is other places. The 9:45 Mass at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, which was nicknamed Our Lady of the Cadillacs because of the sheer swank of its parishioners, was the one to attend. Rosalind Russell and her producer husband, Freddie Brisson, would arrive in their black Rolls-Royce. The Coopers, with their beautiful daughter, Maria, who was the godmother of our daughter, arrived in their gray Bentley. The hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, who was married to Zsa Zsa Gabor, always dropped a hundred-dollar bill in the collection basket. The parishioners would stare when Loretta Young and Jane Wyman, who were always dressed to the nines, went to Communion. Jayne Mansfield and her husband, Mickey Hargitay, came to that Mass with their children. Afterward, everyone stood outside on Bedford Drive and chatted. I remember Clark Gable coming on occasion with his fifth wife, Kay Aldrich Spreckels, who was a regular, and they would drive off in a dark-brown Mercedes convertible with the top down. Everyone wore dark glasses, even in church.\n\nReporters and photographers were rarely seen in such exalted circles, except at events organized for charity, although hostesses would have Hedda Hopper or Louella Parsons, and later Joyce Haber, the reigning gossipists, to dinner once or twice a year in order to stay on their good side. At that time, long before I began to write, I was a rather good photographer, so people would ask me to bring my camera to their parties, and I did. Natalie Wood and Mia Farrow once gave a party in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel and told Lenny to tell me to take photos. I photographed Warren Beatty, at the height of his bachelor powers, playing the piano at one of the then Mrs. Vincente Minnelli’s parties. I have pictures of Jane Fonda dancing to the music of the Byrds at a tent party she gave on the beach at Malibu shortly before she married Roger Vadim. I began to keep scrapbooks of my photographs, along with invitations, letters, telegrams, and newspaper accounts about Lenny and me and the people we knew. I even saved a typed copy of the eulogy that CBS founder William Paley read at David Selznick’s funeral. Now, when I look through those scrapbooks, I sense a certain desperation in me at that time, a need to document the life we led with great exactitude, as if I knew it wasn’t going to last.\n\nThe high point for us was our black-and-white ball, which we gave to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. When Cecil Beaton was doing the sets and costumes for My Fair Lady, he sometimes came to dinner, and the black-and-white motif for our party was taken from the Ascot scene he designed for the picture. The party was months in the planning, like a feature production. No expense was spared. The invitations, which requested that ladies wear black or white, were engraved by Smythson’s of New Bond Street in London. Tent parties, in which the pool gets covered to create a dance floor, are regular Saturday-night events in Beverly Hills. We went far, far beyond that. We totally redid our house. Our furniture was put in storage. Our children were placed in a hotel with a nanny. Our house was transformed, both inside and out, into a total fantasy by Jack McCullagh, a muralist and stage designer, who became a family friend. He painted backdrops and placed them outside the windows, which gave a feeling of being backstage in a theater. Our living room became a winter garden with trellised walls, lit theatrically so that people passed in and out of spotlights as they greeted one another. The effect was quite amazing. However foolish an extravaganza it may have been—Lenny’s mother was furious, mine was bewildered—anyone who was there will verify that it certainly was beautiful.\n\nFor the women, it was a night for new ball gowns and elaborate coiffures, and everyone rose to the occasion. There were even a couple of tiaras. Lenny, who was beautiful, was more beautiful that night. About 250 people came. Some flew in from other places to be there. The couturier Jimmy Galanos came and watched his dresses whirling by on the dance floor. Vogue sent the photographer Bob Willoughby to cover the party. For some reason, he did not take any pictures of the pre-political Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who were among the guests, but he did of Alfred and Betsy Bloomingdale. There were hydrangeas everywhere, two bands, and a late supper. The music stopped at four. We had sent flowers to all the neighbors so that they wouldn’t complain to the police about the noise.\n\nWe mixed ages. We mixed groups. People saw people they hadn’t seen for years. Annabella, who was Tyrone Power’s first wife, ran to greet David Niven, who turned to greet Angie Dickinson, who turned to greet Tony Curtis. The Lawfords, who had separated, came together. Natalie Wood was the prettiest woman at the party. We stipulated No Houseguests in order to keep the number of people within fire-law limits, but Truman Capote, who was staying with David Selznick and Jennifer Jones, insisted that he bring his, and for Truman you made an exception. Already famous, he was about to peak. In Cold Blood, which the press had been anticipating for several years, would soon be serialized in The New Yorker, following the execution by hanging of Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, who had murdered the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas. The guests whom Truman insisted on bringing were Alvin Dewey and his wife. Dewey was the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent who had solved the murder case that transfixed Truman for so long. In a tentful of famous people, Dewey became the most besieged. Everyone wanted to talk to him. Truman, who was a great dancer, was never off the floor. He twirled Natalie Wood, dipped Tuesday Weld, cha-cha’d Hope Lange, and even got the reluctant Jennifer Jones to the dance floor. Two years later, Truman gave his famous Black and White Ball at the Plaza in New York. He didn’t invite us.\n\nLife, of course, never stays carefree. Woes, tribulations, terrible things happen to all of us, and we were no exception. Lenny and I divorced about six years after the ball, but the circumstances of our subsequent lives were such that we never became unmarried. Neither of us ever again lived the way we had lived then. Things that were urgently important at that time became not important at all as life went on. Although Lenny never shared my enthusiasm for talking about old times, years later we would sometimes discuss the way we had lived then, always in utter amazement. In the final years of her terrible illness, she didn’t speak much. Conversation was usually one-sided. One day last year, sitting by the side of her bed, in a house that she had built in Arizona on land that had once been part of her father’s cattle ranch, I said to her, “Lenny, I was looking at the scrapbook of our black-and-white ball the other day in the country.”\n\nShe didn’t reply.\n\nI persisted. “Can you believe we ever gave that black-and-white ball? We must have been out of our minds.”\n\nFor a while she didn’t answer. She appeared to be thinking about it, but I didn’t actually expect a response. Then I saw the beginning of a smile at the corners of her lips.\n\nI went on. “Do you remember? We emptied the house and had all the furniture put in storage!”\n\nShe started to laugh as she began to remember, and then she said, “Don’t forget, we put the kids and the nanny in a hotel.”\n\nWe both roared. It was the biggest laugh we had had together since our divorce. “But it sure was pretty,” I said."
