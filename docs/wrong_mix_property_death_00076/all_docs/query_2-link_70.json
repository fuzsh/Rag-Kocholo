        "text": "Please see Part 2 of this series, which features multiple acting couples.\n\nThis post was updated on Feb. 15, 2017, to note that Jeffrey Hayden, Shirley Temple Black and Joan Leslie had passed away since this post was published in 2013.\n\nLast Valentine’s Day I reviewed the many unsuccessful relationships of actress Lana Turner. This Valentine’s Day, I wanted to look at some of the successful Hollywood relationships. As I started making my list of couples I was dumbfounded to find I had a list of over 60 long Hollywood marriages! Though this isn’t everyone and some of the marriages have a sprinkling of infidelity, here are a surprising amount of lengthy Hollywood couples of the Golden era.\n\nWith each marriage I tried to add some back stories or quotes. Some of the relationships have little information, due to the fact that I couldn’t find anything online.\n\nCelebrity couples:\n\nCharles Buddy Rogers and Mary Pickford: (Married June 1937 to her death in May 1979) Adopted two children, Ronnie Charles (1937) and Roxanne (1944-2007). Mary Pickford and Roxanne were estranged when the daughter eloped with a man her parents didn’t approve of. “Wings” (1927) star Rogers said actor Clark Gable said that the marriage wouldn’t last 6 months since Rogers was 11 years younger than Pickford, America’s Sweetheart of the silent era. However, their marriage lasted 42 years. Rogers and Pickford met in 1927 on the set of “My Best Girl” and hit it off. However, Pickford was married to Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and she was trying to hold their marriage together, which ended in divorce in 1936. After Pickford’s death, Rogers remarried. He passed away in 1999.\n\nHarold Lloyd and Mildred Davis: (Married Feb. 1923 to her death in Aug. 1969) Three children, Harold Jr, Gloria and Marjorie.

London, a jazz singer, and Troup, jazz piano player, were both in the music business. They met in 1955 at the Celebrity Room and he encouraged her career and produced her “Cry Me a River” record. The couple starred in the 1970s medical TV drama “Emergency!” from 1972 to 1979. London played Nurse Dixie McCall and Troup played Dr. Early. Troup said the series was ideal for raising their children.\n\nBob Hope and Dolores: (Married on Feb. 1934 to July 2003) Adopted four children: Eleanor, Anthony, Linda and Kelly. Though Dolores wasn’t famous like Bob, the couple could be compared to American figure heads like a president.
