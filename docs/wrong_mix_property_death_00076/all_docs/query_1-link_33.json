        "text": "This article originally appeared in the April 1992 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\nOnly a handful of Beverly Hills houses have ever rivaled the Warner estate. With its 13,600-square-foot Georgian-style mansion, expansive terraces and gardens, two guesthouses, nursery and three hothouses, tennis court, swimming pool, nine-hole golf course and motor court complete with its own service garage and gas pumps, the nine-acre property was— and still is—the archetypal studio mogul's estate.\n\nFew homes, moreover, compared with the Warner estate as a social milieu in the thirties and forties. “I remember one New Year's Eve party in 1939 or 1940,” Olivia de Havelland has recalled. “All the men were glorious in white tie. Errol Flynn was behind the bar, Howard Hughes was my date, and Jimmy Stewart was seated on a stool. Just the four of us having our first drink of the evening. All those beautiful women dressed in wonderful elegance. Dolores Del Rio in a white satin gown that contrasted her dark hair and dark eyes. Ann Warner, herself a striking presence. Those beautiful women, looking marvelous in this wonderful setting.”\n\nUnlike most of his famous neighbors, Warner did not build his estate in one grand gesture. Instead, he created his home step-by-step over an entire decade according to the changes in his business affairs and personal life.\n\nThis estate, like so many other studio moguls' houses, was the symbol of Warner's hard-won success. The sons of a Polish immigrant shopkeeper, Jack, Harry, Albert and Sam Warner entered the movie business when they purchased a nickelodeon in Newcastle, Pennsylvania, in 1904. Jack Warner entertained the audiences during intermissions. During the next two decades the Warners expanded into film distribution with varying degrees of success, and in 1923 they formed Warner Bros. In the early twenties Warner Bros, had been a distinctly second-rank studio, whose best-known star was Rin Tin Tin. At times, the studio was so hard-pressed that Warner left his office by the back door in order to avoid creditors. But by 1926 he felt comfortable enough to purchase three acres of former farmland in the gentle foothills a half-mile north of the Beverly Hills Hotel and to start construction of a house. Two years later, Warner and his family moved into a new fifteen-room Spanish colonial-style mansion.\n\nWithin several years, however, the home seemed inadequate to Warner. The studio's financial condition had improved considerably after its highly profitable introduction of the talkies with The Jazz Singer (1927). Warner Bros, subsequently enjoyed a string of financial and critical successes with gangster films like Little Caesar (1930) and Public Enemy (1931), the Busby Berkeley musicals and socialconscience movies like I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932). Warner had become so rich that he bought an adjacent parcel of land that had been subdivided into building lots, and installed a pitch-and-putt golf course with two ponds. He then acquired—and demolished—three nearby mansions and added those lots to his estate. (The three houses, it is estimated, would today have cost ten million dollars.)\n\nWarner completed the grounds of his spectacular estate in 1937, a year after his second marriage, to Ann Page, an occasional screen actress.\n\nThe existing Spanish-style mansion, which had been the height of architectural chic in the mid-twenties, looked outdated by the mid-thirties, and it reminded the brash studio head of his failed first marriage. Warner consequently enlisted architect Roland E. Coate, who enlarged and rebuilt the mansion in the Georgian style with an impressive Greek Revival portico. Coate was well known in the conservative San Marino and Pasadena social circles during the twenties, but after designing producer David O. Selznick's nearby house, he had begun in the thirties to work more and more in flamboyant Beverly Hills.\n\nIn keeping with the Warner mansion's elegantly restrained façade, matinee-idol-turned-designer-to-the-stars William Haines decorated the rooms in a Georgian style, frequently adding his own whimsical touches. Haines counted some of the thirties and forties Hollywood legends among his clients, including Joan Crawford and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Carole Lombard, Norma Shearer and director George Cukor. He also helped popularize the Neoclassical style in Los Angeles homes during the thirties.\n\nAt the Warner mansion, the front door opened into a two-story entrance hall, notable for its extraordinary parquetry floors with patterns executed in a variety of woods and a sweeping cantilevered staircase that led to the upstairs bedrooms.\n\nOn the first floor, the living room boasted eighteenth-century English paneling, corner niches for the display of Wedgwood china and other objects, and a George Ill-style cutglass chandelier. The room, like most of the others, displayed a number of fine antiques, including a George Ill-style mahogany library table and a George III writing desk.\n\nWith its parquetry floor, wall niches, Adamesque serving table and early-nineteenth-century French wallpaper with picturesque scenes of India, the dining room typified William Haines's pleasing style. The multipedestal dining usually sat sixteen at dinner parties, but it could be expanded to accommodate several dozen guests. The Warners owned a set of no less than forty-eight Regency-style dining chairs.\n\nThe library could seat several dozen as comfortably as a private screening room. The sunroom had handsome paneling in the Gothick style that was so popular in late-nineteenth-century England, and its furniture was a mixture of fine Chippendale pieces and large, comfortable sofas and chairs. A portrait of Ann Warner painted by Salvador Dalí and celebrated with a party for about three hundred people was set into the paneling over the fireplace mantel.\n\nAn invitation from the Warner estate replaced one from Pickfair as the most sought after in the thirties and forties movie community, but the reason was not Warner's warmth or goodwill. Although Warner was a brilliant businessman, he was widely feared for his ruthless practices in a rough-and-tumble Hollywood, and he was often mocked behind his back for his bad jokes. His invitations were rarely refused, however, because he headed one of Hollywood's most powerful studios, which had been awarded Best Picture Oscars for The Life of Emile Zola (1937) and Casablanca (1943), and whose stars included Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Al Jolson, James Cagney and Bette Davis, who was famous for fighting with her headstrong boss.\n\n1 / 6\n\nFor most people, a Sunday at the Warner estate meant a visit to the grounds but not to the house—except for the Hollywood elite or young actresses who visited the studio boss during his wife's frequent absences. Still, what splendid grounds landscape architect Florence Yoch created for the Warners, far grander than those of the estates of her other Hollywood clients, such as David O. Selznick and George Cukor.\n\nThe estate's gates opened onto a winding driveway, lined by sycamores, that proceeded up the hill and ended at the brick-paved motor court. On one side stood the mansion's porticoed entrance, its whiteness and Neoclassicism a handsome contrast to the heavily landscaped grounds. On the other side of the motor court, Yoch installed an elliptical fountain, followed by a series of landscaped terraces decorated with urns and statues, another fountain with statues of Cupid riding a sea horse and finally a seventeenth-century-Italian style colonnade in front of an ivy-covered wall.\n\nIn other parts of the estate, Yoch designed terraces with wide views of the city, garden-lined stairways from the house to the tennis court and swimming pool, water cascades and a fern grotto. The Warner estate, quite fittingly, was landscape architecture at its theatrical best.\n\nThe property was more than a verdant Shangri-la; it was a veritable country club. The swimming pool area had two enormous terraces— one with several lounge chairs, the other with an outdoor kitchen, barbecue and soda fountain. Warner enjoyed his lighted tennis court year round, and doubles matches were a feature of the Sunday parties. Golf was another favorite pastime. As it turned out, the Warners' next-door neighbor, silent-screen comedian Harold Lloyd, also had a nine-hole pitchand-putt course on his estate. Warner occasionally erected a temporary walkway over the wall between the two estates so that he and his guests could play all eighteen holes.\n\nFor most people, a Sunday at the Warner estate meant a visit to the grounds but not to the house—except for the Hollywood elite.\n\nAlthough the Warners hosted fewer and fewer afternoon parties in the fifties, they still welcomed old friends and such younger stars and entertainers as Elizabeth Taylor, Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Paul Newman, Doris Day and Merv Griffin.\n\nIn the fifties and early sixties Warner continued to rule the studio with an iron hand, and Warner Bros., which won the Best Picture Academy Award for My Fair Lady (1964), expanded profitably into television production. In 1967, at age seventy-five, Warner sold his interest in the studio, and over the next several years he gradually retired from the motion picture industry.\n\nAfter Jack Warner's death in 1978 at age eighty-six, Ann stayed at the estate, amid significant changes in the neighborhood. Many of the area's twenties and thirties mansions were modernized or torn down. Others, like Harold Lloyd's Greenacres, remained standing but lost most of their grounds. Only the Warner estate escaped these fates.\n\nWhen Ann Warner died in 1990, record mogul David Geffen purchased the property and the mansion's furnishings for an estimated $47.5 million. Jack and Ann Warner's home of five decades—the last intact estate from Hollywood's Golden Age in Beverly Hills—broke national records for the sale of a single-family residence.\n\nRelated: See More Celebrity Homes in AD"
