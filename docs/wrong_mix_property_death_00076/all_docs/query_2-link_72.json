        "text": "Harold L Gearhart, 73, of Three Oaks, died peacefully, Sunday, February 26, 2023, in the presence of his family.\n\nHis life began May 11, 1949 in LaPorte County, Indiana, the oldest of two boys born to Lloyd and Clora Gearhart. He married Betty Jane Johnson\n\nSeptember 16, 1973 in Three Oaks.\n\nHarold served honorably with the United State Army. He was a Military Police Sentry Dog Handler assigned to protect several potentially dangerous targets in the Vietnam War. He served with the 981st Sentry Dog Company from 1970 to 1971. Harold’s closest Army buddy, Maury Anderson, would always say he considered Harold the person who had your back by his fellow soldiers. He always came alive when he would reunite and reminisce with his Vietnam brothers. Harold was a homebody at heart but enjoyed hearing the stories Betty would share when she returned home from her many travels. He and Betty loved to work outside of their homes, especially in the garden. Harold enjoyed fixing just about anything and everything he could get his hands on, and shared that love by helping out his son by fixing things around his house too. Harold cherished his grandchildren. They loved sitting in his lap to watch television or just spend time together. If it wasn’t inside, they would sit in the swing in the backyard that he had made and had hung for them. He was funny, with a great sense of humor that made everyone laugh.\n\nHe was his daughter’s hero and she will always remember how her father made her feel safe. She will be forever grateful for the confidence he instilled in her by the way he spoke to and praised her. He was incredibly proud of the fact that his daughter was Miss Three Oaks 1998 and some of his last words were how proud he was.\n\nHis son will remember that his father was the strongest man he has ever known, both physically and mentally. He had a fighting will to survive and would never retreat, even though he knew the odds were against him. He was always positive and always moving forward. He was the best father that anyone could ever ask for. Jeff prays and hopes that he can live up to his father’s character someday.\n\nHarold will be greatly missed by family and friends. He is survived by\n\nspouse, Betty Gearhart of Three Oaks; daughter, Rachel (Andy) Miller of Orlando, Florida; sons, Jeff (Jessica) Gearhart of Stevensville, Dean Falcone of Crown Point, Indiana, John (Michelle) Falcone of South Carolina; twelve grandchildren, Timothy, Dillon, Liam, Gideon, Jackie, Caleb, Jackson, Bella, Gabriel, Tysen, Pax, Bear; brother, James Gearhart of Three Oaks; and a host of nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents.\n\nThe family will observe a private remembrance.\n\nThe family prefers contributions in memory of Harold be made toward his daughter’s missionary outreaches to New York City. Please send contributions to Youth with a Mission (fund MI072), Post Office Box 680647, Orlando, Florida 32868.\n\nFor I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. Creation is eagerly awaiting the return of its Creator. Romans 8:18\n\nArrangements have been entrusted to Wagner Family Funerals Pobocik Chapel, Three Oaks.
