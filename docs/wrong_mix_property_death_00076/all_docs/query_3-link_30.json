        "text": "Harold Lloyd Green, 96, of Florence, MS passed from this life into his Heavenly home on November 17, 2023, at the Mississippi State Veterans Home in Collins, MS. He was born May 24, 1927, in Ouachita Parish, LA to William Lloyd and Alma Payne Green. He moved to Mississippi with his family at an early age and attended Central High School in Jackson, MS where he met the love of his life, Helen Marie McDonald, who became his wife of 68 years.\n\nHarold enlisted in the US Marine Corps during World War II and later enlisted in the US Army after the war had ended. After military service, he enrolled in plumbing school in Kansas City, MO. During these years his family lived in Kansas City, MO; West Monroe, LA; Midland, TX; and San Bernardino, CA, where construction opportunities were more readily available at that time. In 1959, they moved to Florence, MS to be near family.\n\nHaroldâ€™s professional life included plumbing, pipefitting, and temperature controls. He was a member of the Plumbers and Pipefitters Union from 1955 to present. Upon retirement he was an avid woodworker and enjoyed crafting many beautiful items of cherry and walnut. He also enjoyed local and national trips on his motorcycles. Harold was a long-time member of FBC Florence, MS. He was also a long-time member of Evening Star Lodge No. 70 where he was a Past Master and was also a 32nd degree Scottish Right Mason.\n\nHarold was an industrious man and valued the importance of hard work. He modeled the characteristics of honesty, integrity, and industry as well as love of the Lord and family. He was a kind, compassionate, and generous person.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his father, William Loyd Green; his mother, Alma Payne Green Kopperl; his sister, Harriet Green Boyd; and his wife of 68 years, Helen Marie Green.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Laura Helen Ferguson (Marc) of Ocean Springs, MS; and Donald Lloyd Green (Janet) of Florence, MS. He was blessed with three grandchildren Jacquelyn Marie Ferguson of Ocean Springs, MS; John Lloyd Green of Florence, MS; and Susan Green Lewis (Nick) of Brandon, MS and three great grandchildren Eli, Noah, and Naomi. His life was further enriched by many nieces, nephews, and extended family.\n\nVisitation will be Tuesday, November 21, 2023, from 9:00 am until 11:00 am with service at 11:00 all at Chancellor Funeral Home in Florence. Interment will follow at Florence Cemetery.\n\nThe family requests that, in lieu of flowers, memorials be made to the Building Fund of First Baptist Church Florence, P.O. Box 97, Florence, MS 39073."
