        "text": "Ninety-five years ago this year, one of the world’s biggest movie stars came to Ontario.\n\nHarold Lloyd was here in 1924 to film scenes at the Southern Pacific Depot for “The Freshman,” in which he played naive college freshman Harold Lamb.\n\nA crew of 80 filmed at the station and on nearby streets in the downtown core. The visit “threw considerable stir into the affairs of Ontario,” the Daily Report wrote, as “plenty of Ontario spectators” gawked at the filming.\n\nIn “The Freshman,” Harold Lamb is a good-natured young man eager to become big man on campus. His notion of university life is based solely on a movie, “The College Hero,” from which he borrowed the hero’s nickname and introduction: “I’m just a regular fellow. Step right up and call me Speedy!” This is accompanied by a little jig, after which he sticks out his hand.\n\nLamb becomes the school joke but wins the day at the end. “The Freshman” is such a favorite of mine, in 2011 I screened it at the Ontario City Library.\n\nTwo years later, reader John Baugh, who had attended that screening, alerted me that according to the book “Silent Visions,” which pieces together where Lloyd filmed, most of the train arrival scenes were filmed in Ontario.\n\nThis was welcome news, if a little late for my purposes.\n\nI bought John Bengtson’s “Silent Visions” book. Its three pages about the filming in Ontario involved impressive detective work but also locations that largely don’t exist anymore. Not immediately able to figure out how to turn it into a column, I set it aside.\n\nRecently, though, I noticed that the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is screening “The Freshman” at 1 p.m. Tuesday on a double bill with another of Lloyd’s greats, 1928’s “Speedy.” (Admission to both: a mere $4, or $2 for seniors.) This provided the encouragement to try again.\n\nI bought “The Freshman” on Blu-ray to refresh my memory of the film and to watch Bengtson’s special feature on the locations.\n\nBengtson has become a wizard at identifying locations in silent films, producing books on Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Lloyd. He uses visual clues in the films — street signs, store names, homes or buildings in the background — and compares them to 1920s photos of Los Angeles.\n\n“Silent films, besides being entertaining, are also historical documents,” Bengtson told me by phone from the Bay Area. A film like “The Freshman,” he said, doubles as “an inadvertent documentary of what 1924 Southern California looked like.”\n\nIn the Blu-ray feature, as an arrow travels east on a 1920s map of Southern California from L.A., Bengtson says in his narration: “Los Angeles County was so large and so varied that Lloyd rarely traveled anywhere else to shoot. Yet in November 1924, Lloyd and his crew did something unusual.\n\n“They busted free from Hollywood and traveled to a remote location: Ontario, California, a small farming town in San Bernardino County.”\n\nThe local action starts at about 7:30 into the movie and, after an interior train sequence, ends at 14:30. Unpaved streets, trees, street lights and the train station are visible. It doesn’t scream “Ontario.”\n\nBengtson said he would not have been able to identify the location if not for a silent film fan named Paul Ayers, who is an expert on railroad history.\n\n“He’s the one who tipped me off that it was Ontario. He knew that just by looking at the train station,” Bengtson told me.\n\nThe Blu-ray credits thank Ayers, the Ontario City Library’s Robert E. Ellingwood Model Colony History Room and Jeffrey Castel De Oro, who visited the library on Bengtson’s behalf for historic photos.\n\nThe movie provides glimpses of the train station, the Chamber of Commerce building, the original City Hall and the cannon out front, all of them gone for decades. Amtrak does stop at a platform at 198 E. Emporia St., site of the former depot.\n\nThe Model Colony History Room dug up the Daily Report coverage of the filming for me. Lloyd appears to have been here Nov. 12-14, 1924.\n\nThe most substantial story, headlined “Harold Lloyd in city making film,” said the “king of movie comedians” was in town with his crew. Lloyd gave an interview to the Report from his Cadillac sedan. He said Southern Pacific had granted permission and the use of four train cars and a locomotive.\n\nOntario’s California Theater brought back Lloyd’s “Hot Water” to play two nights “by special request” while Lloyd was in town.\n\nAfter Lloyd’s departure, the Report ran a short item that began: “Now Ontario can get back to work.”\n\nIn assembling his film, Lloyd decided he needed a reaction shot of the dean looking outraged after being clapped on the back at the train station by Lloyd’s character. Rather than return to Ontario, those few seconds were shot in Culver City with its train station behind the dean, another Ayers discovery.\n\nNeither Chaplin nor Keaton ever filmed any silent scenes in our area, Bengtson told me to my great disappointment, and Lloyd only did so this one time.\n\nWhy Lloyd took the trouble to travel 40 miles from his studio isn’t known. Bengtson said Ontario’s train station struck him as generic.\n\nThere could be a reason not visible on the screen. Lloyd tended to overshoot and then cut scenes after previews to gauge audience reaction. There’s a production still of Lloyd under a car with a wrench as love interest Jobyna Ralston watches shyly. The Ontario train station is behind them.\n\nThat scene didn’t make the movie. But maybe that setting, or even another lost scene, made Ontario appealing as a location. I wish I could time travel to Lloyd’s Cadillac sedan, elbow aside the Report reporter and ask Lloyd myself.\n\nL.A. locations in “The Freshman” include Exposition Park and USC. The climactic football game was shot at two places: Pasadena’s Rose Bowl, with extras filling seats behind Lloyd on the bench, and at Berkeley’s California Memorial Stadium during a big game, with scenes on the field filmed hurriedly during halftime.\n\n“The Freshman” premiered Aug. 27, 1925 at the Million Dollar Theater and proved Lloyd’s most popular film.\n\nLloyd isn’t as well-remembered as he should be. On the other hand, I was eating lunch at Philippe the Original earlier this month when oldsters at the next table were saying that one of them lived in a house seen in a vintage movie. “That silent film actor who was missing a finger and thumb,” one said.\n\n“Harold Lloyd! I love his movies,” another chimed in. “‘Safety Last!’ is the best. When he hangs from that clock.”\n\n“He just goes from one predicament to the next,” a third said appreciatively.\n\nIt was heartening to hear people talking about Harold Lloyd in 2019. But where better than in a 1908 restaurant?\n\nDavid Allen writes three times per week, and when better than Sunday, Wednesday and Friday?
