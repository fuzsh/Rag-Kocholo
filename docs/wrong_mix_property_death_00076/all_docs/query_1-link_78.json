To close out Whale Week we've mapped 27 properties belonging to 19 of Los Angeles's biggest whales--the people who are always buying and selling, those who are buying and selling the most interesting or expensive houses, and those who are just plain filthy rich and thus worthy of our keen and devoted interest. Enjoy and try not to get splashed.\n\nRead More\n\nEater maps are curated by editors and aim to reflect a diversity of neighborhoods, cuisines, and prices.
