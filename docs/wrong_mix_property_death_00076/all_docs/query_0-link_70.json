        "text": "The scene of many spectacular events during the early history of Beverly Hills, The Lodge has been a backdrop for creating lifetime memories since it was first built over 110 years ago.\n\nThis historic hunting lodge was originally part of a unique parcel of land bought in 1866 by Edson A. Benedict, a storekeeper and native of Boonville, Missouri. With help from his wife and sons, Benedict built an apiary that was so bountiful that in one year, they were reported to have made a single shipment of 45,000 pounds of honey from the Santa Monica Pier.\n\nIn the early 1900s the Lodge and a big portion of the land surrounding it were bought by the Anderson family. The Andersons created, developed and operated the world famous Beverly Hills Hotel and were looking for a nearby site to build their residence.\n\nFor many years the Anderson’s allowed the Beverly Hills Hotel to use the lodge as a secret hideaway for its most treasured guests. VIP’s were brought by horseback from the hotel through the lush canyon pathways up to The Lodge, where they would be greeted by white gloved staffers who served them sumptuous meals on the great lawn underneath a canopy of live oak and sycamore trees.\n\nOnce part of a larger property that included “Falcon’s Lair”, home of the world’s biggest silent film star, Rudolph Valentino, The Lodge boasts a large roster of Hollywood A List neighbors. “Pickfair” the home of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford is just blocks away, as is “Green Acres” the former home of Harold Lloyd and current residence of mogul Ron Burkle. Neighbors include Raquel Welch, Halle Berry, Drew Barrymore, Sidney Poitier, Tom Cruise, David and Victoria Beckham, Rod Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, Hollywood “Super Agent” Michael Ovitz and Dreamworks founder, David Geffen. Madonna and George Clooney both had residences nearby.\n\nThe Lodge almost faced the wrecking ball in 2012, however, it was rescued and painstakingly restored to its former glory by its new owners. It's verdant, spacious grounds are still surrounded by towering 100 year-old Sycamore and Oak trees. The Lodge’s glorious gardens bloom all year-round, and are the perfect setting for any type of event. It's secluded setting on lower Benedict Canyon Road is just minutes from the heart of Beverly Hills and moments away from both the Beverly Hills Hotel and Bel Air Hotel and can accommodate intimate gatherings of ten or larger events of up to 400 guests."
