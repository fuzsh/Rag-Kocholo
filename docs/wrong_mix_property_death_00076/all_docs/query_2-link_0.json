        "text": "American actress\n\nFor the author, see Mildred B. Davis.\n\nMildred Hillary Davis[1] (February 22, 1901[citation needed][note 1][2] – August 18, 1969) was an American actress who appeared in fifteen of Harold Lloyd's classic silent comedies and eventually married him.\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nThe daughter of Howard Beckett Davis,[3] she was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and educated at the Friends School in Philadelphia. After spending several years studying, she traveled to Los Angeles in the hopes of securing a role in a film. After appearing in several small roles, she caught the attention of Hal Roach, who pointed her out to comedian Lloyd. Lloyd was looking for a leading lady to replace Bebe Daniels, and cast Davis in his comedy short From Hand to Mouth in 1919. It would be the first of fifteen films they would star in together.[citation needed]\n\nOn February 10, 1923, Davis married Lloyd. After marrying, Lloyd announced that Davis would not appear in any more motion pictures. After much persuasion by Davis (and much grief) she received Lloyd's consent for her return to the screen in Too Many Crooks, which Lloyd produced through his production company. It was the only acting role she undertook after becoming married.[citation needed]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 18, 1969, Davis died in St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California.[4]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role 1916 Marriage à la Carte 1917 What'll We Do with Uncle?
