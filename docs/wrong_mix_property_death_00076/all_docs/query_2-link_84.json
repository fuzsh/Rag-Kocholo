        "text": "Hi, I'm Steve Todd from Horry County, SC. Welcome to my family tree! This is where I'll be sharing some of my findings regarding my family history. A great place to start is the interactive tree. Use your mouse to drag the tree around, and click on individuals to learn more about them. You can also use the search box (upper right of every page) to find persons and places of interest to you. Hint: From an individual's page, the Charts menu items are relative to that individual.\n\nNote that I've focused (mostly) on my immediate ancestors (referred to as a pedigree tree). But I'm always glad to add \"cousins\", \"uncles\", \"aunts\", etc. Just let me know who you'd like to see added. It is very helpful if you can provide exact birth name, and dates and places of birth and death. Of course, if you find anything that is incorrect, please let me know and I'll fix it. Also, if you have pictures of anyone in this tree, I'd love to have a copy."
