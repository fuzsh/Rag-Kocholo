        "text": "Harold Lloyd is my favorite comedian from the silent era and is pleasing in Dr. Jack (1922). An enjoyable hour, the film is about a small town doctor who doesn’t use medicine much with his patients, instead finding kindness and happiness is all they need. Mildred Davis stars as his newest patient who is told she’ll never be well by her previous and domineering doctor, but Lloyd is determined to help her.\n\nAs many know, Davis soon became Lloyd’s wife in 1923, but she was a good actress in her own right despite her brief film career ending when she married. Although this isn’t one of Harold Lloyd’s “signature” films full of the daring escapades like Safety Last (1923), which he’d make next, there’s still great comedic moments showcasing the type of comedy and likable persona that he excelled at. Onto the art direction of the film, which I couldn’t find any credits to the designers, but we can still appreciate their work.\n\nCostumes\n\nHarold Lloyd played variations of the likable and optimistic persona, The Boy–which is what Lloyd himself referred to him as, or “The Glasses Character” as he’s known today. This time he’s a small town doctor who finds that most of his patients just need someone to listen and cheer them up. The sequences are really fun and thoughtful as he helps all ages and reveal his character’s cleverness. One of my favorites was the elderly man who says his bandaged foot can’t move, so Dr. Jack pulls out sheet music of The Darktown Strutters Ball from his doctor bag and as the man plays his saxophone, his bandaged foot taps to the music. This prompts the elderly man to play with more energy and Dr. Jack dances too.\n\nFor the character design we have the standard costume he wore of the three piece suit and straw porkpie hat. As Dr. Jack, this costume makes him believable as a young and upcoming doctor in a small town who wouldn’t be wearing expensive suits and cufflinks. This suit is also somewhat fitted, which was a trend in the early 1920s for menswear, so Lloyd’s character isn’t wearing old clothes either. The costume reveals too that Dr. Jack is an everyday man, just like how Harold Lloyd wanted his characters to be..someone who the audiences could still relate to. Here the character design adds credibility and trust by the others compared to the more exquisitely dressed and traditional doctor, Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg (Eric Mayne).\n\nAs The Sick Little Well Girl, there was more of a backstory to Davis’s character and scenes to demonstrate her comedic talent in a role with some substance for her to work with. I’ve always wondered what other types of roles she could have done because she had a lot of potential. Lillian Montanye of Motion Picture Classic Magazine in May 1922, the year this film was released, wrote of Mildred Davis: “She has the sense of humor that can see the funny side of everything–even tho [sic] it may directed against herself. […] Here is a rare talent, too–and we are glad that she developed it. Glad […] that she is making it her job to serve the common good by practising and promoting the gospel of laughter.”\n\nRegarding character design for the majority of the film, with the exception of the cafe scene where she’s in a hat and coat, Davis is seated and covered in blanket and shawl because she’s supposed to be resting. Since she’s “ill”, a pleated day dress with a beaded (possibly pearl) necklace would be comfortable for her to wear while expecting Dr. Jack to visit. Beaded necklaces were common in the era, but I think here they’re meant to imply that although her home is fancy, she’s not aloof and covered in jewels but has more of an understated elegance and eager personality. Davis’s hair isn’t bobbed by the way, it’s pinned up. Her makeup is purely film makeup with her eyebrows drawn a little darker and extended, eye liner and lipstick to bring out her features that also create a look of innocence for her character.\n\nSet Design\n\nHere’s the set of the bedroom of a neighborhood boy who is playing hooky. The furniture is sparse and there’s no large oil paintings on the wall, but instead are pinned drawings showing that it’s a young boy’s bedroom of the working, or what we’d call today, middle class. We can tell that the boy likes sports, being outside and since these are illustrations on his wall he may even like books or magazines with lots of pictures. Those who are familiar with Our Gang, will notice in the film that the sick boy is Mickey Daniels and later on his friend is played by another Our Gang member Jackie Condon. (Hal Roach, who produced Our Gang, was one of the writers of this film and was a producer of Lloyd’s films until 1924.) This set is my favorite because it’s minimalistic yet the set decor is carefully selected to give us a glimpse of what Sammy (Daniels) is like.\n\nThese are 2 rooms in The Sick Little Well Girl’s house that shows contrast with Dr. Jack’s usual surroundings and as a character of more modern thinking. On the left is the library with a classical style to the architecture and furniture. Notice the drapes and the vast view outside, since her home is an estate. This is actually a painted backdrop like they’d use for the stage, and at one point I saw it sway. The books themselves is another indication, since back in the day having a home library was only for those who could afford to purchase and collect–especially antique–books. The desk in the foreground, wall paneling and oil painting give the home a very stately feel.\n\nOn the right is the top of the staircase that almost every character seems to comically leap over the railing of at some point during the break in sequence. If you look closely you can see a sculpture in the corner on the left, what appears to be wall pilasters around the arched windows and a chandelier which continue with the elegance of the house. Rugs covering the entire floor give our characters something soft to fall on too.\n\nI first saw Harold Lloyd’s films as a teenager on TV and loved his comedy immediately. Now that I’ve had The Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection in my film library, I really like revisiting them. Especially his films, such as in the case of this one, that aren’t talked about or seen as much as his well known films. I recommend this because it’s enjoyable with a feel good story. There’s silly moments, which I don’t know always translates well to audiences today who find this just over the top. Apparently Lloyd’s character of unconventional practices in the film pleased holistic doctors of the era. That’s kind of interesting and shows how audiences interpret different things from the same film!\n\nIn my opinion, the film’s sentiment and approach is timeless to the thought that a lot of our troubles or ailments can be eased, or maybe even cured, by finding something to make us happy and a change of mind. The San Francisco Silent Film Festival featured an article about the film and included a quote Harold Lloyd said in 1928 of, “I feel that to be a comic is as vital and important a mission as being a physician, healing other wounds.”\n\nWhat Harold Lloyd films do you like, and which one is your favorite?"
