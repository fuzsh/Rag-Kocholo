        "meta_description": "The group is pictured sitting in the audience for the opera Die Walküre at the Shrine Auditorium, located at 665 West Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles. They are dressed in formal attire. Photograph dated November 7, 1939.  Harold Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893 in Burchard Nebraska. He was an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is best known for his silent comedy films. He was also a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was one of the most popular actors of the silent film era along with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Lloyd's performance hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street in Safety Last! (1923) is one of the most iconic images in all of cinema. Lloyd began acting at the age of 20 and became friends with filmmaker Hal Roach. In 1919 he was seriously injured while holding what he thought was a prop bomb. It exploded, causing him to lose the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. By 1921 Lloyd and Roach moved from short films to feature length comedies. The films were popular and highly profitable, making him one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood. Lloyd married actress Mildred Davis on Saturday, February 10, 1923 in Los Angeles. The couple had three children (one adopted). After the silent film era, his popularity waned and he basically retired from film. In 1944 he became director and host of a radio anthology series that lasted only one season. He became involved in civic and charity work and experimented with photography. He died on March 8, 1971.  Mildred Hillary Davis was born on February 22, 1901 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was an American actress who appeared in many of Harold Lloyd's classic silent comedies and eventually became his wife. She was very active in the Beverly Hills social scene often hosting parties at their Beverly Hills mansion, Greenacres. She died on August 18, 1969.   Mildred Gloria Lloyd, the eldest Lloyd child, was born in 1924. She became a model and actress and died in 2012.   Marjorie Elizabeth \"Peggy\" Lloyd was born in 1925 and was adopted by the Lloyds in 1930. She was also a model and actress. She died in 1986.",
