You can lease your INFINITI of choice for $0 down which only increases your monthly payments by $27. When the lease ends, you can return your INFINITI with just a phone call to 866-621-9123 for an inspection of the model. Make any necessary repairs after the inspection and set up an appointment to return the vehicle at the end of the lease.\n\nThe next step to end the lease is to complete a statement which provides information for the lease termination and federal odometer reading. You will pay any fees and charges. With the online account manager, you will get personal help along the way. If you choose to lease another INFINITI or buy a vehicle when your lease ends, you may quality for up to $895 in loyalty offers.\n\nLease vs. Purchase\n\nWhen you’re looking at a vehicle, you have two choices on how to make it your new set of wheels. You can either buy it or lease it. Both are viable options, but they are quite different ways of allowing you to have a vehicle to drive.\n\nLeasing is basically renting the vehicle. You make a monthly payment that gives you the privilege to drive it for a certain period of time. You usually pay less money down than if you were buying, or you may be able to lease with no money down. You sign a contract to lease for a set time, often between two and four years. Once the lease is up, you can either buy the vehicle, trade it in for another lease, or just return it. One of the big benefits is that your leased payments are usually cheaper than if you were financing it. You also don’t have to get a buyer when you want to upgrade. However, you may have limited mileage and you will need to maintain the vehicle in good condition or pay for the damage at the end of the lease.\n\nBuying an INFINITI means the vehicle is yours at the end of the loan. Your payments will probably be higher since you are paying for the entire price of the vehicle, not just the time you will be driving it. You can customize your vehicle with special accessories, which usually isn’t allowed with leases. You aren’t limited on mileage and don’t have to worry about wear and tear, except for how it may lessen the trade-in value of the vehicle.\n\nBoth leasing and buying lets you drive a fabulous INFINITI home, but they are unique options. You have several factors to consider, such as how much you drive each year, how much you want to spend, and your long-term goals. You can ask questions and find out more about these options at Glendale INFINITI.\n\nFinance with Glendale INFINITI\n\nIf buying a vehicle is your goal, you can get approved for financing at Glendale INFINITI with the in-house finance team. We offer auto loans for brand-new INFINITI models, as well as financing for Certified Pre-Owned and used vehicles. It’s an easy process. All you need to do to get started is to fill out the finance application, which you can find online on our website.

We make the arrangements to bring it in for repairs for a stress-free experience in service.\n\nINFINITI Service Description\n\nRegular service is critical to keeping your INFINITI performing at its best. You can rely on the Glendale INFINITI service department to provide the full range of services based on the manufacturer’s recommendations to keep your vehicle in prime condition.\n\nOil Change Service\n\nGetting the oil changed regularly on your INFINITI is one of the most important things you can do to care for your vehicle. The oil provides a critical service to your engine by lubricating all the working components to reduce wear and tear and lessen friction, which can lead to damage. The oil filter helps keep dirt and grime from the engine, which can also cause damage.\n\nRegular oil changes are critical to your vehicle’s performance. When the oil is ready to be replaced, it stops being as effective. The engine must work harder to do its job because it lacks lubrication. The filter gets clogged up with dirt, which makes it harder for the oil to get through. Regular oil changes based on the manufacturer’s recommendations for your model will help your engine perform more efficiently and last longer. It will also help maintain the market value of your vehicle when you are ready to sell or trade it in.\n\nDuring a routine oil change, the service technician will take a look at your INFINITI with a multi-point inspection. They look at belts and hoses, tires and brakes, and other components to see if they will need to be replaced soon. This lets you know when repairs are needed before you get stranded. Use INFINITI Express Service if you don’t want to make an appointment. Just stop in, and the service department will get the oil changed, and you back on the road again quickly.\n\nTire Service\n\nYour tires work hard as you travel mile after mile in your INFINITI. They provide traction when you need it to keep you and your passengers safe. Regular service is necessary to ensure your tires do their job adequately. Tire rotation should be done regularly to ensure they wear evenly and have optimal contact with the road. The service team at Glendale INFINITI will let you know when your tires need to be rotated. It also saves you money because it helps the tires last longer. You won’t be as likely to have a flat tire with a regular tire rotation. The service team will also check the tread and air pressure and let you know if they find a leak or if it’s time to get those tires replaced with a brand-new set.\n\nAir Filter Service\n\nAnother component you may not think much about as long as it works correctly is the air filter. The air filter filters the air that gets into your engine to keep out dust and grime. It allows air to circulate through the engine to prevent overheating. When the filter gets clogged with dirt, air can’t get in as easily, which makes the engine work harder and overheat. A dirty air filter can reduce the gas mileage you get and decrease performance. The team at Glendale INFINITI can replace the air filter in just a few minutes.\n\nBattery Service\n\nSince the battery powers your INFINITI, it’s essential to keep it working and replace it when necessary. Otherwise, you could miss an appointment because your vehicle won’t start. The service technicians at Glendale INFINITI can test the battery to tell if it needs to be replaced or if it is still in prime condition. They will also check cables and connections to ensure the current is getting through.\n\nIt may be time to replace your battery if you have trouble getting the engine to start or if it gives clicking noises when you try to start the vehicle. The interior lights may dim, or you may have to jump-start your vehicle. Just drop by the service department at Glendale INFINITI and get your battery tested for free. With Express Service, you don’t even need an appointment.\n\nFluid Flushes\n\nYour vehicle uses several fluids to keep it running. These fluids help lubricate certain moving parts and keep them clean from dirt and road debris. In time, the fluid gets dirty and doesn’t do its job as well. Our service team will drain out the old fluid and replace it with clean fluid. We take care of transmission, power steering, and brake fluid flushes, along with your cooling system. Schedule a fluid flush according to your owner’s manual. If you’re not sure when you should have it flushed, contact Glendale INFINITI and our service team will be happy to guide you based on your model.\n\nBrake Inspection\n\nYour brakes are one of the most crucial components of your vehicle. They are responsible for stopping three or four thousand pounds of metal quickly. Over time, your brakes can wear down and become less effective. The service team at Glendale INFINITI will inspect your brakes and let you know when the brake pads need to be replaced. We’ll look at brake lines, the rotors, and other components of the brake system to ensure your brakes are still working to keep you safe. You’ll want to schedule regular service for your brakes according to your owner’s manual to prevent major problems that can end up causing an accident.\n\nParts\n\nIf you’re the kind of person who likes to work on your own vehicle, you can still rely on Glendale INFINITI for genuine OEM parts.
