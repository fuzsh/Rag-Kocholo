Memorials may be made to Mercer Foundation for Health or the Aledo United Methodist Church.\n\nMarge's services will be livestreamed on the Speer Funeral Home Facebook page.\n\nMargaret Dorothy was born on December 7, 1940, in Moline, Illinois to Edward J. & Sarah E. (Culley) Freebern. She was a 1958 graduate of United Township High School. Marge was a 1961 graduate of the Moline Public Hospital School of Nursing, where she began her Nursing Career. Marge retired from the Mercer County Hospital in 1998.\n\nMarge married Harold W. Lloyd on September 7, 1962, in Silvis, Illinois. From this union, 5 children were born. Harold preceded her in death on October 20, 2004.\n\nIn her spare time, Marge enjoyed sharing her artistic talents with drawing, painting and quilting. Family members were gifted her beautiful pencil sketches, Christmas stockings and quilts. Marge’s kids, family and neighbors grew up enjoying her fabulous cooking.\n\nMarge dedicated her life to healthcare. Nursing wasn’t her only gift, she also helped teach EMT classes and mentored other nurses and staff at the hospital. Marge spent most of her nursing career in the ER Department, but retired from home healthcare, which she found to be very fulfilling."
