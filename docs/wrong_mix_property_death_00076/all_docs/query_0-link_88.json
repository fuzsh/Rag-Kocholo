        "text": "Harold Lloyd (April 20, 1893 - March 8, 1971) was an American actor. Lloyd made nearly 500 comedy films, both silent and sound. Lloyd is best known for his extended chase sequences that included daredevil physical feats like climbing the sides of tall buildings, hanging precariously from clocks, flagpoles and ledges. Lloyd did his own stunts and worked without safety nets.\n\nLloyd, born in Burchard, Nebraska, started acting in one-reel film comedies in 1912 in San Diego, California. Lloyd soon began working with Thomas Edison's motion picture company, Universal, and eventually ended up with Hal Roach[?]. Lloyd was a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nLloyd married his leading lady, Mildred Davis[?], in February of 1923, with whom he had two children; Gloria, born in 1923, and Harold, born in 1931. They also adopted Peggy in 1930. Lloyd's home, \"GreenAcres\" has 44 rooms, 26 bathrooms, 12 fountains, 12 gardens and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Lloyd was involved with early color film experiments. Some of the earliest 2 color Technicolor tests were shot at his Beverly Hills home.\n\nLloyd's autobiography, An American Comedy, was published in 1928.\n\nBy the 1940s, Lloyd was no longer active in the film industry. In 1947, director Preston Sturges[?] brought him out of retirement for one more film, ' The Sin of Harold Diddlebock. The film was a failure.\n\nIn 1952 Lloyd produced two compilation films, featuring scenes from his old comedies, Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy and The Funny Side of Life (1953). The films ignited a renewed interest in Lloyd's work.\n\nIn 1952, Lloyd received a special Academy Award for being a \"master comedian.\""
