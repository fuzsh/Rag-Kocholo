        "text": "*In lieu of flowers, a memorial has been established in Harold's name.\n\nHarold Lloyd Piercy was born December 22, 1946, at the Sioux Rapids Hospital, now known as the Sioux Care Center. His parents were Lloyd Victor Piercy of Modale, IA and Cleta Corraine Haner Piercy Ehlers.\n\nHarold was raised in Spencer, Iowa in his younger years. He had a paper route and played many sports at the YMCA. He was a Little League baseball and a YMCA basketball champion in 8th grade. Later they moved to Sioux Rapids where he continued to be involved with sports. He was an honorable mention in All State basketball and baseball. He also ran track and played golf.\n\nIn 1966, Harold joined the US Army. He trained at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Following his training, he went to Fort Wainwright, Alaska. He served in the 12th Aviator unit for a year and a half. Then he was sent to Military District of Washington, Signal Company. While in Washington, he served perimeter patrol for the “Poor People’s March”, in Robert Kennedy’s funeral at Arlington cemetery. He also served in Richard Nixon’s inaugural parade on Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nIn 1968, he married Susan Plagman. To this union, he had 3 children. Michael, Michelle and Mellissa. Divorced in 1980. He married Georgia Marie Hamrick Tokle of Spencer on June 8th, 1984. She brought two daughters with her into the marriage, Jane and Amy.\n\nHarold loved sports. In 1999, he bowled in Reno, Nevada. He did lots of umpiring baseball/softball and refereeing basketball. He played fast/slow pitch softball, bowling, golf, basketball and even some darts. If he wasn’t participating, he was a spectator. He went to his grandkids and great nieces/nephews’ activities and games. Harold also enjoyed going to auctions with Georgia. They loved to go dancing. Harold and Georgia always had a project going on. Harold liked to keep busy.\n\nHarold played basketball right up until he was injured at work (Oct 2009). He was forced into an early retirement, with his injury. With practice, he was able to get back out on the golf course. If there was a football, volleyball, track meet, wrestling meet, baseball or softball game, play, band and choir concert happening, he was there to watch and cheer on the grandkids or great nephew and nieces.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and his brother Dale.\n\nLeft to cherish his memory is Georgia Piercy, his wife of 39 years. Stepdaughters: Jane Marie Tokle Morisch (Michael) of Spencer, IA. Amy Lynn Tokle Waldstein (Travis) of Council Bluffs, IA. His children, Michael (Shery) Piercy of Garden Grove IL, Michelle (Troy) Rubel of Badger, IA, and Mellissa (Bob) Starace of Wilmington, NC. His sister-in-laws, Karen Piercy of Spencer, Connie (Jim) Manwarren of Emmetsburg, Julie (Maynard) Tuttle of Spencer. Brother-in-law, Art (Mary) Hamrick of Spencer. 11 grandkids, many nieces and nephews.\n\nHis last words would be “Go Hawks.” “Go Tigers.”"
