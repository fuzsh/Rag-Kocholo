        "text": "If you look at a map of the city of Los Angeles, you'll spot Beverly Hills, an island in the middle of the civic ocean. How it got that way is a story with all the elements of a classic Hollywood movie: water rights, film stars and cutthroat politics.\n\nNancie Clare explores the details in her new book \"The Battle for Beverly Hills.\"\n\nSetting the scene\n\nIn the 1910s, Beverly Hills was a tiny, unassuming place while Los Angeles was booming after William Mulholland brought water to the city.\n\nThen came the movie business. As film studios moved out west, so did actors. Eventually, they settled in Beverly Hills. Clare says that back then, actors weren't in it for the fame because films were a young, risky industry.\n\nWater Woes\n\nBy 1923, Beverly Hills had a problem. It was running out of water. The proposed solution was to join the city of Los Angeles, which had plenty of water to spare, Clare said.\n\nA special election was called with a ballot measure to let Beverly Hills residents vote on whether or not they wanted to be annexed into Los Angeles.\n\nSome residents, including local influencer Silsby Spalding, were against the idea of annexation, Clare said.\n\nBut the threat of running out of water was enough to convince many residents to join L.A. How would the anti-annexation camp win over the voters? Enter the Beverly Hills Eight.\n\nStar Power\n\nThe Beverly Hills Eight were a group of film stars: Mary Pickford, her husband Douglas Fairbanks, Will Rogers, Harold Lloyd, Conrad Nagel, Fred Niblo, Tom Mix and Rudolph Valentino. They were big names and they used their celebrity to fight hard for the anti-annexation cause.\n\nClare said she thinks the Beverly Hills Eight were the force that tipped the scale against annexation. Pickford, in particular knew how to leverage the public's admiration for her into political power.\n\nThe Final Act\n\nWhen the annexation vote finally rolled around, the 'nays' had won out and Beverly Hills remained independent. Clare believes that moment set the stage for celebrity intervention in politics.\n\nTo solve their water troubles, Beverly Hills bought the Sherman Water Company in 1928 from a city that eventually became West Hollywood. In 1941, Beverly Hills started receiving supplies from the Metropolitan Water District.\n\nA monument to the Beverly Hills Eight, called \"Celluloid,\" stands in the middle of a traffic circle at the intersection of Olympic Boulevard and South Beverly Drive. The bronze and marble obelisk is a tribute to the political battle that kept Beverly Hills independent and a reminder of what star power can do."
