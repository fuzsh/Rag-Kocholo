        "meta_description": "Davis was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and educated at the \"Friends School\" there. After several years spent studying, she traveled to Los Angeles in the hopes of securing a role in a film. After appearing in several small roles, she caught the attention of Hal Roach, who pointed her out to comedian Harold Lloyd. Lloyd was looking for a leading lady to replace Bebe Daniels, and cast Davis in his comedy short From Hand to Mouth in 1919. It would be the first of fifteen films they would star in together.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, February 10, 1923, she married Harold Lloyd. After their marriage Lloyd announced that Davis would not appear in any more motion pictures. After much persuasion on Davis' part she received Lloyd's consent for her return to the screen in Too Many Crooks, which Lloyd produced through his production company.",
