        "meta_description": "Title supplied by cataloger.; Original photograph has several creases.Harold Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893 in Burchard, Nebraska. He was an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is best known for his silent comedy films. He was also a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was one of the most popular actors of the silent film era along with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Lloyd's performance hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street in Safety Last! (1923) is one of the most iconic images in all of cinema. Lloyd began acting at the age of 20 and became friends with filmmaker Hal Roach. In 1919 he was seriously injured while holding what he thought was a prop bomb. It exploded, causing him to lose the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. By 1921 Lloyd and Roach moved from short films to feature length comedies. The films were popular and highly profitable, making him one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood. Lloyd married actress Mildred Davis on Saturday, February 10, 1923 in Los Angeles. The couple had three children (one adopted). After the silent film era, his popularity waned and he basically retired from film. In 1944 he became director and host of a radio anthology series that lasted only one season. He became involved in civic and charity work and experimented with photography. He died on March 8, 1971.; Mildred Hillary Davis was born on February 22, 1901 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was an American actress who appeared in many of Harold Lloyd's classic silent comedies and eventually became his wife. She was very active in the Beverly Hills social scene often hosting parties at their Beverly Hills mansion, Greenacres. She died on August 18, 1969.Photograph caption dated May 29, 1962 reads \"Mrs. Harold Lloyd celebrated her birthday (Feb. 22) at the Beverly Hills Club with a gathering of the Lloyds of Beverly Hills for dinner. Mr. Lloyd is watching his wife make the first cut, and their little grand daughter, Suzanne Lloyd Guasti, is approving. Others at the affair were Dr. and Mrs. John Howard Davis (Dr. Davis is Mrs. Lloyd's brother), Mrs. Gloria Guasti (the Lloyd's daughter), Mrs. Edward Sears, Miss Cynthia Davis, Harold Lloyd Jr. and Roy Brooks.\" The cake is on a platter and there are candles on the cake.",
