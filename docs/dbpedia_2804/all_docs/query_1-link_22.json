        "text": "CINCINATTI â?? Residents of Ohio and throughout the nation are being warned about a phone scam, from the 513 (Cincinnati) area code, trying to obtain credit or debit card information, according to Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.\n\nThe calls are said to be phishing, in which the caller claims there is a problem with the consumersâ?? account to obtain personal information.\n\nAlthough the 513-area code shows up on the caller ID, it is more than likely a not coming from the Cincinnati area. The caller will â??hackâ?? the caller ID to make it appear to be from the Cincinnati area.\n\nThe Ohio Attorney Generalâ??s Office has received roughly 110 reports of these calls in the past week from consumers in Ohio and other states, including Georgia, Missouri, and South Dakota.\n\nAccording to consumer reports, the phone call begins with a recorded message, stating their account has been locked. To unlock the account, consumers are asked to â??press 1â?? and enter their 16-digit card number. You are said to be at risk if you supply this information.\n\nâ??Scammers often try to use fear to convince people to provide money or personal information,â?? Attorney General DeWine said. â??No matter what a caller says, donâ??t give out any financial information in response to these kinds of calls. If you are worried about your credit or debit account, hang up and call your bank using a number you know to be real, such as the number that appears on your monthly statement.â??\n\nHere are some important steps to remember to protect yourself if you receive a suspicious call:\n\nBe skeptical of the phone number that appears on your caller ID. It could be the result of â??spoofingâ?? or hacking.\n\nIf doubtful, hang up or donâ??t answer.\n\nDonâ??t respond to suspicious calls. If you are prompted to â??opt out,â?? donâ??t press the required button. This could cause you to receive more calls in the future.\n\nNever provide money or personal information to anybody who calls you unexpectedly, even if the call appears local.\n\nConsumers who have provided credit or debit card information to one of these callers should take the following steps to protect themselves:\n\nCall your bank to report that your card number has been compromised.\n\nMonitor your bank account. Look for suspicious activity. Immediately notify your bank or card provider if you find an error.\n\nPlace an initial fraud alert on your credit report by contacting one of the three major credit reporting agencies â?? Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion â?? this will stay on your credit report for 90 days. The alert is free of charge and will make it more difficult for someone to open credit in your name.\n\nVictims of identity theft should contact the Ohio Attorney Generalâ??s Identity Theft Unit for help correcting the issue.\n\nTo report a scam, consumers should contact the Ohio Attorney Generalâ??s Office at or 800-282-0515."
