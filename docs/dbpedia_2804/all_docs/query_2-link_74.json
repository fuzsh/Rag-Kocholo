Strictly speaking in geography, the Chinese name of this scenic area runs counter to the fact, however, its artistic conception, which comes from a loyal and steadfast love legend in the ancient times, brings huge fame to it. The story goes it that a couple deep in love was forced to broke up and run away from their home because of family feud. Chased after their families, they escaped to this place; however, their love was not still forgiven and they had no choice but jumped into the sea with the wish of staying in the sea together forever. Touched by their love, later generations decided to commemorate them by carving \"天涯 (Tian Ya)\" and \"海角 (Hai Jiao)\" on the two huge rocks the couple turned to be, signifying their love will never die even in the end of the world. Nowadays, the site has been seen as a sign of romance and become a must-visit for travelers especially couples.\n\nHistory of Tian Ya Hai Jiao\n\nMore than one thousand kilometers from the national political and economic center in ancient China, Hainan was a remote island few people trod at that time due to the inconvenient traffic. For a long term it was seen as a jail where rebellious officials were exiled.\n\nHistorical records show that the Chinese characters \"天涯\" carved on the 10-meter-high huge rock was the handwriting of Cheng Zhe, chief executive of the town in Qing Dynasty (1644-1911); on the lower part of the rock are three poems by Guo Moruo (1892-1978).\n\nAt the right side of the rock \"天涯\" is another sharp rock, on the top of which are the characters \"海角\" that is said to be written by some scholar of Qing Dynasty. At the right side of the rock is the cone rock \"南天一柱 (Nan Tian Yi Zhu, a pillar of the South)\".\n\nTian Ya Hai Jiao nowadays\n\nIn addition to the amazing seaside landscapes, Tian Ya Ha Jiao is also famous for the inscriptions on precipices, the folk custom garden of Li ethnic minority, the sculpture garden of historic celebrities, the Baliningxia Scenic Area, the Haitian Natural Scenic Area, the Tianya Road, etc. Travelers visiting the area can also enjoy a sunlight bath on the beach, have fun at sea by motorboat or put a close eye on the Tropical Ocean Zoo nearby."
