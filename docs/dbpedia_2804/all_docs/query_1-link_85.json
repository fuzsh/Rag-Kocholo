The city is high in the south and low in the north and slopes from southwest to the northeast. With low-lying plains at the coast and also along Nandu River, most of the land in the city is below 100 meters (328 feet). The surface is largely strewn with basic volcanic rocks, loose sediments, sea-accumulated terrace and volcanic landform.\n\nHistory: The history of Haikou can trace back to the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC - 24 AD). During its early history, Haikou served as a port for Qiongshan County, which belonged to Guangdong province. In 1926, it was established as an administrative city, since it overtook Qiongshan County in population. In 1988, it was upgraded to the status of a prefecture-level city as well as the capital of the newly-created Hainan Province (Hainan was established as a special administrative region in 1949).\n\nAttractions: As the capital city of Hainan province, Haikou attaches great importance to the development of tourism. Its long coastline includes a number of excellent bathing beaches like the Holiday Beach and seaside resorts like the Tropical Ocean World. Harbor Mangrove Natural Reserve Area in Dongzhai is one of the major tourist destinations in the city which has been regarded as the \"Forest Park over the Sea\". Known as the 'Kingdom of Coconuts', the Dongjiao Coconut Plantation located on the seaside of Dongjiao Town is also worth a visit. Wuzhi Mountain and Shimei Bay are also well known examples of the many attractions. There are also many sites of historic interest, such as Wugong Temples and Tomb of Hai Rui.\n\nTransportation: Since Haikou was selected as the capital city of Hainan province, transportation in this city has been greatly improved.

Rain comes in summer and between times there are typhoons and rainstorms. The best time to visit the city is between November and April.\n\nDining and Shopping\n\nHaikou Cuisine is similar to Canton Cuisine, but with distinct coconut flavor such as Ye Nai Ji (Chicken in Coconut Soup) and Yezi Yanwo Zhong (Streamed Coconut with Swiftest Nest). Whilst traveling in the city, the seafood in Qukou is an opportunity not to be missed. Aside from the famous Hainan dishes like Wenchang Ji (Wenchang Chicken) and Jiaji Ya (Jiaji Duck), and Shishan Yongyang (Shishan Mutton), visitors can also enjoy local specialties of the city, such as Bao Luo Fen (Baoluo Rice Noodle), Hainan Qingbuliang (Cool Herb Drink), Qing Xie Zhou (Crab Congee), and Tian Shu Nai (Sweet Potato Mousse). Chinese Cuisine Street in Jinlong Road, Longkun South Road and Bo'ai South Road are best places for dining.\n\nAs a business center of Hainan, Haikou collects all products from the whole island. Haixiu Avenue is the most famous where a vast array of beautiful pearls, crystals, hawksbill can be found. Stores dealing with local specialties are gathered there also: Xinglong coffee, pepper, coconut sugar, ox horn carvings, coconut shell sculpture, Li brocade, seashell, and cultural souvenirs of the Li Minority.
