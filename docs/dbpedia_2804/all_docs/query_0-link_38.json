        "text": "Haikou and Sanya have recently launched marriage registration appointment systems to prevent crowds as part of their COVID-19 prevention and control efforts.\n\nPeople in Haikou, capital of Hainan province, who need marriage registration services should make an appointment one day ahead of time starting from March 18 onwards, according to the Haikou municipal bureau of civil affairs.\n\nThe Sanya municipal bureau of civil affairs also requires that people who need marriage registration services must make an appointment at least one working day in advance starting from March 17.\n\nWhen coming for their appointment, people must wear masks, as well as show their health code and itinerary code. In order to prevent crowds at the registration site, the marriage registration departments will not allow relatives and friends to accompany people coming for an appointment.\n\nFor foreign-related marriage registration services, people in key overseas epidemic areas must provide a negative nucleic acid test certificate taken within 24 hours and have their temperature taken before entering. Those who are currently in quarantine will not be allowed to make an appointment and register.\n\nThe Haikou foreign-related marriage registration appointment hotline: 0898-66270809 or 0898-66268046.\n\nThe Sanya foreign-related marriage registration appointment hotline: 0898-38860138."
