        "text": "High-grade, straight-grained, quarter-sawn spruce is used for the soundboard's resonant qualities and high strength-to-mass ratio. The soundboard is solid and not laminated, which creates the best resonance and projection of sound. In 1936, Steinway patented the diaphragmatic soundboard, which was designed to be thicker in the middle and gently tapered to the edges. The Boston soundboard has tapered thickness from bass to treble. A thinner soundboard in the bass area vibrates more freely, resulting in a richer, fuller tone.\n\nBoston backposts are massive — providing a solid foundation for the resonating soundboard and tensioned vibrating strings, thus helping create a beautiful tone. Boston backpost locations are staggered — located where the string tension is greatest, instead of neatly equidistant. Massive staggered backposts help provide superb tone and maximum stability, ensuring the piano will last, tunings will be more stable, and piano tone will be enhanced for the years and decades to come.\n\nDimensions\n\nHeight: 120 cm (47 ⅜\")\n\nWidth: 151 cm (59 ¼\")\n\nDepth: 64 cm (25\")\n\nNet Weight: 254 kg (557 lb)\n\nEncasement\n\nCabinet Style\n\nSchool\n\nFinish\n\nEbony Polish and Walnut Satin\n\nHardware\n\nSolid brass – polished and lacquered.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nBackposts\n\nFive massive full-length laminated spruce posts. Total cross sectional area: 450 cm2 (69.8 in2). Thickness of post: 9 cm (3 ½”). Width of post: 10 cm (4”).\n\nBackframe\n\nThe massive backposts are tenoned into upper and lower mortise rails, creating a substantially strong frame. Backpost locations are staggered for proper support. Solid filler blocks and maple backboards make this back frame assembly even stronger. A grand-style hardwood closing rim is attached to this foundation, onto which the soundboard and ribs are glued. This structure provides unequaled strength and stability and improved acoustics.\n\nPinblock\n\nOctagrip™ pinblock made of 11 layers of hard rock maple – glued in different grain angles of 60 degrees – affording the tuning pins greater stability under tension and enabling the piano to stay in tune longer.\n\nSoundboard\n\nClose and straight-grain solid (not laminated) spruce. Minimum 3 annual growth rings per cm (minimum 8 per inch). Tapered from treble to bass, to provide a rich tone in the bass, and a brilliant and crisp tone in the treble, creating a well-balanced and lasting tonal response. Tapered from 9 mm to 7 mm. Vibrating area: 1.01 m2 (1,559 in2). Closing rim evens out the soundboard’s response to all frequencies, eliminating “hot” spots. Emulates shape of grand soundboard.\n\nRibs\n\nMade from durable spruce to assure strong and constant support of the strings bearing down on the soundboard. Ribs are fully let-in to the liner to support the important soundboard crown and prevent the piano from losing its tone. Number of ribs: 11\n\nBridges\n\nTreble: Vertically laminated hard rock maple with a solid maple cap, curved to fit the crown of the soundboard. Bass: Solid maple mounted to cantilevered base. Doweled, glued, and screwed to soundboard.\n\nScale\n\nOverstrung: Lower tension scale for longer sustaining tone, beautiful tonal clarity and depth, and longer life of the whole piano. 18,074 kg (39,762 lb) tension.\n\nPlate\n\nCast from grey iron, bronze-painted and lacquered.\n\nTuning Pins\n\nNickel-plated steel, cut threaded.\n\nStrings\n\nTreble: Highest grade steel (in half size increments). Number of sizes: 10. Lowest tenor note: 29. Bass: Steel core wire wound with solid copper. Number 1 speaking length: 110.0 cm (43.3\")\n\nHammers\n\nPremium German Würzen topfelt over premium wool underfelt, pressed over hornbeam moldings into Steinway & Sons designed shape, compression-wire reinforced; hammer-shanks from select resilient horn-beam; resulting in superior tone, increased durability and greater voicing ability.\n\nAction\n\nSolid maple (all wood, no plastic) for all moving parts. Extruded aluminum action rails for increased stability and less frequent regulation. Dependable direct-blow design.\n\nKeys\n\nSolid spruce, individually balanced and weighted. Phenolic sharps and acrylate white key covers. Length of key: 39.2 cm (15.4”)\n\nKeybed made of spruce and birch. Strong, rugged construction provides a solid mount for the keyframe and action allowing for precise and prolonged action regulation. Keybed thickness is 42mm.\n\nKeyframe\n\nSpruce with hardwood inserts in the balance rail and front rail for added stability.\n\nPedals\n\nSoft (half-blow), muffler, and sustain (damper) pedals.\n\nOther\n\nMusic desk: Professional solid music desk.\n\nCasters: Double-nylon casters.\n\nLocks: Fallboard and top locks.\n\nProp Sticks: Top prop sticks.\n\nBench: Matching wood-top bench."
