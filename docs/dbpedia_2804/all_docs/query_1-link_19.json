        "text": "Not all of them are by accident\n\nLong ago we started a small company, and for some reason we were joined by a character who I can only describe as shady.\n\nIf I recall correctly, there are two premium rates. The one that is used for contacting heavy breathing people has a rate that ought to make the caller pant just as much, but there's also one that is less blisteringly painful, I think it's 877 or something.\n\nThis guy used that slightly less painful rate number as his contact number on CVs and business cards because in those days it wasn't that clear it was more expensive (the advance warnings showed up years later). He didn't make much with it but he was a nickel-and-dimer anyway so every penny he made was gain in his eyes.\n\nAnyway, this relation ended soon. The guy was simply borderline criminal, and in the end he tried to stick his hands in the till. Unfortunately for him I had his number by that time, if you pardon the pun.\n\nback in the day\n\nMid/late 80's . I was working with a public body/nationalised industry, replacing their ageing strowger pabx's with digital boxes. On the Strowgers not many people had \"level 9\" access (for direct dialled outside lines) which created quite a workload as legitimate calls from everyone else had to go through our own operator(s) to be dialled and connected manually.\n\nThe bills for the outside lines were all itemised (by BT and Mercury) , but on the strowgers there was no way of attributing those to individual extensions. It was also very difficult (aka neigh on impossible) to block any particular outside number from those who did have legitimate level 9 access. Some of the numbers called and costs were quite eye opening as the fledgling premium rate service industry was going through quite an exponential growth. I think the most popular numbers of all were horse racing and bookie numbers run by some of the national newspapers..... I seem to recall the single most expensive call we logged was around £120, which was about an annual bills worth for most people back then.\n\nSo, on the new digital pbx's we were running call logging software on all extensions, and gave level-9 to a whole load of new extensions, letting them know that calls were being logged. (which saved a lot of operator workload and thus quicker response) We of course put blocks on all the dodgy 0898 and similar numbers, but we could now see who was attempting to call them. The folks who now had level 9 access for the first time were generally very responsible, but some of the existing level-9 holders.... Well, It was rather eye opening as we could bypass the block and hear what some individual senior managers had been calling during working hours. Oh dear - you would probably not want to share the lavatory with them afterwards.\n\nOf course, installing the new PBX's was a weekend job, and normally a Saturday night one as the organisation was effectively 24/7, which meant we had to test all the various levels of blocks to make sure they all worked from all classes of extension, which occasionally required entering the wood panelled offices of the bigwigs and making calls from their phones to dodgy numbers with and without the blocks in place. Some of the bigwigs had \"mini pbx's\" with manager/secretary and conference facilities that ran outside of the PBX often with unusual setups so not always easy to simulate by jumping in on the krone frame.\n\nOne of the other interesting aspects was that all extensions could make 999 calls, but would normally get rerouted to our own operator so that they were aware of the emergency and could co-ordinate things properly rather than an individual person calling the public emergency operator from our switchboard number which would not have given a very accurate user location. Only if our own operator could not answer would the call go through direct to the external 999 service. 999 calls would take priority over other calls in progress (ie someone would get dumped if all lines were busy) Which all had to be thoroughly tested. Turns out that at 4am on a boring sunday morning in some small provincial towns the 999 operators are rather welcoming of friendly calls from telephone engineers and enjoy a quick chat about things as we place multiple calls at the same time to try and make things fall over.\n\nHappy days and a great learning experience for a student.\n\nOptions are good.\n\nBack when I was working on the 4.xBSDs and lecturing quite a bit on the subject (roughly the 1980s), I was warned by a veteran professor that a bunch of the Freshman kids would probably be dropping their telephones in October after running up huge bills in September ... so I should ensure that they all knew how to use email as a primary form of contact. This telephone \"problem\" had been happening for a couple years, it seemed, and was becoming worse as time went on.\n\nThinking about it for a couple seconds, I told him I'd get right on it ... but instead of just teaching an email module, I also went into the intricacies of the by now fast becoming obsolete UUCP ... including an overview of Usenet.\n\nStrangely, that October was the last time for the mass drop-off in student owned telephones at Stanford and Berkeley. I wonder why?\n\nOn call now....\n\nI am a British ex-pat and have lived in the USA for 21 years and am now in the last six weeks before I retire from being on Technical Support/System Admin at a medium size American University.\n\nIt's 9pm Xmas eve here and I cannot confess to have diverted the redirect from our MS-Teams phone line support system to a porn line, but the prospect does intrigue me. Note I said I cannot confess to such a prank. Tee Hee.\n\nAnd yes, despite today being a holiday and nobody is at work, today we had a db server run out of space (db team took care of it, but we had several email exchanges) and one of our senior staff has asked for the umpteenth time if our Zabbix monitoring server system was going to be hit by a Java Log4j Vuln. It won't as it doesn't use Java but we are not sending him the link from the product web site about this, as we want him to grow another ulcer.\n\nSuggestions for last day pranks of this nature are more than welcome... Come on guys... Tell me what might be a fun thing to do...\n\nBT Digital Derived Services Network - useless facts\n\nAs the Bids and Contracts manager at AT&T Phillips Telecommunications UK Ltd responsible for the engineering of the mid-80s BT DDSN and Mondial DISC I can confirm that BT did not include Adult Chat Lines in their revenue projections. The core 5ESS-PRX software was based entirely on the Bell standard 5ESS switches widely used in the USA. What Phillips did was develop the CCITT standard signalling so we didn't need to use T1-E1 converters (although we did install them on the Baynard House trainer which was brought into service to counter the Mercury DMS100 based Centrex service aimed at City of London financial institutions). A small Yorkshire based telecoms company developed the TV online voting service after seeing it in action in the USA and got a revenue percentage for every vote.\n\nOne of the biggest issues was the Childline 0800 1111 non-standard number format, there were no other 4 digit numbers on the network so the guys wrote a bit of code that did early routing to the PSTN breakout number when 1111 was detected. The first node was went live in Baynard House and the capital cost was recovered in 12 weeks thanks to £5/min no billing cap Premium Rate lines.\n\nUSELESS FACTS:\n\n1. The DDSN remote maintenance computer was the first equipment installed in the underground bunker at the BT Oswestry NNCC.\n\n2. I learnt about the Challenger disaster from the BT Clerk of Works who came rushing into our weekly progress meeting to inform everyone\n\n3. I had lunch with that Bryan Carsberg\n\n4. I arranged entertainment for 'a BT exec' at an Atlanta telecoms conference after the contract was signed\n\n5. The Saudi Arabia MOPTT were responsible for the development of the 5ESS-PRX switch because they forced Phillips to find an alternative to their failed PRX-D offering\n\n6. The switches supported three flavours of CCITT #7 signalling - C7, C7-International and C7-BT\n\n7. My BT counterparts came to my wedding\n\nHappy 2022 folks!"
