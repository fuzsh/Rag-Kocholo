        "text": "City on Hainan Island, China\n\nFor other uses, see Sanya (disambiguation).\n\nPrefecture-level city in Hainan, China\n\nSanyaSimplified Chinese三亚Traditional Chinese三亞PostalSamahLiteral meaningThird below the second\n\nTranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinSānyàWade–GilesSan1-ya4IPA[sán.jâ]Yue: CantoneseYale RomanizationSāam-aaJyutpingSaam1-aa3IPA[sam˥ a˧]Southern MinHainanese RomanizationTâ-ⁿa\n\nSanya[a] is the southernmost city on Hainan Island, and one of the four prefecture-level cities of Hainan Province in South China.\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, the total population of Sanya was 1,031,396 inhabitants,[2] living in an area of 1,919.58 km2 (741.15 sq mi). Nevertheless, its built-up (or metro) area encompassing Haitang and Jiyang Districts was home to 801,020 inhabitants as of 2020.\n\nThe city is renowned for its tropical climate and has emerged as a popular tourist destination, also serving as the training site of the Chinese national beach volleyball team. Sanya is home to small concentrations of Utsul people. Sanya is also the location of Yulin Naval Base, a major military facility on the South China Sea which is home to the People's Liberation Army Navy ballistic nuclear missile fleet.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKnown in ancient times as Yazhou, postal romanization: Aichow (崖州), literally \"cliff state or prefecture\", Sanya's history dates to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE). Due to its remoteness from the political centers during the Qin dynasty, Sanya was sometimes called Tianya Haijiao (天涯海角), meaning \"the end of the sky and ocean\" or \"the end of the earth\". As a result, the city served as a place of exile for officials who found themselves out of favor with the country's rulers.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, a Buddhist monk accidentally landed here, using the site as a staging post on his missionary journey to Japan.[3]\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1912, Yazhou became Yaxian (Yai-hsien) (崖县; postal: Aihsien).\n\nIn 1958, administration of Yaxian relocated from Yacheng to Sanya and Yaxian merged with Baoting, Lingshui, Niulou, and Xinglong, Wanning, to become a large county. In 1959 and 1961, these areas were separated to establish Baoting and Lingshui while Yaxian County remained in its current prefecture. Approved by the State Council of China, Yaxian was upgraded to Sanya City on 26 September 1987 and Sanya City was officially established on 30 December 1987.[4]\n\nIn 2007, the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee announced that the city of Sanya would become the first leg of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay in China.[5]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nSanya lies at the southern tip of Hainan Island on Sanya Bay. Located at 18° 15' N latitude, Sanya is–after Sansha (also administered by Hainan Province)–the second-southernmost prefecture-level city nationally. Though the administrative area (Sanya City) has a rough topography, the city itself is generally flat, lying on a parcel of land between low-level mountains to the north and the South China Sea.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen Aw),[6] featuring hot weather all year around. Monsoonal influences are strong, with a relatively lengthy wet season and a pronounced dry season. The coolest month is January, with an average high temperature of 26.9 °C (80.4 °F), while the hottest, unlike much of the rest of China, is June, with an average high temperature of 32.5 °C (90.5 °F); the mean annual high temperature is 30.2 °C (86.4 °F). Water temperatures remain above 22 °C (72 °F) year-round.[7]\n\nSince meteorological records began, the average annual temperature in Sanya has warmed in fluctuations. Taking 2023 as an example, the average annual temperature in Sanya is 27.0 °C (80.6 °F), 0.5°C higher than the average from 1991 to 2020, with the average temperature of the coldest month (January) being 22.2 °C (72.0 °F) and the hottest month (June) being 29.9 °C (85.8 °F).[8]\n\nSubdivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore 30 July 2014, there was direct jurisdiction over four county-level districts and two township-level subdistricts (乡级管理区; xiāngjí guǎnlǐqū), six towns (镇; zhèn) and four state-run farms in Sanya City. Now there are four districts in Sanya.\n\nMap District Simplified Chinese Hanyu Pinyin Population\n\n(2010 census) Area\n\n(km2) Density\n\n(/km2) Jiyang 吉阳区 Jíyáng Qū 257,061 372 691.02 Tianya 天涯区 Tiānyá Qū 269,935 944 285.94 Haitang 海棠区 Hǎitáng Qū 76,562 255 300.24 Yazhou 崖州区 Yázhōu Qū 160,000 347 460.10\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nIn recent years Sanya has become a popular tourist destination. Numerous international five star hotel chains are now established in the area. In 2009, the luxury Mandarin Oriental, Sanya hotel opened in the Dadong Hai area, the first Mandarin Oriental property on Hainan Island. There are now over 100 hotels, ranging from international brands to locally managed resorts.\n\nRussian and English signs can be seen throughout the city. In response to claims of over-charging of tourists (whether foreign or Chinese) at restaurants in the city,[13] Hainan government officials and Sanya city officials have vowed to crack down on the practice.[14] The Sanya Industrial and Commercial Bureau has implemented a real-time information system of the city's seafood restaurants during the May Day holiday for public supervision in order to stop any future price gouging by restaurants.\n\nSanya also hosts the Guanyin of Nanshan, that is located within the Nanshan Temple (Sanya).\n\nNature reserves of Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park (亚龙湾热带 天堂森林公园) and Sanya Coral Reef National Nature Reserve (三亚珊瑚礁国家级自然保护区) are located nearby Yalong Bay, and Yalong Bay National Tourism Holiday Resort was created. In recent years, as the waters of Sanya Bay and others below mentioned are becoming clearer and healthier, several species of dolphins, including endangered Chinese white dolphins, appear along the coasts from time to time. However, they have not been considered as targeted tourism attractions.[15][16]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is served by Sanya Phoenix International Airport. Taxis are available throughout the city.\n\nBuses from other parts of Hainan serve Sanya's bus terminal. The No. 8 bus connects the airport to Dadonghai Beach. From there tourists can take the 24 or 25 bus to Yalong Bay or the 28 bus to Haitang Bay. There is also a free bus from Luhuitou Square to the Duty-Free Shopping Center at Haitang Bay, the largest such center in China.\n\nHainan East Ring Intercity Rail\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Hainan East Ring Intercity Rail links Sanya and Haikou and runs along the east coast of Hainan Island. There are 15 stations in between, either in operation or still under construction. Trains are designed to travel at 250 km/h (160 mph). Travel time from Sanya to Haikou is approximately 1 hour and 22 minutes. The Hainan Western Ring High-Speed Railway, running along the west coast of the province also links Sanya to Haikou.\n\nTram\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Sanya Tram\n\nSanya's tram service began trial operation on 7 January 2019.[17] Trams are composed of five carriages with a maximum seating capacity of 362 people. In built up and urbanised areas, the maximum speed of the tram is 50 km/h. The current tram route begins at Sanya Railway Station and finishes at Jiangang Road Station, which is currently the southernmost railway station in China. Full operation of the first line started on 10 October 2020.\n\nSocial services\n\n[edit]\n\nHospitals\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a total of 54 hospitals in Sanya as of March 2019, both public hospitals funded by the state and private hospitals. There are also numerous clinics for doing annual health-checks, which are usually brands of national chains in China, such as Ciming Healthcheck.\n\nHainan 301 Hospital, a branch hospital of People's Liberation Army General Hospital, is located in the Haitang Bay area of Sanya.[18] The hospital possesses a substantial number of state-of-the-art equipment for medical and research purposes which include a Da Vinci surgical system, different MIR system (including 1.5T MRI 3.0T MRI), Helical CT facilities (including 128-Slices CT), medical linear accelerator and electronic microscopes which are worth more than 450 million yuan. The hospital has 500 patient beds, and a total of 74 clinical, medical and nursing departments.\n\nSanya Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital (三亚市中医院) is located on Fenghuang Road.[19] It is a grade-A tertiary hospital offering medical care, education, research, healthcare services and International Chinese Medicine exchange and cooperation.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nColleges and universities\n\n[edit]\n\nSanya University (三亚学院) Located at Xueyuan Rd., Yingbin Ave. Sanya Hainan 572022. Sanya University is an independent undergraduate university. The university has fourteen schools: Social Development, Law, Finance and Economics, Management, Tourism Management, Humanities and Communication, Arts, Foreign Languages, Engineering, Physical Education, General Education & Foundation Courses, International Tourism, International Education and Music, and other, and offers 56 undergraduate majors.[20]\n\nQiongzhou University (琼州大学) is located at 1 Yucai Road. The only public university located in Sanya, Qiongzhou is actively pursuing more foreign enrollments, hoping to attract Chinese tourism and language students to the city.[21] Courses offered to international students are: elementary Chinese, intermediate Chinese, advanced Chinese (listening, speaking, reading and writing), English, Russian (listening, speaking, reading and writing), Chinese calligraphy and painting, Chinese martial arts, Chinese history, studies of Li and Miao Cultures, tourism and recreational management, and music performance.\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city government states on its website that \"Being the second-largest city in Hainan, the education in Sanya is relatively better than the average level in Hainan Province\" but that the kindergartens are not as good as those in major Chinese cities and that the primary and secondary schools are still below the Chinese national average.[22]\n\nAccording to the city government, Primary schools No.7 and No.9 are the best in the city and that Bayi Primary School \"is also of good quality\".[22] The city government identifies the best lower secondary (junior high school) and upper secondary (senior high school) institutions as Sanya Shiyan Middle School and Sanya No.1 High School, respectively.[22]\n\nThe International School of Sanya (formerly Canadian International School of Sanya) is the first school to offer two programs: Canadian and Mandarin, in Hainan. The school has announced its relocation to the BanShanBanDao -Serenity Coast (半山半岛) residential area in August 2014, where the new campus will offer pre-K. day students and boarding facilities for students.[citation needed]\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has hosted:\n\nBoao Forum for Asia Annual high level forums for world leaders focused on the Asian region and its stakeholders.\n\n2014 WTTC Global Summit Keynote speakers: Kofi Annan, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Dame DeAnne Julius, Yao Ming\n\n2011–12 Volvo Ocean Race Leg 4 Start to Auckland\n\n2011 BRICS summit\n\nElite Model Look in 2008 and 2009\n\nMiss World contest in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2018\n\nMister World contest in 2007\n\nWorld's Strongest Man contest in 2006 and 2013\n\n2012 Sanya International Beach Musical Festival[23][24]\n\n2013 ITF Women's Circuit – Sanya\n\n2014–15 Volvo Ocean Race In-port race and Leg 4 Start to Auckland\n\nFIA Formula E Sanya ePrix from 2019[25]\n\n2020 Asian Beach Games[26]\n\nSister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nCountry City Date United States Alhambra, California 1994.10.05 Philippines Lapu-Lapu 1997.07.19 France Cannes 1997.11.17 South Korea Seogwipo 2008.04.04 Mexico Cancún 2010.08.10 Russia Khabarovsk 2011.11.28 United Kingdom Blackpool 2016.09.06 Malaysia George Town, Penang 2017[27]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nSanya Sunset\n\nSetting Sun at Sanya Beach\n\nEast part of Sanya\n\nBeach Scene\n\nSunset at Sanya Bay\n\nA hotel in Sanya\n\nSanya Bay Beach\n\nA street corner\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
