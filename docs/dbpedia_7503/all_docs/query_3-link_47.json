I'm sure few people realize that it was the same person who\n\nwrote the music to: \"Chinatown,\" \"Alien,\" \"Total Recall\" and \"Planet\n\nof the Apes\" (he disliked his own score for \"Alien,\" but it's a great\n\nexample of how a minimalist score can enhance the visual atmosphere of\n\nthe film).\n\n\"Matthew B.

The ending Hitchcock supposedly\n\n*really* wanted was of Lina writing a letter detailing all the police would\n\nneed to know about Johnnie's crimes, and adding that she could not live with\n\nthe thought of bringing his child into the world. She asks him to mail the\n\nletter, drinks the poisoned milk, and expires. The final shot was to be of\n\nJohnnie cheerfully popping the letter into a pillar box.\n\n> While we're on Cary Grant...

How do they support\n\nthe film? They produce the right aural atmosphere for any\n\ngiven scene at any given time...timed perfectly with the\n\naction on screen. To do this, they need to use established\n\nsound pictures that already educe certain feelings in our\n\nbrains...things that we have imprinted on whether we\n\nknow it or not. The great ones have a good instinct for\n\nthis. That's why I think John Williams is one of the best.\n\nHe knows just where to steal from. :-)\n\n\n\nWilliam Sommerwerck wrote:\n\n> > WS: MSPC is the work.

I don't have time to listen to the film\n\n> and research this.\n\nFWIW, I just listened to the cue in question from Psycho (named\n\nFinale) and it was just as I said, a similar instrumentation and mood,\n\nboth feature falling minor 2nds and a kind of call and response\n\npattern, but there is no quotation or anything that is close enough to\n\nbe considered borrowing, much less theft. The MSPC motto (rising m2,\n\nm3, falling m2, m2) is quite distinctive. In the Psycho cue there are\n\na lot of falling minor seconds in two registers and then the score's\n\nprincipal motto, which is a rising minor 7th followed by a falling\n\nmajor 7th. MSPC was likely an inspiration to Herrmann, but if you\n\nwant to look for a piece that sounds even more like a possible model\n\nfor the Psycho score, try Honegger's Symphony for Strings and Trumpet.\n\nEl Klauso wrote:\n\n>\n\n> EK: Or, look to Herrmann's own earlier concert output for his\n\n> inspiration.\n\n>\n\n> His 1935 Sinfonietta for Strings, a work that dabbles in atonality,\n\n> was the source several pieces in \"Psycho,\" including the final motive\n\n> that he re-used in his last score, \"Taxi Driver.\" Need it be pointed\n\n> out that Bartok's MSPC was composed in 1936, and that Honegger's\n\n> Second is a product of the 1940's ?\n\nFair enough, but the Bartok and Honegger similarities occur in\n\ndifferent sections and, as far as I'm concerned those similarities are\n\nconjectural anyhow. I think Herrmann absorbed a lot and digested it\n\ninto his own, very distinctive style. Of course he sounds more like\n\nhimself than anyone else, though I'd say the Psycho score is a great\n\nimprovement on the Sinfonietta.\n\nThe return of the Psycho death motif in Taxi Driver is very\n\ninteresting, as it suggests the idea of Travis' Taxi as a coffin. The\n\nlast time we hear the motif in Psycho is as Marian's car (which has\n\nbecome her coffin) is hauled out of the swamp.\n\n\n\nHerrmann comes pretty close to direct quotation in his score for \"The\n\nDay The Earth Stood Still\" (1950). The opening trumpet theme certainly\n\nseems to be patterned after the opening of Richard Strauss's \"Also\n\nSprach Zarathusta\" (though, to my ears, it also sounds much like an\n\ninverted version of the opening theme of Bruckner's Third Symphony).\n\nIn the film's cue titled \"Rebirth\" (track 15 of the film soundtrack on\n\nFox 07822-1100-2, about 50 seconds into the track), Herrmann\n\ntransposes (for theremins) a brief passage from the end of the first\n\nsection (Largo: Happy Memories of Childhood) of Strauss's \"Death and\n\nTransfiguration.\" If you have Rodzinski's recording of the latter on\n\nEMI, the referenced passage is heard at about 4:38. In the film, the\n\nlead character Klaatu has just been \"reborn\" (or transfigured, if you\n\nwill), so the musical quotation strikes me as particularly apt.\n\nHowever, Herrmann's scores generally evoke the mood and spirit of\n\nother composers' works without usng direct quotation (e.g., Wagner's\n\nTristan & Isolde in Vertigo, Bartok in Psycho, the Mahler 4th last\n\nmvt. in The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad). Perhaps needless to say,\n\nHerrmann is one of my very favorite film composers.\n\nCordially,\n\nJeff Lipscomb"
