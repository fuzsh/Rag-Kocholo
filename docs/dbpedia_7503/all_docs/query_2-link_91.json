It is standard practice for studios to specify in these contracts the publisher who will take the copyright for the music produced under the agreement. Most of the publishers named in his contracts have been sold a number of times. The best way to ascertain copyright ownership of a film score is to consult the performance rights societies ASCAP and BMI for current ownership. Herrmann was a member of ASCAP until the end of 1959, when he joined BMI. The finding guide for our collection indicates the ASCAP or BMI affiliation and the initial publisher of most of the film scores. Contact the appropriate society with the name and date of the film, indicating that you want to locate the current copyright holder to request permission for a photocopy of the unpublished score.\n\nACE (www.ascap.com/ace), a searchable database of ASCAP titles, is available on the web to verify current ownership status.\n\nASCAP has two offices:\n\n1 Lincoln Plaza\n\nNew York, NY 10023\n\nPhone: (212) 621-6329\n\n7920 Sunset Blvd., Suite 300\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90046\n\nPhone: (213) 883-1000\n\nThe society should respond with an address and contact person. Write this person with your request, telling them what use you plan to make of what you are requesting.\n\nBMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.) is located at:\n\n320 W. 57th Street\n\nNew York, NY 10019\n\nPhone: (212) 586-2000\n\nA searchable database of BMI compositions (www.bmi.com) titles is available on the web to verify current ownership status.\n\nFor inquiries about performing Herrmann’s film music contact:"
