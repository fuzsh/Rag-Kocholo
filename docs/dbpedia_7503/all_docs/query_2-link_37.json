        "text": "This CD offers some of Bernard Herrmann most imaginative music beginning with the rousing Death Hunt\" from On Dangerous Ground in which the National Philharmonic's brass does the near-impossible. The suite from Citizen Kane is well-chosen, with a young Kiri Te Kanawa singing the aria from the opera Salammbo. In the movie this was poorly sung by Kane's wife in an opera production mounted specially for her. Gerhardt decided that Hermann's glorious music should be presented in a first-class performance, the way Kane heard it in his own mind. This is the only time in the entire CFS series when music was not presented basically as it was in the film. You'll also hear the resplendent sounds of 9 shimmering harps in Beneath the 12-Mile Reef and a suite from White Witch Doctor with exotic percussion and a strange instrument called the serpent.\" -- Robert Benson, Classical CD Review\n\nThis CD offers some of Bernard Herrmann most imaginative music beginning with the rousing Death Hunt\" from On Dangerous Ground in which the National Philharmonic's brass does the near-impossible.
