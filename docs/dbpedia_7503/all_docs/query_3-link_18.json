The man behind the low woodwinds that open Citizen Kane (1941), the shrieking violins of Psycho (1960), and the plaintive saxophone of Taxi Driver (1976) was one of the most original and distinctive composers ever to work in film. He started early, winning a composition prize at the age of 13 and founding his own orchestra at the age of 20. After writing...",

        "text": "The last film he ever saw was Larry Cohen's God Told Me To (1976). Herrmann was Cohen's original choice to score the film because of his work on Die Wiege des BÃ¶sen (1974), but he died in his sleep that night, hours after it was screened for him. The film was dedicated to Herrmann in his honor.\n\nWhen Bernard Herrmann arrived in Hollywood, his natural gifts for film scoring were immediately recognized. He received Oscar nominations for his first two films, \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\" (1941), and won the award for the latter. It was the beginning of a tempestuous relationship with the movie industry. Herrmann was unusual among film composers of the time in working on a per-film basis, refusing to be put under long-term contract; he insisted on doing his own orchestrations and introduced instruments and techniques that were new to Tinseltown scoring, such as the electronic effects in \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951). But Herrmann's abrasive personality and explosive, irrational temper alienated friends and made him many enemies in the industry, and they retaliated through the Motion Picture Academy. After 1941 he received only one Oscar nomination during his lifetime, for \"Anna and the King of Siam\" (1946), while much of his best work - including all his films with Alfred Hitchcock - was snubbed. After Herrmann's death in December 1975, the Academy posthumously nominated him for his last two films, \"Obsession\" (1976) and \"Taxi Driver\" (1976)."
