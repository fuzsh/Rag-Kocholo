        "text": "(1911–75). U.S. composer and conductor Bernard Herrmann is considered by many critics to be one of the most important composers of film music. His score for the suspense film Psycho (1960) has been imitated by numerous composers as a blueprint for terror.\n\nBernard Herrmann was born on June 29, 1911, in New York City to a family of Russian immigrants. While attending DeWitt Clinton High School, Herrmann enrolled at New York University. He later studied at Juilliard.\n\nIn 1934, CBS radio hired Herrmann to work as a composer- arranger and to conduct the CBS Symphony Orchestra. At CBS he worked with Orson Welles on his Mercury Theater on the Air. Welles’s story selections, which ran from Shakespeare to Dashiell Hammett, gave Herrmann the opportunity to compose in a wide range of styles, always remaining focused on the dramatic effect the music was to play. When RKO offered Orson Welles a contract to write and direct a film in 1939, Welles brought many of his Mercury players and Herrmann along with him.\n\nHerrmann’s first film score, for Citizen Kane (1941), proved a marvelous showcase. It contained parodies of newsreel music, an opera excerpt purposely scored above its singer’s range to portray her incompetence, and a minor-key ominous opening that foreshadowed his work with film director Alfred Hitchcock. In his first year as a film composer he received Academy Award nominations for both Citizen Kane and for his sardonic twists on a Celtic reel in William Dietrle’s film All That Money Can Buy (also known as The Devil and Daniel Webster). He won the Oscar for All That Money Can Buy. With these scores, he brought 20th-century innovations to film music, which had previously been firmly rooted in 19th-century romanticism.\n\nHerrmann remained a leading film and television composer until his death in the mid-1970s. During the 1950s and ’60s, he frequently worked with Alfred Hitchcock. In Vertigo (1958), his music was crucial to maintain the dreamlike mood during long cinematic sequences without dialogue. The masterful string score for Psycho was a perfect match for Hitchcock’s stark black-and-white imagery. Herrmann also wrote the unsettling theme for Rod Serling’s TV series The Twilight Zone (1959). His score for Taxi Driver (1975), completed for director Martin Scorsese only hours before his death, was a masterful depiction of emotional isolation in New York City. Herrmann’s notable action scores include North by Northwest (1959), The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), and Mysterious Island (1961).\n\nHerrmann also composed concert music including a cantata, Moby Dick, and an opera, Wuthering Heights, but he took his film and television scores very seriously; many of them have taken on lives of their own in numerous recordings and concert performances. Bernard Herrmann died on December 24, 1975, in Los Angeles."
