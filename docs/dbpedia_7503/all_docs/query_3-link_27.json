These four, very different, men had one thing in common; all their landmark films, from Welles' Citizen Kane, to Hitchcock's Vertigo, to Scorsese's Taxi Driver shared the same composer, Bernard Herrmann. Many of the most famous musical moments in film history came from the pen of this exceptional man.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nDOC 139LP\n\nDoxy present Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack for John Lee Thompson's 1962 thriller Cape Fear.

DISC\n\nDOP 8009LP\n\nDoxy present a picture disc reissue of Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack for Vertigo, originally released in 1958. Herrmann wrote the bulk of the score for Vertigo, considered by many critics and by Herrmann himself to be his finest film score, in a little over a month. Hitchcock places Herrmann's background music in direct opposition to music that is played deliberately as part of the action of the film. While Herrmann's score represents the forces of destiny and the mysterious dream world inhabited by Madeleine, music that Midge plays on her radio and record player represents her world and the norms and strictures of conventional society. Herrmann scored the swirling harps and strings that imbue most of the pivotal action sequences in the film to mirror the vertigo that dogs the protagonist. Essential.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nDOC 118LP\n\nRepressed.

Undertaken as a flamboyant experiment with neorealism, it differs significantly from his most famous films in both style and substance. Similarly, Bernard Herrmann's minimalist score took simple devices already in evidence in his previous film work to an unprecedented extreme. While Hitchcock never again attempted such an austere and moody work, the brooding score laid the groundwork for much of the rest of Herrmann's career. First press limited to 500 copies.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nDOC 115LP\n\n2016 repress.

Cordially, I. Stravinsky.' The Tippett Quartet capture the energy and musical finesse of Herrmann's works in this recording, accompanied for Souvernirs de Voyage by the clarinetist Julian Bliss and featuring a new arrangement of his score for Psycho.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n4LP\n\nDOY 003LP"
