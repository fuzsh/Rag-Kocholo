[H]\n\nFahrenheit 451 is definitely one of Herrmann's best. Though having just watched Hangover Square, I was thinking THAT is one of his best. Each of his scores seems to be one of his best. He wrote the most perfect film music of any composer who ever lived, in addressing exactly what the film needed at any given moment, but also being artistically brilliant as pure music, as in the case of Vertigo which is some of the best music of any kind written at that time."
