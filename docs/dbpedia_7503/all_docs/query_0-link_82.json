        "text": "Gretchen- Thank you very much. I had been poking around too and got as far as the name of the piece and the date. I just went to the site you suggested and went through the entire list of Bernard Herman scores that they have, and it’s not there. It’s so frustrating. I can’t find the printed music nor a recording of it anywhere.\n\nBernard Herrmann has always been my favorite film composer, but I just recently discovered that he wrote a stunning segment with solo harp for one of my favorite old movies, The Day the Earth Stood Still from 1951 with Michael Rennie. It’s all bass wire pedal slides, and it’s in the part where the little boy is secretly following Michael Rennie as he sneaks back to his spaceship. A wonderful little Easter egg for us harpists, I’m sure nobody else knew what the unusual sound was. Herrmann also wrote for lots of Hitchcock movies including Psycho, and for other great films like The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Taxi Driver, and the original Jane Eyre with Orson Welles (I love old movies). I’m sorry I don’t know anything about the flute/harp piece in question but I’d love to hear it since he seemed to know a good bit about the harp.\n\nMaybe our Hollywood expert David Ice knows more about Bernard Herrmann…\n\nBernard Hermmann notice spelling with double letters.\n\nBernard Hermmann Society\n\nhttp://www.bernardherrmann.org/\n\nDirect links: may not open.
