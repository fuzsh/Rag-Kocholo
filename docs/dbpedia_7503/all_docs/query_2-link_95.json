        "text": "The Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873–1943) has long occupied a prominent place in the concert repertoire, but his critical standing has been ambiguous: some have viewed him as one of the greatest of his time, while others have strongly questioned the value of his music. Although many writings on the composer note this paradox, his critical reception has not previously been the subject of a thorough independent study, and, as a result, there is little consensus concerning its basic ideological, temporal, and geographical circumstances. This dissertation begins the task of elucidating Rachmaninoff’s international critical reception by examining his treatment in 226 music lexicons published from 1900 to 2013 in eleven European languages, employing a straightforward mode of reception history within the theoretical context of canon formation. The dissertation presents two principal findings. First, the ideological composition of the critical reception is more complex than has generally been believed. Rachmaninoff’s music was disparaged not only by modernists, who found it old-fashioned, but also by nationalists, who considered it cosmopolitan for not adhering overtly to the idiom of the \"kuchka,\" as well as from the broader critical standpoint of classicism itself—that is, from the nexus of values that has defined the tradition of Western “classical music” since the nineteenth century. Second, this criticism notwithstanding, most critical evaluations of the composer, as in music lexicons, have been affirmative. Rachmaninoff elicited not a single negative assessment in the genre until 1938, and Eric Blom’s oft-cited belittling of the composer in the 1954 edition of Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians was exceptional for its period. The highest concentration of negative assessments occurred in the 1970s on the European continent. These still constituted a minority, however, and the same decade also witnessed the rise, in Great Britain, of an affirmative reappraisal of the composer in music lexicons that would spread, by the early-twenty-first century, to every region surveyed. A new international consensus emerged as negative assessments were replaced with affirmative ones and those that were already affirmative increased in detail and favorability.\n\nI want to speak of music….as a country, our native country which determines our musicians’ nationality, our musicality, a country in relation to which all our “ideologies”, schools, individualities, are merely sides. This was how Nikolai Medtner (1880-1951) began his book, The Muse and the Fashion. But was this nationality - outlined by a man described by many as the ‘Russian Brahms’ - a country of Europe (such as the Classical Viennese tradition) Russia, or a combination? The twentieth century was a booming era for Russian music with the emergence of Rachmaninov, Scriabin, Shostakovich and Prokofiev, following on from The Mighty Handful’s attempts to bring nationalism to the forefront of consciousness. Thus Medtner went relatively unnoticed during his lifetime. Born in Moscow, but with a family that descended from Europe, Medtner was influenced by the West and Russia in life as well as in music. War and Revolution had major impacts on the Russian people, economy and arts. Against this backdrop, Medtner lived a complex but impoverished life, only finding financial security much later and after moving to Europe. Nonetheless, he was an educated composer, influenced by great philosophers, as well as his personal passions, from nature to faith. Thus his music was open to a variety of influences, but above all sits that of nationality. Great composers and philosophers from both Europe and Russia had preceded Medtner, with yet more working alongside him - particularly his friend and fellow pianist, Rachmaninov. By looking at Medtner’s life, philosophy and solo piano music - focussing on several poignant examples - this thesis will attempt to ascertain the extent to which Medtner’s music can be heard as Russian or European.\n\nThe dissertation focuses on the early piano sonatas of Russian composer Nikolai Karlovich Medtner (1880–1951). It approaches them in the context of genre history, confronts them with other composer’s works, and discusses them from various analytic perspectives. A special goal is to consider the pieces in the aesthetic environment of their time, and to regard them as peculiar instances of the ›sonata principle‹, an ageless conception of musical form. The study is subdivided in three large parts, the first of which presents a summary of sonata composition before Medtner, exploring lines of tradition in Western Europe and Russia. The second part concentrates on Medtner’s musical language and its stylistic features. The third and most comprehensive part provides detailed examinations of eight of Medtner’s piano sonatas, including aspects of their genesis and reception, and making use of recent methods of musical analysis.\n\nThroughout his career, John Williams has set the musical tone for the American presidency, most elaborately with his scores for Oliver Stone's controversial films JFK (1991) and Nixon (1995). While invested in capturing the character of these commanders in chief through musical codes, Williams's soundtracks are equally engaged in the act of the evocation and telling of “history.” Specifically, they construct a tragic myth of 1960s America in which the promise represented by JFK is destroyed from without, and Nixon from within, both by the malevolent forces of the military-industrial complex. In considering the thematic and dramatic means by which Williams paints his orchestral portraits, I reveal the extent to which music supports Stone's paranoiac narratives, especially in cases where the director's collage-like visual aesthetic puts pressure on the otherwise nostalgic traits of Williams's default tonal style. I offer a music-analytical approach to JFK and Nixon informed by interviews, studies of political mythology and paranoia, and musicological appraisals of Williams's music. Stone's 1960s-as-lapsarian-metanarrative positions Kennedy as a romanticized absence, an image of the fabular fallen King, and Williams renders him as a public recollection rather than a human being with interiority. Nixon, by contrast, is a tragic antihero, consumed by dark forces of history and an abundance of ambivalent thematic material. Particular attention is paid to the dismantling of Kennedy's noble leitmotif during JFK’s prologue and motorcade sequence and to the near-fascistic musical accompaniment of Nixon's speeches. Having demonstrated the active role these scores play, I conclude that Williams's music constitutes an authoring of history in a strong, albeit postmodern, sense, consistent with but independent from Stone's screenplay.\n\nIt has long been a truism of music criticism that nineteenth-century Russian symphonic music lacks a true sense of development when compared with a normative German model. This article puts forward an alternative way of approaching Russian instrumental music, from the perspective of a different conception of musical and historical time. By interrogating both musically and culturally this idea of temporality, the article suggests a potential distinction between a specifically Western model of time and historical progress - marked by the qualities of onward teleological process and the capacity for organic development, as celebrated in the archetypal Beethovenian symphonic style - and a static, cyclical, repetitive, even timeless conception that may be seen to apply more aptly to several pieces of the nineteenth-century Russian repertory. Yet this neat binary opposition created between East and West is seen to be overly simplistic for many pieces that fall outside the small group of high-profile nationalist works from the Kuchka. The article ultimately argues for a richer understanding of music’s relation with time within both Russian and Austro-German traditions\n\nAlthough Charles Ives is rarely considered a major influence on movie scoring, the composer Bernard Herrmann, in both his film scores and his symphonic compositions, drew on Ives' techniques and his broader aesthetic. However, Herrmann did so sparingly incorporating only one or two of Ives' techniques in a symphonic work or film score. The result is a fusion of Ivesian modernism with Herrmann's own neo-Romantic idiom; a contribution to film music that has been almost completely overlooked. Herrmann's cantata Moby Dick, dedicated to Ives, is discussed along with his film scores, The Devil and Daniel Webster (dir. William Dieterle) and Hangover square (dir. John Brahm), in order to explore the impact of the older composer. The psychological hallmarks of Herrmann's film scores, shocking orchestral colors, unresolved chromaticisms, and ostinatos, are also significant characteristics of Ives' music. Herrmann's use of these practices, refined in his later, more famous scores as well, profoundly influenced future film composers and thus the development of music for cinema."
