Join us on this bizarre musical trek to...somewhere?\n\nFollow us on the socials below, and for even more bonus content visit us at our Patreon page.\n\nNEXT EPISODE: True Romance (1993)\n\nComposed by Uncle Hans Zimmer\n\nThis week we order doubles instead of singles, meaning we are in way over our heads discussing a film that most critics consider the greatest of all time. Join us as we try not to embarrass ourselves over Citizen Kane and its legendary score by Bernard Herrmann.\n\nWelcome to \"comPOSERS The Movie Score Podcast\", where three old musician friends of dubious talent enjoy some movie-themed drinks while discussing film scores and the films they're in. Our goal is to find the perfect movie score, and our journey takes us some really weird places. Each episode, the boys discuss and review a film and its associated score, assigning a totally meaningless percentage grade based on enjoyment (45%), score-to-film (45%) and a silly category unique to the movie (10%). The answers will shock and amaze you, we hope! Join us on this bizarre musical trek to...somewhere? Follow us on the socials (Twitter and Instagram, currently) @composerspod, then sit back, pour yourself an adult beverage and enjoy some comPOSING."
