        "text": "Yesterday, the famous movie music composer Bernard Herrmann would have been 106 years old. He did not only share his brilliance in his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock, but in all the movie scores he composed. It’s for that reason that he is a favourite among many cinephiles. He certainly was among those movie composers who perfectly knew how to musically illustrate the atmosphere of a film.\n\nI didn’t have time to “celebrate” him yesterday as I was working, but I thought I should honour him today with one of my traditional top lists! So, let me introduce you my 10 most favourite Bernard Herrmann scores! Of course, that was a most difficult exercise as he was a master of music. I had to change the order of my top many times.\n\nBefore continuing, remember that these are my personal favourite ones, so it’s purely subjective. You obviously can’t contest my personal tastes. 😉\n\nOk, here we go!\n\n10. Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960)\n\nAh! How can we forget this haunting music regrouping strings only?! The shower scene is not the most “melodious” Bernard Hermann moment, but probably the one people will remember the most.\n\n9. Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941)\n\nAs much as I’m not THAT much a fan of this film (despite the fact that it is considered the best movie of all times and blablabla), there are TWO things that I love enormously about it, one of them being the music (the other one being Joseph Cotten). I love how it is at the time very sinister or very joyful. Typical Herrmann!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0sPzQWCHPE\n\n8.The Man Who Knew Too Much (Alfred Hitchcock, 1956)\n\nMy favourite Hitchcock’s film! And certainly one of my favourite Bernard Herrmann scores! It’s so orchestral, I love it! You unfortunately won’t hear it in this clip, but, during the film, there are some notes that remind us a lot of Vertigo‘s score that Herrmann will compose two years later. Of course, we all remember Herrmann’s cameo in the film! 🙂\n\n7. Marnie (Alfred Hitchcock, 1964)\n\nWithout being Hitchcock’s best film, one can’t deny that this is among Herrmann’s best scores! Actually, it might be the best thing about this film. I absolutely love it.\n\n6. Vertigo (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958)\n\nWhen those notes start, you know you are in for something special! Somehow, I can always see Carlotta Valdes’s portrait when I hear this music or the famous dream sequence. A team work between Hitchcock and Hermann always creates prodigies! Another film that is considered “the best of all times” and, once again, Bernard Herrmann had the chance to be part of the team!\n\n5. North by Northwest (Alfred Hitchcock, 1959)\n\nAs far as I can remember, North by Northwest has always been one of my very favourite music scores. It succeeds to so perfectly capture the attention of the viewers. Once again, one can perfectly visualize the film in his/her head while listening to this GREAT score!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2qZzRuIQuk\n\n4. Jane Eyre (Robert Stevenson, 1944)\n\nI must be honest, I didn’t become familiar with that score until… well today. The reason is that I’ve seen the movie only once and quite a long time ago, so let’s say the music was not necessarily fresh in my memory! But when I was re-listening to some of the Herrmann scores, I discovered how great it was! I just can’t believe I haven’t took the time to listen to it more carefully before. It’s just ace! Somehow, I can visualize the movie in my head when I listen to it. It truly makes me want to watch it again! 4m14 – 4m30: this moment is absolutely terrifying, but great!\n\n3. The Day the Earth Stood Still (Robert Wise, 1951)\n\nThat is THE sound of science-fiction! My favourite sci-fi film and very probably my favourite music score for a sci-fi film. In this score, we can hear both acoustic and electronic instruments, including two Theremins, which create those typical sounds from outer space.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cPEchNTSE0\n\n2. Obsession (Brian de Palma, 1976)\n\nIt goes without saying, I am obsessed with this film score (ouuuu!). It’s just spellbinding. I especially love the first minutes of it. I can always see the scene where Cliff Robertson throws the suitcase with the money on the street or that unforgettable final scene… For a movie that is very similar to Vertigo, Bernard Herrmann was of course the ultimate choice for the music!\n\nAnd\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTaxi Driver (Martin Scorsese, 1976)\n\nAh, the last and ultimate Bernard Herrman’s score! From Citizen Kane (his first movie music score) to Taxi Driver (his last), he proved to be an absolute musical master. Taxi Driver‘s music is so mesmerizing and fits perfectly the dark New-Yorkian atmosphere of the film. It sort of makes me want to take saxophone lessons!\n\nWell, that’s it! I hope you enjoyed! Of course, don’t hesitate to share your personal favourites in the comment section!\n\nCheers to Herrmann!"
