        "text": "I have been running a film blog for nearly five years, and have not until now attempted what many would regard as the most obvious film for any cinema enthusiast. A box office failure at the time, Citizen Kane garnered a number of Oscar nominations. It was rediscovered and topped the British Film Institute’s Sight and Sound decennial poll for 50 years.\n\nThis is the film that launched the career of Orson Welles, one of the most brilliant and erratic of directors, and it brought attention to a number of other people who would be associated with cinema for a long time. Joseph Cotton became a big star. Bernard Herrmann provided the music score – he would go on to make some of the most memorable music of the next few decades, notably in films such as Vertigo and Psycho.\n\nCitizen Kane was edited by Robert Wise, later a great director in his own right. I have already reviewed The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Haunting, two of Wise’s films. He was assisted by Mark Robson, another notable director. I have reviewed two Robson movies, The Seventh Victim and Isle of the Dead.\n\nSo why would I hesitate to touch the film so long? Is it that I dislike Citizen Kane? The answer is no. I have mixed feelings about Orson Welles as a director. When I think about him, I think of a director who makes films designed to appeal to film studies lecturers, rather than audiences. Then I think again, and remember how often I have been entertained by Welles.\n\nIt is fair to say that much of Welles’ oeuvre is undistinguished, despite some amazing pinnacles of brilliance. Sometimes there is too much dialogue or heavy-handed humour getting in the way of the action. Often the storyline drifts and is lost amidst the technical brilliance.\n\nA sketch on a British satire show Spitting Image had Welles leaving a recording behind after his death in which he explains that as a private joke he lived his life backwards, beginning his career with wine adverts, and finishing his life with his masterpiece, Citizen Kane.\n\nNonetheless I have already reviewed Touch of Evil, The Lady from Shanghai and The Stranger. I am certainly not indifferent to the brilliant flights of fantasy and roguish charm of Welles. The Spitting Image sketch was hardly fair. Most decades in Welles’ career produced at least one great film.\n\nSometimes I am repelled by Welles’ celebration of the great man, a man usually played by Welles himself. This great man may be flawed or corrupt, but ultimately he towers above the more weak-willed virtuous characters. It is better to be great, whatever the consequences, Welles seems to say, than to be decent but mediocre. It is hard not to wonder if the many great men (in films such as Citizen Kane, The Lady from Shanghai, and Touch of Evil) are Welles’ love letter to himself.\n\nStill egotism is not a reason to dislike Welles. If I disliked every director with a large ego, I would watch very little cinema. No, the essential problem I face is trying to write a blog about a film that has been analysed scene by scene by so many critics that I fear having nothing new to add to the discussion.\n\nStill I am not a serious film critic, and this blog is an appreciation of films I like. Citizen Kane deserves a place here. It is time for me to climb the rock face and post my own thoughts.\n\nThere is much talk about the innovative film techniques used by Welles, and an almost equal amount of talk about whether any of these methods were nearly as original as people said. It is fair to say that Welles drew liberally on his background as a producer in the theatre and on the radio, and he watched films with careful attention while he learned his own craft.\n\nThe influence of the theatre can be seen in the way that Welles portrays the music number in praise of Charles Foster Kane (Welles), and in the failed opera career of Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore). However it can be seen in other ways. The showmanship and attention-grabbing methods used by Kane are echoed in the ways that Welles seeks to grab the audience’s attention, constantly shifting between different styles of storytelling to keep his tale fluid and interesting.\n\nWelles’ time working on the radio can be seen in his use of sound in the film. He employs overlapping dialogue in places. At other times the characters take it in turns to speak, but in the manner of a Greek chorus, each speaker in a different part of the room adding one more opinion about Kane. Welles alters the sound perspectives of the characters who speak to one another in Kane’s luxury home Xanadu, so that we have a sense of the distance from which they are speaking to one another.\n\nIt is not just aurally but visually that Welles’ film works its magic. He uses deep focus cinematography that allows us to see both the foreground and background of his carefully composed shots. Lighting is frequently dark, and chiaroscuro effects are used. Other techniques include temporal jump-cuts well ahead of Godard, long dissolves to reflect the passage of time, and little jarring effects. The scene will suddenly jump to a shot of a cockatoo shrieking, or time will pass without warning in a lightning montage.\n\nIn terms of narrative structure, Citizen Kane was unusual for its time. Welles dispenses with opening credits, putting up only the name of the film. This was new for the 1940s, but has been used many times since. The chronology of the story is non-linear, except in the sense that the facts are revealed at the same time as a reporter uncovers them. Nonetheless the basic timeline of Kane’s life is revealed, albeit with overlapping elements.\n\nAre any of these methods truly the creation of Orson Welles? Fastidious critics point out that many of them can be found in German Expressionist cinema. D W Griffith humorously expressed his pleasure at seeing his own techniques recreated in Citizen Kane. Deep focus camerawork had been used a year before by Alfred Hitchcock in Rebecca. A year before that, John Ford created sets that had ceilings, a rarity in movies at the time, for his western Stagecoach (a film much-watched by Welles).\n\nDoes it detract from the renown of Welles that his methods were not as new as people once thought? Absolutely not. No film-maker exists in a vacuum, reinventing cinema without looking to the past. The crowning achievement of Welles was to take many techniques that had already been used, to combine them in one film, and to use them in a more sophisticated way than had been done before.\n\nStill is all this glittering innovation merely style over content? To an extent Welles is showing off with the bravura and enthusiasm of a new moviemaker. Nonetheless Citizen Kane is a film that has substance and meaning, and the technical innovations remain at the service of the story.\n\nCitizen Kane is said to have been based on the life of media baron William Randolph Hearst, and Hearst saw enough parallels to wage war on the film, and prohibit any mention of it in his newspapers. However there were other important public figures, including Joseph Pulitzer, who were incorporated into the character of Charles Foster Kane, and he may be seen as a composite of various powerful media figures.\n\nThe scene is set in the film’s opening moments. A camera seems to rise gradually over a very high fence that contains a No Trespassing sign. It emphasises just how high are the walls that Charles Foster Kane has erected between himself and the real world. There will be a number of scenes in the movie with ascending camera shots.\n\nGradually we move to a murky matte painting of Kane’s dream home, Xanadu, which is a large house with monkeys and water effects and mists rising from it. It looks entirely artificial, like something out of a fairy tale, just like the name of the house, something far removed from the real world.\n\nThe name Xanadu is that of Kubla Khan’s pleasure dome in a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, where it represents a fantastical and unreal world. This is Kane’s pleasure dome, but he is not having much fun there. This is despite all the absurdly extravagant luxuries that he owns, including items “enough for ten museums, the loot of the world”. There is even a zoo there.\n\nInside the house its lonely resident reaches for a snow globe. Indeed it seems as if he is trapped inside a snow globe himself, kept in an artificial enclosure away from the world. Snow from the globe seems to fall inside the room. A nurse enters the room, and is viewed through a fish-eye lens, like the curvature of the snow globe. The globe hints at the memory of something happy, but now lost. “Rosebud!” whispers the dying man.\n\nThis sets the scene for what follows, the mystery of Kane’s dying word. It will be investigated by Jerry Thompson (William Alland), a reporter who is literally faceless. We never see him from the front, and he is merely the anonymous drone investigating the life of a great man. He recalls Shakespeare’s words, “What the great ones do, the less will prattle of”.\n\nBut first we see the media coverage of Kane’s death, reported in every language in every newspaper in the world. Charles Foster Kane, the newspaper tycoon with a huge empire of media outlets, a man who attacked businesses and was called communist, and who threatened the rights of the working man and was called fascist.\n\nSuch is the public face of Charles Foster Kane, but the private man remains an enigma. Thompson wishes to focus on one riddle alone. Who or what is Rosebud? A woman? A racehorse? Thompson sets out to interview all the people who were closest to Kane in order to find out, but can one word really offer the key to the personality of the dead tycoon?\n\nWelles takes us through the empty imposing rooms that contain the archives of Walter Parks Thatcher (George Colouris), Kane’s first legal guardian. The film then moves onto a rest home where a former friend of Kane’s is residing, on into the dives of New York to meet Kane’s second wife, and finally we return to Xanadu again.\n\nWith hindsight, we might feel that Thompson came closest to solving the mystery of Rosebud at the beginning of the film when he learns the story of Kane’s early childhood. Still a young boy at this point, Charlie (played here by Buddy Swan) is happily playing in the snow on his sled. However money is about to change this.\n\nThanks to a mining deed, the young boy is now rich. Thatcher takes Charlie away from his parents and becomes his legal guardian, despite resistance from the boy. Charlie’s mother (Agnes Moorhead) says she has had Charlie’s trunk packed for weeks. Lest we think this is too cold, we learn that she is protecting the boy from his abusive father.\n\nWe see a brief glimpse of sour-faced Charlie celebrating a birthday surrounded by towering men, and realise how unhappy the rest of his childhood must have been. Thatcher brought wealth, but no love.\n\nNext we see Kane as a young adult. His attitude is reminiscent of Welles himself at this time, youthful, sardonic, working within the establishment but also defiant of its strictures. Kane refuses the chance to look after wealthy mines, deciding it would be fun to run a newspaper. Before long he is outraging the old fossil who serves as editor, and running articles attacking his old guardian. “I always gagged on the silver spoon,” Kane comments drily.\n\nKane’s approach is a curious mixture of idealistic crusading and cynical yellow journalism. He is more interested in sensationalist trash than in honest journalism, and yet he makes a declaration of his ideals. Meanwhile he establishes his own name with a display of showmanship and self-aggrandisement. Not unlike the film career of Welles.\n\nMuch of what follows comes from the words of Jebediah Leyland (Joseph Cotten), a journalist and onetime friend, who now loathes Kane, and offers an entirely slanted and bitter attack on the man he once loved. We must be careful how much of this we take literally. Leyland sees himself as a stooge, and thinks that Kane never loved anyone but himself.\n\nThere seems to be some truth in Leyland’s description, backed up by the account of Kane’s second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now a washed-up drunk. Kane’s first marriage to Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick) was a marriage of convenience to launch Kane’s career. When someone comments that another man happens to be the American president, and not Kane, he boasts, “That’s a mistake that will be corrected one of these days”.\n\nIn fact Kane’s political career, like so much else in his life, ends in failure. Welles condenses 16 years into a two-minute montage that captures the disintegration of Kane’s first marriage via a series of exchanges over the dinner table in which husband and wife exchange polite but barbed remarks with one another.\n\nHowever the turning point is when Kane begins an affair with a singer called Susan Alexander. Soon he falls a victim to the kind of yellow journalism he has promoted all his life, his political career destroyed by his own kind of fighting. Yet he does agree to stay with his new lover instead of his wife. Has he found a nurturing relationship at last?\n\nKane’s second marriage is more poignant than his first, since it begins happily and breaks down tragically. Susan seems like a bright and bubbly companion who is good for the pompous Kane. She is giggly when she first sees him covered in mud that was splashed on him by a passing carriage. He in turn keeps her entertained with magic tricks. (Here is another parallel between Welles and Kane, since Welles also fancied himself as a magician.)\n\nUnfortunately Kane becomes preoccupied with trying to establish Susan as a famous opera singer, even though her vocal range is not good enough for that. He ignores all the warnings, including her own. Welles presents the failure of Susan’s singing career in savagely humorous terms. A bored critic tears his programme into strips. Her teacher frantically gestures from within the wings. The camera rises to show two stage hands overhead, one of whom holds his nose.\n\nAfter Susan overdoses, Kane stops trying to promote her career, but the marriage has soured. The cheerful young mistress has become a shrill, drunken harpy of a wife. The last stage of their marriage takes place in Xanadu, the obscenely wealthy estate that Kane has built after he became disillusioned by political failure and the shrinkage of his media empire.\n\nHere the unhappy couple inhabit their vast house in which their conversation comes back to them in cavernous echoes. The rooms are so big that the Kanes are frequently sat at a long distance from one another, reflecting the state of their marriage. They often have to repeat themselves as the other person cannot hear them from across that distance.\n\nThere are parties, and a picnic, but even that is not an intimate affair, and ends in a convoy of cars and music performers. Most of the time the only company the couple entertains are the large array of statues that Kane collects. “You never give me anything I really care about,” Susan tells him.\n\nFinally we get to the heart of the mystery (perhaps), and the audience are treated to a sight that Thompson never gets to see. Thompson and a number of visitors wander around the vast piles of Kane’s possessions, the large collection of material goods that were never a substitution for happiness, and which Kane must leave behind him in death. They philosophise on what it all means, but an answer of sorts is in the room with them, lost under the vast pile of goods.\n\nAs the staff gather up the valuable items and throw the worthless ones into an incinerator, they pick up the sled that Charles Foster Kane played with when he was a child. As the sled burns slowly burns in the incinerator, a camera close-up shows us that the name on the side of the sled was Rosebud.\n\nI don’t think I am giving too much away in revealing the ending of Citizen Kane, as it is justly famous. It is also disliked by some. Welles himself dismissed it as ‘dollar-book Freud’, and some critics feel it is a trite conclusion. Personally I think the problem is one of over-familiarity. The ending is so well-known that it has become a cliché, and that has led to a reaction against it which is undeserved.\n\nDoes it mean anything? Some cynics like to remind us that Rosebud is the nickname that William Randolph Hearst is said to have given to his mistress’s vagina, and I would not put it past Welles to have chosen that particular word as a joke. Still that is not the meaning with which the film has invested the word.\n\nRosebud is a symbol of all that Kane lost, beginning with a happy, innocent childhood corrupted by wealth. Did Kane ever enjoy a truly happy moment after he became wealthy? He never had a chance to live his own life, even if it seemed as if he was making choices. He was a victim of his own fortune. Early in the film, Kane remarks, “If I hadn’t been rich, I might have been a great man”.\n\nIn the eyes of the world of course, Kane was a great man who built a huge media empire. Welles shows us the futility and hollowness of success and greatness. The people who knew him see his life in terms of loss, rather than achievement:\n\nMr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn’t get, or something he lost.\n\nMr Kane was a man who lost almost everything he had.\n\nAll he really wanted out of life was love. That’s Charlie’s story – it’s the story of how he lost it.\n\nIt is hardly surprising that his life ends in Xanadu, “the costliest monument a man has built to himself”. Kane became so disappointed with the real world that he built his own world. However it was left unfinished, and already decaying by the time of his death. In a curious way, he ultimately seems more of a pathetic than a monstrous figure.\n\nStill Welles does not wish us to see Rosebud as the final key to the personality of Charles Foster Kane. It is merely an important facet. Ultimately Kane remains a mystery. Even Kane’s butler Raymond (Paul Stewart), a man who is supposed to all of Kane’s secrets, turns out to be less knowledgeable than his supreme self-confidence would suggest.\n\nWas Kane a Fascist or a Communist? Was he incapable of love or only incapable of expressing it healthily? Why does he finish Leland’s scathing review of Susan Alexander’s singing? Is he showing off and being self-righteous, or is he trying to be honest and integrous? Was he a disillusioned idealist or a cynical purveyor of journalistic trash?\n\nWe can never be sure, so I will leave the last words to Thompson: “I don’t think any word explains a man’s life. No – I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle – a missing piece.” It is not missing to us, but perhaps other pieces are missing instead."
