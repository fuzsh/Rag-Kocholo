        "text": "The early sound film and \"classical-style\" Hollywood film periods were important representatives in the history of Hollywood films, producing many classic films as well as many famous film music composers. Among them, Bernard Herrmann was a unique and distinctive representative with his own personal compositional style, and was also the representative composer for thriller, horror, mystery and science fiction films during this period. When analyzing film music, especially Bernard Herrmann's works, using tonal music analysis, many harmonic progressions cannot be accurately expressed. Harmonic function analysis emphasizes the principles of tonality, while neo-Riemannian theory breaks away from the framework of tonality and harmonic functions, emphasizing the spatial progression between chords. For Bernard Herrmann's music, using neo-Riemannian theory can reasonably analyze the characteristics and patterns of musical progression, and explain many chord progressions that harmonic functions cannot. One of the films that can be given as an example of this situation is The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). The Day the Earth Stood Still is a Hollywood science fiction film made in 1951. This work played an important role in the development of later science fiction films. Bernard Herrmann chose to abandon the traditional orchestral instrumentation and used a specific instrumental ensemble to form Herrmann's unique science fiction film music space. Transformational analysis shows that the music uses modes, hexatonic scales and octatonic scales to form melodies and harmonies with ambiguous characteristics, and the use of these modes and scales also provides important color elements for film music of specific styles. Neo-Riemannian theory has been around for less than 50 years. As an emerging music theory system, it is not yet mature and complete, and is still expanding and improving. However, as an analysis tool for nonfunctional tonal film music, it can provide a brand new perspective. This researcher also believes that neo-Riemannian theory can provide theoretical basis for analyzing various styles of film music as an analytical tool.\n\nAlthough Charles Ives is rarely considered a major influence on movie scoring, the composer Bernard Herrmann, in both his film scores and his symphonic compositions, drew on Ives' techniques and his broader aesthetic. However, Herrmann did so sparingly incorporating only one or two of Ives' techniques in a symphonic work or film score. The result is a fusion of Ivesian modernism with Herrmann's own neo-Romantic idiom; a contribution to film music that has been almost completely overlooked. Herrmann's cantata Moby Dick, dedicated to Ives, is discussed along with his film scores, The Devil and Daniel Webster (dir. William Dieterle) and Hangover square (dir. John Brahm), in order to explore the impact of the older composer. The psychological hallmarks of Herrmann's film scores, shocking orchestral colors, unresolved chromaticisms, and ostinatos, are also significant characteristics of Ives' music. Herrmann's use of these practices, refined in his later, more famous scores as well, profoundly influenced future film composers and thus the development of music for cinema.\n\n\"One of the defining characteristics of Bernard Herrmann’s film music is its modular construction: his cues are typically assembled from short blocks of musical material rather than extended melodic lines. While this feature of his style has been much discussed in general terms, there have been few attempts to identify specifically how these blocks are constructed and how they are chained together to yield coherent musical statements. Using examples from Psycho, Marnie, and other Herrmann scores, I will demonstrate that the phrase structure and melodic trajectory of much of Herrmann’s music is based on a small set of frequently recurring prototypes. This structural consistency contributes to making the “Herrmann sound” instantly recognizable.\"\n\nThis expository paper examines the evolution of Arnold Schönberg’s music at the turn of the century; from his increasing use of chromaticism and free atonality, and his experimentation with novel tones and textures, to his development of the twelve tone or dodecaphonic method in music composition; the Second Viennese School. The twelve tone technique is demonstrated with the Suite for Piano, Op. 25; Schönberg’s first published work using the method. The initial reactions of audiences to performances of Schönberg’s work were either wonder, horror, or both. Even today, there is a widespread acknowledgement that works which evolved out of this School, referred to as Serialism, are perplexing, difficult to digest, somewhat esoteric and musically elitist. Contrary to this popular belief, this new music system has established itself in an arena of popular culture which is readily consumed by the masses. In the same way that its predecessors of the First Viennese School (Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven) were intimately linked to the opera, works developed out of techniques of the Second Viennese School (Schönberg, Webern, Berg) have found a niche in the film industry and are infused in popular movie and television sound tracks to lend dramatic effect, engage audiences, support imagery and convey a wide range of emotion and atmosphere. Specific examples of twelve tone compositions in film scores are identified in the works of Bradley, Frankel and Goldsmith, renowned film composers, and briefly analysed.\n\nSergei Prokofiev was one of a few composers who worked equally successfully in the fields of film music and art music. His scores for Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible are as significant for the history of film music as are his operas and ballets for musical theater. He approached film projects with the same creative rigor as his stage and symphonic works. And so we must think of his film scores not as a separate enterprise but, rather, as one of the various theatrical and dramatic genres at which he tried his hand. While the operatic features of his music for Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible have become widely recognized, Prokofiev’s other film scores can also be placed in a broader context of the composer’s output. The cross-connections between genres can be traced at different levels, from common themes and literary ideas and similar stylistic evolution, to shared compositional techniques and borrowings of musical material from one work to another.\n\nThis paper, takes three pieces of music in the film score work Mysterious Island by film music composer Bernard Herrmann (1911-1975) as the analysis object. Bernard Herrmann's composition techniques are very innovative, and even difficult to interpret harmonic design when analyzing his works with tonal music. The Neo-Riemannian theory formed in the 1980s is used to analyze the chord progression that cannot be accurately explained by tonal music analysis in Bernard Herrmann's film score, and to prove the Neo-Riemannian theory by marking the transformation methods used and deriving the evolution process of harmony Neo-Riemannian theory's rationality and superiority in analyzing film music. This study hopes to use the Neo-Riemannian theory to provide a new perspective for exploring the development of film musicology."
