More significantly, this network comprises an integrated array of bases, testing and training facilities, ranges, and airspace that operate within a physical environment that is uniquely suited to their individual and combined mission objectives and to the nation’s evolving defense posture. In short, Arizona provides DoD with unparalleled opportunities.",

        "text": "Purpose\n\nThe Military Installation Fund (MIF) was established to allocate monies as stipulated by ARS §26-262 in order to acquire private property, real estate, rights to real estate, property management, and infrastructure that is vital to the preservation of a military installation. Eighty (80) percent of fund awards shall be distributed as listed above, and specifically for purchase of, and projects on, private property owners, with the remaining twenty (20) percent awarded to cities, towns and counties for property enhancements, capital and infrastructure improvement projects, renovations, and management of property that is considered critical to the continued success of military installations.\n\n*The Military Installation Fund is not accepting applications at this time.\n\nIntroduction\n\nArizona’s military facilities and operations should be treated as an industry that is a cornerstone of the state economy. The 2008 Maguire study on the Economic Impact of Arizona’s Principal Military Operations states that total employment impact equaled 96,328 jobs and the total economic output for Arizona’s military industry is over $9.12 billion for Tax Year 2008. The stable nature and high-pay-scale value of military jobs make them a fundamentally critical to the state economy. Recognizing the military industry as a separate economic cluster in Arizona is critical to the efforts to educate the public about its importance to the fiscal health of Arizona.\n\nArizona has provided tools to local jurisdictions to support the long-term mission sustainability and economic health of military facilities. Cities, counties, and towns should consider the following innovative approaches to preserve residential quality of life and ensure compatible land uses:\n\nWork with active military airports to establish noise and impact contours, as well as expanded approach/departure corridors;\n\nUtilize the Graduated Development Concept to graduate densities away from the high-noise contour areas and APZs;\n\nIncentivize developers to reduce intensity and density in areas that are mission critical;\n\nPurchase lands around military facilities that are most affected by safety and noise considerations and leasing them back to farmers for agricultural use; and\n\nEstablish relationships with existing military facilities in order to raise awareness of environmental and growth issues, while minimizing impact to residents.\n\nIn addition to these tools, the State of Arizona also created the Military Installation Fund.\n\nBackground\n\nIn December 2003, the Governor’s Military Facilities Task Force recommended twenty-seven actions to ensure the long-term retention and health of Arizona’s military installations and facilities – one of which was the Military Installation Fund. Receiving the first state appropriation in 2004, the core mission of the Military Installation Fund is to initiate projects and/or acquire lands and property directly impacted by the function of Arizona’s military installations in an effort to preserve the operational jurisdiction of the facility and protect residents from encroachment and negative environmental impacts.\n\nThe stability of employment and tax revenues produced by the Arizona military industry is indispensable to the fiscal health of the state. The long-term retention of Arizona’s network of military facilities and the sustainability of their missions are thus vital to the security of the nation and the strength of the state economy. Through the operation of the Military Installation Fund, Arizona is working to protect the equilibrium between military operational mission success, local economic health, and residential protection.\n\n*The Military Installation Fund is not accepting applications at this time.\n\nClick here to view the results of the 2015 Round of the Military Installation Fund.\n\nArizona is home to several United States military airports and installations including Luke Air Force Base, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Yuma Proving Grounds and Yuma Marine Air Corps Station, Fort Huachuca, and the Barry M. Goldwater Range Complex in southwestern Arizona as well as several auxiliary fields. As issues of growth and development have moved to the forefront in many parts of Arizona, the bases and jurisdictions in which they are located are playing key roles in the dialogue. Each military facility in Arizona has a mission to carry out in support of the nation’s defense. However, the sustainability of the installation to carry out its mission depends not only on the ability to maintain its own capabilities, but also on its linkages with a network of other facilities and installations in the state. Arizona has endeavored to provide the tools to address land use conflicts that might impact the ability of each base to conduct its mission.\n\nThe Arizona Military Regional Compatibility Project was conceived as a proactive endeavor to convene the stakeholders around each installation – the relevant jurisdictions, base personnel, landowners, and other interested parties – to address land use compatibility issues. The Compatibility Project is the result of legislation passed in 2001 (Senate Bill 1120) that appropriated funds to develop comprehensive land use plans in the noise and accident potential zones surrounding active military airports. The project has grown now to include support and funding from the United States Department of Defense, Office of Economic Adjustment.\n\nThe Arizona Military Regional Compatibility Project Policy Guidebook can be downloaded here.\n\nCompleted Joint Land Use Studies:\n\nLuke Air Force Base/Western Maricopa County Joint Land Use Study – 2003\n\nLuke Air Force Base – Luke Auxiliary Field #1 Joint Land Use Study – 2004\n\nLuke Air Force Base – Barry M. Goldwater Range / Gila Bend Auxiliary Field Joint Land Use Study – 2005\n\nDavis-Monthan Air Force Base Joint Land Use Study – 2004\n\nMarine Corps Air Station – Yuma Joint Land Use Plan – 2005\n\nFort Huachuca Joint Land Use Study – 2007\n\nPinal County (incorporating four Arizona Army National Guard locations: Florence Military Reservation, Rittenhouse Training Site, Silverbell Army Heliport, and Picacho Peak Stagefield)\n\nCoconino County (incorporating the U.S. Naval Observatory – Flagstaff Station and Arizona Army National Guard’s Camp Navajo)\n\nMilitary and Restricted Airspace Maps\n\nInformation on territory located within the vicinity of a military airport can be found at the Arizona Department of Real Estate.\n\nOther initiatives related to Arizona military facilities:\n\nSenate Bill 1525 – This legislation was passed in 2001 to provide for open and effective communication between military bases, jurisdictions, developers, and the public so that safe and responsible planning could occur on lands in the vicinity of active military airports. Key provisions of the bill include enhanced notification and disclosure requirements for rezonings or new development proposals; noise attenuation requirements within noise contours; and definitions of High Noise and Accident Potential Zones.

Released in May 2002, the study concluded that the military industry’s economic and fiscal impacts are substantial and represent a key component of the state’s economy. The State of Arizona sponsored the updating of the report in 2008 and 2017. Click here to download the latest Military Economic Impact Study.\n\nSenate Bill 1393 – This bill was signed by Governor Jane Dee Hull in May 2002. This bill requires school districts in certain areas to adopt and enforce school district development plans for property that is located in High Noise or Accident Potential Zones of a military airport.
