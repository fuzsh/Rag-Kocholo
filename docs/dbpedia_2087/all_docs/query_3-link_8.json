        "text": "Seven states had claims to the region. Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia had early colonial charters from England granting them title to the lands beyond the Appalachians. New York's claim resulted from concessions by the Iroquois Indians. The remaining states had no claims to the area.\n\nFor states without land claims, like Maryland, the disposition of western lands was of major importance. They needed land to reward the soldiers who served in their regiments against the British. Maryland also feared that if Virginia and the other land-claim states took title to lands in the trans-Appalachian West, they would dominate the nation economically and politically. Maryland demanded that the land-claim states relinquish their title to the central government and vowed not to sign the Articles of Confederation until that was done.\n\nThe land-claim states resisted Maryland's demand at first. Virginia, Maryland's chief antagonist, declared that the central government had no claim to the western lands. The resolve of Virginia and the other land-claim states, however, weakened as they realized the importance of having Maryland in the union and recognized that their conflicting claims to the western lands could threaten their relations with each another. New York in 1780 took the first step toward compromise by offering to cede its claim to lands beyond the Appalachians to the central government. Maryland reciprocated by signing the Articles of Confederation.\n\nThe United States accepted New York's cession in 1781. Three years later, Virginia ceded its interests to the territory north of the Ohio River. Then came the cessions of Massachusetts (1785), Connecticut (1786), South Carolina (1787), North Carolina (1790), and Georgia (1802).\n\nNot all the western lands were ceded. Virginia had granted much of Kentucky to soldiers and other interests during the Revolution and so retained this area. Tennessee, carved from North Carolina, was also withheld from the public domain for much the same reason.\n\nThere are several good general public land history overviews. Benjamin Hibbard's A History of the Public Land Policies (1924) is quite helpful in sorting out the numerous land laws and their requirements. The Lure of the Land: A Social History of the Public Lands from the Articles of Confederation to the New Deal (1970) by Everett Dick is written for general readers, as is Roy M. Robbins', Our Landed Heritage: The Public Domain, 1776-1970 (Revised edition, 1976). The authoritative History of Public Land Law Development (1968) written by Paul Gates is mandatory reading for anyone truly interested in the history of public land policy.\n\nFor books with readings on various aspects of public land policy, see The Public Lands: Studies in the History of the Public Domain (1962) edited by Vernon Carstensen and Paul Gates, ed., Public Land Policies: Management and Disposal (1979).\n\nOn the early aspects of public land policy, Malcolm J. Rohrbough's The Land Office Business: The Settlement and Administration of American Public Lands, 1789-1837 (1968) is outstanding. On military land bounties, see Jerry O'Callaghan's, \"The War Veteran and the Public Lands,\" in The Public Lands: Studies in the History of the Public Domain (1962), edited by Vernon Carstensen.\n\nOn the General Land Office and its operation, see Malcolm Rohrbough's, \"The General Land Office, 1812-1826: An Administrative Study,\" Ph.D. dissertation, University of Wisconsin, 1963; F. H. White's, \"The Administration of the General Land Office, 1812-1911,\" Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 1912 and Milton Conover's, The General Land Office: Its History, Activities and Organization (1923).\n\nClosely intertwined with public land questions has been the federal government's policy toward Native American possession of land. Francis Paul Prucha's two volume The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians (1984) is a comprehensive look at federal Indian policy.\n\nThe process of surveying the public lands is a subject of interest to many. For an instruction to the subject, readers should refer to Joseph Ernst's, With Compass and Chain (1979); Lola Cazier's, Surveys and Surveyors of the Public Domain, 1785-1975 (ca. 1975); and C. Albert White's, A History of the Rectangular Survey System (1982). The impact of the rectangular survey system on the environment is well addressed by Hildegard Binder Johnson in Order Upon the Land: The U.S. Rectangular Land Survey and the Upper Mississippi Country (1976).\n\nThe federal government's grants of land to the states was an important feature of public land policy. Of interest here is Matthais Orfield's, Federal Land Grants to the States with Special Reference to Minnesota (1915).\n\nGrants of public lands for the construction of railroads is a topic that has attracted the attention of numerous historians. A few of the works available are Carter Goodrich's, Government Promotion of American Canals and Railroads, 1800-1890 (1960); Thomas E. Root's, Railroad Land Grants from Canals to Transcontinentals (1986); William S. Greever's, Arid Domain: The Santa Fe Railway and Its Western Land Grant (1954); and Ross Cotroneo's, The History of the Northern Pacific Land Grant, 1900-1952 (1979).\n\nPrivate land claims and grants have not received the attention they deserve. Claims that are a consequence of early land acquisitions of the United States' are discussed by Paul Gates' \"Private Land Claims in the South,\" in Public Land Policies: Management and Disposal (1979) edited by Paul Gates. Mexican and Spanish grants in New Mexico are taken up by Victor Westphall in Mercedes Reales: Hispanic Land Grants of the Upper Rio Grande Region (1983).\n\nThe settlement laws and their operation in the later half of the nineteenth century are discussed in numerous books and articles. Those interested in this subject might consider starting with \"The Homestead Law in an Incongruous Land System\" by Paul Gates in The Public Lands: Studies in the History of the Public Domain (1962) edited by Vernon Carstensen. Also good is John T. Ganoe's, \"The Desert Land Act in Operation, 1877-1891,\" in Public Land Policies: Management and Disposal (1979) edited by Paul Gates. Harold Durham's Government Handout: A Study in the Administration of the Public Lands, 1875-1891 (1970) is indispensable to serious students of public land policy. For homesteading after 1900, see Mary W. M. Hargreaves', Dry Farming in the Northern Great Plains, 1900-1925 (1957); Paula M. Nelson's, After the West was Won: Homesteaders and Town-Builders in Western South Dakota, 1900-1917 (1986); and Barbara Allen's, Homesteading the High Desert (1987).\n\nFew histories have been written on the administration and disposition of the public domain within their borders. Some of those that have been written are Paul Gates' Fifty Million Acres: Conflicts Over Kansas Land Policy, 1854-1890 (1954); The Public Domain in New Mexico, 1854-1891 (1965) by Victor Westphall; Stephen Strausberg's, Federal Stewardship on the (Indiana) Frontier (1979); and The Disposition of the Public Domain in Oregon (1979) by Jerry O'Callaghan.\n\nMineral policy is discussed by Robert W. Swenson in \"Legal Aspects of Mineral Resources Exploitation\" in Paul Gates' History of Public Land Law Development (1968), and in Public DomainPrivate Dominion: A History of Public Mineral Policy in America (1985) by Carl Mayer and George Riley. Petroleum policy is taken up by John Ise in The United States Oil Policy (1926). On early federal government geological investigations and the U.S. Geological Survey, see Richard A. Bartlett's, Great Surveys of the American West (1953); Wallace Stegner's, Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West (1954); and Mary C. Rabbitt's, Minerals, Lands, and Geology for the Common Defense and General Welfare: A History...of the U.S. Geological Survey, Before 1879-1939, 3 vols. (1979, 1980, 1986).\n\nIrrigation and water in the West are addressed by Donald Worester's, Rivers of Empire: Water, Aridity and the Growth of the American West (1986); Donald J. Pisani's, From the Family Farm to Agribusiness: The Irrigation Crusade in California and the West, 1850-1931 (1984); and Michael C. Robinson's, Water for the West: The Bureau of Reclamation, 1902-1977 (1979).\n\nOn timber and forestry in general, refer to the work of Thomas Cox, Robert Maxwell, P. D. Thomas, and Joseph Malone, in This Well-Wooded Land: Americans and Their Forests from Colonial Times to the Present (1985). On the development of national forest policy, see Samuel T. Dana's, Forest and Range Policy: Its Development in the United States (1956), and Harold Steen's, The U.S. Forest Service: A History (1976). The O&C revested lands are discussed in Elmo Richardson's BLM's Billion-Dollar Checkerboard: Managing the O&C Lands (1980) and the The O&C Lands (1981) by the University of Oregon's Bureau of Governmental Research and Service.\n\nThe national park system is well-documented by Alfred Runte in his National Parks: The American Experience (1979).\n\nSome books on conservation policy are Samuel Hays', Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progress Conservation Movement, 1890-1920 (1959); Elmo Richardson's, The Politics of Conservation: Crusades and Controversies, 1897-1913 (1962); E. Louise Peffer's, The Closing of the Public Domain: Disposal and Reservation Policies, 1900-50 (1951); Donald Swain's, Federal Conservation Policy, 1921-1933 (1963); and A.L. Riesch Owen, Conservation Under FDR (1983).\n\nGrazing of the public domain has received much attention from historians and other writers, particular reference should be made to George Rollins', The Struggle of the Cattleman, Sheepman, and Settler for Control of Lands in Wyoming, 1867-1910 (1979); E. Louise Peffer's, The Closing of the Public Domain: Disposal and Reservation Policies, 1900-50 (1951); William Voigt, Jr.'s, Public Grazing Lands: Use and Misuse by Industry and Government (1976); Philip O. Foss', Politics and Grass: The Administration of Grazing on the Public Domain (1960). A history of the Grazing Service is much needed but see Farrington R. Carpenter's, Confessional of a Maverick: An Autobiography (1984), and Marvin Klemme's reminiscence about his time with the agency in Home Rule on the Range: Early Days of the Grazing Service (1984).\n\nPublic land policy toward Alaska has been largely ignored by historians. For some background, see Ernest Gruening's, State of Alaska (1958); William Hunt's, Alaska: A Bicentennial History (1976); and Melody Webb's, The Last Frontier: A History of the Yukon Basin of Canada (1985)."
