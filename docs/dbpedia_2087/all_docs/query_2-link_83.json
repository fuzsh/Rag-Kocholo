        "text": "I am a United States Sailor.\n\nI will support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America\n\nand I will obey the orders of those appointed over me.\n\nI represent the fighting spirit of the Navy and those who have gone before me\n\nto defend freedom and democracy around the world.\n\nI proudly serve my country's Navy combat team with Honor, Courage and Commitment.\n\nI am committed to excellence and the fair treatment of all.\n\nWritten standards, or codes, are intrinsic to maintaining discipline throughout the Navy. Some, such as the Code of Conduct for Members of the Armed Forces of the United States, apply to all members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Other codes are specific to the Navy, such as The Sailor’s Creed ─ which focuses on self-respect, respect for others, and core values of honor, courage, and commitment. The Sailor’s Creed governs virtually all aspects of a Sailor’s existence while in the Navy. It is a staple of Navy culture, often recited like a pledge of allegiance, reminding all service members of whom they are, and why they serve.\n\nThe Sailor’s Creed was written by a Blue Ribbon Recruit Training Panel in 1993 at the direction of Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Frank Kelso, who personally participated in the final edit of the working group’s proposal. Admiral Kelso then directed that every recruit be given a copy and be required to commit it to memory.\n\nIn 1994, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jeremy Boorda approved a minor change to make the creed more inclusive of all hands by replacing the word “bluejacket” with “Navy,” which describes the lowest enlisted rate, E-1, through the highest officer rank, O-10. After 1997, the words “my superiors” were replaced with “those appointed over me.” Today, The Sailor’s Creed is memorized by all personnel in boot camp and has been incorporated into officer training as well. The Chief Petty Officer pinning ceremony includes both the Chief Petty Officer’s Creed and The Sailor’s Creed.\n\nAll personnel in the uniform of naval service are Sailors first, and in addition they are officers, chiefs, petty officers, aviators, Seabees, surface warriors, and submariners. This is an important point impacting unity and esprit de corps.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThe Sailors Creed\n\nEthos, Sailor's Creed Inspired Community Outreach Project\n\nUSS Constitution Sailors Teach Naval History at TSC\n\n(Information from The Presbyterian Hymnal Companion\n\nby LindaJo H. McKim, Westminster/John Knox Press, Louisville, Ky. 1993)\n\nThe \"Navy Hymn\" is Eternal Father, Strong to Save. The original words were written as a poem in 1860 by William Whiting of Winchester, England, for a student who was about to sail for the United States. The melody, published in 1861, was composed by fellow Englishman, Rev. John Bacchus Dykes, an Episcopalian clergyman.\n\nThe hymn, found in most hymnals, is known as the \"Navy hymn\" because it is sung at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. It is also sung on ships of the Royal Navy (U.K.) and has been translated into French.\n\nEternal Father was the favorite hymn of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and was sung at his funeral in Hyde Park, New York, in April 1945. It was also played by the Navy Band in 1963 as President John F. Kennedy's body was carried up the steps of the U.S. Capitol to lie in state. Roosevelt had served as Secretary of the Navy and Kennedy was a PT boat commander in World War II.\n\nThe original words are:\n\nVerse 1: Eternal Father, strong to save,\n\nWhose arm hath bound the restless wave,\n\nWho bidd'st the mighty ocean deep\n\nIts own appointed limits keep;\n\nOh, hear us when we cry to Thee,\n\nFor those in peril on the sea!\n\nVerse 2: O Christ! Whose voice the waters heard\n\nAnd hushed their raging at Thy word,\n\nWho walked'st on the foaming deep,\n\nAnd calm amidst its rage didst sleep;\n\nOh, hear us when we cry to Thee,\n\nFor those in peril on the sea!\n\nVerse 3: Most Holy Spirit! Who didst brood\n\nUpon the chaos dark and rude,\n\nAnd bid its angry tumult cease,\n\nAnd give, for wild confusion, peace;\n\nOh, hear us when we cry to Thee,\n\nFor those in peril on the sea!\n\nVerse 4: O Trinity of love and power!\n\nOur brethren shield in danger's hour;\n\nFrom rock and tempest, fire and foe,\n\nProtect them wheresoe'er they go;\n\nThus evermore shall rise to Thee\n\nGlad hymns of praise from land and sea.\n\nThere are have been alternate verses. These and their authors are:\n\nLord, guard and guide the men who fly\n\nThrough the great spaces in the sky.\n\nBe with them always in the air,\n\nIn darkening storms or sunlight fair;\n\nOh, hear us when we lift our prayer,\n\nFor those in peril in the air!\n\nMary C. D. Hamilton (1915)\n\nOh, Watchful Father who dost keep\n\nEternal vigil while we sleep\n\nGuide those who navigate on high\n\nWho through grave unknown perils fly,\n\nReceive our oft-repeated prayer\n\nFor those in peril in the air.\n\nEmma Mayhew Whiting (1943)\n\nEternal Father, grant, we pray,\n\nTo all Marines, both night and day,\n\nThe courage, honor, strength, and skill\n\nTheir land to serve, thy law fulfill;\n\nBe thou the shield forevermore\n\nFrom every peril to the Corps.\n\nJ. E. Seim (1966)\n\nLord, stand beside the men who build,\n\nAnd give them courage, strength, and skill.\n\nO grant them peace of heart and mind,\n\nAnd comfort loved ones left behind.\n\nLord, hear our prayers for all Seabees,\n\nWhere'er they be on land or sea.\n\nR. J. Dietrich (1960)\n\nLord God, our power evermore,\n\nWhose arm doth reach the ocean floor,\n\nDive with our men beneath the sea;\n\nTraverse the depths protectively.\n\nO hear us when we pray, and keep\n\nThem safe from peril in the deep.\n\nDavid B. Miller (1965)\n\nO God, protect the women who,\n\nIn service, faith in thee renew;\n\nO guide devoted hands of skill\n\nAnd bless their work within thy will;\n\nInspire their lives that they may be\n\nExamples fair on land and sea.\n\nLines 1-4, Merle E. Strickland (1972) and\n\nadapted by James D. Shannon (1973)\n\nLines 5-6, Beatrice M. Truitt (1948)\n\nCreator, Father, who dost show\n\nThy splendor in the ice and snow,\n\nBless those who toil in summer light\n\nAnd through the cold antarctic night,\n\nAs they thy frozen wonders learn;\n\nBless those who wait for their return.\n\nL. E. Vogel (1965)\n\nEternal Father, Lord of hosts,\n\nWatch o'er the men who guard our coasts.\n\nProtect them from the raging seas\n\nAnd give them light and life and peace.\n\nGrant them from thy great throne above\n\nThe shield and shelter of thy love.\n\nAuthor unknown\n\nEternal Father, King of birth,\n\nWho didst create the heaven and earth,\n\nAnd bid the planets and the sun\n\nTheir own appointed orbits run;\n\nO hear us when we seek thy grace\n\nFor those who soar through outer space.\n\nJ. E. Volonte (1961)\n\nCreator, Father, who first breathed\n\nIn us the life that we received,\n\nBy power of thy breath restore\n\nThe ill, and men with wounds of war.\n\nBless those who give their healing care,\n\nThat life and laughter all may share\n\n. Galen H. Meyer (1969)\n\nAdapted by James D. Shannon (1970)\n\nGod, Who dost still the restless foam,\n\nProtect the ones we love at home.\n\nProvide that they should always be\n\nBy thine own grace both safe and free.\n\nO Father, hear us when we pray\n\nFor those we love so far away.\n\nHugh Taylor (date Unk)\n\nLord, guard and guide the men who fly\n\nAnd those who on the ocean ply;\n\nBe with our troops upon the land,\n\nAnd all who for their country stand:\n\nBe with these guardians day and night\n\nAnd may their trust be in thy might.\n\nAuthor Unknown (1955)\n\nO Father, King of earth and sea,\n\nWe dedicate this ship to thee.\n\nIn faith we send her on her way;\n\nIn faith to thee we humbly pray:\n\nO hear from heaven our sailor's cry\n\nAnd watch and guard her from on high!\n\nAuthor/date Unknown\n\nAnd when at length her course is run,\n\nHer work for home and country done,\n\nOf all the souls that in her sailed\n\nLet not one life in thee have failed;\n\nBut hear from heaven our sailor's cry,\n\nAnd grant eternal life on high!\n\nAuthor/date Unknown\n\nWilliam Whiting (1825-1878) was born in Kensington, England, and educated at Chapham and Winchester. Because of his musical ability, he became master of Winchester College Choristers' School. While best known for Eternal Father, Whiting also published two poetry collections: Rural Thoughts (1851) and Edgar Thorpe, or the Warfare of Life (1867). He died at Winchester.\n\nJohn Bacchus Dykes (1823-1876) was born in Hull, England, and by age 10 was the assistant organist at St. John's Church, Hull, where his grandfather was vicar. He studied at Wakefield and St. Catherine's College, earning a B.A. in Classics in 1847. He cofounded the Cambridge University Musical Society. He was ordained as curate of Malton in 1847. For a short time, he was canon of Durham Cathedral, then precentor (1849-1862). In 1862 he became vicar of St. Oswald's, Durham. He published sermons and articles on religion but is best known for over 300 hymn tunes he composed. He died in Sussex at age 53.\n\nDuring the course of initiation, you have been caused to humbly accept challenge and face adversity. This you have accomplished with rare good grace. Pointless as some of these challenges may have seemed, there were valid, time-honored reasons behind each pointed barb.\n\nYour faith in the fellowship of Chief Petty Officers was necessary to overcome these hurdles. The goal was to instill in you that trust is inherent with the donning of the uniform of a Chief. Our intent was to impress upon you that challenge is good; a great and necessary reality which cannot mar you – which, in fact, strengthens you.\n\nIn your future as a Chief Petty Officer, you will be forced to endure adversity far beyond what has thus far been imposed upon you. You must face each challenge and adversity with the same dignity and good grace you have already demonstrated.\n\nBy experience, by performance, and by testing, you have been advanced to Chief Petty Officer. In the United States Navy – and only in the United States Navy – the rank of E7 carries with it unique responsibilities and privileges you are expected to fulfill and bound to observe.\n\nYour entire way of life is changed. More will be expected of you; more will be demanded of you. Not because you are an E7, but because you are now a Chief Petty Officer. You have not merely been promoted a paygrade, you have joined an exclusive fellowship and, as in all fellowships, you have a special responsibility to your comrades, even as they have a special responsibility to you. This is why we in the United States Navy may maintain with pride our feelings of accomplishment once we have attained the position of Chief Petty Officer.\n\nYour responsibilities and privileges do not appear in print. They have no official standing; they cannot be referred to by name, number, nor file. They have existed for over 100 years, because Chiefs before you have freely accepted responsibility beyond the call of printed assignment. Their actions and their performance demanded the respect of their seniors as well as their juniors.\n\nIt is required that you be the fountain of wisdom, the ambassador of good will, the authority in personal relations as well as in technical applications. “Ask the Chief” is a household phrase in and out of the Navy.\n\nYou are the Chief. The exalted position you have achieved — and the word exalted is used advisedly — exists because of the service, character, and performance of the Chiefs before you. It shall exist only as long as you and your fellow Chiefs maintain these standards.\n\nIt was our intention that you never forget this day. It was our intention to test you, to try you, and to accept you. Your performance has assured us that you will wear “the hat” with the same pride as your comrades in arms before you.\n\nWe take a deep and sincere pleasure in clasping your hand, and accepting you as a Chief Petty Officer in the United States Navy."
