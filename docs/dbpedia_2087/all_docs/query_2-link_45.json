The Department of Defense stewards approximately ten percent of Californiaâs land, military operations and personnel contribute billions of dollars to Californiaâs economy, and military bases and airspace provide an integrated network of training assets critical to our national security that cannot be replicated or replaced.\n\nOPR is working to improve communication and encourage collaboration between local governments and the US military on land use planning and development issues in California. The OPR Military Affairs Team works closely with all branches of the military on areas of mutual concern and priority including land use planning, regulatory activities by state agencies, and statewide energy policies.\n\nLand Use\n\nOPR works with active military installations and local communities in California to reduce potential land-use conflicts through early coordination and development notification. This function enables appropriate growth, local economic vitality, and public health and safety while safeguarding ongoing military training and military readiness. The Military Affairs Team develops partnerships and provide tools, staff support, mapping capability, and information to local governments to assist in development, adoption, and implementation of local polices and ordinances.\n\nIn addition to early coordination, and notification of proposed new development, OPR works with the Military and local land use agencies to incorporate provisions into city and county General Plans and implementing ordinances to establish project review and permitting procedures that foster land uses that are compatible with military operations.\n\nRegulatory Activities\n\nOPR and the military work cooperatively to ensure that active military installations are able to comply with state regulations, and that regulators understand the potential impacts of their actions on military activities. OPR also provides implementation support to regulatory agencies developing new programs or rules that might impact the military\n\nEnergy\n\nCalifornia Government Code section 65040.7 requires OPR to serve as a liaison to coordinate effective inclusion of the military in the development and implementation of state energy and environmental policy. OPR and other state agencies actively partner with the military to advance state energy and environmental policies, including the expansion of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects on land managed by the military. The program seeks to balance and integrate Californiaâs goals for renewable energy development and natural resources protection with the mission of the military in California.\n\nGovernor's Military Council\n\nThe Governorâs Military Council was created by California Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. on March 28, 2013. The Council was codified into law through 2021 with the signing of AB 442 (Irwin-2015) and extended through 2026 with AB 2192 (Irwin-2020). The current Chair of the Council is Vice Admiral Jody Breckenridge, USCG (ret.).\n\nThe California Governorâs Military Council â comprised of retired flag and general officers, civic leaders, bipartisan state legislators and senior policymakers â helps position California to maintain and grow military operations in the state, providing insight and recommendations to state leaders who are developing a strategy to support and grow military operations in the Golden State. As federal leaders consider cuts and realignment of federal military operations, the Council also articulates the unique military value of Californiaâs diverse network of installations, and of the Californians and businesses that support them. The Council also supports the efforts of local and regional organizations to improve partnerships with military installations in their communities. More information can be found on the Councilâs website: militarycouncil.ca.gov\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nCASCADE\n\nThe California Advanced Supply Chain Analysis and Diversification Effort (CASCADE) is an initiative funded by the U.S. Department of Defense to bolster California's defense supply chain cybersecurity resilience through technical assistance programs, and to support the growth and sustainment of California's Cybersecurity workforce through cybersecurity-related education curricula, training, and apprenticeship programs. Activities include: Guidance on Cyber Provider Services; Cybersecurity Resilience Workshops; Cybersecurity Baseline Compliance Evaluations, Implementation & Execution; Cybersecurity for Space Systems; Cyber Career Commercial Pathways; Defense Workforce Cybersecurity Skills Upgrading; Cybersecurity Internships/Externships with DoD SBIR/STTR Firms and Cybersecurity Apprenticeships and Job Placements.\n\nMore info on CASCADE\n\nCADENCE\n\nDesignated by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment as a Defense Manufacturing Community, the California Advanced Defense Ecosystems & National Consortia Effort (CADENCE) aims to strengthen the resiliency of the national security innovation and manufacturing base through technical and workforce development assistance to California suppliers in defense innovation and manufacturing who are involved in the advancement of specific national security key technologies or supply chains (KTS) including microelectronics, fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology, cyber, space, artificial intelligence, and fully networked command, control and communications (FNC3). By doing this, CADENCE aims to support critical manufacturing sectors that provide key resources to the American warfighter and to commercial innovation; address DoDâs modernization priorities, key policies, guidance and directives; and help maintain the national security manufacturing sector as one of the largest economic drivers in the State of California. CADENCE includes 15 project components executed by a consortium comprised of community, industry, non-profit, state agencies, and educational institutions.\n\nMore info on CADENCE\n\nCaMEO CAMP\n\nThe California Military Energy Opportunity Compatibility Assessment Mapping Project (CaMEO CAMP) is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense to promote compatible siting of renewable energy projects to prevent adverse impacts to DoDâs test, training and military operations and achieve shared state and federal goals. The CaMEO CAMP is being managed by the California Governorâs Office of Planning and Research, in collaboration with the California Energy Commission.\n\nThe overall goal of the CaMEO CAMP is to better understand the potential for renewable energy development and associated facilities within operational military influence areas in order to proactively define where appropriate early consultation with the Department of Defense (DoD) should occur, and also to enable that coordination through an easy to use process and tool.\n\nCaMEO CAMP\n\nNational Security Economic Impacts Study\n\nOPR and the Governorâs Military Council lead the California National Security Economic Impacts Study to develop more precise data on the scale of national security spending that impact California communities and industries. The goal of the study is to support communities that defense program changes impact by developing strategies for local communitiesâ adjustment and cooperation. The study aims to provide Federal, State, and local policy makers with the downscaled data they need to better integrate and coordinate defense spending and other Federal assistance programs to support their economic development efforts.. The California State Library California Research Bureau works with OPR and the Governorâs Military Council to complete the study.\n\n2023 California Statewide National Security Economic Impacts\n\nPast Studies\n\n2022\n\n2022 Statewide Report\n\n2021\n\n2021 Statewide Report\n\nCongressional Districts Supplement\n\nCongressional Districts Factsheets\n\nCongressional Districts Regional Factbooks\n\nCounty Supplement\n\nCounty Factsheets\n\nCounty Regional Factbooks\n\n2020\n\n2020 California Statewide National Security Economic Impacts\n\n2020 Counties Supplement California Statewide National Security Economic Impacts\n\n2020 County Factsheets\n\nInteractive data tool is available here: Tableau Economic Impacts Interactive Report Tool\n\nPast Projects\n\nSierra Army Depot Resilience Review Project\n\nThe Sierra Army Depot Resilience Review Project (SIAD RRP) was an initiative partially funded by the U.S. Department of Defense Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation (OLDCC) to protect and preserve military readiness and defense capabilities of the Sierra Army Depot (SIAD) while supporting continued economic development of the surrounding communities. The geography of Northern California enables SIADâs mission, makes SIAD a critical installation for the U.S. Army, and allows SIAD to provide unique support to Joint Force multi-domain operations. SIAD is also the main economic engine of the Lassen region. The Project supported installation sustainability at SIAD through investments in a series of technical assistance, research and analysis, collaborator engagement, and knowledge-sharing project components. Overall, the Project provided infrastructure owners and decision makers with a framework and collaborative approach to making decisions on the best means to implement activities that respond to threats to SIADâs resilience which can adversely affect the military installation and its operations supporting the National Defense Strategy.\n\nOPRâs Military Affairs Team\n\nRussell Fong\n\nChief Deputy Director\n\nrussell.fong@opr.ca.gov\n\nAllison Henderson\n\nPolicy Advisor, Governorâs Military Council\n\nAllison.Henderson@opr.ca.gov"
