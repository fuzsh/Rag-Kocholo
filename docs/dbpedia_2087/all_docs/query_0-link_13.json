Prior to 1818, pensions were restricted to officers, severely disabled veterans, and widows of men who died in the war. Unfortunately, nearly all of the earliest pension files were destroyed by fire.\n\nIn 1818, an act was passed granting service pensions to veterans who had served in the Continental Army or Navy for at least nine months. So many applications were filed that a new law was passed two years later, restricting pensions to those who could demonstrate financial need. Later, in 1832, benefits were extended to any veterans with at least six months of service in the Continental forces or a state militia, but by then, many veterans had already died. Laws governing widows’ pensions became more generous starting in 1836.\n\nBe aware that there are multiple types of pension records: the most information will be found in federal application files, but there are also pension payment records, which are not typically found in pension application files. These records of payments made to either the veteran or his widow may provide additional details on where a family may have moved in the years after the war, death dates of veterans, widows, or dependent children, and sometimes the maiden name of a widow.\n\nPENSION APPLICATION FILES\n\n1.

The files contain information pertaining to a soldier's rank, unit, and period of service, his age or date of birth, his residence, and sometimes his birthplace. Application files submitted by a soldier's widow may include her name, age, residence, date and place of marriage, and date and place of death of her husband. Some files contain copies of marriage or other family records. Information pertaining to the organization of military units, the movement of troops, details of battles and campaigns, and activities of individuals may occasionally be found in application statements of veterans or other documentation submitted in support of the pension application file.\"\n\nMore detailed descriptive information, including an overview of the pension laws, is available in NARA Microfilm Publications Pamphlet Describing M804\n\nNOTE: NARA also created a separate subset of this collection which contains only the \"Selected Records\" portion of each pension file, including no more than 10 pages deemed to have the most genealogical value, which is denominated NARA M805.\n\nDigitized Records available online\n\nSome but not all digitized of the records in this collection are freely available through NARA's catalog\n\nFold 3 -- Revolutionary War Pensions\n\nAncestry - U.S., Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty-Land Warrant Application Files, 1800-1900\n\nIndexes -- it doesn't appear that NARA created an official index of its own to these records, but if you are having trouble finding a name in the digitized application files, you may want to try the \"unofficial\" indexes listed here, or check the pension lists described below\n\nOnline indexes\n\nFamily Search\n\nUnited States Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty Land Warrant Applications, 1800-1900\n\nThis is the index that was created by Fold3 when digitizing the original files\n\nPrint indexes at NYPL -- note that nearly all of the earliest Revolutionary pension application files were destroyed by fire; for these, the printed indexes listed here are likely the only record available\n\nRevolutionary war pensions : awarded by state governments, 1775-1874, the general and federal governments prior to 1814, and by private acts of Congress to 1905 / Lloyd de Witt Bockstruck.\n\nAlphabetical list that includes early federal pensioners whose records were destroyed by fire\n\nA list of pensioners, for the year 1788 [electronic resource].\n\nThe pension lists of 1792-1795 : with other Revolutionary War pension records / compiled by Murtie June Clark.\n\nIndex to U.S. invalid pension records, 1801-1815 / by Murtie June Clark.\n\nIndex of Revolutionary War pension applications.

Some of the vouchers also include the names of the pensioner's surviving children and the dates of death of the veteran and/or his widow.\"\n\nNote that because these payments pre-date the 1871 pension act, only disabled veterans or the widows of soldiers killed in service will be included.\n\nFor more information on the genealogical value of these records, see Follow the Money Tracking Revolutionary War Army Pension Payments by Claire Prechtel-Kluskens, Prologue Magazine Vol. 40, No. 4 (Winter 2008).\n\nDigitized records available online\n\nFold3 -- Final Payment Vouchers Index for Military Pensions, 1818-1864\n\nPrint indexes at NYPL\n\nNYPL holds indexes to payment vouchers issued by some but not all of the regional pension payment agencies:\n\nSelected final pension payment vouchers, 1818-1864.
