        "text": "About\n\nLand ownership in the United States has been the story of land moving from Indian to White control. This observation, however, conceals a complex web of assumptions, decisions, and unilateral actions that shaped how the story took place, and the implications of the past for the future. Understanding how the land changed hands is to learn much about questions of equality, morality, and legality.\n\nWhen Europeans first arrived on the shores of North America they claimed the land they “discovered.” Besides the obvious problem of potentially overlapping claims by various European nations, Europeans quickly realized that in practice the land was already claimed, by the people living there. People already living in North America forced European settlers to think about and resolve moral, legal, and practical problems regarding land ownership. Indians, meeting Europeans who wanted land, had a similar issues to resolve. At first, neither side truly understood the other. Eventually both sides had to decide what to do now that they had met.\n\nThe story of how these issues were resolved is often told as a tale of opposites. Indians had one view. Whites had another. The truth is more subtle. Both communities were uncertain over how to proceed. Both could find members arguing for extreme positions, or for some position somewhere in between the far poles of possibilities. If in the end majorities coalesced around certain positions and practices, we should be careful not to assume that all whites thought and acted one way, while all Indians thought and acted another. Legality and morality were played out in subtle shades of grey."
