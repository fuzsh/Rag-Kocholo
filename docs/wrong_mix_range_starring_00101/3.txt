What would you do with a time machine? Save a life, meet Jesus, steal Hitler’s wallet? Time warping flick Get Back knows exactly what two die hard Beatles fans would do: Stop John Lennon from ever meeting Yoko Ono.

According to Variety Mean Girls director Mark Waters wants to make Get Back which “centers on the discovery of a time machine by two die-hard Beatles fans, who travel back in time to prevent John Lennon from meeting Yoko Ono, who they blame for the break-up of the Fab Four.”

The script is being penned by Chris McCoy, and it spent 2007 on the Black List of the best unproduced screenplays — so that’s a great sign. Plus we like Waters but for every Mean Girls and and The Spiderwick Chronicles he’s made, he’s also responsible for the unforgivable Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. So we’re thinking this film has a chance to either be amazing, or amazingly terrible.

Slashfilm raises a really interesting point about the rights to Lennon’s likeness. As Yoko Ono controls the rights to use his image, I can’t imagine she’s terribly thrilled about the premise of this film. But who knows, it could have an interesting final twist that makes everyone falls in love with Yoko. What do you think?
