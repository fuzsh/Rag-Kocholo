In an alliterative coup, Lindsay Lohan and Jared Leto are to make a film about murdered Beatle John Lennon, which will go by the title Chapter 27. Lohan will play a Lennon fan who befriends Leto, who will play murderer Mark Chapman.

Lohan has previously starred in hit comedy Mean Girls and kid-flick Herbie: Fully Loaded, with Leto's recent work including Alexander and Lord of War.
