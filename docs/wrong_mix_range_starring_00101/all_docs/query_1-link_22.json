        "text": "Launched to fame via \"The Parent Trap\" (1998) aged just twelve, Lindsay Lohan initially parlayed her child stardom into adulthood with charming performances in \"Freaky Friday\" (2003) and \"Mean Girls\" (2004) but soon became more renowned for her troubled, tabloid-baiting private life than her acting talents. Born in New York City in 1986, Lindsay Lohan signed a contract with Ford Models as a toddler and by the time she turned ten had already appeared in dozens of high-profile commercials. Lohan landed her first notable acting role when she was cast as Alli Turner in daytime soap opera \"Another World\" (NBC, 1964-1999) and two years later gained worldwide attention when she played long-lost twins Hallie and Annie in the remake of \"The Parent Trap\" (1998). Lohan went on to star opposite Tyra Banks in \"Life-Size\" (2000) and turn teenage detective in \"Get a Clue\" (2002) before joining Jamie Lee Curtis in the well-received body swap comedy, \"Freaky Friday\" (2003). A year later Lohan achieved further box office success playing an aspiring actress in \"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen\" (2004) and student Cady Heron in Tina Fey's oft-quoted high school comedy \"Mean Girls\" (2004). She then proved she was a double threat when she reached No.4 on the Billboard 200 with debut album, Speak, and after fronting yet another modern take on a Disney classic, \"Herbie: Fully Loaded\" (2005), got the chance to showcase her vocals on the big screen in Robert Altman's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" (2006). Lohan also impressed with a supporting role in ensemble drama \"Bobby\" (2006) but following the poor response to rom-com \"Just My Luck\" (2006), her career started to derail. Her performances as a stripper with two personalities and a John Lennon fan who befriends his killer in \"I Know Who Killed Me\" (2007) and \"Chapter 27\" (2007), respectively, were both widely panned, while her portrayal of an uncontrollable teen in \"Georgia Rule\" (2007) was deemed as art imitating life when a studio executive publicly called her out as unprofessional. During this period Lohan also made the front pages for her turbulent love life, numerous stints in rehab and various arrests for drug and alcohol-related offences. Lohan briefly reminded audiences of her talents with a four-episode spell on \"Ugly Betty\" (ABC, 2006-2010) and a memorable turn as a gun-toting nun in grindhouse throwback \"Machete\" (2010). But romantic comedy \"Labor Pains\" (2009) bypassed cinemas altogether, her portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor in biopic \"Liz and Dick\" (2012) was dubbed a trainwreck and her time filming erotic thriller \"The Canyons\" (2013) was plagued by behind-the-scenes problems, while reality series \"Lindsay\" (OWN, 2014) was canceled after just one season. Lohan did fare better filling in for Chelsea Handler on \"Chelsea Lately\" (E!, 2007-2014), with her stage debut in the West End production of \"Speed-the-Plow\" and in her recurring role of Don Johnson's daughter Katerina in black comedy \"Sick Note\" (Sky One, 2017- ). After a lengthy break, Lohan returned to the film world in supernatural thriller \"The Shadow Within\" (2018)."
