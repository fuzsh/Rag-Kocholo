It has designs and costumes by Alexander McPherson, lighting by Andy Grange, sound by Phil Lee.\n\nDecember 8, 1980, 10.52pm New York City, The Dakota Apartments. Five bonechilling gunshots ring out, shattering the stillness of the night. One of the most iconic figures of the 20th century lies in a pool of blood struggling for life. Time stops. Fighting to stay alive, John Lennon finds himself caught in a limbo between life and death. As his former years flash before him, Gatekeepers of his past help him confront the five stages of death - Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance."
