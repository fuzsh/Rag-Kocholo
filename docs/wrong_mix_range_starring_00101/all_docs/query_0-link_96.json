        "text": "Why John Lennon Was Definitely Probably Maybe in Love with Paul McCartney (Or an Essay on Why John Lennon was Probably Bisexual)\n\nAn Essay by Your friend, Alexander. (ha)\n\nEdit 12/30/15: THIS ESSAY IS NOW IN VIDEO FORM!\n\nWATCH HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quKDjHnVA7E\n\nEDIT PART DEUX 10/18/15:\n\nYoko Ono has recently confirmed that John Lennon is bisexual. This essay, however, was written when that was an unconfirmed rumor, and explores John’s sexuality in more detail, as well as adding comments in regards to John’s relationship with Paul McCartney. Read my thoughts on John’s confirmed sexuality here.\n\nThe Beatles being of the immense size they were, no doubt that rumors of equal immensity develop from nothing. One of these being, that John Lennon was a homosexual. At first thought, any person would dismiss such thought as sensationalist bullshit. And though the idea has some merit to it, it isn’t true. John Lennon was a lover of women, even adamant about it. Thus, it would be preposterous to assume that his interests lied with the male gender.\n\nHowever.\n\nLiking women and liking men are not mutually exclusive. The thought never occurs to many, that one can like both. But once it is propositioned forward, maybe we can reconsider Lennon’s sexuality and perhaps, his relationship with Paul. Through anecdotes, stories, and by analyzing his relationships, we can conclude that there was more going on that we initially suspected.\n\nMy initial doubts about Lennon’s heterosexuality came with the book John Lennon: The Life by Phillip Norman. It was panned by McCartney and Yoko Ono alike, at least, the part in which Normal claims that John was madly in love with Paul. Not only that fact, but that the book claims that Lennon had sexual feelings towards his mother.\n\nAnd of course, such incestuous ideas about this hero to many is preposterous! The book was dismissed as container of lies. Even if it was written by the same man who wrote “Shout!”, a much acclaimed and long trusted biography.\n\nBut what people failed to look into was Lennon’s leaked audio diary, in which John himself states that he has sexual fantasies about his mother.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko839Ppuq24\n\n“Just, I was just remembering the time I had my hand on my mother’s tit in Number 1 Blomfield Road, in… off Mather Avenue, near Garston. It’s when I was about 14… I took the day off school. I was always doing that and hanging out in her house. We were lying on the bed and I was thinking, I wonder if I should be doing anything else, you know? And it was a strange moment.”\n\nSo it’s established that perhaps some parts of the book have merit to them, and perhaps are not as hogwash as they seem. What other parts could the book be accurate about? To quote the biography:\n\n“From chance remarks she (Yoko) had made, she gathered there had even been a moment where - on the principle that bohemians should try everything - he had contemplated an affair with Paul, but had been deterred by Paul’s immovable heterosexuality.”\n\nSo the claim here is that John wanted Paul. He wanted Paul in that way. But examining whether John pined after Paul, and whether or not that pining was requited, let’s take a look at Lennon’s sexuality.\n\nJohn’s sexuality first comes into question when Brian Epstein is brought up. Yes, of course, Brian Epstein. Their gay manager, who conveniently went on a trip with John alone to Spain together while John’s wife Cynthia was pregnant. Disregarding the fact that John and Paul took a trip to Paris all by themselves, let us first talk about Mr. Epstein.\n\nPete Shotton, one of John’s closest friends, recounts questioning John on the matter:\n\n“I visited John at Aunt Mimi’s a few days after his return to England. And when he started in about how much he had enjoyed Spain, I could hardly resist taking the piss out of him. “So you had a good time with Brian, then?” I smirked. Nudge nudge, wink wink.\n\nI was somewhat taken aback when John didn’t so much as crack a smile. “Oh, fuckin’ hell,” he groaned. “Not you as well, Pete!”\n\n“What do you mean, not me as well?”\n\n“They’re all fucking going on about it.”\n\nIt’s OK, John. Don’t take it so serious. I’m just joking, for Christ’s sake.“\n\n\"Actually Pete,” he said softly, “Something did happen with him one night.”\n\nNow that wiped the grin right off my face. Had I even dreamed there might be any truth whatsoever to the rumors, I would never have made light of the subject in the first place. Still - as John surely knew - I would have stood by him, and let the rest of the world handle the business of passing moral judgement, even if he had just told me he’d committed murder. And John would surely have done the same for me.\n\nWhich, after all, is what true friendship is all about.\n\n“What happened,” John explained, “is that Eppy just kept on and on at me. Until one night I finally just pulled me trousers down and said to him: ‘Oh, for Christ’s sake, Brian, just stick it up me fucking arse then.’\n\n\"And he said to me, 'Actually, John, I don’t do that kind of thing. That’s not what I like to do.’\n\n”'Well,’ I said, 'what is it you like to do, then?’\n\n“And he said, 'I’d really just like to touch you, John.’\n\n\"And so I let him toss me off.”\n\nAnd that was that. End of story.\n\n“That’s all, John” I said. “Well, so what? What’s the big fucking deal, then?”\n\n“Yeah, so fucking what! The poor bastard. He’s having a fucking hard enough time anyway.” This was in reference to the “butch” dockers who, on several recent occasions, had rewarded Brian’s advances by beating him to a bloody pulp.\n\n“So what harm did it do, then, Pete, for fuck’s sake?” John asked rhetorically. “No harm at all. The poor fucking bastard, he can’t help the way he is.”\n\n- Pete Shotton, The Lives of John Lennon\n\nAnd of course, that story may have very well been bullshit, but what motivation does Pete Shotton have for fabricating a lie about one of his former friends? Especially in a book published in 1983, when homosexuality wasn’t the thing it was now. Let’s hear John on the subject:\n\n“I was on holiday with Brian Epstein in Spain, where the rumours went around that he and I were having a love affair. Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. He had admitted it to me. We had this holiday together because Cyn was pregnant, and I went to Spain and there were lots of funny stories. We used to sit in a cafe in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I’d say, 'Do you like that one, do you like this one?’ I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this, you know. And while he was out on the tiles one night, or lying asleep with a hangover one afternoon, I remember playing him the song Bad To Me. That was a commissioned song, done for Billy J Kramer, who was another of Brian’s singers.”\n\n- John Lennon, All We Are Saying, David Sheff\n\nTake a note of that phrase in bold. Almost a love affair? Did that mean Lennon wanted to have an affair with Epstein? What did he mean by “pretty intense”? Was their unresolved sexual tension that he had yet to reveal to the public? Perhaps his ambiguous wording could have been cleared up, If John had had not been shot one month after the interview was conducted.\n\nHowever, I think it is safe to assume that John was on the edge of revealing something to us. And I believe it is safe to assume he and Brian did have an “intense” relationship. Intense enough to spark a small love affair? Perhaps. But unfortunately, the two people who know are dead.\n\nSo one homosexual encounter does not prove someone is bisexual. There has to be more. And for Lennon, there is.\n\nJohn’s relationship with Stuart Sutcliffe was also an “intense” relationship, as far as those go. To the point where Stuart’s sister was convinced that John and Stuart had a homosexual love affair. Did her convictions have any merit? Of course, we’ll never be sure, as once again, the two people in question are dead. But what are her suspicions based on? Surely, she was close to Stuart, being her brother, and suspicions always arise. Or perhaps it was because, as she claims, “John said himself at one point that this happened.”\n\nHere are her own words on the matter:\n\n“Q -Did you say or did someone else say that you believe John and your brother engaged in a homosexual relationship? How did you arrive at that conclusion? Did Stuart say something to you?\n\nA - The press had a field day with all of this and I’m sure you know all of that from the internet.\n\nQ - Actually, I don’t. I saw just a little on it.\n\nA - Oh, honey. I don’t have a lot more to say about this, beyond what I’ve said in my book. Now, I was not the original source of that. OK? John was the original source, according to other well-known writers or publicists or inner circle entourage. So, I’m not the originator of that, I have not confirmed that in any way. I simply say I’m a very seasoned psychotherapist and given that they had a hugely intimate relationship and also as very young men became involved in a hugely decadent world then at the time, they could’ve explored something like that together. Who knows? I personally don’t know, but I can see they might have done or they might have not done. According to the written material out there, John is the person who originated that story. So, I really just comment on it.\n\nQ - I had never heard about John and Stuart before. I have heard rumors about John and Brian Epstein.\n\nA - Well, there’s even new information on that these days. It would seem there’s more evidence to say that it did happen than that it didn’t. But…who cares? But, the story didn’t generate from me. I don’t care personally. They were not homosexually inclined in any way. They loved women too much. It doesn’t matter to me if they did. I could care less. But, I’m not the source of that.”\n\n-Pauline Sutcliffe\n\nNow many would suspect, perhaps this woman is making it up. Perhaps she enjoys her five seconds in the spotlight. But what a modest way to push yourself into the limelight. To say “they could’ve explored something like that together” instead of “he was a full on flamer!”. There is no incentive for her to fabricate a story about her brother. And though some will point to the attention she received, I believe that if attention is what she wanted, she would have found a better way to do it.\n\nBut it was clear that John and Stuart had a very “intense” relationship, akin to the one he and Epstein had.\n\n“I felt I knew Stuart because hardly a day went by that John did not speak about him”\n\n-Yoko Ono\n\nAnd for John to continue to admire Stuart twenty years later is such a feat. I think it’s a testament to the intensity of their relationship, which was surely more than the ordinary friendship.\n\nPaul recounts:\n\n“He and I used to have a deadly rivalry. I don’t know why. He was older and a strong friend of John’s. When I look back on it I think we were probably fighting for John’s attention.”\n\n-Paul McCartney, Many Years From Now\n\nAnd of course, there are simply chance remarks on Lennon’s sexuality, that further support the fact that John may have been anything other than straight.\n\nDuring John’s “Lost Weekend”, a period of time when he and Yoko were separated, John tells us of some of what happened:\n\n“I was trying to put it 'round that I was gay, you know– I thought that would throw them off… dancing at all the gay clubs in Los Angeles, flirting with the boys… but it never got off the ground.”\n\n-John Lennon, Playboy\n\nA story that very well could have been an act of desperation, in a desperate time. But how many straight men do you know go to a gay bar when they’re suddenly a bachelor? What was John’s mindset? And what exactly did “flirting” entail?\n\nJohn was very conscious of people’s suspicions, and often very erratic about the fact.\n\nPete Shotton brings us another account .\n\nThe two of them dropped acid one night in 1967, they ended up in his attic, and they both passed out on the floor. The next morning, they were awakened by the maid trudging up the attic stairwell. John woke up and on hearing her footsteps, suddenly shot to his feet saying, “Oh Christ, she’ll think we’ve been fucking!” (Lennon in America)\n\nDid John think his wife was that suspicious of him? Was he trying to hide the fact that much? What an odd thing for a supposedly straight man to worry about.\n\nSo I believe that by now, perhaps it has been established that John wasn’t straight as an arrow. Perhaps his inclinations were shifted, as many people’s are. But the question stands: what about him and Paul?\n\nPaul, by all accounts and measures, is an undoubtedly straight man. He’s comfortable with that fact, and that’s perfectly fine. However, the questions come with his response to John’s homosexual leanings.\n\nWhen Phillip Norman in his biography had brought up John’s gay leanings, Paul and Yoko were apparently furious that Norman could make such a claim that “John was in love with Paul”.\n\nYoko, understandably denies this fact, but perhaps she denies it, not because it was untrue, but because of her “rivalry” with McCartney. Or just disdain with the fact that John could be in love with anyone but her.\n\nWhat is Paul’s incentive for denying the fact, however? John was his best friend; he had to have suspected something about John. Given all these stories, especially John’s relationship with Brian and Stu, Paul still claims that there wasn’t even hint.\n\nHere is Paul speaking on the matter in the 1980’s when a book claiming John was a homosexual was published:\n\n“He certainly had some wild periods that he admitted to, but a lot of people have that. I think where he starts to exaggerate and says that John was… possibly a homosexual…. I think he throws that in with some of the truth and it starts to have the same credence as the real truth.”\n\n-Paul McCarntey (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDwOAkfA1M)\n\nPaul Further goes on to say:\n\n“And I say, if he’s homosexual, I thought he’d have made a pass at me in 20 years, darling.”\n\nAnd though said in a joking tone, it seems to be a fact that Paul returns to time after time. The thought that “if John were gay, he would have wanted me”.\n\nIn 2012, the same question was brought up again on Howard Stern.\n\n“Stern: There’s a new book out about John that claims… (Lennon’s homosexuality)\n\nMcCartney: You know, that rumor came out a long time ago, and the thing was, the press started the rumor… the book that it was in…. He didn’t know John. Whereas I did, so I said to people, ‘Look, I was on tour with John, I grew up with John, we slept in the same bed in hotel rooms, we topped and tailed it like kids do, y’know, when you’re growing up. And I said, ‘never once did I see any hint of that’. Now you know, we spent drunken nights together, I think there would have been a hint, don’t’ you think?”\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-q0rVz16vU)\n\nOnce again, Paul’s denials are simply a matter of “well if he was gay, he would have wanted me”. When Paul claimed that he needs some sort of “hint”, he fails to recall John’s relationship with Brian or Stuarts relationship with John. Instead, he claims once again, that if John were gay, John would have wanted HIM.\n\nIf John didn’t want Paul, then John didn’t want any men, according to McCartney.\n\nIn the 1980’s when the rumors first appeared, McCartney also made the statement that John’s instability and fame mixed together, contributed to his sometimes “wild acts”. And then goes on to point out John’s unstable life and childhood. Which he concludes with “I’m surprised he was a straight as he was.” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIDwOAkfA1M)\n\nAnd though I’m sure that quote came out of the misunderstanding of homosexuality in the 1980s, it only goes to show how little Paul understood about sexuality at the time. That an unstable childhood could somehow “cause” homosexuality.\n\nIn 2012, Paul seems more understanding about sexuality. But still returns to the “he must have wanted me” state of mind.\n\nBased on quotes and remarks being made about the Lennon McCartney dynamic, one can assume that their relationship was “intense”. And perhaps, as “intense” as the relationships that John shared with Brian Epstein or Stuart Sutcliffe.\n\nHere are a few that come to mind:\n\n“We were each other’s intimates.”\n\n- Paul, The Beatles: A Biography\n\n“Paul and I know each other on a lot of different levels that very few people know about.”\n\n- John\n\n“Whatever bad things John said about me, he would also slip his glasses down to the end of his nose and say, 'I love you’. That’s really what I hold on to. That’s what I believe. The rest is showing off.”\n\n– Paul\n\n“John would sometimes get on the edge. He’d come in in the early hours of the morning and be ranting, and I’d be lying there pretending to be asleep, hoping he wouldn’t notice me. One time Paul had a chick in bed and John came in and got a pair of scissors and cut all her clothes into pieces and then wrecked the wardrobe. He got like that occasionally; it was because of the pills and being up too long.”\n\n-George Harrison\n\nPerhaps a mix of drug induced rage, a sincere rage, stemming from John’s disdain for the women Paul courted? It seems like the act of a frustrated man, in a time of desperation.\n\nOnce again we turn to Phillip Norman for Yoko Ono’s perspective:\n\n“Nor, apparently, was Yoko the only one to have picked up on this. Around Apple, in her hearing, Paul would sometimes be called John’s princess. She had also once heard a rehearsal tape with John’s voice calling out \"Paul … Paul … “ in a strangely subservient, pleading way. “I knew there was something going on there,” she remembers. “From his point of view, not from Paul’s. And he was so angry at Paul, I couldn’t help wondering what it was really about.”\n\n- John Lennon: The Life\n\nThe final “hint” that perhaps John was far more intimate with his band mate than anyone of us suspect, come post-mortem. In January 1994, Paul McCartney was given two tape cassettes by Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono that included home recordings of songs Lennon never completed or released commercially. On one of the tapes, the words \"for Paul” had been scrawled hastily in John’s handwriting. The songs on the tape included “Grow Old With Me” and “Now and Then”. These songs were clearly love songs, and love songs that had never been completed.\n\nPerhaps towards the end of his life, given that he was on the edge of revealing the truth about him and Brian, John was becoming more open with his sexuality. More specifically- his true feelings towards Paul, whatever that may be.\n\nIt seems apparent to anyone who researches the topic that John was far from being the staunch heterosexual that Paul had makes him out to be. Given John’s relationships and attitudes as a whole, one can surely make the conclusion that John had interests outside the realm of women. But in examining his relationship with Paul, complications arise. Being his lifelong best friend, and still somehow not knowing or even suspecting John’s more than obvious leanings, does not seem to add up. So either Paul is the most oblivious man in the world, or he’s hiding something.\n\nThey certainly had an immensely intimate relationship. No doubt in my mind would make me think any different of that fact, and I’m sure they have never doubted that themselves. And perhaps John tried to hid his affections or repress them in an effort to hide them from his songwriting partner. These repressed feelings certainly come out as anger in their post-break up feuds.\n\nTheir relationship was deep and even fragile for a period of time before John’s death. There is certainly an understandable reason why Paul would want to have kept John’s leanings a secret.\n\nThe question of whether or not John and Paul’s relationship was ever consummated is one left for speculation. However, it is undeniable that John and Paul’s connection, though unconsummated, is deeper than any of us can understand, and perhaps, too deep for even them to understand. No matter what has been said or what evidence can be brought up, it is unfortunate that the only man who can defend himself is no longer with us.\n\nSo, John was most likely bisexual, and that’s okay. Possibly infatuated with Paul, and had maybe tried taking it a step further. We’ll never know. Lennon was a complex character entangled in a complex relationship. A relationship that words on a page could never fully explain."
