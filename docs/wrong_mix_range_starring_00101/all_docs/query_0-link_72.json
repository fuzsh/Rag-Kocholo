        "text": "Post by ~pSycHo.kiTTy~ on\n\nI hated people for writing about Cynthia that she's been naive, believing John was faithful to her. What's naive in trusting your husband?!\n\nAnd I don't give a shit on \"everyone in the music business doing it\", it's simply not right. I think the only mistake Cyn made was to forgive him right away after he confessed his affairs to her. I would have packed my bags and left... and she wouldn't have had to bear the later humiliation when she found him with Yoko.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE John... but that's no reason to idealise him! Just my opinion!\n\nPost by Mrs. O'Boogie on\n\nYou are totally right psycho.kitty, there’s no reason for no one to accept that kind of thing. On mi opinion Cyn should packed her bags the very moment he slap her after that party when they were in Art School when they were only dating.\n\nIn addition, for the Yoko part, John really was a royal bastard on those days; the humiliation he gave to Cyn is indescribable... he tried to make her look as if she was the one cheating on him, after she found them in their house, knowing that they had sex probably on their bed and with Yoko wearing her clothes for God sake!. I can understand that he didn't love her anymore but she was the person who was with him from the beginning, she was in the bad and the goods, the one who was alone at home while he was on tour or partying. The one who has to give birth Julian alone because he was on tour and the one who stayed at home taking care of a newborn baby while he was relaxing in Spain with Brian. She was the mother of his son and she deserved more respect than the one he give her at the end.\n\nI do love John, you all here know that, I practically drool over him every second of the day but that is no reason for me to idealize him and approve for him been a jerk, he was very mean with Cyn when he started to see Yoko.\n\nPost by ~pSycHo.kiTTy~ on\n\nI've got absolutely the same opinion like you, mrsoboogie!\n\nWell and Cyn DID pack her bags after he slapt her. Three months or so she ignored him, until he called her and apologized and said he didn't mean to hurt her. By the way you can se how very jealous he was already in those days, because he beat her after seeing her dance with Stu.\n\nHe slapt her because of THIS, but he himself had countless affairs, I really wonder where the justice in this is.\n\nAnd I totally agree with your opinion on the scene you described. That is another reason for me to despise the ones calling Cyn a sensitive little lady... because I think her reaction on this and bearing all oft it shows how strong she really is. I don't know what I would've done if I'd have found my husband in THAT situation. I really don't know.\n\nPost by givepeaceachance on\n\nQuote from Beatles Anthology book:\n\n\"I was hysterical. That was the trouble. I was jealous of anyone she had anything to do with. I demanded absolute trust from her, because I wasn't trustworthy myself. I was neurotic, taking all my frustrations out on her. She did leave me once. That was terrible. I couldn't stand being without her.\" - John Lennon\n\nI often wonder if Jealous Guy could have been about Cynthia. I know he never said it was, but it seems to me it applies more to Cynthia than Yoko.\n\nPost by Mrs. O'Boogie on\n\nJohn was a very insecure man even when he got that tough self-confidence exterior.\n\nI do believe that even when John got inspired to write the original version of the song he already knew Yoko Ono, I do believe Jealous Guy it was more about Cynthia and it was his way to say I’m sorry. Here is a little fact about the song:\n\nAny way the song's genesis came in India, after The Beatles attended a lecture by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi about a \"son of the mother nature\". This inspired both Paul and John to write songs about the same subject. McCartney's composition “Mother Nature’s Son” was selected for The Beatles (the White Album), while Lennon's song \"Child of Nature\" was not. After that, Lennon continued to play it into the Get Back sessions. Eventually, the lyrics were scrapped and replaced by the now well-known \"Jealous Guy\" lyrics for Imagine.\n\nThree recordings of \"Child of Nature\" are currently known. The first is a demo of the song recorded at the home of George Harrison in May of 1968. The second, on which George sings backing vocals, was recorded at Twickenham Film Studios on January 2, 1969. A third recording was made at Apple Studios on January 24. A snatch of the chorus from the second recording appears on the Fly on the Wall bonus disc packaged with Let It Be…\n\nAbout the famous slap, you are absolutely right Psycho kitty, I knew that he slap her after seeing her dance with Stu. But the scary facts in that action is that he not just slap her there when he found her, he waited to the next day to slap her alone, so it wasn’t only a reaction to the situation, but a conscience act, he though about to do it when no one could see him doing it… Anyway, she forgives him and she said he never did it again; I want to believe her…but honestly, I can't…\n\nI also agree with you, on that he was very jealous but he wasn’t faithful at all, he demanded from her loyalty but he was having affairs all over the place even when women they both knew. That is even more humiliating than do it with random girls on tour."
