        "text": "“ We call those three \"The Plastics\"\n\nThey're shiny, fake and hard\n\nThey play their little mind games\n\nAll around the school yard\n\nThey might insult your clothing\n\nOr make fun of your name\n\nLike they mocked Jen Morecock\n\n'Till she burst into flame\n\nAnd Jen Morecock was a TEACHER „ ~ Janis and Damian explaining a Mean Girl clique to Cady in \"Meet The Plastics\"\n\nMean Girls are characters in fiction described as \"alpha bitches\", who often act like they own the school they reside in due to their immense popularity and influence over the students and sometimes teachers inside. This somehow manages to grant them various supernatural powers that they use to keep their underlings in line. This power can be gained by others outside their cliques such as Cady Heron and Veronica Sawyer by proving they're \"not a pussy\" or a \"lameass\" and they may subsequently lose their power when deemed unworthy. Notable cliques include The Plastics, The Heathers, Henry VIII's ex-wives and The Schuyler Sisters. Mean Girls do not entirely have to share the exact same qualities, merely meet a certain musical quota.\n\nUses[]\n\nMean Girls have a wide variety of otherworldly skills and abilities including but not limited to:\n\nSuperhuman Physical Characteristics: Mean Girls are gifted enhanced strength that allow them to take on opponents like Veronica, who was the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs and perform feats like spinning around the globe.\n\nMind Manipulation, Empathic Manipulation, Fear Manipulation, Corruption and Morality Manipulation: Anyone in their presence has their mind put utterly under their control, particularly through their emotions. They are forced to either immensely love them or fear them. This is how they keep their subjects in line. Some particularly gifted with this power like Regina George can use it to deactivate people's ability to think for themselves and speak entirely, as well as corrupt them into becoming one of them, as she did with Cady. Some like Post-Chandler Death Heather Duke can even use this to make the victim fall into severe depression to the point where they can no longer bear the will to live anymore.\n\nSocial Influencing: Even without their mindhax, they are still able to influence those that are resistant through speech alone, such as Veronica Sawyer.\n\nExtrasensory Perception: Mean Girls are able to view the souls of their victims.\n\nBroadway Force, Spatial Manipulation and Reality Warping: Through song, they are able to severely warp the world around them to their whims to suit their mood. Nobody is allowed to perform any actions during their musical numbers and those unable to resist must participate in them as ensemble.\n\nImmortality (Type 1, 5, 6. 7, 9), Telepathy, Omnipresence, Statistics Amplification, Madness Manipulation and Dream Manipulation: Girls like Heather Chandler can live on as a ghost, even when destroyed for good, and appear relentlessly within the dreams and thoughts of their killer. Heather Chandler stated that she was like oxygen in this state and was everywhere when climbing into Veronica's mind. From then on, she appeared beside Veronica as a ghost, gradually driving her insane. Upon her death, Heather Chandler became significantly more powerful -- even surpassing the power level of John Lennon and transcending to his plane of existence. She was stated to be able to live forever despite being dead and become the \"me\" inside of \"me\" of everyone and everything.\n\nSize Manipulation: With their power, The Heathers demonstrated the ability to shrink Veronica down to the size of an ant.\n\nClairvoyance: Mean Girls have the ability to look anywhere at any given time and see everything they desire to. Janis stated that everyone could feel Regina watching them throughout the school with just a stare.\n\nFate Manipulation, Death Manipulation, and Existence Erasure: A Mean Girl is able to decree that someone will be \"deleted\" at a certain time.\n\nTransmutation, Void Manipulation, Nonexistence Erasure: A Mean Girl is able to turn people into various animals if they so choose, like a chihuahua or various prey. They can also turn people into \"nobodies\" and make them even less than that.\n\nParalysis Inducement: Mean Girls can freeze people in place with a wave of their hair.\n\nCreation: Mean Girls can create whatever they like out of thin air, like candy, handcuffs, a prison ball and chains, and chips.\n\nShapeshifting and Transformation: Due to being the apex predators of the school, Mean Girls are able to shapeshift to any predator that fits their mood, such as a lioness and even the sun.\n\nInformation Manipulation: Can make it so what they write down or say becomes a generally known fact that everyone must abide by.\n\nTelekinesis: Mean Girls like Regina and Chandler can push people around without even using physical contact.\n\nFire Manipulation: The Plastics could mock someone so hard, they burned up in flame.\n\nPower Nullification: Mean Girls can take away the power of another Mean Girl, as seen with what Heather Chandler threatened to do with Veronica and what Heather Duke successfully ended up doing to Heather McNamara. By ousting Regina from The Plastics, Cady was able to do this to her.\n\nThread Manipulation, Blood Manipulation, Soul Manipulation and Body Puppetry: The Heathers are shown to be able to use Blood Strings, a technique used by J.D., which are strings made up of the blood of the victim that can be used to control them and inflict pain upon them, on Veronica and Martha during the party sequence, which attached to their souls.\n\nResistances[]\n\nBecause of their status, they possess a few resistances that prevent other students from gaining the upper hand. Such as:\n\nFate Manipulation: Veronica Sawyer was able to avoid Chandler's cemented fate for her.\n\nMind Manipulation, Empathic Manipulation, Fear Manipulation, Corruption and Morality Manipulation: Mean Girls consistently resist the presence of other Mean Girls and their immense power over the mind.\n\nExtreme Cold and Cosmic Radiation: Mean Girls are able to survive just fine in the depths of space.\n\nBroadway Force, Spatial Manipulation, and Reality Warping: Mean Girls are able to cancel out the effects of Broadway Force, such as when Heather Chandler interrupted Heather Duke's solo just so she could continue the rest of the song herself and when Veronica was able to completely stop Dead Girl Walking (Reprise) by shooting J.D.\n\nLimitations[]"
