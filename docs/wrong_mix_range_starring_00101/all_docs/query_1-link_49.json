        "text": "Hi there. This week on Ask a Teacher, we will answer a question about the difference between “teen” and “tween.”\n\nQuestion:\n\nHello VOA Learning English,\n\nI am Abdirohim from Somalia. Could you kindly explain and further explore the differences and usage between these two words: “tweens” and “teens?''\n\nThanks,\n\nAbdirohim\n\nAnswer:\n\nThanks for you for this interesting question, Abdirohim! Both words refer to very young people.\n\nThere are major differences in the ages of these two groups. Let’s look not only at the meanings of these two words but also how they were made. Let’s start with “teen.”\n\nTeen\n\nThe word “teen” is a noun that means a young person from ages thirteen to nineteen. We get this word from the ending of the numbers, like thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on.\n\nMany teens enjoy hanging out with their friends.\n\nWhen he was a teen, he loved the Beatles music.\n\nWe combine “teen” with “age” to make “teenage,” an adjective that describes someone who is in their teens.\n\nThe movie “Mean Girls” is about a group of teenage girls in high school.\n\nWe can also add an “-er” ending to “teenage” to make another noun with the same meaning as “teen.”\n\nSome teenagers like to go against their parents.\n\nNow, let’s move on to “tween.”\n\nTween\n\nThe word “tween” is a blend of the two words “teen” and “between.”\n\nIt is a special blend word since it combines not only the spellings of the two words but the meanings as well. The word is used to describe the age group between a child and a teenager. The earliest age for \"tweens\" is eight or nine years old, and the oldest age goes up to twelve.\n\nMany tweens go to a middle school after completing elementary and before going to high school.\n\nMaria looks after tweens who are not old enough to be by themselves.\n\nWe also call this group of young people “preteens,” with the prefix “pre” to mean “before.”\n\nA fun fact about the history of “tween” is that it may have come from JRR Tolkien who wrote The Lord of the Ring books. Some say he came up with “tween” to describe an in-between age for his characters called “hobbits.”\n\nPlease let us know if these explanations and examples have helped you, Abdirohim.\n\nDo you know any other blend words in English or have a question about them? You can send these and other questions you have about American English to our email at learningenglish@voanews.com.\n\nAnd that’s Ask a Teacher.\n\nI’m Faith Pirlo.\n\nFaith Pirlo wrote this lesson for VOA Learning English.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nWords in This Story\n\nblend – n. a word made by combining parts of two words\n\nelementary – adj. relating to or teaching the basic subjects of education\n\ncharacter –n. a person who appears in a story, for example in a book or television show\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nDo you have a question for the teacher? We want to hear from you. We have a new comment system. Here is how it works:\n\nWrite your comment in the box.\n\nUnder the box, you can see four images for social media accounts. They are for Disqus, Facebook, Twitter, and Google.\n\nClick on one image and a box appears. Enter the login for your social media account. Or you may create one on the Disqus system. It is the blue circle with “D” on it. It is free."
