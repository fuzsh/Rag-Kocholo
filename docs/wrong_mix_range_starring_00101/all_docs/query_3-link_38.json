Okay, call us intrigued.\n\nTrailer: HERE\n\n'Summer Camp'\n\nRelease Date: May 31, 2024\n\nStarring: Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Beverly D'Angelo, Nicole Richie, Josh Peck, Betsy Sodaro, Dennis Haysbert, and Eugene Levy\n\nThis adorable comedy from the producers of Book Club brings together a new group of esteemed actresses for a fun adventure.
