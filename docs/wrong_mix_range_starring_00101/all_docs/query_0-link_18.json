        "text": "IMO, \"Twisters\" is superior to the original. I missed Van Halen on the soundtrack, but they plugged in a bad-ass Lainey Wilson ditty. There's also more for horror fans. \"Oddity\" is a creepy flick from Ireland. Watch this weekend's \"At The Movies\": https://lnkd.in/egAhh2qt #movies #moviereviewer #entertainmentreporter #weekend #weekendboxoffice #tvhost #tvsegment #atthemovies #wtnh\n\nSlip through the dark side and cross that line....with my interview with John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band: https://lnkd.in/epg7TnQD #interview #rocknroll #legend #icon #rhodeisland #podcast #livemusic #newmusic #onthedarkside #eddieandthecruisers #iheartradio #broadcaster #morningradiohost\n\nThe guy behind Nicholas Cage's brilliant \"Pig\" gives us a \"Quiet Place\" prequel that's actually as beautiful as it is scary. And \"Kinds of Kindness\" is a freak show. \"At The Movies\": https://lnkd.in/eNWiYbpj #movies #moviereviewer #entertainmentreporter #weekendboxoffice #prequel #tvhost #tvsegment #atthemovies #wtnh\n\n\"It's A Yacht Lobsters Father's Day, Vinnie Penn!\" If you love #YachtRock (and who doesn't?), check out my chat with the lead singer of #YachtLobsters. He was on my morning show this week and we discussed who IS Yacht Rock and who ISN'T; I got a few wrong I guess. https://lnkd.in/epmuTycE #music #morningradio #iheartradio #radioshowhost #fathersday #broadcaster #70smusic #podcast\n\n#InsideOut2 is SO funny, so clever, so sharp, and even a little bit heartbreaking. There's also a Henry VIII flick and a Julia Louis-Dreyfus/A24 collab \"At The Movies\" this #FathersDayWeekend: https://lnkd.in/e-KfRxbN #movies #moviereviewer #entertainmentreporter #tvsegment #tvhost #atthemovies #wtnh #A24\n\nMy latest for CT Insider: Chatting up my girl #NikkiGlaser, who returns to Connecticut for not one but TWO shows at #Foxwoods: https://lnkd.in/eX8gBZxG #writer #interview #article #ctinsider #journalist #hearst #comedian\n\nMe & Nikki Glaser. How do YOU think it went? She plays Foxwoods on June 22. Check out our raucous, flirty, filthy interview: https://lnkd.in/eBq5pwbh #comedy #standupcomedy #comedian #interview #morningradioshow #nikkiglaser #podcast #iheartradio #foxwoods\n\n\"Life Is Just A Fantasy\" 80's rocker Aldo Nova sat down with me to talk Then, Now, and Sunday night at Mohegan Sun with Ace Frehley: https://lnkd.in/e3wxrjJa #interview #radioshowhost #podcast #80srock #triplebill #mohegansun #holidayweekend #livemusic #concert #fantasy #aldonova #iheartradio #broadcaster"
