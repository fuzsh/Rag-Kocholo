        "text": "Many creative, sensitive, intense and/or gifted teens and adults sometimes feel they are misfits.\n\nOne example was John Lennon – he once said:\n\n“There was something wrong with me, I thought, because I seemed to see things other people didn’t see.”\n\nHere is more from a magazine interview with Lennon:\n\nPlayboy: How about “Strawberry Fields Forever?” … And the lyrics, for instance: “Living is easy—- ”\n\nJohn Lennon: [Singing] “With eyes closed. Misunderstanding all you see.”\n\nIt still goes, doesn’t it? Aren’t I saying exactly the same thing now?\n\nThe awareness apparently trying to be expressed is — let’s say in one way I was always hip. I was hip in kindergarten. I was different from the others. I was different all my life.\n\nThe second verse goes, “No one I think is in my tree.”\n\nWell, I was too shy and self-doubting. Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what I was saying.\n\nTherefore, I must be crazy or a genius — “I mean it must be high or low,” the next line.\n\nThere was something wrong with me, I thought, because I seemed to see things other people didn’t see.\n\nI thought I was crazy or an egomaniac for claiming to see things other people didn’t see.\n\nAs a child, I would say, “But this is going on!” and everybody would look at me as if I was crazy.\n\nI always was so psychic or intuitive or poetic or whatever you want to call it, that I was always seeing things in a hallucinatory way.\n\nIt was scary as a child, because there was nobody to relate to. Neither my auntie nor my friends nor anybody could ever see what I did.\n\nIt was very, very scary and the only contact I had was reading about an Oscar Wilde or a Dylan Thomas or a Vincent van Gogh — all those books that my auntie had that talked about their suffering because of their visions.\n\nBecause of what they saw, they were tortured by society for trying to express what they were. I saw loneliness.\n\nFrom a 1980 Playboy Interview With John Lennon And Yoko Ono.\n\n~~~~~\n\nTherapist Sharon Barnes works with creative, sensitive, intense and/or gifted teens and adults, and hears from many of them statements like Lennon made.\n\n“Emotional characteristics of creative people”\n\nLearn about her home-study HSP-GT-2E Social & Emotional Empowerment Program in article:\n\nEmotional Health for Creative, Gifted, Highly Sensitive People.\n\nShe comments, “In my counseling office talking to people face to face across the room and as I’m at my computer connecting with people around the world, I hear so many people who feel discouraged and feel like a misfit, like they don’t belong because of their characteristics.\n\n“Some even tell me that they feel like they’re aliens from a different planet.\n\n“I’ve begun to hear it more and more and more and I’m no longer surprised at the people who tell me this – I’m saddened yes but that’s one of the reasons that I’m here is that there’s so many people who feel like a misfit and feel like an alien – people with these important characteristics that we really need.”\n\nThe Program will “help your CASIGY™ family become skilled ACES in Coping with Asynchrony, Increasing Social Skills, Developing Emotional Resilience and Improving Self-esteem.”\n\n[CASIGY™ = Creative, Acutely Aware, Super-Sensitive, Intense and/or Gifted You’s.]\n\n~~~~~\n\nI was kind of a misfit little kid and bullied at school.” – Sara Bareilles\n\nNot fitting in with others and feeling weird is a common experience for many of us.\n\nA number of artists have found creative work is a way to express their unique personalities and talents, and feel accepted.\n\nSinger-songwriter, actress and author Sara Bareilles made her Broadway performing debut as Jenna in the musical Waitress.\n\nShe also composed music and wrote lyrics for the show, earning a Tony Award nomination for Best Original Score in 2016, and a Grammy nomination for Best Musical Theatre Album.\n\nAn article notes she grew up in a theatre-loving home.\n\n“My mom and my sisters were all very involved in community theatre, and so I would go as a little girl, and I’m much younger, nine years younger than my oldest sister and six years younger than my middle sister,” says Bareilles.\n\n“I would go and see their productions and just couldn’t wait to get onstage.\n\n“I was kind of a misfit little kid and bullied at school, so finding the theatrical community was a great home for me very early on.\n\n“It’s where I felt like I could really be myself and be the little weirdo I was and not be judged for it.”\n\nSee more in article\n\nCreative People Can Feel Wrong For Being Different\n\n~~~~\n\nMore from John Lennon\n\n“I’m not going to change the way I look or the way I feel to conform to anything.\n\n“I’ve always been a freak.. all my life and I have to live with that, you know…\n\n“Part of me suspects that I’m a loser, and the other part of me thinks I’m God Almighty.\n\n“You’re just left with yourself all the time, whatever you do anyway. You’ve got to get down to your own God in your own temple. It’s all down to you, mate.” [From brainyquote.com]\n\nRelated bio: Lennon Revealed by Larry Kane.\n\nSee more quotes by John Lennon and other highly talented and creative people on the page:\n\nTalented, But Insecure – How To Gain Confidence\n\n~~~~~\n\nFeeling like a freak\n\nLady Gaga said she “felt like freak” in high school, and creates music for her fans who want a “freak to hang out with.”\n\nShe admits it took her a long time to be okay with how she is, and get beyond needing to fit in, or be like everyone else – “but not really” wanting to be…\n\n“Sometimes you don’t feel like a winner, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t a winner.”\n\nFrom my article Identity and Being Creative.\n\nShe was identified as a gifted adolescent, and at age 17 achieved early admission to New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nVisited 1,164 times, 1 visit(s) today\n\nø ø ø ø"
