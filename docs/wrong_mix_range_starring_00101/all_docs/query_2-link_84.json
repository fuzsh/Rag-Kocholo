Then, over a period of a few weeks, I watched The Beatles Anthology boxset - which I enjoyed too. There should be some material for movies about the four.

Not surprised, though.\n\nMy expectations for the four movies aren't particularly high, I have to admit. Against that, at times I have been thoroughly dissappointed by movies based on some of my favourite stories, and pleasantly surprised by adaptations of, to me, material of very little interest. So I will reserve my judgement of Sam Mendes' handiwork until it's ready. YMMV.\n\nWhat's the fuss about, anyway?\n\nLast edited: 21 February 2024\n\nJusto Miranda\n\nACCESS: Above Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n2 December 2007\n\nMessages\n\n7,009\n\nReaction score\n\n9,152\n\nWebsite\n\nwww.amazon.com\n\n21 February 2024\n\n#17\n\nThose were good times: milk still had cream, girls wore miniskirts, musicians had studied music, rappers and influencers had not yet been invented, Hollywood made good movies, and only gravediggers, lawyers, and churchmen wore black.
