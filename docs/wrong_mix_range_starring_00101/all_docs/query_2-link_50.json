        "text": "February 28, 2016\n\n“I am the Walrus”\n\n.\n\nIt wasn’t just one of the strangest songs written by John Lennon and performed by the Beatles. It remains one of the strangest popular songs ever written. It’s primarily nonsensical – on purpose.\n\n.\n\nAs you’ll see in the article below by Eddie Deezen (from the website Mental Floss, first published on April 24, 2012), John deliberately wrote it to be gibberish. It was partly a salute to one of his favorite childhood authors, Lewis Carroll, and his “Alice Through the Looking Glass” books. But it was also a practical joke – John attempting to write an odd song, with “off-the-wall” references, to skewer his critics, who would make themselves crazy trying to figure out what the seemingly random thoughts meant.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSo – I thought I would include it in my series of essays on “The Ones That Got Away: Songs That Tell the Truth” one that seems completely out of place: “I am the Walrus”\n\n.\n\nFirst: an article by Eddie Deezen (who I know primarily as Eugene, the Nerd, from the movie version of “Grease”). Discussing the reason John wrote the song and some of his references.\n\n.\n\nWho Was the Walrus? Analyzing the Strangest Beatles Song\n\n.\n\nBy Eddie Deezen (Mental Floss) April 24, 2012\n\n.\n\nEddie Deezen has appeared in over 30 motion pictures, including Grease (as Eugene), WarGames, 1941, and The Polar Express. He’s also been featured in several TV shows, including Magnum PI, The Facts of Life, and The Gong Show. And he’s done thousands of voice-overs for radio and cartoons, such as Dexter’s Laboratory and Family Guy.\n\n.\n\nhttp://mentalfloss.com/article/30523/who-was-walrus-analyzing-strangest-beatles-song\n\n.\n\nIn 1967, a student from Quarry Bank High School (Lennon’s alma mater) sent John Lennon a letter telling him his teacher was conducting a class analyzing the Beatles’ songs. Lennon was wryly amused. This letter served as the initial motivation for John to write a song that was beyond analysis for the simple reason that John didn’t want it to make any sense at all. The whole purpose of the song, according to John, was to confuse, befuddle, and mess with the Beatles experts.\n\n.\n\n.”Walrus is just saying a dream,” recalled John more than a decade after he composed it.\n\n.”The words didn’t mean a lot. People draw so many conclusions, and it’s ridiculous. I’ve had tongue in cheek all along–all of them had tongue in cheek. Just because other people see depths of whatever in it…What does it really mean, ‘I am the Eggman?’ It could have been ‘The pudding Basin’ for all I care. It’s not that serious.”\n\n.\n\n.John also wanted to make a point about fellow musical icon Bob Dylan, who, according to John, had been “getting away with murder.” John said he wanted to show his fans that he “could write that crap too.”\n\n.\n\n.”I Am The Walrus,” the song with no rhyme or reason, was written in three parts: part one was written by John during an acid trip, part two was written during another acid trip the next week, and part three was “filled in after [he] met Yoko.”\n\n.\n\n.Meaningless gibberish or not, many of the song’s lyrics did have an inspiration.\n\n.The song’s opening verse, “I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together,” comes from the song “Marching to Pretoria,” which contains the lyric, “I’m with you as you’re with me and we are all together.”\n\n.\n\n. “See how they run, like pigs from a gun, see how they fly…” came the next week directly from John’s second acid trip.\n\n.\n\n. The song’s basic rhythm was actually inspired by a police siren. John heard an oscillating siren blaring in his neighborhood, and this beat served as the basic beat for the entire tune.\n\n.”Sitting in a English garden” refers to John’s garden in his Weybridge home, where he was living, frustrated and increasingly unhappy, with his first wife, Cynthia.\n\n.\n\n.The lyric “Waiting for the man to come” was written by John, but was amended with “waiting for the van to come” by John’s friend from his high school days, Pete Shotton, who was present during the song’s composition.\n\n.\n\n.The “elementary penguin” was used by John as a jab at those who “go around chanting Hare Krishna or put all their faith in one idol.” John admitted he had poet Allen Ginsburg in mind when he wrote the lyric. (Could he also have wanted to get a sly dig in at his bandmate George Harrison, who was enthralled by all things Indian and Hare Krishna?)\n\n.\n\n.Needing a bit for the song’s middle section, John asked his old pal Pete to recall a “sick” schoolboy poem the two used to recite together. Pete dredged up the old lyrics:\n\n.\n\n“Yellow matter custard, green slop pie,\n\nDripping from a dead dog’s eye,\n\nSlap it on a butty, ten foot thick,\n\nThen wash it all down with a cup of cold sick.”\n\n.\n\n.The constantly repeated and apparently nonsense lyrics “Goo goo gajoob” come from James Joyce’s “Finnegan’s Wake.” (The actual term Joyce used was “Goo goo goosth.”)\n\n.\n\n.Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass (one of John’s favorite books when he was a youth) gave Lennon the song’s title and recurring lyric, “I am the walrus.” In that book, Carroll included the poem “The Walrus and the Carpenter.” John, always the most political Beatle, had it “dawn on” him that the poem was Carroll’s comment on “the capitalist and worker system.”\n\n.\n\n.It wasn’t until later that John realized that the walrus was “the bad guy” in the poem and that he should have called the song “I am the Carpenter.”\n\n.\n\n.”But that wouldn’t have been the same, would it?” admitted John.\n\n.\n\n.Another apparent nonsense lyric was “Semolina Pilchard.” Many Beatles “experts” have interpreted this as referring to Detective Sergeant Norman Pilcher, who was becoming famous for his drug busts of famous musicians (after he had planted the drugs himself). John himself, along with his then-girlfriend Yoko, was to be arrested in a bust by Sergeant Pilcher a year later. John always insisted the marijuana found at his flat was planted. (Sergeant Pilcher later served six years in prison for his corrupt behavior.) But this “interpretation” may be entirely conjecture, as John can clearly be heard singing “Semolina Pilchard,” not Pilcher. A “pilchard” is defined as one of “various small marine fishes relating to a herring.” It is a commercially edible species of fish. The line may just simply be another bit of Lennon-esque gibberish and wordplay.\n\n.\n\n.“I am the egg man” has been interpreted as referring to Humpty Dumpty (who appears in John’s beloved “Alice in Wonderland” books). Eric Burden, a popular singer/musician and a close friend of John, has claimed that he was “the egg man,” …\n\n.\n\n. The song’s closing features a snippet from a BBC Radio broadcast of Shakespeare’s King Lear, which John happened to hear when he was working on the song.\n\n.\n\n.At the song’s conclusion, the entire chorus (8 males and 8 females) join in. John said the guys sang “Oompah oompah, stick it in your jumper,” while the girls sang “Everybody’s got one.” But according to Beatles expert Mark Lewisohn (a highly reliable source), the chorus was entirely random with both men and women joining in on each of the two lyrics.\n\n.\n\n.”I Am The Walrus” was the first song the Beatles recorded after the death of their manager, Brian Epstein. (Brian died of a drug overdose on August 27, 1967, and the recording of “I Am The Walrus” came mostly in early September of ’67.)\n\n.\n\n. Engineer Geoff Emerick was never to forget “the look of emptiness on their faces when they were playing.”\n\n.\n\n.”I Am The Walrus” was released on November 24, 1967. It was the B-side of the Beatles single featuring Paul’s “Hello Goodbye” as the A-side. John was always angered by this decision, maintaining that “Walrus” was a far superior song.\n\n.\n\n.A filmed sequence of “I Am The Walrus” was to be featured in the Beatles TV movie, Magical Mystery Tour, later that year. It remains the only film of John singing the song. For this reason, Paul has said Magical Mystery Tour has “a special place in [his] heart.”\n\n.\n\n.”I Am The Walrus” was banned by the BBC because of the nonsense lyric “Girl, you let your knickers down.”\n\n.\n\n.To be fair, “Walrus” is definitely a strange song, but it may not actually be “the strangest Beatles song.” That honor perhaps should go to their 1967 song “You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)” or, better yet, John’s 1968 “Revolution #9.”\n\n.\n\n. But heck, who would have wanted to read an article about “the Beatles’ second (or third) strangest song”?

I think surreal is definitely an appropriate descriptive word for it, both musically and lyrically. I’m not going to try to “unscrew the inscrutable”- that’s falling into John’s trap in this attempt at something that is random and meaningless. My goal is to unravel the truth that somehow got twisted into this odd tapestry of a song.\n\n.\n\nJohn’s attempt at meaninglessness is, for the most part, meaningless. I’ll leave most of it as it is – you can re-read Eddie Deezen above (which, I think, is a great summary of something that was written to defy summary). But John forgot – or, more likely – refused to recognize the fact that there is no such thing as true randomness. This is one of the basic fallacies of atheistic evolution: the chance events that allegedly govern existence don’t actually occur. Despite the frantic search for true randomness, it has never been found. What’s even worse is this: the more we find out – scientifically – about the natural world, the LESS random it becomes.\n\n.\n\nThink about it: ten to fifteen years ago, scientists who were mapping and studying DNA predicted that there was such a thing as “junk DNA” – DNA that had no function. Scientists as well-known as Francis Crick (who, along with his partner, James Watson, discovered the shape of DNA in 1953) postulated that there HAD to be junk DNA – just on the basis of logic along, a LOT of DNA MUST be no longer functioning. After all the changes that must have occurred in DNA over billions of years, some of the information carried on it MUST be useless – Right?\n\n.\n\n. Right?\n\n.\n\n. Well – it wasn’t to be. Just like the frantic search for vestigial organs a few generations back, that led to many being listed, the list just kept getting shorter and shorter as we found out more and more functions for them. From an absurd belief at one time that the pituitary gland was vestigial (it’s the central control on just about everything in our internal environment), we have come to the point where – if we’re really honest, there are none.\n\n.\n\n. NONE?\n\n.\n\n. That’s right – vestigial organs really don’t exist … they never did exist. Every organ… every tissue… every normal cell… has a function. Every cell in our body even knows where it is, in relation to all the other cells in the body. You can live without an appendix, but you’re ultimately better off with it – it is part of your body’s defense system against disease and helps maintain the microbial environment of your upper large intestine.\n\n.\n\n. There also no such thing as “junk DNA”: it all has functions, even if it doesn’t all code for proteins. The regulatory functions of much of our DNA are only now being uncovered.\n\n.\n\n. So – what about inside of cells? Isn’t there a certain level of randomness, or lack of order, as you get smaller and smaller? The answer, again, is a resounding NO! The deeper we get into cell function, the MORE order we find. The search for true randomness is as elusive as trying to “catch a cloud and pin it down.” It’s like Peter Pan trying to catch his shadow: the closer you seem to get, the more impossible the task becomes.\n\n.\n\nSo – did John Lennon really write a meaningless song? I think he tried – but the task, again, is not possible. Now, because we define words with meaning and grammar, we could just throw out random words that make no sense. But John was trying to make a twisted kind of sense – and, as so often happens, truth made its way out.\n\n.\n\n.The opening of the song “Marching To Pretoria,” a song made famous by the Weavers and The Smothers Brothers is this:\n\n.\n\n“I’m with you and you’re with me and So we are all together.”\n\n.\n\n.John starts “I Am the Walrus” like this:\n\n.\n\n.“I am he as you are he as you are me And we are all together”\n\n.\n\n. Almost the same – but the differences are significant. Let’s back up a bit. There are people who say that the success of the Beatles was more than just their natural musical talents. There are those who say that John Lennon, before they became the immense rock idols that they were, sold his soul to the devil in exchange for some supernatural help. This kind of accusation is not uncommon or unprecedented – Niccolo Paganini, for example, was rumored to have made a similar transaction in the early 1800’s. I have no doubt that many modern celebrities have made such deals. Whether John actually signed a contract with Satan in… red … can’t be absolutely proven. But there are a number of bad signs…\n\n.\n\n. We know that Liverpool had a reputation as a place where demonic activity occurred (including séances at the Cavern Club, the well-known place where the Beatles started. We know that John abused drugs, especially LSD, and frequently – quite openly, even in THIS song – encouraged those who followed him to use it. “Strawberry Fields Forever” and “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” are loaded with psychedelic imagery, to name two. He was so obsessed with Aleister Crowley, called “The Wickedest Man Who Ever Lived”, that he put his picture in the crowd behind the Beatles on the iconic cover of “Sgt. Pepper’s”. If John weren’t possessed by a demon, he sure was heavily demon influenced.\n\n.\n\nSo, of course, we shouldn’t be surprised at John’s attempt at blasphemy to start this song. After all – who else refers to Himself as “I AM?” He is clearly referencing the covenant name of Yahweh, which He gave to Moses in Exodus Chapter 3. Specifically, Yahweh means “I AM WHO I AM” or “I WILL BE WHO I WILL BE.” Yahweh introduces Himself to Moses as the Self-Existent One. Jesus used that to reference Himself as equally God with Yahweh. He often used “I AM” – not just as the extremely common construction it is, but also to proclaim His Deity. When He used “I AM” in that way, the Jewish leaders (most of whom hated Him) knew EXACTLY what He meant. That’s why they wanted to stone Him in John 8 – He said, ”Before Abraham was, I AM.” That would have been blasphemous out of the lips of any other man – but out of the mouth of the Messiah, it was perfectly true.\n\n.\n\n.There was even one occasion where Jesus said “I AM HE,” claiming to be co-equal with Yahweh. It was in John 18, just as his enemies, led by the traitor, Judas, came to arrest Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.\n\n.\n\n.Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, “Whom do you seek?” 5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am he.” Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. 6 When Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground. 7 So he asked them again, “Whom do you seek?” And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.” 8 Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.” 9 This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: “Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.”\n\n..\n\nThe passage tells us why He did it: so they would let the disciples escape. It was He, and he alone, who would be arrested “to give His life a ransom for many.” He also did it to show everyone there who was REALLY in control of the situation: He, the Messiah, was in complete control. He turned Himself in willingly to “become sin for us – For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (2 Corinthians 5:21)\n\n.\n\n. I think John was doing one of two things with that opening line. First, he made himself the mouthpiece of Satan by claiming to be God – I believe it was ANOTHER attempt by Satan to claim the Godhood he so desires. He mockingly mixes up the words – they are confusing – in a way, claiming to have a Trinitarian identity like Elohim. Satan is NOT “God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit”, but he tries to make it sound like he is. Ever the deceiver, Satan doesn’t quite say it – while he says it. He failed once again to BE God. He’s nothing but a god – a fake, but a dangerous one.\n\n.\n\n. Second: John is saying something that sounds vaguely Hindu. “We are all together” is something like the Hindu idea (that John allegedly rejected) that “we are all ONE.” That, by the way, has no place in Christian dogma – Elohim is One, but we are not. He created us as individuals, with individual personhoods that will live forever.\n\n.\n\n. After his attempt at blasphemy to start things off, later John less than subtly promotes LSD by referencing to “Lucy in the Sky” – “With Diamonds”, the song he claims was not about LSD, which is clearly about LSD.\n\n.\n\n. Just two more points: here’s where the truth gets (inadvertently) told. John says this, as the song approaches its end:\n\n.\n\n.Expert, texpert choking smokers\n\nDon’t you think the joker laughs at you\n\nAnd then he laughs –“Hee, hee, hee, ha, ha, ha!”\n\n.\n\nDid John mean to tell the truth here? I’m not sure he knew what he was doing – or, maybe that was John, bursting through, trying to get some truth out in this attempt at complete (or semi-complete) gibberish. He addresses experts – the “smart people” who think they’re far and away so mentally superior to the dumb cretins who will try to spend hours upon hours trying to figure out what message John is sending. John is addressing these people who think they know everything and are smarter than everybody else. But, inadvertently (or not), he calls them fools.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWHAT?\n\n.\n\nNo – not the elites who are “so above” being drawn into John’s alleged trap! Yes, they’re the ones John – and Elohim, who is really in control of John’s words – is calling fools. How? By pointing out that these so-called experts are “choking smokers”. John himself smoked, as (I believe) did all of the Beatles. They thought they were being so sophisticated by doing it… now, today, we know what fools they are. “Thinking themselves wise, they became fools.” Even in a song where John thinks he’s playing an extended joke, the truth comes to light. With all that we know now about smoking – and they did know it at the time – isn’t rich irony: the “smart people”. The experts, are destroying their own health – for what? To look “cool”? Isn’t that the depth of stupidity?\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnd he goes on to further indict these “experts” – he says: “Don’t you think the joker laughs at you?” Now – it shouldn’t take long, especially after the most recent series of Batman movies, to understand who “the joker” is. Yes, he’s Batman’s most evil, diabolical villain, but who is he REALLY supposed to represent? Why, of course – the Joker character is Satan Incarnate, isn’t he? And that Joker on the playing cards (who the original Joker in the Batman comics looked exactly like) sure has a strong resemblance to what we think Satan looks like, doesn’t he? Well – the “joker” in the song, whether John was conscious of it or not, is really Satan. And he states a sad reality: “Don’t you think the devil laughs at you?”\n\n..\n\nThat’s the most basic, profound truth about those who turn away from Yahweh, who reject His Son, Jesus the Messiah. They think they are the intelligent ones… they scorn and mock those who are believers in the Savior and have accepted His sacrifice on the cross to forgive our sins. To these intelligent mockers: don’t you know your puppet master laughs at you? You think you’re so smart and sophisticated (while you stupidly choke on your cigarette), so much smarter than these idiot “Christians”. The one who has deceived you into serving him, while you think you’re so independent, is really laughing at you. Satan’s minions, who are legion, are the marionettes; those of us who love Jesus, who you mock and ridicule, are the ones who are truly free.\n\n.\n\n.John Lennon realized, later in life, what a fool he had been. Maybe he was about to turn on his master – who knows? Maybe that’s why his assassin, another one of Satan’s minions, took him out. We won’t know, at least in this life.\n\n.\n\nBut, my “wise’ friend: you still have an opportunity, if you’re still alive and reading this. All Satan promises are lies; all he delivers is anguish, despair – and true slavery. Elohim, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, also known by His covenant name, Yahweh, who loved the world so much that He gave us poor wretched sinners His only Son, Jesus (in Hebrew, the precious Yeshua ha Mashiach!) to pay the price on the cross – the just, paying the penalty of death for the unjust – so that, simply by putting our trust in him, we can live with Him forever.\n\n.\n\nHe made it really easy: He said “Repent and believe the gospel.” Repent means to humbly confess your sins to Him – like I did, like all believers do – and believe what is in the paragraph above. THAT’S the real good news!\n\n."
