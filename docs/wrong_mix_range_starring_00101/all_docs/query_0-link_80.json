        "text": "May Pang’s name is well-known to music fans as the woman John Lennon was romantically involved with in the early 1970s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Pang wrote the book Loving John, and now she’s telling of her time with Lennon in the documentary The Lost Weekend: A Love Story, which screened at several theaters in the Philadelphia region.\n\nMany of the photos included in the film are part of “The Lost Weekend: The Photography of May Pang” at City Winery Philadelphia from 1-5 p.m. April 15 and 1-4 p.m. April 16. Pang, 72, will also be there.\n\nThe movie, directed by Eve Brandstein, Richard Kaufman, and former University of Pennsylvania film professor Stuart Samuels, takes it title from the 1945 Ray Milland film Lennon used to refer to the time he and Pang spent in Los Angeles . Their drunken escapades with Harry Nilsson and Alice Cooper made headlines.\n\nThe story the movie tells, though, is of a loving 18-month relationship during a mostly sober, productive period in Lennon’s solo career.\n\nPang, the daughter of Chinese immigrants who grew up in New York’s Spanish Harlem, worked for Apple Records as Lennon and Ono’s assistant, starting in 1970. After three years, Pang says Ono approached her to suggest she begin a relationship with her husband, reasoning that if Lennon was going to have an affair, it should be with someone she knew. (Ono hasn’t denied the story.)\n\nShe spoke from her home in New York. This conversation has been edited.\n\nWhy make this movie now?\n\nOnly because I let it go for many years. You have all these storylines, the things that are being said, and they’re not the truth. And it just gets to you. You want to stop people saying, “I know everything about you.” I said, “No, you don’t. You read about it, but that doesn’t mean it’s true.”\n\nWhat’s got under your skin?\n\nThat Yoko sent us to Los Angeles. She had no idea that John and I went to Los Angeles. Another one was that when John performed with Elton John in New York that he went back to the Dakota the next day. No, we spent time together. We had Julian [Lennon’s son from his marriage to his first wife, Cynthia] and we went down to Florida. He signed the paperwork that marked the dissolution of the Beatles in Florida. I took the only photograph [of that].\n\nI’m part of the last jam session that John and Paul did together and also John’s only number one hit single. I’m also the one who’s whispering “John” in “#9 Dream.”\n\nAnother one was that he was drunk all the time, which isn’t true.\n\nThe movie makes the case that it was a significant love story. Why was it important to you now?\n\nIt becomes important because everybody thought it was a fling, or it was only a weekend. A lot of people didn’t realize we continued to be friends and close, and stayed in touch, until the time that he died.\n\nJulian speaks of you tenderly in the movie. What’s your relationship like?\n\nI’m very protective of him. His mother and I became very close. [She and John] didn’t have closure when they split up. So here I am in the middle of this and I said to John, “You have to work it out.” And they did, and it made Julian’s life easier. That was important to me.\n\nI knew you were John and Yoko’s assistant but had never heard that the affair was her idea. Were you weirded out?\n\nAre you kidding? Of course it was weird. I couldn’t believe what she was asking. I had been there for three years. I never thought about John that way. I was really happy just to work. Because I was so interested in the business of music and so happy to be in the studio. She said, “But you don’t have a boyfriend.” Well there’s a reason why: I’m working!\n\nYou come off as the grown-up in the room. But you were in your early 20s. How did you become that person?\n\nIt’s my mom. She gave me the courage to be on my own and instilled a lot of confidence in me. And the other thing is I wasn’t a drinker, I didn’t take drugs. It didn’t entice me.\n\nAre you concerned people will think you’re being petty, portraying Yoko as manipulative?\n\nI know what you’re saying. I don’t know whether her actions were manipulative or not. Those were her actions. I’m not making a commentary on it. I’m just telling the story of what went on in my life at that moment.\n\nFirst off, it made me chuckle. And then I was very honored, I was flattered.\n\nNo, that was later. He took the train down there on his own. He told Larry, “I may have been the happiest I’ve ever been” when he was with me. Larry said, “Well then why aren’t you with her?” And he said, “It’s complicated.”\n\nWas John the great love of your life?\n\nI would consider him the great love of my life. Never mind that it was John Lennon — he was the first person that I lived with who opened up a lot of doors for me to explore things together. We had a magnificent time."
