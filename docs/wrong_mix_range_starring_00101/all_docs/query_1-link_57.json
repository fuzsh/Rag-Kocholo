        "text": "Since it opened in December of 1959, the Second City has been a foundational part of American comedy. Not only has Second City essentially defined improvisational theater and comedy for decades, but as a training school it's also produced some of the greatest comedians of the past 50 years, with countless Oscar winners, Broadway stars, film directors, and showrunners coming out of the theaters in Chicago and later, Toronto. The self-deprecating name of the theater — Chicago is \"second\" to NYC — underplays the tremendous influence it's had on comedy and, really, all entertainment. Second City's been a feeder system for \"Saturday Night Live\" since the show began, had its own TV show, \"SCTV,\" from 1976-84 and is known for turning out multi-talented actor/comedian/singers like Martin Short, who celebrates his 70th birthday this week. Let's take a look at just a few of the many legends who have come out of Second City.\n\n5 of 25\n\nEugene Levy\n\nPhoto by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Critics Choice Association\n\nThe first-ever cast of The Second City Toronto featured Eugene Levy, who was also a mainstay on the first cast of “SCTV,” winning two Emmys for writing. Levy was and is known for his range of strange, fully realized supporting characters, as well as his musical chops, which got him a Grammy in 2003 for “A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow.” Yes, Eugene Levy has a Grammy! More than almost any other Second City alum, Levy has made improv a central part of his later career, especially in his collaborations with Christopher Guest in “Waiting For Guffman,” “Best In Show,” and more. Most recently he got an Emmy nomination for his performance on “Schitt’s Creek,” the show he co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in with his son, Dan Levy.\n\n18 of 25\n\nTina Fey\n\nPhoto by Jason Merritt/Getty Images\n\nTina Fey was working at a YMCA during the day and taking Second City classes at night when she started out in comedy, and by 1994 she was part of the touring company. By 1996 she was on the main stage, by 1997 she was working for SNL and by 1999, she was the head writer. After she took over as Weekend Update anchor, she began to emerge as a performer, later creating, writing and starring in the all-time great sitcom \"30 Rock.\" She has almost too many credits to list, but there's \"Mean Girls\" the movie and musical, \"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" \"Baby Mama,\" the bestseller \"Bossypants\" and the upcoming Pixar film \"Soul,\" which she both wrote and starred in."
