Hollywood stars Lindsay Lohan and Jared Leto have signed on to star in an independent film about the murder of legendary Beatles musician John Lennon 25 years ago.

Lohan, 19, will star in the movie Chapter 27, as a devoted Lennon fan who befriends the singer's assassin, Mark David Chapman, played by Leto, on the weekend in December 1980 that he shot the star to death, Daily Variety said today.

Leto, 33, has had roles in the 1999 hits Girl, Interrupted, which starred Winona Ryder, and Brad Pitt's cult favourite The Fight Club, while Lohan had starred in Disney family movies including Freaky Friday and this year's Herbie Fully Loaded, as well as in last year's Mean Girls.

Chapter 27 is to be produced by Robert Salerno and Naomi Despres through their Artina Films production company.

Lennon was gunned down by the deranged Chapman on December 8, 1980 as he returned home to his New York apartment with his wife Yoko Ono.

The Beatles co-founder was just 40 when he died.

He is seen as one of the greatest musical icons of the 20th century, with his songs, including Imagine and Strawberry Fields Forever, often ranked among the best songs in popular music history.

Chapman, now 50, a former drug addict who suffered from mental illness, remains behind bars in a New York State prison.
