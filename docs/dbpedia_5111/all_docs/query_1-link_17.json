        "text": "Previous Format: Stunting (Was Sports “98.7 The Fan” until December 4, 2014) WHFS-FM New Format: Variety Rock “Bubba 98.7” WBRN-FM Date & Time Of Change: February 2, 2015 at 10:00am More Info: RadioInsight, Wikipedia Related Changes: 98.7 The Fan Signs-Off\n\nPrevious Format: Hot AC “Play 98.7” WSJT New Format: Sports “98.7 The Fan” WHFS Date & Time Of Change: August 2, 2012 at 12:00pm More Info: RadioInsight, Wikipedia This aircheck features the end of “Play 98.7” at 11am, a brief snippet of the stunting and the history of sports in Tampa Bay that led into the 12pm launch of “The Fan”\n\nInfinity Broadcasting’s Outlaw Country 92.5 (WYUU, licensed to Safety Harbor, FL) found itself as the third country station in a two country station market when Clear Channel’s Thunder 103.5 (WTBT) flipped to Country as U.S. 103.5 (WFUS) on April 14, 2005. With Infinity co-owned WQYK also playing country in the market, it became obvious to many observers that something had to give, particularly with country stations out of Polk County and Sarasota edging into the fringes of the Tampa/St. Petersburg/Clearwater market. On August 7, 2005, WYUU flipped formats following its broadcast of the Indianapolis Brickyard 400 NASCAR race. After three commercials, this announcement told listeners that a new format had come to the signal: La Nueva 92.5, The Latin Sound of Tampa Bay. Aircheck ...\n\nMired with a subpar signal and being one of two Oldies stations in the market did not allow WSUN to take off in the Tampa Bay area. While rumors of Cox flipping the station to All-80’s ran rampant, the station began stunting with music from 2001: A Space Oddysey. At 5:00pm on November 3, 2000, the Tampa Bay area got its first taste at an Alternative station in many years with the debut of 97X. The first song, Hemhorrage by Fuel was dedicated to Modern AC WSSR and Active Rocker WXTB, both of whom are owned by competitor Clear Channel Communications."
