        "text": "Post by mst3k on\n\nHard to tell at this point... Wild has the benefit of being an established station, with a very popular morning show and great personalities. So far The Beat is music only, we'll have to see what happens after they play their \"10,000th joint in a row\".\n\nOne positive to come out of it is that FLZ is no longer Clear Channel's main competitor against Wild, so their playlist is becoming a bit more balanced.\n\nPost by tico on\n\nmst3k1 said:\n\nOne positive to come out of it is that FLZ is no longer Clear Channel's main competitor against Wild, so their playlist is becoming a bit more balanced.\n\nI figured that would happen. Speaking of balanced playlists, maybe it's me but it does seem like some Clear Channel CHRs are becoming more balanced. KHTS is slightly less rhythmic than it has been and WDBT/Jackson is definitely much more mainstream that what it was when it first came out.\n\nPost by jimmy74747 on\n\ntico said:\n\nI figured that would happen. Speaking of balanced playlists, maybe it's me but it does seem like some Clear Channel CHRs are becoming more balanced. KHTS is slightly less rhythmic than it has been and WDBT/Jackson is definitely much more mainstream that what it was when it first came out.\n\nWKSS in Hartford has also becomed more balanced in the last two or so years (at least since 93.7 became rhythmic)\n\nPost by ct2874 on\n\nFrom what I read in the format change article in one of\n\nthe local papers, a CC rep stated that the shift for WSSR\n\nwas that they wanted to cater to \"an untapped\n\nmarket\". Question: doesn't this market already have\n\nWLLD and WTMP that play to similar audiences? May-\n\nbe they meant it as an untapped market for Clear\n\nChannel listeners, but if that's the case, how come\n\nCC doesn't have a country station as well? Things\n\nthat make you go hmmm.....\n\nSpeaking of country stations here in the Tampa Bay\n\narea, WYUU has tweaked their format a little and\n\nnow calls themselves \"Renegade Country\". Here's\n\nwhat boggles me--while flipping from 620AM to\n\nFM on my walkman (it lands on 92.5), I'm hearing\n\n\"Legs\" by ZZTop. My first thought is, \"great, now we\n\nhave a fourth classic rock station (along with Thunder\n\n103.5, 102.5 Real Classic Rock, and 107.3 the Bay,\n\nwhich is classic lite rock).\" Then I hear whoever the\n\nDJ was state \"92.5 Outlaw Country...\" OK, hold up\n\nhere, since when was ZZTop considered a country\n\nartist? I know they're from Texas, but come on,\n\nthis is ridiculous. I'm not a country fan by any stretch\n\nof the imagination, but if I were, I would consider this\n\nmove by Infinity Broadcasting as a slap in the face.\n\nThis in my opinion is another reason as to why other\n\nthan 99.5WQYK-FM and Oldies 104.5, Infinity Tampa\n\nBay looks clueless when it comes to their radio stations."
