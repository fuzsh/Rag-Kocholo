        "text": "Beasley Media Group has selected a new director of non-traditional revenue sales for its Tampa Bay cluster. Voncile Anderson began in Tampa radio as a promotions director for WRBQ(FM). She also has a background in event production.\n\nHer expanded sales responsibilities, including “assessing the area’s special event opportunities, and determining the venues with greatest potential to grow revenue for the Tampa Bay cluster,” according to a press release.\n\n“I like to say I have earned ‘market equity’ because I have invested my entire career doing events that entertain, raise money for charities, and help our Tampa Bay businesses grow,” said Anderson.\n\nIn the Tampa/St. Petersburg/Clearwater radio market, Beasley Media Group owns five FMs and one AM: WLLD(FM); WQYK(FM); WRBQ(FM); WYUU(FM); WBRN(FM); and WHFS(AM)."
