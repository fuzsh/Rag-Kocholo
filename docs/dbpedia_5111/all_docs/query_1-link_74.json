        "text": "• Beasley Media Group and Nio Fernandez have mutually inked a multiyear renewal to retain Fernandez as Director of Latin Formats, overseeing all Latino brands for the company while also retaining his day-to-day programming duties at WYUU (92.5 Maxima)/Tampa.\n\n“The most important part of building the only Multicultural cluster in Tampa is finding and keeping the best people,” said VP/Market Manager Ron deCastro. “Nio is an important figure in the Hispanic and overall Tampa community. He understands this area like no one else. I’m glad that we can keep Nio at Maxima, Playa and Beasley into the future.”\n\nFernandez remarked, “2024 marks my 15th year with WYUU in Tampa, and working closely with Beasley Media Group on the expansion of their Hispanic footprint has been one of the great honors of my life. The commitment the organization has made to serve Spanish language audiences is an important one, and I’m proud to contribute and work alongside the Beasleys in every way possible.”"
