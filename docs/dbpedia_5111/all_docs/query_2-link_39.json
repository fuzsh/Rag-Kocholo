        "text": "Increasing Access to Clean Drinking Water for the indigenous Wayuu people\n\nThe Chelsea Rotary Club is cooperating with the Fonseca Club in La Guajira, Colombia on a new global grant to bring clean drinking water to the villages of the indigenous Wayuu people on the Guajira peninsula. The area where the Wayuu live is a desert climate and there are over 350,000 indigenous people in this northern peninsula in Colombia. Over 5,000 indigenous children have died in the last few years from lack of water and other diseases derived from lack of water.\n\nOur objective is to build 24 wells that will serve around 7,000 indigenous people, including children. Children and their mothers are the ones who are searching for water, on an everyday basis, they have to walk, ride mules for miles in search of water.\n\nFor more information, and a photo gallery from a previous water project we did in the same region, please click here to view our project page in the NEPETS House of Friendship."
