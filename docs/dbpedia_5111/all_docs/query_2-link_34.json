In this place, water and food are scarce, and child mortality rates are very high. Despite hardships, they preserve a culture of resilience thanks to their tradition of oral storytelling.\nDrawing from the tradition of storytelling, the works of writer Gabriel García Márquez, particularly his Magical Realism, serve as a source of inspiration. His words dance on the line between fantasy and harsh realities, mirroring the delicate balance the Wayuu people navigate.\nThis research is guided by architects like Francis Kere, Doshi, Gregory Burgess, Toshiko Mori, and Jane Drew, as well as the writings of Frampton and Moholy-Nagy. Their work integrates sustainable practices, celebrates cultural narratives through innovative forms, and adapts traditional techniques and materials to contemporary challenges.\nTheir design principles are applied to translate structures and patterns from Wayuu’s musical stories into form and space. Based on Wayuu music, key rhythms will inform spatial arrangements, while tonal qualities will inspire materials and surface patterns. By translating these musical stories into design elements, the Wayuu spirit is celebrated architecturally.\nThis research highlights the importance of the Wayuu culture beyond a mere academic pursuit, serving as a platform to break silence, raise awareness, and share the rich heritage of the researcher. 'From Silence to Thriving: Architecture as a Voice for the Wayuu Tribe,' aims to use architecture as a tool for social change that will offer a shedding light on a culture that deserves to thrive.",
