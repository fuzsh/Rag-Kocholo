Nandy and Cristy have been hosting the program since 2018. Nandy, a native of Puerto Rico and Cristy, originally from Mexico, will continue to bring their Hispanic cultures to the Latin station.\n\n\"Nandy & Cristy have proven to be a great representation of Tampa Bay's Hispanic community and moreover, have solidified themselves as part of the area's Latino culture and lifestyle,\" remarked Beasley's Director of Latin Formats and WYUU Program Director Nio Fernandez. \"Their daily success has forged a following consisting of hundreds of thousands and we couldn't be prouder to have them as 92.5 MAXIMA's morning show for the next half a decade.\""
