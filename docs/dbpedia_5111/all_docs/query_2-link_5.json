        "text": "LOCATION:\n\nThis indigenous people are located in La Guajira in northern Colombia, and they are also present in the state of Venezuela in Zulia. The Wayuu tribe represent 20% of the national indigenous population, 48% of the population of La Guajira and 8% of the population.\n\nLANGUAGE:\n\nIts native language is Wayuunaiki.\n\nHISTORY:\n\nOn the history of the Wayúu people, the information sources available prior to the Colony are little more than the Spanish chronicles, which report that they had an organizational structure based on clans, with high degrees of population mobility, and with an extended practice of hunting and fishing. All these characteristics that are maintained in different degrees today.\n\nWhen the contact with the Spanish culture occurred, the Wayuú people adopted grazing and increased the time spent in their places of residence. Gradually, trade became an important factor for obtaining goods and additionally it became a mechanism of relationship with immigrant cultures.\n\nThe struggles for territorial control were a characteristic factor of contact with Europeans and generated social ruptures within the town. After the establishment of the republic, Catholic missions were present in the territory, however, the Wayuú culture remained strong through the years.\n\nIts recent history is characterized by oil exploitation, the opening of the coal mine in Cerrejón and the Alta Guajira seaport, which occurred in the 1980s.\n\nThe exploitation of natural resources has caused problems for the people Wayuú, because of the work dependency they generate. The struggle for territorial control between armed groups outside the law has also been a constant in its recent history.\n\nOur young artisans, they loved to be photographed\n\nThe burial is in charge of the women, who prepare the deceased: they collect him, bathe him and place him in the coffin and then be exhumed two years later for cremation.\n\nThe social organization of the Wayuú people is strongly associated with their cosmogonic principles and modes of mythical representation.\n\nSome of our most skilled artisans\n\nSince they explain the reality of the group and individuals and are also conferred prophetic powers.\n\nWayuú society has a complex structure, it is matrilineal in nature and has about 30 clans, each with its own territory and its own totem animal.\n\nWithin the extended family, the highest authority corresponds to the maternal uncle, who intervenes in all family and domestic problems.\n\nWithin the nuclear family, children are led practically by the mother's brother and not by the biological father himself.\n\nKanaas is the maximum expression of wuayúu weaving, it is a very old art, probably originating in Alta Guajira. It consists of a fabric of stylized geometric figures, representing elements of the natural environment that surround the daily life of the wuayúu.\n\nThe more complex the figures, the more value the piece acquires. It is woven on a pitchfork loom. Each kanaas have a name and meaning.\n\nThe chinchorro (type of hammock) and hammock are the most representative fabrics of the Wuayúu culture. Although the chinchorro and hammock have the same function, at the textile level they have marked differences; the first is elastic and loose-woven and the second is heavy and compact, made of a padded weave.\n\nThere are several kinds of mochilas (Wayuu bags):\n\nSusuchon; who bears the name hanging from the sash, one on each side of the guayuco (loincloth).\n\nSusu; the medium-sized daily mochila bag that the Wayúu carries everywhere.\n\nAinacajatu; a large Wayuu mochila where the woman carries the hammock, clothes and what is necessary for the trips.\n\nKapatera; the man's large Wayuu bag, a kind of cylindrical tube, with two mouths and closing cords that are also used as hanging racks.\n\nKattowi; a very resistant and multipurpose mesh Wayuu bag, to transport pots and cups full of water. Wayúu men make palm leaf hats, appropriate for days of intense sun, blankets and guaireñas or espadrilles (footwear made to withstand long days on the sand), among others.\n\nECONOMY\n\nArtisanal fishing and pastoralism constitute two traditional sectors of the economy. Given the conditions of their lands, the Wayúu develop a mixed economy, based on the breeding and grazing of goats and cattle (horses) combined with a specialized horticulture of corn, beans, yucca, squash, cucumbers, melons and watermelons, in addition to activities such as hunting.\n\nIn addition to being part of the food base and object of exchange, livestock - especially goats - have a cultural meaning that establishes it as a symbol of power, status and prestige.\n\nIndigenous families located on the western coast and who depend mainly on fishing, jealously preserve their rights to it.\n\nEach garden is owned by a man and he assigns his sons the right to use sections of the land. Each man cultivates his plot assisted by his wife.\n\nThe exploitation of salt in Manaure is also another source of subsistence, which is done in a mechanized or artisanal way; In this last, mainly an indigenous person participates using \"ponds\", from which he harvests two crops per year.\n\nSources of Information:\n\n-Culture Ministry.
