        "text": "Hi Radio Babe, Where did Thunder Classic Rock 103.5 move? I enjoy the Bob & Tom show and can't seem to locate it now! Help!!!! -- T.C.\n\nHey Radio Babe, The sudden change by 103.5 to the new country format caught a lot of us by surprise. I listen (did) to the Bob and Tom show in the morning. Now that Thunder is puffy southern clouds, is there another radio station in the metro marketplace that has picked them up? I spent 29 years in the TV news business and enjoy someone who actually has valid information to offer. Well done. -- R.D.\n\nHi and Hey T.C., R.D., and every other caller and e-mailer searching for this same information. The inquiries sure kept Radio Babe busy this week!\n\nThunder didn't move at all -- that rainstorm's \"puffy southern clouds\" dissipated altogether to reveal the new \"US 103-5 -- Tampa Bay's Best Country.\"\n\nThe station also applied for new call letters, so even the \"WTBT\" will dissolve soon. In fact, a new Web site, at www.us1035.com, is already up for online listening and newsletter sign-ups; the rest is under construction.\n\nClear Channel Tampa's programming vice president Brad Hardin temporarily takes on program director duties until someone permanent steps up.\n\nRadio Babe thinks Hardin's extra work prevented his response to R.B's 10-day-old phone and e-mail messages. Luckily, radio trade newsletters helped her ascertain that the entire Thunder staff was dismantled as well.\n\nWhere they've gone is anyone's guess.\n\nSOUND -- With no voices on 103.5, there's only music; so far that's been hits-based, straight mainstream country, a different mix than its two Infinity competitors spin. WYUU 92.5 FM, the \"Outlaw,\" targets a younger demographic by combining classic rock, too, and WQYK 99.5 FM is a heritage/\"classic\" country blend.\n\nWEAPON -- Clear Channel's US 103.5 does have one thing the others don't have, and that's Skip Mahaffey, perhaps it's secret weapon to becoming \"Tampa Bay's 'Best' Country.\"\n\nMahaffey, who quit WQYK the day before the US 103-5 announcement, is a Country Music Award winner. He won \"broadcast personality of the year\" in a major market for the years 1996, 2001 and 2003. He worked at WQYK -- 2001 CMA major market \"Station of the Year\" and nominated this year as well -- for five years.\n\n\"The Skip Mahaffey Show,\" 103.5's new morning program, is -- surprisingly -- sans Mahaffey! He's legally bound to a WQYK non-compete contract until October, when he'll join his already-in-progress program hosted by two former henchmen: Les McDowell (doing traffic) and Braden Gunn (doing sports), who also left WQYK and starts \"soon.\"\n\nTHE COMPETITION -- On WQYK mornings, Steve Austin (1010 AM weekends) and Rita Ciccarello (former morning news) scramble up a morning snack until a more permanent and, hopefully, satisfying, filler is hired.\n\nAustin and Gunn partnered on Saturday mornings for WQYK's 1010 AM \"The Buzz\" sports program \"Florida Outdoors with Steve and Tom.\" It's still listed on the station's Web site as 9 to 11 a.m. Saturday; however, its hyperlink is broken, leading R.B. to believe the show no longer exists.\n\nB. AND T. -- As for \"The Bob and Tom Show\" -- comedic award winners Bob Kevoian and Tom Griswold and crew -- well, that's the bad news.\n\nThe closest these 2005 National Radio Hall of Fame nominees (which just were announced last week) are is Fort Myers' WARO 94.5 FM, 5 to 10 a.m. weekdays.\n\nOutside of that, other Florida affiliates for this Indianapolis show are West Palm's WKGR 98.7 FM, Melbourne's WSJZ 95.9 FM, Panama City's WFBX 94.5 FM and Tallahassee's WUTL 106.1 FM.\n\nInternet listening is available at www.bobandtom.com or through radio station sites.\n\nR.H.O.F -- Other nominees for the Hall of Fame \"Network or Syndicated (Active)\" category are National Public Radio's Marian McPartland (ultra-talented musician/host of \"Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz\"), ABC News White House correspondent Ann Compton, and R.B.'s pal Dr. Laura Schlessinger (the relationship adviser).\n\nAnyone can become an \"e-member\" for $15 at the www.radiohof.org Web site in order to vote before the Aug. 1 deadline.\n\nDirect queries and comments to Radio Babe c/o the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, P.O. Drawer 1719, Sarasota FL 34230, or e-mail dawnzig@hotmail.com. Answers will appear in this forum only. Radio station listings appear in the Herald-Tribune's Sunday Showtime publication."
