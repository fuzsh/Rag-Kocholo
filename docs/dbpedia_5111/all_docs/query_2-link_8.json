        "text": "The Wayuu people inhabit the Guajira Peninsula, which takes in parts of Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nGiven the political situation in Venezuela, the best way to visit the Wayuu is through Colombia. The town of Riohacha serves as a gateway to the arid Guajira Peninsula, and the beautiful village at Cabo de la Vela.\n\nThe Wayuu are known as a hostile trading people who maintained a fierce independence from both Colombian and Venezuelan authorities. The advent of tourism brought them into closer contact with outsiders than ever, giving visitors the opportunity to understand the culture of the largest indigenous ethnic group in Colombia.\n\nWayuu people live in isolated homesteads known as rancherias, and are rarely found in towns. In this way, they prevent the mixing of their goat herds. Cabo de la Vela is one of the highest concentrations of population, and serves as a tourist hub.\n\nFrom Cabo de la Vela, head north to Punta Gallinas, the northernmost point of Colombia. The arid landscape unfolds underneath you, stretching down to Venezuela from the lighthouse, which makes for great photo opportunities.\n\nAlongside delicious lobster fishing, the Wayuu make amazing textiles and handicrafts which make great souvenirs. Get involved in a traditional Wayuu dinner of fried goat, music and dancing to experience the local way of life."
