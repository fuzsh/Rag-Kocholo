County D.A. and it targets Casey's widow Jean. This comes following an investigation that was launched after Casey's oldest children filed a police report claiming Jean caused Casey to get bed sores that became infected and contributed to his death. They claim Jean was more interested in keeping their dad from them than protecting him. Law enforcement sources told TMZ it's unlikely the D.A. will file charges against Jean because there's not enough available evidence. The kids have been fighting for a full autopsy but Jean has resisted. Reportedly, the D.A. says it does not have the case yet, but our LAPD sources say it has been submitted. Casey passed away on June 15th.\n\nMOTION: WGCI Chicago's 'Morning Riot' Cancelled; Kenard Karter Exits Programming Post\n\nTHE MOUTH, DECEMBER 2ND, 2014 –– Big changes came down yesterday at iHeartRadio Chicago as crm.com reported cuts at both WGCI-FM/107.5W GCI and WKSC-FM/103.5 Kiss FM.

FM radio should be replaced by digital radio within the next eight years in order to make more channels available for commercial networks and the country's public service broadcaster Sveriges Radio, reports thelocal.se It's not clear how ministers will react to the findings, with Prime Minister Stefan Löfven's party having previously argued against the digital radio switchover, saying it would be too expensive. Hundreds of sites around Sweden would require new specially designed radio masts. Writing in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper, Associate Professor Nina Wormbs from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology who led the study said: \"Radio is a form of media that should be given the best possible conditions in a democratic information society. It should have its own digital distribution platform that makes it possible for everyone to everywhere listen easily and without having to pay extra.\" Following the switchover, Sweden could host up to 60 digital radio stations, she argued. Opponents to the plan have raised concerns about adapting cars which are currently fitted with FM radios. They have argued that the move is unnecessary with increasing numbers of people already choosing to listen to radio stations via the internet, where there is no limit to the number of channels available to consumers.

'Every other station in the area is playing those Christmas songs. If you really want to hear them, tune across to them.” Gavin Harris, who runs Jack FM, added said: “I’m determined to give listeners what they would expect to hear. “I think they would expect to hear Christmas songs throughout December. We’ll be following suitable disciplinary procedures if need be, but I’m confident we’ll be playing Christmas Rapping, All I Want for Christmas and Stop the Cavalry before too long.” WHAT DO YOU THINK?

According to iowapublicradio.com, every week, a million and a half people are listening to this murder investigation unfold. It's from the creators of \"This American Life.\" Also unfolding is proof that more and more Americans are consuming audio this way.

This holiday favorite involves a (legal) break-in of a family in need's home and filling it with gifts galore - jobs, a cars often included. The concept's creator, Tommy Sablan tells Jockline it all started when hetold Jeff and Jer prior to 1996 'let's do something with the name Breaking and Entering Christmas. Then, one day on the air a man who just lost his job called us right before Christmas and was asking if we could find him a job or get him a job interview. He was a single dad with two little daughters. We got him the job interview that morning during the show and when he was gone, I broke into his home LITERALLY and set up a tree and bought bikes and groceries and that was the birth of Jeff and Jer's Breaking and Entering Christmas.\" Among the first shows to perform B&E with Sablan's blessing included Ace and TJ, MOJO in Detroit and The Kidd Kraddick Show. Now, there's stations in DC and Tulsa and Oklahoma City and many other markets. So, how do they set up the break-in? \"I get help from the person that usually tells us about the family. I get them out of the house by setting them up with breakfast at a nearby restaurant. When they leave, I go in. I go in several different ways, but what is cool about it is that I have the local police standing by helping out. So, it's like a reverse break in. The police department even guards the home when we leave and they patrol until the family comes home,\" says Sablan. 'Out of respect and to stay true to my role as the producer of Jeff and Jer, I always call it Jeff and Jer's Breaking and Entering Christmas, but Jeff and Jer out of respect to me, call it Little Tommy's Breaking and Entering Christmas. I believe it is one in the same now,\" he adds. Sablan jokes \"Breaking and Entering Christmas will be on my headstone when I die. I am so proud of this. It is so big that I have taught my two children how to do it in case I die. It will go on even when I am long gone ... My goal is to have this happen in every state. If you do a morning show, my email is Tommy@KyXy.com … I'll show you how to do it.\" Jeff and Jer Showgram on KyXy 96.5.
