        "text": "Introduction / History\n\nThe Wayuu are a clan of the greater Guajiro people who straddle Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nWhat Are Their Lives Like?\n\nWhen they become teenagers, girls are separated from boys and prepared by her aunt for marriage. She teaches the girl weaving skills and gives her plenty of a special tea that is intended to purge the girl of childish attitudes. After a couple of months, the girl is given a new name and there is the Chichimaya, a coming out party that starts with a fertility dance. The dancing becomes more playful at dusk when the boys dance backwards in a circle. They wave their hats daring the girls to catch them. Girls try to catch them and trip the boys by stepping on their feet.\n\nWhat Are Their Beliefs?\n\nLike other Guajiro people, the Wayuu combine Roman Catholicism with their traditional beliefs. They have a rain goddess. Yet they celebrate various Catholic holidays and baptize their babies. They are much more Christianized in Colombia than they are in Venezuela.\n\nWhat Are Their Needs?\n\nThe Wayuu people need hospitals and schools to take care of their needs.\n\nPrayer Points\n\nPray for the Wayuu and other Guajiro clans to have all their physical and spiritual needs met.\n\nPray for Wayuu disciples to make more disciples.\n\nPray for a Jesus-focused revival to come to all Catholic communities in Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nScripture Prayers for the Wayuu, Guajiro in Colombia.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayuu_people\n\nhttps://www.everyculture.com/wc/Tajikistan-to-Zimbabwe/Guajiros.html"
