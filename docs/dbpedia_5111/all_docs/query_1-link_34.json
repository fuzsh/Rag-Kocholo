        "text": "LA GUAJIRA, 10 July 2024 - Children from Colombia’s Indigenous Wayuu community have composed a powerful song to draw attention to the drought and water scarcity affecting their homeland and traditional way of life while demanding immediate action on climate change from policymakers, Save the Children said.\n\nThe song, titled \"We Are Asking for Water\", debuted as part of Save the Children’s new campaign \"Between the Sun and Water,” aimed at amplifying the voices of Wayuu children in northern Colombia ahead of COP16, a UN-backed summit on biodiversity in Colombia later this year.\n\nThe song features lyrics such as \"I swear it's not too late to start raising awareness... Let's take care of water. Let's take care of the earth. Let's make it a masterpiece,\" and also captures the children’s resilience and hopes for a sustainable future.\n\nJasay*, 10, from the Wayuu community in Colombia, said:\n\n\"Imagine a world where the sun shines brighter than ever and water is scarce. We want to be heard because climate change is affecting us greatly. Sometimes we can't go to school, other times we feel very tired, we can even faint. We call on decision-makers with budgetary power to do something that improves our lives.”\n\nFor centuries, the Wayuu people have lived off the land, however, a series of crippling droughts and heatwaves have recently devastated the environment, which is central to their culture and survival.\n\nExtreme weather events around the world are becoming more frequent and severe as a result of the climate crisis, with children born in 2020 facing on average seven times as many scorching heatwaves and 2.6 times more droughts than their grandparents, according to Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Save the Children.\n\nIn Colombia, only one in 30 Wayuu children living in rural areas has access to clean water. The water that is available is often taken from a ‘jaguey’, a natural aquifer which is reliant on rainwater and shared with livestock. This results in regular occurrences of diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases among children who drink the water.\n\nIn addition to the song, the children are using videos, radio spots, banners, and booklets, to speak out against climate change, amplify their urgent demands, and share their concerns with decision-makers in Colombia. Save the Children has engaged 48 children and young people from the Los Olivos Indigenous community in Ríohacha, the Perramana community in Maicao, and various migrant and host communities in Maicao through the campaign.\n\nLea, 17, from the Wayuu community said:\n\n\"We want children, adolescents like us, to have more opportunities to speak with the government, companies, and these very important entities — the main contributors to negative environmental impact — However, it's also crucial for decision-makers, authorities, and companies to demonstrate how to address the environmental issue, given that they have been primarily responsible for this impact — I ask them to remember children at COP16 in Cali,this is a stage to raise our voices.\"\n\nCOP16 will be held in Cali, Colombia, from21 October to1 November 2024, and will focus on negotiating the next steps to put the 2022 Kunming-Montreal agreement into action, which seeks to address the global decline in biodiversity, similar to how the Paris Agreement helps fight climate change.\n\nErika Guillen Yepez, Regional Manager for the Caribbean region at Save the Children, said:\n\n\"Although Indigenous and other traditional, rural peoples are the least responsible for climate change, they are often on the frontlines of its effects. The Wayuu community is facing water scarcity, which is being exacerbated by the climate crisis. The children’s new song ‘We are asking for water’ tells the story of their land, their struggles accessing clean water and their hopes with collective climate action.\n\n“Children in La Guajira want their voices heard. Through this campaign, we want to support them in getting their demands addressed because we are convinced that they are the Generation Hope.”\n\nIn Colombia, Save the Children is helping children from the Wayuu community learn about climate change and promote resilience. Save the Children's programmes have taught them how to address vital topics like waste management and deforestation using skills such as painting and filming.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean and across the world, Save the Children is working with governments to find ways to increase funding for climate policies and actions that protect children’s rights.\n\nSave the Children works with, and for children, putting their rights and views first, and supporting them to tell their governments and human rights bodies how their lives are impacted by climate change and environmental degradation, so those accountable understand their obligations to children.\n\nSave the Children is implementing climate programmes in over 50 countries and delivering direct climate action – from working with communities to adapt to climate changes impacting them now, to forecasting future emergencies and strengthening communities’ ability to anticipate, adapt, prepare, respond, and recover.\n\nENDS\n\nWe Are Asking for Water lyrics:\n\nVerse 1: So much sun, fever, and fainting\n\nBecause of the poor-quality water.\n\nIt all starts with conflict and strife\n\nCaused by what the adults have done.\n\nVerse 2: I swear it's not too late\n\nTo start raising awareness.\n\nYour contribution and mine make a difference.\n\nLet's take care of water, let's take care of the earth.\n\nLet's make it a masterpiece, all together.\n\nChorus X2: Every drop of water is unique and important.\n\nAs valuable as a diamond.\n\nIt enters our lives\n\nWith peace and joy, Generation Hope,\n\nThe force that guides us!\n\nBridge X2: Let's reflect so that\n\nWe can save the world.\n\nWith communities united, we can\n\nSearch for water.\n\nChorus (repeated): Every drop of water is unique and important,\n\nAs valuable as a diamond.\n\nIt enters our lives\n\nWith peace and joy, Generation Hope,\n\nThe force that guides us!\n\nVerse 3: If we don't drink water, we will get sick.\n\nIt won't benefit anyone.\n\nWater is running out, drought is coming.\n\nIt's time, change is happening.\n\nVerse 4: Rhythm and awareness, a vital combination\n\nAgainst climate change.\n\nA real battle!\n\nClean water,\n\nAn ideal ending to save the planet.\n\nA global challenge!\n\nNotes to Editor:\n\nMultimedia content available: www.contenthubsavethechildren.org/Package/2O4C2S0S02UA\n\n· Save the Children launched the \"Between the Sun and Water\" campaign with over 60 participants, including organizations like Football with Heart, Mulier Foundation, Wayuu Anashii Foundation, UNHCR, and various municipal authorities on 28 June 2024. The event highlighted the creative works of Wayuu children, amplifying their voices and ensuring their message reaches a national audience.\n\n******************************************************************************************************\n\nFor further enquiries please contact:\n\nSamantha Halyk, Senior Global Media Manager, Samantha.halyk@savethechildren.org\n\nMaria Gabriela Alvarado, Regional Media Manager, maria.alvarado@savethechildren.org\n\nOur media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409\n\nPlease also check our Twitter account @Save_GlobalNews for news alerts, quotes, statements and location Vlogs."
