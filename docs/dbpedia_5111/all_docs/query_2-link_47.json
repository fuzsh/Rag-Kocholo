        "text": "The Wayuu are indigenous peoples who live in the northern part of the Colombian and Venezuelan Caribbean.\n\nThis ethnic group is considered one of the largest indigenous communities in Colombia, with a descendant of more than 700,000 inhabitants.\n\nAlthough contact with European conquerors dates back to the 16th century, the Wayúu were not conquered until the independence of Colombia and Venezuela. This was influenced both by indigenous resistance and by the harsh environmental conditions of the desert, which served as a refuge for the Wayúu people.\n\nBut, who are the Wayuu indigenous people? How do they live now? Here we tell you everything about them!\n\nWayuu language\n\nWayuunaiki is the language of the Wayuu people. It is part of Arawak, a predominant language family in different parts of the Caribbean.\n\nThere are small dialect differences within the La Guajira region: the northern, central, or southern zones; but it is a language widely used by all Wayuu communities.\n\nMost of the younger generation are fluent in Spanish but understand the importance of preserving their traditional language.\n\nWayuunaiki is an oral language. It is passed down from generation to generation by telling stories about the origin of the earth, humans and animals. In summary, this language is a representation of the Wayuu vision: everything is touched by the vision of the world.\n\nWayuu life\n\nThe indigenous people feed on goats, chickens and fish, as well as legumes and vegetables that grow in the area.\n\nThey are dedicated to grazing. This activity gained great importance during the 16th and 17th centuries. From the 2nd century, it motivated the expansion and subjugation of the neighboring towns that also inhabited the peninsula in the extreme north of Colombia.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that La Guajira has important natural resources such as coal, gas and sea salt. Sea salt is cultivated by indigenous families who live in the vicinity of the Caribbean Sea.\n\nA traditional Wayúu settlement has five or six houses that form hamlets or ranches. Each ranchería is named after a plant, animal, or geographic location.\n\nA territory that contains many rancherías receives its name from the mother’s last name; that is, the society is matrilineal. The Wayúu congregated in ranches are usually isolated and far from each other to avoid mixing their herds of goats.\n\nTraditional Wayuu music is closely linked to the economy and social life. For example, they sing to their cattle.\n\nThey also use music for meetings and celebrations, as well as mourning rituals during funerals. The Yonna is a traditional dance used to honor guests.\n\nThe girls are taught a dance that is at the heart of the Majayura, the ritual step of the “young Wayuu virgin.” She must dance in a courtship dance with potential suitors. With her head covered and wearing a cloth shawl and dress, the girl dances forward with small steps and arms outstretched, swooping down like a bird.\n\nShe dances within a circle formed by townspeople, while the male dances backwards before her.\n\nThe Wayuu refer to themselves simply as “Wayuu” and do not recognize the term “indio”, preferring the term “pueblo”.\n\nThey use the terms Kusina or “Indian” to refer to other indigenous ethnic groups while using the term Alijuna (essentially meaning “one who harms”) to refer to outsiders or people of European descent.\n\nIn addition to the organization of the Wayuu within their community, the families of the Wayúu culture are divided into clans. Some of these clans are Aapushana, Epieyu, Ipuana, Jayaliyuu, Sapuana, among others.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Wayuu continue to live off the natural resources provided by their land, however, to generate income, the community sells the fish they hunt and the salt they grow, among other activities.\n\nOne of the main ways of income for the Wayúu society is the sale of artisan fabrics, produced 100% by hand and by women.\n\nWayúu women learn to weave from a very early age, and stand out for their greatest contribution to the family nucleus. Men are also involved in the industry; they make the belts, provide the materials and transport the goods to the centers of the cities.\n\nSome of these crafts are bracelets, hats, chinchorros -which are traditional hammocks that are only produced by this community-, among other creations. However, the craft that most highlights the Wayuu culture is the Wayúu backpack or Wayuu bag.\n\nWayuu Bags\n\nWayuu bags are the maximum expression of the crafts of this tribe since they are widely used by locals and foreigners thanks to their diversity, striking colors and their usefulness.\n\nIt is said that the Wayuu learned to weave thanks to a mythical spider called Wale’kerü. This spider would create magical pieces using thread from its mouth. Wale’kerü is the one who taught all the Wayuu women to crochet.\n\nSome of these crochet items are: hammocks, belts, shoes, bracelets, Wayuu bags, among other creations.\n\nPreviously, the Wayuu used natural materials from their environment to make and dye the threads of their fabrics.\n\nThis ancient transformation has been replaced by industrially processed raw materials, especially fine mercerized cotton yarns, spun yarns, and acrylic fibers in bright colors.\n\nWayúu bags come in different sizes, shapes, and decorations. The most characteristic backpack is Susu whose style matches that of today’s modern and relaxed woman. Susu backpacks also have special designs with vivid colors that make the wearer stand out from the crowd.\n\nIf you want to know more about the types of Wayuu bags.\n\nThe Wayuu indigenous people are a fighting people to keep their culture and customs intact. The Wayuu indigenous people are a fighting people to keep their culture and customs intact. Bearer of great ancestral knowledge and at Mawisa Hndicraft we are proud to make this beautiful tribe known to the whole world.\n\nAnd remember that at MAWISA HANDICRAFT you can find the most beautiful Wayuu bags in the United States."
