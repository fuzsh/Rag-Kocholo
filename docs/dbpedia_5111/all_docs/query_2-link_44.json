        "text": "Wayuu women have always had an important role in their community and have continuously participated in the development of their tribe.\n\nThank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nIn Wayuu culture, women traditionally care for the home and while the man fishes or takes care of the cattle. But apart from the day to day chores, the real beauty the Wayuu indigenous tribe are the women’s handicrafts.\n\nCRAFTS\n\nGeometric figures are part of the Wayuu symbology and a visible characteristic which can be seen in their fabrics and ceramics. The art of wayuu patterns transcends through hammocks, bedspreads, carpets, bags, backpacks and comosora (traditional shoes).\n\nWayuu people don’t leave anything to waste as they recycle fruit shells to make cups, maracas, ladles and spoons typically used in the kitchen.\n\nPASSAGE TO WOMANHOOD\n\nWomen are given great importance within the wayuu indigenous community. When a girl is born, a large feast is held to celebrate her birth in the community. The Wayuu people believe that the birth of a child is a blessing from the gods.\n\nA wuyunquera or doll is the first toy a Wayuu girl receives. These wuyunquera dolls are made of raw clay with the head of a turtle or lizard. This is so, because to give it a human face would be disrespectful towards their elders.\n\nChildhood is short lived as a Wayuu girl’s passage into womanhood begins when she starts her first cycle. from that moment on, she starts her journey to become a woman. Leaving her wuyunquera dolls behind, she is secluded to her room for a period of about a year, where she will start her preparation for marriage.\n\nDuring her year of solitude, no one can visit or see her. The only people she will be able to have contact with are her mother and grandmother, whom will be in charge of feeding, caring and teaching the teenage girl.\n\nAfter having completed her year of seclusion in preparation for marriage, she emerges of her house in a traditional red outfit, symbolizing her entrance to womanhood.\n\nMARRIED LIFE\n\nAfter a year of seclusion, a Wayuu woman is now ready to be wed and suitors will offer dowry to the bride’s parents. This is used to prove that the groom will be able to care for the bride and their family.\n\nWhen the right suitor is found, the bride’s parents will give away their daughter along with goats and cattle for the husband to care for and multiply.\n\nThis entire process serves to strengthen household assets. The dowry paid is used as a backup in case anything should happen and the wedding must be dissipated, or the bride can’t respond for herself her children."
