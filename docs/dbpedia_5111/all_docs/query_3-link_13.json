The Kanaas are created with inspiration from the world around the Wayuu and include objects in their surroundings and daily lives. Here are four Kanaas you'll find in many of the mochilas we offer:\n\n1. ATSANTO'UYAA : Double Elbow\n\n2. JAÑULEKY: Head of a Fly\n\n3. KALEPSÜ: Like the wooden hook used to hang objects in the home.\n\n4. PASATOLO'UYAA: Cow intestines (yes, really!)"
