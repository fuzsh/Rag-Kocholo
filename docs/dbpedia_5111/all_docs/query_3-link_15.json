        "text": "The CBS Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell five Boston-area radio stations to the closely held Entercom for $140 million to satisfy Government requirements related to CBS's purchase of American Radio Systems.\n\nCBS, the largest radio broadcaster in the United States, will also buy two stations in Tampa, Fla., from Entercom for $75 million, expanding its presence in that market. CBS will get WYUU and WLLD, both on the FM dial, from Entercom.\n\nThe sale of the Boston stations satisfies requirements set by the Department of Justice for CBS's $2.6 billion purchase in June of American Radio. The Government cleared that transaction on the condition that CBS sell seven stations in Boston, Baltimore and St. Louis.\n\nCBS is selling WEEI-AM, WRKO-AM, WWTM-AM, WAAF-FM and WEGQ-FM in Boston.\n\nCBS owns stations in 32 markets, including 29 of the nation's top 50 markets. Its stock fell $1.375 a share yesterday, to $28.9375. The station sale was announced after the stock market closed for the day."
