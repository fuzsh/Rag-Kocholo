        "text": "HOA Nightmares: Tampa Area Neighborhoods You May Want To Avoid\n\nIf you are looking at buying a home here in Tampa Bay, the one thing you’ll need to take into consideration is the Home Owner’s Association (HOA). The hidden HOA fees could be a killer when you are trying to figure out how much you can afford to pay for your mortgage every month. Some HOA fees can be over $1000 a month which can really throw your finances out of whack. Now don’t get me wrong, the HOA money goes to improve the grounds in your neighborhood, and access to the community pool, and sometimes it includes basic cable too. Beware, HOAs can be strict and put a lean on your house if you don’t pay them.\n\nThe worst part of the HOA is when you just so happen to live next door to the President of your HOA and they take their job a little too seriously. This is exactly what happened to me!\n\nI was living in a nice community in Lee County, FL and we lived right next door to our HOA President. She ended up being a crazy psycho who broke into our lanai and kidnapped our kitten to bathe him. I know, that sounds crazy and that’s because it was. She was the definition of a “crazy cat lady”. As soon as she got into it with my wife over stealing our cat, she made our lives miserable. We were getting notices for a tree branch hanging 6 inches into the street, mold on the bottom of our mailbox post, our mulch being the wrong color a small oil stain on our driveway…you name it. Since she was making our lives miserable, we had no choice but to move.\n\nSo watch for not only the HOA fees but whether or not you live next to the crazy HOA president. What a deal breaker. Do you have a Tampa HOA horror story? Share it with me on social or you can email me at [email protected].\n\nWe asked our listeners and went to Reddit to see which Tampa areas to avoid with strict HOAs. Here are the top 5 Tampa Bay area neighborhoods to avoid.\n\nHunter’s Green (New Tampa) – We read on Reddit and reviews from Niche.com, and everyone seems to agree that the HOA in this New Tampa neighborhood is way too strict.\n\nWestchase – I’ve heard about some great reasons why Westchase is a good place to live. It’s pretty centrally located and can get to Downtown and other parts of Tampa Bay pretty quickly, they have some delicious restaurants, and overall safe neighborhoods. Westchase was named the best suburb in Florida last year. However, some of our listeners warned us about some strict guidelines set by HOAs in this neighborhood.\n\nCarrollwood – There are lots of neighborhoods in the Carrollwood area, so they might not be all bad. However, some reviews mention strict guidelines or high HOA fees.\n\nEdgewater Place – Listeners tell us that even though most homes in this neighborhood are midsize and just alright, the HOA can be a nightmare. I’ve heard that they will nitpick with you over the smallest things. Some couldn’t take it anymore and moved to a different neighborhood.\n\nClearwater – I’ve been told about numerous neighborhoods in Clearwater. I’d imagine the closer you are to the beach, the stricter the HOA will be.\n\nJen was born and raised in the Tampa Bay area. She’s been with Beasley Media Group since 2022. In her spare time, you can find her at Tampa Bay Lightning games, Tampa Bay breweries, or the beach. Catch up on Jen’s content about the highest-rated restaurants/bars in Tampa, things-to-do around the area, and upcoming concerts.\n\nSign me up for the My Q105 Insider email newsletter!\n\nGet the latest local news, contests, presale information, and so much more from your favorite 80's artists.
