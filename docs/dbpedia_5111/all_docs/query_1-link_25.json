        "text": "Prompted by the addition of shock jock Howard Stern to its morning lineup, WQYK-AM 1010 has dropped its sports talk format in favor of general interest talk shows, axing two local programs, changing its call letters and ending its relationship with ESPN Radio.\n\nGone is the show hosted by former Tampa Bay Buccaneer Scott Brantley and sports talk veteran Ronnie Lane, along with a show hosted by Steve Austin and Mike Pepper, who will work in other capacities for station owner Infinity Broadcasting.\n\nNow known as \"The Buzz\" WBZZ-AM 1010, the station will air Stern from 6 to 11 a.m. starting July 19, with The Sports Chix show moving up to an 11 a.m. start and becoming The Chix _ with less emphasis on sports. Ron Bennington and Fez Whatley, well-known to area listeners as part of the popular Ron and Ron show years ago, return as Ron & Fez, airing repeats from 1 to 3 p.m. and new shows from 7 to 11 p.m.\n\nDon Geronimo and Mike O'Meara's Don & Mike show airs from 3 to 7 p.m. and Los Angeles' raunchy talk host Tom Leykis airs from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. The Chix will be the only locally produced show left at the station.\n\nThe WBZZ changes took effect Wednesday, with Infinity simulcasting the Cowhead and Brent morning show from its WYUU-FM 92.5 station until Stern's scheduled July 19 start.\n\n\"After discussions with ESPN, we both decided to go this way,\" said Charlie Ochs, senior vice president and Tampa Bay market manager for Infinity, noting that ESPN Radio programming likely will head to WLVU-AM 1470. \"We decided to move sooner rather than later.\"\n\nAnalysts said Infinity's move makes sense, given the tough time WQYK-AM had in challenging dominant sports talk station WDAE-AM. The new WBZZ's challenge: getting younger talk fans to find Stern and this new collection of shows on the AM dial.\n\n\"At a time when you have (fired Clear Channel shock jock) Bubba the Love Sponge out of the market, it's probably smart of them to choose a format in an area that's not being exploited by anyone,\" said Perry Michael Smith of the online radio industry magazine AllAccess.com.\n\n\"We sort of saw something coming once the station got Howard Stern,\" said Lane, who has left the station. \"We were not totally surprised. But even when you know, it's a little shock to the system.\"\n\nOchs remained confident the format would find success, despite airing on AM and featuring less local programming.\n\n\"These are solid entertainment shows,\" he said. \"And we're providing Tampa with something they've never had before: Howard Stern.\""
