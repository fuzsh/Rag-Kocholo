        "text": "News and views ...\n\n+ Sports nerds, take shelter. The Babe is going big time in the Big Apple.\n\nThe Fabulous Sports Babe show, starring Tampa Bay area-rooted Nanci Donnellan, moves from ESPN Radio in Bristol, Conn., to New York-based ABC Radio Network Monday, but her show will remain on \"The Team,\" WZTM-AM 820, eventually in an expanded time slot.\n\nExpect fewer visits from ESPN's in-house talent and more from sports and other celebrities perhaps \"just passing through\" the Big Apple. \"Tell me, would you rather hear me talking with Jimmy Leyritz or Billy Crystal?\" the Babe asked rhetorically earlier this week, hinting at a little more glitz and a lot less geek.\n\nBut, overall, she assured her current constituency. \"Nothing's changed; the show is the same show,\" she told the Times. \"We simply thought being in New York City could enhance it a little.\n\nA publicist for the Babe said the switch allows ABC Radio syndicators to market the show more effectively to stations outside the all-sports arena. We're talking personalities here. \"In New York, anything goes, and that's the way I like it,\" Donnellan was quoted in a recent news release.\n\nThe Babe's program may ultimately be trimmed to three hours, in which case the Team would have to make some schedule adjustments to accommodate a 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. span. Babe will make her ABC debut Monday in the usual four-hour format nationwide, but still only 11 a.m.-1 p.m. locally.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that ESPN Radio, which itself is owned by Disney/ABC, would fill the Babe's time slot with competing sports talk programs for other stations. That would be self-defeating. However, plans are being made to expand ESPN's current all-sports service to weeknights. Currently, it produces nighttime sports talk shows on weekends. ABC Radio distributes; ESPN Radio's produces.\n\n+ National Public Radio reporter/host Alex Chadwick will be the guest from 5 to 7 p.m. today at USF's Graphicstudio. The reception will be in honor of WUSF's Producer's Circle, which is a club of $250-and-up supporters of WUSF-FM 89.7 and WUSF-TV Ch. 16. Chadwick is most often heard on NPR's Morning Edition, which airs locally from 6 to 8:30 a.m. on WUSF-FM. At 7:30 this morning Chadwick will speak at a breakfast at the Sheraton Grand Hotel on Westshore Boulevard in Tampa.\n\n+ Overheard on 820 recently: \"We'll keep our ear to the grindstone.\" Ouch! That was The Team's Scot Brantley, whose malaprop-riddled lexicon hints at his eventual succession to comic Norm Crosby.\n\n+ WDAE terms its own all-jock effort a \"work in progress,\" but perhaps a construction zone warning with detour signage would be appropriate during these still-fledgling days. The morning show (nicknamed here Yawn and Yawn for all the energy it exudes) could use a wake-up cup of java. Once the clock sweeps past noon, however, the pace picks up measurably, thanks principally to WFLA-Ch. 8's Chris Thomas (1 to 3 p.m.), whose lucrative TV obligations obviously keep him from filling a prime-time radio slot . . . In case you recognize him from other media, WDAE morning man Brian James' is the distinctive voice that announces promotional spots on WTSP-Ch. 10 and on WFLA-AM 970, where he used to host an afternoon talk show.\n\n+ Might Paxson Broadcasting people be just a little miffed after having purchased the Ron & Ron Show last year, moving the operation to Miami and placing the show on several of its own stations (The Team, locally) only to have what now amounts to the Ron & Gone Show, after Mr. Diaz's prompt exit that coincided with the switch? Is there a warranty on stuff like this? Or is this a caveat emptor case? Just thought I'd ask.\n\n+ IN SHORT: Soft-popper WISP-FM 98.7 continues to await federal approval for a signal upgrade to serve the entire Tampa Bay area. Owner Entercom (oldies WYUU-FM 92.5) remains noncommittal on any plans to change WISP's programing. Principal rival in current format would be WWRM-FM 94.9 . . . . U92 itself has a real treat for potential listeners enclosed in downtown Tampa skyscrapers and unable to pick up the signal at 92.5. The station has placed a small, supplemental transmitter atop the Barnett Bank building; it rebroadcasts U92 on 92.1 FM, U92's old frequency before the switch to higher-powered 92.5 several years ago. The \"sub-station\" can be heard only in the immediate downtown Tampa area . . . . Contemporary jazz WSJT-FM 94.1 plans to name a replacement soon for morning host Mark Krueger, who has left for the Pacific Northwest . . Miami's Paxson-owned WIOD-AM, which used to be simulcast locally on 620-AM, is losing its centerpiece talent, Neil Rogers, to WQAM-AM 560 in Miami, possibly by fall. Internet listeners won't be forsaken, though. WQAM, like WIOD, is on the Audionet Web site, now host to more than 140 stations around the country. Find WQAM's address at www.audionet.com/radio/ and search by location: Miami.\n\nYou can reach Roger Fischer by phone (892-2921), fax (892-2327) or e-mail (fischsptimes.com)"
