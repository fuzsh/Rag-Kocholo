• Beasley Media Group announced 1) a major promotion within the company’s corporate programming ranks and 2) several Southwest Florida signal/format swaps.

Let’s start with the promotion: Nio Fernandez, PD of Beasley Latin Pop WYUU (92.5 Maxima)/Tampa has been named Beasley Media Group Director of Latin Formats. In his newly expanded role, Fernandez (pictured) will oversee all Latino brands for the company while continuing his current PD duties at WYUU. The announcement of Fernandez’s upgrade was made by Beasley Chief Content Officer, Justin Chase, who said, “We are absolutely thrilled to provide a larger voice for the Spanish-speaking community in Southwest Florida and promote Nio to his new role of overseeing Beasley Media Group’s Hispanic programming. We look forward to providing the very best entertainment for the Latin community for many years to come.”

AJ Lurie, VP/Market Manager of the company’s Southwest Florida radio cluster, commented, “Southwest Florida has witnessed and embraced the growth of the Hispanic population in the area. This community deserves more variety, and we’re proud to be a part of the most powerful radio signal super-serving our audience.”

Fernandez remarked, “This move is a testament to Beasley’s commitment and focus on diversity and on the organization’s enthusiasm for the rapidly changing demographics in the United States. I’m honored to be a part of this important initiative.”

• Now, the signal swaps: Beasley’s “Playa” Adult Hispanic format, originally launched in 2016 on WRXK-HD2/Ft. Myers as Playa 98.1, “Salsa Y Mas,” has graduated up to its own 50kw stick at 99.3 WWCN (currently 99.3 ESPN), and is rebranded as The New Playa 99.3, “Los Éxitos de Hoy y Favoritas de Ayer (Today’s Hits and Yesterday’s Favorites).”
