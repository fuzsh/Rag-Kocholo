        "text": "Full details about the previously reported expanded 50th anniversary reissue of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young‘s 1970 debut album, Déjà Vu, have been unveiled.\n\nThe collection will be released on May 14 and can be pre-ordered now. It will be issued as a four-CD/one- vinyl LP set, a deluxe five-LP package and digitally, and will include hours of rare and previously unheard recordings from the sessions that help tell the story of the album’s creation. The five-LP set can be pre-ordered exclusively at CSNY50.com and Rhino.com.\n\nReleased in March 1970, Déjà Vu topped the Billboard 200 that May, and yielded three top-40 singles — “Woodstock,” “Teach Your Children” and “Our House,” which peaked at #11, #16 and #30, respectively.\n\nAlong with the album’s original 10 songs, the reissue features 38 extra tracks, including demos, outtakes and alternate versions.
