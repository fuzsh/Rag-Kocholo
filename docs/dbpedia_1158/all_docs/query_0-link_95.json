        "meta_description": "Writer: Joni Mitchell Producers: Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young Recorded: November 5, 1969 at Wally Heider's Studio C in San Francisco, California Released: March 11, 1970 Players: David Crosby -- vocals, guitar Stephen Stills -- vocals, guitar, organ Graham Nash -- vocals, piano Neil Young -- vocals, guitar Greg Reeves -- bass Dallas Taylor -- drums Album: Deja Vu (Atlantic, 1970) One of rock's first \"supergroups,\"&nbsp;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&nbsp;(CSN) formed in 1968 after&nbsp;Stephen Stills&nbsp;left&nbsp;Buffalo Springfield&nbsp;and&nbsp;David Crosby&nbsp;left the&nbsp;Byrds, while&nbsp;Graham Nash&nbsp;was planning to leave the&nbsp;Hollies. Neil Young, who was in Buffalo Springfield with Stills, joined the group in June 1969 at the suggestion of Atlantic Records chairman&nbsp;Ahmet Ertegun. \"Woodstock\" was written by&nbsp;Joni Mitchell, who was dating Crosby at the time of the original Woodstock, but only experienced the festival via TV news reports because the group left her behind in New York after hearing of the difficult conditions at the concert grounds. Of the song, Mitchell has said, \"The deprivation of being stuck in a New York hotel room and not being able to go provided me with an intense angle on Woodstock. I was one of the fans. I was put in the position of being a kid who couldn't make it. So I was glued to the media... Woodstock, for some reason, impressed me as being a modern miracle, like a modern-day fishes-and-loaves story. For a herd of people that large to cooperate so well, it was pretty remarkable and there was tremendous optimism. So I wrote the song 'Woodstock' out of those feelings.\" Released as a single to precede the quartet's&nbsp;Deja Vu&nbsp;album, \"Woodstock\" peaked at Number 11 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100. Deja Vu, the first full-fledged&nbsp;Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&nbsp;(CSNY) album, hit Number One on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200 and was certified gold after its first week of release. The album has since sold well over seven million copies. After&nbsp;Deja Vu&nbsp;was recorded, sidemen&nbsp;Greg Reeves&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dallas Taylor&nbsp;were replaced by&nbsp;Calvin&nbsp;\"Fuzzy\"&nbsp;Samuels&nbsp;and ex-Turtles/future&nbsp;Jefferson Starship&nbsp;drummer&nbsp;John Barbata.",
