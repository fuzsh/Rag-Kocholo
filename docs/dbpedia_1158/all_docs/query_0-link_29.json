        "text": "One of the most hotly awaited second albums in history — right up there with those by the Beatles and the Band — Déjà Vu lived up to its expectations and rose to number one on the charts.\n\n~Bruce Eder (allmusic.com)\n\nAlmost Cut My Hair – Live Wembley 1974:\n\nWikipedia:\n\nReleased March 11, 1970 Recorded July – December, 1969 at Wally Heider’s Studio C, San Francisco and Wally Heider’s Studio III, Los Angeles Genre Rock, folk rock Length 36:24 Label Atlantic Producer Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nDéjà Vu is the second album by Crosby, Stills & Nash, and their first in the quartet configuration of Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young. It was released in March of 1970 by Atlantic Records, catalogue SD-7200. It topped the pop album chart for one week and generated three Top 40 singles: “Teach Your Children,” “Our House,” and “Woodstock.” In 2003, the album was placed on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nOur House:\n\nDéjà Vu was greatly anticipated after the popularity of the first CSN album and given the addition of Young to the group, who at the time remained largely unknown to the general public. Stills estimates that the album took around 800 hours of studio time to record; this figure may be exaggerated, even though the individual tracks display meticulous attention to detail. The songs, except for “Woodstock”, were recorded as individual sessions by each member, with each contributing whatever was needed that could be agreed upon. Young does not appear on all of the tracks, and drummer Dallas Taylor and bassist Greg Reeves are credited on the cover with their names in slightly smaller typeface. Jerry Garcia plays pedal steel on “Teach Your Children” and John Sebastian plays mouth-harp on the title track.\n\nCarry on – Live(audio) 1974:\n\nIn 2003, the album was placed at number 148 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe same year, the TV network VH1 named Déjà Vu the 61st greatest album of all time.\n\nThe album ranked at #14 for the Top 100 Albums of 1970 and #217 overall by Rate Your Music.\n\nTrack listing:\n\nSide One:\n\n“Carry On” Stephen Stills 4:26\n\n“Teach Your Children” Graham Nash 2:53\n\n“Almost Cut My Hair” David Crosby 4:31\n\n“Helpless” Neil Young 3:33\n\n“Woodstock” Joni Mitchell 3:54\n\nSide two\n\n“Déjà Vu” David Crosby 4:12\n\n“Our House” Graham Nash 2:59\n\n“4 + 20” Stephen Stills 2:04\n\n“Country Girl (Whiskey Boot Hill/Down Down Down/Country Girl I Think You’re Pretty)” Neil Young 5:11\n\n“Everybody I Love You” Stephen Stills, Neil Young 2:21\n\nPersonnel:\n\nDavid Crosby — vocals, rhythm guitar\n\nStephen Stills — vocals, lead guitars, guitars, bass, keyboards\n\nGraham Nash — vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards\n\nNeil Young — vocals, lead and rhythm guitar, keyboards, harmonica\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nDallas Taylor — drums, percussion\n\nGreg Reeves — bass on “Almost Cut My Hair,” “Helpless,” “Woodstock,” “Déjà Vu,” “Country Girl,” and “Everybody I Love You”\n\nJerry Garcia — pedal steel guitar on “Teach Your Children”\n\nJohn Sebastian — harmonica on “Déjà Vu”\n\nProduction personnel\n\nDavid Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Neil Young — producers\n\nBill Halverson — engineer\n\nSpotify:\n\nOther March 11:\n\nBob Dylan plays Palác kultury – Prague, Czech Republic in 1995.
