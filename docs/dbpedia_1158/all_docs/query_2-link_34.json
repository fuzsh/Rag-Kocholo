Nice combo of nostalgic and folksy rock, this might have been my favorite album so far\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nNice and chill album, I get why they were popular. Idk if it's heinous to say it but felt like the Beatles meets Simon and Garfunkel\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nHigh school in the 80's I listen to mostly thrash metal, hard rock and some punk/hardcore with a splattering of some random things like the Cure. I starting hangin out with other kids into different music. One of my first times getting high, my friend puts this album on vinyl, Suite Judy Blue Eyes comes flowing out of the speakers filling my ears and head with those warm sweet harmonies, wow I never heard anything like this. I was hooked, on both the music and the weed. I still love this album and CSN, even though David Crosby is an ass.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nI expected this to be better and score higher, but in reality this album pretty much made me angry. It should be better, it has all the ingredients to be better, yet it is really boring, almost all the songs sound the same, and that same isn't an enjoyable song to begin with. It should probably score 2, but I'm angry at it, so 1 it is.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nCSN's self-titled debut cannot be touched! From Judy Blue Eyes to You Don't Have to Cry to Wooden Ships to Teach Your Children Well (and everything in between), there is no better folk rock record of its time.

This album caught me on a good day and made it even better.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThe debut album from the definitive vocal supergroup of the 60's and 70's. Crosby, Stills & Nash showcase their incredible songwriting and unworldly tight vocal harmonies, pulling flavors from their previous musical forays into a perfect blend of folk, blues, and rock. Obviously, lyrics and voices are front and center on this album, but there's also some subtly awesome instrumentation backing them, including iconic acoustic guitar, mesmerizing organ, and respectable bass and drums. A fantastic breakout album, and a taste of more great music to come. I'm very biased toward this album for personal reasons and familial history. It could have been 40 minutes of screeching brakes and just \"Helplessly Hoping\" at the end, and I still would give it five stars for that track alone. Stand out tracks include \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\", \"Marrakesh Express\", \"Guinnevere\", \"Lady of the Island\", and \"Helplessly Hoping\".\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\ni like the first song a lot. nice sound\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nBy far the best thing about CSNY was Y. Without Y they are a one trick pony; they have the lovely harmonies but not a lot else. In particular, the songs on this LP written by C or N are weak.Some of Stills' songs are good and their harmonies make those songs very good. This is the case with Suite: Judy Blue Eyes. The four songs that follow can't be saved by the harmonies. I kind of like Wooden Ships, probably because it sounds like a Neil Young song, lol. I suppose Stills lays down the lead guitar on that track. We must give credit where it's due. Helplessly Hoping is beautiful and the best song on the LP imo. I just don't think a couple of good songs can get the LP north of 3. PS I do like Teach Your Children but didn't let it influence my rating since it's a bolt on to the 2006 re-release and more appropriately considered a Deja Vu track.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nI thought this album was good, but not great. I believe Young added a certain something to the mix that just made this band pure magic, and for me, that magic is clearly lacking on this album without him. The impact of this album however, is not to be undermined. This debut album popped up in 1969, just in time to inform and be an inspiration for many 70s soft rock, folk rock, and singer-songwriter acts. They naturally had a sound and a style here that many bands would go on to covet and seek. While Crosby, Stills & Nash was not the first supergroup, they're an incredibly significant one. Before them, any group formed of members from other bands was considered a \"supergroup\". But Crosby, Stills & Nash all came from already pretty successful bands and created an even more successful band than any of them came from individually. Crosby, Stills & Nash, along with this album, ultimately set a strong precedent for true supergroups going forward; it's a good introduction to that 70s folk rock sound and a good foundation for things to come with this band.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nI really enjoyed the sound. I would need to listen more for the lyrics when I'm not working sometime. But enjoyable album with a sound I like\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nThis is the first album I listened to and rated as part of this project. I love this style of folk rock music and it provided for a very easy listening experience in which I didn't dislike any song. I felt that it started off a little boring with 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' but I could find that growing on me after a while. I did love 'Guinnevere' and 'Wooden Ships' was probably my favorite track.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nIt’s great if this is what you’re into. It won’t blow away any neutrals though.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nincredible debut; best bits on the Greatest Hits [edit: to explain, this is a 3* because it's so wussy. So much crying everywhere!]\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nWhen the last Boomer on this critics' list rages into that good night, half of the 1,001 will quietly drop off with them, and this will be one of the leavers. But is that fair? This has some great songs (Wooden Ships slides and rocks, You Don’t Have To Cry is a classic of the dead genre of pedagogic goodbyes, Long Time Gone is panther-like yacht rock), a bunch of middling ones, and a creepy one in Guinnevere (I hated it so much on first listen that I tip-toed up to it on subsequent play throughs, worried that it’d bite). More fundamentally, I don’t know what to do with all the harmonies. CSN advance on me like a tripled hippy terminator, earnest and la la la, the threat of a syrupy “milady” keeping me on edge. The harmonies don’t repel me as they once did, but they sound doubled, with a doll-like creepiness - “I’ve heard enough,” my wife declared in the car earlier. And these harmonies are why this band exist. When they turn down the harmonies, let them loosen up, they can be pleasant, extra oomph in the choruses. I wish they’d let them get ragged. I don’t need to hear Marrakech Express again, but it’s cute novelty, albeit one drummed by roots rock’s favourite murderer, Jim Gordon. The opener dares me to hate it, so by the end I’m its pet. I prefer Déjà Vu, and that’s not down to the added Y, fnar fnar.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nHere are some fun facts. In 1982, David Crosby crashed his car into a fence after having a cocaine seizure. Responding police found his coke and a loaded .45. When they asked Crosby why he felt the need to travel with a loaded weapon, he supposedly replied, \"John Lennon.\" At one point, Stephen Stills started to believe he had been on missions with the US Marines in Vietnam and began wearing fatigues on stage during concerts and signing autographs “Stephen Stills, US Marine Corps”. In 2016, Graham Nash, who was in his 70's at the time, divorced his wife of 38 years to marry a 40-year old. His adult children stopped talking to him, which he said was probably for the best. These were three talented individuals and this is a pretty decent album and Deja Vu is even better. It is a shame that after making some pretty decent albums these guys spent the next 50 years ruining their lives and the lives of the people around them. Don't do drugs kids.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nAlthough I love Neil Young, these guys just rub me the wrong way. So without Neil, CSN is a chore. It's just excruciating for me to listen to their hillybilly harmonies and I couldn’t listen to the entire album\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nI'm a big fan of The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel, so you would think this would be up my alley, but this album sounded a bit samey from track to track for my tastes. Apparently there were iconic hits, but none of the tracks really grabbed me. It appears that all of their songs that I enjoy are on other albums in their career, particularly those with Neil Young, which is weird because I typically don't enjoy Neil Young's solo career. Great harmonizing but I found the songs boring pretty quickly. I'd rather just listen to another Simon & Garfunkel album. If I had to a pick a track I might want to listen to again, I guess \"Marrakesh Express\" was okay.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nDenne er god!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGreat band, great album\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nLots of things going on in this music, but enjoyed the tight harmonies and use of rhythm. Casual yet still precise and professional. Enjoyed listening to the lyrics as well - Teach Your Children brings back memories.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThere are several songs on here that by themselves would pull an album score up, but to have them all together is bananas. What a monumental album. Wooden Ships hit me hard when I first heard it back in probably middle school and hasn’t ever lost it. I wonder how I’d feel about this album if I didn’t have nostalgia attached to it. The vocal harmonies are timeless and the guitar is still great. I bet still 4 stars at least, but with nostalgia this is an easy 5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nMuy chulo\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nReally enjoyed it, very laid back music.

Как и все у них\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nYeahhhh now this is some old-timey music that still crushes it. I've had some 60s folk/singer-songwriter albums of late which have been ... eh. For a most-recent example and in a musical vein that is sort of similar: I'm not a fan of Bob Dylan - maybe he could turn a phrase and accurately tap into the young mood of the time but his music just wasn't very good - almost like a quick basic template for him to write poetry over. Dylan's music for me pales to this - CSN's first album is different and you know it right off the bat - this isn't going to be 40 minutes of basic blues-based V-IV-I progressions. What I love most is that although CSN were all singers, and each excellent (those harmonies are worth the admission), these songs are legit and would be good even without the great vocals. Which is everything. Variety! Progressive rock - folk - straight up rock... often with unpredictable progressions and chord voicings (\"Guinevere\" is an example that's hard to categorize - lush and strange harmonies over unresolving guitar melodies) It's admittedly hard for me to be objective to music that I've heard for decades - some of these songs are just all-time world classics. Seems facile to say \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" (I thought it was \"Sweet Judy Blue Eyes until I was a teenager) is one of my favourites since it's so ubiquitous but it really is that great. It's essentially 3 songs in one - it's Yes before Yes were Yes. But better (and coming from a Yes fan, this). There are some points where the album slows up a bit but I think it may add to the album, giving it all an ebb and flow. \"Long Time Gone\" as a near-final track is as hard rock as rock could be in 1969 with soft voices and (mostly) acoustic guitars. Overall this is an indispensable album - a template of the best music of its time and holy hell this is a freaking *debut* album. Top notch. 9/10 5 stars\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nExcellent listen\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nsolid. fun for the whole family\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nIt’s getting to the point- where I’m no fun anymore - I am sorry.

Of course the two opening songs tower over the proceedings. Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Marrakesh Express sound as great as ever.

The variety in tempos and style also add interest for the album.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAnother wonderful opportunity to listen to a classic album for the first time. \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" is a very familiar classic, of course (though I never knew that it was about Judy Collins!). Much of the album has their amazing signature harmonies, but I really enjoyed the different sounds that they brought to their first album. \"Guinevere\" and \"Lady of the Island\" were two new favorites, both apparently taking some inspiration from Joni Mitchell!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nClassic as folk gets.

What a way to debut your music.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nNearly perfect\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI guess I'm pretty neutral in my opinion of this group. I mean I appreciate their great harmonies but can't say I went out and bought any of their albums. This debut has some rock radio heavy hitters in \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\", \"Marrakesh Express\" and \"Wooden Ships.\" It appears they took a democratic approach in the songs switching lead singers after every song. Thinking back and actually forward, their approach probably was very unique for folk with their blend of acoustic and electric guitar songs and their complex harmonies. This is a great sounding and produced album. Outside their hits, I appreciated \"Guinnevere\" - subtle and acoustic love song, \"Lady of the Island\" - another very soft song about Nash's relationship with Joni Mitchell and \"Helplessly Hoping\" - maybe my favorite harmonizing on the album, which surprsingly are led sung by each of the three. Not really any stinkers or fillers here to me. Although you hear enough of this album on the radio, this is definitely an album worth going back to listen to as a whole.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nMuy bueno\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nHad to listen to a different album with most of the same songs.
