        "text": "One of the major musical highlights of 1969—a year that included the Woodstock festival, the Rolling Stones at Altamont, and the Beatles' Abbey Road— was the debut release of the Crosby, Stills and Nash album by the supergroup of David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. Highlighted by the trio's natural chemistry, painstaking production work and vocal harmonies, the album became a huge hit and yielded singles in “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes'' and “Marrakesh Express.” With the subsequent addition of Neil Young, the group further heightened their profile with an iconic appearance at Woodstock and became the spokespersons for the counterculture.\n\nHowever, recording the follow-up Déjà Vu wasn't as seamless compared to the first album, according to Nash today. “When the first CSN record was being made, I was in love,” he says. “I was living with Joni Mitchell. Stephen was in love with Judy Collins, and David was in love with his girlfriend Christine [Hinton]. So that record was sunshine-y, it was up, it was happy, it was slightly acoustic. But within a year, it was very rocky between Joni and I, Stephen and Judy had broken up, and Christine, unfortunately, had been killed in a car crash. When we got to be doing Déjà Vu, emotionally we were completely different people, and I think the record shows it.”\n\nReleased on March 11, 1970, Déjà Vu didn't suffer the dreaded sophomore jinx for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and became their biggest hit record to date—it went to number one and has since sold 7 million copies in the U.S. On the 50th anniversary of that landmark release—which contains such classics as “Carry On,” “Teach Your Children,” “Woodstock,” “Helpless,” “Our House” and “Almost Cut My Here”—Rhino has put out a deluxe 4-CD/1-LP set featuring both the original album and a wealth of mostly previously unreleased demos, outtakes and alternate mixes from those sessions.\n\n“I'm sitting here, I'm a few months from being 80 years old,” Nash says now about the milestone, “and we're number one on the charts. The Déjà Vu record was put together under much chaos and much serenity—four guys with lots of songs, four good musicians, four good singers. It was chaotic, but we made a decent record.”\n\nDéjà Vu was the first album to feature Young collaborating with Crosby, Stills and Nash, and accompanied by drummer Dallas Taylor and bassist Greg Reeves. Prior to Young's crucial arrival, musicians such as John Sebastian, Steve Winwood and Paul Butterfield Blues Band keyboardist Mark Naftalin were being considered for the fourth spot in the band.\n\nNash says: “On the first Crosby, Stills and Nash album, Stephen Stills played most of the instruments, of David and I played rhythm guitar on our stuff: “Guinnevere,” “Long Time Gone” and “Marrakesh Express,” et cetera. We realized that we would probably have to go on the road. And we realized that one of the members played most of the instruments. So what do you do? We knew we had to get somebody.\n\n“David and Stephen were having dinner with [Atlantic Records head] Ahmet Ertegun in Manhattan. And during the dinner, Ahmet looked at Stephen and said, I know who you should get, man. And Steven looked at him and he said, ‘Who?’ And Ahmet said, ‘You gotta get Neil back.’ Steven said, ‘Are you kidding? I just did two years of craziness with this guy [in Buffalo Springfield]. He's in the band, he's out of the band, we're doing The Ed Sullivan Show, we're not doing The Ed Sullivan Show. This is crazy. Are you sure?’ He said, ‘Yeah, you gotta get Neil.’”\n\nStills at least had a history with Young, but not Nash, and thus he was initially concerned about having Young in the group.\n\n“I knew he was a great writer,” Nash later recalls of Young at first. “I knew he was a great singer. I had never met him. I got to meet this guy. I had breakfast on Bleecker Street [in New York City] with Neil Young. He was funny. He was self-deprecating. He was mysterious. He was dark. At the end of that breakfast, I asked him: ‘Neil, why should we invite you into this band?’ He said: ‘You heard me and Steven play guitar together?’ And I said, ‘Yes, I have.’ And he said, ‘That's one of the reasons why you want me.’ And he was very self-confident. He knew what he wanted, he wanted to be in the band.”\n\nThe first track unveiled prior the anniversary set's release is an early version of “Birds,” featuring him and Nash, which later ended up on Young's 1970 solo album After the Gold Rush. “As a songwriter, when you get a song in one take, that's perfect,” Nash says. “Even though it may be slightly imperfect, emotionally it was perfect. When Neil started to play “Birds,” and he asked me to sing it with him, I was right there, of course. I think his guitar was slightly out of tune, and so I stopped the process and I say, ‘Neil, are you sure you're completely in tune?’ He tunes up perfectly and starts the song, and we got it in one take.”\n\nNash's two compositions for the album, “Teach Your Children” and “Our House,” have become indelible in their own right. The demo version of “Teach Your Children” on the anniversary reissue, featuring just Nash and Crosby, sounds stripped down and yet more expressive and soulful compared to the final version that ended up on Déjà Vu. “I remember specifically I played “Teach Your Children'' for Stephen,” says Nash, “and he said, ‘You know, that's a really decent song. Don't ever play it like that again.’ And I said, ‘What?’ ‘Well, you know, you sound like Henry VIII. Come on, this is how this song should be.’ And he put that beautiful Stephen Stills right-hand picking pattern to it.”\n\nThe version of “Teach Your Children” that eventually appeared on Déjà Vu also benefited from the guest appearance by the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia, who played pedal steel guitar on it. At the time, CSNY, the Dead and Jefferson Airplane were recording in different rooms inside Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco. “When we got to the solo, Stephen said, ‘Me and Neil had been playing all over this. I'm tired of playing lead guitar. What else can we do?’ David overheard that conversation, and said, ‘Hey, I hear Jerry's been playing pedal steel for a couple of months. Why don't we ask him?’ We made a track of “Teach Your Children,” very simple. I said, ‘Play it to Jerry. If he likes the song and wants to play on it, I'm all for it.’\n\n“It just so happened that Jerry had his pedal steel in the other studio, and he brought it into ours, and he played “Teach Your Children” while I recorded. He got to the end of his first take. I said, ‘That's just f***ing fantastic. You just turned it into a big hit record.’ Jerry said, ‘Yeah, but I kind of screwed up in a couple of places. Do you mind if I do another track?’ Now what musician with a brain in his head would refuse Jerry Garcia to open up another track so he could record, right? So Jerry did a second. I said, ‘Yeah, you absolutely can do another take. But I must tell you, I'm in love with the first take and I probably won't use the second track.’ And that's how Jerry Garcia turned “Teach Your Children” into a big hit.”\n\nOne of the other highlights of the set is a previously unreleased take of “Our House,” which is a duet between Nash and his then-romantic partner Joni Mitchell, who wrote the classic “Woodstock” that is on Déjà Vu. Unlike the other bonus tracks, this recording of “Our House” sounds rough but still has its charms—especially when Mitchell is heard laughing towards the end of the performance.\n\n“Under normal circumstances, you would never hear anything about that personal,” Nash recalls. “You would never hear it because it's imperfect. We don't even finish the song, we're singing it in the wrong key. But it was such a beautiful moment that I thought that people would really enjoy at least listening to it. This Déjà Vu re-release is something very close to our hearts. What would you pay to hear Joni Mitchell laughing uproariously? That's one of the reasons that I put it on there, because it was a beautiful moment.\n\nIf “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” is the show-stopping opening track on Crosby Stills and Nash that drew people into the record, then Déjà Vu's equivalent is the mesmerizing “Carry On,” which was put together as the recording sessions drew to an end. “I said to Stephen one day, ‘You know, we don't have “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.”’ He goes, ‘Yeah, I know. We did it on the first record.’ I said, ‘No, no, no. We don't have the song that guarantees that people won't get up and take the needle off the record. And when you hear “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,” and we come to the end of it, I defy you to get up and turn the record off. You wouldn't do that. We need that kind of song.’ The next day, he comes to me and he goes, ‘What do you think about this Willy?’ (sings opening notes to “Carry On”) and he played me “Carry On.” It shows you the genius of Stephen Stills.”"
