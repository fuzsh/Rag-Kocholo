With appropriate information still unavailable for a full report, the vinyl LP edition is now on a calendar. I’m sure that a CD set will be following soon enough.\n\nOn May 14, the LP edition will be made available to fans of the title. In short order, I fully expect the other editions to emerge.\n\nMore to come."
