        "text": "To: rust@rustlist.org\n\nSubject: Albums in order: 4 Way Street\n\nYes, I know this is way out of order. The last album I covered, Greendale, came out in 2003. 4 Way Street was released in 1971. I changed the scope of this series after I passed up the 4WS timeframe (I had initially intended to only do the albums of all-new material.) But in a way, it kind of brings the albums-in-order series full circle. 4WS was not the first Neil album I bought, but I did get to hear it before I went out and got ATGR and 4WS was one of the reasons.\n\nI had heard the song Only Love Can Break Your Heart on the radio around 1970 and thought the singing was, well, too high. Sounded like a female. This is the first time though that I remember hearing the name Neil Young. Then I started figuring out this guy had been around a few years and had made some other music. Eventually, sometime in 1971, I went to a friend's house and heard 4 Way Street. Neil's songs and even his high-pitched voice now, intrigued me. I liked the others' songs, but Neil's were much more communicative to me. And significantly, I learned that he played lead guitar on some of the exciting electric tracks, that's he's the one who wrote Ohio, and that he had a sense of humor.\n\nSome of the between-song banter is some of my favorite parts of this album. \"We'd like to introduce our friend, Neil Young.\" \"Here's a new song guaranteed to bring you right down. It's called Don't Let It Bring You Down. Sort of starts out real slow and fizzles out altogether.\" About Southern Man: \"This is usually a really long song, folks, but tonight we're going to play it slow to make it longer.\"\n\nNeil's songs are all excellent on this live album. Lovely version of On The Way Home. Of course, when I first heard this album, I had no idea that this was a Buffalo Springfield song that had been sung on the last BS album by Richie Furay. I heard the solo acoustic Cowgirl here before I heard the electric version from EKTIN. It's beautiful.\n\nThe electric stuff, especially Neil's, is absolutely killer on this record. The Young/Stills guitar trade-off on Southern Man is a highlight. Hearing these songs at my friends house back in '71 did a few things for me. It helped bring together the things about Neil I didn't know, like he was the songwriter for Ohio and that he was an excellent guitar player. I also learned that his voice had some kind of effect on me, it communicated to me. Another way to say this is that my natural \"Neil gene\" was activated. Hearing this album, I *had* to go out and buy his latest album which happened to be After The Gold Rush. And then I listened to it and loved it and got all the rest of the albums that had Neil Young songs on them and bought the albums throughout his career as they came out and joined the Rust list and started a series called Albums in order of which this is the last entry.\n\nIt's been a great run. Thank you all for indulging me. Listening to all the albums again has been a wonderful experience for me, it felt good to get connected with the music that I love so much again; some of those albums I had not listened to for a long, long time. I've taken great pleasure in reading all your comments and opinions about about the albums.\n\nI very much enjoyed listening to 4 Way Street today.\n\nMike - Expecting To Fly"
