        "text": "Singer/songwriter and folk rock pioneer David Crosby was not only aÂ successful solo artist, but a founding member of the famed folk groups the Byrds; Crosby, StillsÂ & Nash (CSN); and Crosby, Still, Nash & Young.Â\n\nAs a result of his music with the former two musical groups, heâs been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.Â\n\nCrosby released four albums with the Byrds, beginning with the classic Mr. Tambourine Man in 1965, before he stepped away from the bandÂ in 1967.Â\n\nA chance meeting withÂ songwriter Stephen Stills in 1968 led to the formation of a new project. When Graham Nash joined them, they began performing asÂ folk supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash.Â TheyÂ released their self-titled debut album in 1969,Â and were named Best New Artist at the 12thÂ Annual Grammys.\n\nCanadian rocker Neil Young later joined CSN and they released DÃ©jÃ Vu in 1969. But tensions in the band ran high and eventuallyÂ the four began performing as separate duos, Crosby & Nash and Stills & Young in the mid-1970s. Crosby & Nash released four studioÂ albums together.\n\nCSN reunited as a trioÂ for their second studio album, CSN, in 1977. Their third album Daylight Again followed in 1982.\n\nIn between his group projects, CrosbyÂ released his debut solo album, If Only I Could Remember My Name, in 1971. It would take another 18 years before he released his second studio album Oh Yes I Can in 1989.Â\n\nIn recent years, heâs had a steady output of original solo music, including 2014âs Croz, 2016âs Lighthouse, 2017âs Skytrails and 2018âs Here If You Listen. In 2021, Crosby released his eighth studio album For Free.\n\nCrosbyÂ was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009."
