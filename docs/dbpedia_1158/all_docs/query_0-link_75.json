        "text": "4WS: Déjà Vu was a completely different project. You said in an interview that it started to go badly when Neil came into the band. What happened?\n\nDT: Ego!!!!!!!!!!!!! And Drugs!!!!!!! Fighting over who’s songs were going to make it on the album, and just petty baloney stuff.\n\n4WS: Most of the songs were individual efforts (except for “Woodstock”, “Almost Cut My Hair” and “Helpless” ). Is this correct?\n\nDT: Mostly, it was Neil that would take his stuff home after we laid down the basic tracks. Then he brought them back for CSN vocals. Very weird and childish… Almost like “I’m taking my marbles and going home”.\n\n4WS: First it was Stills who was sitting behind the soundboard, but later it was Bill Halverson who got involved. What was the reason?\n\nDT: Bill was always involved. It was his genius that knew when to push the record button when we were playing. A lot of the time, we didn’t even know he had recorded something. Also he was a genius at editing. Perfect cuts every time. Some of those songs are combinations of several different takes. You could never tell.\n\n4WS: You once said that Déjà Vu would not have been the same without you on it. As you now of course expect me to ask, what was your (creative) contribution?\n\nDT: The “feel”, the drum parts, the incredible groove that Stephen and I had together. Listen to the drums, and you tell me…..\n\n4WS: I will surely tell you later on, but first another Stephen. Stephen Barncard (CSN’s engineer) was not credited on the cover of Déjà Vu. What was his role?\n\nDT: Bill Halverson was the engineer at the Record Plant sessions. Bill Halverson was a brilliant engineer. He made the acoustic guitar sound right in your face, and my drums sounded live. But it was his editing ability that really set him apart. He could take clips from three or four different takes and make it sound like one take. Everything was starting to fall apart during Déjà Vu and it was Bill Halverson that got us through the record. I don’t know who Stephen Barncard was, unless he engineered Neil’s stuff out side the main sessions. That’s some new information to me.\n\n4WS: Speaking of the cover: on Déjà Vu you were not pasted in, but (next to CSNY and Greg Reeves) photographed by Tom Gundelfinger (now called Tom O’Neal). The atmosphere represented the Civil War era and Gundelfinger took the pictures with an antique camera from the 19th century. What do you remember of that session?\n\nDT: The cover was Stephen’s idea. He was a big Civil War buff. The camera belonged to Graham Nash. He collected antique cameras. The photo was taken at David Crosby’s house north of Sausalito California. The dog wandered into the picture accidentally and we kept the shot. We still don’t know where the dog came from, or who he or she belonged to. Stephen called it “Fred”.\n\n4WS: “Carry On” has an interesting groove and rhythm. It starts after almost a minute with the hi-hat, then some percussion (that persists throughout the song). Did you (as the artwork tells us) or Stills do the percussion and what about the arrangements in general?\n\nDT: The song was decidedly pieced together from two different songs. Stephen played the congas over the recorded track. I remember recording the second half of the song. My brand new Porsche had been stolen from San Francisco Airport and I was really pissed. I think it shows in the track.\n\n4WS: A question about the beat: what kind of time signature is it?\n\nDT: It’s all in 4/4 time. The first part is a shuffle, and the second part is straight ahead rock and roll 4/4.\n\nIn the liner notes of their 1991 boxed set, drummer Dallas Taylor said: \"The song was written in the middle of the Deja Vu sessions, when Nash told Stephen they still didn't have an opener for the album. It was something of a message to the group, since it had become a real struggle to keep the band together at that point. Stephen combined two unfinished songs and stuck them onto a jam we'd had out in the studio a few nights before, me on drums and Stephen on a Hammond B-3 organ. As the track begins I'm playing bass drums and high hat, and Graham is playing congas. Then we go into a 6/8 groove, which is rather obscure - Stephen loved to change gears that way. The sessions would go on all night, sometimes 3 or 4 days non-stop. The thing I loved about the studio was you could never tell if it was day or night, and we hid all the clocks so no one knew what time it was.\"\n\nThe wall that Elliot Roberts erected around the sessions for Déjà Vu at Wally Heider’s only made the competitiveness between the four men the more claustrophobic.”\n\nCore member from the first album, drummer Dallas Taylor, appeared happy with Stills’ all-nighters. “Whatever he’d decide to do, I’d be there,” recalls Taylor in the CSN notes, “The sessions would go on all night, sometimes three or four days non-stop… we hid all the clocks so no one knew what time it was.” One of LA’s first heroin users, Taylor was by that time mainlining in the studio. He was also resentful of newcomer Young, whose contract was better than his despite the drummer’s core-member status. This resulted in attempts to sabotage Young on stage by changing time signatures and would prompt Shakey to give him the boot before they returned to the studio to record Ohio.”\n\nInterviewer- Dallas Tayor did some amazing drumming on Our House. Did you have the drum arrangement worked out, either on the demo or in your head?\n\n\"I very rarely tell musicians what to play. My father taught me something at a very young age: 'Don't buy a dog and bark yourself.' Let people do what they do. Our House started on the piano, but I played it in such a way that you could overdub the drums to it. Dallas Taylor was a good drummer. He didn't make it as far as Neil was concerned, but who does?\" - Nash\n\nIf Dallas Taylor had never met and become friendly with John Sebastian, very few people might ever have heard of him. But because Sebastian (recruiting Taylor to play with him upon the breakup of the Lovin' Spoonful) introduced the 20-year-old Texas native to Stephen Stills, Taylor became very famous within a couple of years as the drummer for Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\nThat circumstance proved to be, in the long run, as much a curse as it was a blessing, because 10 years later Taylor (who had played in an obscure band called Clear Light prior to CSN) no longer had any music career at all. His career and his life were derailed by a drug habit that obliterated every cent he ever made as a musician. And because of the success of CSN (and then CSNY), Taylor had made a whole lot of money. All gone.\n\nTaylor (Texas-born and bred), got married as a teenager but headed out to California to pursue the dream of big-time music stardom. He found it at a young age by becoming CSN's drummer, playing on the trio's legendary debut album in 1969, and then appearing with them at Woodstock. When Neil Young officially joined the group, Taylor also played on CSNY's Deja Vu album the next year. But, in many ways, that's as good as it ever got for Dallas Taylor.\n\nHe detailed all the many ups and downs in his very worthwhile and impressive (though, in parts, hard-to-take) autobiography, Prisoner Of Woodstock. His book may very well be his finest accomplishment, even considering all the great recordings he played on, because Prisoner Of Woodstock is all Dallas Taylor. He wrote the entire book himself, and it's pretty darn well-written. And Taylor knew that he had a story that was worth telling, that could benefit others.\n\nIf not for Stills, Taylor may not have made it very far in the national music scene, but sometimes even Stills (whom Taylor regarded as a brother) couldn't help him. Stills included him in the CSN project over the objections of David Geffen, who helped get the group signed to Atlantic Records. (Stills had already recorded for the company, on the ATCO label, as a member of Buffalo Springfield.) Geffen didn't want Taylor to be a part of it, telling Stills that he and Crosby and Nash could do just as well using all studio musicians to help record the album.\n\nBut Taylor thought there was another reason why Geffen didn't like him, which was that Taylor had been Laura Nyro's boyfriend for a period of time (probably around 1967-68), a relationship that ended rather badly. Geffen was Nyro's mentor and manager. Taylor even thought that the young Geffen (who published Nyro's many classic pop songs, which included \"Wedding Bell Blues,\" \"And When I Die\" and \"Stoned Soul Picnic\") might have been in love with Nyro himself, and was simply jealous of Taylor's relationship with her.\n\nNyro had apparently been very taken with Taylor, and had even written a song about him, which Taylor mentions in the book as something he thought of as \"kind of an honor.\" (The song, which Taylor does not name, might have been \"Timer,\" which she recorded early in '68.) But it was Nyro who abruptly broke things off with Taylor, after he casually admitted to her his enthusiastic use of cocaine.\n\nTaylor was allowed to stay with the group anyway, but only long enough for Young to make his life difficult a little ways down the road. In a dispute with Stills that sparked after the Deja Vu album was released, Young insisted (the way Taylor tells it) that the only way to settle matters was to fire Taylor from the band. Taylor may have possibly left something out in the telling, but it seemed like a pretty nasty solution to Young's problem, because: a) Taylor was in the band first, b) Young had had nothing to do with getting him the job, and c) Taylor doesn't bring up anything negative that had gone on between him and Young.\n\nThe same unpredictability that, in a short time, made Dallas Taylor a rich and famous rock musician also (and just as quickly) turned him into a permanent ex-member of one of the world's biggest bands. And in his book, Taylor ruminates on why the group wasn't called Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young & Taylor”"
