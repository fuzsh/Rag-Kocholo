        "text": "RHINO will reissue Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young‘s 1970 Déjà Vu album to celebrate its 50th anniversary last year. Originally released in March 1970, Déjà Vu was the first album featuring the trio’s then-newly expanded lineup of David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young.\n\nDue out on May 14th, the expanded reissue will include the album’s original recordings plus 38 bonus tracks of unreleased demos, outtakes, and alternate takes spread out over four CDs and one LP (or a deluxe version on five LPs). The reissue will also come with a hardcover book featuring rare photos of the famous folk-rock band with liner notes written by Rolling Stone writer and director Cameron Crowe. Crowe notably produced the 2019 documentary David Crosby: Remember My Name.\n\nThe Déjà Vu reissue was produced by photographer/archivist Joel Bernstein alongside RHINO’s Patrick Milligan, while each member of the band also voted on the tracks to be included.\n\nRHINO shared the demo recording of Neil Young and Graham Nash’s duet performance on “Birds” to go with the announcement.\n\n“I know it’s just me and Neil doing it with his acoustic guitar, but that’s a beautiful piece of music,” Nash said about the demo. “It’s me trying to be the best harmony singer I can be with somebody of the stature of Neil Young. I don’t want to stick out singing extra words that he’s not singing. I have to be on my game. And ‘Birds’ is a perfect example of that.”\n\nRelated: David Crosby Answers Questions On Love, Marriage, “The Talk”, More For ‘Ask Croz’\n\nListen to the previously-unreleased demo recording below.\n\nNeil Young & Graham Nash – “Birds” (Acoustic Demo)\n\n[Video: RHINO]\n\n“Eh, I’m happy about it, but I don’t have a dog in that fight, really. I sold my piece,” David Crosby also told Rolling Stone in regard to the fact that he recently sold his ownership of his catalog rights. “I am very proud of the record, [but] this is like a repackaging. It’s probably a good thing, but it’s not that big a deal to me. The guy who looks backwards and does this kind of stuff is Nash. He always has been. I don’t really give much of a shit about that.”\n\nClick here to pre-order the 50th-anniversary deluxe reissue. Scroll down to see the full tracklist on the forthcoming reissue."
