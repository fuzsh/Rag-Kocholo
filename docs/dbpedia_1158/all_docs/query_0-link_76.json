        "text": "Earlier this week, I ripped an old favorite from the vinyl. “Deja Vu,” by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. (Atlantic Records SD-7200, released in 1970)\n\nIt had been a very long time since I had listened to this album all the way through. The number of great songs on this album is staggering. Many of them got quite a bit of radio play, and I wouldn’t hesitate to opine that it may be the most successful album of most of their careers. The trademark harmonies of David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young are full and rich, and each one gets a fair share of the lead singing. The track list is as follows:\n\nSide One\n\n1. Carry On\n\n2. Teach Your Children\n\n3. Almost Cut My Hair\n\n4. Helpless\n\n5. Woodstock\n\nSide Two\n\n1. Deja Vu\n\n2. Our House\n\n3. 4 + 20\n\n4. Country Girl\n\n5. Everybody I Love You\n\nLike I said, I have heard most of these on the radio in the decades since this album was released. Do I have a favorite song on the album? As a matter of fact, I do, and it happens to be one that I can’t remember ever hearing on the radio. Track 4 on side two, “Country Girl.” Here’s the song on You Tube.\n\nHere’s “Woodstock,” which was written by Joni Mitchell.\n\nAnd here’s a clip of the title song, “Deja Vu.”\n\n“Deja Vu” is a brilliant album by a group of great musicians. It is well worth listening to.\n\nTTFN, y’all!"
