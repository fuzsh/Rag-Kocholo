Good times.\n\nJohn Wilde… Thanks for all the wonderful memories boys. Damn we’re old..\n\nDavid Miller… Love this album – one of the first i ever bought….big influence.\n\nPatrick Lewis… And also 4 Way Street is amazing – great live album of CSNY.\n\nAlan Esdaile… Love Almost Cut My Hair.\n\nJohn Wilde… Mine too. “Feel like letting my freak flag fly”.\n\nAlan Esdaile… It increases my paranoia, like looking at my mirror and seeing a police car.\n\nJim Breeds… Yep. Nice gatesleeve affair. Hoping that Graham Nash does the couple of his tracks from this at the DLWP in July\n\nDennis Torrance… I have some great tracks our house and carry on. The first track I heard was carry on just so good first time I heard it . Last night on sky arts was yes rick wakeman and the concert o2 by led zep . I still love the rock music but like everything now film music as well but not a rap fan\n\nJo Avery… Yep, classic album!\n\nAndy Qunta…\n\nSteve Reents… I had the cassette.\n\nPatrick Lewis… Yes have this one plus the first one C,S and N and 4 Way Street, probably, one of the best live albums ever.\n\nPete Prescott… Me !\n\nColin Fox… Yes, any self respecting musician should have it, also the previous album. We used to do Helpless Hoping in the early 1970s.\n\nJennie Tocock… Me too!\n\nTony Davis… Yes I’ve got it. Great album\n\nPaul Morfey… We have all been here before, still got my original album, I brought in the 70ts\n\nJan Warren… Yep, still got the original album!\n\nChris Meachen… Somebody stole my vinyl copy years ago, but I’ve since replaced it on cd…. Favourite track for me is 4&20…\n\nPaul Richardson….Sure have Alan, still a favourite. And I agree Patrick Lewis, 4 Way Street remains my favourite live album.\n\nAmanda Brooks… Almost Cut My Hair. It happened just the other day .."
