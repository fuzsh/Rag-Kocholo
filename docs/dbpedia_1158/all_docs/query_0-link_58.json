        "text": "Syd Barrett - The Madcap Laughs: release date 2nd January 1970\n\nThe former Pink Floyd frontman had been ousted from the group after his unreliability had become too much of a problem and he only finished two full solo albums before he effectively retired. The sole single to be taken from the album was the quirky Octopus.\n\nThe Doors - Morrison Hotel: release date 9th February 1970\n\nThe fifth album from the LA psychedelic rockers included the singles You Make Me Real and Roadhouse Blues plus the funky Peace Frog.\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young - Déjà Vu: release date 11th March 1970\n\nThe folk rock supergroup expanded their line-up with the addition of Neil Young and and this second outing included the hippy hit Woodstock, plus Teach Your Children, Our House and Carry On.\n\nJimi Hendrix – Band Of Gypsys: release date 25th March 1970\n\nThe guitar legend's final full-length album before his untimely death in September 1970 was a live show recorded at the Fillmore East in New York and included Machine Gun, Who Knows and Changes.\n\nPaul McCartney - McCartney: release date 17th April 1970\n\nMacca's first solo album was overshadowed somewhat by the accompanying press release which effectively ended The Beatles.

The single made No 4 in the UK charts, while the parent album made the top spot. Also included were the tracks War Pigs, Iron Man and the chilled-out Planet Caravan.\n\nSantana – Abraxas: release date 23rd September 1970\n\nThe second album by Carlos Santana and co included the hit Black Magic Woman and Oye Cómo Va.\n\nPink Floyd - Atom Heart Mother: release date 2nd October 1970\n\nThe prog band's fifth album included an ambitious orchestral piece as the title track plus the songs Summer '68, Fat Old Sun and the wacky sound collage Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast.\n\nLed Zeppelin - III: release date 5th October 1970\n\nZeppelin's third self-titled album came complete with a rotating card wheel attached to the cover for some visual fun, plus the classic tracks Immigrant Song, Celebration Day and Since I've Been Loving You.\n\nDavid Bowie - The Man Who Sold The World: release date 4th November 1970\n\nBowie made the transformation from acoustic hippy to would-be rock god with this progressive album that paved the way for Ziggy Stardust.

The band issued one more album, 1973's Squeeze, which didn't feature any of the original members.\n\nGeorge Harrison - All Things Must Pass: release date 27th November 1970\n\nThe \"Quiet One\" amazed the world with his first solo effort, which was a triple album that featured a lot of songs that had been rejected by The Beatles. Tracks included the Bob Dylan co-written I'd Have You Anytime, the hit My Sweet Lord and the epic Isn't It A Pity.\n\nJohn Lennon - John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band: release date 11th December 1970\n\nLennon's first real solo album after a series of experimental releases with wife and collaborator Yoko Ono was best known as the \"primal scream\" LP after the controversial therapy the couple had undergone earlier in the year. A pioneering example of confessional songwriting, Lennon confronted his childhood trauma head on with songs like Mother, the Beatles break-up on God and society in general on Working Class Hero."
