        "text": "Crosby, Stills & Nash & Young's Deja Vu Reissued as Part of the Atlantic Records 75th Anniversary Series on Hybrid Stereo SACD. Mastered Directly to DSD From the Original Master Tape by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering.\n\n\"Déjà Vu\" is the title track to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's first album as a quartet. With Neil Young now in the mix, the album reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 after its release in March 1970. The album remains a high point for the supergroup, having sold more than 7 million copies. Also on the record are hit singles \"Teach Your Children,\" \"Our House,\" and a cover of Joni Mitchell's \"Woodstock.\"\n\nThe late David Crosby penned \"Déjà Vu\" for the group. Though it wasn't released as a single, it gave that iconic album its name and has subsequently received its fair share of love from CSNY fans.\n\n\"I'm one of those people who thinks we go round again,\" said Crosby back in 2008. \"The Buddhists have got it right. It's a wheel and we get on and get off. I think life energy gets recycled. That's why I wrote ‘Déjà Vu.'\"\n\nCSNY took a while to craft the album-which is largely considered their magnum opus. \"Getting that second album out of us was like pulling teeth, there was song after song that didn't make it,\" Stephen Stills once said. \"The track ‘Déjà Vu' must have meant 100 takes in the studio. But ‘Carry On' happened in a grand total of eight hours from conception to finished master. So you never know.\""
