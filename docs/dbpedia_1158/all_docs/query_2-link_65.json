        "text": "Crosby, Stills, Nash and/or Young has been an on-and-off concern since its inception in 1968. Now it’s off again — and perhaps forever.\n\nNeil Young had already stepped out of the equation last year after David Crosby made disparaging remarks about his relationship with actress Darryl Hannah, for which Crosby subsequently apologized. Now, however, fans have been surprised by Graham Nash‘s just-published comments in the Dutch magazine Lust for Life that CSN is no more, due to the deteriorating of his own blood-brother relationship with Crosby.\n\nGraham Nash Remembers Fallen Icons David Bowie & Glenn Frey\n\nNash — who releases This Path Tonight, his first new studio album in 14 years, on April 15 — tells Billboard that, “Right now, I don’t want anything to do with Crosby at all. It’s just that simple. In my world there will never, ever be a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young record and there will never be another Crosby, Stills & Nash record or show.” He declined to say specifically what Crosby had done, simply saying that, “I was letting Crosby be who he is. I let people play their hand in front of me, and I let him do it and then I make a decision.”\n\nNash did tell Lust for Life this: “I don’t like David Crosby right now. He’s been awful for me the last two years, just f—ing awful. I’ve been there and saved his f—ing ass for 45 years, and he treated me like shit. You can’t do that to me. You can do it for a day or so, until I think you’re going to come around. When it goes on longer, and I keep getting nasty emails from him, I’m done. F— you. David has ripped the heart out of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.”\n\nGraham Nash Says His New Rock Hall of Fame Exhibit ‘Looks F—ing Spectacular’\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nIt’s not a decision he’s taking great joy in, however. “How can I not be sad?” Nash says. “Look at the music we probably lost. How can I not be sad about that?” Nash, in partnership with Joel Bernstein, has taken the lead in mining the group’s archives for releases, including 2014’s lavish CSNY 1974 live set, and he was hoping he, Crosby and Stephen Stills would return to work on a covers album they had started with producer Rick Rubin. For now, however, he plans to focus on This Path Tonight and his solo touring, while Crosby and Young are touring on their own and Stills is gearing up for the May 6 release of Pierced Arrow, the second album by The Rides, his band with Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Barry Goldberg.\n\n“The truth is, after being totally immersed in me and David and Stephen and Neil’s music, I’m done,” Nash says. “I’ve had 10 years of it. Leave me the f— alone. I need to concentrate on me now.”"
