        "text": "CSNY/Deja Vu (2008)\n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nDocumentary covering Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's 2006 \"Freedom of Speech\" tour, which had them going back out with a purpose. According to what we're told here, Young got the idea to protest the war in Iraq so they headed off on tour to see how many people they could reach. This documentary has reporter Mike Cerre going with the band from one city to the next where they face many die-hard fans willing to put up with the protest but at some concerts, such as the Atlanta one, they come under fire with boos and walk outs. I got my first taste of the legends at the 9/2 concert in Noblesville, Indiana and I still remember how strange a show it was. At times people were up cheering, dancing and having a good time but the next song people would be cussing, fighting and throwing things. I personally felt that the concert had many great touches but at times it was just too political for its own good. I'm not one against protest songs seeing as how my favorite artist is Bob Dylan but one needs the songs to be good in order for them to work. It's funny but this documentary covers the Atlanta reaction to \"Impeach the President\", which was full of cussing, threats and walks out and this is probably the reaction the song had at a lot of places. You either cheered or left. For me, the song was just so silly and badly written that I felt it was a disgrace to great songs like \"Ohio\". The documentary is certainly one-sided in its politics but I think fans and non-fans can have a good time with it because it's simply fun. If you're a fan of the classic songs then they're here to be heard and the guys sound great. The music is top-notch, even on the weaker, new songs and Young was just mind blowing in his playing. He was amazing to see live that night and many memories came back to me while watching this documentary. I thought the film was at its best when we see the guys before the show and tour when they were nervous about how the reaction would be. Seeing them after the show was great as well. Even if one doesn't buy into their politics and even if one has no politics, this documentary is worth seeing just for the classic music and of course as a backstage pass to what was going on behind the scenes."
