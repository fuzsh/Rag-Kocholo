        "text": "British-born science fiction author Arthur C Clarke has died in hospital in Sri Lanka at the age of 90.\n\nClarke had been in and out of hospital since his 90th birthday in December and had breathing difficulties, his aide Rohan de Silva said.\n\n\"Sir Arthur passed away a short while ago at the Apollo Hospital,\" Mr de Silva said.\n\nDuring a career that spanned some seven decades, Clarke wrote more than 80 books and hundreds of short stories and articles.\n\nBut he is perhaps best-known as the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, which director Stanley Kubrick made into a film in 1968.\n\nClarke was also Sri Lanka's best-known resident guest and has a scientific academy named after him.\n\nHis valet, WKM Dharmawardena, said funeral arrangements would be finalised after his family returned to Sri Lanka from Australia.\n\nMr Dharmawardena said Clarke's condition began to deteriorate in recent weeks and he had been in hospital for the past four days.\n\nPrayer for peace\n\nClarke marked his birthday on December 16 wishing for peace in his adopted home of Sri Lanka, where he has lived for the past five decades. He ran a diving school there that was affected by the December 2004 tsunami.\n\nThe author said he had sadly watched - for close to half his lifetime - a bitter ethnic conflict tearing up Sri Lanka.\n\n\"I dearly wish to see lasting peace established in Sri Lanka as soon as possible,\" he said, referring to Asia's longest-running war in which the Tamil Tigers' campaign for an independent homeland has left tens of thousands dead.\n\nAlthough the conflict started in 1972, fighting has been escalating since late 2005, when a Nordic-brokered truce unravelled.\n\n\"But I'm aware that peace cannot just be wished - it requires a great deal of hard work, courage and persistence,\" he said in the taped message.\n\nPredictions\n\nClarke also wished for evidence of extra-terrestrial life and for the world to adopt cleaner fuels on his 90th birthday.\n\nIn the 1940s he predicted that man would reach the moon by the year 2000 - an idea that experts dismissed as nonsense. When Neil Armstrong landed in 1969, the United States said Clarke \"provided the essential intellectual drive that led us to the moon.\"\n\nClarke was born in Britain on December 16, 1917. He served as a radar specialist in the Royal Air Force during World War II.\n\nHe became involved in the British Interplanetary Society after the war, where he proposed an idea for geostationary satellites as telecommunications relays.\n\n\"I have no regrets and no more personal ambitions,\" Clarke said on his most recent birthday. The author had been confined for the past three decades to a wheelchair because of the effects of childhood polio.\n\nAt the time of his death, Clarke was working on the idea of a \"space elevator\".\n\n\"The golden age of space is only just beginning,\" he said.\n\n\"Over the next 50 years, thousands of people will travel to Earth orbit and then to the Moon and beyond. Space travel and space tourism will one day become almost as commonplace as flying to exotic destinations on our own planet.\"\n\nHe was also working on another novel, The Last Theorem.\n\n\"The Last Theorem has taken a lot longer than I expected. That could well be my last novel, but then I've said that before,\" Clarke said last year."
