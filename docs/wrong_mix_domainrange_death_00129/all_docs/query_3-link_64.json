The author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, reportedly died in Sri Lanka, where he had been living for over 50 years.\n\nIf ever there was a need for a good biography, it is about Clarke. Revered as both a futurist and science fiction writer, he is also credited with proposing geostationary communications satellites. The breadth of his work and mysterious private life would make for an intriguing story.\n\nHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s Computers\n\nA defective CrowdStrike update sent computers around the globe into a reboot death spiral, taking down air travel, hospitals, banks, and more with it. Here’s how that’s possible.\n\nDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage Scams\n\nSwindlers are spinning up bogus websites in an attempt to dupe people with “CrowdStrike support” scams following the security firm's catastrophic software update.\n\nHackers Claim to Have Leaked 1.1 TB of Disney Slack Messages\n\nA hacker group called “NullBulge” says it stole more than a terabyte of Disney’s internal Slack messages and files from nearly 10,000 channels in an apparent protest over AI-generated art.\n\nThe Feds Say These Are the Russian Hackers Who Attacked US Water Utilities\n\nPlus: The FBI unlocks the Trump shooter’s phone, a security researcher gets legal threats for exposing hackable traffic lights, and more.\n\nAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone Records\n\nA security researcher who assisted with the deal says he believes the only copy of the complete dataset of call and text records of “nearly all” AT&T customers has been wiped—but some risks may remain."
