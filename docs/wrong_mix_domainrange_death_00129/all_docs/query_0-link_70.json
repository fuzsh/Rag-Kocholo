CURTIS DIES SUDDENLY THIS AFTERNOON - Former Decatur Athletic Director Dies Of Stroke\n\nHerbert L. Curtis, 46, athletic director and head basketball coach at the Decatur public high school from 1926 until 1935, died suddenly at 1:15 o'clock this afternoon at the Wells county hospital in Bluffton. Herb, as he was familiarly known to school officials, students and fans during his long stay in this city, suffered a paralytic stroke while at the Liberty Center high school, west of Bluffton, and was taken immediately to the hospital, where he died shortly after being admitted. He had been employed by the Crowell Publishing Co., for the last several months and he was at this work when stricken today. His cousin, Ernest Curtis, former principal and coach at Monmouth high school, is now principal and coach at Liberty Center. Curtis, during his many years as a basketball mentor, was recognized as one of the ablest teachers of fundamentals, and his teams were highly regarded throughout this section of the state for their skill in ball handling, footwork and general basketball keenness. He came to Decatur in the fall of 1926, after a highly successful record at Monrovia, where he coached such stars as Branch McCraken, later an All-American at Indiana university, now head basketball coach at the state institution; and Blanchard Horton, former Decatur football coach. Curtis resigned his position in this city during the summer of 1935 to accept the post as principal of Southport high school, a large consolidated school near Indianapolis. He remained at Southport for four years. He was employed by the state of Indiana for a time as head of the Indiana institutional division, resigning to accept the position with the publishing company. He was a member of Adams post 43, American Legion, while a resident of this city. During his years as mentor, Curtis' Yellow Jackets won three undisputed championships of the Northeastern Indiana high school conference, and also annexed several sectional titles, despite being force to compete in the Fort Wayne sectional some of those years. He is survived by the widow, Hazel, who also taught in the Decatur schools, two brothers, Glenn Curtis, basketball coach at Terre Haute Teachers college, and Hugh Curtis, of Monrovia.

Policeman Is Killed At Angola In First Leap He Tries.\n\nHis first try at parachute jumping proved fatal to George B. Farrell, 26, 1512, Taylor Street, at 10 a.m. today at the Angola Airport. One of a class of five Fort Wayne men who had gone to the airport to practice parachute leaps, Mr. Farrell was the first pupil to go aloft. He went up in a plane piloted by Russell Waters, of Tri-Lake and this city, after receiving preliminary instruction from Ford Hurni, an instructor. At 2,200 feet, well above the limit for such jumping set by the Civil Aeronautics Authority, Mr. Farrell jumped from the plane. Watchers saw his body streak earthward. The parachute failed to open until less than 100 feet from the ground, too late to save the jumper. Hurni said Farrell had apparently failed to pull the ripcord until too late, since the 'chute had functioned perfectly, except for the fact that it had not been opened soon enough. Mr. Farrell's body was badly crushed by the impact with the ground. He was killed instantly. An investigation has been started by Dr. E.P. Eberhart, Steuben County coroner. The body was taken to the Klink Funeral Home in Angola, but was to be removed to D. O. McComb & Sons' Funeral Home in this city later today. Mr. Farrell, accompanied by Virgil Schultz, Bill Kiester, Harry Karr and Walter Metz, had motored to the Angola Airport to practice jumping. Until a month ago, Mr. Farrell had been an industrial guard and a member of the General Electric company police. He had been transferred to the heat treatment department in the same plant. Mr. Farrell was a member of the Fort Wayne Gospel Temple. He is survived by the widow, Mrs. Wilma Farrell and two children, Janet and Byron.
