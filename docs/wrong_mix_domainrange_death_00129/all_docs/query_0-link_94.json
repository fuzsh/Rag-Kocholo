        "text": "1. Building a Family Tree from Online Sources\n\n2. By 1860, one fourth of mostly urban English children age 5 and under had died. Education Act of 1870 said all children between ages 5 and 10 should be educated. In 1880 schooling became compulsory. By 1891 schooling was free. Not until 1902 was there a system of public secondary education.\n\n3.  One consequence of so many children not surviving to age five is that they might not show up on the censuses because they were born and died between censuses. One way to look into this is to consider that in most families, children were born about every two years. If there is a gap of more than three years, consider looking for a child who was born but died during that period of time.\n\n4. William Sinclair Gelling Family Group Sheet This is all the information Sister S started with. She was also interested where the name “Sinclair” came from, since it is not a common name on the Isle of Mann.\n\n5. Here Are The Three Families We Will Follow: Jane QUINE and Thomas CRETNEY, Rebecca GARRETT and William Sinclair GELLING, and their children, Hannah GELLING and Robert CRETNEY\n\n6. Thomas Cretney Marriage Record to Jane Quine Bride's marital status: not stated. Bride's father: not stated. (MS09754/3/1)\n\n7. Thomas Cretney and Jane Quine Family Group Sheet Notice the six year gap between John and William. You would expect more children to have been born in this time period. Sister S later learned that both John and Robert emigrated to the United States. Robert and his wife, Hannah, lived and worked on John’s farm. William married and stayed on the Isle of Mann. His son, Thomas Arthur, discussed later, also emigrated to the US.\n\n8. Thomas Cretney Family Tree taken from Ancestry.com Other children and their birth information are included, but not documented\n\n9. John Cretney (son of Thomas and Jane, b. 1836) and his family in the 1870 US Census John said he was born in “England” rather than “Isle of Mann” a common practice.\n\n10. Thomas Arthur Cretney (son of James and Rebecca, born 1881) Passport Application-Front. While he is not a direct ancestor of Sister S, he was famous, and his life is well documented, including information that does relate to Sister S’s direct line family.\n\n11. Thomas A Cretney Passport Application- Back Side, which includes a detailed physical description.\n\n15. Robert Cretney Family-1900 Census. Hannah says that she has born 5 children (Jennie, James, Effie, Ernest and Gladys) and all 5 are living, but the gaps in the ages doesn’t support it. Since Hannah was born too soon for compulsory education, she could probably neither read nor write. She is also an immigrant and may not have understood the question or how to answer it.\n\n16. Robert Cretney Family on the 1880Census Tracking the Robert Cretney and Hannah/Annie family back from 1900, the 1880 census shows five children, the youngest is an unnamed two month old baby, all of whom have whooping cough. Comparing the children to those listed on the 1900 census (Jennie b 1875, James b 1784, Effie b 1886, Ernest b 1891 and Gladys b 1898) Thomas and William aren’t listed. Are they married or dead? Rebecca J is likely Jennie, and Edith and the unnamed infant are missing in 1900, likely deceased.\n\n17. Robert Cretney Naturalization Card. At that time, a man’s wife and children were automatically naturalized when he was.\n\n18. Robert Cretney in the 1895 Wisconsin State Census It is hard to see in this picture, but Robert Cretney is listed as having 5 males and 4 females in his family, 7 born in the United States, and 2 born outside the US (he and his wife). If you remove him and his wife from the numbers, that leaves 4 males and 3 females, and we know that the unnamed baby did not survive.\n\n19. This obituary confirms the information previously gathered.\n\n20. This page contains the obituary of a Lorraine M (Morgan) Cretney married to a Robert G Cretney, the son of the previous Robert Cretney. More research is needed to show a connection.\n\n21. Madison, Wisconsin, p. 26 This Gladys Lynch is Gladys Cretney, daughter of Robert and Hannah. The obituary mentions eight brothers and sisters, apparently not counting the infant who died. Perhaps Gladys did not know about the baby girl if the family did not talk about her.\n\n22. (Ernest) The SSDI gives the exact birth and death dates of Robert (Ernest) Cretney.\n\n23. This is a comparison screen of Sister S’s RootsMagic family data and the same William Sinclair Gelling family on FamilySearch. While there are possible new family members, they need to be researched, documented and verified before she adds them to her tree.\n\n24. William Sinclair Gelling & Family on FamilySearch.org\n\n25. This match on MyHeritage shows the maiden name of James Henry’s spouse, Amelia. Sister S wanted to go to the Isle of Mann iMuseum site to verify the information.\n\n26. In comparing Effie Catherine Gelling to possible Family Search matches, one record showed a spouse, and another showed her parents, both of which need further research.\n\n27. Edith Margaret (daughter of William and Rebeccah) was not found on the Isle of ManGelling n. Sister S surmised she may have gone to the mainland. On Free BMD, she found a Edith getting married in Jun 1896. Based on what she knows about the Isle of Mann naming patterns, she is guessing that she married William Clucas Kennaugh. When she searched Ancestry.com, she found a Wm C married to an Edith on the 1900 census.\n\n28. William Clucas and Edith Kennaugh family on the 1911 Census Line 7 shows a visitor, John Gelling b ~1853, who is single. This is Edith’s brother , John, who never married.\n\n29. Effie Catherine Gelling, daughter of William Sinclair Cretney, married Arthur Bintley in 1896. the following page is from Ancestry.com and has a picture as well as birth and death dates.\n\n31. Hannah Cretney (widow of Robert) as Widow-1905 Wisconsin Census\n\n32. Excerpt from Book about the Cretney’s Home Area One exciting thing about this excerpt is that where there is information about one family member, there is likely to be information about others, especially since the phrase “youngest daughter” is used. Likely more information about the parents and siblings will be included.\n\n33. This Isle of Mann record shows the baptismal record of a William Sinclair Gelling whose parents both have the surname of Gelling, which is unusual. Access to the imuseum is usually by subscription but if you have an Ancestry.com account, you can access it through their website."
