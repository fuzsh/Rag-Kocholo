        "text": "Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE (December 16, 1917 – March 19, 2008) was a British science fiction author, inventor, and futurist. Clarke was knighted in 1998. He emigrated to Sri Lanka in 1956 largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving, and lived there until his death.\n\nClarke corresponded with C. S. Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s and they once met in an Oxford pub, The Eastgate, to discuss science fiction and space travel. Clarke, after Lewis's death, voiced great praise for him, saying the Ransom Trilogy was one of the few works of science fiction that could be considered literature.\n\nIn the early 1970s Clarke signed a three-book publishing deal, a record for a science-fiction writer at the time. The first of the three was Rendezvous with Rama in 1973, which won him all the main genre awards and has spawned sequels that, along with the Odyssey Series, formed the backbone of his later career. Clarke's work is marked by an optimistic view of science empowering mankind's exploration of the Solar System. Clarke's images of the future often feature a Utopian setting with highly developed technology, ecology, and society, based on the author's ideals.\n\nNovels[]\n\nPrelude to Space (1951)\n\nThe Sands of Mars (1951)\n\nIslands in the Sky (1952)\n\nAgainst the Fall of Night (1948, 1953) original version of The City and the Stars\n\nChildhood's End (1953)\n\nEarthlight (1955)\n\nThe City and the Stars (1956)\n\nThe Deep Range (1957)\n\nA Fall of Moondust (1961)\n\nDolphin Island (1963)\n\nGlide Path (1963)\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nRendezvous with Rama (1972)\n\nA Meeting with Medusa (1972)\n\nImperial Earth (1975)\n\nThe Fountains of Paradise (1979)\n\n2010: Odyssey Two (1982)\n\nThe Songs of Distant Earth (1986)\n\n2061: Odyssey Three (1988)\n\nCradle (1988) (with Gentry Lee)\n\nRama II (1989) (with Gentry Lee)\n\nBeyond the Fall of Night (1990) (with Gregory Benford)\n\nThe Ghost from the Grand Banks (1990)\n\nThe Garden of Rama (1991) (with Gentry Lee)\n\nRama Revealed (1993) (with Gentry Lee)\n\nThe Hammer of God (1993)\n\nRichter 10 (1996) (with Mike McQuay)\n\n3001: The Final Odyssey (1997)\n\nThe Trigger (1999) (with Michael P.
