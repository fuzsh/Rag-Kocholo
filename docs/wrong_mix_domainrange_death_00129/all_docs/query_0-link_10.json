While the amount of available information varies, most transcripts will include the following:\n\nFirst name(s)\n\nLast name\n\nBirth date\n\nBaptism date\n\nPlace\n\nFatherâs first name(s)\n\nMotherâs first name(s)\n\nCounty\n\nImages of the register will often provide additional information, such as\n\nResidence\n\nProfession\n\nBy whom the ceremony was performed\n\nRemarks\n\nBefore 1841, Canterbury was the only archdeaconry in the diocese of Canterbury. From 1841 until 2011, the diocese of Canterbury was divided into two archdeaconries: Canterbury in the east and Maidstone in the west. In 2011, the Archdeaconry of Ashford was created and the archdeaconry boundaries redrawn.\n\nThe records include all parishes that are within the Archdeaconry of Canterbury and agreed to online publication. There are four parishes that withheld consent for publishing images of their records. As such, where provided, you will only be able to search transcripts of their records: Cheriton St Martin, Harbledown St Michael, Ramsgate St Luke, and Shepherdswell (also known as Sibertswold) St Andrew. Original records for each of these four parishes can be consulted on microfilm at Canterbury Cathedral Archives.\n\nThree ancient Thanet parishes can be found within these records: St John in Thanet, St Lawrence in Thanet, and St Peter in Thanet (rather than under the names Margate, Ramsgate, and Broadstairs respectively).\n\nIncluded in these records are also the baptism registers at the Buckland (Dover) Workhouse between 1855 and 1912. These may be beneficial if your ancestors were from anywhere within the extensive catchment area of Dover Union: the parishes of Alkham, Buckland, Capel le Ferne, Charlton by Dover, Coldred, Denton, Dover, Guston, Hougham, East Langdon, Lydden, Oxney in Dover, Poulton, Ringwould, River, St Margaret at Cliffe, Shepherdswell (Sibertswold), Temple Ewell, Westcliffe, West Langdon, Whitfield, and Wootton.\n\nFor data protection and personal privacy, there is a 100-year cut-off for publishing baptism records.\n\nThese records constitute a valuable resource for researching ancestry in Kent and have been provided in association with Canterbury Cathedral Archives.\n\n.\n\nKent, Canterbury Archdeaconry Burials Transcription, Burial of Beal Jones Mowll.

Birth and Baptism dates and middle name found in IGI.\n\nE Mails dated 18th and 19th September from Sara-Lou Morley to Coll Macdonald\n\nI think I may have an update to what might have happened to Richard Winder Mowle (b. 1839, Dover) who seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth after the 1851 census ...\n\nToday I found that the National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1861-1941 has the following entry in 1905:\n\nMowle\n\n, Richard Winder of Dover died on or since 7 September 1864 at _______________ Administration London 11 February to Elizabeth Reynolds Adcock (wife of William John Adcock) Effects Â£104 4s 3d.\n\nI imagined this meant that Richard was last seen alive 7 September 1864 ... given the sea-faring nature of the Mowles, a suspected death at sea, perhaps?\n\nOn Googling \"Mowle, Richard W\" I came across a webpage that lead me to wonder if he involved himself in the American Civil War ... Records held in the Missouri State Archives show that a Richard W Mowle enlisted in St. Louis, Missouri, on 18 Mar 1865 and served as a Private on the Union side with the Missouri Volunteers (14th Regiment Cavalry Volunteers, G Company). He died 08 Sep 1865 of Consumption and was buried 09 Sep at Fort Riley, KS (Kansas?).\n\nI may be putting two and two together and making 5, but the fact that it appears Richard's family last heard of him in Sep 1864 (when he emigrated / went out to fight?) and didn't know his whereabouts when he died, certainly does point to a possible link.\n\nThere are also similar National Probate Calendar entries for Richard's brother William Hudson and father Reynolds Mowle - both relating to 1905 Administration to Elizabeth Reynolds Adcock (who was William and Richard's sister and Reynolds' daughter) .\n\nThe National Archive website lists the following record of lists of documents held by the East Kent Archives Centre (Deposited by Messrs. Knocker, Elwin and Lambert, solicitors of Castle Street, Dover, April 1961):\n\nMOWLE, Richard Winder, of Dover EK/U844/T362/3 1905 Contents: A\n\nHope this is of interest!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nSarah-Lou Morley (descendant of Reynolds Warwick Mowle, Richard Winder Mowle's brother)\n\nPS ... on Ancestry's U.S., Union Soldiers Compiled Service Records, 1861-1865, Richard W Mowle is listed as having a birthdate of abt. 1839, was 26 and had an enlistment date of 1865 with the \"Fourteenth Cavalry, Me-R\". This now seems almost conclusive proof, so I've added all the info to my tree.\n\nParish Register of Marriages: entry for Reynolds Mowle & Susanne Bailey nee Warwick, St Mary The Virgin.\n\nVarious emails from Anne White (anne.white1420@bigpond.com) to Coll Macdonald received in and after May 2008.
