        "text": "Mr Clarke, most famous for writing 2001: A Space Odyssey, died in hospital at 1.30am after suffering from breathing problems, one of his aides said this evening.\n\nThe author of more than 100 books, Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE was a renowned British science fiction author, inventor, and futurist.\n\nThe sci-fi guru shared an Oscar nomination with Stanley Kubrick at the Academy Awards of 1968 for their work on the film version of 2001.\n\nIn 1985 Mr Clarke published a sequel - 2010: Odyssey Two - and worked with Peter Hyams on the movie version.\n\nHe gained a new audience in the 1980s through his television programmes Arthur C Clarke's Mysterious World and Arthur C Clarke's World of Strange Powers.\n\nThe writer had battled debilitating post-polio syndrome since the 1960s. He moved to Sri Lanka in 1956, lured by his interest in marine diving.\n\nMr Clarke was credited with the concept of communications satellites in 1945, decades before they became a reality.\n\nHe was the last surviving member of the \"Big Three\" of science fiction, which also included Robert A Heinlein and Isaac Asimov."
