A privately held family photo shows his birth date tattooed to his left arm.\n\nThis birthdate has been confirmed by his death certificate, which says that he was born at New York and says that he died 15 August 1961 at Lakewood, a suburb of Denver, Colorado. One may also see these birth and death dates on a photograph of his gravestone at Find A Grave.\n\nThe informant on the death certificate was Albert's wife, Mildred Belle Shaw. They were married 13 September 1926 at Lockport. Niagara County, New York, and had two sons: David, born in 1928, and Robert, born in 1931.\n\nAccording to the Shernick family legend, as told by Albert's older sister Ida (Shernick) Altsitzer, Albert was the youngest son of Harry Chernikov and Bluma (Savransky) Chernikov. Ida, a resident of New York City, told this story to Mildred Shernick during her summer holiday visits to Denver in the 1940s and 1950s. Mildred dutifully recorded everything Ida said in handwritten notes.\n\nIda repeated this family history when Albert's son, David, interviewed her at Miami Beach in December 1955. The typed transcript is attached here in the images section, and it names Albert's siblings as Ida, Mark. Jacob, David, Lucille and Bertha Chernikov.\n\nThey are allegedly shown in the 1903 Shernick family group photo, attached.\n\nThe problem with this family legend is that much of it is false. It's a fairytale. When checked against marriage certificates, death certificates and immigration records, Ida's claims don't add up. The corresponding records cannot be found, they do not match, or they appear to be deliberately falsified.\n\nThe problem with the family photograph is that the people in the photo do not match the names in the family legend. Careful matching with other photographs suggests:\n\n1. The gentleman standing in the back row, on the far left, called \"Jacob Shernick\" by Albert, may in fact be Duke Peter of Oldenburg -- he is certainly wearing the uniform of an unterofficer in a rifle brigade of the Tsar's Life Guard. Duke Peter was the first cousin of the three counts and three countesses von Zarnekau.\n\n2. The dark-haired gentleman standing next to him, second from left, called \"David\" Shernick, has not been identified.\n\n3. The tallest gentleman standing, third from the left, called \"Mark,\" appears to match photos of Peter Petrovich Durnovo, who was also a member of the Tsar's Life Guard and the Tsar's secret service -- the Okhrana.\n\n4. The young lady standing, fourth from the left and third from the right, called \"Lucille Schernick,\" came to New York and was later called Lucille Rogers (a stage name) which she claimed was the name of a doctor she met and married while serving as a Red Cross nurse in World War I. Lucille became a well-known singer in Vaudeville and played small roles in several Hollywood movies of the 1950s and 1960s. No record of her marriage has been found. Her death certificate indicates she was born in Tennessee. No record of her birth in Tennessee has been found.\n\n5. The woman seated next to Lucille, second from the right, called Ida Shernick, came to America, lived for many years at Trenton, New Jersey, and married to Harry Altsitzer. After her first husband's death, she married secondly to Louis Gluck, and passed away in 1957 near Miami Beach, Florida. When compared to old photographs of the counts and countessas von Zarnekau, she bears a striking resemblance to Countess Ekaterina von Zarnekau.\n\n6. The young girl on the far right, called \"Bertha Shernick,\" age about 7 in 1903 (born about 1896), supposedly became a doctor and died of influenza during the flu pandemic of 1919-1922. In fact there is a record of one Bertha Shaernick who died at New Haven, Connecticut on 23 November 1921. But there is also a newspaper record for one Bertha Shernick who was not a doctor and did not die of the flu: Born 1901, she married to a gentleman named Isidore Gurtovnick and died at New York in November 1994.\n\n7. The old and bearded man seated at the center of the photo, called \"Harry Chernick,\" has not been satisfactorily identified. He allegedly died 1905 or 1906 in Ukraine -- the same year that Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg, the father of the counts and countesses von Zarnekau, died at Nice, France.\n\n8. The older matron seated next to the old man at the center of the photo, called \"Bluma,\" definitely came to New York in 1914 aboard the S.S. Czar, and she died at 433 Central Park West in December 1936. Her death certificate gives her maiden name as Bluma Safronsky. Yet her photo appears to match old photos of Agrippina Djaparidze, the first Countess von Zarnekau.\n\n9. The little boy in a sailor suit, called Albert Shernick, standing next to Bluma, has not been satisfactorily identified. No birth records have been found. He appears to have entered the United States on 29 July 1914 under a false or stolen identity, that of Aaron Cherniack, the son of Gedalia Cherniack.\n\nWhen Aaron Harry Cherniak filed for citizenship in 1934, he gave as his birthdate the very same day that Albert calls his birthday: May 20, 1899. Aaron Chernjack entered the United States 23 December 1913 on board the very same steamship that Albert took to the United States seven months later: The S.S. Czar. They left from the same port: Libau, Latvia.\n\nOne may speculate that Albert's passport was stolen from Aaron, or a copy of Aaron's slightly altered passport was supplied to Albert by the Okhrana. Or one may speculate that Albert was the twin brother of Aaron, following exactly the same route, with the same father. Or one may speculate that Aaron went all the way back to Ukraine in the spring of 1914 and returned with Bluma Schernick in July of 1914, using a slightly altered passport.\n\nRather than spin conspiracy theories, the assumption has been made here that they were twin brothers, with the same parents. But as Albert's son, Robert, is fond of saying: Albert never, ever mentioned having a twin brother named Aaron, and nowhere in Ida's telling of the family legend does she mention a brother named Aaron. Neither does one find them side-by-side on any U.S. census record.\n\nAaron Cherniak filed for U.S. citizenship. Albert Shernick did not. Aaron Cherniack appears with his family on the U.S. census for 1920. Albert Shernick does not.\n\nWhen we find Bluma and Ida on the 1925 New York state census, living in the Bronx, they have a gentleman boarding with them who gives his name as Arthur Freedman, 34. The problem with Arthur Freedman is that Arthur Freedman is dead. He may be found in a graveyard at Buffalo, New York, and he was not living in 1925.\n\nAlbert dissapears for five years and first reappears on the official record when he marries Mildred Shaw at Lockport, New York, in 1926, and on his application for a marriage license he gives the name of his mother as Bluma Davis. The maiden name given by Bluma Chernick on her December 1936 death certificate is Bluma Safronski.\n\nClearly, there is some serious misrepresentation going on. Neither Albert nor Ida can be fully trusted to tell the truth.\n\nFor what it is worth, however, here is the official legend surrounding the birth and life of Albert Shernick. His family tree, based on the family tree of Aaron Cherniak (who may be a twin brother or may be a cousin) is a work in progress.\n\nHow to read the tea leaves is a very good question indeed.\n\nThe Official Family History\n\nAlbert Harry Shernick, age 15, arrived at Ellis Island, New York, on 29 July 1914 aboard the S.S. Czar under the name Avram Itzke Czernichow. He was accompanied by Bluma Czernichow, and the ship's passenger list indicates that their destination was an address on State Street in Trenton New Jersey, a small apartment above a jewelry shop run by Bluma's daughter, Ida Shernick Altsitzer.\n\nThe passenger list for the Czar indicates that their point of origin was Alexandrovsk, Dnieperpetrovsk, Ukraine, a city now called Zaporizhzhye. They had travelled more than a thousand miles by train to reach Libau, Latvia, a port city on the Baltic Sea, boarded a Russian Amerika Line steamship, and travelled another 4,116 miles to cross the Atlantic ocean.\n\nYet Albert maintained for the rest of his life that he was born 20 May 1899 in New York City. Despite a complete lack of documentation, that was his story and he stuck to it.\n\nHaving arrived safely at Ellis Island, Albert and Bluma joined Ida (Shernick) Altsitzer's family in Trenton, New Jersey. Ida's husband, Harry Altsitzer, had died only a few month's earlier, in December of 1913. The unofficial cause given for Harry's death was cyanide poisoning. According to the family legend told by Ida to her sister-in-law, Mildred, Harry was trying to avoid the draft by smelling cyanide salts, with the intention of giving himself a weak heart.\n\nThe problem with this story: There was no Russian draft in December 1913. The first World War did not get under way until July, 1914. Another inconsistency in the legend told by Ida to Mildred: Ida said that Albert arrived on Christmas Eve. It was not Albert Shernick but Aaron Cherniak who arrived on Christmas Eve. Albert and Bluma arrived in July, 1914.\n\nWhy is the name Aaron left out of this story? Because if Aaron Harry Cherniack and Albert Harry Shernick are one in the same person, there's a little problem called bigamy: Aaron Cherniak married a nice Jewish girl named Esther Rittoff in December 1923, and they had their first child, Theodore, only a month before Albert married to Mildred Shaw in 1926.\n\nThis would explain why Ida failed to mention Aaron to Mildred: \"Albert\" may have been kicking her shins under the table and staring at Ida pretty hard.\n\nSo Ida told an awkward and heavily edited version of Albert's arrival in the United States in 1914.\n\nBy July, Ida was trying to settle Harry Altsitzer's estate and raise her three children alone. The arrival of her mother and young Albert was reportedly a welcome addition. The front page of the local newspaper tells a less happy story: A preacher's wife, the owner of the jewelry shop building, was suing Ida for refusing to vacate. The agreement to vacate was made by Harry before he died, and now that he was dead Ida denied that they had any legal obligation to leave the premises of the shop on State street.\n\nPutting their story on the front page must have won the widow some local sympathy: She got to stay.\n\nAl Shernick lived in the New York and New Jersey area between July 1914 and 1925, keeping his head low because he himself did not want to be drafted into the Russian army. He helped Ida pay for rent and groceries by working at odd jobs.\n\nOne of the best records of people named Czernichow living in the Mogilev region during this period is the long list of draft dodgers kept by the Russian government. More than a dozen men named Czernichow from the city of Mogilev went missing. \"Albert Shernick\" was right to keep his head down and change the spelling of his name: The Russian government was very actively seeking the location and whereabouts of all Russian males over the age of 16 who might be hiding out in the United States. They were constantly bugging the United States department of state about it: They wanted their male citizens back.\n\nBut the U.S. was officially \"neutral\" during this period. It had a policy of locking both Russians and Germans into place. Thousands of German sailors stranded on the docks of New York -- men who wanted to fight -- were refused permission to go home.\n\nThis made for some very awkward relations between the United States, Germany and Russia.\n\nThe 1915 state census for New Jersey shows Albert \"Shernick\" working as a clerk behind the counter of a local candy store. After school he helped Ida with cleaning chores in her jewelry shop. She trained him to run the cash register and to repair watches.\n\nWhen America actively entered the war in 1917, Ida closed her shop and the entire family moved from Trenton to Yonkers. They set up house right next door to her relatives, the Altsitzer family, on Nepperhan Avenue.\n\nIn early 1917, when revolution broke out in Russia, it soon became clear to Albert and Bluma that they would never be able to go back home again. Since they had entered the United States under false or altered identity papers, Albert and Bluma were genuinely stuck between a rock and a hard place when it came to filing for citizenship.\n\nThey never filed, and remained unregistered aliens. On the 1930 U.S. Census, Bluma is still listed as an alien.\n\nAl certainly filled out a World War I draft form, as required by law, and on that form he clearly indicates he was born in Russia. Because he was afraid of being deported and drafted into the Russian army, he decided to make himself useful. He did \"war work\" from 1915 to 1917.\n\nREMINGTON ARMS\n\nTo avoid the Russian draft, Al found work as a machinist at the Remington Arms munitions factory in Hoboken, N.J. This dangerous work producing rifles, mortar shells and bullets that were sent to the Russian front qualified the factory workers at Remington for an exemption from service in the Russian armed forces.\n\nA Prudential Life Insurance policy made out to the name Abraham Shernick indicates Al was still using the name Abraham or Abram in 1917.\n\nMunitions work had an added benefit: It kept the American Bureau of Investigations (a pre-cursor of the FBI) off his back. During the Red Scares of 1917 - 1919 they sifted records very carefully for illegals from Russia who might be dodging the Russian draft or engaging in sabotage.\n\nAl somehow survived with all his fingers in tact. But he told his sons that he had a steel plate in the back of his head -- the result of an accident at the plant. Whether that \"accident\" was the infamous Black Tom explosion of 30 July 1916 is unclear. What is clear: Al was lucky to survive. The explosion killed four people, destroyed $20 million in equipment and military material, and was \"one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions in history.\"\n\nAl's honesty on his draft form and his war work for Remington Arms probably got special attention, and, when the managers at the plant cleared him, it saved his neck.\n\nAl certainly owed a debt of gratitude to the manager of the Remington Arms plant, Samuel P. Bush (the grandfather of president George Herbert Walker Bush) and he certainly enjoyed some strangely generous patronage from people in high places after 1918.\n\nHis photo album contains an old Christmas card from Capt. Henri Walters, A.R.E.F., wishing him a Merry X-mas. Henry Walters was a railroad millionaire, the owner of the B&O Railroad, and he sat across the table from Jacob Schiff at B&O board meetings.\n\nBoth of these millionaires financed the American Russian Expeditionary Force -- the United States Army invasion of Russia in 1919, better known as the \"Polar Bear Expedition.\" One of the main goals of this invasion was to retrieve rolling stock (railroad cars) that had been used by Russia to deliver gold (via the Trans Siberian Railway) to Wall Street bankers as payment for rifles made by Remington Arms (Al's employer).\n\nIt's very possible that Al Shernick, as a Russian-speaking employee of Remington Arms and a young man who knew northern Russia quite well, participated in the Polar Bear Expedition of 1919, under the special command of Maj. Gen. William S. Graves (1865 - 1940) of Denver.\n\nBut no official military record of Al's participation has ever been found.\n\nWhat is known for certain is that after 1919 Al Shernick had a good friend in Capt. Henri Walters (1848 - 1931), who not only sat on the board of the Museum of Modern Art, but also maintained a large art collection of his own (today displayed at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland).\n\nPrior to the war, Walters had paid a visit to Princess Julia (Grant) Catacuzene, the daughter of U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant, who was living in St. Petersburg from 1900 to 1920. In 1913 they had paid a visit to the Faberge works, and Walters became very interested in acquiring Faberge Eggs and other objects of priceless Romanov art.\n\nSince Al's sister Ida knew jewelry well, and was in fact well placed within the Jewish community of New York's \"Diamond District,\" there was a fairly obvious convergence of interests. Al's family may have helped Walters to acquire and evaluate Romanov art objects that were suddenly made available on the international market between 1919 and 1925.\n\nIn any event, Al certainly made friends in New York's art world. After the war, he took art lessons at the New School of Fine and Applied Arts in Greenwich Village. He soon became an accomplished painter.\n\nHe also became an accomplished boxer, practicing often at the local gym. Al claimed later that he had been a sparring partner for Benny Leonard, a local hero of the Jewish kids living on the Lower East Side. Leonard became the lightweight champion of the world in 1917. He was a model of good sportsmanship.\n\nAl said he helped the champ train for a Golden Gloves bout. Benny must have been pretty good, because Al's teeth were a mess ever afterward.\n\nAl's broken English and crooked smile certainly hid the fact that he was a well-educated man. According to his sons, he never spoke in Russian, but his sister Ida later insisted that he had been given an extremely good education as a youth in Russia -- more than people realized.\n\nThis was also true of his sisters: Albert's sister Lucille (Shernick) Rogers was classically trained in opera, and an old tin-type photo (which has been lost) showed her outside the opera house in Vienna. sitting in a carriage and wearing a picture hat.\n\nLucille reportedly sang from time to time at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, but that never brought in enough to pay the rent. Consequently, she turned to Vaudeville and became a popular singer at the Minsky Brothers' Burlesque theatre, where theatre reviewers were impressed and praised her for adding a touch of class.\n\nBecause his sister was well known on the Vaudeville circuit, Al had great connections in the theatre world.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1925, Al Shernick worked as a muralist and scene designer for Flo Ziegfeld at the New Amsterdam Theatre. There he met many of the most beautiful Ziegfeld Girls of the flapper era -- including Billie Burke and Fanny Brice -- and a few of the ugliest mobsters too.\n\nAl probably had a nodding acquaintance with comedian David Daniel Kaminsky (better known as Danny Kaye) because Kaminsky was also from Alexandrovsk. Like Lucille Shernick, Danny Kaye also worked at Minsky's for a spell, and the Kaminsky family's burial records at the Mt. Moriah cemetery sometimes appear right next to those of the Shernick family.\n\nAl certainly met Eddie Cantor and Al Jolson at Ziegfeld's. Jolson invited him to paint scenes for the musical \"Bombo\" (1921), which became a big hit.\n\nIn 1922, having established himself a solid reputation in New York theatre circles as an able scenic designer, Al won a commission to work as an assistant to Maxfield Parrish and other painters who were decorating the new Kodak theatre at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. The murals there were commissioned by George Eastman, the well-known inventor of Kodak film.\n\nAbout 1923, Al was allegedly invited by one of his teachers at the New School, Thomas Hart Benton (1889 - 1975), to assist him with a commission to create a set of murals at the Niagara Power Plant (Schoellkopf Station No. 3) at Niagara Falls, New York.\n\nWhen the Schoellkopf plant collapsed in June 1956, Benton was invited back, and he created the famous \"Mural of Father Hennepin at Niagara Falls,\" which was newly renovated in 1999.\n\nWhether Al created some lost murals at the power station in 1923 or not, he certainly travelled from Rochester to the Niagara area during this period and liked it so much he decided to settle in Lockport, NY.\n\nIt should be noted that Lockport's location near Toronto put him within easy travel and shouting distance of his relatives living in Canada, notably his father Harry Shernick (1869 - 1921) of Toronto, whose family had grown to include sisters that Albert hardly knew; and a relative of Albert's aunt Ida (Shernick) Altsitzer, Selman Altsitzer, whose family had moved with Harry and some Cherniack cousins from New York City to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1908. (Selman's daughter Rebecca is listed with Ida Altsitzer and her kids on the 1920 U.S. Census -- Rebecca was making a summer visit).\n\nIn Lockport, Al took an apartment and got a job at the local Maytag dealership. He began to attend local ballrooms and soon made himself a reputation as a talented tango dancer. This has been confirmed by an advertisement found in a local Lockport newspaper.\n\nIn the summer of 1926, he began flirting with a local Scotch-Irish girl named Mildred Belle Shaw. She was the cute beautician who owned \"Midge's Beauty Shoppe,\" the hair salon just above the Conway Maytag Company, Al's employer on Locust Street.\n\nWhenever Mildred went upstairs, Al made compliments that set all the other salesmen to laughing and Midge to blushing. She swore loudly to the other girls in the shop she wouldn't touch that rascally Russian with a ten foot pole.\n\nHow Al talked her into their first date is one of the great mysteries of the 1920s.\n\nThey were married on September 13, 1926, and honeymooned on board one of Conway's Ford Model A trucks.\n\nOn their 13 September 1926 marriage license, filed in Lockport, Niagara County, New York, Albert claims that his mother's maiden name was Bluma Davis -- a claim that completely contradicts Bluma's 1936 death certificate, which clearly says her maiden name was Savransky.\n\nHe was hiding his Jewish heritage.\n\nMidge preserved in her own scrap book a letter from Albert's sister, Lucille, who congratulates Albert on his marriage and asks, rather awkwardly, whether the girl is Jewish?\n\nLucille got no reply.\n\nThe subject was awkward for Al. But not for Midge.\n\nMildred (Shaw) Shernick, Albert's newly minted wife, lovingly wrote down Al's family history by hand. Her notes say basically the same thing that Albert's sister Ida told his son David in 1955: Albert had three brothers, whom he called Jacob, Mark and David Shernick, and three sisters, whom he called Ida, Lucille and Bertha Shernick.\n\nMidge did her best to preserve Albert's family history -- what little he told her.\n\nIn 1927 Al and Midge had their first son, David. They lived for a short time in comfortable two-storey house in Buffalo. But the stock market crash of 1929 put an end to their halcyon days, and put Al out of work.\n\nIn 1930, Mildred moved to Denver, Colorado, to live with her Aunt Sadie (Sarah McGill Shaw) and Uncle Harry Haskins while Al looked for work. Flat broke, Al finally threw in the towel, hopped a train and joined Midge in Denver.\n\nUncle Harry helped Al to find odd jobs around Denver, and after a year they had scraped together enough to buy a very small WPA house on York Street.\n\nIn December of 1931, they had another boy, whom they named Robert in memory of Mildred's father. His crib was the upper drawer of their dresser. Their new baby very nearly died because he wasn't digesting properly. The doctors were stumped. He was finally saved by a home remedy which his grandmother Stoddard sent by telegram: the whites from goose eggs coated his small stomach properly, he settled down, stopped crying and the whole family finally got a good night's sleep.\n\nThis small family survived the Great Depression, the Dustbowl and the troubling days that led to World War II through sheer gumption and ingenuity: They grew Victory gardens, raised rabbits and chickens, invented new recipes for potatoes and rhubarb pie, patched old clothes, pinched pennies, rationed their food and gasoline carefully, and whenever possible pitched in to help and comfort neighbors who were suffering the loss of loved ones during the war.\n\nBlessed with two parents who had a talent for telling stories, the Shernick boys never lacked entertaining conversation around the dinner table. Dave and Rob grew up listening to radio dramas, practicing their Boy Scout knots and archery, inventing their own games and building their own toys. Rob became especially fond of building his own model airplanes out of balsa wood -- a hobby he kept his entire life.\n\nDuring the late 1930s, Al spent his days painting clever and very carefully lettered signs for local businesses. He made a little extra money during the Christmas seasons by taking dangerous jobs that no one else wanted or could do. Standing on an icy ledge, he hung holiday decorations at the top of the Daniels and Fisher tower in downtown Denver (another workman holding him above a twelve storey drop by nothing but his belt).\n\nOne of the few local craftsmen with experience in the application of gold leaf (a skill he picked up at his sister's jewelry store) he also landed a job adding gold leaf to the Denver Capitol dome.\n\nAccording to family legend, Al was moonlighting during this period with some of Denver's best-known artists: Allen True and Herndon Davis. Like Allen True, Al Shernick helped to decorate the Brown Palace Hotel (a Denver landmark), and he claimed that he was working as an assistant to Herndon Davis when Davis painted the famous \"Face on the Barroom Floor\" at the Teller House in Central City.\n\nDuring the second World War, Al worked, once again, for Remington Arms. They opened a new ammunition plant near Denver, the Denver Federal Center, and Al joined the large mob of formerly unemployed workmen seeking a patriotic paycheck.\n\nBy talking with the plant managers, he also won himself a spot on the crew that gave the entire plant a new coat of paint.\n\nAfter the war, Al started his own house painting company. Eventually, by working overtime, he earned enough money to hire his own crew and buy a new house in Lakewood.\n\nBy the late 1940s, as his sons were completing their studies at Lakewood High, the family had enough to own two cars.\n\nUnfortunately, a serious fall from high scaffolding put Al in the hospital, and after a difficult surgery he was forced to slow down.\n\nSobered by this experience, the loss of parents, the beginning of the nuclear age and the onset of the Korean War, the entire family joined the Catholic Church on the same day in 1955. They soldiered forward.\n\nAl and Midge celebrated the marriages of their sons (both veterans) in the late 1950s. They soon became grandparents.\n\nLeft with an empty nest, their job as parents done, Al and Midge faced the end of the 1950s, the election of John F. Kennedy and the beginning of the Space Age in quiet retirement.\n\nAl met his end suddenly on a hot day in mid-August 1961, felled by a heart attack. One cannot say that it was unexpected: Like many men of his age, he had been a hard-drinking man and a heavy smoker his entire adult life. God knows how many gallons of turpentine and solvents he had inhaled during his career as a painter.\n\nGiven how many deadly ingredients his wife added to her annual Christmas fruitcakes (which ought to have been classified as a Cold War weapon system) it's truly amazing that he lasted as long as he did.\n\nAl was not a perfect man, but on the whole he left a good rep. His wife certainly loved him with a devotion not found often amongst women of the following generation: Midge sincerely mourned his loss for two decades and wore his wedding ring until her dying day.\n\nAl's most lasting contribution to the Denver art community, perhaps, was the series of vivid and highly realistic nature scenes he painted for the Denver Nature and Science Museum . . . wildlife dioramas that continue to fascinate visiting school children.\n\nAfter a long and rewarding career as a muralist, fine artist, and house painter, Al Shernick was laid to rest on the burial grounds of the Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Wheatridge, Jefferson County, CO.\n\nMore than 25 years later, he was joined there by Midge -- whose heart was always with him\n\nTheir Find-A-Grave Memorial may be viewed by clicking on the link here.\n\nA Hidden Lineage: Descent from the Counts Chernyshev?\n\nWith a tendency by Ida to contradict the official record in mind, we read the following narrative, which was told to David Shernick, the son of Albert Shernick, by Ida (Shernick) Altsitzer Gluck at Miami Beach, Florida, during the second week of December 1955:\n\n\"Albert Harry Shernick (Russian Equiv: Abraham Chernikov) born May 20, 1899 in Alexandrovska, Russia, in the Ukraine, [was] the 7th of 8 children. Other children were Ida, Mark, Jacob, David, Lucille, Bertha, Albert (dad), and unnamed child who died at birth.\n\n\"Mother was Russian, father an importer, exporter of hay to Turkey, watermelons to England, Administrator of Tolstoy estate and also varied managerial capacities in several businesses. He inherited this business from his father.\n\n\"Grandfather [Harry] Shernick [Senior] died in 1905, and the grave is still in evidence in Alexandrovska at report of immigrant in 1948.\n\n\"During the war of Russia and Turkey (the Crimean War of 1853 - 1856}, our grandfather's brother was a General, in charge of the campaign. This position was obtained thru the ranks from a conscription at the age of 3. The campaign was so successful that the Czar gave the general the Christian (or Russian Orthodox Catholic) name of Chernikov and title of Count, and rights, privileges, etc. for all relatives. This was a great deal, as the General and our grandfather were half Jewish (makes us 1/8th), and during that time in Russia, no Jew had any rights at all.\"\n\nThe reference to a famous general in charge of Russia's campaign during the Crimean War of 1853-1856 is a fairly clear and straightforward reference to Count Alexander Ivanovich Chernyshev (1786 - 1857), the commander in chief of the entire Russian army during the Crimean War. The last name Chernyshev is sometimes Englished as Chernyshov, Czernichow or Chernikhov.\n\nIt must be noted that the famous Counts Chernyshev were indeed descendants of the Czarniecki family of Posen, and as officers in the Russian military they were enlisted in Guard units as early as the age of 3. This was not made up. It was a tradition, within the Russian nobility, to show their loyalty to the Czar by enlisting their children as infants into honor guard units like the Preobrazhensky Life Guards regiment.\n\nIda was clearly telling David Shernick that her father, Hersz Czerniakhowski or Tchernichovsky, Senior, somehow descended from one of the famous Counts Chernyshev, perhaps a little known and unlisted brother of Gen. Alexander I. Chernyshev, who certainly married and had a son named Lev Alexandrovich Chernyshev (1837 - 1864).\n\nThe exact lineage is muddled.\n\nWhat is crystal clear is the great favor the Counts Chernyshev enjoyed during the reigns of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great. Count Zakhar Grigorievich Chernyshev (1722 - 1784) is even rumored to have been a lover of Catherine the Great. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Catherine appointed Count Zakhar Chernyshev to be the governor of Poland, and he lived the final decade of his life on a huge estate near Mogilev.\n\nAlbert Shernick's Jewish relatives, the Czernichow and Tchernichovsky families, appear very clearly on the census records for Mogilev.\n\nWith regard to administration of the Tolstoy family's estate, one may confirm that the manager for the estate of the famous Count Leo Tolstoy was Vladimir G. Chertkov (1854 - 1936), who was indeed a descendant of the Chernyshev family on his mother's side.\n\nSpecifically, Chertkov's mother, Elizaveta Chernysheva-Kruglikova (1832 - 1922), was a descendant (through her mother) of Count Gregory Ivanovich Chernyshev (1762 - 1831), whom one might mistake for a brother of Gen. Alexander Ivanovich Chernyshev (1786 - 1857), if one believed that they were both the sons of Gregory's father, Count Ivan Gregorievich Chernyshev (1726 - 1797).\n\nChertkov and the Tolstoyans were strong supporters for a group of Russian peacniks and pacifists called Doukhobors. From their base in England, the Tolstoyans had sponsored and overseen the emigration of a large number of Doukhobors from farms in Russia to farms in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Canada.\n\nWe have found a very clear record of members of the Czernichow-Czernichowsky family living in England, notably in London, under variant spellings of their last name. They seem to be strongly connected to the Jewish College of London and the Galveston Movement, a plan to help Jewish immigrants enter America through the southern port of Galveston, Texas, where railway connections could easily take them to cities in the Midwest.\n\nThe Galveston Movement was largely financed by Baron Horace Gunzburg, of Kiev, whose maternal relatives, the Rawsky family, intermarried with the Czernichowsky family of Tarascha. During the early 20th century, the Galveston Movement was being led by Rabbi Henry Cohen (1863 - 1952), whose family originated in Tarascha, Ukraine.\n\nThe S.S. Czar, on which Aaron or Abram Czernichow arrived at New York in 1913, was in fact a Doukhobor ship. Large numbers of Russian peaceniks were on board, trying to escape the war.\n\nOverall, then, Ida would seem to be saying that their Jewish branch of the Tchernichovsky or Czernichow-Czernichowsky family were peacenik descendants of the much-more-famous Counts Chernyshev, via an unclear and unnamed brother of Gen. Alexander Ivanovich Chernyshev, whom (she claimed) was half Jewish.\n\nConclusion: Those interested in pursuing the history of the Czernichow family and its lineage may want to look for Czernichows in Ukrainian census and Polish census records. They may enjoy more success if they concentrate on places strongly associated with the Chernyshev family and their noble relatives, the Bobrinsky family. The Chernyshev family estates at Mogilev and the Bobrinsky family estates near Tarascha, Kiev deserve special attention.\n\nWas Jakob a member of the Tsar's Guard?\n\nIda's claim of relationship to Russian nobility is a tall tale, and one might dismiss it out of hand. Their family were Jewish.\n\nYet if one examines carefully the Shernick family group photo (attached), taken about 1903, which Albert preserved, it shows his older \"brother\" Jakob wearing a Russian army uniform.\n\nSpecifically, Jakob is wearing the uniform of an unterofficer in His Majesty's 1st Life Guards Rifle Battalion -- an elite unit of the Tsar's Guard which Jewish commoners could not possibly join. To join a unit of the Tsar's guard required one to provide proof of three generations of nobility. One also had to provide a letter of recommendation from a Russian general vouching for one's character and loyalty.\n\nThere were only two well-known Jewish families who were ever allowed to join the Tsar's Life Guard regiments: The Davydov family and the Chernyshev family. In fact both of those families ran into serious political trouble after the death of Tsar Alexander I on 1 December 1825 and the Decembrist Revolt of late December 1825, an attempt by the Tsar's guard to depose the new Tsar Nicholas I in favor of his older brother, the Grand Duke Constantine.\n\nTsar Nicholas I put Gen. Alexander Ivanovich Chernyshev in charge of rooting out the rebellious guardsmen, and Alexander did so with zeal, showing zero mercy to members of his own family. As a result of his fierce loyalty to Tsar Nicholas, Chernyshev was rewarded with the title of Count.\n\nWhen Vasily Davidov (1780 - 1855) was convicted of participating in the revolt, and exiled to Siberia, two of Davidov's daughters were sent to live with the family of Countess Sofia Gregorievna Chernysheva-Kruglikova (1799 - 1847) -- the very family from which Vladimir Chertkov, administrator of the Tolstoy estate, descends.\n\nIt was said at the time that Gen. Alexander Chernyshev, who was the descendant of a \"down-market\" (read: Jewish) branch of the Chernyshevs, was quite eager to depose his Orthodox cousins, the descendants of Count Gregory Chernyshev, in an effort to grab up the estates of the elder branch of the Chernyshev family.\n\nThe comments made by Russian historians on General Chernyshev's behavior and motivations during this period very specifically refer to him as a dis-inherited or illegitimate cousin of the better known Counts Chernyshev.\n\nIf Ida Shernick was lying and telling tall tales, and if her little-known \"illegitimate\" branch of the Czernichow or Chernikov family were not in some way related to the famous Counts Chernyshev, the \"Chernyshev majorat\" or senior branch, then it is awfully difficult to explain how Jakob managed to join such an elite Guard unit at all. Why was Jakob allowed to join the Tsar's Guard?\n\nThe answer seems to be that Ida's branch of the family truly were related to Gen. Alexander Ivanovich Chernyshev, who (according to Wikipedia) became a general of the Light Division of the Tsar's Guard in 1821, and who accelerated to the rank of Count (1826) and then Minister of War (1832) for showing fierce loyalty to Tsar Nicholas I.\n\nAlbert's older \"brother\" (uncle) Mark (aka Moishe, Mordtke or \"Max\" Sharnick) certainly seems to have served briefly in elite units of the Tsar's Guard, prior to the 1905 revolution. An examination of old guard unit photos has turned up at least three photographs of men who strongly resemble Max.\n\nAs a child, Albert Shernick was definitely photographed wearing little military caps and Buster Brown sailor suits -- a cute fashion for military children that was popular in 1900. Whether Albert was enlisted in a cadet school as a young boy is unknown.\n\nAlbert told his sons that he remembered seeing the \"beginnings of the Russian Revolution\" (the Pogroms of 1905) while growing up as a boy in Russia. Albert's father (grandfather) Harry Senior was a wealthy merchant, and they lived quite comfortably. Al said he remembered his family's large mansion in Moscow, which had chandeliers, and their winter sleigh, which was drawn by beautiful horses.\n\nAlbert attended local schools and was given additional training by his older sister Ida, who worked as a tutor and governess.\n\nAfter the Pogroms of 1905, this Jewish branch of the famous Czernichow family clearly lost their enthusiasm for participation in Russian military operations.\n\nIda and her husband, Harry Altsitzer, left for the United States in 1907.\n\nIn 1913, as World War I approached, Albert and his male cousins were in serious danger of being drafted into the Russian army and killed. The Czernichow (Tchernichovsky) family (peaceniks by association with Tolstoy and the Doukhobor movement) therefore made quick arrangements for their children and teenagers to be sent to America, a neutral country where they had many relatives who could look after them.\n\nChief among these relatives were ida's father in Canada and cousins in New York. Ida's father, Gedalia or Gertzel-Al Czerniakhovsky (\"Harry Shernick Jr.\") had emigrated to New York during the 1890s and settled in Philadelphia. For many years he lived in Philadelphia, aiding the local Jewish families in their effort to help Tolstoyan Christians and Jews find refuge in America. Harry was very proud of a written certificate that he had received from Tsar Nicholas II, signed by the Tsar himself, which named Harry as an official representative of Russia's emigration service.\n\nNaftali Hersz \"Harry\" Cherniack (1869 - 1951) certainly offered assistance. He was living part-time in Philadelphia in 1913, just across the river from Trenton, New Jersey, where Ida Shernick Altsitzer had landed when she immigrated to America in 1907. They both attended the Chabad-Lubavich Temple in Philadelphia, and probably put their heads together on weekends.\n\nNathan-Harry bought the steamship tickets required at the Rosenbaum bank in Philadelphia during the spring of 1913. This we know because the records of those banks are now a searchable database.\n\nThe fact that Ida's Uncle Max and cousin Nathan-Harry Cherniack bought the ticket for Albert Harry Shernick certainly suggests that either Max or Harry could be Albert's true father. Ida's family certainly cared about Albert. We also have a written and official request for passports by Hershko M. Czerniakow, written in the Russian language, and notorized by an attorney in Philadelphia.\n\nBut the record is not entirely clear. About Albert's actual parentage, people were hush-hush.\n\nAlbert and Bluma were also helped by Abraham M. Shornick (1871 - 1922), Nathan Harry's brother, who offered to help financially. To appreciate how generous this was, you have to realize Abraham was then surviving as a clothing factory \"cutter\" in the garment district of New York, supporting a large family of his own. The fact that Abraham was mighty generous to little Abraham leads us to suspect that Abraham M. was Albert's dad.\n\nBut where is the proof?\n\nNo birth records have been found to prove Albert's parentage or place of birth. The registrar of the City of New York has confirmed that they have no birth record for Albert H. Shernick in New York City in 1899.\n\nAfter lots of digging, we are left once again stumped.\n\nFalsified Records: A Red Spy Network at Work?\n\nEfforts to verify the Shernick family legend have been extraordinarily difficult.\n\nFor example, when one examines the Social Security death record for Ida Shernick Altsitzer Gluck, it says she was born 19 December 1887, which means she cannot possibly be the sister of Lucille Shernick. Why? Because the death certificate for Lucille (Schernick) Rogers says she was born 18 April 1888 in Tennessee. For two sisters to be born four months apart on opposite sides of the Earth does not make sense. Either they are half-sisters, with different birth mothers, and the story of Harry Chernick's second wife has been erased entirely, or the informants who gave the information for the two death certificates lied.\n\nTheir stories don't match.\n\nThere's another problem with Ida: Her birth records. A search turns up nothing but a close match to the 25 December 1887 birth record of Albertine Ida Antonie Scherneck, who was born in Berlin.\n\nThe problem with this match: Little Albertine Ida Scherneck died on 12 June 1888, at age 5 months. Ida has a dead double. This suggests that the woman who calls herself Ida Schernick may have come from Berlin, may have stolen Albertine Ida's identity to create a fake passport, and may have entered the United States under false identity papers. Ida Schernick might not be who she says she is.\n\nIda's death record names her mother as Bluma Loransky. Lucille's death certificate gives no maiden name for Bluma at all, and it says she was the daughter of Mark Schernick, not Harry Chernikov. Ida and Lucille don't match or agree on the name of their mother or their father.\n\nWhen one finds Albert's 1926 License to marry Mildred Shaw, Albert swears that his mother's maiden name was Bluma Davis. Yet Bluma's official 1936 death certificate gives her maiden name as Sobronski and her father's family appears in U.S. census records under variant spellings: Safronski, Szafranski, Savransky.\n\nBluma's 1936 death certificate was found in New York (after a great deal of difficulty) under the spelling Chernick, not Shernick. It says that Bluma was buried at the Mt. Moriah Cemetery in Fairview, New Jersey (across the river from Central Park). But on the gates of the Mt. Moriah Cemetery she is listed as B. Schernick (a third spelling). She lived in New York for 20 years (1914 to 1936) but never filed for citizenship, so there are no naturalization papers to clarify her place of birth or confirm the name of her spouse. When one finally finds her amongst passenger lists for the year 1914, she appears as Bluma Czernichow (a fourth name spelling),\n\nIn none of these documents has she been confirmed as the birth mother for Albert Shernick. Albert appears with Bluma in three or four photos, but only once on the U.S. Census: in the 1915 New Jersey State census for Trenton, which lists Bluma as the mother of Ida and which lists Albert as the brother of Ida. That does not necessarily mean that Bluma was Albert's birth mother.\n\nTHE SEARCH FOR ALBERT'S TRUE MOTHER\n\nWhy not trust Ida's family legend and trust the New Jersey census when it says that Bluma is Albert's mother? Why be skeptical and paranoid?\n\nSimple:\n\n1. Albert does not know his own mother's maiden name. Either he's the kind of guy who gets the name of his own mother wrong or he's the kind of guy who would lie on his own wedding license. Scary.\n\n2. Ida and Lucille also got Bluma's maiden name wrong. Scarier and scarier. What are they hiding?\n\n3. Right next to Bluma Schernick's name on the Mt. Moriah cemetery gate is that of Mr. and Mrs. B.M. Morros -- Boris Michael Morros, a Hollywood music composer and notorious Cold War spy who was arrested by the FBI in 1947 after serving the Soviet Union for three years. Code name: FROST. The FBI caught Morros after counterintelligence experts working for the Venona Project found his name among coded messages being sent from the Russian embassy in New York to Moscow\n\nBluma came from the very same immigration group as Boris -- an immigration group that included the Rosenberg family. This can be confirmed by travelling to New York and reviewing the records for the Friends of Alexandrovsk Benevolent Association at the YIVO Institute. The name of Boris Morros very definitely appears among the Membership List, right next to the names of J. Rosenberg and Lucille Rogers, Albert's sister.\n\nThis is cause for concern.\n\nFinally: When it comes to spies, the Cherniaks are nearly as famous in Russia as James Bond in England. Yehven Cherniak is sometimes called the James Bond of Russia, and Yan Chernyak is one of the greatest espionage heroes of World War II.\n\nWhile guilt by association is never fair, we are talking about Atomic spies here, and Russian superspy Yan Cherniak was part of the very same Atomic spy ring. The Wikipedia on Yan Cherniak says Chernyak was \"instrumental in developing the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons program,\" which means he was very much in league with Boris Morros, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Morris and Lona Cohen and Soviet hero Atomic spy George Koval when it came to ripping off America's blueprints for building an Atomic bomb.\n\nThis certainly raises a red flag.\n\nIt means at the very least that when dealing with the immigration records of the Chernick or Cherniak family in the United States, we must be prepared to find the fingerprints of the GRU and the FBI all over their files -- that is, what is left of their immigration files after the FBI got done going ape all over them.\n\nIt means also that one must not be too surprised to find members of the Cherniak family who arrived in America during World War I or World War II wearing wigs and mustaches and giving out false names -- or forgetting the names of their own mothers.\n\nAlbert Shernick and Ida Shernick are, apparently, wearing wigs and behaving like artful dodgers. What they are forgetting to tell us is a lot. All of their immigration documents and identity papers must therefore be double- and triple-checked.\n\nWe want as much paperwork as we can get to prove Albert's identity. When it comes to something even as simple as finding his Last Name at Birth, Albert Schernick Shernick Chernick Cherniak Czernik Czernichow Czernichowsky is a real piece of work.\n\nObviously one way to confirm that Bluma was Albert's mother and also get her maiden name would be to find Albert's birth record or birth certificate -- preferrably a document that Albert has not filled out himself. Albert's death certificate says he was born in New York City, New York, so a birth certificate from 1899 ought to be available.\n\nBut a formal request to the city's recorder produces no birth certificate, and a search of the city's birth records database at Ancestry yields no results for Albert Harry Shernick. Nothing found under that spelling.\n\nThe ship's passenger list for the S.S. Czar showing Albert's arrival with Bluma on 29 July 1914 indicates they originated in Alexandrovsk, Ukraine, but a search of Ukrainian records depends on an exact spelling of the name and the correct birth location. So far, a search for Abraham Czernichow (the name listed on the passenger list) has produced no Ukrainian birth record matches.\n\nOn Albert's 1917 World War I draft card (attached), which certainly can be found, Albert says he is living at 275 Nepperhan Avenue in Yonkers. He also says he was born in Ekaterinoslav, Russia, which means the claim that he was born in New York was a lie. In fact on all U.S. Census records prior to 1940, Albert gives his birth place as Russia. Only on the 1940 U.S. Census does he begin to claim that he was born in New York.\n\nOn his WWI Draft registration, Albert names his nearest relative as Mrs. Luby Shernick (mother, underscored twice). In other words, the \"name of mother\" he put on his 1926 application for a marriage license, Bluma Davis, does not agree with the name he gave for his mother on his 1917 draft registration card, \"Luby.\"\n\nA search of Yonkers City Directories does in fact list one Luby Schernick, a widow, living in Yonkers. But it gives no age.\n\nIf we assume this listing is for Bluma, then it means Bluma's real name was Liebe -- but that name is not used on her immigration forms or her death records.\n\nIf we assume that \"Luby\" refers to Lucille Schernick, Albert's sister \"Lucille\" whose maiden might be Liuba Schernick in Russian, that means Lucille is actually Albert's mother. But Lucille was born 1888 and too young to be the mother of a child born in 1899. In fact, Lucille's social security records give her actual birth date as 19 April 1890. She couldn't possibly be Albert's mom.\n\nDARK INVADERS\n\nWhy does identifying Albert's mom correctly really matter? For national security reasons. Albert and Bluma arrived in the United States in July 1914, in the middle of what is known as the July Crisis that preceded the world war.\n\nThey were German-Russians, and this was the last chance for Germany or Russia to slip some of its agents into the United States. The possibility that members of Albert's family were sent to the U.S. as illegal agents or spies under false identities cannot be dismissed entirely. As we shall see, Albert's family certainly had close connections to the intelligence services of Russia, Germany, and England.\n\nThey were truly international travellers, and as such they were ideal agents.\n\nThe story of how Germany in particular set up elaborate spy networks in preparation for World War I has been told by German spy chief Franz von Rintelen in his 1933 book The Dark Invader: Wartime Reminiscences of a German Naval Intelligence Officer.\n\nit appears that Albert and his family, in ways still not fully understood, did participate in a German spy ring of some kind. Based on his war time history, Albert seems to have been serving as a German saboteur.\n\nIn his World War I draft card, Albert lists his employer as the Remington Arms manufacturing plant in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was working there as a machinist.\n\nThis was in fact a very important arms manufacturing plant, one that churned out millions of bullets and mortar rounds that were being shipped to Europe to support the allied war effort against Germany. For exactly this reason, the Remington Arms factory in Hoboken, New Jersey was targeted by German saboteurs.\n\nWas Albert Schernick a German agent? Well if he was, he was a good one.\n\nIn fact German saboteurs successfully destroyed the Remington Arms plant at Hoboken in what is now known as the Black Tom Explosion of July 30, 1916. According to Wikipedia, the explosion \"killed at least four people and destroyed some $20,000,000 ($540 million in 2024 dollars) worth of military goods. This incident, which happened prior to U.S. entry into World War I, also damaged the Statue of Liberty. It was one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions in history.\"\n\nIt would be nice to make sure that Albert Schernick was not one of the German saboteurs who were responsible for this explosion. But, unfortunately, the very large number of spies in his immigration group and the multiple lies told in his immigration documents point in the opposite direction.\n\nALBERT'S DISAPPEARANCE LEADS TO A DISCOVERY\n\nWhere was Albert during the war and the Russian Revolution? It's difficult to say. He disappears from the radar.\n\nThe 1920 U.S. Census does not help. Albert does not appear to be anywhere on the 1920 census -- although Ida and Bluma are clearly listed, he is not in their household.\n\nThis puzzle of Albert's disappearance in 1920 was solved when it was discovered that Albert Shernick has a double, named Aaron Cherniack, who also was born on May 20, 1899.\n\nAaron appears as \"Harry Cherniak\" on the 1920 U.S. Census, the son of Harry and Lena (Gelles) Cherniak. Lena Cherniak was also called Leiba on some of her official records. If we assume that Albert and Aron are one and the same person, then this not only explains why Albert lists his mother as Luby on his draft registration, but also explains why he disappears on the 1920 U.S. Census: He is living with his dad, Harry Cherniak and his mom Lena \"Luby\" Cherniak under the name Harry Cherniak.\n\nLena Gelles (Luby) was not a widow in 1919, rather she was alone or \"widowed\" because her husband Harry was overseas and serving in the military. By 1920 Harry has returned, and he did not go to live with Bluma and Ida because either a) He divorced Bluma, or b) He is a disconnected relative who never was her husband. For example, he might be Bluma's brother-in-law, or the brother of Bluma's husband. Bluma could be Ida's mother but Albert's aunt.\n\nAt this point, the claim that \"Bluma Davis\" is Albert's mother begins to look like 100 percent fiction. Why would Albert lie to his wife and sons about his birth family? Did he lie about the name of his birth father as well?\n\nWHY ALBERT NEVER INTRODUCED MILDRED TO HIS FAMILY\n\nThe puzzle over Albert's parentage leads to an even bigger puzzle: Why was Mildred never introduced to Albert's mother and father personally, when they were living nearby?\n\nWhat was Albert hiding?\n\nThe answer: Cherchez la femme.\n\nAlbert Harry Shernick, under his alternate identity as Aaron Harry Cherniack, already had a wife. Aron Cherniak married on 11 December 1923 to a nice Jewish girl named Esther Rittoff. Their first child, Theodore, was born 23 June 1925, a year before Albert married Mildred Shaw.\n\nIf Albert and Aaron are one and the same person, then this is a problem. It means Albert was a bigamist.\n\nAn examination of the circumstances surrounding Albert's marriage in 1926 indicates he and Mildred \"married in a fever.\" They eloped. Mildred kept a very complete photo album of her family, and the photos of the days surrounding her wedding show group photos with her own family: Shaws, Perrys, Longs, Stoddards, aunts, uncles, cousins, grouped happily around her at a honeymoon wedding picnic and a family feast.\n\nBut there is not a single photo of Albert's family. Not one. For some reason not a single member of Albert's huge Jewish family in New York was invited to the wedding feast.\n\nThe group photo of Albert's family, taken about 1903, is the only one that he ever provided to Mildred. He provided that and some tall tales, told around the dinner table to his sons. The only other contact with his family in New York City was Ida and Ida's son, Will Altsitzer. Mildred's notes indicate she also met with Albert's \"sister\" Lucille, but Lucille's family history stories were very different from Ida's version, and they left Mildred very confused.\n\nALBERT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE: THE MISSING PIECE\n\nTo confirm Albert's true identity, we need his real birth date and his real birth place and the name of his true mother. How do we get these?\n\nA good place to start would be his Naturalization papers. If he was born in Russia, he was legally required to file for citizenship. But he never did. That is, he did not file for citizenship under the name \"Albert Shernick.\"\n\nWhen one tries to find Albert's naturalization papers at Ancestry.com, one finds no citizenship papers for Albert at all. But look under the name Aaron Cherniak, and bingo! One finds the papers for one Aaron Czerniak, who was born May 20, 1899. Aaron departed from the same port as Albert, Libau, Latvia, and he arrived at the same port, Ellis Island, aboard the same ship, the S.S. Czar, but he arrives seven months earlier, on 23 December 1913, while Albert and Bluma arrive 29 July 1914 aboard the Czar.\n\nAlbert's son, Robert, insists that Albert never, ever mentioned having a twin brother named Aaron. Yet here is a man with exactly the same birth date as Albert, arriving on exactly the same ship as Albert, and arriving on Christmas Eve, not in the summer. When one goes back to Mildred Shernick's handwritten notes, they mention a story by Ida Shernick in which she remembers Albert first arriving in New York \"on Christmas Eve.\"\n\nGiven the arrival of Avram Itzke Czernichow at Ellis Island on board the S.S. Czar with Bluma Czrnichow 29 July 1914, that story that Ida told about Albert arriving on Christmas Eve makes absolutely no sense whatever unless Aaron Czerniak and Avram Czernichow are one and the same person. The person who arrived on Christmas Eve was Aaron.\n\nTHE OTHER ALBERT\n\nIt appears at first glance that Aaron Czerniak was a twin brother whom Albert and Ida never ever mentioned, which throws their honesty and their entire family legend into question. If one treats Aaron and Albert as two different people, then it means Albert told only half the truth about his family, stubbornly refusing to mention a twin brother for his entire life.\n\nBut if one accepts that Aaron and Albert are the very same person, there is no contradiction at all. Aaron arrived December 13, 1913, then he went back to get Bluma, returning on a second trip in July (a genuinely heroic deed, because it was an extremely long journey during a period when Europe was on the brink of war and he stood a good chance of being drafted). He Just re-entered the United States under a different spelling of the name, Avram Itzke Czernichow on 29 July 1914.\n\nAccept that they are one and the same person, and we have found the next best thing to a birth certificate; Aaron's petition to become a U.S. citizen and naturalization papers, including his signed loyalty oath.\n\nOn these naturalization papers, he confirms his birth date as 20 May 1899 and his birthplace as Ekaterinoslav, but does not specify a city of origin. He also names his wife, Esther, and their two children, and gives birth dates for his kids.\n\nThese travel records, combined with Aaron's Naturalization records, point us toward the Holy Grail we've been seeking: The true name of Albert mother, the city of his birth, and the date of his birth. Find these, and we have a chance of finding \"Albert's\" official birth records, census records, and military records in Russia.\n\nProblem: When we pursue the records of Albert's \"twin brother,\" Aaron, we encounter not one but several children with similar names and birth dates.\n\nThe records of Aaron Harry Cherniak of New York must also be disentangled from those of a cousin, Aron Israel Cherniak of Chicago, whose papers indicate that Aaron Israel was born 1896 at Kiev. Aaron Israel Cherniak first arrived in New York in 1908, and the ship's passenger list indicates that in that year his family were living at Zbaraz, Ukraine.\n\nThis Aaron from Chicago was born at Vyshgorod, a suburb of Kiev, Ukraine. Since Aaron from Chicago is a first cousin, his records may be sitting right next to those of Aaron from New York. What we want are the records for Aaron of New York, and we expect his mom to be either Lena Gelles or Bluma Savransky.\n\nThe records of the Savransky family in Ukraine show a large group of them living at a shtetl near Tarascha, Ukraine, just south of Kiev, and working on the estates of the Russian counts Bobrinsky, founders of the Russian sugar industry.\n\nHere at least is a fairly good fix on the right birth place: Kiev, Ukraine. But where specifically do we go to hunt for birth records? Tarascha looks like the right place to start digging, because there are so many Savranskys living there.\n\nThe Czerniachowsky family also show up on the records of Tarascha.\n\nDIGGING UP SCARY SKELETONS\n\nWhen we start digging in local Ukrainian records, we start turning up some really scary skeletons.\n\nThe problem is this: The Wikipedia for Tarascha says it is strongly associated with the politician Oleksander Moroz - a noted leader of the Socialist Party. That means we are right back in the orbit of Oleksander's relative, the notorious spy Boris Moroz.\n\nPerhaps the thing to do is Google spies from Tarascha, to get a better overview of the socialist and communist networks that were at work there and sent agents to the United States.\n\nIf you look at the history of Russian spies and the Wikipedia list of notable Atomic Spies (Russian agents who stole the blueprints for the Atomic Bomb), number one on the list of notables is Morris Cohen. The family of Morris Cohen are also from Tarascha, Ukraine, according to the History of Jewish Cities in Ukraine, a webpage that gives many photos of Tarashcha and its families. This claim is backed up by the FBI Files on Morris and Lona Cohen and Barnes Carr's 2016 book Operation Whisper.\n\nDo the Shernicks have any connections to the Cohen family? Yup.\n\nWhen one searches further for Aaron's father, Harry Shernick or Chernick, one finds a Harry Shernick of the right age living in Toronto, Ontario, on the 1921 Canada Census. He is listed in Toronto City Directories as a horseshoe maker and blacksmith. More importantly, one Toronto city directory indicates he sometimes uses the name Harry Cohen. The names Harry Shernick and Harry Cohen are listed side-by-side at the same address.\n\nWhen one researches the name Harry Cohen, one finds a match with Harry Cohen of Galveston, Texas, one of the rabbis who led the Galveston Movement -- a subject of great interest to Anne Hagedorn, the author of Sleeper Agent, a book about Atomic spy George Koval. It seems that Russian-Jewish immigration from Ukraine was funded largely by Baron Horace Gunzburg and Baron Maurice de Hirsch, both of Kiev. Both wanted to avoid U.S. legislation that might place caps or strict quotas on the immigration of Russian Jews, so they sent Rabbi Harry Cohen to Galveston to help organize a major effort to use the port of Galveston more often.\n\nIt was this port through which the family of Atomic spy George Koval passed in the early 1900s, with the result that George was communist in politics but brought up in Iowa City, with perfect English. He loved baseball and seemed to be an All-American kid, hence his ability to move with ease into a position of trust within the Manhattan Project in 1943.\n\nIdentifying Cohen, Hirsch and Gunzburg as the leaders of the Galveston movement also explains another puzzle: How did the Savransky family and the Ida Shernick Altsitzer family get their training in a fancy trade like diamond cutting and watch repair? This is an expensive hobby.\n\nGINZBURG, HIRSCH AND THE GOLDEN KEY CLUB\n\nTurns out that Baron Maurice de Hirsch was a very big fan of trade school education for the Jewish people, and Count Bobrinsky, of Tarascha, trained many of his local serfs and Jewish peasants in arts and crafts. Bobrinsky wanted expert jewelers in order to manage his own jewelry collection: So he trained people at his own expense. They received an excellent education in tradecraft.\n\nBobrinsky apparently trained members of the Savransky and Shernick family to work as skilled jewelers, painters and engravers. They made jewelry for Count Bobrinsky and also became silversmiths. By no small coincidence, the largest Soviet spy ring in the United States was called the Silvermaster Spy Ring. As journalist Anne Hagedorn points out in her book on Atomic spy George Koval, Sleeper Agent (2021),George Koval and many Soviet spies came to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s using false passports, and they raised money by using New York jewelry stores in Brooklyn and the Bronx.\n\nJewelry stores like Ida's were being used as communist fronts, according to Hagedorn's book. They played a key role in financing socialist spy networks, and financing Jewish immigration to the United States through the Galveston network.\n\nWhen you look at the records of George Koval, his father was a leader of the Workmen's Circle or Arbeiter Ring, a labor movement to which Ida Shernick Altsitzer definitely belonged. The Kovals lived in the Bronx, and the family of Morris Cohen are liviing only a couple blocks away from Ida's residence on the Grand Concourse in 1925.\n\nLike a flock of migrating sparrows, the community of Tarashcha, Ukraine stuck together. Which explains why one finds the family of three major Atomic spies all from the same neighborhood: They were from the very same immigration community.\n\nTHE ARBEITER RING: THE WORKMEN'S CIRCLE\n\nWhen one searches the name Altsitzer on newspaper databases, the results show that the family of Ida's husband, Harry Altsitzer, were certainly strong supporters of the Workmen's Circle and \"the Bund\" -- that is the General Jewish Workers' Union, or the Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Lite, Poyln un Rusland, a Jewish socialist party founded in Russia in 1897.\n\nThis was a labor union that attempted to protect Russian garment factory workers from harsh exploitation and seriously dangerous work conditions. Those New York shirt factories certainly employed several members of the Chernick and Czernichowsky family living in the Bronx, Yonkers, and New York's Lower East Side, according to the 1910 and 1920 U.S. Census records.\n\nThe Czernichowsky family were trained by Count Bobrinsky in Russia as tailors, iron miners, metal workers and blacksmiths. When they moved to America, they were often listed as harness makers and horseshoe makers on U.S. records. They also had a tendency to migrate to mining towns in Pennsylvania and Minnesota. Because some of them used the port of Galveston, they, like the Kovals, landed in Iowa City and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nFINDING AARON's BIRTH FAMILY\n\nAaron Chernjak appears on the 23 December 1913 passenger list for the S.S. Czar with a fellow passenger named Itzke Czerniak and a young lady named Sonja Ostrowsky, who later married Aaron's brother Julius (also on board). This helps one pin down Aaron's family in the 1920 U. S. Census for New York: He is living under his middle name, Harry, in the household of Harry and Lena Cherniak, and there is a brother named Julius on board.\n\nEven if Aaron Harry Czerniak is only the twin brother for Albert Shernick, this still leads us to Albert's true birth parents: Harry Charniak and Lena Gelles.\n\nThey married in New York in 1887. Both of them have family in England, which means that Aaron's missing records may be found in England.\n\nBecause Aaron Harry has exactly the same birthday as Albert Harry (May 20, 1899), we can reasonably deduce that the Harry Cherniak on the 1920 census must be the Harry Chernick named as Albert's father on his 1961 death certificate.\n\nProblem: The wife really is named Lena, not Bluma, and she has a New York death record very different from that of Bluma Szafranski Chernick, who died in 1937. But that is not really a problem, as explained above. Harry is a brother of Ida and a son of Bluma. Bluma is \"Albert's\" grandmother. The Shernick family group photo of 1903 therefore makes sense. Albert is only three or four, and standing next to his grandma, who has her hand placed gently on his shoulder.\n\nAlbert, Aunt Ida and Grandma B. would naturally appear in family photos together. The photos were not faked. When sharing photos with Mildred and his sons, Albert simply left out an honest naming of his relationship to all those present. We are left to deduce their relationships ourselves.\n\nWhy, for example, was Albert named Abram Itzke Czernichow on the 1914 passenger list for the Czar? Who was Itzke?\n\nWe note with interest the Itzke Czerniak who arrived on board the Czar with Aron in December 1913, because Albert arrives seven months later under the name Avraham Itzke Czernichow.\n\nIn Russian, the middle name tends to be a patronymic, that is the middle name Itzke could mean Abraham son of Itzke.\n\nDoes Bluma have a son named Itzke Czerniak? Could Itzke actually be Albert's father?\n\nYup. The Itzke \"Israel' Cherniak who hopped off the S.S. Czar in 1913 shows up on census records and he is exactly the right age to be the young father of Avram (Albert). As a son of Harry, he would be a brother to Ida, whose name is sometimes spelled Itke.\n\nWe find a mysterious Isadore Shernick (not mentioned in Ida's familyl legends) appearing on the Trenton. New Jersey, city directory records, helping Albert's \"sister\" Ida run her jewelry store in Trenton right after the death of Ida Shernick's husband, Harry Altsitzer, in early December 1913.\n\nIn other words, the sudden arrival of Itzke (Israel or Isadore) Czelniak and Aaron Itzke Czernjak on board the S.S. Czar on Christmas Eve 1913 was a direct response to the news of Harry Altsitzer's death in early December.\n\nThey immediately came to Ida's rescue. This is Ida's brother, Itzke \"Isadore\" Gershanowitch Schernick or Czerniak (son of Harry Czerniak) coming to Ida's rescue, and bringing along his son Aaron Itzkowich Schernick or Czernichowsky.\n\nA few months later, when World War I broke out in summer 1914, Aaron Czernjak was sent from Trenton, New Jersey, all the way back to Alexandrovsk, Ukraine to rescue Bluma, his grandma. He probably did not travel entirely alone: Itzke may have been called back to duty in Europe after his visit with Ida's family was complete.\n\nHence the tattoos: They were not entirely sure that Albert aka Avram was going to come back from such a long journey alive, and their family, friends and agents along the way needed some assurance that, if Avram was killed, or called into the Army and not seen for five years, the much-changed lad who returned was him.\n\nThe tattoos were a sort of \"family passport.\" As for his real U.S. passport, it did not have to be doctored or faked, because Aaron was the same person taking the same trip twice. It may have been a nearsighted clerk on board the S.S. Czar who decided his name was Avram Czernichow, non Aaron Czerniak.\n\nAARON'S HOMETOWN: ZBARAZ\n\nAaron Czernjak appears as Avram (Albert) Itzke Czernichow arrivng with Bluma Czernichow on the July passenger list for the Czar. Nowhere on the July 1914 passenger list does it necessarily say that Bluma is Avram's mother. There is no deception involved or intended: If the name spellings on the ships passenger lists differed, that may be nothing more than sloppy translation and sloppy transcription at work by the ship bursars.\n\nThere is also no proof of deception on the 1917 World War I draft card, which names Abram's mother as Lena. Aron is the son of Lena, and possibly the grandson of Bluma. The deception only begins later, in 1926, when Abram wants to marry Mildred Shernick, and to erase his earlier family record.\n\nAlbert always said that he was born in New York and taken back to Ukraine as a child. Under his identity as Aaron Czerniak, this is true. When we look at the earliest American records for Aaron we find him living with his family on Long Island in 1900, He then went back to Ukraine, probably in 1904 when his grandfather became ill, and returned to New York in 1908. The passenger list says he came from Zbaraz, Austria (today part of Ukraine).\n\nLook at Zbaraz on Google maps and it has a suburb called Czernichow, apparently named after the family of Albert or Aaron. They were the wealthy Jewish owners of a local sugar refinery that extracted sugar from sugar beets.\n\nZbaraz lists among its notable people a rabbi named \"Zev Wolf of Zbaraz.\" Albert's grandmother Bluma Savransky was a daughter of Rabbi Zev Wolf Savransky of Tarascha, Ukraine, a small settlement near Kiev. Bluma probably went home to her family when she gave birth to Albert, which is why he was born at Vyshgorod, Kiev.\n\nGrandfather Zev Wolf Savransky's name implies some descent from Zev Wolf of Zbaraz, Ukraine. Wikipedia tells us that Zev Wolf of Zbarazh, who died 1822, was the third son of Yechiel Michel of Zlotoshov (1725 - 1781).\n\nPut it all together and it seems that Albert's family were proud disciples and descendants of Yechiel Michel of Zlotshov, the \"Maggid of Zlotshov,\" who in turn was a disciple of the well-known Jewish mystic Baal Shem Tov (1698 - 1760) who founded five major Hassidic dynasties.\n\nThis means we know the family's stomping grounds back to about the year 1700. Baal Shem Tov lived near Kamianets in the region of Ternopil, Ukraine, and we do indeed find several immigration records and ships passenger lists showing the Shernick family's connections to the region of Zbaraz and Ternopil, Ukraine.\n\nGesher Galicia provides a nifty website with maps and a list of the well-known families from Zbarazh. You will find the Gesher Galicia Map Room here.\n\nAlbert preserved a group photo of his family (attached). His son, David Shernick, interviewed Albert's foster sister, Ida, and made a typed transcript (attached) of Ida's version of the family history. Ida said simply (and truthfully) that her own father, Abram Hersz \"Harry\" Czernikowski, worked as a merchant and the family of her mother, Bluma (the Savransky family) ran a large jewelry store in downtown Alexandrovsk, Dnieperpetrovsk, Ukraine.\n\nUnder the Soviets, Alexandrovsk was renamed Zaporizhzhia.\n\nIda's testimony asserts that Albert (also known as Avram or Aron) was her brother and she refers to Albert as the youngest son, not the grandson, of Bluma Savransky. However, Bluma's age and the 1920 census listing of Harry and Lena Cherniak as Albert's (Aaron's) parents suggests that Bluma was actually Albert's grandmother, and that Ida was actually his aunt.\n\nThe question is: Does the 1920 U.S. census correctly represent Aaron Cherniak as the son of Harry and Lena Cherniak, and is the Aaron Chernick shown in this census identical to the Albert Shernick of this profile? If they were twins, they must have been born in the same place.\n\nWere they born in Zgierz, Zbaraz, Kiev, Tarascha or Alexandrovsk? Could they perhaps have been born as far afield as Bender, Moldova?\n\nNarrowing the search for birth records would help enormously, and perhaps a review of Ida's family legend is in order. We need to pay close attention to where the family was living in 1899.\n\nSOURCES\n\nShernick, Mark A.

But surname matching suggests he certainly was of Ashkenazic Jewish heritage. His Y-DNA matched to a wide variety of Jewish surnames, which is typical of the Jewish people in Eastern Europe.\n\nMany Jews did not have surnames prior to 1820, when they were required by Russian law to adopt surnames. Consequently, Jewish families who are very definitely related through their Y-DNA may nevertheless have a wide variety of surnames, because entire branches of the same Y-DNA family adopted a wide variety of made-up or invented surnames.\n\nAlbert's Y-DNA map strongly suggests his family originated near Chernigov, Ukraine, and travelled northward into Lithuania and westward into Poland and Prussia.\n\nOn the Spelling of Shernick and Czernichow\n\nThrough the Ukrainian Tchernichovsky family, Albert is quite probably the descendant from an old and ancient dynasty of Polish-Lithuanian nobility, the Counts Czarnkov-Czarnkowski, who are an excellent example of Eastern European Crytpo-Judaism. That is, the Czarnkow-Czarnkowski family outwardly belonged to the Orthodox Church but they also intermarried with Jewish families and they proudly advertise their ancient Jewish heritage on the family shield in the form of a Star of David.\n\nTheir name has been Englished in many ways, and they are closely connected to the noble families of Czarniecki (Poland) and Tchernychov (Russia). Based on spelling alone, it is difficult to distinguish the difference between the census records of the Czarniak, Czarniecki, Czarnikow, Chernikov, Czernichow and Chernyshov or Tchernychov families.\n\nAlbert told his sons that his father was named \"Harry Shernick\" and he referred to his mother as Bluma Shernick. This pronunciation implies a close relationship to the Cherniack or Czarniak family of Mogilev, who also emigrated to New York.\n\nThe use of the Sh- spelling seems to be entirely whimsical. For example, Bluma presented her name as Czernichow on the ship's passenger list of the S.S. Czar, but she is buried at the Mt. Moriah Cemetery (a Jewish cemetery) under the spelling Schernick, and her death certificate is under the name Bluma Chernick. On her gravestone, the name is spelled in Hebrew.\n\nIn her 1955 interview with David Shernick, Al's sister Ida said the name was pronounced Chernitzkoff, which David typed up as Chernikov.\n\nThe problem with the \"Sh\" part of the Shernick name is the original letter in Cyrillic, a Y-shaped letter that is translated \"Sh\" or \"Ch\" or \"Tch\" or even \"Tsch.\" This is why the famous Russian musician Tchaikovsky is sometimes called Chaikovsky, and why the Russian playwright Chekov is sometimes called Tchekhov. There are several ways to translate.\n\nThe problem with the \"ck\" in the name Shernick is the original letter in Cyrillic, which is an X-shape. Imagine trying to pronounce the letter X, and you can see why it is spelled in several different ways as well.\n\nClearly the Shernick family were trying to translate a sound, and they didn't care much about the choice of letters in English, so long as the English spelling approximated the sound of their name. Because they were multi-lingual, speaking in Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Yiddish and German, there really is no official spelling of the family's last name.\n\nThe spelling Tchernichovsky has been adopted here simply to reflect the most popular English spelling of the family's name -- a spelling used often by biographers of the Hebrew poet Saul Tchernichovsky (1873 -1945), who is Albert Shernick's first cousin and one of Harry Shernick or Hersz Czernichowsky's nephews.\n\nWhen one goes through the papers and letters of the poet Saul Tchernichovsky, who was a medical doctor, one finds letterhead that indicates the family sometimes used the English spelling Czernichow.\n\nThat is exactly the spelling used by Albert and Bluma Shernick on the passenger list of the S.S. Czar, and it appears to be the best possible example of the English spelling used by this family ca. 1914.\n\nDenver Post Profile\n\nAnonymous. \"Lakewood Decorator Exposed as Being in reality An Artist\" Denver Post, February 1948, pg. 12.\n\n\"Among the hundreds who patronized Taylor's restaurant, 7000 West Colfax avenue, at the grand opening of this modern eating house last week-end were many who were heard to exclaim with pleasure over the mural paintings in dining room and bar.\n\n\"Who was the artist that did these stunning dancing figures?\" was the query of one fur-coated woman to the manager F. Faughn Shelly. \"They're perfect for their setting.\" Shelly told her. \"They were done by a Lakewood artist.\"\n\nAnd that's the 'who' of this story. A Lakewood man who is a craftsman in the fine arts but earns his livlihood as a painter, decorator and paperhanger.\n\nBack in 1920 this artist was a theatrical decorator in New York City. He worked on scenery and decorating for the Florenz Ziegfeld Follies. He plied his artistic brush for Eddie Cantor's musical comedy \"Jumbo.\"\n\nThis man is a graduate of the School of Fine and Applied Arts in New York City worked with some of the country's finest artists in decorating the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. His work took him to other parts of the country in a 25-year period.\n\nFifteen years ago the artist located in Lakewood and has been here ever since, now operates a painting and decorating service whose compelling slogan is \"The best doesn't cost, it pays.\"\n\nThe artist's name is Al Shernick, who lives at 2130 Bell Court.\n\nAlthough Mr. Shernick also designed the abstract decorations in the new Taylor's restaurant, it is the paintings which excited the most comment.\n\n\"Where did you get the inspiration for the paintings?\" Artist Shernick was asked.\n\n\"Out of my theatrical experience, I suppose,\" he smiled. \"They just sorta took form in my mind while my crew was doing the painting. Seemed like a good idea to have dancing figures in a place as congenial as Taylor's. And Mr. Taylor liked the idea too.\"\n\nSo Mr. Shernick set to work and produced a series of dancing scenes which depict various eras from the stately minuet to the buffoonery of a masquerade ball. The latter appropriately enough adorns a wall alongside the bar.\n\nWhen it is suggested to Mr. Shernick that he had been hiding his light under a bushel by majoring in the painting trade rather than in mural art, he reminded the reporter of the economic uncertainties of picture painting as compared with the constant demand for painting and decorating.\n\nHowever, it may be interesting for his fellow-Lakewoodites to know that the compelling murals in the Denargo market were done by Al Shernick of Lakewood. Other notable examples of his decorative art are the murals in the Brown Palace Ship's tavern, decorations in porte-chochere at Fitzsimmons General hospital, the Senator Lawrence Phipps home and the John Morey residence in Denver.\n\n[END]\n\nFor a nice summary of the the history of Taylor's Supper Club, 7000 W.

His World War I draft registration form, however, says that he was born in Russia.\n\nA formal request for his birth records from the city and county of New York City resulted in a letter indicating his birth record could not be found. A search of the New York, New York Birth Index 1878 - 1909 at Ancestry.com also produces no record of birth in New York City.\n\nIdentification Tattooed on His Arm\n\nAl Shernick's death certificate (based on the 1961 testimony of Mildred Shaw) gives his birth date as 20 May 1899 -- a date that he actually had tattooed on his forearm. A photograph, in his famiy's privately held collection, shows the tattoo clearly.\n\nWhen asked why his birthdate was tatooed on his arm, Al replied that his brothers had given him the tattoo before he left Russia in 1914 -- so they could be sure of his identity after the war.\n\nThey were quite literally concerned that his ship might be sunk by U-boats during his effort to reach America or he might return to them from the Russian war front in a body bag or pine box. They knew from bitter experience that to identify a body requires a tattoo. So they gave him one.\n\nOn his left arm, Albert had the tattoo \"May 20 1899\" and an anchor.\n\nFamily photographs, census records, the tattoo on Albert's forearm (photographed) and ship's passenger list records all support the same birth year: May 20, 1899.\n\nIn addition, his twin brother Aaron's first immigration record, 23 December 1908 on board the S.S. Noordam, indicates that Aaron himself had a tattoo on his right forearm that reads: Nanu V 1869.\n\nNanu is a Hebrew form of the name Nathan'El or Nathaniel. V may stand for Vader or Father in German. 1869 seems to indicate that Aaron is the son of a father named Nathaniel who was born in 1869.\n\nIn their reconstructed family tree, Albert and Aaron do indeed match very nicely with Naftali Hersz (Nathaniel) Cherniack, who is listed in American census records with a birth year of 1869 or 1870.\n\nNathaniel married to Ann Shenk in the year 1899, the year of Albert's birth.\n\nPossible 1899 Polish Birth Record\n\nAbram Mordka Czerniak in the Poland, Jewish Records Indexing-Poland, Births, 1550-1993\n\nName: Abram Mordka Czerniak\n\nBirth Date: 1899\n\nFather's Name: Wolf\n\nFather's Age: 25\n\nMother's Name: Liba Chojnacka\n\nMother's Age: 21\n\nFilm: 530225\n\nLine: 2\n\nSource Information JRI-Poland Shtetl CO-OP Volunteers, comp.

Shaw, and his son, David A. Shernick, indicate that Al was brought up by a fairly typical German-Russian family of the middle class (jewelry shop keepers) from Alexandrovsk, Dnieperpetrovsk, in the district of Ekaterinoslav, Ukraine.\n\nThere was certainly a large Jewish community living in Alexandrovsk ca. 1914. See the following page from JewishGen.org with a map of old Alexandrovsk (today called Zaporozhe): [1]\n\nMildred Shernick's family history notes indicate Albert's father was named Harry Shernick, his mother was named Bluma, and he had three brothers (Jacob, Mark and David) and three sisters (Ida, Lucille and Bertha).\n\nUnfortunately, no official census records of his family cluster have been found in Alexandrovsk.\n\nA thorough search requires better access to distant and hard-to-reach archives and records in Ukraine. To get results, one must also perform searches based on a proper spelling of the family's name in Russian and Ukrainian. In the case of the Schernikow family (which translates its name in many different ways) the problem of overseas research is very difficult.\n\nYIVO Landsmannshaftn Archives in New York\n\nFortunately, as it turns out, one does not have to travel all the way to Ukraine to find out how the family once spelled its name in Russian, Ukrainian, Yiddish or Hebrew.\n\nOne only needs to view the gravestone of Albert's aunt (his adopted mother), Bluma, at the Mt. Moriah Cemetery (see photo attached to Bluma's profile).\n\nBluma's grave and death records were successfully located with the kind assistance of the staff at the YIVO Institute, 15 W. 16th Street, New York, NY. See YIVO's website at this link: https://www.yivo.org/\n\nDeath Records for Bluma Shernick Give Clues\n\nThe death records for Al's mother, Bluma Shernick (also spelled Schernick or Chernick) may be found at the archives of the YIVO Institute in New York City amongst the records of the Alexandrovsk Benevolent Association.\n\nThis association was a \"landsmannschaft\" or mutual aid society that helped fellow-citizens from Alexandrovsk to immigrate to America. The association arranged for passports, passage, employment, insurance and even burial plots in a community graveyard.\n\nThe records at YIVO indicate Bluma died at 433 Central Park West in 1936 and is buried on the grounds of the Alexandrovsk Benevolent Association at the Mt. Moriah cemetery across the river from Central Park.\n\nThe family's first names all sound Germanic, and Alexandrovsk was known to have a large community of German Jews and German Mennonites (the Chortitza or Khortitza Colony) who established important industrial factories during the late 19th century.\n\nAlexandrovsk (Zaporozhe) became a closed city under the Soviets, because its industries were so vital to Soviet war efforts. It was also invaded by the Germans during World War II. Many records were destroyed.\n\nUnfortunately, the records of the Shernick, Schornick or Czernichow family in Alexandrovsk were among those that have vanished.\n\nOnly the records of their American cousins have survived.\n\nFather, Brothers and Sisters Named in Mildred's Notes\n\nWhen we refer to the family history notes (attached) made by Al Shernick's wife, Mildred Belle Shaw, they are very confused and confusing: It is unclear whether the family lived in Kovno (Lithuania), Vienna (Austria), St. Petersburg or Moscow (Russia), Alexandrovsk, Kiev or Odessa (Ukraine), Tiflis (Tbilsi, the capital of Georgia) or all of the above.\n\nHow does one begin to find records? Obviously by making a global search based on names. Despite great confusion surrounding the exact location o"
