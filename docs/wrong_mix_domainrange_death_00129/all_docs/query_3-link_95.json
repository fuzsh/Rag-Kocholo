He was 90-years-old.\n\nClarke was the author of more than 100 books, including 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nHe had battled debilitating post-polio syndrome since the 1960s and sometimes used a wheelchair.\n\nHe moved to Sri Lanka in 1956, lured by his interest in marine diving which he said was as close as he could get to the weightless feeling of space.\n\n\"I'm perfectly operational underwater,\" he once said.\n\nHe was the co-author with Stanley Kubrick of Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey, but he was regarded as far more than a science fiction writer.\n\nHe was credited with the concept of communications satellites in 1945, decades before they became a reality.\n\nGeosynchronous orbits, which keep satellites in a fixed position relative to the ground, are called Clarke orbits.\n\nHe joined American broadcaster Walter Cronkite as commentator on the US Apollo moonshots in the late 1960s, and won worldwide acclaim for his writings on space, science and the future."
