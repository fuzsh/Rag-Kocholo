Edna Manley was the daughter of an English father and a Jamaican mother. After getting married in Jamaica they returned to England, where Edna was born. As a young woman, she took private art classes with the sculptor Maurice Harding and studied at various art institutions in London, for instance St Martin's School of Art. In 1922, Edna and her Jamaican husband Michael Manley moved to Jamaica, where she began a long and successful career as a sculptor, painter and art teacher.

Correction to the last line: Edna was married to Norman Manley. Michael was Edna Manley's son.
