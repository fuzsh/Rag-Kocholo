        "text": "Born in Yorkshire England, Edna Manley’s mother was Jamaican, from the prominent Shearer family. In 1936 she met her cousin Norman Manley who had come to England as a Rhodes scholar to study at Oxford. He was later conscripted and fought in WW1, while Edna studied at St Martin’s School of Art. They married in 1922 and moved to Jamaica where Edna was to pursue her career as a sculptor creating images that reflected Jamaica’s struggle for nationhood. During the 1930’s Edna Manley continued to exhibit in London but increasingly her focus was Jamaica where she exhibited and supported the development of the arts.\n\nEdna Manley’s Negro Aroused (1935) aptly reflects her stylistic and social interests during that era. Hewn intentionally from dark mahogany, its naked black torso supports a head thrust upwards in search of a new dawn. Stylistically, Negro Aroused is linked to William Blake’s romantic imagery of a renovated or resurrected man (Boxer, 1990), but conceptually it wrestles with edenic and primordial thinking closer to the primitivists Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. Yet, in spite of its idealism, Negro Aroused is a constrained and even pained figure. Even without chains, its movement is frustrated by its rooted akimbo posture, suggesting that the black man’s future is not born out of freedom but an irrevocable recognition of place. Norman Manley considering how the black man might triumph over this adversity wrote:\n\n“...There is a tremendous difference between living in a place and belonging to it and feeling that your own life and destiny is irrevocably bound up in the life and destiny of that place. It is that spirit which is the most hopeful thing in Jamaica today. It is that spirit which alone encourages the development of our national consciousness...”\n\nSculptures such as Negro Aroused (1936) became icons for this era and much of the work that she created in the run up to Jamaica’s independence such as Into the Sun (1954), Growth (1958) and I Saw My Land (1960) featuring the same heroic black figure, bear this weight of representing the nation’s vision.\n\nHer message promoted black self-dignity, but never at the expense of personal and autobiographical details. The Moses images from the 1950s suggest how her personal and public life were entwined once her husband Norman Manley became Jamaica’s Chief Minister. Edna Manley’s images of the prophet Moses bear strong resemblance to her husband Norman, while the narrative imagery of works like I Saw My Land (1960) boldly signal his role as deliverer of the nation. The designation ‘Moses’ was an appropriate one in a society that saw itself as being freed from bondage and colonialism and set on a path for Independence. As part of her efforts to support the national development Edna taught art classes and helped to establish the Jamaica School of Art and Crafts (1950) through which she influenced later generations of artists. Her husband became Chief Minister of Jamaica in 1954 and although he lost the national elections in 1961, he was instrumental in leading Jamaica to Independence in 1962. Norman Manley died in 1969, but was succeeded by their son Michael who became Prime Minister in 1972. Edna continued to play an active role in cultural development as a founder member of the National Gallery of Jamaica and as one of the countries foremost artists winning numerous awards and national commissions and sculpting an enormous body of work, right up until her death at age 85.\n\nAlthough his post-graduate training was received from several notable institutions abroad such as the California College of Arts and Crafts and Spellman College, Atlanta, Georgia, Christopher Gonzales can claim an art-historical lineage that references his earliest influences from the Jamaica School of Art. As one of the first students to graduate from the institution, his works reverently acknowledges the symbolism of Edna Manley, and the paintings of his tutor Barrington Watson. Yet, none of these influences overshadow the distinctive aesthetic in Gonzales’ work. His sculptures demonstrate strength of character and motifs that sometimes even sets him at odds with his viewing public.\n\nHis work combines a strong individualism, a deep concern for humanity and nature, abstract symbolism, religion and mythology with a keen perception and an intimate knowledge of his craft. The heightened symbolism of his work borders on the romantic and there is a sense of passion in every work that he creates. In addition, his stylised African references are at once Fang, Baule, Egyptian and Coptic, synthesised by his Jamaican artistic sensibility. These works indicate that the source his fervour is connected to his deepest sense of self and identity as a Caribbean artist. This makes his work enormously appealing to local viewers. They recognize a striving for a personal language that can best represent the region’s multi-cultural heritage.\n\nThe commanding scale and distinctive quality of Gonzales work has meant that he has often been invited to execute public commissions. He has had major commissions from the Government of Jamaica including a copper relief gift for the Cuban people (1977) the Bob Marley Memorial Sculpture, now housed at the National Gallery and Father and Child, presented to the President of Mexico in 1993."
