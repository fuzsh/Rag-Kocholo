        "text": "Michael Manley, who dominated Jamaican politics for a generation and became one of the most eloquent spokesmen for third-world causes, died Thursday night at his home outside Kingston. He was 72 and had long suffered from prostate cancer.\n\nIn a political career that began under British colonial rule in the 1950's and ended only when declining health forced him to step down as Prime Minister in 1992, Mr. Manley championed issues ranging from Caribbean solidarity to the reordering of the global economy.\n\nHe was born to wealth and privilege but made his mark as an advocate for the impoverished and underprivileged, in Jamaica and throughout the developing world.\n\n''Gross maldistribution of the world's wealth and food is no longer a moral offense only,'' Mr. Manley wrote in an article for The New York Times in 1975 that was a typical expression of his political views. ''It now represents the greatest practical threat to peace and to any desirable development of mankind.''\n\nPrime Minister P. J. Patterson, Mr. Manley's protege, described his predecessor as a ''colossal figure,'' and Jamaicans began lining up before dawn yesterday outside the Prime Minister's official residence to offer their condolences.\n\nMichael Norman Manley was born in Kingston on Dec. 10, 1924, into one of the island's most notable families. His father, Norman Washington Manley, was an Oxford-trained lawyer and orator who was to lead Jamaica to independence as Prime Minister from 1955 to 1962. His English-born mother, Edna Swithenbank Manley, was a prominent sculptor.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
