        "text": "…..Ladies and gentlemen—\n\nWhen the Foundation asked me for a title for this address, I replied with insufficient thought, ‘Edna Manley: The Changing Years’. My intention was, and is, to tell you something about Edna Manley and her life in the years 1937 to 1941—pivotal years both for Jamaica and for Norman and therefore for Edna Manley. But a better title would have been ‘The Years of Crisis’; for in that period Edna Manley went through, by my count, five separate crises—though they can hardly have helped being cumulative. They ended by putting a real strain upon her, and her marriage; and by the end of the period she, at least, perceived herself to be less than she had been before it began.\n\nI myself would put that less harshly. I would venture, rather, that by late 1941, and in consequence of the events of the years preceding it, Edna Manley’s long and fretfully ecstatic youth finally came to an end. It ended with one last, defiant effort by her to retain that youth, that way of being in the world – one last, perilous fling of something it would be reductive to call her heart since it involved nothing less than a revolt of her deepest nature—after which, she finally emerged as what we in these parts call ‘a full woman’—with the circumspection, the tragic comprehension, but also the enhanced capacity for tenderness, which we associate with that term, ‘a full woman.’\n\nNow if in company Edna Manley was a bon vivant, and often a ‘spinner of legends’, as her granddaughter Rachel puts it, she was also, first and last, an artist. And so, in the privacy of her diary and its often urgent self-interrogations, she could turn a most merciless light upon herself. What I gloss as circumspection and tragic comprehension, for example—this is how she puts in, in a diary entry at the end of this period, November 1941\n\n“There is something that you find in the stillness that follows complete defeat that will stay with you till your journey’s end. It isn’t exactly a pain, nor is it a sadness; it is as if everything ceases, everything has ended – as if there is no movement in the world, no going on, only a clear-cut silent realization.\n\nIt is the knowledge that comes that failure ends nothing, that life goes on…That a human being doesn’t cease because his values have ceased; he isn’t even any different; except that now he knows everything. Life can’t fool him anymore, and he can’t fool life; and, most of all, never, never again can he fool himself. Always inside him [now] there is a cold, an icily cold, calculation of what is possible…Never again will the dawn bring the same hope, never again will the night drop on the same despair. Always he will be different, with that small nucleus of silence.”\n\nShe’s writing about herself, of course—never mind the masculine pronoun.\n\nSo between 1937 and 1941 Edna Manley endured five separate crises, which she variously survived, triumphed over, was defeated by, or simply outlasted.\n\nThe first—which I will relate at some length for the broader context it provides—derived from her polemical advocacy, until very late in the day, of Hitler and his Third Reich. The second—which is beyond the scope of my address this evening—had to do with her work.\n\nThe third involved her health, and I’ll deal briefly with that subject.\n\nThe fourth—one of the two really big ones—was the castastrophic (from her point of view) way in which her husband’s entry into politics changed both her life and their life together. I’ll have quite a bit to say about this.\n\nAnd the fifth—deriving directly from the fourth, and also a major crisis—was a relationship into which she entered in 1939, a relationship that wound up imperilling her marriage, and from which she emerged very much sadder and wiser—but also older, more competent to deal with life and the real world: a “full woman”. The ‘defeat’ she refers to in her diary, concerns the outcome of this relationship and its effect on her marriage. I’ll also be discussing this fifth and last crisis at some length, though not I’m afraid in the detail that some of you, I imagine, would like—and not in the detail it in fact deserves in any serious biography of Edna Manley.\n\nThese crises had profound consequences for her art. I refer in particular to the extraordinary carvings she essayed in the years immediately following 1941 – carvings that included The Sun Goes Down, New World, Old World, The Generations, Moon, and of course The Horse of the Morning – and carvings that were the cathartic outpouring of both the agonies, and the few and hard-won ecstasies, of those years.\n\nAs I say, she perceived herself diminished by the end of the period—and perhaps she was. Thinking about this, I was tempted to adduce TS Eliot’s famous distinction between ‘the mind that creates and the man that suffers’—or the woman that suffers. But that distinction doesn’t seem to me to hold with Edna Manley. To the contrary, the matter—though not the manner—of her carvings often came with uncommon immediacy out of her life. So we are left with the thought of a diminished woman whose art nonetheless shines brighter than ever before; and I leave you with that conundrum this evening.\n\nNow, as you’ve already realized, we shall be dealing with personal and in fact intimate areas of Edna Manley’s life; so I think I want to proceed under the Roman turtle of an anecdote, one I recently had occasion to relate. In 1969, when Norman Manley died, there was the expected outpouring of eulogies in the press. But they went on so long, and became so hyperbolic, that one day his widow couldn’t take it any more. One morning Edna Manley said to me angrily: ‘Now they’re saying Norman was a saint. Norman was much too good in bed to be a saint!’\n\nI understood her reaction. The temptation to idealize the dead is both strong and insidious. But to succumb to that kind of posthumous airbrushing is to let go in memory of the real, flesh-and-blood man or woman, and therefore of the true tutelary value of that life. I know Edna and Norman Manley are something like icons in the collective memory of this country—so much so that, reviewing the first volume of my biography of Edna Manley many years ago, a woman reviewer, whose name I forget, protested, and I quote, “Mrs Manley—whom Wayne Brown dares to refer to as Edna…”\n\nWell, 20 years ago this month, Edna ceased to belong to us here in the land of the living, and became instead a little winking light in the crown of Jamaican history. So I am not interested in iconography, but in the writer’s opposite task, of bringing her and her husband as far as possible back to life, as a real woman, and a real man, both remarkably gifted, and yet each often desperately embattled; fallible; capable of deception—of himself, and of the other—often falling and getting back up; each suffering many defeats along the way. And yet both of them, in their very different ways, quite magnificent human beings, and together the principals in a lifelong marriage of extraordinary vitality, and the deepest, enduring love.\n\nAll this by way of introduction.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n\nAsk a student of Jamaica history the significance of May 1938 and he will readily respond with some version of the events conveniently ticked off by David Boxer in his 1989 book, Edna Manley, Sculptor – and I quote: ‘1938: Bustamante’s agitation; the riots at Frome; the deaths; the uprisings and strikes; the food lines; the detention of Bustamante, then his release; the marches; the political meetings; the endless nights of discussions; the formation of the People’s National Party…’ End of quote. Twentieth Century Jamaican history pivots on the month of May 1938. Most of this country’s old gods died then; and its new gods were born. And May 1938 was also, of course, the month which effectively ended the lives of Norman, and therefore of Edna Manley, as private citizens and launched them onto the public stage.\n\nOn the other hand, ask a student of European history about the same month and you’ll get a quite different scenario. May 1938 was the month in which Hitler, having already pulled off the bloodless absorption of Austria into the Third Reich, threw the world into crisis by lunging at the Sudeten, the region of Czechoslovakia populated by a quarter-million Czechs of German-Austrian extraction. Hitler’s imminent attack was aborted when his invasion plans leaked out and the Czech government rushed to mobilise its armed forces. But the craven response to Hitler’s threat by the French and British governments – which was basically to start pressuring Czechoslovakia to cede the Sudeten to Germany without a fight – convinced Hitler that those who might oppose him were ‘little worms’, quote unquote, and led four months later to ‘Munich’ – a name which, as you know, has done double duty ever since as shorthand for a policy of appeasement.\n\nThe two crises, in Jamaica and in Europe, may have seemed quite unrelated at the time, but the latter had momentous implications for this country. Hitler’s bloodless victory at Munich entrenched him in power unassailably at home and led him into the miscalculation of invading Poland a year later. England and France declared war on Germany at that point—but Hitler didn’t take them seriously. If the British and French insisted on fighting, he prophesied, ‘The national wealth of Europe will be scattered…and the vigour of every [European] nation will be sapped.’ Likewise, a further eight months on, with France now defeated and occupied, Hitler couldn’t understand Britain’s determination to fight on. ‘Mr Churchill,’ he declared, ‘ought for once to believe me when I prophesy that the British Empire will be destroyed.’\n\nHitler was a genocidal maniac, of course, but these two prophecies proved dead right. The national wealth and vigour of Britain were exhausted by its war with Germany, and its already shaky hold on its Empire was finally destroyed. If Britain at the beginning of the First World War was the world’s sole superpower, by the end of the Second World War, a mere 30 years later, it was effectively a helot of the United States (the real beneficiary of both wars); and all it could wearily manage over the next two decades was the semi-orderly release of its colonies—Jamaica among them.\n\nThat’s the broader connection. Just when the Jamaican labour movement, sprung up in the wake of the Frome riots, was engendering a dawning nationalism here at home, conditions 4,000 miles away in the Mother Country were changing in a way that would not merely accommodate that nationalism but haplessly conspire in it. Thus was Edna Manley’s life here in Jamaica forever changed, by events taking place in Europe.\n\nBut the first of Edna Manley’s own crises in these years also involved her more personally in the Fuhrer and his pomps and works. As I wrote in Volume One of my biography:\n\n“Another cause for Edna’s dejection—while in England in 1937—“arose out of her espousal of the Nazi cause. Such a choice was not unusual at the time. Before Nazism’s imperialist and totalitarian nature was plainly revealed by the war, there were many who, equating it simply with nationalism, considered it a healthy corrective to the demoralization suffered by the German people as a result of their 1918 defeat, and the punitive peace treaty that had then been forced upon them. Edna was defiant and not a little harsh-spoken in her defence of Hitler’s regime.\n\nBut, unlike America, Britain’s intellectual climate by 1937 was pervasively socialist and anti-German; and more than once when the subject arose at social or art gatherings in London, Edna found herself on the defensive and having to hold her position alone. Characteristically, she was scathing.\n\n‘I refuse to judge Nazism,’ she wrote to Norman, in the last week of March 1937, ‘through the fear-ridden eyes of a war-phobia…it’s so basically unfair. And to be candid I am sick to death of the hysterical prejudice one is surrounded by over Hitler. No one can ever see the ultimate good of an apparently temporary evil – good is born out of many things – as a lily grows from a dunghill. The essential thing is that the dunghill shall have life-giving properties for the lily – & if you think I use dunghill as a reproach for Nazism, you’re wrong. I feel that for Germany it is full of life-giving properties, & that, qua Germany, that is all that matters at the moment.’\n\nBack in Jamaica, she would continue to take a battering for defending Nazism. “Honestly, I don’t go anywhere now,” she confided to a friend in late ’37. “I hate all these heated arguments, and more friendships are going west over Leopold than I can bear to think of.’ (Leopold was the king of Belgium, who broke off Belgium’s military alliances with the western powers in 1937, thus strengthening Hitler’s hand.)\n\nSo the consequence of her public advocacy of Hitler was a strong dose of social ostracism—and, for someone who was a natural solitary, Edna Manley loved to be loved.\n\nEven more to the point, of course, she was wrong: Hitler and his Reich were not at all what she thought they were. I suspect that, when this became clear, Edna’s scandalous wrongheadednes would have stung her deeply, and made her distrust the world of politics and matters of State—this, just at the time that her husband was entering that world. In one-and-one situations she had always felt able to trust her intuitions; now she had to know that in the public domain she could easily flounder. Moreover, she had not only been quite wrong; she had been seen to have been quite wrong.\n\nNorman Manley’s side of this correspondence hasn’t survived, but we can be sure that, as an ex-Oxfordian, an empathiser with Fabian Socialism, and one who had fought against Germany in the fields of France himself and had lost his brother to German arms in the Great War, Norman must have been at least quietly appalled by her stance – to the extent, anyway, that he took it seriously. He may well not have, of course – for Norman knew his wife; and he would have known that, in her advocacy of Hitler, Edna was being at least partly contrarian.\n\nMoreover, when writing to him, she often went to pains to draw the poison of her public position, and even at times to poke fun at herself and it. From Holland, in April 1937, for example, she writes Norman that in a Dutch restaurant (and this is a delightful, woman’s letter): quote: “I got a vision of how lovely and seductive and attractive a deep bosom and whopping backside could be. I deepen and stick out accordingly! In fact I feel myself in terms of deep glowing flesh—and I see your eyes brighten. Oh, you may laugh! With Germans I am a Nazi—in Holland I am voluptuous and prosperous and solid….Only four weeks ago I thought a grim Nazi discipline was essential to balance and growth. Of course not! People grow because they have enough to eat…!”\n\nThat certainly sounds like a wife’s olive branch—but of course it was not the end of the story. More than a year later, in the summer of ’38, we find the Manleys’ sons, Douglas and Michael—aged 15 and 13 at the time—pushing back against their mother’s Nazi sympathies.\n\n‘I came back’, Edna wrote Norman wryly—meaning back from Kingston to Arthur’s Seat, the house in the St Anns hills where the Manleys often spent summer vacations—‘to find the family up to the neck in politics. They had read a long article on Czechoslovakia in a magazine…& they had the whole situation at their fingertips…How I smiled to the stars as they lectured me & put me right!’\n\nBut Edna Manley was never one to give up—anything—easily. And so, in September ’38 – with Hitler’s hysterical declaration that either he be ceded the Sudeten or he was going to ‘annihilate’ Czechoslovakia, and with Britain and France disgracefully conspiring to force the Czech Government to give it to him – she wrote to Norman: ‘Germany ought to be allowed the Sudeten territory – it’s no matter to fight about.’\n\nThen, however, confronting the real threat of war, she hesitated. ‘After that,’ she went on, ‘Well, I don’t know. I am a pacifist.’\n\nA year later the Second World War began; and after that of course we hear no more of the Nazi advocate. But now, however, Edna flies to the opposite extreme: to insouciant optimism about the prospects of an Allied victory. In October 1940, she writes to Norman: “Isn’t the war news great?” She can only have been referring to British propaganda that had no basis in the situation on the ground, for the most Britain was managing in these early months of the war were some token night-bombings of German positions in the west.\n\nNine months later she writes Norman: “I know that the war is coming out alright, & not so far away either.”\n\nOnce again, she was claiming an artist’s intuition; and once again she was wrong: the very day she mailed that letter from Arthur’s Seat, Hitler’s armies – three million men, along with thousands of tanks and warplanes – swept into the Soviet Union on a 1,500-mile front, in the greatest invasion the world had ever seen.\n\nIt’s clear that Norman, who had to have understood the threat the apparently invincible Nazi war machine posed to Western civilization—and this is one time that phrase isn’t hyperbole—was irritated, if not offended, by what he saw as his artist-wife’s feckless attitude to the war. By the winter of ’41, we find her protesting: “You may doubt sometimes that the war is real to me. It is very real. So real that I think, with the contemporaneity of the true artist, the holocaust that is within me is merely my expression of it.”\n\nNow this was an important and, I believe, true statement. ‘The holocaust within’ her included her feelings not only about the war but about her work, not only about her work but about her suddenly-weakened marriage, as the artist wife of an absentee husband-turned-campaigning-politician; and not only about these but about the feelings aroused in her by an ardent young suitor, who had arrived in her life at just the wrong time—or the right time, depending on how you look at it—and who was himself by no means an insubstantial young man.\n\nWe may notice in passing the resonance of her word for her feelings—a ‘holocaust’—just when, far away, the nightmare we today call The Holocaust had begun—though no one in the west knew it yet, far less had used that word to describe it.\n\nBut what’s significant here is that when, in this late-41 letter to her husband, Edna Manley writes, “the war is…so real [to me] that I think the holocaust that is within me is merely my expression of it”, she is speaking the truth—speaking truth to power, if you like.\n\nFor she was temperamentally a very different person from her husband. Where Norman was a rationalist, she was a romantic, and a believer above all in her artist’s intuition. Where he, with his noble conscienscious-ness, could seldom be induced to look away from the evidence, however ruinous it might be, she, Edna, was skittish. (In any case, she was a woman(!) The all-deciding War taking place in Europe would have riveted Norman Manley; he would have understood better than most just what was at stake.\n\nBut Edna, too, would have registered the War as a profound and intimate disturbance. The difference is, she registered it as an artist’s antenna stirs in a breeze: intuitively, glancingly yet deeply—and all at once. Unlike her husband, she would have tried to put it away from her, to ‘think positively’, to think cheering thoughts; for, as she liked to tell people, she was a Piscean; and Pisceans—this, I found online—“rarely spend time focusing on the negative.” But her dread would, if anything, have been greater than her husband’s, precisely for being nameless. An intimation of some ultimate calamity had to have been picking at her—I doubt it was entirely a coincidence that she crashed and rolled her car, with the boys in it, less than two weeks before Hitler invaded Poland, though her life by then was in another kind of chaos as well. She had been premonishing that irruption, after all, since the days of those unforgettable sculptures, ‘The Prophet’ and ‘Pocomania’, a pair of carvings that—if you look at them without being guided by their names—will awe you with their potential for violence. It’s hard to imagine that the confusion taking place in her life at this time was not occurring within the matrix of a much larger, existential dread—exactly as she claims, in facy.\n\nIt’s probably a measure of Norman’s own severely exacerbated nerves—because, for, due to a concatenation of causes, he was himself on the edge of nervous collapse at this point—that for once he should have accused his wife, and wrongly, of such a default—of a feckless attitude to the war. For Norman Manley was not an accuser. To the contrary, he was almost always an indefatigable and ardent supporter of his temperamental artist-wife, in all things.\n\nI have gone on about this, because most accounts of the epochal events that took place here in Jamaica between 1938 and, say, 1943, seem to me to pay insufficient attention to the broader spiritual context in which those events were occurring: a context provided by a war that was rocking, and threatening, humanity to its foundations. In considering Edna and Norman’s life at the time, as well as the socio-political upheavals accompanying Jamaica’s fast-growing nationalist movement, it’s important to remember that the Second World War is the elephant in all the rooms.\n\nI turn now briefly to Edna Manley’s health. For much of 1936 she had been afflicted with abdominal pains and recurrent bouts of fever, which among other things had been debilitating of her love life; and in England in May 1937 she was operated on. Both her appendix, which was in the retrocaecal position, and her uterus were found to be ‘in a dreadful mess’, as she reported to Norman, with quote unquote ‘masses of adhesions’, and the surgeon removed both of these. It was a major operation, although with characteristic courage she didn’t tell her husband about it until it was over. Then she cabled him: “All’s well, feel weak, very happy, going to be superwoman.”\n\nIn his biography of Norman Manley, the late Vic Reid read that superwoman reference as a raunchy quip, and I think he was right. In writing to her husband, Edna was apt to describe her recovery from illness, any illness, in terms of the return, not just of her vitality, but a certain kind of vitality. In December 41, for example, she writes to Norman from Nomdmi, their cottage in Mavis Bank, where she’s been on medication for some virus or infection: “I feel so well already – almost completely well. By the time you come – you wait & see.” I think we can all recognise what’s being promised, or threatened, by that “you wait and see”.\n\nThe literature suggests, however, that a young woman’s loss of her reproductive capacity can be a serious psychological jolt, and one with implications for her sense of her sexuality. The surgeon who removed Edna’s uterus left her ovaries in place, which means she didn’t go into premature menopause as a result. (Those tantrums came much later.) But one imagines that her superwoman quip was the bright or Piscean side of a moon that also had a dark side.\n\nFinally, it’s worth noting that on her return to Jamaica she soon went for an extended period of rest and recuperation to Arthur’s Seat. The family had often spent summer vacations there. Only, this time, Edna stayed on Arthur’s Seat to continue convalescing after the boys, Doug and Michael, returned to school; and after Norman, too, returned to Kingston and his law practice. And as it concerns the story of Edna and Norman over the next few years, that’s a little flashing red light. That in September 37, for the first time, Edna stays on at Arthur’s Seat without the family.\n\nI turn now to her major crisis in the years under review: her husband’s entry into politics in the wake of the 1938 island-wide labour unrest. Norman’s decision marked a major turning point in their lives, and there’s been some debate over the years as to whether, at the time, Edna supported or tried to dissuade him from it.\n\nOf course the reality isn’t a simple either/or. There’s no doubt that, initially, and despite having quite serious reservations, once she saw that Norman had made up her mind she threw herself foursquare behind his decision. She had long been worried by his manifest ennui with the law and, prior to 38, had been at a loss to suggest new challenges for him. “If only you could arrange your life,” she wrote him in 1937 from the London nursing home where she was recuperating from her surgery, “so as to have sufficient spare time—and then do something that satisfied you with that spare time. It’s a difficult matter and always worries me…Oh, you’re a hard case, my child, and no mistake; you outgrow everything; and one is at one’s wits’ end to know what to suggest.”\n\nIn his unpublished memoirs Norman Manley tells of the by-now-famous conversation he had with his wife, one crucial night in May 38, under a by now equally legendary oak tree on the grounds of their house, Drumblair; after which he phoned the Governor, and then the Gleaner, to tell them of his plans for intervening in the spreading unrest—after which, quote, “I returned to my wife Edna and announced what had happened, and we sat”—presumably still under the oak tree—“far into the night, both realising that we faced an unforeseeable future.”\n\nThis aside, there’s ample contemporary evidence testifying to Edna’s ardent support of her husband in those seminal early months when the PNP was being born and then established.\n\nIn the uproar of Bustamante’s incarceration, with Norman addressing the striking workers while at the same time trying to get Busta released from jail, his diary records:\n\n“E[dna] comes to the rescue and organises good fund and feeding. Fights like a tiger to get me trusted. Great work and did more to help than all I did.”\n\nA couple months later, she writes him from Arthur’s Seat:\n\nMy faith in your ability to ride this situation & my conviction that however we loathe it you were right in going into it, grows & grows. You are right – we had to do it. You grow & grow in your contact with the idea & its necessary struggles. We suffer a bit from lack of experience – but time will remedy that all too quickly.”\n\nAnd she signs that letter, “Jimmy”. Jimmy was Norman’s nickname for her when they were courting in London 18 years earlier, and from time to time in the years since. [It came from an early 20th Century, English advertising icon for chocolate, an icon called Sunny Jim.] Edna then adds this postscript: “Let’s go back to Jimmy – it gives me such a feeling of warmth!”\n\nThen, however, as so often with Edna, there’s more. Her postscript ended with a sudden turn: “Answer me one sober question: if you die before me – exactly what will happen to me? You wont miss me if I died first – you’d be strong. But me – poor me!”\n\nSo you see, we’re dealing—or rather, Edna’s husband was dealing—with a complicated woman. In one short postscript she begins by trying to draw her preoccupied Norman back into their old intimacy – ‘Let’s go back to Jimmy’ – and ends with an obscure new fear, however tenderly expressed: “If you die, what will happen to me?”\n\nNext – and this now is the late summer of 38 – she feels it necessary to defend her decision to stay on at Arthur’s Seat without him. It may be that Norman had inquired—as we find him doing, quietly but persistently, fairly often in the coming years—when she would be returning to Drumblair, their Kingston home. Or it may be that at Arthur’s Seat she was so enjoying the company of the son of her new housekeeper, the young Jamaican poet George Campbell, who was 22 at the time, that she felt guilty enough to volunteer a different reason for postponing her return to Drumblair.\n\n[Edna’s relationship with Campbell was almost certainly platonic, by the way; at least on her side. On the other hand, a sentence in a letter by Campbell to Edna, written two years later – “I believe in your genius, quite apart from any feeling I might have for you” – suggests that the 24-year-old poet of Jamaica’s young nationalism may have harboured rather stronger sentiments towards his vivacious 40-year-old mentor.]\n\nAt any rate, here is Edna explaining her prolonged absence from Drumblair to Norman, in the late summer of 38:\n\n“Dearest, we miss you, & I especially, more than I can possibly tell you. But I stay up [here] for many reasons, not only work. & you – although you don’t know it – & would, if you did, never admit it – need a certain amount of loneliness & quiet, particularly now; more, even, than a sympathetic listener. You’re in the position of a creative artist just now where solitude may not be very welcome – but it’s very good. Prowl around the path [at Drumblair] & think – in peace & quiet.”\n\nIn other words, his solitude—which she, not he, has declared he needs—is one reason she’s staying put in St Anns.\n\nNow this kind of “spouse’s spin” may make us smile. But underlying it is a new dispensation in the marriage. The fact is that, with their lives changed radically—with Norman not coming home to Drumblair until late at night most nights, with crowds of people arriving at Drumblair all the time, and with Drumblair conversations now oftener than not dealing passionately with economic and socio-political matters—matters and perspectives, Edna was adamant, that were inimical to an artist’s way of seeing—she had begun fleeing the new Drumblair for Arthur’s Seat. Arthur’s Seat had long been a family-vacation house and an ad hoc sculptor’s studio away from home. Now for Edna, it became also a retreat.\n\nSo it was that Edna nee Swithenbank, the daughter of an English Methodist preacher, the fifth of nine children and the loner among them—who as a 14-year-old struck the young Norman Manley as ‘a strange, shy, and highly individualistic person’—found herself thrust, in the middle of her life, onto the public stage of her adopted country: a role that could hardly have been more foreign to her nature.\n\nFor she was first and last, not just an artist, but a certain kind of artist. Although she was a sculptor, and sculptors and painters tend to be the most gregarious practitioners in the arts (as opposed to, say, writers, with their wolfish hearts; or composers, vertiginously walking the tightrope of cosmic intimations above the abyss of psychosis), Edna’s imagination was essentially literary. She read mythology and, beginning in 1939, led to it by her new young suitor, who was a poet, she also began reading poetry – and she read them both avidly. A 1938 review described her art at ‘crystallised poetry’, and that certainly seems to me to accurately imply where and how many an Edna Manley sculpture originated—though not of course by what route it was persuaded into form.\n\nMoreover, she was genuinely an animist, she intimated the Spirit of the Universe in mountains and trees, in sunlight and moonlight and the wind; and while such intimations vivified the real world to her, they also led her away from it, towards immaterial apprehensions. Given the matrix of motionlessness in which a work of sculpture sails, it seems almost paradoxical that she should have been a sculptor, for her imagination was full of flickering ephemera and dynamic dreams. She had, genuinely, the Wordsworthian ‘sense sublime/ of something far more deeply interfused…of a motion and a spirit…that rolls through all things’. And she was often at pains to hoist her own ‘inner reality’ over what others called the real world: in 1938 and for the next three years, both her diary and her letters to Norman are liberally and defiantly peppered, with protestations and self-clarifications, of the differences between an artist’s, and a sociologist’s or a politician’s, ways of seeing things.\n\nThis is simplistic and no doubt hagiographic, but when I think of Edna Manley today, 20 years after her death, I see her as repeatedly ‘coming forth’ – the image is from the Song of Solomon, ‘Who is she that cometh forth as the morning rising…’ – coming forth from the mists of Unbeing, or at least of Elsewhere-Being, which was her default residence, to use a computer term she would have hated. She would come forth from those mists, to this or that human encounter and/ or practical end, and when she was finished with them, whatever they were, she would go back into the mist again. No artist can fear solitude; but I have not met another artist who so persistently craved solitude as Edna Manley did.\n\nIn the second half of her life, Nomdmi, her cottage in Mavis Bank, was both literally and metaphorically that ‘place in the mist’; and what it meant to her may be gleaned from the fact that, while she often retreated to it to draw or sculpt, or on weekends with her family, when towards the end of his life Norman Manley decided that he and she would live there together, the news horrified her, and their year at Nomdmi brought her to the very edge of a nervous breakdown.\n\nAnd this was the woman who in 1938 was forced to face the realization that she was now a politician’s wife!\n\nSo by October 1938 we find her telling the Gleaner defiantly, “I have been accused so much of political activities in the past few months that I feel like reminding people that I am still an artist, and that that is my work and occupies all the time and thought I have to spare.” And by then she had new work to prove it: a bronze head of a man, fingers pensive on his chin, which she called “Strike”.\n\nGiven the tumultuous events of the previous months, “Strike” is a curious conception: for what that sculpture depicts is neither upheaval nor militancy, but a moment of quizzical refusal, an inscrutable and meditative pause.\n\nTime and again, in Edna’s letters to Norman over the next three years, we find explanations of why—for reasons variously authentic and spurious—she means to stay in the country a while longer, to not come home yet.\n\nAnd yet she never stopped supporting, encouraging him. As late as late 1940, she is writing to him: “Whatever my own personal difficulties, the only truly bright spot to me just now – in spite of the war – is your own greater personal serenity. Whatever happens, your life is no longer shadows, no longer valueless – no longer sieved sand. It’s a man’s life – a life that can justify its faults.”\n\nIndeed, she very often played an active part herself in support of her husband’s new career—encouraging this party worker, counselling that one, meeting with her husband’s constituents, negotiating with reluctant but desirable potential party members. It would be quite inaccurate to imply that she shut herself away from the untidy hurly-burly of the political life. She never stopped supporting her husband, both practically and more importantly perhaps by her loving, and often intuitively astute, encouragement.\n\nAnd yet these repeated periods of physical separation, with Norman politically embroiled in Kingston or across the country, and Edna away, carving—or not carving—amid the windy pastoral vistas of Arthur’s Seat—now became part of the texture of their marriage. Given the vitality of their love, one might be tempted to scant the thought that such regular separations might be putting their marriage at risk, in some way. But—as the astrological profile I quoted earlier also warns—‘Beware the Piscean who has not yet learned to unify his or her spiritual and physical worlds.’\n\nShe was 38, on the dreaded cusp of 40; she had recently endured a surgical blow to her idea of her womanhood; now she feared she was losing her husband, to Jamaica, at least in the literal sense of being deprived of his company; in moments of weakness, she wasn’t above reaching self-pitying construing her flights to Arthur’s Seat, and later Nomdmi, as being ‘driven’ out of her home. And human nature is human nature. So of course those habitual separations were putting the marriage at risk. Of course they were.\n\nMichael Garfield Smith was 17 when he first met Edna Manley, who was 38 at the time: it’s easy if you remember that she was the same age as the century. It’s not clear how they met. It might have been through Edna’s son Michael, who was at JC with Smith; except that Smith was three years older than the 14-year-old, a big difference at that age. During the weeks of labour unrest Smith’s father, the barrister JAG Smith, had fought hard to establish his influence with the incarcerated Busta and to try to stop him from meeting with his cousin Norman—in his diary at the time, Norman referred to JAG Smith as “that dog”—and it may be that Smith’s teenage son—who is reputed to have been thoroughly ashamed of, and in fact turned into a rebel by his father’s reactionary politics—had met Norman and Edna in the midst of those event-packed weeks. Certainly by May 1939 the 18-year-old poet knew his 22-year-old fellow-farer in poetry, George Campbell—though whether the young men met at Arthur’s Seat courtesy of Edna, or whether otherwise, is not known.\n\nIn the very large trove of personal papers she selflessly made available to me in the early 70s when I was writing the first volume of her biography, and in the papers she left behind at her death, there’s a curious absence of letters to her from MG Smith—curious, because Edna was an inveterate hoarder of letters, like many who suffer from some degree of ‘ontological insecurity’, as she did. (That term, out of psychology, describes the suspicion that perhaps you don’t really exist. Collecting and keeping every letter ever written to you is like one way of reassuring yourself that you do.) But there is only one letter to Edna from MG Smith, written when he was 18. It reads like a first letter—it begins “Dear Mrs Manley”—and I imagine that when she came to destroy his letters she couldn’t bring herself to destroy that one.\n\n“Dear Mrs Manley.” The 17-year-old’s letter goes on in part:\n\n“There is nothing to say except that I sent George [that would be George Campbell, Smith’s elder by five years] my scrippage [I assume Smith means his poems] and have read “Absalom, Absalom!” May I keep it awhile to reread? If you have any time to answer this could you further suggest some books that I could read.\n\n“Lastly, it hasn’t taken me very long to discover I am a failure – about seven months. Praise God for cynicism turned on myself. I don’t know what I am going to do about it.\n\nYours, Smith.”\n\nOne imagines that as an artist herself who often privately stared her sense of her own failure in the face—notwithstanding that there’re many who would think that an unfairly-harsh self-assessment—Edna can hardly have failed to empathise and be move by that last sentiment of Smith’s. It’s also clear of course from the letter that an intellectual and imaginative exchange had begun between them, Edna having lent the young poet her copy of Faulkner’s great 1936 novel.\n\nSmith soon fell deeply in love with her; and it’s clear from very many indices, some quite amusing in hindsight—like the fact that when Smith, having left Jamaica in 1941, returned ten years later with his English wife in tow, Edna refused point blank to see him—it’s clear that she in turn found herself in due course responding to the ardour of a young man less than half her age. There isn’t time this evening—nor is this the occasion—to follow the graph of their deepening relationship or to discuss whether it extended to the physical. But it would be quite inaccurate to dismiss it as a teenager’s infatuation and a 39-year-old woman’s vanity.\n\nFor one thing, Smith—who, as you know, went on to achieve an international reputation as professor of anthropology at California, London and Yale universities—was not an ordinary youngster. By 18, he was an exceptionally talented poet—in a different class altogether, in my humble opinion, to the better-known and older Campbell. By temperament he was as passionate as the tubercular DH Lawrence. And he now fell deeply and once and for all in love with Edna Manley, who was first his mentor, and then more than that; and his doomed love for her was perhaps the defining tragedy of his life. When, fully 45 years after they first met, at a time when Norman had long passed away, and Edna was just three years from the grave herself—and Smith would follow her there a mere six years later, though he was 21 years younger than her—when in 1984, the aged Edna Manley began preparing for publication a collection of the young Smith’s poetry, Smith, then 63 and at the pinnacle of his academic career, insisted on writing Edna’s preface to his poems for her; and this in part is what he wrote—for her to write, so to speak. “I have known Michael Smith since he was a boy of 17 at Jamaica College, and for some reason that I never understood, I received all his poems; whatever he wrote he seemed to send to me….”\n\nI’m sure you appreciate the gallantry of his phrasing, the proud determination to reveal to the world his feelings for her, while at the same time exonerating her from any suspicion that she might have reciprocated them.\n\n“…and for some reason that I never understood, I received all his poems…whatever he wrote he seemed to send to me….”\n\nIn fact, Smith wrote the great bulk of his poems to and for Edna. They are love poems, ecstatic at first, though they go very quickly to being poems of loss, poems of despair—at times, even, poems of near-madness. For the young MG Smith was much too bright of intellect, and much too pure of heart, not to have also respected, admired and loved Norman Manley; and that was the measure of his tragedy.\n\nI know of few poems in the Caribbean canon that, issuing from great pain, approach the dignity and nobility of the following poem by Smith—in which ‘You’ is evidently Norman, and “the moon” is Edna, the poet’s great love, and Norman’s wife:\n\nYou and the moon, you go your way\n\nFor all your lights one mystery\n\nTouching to beauty all you look upon\n\nLoving all things your life makes beautiful\n\nYet unaware that this\n\nSurpassing wonder of the world tonight,\n\nThis birth, this magic where the lost gods sing\n\nIs your reflection\n\nAnd just nothing more.\n\nSince none can tell you, both so rapt and strange,\n\nWhat sacrament your presence flings\n\nOver all things until their senses shake\n\nAnd definition changes to mystery,\n\nThen let me hold this mirror so\n\nThat both of you may see at last and know\n\nYourselves, the heart and source of this\n\nBright world of love, the dream\n\nOf beauty’s kiss.”\n\nSmith was still a teenager when he wrote those lines—much too young, surely, to be able to safely take such pain and transcend it. So it’s understandable that other poems skirt the edge of madness and suicide.\n\nEven from this distance in time, it’s painful to find the young Smith staying with Edna Manley at Nomdmi, her cottage in Mavis Bank—even after she has begun, in the summer of 41, a great fight back to rescue her marriage, to win her husband back to her after, as she wrote him, “I have caused us both endless pain,” making her fight for Norman via a blistering torrent of love letters, letters by turn utterly abject and flamingly ardent—it’s painful to find Smith, then 20, holed up in one of the rooms at Nomdmi, well past page 800 of a long, ambitious novel he’s writing—“an amazing feat,” Edna informs Norman, “full of dread – but dear lord – incredible.”\n\nBut a novel called, heartbreakingly, “The Defeated Judas”; and a novel which, not surprisingly, will never see the light of day.\n\nSmith’s doomed love for a woman old enough to be his mother—and he never knew his mother, who died days after he was born—first inspired and shaped his poetry…and then led, I believe, to his abandonment of poetry. I suspect it also shaped much of the rest of his life as well. I cannot prove this, of course, but I think if Edna had not been married—or had been married to a lesser man than Norman Manley, a man whom a woman might conceivably leave—and even as it was, she came close at one point to leaving Norman for the passionate boy—I suspect MG Smith might himself have been a great man, and not merely have “done great things with his life”—which he did. (For starters, he wrote 24 books. And as you know, in 1972 Smith became, along with Bob Marley, one of the two first recipients of this country’s Order of Merit.)\n\nBut our subject this evening is of course Edna, not her young paramour; and I’m aware that my time is running short. So I’ll summarize this next part as follows:\n\nIn 1939 Edna produces two carvings celebrating heterosexual love: In the Beginning (which adorns your program), and Idyll, the drawing for which Boxer describes as being one of ‘almost Dionysian abandon’. Their appearance in her oeuvre is quite unexpected: they represent a sudden departure, thematically, from the socio-political and nationalistic references of the works preceding them—works like ‘Prayer’ and ‘Tomorrow’. Boxer seems to explain these carvings in terms of something Edna had written to Norman a couple years earlier, that “Now I want to carve quietly for myself and you…[that] would be glorious, like having a baby again.” I rather suspect they owe their sudden appearance, against the grain, so to speak, to the arrival of the young Smith in the artist’s life. (For one thing, in the ecstatic dance of the carving called Idyll, the woman is taller and clearly older than the man—or the boy—though this may admittedly be for reasons of composition.) Idyll, by the way, has unfortunately not survived. It was reportedly destroyed by the hurricane of 1951; the same year, coincidentally, that Smith returned to Jamaica with his English wife and Edna refused to see him.\n\nI don’t think Edna’s attraction to Smith can be separated from her feelings of abandonment in her marriage. I mentioned earlier that on August 18, 1939, she crashed, and by one account rolled her car over, while driving with her sons in St Ann. She broke a hand, but that didn’t stop her from, a week later, composing in her diary a sad little fairy tale of domestic bliss:\n\nIt was a very still corner at the bottom at the common, where the mango tree leant against the stone wall—so still that it seemed to be forgotten. The yellow days past over this corner of the world in a timeless procession and at nights the nearest approach to a visitor was the roll of the old toad’s drum from a neighbouring pond. Then one day two lives met there & the silence was shattered –\n\n–that last sentence is crossed out and rewritten:\n\nThen one day two creatures found it, this quiet little corner, and with a little heartbeat of excitement, they ran from the path to the mango tree and down to the old gate that complained, and they looked at each other and knew, that here they would build a little house’—‘little’ is crossed out—and here they would find a little peace.\n\nAnd then all the rest is crossed out. It reads:\n\nAnd patiently, stone by stone, they built their house, at least the man built the house and the woman made pretty things to go inside. It all happened terribly long ago. Of course they don’t live there…\n\nAround the same time, and much more ominously, Edna commits to her diary a piece she titles, with obscurantist zeal, ‘A Sort of Allegory’. It’s quite long, but it describes a wife, who’s clearly Edna, confronting a husband, who’s quite recognisably Norman, to tell him she’s leaving him, and why. Confusingly—and I assume the intention was to confuse any potential outside reader—in the piece, the husband, not the wife, is called Jimmy. Quote:\n\n“She turned back from the swiftly darkening sky outside into the shadows in the room.\n\n“Don’t you see” she said, “it isn’t companionship that matters, nor friends, nor even lovers.…”\n\nShe paused…Then:\n\n“Jimmy, what is your element, where does the light of your divinity lead you?”\n\nHe sat quite, quite still, staring at her, unanswering, unmoving. Irritably she flicked on the lights trying to see what he refused to state. But it was a good mask that halted her, a passive, patient, immovable face. The world would never know what he felt or he thought. And he – how much did he know of her, of her fire-y, brittle courage, of the strength and colour of her vision? She had tried to get into his element and like a fish out of water she was suffocating, dying, tragically lost.\n\n“Jimmy, you won’t talk to me, you won’t try to explain where and what I don’t understand.”\n\nHe stirred slightly. “You know I love you.” [This now is the husband speaking.] “You know that when you go, the sun goes, the light goes, everything is gone.”\n\n“But when I go you eat, you sleep, you do your work, you enjoy your friends; you don’t seem to be lost.”\n\n“But isn’t it enough that it is so?”\n\n“But when I lose something”, and her head went high, “it changes me, it smashes me Nothing smashes you.”\n\nHis face went dark and full of pain…“I don’t know, I don’t understand.”\n\nAnd so on, into a longish meditation on the wife’s part, for example:\n\n“Jamaica at night, Jamaica in moonlight, Jamaica that could take your heart and your mind, take everything you have and give you back, what? Ought one to expect anything back? Were friends, or lovers, a necessary part of life? Wasn’t it just that within the span of the element you created for yourself, you grew and learnt wisdom and isolation and independence and that those were the qualities Jamaica needed to serve her? The moon after all was alone, the nightingale’s song was understood only by himself…”\n\nSlowly, with her heart pounding in her body, she drew herself to her feet. Could she blot out memory? Could she refuse to come back? Could she resist even the urge to make Jimmy make a gesture? Because of course he wouldn’t; he would be silent. It was his idea of manhood, not to beg, but to achieve even a certain pleasure in his own stoicism.\n\nWith the moonlight in her face and the poetry of the night in her heart it was comparatively easy. Tomorrow she would be lonely…but at least she would have a shot at it.\n\n“Jimmy I’m going, you don’t need me, I’m only a strain, I’m only a – a poem that when you start it, you know it’s going to have an unhappy ending, and if you try to change it you only spoil it. Jimmy!”\n\nHe rose to his feet a little heavily, his hands half-raised, his eyes like a boxer’s watching and yet seeming not to watch. Slowly he moved towards her, with the half-formed words on his lips. Then suddenly he halted and dropped his hands and bowed. In a flash she was gone and he was left alone, very slightly swaying in the empty room.”\n\nAs a writer myself, I like that ‘very slightly swaying’, by the way.\n\nThere’s no way of knowing with certainty whether this piece records an actual confrontation between Edna and Norman, or simply imagines what such a confrontation would be like. I strongly suspect the latter: that she was living such a scene imaginatively, turning it over in her mind, trying to find out if she could actually do it. But even that, of course, would be quite perilous enough.\n\nThe relationship with Smith was doomed, especially after Norman became aware of it; and both she and Smith knew it. There were apparently no shouting matches—all three were civilized people, and moreover remarkable people, each in his or her different way. But there was, as you’d imagine, great pain all around; great pain.\n\nBy November 41, with Smith finally gone from Jamaica, we find Edna writing the passage with which I began: There is something that you find in the stillness that follows complete defeat that will stay with you till your journey’s end.\n\nAnd its companion piece is a letter from Norman to her around the same time; a letter dated November 4, 1941, which reads in part—and you will see it is almost incoherent with pain:\n\n“You will believe that I am trying with every scrap of skill and knowledge and hard understanding I possess to get through. I am not giving in, even in the blackest moments which I feel grow less. I just see the fact that it is a case of psycho-physical ill to be overcome. I see it objectively all the time. I will win. Please keep your confidence in that. Beauty does come sometimes in flashes – I try to hold it in remembrance. Do you so also. One day we will make much – And there is work to do – bigger than either of us.\n\nGod do thus unto me and more also if I fail my job, or be a stumbling block to yours.\n\nYours was my first trust, taken up before my own God of values. Mine, I see too, I must accept, and add to the few trusts which it is death to break.\n\nPlease give me a four-square integrity. Even if it is easier not to. Reality never hurt anyone in the long run; it is the unreal that slays. Let it all be real – or not at all.\n\nI so hope we can find the way to somewhere. Can it be done?”\n\nEdna Manley’s life matters, in the end, because her art matters; and as I suggested earlier, the crises she went through in the period under review had profound consequences for her art. I’ve mentioned in passing two carvings, In the Beginning and Idyll. Much more significantly, I believe the extraordinary carvings she produced in the years immediately following 1941, carvings that even at the time she referred to as ‘The Dying God Series’ – in particular ‘The Sun Goes Down’, ‘New World, Old World’, and ‘The Generations’ – were the immediate and cathartic outpouring of the agonies and ecstasies of her interlinked relationships, over a span of three years, with her husband and her young poet-admirer, with the older man and the younger man whom these sculptures almost obsessively link with each other, in a single composition.\n\nIn fact, I think we can mark the moment of their conception; it comes in a diary entry of July 11, 1941. Not coincidentally, it also marks the moment when, emotionally, she said silently to her young love, and finally meant it: ‘No more.’\n\nThat diary entry reads in part: “Oh but I want to carve my two gods – dark and light. I’d like to carve them where the echoes of the mountains would take up the sound, where the mists and the rain wreathe round, where there is freedom and light and no desire. And the laughter of the fauns falls like jewels on the past. Where there is a beginning and an end, and cool, detached, bodiless creation. I want an icy silence and an icy stillness and an icy loneliness”.\n\nI suspect if there’re any writers or artists here tonight who’ve experienced the calamity of being in love, then they understand exactly how Edna Manley here makes her escape from what has long been an impossible situation. She’s ready to turn Norman into an idea of Norman, and to turn Smith into an idea of Smith. And she means to carve them in the mountains where there is freedom and light and no desire; and listen to the artist’s exultation in that last sentence: I want an icy silence and an icy stillness and an icy loneliness”.\n\nOf course, no artist worthy of the name is ever purely personal, and it’s not hard to see, in the Dying God series, wider references as well—to pre-38 and post-38 Jamaica, as well as to the old order that was even then passing away in Europe.\n\nNow, though, begins her extraordinary fight to win back Norman, which I alluded to earlier—a torrent of love letters, alternately utterly abject and ardent. My time is about up, so you’ll probably have to wait to read them in my book. But I hope you do.\n\nI suggested at the beginning of this address that by the end of ’41 Edna Manley seems to me to have become, finally, what we in these parts call ‘a full woman’, with the circumspection, the tragic comprehension, and that greater capacity for tenderness that we associate with ‘a full woman’.\n\nSuch an access of tenderness, you’ll understand, is usually the product of great suffering. And it unerringly marks the growth of the soul. So in October of 1941, we find Edna writing in her diary:\n\nI have a little pupil, twelve years old, an elementary schoolboy; he only wants to carve, his hammer goes like mine. I went to see him work at about two o’clock and to tell him to go home. He was so intent he didn’t notice me, he went on banging away and the chips flying. I put my hand on his shoulder and I said, “Look here, Ferdinand Escoffery, you have to go home.” His eyes went so dark, and his hands dropped quite still, the afternoon sunshine seemed to freeze for a second, and I felt such a feeling of kinship, it just swept over me from head to foot. I knew his urgency so well. I knew the fatality of stopping—so finally!\n\nHe climbed down and we walked together to the gate.\n\n“Goodbye, Ferdinand – till next Saturday.”\n\n“Yes ma’am, next week I finish he.”\n\nOh Ferdinand, Ferdinand, you’re so little, and your feet are so big and bare, and your eyes, why did they go so dark? And now the sunshine isn’t the same; it looks shabby without you.”\n\nThere’s a note in that, of sweet maternal sorrow, that one doesn’t come across in her writing before this date. Now, maternal is not a word one associates with Edna Manley, as I’m sure her sons and grandchildren could testify. And her tenderness there is of course related to her identification with the little boy, as a fellow-artist interrupted in the expression of his soul by, quote unquote, the world. Still—it seems to me that by the end of ’41—and in consequence of the crises and suffering she’s gone through in the previous years—Edna Manley was capable, for really the first time, of a ‘full woman’s’ grieving tenderness. And that’s the Edna Manley I’d like to leave you with tonight.\n\nThank you."
