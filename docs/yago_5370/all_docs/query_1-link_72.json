        "text": "The residential area of Drumblair in Kingston had settled into a Monday lunchtime hush; it was a holiday, August 7. We were at “Regardless,” the modest former home of National Hero, scholar and legal luminary Norman Washington Manley, and his wife, artist and sculptor Edna, on Washington Drive. As a small, neat sign near the entrance indicates, the building is now The Manley Centre, and home to the Norman Manley Foundation. Edna Manley’s studio is a simple white building, separate from the house, and currently under renovation.\n\nNorman and Edna had “downsized,” selling the greater part of the larger Drumblair Estate and building Regardless on the other side of the Sandy Gully, which runs through that estate, in 1962. By then, having served as Chief Minister for two terms, he called the election to determine who would be Jamaica’s first Prime Minister at Independence. He lost to Sir Alexander Bustamante.\n\nThe free-flowing lunch conversation, on the day after Independence Day – Jamaica 61 – was not about politics, however. It was not hard to avoid talking about our present state of “political tribalism.” This was about our beloved island. At Independence (and during the few days between Emancipation Day on August 1 and August 6) we tend to be fixated on the past, understandably. Then we look at ourselves in the present day, and what do we see? This is where partisan political point-scoring may enter the fray, sadly.\n\nSo, where do we really need to focus? On the future. One of the questions asked at our discussion at Regardless was “Where do we see our country at ‘Jamaica 65’?” And, of course, beyond 65.\n\nOur host was Jamaican-American Karen Y. Johns, a country girl at heart from eastern Jamaica, and also a dynamic connector of people. She is CEO at the non-profit GOOD Institute and she is all about impact. Like our guest speaker, Ainsley Henriques, who chairs the Norman Manley Foundation, she is an eloquent and passionate speaker; so I, as moderator, figured I would have difficulty reining them both in! However, as it turned out, our lunch guests, as well as those listening in on Zoom did not take long to get warmed up with questions and comments. The time flew past.\n\nMr. Ainsley Henriques’ voice is at once gentle and incisive. He relishes a conversation, and he is a good listener. Here are some of his thoughts:\n\nTwo men set the stage for Independence: Marcus Mosiah Garvey and Norman Washington Manley.\n\nGarvey was encouraging us to learn OUR history and Manley worked to prepare the legal structure to manage OURSELVES. And may I add – as a Nation…\n\nMy question is did we follow these guidelines? I will not answer because this conversation today and in these premises, is where we need to share our thoughts and realize what we have done and what we need to do in the future. We cannot do more than correct the past, if that is to be corrected, and also build more guidelines for the future.\n\nI am privileged to speak, if for no other reason than I was born before most of you, and so somehow have had a longer exposure to the successes and failures of the past 60 years.\n\nThe majority of our people have emerged from the period of enslavement from the 1650s to 1838, some 180 plus years and since, in a colonial society for 124 years and now independent for the past 61 years. Have we seen changes? Yes. Have we seen some good changes? Yes. Fast enough? possibly not. Have we improved our lives as humans and are we satisfied?\n\nAinsley Henriques, August 7, 2023\n\nAnd so the conversation began. Of course, there was a lot to “chew on” – in addition to the delicious Jamaican luncheon…\n\nCelebrating Jamaica’s 61st Independence Day: Reflecting on Identity, Unity, and Progress\n\nSt. Andrew, August 10, 2023 — On the occasion of Jamaica’s 61st Independence, a momentous event was held at Regardless (The Manley Centre) in St. Andrew, the former residence of national hero Norman Manley. Under the theme “Who Are We?” as an independent nation, the event held on Monday, brought together notable figures from Jamaica’s cultural, academic, and business spheres to deliberate on the nation’s past, present, and future.\n\nHosted by Caribbean Connector and Chief Executive Officer of the American-based GOOD Institute, Karen Y. Johns, the event took the form of a hybrid luncheon, attended in-person and online by distinguished guests including scholars and business leaders from the Diaspora.\n\nThe discourse revolved around Jamaica’s future aspirations and goals, emphasising the intrinsic value of each individual’s voice and contribution. Participants underscored the importance of acknowledging the collective journey from a history marked by enslavement and colonialism toward achieving national independence.\n\nJamaican-American Businessman, David Mullings, said he sees a lot of “promise” in his birth country, as globally the country’s culture is highly ranked and rated, particularly in our language, sport, and music:\n\n“For me, there is some disappointment, but there is a lot more pride, so I would say 80 percent pride, 20 percent disappointment if I just split those two, and significant pride in what we’ve accomplished…As Jamaicans, anywhere we go in the world, our brand is so big, we actually have it easier than other people…being Jamaican and sounding Jamaican is an advantage globally.”\n\nAddressing the symbiotic relationship between tourism and other sectors of the economy, attendees passionately called for the bridging of gaps between the food industry and tourism underscoring the potential for economic growth and the reduction of food imports.\n\n“You know what my hope is (for Jamaica)? That we will take agriculture really seriously so that we can feed ourselves. The import bill where agriculture is concerned is mind-boggling and if we can’t feed ourselves, we might as well ‘go dead a bush’,” stated Cultural Consultant and Actress, Fae Ellington.\n\nThe participants, in their insightful deliberations, accentuated with utmost emphasis the preeminent significance of education, expounding upon the pivotal roles played by early childhood education, vocational skills training, and the necessary inclusion of Garveyism In Schools as indispensable catalysts for propelling the nation steadfastly along the trajectory of progress.\n\nFormer executive director of the HEART/NSTA Trust, Robert L. Gregory, who was online, chimed in:\n\n“(We should) have the courage to use the education process to first and foremost at the early childhood level affirm the legitimacy of every Jamaican child and the Jamaican language they speak, the core of their Jamaican identity. The orientation to the entire system must be to empower and enable learners. To create value, whatever form that value takes, and by so doing become the very embodiment of value that is the new Jamaican citizen”.\n\nEducator and Blogger, Wayne Campbell, observed:\n\n“The meaning of independence differs based on one’s background. We speak of political independence, however for the masses, economic independence is lacking. The focus now for our political leaders should be one in which access to economic independence is the priority. The teaching of history education continues to be (fragmented) in the education system and this, to a large extent, is responsible for a significant number of young Jamaicans being disconnected from their culture. It’s not rocket science, if we are not aware of our past, then our future will be negatively impacted”.\n\nUnity and collaboration emerged during the luncheon as essential pillars for progress in Jamaica’s socio-economic landscape. The role of young people, innovative political initiatives, and the celebration of Jamaica’s rich cultural diversity were lauded as integral to steering the nation toward positive transformation.\n\nIn a bid to translate discussions into actionable outcomes, Ms. Johns outlined her vision for each participant to articulate specific actions they would undertake if given appropriate resources. This strategy aims to foster accountability and tangible progress, aligning with the event’s overarching objectives to build an improved Jamaica by Independence 65.\n\nThe event concluded on a poignant note, with a poetry reading by Ann-Margaret Lim dedicated to Edna Manley, and a soul-stirring song by Aaron Silk underscoring the urgency for positive change in Jamaica. This touching conclusion resonated deeply, especially within the hallowed walls of Regardless (The Manley Centre), the former home of Norman Manley, affectionately known as the Father of The Nation.\n\nEconomist and Executive Director of the Caribbean Policy Research Institute Dr. Damien King put things firmly in perspective. The problem is, he pointed out, that “we don’t have a common experience.” There are a myriad experiences out there, and there is great inequity.\n\nPerhaps Jamaica needs a “reset,” especially for the young Jamaicans among us. As Aaron Silk (a millennial, I think!) said, what we need is unity. Real unity, not the “airy fairy” stuff. There is much to be said about rebuilding communities (perhaps through technology) with a deeper understanding of the Constitution, civics – and in particular the teachings of Marcus Garvey, another National Hero who stands alongside Manley and Bustamante. Why isn’t his life and philosophy taught in school?\n\nThe discussion will continue. Stay tuned, there is much more to come!\n\nSpecial thanks to hard-working Regardless Coordinator Shelly-Ann Thompson, who gave the guests a tour of the house before the discussion began; Chef Demar for the delicious luncheon; musician Yekengele, who played the piano for us and was warm and welcoming; Bianca Welds, who kept an eye on the “Zoomers”; and especially Karen Johns for kindly hosting the lunch.\n\nAnd thanks to Ainsley – just for being himself."
