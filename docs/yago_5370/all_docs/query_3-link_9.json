        "text": "Michael Norman Manley was born in the suburbs of Kingston, Jamaica, the son of very accomplished parents. His father, Norman Manley, was a brilliant lawyer of international notoriety.\n\nMichael Manley received his secondary education at the prestigious Jamaica College. He was a founding executive of the West Indian Studentsâ Union. He was always in the vanguard of the Unionâs negotiations with the British Colonial Office. He was one of the principal organizerâs of a strike against the living conditions endured by many Caribbean students in London. He was a member of the Caribbean Labour congress. He campaigned against racial discrimination in London and supported the movement for a West Indies federation and political independence for the Anglophone Caribbean.\n\nHe attacked the human-rights record of the Administration. He advocated a deepening of democracy, donned bushjacket suits and mobilized reggae artists to perform his message âPower for the Peopleâ. Manleyâs populism and charisma yielded thirty-seven of the fifty-three seats in the House of Representatives in 1972. He was sworn in two days later as Jamaicaâs fourth Prime Minister.\n\nMichael Manley and his Government embarked on the most profound and wide-ranging program of social and economic reform in Jamaicaâs history. Manley achieved considerable success in international honours and awards, mainly for his contributions towards the struggle against South African apartheid.\n\nHe died in 1997, and was buried in Jamaicaâs National Heroes Park in Kingston. He is survived by his wife Glynne, and five children."
