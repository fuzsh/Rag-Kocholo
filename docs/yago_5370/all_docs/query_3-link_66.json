        "text": "The Most Honourable Michael Manley was one of the most outstanding political figures in the post-colonial history of the Caribbean. As a politician, labour leader, author and intellectual, Mr Manley made a seminal contribution to Jamaican, Caribbean and international politics.\n\nMore on Life Of Service\n\nMichael Manley always remained in communication with the people, in good times and bad. Even when they were hurting from economic hardships in the late 1970s and were on the verge of voting his party out of office, the people knew that he was in their corner.\n\nMore about People's Champion\n\nMichael Norman Manley was born at Nuttall Memorial Hospital in Cross Roads, St Andrew, Jamaica, on December 10, 1924, the son of very accomplished parents.\n\nMore on Early Life\n\nIn the latter half of his career in politics, Michael Manley repeatedly said that the best years of his working life were those he spent in the trade-union movement.\n\nMore on Trade Unionist\n\nMichael Manleyâs first job after graduation from the London School of Economics & Political Science (LSE) was as a broadcast journalist with the External Services of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).\n\nMore on Writer\n\nMichael Manley realised that the Jamaican society and economy could not be made significantly more prosperous, equitable and just without improvement in international political and economic structures that had a decisive impact on Jamaica and other developing countries.\n\nMore on World Statesman\n\nAfter a dazzling career as a Jamaica College (JC) student in a wide range of sports, the elder (Norman) Manley turned to administration and adjudication, again across a broad spectrum of sports.\n\nMore on Sports Connoisseur\n\nLike so much else in his life, Michael Manleyâs relationship with the arts and culture was in his DNA; i.e., it was largely acquired from his parents. His mother, Edna Manley, was an outstanding sculptor and a facilitator and patron of the visual and performing arts.\n\nMore on Lover of the Arts"
