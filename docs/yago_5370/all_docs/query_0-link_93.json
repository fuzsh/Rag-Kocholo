Edna Manley was a Jamaican artist and social activist born in 1900. She studied sculpture in London and moved to Jamaica in 1922 after marrying her cousin Norman Manley. As an artist in Jamaica in the 1920s-1930s, her work reflected British trends but focused on Jamaican subjects. When her husband became leader of the People's National Party in 1938, she promoted Jamaican culture through her art and by editing a literary journal. Active for most of her life as an artist and teacher, Manley's notable works included \"Negro Aroused\" and she received several honors for her contributions to Jamaican art and society before her death in 1987.",
