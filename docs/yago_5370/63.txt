Edna Manley was born Edna Swithenbank in Bournemouth, Hampshire [now Dorset], England [1] on 1 March 1900. From the age of two she lived in Cornwall and attended the West Cornwall College. It was there, in 1914, that she met her cousin Norman Washington Manley (1893â€“1969) whom she married in June 1921.

An excellent horsewoman, during World War One, she worked at the Army Remount Department in Wembley, breaking-in Canadian horses. Following the war she worked in London and in the evenings attended art classes at the Regent Street Polytechnic and at St. Martin's School of Art. She also took private lessons with the sculptor Maurice Harding. Her first efforts in sculpture were clay models of animals, but it was as a carver in wood that she established a reputation.

In 1922 she and her husband emigrated to Jamaica. She remained in Jamaica for the rest of her life but made numerous trips back to England.

She first came to public attention with a life-size figure of 'Eve' (1929), carved in Jamaican hardwood and exhibited at the Goupil Gallery in London in 1930. Later that year, 'Eve' was exhibited at the Garden Sculpture Exhibition arranged by the London Group at Selfridge's, department store in London alongside Epstein's bust of Paul Robson. It was also seen at the Women's International Art Club. An exhibition of her carved wooden sculptures was held at The French Gallery, London in 1937. She also exhibited in group shows at the Society of Women Artists in London from 1924 to 1928; and at the Aberdeen Artists' Society in 1929; with the London Group from 1929 to 1938; and at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh in 1938. Following World War Two she exhibited widely in the USA and Canada. In 1930 she was elected a member of the London Group.

Edna Manley was largely responsible for the foundation of Jamaica School of Art which was eventually absorbed into the Edna Manley College of Visual and Performing Arts. She died in Jamaica on 2 February 1987
