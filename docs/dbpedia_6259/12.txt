The event had 43 competitors from 11 nations, who faced a single jumping course, which was so difficult that no rider went clear. The course was 1,060 metres long, with obstacles up to 1.40 m in height, all to be completed in a time limit at a speed of 400 m/min. The gold went to Swiss rider Alphonse Gemuseus, riding Lucette, with six faults, also finishing the course in the fifth fastest time of 2:24.4, although time was only used as a tie-breaker. Finishing second was the defending Olympic champion Tommaso Lequio di Assaba of Italy, who had 8¾ faults in a relatively slow time of 2:42.0. Both riders would return to the Olympics in 1928 but neither would win a medal. Lequio di Assaba also competed in the three-day event in 1924 and would do so again in 1928. He rode Trebecco in jumping at all three Olympics, one of the first two horses to appear at three Olympic Games, along with Nigra, who also competed from 1920-28 for American riders. The bronze medal was won by Poland’s Adam Królikiewicz on Picador in his only Olympic appearance.
