The concept for these units came about as a result of then Lieutenant Douglas Fairbanks Jr., the Hollywood actor turned naval officer during World War II and having been detached from \"Blue Water\" duty on the high seas and assigned to duty with British Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten and the Combined Operations Commandos in England. The association was formed to honor all former Beach Jumper personnel.",
