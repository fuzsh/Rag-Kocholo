        "text": "Exciting science is at the heart of our Department. However, it is often a long and winding road until novel findings are finally published in recognized peer-reviewed journals. To honor new, innovative, and visibly published discoveries in Biological Sciences and Life Science by members of our faculty, each semester the Department of Biology announces the \"Best Paper Award\". Twice a year, a 3-person jury consisting of members of the faculty selects a maximum of three accepted papers to be honored and rewarded with â‚¬200,-/each. The award ceremony takes place during the final Fachbereichsseminar of the Semester, when the award(s) will be handed over and the awardees will showcase their findings. Ultimately, this award is intended to recognize junior researchers and fellows of our graduate schools, which go the extra mile for publishing their experimental work in respected journals within their fields."
