Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf and\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf\n\n2. Please include additional information regarding the survey or questionnaire used in the study and ensure that you have provided sufficient details that others could replicate the analyses. For instance, if you developed a questionnaire as part of this study and it is not under a copyright more restrictive than CC-BY, please include a copy, in both the original language and English, as Supporting Information.\n\n3. Thank you for including the following funding information in the acknowledgements section of your manuscript; \"We acknowledge support by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and Open Access Publishing Fund of University of Tuebingen.\"\n\nWe note that you have provided funding information that is not currently declared in your Funding Statement. However, funding information should not appear in the Acknowledgments section or other areas of your manuscript. We will only publish funding information present in the Funding Statement section of the online submission form.\n\nPlease remove any funding-related text from the manuscript and let us know how you would like to update your Funding Statement. Currently, your Funding Statement reads as follows:\n\n\"The authors received no specific funding for this work \"\n\n4. Please include your tables as part of your main manuscript and remove the individual files. Please note that supplementary tables (should remain/ be uploaded) as separate \"supporting information\" files\n\nAdditional Editor Comments (if provided):\n\nThank you for your submission, two reviewers have provided comments to improve the work. More description is needed for the questionnaire, particularly methods of validations and how various types of bias that may be present in the work may be controlled. For example, differences in key characteristics between respondents and non-respondents, whether the finishing are skewed due to one or more medical school being over-represented in the respondents and whether consideration was given to the possible impact of social desirability (i.e. respondents proving responses they deemed socially desirable).\n\nAlthough the reviewers noted that Table 1 was missing I have checked the submission and this was included.\n\n[Note: HTML markup is below. Please do not edit.]\n\nReviewers' comments:\n\nReviewer's Responses to Questions\n\nComments to the Author\n\n1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?\n\nThe manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented.\n\nReviewer #1: Yes\n\nReviewer #2: Partly\n\n**********\n\n2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously?\n\nReviewer #1: Yes\n\nReviewer #2: No\n\n**********\n\n3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?\n\nThe PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.\n\nReviewer #1: Yes\n\nReviewer #2: No\n\n**********\n\n4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?\n\nPLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.\n\nReviewer #1: Yes\n\nReviewer #2: Yes\n\n**********\n\n5.

Given that a little over half of those invited (55.1%) responded, subsequent invitations to non-respondents may have increased the response rate.\n\nThank you for this valid point. Unfortunately, it was only one contact but we absolutely agree that in future studies subsequent invitations will be sent to participants to increase response rate.\n\nIt was interesting to note that women constituted some 75% of respondents. Is this representative of the percentages of women in German medical education as a whole?\n\nThank you for your comment. The 75% are not representative of the percentages of women in German medical education. Figures from winter term 18/19 show 62% female medical students. We added a corresponding sentence to the discussion.\n\nSome 10 medical schools had no respondents. Was there any reason for this?\n\nThis is a good question. It was an open invitation with no control over response behaviour. The ap-proach to each medical school was always the same. We can’t give the answer why some places had no participants. Analyses for patterns also showed no results. To clarify, we have added a corresponding sentence in the discussion.\n\nIt is most reasonable that students would \"feel less informed about how it (medical education) would proceed,\" given that most faculties are themselves struggling this this and many attendant issues. The current state of such decision-making would be a useful addition to the discussion, but is not mandatory.\n\nThank you for your valuable comment. We added a sentence to the discussion\n\nRecommendation: publish as presented.\n\nReviewer #2: The authors present an interesting study investigating COVID-19-related stressors and expectations of medical students towards education during the pandemic in a German cohort of 679 medical students.\n\nThe authors conclude that the participating students were aware of the pandemic and its consequences regarding both in the medical and academic context.\n\nHowever, there are several methodological issues, which need to be addressed.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n- All in all, a clear introduction with a comprehensible aim of investigation.\n\nThank you for your appreciation.\n\nMethods:\n\n- Besides the validated parts of your survey (STAI, GAD-7, PHQ-9): how was the questionnaire validated? Is it based on the literature? Was it pilot tested?\n\nThank you for your comment. The construction of the questionnaire was based on existing literature. The items were carefully chosen including expert discussions; however, there was no pilot test as such. We added a clarifying sentence in the methods.\n\n- As this is an online-based, cross-sectional study, did you use the STROBE or CHERRIES checklist?\n\nCHERRIES\n\nWe mainly used the STROBE checklist as we focused on the cross-sectional study design and also had no classical online study as such. We still also considered the CHERRIES checklist where applicable. Additionally, we used a reliable software programme checked by our University (questback) for the assessment rendering many points of the CHERRIES checklist no longer relevant.\n\n- For better understanding, please consider providing your questionnaire as supplementary material.\n\nIn general we are not opposed to providing the questionnaire. However, as it was a German study, the questionnaire is also in German. To be scientifically sound, we would need to do a forward backward translational process with certified translators. As big parts of the questionnaire are official ones (STAI, GAD-7, PHQ-9) anyway, we thought that a mere description in the body of the manuscript was sufficient for the message of the paper. Thus, we restrained from a translation process. However, if this is a requirement for publication, we are more than happy to do so. Please let us know.\n\nResults:\n\n- P8, I160,161: As 372 participants fully completed the questionnaire, how did you deal with the non-responders? If you separately included them in your analysis as well, please consider providing the particular completion rate for each question of the questionnaire.\n\nThank you for your comment. We excluded non-responders and included all questionnaires that were filled in at least 80%. We added a sentence in the method section.\n\n- As you chose for a 7-point Likert scale, why did you break down your results on mean and SD? Please consider providing more detailed results for each particular question.\n\nAs the data of the 7 point Likert scale were normally distributed we decided to present mean and standard deviations as relevant significant values (see also Fahrmeir et al., 2016). Further, we did not provide more detailed results as this would lead to over-presentation of data. As there was no intervention in this study, we did not calculate any effect sizes. Of course, we are happy to present further statistical values. Just let us know which ones you consider relevant.\n\n- Table 1 is noted in the text, but missing in the data.\n\nThank you for this hint, we apologise for this misunderstanding and we uploaded Table 1.\n\nDiscussion & Conclusion:\n\n- P13, I297-299: “It can be hoped that the current wave of digitalisation will not recede but push medical education into a real digital transformation“. Very interesting aspect! However, as some participants of your survey are „worried about the disadvantages of studying online (...)“ (P10, I222), you should consider also taking these critical statements into account.\n\nThank you for your comment. We added this point to the discussion.\n\nFurthermore, are there maybe parts of medical education being (or at least seeming) unsuitable for digitization?\n\nThank you for your comment. We added this point to the discussion.\n\n- P13, I303, 304 (limitations): Regarding your sample size and study set-up, please consider discussing various types of bias and how you dealt with them - e.g. selection bias due to the way you recruited your participants, selection bias due to the fact that interested students are more likely to complete the questionnaire, or social desirability, meaning that participants choose the answer that they assume is favorable. Which methods against bias did you employ?\n\nThank you, we are aware of the selection bias that students who are interested in this topic are more willing to complete this questionnaire. We tried to reduce this risk by contacting all German medical students via Email through the German national student body. However, as the study was on voluntary base we could not completely exclude this risk. We looked for patterns in the participants but could not find any. Further, as the survey was anonymous and the participants had no contact to the investigator we think that the percentages of students acting socially desirable might be very low. However, it is a valid point to talk about biases and so we have added these points to the discussion.\n\nLanguage:\n\n- Overall, the manuscript is well written and comprehensible.\n\nThank you for this appreciative comment.\n\nWe hope that we could satisfyingly address all issues and concerns and that our manuscript in its revised version is now suitable for publication.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us any time\n\nThank you for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnne Herrmann-Werner\n\nAttachment\n\nSubmitted filename: Response letter.docx"
