        "text": "From pioneering women's MMA to blazing a trail in movies, GINA CARANO is one of Hollywood's most unique rising stars. Carano began her training with Muay Thai to competitive MMA, where she competed in Strikeforce and EliteXC. Her popularity led to her being called the \"Face of Women's MMA\" and she was the fastest-rising search on Google and third-most-searched person on Yahoo and ranked 5th on a list of the \"Top 10 Influential Women\" of 2008. In August 2009, Carano fought Cris Cyborg in Strikeforce: Carano vs. Cyborg, the first time two women headlined a major MMA event and at the time was the highest rated fight in Showtime history. Carano compiled a competitive record of 12-1-1 in Muay Thai and a 7-1 in women's MMA.[4]\n\nOutside the ring, Carano served as a mentor to aspiring fighters in the 2007 Oxygen reality series Fight Girls and performed as 'Crush' in the revamped television series American Gladiators before her breakout performance in Steven Soderbergh's film HAYWIRE, holding her own against the likes of Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Channing Tatum, Bill Paxton and Antonio Banderas. Gina's authenticity to making the Action look real earned her performance a Critics Choice Award Nomination for Best Actress in an action film. Hot on the heels came a role in the worldwide hit FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for Universal Pictures opposite Dwayne Johnson furthering her appeal as an Action Star. Next up, she co-starred alongside Robert DeNiro, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Dave Bautista in Lionsgate's film HEIST followed by the role of 'Angel Dust' in the smash hit MARVEL/FOX film DEADPOOL opposite Ryan Reynolds based on the popular comic book. The film grossed over $870 Million dollars at the Box Office. After starring in the independent films DAUGHTER OF THE WOLF opposite Richard Dreyfuss and the dark comedy MADNESS IN THE METHOD with Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, Gina had secured a lead role in Jon Favreau's highly reviewed Star Wars TV show THE MANDALORIAN for Disney +. Gina played 'Cara Dune', a former Rebel Shock Trooper in the series. However, after sharing a controversial post on social media, Gina was fired by Lucas Film and her character was written out of the show.\n\nCarano was born in Dallas, Texas, the daughter of Dana Joy (n√©e Cason) and professional football player Glenn Carano who played for the Dallas Cowboys and was the backup quarterback to Roger Staubach. She has two sisters, one older and one younger.\n\n*Gina became the first recipient of ActionFest's Chuck Norris (Best Female Action Star) Award, given to the female action star of the year.\n\n*Gina received the Artemis Action Warrior Award for her contributions to the female action genre and women's MMA. The award was presented to her by Action legend Zoe Bell\n\nCarl Weathers was born on January 14, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana. A famous and successful football star at San Diego State, he played with the Oakland Raiders and retired from the sport in 1974, in order to give full attention to his goal: to be a real actor.\n\nWeathers first played small parts in two blaxploitation flicks, Friday Foster - Im Netz der Schwarzen Spinne (1975) (in which he played \"Yarbro\") and Bucktown (1975) (playing \"Hambone\"), both made in 1975 and directed by Arthur Marks. However, his big break came the following year when producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff chose him to play \"Apollo Creed\" in the blockbuster \"sleeper\" Rocky (1976) (real-life boxing legend Ken Norton was originally signed for the part, but it eventually went to Weathers). He went on to play \"Creed\" in three other \"Rocky\" movies, and the characters' adversarial relationship eventually evolved into a warm friendship. After Creed's death in Rocky IV - Der Kampf des Jahrhunderts (1985), Weathers met with producer Joel Silver and agreed to play an important supporting role in Predator (1987), an action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThe following year, Silver produced Action Jackson (1988), a first starring role for Weathers, but it performed poorly at the box office and was panned by the critics.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Weathers starred in four In der Hitze der Nacht (1988) two-hour TV specials that were much better received by critics and viewers alike. In 1996, he played the part of \"Chubbs Peterson\" in the blockbuster Adam Sandler comedy Happy Gilmore - Ein Champ zum Verlieben (1996). He returned to his \"action roots\" in two TV-movies with Hulk Hogan: Attack on Devil's Island (1997) and Shadow Warriors II: Hunt for the Death Merchant (1999).\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Weathers is also a member of the Big Brothers Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee, handling the career of athletes of various sports such as gymnastics, wrestling, swimming and judo.\n\nGiancarlo Giuseppe Alessandro Esposito was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, to an Italian carpenter/stagehand father from Naples, Italy, and an African-American opera singer mother from Alabama. His parents, working in Europe at the time of his birth, settled in Manhattan by the time he was 6, and that's where he grew up.\n\nComing from a theatrical background, it was, perhaps, inevitable that young Giancarlo would appear on stage sooner or later, and he did, at age 8, appearing on Broadway as a slave child in \"Maggie Flynn\" in 1966.\n\nMore Broadway work followed through the 1960s and early '70s, followed by some small roles in movies. TV work followed in the 1980s, with increasingly significant parts in a string of high-profile series until he became well-established as a character player both on TV and in a number of movies.\n\nHe came very much to the public's attention playing Agent Mike Giardello in the TV series Homicide (1993) in 1998 and since then has rarely been off our screens.\n\nEmily Rebecca Swallow was born in Washington, DC and grew up in Sterling, VA and Jacksonville, FL.\n\nShe earned a BA in Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Virginia and interned at the State Department, but an acting teacher at UVA noticed her passion and talent for acting and singing and encouraged her to pursue further training. She auditioned for the prestigious NYU Tisch Graduate Acting Program and was accepted into their MFA Program.\n\nOn television, Emily is best known for Supernatural: Zur H√∂lle mit dem B√∂sen (2005), The Mentalist (2008), How to Get Away with Murder (2014), Monday Mornings (2013), and the highly anticipated Disney+ Series The Mandalorian (2019). She can also be heard as the voice of Dracula's ill-fated true love, Lisa Tepes, in the Netflix series Castlevania (2017).\n\nEmily continues to act on stage whenever she can, starring in world premieres of Donald Margulies play The Country House at LA's Geffen Playhouse, opposite Mark Rylance in Louis Jenkins' play Nice Fish at the Guthrie Theatre, in John Patrick Shanley's musical Romantic Poetry at Manhattan Theater Club and in High Fidelity on Broadway. In summer of 2018 she played a lady AND a charlatan opposite Tom Hanks' Falstaff in the Shakespeare Center Los Angeles production of Henry IV Parts 1&2. She was part of the LA Drama Critics' Circle Award-Winning 2016 production of Disgraced at the Mark Taper Forum in LA and she won the Falstaff Award for best Female Performer in 2010 for her performance as Kate in The Taming of the Shrew at the Old Globe in San Diego.\n\nEmily is a gifted singer; she has done her share of musicals and rock concerts. In 2012, Emily and fellow singer/comedienne Jac Huberman created a stage show called Jac N Swallow, which they perform in New York at the Laurie Beechman Theater and Joe's Pub. They would like to do the show again; will someone please babysit Jac's kids?\n\nTaika Waititi, also known as Taika Cohen, hails from the Raukokore region of the East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand, and is the son of Robin (Cohen), a teacher, and Taika Waititi, an artist and farmer.

As an actor, Taika has been critically acclaimed for both his Comedic and Dramatic abilities. In 2000 he was nominated for Best Actor at the Nokia Film Awards for his role in the Sarkies Brother's film \"Scarfies\".\n\nTaika is also an experienced painter and photographer, having exhibited both mediums in Wellington and Berlin, and a fashion designer. He attended the Sundance Writers Lab with \"Choice\", a feature loosely based on \"Two Cars, One Night\".\n\nTaika became a blockbuster director with his film Thor: Tag der Entscheidung (2017), and received critical acclaim, and a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar, for his film Jojo Rabbit (2019).\n\nA tall, wavy-haired US actor with a deep, resonant voice, Clancy Brown has proven himself a versatile performer with first-class contributions to theatre, feature films, television series and even animation.\n\nClarence J. Brown III was born in 1959 in Urbana, Ohio, to Joyce Helen (Eldridge), a concert pianist, conductor, and composer, and Clarence J. \"Bud\" Brown, Jr., who helped manage the Brown Publishing Company, the family-owned newspaper started by Clancy's grandfather, Clarence J. Brown. Clancy's father and grandfather were also Republican congressmen from the same Ohio district, and Clancy spent much of his youth in close proximity to Washington, D.C. He plied his dramatic talents in the Chicago theatre scene before moving onto feature film with a sinister debut performance bullying Sean Penn inside a youth reformatory in Bad Boys - Klein und gef√§hrlich (1983). He portrayed Viktor the Monster in the unusual spin on the classic Frankenstein story in Die Braut (1985), before scoring one of his best roles to date as the evil Kurgan hunting fellow immortals Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery across four centuries of time in Highlander: Es kann nur einen geben (1986).\n\nBrown played a corrupt American soldier in the Walter Hill-directed hyper-violent action film Ausgel√∂scht (1987), another deranged killer in M√∂rderischer Vorsprung (1988) and a brutal prison guard, who eventually somewhat \"befriends\" wrongfully convicted banker Tim Robbins, in the moving Die Verurteilten (1994). His superb vocal talents were in demand, and he contributed voices to animated series, including Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1995), Street Sharks (1994), Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles (1994) and Superman (1996). Brown then landed two more plum roles, one as a \"tough-as-nails\" drill sergeant in the science fiction thriller Starship Troopers (1997), and the other alongside Robin Williams in the Disney comedy Flubber (1997).\n\nThe video gaming industry took notice of Clancy's vocal abilities, too, and he has contributed voices to several top selling video games, including Crash Bandicoot: Der Zorn des Cortex (2001), Lands of Lore III (1999), Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002) and Crash Nitro Kart (2003). His voice is also the character of cranky crustacean Mr. Eugene H.

A popular and friendly personality, Clancy Brown continues to remain busy both through his vocal and acting talents in Hollywood.\n\nRichard Ellef Ayoade was born in Hammersmith, and grew up in Suffolk, in England, the son of a Norwegian mother, Dagny Amalie (Bosvik), and a Nigerian father, Layide Ade Laditi Ayoade. He studied Law at Cambridge university, and followed in the footsteps of British Comedy legends like Monty Python's Eric Idle, Hugh Laurie and Graeme Garden when he became the president of the Cambridge Footlights club.\n\nAyoade's first real TV break was directing, co-writing and starring with Matthew Holness in the cult classic Garth Marenghi's Darkplace (2004) a parody of shlocky 1980's science fiction television shows, and noticed for it's \"so bad it's good!\" aesthetic. Notably shy and self-effacing in interviews, his performance as the debauched, self-assured publisher/pornographer/nightclub owner 'Dean Learner' showcased the young comedian's acting talent.\n\nAfter cameos in another cult series The Mighty Boosh (2003) as the shaman \"Saboo\", his position in the popular consciousness was cemented in the series The IT Crowd (2006) where Ayoade played the social oblivious, dweebish savant known as \"Moss\".\n\nAll the while Ayoade continued to direct music videos for Vampire Weekend, Kasabian, and the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs before finally getting his chance to direct a feature film, Submarine (2010), based on the novel by Joe Dunthorne.\n\nSubmarine was followed by The Double (2013) co-written by Avi Korine and based on a novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky.\n\nHoratio Sanz was born on June 4, 1969, in Santiago, Chile, and raised in Chicago, Illinois.

Feature Aquaman 1 & 2.\n\nKathryn Ann \"Katee\" Sackhoff (born April 8, 1980) is an American actress known for playing Lieutenant Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace on the Sci Fi Channel's television program Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009). She was nominated for four Saturn Awards for her work on Battlestar Galactica and won the award for Best Supporting Actress on Television in 2005.\n\nSackhoff has also starred in the short-lived TV series The Fearing Mind (2000-2001) and The Education of Max Bickford (2001-2002); had recurring roles in the TV series Bionic Woman (2007), Nip/Tuck (2009), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2010-2011), and Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2012-2013); and had a lead role in the eighth season of 24 as Dana Walsh (2010).

Between 2012 and 2017, she starred in the A&E and Netflix series Longmire as Deputy Sheriff Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti before recurring on The Flash as Amunet.\n\nShe had lead roles in the films Halloween: Resurrection (2002); White Noise: The Light (2007); Batman: Year One (2011); The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia, Sexy Evil Genius, Riddick, Oculus (2013) and Don't Knock Twice (2016).\n\nSackhoff was born in Portland, Oregon, and grew up in St. Helens, Oregon. Her mother, Mary, worked as an English-as-second-language (ESL) program coordinator, and her father, Dennis, is a land developer. Her brother, Erick, is co-owner of a vehicle modification shop near Portland. She graduated from Sunset High School in Beaverton in 1998. She began swimming at an early age and by high school, was planning to pursue a career in the sport until her right knee was injured. This led her to begin practicing yoga-which she continues today-and to pursue an interest in acting.\n\nHer first acting role was in the Lifetime movie Fifteen and Pregnant in which she played a teenager with a baby. The movie starred Kirsten Dunst and motivated her to move to Hollywood and pursue a career in acting after graduating high school. Sackhoff's first recurring role was Annie in MTV's Undressed, next gaining a supporting role as Nell Bickford in The Education of Max Bickford. Sackhoff made her motion picture debut in My First Mister, and next appeared in film as Jenna \"Jen\" Danzig in Halloween: Resurrection.\n\nIn August 2012, Sackhoff became the co-host of the Schmoes Know Movies podcast on the Toad Hop Network. One of her first shows was with guest Sean Astin.\n\nSackhoff announced in April 2015 a new TV-series project, Rain, which she wrote and is executive-producing through her Fly Free Productions. She also had a role in the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops III, performing voice over and motion capture as Sarah Hall. She portrayed Pink Ranger Kimberly in Power/Rangers, a short depicting a dystopian future in the Power Rangers universe.\n\nIn 2017, Sackhoff joined The CW series The Flash in the recurring role of villainess Amunet (Blacksmith), for which she is billed as a special guest star.\n\nFrom Timothy Olyphant's first screen appearances, such as his two-minute bit in Der Club der Teufelinnen (1996), to \"Nicko\", whose presence at times dwarfed the island in A Perfect Getaway (2009), he has been a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBorn in Hawaii, Timothy David Olyphant was raised in Modesto, California. He is the son of Katherine Lyon (Gideon) and John Vernon Bevan Olyphant, a college teacher who was also an executive at E & J Gallo Winery. He has an older brother, Andy, who is in A&R for Warner Bros. Records, and a younger brother, Matt Olyphant, who was the lead singer for the punk rock group, Fetish, and is also an artist. He is a descendant of the prominent Vanderbilt and Olyphant families of businesspeople, and his ancestry includes Russian Jewish (from a maternal great-grandfather), English, German, Scottish, Dutch, and Irish. Timothy quickly became Modesto's favorite son, competing as a pro swimmer and excelling at drawing. It was, by chance, that he enrolled in an acting course as an elective and decided to pursue an acting career. He took his family and headed to New York City, where he studied the craft and began auditioning for roles. From the beginning, he tried to choose diversified roles and take chances with every genre and always approached everything he did with commitment, humor and grace. Timothy is married to his college sweetheart, Alexis Knief, and, together, they raise three children, one son and two daughters in California. He has managed to keep his personal life out of the tabloids. He obviously has his priorities straight, as this is no easy task in Hollywood.\n\nHighlights of Olyphant's career include his riveting portrayal of \"Sheriff Seth Bullock\" in HBO's hit drama, Deadwood (2004). He now personifies intensity as complex Kentucky Marshal, \"Raylan Givens\", in FX's Justified (2010). On the big screen, in 2010's The Crazies - F√ºrchte deinen N√§chsten (2010), he had the chance to infuse his character with doubts, fears and humaneness in an inhumane situation. Mr. Olyphant proved he could carry a major movie on his talent, alone. He recently appeared in Ich bin Nummer Vier (2011), a sci-if thriller, in which Tim provided the adult mentorship, taking a back seat to the teen cast."
