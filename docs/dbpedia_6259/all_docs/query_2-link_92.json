        "meta_description": "Werner Scott Vaitl, beloved husband, son, and brother, was taken away in his home on Saturday, March 20, 2010, at the young age of  47.  His death was unexpected of natural causes.  He was born in Ephrata, a son of Rudolf Vaitl and the late Edith E. Schultz Vaitl, and Florence Stuber Vaitl, stepmother.  He and his wife, Toni Herr, who survives, were married at the Outer Banks on July 1, 1998.  Werner was a 1980 Ephrata High School graduate and served in the U. S. Air Force.  He was a self employed contractor whose work was respected and sought  after.    Werner lived his life to the fullest.          Surviving in addition to his wife and parents, is his twin sister, Vera Fritz (David, deceased), sister, Angelika Tegan (Robert), brother, Karl Vaitl (Julia), godmother, Elizabeth Vaitl Withers (Eric), aunts Otti McDermott-Weaver (David),  Maria Weaver (William, deceased), and Jane Vaitl (Hans Vaitl, deceased).    He will be greatly missed by friends and family.  There will be no viewing.  In celebration of Werner's life, we invite family and friends to a graveside service  at Cedar Hill Cemetery, 351 N. State St., Ephrata, on Friday, March 26 at 11 AM with Rev. Henry E. Herbener Jr. officiating.    Arrangements by Stradling Funeral Homes, Akron/Ephrata.",
