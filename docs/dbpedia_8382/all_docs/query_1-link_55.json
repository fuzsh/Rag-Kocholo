He started, while studying undergraduate and graduate studies at the HebrewUniversity in Jerusalem, with several seminar papers dealing with the emancipation period (18th and 19th centuries); those papers were published as articles in the series Studies on the History of Dutch Jewry (Hebrew) in the 1970s. His Ph.D.-thesis on the Jewish Refugees from Germany in the Netherlands since the rise to power on the Nazi party in Germany through the occupation of Holland (1933-1940), for which he stayed four years in the Netherlands, made him move to 20th century Jewish history. From this point onwards two lines of research developed: the history of Dutch Jewry in the modern period (19th and 20th centuries), and the Holocaust.\n\nAs for the first field, most of his work has been dedicated to the Holocaust period, the decades preceding it, and to some of its results. Among other issues he studied the attitudes of Dutch society to the Jews during the 1930s and the 1940s. Most notable are the following publications: (1) Pinkas Hakehillot: Holland (in Dutch: Pinkas), a volume written jointly with his father (and with the aid of Mr. H. Beem, an expert on Dutch Yiddish and Jewish life in the countryside). In this book he wrote the entries on all the Jewish communities outside Amsterdam (consisting two-thirds of the book). This book, especially in its updated Dutch version, has been recognized as the authoritative study on Dutch Jewry; since its publication it is constantly quoted in numerous studies, and since 1995 it is also used as a textbook for cultural studies at Dutch high schools. As such, the first edition (of 2700 copies) was sold out, and was reprinted (with some updating) in 1999 (3000 copies). (2) His book Het Liberale Jodendom in Nederland 1929-1943 (Liberal Jewry in the Netherlands 1929-1943) in Dutch, and his articles on Dutch Liberal Jewry in Hebrew and English gave for the first time a description and proper analysis of the history and special character of Liberal Jewry in the Netherlands. These studies contributed both to the history of Dutch Jewry and the history of the Reform movement. (3) He published a Nazi Sicherheitsdienst report on Dutch Jewry from 1939 – 14 months before occupation - which contradicts all that has been written about the Holocaust in Holland, as if policies (including the assembling of information) concerning the Jews started only after the occupation. This is not so much a surprise for those who are closely acquainted with the history and character of the SD as such, but has never been looked for by researchers dealing with Holland; as such, it has already been welcomed in Dutch research as an important eye-opener. However, as the scope of his overall activities broadened, the part dedicated to the Netherlands has become limited.\n\nUpon joining the Department of Jewish History at Bar-Ilan University in 1976, Prof. Michman was missioned with the task to teach and research the Holocaust, a then emerging academic field. With the background of his Ph.D.-thesis he first focused on emigration, refugees and rescue issues. From the beginning of the 1980s he started to develop the scientific study of the delicate issue of religious life under Nazi domination, which had hitherto been dealt with in an amateurish and apologetic manner (and while focusing on post-Holocaust faith problems). He has researched this issue ever since, both from the aspect of Nazi policies as from that of daily Jewish life in the communities, the ghettos and the camps. These studies benefited from and contributed to the emerging field of Alltagsgeschichte in the Third Reich. In 1986 he organized an international conference on this topic at Bar-IlanUniversity. Consequently, it can be stated that historical research of religious Jewry during the Nazi period has been an original contribution on my part. Through his studies he could refute and disprove several “axioms” in the field (for instance he has showed that no planned policies on religious issues ever existed, and that the Nazi policy-makers even had no real understanding of Jewish religious life, only acquaintance with some traditional antisemitic perceptions of it).\n\nHis task at Bar-IlanUniversity, as well as the invitation at the end of 1978 by the Open University of Israel to write a comprehensive course on the Holocaust, challenged him with the need to develop systematic approaches to major issues and a comprehensive view of the Holocaust.[1]Additionally he became interested in theoretical issues of historical thinking. The combination of the two made him develop - as from 1979 onwards - a unique approach which did not exist in Holocaust research and almost does not exist in other historical fields: the analysis of historical views, schools and debates through the angle of definitions, conceptualization and terminology. His findings were published over the years in a series of articles; those were republished in Hebrew in the volume Hashoa Vehikra: Hamsaga, Minuah ve-Sugyot Yesod (The Holocaust and Holocaust Research: Conceptualization, Terminology and Basic Issues, 1998). This book has drawn a lot of attention by scholars, high school teachers and interested lay people. The first print (1000 copies) was sold out within a year, and a second print was released in 2000. The book was translated into French (2001), German (2002), English (UK, 2003), Russian (2005), and Hungarian (2008). The example set by these studies has prompted other scholars, some of them PhD students of professor Michman, to explore the field of Holocaust historiography also in other directions. On his initiative, Yad Vashem held a most successful international conference on “Holocaust Historiography in Context” in November 2004; the proceedings of this volume, containing some 30 articles (and edited by him and Prof. David Bankier), were published by Yad Vashem in 2008.\n\nThe Open University course itself played a major role in academic Holocaust teaching. Being used as a textbook not only at the Open University but also at other universities and high schools in Israel, it was instrumental in intriducing many new research approaches unknown among Israeli students into the curriculum; for instance, this was the first book in Israel to integrate some “functionalist” insights into the picture of Nazi anti-Jewish policies. The translations of this course into Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian, widely served the scholarly communities in these languages; in Russian and Ukrainian this is until today the only comprehensive introductory book into Holocaust studies, and therefore widely used at both universities and Jewish educational frameworks.\n\nThree main other issues were accentuated in his research: The Holocaust in Belgium, the Judenräte and the ghetto phenomenon. In the beginning of the 1980s Prof. Michman was requested by Yad Vashem to write the volume on Belgium in the Comprehensive History of the Holocaust series. After a short period of investigation it became clear, that basic research on most essential issues was lacking, and that the task could not immediately be carried out. Consequently, he initiated a conference on this issue, which took place at Bar-IlanUniversity in 1989. It was organized in cooperation with the BrusselsCenter for Research and studies on World War II. The proceedings, carefully screened, edited and updated by him, have been published by Yad Vashem (1998). It is the only comprehensive publication on the Holocaust in Belgium outside the French language, and covers a much broader scope than the only comprehensive volume hitherto published in French (by Maxime Steinberg). As such, this is a unique contribution to Holocaust research in Belgium and in general as well. The book, which is constantly quoted in Belgian Holocaust research which matured only in the second half of the 1990s, was reprinted in 2000 and in 2007. As part of his activities as Chief Historian of Yad Vashem, Prof. Michman also edited the volume on Belgium within the Encyclopedia of the Righteous Among the Nations series, writing an extensive introduction to it; this introduction sets rescue efforts in Belgium in the broader contexts of the Holocaust in Belgium and of the Holocaust in general.\n\nWhen having to prepare the Open University course in the 1980s, and because of his special interest in both Holland and Belgium, he became aware of the fact that the issue of the Jewish Councils has never been dealt with in a comprehensive manner. He started to develop a new view as to the origins and patterns of emergence and application of the concept of the Judenräte. His overall view and some of his findings have been published in a series of articles in several periodicals and books (in Dutch, English, French, Hebrew, Hungarian, Russian and German) since the beginning of the 1990s, and have aroused many reactions in scholarly literature. He has developed his view into a comprehensive study, which will encompass the whole period 1933-1945, and the whole territory under Nazi domination and influence (Europe and North Africa). This study will be published by Yad Vashem in Hebrew, and in German by a German publisher. As a by-product of this study, he has also proposed (2004) an explanation why Reinhard Heydrich’s Schnellbrief of September 21, 1939 – one of the most well-k"
