The Mother of David S., originally published as De moeder van David S., was adapted for television and as a full-length play.\n\nBased on Keuls's work with drug addicts, The Mother of David S. presents the story of a Dutch family torn apart by the drug abuse of their teenage son, David. Lena, his mother, becomes so obsessed with helping David battle his additions that she neglects her other children. Finally, Lena travels to the United States and joins a self-help group for parents with drug-addicted kids. This experience gives her the insight and courage to force David to take responsibility for his own life. The book, which Psychology Today reviewer Ruth J. Moss deemed \"a searing account of the dependency, manipulation and confusion that … drug addiction breeds\" and a \"stirring portrait of one family ripped apart by drugs,\" has been translated into English, Spanish, Czech, and Ukrainian.\n\nIn addition to her plays, Keuls has also written biographies. Indische tantes is a collection of interviews with women immigrants in the Netherlands.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nPsychology Today, February, 1987, Ruth J. Moss, review of The Mother of David S., p. 78.\n\nPublishers Weekly, May 16, 1986, review of The Mother of David S., p. 70.\n\nONLINE"
