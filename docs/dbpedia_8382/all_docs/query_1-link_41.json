        "text": "Get ready for an exclusive look behind the scenes! 👀 Our content designers are currently deeply immersed in user testing for upcoming exhibitions. At Museum Sint-Janshospitaal Musea Brugge, we’re user testing and paper prototyping the immersive installation about Memling. 🎨 On the attic of the Sint-Janshospitaal public can digitally experiment with Memling’s masterpieces who are on show at the exhibition downstairs. Over at Stichting Grote Kerk Alkmaar, we’re fine-tuning an interactive tour. Using tablets, visitors discover the church’s hidden treasures. ✨ Through testing, we’re enhancing the visitor experience & interaction, ensuring it’s intuitive and perfectly timed. Meanwhile, at Nationaal Monument Oranjehotel we are developing an educative program, where pupils learn how vulnerable freedom can be if the Dutch constitutional state comes under threat. Currently, we’re testing lightning, sound and timing in every cell, preparing to make history tangible for students. 👉 Stay tuned for more updates!

We’re proud to announce its tremendous success, having drawn nearly 27.000 visitors over a period of three months (source: Het Laatste Nieuws). The exhibition featured a series of 15th-century coats of arms belonging to the Knights of the Golden Fleece, who gathered in the Saint Rumbold’s Cathedral in 1491 for one of Mechelen’s biggest and most significant historical events. We developed a concept around the idea of the Burgundian state as a ‘theatre state’, which ultimately resulted in a dramatic light and sound installation. The voice of Bart van Loo, historian and author of the celebrated book #TheBurgundians, brought the circumstance to life in vivid detail.

At this event, which also featured esteemed attendees such as Barker Langham, V&A Museum, and John Falk, Barend and Juliette had the honor of conducting two insightful workshops. 🎓 Workshop 1: Emotion Learning in Education Methodology 🎓 Our first workshop focused on our innovative education methodology, Emotion Learning. We highlighted how museums can develop educational programs that not only impart knowledge but also foster skills, mentality, and behavior in children. 💡 Workshop 2: Innovative Storytelling through Emotion Design💡 The second workshop showcased our Emotion Design methodology, demonstrating how we craft compelling narratives that engage and inspire. Additionally, we were proud to present our #VR project on the Al Masmak Fortress, developed in collaboration with SNGULAR, during the conference. Thank you to #ICEIM for this incredible opportunity to share our passion for education and innovation in museums. We look forward to many more collaborative ventures and continuing to push the boundaries of museum education! #studiolouter #storytelling #touchedbystudiolouter\n\nLearn and play at the same time: We’re excited to announce that ‘The Nassaus of Breda’ has won a Siegel in the Comenius Edumedia Awards for ‘game-based digital educational media’! At the permanent exhibition in Stedelijk Museum Breda, visitors explore the rich history of the Nassau family through our engaging and playful family trail. Through interactive games they experience what it was like to live, work and fight in the past. Children can follow the playful stamp trail, assembling a group portrait of local figures who all left their mark on Nassau history. At each stop, they hear, do, or experience the Nassau story and collect 13 cheerful stamps (illustrated by Jose Luis Garcia Lechner). Another highlight is a game about table manners, inspired by Erasmus’ etiquette, where children get to choose whether statements like ‘It’s acceptable to laugh loudly during dinner’ are true or false.

But how to highlight the personal stories, showing them as individuals and not merely as victims? The ‘glass teardrops’ commemorate the lives of more Holocaust victims and restore their humanity. Each teardrop tells the story of someone who was imprisoned at the Hollandsche Schouwburg deportation site. By holding an audio device up to the drops, visitors can listen to the victims’ eyewitness accounts. One of the drops contains the story of Salo Muller. Along with his parents, he was transported to the Hollandsche Schouwburg. Here he was torn from his parents and taken to the Jewish kindergarten across the street. It was a traumatic experience for him, leaving him completely distressed for four days. Eventually Salo Muller was smuggled away through the teacher training college next door, to go into hiding. Tragically, the now 87-year-old Salo never beheld his parents again. “The more you contemplate about it, the more beautiful, the more emotional it becomes. A single droplet falls and disappears. Yet this one, fortunately, endures.” – Salo Muller for AT5, 5 February 2024 Read more: https://lnkd.in/eh4mmVJb Together with OPERA Amsterdam Joods Cultureel Kwartier Beersnielsen Lichtontwerpers Shosho Bruns Ata Tech B.V. #studiolouter #nationaalholocaustmuseum #exhibitiondesign #glassteardrops #studiolouter #touchedbystudiolouter 📷 pictures by Thijs Wolzak and Mike Bink fotografie\n\nHow does Emotion Design enhance the storytelling in ‘The Ship of Dreams’? And how does technology aid in achieving its creative goals and engaging the public? Our Content Designer Eline Koning had the honor of discussing these questions - and much more - at the 23rd online edition of The Best in Heritage. She spoke with Gabriela da Rocha about ‘The Ship of Dreams’ project at Titanic Belfast. This project won numerous awards, including the THEA Award (2023), the F@IMP Claude Nicole Hocqard Grand Prize of Avicom (2023) and was shortlisted for the 2024 Museum & Heritage Awards in the ‘Permanent Exhibition of the Year’ category. In 2023 we completed an ambitious makeover at Titanic Belfast, designed to connect future generations to the history of the Titanic. Visitor input guided the project, shaping sensory and immersive design. Amid the immersive trend, the challenge was to make the experience meaningful and tell a story; to go beyond the wow-effect. Using Studio Louter’s Emotion Design method, our team combined innovative technology with emotional storytelling to deeply engage the visitors. We created the project together with OPERA Amsterdam Shosho DHA Designs Marcom DJ Willrich Ltd Fiction Factory 181. The online edition of The Best in Heritage was in partnership with Europa Nostra and under patronage of International Council of Museums (ICOM). ✨ #studiolouter #touchedbyemotiondesign 📽 video: https://lnkd.in/e4SiQ-Nb\n\nHow can we expose the full extent of the crimes by the Nazis in unvarnished, unfiltered form? The ‘wallpaper of crimes’ lists an overwhelming stream of Nazi’s rules and laws enacted to carry out the Holocaust. These regulations paper the walls of the galleries from floor to ceiling, emphasizing that the Holocaust was not a coincidence of anonymous crimes. It was a deliberate, systematic act of dehumanization and mass murder, largely committed in broad daylight. In the Netherlands, Jews were banned from visiting parks, zoos, cafés, restaurants, hotels, pensions, cabarets, cinemas, sport clubs, concerts, public libraries and museums. They were prohibited from owning or operating vehicles or to steer them. A curfew confined them to their homes from 8 pm to 6 am, unable to use bicycles or public transportation. This list continues, gallery after gallery, meter after meter. “The museum ingeniously reveals how the exclusion of Jews was escalated step by step. (…) As a visitor, you feel the weight of the words pressing down on you.” – NRC, 8 March 2024 Read more: https://lnkd.in/eh4mmVJb Together with Opera Amsterdam B.V.

But how do these stories become a museum exhibit? We set ourselves a task given to us by the handwritten plea of three victims: don’t forget us! We began by rehumanizing the victims through the ‘forget-me-nots’ - nineteen uniquely designed display cases. A personal object, a photographic portrait, a brief text and an audio fragment paint the picture of a precious individual lost in the Holocaust. One such story is that of nine-year-old Rosa Schlamowitz. Her parents, still haunted by the memory of Kristallnacht, made the painful decision to send her away to ensure her safety. Before Rosa left for the Netherlands in 1939, Rosa’s mother gave her a silver medallion to take with her. Rosa did not survive the Holocaust. “Eighty years on, the National Holocaust Museum is doing what many Dutch failed to do just after the war: truly seeing the victims of the Holocaust, as human beings.” – Trouw, 5 maart 2024 Read more about the project: https://lnkd.in/eh4mmVJb Together with Opera Amsterdam B.V.

Visitors learn about the misconceptions and stereotypes of the late Middle Ages through following an 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐥. Visitors explore the mysterious halls and doorways, encountering 𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐬 that were found in the castle’s moat along the way. To these fragments, we’ve linked 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 that come together to paint a new picture of the late Middle Ages. For the young visitors we added 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐟𝐮𝐥 elements. From smelling different beer ingredients in the brew cellar to puzzling with ancient shards like a true archaeologist in the 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐥𝐚𝐛, there’s plenty of fun to be had. Moreover, little ‘secrets’ scattered around the castle unmask 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐡é𝐬. As a result, visitors get to form a fresh and revised picture of this fascinating period.
