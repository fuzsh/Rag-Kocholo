She was a student of art, the only child of a domineering father\n\nwho brought her up as if she had been his son. In her mood of rebellion\n\nshe found in Picasso a gentleness and depth of understanding she had not\n\nknown in any other man. They were to live together for the next ten years;\n\nshe was to bear him two children. Their relationship forms the substance\n\nof a new book, LIFE WITH PICASSO, to be published this winter by\n\nMcGraw-Hill. This excerpt is taken from the opening part.\n\nby FranÃ§oise Gilot and Carlton Lake\n\nI met Pablo Picasso in May, 1943, during the German occupation of France.\n\nI was twenty-one, and I felt already that painting was my whole life. At\n\nthat time I had as houseguest an old school friend named GeneviÃ¨ve, who\n\nhad come up from her home near Montpellier, in the south of France, to\n\nspend a month with me. With her and the actor Alain Cuny, I went to have\n\ndinner one Wednesday at a small restaurant then much frequented by\n\npainters and writers. It was called Le Catalan and was in the Rue des\n\nGrands-Augustins on the Left Bank, near Notre Dame.\n\nReturn to Flashback: Portraits of Picasso When we got there that evening\n\nand were seated, I saw Picasso for the first time. He was at the next\n\ntable with a group of friends: a man, whom I didn't recognize, and two\n\nwomen. One of the women I knew to be Marie-Laure, Vicomtesse de\n\nNoailles, the owner of an important collection of paintings, who is\n\nnow something of a painter herself. At that time, though she had\n\nnot yet taken up painting -- at least publicly -- but she had written a\n\npoetic little book called The Tower of Babel.\n\nShe had a long, narrow, somewhat decadent-looking face\n\nframed by an ornate coiffure that reminded me of Rigaud's portrait of\n\nLouis XIV in the Louvre.\n\nThe other woman, Alain Cuny whispered to me, was Dora Maar, a Yugoslav\n\nphotographer and painter, who, as everyone knew, had been Picasso's\n\ncompanion since 1936. Even without his help I would have had no trouble\n\nidentifying her, because I knew Picasso's work well enough to recognize\n\nthat this was the woman who was shown in the Portrait of D . . . M . . .\n\nin its many forms and variants. She had a beautiful oval face but a heavy\n\njaw, which is a characteristic trait of almost all the portraits Picasso\n\nhas made of her. Her hair was black and pulled back in a severe, starkly\n\ndramatic coiffure. I noticed her intense bronze-green eyes, and her\n\nslender hands with their long, tapering fingers. The most remarkable thing\n\nabout her was her extraordinary immobility. She talked little, made no\n\ngestures at all, and there was something in her bearing that was more than\n\ndignity -- a certain rigidity. There is a French expression that is very\n\napt: she carried herself like the holy sacrament.\n\nI was a little surprised at Picasso's appearance. My impression of what he\n\nought to look like had been founded on the photograph by Man Ray in the\n\nspecial Picasso number of the art review Cahiers d'Art published in 1936:\n\ndark hair, bright, flashing eyes, very squarely built, rugged -- a\n\nhandsome animal. When I saw him now, with his hair graying to white,\n\nand with an absent look -- either distracted or bored -- he had a withdrawn,\n\noriental appearance that reminded me of the statue of the Egyptian scribe\n\nin the Louvre. There was nothing sculptural or fixed in his manner of\n\nmoving, however; he gesticulated, he twisted and turned, he got up, he\n\nmoved rapidly back and forth.\n\nAs the meal went on I noticed Picasso watching us, and from time to time\n\nacting a bit for our benefit. It was evident that he recognized Cuny, and\n\nhe made remarks that we were obviously supposed to overhear. Whenever\n\nhe said something particularly amusing, he smiled at us rather than just at\n\nhis dinner companions. Finally he got up and came over to our table. He\n\nbrought with him a bowl of cherries and offered some to all of us, in his\n\nstrong Spanish accent calling them cerisses, with a soft, double-s sound.\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve was a very beautiful girl, of French Catalan ancestry but a\n\nGrecian type, with a nose that was a direct prolongation of her forehead.\n\nIt was a head, Picasso later told me, that he felt he had already painted\n\nin his work of the Ingresque or Roman period. She often accentuated that\n\nGrecian quality, as she did that evening, by wearing a flowing, pleated\n\ndress.\n\n\"Well, Cuny,\" Picasso said. \"Are you going to introduce me to your\n\nfriends?\" Cuny introduced us and then said, \"FranÃ§oise is the intelligent\n\none.\" Pointing to GeneviÃ¨ve, he said, \"She's the beautiful one. Isn't she\n\njust like an Attic marble?\"\n\nPicasso shrugged. \"You talk like an actor,\" he said. \"How would you\n\ncharacterize the intelligent one?\"\n\nThat evening I was wearing a green and brown turban that covered much of\n\nmy brow and my cheeks. GeneviÃ¨ve answered his question.\n\n\"FranÃ§oise is a Florentine virgin,\" she said.\n\n\"But not the usual kind,\" Cuny said. \"A secularized virgin.\" Everybody\n\nlaughed.\n\n\"All the more interesting if she's not the ordinary kind,\" Picasso said.\n\n\"But what do they do, your two refugees from the history of art?\"\n\n\"We're painters,\" GeneviÃ¨ve answered.\n\nPicasso burst out laughing. \"That's the funniest thing I've heard all day.\n\nGirls who look like that can't be painters.\" I told him that GeneviÃ¨ve was\n\nonly on holiday in Paris and that she was a pupil of Maillol in Banyuls,\n\nand that although I wasn't anybody's pupil, I was very much a painter. In\n\nfact, I said, we were having a joint exhibition of paintings and drawings\n\nright at the moment in a gallery in the Rue Boissy d'Anglas, behind the\n\nPlace de la Concorde.\n\nPicasso looked down at us in mock surprise. \"Well, I'm a painter, too,\" he\n\nsaid. \"You must come to my studio and see some of my paintings.\"\n\n\"When?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Tomorrow. The next day. When you want to.\"\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve and I compared notes. We told him we'd come not tomorrow, not\n\nthe next day, but perhaps the first of the next week. Picasso bowed. \"As\n\nyou wish,\" he said. He shook hands all around, picked up his bowl of\n\ncherries, and went back to his table.\n\nTHE following Monday morning, about eleven o'clock, GeneviÃ¨ve and I\n\nclimbed a dark, narrow, winding staircase hidden away in a corner of the\n\ncobblestone courtyard at 7 Rue des Grands Augustins and knocked on the\n\ndoor of Picasso's apartment. After a long wait it was opened about three\n\nor four inches, and the pointed nose of his secretary, Jaime SabartÃ©s,\n\ncame through. We had never seen him before, but we knew who he was.\n\nWe had seen reproductions of drawings Picasso had made of him, and\n\nCuny had told us that SabartÃ©s would be the one who received us. He\n\nlooked at us rather suspiciously and asked, \"Do you have an appoint-\n\nment?\" I said we did. He let us in. He looked anxious as he peered\n\nout from behind his thick-lensed glasses.\n\nWe entered an anteroom where there were many plants and birds: turtle-\n\ndoves and a number of exotic species in wicker cages. The plants were not\n\npretty; they were the spiky green ones you see frequently in copper pots\n\nin a concierge's loge. Here they were arranged more appealingly, though,\n\nand in front of the high open window they made a rather pleasing effect. I\n\nhad seen one of those plants a month before in a recent portrait of Dora\n\nMaar that was hung -- in spite of the Nazi ban on Picasso's work -- in an\n\nout-of-the-way alcove of the Louise Leiris gallery in the Rue d'Astorg. It\n\nwas a magnificent portrait, in pink and gray. In the background of the\n\npicture there was a framework of panels like the panes of the large\n\nantique window I now saw, a cage of birds, and one of those spiky plants.\n\nFrom that room we followed SabartÃ©s into a second one, which was very\n\nlong. I saw several old Louis XIII sofas and chairs and, spread out on\n\nthem, guitars, mandolins, and other musical instruments which, I supposed,\n\nPicasso must have used in his painting during the Cubist period. He later\n\ntold me that he had bought them after he painted the pictures, not before,\n\nand kept them there now as a kind of remembrance of his Cubist days. The\n\nroom had noble proportions, but everything was at sixes and sevens. The\n\nlong table that stretched out before us and two long carpenter's tables,\n\none after the other against the right-hand wall, were covered with an\n\naccumulation of book, magazines, newspapers, photographs, hats, and\n\nmiscellaneous clutter. On top of one of these tables was a rough piece of\n\namethyst crystal, about the size of a human head. In the center of it was\n\na small, totally enclosed cavity filled with what appeared to be water. On\n\na shelf underneath it I saw several men's suits folded up and three or\n\nfour pairs of old shoes.\n\nAs we walked past the long table in the center of the room, I noticed that\n\nSabartÃ©s moved out around a dull brownish object lying on the floor, near\n\nthe door that led into the next room. When I came closer to it, I saw that\n\nit was a sculpture of a skull cast in bronze.\n\nThe next room we went into was a studio almost entirely filled with\n\nsculptures. I saw The Man With the Sheep, now cast in bronze and standing\n\nin the square at Vallauris, but at that time simply in plaster. Then there\n\nwere a number of large heads of women that Picasso had done at Boisgeloup\n\nin 1932. There was a wild disorder of bicycle handlebars, rolls of canvas,\n\na fifteenth-century Spanish polychromed wooden Christ, and a weird and\n\nspindly sculpture of a woman holding an apple in one hand and what looked\n\nlike a hot-water bottle in the other arm.\n\nWhat hit me hardest, though, was a glowing canvas by Matisse, a still life\n\nof 1912, with a bowl of oranges on a pink tablecloth against a light\n\nultramarine and brighter pink background. I remember also a Vuillard, a\n\nDouanier Rousseau, and a Modigliani, but above all, in that shadowy\n\nstudio, the glow of color of the Matisse was particularly striking among\n\nthe sculptures. I couldn't prevent myself from saying, \"Oh, what a\n\nbeautiful Matisse.\" SabartÃ©s turned around and said austerely, \"Here there\n\nis only Picasso.\"\n\nBY ANOTHER little winding staircase, on the far side of the room, we\n\nclimbed to the second floor of Picasso's apartments. Upstairs the ceiling\n\nwas much lower. We passed into a large studio. On the other side of the\n\nroom I saw Picasso, surrounded by a group of six or eight. He was dressed\n\nin an old pair of trousers that hung loosely from his hips, and a\n\nblue-striped sailor's jersey. When he saw us, his face lighted up in a\n\npleasant smile. He left the group and came over to us. SabartÃ©s muttered\n\nsomething about our having an appointment and then went downstairs.\n\n\"Would you like me to show you around?\" Picasso asked. We said we would\n\nindeed. We hoped he would show us some of his paintings, but we didn't\n\ndare ask. He took us back downstairs into the sculpture studio.\n\n\"Before I came here,\" he said, \"this lower floor was used as a workshop by\n\na weaver, and the upper floor was an actor's studio -- Jean-Louis\n\nBarrault's. It was here, in this very room, that I painted Guernica.\" He\n\nsettled back onto one of the Louis XIII tables in front of a pair of\n\nwindows that looked out onto an interior courtyard. \"Other than that,\n\nthough, I hardly ever work in this room. I did L'Homme au Mouton here,\"\n\nhe said, pointing to the large plaster sculpture of the man holding the sheep\n\nin his arms, \"but I do my painting upstairs, and I generally work on my\n\nsculpture in another studio I have a little way up the street.\n\n\"That covered spiral stairway you walked up to get here,\" he said, \"is the\n\none the young painter in Balzac's Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu climbed when he\n\ncame to see old Pourbus, the friend of Poussin who painted pictures nobody\n\nunderstood. Oh, the whole place is full of historical and literary ghosts.\n\nWell, let's get back upstairs,\" he said. He slid off the table, and we\n\nfollowed him up the winding staircase. He took us through the big studio,\n\naround the group of people, none of whom looked up at us as we passed\n\nthrough, and into a small room in the far corner.\n\n\"This is where I do my engraving,\" he said. \"And look here.\" He walked\n\nover to a sink and turned on a faucet. After a while the water became\n\nsteamy. \"Isn't it marvelous,\" he said. \"In spite of the war, I have hot\n\nwater. In fact,\" he added, \"you could come here and have a hot bath any\n\ntime you liked.\"\n\nAbout one o'clock the group around us broke up, and everyone started to\n\nleave. The thing that struck me as most curious that first day was the\n\nfact that SabartÃ©s was obviously a kind of monk of the Picasso religion,\n\nand all the people who were there had the air of being completely immersed\n\nin that religion except the one to whom it was addressed. He seemed to be\n\ntaking it all for granted but not attaching any importance to it, as if he\n\nwere trying to show us that he didn't have any desire to be the central\n\nfigure in a cult.\n\nAs we turned to go, Picasso said, \"If you want to come back again, by all\n\nmeans come. But if you do come, don't come like pilgrims to Mecca. Come\n\nbecause you like me, because you find my company interesting, and because\n\nyou want to have a simple, direct relationship with me. If you only want\n\nto see my paintings, you'd better go to a museum.\"\n\nI didn't take that remark of his too seriously. In the first place, there\n\nwere almost no paintings of his to be seen in any of the Paris museums at\n\nthat time. Then, too, since he was on the Nazi list of proscribed\n\npainters, no private gallery was able to show his work openly or in\n\nquantity. And looking at another painter's work in a book of reproductions\n\nis no satisfaction for a painter. So if anyone wanted to see more of his\n\nwork -- as I did -- there was almost nowhere to go except 7 Rue des\n\nGrands-Augustins.\n\nA few days after that first visit I dropped in at the gallery where\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve and I were having our exhibition. The woman who ran it told me\n\nexcitedly that a little earlier a short man with piercing dark eyes,\n\nwearing a blue-and-white-striped sailor's jersey, had come in. She had\n\nrealized, after the first shock, that he was Picasso. He had studied the\n\npaintings intently and then walked out without saying anything, she told\n\nme. When I got home, I told GeneviÃ¨ve about his visit. I said he had\n\nprobably gone to see how bad our paintings were and prove to himself the\n\ntruth of what he had said when he met us at Le Catalan: \"Girls who look\n\nlike that can't be painters.\"\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve took a more idealistic view of it. \"I think it's a nice human\n\ntouch,\" she said. \"It shows he takes a real interest in young artists'\n\nwork.\"\n\nI wasn't convinced. At best it was curiosity, I felt. \"He just wanted to\n\nsee what we had inside -- if anything.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're so cynical,\" she said. \"He seemed to me very kind,\n\nopen-minded, and simple.\"\n\nI told her I thought he perhaps wanted to appear simple, but I had looked\n\ninto those eyes of his and seen something quite different. It hadn't\n\nfrightened me, though. In fact it made me want to go back. I temporized\n\nfor about another week and then, one morning, with GeneviÃ¨ve in tow,\n\nreturned to the Rue des Grands-Augustins. It was SabartÃ©s, of course, who\n\nopened the door for us again, sticking his head outside like a little sand\n\nfox. This time he admitted us without comment.\n\nRemembering from our first visit the very pleasant entrance with its many\n\nplants and exotic birds in wicker cages lighted by the high window, we had\n\ndecided to add a little color to the greenery, and so we arrived carrying\n\na pot of cineraria. When Picasso saw us he laughed.\n\n\"Nobody brings flowers to an old gent,\" he said. Then he noticed that my\n\ndress was the same color as the blossoms, or vice versa. \"You think of\n\neverything, I can see that,\" he said. I pushed GeneviÃ¨ve in front of me.\n\n\"Here's beauty, followed by intelligence,\" I reminded him.\n\nHe looked us over carefully, then said, \"That remains to be seen. What I\n\nsee now are simply two very different types of beauty: archaic Greece and\n\nJean Goujon.\"\n\nOn our first visit he had shown us only a few pictures. This time he made\n\nup for it. He piled them up almost like a scaffolding. There was a\n\npainting on the easel; he stuck another on top of that, one on each side,\n\npiled others on top of those, until it seemed like a highly skilled\n\nbalancing act of the human-pyramid kind. As I found out later, he used to\n\narrange them that way almost every day. They always held together by some\n\nkind of miracle, but as soon as anyone else touched them, they came\n\ntumbling down. That morning there were cocks, a buffet of Le Catalan with\n\ncherries against a background of brown, black, and white: small still\n\nlifes, some with lemon and many with glasses, a cup, and a coffeepot, or\n\nwith fruit, against a checked tablecloth. He seemed to be playing with\n\ncolors as he sorted them out and tossed them up onto the scaffolding.\n\nThere was a large nude, a three-quarter rear view that one saw at the same\n\ntime front view, in earth tones, very close to the palette of the Cubist\n\nperiod. There were also scenes of the Vert Galant, that little tip of the\n\nIle de la Cite on the other side of the Pont Neuf. In these paintings\n\nthere were trees on which each branch was made out of separate spots of\n\npaint, much in the manner of Van Gogh. There were several showing mothers\n\nwith enormous children whose heads, reached the very top of the canvas,\n\nsomewhat in the spirit of the Catalan primitives.\n\nMany of the paintings he showed us that morning had a culinary basis:\n\nskinned rabbits, or pigeons with peas, a kind of reflection of the hard\n\ntime most people were having to get food. There were others almost like\n\npapiers collÃ©s, with a sausage stuck onto an otherwise carefully composed\n\nbackground; or portraits of women wearing hats topped with forks or fishes\n\nand other kinds of food. Finally he showed us a group of portraits of Dora\n\nMaar, very tortured in form, which he had painted over the past two years.\n\nThey are among the finest paintings he has ever done, I believe.\n\nSuddenly he decided he had shown us enough He walked away from his\n\npyramid. \"I saw your exhibition,\" he said, looking at me. I didn't have\n\nthe courage to ask him what he thought of it, so I just looked surprised.\n\n\"You're very gifted for drawing,\" he went on. \"I think you should keep on\n\nworking -- hard -- every day. I'll be curious to see how your work\n\ndevelops. I hope you'll show me other things from time to time.\" Then he\n\nadded, to GeneviÃ¨ve, \"I think you've found the right teacher in Maillol.\n\nOne good Catalan deserves another.\"\n\nLittle else he said that morning registered very deeply with me. I left\n\nthe Rue des Grands-Augustin feeling very buoyant, impatient to get back to\n\nmy studio and go to work.\n\nSOON after that second visit, GeneviÃ¨ve went back to the Midi. I wanted to\n\nreturn to the Rue des Grands-Augustins by myself, but I felt it was a\n\nlittle early to show Picasso any new work, even though he had been more\n\nthan cordial in his invitation to come see him as often as I wanted to. I\n\nwondered more than once whether, if he had met me alone, he would even\n\nhave noticed me. Meeting me with GeneviÃ¨ve, he saw a theme that runs\n\nthrough his entire work and was particularly marked during the 1930s: two\n\nwomen together, one fair and the other dark, the one all curves and the\n\nother externalizing her internal conflicts, with a personality that goes\n\nbeyond the pictorial; one, the kind of woman who has a purely aesthetic\n\nand plastic life with him; the other, the type whose nature is reflected\n\nin dramatic expression. When he saw the two of us that morning, he saw in\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve a version of formal perfection, and in me, who lacked that\n\nformal perfection, a quality of unquiet which was actually an echo of his\n\nown nature. That created an image for him, I'm sure. He even said, \"I'm\n\nmeeting beings I painted twenty years ago.\" It was certainly one of the\n\noriginal causes of the interest he showed.\n\nWhen I did go back to see him, it wasn't long before he began to make very\n\nclear another side of the nature of his interest in me.\n\nThere were always quite a few people waiting to see him, some in the long\n\nroom on the lower floor, where SabartÃ©s held forth, others in the large\n\npainting atelier on the floor above. Picasso, I soon noticed, was always\n\nlooking for some excuse to get me off into another room where he could be\n\nalone with me for a few minutes. The first time, I remember, the pretext\n\nwas some tubes of paint he wanted to give me. Having an idea that there\n\nwas more involved than just paints, I asked him why he didn't bring them\n\nto me. SabartÃ©s, never very far away, said, \"Yes, Pablo, you should bring\n\nthem to her.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Picasso asked. \"If I'm going to give her a gift, the least she can\n\ndo is make the effort to go after it.\"\n\nAnother morning, I had gone there on my bicycle, since that was the only\n\nway one could get around conveniently at that period. En route it had\n\nstarted to rain, and my hair was soaking wet. \"Just look at the poor\n\ngirl,\" Picasso said to SabartÃ©s. \"We can't leave her in that state.\" He\n\ntook me by the arm. \"You come with me into the bathroom and let me dry\n\nyour hair,\" he said .\n\n\"Look, Pablo,\" SabartÃ©s said, \"perhaps I should get InÃ¨s to do it. She'll\n\ndo it better.\"\n\n\"You leave InÃ¨s where she is,\" Picasso said. \"She's got her own work to\n\ndo.\" He guided me into the bathroom and carefully dried my hair for me.\n\nOf course, Picasso didn't have a situation like that handed to him every\n\ntime. He had to manufacture his own. And so the next time it might be some\n\nspecial drawing paper he had uncovered in one of the countless dusty\n\ncorners of the atelier. But whatever the pretext, it was quite clear that\n\nhe was trying to discover to what degree I might be receptive to his\n\nattentions. I had no desire to give him grounds to make up his mind, one\n\nway or the other. I was having too much fun watching him to figure it all\n\nout.\n\nOne day he said to me, \"I want to show you my museum.\" He took me into\n\na small room adjoining the sculpture studio. Against the left-hand wall was\n\na glass case about seven feet high, five feet wide, and a foot deep. It\n\nhad four or five shelves and held many different kinds of art objects.\n\n\"These are my treasures,\" he said. He led me over to the center of the\n\nvitrine and pointed to a very striking wooden foot on one of the shelves.\n\n\"That's Old Kingdom,\" he said. \"There's all of Egypt in that foot. With a\n\nfragment like that, I don't need the rest of the statue.\"\n\nRanged across the top shelf were about ten very slender sculptures of\n\nwomen, from a foot to a foot and a half high, cast in bronze. \"Those I\n\ncarved in wood in 1931,\" he said. \"And look over here.\" He pushed me\n\nvery gently toward the end of the case and tapped on the glass in front of a\n\ngroup of small stones incised with female profiles, the head of a bull and\n\nof a faun. \"I did those with this,\" he said, and fished out of his pocket\n\na small jackknife, labeled \"Opinel,\" with a single folding blade. On\n\nanother shelf, and next to a wooden hand and forearm that were\n\nrecognizably Easter Island, I noticed a small flat piece of bone about\n\nthree inches long. On its long sides were painted parallel lines imitating\n\nthe teeth of a comb. In the center, between the two strips of \"teeth,\" was\n\na cartouche showing two bugs meeting in head-on combat, one about to\n\nswallow up the other. I asked Picasso what that was. \"That's a comb for\n\nlice,\" he said. \"I'd give it to you but I don't imagine you'd have any use\n\nfor it.\" He ran his fingers through my hair and parted it at the roots\n\nhere and there. \"No,\" he said, \"you seem to be all right in that\n\ndepartment.\"\n\nI moved back to the center of the vitrine. There was a cast of his\n\nsculpture A Glass of Absinthe, about nine inches high, with a hole cut\n\ninto the front of the glass and a real spoon on top, bearing a simulated\n\nlump of sugar. \"I did that long before you were born,\" he said. \"Back in\n\n1914. I modeled it in wax and added a real spoon and had six of them cast\n\nin bronze, then painted each one differently. Here, this will amuse you.\"\n\nHe put his arm around me and sidled over to another part of the case,\n\ndrawing me along with him. I saw a small matchbox on which he had\n\npainted the head of a woman in a post-Cubist manner. I asked him\n\nwhen he had done that.\n\n\"Oh, two or three years ago,\" he said. \"These, too.\" He pointed to a group\n\nof cigarette boxes on which he had painted women seated in armchairs.\n\nThree of them, I noticed, were dated 1940. \"You see, I built them up in\n\nrelief by pasting other bits of cardboard in various places,\" he said. He\n\npointed to the one in the center. \"For that one, I sewed on the panel that\n\nmakes the central part of the torso. Notice the hair. It's pretty close to\n\nbeing hair -- it's string. These things are midway between sculpture and\n\npainting, I suppose.\"\n\nOn the opposite side of the room from the vitrine was a table covered with\n\ntools. I walked over to it. Picasso followed me. \"These I use in finishing\n\nmy sculpture,\" he said. He picked up a file. \"This is something I use all\n\nthe time.\" He tossed it back and picked up another. \"This one is for finer\n\nsurfaces.\" One after another he handled a plane, pincers, nails of all\n\nkinds -- \"for engraving on plaster\" -- a hammer, and with each one he came\n\ncloser to me. When he dropped the last piece back onto the table he turned\n\nabruptly and kissed me, full on the mouth. I let him. He looked at me in\n\nsurprise.\n\n\"You don't mind?\" he asked. I said no -- should I? He seemed shocked.\n\n\"That's disgusting,\" he said. \"At least you could have pushed me away.\n\nOtherwise I might get the idea I could do anything I wanted to.\" I smiled\n\nand told him to go ahead. By now he was thrown completely off the track.\n\nI knew very well he didn't know what he wanted to do, or even whether,\n\nand I had an idea that by saying, placidly, yes, I would discourage him from\n\ndoing anything at all, so I said, \"I'm at your disposition.\" He looked at\n\nme cautiously, then asked, \"Are you in love with me?\" I said I couldn't\n\nguarantee that, but at least I liked him and I felt very much at ease with\n\nhim, and I saw no reason for setting up in advance any limits to our\n\nrelationship. Again he said, \"That's disgusting. How do you expect me to\n\nseduce anyone under conditions like that? If you're not going to resist --\n\nwell, then it's out of the question. I'll have to think it over.\" And he\n\nwalked back into the sculpture studio to join the others.\n\nA FEW days later he brought up the question in a similar manner. I told\n\nhim I could promise him nothing in advance, but he could always try and\n\nsee for himself. That nettled him. \"In spite of your youth,\" he said, \"I\n\nget the impression that you've had a lot of experience in that sort of\n\nthing.\" I said no, not really. \"Well, then, I don't understand you,\" he\n\nsaid. \"It doesn't make sense, the way you act.\" I said I couldn't help\n\nthat. That's the way it was, sense or nonsense. Besides, I wasn't afraid\n\nof him, so I couldn't very well act as though I were. \"You're too\n\ncomplicated for me,\" he said. That slowed him down for a while longer.\n\nA week or so later, I went to see him. Using the by now familiar\n\ntechnique, he managed to maneuver me into his bedroom. He picked up\n\na book from a pile on a chair near his bed. \"Have you read the\n\nMarquis de Sade?\" he asked me. I told him no. \"Aha! I shock you,\n\ndon't I?\" he said, looking very proud of himself. I said no. I told\n\nhim that although I hadn't read Sade, I had no objection to it.\n\nAnd I had read Choderlos de Laclos and Restif de Bretonne.\n\nAs for Sade, I could make out without it but perhaps he couldn't,\n\nI suggested. In any case, I told him, the principle of the victim\n\nand the executioner didn't interest me. I didn't think either one\n\nof those roles suited me very well.\n\n\"No, no, I didn't mean that,\" he said. \"I just wondered if that might\n\nshock you.\" He seemed a little disappointed. \"You're more English than\n\nFrench, I think,\" he told me. \"You've got the English kind of reserve.\"\n\nAfter that his campaign slacked off. He was less friendly whenever I\n\ndropped in mornings, but since I hadn't encouraged his early approaches,\n\nI was clearly hesitant about attempting further advances. I was just as well\n\npleased.\n\nOne morning toward the end of June, he told me he wanted to show me the\n\nview from the \"forest.\" In French that word is used to refer to the\n\nframework of beams that come together to form the support for the roof.\n\nHe took me into the hallway outside his painting studio on the upper floor.\n\nThere, at an angle against the wall, was a miller's ladder leading up to a\n\nsmall door about three feet above our heads. He bowed gallantly. \"You go\n\nfirst, he said. I had some qualms about it, but it seemed awkward to argue\n\nthe point, so I climbed the ladder and he followed right behind. At the\n\ntop I pushed open the door and stepped into a small room, about twelve\n\nfeet by twenty, under the eaves. On the other side of the room was a small\n\nopen window, almost to the floor. I walked over to it and looked out on a\n\nkind of Cubist pattern formed by the roofs and chimney pots of the Left\n\nBank. Picasso came up behind me and put his arms around me. \"I'd better\n\nhold onto you,\" he said. \"I wouldn't like to have you fall out and give\n\nthe house a bad name.\" It had grown warmer in the last few days, and he\n\nwas wearing what seemed to be his usual warm-weather outfit for receiving\n\nhis friends in the morning: a pair of white shorts and his slippers.\n\n\"That's nice, the roofs of Paris,\" he said. \"One could make paintings of\n\nthat.\" I continued to look out the window. Opposite us, a little to the\n\nright across a courtyard, an empty building was being remodeled. On one of\n\nthe outside walls, a workman had drawn in whitewash an enormous phallus,\n\nabout seven feet long, with very baroque subsidiary decoration. Picasso\n\nwent on talking about the view and the handsome old roofs against light\n\ngray-blue of the sky. He moved his hands up and lightly cupped them over\n\nmy breasts. I didn't move. Finally, a bit too innocently I thought, he\n\nsaid, \"Tiens! That drawing in whitewash on the wall over there -- what do\n\nyou suppose that represents?\" Trying to sound as offhand as he had, I said\n\nI didn't know. It didn't seem to me to be at all figurative, I told him.\n\nPortraits of Picasso.\n\nCopyright Â© 1964 by FranÃ§oise Gilot and Carlton Lake.
