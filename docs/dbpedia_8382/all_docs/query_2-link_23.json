A child prodigy , he became one of the most important and influential composers in the history of Hollywood . He was a noted pianist and composer of classical music , along with music for Hollywood films , and the first composer of international stature to write Hollywood scores . When he was 11 , his ballet Der Schneemann ( The Snowman ) , became a sensation in Vienna , followed by his Piano Sonata which he wrote at age 13 , played throughout Europe by Artur Schnabel . His one-act operas Violanta and Der Ring des Polykrates were premiered in Munich in 1916 , conducted by Bruno Walter . At 23 , his opera Die tote Stadt ( The Dead City ) premiered in Hamburg and Colgne . In 1921 he conducted the Hamburg Opera . During the 1920s he re-orchestrated , re-arranged and nearly re-composed , for the theater , operettas by Johann Strauss II . By 1931 he was a professor of music at Vienna State Academy . At the request of director Max Reinhardt , and due to the rise of the Nazi regime , Korngold moved to the U.S. in 1934 to write music scores for films . His first was Reinhardt 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( 1935 ) , which was well received by critics . He subsequently wrote scores for such films as Captain Blood ( 1935 ) , which helped boost the career of its starring newcomer , Errol Flynn . His score for Anthony Adverse ( 1936 ) won an Oscar , and was followed two years later with another Oscar for The Adventures of Robin Hood ( 1938 ) . Overall , he wrote the score for 16 Hollywood films , receiving two more nominations . Along with Max Steiner and Alfred Newman , he is one of the founders of film music .

The attacks , launched by the U.S. Navy , were ordered by President Bill Clinton in retaliation for al-Qaeda 's August 7 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , which killed 224 people ( including 12 Americans ) and injured over 4,000 others . Operation Infinite Reach was the first time the U.S. acknowledged a preemptive strike against a violent non-state actor . U.S. intelligence suggested financial ties between the Al-Shifa plant and Osama bin Laden , and a soil sample collected from Al-Shifa allegedly contained a chemical used in VX nerve gas manufacturing . Suspecting that Al-Shifa was linked to , and producing chemical weapons for , bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network , the U.S. destroyed the facility with cruise missiles , killing or wounding 11 Sudanese . The strike on Al-Shifa proved controversial ; after the attacks , the U.S. evidence and rationale were criticized as faulty , and academics Max Taylor and Mohamed Elbushra cite `` a broad acceptance that this plant was not involved in the production of any chemical weapons . '' The missile strikes on al-Qaeda 's Afghan training camps , aimed at preempting more attacks and killing bin Laden , damaged the installations and inflicted an uncertain number of casualties ; however , bin Laden was not present at the time . Following the attacks , the ruling Taliban allegedly reneged on a promise given to Saudi intelligence chief Turki al-Faisal to hand over bin Laden , and the regime instead strengthened its ties with the al-Qaeda chief . Operation Infinite Reach , described by historian Timothy Naftali as `` the largest U.S. military response to a terrorist attack '' since the 1986 bombing of Libya , was met with a mixed international response : U.S. allies and most of the American public supported the strikes , but the targeted countries , Islamic militant groups , and other nations in the Middle East strongly opposed them . The failure of the attacks to kill bin Laden also enhanced his public image in the Muslim world . Further strikes were planned but not executed ; as a 2002 congressional inquiry noted , Operation Infinite Reach was `` the only instance ... in which the CIA or U.S. military carried out an operation directly against Bin Ladin before September 11 .

Two more tracks were recorded there with Richard James Burgess , who had produced tracks on their previous album . The rest of the album was made up of songs written by the band members with the writers producing their own tracks with their father , Buster Pearson , in London . Deniece sings lead on all tracks except `` You Should Have Waited '' ( sung by Lorraine ) and `` Knock Twice '' ( sung by Doris ) .

The ballad `` Strong as Steel '' , written by Diane Warren , was the second single but fared even worse , peaking at number 16 in the UK in October and not charting at all in the US . When the third UK single , `` Somewhere Somebody '' , failed to reach the top 20 in December of that year ( peaking at # 23 ) , promotion of the album ended with no further singles released ( there had been seven and six UK singles from their first two albums respectively ) . Having released a single every two to four months since 1985 , the band released no new material for six months and subsequently changed their image for their next album .
