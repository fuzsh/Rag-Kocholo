        "text": "Palestinian novels\n\nAs the summer vacation period in the Northern Hemisphere approaches, the genocide in Palestine enters its tenth month. Dutch Scholars for Palestine has compiled a list of Palestinian novels to read during this period, to keep our focus on Palestine.\n\n‘Mornings in Jenin’ -Susan Abulhawa (2006)\n\n“‘Mornings in Jenin’ is a multi-generational story about a Palestinian family. Forcibly removed from the olive-farming village of Ein Hod by the newly formed state of Israel in 1948, the Abulhejos are displaced to live in canvas tents in the Jenin refugee camp. We follow the Abulhejo family as they live through a half century of violent history. Amidst the loss and fear, hatred and pain, as their tents are replaced by more forebodingly permanent cinderblock huts, there is always the waiting, waiting to return to a lost home.\n\nThe novel's voice is that of Amal, the granddaughter of the old village patriarch, a bright, sensitive girl who makes it out of the camps, only to return years later, to marry and bear a child. Through her eyes, with her evolving vision, we get the story of her brothers, one who is kidnapped to be raised Jewish, one who will end with bombs strapped to his middle. But of the many interwoven stories, stretching backward and forward in time, none is more important than Amal's own. Her story is one of love and loss, of childhood and marriage and parenthood, and finally the need to share her history with her daughter, to preserve the greatest love she has.”\n\nSource: Bloomsbury Publishers\n\n‘Men in the Sun and Other Palestinian Stories’ -Ghassan Kanafani (1998)\n\n“This collection of important stories by novelist, journalist, teacher, and Palestinian activist Ghassan Kanafani includes the stunning novella ‘Men in the Sun’ (1962), the basis of the movie ‘The Dupes’ (1972, directed by Tewfik Saleh). Also in the volume are ‘The Land of Sad Oranges’ (1958), ‘If You Were a Horse...' (1961), ‘A Hand in the Grave’ (1962), ‘The Falcon’ (1961), ‘Letter from Gaza’ (1956), and an excerpt from ‘Umm Saad’ (1969). In the unsparing clarity of his writing, Kanafani offers the reader a gritty look at the agonized world of Palestine and the adjoining Middle East. Born in Acre (northern Palestine) in 1936, Ghassan Kanafani was a major spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and founding editor of its weekly magazine Al-Hadaf. His novels, short stories, and plays have been published in sixteen languages. He was assassinated in a car-bomb explosion in Beirut in 1972.”\n\nSource: Lynne rienner publishers\n\n‘My First and Only Love’ -Sahar Khalifeh (2010)\n\n“Nidal, after many decades of restless exile, returns to her family home in Nablus, where she had lived with her grandmother before the 1948 Nakba that scattered her family across the globe. She was a young girl when the popular resistance began and, through the bloodshed and bitter struggle, Nidal fell in love with freedom fighter Rabie. He was her first and only real love - him and all that he represented: Palestine in its youth, the resistance fighters in the hills, the nation as embodied in her family home and in the land. Many years later, Nidal and Rabie meet, and he encourages her to read her uncle Amin's memoirs. She immerses herself in the details of her family and national past and discovers the secret history of her absent mother. Filled with emotional urgency and political immediacy, Sahar Khalifeh spins an epic tale reaching from the final days of the British Mandate to today with clear-eyed realism and great imagination.”\n\nSource: American University in Cairo Press\n\n‘In My Mother's Footsteps’ -Mona Hajjar Halaby (2021)\n\n“When Mona moved from California to Ramallah to teach conflict resolution in a school for a year, she kept a journal. Within its pages, she wrote her impressions of her homeland, a place she had only experienced through her mother’s memories. As she settled into her teaching role, getting to know her students and the challenges they faced living in a militarized, occupied town, Mona also embarked on a personal pilgrimage to find her mother’s home in Jerusalem. Mona had dreamed of being guided by her mother down the old souqs, and the leafy streets of her neighborhood, listening to the muezzin’s call for prayer and the medley of church bells. But after fifty-nine years of exile, it was Mona’s mother who held her daughter’s hand as they visited Jerusalem together, walking the narrow cobblestone alleys of the Old City. Their roles were reversed. Mona had become her Mama’s legs and her memory – and the one to tell her story going forward. ‘In My Mother’s Footsteps’ is a moving and heart-rending journey of a daughter discovering her roots and recovering her mother’s beloved past. It’s also an intimate and tender account of daily life for Palestinians as never seen before.”\n\nSource: shoppalestine.org\n\n‘Against the loveless world’ -Susan Abulhawa (2021)\n\n“As Nahr sits, locked away in solitary confinement, she spends her days reflecting on the dramatic events that landed her in prison in a country she barely knows. Born in Kuwait in the seventies to Palestinian refugees, she dreamed of falling in love with the perfect man, raising children, and possibly opening her own beauty salon. Instead, the man she thinks she loves jilts her after a brief marriage, her family teeters on the brink of poverty, she's forced to prostitute herself, and the US invasion of Iraq makes her a refugee, as her parents had been. After trekking through another temporary home in Jordan, she lands in Palestine, where she finally makes a home, falls in love, and her destiny unfolds under Israeli occupation. Nahr's subversive humor and moral ambiguity will resonate with fans of ‘My Sister, The Serial Killer’, and her dark, contemporary struggle places her as the perfect sister to Carmen Maria Machado's ‘Her Body and Other Parties’.”\n\nSource: Washington Square Press\n\n‘All That’s Left to You’ -Ghassan Kanafani (2017)\n\n“‘All That's Left to You’ presents the vivid story of twenty-four hours in the real and remembered lives of a brother and sister living in Gaza and separated from their family. The desert and time emerge as characters as Kanafani speaks through the desert, the brother, and the sister to build the powerful rhythm of the narrative. The Palestinian attachment to land and family, and the sorrow over their loss, are symbolized by the young man's unremitting anger and shame over his sister's sexual disgrace. This remarkable collection of stories provides evidence to the English-reading public of Kanafani's position within modern Arabic literature. Not only was he committed to portraying the miseries and aspirations of his people, the Palestinians, in whose cause he died, but he was also an innovator within the extensive world of Arabic fiction.”\n\nSource: Interlink Books\n\n‘Salt Houses’ -Hala Alyan (2018)\n\n“On the eve of her daughter Alia’s wedding, Salma reads the girl’s future in a cup of coffee dregs. She sees an unsettled life for Alia and her children; she also sees travel and luck. While she chooses to keep her predictions to herself that day, they will all soon come to pass when the family is uprooted in the wake of the Six-Day War of 1967. Salma is forced to leave her home in Nablus; Alia’s brother gets pulled into a politically militarized world he can’t escape; and Alia and her gentle-spirited husband move to Kuwait City, where they reluctantly build a life with their three children. When Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait in 1990, Alia and her family once again lose their home and their land, scattering to Beirut, Paris, Boston, and beyond. Soon Alia’s children begin families of their own, once again navigating the burdens (and blessings) of assimilation in foreign cities.”\n\nSource: halaalyan.com\n\n‘Minor Detail’ -Adania Shibli (2020)\n\n“A beautiful meditation on war, violence, memory and injustice, set in the occupied Palestinian territories. ‘Minor Detail’ begins during the summer of 1949, one year after the war that the Palestinians mourn as the Nakba – the catastrophe that led to the displacement and expulsion of more than 700,000 people – and the Israelis celebrate as the War of Independence. Israeli soldiers capture and rape a young Palestinian woman, and kill and bury her in the sand. Many years later, a woman in Ramallah becomes fascinated to the point of obsession with this ‘minor detail’ of history. A haunting meditation on war, violence and memory, ‘Minor Detail’ cuts to the heart of the Palestinian experience of dispossession, life under occupation, and the persistent difficulty of piecing together a narrative in the face of ongoing erasure and disempowerment.”\n\nSource: Fitzcarraldo Editions\n\nIn Need of More Book Recommendations?\n\nVisit the DSP website. Under the ‘resources’ tab you will find more recommendations of Palestinian films and books to understand the root causes of the situation in Palestine today. For an easy overview, resources are organized in different categories - from the Nakba to visualizing return. Under the same tab, you will also find resources on scholarships and academic boycott, as well as other materials.\n\nNAKBA 101\n\nNakba; noun (Arabic)\n\nThe Nakba was the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948 through the violent displacement and dispossession of Palestinian people, land, property and belongings, along with the destruction of Palestinian society, culture, identity, political rights, and national aspirations.\n\nMay 15th has been declared ‘Nakba Day’ to commemorate these events and demand Palestinian refugees’ Right of Return.\n\nTheodore Herzl, Balfour declaration and the fall of the Ottoman Empire\n\nTheodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian journalist, was one of the initiators of the World Zionist Congress in 1897. Herzl and others believed that Jews in Europe should establish an independent Jewish national homeland to guarantee their freedom. To achieve this, Political Zionists sought to obtain territory from a colonial power to settle. While Herzl considered the colonization of Argentina, Uganda, and Egypt, most European Zionist Jews coveted Palestine for its religious and historical significance. [1]\n\nIn 1917, the Balfour declaration promised the Zionists the establishment of a homeland in Palestine. This declaration, conveyed in a letter by Britain’s Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, was intended for the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. Subsequently, under the terms of the League of Nations’ Mandate for Palestine (1920), Palestine as a former territory of the Ottoman Empire was put under British mandate and rule. The British acquired Mandatory Palestine in 1922 until the first Nakba in 1948, during which the minority Jewish population in Palestine increased as waves of Jewish immigration from Europe arrived. Simultaneously with the Balfour declaration, the British government also promised self-determination to the Arab lands of the Ottoman Empire if they fought with the UK against the Ottomans.\n\nGrowing Resistance and the White Paper\n\nThe distrust between the native Palestinians and the European Zionist settlers intensified after the Balfour declaration, with the British administration favoring the Zionist settlers to the detriment of the Palestinians, even though the Zionist organizations and its residents owned only 6% of the land [1]. This led to a cycle of attacks and counter-attacks between Zionist militias and Palestinians residents, while both also turned against the British rulers. This culminated into the ‘Arab Revolt’ in 1936, when Palestinians started a revolution against the British mandate. The Arab Higher Committee declared 16 May as Palestine Day, and called for a general strike [2].\n\nPalestinians demanding self-determination and an end to unrestricted Jewish immigration and land purchases were brutally repressed by the British Army, with over 19.700 Palestinian executed and killed [3]. These developments led to the UK issuing the White Paper (1939), which rejected the idea of a partition, opposed unregulated Jewish migration, and proposed the establishment of an independent Palestine government in the following 10 years. None of the White Paper’s terms were fulfilled. [3]\n\nThe Village Files: preparing for military ethnic cleansing\n\nBetween 1930 and 1947, Zionist paramilitary organization Haganah gathered the “Village Files”, an inventory of topographic locations, access roads, sociopolitical compositions, and personal information of individuals for each Palestinian village in Mandatory Palestine, preparing for the military ethnic cleansing and occupation [4].\n\nOn 30 November 1947, the UN recommended the Partition Plan for Palestine. Palestinians were fiercely opposed to this proposed partition of their land. Meanwhile, zionist militias began their program of statehood. The massacre and expulsion of Palestinians and destruction of villages began in December [5].\n\nThe Nakba\n\nIn April 1948, Plan Dalet was launched to gain control of the areas outside the borders of what would be the Jewish state according to the Partition Plan [6]. By 15 May 1948, over 200 Palestinian villages were destroyed, with reports of several massacres, biological warfare, and over 300.000 Palestinians expelled and displaced [7].\n\nBy the end of the war, with the 1949 Armistice Agreements, 78% of the former Mandatory Palestine was controlled by the newly declared state of Israel, with over 500 Palestinian villages destroyed, and over 750.000 Palestinians expelled [4,6,7]. According to legal definitions in the Genocide Convention, implemented after the events of 1948, the Nakba can and should legally be considered a genocide on the Palestinian people.\n\nPalestinian refugees and the Nakba\n\nThe Palestinian refugees are the indigenous inhabitants of historic Palestine (which includes current-day Israel, the Occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip), who were displaced or expelled from their original homes and lands during the Nakba, as well as their descendants.\n\nIt is difficult to calculate the number of Palestinian refugees with total accuracy. This is due to the historical absence of a comprehensive system for registering the refugees; their multiple displacements as a result of changing political and economic circumstances; and the lack of a uniform definition of a Palestinian refugee.\n\nIn 2021, BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights estimated there to be over 9 million Palestinian refugees, but the number most likely runs far higher. Even without adding those displaced by the current war on Gaza, there is an estimated million unregistered Palestinian refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Iraq.\n\nThe Right of Return\n\nThe Right of Return is an inalienable right enshrined by the The United Nations General Assembly when they adopted resolution 194 (III) in December 1948. It states that “refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.”\n\nTo this day, the Israeli State has denied the Palestinian people the Right of Return, a right repeatedly affirmed by the international community, primarily through the adoption of racist laws that regulate citizenship and residency as well as property and land ownership. Israel’s denial of the Right of Return directly breaches international law, which compels states to make remedies for wrongful acts committed and to guarantee non-recurrence of those acts. It constitutes a violation of the Palestinian right to self-determination, which is incomplete without the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) .\n\nNakba triumphalism\n\nAccording to researchers, there are 10 stages of genocide, the tenth being ‘denial’, according to which the perpetrators of genocide deny any existence of the crime after it happened. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, researchers have identified an eleventh stage, ‘triumphalism.’ Instead of denying the crimes, the perpetrators and their supporters celebrate their deeds and humiliate survivors. We can identify this same pattern within Israel and among its supporters. Examples are an Israeli minister stating that “We are now rolling out the Gaza Nakba” a month after the genocidal war on Gaza started. Other examples are Zionist counter protesters in the US attacking encampments on university campuses yelling ‘second Nakba’ or Israeli webshops selling ‘Nakba now’ shirts. Instead of denying the crimes of 1948, these crimes are being celebrated and used as threats.\n\nOngoing Nakba\n\nInstead of understanding the current genocide in Gaza, Palestine as a singular event, we need to approach it within the context of the ongoing effort to ethnically cleanse native Palestinians from their land. Scholars and Palestinians speak of the ‘ongoing Nakba’. The genocide today is a continuation of the Nakba’s efforts into the 21st century to create a Jewish ethnostate in all of historic Palestine cleared of its native people. When speaking on current events in Palestine, it is crucial to keep emphasizing the interconnectedness of these events. Only then one can correctly assess the settler colonial nature and actions of the Israeli occupation and State.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nContinue to speak up about the ongoing Nakba. Whether at home, at work, with friends and family or while organizing an event: continue to advocate for a liberated Palestine. Support the BDS Movement (Boycott, Divestments, Sanctions). Encourage international institutions to reassess their connections with Israel, and actively bolster Palestinian businesses and organizations. If affiliated with an academic institution, engage in the BDS movement via the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI). One of their demands is that the inalienable Right of Palestinian Return is respected.\n\nOne of the over 500 ethnically cleansed and destroyed villages is the village of Zarnouqa. During this 76th commemoration of the Nakba, the documentary \"Returning to Zarnouqa\" tells a story of generational displacement, genocide, and the inevitability of return.

Then something snapped within Mohammed Benzakour. He declined an invitation to speak at Remembrance Day on the 4th of May.\n\nI had been asked by our regional 4 and 5 May Committee to deliver the Remembrance Day lecture. Guided by the national theme, “Freedom Speaks: Prelude to 80 Years of Freedom”. Honorable, but I politely declined.\n\nAs I read the invitation, all sorts of Gaza videos haunted my mind. I saw again those four teenagers walking, how they were suddenly ground into minced meat one by one, how the fourth tried to escape but his legs refused, fell to his knees, after which a projectile tore him to shreds as well.\n\nI saw soldiers dancing on corpses, having fun with bras and dolls of murdered girls. Mass graves. The image of that starving kid, laboriously lugging a bag of dropped food, also loomed large. He got the bullet.\n\nUndiluted evil\n\nI stopped watching those videos. Our brains are not designed to absorb the undiluted evil of mass murder day in and day out. I prefer to look at a bluebird singing in the reeds.\n\nOur eighty years of freedom and peace run rather parallel to the eighty years of plunder and oppression of the Palestinians. At the front door we celebrate freedom, through the back door we provide equipment that slaughters young boys running for food packages in a sterile manner.\n\nFor eighty years, our love of Israel has led to top achievements. The most recent: the country has murdered more children in four months than the total amount of children who died in conflicts around the world in four years.\n\nAnd the death count, boosted by a starvation operation, increases steadily.\n\nRed carpet\n\nWhat does our celebration of freedom mean when we roll out the red carpet here for the person ultimately responsible for something very much like extermination: Isaac Herzog? The Israeli president received a royal welcome in Amsterdam on March 10 and was the main guest at the grand opening of the National Holocaust Museum.\n\nIf cynicism did not exist, it would have been invented that day.\n\nEmile Schrijver, the museum director, is good at spinning: “Let's not focus on the person Herzog. He represents the Israeli institutions that made documents, photos and video material available to us. He symbolizes a people who lived through the Holocaust.'\n\nLet's give this logic another spin and invite Putin to open the Hermitage. After all, what matters is not the person Putin, what matters is that the man symbolizes an empire that produced brilliant art.\n\nPreamble\n\nPrelude to eighty years of freedom. God, how pleased we were with the most important document of the postwar years: the preamble to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, intended to prevent a repeat of Europe's racial apocalypse.\n\nBut universal? How can the justified fear of anti-Semitism so often degenerate into blind love of Israel? Aren't those two ugly sides of the same coin?\n\nWe know that Israel was founded as a homeland for the Jews, who were victims of pogroms and discrimination for centuries in Europe. But why should Palestinians be robbed and destroyed for crimes committed primarily by Europeans?\n\nNot in a vacuum\n\nLet's stop pulling rabbits out of a hat. Anyone who can pierce through propaganda language can see very clearly that the horror in Gaza has little to do with “self-defense” or Hamas. They know that last October's Hamas attack “did not happen in a vacuum,” as UN chief António Guterres noted.\n\nThey know that the massacres by the Israeli army are an accelerated continuation of an ongoing policy: the apotheosis of a sophisticated settler-colonial project rooted in Zionist ideas from even before the creation of the state of Israel, long before Hamas (founded in 1987) existed.\n\nAbel Herzberg possessed a crystal ball when asked “What should we do to prevent our children from becoming victims again? His answer: “The right question is how to prevent our children from becoming executioners.”\n\nUN resolution\n\nAnd then, on that memorable Friday morning, October 27, 2023, on the threshold of eighty years of national peace & freedom, that's when the Netherlands made history. A UN resolution was voted on in New York, on humanitarian aid to Gaza: food parcels, drinks, clothing, medicine. By then Israel had already cut off water, gas, electricity and internet for three weeks; something that, when Russia did the same to Ukraine, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, had called “war crimes” and “terrorism” - but now she was silent.\n\nThe resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority, 120 countries. The results appeared on a big screen. My eyes searched for the Netherlands and saw a yellow cross. Abstention? Was I dreaming? I looked again carefully. Yep, yellow cross, no doubt.\n\nA month and a half later, December 12, history repeated itself. Now it was about a cease-fire. Practically the whole world, 153 countries, voted for a pause, so survivors could breathe for a while, bury their dead, give children wandering around like zombies some sleep. But the Netherlands once again chose the yellow cross. Never did yellow hurt my eyes so much.\n\nKind people\n\nThen something snapped. A small universe shattered. Something warm became cold. I could no longer believe that this was the country my father had so happily emigrated to in the 1960s. “Holland is a beautiful country with very nice people,” he told us. But little did he know then that this beautiful country would press the yellow cross. That many nice people would look the other way.\n\nIn newspapers and on the radio I hear writers and intellectual daredevils, pregnant with humanity, proclaiming fine talk about the colonial horrors of centuries ago in Africa and the Dutch East Indies, but not a word about the same horrors taking place in real-time in front of their eyes.\n\nAre we going to cry aghast hundreds of years later when the bones of the Palestinian people have turned to dust? Will we then write books like 'The Palestinian Cover-up' and make movies like Selling a Colonial War?\n\n'The world is a dangerous place to live,' Einstein said. 'Not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who do nothing.'\n\nDeath rattle\n\nI always thought that only despots never lose sleep over the massacres they commit, deaf to the scream and the roar of death rising from their hinterland. But with that yellow cross, pressed almost carelessly, this country concealed its own deeds behind a button, and this mechanism became an intermediary between conscience and the very worst. Before the eyes of the world, it branded a people, or what is left of them, with a yellow cross on the forehead, and thus outlawed them.\n\nAnd then... then we will stand on Dam Square on the 4th of May. We celebrate eighty years of freedom. We lay down a royal wreath. We adopt a pious face. A cabinet envoy says: never again. We observe two minutes of silence and lower our eyes. Not for a moment do we curse our human nature. Not for a moment do we feel ashamed. Nor do we wish ourselves a place in the most ignominious grave. But we will never be able to wash off the blood that is on our hands. Remembrance Day, a nice idea, but the dead of the Second World War, and other wars, deserve better.”\n\nMohammed Benzakour is a sociologist and writer.\n\nDutch Scholars for Palestine has received permission from the author to share and translate the complete piece. See the published version in Volkskrant here.\n\nNo to whitewashing racial and colonial policies.\n\nA group of Palestinian and Lebanese scholars and artists reject Dutch subsidy.\n\nIn February 2024, a group of Lebanese and Palestinian scholars and artists refused to accept a subsidy of 600.000 euros from the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, a subsidy originally financed by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They decided to end all cooperation with the institute. The subsidy was meant for two projects concerning sustainable water management in Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon. The IHE Institute has been cooperating on water projects with Palestinian universities for a long time.\n\nThe scholars and artists refused the subsidy for two specific reasons, which they explain in a signed letter. First, they condemn the stance of the Dutch government with regard to the genocide that is being committed by Israel in Gaza. The government’s unconditional support for Israel and its silence concerning Israel’s widespread human rights abuses is unacceptable, according to the group of scholars and artists. Second, the group denounces the IHE’s inaction and refusal to condemn Israel’s crimes in Gaza. Given the long-standing relationship between the IHE and Palestinian universities, the IHE's silence hits the academics and artists even harder.\n\nThe IHE and the Dutch government responded to the letter by Palestinian and Lebanese scholars and artists in different ways. The IHE explained that it “never takes a position in favor of one party or another” and thus emphasized its neutrality. It also underscored that the water projects were aimed at “bringing people closer together”. Moreover, the institute stated that, “should the government change its position”, it hopes to be able to work together with the signatories again. The institution is thus clearly not willing to undertake any action itself. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, claimed it disagrees with the signatories’ criticism of Dutch policy towards Israel and Palestine. In addition, it argued that the subsidized program serves to support the Palestinian people and that due to the group’s refusal, this cannot go ahead anymore. Thus, the Ministry tried to deflect the blame towards its critics.\n\nDSP’s statement\n\nWe applaud the action by the group of Palestinian and Lebanese scholars and artists. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Dutch government are supporting Israel and its genocidal campaign, while Dutch academic institutions try to hide behind a façade of neutrality. However, remaining silent is also taking a stance; it is a political position in itself, one in support of the status quo. As Desmond Tutu, South African bishop and anti-apartheid activist, argued: “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”\n\nWe strongly condemn the attempt of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to blame its critics for its own inability to support the Palestinian people. This neocolonial approach of “we know what is best” is gruesome, especially since that same government continues to enable Israel’s genocidal campaign.\n\nAs a result, it is upon us to undertake action. We will take the brave initiative from our Palestinian and Lebanese colleagues as an inspiration for our own academic boycott campaigns.\n\nSupport PACBI!\n\nWe need to continue to put pressure on Israel and its supporters and financers. One way to do so is by initiating boycott campaigns. Therefore, we urge all people working in the academic and/or cultural sector to join the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI). You can read more about this campaign on PACBI’s webpage, which you can find in our bio. We also encourage everyone to implement BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) in their daily life, for example, by refraining from buying Israeli dates.\n\nA link to the letter (in Dutch) by the group of Palestinian and Lebanese scholars and artists can be found here: https://www.mo.be/opinie/wij-hoeven-uw-geld-niet\n\nInterview conducted by DSP\n\nThe actual experiences of queer Palestinians underscore the deceptiveness of pinkwashing. On November 18th, 2023, DSP interviewed E., a lesbian woman that grew up in Jordan. Her mom is Palestinian, so she would visit Palestine often to see her family, in a village close to Nablus.\n\nWe started by discussing E’s queer journey. She never officially came out to her family, because coming out is a Western element of queer culture, and is not as important for queer people elsewhere. Nonetheless, she does not hide her sexuality from her family. E. told us that her family in Palestine is actually quite accepting, and that her parents have always been supportive.\n\nE. lives in the Netherlands now, and even though queerness is more openly discussed here, she feels like it is also more tokenized. Especially at work, she often feels tokenized not just as a queer woman but also as an Arab person. Moreover, although she feels safe about her lesbian identity in Europe, at times she is afraid of disclosing her Palestinian identity, even in queer spaces. She also told DSP that, even though the Amsterdam queer scene is often praised as the best in the world, the best and most inclusive queer parties/spaces she had ever been to were actually back home and in Lebanon. Her experience definitely contrasts with Israel’s image of a queer haven amongst oppressive Arab countries. We not only discussed how there are other places with vibrant queer cultures in the Middle East, but E also told us that, apart from Tel Aviv, Israel is not necessarily safe for queer people.\n\nNext to that, E. expressed concern about how Westerners defend queer rights based on the democratic ideal of equality, but then accept the violation of basic human rights under the disguise of queer rights protection. She expressed disgust at how Westerners are so focused on queer liberation, when they keep financing Israel’s oppression of Palestinian people, and thus impeding queer liberation there. In her words, “In the West, queer liberation only came after years of economic and social development, the same type of development that was and is being robbed from Palestinians by colonial forces”.\n\nThe interview with E. reminded us of the words of academic and queer activist Sarah Schullman (2011): “(…) many people have come to mistakenly assess how advanced a country is by how it responds to homosexuality. Yet in a selective democracy like Israel, the inclusion of LGBT Jews in the military, or the relative openness of Tel Aviv, are not accurate measures of broad human rights.”\n\nSee also DSP’s Instagram post about pinkwashing here: https://www.instagram.com/p/C0zWSwRoW3f/?igsh=MWdwZmw3YTlzZHkzYg=="
