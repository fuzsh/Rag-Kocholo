        "text": "CHURCHES are prepared again to offer a cornucopia of sacred music, today through next Sunday.\n\nParish talent is to be augmented with appearances by the Fairfield Chamber Orchestra at St. John's in Stamford, the Colonial Brass Quintet at the United Church in New Haven, the Eastern Brass Quintet at St. Mark's in New Canaan, and the choirs of Penn State University and Lassiter High School from Marietta, Ga., at the First Congregational Church in Greenwich.\n\nAn Easter drama with a script by the Rev. James Marshall and music by David Clydesdale is to be performed at the Black Rock Congregational Church in Fairfield at 3 and 6 P.M. today, with a cast of 80 and a 35-instrument orchestra.\n\nA curiosity about the state of church music led two choral directors to spend sabbaticals gathering material for a book.\n\nOne of the directors, Larry Allen, music director of the Immanuel Congregational Church in Hartford, is touring Europe with Tres Voces, a male vocal ensemble. His colleague, Richard Coffey, director of music at the South Congregational-First Baptist Church in New Britain, has returned home and begun sorting out the data.\n\n''We traveled 40,000 miles visiting churches, chapels, schools and colleges, attending services and rehearsals in about 26 states,'' Mr. Coffey said. ''We found a wealth of good music. Minneapolis is a stronghold, credited to the Lutherans. Other places we were shocked to hear choirs singing to tape recordings.\n\n''Some churches in southern California are fully immersed in easy listening - elevator music converted to church music. Some are very traditional, using the best of the old and the contemporary.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
