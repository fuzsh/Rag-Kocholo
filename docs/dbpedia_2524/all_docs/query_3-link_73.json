        "text": "Historical reviews\n\nArchival documents include raving press commentaries published in Mercure de France which reports: “it would be impossible to imagine more magnificence & more brilliance in the costumes and in the sets”. The diary of Papillon de La Ferté (1727-1794), the administrator of the “Menus Plaisirs du Roi”, the royal household responsible for court ceremonies and entertainments, contains a more nuanced report of the process of producing Rameau’s masterpiece. A manuscript titled Programme de Dardanus Opera representé devant leurs Majestés Le 8 Octobre 1763 à fontainebleau, maybe from his own hand, presents for each act and character, the full list of the sceneries and elements of dress and garments planned. The system of this plan reveals the pragmatic company culture of the Paris Opera at the time. These documents are unvaluable to understand how a performance of an opera by Rameau was conceived and executed during the musician’s period: the constant concern for economy, both in saving and investing, is both humbling and inspiring.\n\nCostumes and sources\n\nThe costumes were designed by the prolific “dessinateur des habits” of the Paris Opera, Louis-René Boquet (1717–1814). Some were made new, but the stock of the “Menus-Plaisirs du Roi” was used extensively. Boquet drew costumes where additional fabrics, mostly drape-garments in striped taffetas, were used to identify the Phrygian people and contrasted colors to characterize the principals. Anna-Kjelldotter, Confidencen Costume designer, investigates Boquet sketches but follows the same process: besides new costumes, various stocks of stage costumes are being reused and repurposed. As we have full descriptions by Boquet of fabrics used and their various colors, reactive to candlelight, choices for Confidencen are made following these guidelines but also must reflect a rigorous dramaturgy which is first built on our reduced groups of singing and dancing characters.\n\nSets\n\nDuring the rehearsals of 1763, the sets were an object of interest and the “amateurs” made visits to the workshops where they judged the scenery to be “very beautiful, especially the one of the Prison”. This set, which is fundamental for the pathos of Dardanus, had to be made anew, as the stock of repertoire decoration of the “Menus Plaisirs” did not have one of this rare kind suitable for the size of Fontainebleau theater. The set for the Paris opera production of 1760, inspired by Piranesi, was still in the memories of the audience but too large for this court theater. Happily, we have some of the designs of Michel-Ange Slodtz (1705–1764), the royal architect, for this new prison set of 1763.\n\nChrister Nilsson, Set master of Confidencen, has been choosing various pieces of scenery in a style close to the ones used in Fontainebleau. Many “changements à vue” of sets and movements of a flying cloud machine are needed for performing Dardanus: the machinery of Confidencen, expertly restored, will be put to good use to balance, with its mechanical motions, the stylized body language of singers and dancers.\n\nWith all these directions and Confidencen in mind, we hope that we can say in 2023, as it was when this Fontainebleau production was revived one more time in 1769, “Dardanus, the easiest and least expensive work to perform, having in stock most of the necessary things, […] was very beautiful by the magnificence of the decorations and the richness of the clothes.”"
