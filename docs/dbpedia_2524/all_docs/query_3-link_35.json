        "text": "Few composers highlight the disparity between French and English taste better than Jean-Philippe Rameau. In France, his operas are performed often at the Paris National Opera and many of the regional opera houses. Alongside Berlioz and Debussy, he is held to be one of that country's great composers, promoted and performed with pride by many of its finest musicians, notably William Christie and Les Arts Florissants. But in England, where we are more focused on performing Handel and Monteverdi, Rameau's operas are rarely seen: the last time a major opera company performed his work in the UK was nearly 15 years ago, when Mark Morris staged Platée at the Royal Opera House.\n\nThe harpsichordist Lina Lalandi did more in the late 70s and early 80s than anyone else to promote Rameau's music and French baroque opera in the UK, but her lavish and historically accurate productions – with original instruments, elaborate costumes, extravagantly plumed headdresses and basic but ornate sets – put forward only one view of how Rameau might be performed.\n\nIf we try to recreate the past, we turn what should be living theatre into a historical curiosity. I often find myself up against a belief that Rameau's operas lack dramatic weight, nuance and potential. Far from being lightweight or frou-frou, Rameau's operas explore dark, mythological themes with sincerity and depth of expression. Even updated \"modern\" productions often highlight the elegance and grandeur of Rameau's dramatic landscape at the expense of his daring and explosive storylines.\n\nMusically, Rameau was a revolutionary. His use of harmony and orchestration was way ahead of its time, and his understanding of the harmonic and sonic possibilities of the orchestra is astounding: in Castor and Pollux there are chords that seem to jump out of the pit and surround you in a glow of pure harmony. I see Rameau as one of the first impressionists, exploring textures and sonorous string sounds that would lead to Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande, and inspire Camille Saint-Saëns to edit his works. Berlioz and D'Indy revered him; Nadia Boulanger taught him to her pupils in Paris.\n\nAnd yet Rameau has always courted controversy. Born in 1683 in Dijon, he was, until the age of 50, best known as a theorist, responsible for codifying harmony in his influential Traité de l'Harmonie of 1722, and for his collections of harpsichord music and cantatas (1728). As an organist, he took over from his father at Nôtre Dame in Dijon, before moving to Paris to establish his name in opera. His first, Hippolyte et Aricie (1733), caused a stir among the Parisian intelligentsia, dividing opinion between conservatives who declared Rameau's music to be difficult and the work of a theorist, and those who embraced his innovations. Among his advocates, André Campra, one of the leading composers of his time, declared: \"There is enough music in this opera to make 10 of them; this man will eclipse us all.\"\n\nMany of Rameau's advances came from adopting fashionable Italian techniques of his day, such as using the full orchestra to accompany sections of recitative. But Rameau took these innovations to new heights, and underpinning his music is a specifically French sensibility. The French were said to speak their operas and sing their plays; in Rameau's day, some of the principal singers in his operas would have been thought of as actors as much as singers. In contrast to the Italian composers, the French would not have used castrati and had little time for divas: opera was more egalitarian, with the music shared more equally between soloists, chorus and orchestra. In Rameau's early operas, such as Les Indes Galantes (1735), and Castor and Pollux, you can already sense a social revolution taking shape. But perhaps most French of all is the way in which Rameau weaves dance and movement into the fabric of his work: more than mere divertissements, they elucidate character and plot.\n\nI first fell in love with Rameau's music as a harpsichordist, discovering Pièces de Clavecins (1741) – a staple of any harpsichordist's repertoire – before conducting Pygmalion (1748) with my ensemble Early Opera Company. I was taken with the expressive nuances of his language, from the devastating sliding harmonies of the Trio of the Fates in Hippolyte – probably his most daring score – to the simpler, more direct style of Castor, which of all his operas has one of the most gripping stories, as well as displaying a new level of clarity in his writing. Both works make huge technical demands on their performers: the vocal ornamentation is more florid than in Italian baroque opera, yet every twiddle and turn relates directly to character and expression. Orchestrally, too, the music is complex and can seem baffling at first, with its quixotic changes of instrumentation, mood and tempo.\n\nNext week's opening of Castor and Pollux at the Coliseum will mark the first time English National Opera has staged a Rameau opera. Director Barrie Kosky and I have chosen to use Rameau's 1754 revised (and shorter) version, but to heighten the drama we've also inserted a few small sections from the original version, such as Phébé's suicide scene. The story begins with a bang: Phébé and her sister, Telaire, are both in love with Castor, but Telaire is betrothed to Castor's twin brother, Pollux. When Pollux realises Telaire and Castor are in love, he relinquishes her and says she should marry Castor instead. But their wedding celebrations are interrupted by an enemy army and Castor is murdered in an attack instigated by the jealous Phébé.\n\nAs with much baroque music, it has become fashionable to perform Rameau on the period instruments he might have used, but things are changing: modern orchestras are embracing the baroque again, armed with the knowledge and experience that specialists in period performance have given them. For Castor and Pollux, we are using baroque flutes (their sound is so different to the modern instrument and key to the opera) and the strings play with baroque bows – shorter and less heavy than the modern bow, they encourage a lighter yet equally robust style of playing. The Coliseum pit has been raised to make a clear connection between players and singers, with the orchestra playing an integral part in the drama, visually and aurally. And, of course, Amanda Holden has newly translated the French into 18th-century English so as to make the story comprehensible. Rameau, the progressive, would be proud."
