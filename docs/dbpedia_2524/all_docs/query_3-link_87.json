        "text": "PARIS — The choreographer Bintou Dembélé was at the Paris Opera one recent afternoon, rehearsing a new production of Rameau’s rarely performed Baroque spectacle “Les Indes Galantes.”\n\nFour vogue dancers had formed a semicircle onstage, each elevated on a gray slab. They had contracted their torsos, rounding their backs while looking away from the audience.\n\nTheir poses seemed passive rather than confrontational, and Ms. Dembélé, 44, a pioneer of French hip-hop dance, suddenly spoke up. “They cannot be in that position while the word ‘slavery’ is being sung,” she said.\n\n“Les Indes Galantes,” which opens on Sept. 26, is among the premier examples of 18th-century “opéra-ballet,” a melding of loosely plotted sung narrative and extravagant dance sequences. At its 1735 premiere, the work was designed to represent the triumph of French Enlightenment order over the “other,” depicting a series of stories of love and virtue set in exotic realms. (“Indes” was, at the time, a term used to describe all non-European locales.) Its score is among Rameau’s most voluptuously colorful and vibrant.\n\nTo audiences today, however, its cast of Turkish, Peruvian, Persian and Native American characters can seem hopelessly hackneyed. And its French-gallantry-conquers-all plot can come across as propaganda for colonialism. (One of the acts is called “The Savages.”)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
