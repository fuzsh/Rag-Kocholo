        "text": "Rameau, the famous baroque music theorist\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau gave great importance to theoretical works. In 1722, he started a revolution in music theory with his Treatise on Harmony, in which he considered music as a science and attempted to derive universal harmonic principles from natural causes. This work became the definitive authority on music theory, forming the foundation for instruction in western music that persists today.\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau, the brilliant composer\n\nWhen he turned fifty, his career as a great composer truly began. Before 1733, Jean-Philippe Rameau had only composed some motets, cantatas and pieces for harpsichord, but his first opera, Hippolytus and Aricia, was soon premiered at the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique. Six years later, he had written four more masterpieces: Les Indes galantes (1735), Castor and Pollux (1737), The Festivities of Hebe and Dardanus (1739).\n\nRameau, the King's musician, source of controversy\n\nIn 1745, Rameau wrote two ballets with Voltaire: The Princess of Navarre and The Temple of Glory. This same year, Jean-Philippe Rameau became King Louis XV's musician, though his music was a source of controversy: a quarrel erupted over Rameau's work which favoured the new Italian style, accused of being dangerous for the traditional French opera."
