        "text": "This week audiences will get a chance to hear a new album by a great tenor and complete operas by Mozart, Donizetti, Moniuszko, and Gluck.\n\nRomances\n\nStar tenor Piotr Beczala presents a selection of romances by Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky, together with the acclaimed accompanist Helmut Deutsch.\n\nIn a statement, Beczala noted, “When I first began to study singing at the Katowice Academy of Music, Poland was still under the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, and we had very limited access to music scores. Russian music however was readily available and very popular in Poland. It was easy and natural therefore that I quickly turned to the romantic songs of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. Many years later when I got to work with celebrated pianist Helmut Deutsch on primarily German Lieder, we discovered that we both have a passion for these Russian songs too. They are not only wonderful to sing but the piano parts are also amazing to perform. This music requires the highest level of communication and concentration between the singer and pianist. We both strongly feel that the work of these two great composers belongs to world culture — they are landmarks in the history of music that belong to all of us and go far beyond national boundaries. In a similar way that Shakespeare and Beethoven belong to the world too.”\n\nFoksongs\n\nDuo Apollon, soprano Anastasia Malliaras, and classical guitarist Aaron Haas perform works by Maurice Ravel, Manuel de Falla, Benjamin Britten, and Mátyás Seiber.\n\nLe Nozze di Figaro\n\nOpus Arte releases the Royal Opera House’s production of Mozart’s masterpiece with Antonio Pappano conducting a cast that includes Riccardo Fassi, Giulia Semenzato, Germán E. Alcántara, and Federica Lombardi. The DVD showcases Sir. David McVicar’s timeless production.\n\nParia\n\nStanisław Moniuszko’s opera in three acts with prologue gets a release by Naxos. The album stars Aleksandra Kiedrowska, Iwona Sobotka, Piotr Friebe, Dominik Sutowicz, Stanisław Kuflyuk, and Rafał Korpik. The Poznań Opera House Orchestra and Chorus is led by Jacek Kaspszyk.\n\nÉcho & Narcisse\n\nGluck’s rarely performed work is set to be released by Chateau de Versailles. The cast includes Adriana González, Cyrille Dubois, Myriam Leblanc, Sahy Ratia, Cécile Achille, Adèle Carlier, Laura Jarrell, and Lucie Edel. Le Concert Spirituel is led by Hervé Niquet.\n\nMon Amant de Saint-Jean\n\n“Mon Amant de Saint-Jean” is the brainchild of lutenist, and founder of the ensemble Le Poème Harmonique, Vincent Dumestre, and French mezzo-soprano Stéphanie d’Oustrac. Fascinated by the interplay of musical echoes from one era to another, they’ve created a program that combines the atmosphere of the chansons of the Années Folles, infused with early music.\n\nSounds and Sweet Airs – A Shakespeare Songbook\n\nCarolyn Sampson and Roderick Williams team up with Joseph Middleton for 37 songs in this recital album written by 27 composers – male, female, English, French, Swiss, German, Romantic, modern and contemporary.\n\nCampra: Messe De Requiem; Mondonville: In Exitu Israël; Rameau: In Convertendo Dominus\n\nLe Concert d’Astrée led by Emmanuelle Haïm perform choral works by three French composers of the 18th century: Rameau, Campra and Mondonville.\n\nLucia di Lammermoor"
