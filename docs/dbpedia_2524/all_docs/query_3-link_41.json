        "text": "Rameau and Pygmalion-Lecture Outline\n\nI. Points of Interest\n\n· Jean Philippe Rameau is considered by many musicologists as the embodiment of High Baroque French musical genius.\n\n· According to Impressionist composer Claude Debussy, Rameau’s music was filled with “delicate and charming tenderness...without that German affectation of profundity, without the need to underline and explain everything.” (In Debussy’s mind, German music seemed too serious, ponderous and overbearing. He was making an oblique reference in this statement.)\n\n· The problem with Debussy’s statement is that the composers who seemed to overshadow Rameau, such as Handel and Bach, were simply stated, less complex, and from an ornamental standpoint, easier on the ear.\n\n· His music is synonymous with the exotic extravagance of the mid-18th Century French Court, like a “Room at Versailles, so encrusted with the ornamental curlicues and flourishes that one would lose sight of what lies underneath.” The plots of most of these operas are equally convoluted.\n\n· However, the audience at Versailles adored him, because his music matched the art and culture of the period.\n\nII. About the Composer: Jean-Philippe Rameau\n\nOverview\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau, born on September 25, 1683, was the leading French composer of his time. He made a tremendous contribution to the field of theory as well as opera, and was an elder to the late Baroque titans G.F. Handel and J.S. Bach. Rameau was a full compositional generation younger than Jean Baptiste Lully, who was considered the progenitor of French Opera. Rameau was frequently compared to Lully. His proponents said that his music was unique and so complex that comparisons to Lully would be absurd. His detractors said that his music was cerebral, unnaturally chromatic and dissonant, and therefore impossible for a listener to digest. Rameau spent his youth honing his skills as the organist at the Lyon and Clermont Cathedrals. In the early 1720s, he moved to Paris. Here, in 1722, he fashioned his Traitè de L’Harmonie (Treatise on Harmony). He then devoted himself to opera, chamber, and keyboard music. He was particularly prolific on the harpsichord and composed over 65 selections for that particular instrument.\n\nBrief Biography\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau was the seventh of eleven children. He was taught music very early on by his organist-father Jean. It is said that he could play beautifully even before he could read the notes on musical manuscripts. Realizing that music patronages were a difficult means to an end, Rameau’s father did not insist on a musical career, thus Rameau initially studied law. But, by the time he turned eighteen, he moved to Milan to perfect his true passion – music. In the year 1726, at 43 years old, Rameau married nineteen year old Marie-Louise Mangot, who was a budding singer and instrumentalist. The couple had four children.\n\nMusical Career\n\nRameau’s passion was to compose operas, thus he worked tirelessly towards becoming proficient in this genre. But there were two opposing sides to the composer. Privately, he was nurturing a massive ambition. He wanted to put music on a completely rational footing, and obsessively authored a comprehensive theoretical treatise, one of many that would keep him endlessly debating with the great thinkers of Europe until his death. He wished to quantify the “nature of the senses through music” in a fashion that could made the listener literally hear a thunderclap, and feel the raindrops on his or her skin. By the time he was 40, he wished to have his Treatise on Harmony published, and for that he had to move to Paris. But there, the allure of the operatic genre began to entrance and electrify him. His first operatic success of note was the incidental music to the 1723 Opéra Comique L’Endriague, conducted by Alexis Piron. Following this success, four more collaborations with Piron ensued. Rameau remained multifaceted and eclectic. Along with opera, he continued to compose motets, and theoretical pieces. Eventually, Piron introduced Rameau to an enthusiastic patron, Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière. By the beginning of the 1730s, Rameau was employed by La Poupelinière, who, at the time, was one of the wealthiest men in France. La Poupelinière’s unquenchable love for music and the arts made him an unflinching patron for new and original artists. This turning point in Rameau’s career allowed him to explore new genres of instrumentation and orchestration. In 1733, at fifty years of age, he staged and performed his first opera, Hippolyte et Aricie, at La Poupelinière’s enormous estate. After this successful debut, the same opera was produced in the Parisian court. Two years later he composed an opera-ballet entitled Les Indes Galantes , “The Cultured Indies”. The term in this case, “Indies” encompassed Turkey, Persia, Peru, and North America, each of which is given its own ballet sequence. Both these pieces, and the numerous other operas and ballets he wrote in later life, demonstrate a vivid and original imagination, coupled with practical experience. Rameau was always seeking out new trends. He introduced the clarinet as a popular instrument, and used his gifts as an orchestrator to create specific moods or scenes. To some, this was proof that the composer could indeed at least come close to quantifying the senses and evoking specifics. One contemporary said “No one knew as well as he how to devise an expressive dance, how to summon up each in their turn a white procession of priestesses, a horde of demons, a tumult of warriors, or the innocent, florid games of shepherds.” The public also debated as whether he would eventually overshadow Lully. One of Rameau’s contemporaries, composer André Campra, said to the Prince de Conti: “There is enough music in Les Indes to make ten operas! This man will eclipse us all.” The extensive ornamentation, the dissonances and the complexity of the accompanied recitatives—sections accompanied primarily by harpsichord and cello alone—mystified and enthralled colleagues and audiences. What KIND of music were they hearing? Rameau wrote of his admiration for Lully in the preface to Les Indes galantes: “I was inspired by the beautiful declamation and handsome turns of phrase in the recitative of the great Lully…I seek to imitate this eloquence, though not as a ‘servile copyist.’” Ultimately, Rameau’s complete comfort with the high Baroque affectations of ornaments, angular melodic lines and oddly-placed dissonances put him in a different realm. This was the Rococo Realm of Louis XV. The apex of Rameau’s compositional glory lasted from 1748, when he wrote Pygmalion through 1754, when he composed La Naissance d’Osiris (The Birth of Osiris) for the birth of the future Louis XVI.\n\nQuerelle des Bouffons\n\nThe Querelle des Bouffons (\"Quarrel of the Buffoons\"), also known as the Guerre des Bouffons (\"War of the Buffoons\") was the name given to a “war” between rival musical and artistic philosophies which took place in Paris between 1752 and 1754. This war was waged by the proponents of French opera and Italian opera. Those who admired Italian opera of the era preferred conservative ornamentation, less ponderous plots, and they were also frankly influenced by the new genre of Opéra buffa (comic opera). Their preference was La Serva Padrona (“The Servant Turned Mistress”) by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, composed in 1733, as an intermezzo and light entertainment piece. Those who admired “traditional” French opera preferred more complex ornamentation, intricate plotlines and tried-and-true character archetypes and stereotypes. If Jean-Philippe Rameau had an Achilles Heel in his later years, that would have been composing “out of step” for a new era in music. By the time he composed his 1763 Abaris ou les Boréades, all of Europe was in the throes of an artistic metamorphosis. The late baroque and rococo period was now giving way to the Empfindsamer Stil (sensitive style) of the early classical period. Indeed, C.P.E. Bach, the son of J.S. Bach, who was already firmly ensconced in this new style, having composed Mit veränderten Reprisen (With Varied Reprises, 1760–1768) for keyboard, was incredibly popular. But most of all, in 1762, the opera Orfeo ed Euridice, by Christoph Willibald Gluck, heralding a new era in the history of opera. Combining the Classical ideals of beauty and simplicity with an innate sense of dramatic impetus, it broke down many of the overwrought formal conventions of the Baroque era, and set entirely different standards for a whole generation of operatic composers. Thus, it can be argued that Rameau was ahead of his time for most of his career, but then his style fell out of favor after the Querelle des Bouffons, so his later years proved less than successful. At the end, Rameaus’s unique voice, like Bach and Handel, gave way to the classical era, and the ideal that “the music serves the text”, not the reverse notion.\n\nIII. Pygmalion Origins and Evolution\n\nSummary\n\nPygmalion is a fifty minute opera with ballet that is presented in one act. It was initially performed on August 27, 1748 at the Opéra in Paris. Ballot de Sauvot, a lifetime admirer and supporter of Rameau was the librettist. Musicologists generally regard Pygmalion as the greatest of Rameau's shorter compositions, and it was rumored that he composed the work in eight days. The story is based on the myth of Pygmalion from Ovid's larger work, Metamorphoses. The sculptor Pygmalion creates a beautiful statue and immediately falls in love with her. His girlfriend Céphise, begs for attention. The clever insertion of the character Céphise as a dramatic foil allows her presence to give passion and fire to the plotline. This, in turn allows the audience to make the comparison between a real person and an idealized creation. Pygmalion spurns Céphise and instead prays to the goddess Venus to bring his statue to life. The prayer is successful. The statue comes to life and begins to sing and dance! Cupid arrives and praises Pygmalion for his artistry and prowess, via Venus. The ever-compassionate Cupid also finds another lover for Céphise! Further celebratory dancing and singing follows, attesting to the power of love.\n\nRoles\n\nPygmalion High tenor\n\nVenus Soprano\n\nCéphise Soprano\n\nLa statue animée Ballerina and soprano\n\nSuccessive Incarnations of Pygmalion Throughout History and Literature\n\nThe Pygmalion story has been re-invented through the centuries. Under the auspices of Handel’s 1718 opera Acis and Galatea, “La statue animée” is the statue-character from which the tale of the sea nymph who falls in love with a shepherd, is born. In a later incarnation, the German writer Goethe calls her Elise, based upon the immortal and mortal variants in the mythological story of Dido-Elissa. A late 19th century version of the “animated statue” concept was the result of Carlo Collodi’s 1883 Pinocchio, in which a wooden puppet is transformed into a \"real boy\", though in this case the puppet has a sense of self-awareness prior to his transformation. In this version, it is Pinocchio and not his creator - Geppetto - who dreams of becoming real, and in a dream, is given life by a benevolent fairy. In George Bernard Shaw's 1916 play Pygmalion, the lower class flower-girl Eliza Doolittle is metaphorically \"brought to life\" by a phonetics professor, Henry Higgins, who teaches her to reinvent herself according to upper-crust English sensibilities. This play, in turn, inspired the musical and film, My Fair Lady. In the musical, a chagrined Professor Higgins, in a sense, becomes the victim of his own creation. Not only does Eliza Doolitle pass herself off as a duchess at an embassy ball, she also becomes weary of the machinations and controlling behaviors of Professor Higgins."
