Late Professor of Music in the Universitij of Oxford VOL. I. ^ifß \"plumerous gCCusfrafions CASSELL AND COMPANY, Limited LONDON, FARIS, NEW YORK d; MELBOURNE ALL RIGHTS KESEBVED PREFACE. The work that is here submitted to the public will no doubt be per- mitted to claim, being the first of its nature, that indulgent judgment usually extended to initial attempts on hitherto untrodden paths. Not- withstanding all the excellent work published within the last few years, on account of the desire of the ever-increasiog number of the serious friends of music for further knowledge of musical history, there was a want felt of a work that would with pictorial aid meet that demand. The aid of illustrations of important musical documents, &c., has therefore been called in to render the comprehension of past periods and the ever- changing position of musical art more clear. To effect such a purpose has been the aim of the present work. Neither trouble nor time has been spared in treating this most extensive subject in such a manner that possible omissions through unsuccessful research into important periods might be avoided. Great energy was required to pursue this path, more especially v/hen, after the appearance of the first number, six years ago, severe trouble, such as might have effectually paralysed all activity, delayed for a time the regular publication. It will not be denied that the work of the general historian is of much greater responsibility than that of the specialist, who has merely to treat of one composer, school, or period, although no one can be more ready than the author to acknowledge the invaluable nature of the results achieved by such specialists as Winterfeld, Dehn, De Coussemaker, Van der Straeten, Otto Jahn, Bellermann, Thayer, Yon Köchel, Nottebohm, and C. Pohl. There were parts in this work in which all the astuteness of the specialist was required to corroborate the evidence of the historian. For Vol. I. iv HiyXORY OF JMUSIC. example, for the first time an uninterrupted continuity has been proved from the twelfth to the fourteenth century of the Old French Tone- School, the masters of which were the first European contrapuntists. These must be accepted as the oldest models of the polyphonic style in the place of those Netherlanders hitherto accredited as such. And thus, while such a profound investigator as Dehn only dared date the origin of double counterpoint from the sixteenth century, it will now be seen that the old French masters employed it as early as the twelfth century, and in a state of such advancement as to be matter for surprise. A special investigation has also been made into the authorship of the well- known hymn \"^ Eine Feste Burg\" (Martin Luther's hymn), and an inquiry into the position in which the Italian masters and the Bohemian Dismas Zelenka stood in influencing the great Sebastian Bach. They will no doubt be admitted to be that great master's influencing precursors. An attempt has been made to prove on historical as well as on sesthetical grounds, that just as the Renaissance was the evolution of the Antique, so the New Romantic is the culmination of the Renaissance of the Romantic School. The success of poj)ularising for the first time the invaluable investigations of De Coussemaker, and of defending the merits of the Netherlaud School, the importance of which during the period of 135U to 1450 has been unjustly and severely attacked, is naturally regarded with satisfaction. Much work of a similar nature has been made popular by other historians, notably by no less a one than A. W. Ambros, whose supercilious critics, in ignoring his great merits, took exception to such anomalies in orthography as are to be found in every tongue. Important as the work of specialists undeniably is, it nevertheless requires the careful comprehension and wide survey of the historian in order to link together their deductions, and so to form a complete and consecutive whole. This has been achieved in the plastic arts and in literature by such as Schnaase, Liibke, Kugler, Gervinus, Vilmar, Hillebrand, and Carriere, whose works have gained as much repute as those of the eminent specialists PREFACE. V Woltmanii;, Grimm, Tausing, Jordan, Lewes, Carljle, Palleske, Delias, Karl \"Witte, &c., to whom we owe biographies of Holbein, Michael Augelo, Albrecht Dürer, Titian, Goethe and Schiller, and commentaries on Shake- speare and Dante. Their labours have met with their merited reward, but it is regretted that such has, generally speaking, been withheld from the musical historian. An attack was made thirty years ago on the assertion that Händel was not only a sacred composer, but was especially the founder of the epic element in music. It is, therefore, very satisfactory to observe the extent to which the truth of that assertion is now generally admitted ; this can also be said of the admission of the proof that the \" invention \" of the opera at Florence was due to a Tuscan School. That adverse criticisms might be made on the literary style of this work was not thought at all improbable, but it will be remem- bered that such have been passed on the style of eminent writers like Winterfeld, Ambros, Hanslick, and Gevaert. Efforts have been made throughout to maintain an even line of argument, and, in fact, rather to praise than to condemn ; but it must be mentioned that this impartiality has received nowhere so little acknowledgment as from the followers of the New Romantic School. The comparative method has been adopted, since it inquires into the laws of organic and formal development, which in art reign completely, and these have been applied strictly to all arguments advanced. This work is intended to meet the wants of that innumerable class of the public desirous of obtaining a general knowledge. If the second part be found too exhaustive, it will be in consequence of its having been written more especially for professors ; but it is to be hoped that it may prove of interest to others also. It is a pleasant duty to tender thanks to those heads of libraries and institutions who have in manifold ways aided necessary investigations by supplying autographs, photographs, documents, &c. To certain profes- sional friends, the Society of the Friends of Music, the Ambros Collection VI HISTORY OF MXTSTC. at Vienna, the Bibliotheca Musica Regia of Dresden, the Royal Dresden Library, the Mozarteum at Salzburg, the Royal Lil^rary and Hohenzollern Museum of Berlin, and the Royal Libraries of Munich and Stutgardt, much acknowledgment is due, as well as to Count Victor von Wimpffen and Hermann Scholtz, for the aid of their invaluable collections. Many important notices have also been furnished by Professor Moritz Fürstenau (of Dresden), Professor Dr. Bellermann (of Berlin), Dr. Jan (of Strasburg), Dr. Wiillner (of Cologne), Ferdinand Hiller, C. Pohl, Professor Dr. E. Hanslick, Dr. Edward Wlassack (of Vienna), Dr. Johannes Brahms, Max Bruch, Niels Gade, and others, to all of whom are tendered sincere thanks for their original contributions. No pains have been spared in making this history as complete as possible by the valuable aid of illustrations of the chief musical instru- ments used from the earliest antiquity, as well as of prints of historical buildings, monuments, engravings, portraits, &c. It has been very gratify- ing to o'bserve the success with which the work has been met. It has been translated into English by the composer Ferdinand Praeger, and edited by the Rev. Sir F. A. Gore Ouseley, Bart., M.A. and Mus. Doc. and Professor of Music in the University of Oxford, and has been published simultaneously in London, Paris, New York, and Melbourne. It has also been translated into Dutch by J. C. Boers, of the Hague. It is only hoped that it may aid in fostering an ever-increasing interest in the most emotional and cherished of all the Arts — Music. EMIL NAUMANN. CONTENTS iook I.

Egyptians and Israelites^ music was closely associated with poetry, the drama, and the dance, although it occupied a position inferior to those arts. The greater or less esteem in which music was held by these nations had an important bearing on their progress or retardation in general civilisation. The more or less remarkable development of the other arts, especially poetry, exercised also an influence as powerful as those of religion, race, natural tendencies, climate, and geographical position. This is exemplified in the great contrasts presented to us by the different ancient civilised peoples of Asia and Euroj^e, in their national existence, their philosophy, and also in their concej^tion of the musical art. Not without reason does Herodotus lay stress on these seemingly irreconcilable contrasts that characterised the general mental life of Asia and Europe j and he even attributes to them all the sanguinary wars that raged, from the Trojan War, surrounded with its halo of myth, down to those which were waged against Persia. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the Greeks adopted Egyptian, Lydian, and Phoenician traditions in their theory of music as well as in their melody and rhythm, and that these traditions had a great influence on their selection and construction of musical instruments. But their innate sense of beauty and proportion saved them, f)U the one hand, fi'om the manifold barbarisms which disfigured the music of the other nations, while, on the other hand, their talent for grasping heterogeneous matter, and reproducing it in a refined and intellectual form, enabled them to mould into a nobler and more complete unity the separately transmitted fragments of the musical culture of other lands. In common with most nations of the pre-classical age, the Greeks were in the habit of making music the subject of speculative philosophy ; but whilst the Orientals lost themselves in mythology, or revelled some- times in strange and voluptuous, sometimes in childish yet ingenious flights of fancy, the Greek mind, seeking in all things for an organic whole, systematised the sensations, ideas, and combinations produced by musical sounds, by subjecting them to a progressive philosophical and mathematical investigation, at once consecutive and exact. The Greeks, as well as the civilised tribes of Asia, evinced a great partialit}^ for speculating on the nature of music, an enjoyment entirely distinct from the pleasures they exjjerieuced through its sensuous charm ; THE CLASSICAL AND PRE-CLASSICAL ERAS. 3 but tliev assigned to it an ethical position, a dig-nity and importance, both in relation to education and the state, as well as a softening influence on the passions that was not dreamt of by the Oriental nations. The Greek tribes of Peloponnesus and Hellas, as well as the Egyptians, Phoenicians, the Greeks inhabiting the isles of the ^-Egean Sea, and especially those of Cyprus, had a primitive \" Lament \" which seems to have come originally from Ph(enicia. It was a funeral chant on the death of the youthful Adonis, who represented symbolically the beautiful but short- lived spring. The Egyptians changed its signification into a lament of Isis for Osiris. The Greeks called it Linos, and the Egyptians Maneros ; but wherever we find it on the eastern shores of the Mediter- ranean it always has the character of a plaintive wail of anguish at the evanescence of all things mortal. We see by this in what inseparable proximity music has, from the first, stood to the contemplation of nature, and to the earliest thoughts and feelings of the human race. For this song, perhaps the oldest of which we have any knowledge, is a dirge for the fast-fleeting spring of youth and beauty — a lament over the frailty of all earthly things ! Thus soon was the key-note sounded of that sorrowful strain which inspired the greatest poet of modern Germany, when he sang — \" ' But why am I transient, 0 Zeus ? ' Beauty asked. ' To fade I made Beauty,' stern Jupiter said ; And youth, flowers, dewdrops, all heard his sad words. And weeping they turned them away from his throne.\" From the earliest times of which we have any record, music has lent its voice to grief as well as to joy; and if no art was more capable of giving expression to the earliest accents of sorrow, none was more suited to afford consolation and hope to the broken-hearted. Thus music by its magic healed the wounds which it had itself inflicted ; but whether its lyre was attuned to joy or to sorrow, it consecrated both by elevating them above terrestrial darkness into the purer atmosphere of sublime art ; and in this respect the earliest and latest musical utterances display the most striking affinity. For the folk-songs of the most ancient nations, those which were sung beside the cradle of humanity, equally with those of our own time, are, like the immortal creations of the tone-poets of the last four centuries, one and all, mirrors of most purely unaffected and B 2 i HISTORY OF MUSIC. heartfelt sentiment. Indeed, this natural utterance came much more unwitting-ly in the early and middle ag-es than in the present, but a large part of this ingenuousness descended to the great masters of the classical epoch. Hence it arises that it is precisely in the periods either of an imperfect development of the art or of its super-refinement that we meet with musical monstrosities and degeneracy, with over-elaboration, sentimentality, exaggerated expression, coquetry, voluptuousness, falsehood, diffuseness, and an artificial striving after effect. However, the greater part of this primordial ingenuousness, which betokened the sweet innocence of bewitching childhood, was destined to disappear again until the day should come when the first faltering accents of music should be transformed into a genuine tone-language. When this moment arrived, and the contemplation of music assumed a more intellectual character, then, in her endeavours to attain the ideal, she was launched on a boundless sea of trouble and obscurity. How could it be otherwise ? For every awakening from dreams of innocence and childhood is just like the expulsion from Paradise enacted anew; the plucking of the fruit from the tree of musical knowledge could only be atoned for by the sweat of the brow. To reach the coveted goal, the first pioneers in the field of music had to grope their way through tortuous and thorny paths ; and to follow them therefore in their search after light and truth furnishes us with an interesting historical retrospect. If, in the different stages of its course, which are marked by the long epochs of its warfare with besetting difläculties, music, the perfectly natural art, often returns very near to its starting-point of simplicity and unaffected expression, it takes nevertheless a place as high above its origin as the features of a ]\\Iadonna by Raphael surpass those of a handsome peasant- girl. This is the relation in which the music of the ancients — many of whose immortal folk-songs are still extant — stands to the compositions of such composers as Bach, Gluck, Mozart, or Beethoven. Even the happiest attempts of the ancients — outpourings of their deepest sensations and feelings — are but the germs and foreshadowings of a higher subsequent development. The perfectly-matured art unfolds her wondrous wings, and, transcending expectation, soars above the most daring flights of fancy in the jiursuit of her noble ideal. THE MUSIC OF THE ANCIENT ORIENTAL NATIONS. F we wish to g-aiu a clear idea of the position m the history of music of the people who inhabited the eastern and southern parts of Asia, those of the south-west countries, generally classed together under the name of the Orient, the inhabitants of the Upper and Lower ^^alleys of the Nile — in fact, of all the civilised nations of the eastern half of the old world — we must divide them into four groups. From this point of view we shall arrange together for purposes of examination the Chinese, Japanese, and Hindoos ; classing together in the same way the Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Western Asiatics. In the same way, the followers of Islam, although comprising many nations and distinct races, should, with reference to their musical achieve- ments, be grouped under one head. This applies still more especially to the Israelites, w^ho, arrogating to themselves the title of the \"chosen, people,'^ certainly merit that appellation in the musical art of the pre- classical age. The Chinese, Japanese, and Hindoos may be treated of in one and the same chapter; first, because they are neighbours geographically, and secondly, because they are alike in that their music had no influence over the tonal art of the people of Europe. The still closer relation which existed amongst themselves will be left, however, for further investigation. The second group of nations — viz., the Egyj^tians, Ethiopians, and Israelites — are closely connected by their geographical position, and in 6 HISTORY OF MUSIC. addition to this have a common descent and lang-uag-e ; they are either Semites, or have Semitic elements in their civilisation. But this im- portant link is wanting in the former group, since the Chinese, being descendants of the Mongols, and the Hindoos of the Aryans, differ widely both in descent and disposition. We have devoted an entire separate chapter to so comparatively small a people as the Hebrews, whilst compressing into the same space the history of the Chinese and Hindoos — who, without the Japanese, comprise more than half the inhabitants of the whole world — because, as already explained, the wonderfully high endowments of the former have obtained for them the first place amongst Orientals. It should further be mentioned that there existed a peculiar and intimate connection between the music and religious poetry of the Israelites ; and lastly, that Palestine became the garden of the Lord, from whose soil was to spring forth and bloom the flower of Christianity — in other words, that religion by means of which music was to be elevated into a self -existing art. It may appear incongruous to include in this section the Mohammedans with the nations of the pre-classical age. It is, however, an ascertained fact, that typical Arabian music, and even many Arabian instruments, belong to a period anterior to the Mohammedan era; and, moreover, were we not to refer to them here, some difficulty and confusion might be experienced in returning to them when tracmg the history of the music of the Western nations. For a similar reason Kugler, Lübke, and other eminent writers interpolated Mohammedan art between classical art and that of Western Christianity ; or between the oldest Christian plastic art of Byzantium and Rome, and that of the Middle Ages, because ancient traditions exerted so great an influence on Byzantine architecture, sculpture, and painting, and on early Christian art, that at the time of Rome's decadence they could not be said to have as yet attained to that individuality of style which characterises the art of the later Middle Ages. The musical historian has to deal with a somewhat different state of circumstances. Although Christian music was trammelled by ancient tradition for several centuries, yet it was not so heavily Aveighted as were the arts of painting and sculpture of that time. Christianity and music had, from the commencement, so great an attraction for each other, that they literally coalesced by spontaneous approximation. For this reason we CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 7 have not wished to separate the early history of Christian music frora its develo])ment, and therefore have preferred to speak of that of the Islamites here. Thus the history of the tonal art shows that already* in its earliest beginnings, it was the most Christian of all the arts. This is proved by the fact that almost all music of Paganism can, from an historic point of view, be divided into separate groups, according to the impress of nationality borne by their tonal art. With the Christians, however, no such division was ever possible, as all Christian nations, from the moment that music came in contact with Christianity, have collectively contributed to the development of music Ü1 the same direction without reference to nationality. CHAPTER I. THE CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. In this chapter are included three nations, the Chinese, Japanese, and Hindoos, for though differing widely in race and temperament, they were, nevertheless, allied by the proximity of their geographical position, as well as by a certain mental resemblance. The spreading of Buddhism from India to China and Japan, the division into castes, and the tenacity with which the three nations clung to ancient customs during thousands of years, without change or progress, are all of importance in tracing their musical history. To these causes, together with an enervating climate and impei-fect political institutions, may be ascribed the origin and growth of Fatalism in Japan, and Quietism in India and China. Apart from the similarity of their mental life just indicated, these nations present to us, in other respects, the most striking contrasts. This is not perhaps due so much to dissimilarity of race and the vast territories over which these races extended, within which one might find every variety of character, as to the difference of disposition which led these nations to regard the world from divergent standpoints. Whilst the Hindoos possess a lively imagination, the Chinese exhibit in its stead a circumscribed but practical worldliness. The former^s conception of the world is poetical and ecstatic ; the latter^s, insipid and prosaic, with a puerile and pedantic trait ninning throughout. Whereas Chinese art is 8 HISTORY UF MUSIC. sujDerficial; that of the Hindoo^ on the contrary; attempts to be profound, to fathom the connection between mind and matter^ uniting therewith a predilection for the transeendentalj the fantastic, and the mysterious. Nothing can more forcibly demonstrate to us how intimatelj^ the growth of nu^sic is associated with the development of sj)ecial characteristics and civilisation among nations,, than the almost opposite method adopted by the Hindoos and Chinese, both in their treatment of musical theory, and in the manufacture of musical instruments. An investigation of the peculiar characteristics of the above-named nations, as reflected in their musical conceptions and in their systems, will astonish those who have not fathomed the profound connection that exists between civilisation and art. In turning our attention first of all to the Chinese, we find that the origin of music with them, as with all other nations, is in close affinity with that of their religion. The Chinese builds his world upon the harmonious action of the heavens and earth ; regards the animation of all nature, the movement of the stars and the change of seasons, as a grand \" world- music,^' in which everything keeps steadfastly in its appointed course, teaching mankind thereby a wholesome lesson. One of the founders of their religion, Fo-Hi, is believed to have been the inventor of the Kin, a stringed instrument still in use in China. The close relationship that originally existed between the constitution of the state and music is also clearly sho\\^^l in Chinese history. All their music has from time immemorial been under state supervision^ in order to guard against the stealthy introduction of any tone contrary to ordinance. Here we already meet with the pernicious influence of a bureau- cratic pedantic state, as well as that of the prosaic character of the Chinese, upon their music. Both features are exemplified in the names of the notes of their oldest musical scale, which consisted only of five tones, from F to D, omitting the B. No. 1. i ^JT-P^ The lowest note of this scale, F, was called \"emperor;^' the Gj \"prime minister/-' A, \" loyal subjects ; '^ C, \"aftairsof state;\"'' and the D^ \"^^ mirror CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 9 of the world /^ A people in whose tales and novels the climax culminates in the success or failure of the hero's state-examination could not but possess very feeble notions of the tonal art. The emperors did not disdain to bring\" themselves into close communication with musical institutions. In the year 364 a.d., Ngai-Ti published a decree against weak^ effeminate music; and Kang-Hi, 1680 a.D., invented with success some new melodies, and founded an Academy of Music. We will now endeavour to describe Chinese music by noticing some of its prominent features. Among the Chinese the art of music has ever remained an object either of diversion or of speculation. It has never revealed to them the language of the heart and intellect. Nevertheless they draw a distinction between sound and noise. The j^eriod at which their five- toned scale was enlarged to seven tones has been described by Chinese theorists as the commencement of the decadence of their musical system. They ascribe to their mythical bird \" Fung-Hoang/^ and his mate, the invention of tones and half-tones ; the six whole tones to the male, and the half-tones to the female. Such a creed coincides with all their notions of man and woman. The whole tones represented to them things perfect and independent — as heaven, sun, and man ; the half-tones, things imperfect and dependent — as earth, moon, and woman. The enlargement of the scale from five to seven tones was owing to the insertion of the two half-tones E and B, which were called \" leaders \" and \" mediators.'^ These appellations proceed from a very fine musical instinct, as indeed E and B are \" leaders \" to F and C, and they possess also, for the modern cultivated ear, the quality of resolving themselves into the half- tone above, acting at the same time as mediators, and filling up the void between D and F — A and C. No. 2. NB NB i f After the completion of the octave the intermediate half-tones were added, viz., sharps to F, G, A, C, and D ; dividing the Chinese scale, like our modern chromatic scale, into twelve semitones within the octave. From 10 HISTOEY OF Mil SIC. this time the scale received the name of Lue — i.e., Law ; but ohey clung to F as the root of all tones. It is characteristic of the Chinese, who generally regard things from an opposite point of view to other nations, that in music they call low what we call high, and vice versa — e.g., the E of scale No. 2 would be to them the lowest, and the F at the beginning of the scale the highest tone. In their theory of harmony there is a foreshadowing of the relation of the tonic to its fourth and fifth, but they did not perceive the full imjDortance of these intervals as upper and lower dominants of the tonic, although in their circles of fourths and fifths they always returned to F, their starting-point. Their theories are based upon an infinite variety of rules, and exhibit a timorous mental hair-splitting which has completely fettei'ed all artistic imagination. Here, too, the pedantic mind of the Chinese makes itself manifest, for, though possessing a strong power of discrimination, yet it lacks all imagination. It masters up to a certain point all knowledge that can be acquired by industry and observation. Beyond this, however, even in an art like music, its barren, theorising character makes itself felt. To suit its exigencies, tone too must do didactic duty, operating not upon the emotions but upon the intellect. The most interesting part of Chinese theory is its ingenious combination of tone with nature, men, and things, to which we have already referred. The Chinese are the only peojile who, thousands of years ago, possessed a system of octaves, a circle of fifths, and a normal tone. With this knowledge, however, their eighty-four scales, each of which has a special philosophical signification, appear all the more incomprehensible to us. Hence the conclusion gains cogency, that notwithstanding the early de- velopment of their theory, they never used tone to express feelings. The oldest known Chinese book on music dates from the eleventh century before Christ. Five hundred years before our Christian era, a friend of Con- fucius, the great moral teacher of the Chinese, wrote a musical commentary, the great teacher himself writing a song-book, which Rückert, a celebrated German poet, translated in 1833 a.d. All these songs were intended to be set to music, and are for the most part of a didactic character. Amiot, the French Jesuit and missionary in Pekin, mentions in his work on Chinese music, published in Paris, 1776 a.D., no less than sixty-nine theoretical works. From a great number of these it appears that the Chinese care less CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 11 for combinations than for single sounds. This reminds one of their habit of splitting up their own language into monosyllables. Everywhere they exhibit a child-like tendency to unite single sounds, without the slightest desire for a higher ideal combination. Their melodies have thus the character of an aimless wandering amongst sounds. They lack form, out- line, and intrinsic merit. The best of them, relatively speaking, are to be found amongst the oldest sacred music and the songs of the people — the sailors and mountaineers; the worst, in their theatre^ (sing-song) music, both vocal and instrumental, the melodies having no form whatever. The sacred hymns, and the songs of the people^, have been transmitted unaltered, from time immemorial.

Very peculiar is another melody, noted by Barrow, and with but slight variation by Amiot, which CM. von .Weber has made use of in his overture to Turandot. The designed omission of the half-tones E and B testifies to its great antiquity. No. 4.

The accompaniment of their songs consists sometimes of a pedal bass — ■ for higher tones in the fifth, and for lower tones in the fourth — a most primitive method, reminding one of the bag-pipes, and of the earliest attempts of untutored nations. Nevertheless, the Chinese believe their music to be the best in the Avorld. European music they consider to be barbaric and horrible. They possess a certain rude notion of rhythm ; but most of the melodies with which we are acquainted show that they prefer the even to the uneven measure. Their sense for uncouth rhythm may perhaps CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 13 partly explain their predilection for instruments of percussion^ a preference for which is always indicative of a low musical organisation^ whilst a love for stringed instruments evinces a higher order of mind They have numerous instruments of percussion^ large and small kettle- drums— indeed, drums of every kind — instruments made of stones or metal bells, suspended in wooden frames and beaten with a mallet ; cymbals ; suspended rows of tuned cop- per plates; various kinds of tinkling instruments ; wooden clappers ; and wooden tubs beaten either from the inside or outside. The most interest- ing of these instruments is the King, invented by the Em- peror Tschun and the Chinese Orpheus Quel, which is said to have existed as far back as 2,300 B.c. It consists of sixteen dif- ferent-sized stones, suspended in two rows, and tuned according to the twelve tones of the Lne octave, and their four additional tones. It is struck with a wooden mallet. The most sonorous of these stones come from the province of Leang-tscheu ; they are called Yu. A richly-orna- mented mstrument made out of these stones, called Nio-King, may only be played by the Emperor. The above illustration represents a King of the more ordinary construction, others being made after this jiattern. To the family of the King belongs the Pien-tschiing, an instrument consisting of many bells, arranged and timed in a similar manner to the stones of the King; also the Yueji-lo, consisting of a fi-ame in which are suspended ten tuned copper plates. r,. _ Tj. ^, ,, ,,. , They have, also, a giant drum, called the rig. ,. — Hiuen-Kon. the LTiant j ^ ^ » j Drum of the Chinese.

The size of this colossal drum is at once seen on comparing- the height of the performer in our illustration with that of the instrument. It is placed on a specially-prepared stand . it oscillates, and has two smaller drums, one on eacli side. The Chinese ear finds a special charm in the contrast of the deep-booming thunder of the large drum and the mere rattling of the two small drumS; a charm for which our European ears are possibly being prepared, should the increase of instruments of per- cussion in the modern orchestra continue at the same rate as heretofore. Amongst the drums we find the Fa-Ko/f most generally used. It has the form of a small tub, is attached to the body by a cord, and does not give a very loud tone. We must also mention the Tchoang-Ton, a fan-like looking instru- ment, made of pieces of wood tied together, which served in ancient times Fig. 8.— Ya-K.ui, thr Small Chinese Drum. -Gong, or Tamtam, from the Palace of the Chinese Emperors.

CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 15 The Chinese wind instruments are fewer in number than those of percussion. The oldest of these^ the Hiuen, is in the shape of an eg-g\". It is made of earthenware, open on one side, with five ventag-es, which p-ive the five tones of the oldest Chinese scale. Speaking- rela- tively, the most elaborate of Chinese wind instruments is the Cheng. It is the most pleasing- of their instru- ments, and serves as a standard to tune other instruments. It has for its basis a hollowed-out pumpkin, which serves the purpose of a wind receptacle, in which are twelve to twenty-four bamboo reeds, placed closely tog-ether in a circle. The performer blows into the curved cylinder, open- ing and closing the ventages with his fingers. Among their instruments of the flute type, mention should be made of the Yo, which is played from the top like the clarinet ; and the Tsche, played like the modern flute. They also possess the pan-pipes called Siao. Their martial instruments include various trumpets with funnel or knob-shaped bells. Their orchestra is but sparsely recruited with stringed instruments of their own invention, for the mandolines and guitars which Eig. n . —The Cheng, they use are more probably of Persian or Hindoo than of Chinese origin. The only Chinese stringed instruments are the Kin and Che- — the former, a very primitive guitar, of a pear-shape, usually strung with four strings, and having inside it some metallic bells which make a clanging accompaniment to the sound of its strings ; while the Che, literally translated ''^the wonderful/^ is a table-psaltery, nine feet in length, containing twenty-five strings. Both are evidently of great antiquity, and are said to have been invented by Fo-Hi, but musically the Che is the more important. In Fig. 12 we have placed beside the performer on the Che the player of the small drum, called the Po-fou, because these instruments are never separated, but appear always together as accompaniments for vocal music. This observation applies especially to the accompaniment cf ancient songs and hymns. The Che strengthens the melody and supports the voice of the singer, the Po-fou regulating the rhvthm and gesticulation. We or Tscheng, of the Chinese. 16 HI.STOEY OF MUSIC. have represented both performers as blind, for Amiot tells us that all ancient tradition described musicians as blind. The intellectual Chinese Prince Tsay-vu finds a reason for this remarkable tradition in the following fact : — • \"The ancient musicians/'' he relates, \"closed their eyes whilst performing, so that no external object should engage their attention, and it is from this habit that the people gave them the name of the blind/\" This tradition has a deeper meaning than that attached to it b}^ the Chinese, inasmuch that any enthusiastic listener to music appears entranced and absorbed in inward contemplation, all his mental faculties being lost Fi\"-. 12. — Blind Performers on the Che and Po-fou. in the depths of his own heart and mnid. But however little such a poetical metaphor can be applied to the real musical performance of a people whose practice in the tonal art has remained in a semi-barbaric state, it is nevertheless true that their musical traditions and theories abound in highly ingenious ideas. It must be acknowledged that this theory of the Chinese is the true interpretation of the nature of music, but it is a theory which is far in advance of their practice. The following illustration (Fig. 13) is an exact copy of an entire Chinese orchestra, stiictly historical and national. It repi'csents the musicians arranged for the performance of a requiem in honour of their ancestors in the Tay-miao. In the background, towards the south, in front of the portraits of the ancestors, stands th,e table of perfumes ; on it is placed lighted candles, flowers, and scent. To the right, towards the CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 17 west, are the bell and time-beaters, pan-pipe and Cheng players ; to the left, towards the east, are the players on the kettle-drum, rattle-drum (Tao-kou), and the flute-players. Most important for a more detailed investigation of Chinese music are the works (as yet only partly published) of Gladisch, a German savant who died a few years ago. It seems almost beyond doubt that he has succeeded in pointing out the undeniable and intimate connection that exists between the oldest Chinese theory and the musico-philosophic conceptions of the great Greek teacher Pythagoras — Fig. 13. — Chinese Orchestra in the Tay-miao. a connection proved by the perfect similarity of their systems of vibi-ations and intervals. If, indeed, Gladisch^s own discoveries in this direction induced him to complain of our want of appreciatiim of Chinese music, he was in this respect not unlike Amiot, Barrow, and others, whom the surprisingly jirofound combinations of the Chinese system deluded into a belief that their practice was as perfect as their theory. The Japanese are the nearest neighbours of the Chinese, and they are also related by blood to them. They are descended from the Chinese and the Ainos, a nation still inhabiting the most northern part of Japan, the Kurile Isles, and the southern part of Kamschatka. The Japanese, waging war against the element that surrounded them^ and forced to subdue the original c 18 HISTORY OF MUSIC. inhabitants, the Ainos, have become a more energetic and active people than the Chinese, their forefathers. In music, however, they have in nowise surpassed the Chinese standard, but have, on the contrary, rather remained below it. They revere music, and connect it with their idol- worship, but, judged from an artistic point, it is inferior to Chinese music. We also find the music of the Japanese in strange association with their dijjlomacy. It is said that formerly an ambassador in addressing a foreign court to which he was accredited did not speak, but sang his mission. \"Diplomatic notes,^^ therefore, acquired in Japan a double signification, and there first earned an undoubted right to their present appellation ; we may not, however, venture to assume that a chanted ultimatum sounded altogether like a congratulation. The descent of Japanese music from Chinese shows itself in their instruments. They have the Kin and the Tsclieng (Fig. 11) in common. Peculiar to the Japanese is the Ohoe, a strong shrill-sounding instrument made of sea-shell, to which is affixed a tube for a mouth -piece. This instrument is used in the j^lace of a trum])et. They possess many stringed instruments, some of them like our European mandolins and lutes ; one of the latter, Samise, is a cube- shaped resonant frame, and is struck with a plectrum. Like the Chinese, their barbarism in music shows itself in the number of drums, clappers, and bells. They have a drum in the shape of an hour-glass, which is struck at both ends ; also cylindrical drums, and many bell instruments shaken by the hand, which are like our chiklren^s rattles. Siebold, in his work on Japan, gives us an illustration of a whole Japanese orchestra. It consists of three men and four women, who perform on a horizontal flute, a large hour-glass-shaped drum, two bell-rattle instru- ments, two wooden clappers, and two small drums. This j)icture, taken from life, exhibits no less than six barbaric instruments of percussion ranged against a single flute, that has alone to support the melody. The co-operation of women is not only admitted in the performance of their secular but also in that of their sacred music. The social position of the musician is not specially respected, his status being no higher than that immediately above the lowest class. Passing from the Chinese and Japanese to the Hindoos, we feel ourselves in a new mental sphere, with an entirely diiferent conception of life, the character and mode of which has but very little in common with CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 19 the nations of whom we have spoken. The Hindoos, like the Chinese, connect the origin of tlieir music with their religion ; but whilst the Chinese do not trace its source further back than to the mythical bird Tung-Hoang, the Chinese hero the semi-mythical Fo-hi, and the pillar of their state- religion — Confucius ; the Hindoos, on the contrary, derive their music direct from their gods. This can scarcely surprise us if we cast a glance at the country which they inhabit. Under a fierce, glaring sun, in a climate which generates the wonderful animal and vegetable kingdoms of the tropics, lies an immense peninsula, sheltered by gigantic mountains, stretching southwards far out into the ocean, taper-like, and forming an almost isolated world of its own. The mighty rivers rising in the snow-capped Himalayas temper by their rushing waters the consuming heat of the near equator, and disseminate around a refreshing coolness, and an existence full of youthful activity. Hence the Hindoos venerate rivers like the Ganges, just as they do those moun- tains from whose valleys they take their source, and hold them sacred. Yet the power of the equator is so great that the people of Southern India cannot work like those of the north, but easily succumb to the influence of the enervating climate, which invites to rest, contemplation, day-dreaming, and a luxurious play of imagination. Besides, as such tendencies had already in ancient times exhibited themselves in the disposition of the Hindoo, before he emigrated from Thibet to the south, it was only natural that the character of the newly-adopted country should still further increase them. Without taking into account the totally different characteristics of these nations, it at once becomes manifest that music among such a people, and under such a sky, would occupy a totally different position from that of the Chinese and Japanese — inhabitants of a more northern clime. If the development of m.usic amongst the dull, j^rosaic, and grotesque Chinese was beset with difficulties, it found, on the other hand, among the Hindoos, in the country of the lotus-flower and gazelle, and under the narcotic influence of tropical foliage, a thoroughly congenial soil, and one in every respect favourable for striking root. By the Hindoo, therefore, music is regarded as an immediate gift from the gods. The consort of Brahma, the benevolent and kind Sarasvati, gave the Vina, the most charming of all instruments, to mankind. Sarasvati was the generally- c 2 20 HISTORY OF MUSIC. accepted guardian of music, but the one whose special office it was to preside over the art was Nareda. The following illustration (Fig. 14), which has reference to a part of the poem \"M.a.gha/' is taken from a work by Sir William Jones. \" Nareda once sat at his Vina, wrapped in deep contempla- tion, when suddenly the gently-moving zephyrs drew forth from the strings sounds that enchanted his ear, and which, proceeding in regular rhythm, varied continually, becoming at each change still more and more beautiful. ^^ In the E/igveda, one of the four primordial books of the Brahmins, written in Sanskrit, and known under the name of the \" Vedas,'' there are hymns intended for music. The existence of these books is supposed to date from the year 1500 b.c. The Brahmins gave to the musically-gifted Hindoos a number of sacred songs, closely connected with their worship, the composition of which they traced to the most remote antiquity, and frequently ascribed to gods. Such melodies, \" Ragas,^^ were supposed to be capable of miraculous effects. Some forced men, animals, and even inanimate nature, to move according to the will of the singer ; others could not l)e executed by any mortal man without the risk of being consumed by flames. The singer Naik-Gobaul, who tried to sing a forbidden \" Raga,^^ was, notwithstanding that he stood up to his neck in the river Jumna, consumed by fire. To another melody was attributed the power of calling down rain ; a female singer saved Bengal by this \" Raga \" from drought and famine. A third melody obscured the sun, and enveloped the sovereign's palace in terror-striking darkness. The Hindoos, believing in the supernatural effects of music as well as that the sound was agreeable to the gods, surrounded their heaven-god, Indra, with hosts of performing genii called \" Gandharven,'' and with female dancers and performers called \" Apsarasen.\" The story of the Gandharven and Apsarasen in Hindoo mythology is Fig. 14. — Nareda, the LJud of Hindoo Music. CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 31 told in the following manner. Brahma, according to tradition, broke by the power of his thoughts the shell of the Brahma egg;, in which he had been confined for three thousand billion and four hundred years, into two halves. Out of these, heaven and earth were fashioned. He then created man, who called forth from chaos ten \" heavenly sages.'^ The sages again j^eopled heaven and earth with good and bad spirits, and created the Gaudharven and AjDsarasen. The special mission of the \" lotus-eyed \" Apsarasen was to test by alluring song and luxurious enchantment the sincerity of the pious hermit, who had retired into seclusion to lead a godly life. If, however, these heavenly dancers exceeded their mission, and caused a holy man to break his vow, they were visited with the anger of the gods. Such was the case with the beautiful Apsarase Rambha, who was punished by being turned into stone. Lastly, the Apsarasen, conjointly with the Gandharven, were also appointed to enliven the feasts of the gods with song and dance. The oldest of the Hindoo scales corresponds exactly with that of the five-toned Chinese scale — another proof of the close relationship which, in primordial times, must have existed between the two nations. It is not improbable that this scale was made up of the tones F, G, A, C, D, which, like the Chinese scale, laclved the B, the first scale \" Velavali \" (also Velavi) consisting of the above-named progression. In India, as in China, this scale was in course of time inci-eased to seven tones, the Hindoo scale corresponding to our scale of A major, the abbreviations of their signs being Sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni. These seven tones were repeated three times, and thus by taking the octave system as a foundation, a scale of twenty-one tones was obtained. But the Hindoos, especially in their theory, did not stop short here. According to their system, distinction was made between large and small whole-tones as well as half-tones; and again, every large whole-tone was divided into four quarters, every small whole-tone into three-thirds, and ever}^ half-tone into two quarter-tones, so that the octave, called \" Struti,^' contained twenty-two of these divisions. It becomes at once apparent that these \" Strutis •\" could not be employed either by vocalist or instru- mentalist, because, if we wished to divide our scale into quarter-tones, it would give us twenty-four sounds, whilst the Hindoos, having but twenty- HISTOKY OF MUSIC. two equal divisions, constructed a scale whichj if not mathematically, is musically quite an impossibility. The extreme vagueness of the Hindoo theory is seen in the immense number of their keys, and their diverg-ent systems. This anomalous state of things proceeds more especially from their having almost entirely ignored the mathematical and physical part of musical theoiy. In the time of their god Krishna they asserted the existence of 16,000 keys. Monstrous as this may seem, when judged from a practical standpoint, the explanation by which they justify this enormous number is not altogether devoid of the charm of poetical imagery. The story runs, that at the time when the beautiful young god Krishna lived on earth as a shepherd, all the Maduric shepherdesses and nymphs, called \"Gopis/' of whom there existed 16,000, endeavoured to gain the love of the divine youth. In this contest everyone of the Gopis invented a new key, hoping by its novel and peculiar construction, and consequent original melody, to move the young god's heart more powerfully than her sister's. Sir William Jones, in 1789, introduced into England from India a number of small and prettily- painted pictures, called \" Ragmalas,'^ representing with child-like simplicity the meeting of Krishna and the Gopis, likewise these lovely nymphs rehearsing their songs on the Yina, in private, in order hereafter to charm their god. The illustration (Fig. 15), taken from the work of Sir William Jones, represents a Gopi, who, by her performance on the Vina, has attracted a number of gazelles, that frolic and gambol around her. At a later period these 16,000 keys were reduced to 960, then to thirty-six, and lastly to twenty-three. But in most of the Indian provinces the thirty-six keys mentioned in the holy books Soma and Narayan have Fig. 15. — A Gopi attracting Gazelles by her Vina playing. CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 2'6 been retained. The ovig-in of these thirty-six keys is attributed in Hindoo theogony to Maheda-Krishna, who brought forth from his five heads five keys, named \" Raga/^ to which his consort Parbuti added the sixth. In addition to these, Brahma himself created thirty subsidiary keys called \" Raginit.'^ We give here from the book Soma a few of these thirty-six keys, the more clearly to illustrate the extraordinary omissions in their scales.

Amongst the thirty-six keys of the book Soma we meet with eight incomplete scales, seven of these being without the B. In the book Narayan, on Ihe contrary, there are eleven of these incomplete scales, which, according to our modern notions, 24 HISTORY OF MUSIC. are imperfect. But also in these last the B appears to have been studiously avoided^ as it is wanting in no less than eight o£ them ; this peculiar con- struction undoubtedly being that of the oldest Hindoo scale. In this omission of the B we trace a highly-interesting connection between the scales of the Hii>doos and those of the ancient Greeks — a connection similar to that previously pointed out as existing between those of the Hindoos and the Chinese — the Greek scale of Terpander^ according to the notation of Nicomachus, also having no B. Another division, differing from that found in the books Soma and Narayan, is that of Killinatha, who reckons 90 scales; Terat, on the other hand, fixes them at 132. Often when referring to a key, a special melody only is understood. Consequently in the Hindoo theory of music we meet with almost the same extravagance, the same want of decided outline, and likewise a corresponding tendency to multij^ly and exaggerate everything, as is displayed in their sculpture, with its huge unnatural figures, and its many-headed gods, possessing an unlimited supply of arms and legs. In the Sanskrit literature a great number of theoretical works on music have such fanciful names as \" the mirror of scales/' \" the mirror of melodies,^' 'Hhe sea of emotions,^' '^the delights of society/'' \"the science of scales,'^ &c. The sacred book Narayan even speaks of a theory of music in verse, a fact which might well be relied on as showing the fanciful Hindoo's j)redilection for clothing in flowery language the most abstract notions. The Nai'ayan treats first of song, then of stringed instruments, and lastly of the ballet. The union of these arts is called \" Sangita.'' It should be mentioned that the six principal keys of the thirty-six referred to in the Soma and Narayan bear the names of Indian provinces, and each of the separate tones the name of a nymph. The ever-varying metre which characterises Hindoo poetry, arising chiefly from the excitable and ecstatic nature of the race, has left its indelible impress on the rhythm of their music. In some instances, every beat of the bar was required to be performed strictly in time — in fact, just as at the present day ; whereas, in others the duration of such divisions was left to the individual taste of the singer. In the songs known to us the rhythm is very difficult to understand, and can only be approxi- mately rendered by our modern system of notation. The English writer Bird says, in reference to such songs, \"that many of these Baginis were CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 25 SO entirely without rliythmieal symmetry, that it would be almost impossible to reproduce them in the same form as they were executed by the Hindoo singers; they seem like the outpourings of exalted beings, who wed to words such sounds as their emotion or fancy suggests/' Even in musical rhythm the symbolising spirit of the Hindoo exhibits its effeminate predilection for ornamentation, the picture of a lotus-flower indicating the conclusion of each musical j^eriod. Scientific research has not yet been able to ascertain whether the present music of the Hindoos bears anything more than the remotest resemblance to that of the ancients. Their oldest songs are to be found in the \" Vedas.\" The sacred songs contained in these holy books were saved from destruction by their being written in verse, committed to memory, and chanted — a custom common to the civilised nations of antiquity. All scientific efforts to trace these melodies have proved fruitless. We are indebted to the German savants, Theodor Benfey and Max Müller, for what little light has been thrown on the supposed connection between the rhythm of these hymns and the music to which they were sung. Fetis, fol- lowing up their investigations, has, in his \" Histoire de la Musique,'\"' made some further deductions which are very interesting. Sir William Jones discovered two ancient songs which are supposed to have been committed to writing about 1,400 b.c., but as every savant has hitherto deciphered them in a different manner, it is clear that the correct method of reading them has yet to be foimd out. The nearest approach to the old Hindoo music is most likely to be found in the religious hymns of the Hindoos of the present day. All sacred traditions — in which category these songs must be placed — are preserved and adhered to by Eastern races with a tenacity totally unknown to nations inhabiting the West. The following examples of Hindoo melody still extant, though they have probably lost much of their original chai-acter, owing to foreign influences during thousands of years, still retain sufficient individuality to enable us to form at least a general notion of ancient Hindoo music. \"^ * The following are from ■ Sir William Jones's work on \"Hindoo Music.\" \"With the exception of the third example in the minor, I have selected as illustrations other melodies than those given hy Ambros in his excellent \" History of Music,\" partly with the object of completing the specimens given by him, and partly because these melodies appear to me to be no less characteristic than those already known.

Such music could only emanate from a mind at peace with the world and ignorant of its sorrows. The Hindoos are children of the sun, and enjoy an existence as unconscious as that of the midges who dance in the last rays of our daily orb. For the rest, this melody runs smoothly in periods, and should hold a far higher rank than the aimless ramblings of the Chinese.

It was shown that most of the Chinese melodies known to us are in common time. We may assume the contrary to have been the case with Indian melodies, as they betray a predilection for uneven measures, most of them being in f, \\, or | time. It is not difficult to discern a connection l)etween this unequal measure and the natural tendency of the people. The undulating, indecisive character of 80 HISTORY OF MUSIC. uneven measures seems more in consonance with the soft sentimentality of the Hindoo^ and coincides more closely with certain traits in his homely poetry and plastic art than even measures, which convey an impression more nearly akin to the frank, decisive, and realistic feeling of the Chinese. The latter, therefore, naturally prefer the major keys, whilst the former make more constant use of the minor. It is, however, sometimes very difficult to determine the key in which a Chinese melody is written, and more especially whether it is major or minor. Ihe many years of bondag-e endured by the Indians changed considerably the character of their native music. Thus their Kektahs are of Persian, their Tu})pahs of Mongolian, and their Teranas of Arabian origin. Their instruments also testify to the influ- ence of political changes and. a foreign sway. It can be safely asserted ot* but few of the Indian instruments that they are of native origin. Tiiose which are indigenous belong to the earliest period of their civilisation ; the greater number, however, have been copied . with but slight altera- tion, from those of the neighbouring nations. When speaking of Nareda, the god of Hindoo music, we pointed out how close was the connection between the history of the oldest and most important instruments and that of their religion. The Vina, which might be appropriately termed the Hindoo lute, is at once the most pei'fect and the most national of all their instruments, and its antiquity is proved by the frequent mention made of it in a great number of ancient Hindoo poems. In the drama Sakuntala, so highly and justly praised by Goethe written by the Hindoo poet Kalidasa, 56 b.c., the King Duschmanta, on entering his garden, is wonderfully refreshed and invigorated by a triumphal song wherewith two singers greet him. He had hardly seated himself Fig. 20. — Iwan Schah, a Celebrated Hindoo Musician. CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 31 by the side of his friend Madhawja, when the sound of a Vina is heard through the grove. \" Hark ! \" said Madhawja to the Prince, \" do you not hear the sound of song from yonder room ? It is the harmony of a perfectly-tuned Vina. ^Tis there the Princess plays. ^'' \" Hush! ^^ rejoined the King, \" let me listen ! \" And now behind the scene is heard the Princess Sakuntala accompanying herself on the Vina to a bewitchingly- tuneful song. \" How full of emotion is this song ! ''■' exclaimed the King. \" What can it be ? Since I heard this song, I feel a strange longing as for a loved one far away ! \" Hence we learn that the Vina was used by personages of the highest rank, and the perfection of its tuning was extolled 2,000 years ago. That it was also a favourite instrument with the immortals appears from two of our illustrations, where it is seen in the hands of the god of music, and of the nymph Madura, a Gopi. The Vina, as the illustration opposite shows, is neither a harp nor a guitar, although bearing some resemblance to the latter instrument, the finger-board being provided with frets. It consists of a cylindrical tube about three feet in length, and contains no less than nine- teen movable bridges, placed at short intervals, which permit of a chromatic scale of two octaves (see No. 21). The seven strings of the Vina, made . No. 21. i -i^M^-- ^: I I — — H — '. — ii^ ^ ^r» ^'^^ th^-^ — I — -J^hJ #'.> f-^ of metal, are fixed to a similar number of pegs, and are tuned in the fol- lowing manner. No. 22. The resonance of the Vina (see Fig. 20) is produced by the two hollow pumpkins attached, to the back of the instrument. The performer here is the celebrated Hindoo musician of modern times, Iwan Schah. The Vina, as we see, is played in a sitting position, the instrument being pressed 33 HISTORY OF MUSIC. obliquely to the body of the performerj so that his chest is interposed between the two pumj^kins. Another string-ed instrument, the Magoudi (Fig. 23), bears a close affinity to the guitar, and its form is also somewhat like the Tanbur used by the Arabs. The Hindoo snake-charmers display a marked preference for this instrument in their exhibitions. The body of the Magoudi is richly ornamented, and resembles a pome- granate cut in half. The Hindoos have two kinds of violin, of which one is called the Seringhi and the other the Serinda. The strings of the latter are made of silk, and it is played with a bow of most primitive construction (Fig. 34-). Several of their instruments of percussion remind one of those of the Chinese, viz., their big drums, kettle-drums, and bells. They also have no lack of flutes, double-flutes, and bagpipes. At their funerals they use the Tare, a kind of trombone, which has a dull mournful tone. In common with the Chinese tliey have the King, the Gong (or Tamtam), and the Golden Horn (Fig. 25), a metal instrument, most artis- tically ornamented. It may be here observed that they possess a higher lig. 23.— Magoudi, the aptitude for music than the Chinese, as may be judged Hindoo Guitar. i p • c i • • i by the greater number and perfection of their stringed instruments, as well as by the more general employment of them.

Fi\"\\ 24. — Serinda. CHINESE, JAPANESE, AND HINDOOS. 33 The Hindoo Bayaderes play no insignificant part in relation to religion, music, and the dance. They are divided into two classes, the first being dedicated to the service of the Temple of the Gods, and the second consisting of dancers who lead a wandering life. The Bayaderes of the first class are called \"Devadasi\"' (the slaves of the gods), and live within the precincts of the temple. They are maidens who are free from bodily defects, and whose parents enter into a solemn contract renouncing all claim to them. The Devadasi are instructed in music, dancing, and mimicry. In the processions and festivities of the god whom they serve they chant choruses, in which his deeds and victories are glori- fied, and dance before his image as it is carried from place to place. They also plait wreaths and garlands to adorn the altars and pictures of their gods. When they wish to resign their sacred office they are per- mitted to choose a suitor from within or without the temple, but their selection is limited to the ^_^ highest caste; and they are com- ^ •-- pelled to promise their daughters < as Devadasis, and their sons as Fig. 25.— The Golden Horn of the Chinese musicians. ^\"^ \"^\"'i'^«^- A very inferior position is occupied by the Bayaderes of the second class. They are only engaged to perform at private festivities, caravan- saries, and public places of amusement, taking the place, in fact, of itinerant musicians. Their dances are not without historical interest, however, as they serve to perpetuate many ancient traditions. They consist, mostly of mimicry, explanation being given by musicians who accompany the dancing with songs, and generally refer to accepted or rejected love, lovers' meetings, jealousy, revenge, and the like.^ We also meet in India with musical dramas, the invention of which is attributed to the demigod Bharata. Gitagowimla, an idyllic^ musical 34 HISTOKY OF MUSIC. drama of very ancient orio-in, which tells of Krishna's quarrel and recon- ciliation with the beautiful Radha, consists of the songs of the two lovers, alternating with the chorus of the friends of Radha. Here we must close our sketch of the musical condition of the civilised nations of South-eastern and Southern Asia, and proceed to investigate the development of music in the primitive lands of the Nile Valley and in Egypt, the connecting link between Asia and Africa, returning to the ancient nations of Western Asia. CHAPTER II. THE EGYPTIANS, ETHIOPIANS. AND WESTERN ASIATICS, i.e., THE CHALDEANS, TÜEKS, MEDES, AND PERSIANS. All early musical investigators regarded the Egyptians as an unmusical people — an opinion which does not widely obtain in the closing century. Such a belief was especially fostered by a misunderstood passage in Diodorus Siculus. It was only after Dr. Burney found a hieroglyph in the shape of a lute on a .fallen obelisk at Rome, and James Bruce discovered repre- ■sentations of harps in the tombs of the Kings of Thebes, that this illusion began to be dispelled. The false impression was still further weakened by the discovery of monuments which threw new light upon the musical condition of the mysterious land of the Nile. Egyptologists have, in numerous instances, identified the iigures on these monuments as those of j^erformers on wind and stringed instruments, and have likewise de- ciphered several inscriptions referring to music. In one of the islands of the Upper Nile, Brugsch found the following inscription, supposed to date from the fifteenth dynasty : \" Erpa-He the Great, Prince of Kusch, and singer to his lord Amon/' from which we may conclude that even princes did not disdain to officiate as leaders of the singers. On the whole, it is matter for surprise that, considering the musical endowments of the Egyptians, it was possible to have been deceived so long. Amongst a peoj^le whose religion entered so deeply into all relations of life, and in a country where there existed so firm and general a belief in the immortality of the soul, the art of sound was sure to find its home. Where there is no religion, music can never obtain a secure footing, nor EGYPTIANS, ETHIOPIAN'S. AND WESTERN ASIATICS. 35 meet with its due appreciation. But a nation like the Egyptians, so g-iven to symbolising' and philosophising on the nature of the soul, could not but be strongly influenced by the power and soothing effect of music. The people were cast in a grand and stately mould, and lived in a land pre-eminently conducive to habits of meditation and reflection. Nowhere besides, except in India, do we find a people who, possessing mental proclivities similar to those of the Egyptians, endeavoured to account for the phenomena of this mysterious world. To such homes of civilisation the art of music was necessarily indigenous. There can be no doubt as to the character of Egyptian music, at least in its employment as an accessory to the performance of religious rites, it must have been both solemn and majestic. This would correspond Avith all the philosophical notions entertained by the Egyptians concerning the universe — reflections everywhere directed towards the great contradictions of human existence. The wonderful sublimity of the natural phenomena surrounding them could not but lead to this habit of thought. Egypt itself was an oasis in an enormous desert, and it was only by means of their fertilising river and a limited extent of seaboard that communi- cation between themselves and other nations could be continuously maintained. In striking contrast to the luxuriantly fruitful soil of the well-watered valley of the Nile stood the bare and arid mountains bordering upon it, from whose summits the eye wanders over the miles of sandy desert, or is deceived by the strange mirage on the horizon. During the periodical inundations of the Nile the valley was transformed into one immense sea, in which cities and villages were visible only as islands, the country presenting a totally different aspect from that which it assumed at other times of the year. Whilst engaged in the contemj)lation of such vast dissimilarities, the minds of the inhabitants of this country became alive to the greatest of all contradictions in nature and in human existence; they awoke to a sense of that irreconcilable antithesis existing between life and death : this formed the basis of their cosmical philosophy. But death, though it belongs to the unfathomable secrets of human existence, possesses, nevertheless, so great a fascination for us, that it ever incites to renewed speculation. A continuous meditation of the kind, such as we find occupying the intellects of the Egyptian priests and sages, could not but assert its ascendancy over the minds of the people to whom they D ä 36 HISTORY OF MUSIC. ministered,, imbuing them^ and their colossal buildings, with the character of the solemn, the wonderful, and the mysterious. We may, therefore, not unreasonably conclude that their music was brought under the same domi- nant influence, thus giving to it the impress of solemnity and mysticism. Even at the time when the Egyptians were still believed to have been entirely unmusical, many of our great musicians, with a power of divina- tion superior to that of erring science, instinctively discovered the tonal characteristics of this Eastern music, and used it to give local colour to their compositions. I need only refer, in support of this assertion, to Mehul^s Josejih in Egypt, and Mozart^s Zauherflote . The idols, pyramids, sphinxes and obelisks, the representations of Pharaoh and his followers, or the priesthood in the exercise of their mystic rites, which formed the background of Egy])tian temples, contributed ia no small degree to the creation of that solemn, sanctified, and truly-exalted sentiment pervading the immortal compositions above mentioned. And whilst we are upon this subject, it is worth while to note the impression produced on the greatest tone-poet of the nineteenth century by a saying of ancient Egyptian lore. On Beethoven's writing-table there was a framed copy of an inscription from the Temple of Sai's, which ran thus : — '^ I am all that is, that was, and that will be; no mortal has lifted my veil.^^ How inherent the musical gift was among the Semitic races has been shown by the Hebrews from the earliest times to the present day. The Egyptians, indeed, though almost certainly Semites, are a different race from the Israelites — the latter of whom, as is known, lacked entirely the matured plastic ax't of the Egyptians, whilst the Egyptians, on the other hand, were poor in poetical creations. We may, therefore, j^resupjwse that music in the Temple of Memphis differed from that performed in the Temple at Jerusalem, although no doubt also many a reminiscence of Egyptian music found its way into Palestine. Bunsen describes Egypt as the \" land of monuments,'^ and the Egyp- tians as the '' monumental j^eople of history.\" But the very existence of such a plenitude of monuments makes the want of musical records and Egyptian melodies all the more painfully felt. The lack of these shows us at what a disadvantage music stands in comparison with the plastic arts. For tone-pictures are not made of indestructible material like the pyramids, which stand firmly fixed in the ground, capable of resisting EGYPTIANS. ETHIOPIANS, AND WESTERN ASIATICS. 37 the ravages of thousands of years. Tones are, so to speak, the creations of the moment — ephemeral, evanescent. Even the attempt to fix them by notation offered no security for their preservation. A roll of papyrus fell an easy prey to the elements and a host of other enemies. \\Ye have already referred to the close connection that must have existed between the music of the Egyptians and their religion. Traces of it are visible not only in what we know of the vocal and instrumental music employed in their temj)les, but also in a considerable portion of their mythical traditions. Thus the Egyptians attribute the oriarin of those sacred melodies to the goddess Isis. Plato Fig. '-'6. — Performers of Funeral Music. (Copy of a Picture from a Tomb at Thebes.) tells us that amongst these sacred songs some must have been of great antiquity, as lie believed that good music and beautiful works of art had existed amongst them for ten thousand years without suffering any change. \" In their possession/\"\" adds the Greek philosopher^ \" are songs having the power to exalt and ennoble mankind, and these could only emanate from gods or god-like men.^' The Eg3q3tians themselves had similar notions concerning the origin of these primitive melodies. But not content with this, they pressed into the service of music even the natural elements which had been symbolised into gods. Thus there is to be seen in their temple at Dakkeh a picture representing the fire- god Ptah playing on a harp. Osiris also was looked upon as a j^atron deity of song. In many representations he is accompanied by the nine 38 HISTORY OF MUSIC. female singers whom the Greeks subsequently transformed into the \" nine muses/'' as they also transformed Osiris into \" Phoebus Apollo/'' There is an Egyptian tradition, very similar to one held by the Greeks, that the Egyptian god Thoth was the originator of the lyre, an instrument made out of the shell of a tortoise with strings affixed to it. Among forty- two \" priestly books \"\" attributed to Thoth, there are two \" Books of the Singer. \"\"^ From pictures of Egyptian catacombs we learn that instrumental music formed the general accompaniment of their solemn funeral rites, and that vocal music was employed in exceptional instances only (Fig. 26). Whole families of singers were attached to the temple ; the mysteries belonging to their religious rites were transmitted, like their castes, from father to son and from generation to generation. The Egyptians placed in the most ideal relation to the art of music their goddess Isis-Hathor, she Avhom Ebers calls \" the holy goddess of love, the mighty heavenly mother, the beautiful — filling heaven and earth with deeds of benevolence.''* Subsequently she was transformed into a muse, under whose protection were placed the dance, song, sport, and licentiousness ; the rope and tam- bourine in her hand signifying the caj)tivating power and joy of love. Manifold were the relations which music bore to the state and to general civilisation. In the houses of great families singers were specially retained, and from pictorial monuments we learn that both singers and dancers formed part of the household of Egyptian grandees, the illustrations showing female dancers accompanying themselves on the guitar, and blind singers accompanying themselves on harps. The Egyptians placed their music in close affinity with astronomy, a position which we have already seen it occupy among the Chinese and Hindoos; but it was only among the Greeks that this combination at- tained to its greatest significance. This linking together of music with the science of the stars and the universe — a connection repeatedly asserting itself amongst so many of the ancient civilised nations — distinctively points to their view of music as the art capable above all others of giving complete expression to the infinite, the eternal, and the ineffable. Poetry, from its very nature, is confined to the expression of definite ideas ; the plastie arts demand tangible forms and a circumscribed limit in space. Poetry, architecture, sculpture, and painting can therefore only indirectly express the infinite, and make it clear to us by symbolisation. EGYPTIANS, ETHIOPIANS, AND WESTERN ASIATICS. 39 The pictorial representation of the interior of the House of the Pharaohs on the architrave of a door in the catacombs near El-Amarna is highly interesting'^ as it shows the important position which was then assigned to miisic. The number of male and female singers and instrumentalists performing, either singly or conjointly, is so great, that Ambros, speaking jestingly of them, says that \" the Egyptian palaces were surrounded with whole conservatoires of music.\" On the walls of a catacomb dating from the time of the seventeenth dynasty, the departed master of the house and his consort are represented as listening to the performance of two female singers accompanied by two harps and one flute, while a little girl is beating time with the well-known Egyptian wooden clappers. This evidently is intended to represent one of those private orchestras which were usually attached to the houses of Egyptian nobles. Martial music had its place with the Egyptians as with all the nations of antiquity ; but as with them it was almost entirely confined to the use of trumpets and drums, we are justified in concluding that it was used only for signalling purposes. And this restriction would seem to suggest that music was with them, comparatively speaking, a highly- developed art. For it is a characteristic of barbarous nations only to begin a battle with howling war-cries, accompanied by the clamour of all their instruments. Homer refers to this (\"Iliad,^^ iii. 1 — 9) when he speaks of the Greeks, as the more civilised people, advancing to the fray silently, while the Trojans enter with loud cries. Like the Chinese and Hindoos, the Egyptians were rigorously divided into castes ; and so circumscribed was their conservatism, that it checked for thousands of years the onward march of civilisation, and isolated them entii'ely from intercourse with other nations. It was owing to this last circumstance, Herodotus tells us, that no strange melody crept into the land. The only exception to this, as we have already pointed out, is the \"Maneros,^^ in the melody of which Herodotus recognised the Greek \" Linos. \"\"^ The illustrious Greek traveller was not a little astonished to find these familiar sounds among a people who, with that exception, had nothing in common with his nation.* * That Herodotus refers less to the poetical contents of the song than to the melody seems clear, for except that everywhere the poetry has the character of a lament, the words are different. Each tribe applied it to its special gods, traditions, and rites, the tune alone remaining intact 40 HISTORY OF MUSIC. The most important of their national melodies were those that referred to death, the frailty of all things human, and the future state of the blessed — subjects which, as we have already seen, specially pre-occupied their minds. Their odes on death were of a twofold character, sometimes pathetic eleg-ies on the loss of the departed, sometimes hymns g-lorifying their transfig-uration. Specimens of both are given in the following verses. The first of these is the commencement of the \" Maneros/^ the lament of Isis on the death of the beloved Osiris. She sings : — \" Return, oh, return ! God Panu, return ! Those that were enemies Ai'e no more here. O lovely helper, return That thou may'st see me, thjr sister, Who loves thee : And com'st thou not near me ? 0 beautiful youth, return, oh, return ! \"When I see thee not My heart sorrows for thee. My eyes ever seek thee, 1 roam about for thee, to see thee in the form of the Nai, To see thee, to see thee, thou beautiful lov'd one. Let me, the Radiant, see thee God Panu, All Glory, see thee again. To thy beloved come, blessed Onnöfris, Come to thy sister, come to thy wife, God Urtuhet, oh, come ! Come to thy consort ! \" The second song, given below, is a hymn of the priest Tapherumnes. It is dedicated to the waning sun sinking beneath distant seas, whose waves are tipped with gold. This was looked on as symbolic of the pious singer at the close of a gentle life hastening to its beatification. \" Gracious be to me, thou God of the rising sun, Thou God of the evening sun ; Lord of both worlds, Thou God, who alone in truth dost dwell, Thou, who hast created all, Revealing Thyself in the Ej^e of the sun. At eventide I praise Thee, Peacefully dying to begin new life ; 'Midst hj-mns of praise sinking into the sea Where jubilant Thy bark awaits Tliee.\" EGYPTIANS, ETHIOPIANS, AND WESTERN ASIATICS. 41 If the melodies wedded to such verses were only approximately as emotional, then the music of the Egyptians must indeed have been capable of very great effects. Let us direct our attention to the few points which present themselves for investigation in the musical. systems of the Egyptians. The walls of tne temples and catacombs of Egypt do not disclose to us any expla- nation of the musical theory of the former inhabitants of that land, and we are therefore compelled to take refuge in the region of supposition, and it is at best only by indirect inferences that we can arrive at some not improbable conclusions on this important subject. We have but little positive information concerning the keys and scales of the Egyptians — indeed, much less than we have relating to the systems of the Chinese and Hindoos. The reason is that the occasional finding of a single papyrus and palimpsest can afford but scanty information compared with that con- tained in the sacred books of the Chinese and Hindoos that have been preserved to us. The sacred books of the Egyptians are chiselled in stone, and it is from the walls of the temple, obelisks, and tombs that we have to read. But it was impossible for the Egyptians, under such adverse circumstances, to fix the details and subtleties of their tonal system and musical history in the same manner as they are fixed in the Hindoo books Soma and Narayan. Nevertheless we are justified in supposing that the oldest tone-relations of the Egyptians consisted of tetrachords — i.e., four notes. Yet, wer^ we certain of this, it is always an open question whether these tetrachords were of a melodic or harmonic structure ; if melodic, they would have been played in succession — i.e., note after note ; if harmonic, then they would have been sounded simultaneously — i.e., in chords. Kiesewetter supposes the latter. In this event, the tetrachord could only have consisted of its key- note and its natural aliquots, a succession of tones like the following : — No. 27. ^ 7 Dio Cassius entirely rejects this, and admits only the Greek system, which has the interval of a fourth f\" Diatessaron \") as a foundation.
