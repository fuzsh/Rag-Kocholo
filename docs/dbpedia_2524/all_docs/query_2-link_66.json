A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' 29He answered, 'I will not'; but later he changed his mind and went. 30The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered, 'I go, sir'; but he did not go. 31Which of the two did the will of his father?\" They said, \"The first.\" Jesus said to them, \"Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. 32For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it, you did not change your minds and believe him.\n\nThe Word of the Lord.\n\nEveryone\n\nThanks be to God.\n\nSilence may be kept after the Reading.\n\nThe Canticle\n\nEveryone\n\nThe Song of Mary Magnificat\n\nLuke 1:46-55\n\nMy soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,\n\nmy spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *\n\nfor he has looked with favor on his lowly servant\n\nFrom this day all generations will call me blessed: *\n\nthe Almighty has done great things for me,\n\nand holy is his Name.\n\nHe has mercy on those who fear him *\n\nin every generation.\n\nHe has shown the strength of his arm, *\n\nhe has scattered the proud in their conceit.\n\nHe has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *\n\nand has lifted up the lowly.\n\nHe has filled the hungry with good things, *\n\nand the rich he has sent away empty.\n\nHe has come to the help of his servant Israel, *\n\nfor he has remembered his promise of mercy,\n\nThe promise he made to our fathers, *\n\nto Abraham and his children for ever.\n\nGlory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *\n\nas it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
