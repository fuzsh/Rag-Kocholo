        "text": "A comic-tragic opera with grand choruses and fabulous dances plays out in a world of glamour and deception. Rameau’s Platée is a first for Garsington Opera as we delve into the world of French Baroque opera, made possible by our special partnership with The English Concert. We are thrilled that director Louisa Muller and designer Christopher Oram return after their RPS Award-winning production of The Turn of the Screw, and we welcome conductor and French Baroque specialist Paul Agnew, who makes his Garsington debut.\n\nA close relative to the familiar myth of Semele, Platée is a character whose self-deception and entrancement places her in the middle of a heartless plot, devised by the gods to cure Juno of her obsessive jealousy over Jupiter and his romantic attachments. Jupiter pretends to fall in love with Platée only to abandon her once Juno arrives, proving she has no reason to be jealous.\n\nSung in French with English supertitles\n\nSamuel Boden Singing Rameau\n\nA former Alvarez Young Artist (2009 & 2010), Samuel will perform the title role in this masterpiece of French Baroque opera, rarely performed in the UK.\n\nFollow the link below to watch Samuel performing “In convertendo Dominus” by Rameau with Le Concert d’Astrée under the baton of Emmanuelle Haïm."
