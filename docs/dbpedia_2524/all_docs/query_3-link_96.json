        "text": "December 14, 2020\n\nFirst, I must note the perfect beauty of the name of the author of this tome: Cuthbert Girdlestone. Despite appearances, this is not a Monty Python character, but an eminent musicologist. He has become my first nomination for the Great English Names Hall of Fame.\n\nThis is an outstanding book about an outstanding musician. At the time Girdlestone was writing, it was very hard to hear much of Rameau's music. This has changed in recent times as baroque opera has experienced a renaissance. But for the most part Girdlestone had to imagine how Rameau's larger compositions would sound with singers and orchestra by plinking away at his piano.\n\nAs with many musicians of his time, Rameau did not leave behind much documentation about his life. The strictly biographical portion of this book is contained in two chapters: one at the beginning outlining his first fifty years, and one near the end describing his last thirty years. The rest of the book discusses his compositions in great detail. There is just one chapter about the only music of his that I knew previously, his compositions for harpsichord. It turns out that these were primarily written in the early part of his career. At age fifty, he composed his first opera. From then on, he was a devoted and prolific composer for the stage in various forms.\n\nGirdlestone's descriptions of Rameau's operas make one eager to see and hear these pieces. His analyses, using copious musical examples, are nearly as thorough and detailed as Ernest Newman's writing about Wagner's operas.\n\nOne thing I hadn't realized that was very interesting was that Rameau moved in the same circles as Voltaire. Voltaire collaborated with Rameau on three pieces, one of which is sadly lost. Rameau's interest in music theory makes sense in the context of Denis Diderot and the Encyclopedia. Rameau seems to have been seeking (with imperfect success) to establish a scientific basis for music.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about Rameau and his times, you will get a lot out of this book. But be advised, it's a long one!"
