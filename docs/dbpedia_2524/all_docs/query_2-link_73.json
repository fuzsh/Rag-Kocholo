First Day: Evening Prayer 6 Domine, ne in furore 1 LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger; *\n\ndo not punish me in your wrath.\n\n2 Have pity on me, LORD, for I am weak; *\n\nheal me, LORD, for my bones are racked. 3 My spirit shakes with terror; *\n\nhow long, O LORD, how long? 4 Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; *\n\nsave me for your mercy's sake. 5 For in death no one remembers you; *\n\nand who will give you thanks in the grave? 6 I grow weary because of my groaning; *\n\nevery night I drench my bed\n\nand flood my couch with tears. 7 My eyes are wasted with grief *\n\nand worn away because of all my enemies. 8 Depart from me, all evildoers, *\n\nfor the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping. 9 The LORD has heard my supplication; *\n\nthe LORD accepts my prayer. 10 All my enemies shall be confounded and quake with fear; *\n\nthey shall turn back and suddenly be put to shame. 7 Domine, Deus meus 1 O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; *\n\nsave and deliver me from all who pursue me; 2 Lest like a lion they tear me in pieces *\n\nand snatch me away with none to deliver me. 3 O LORD my God, if I have done these things: *\n\nif there is any wickedness in my hands,\n\n4 If I have repaid my friend with evil, *\n\nor plundered him who without cause is my enemy; 5 Then let my enemy pursue and overtake me, *\n\ntrample my life into the ground,\n\nand lay my honor in the dust. 6 Stand up, O LORD, in your wrath; *\n\nrise up against the fury of my enemies. 7 Awake, O my God, decree justice; *\n\nlet the assembly of the peoples gather round you. 8 Be seated on your lofty throne, O Most High; *\n\nO LORD, judge the nations. 9 Give judgment for me according to my\n\nrighteousness, O LORD, *\n\nand according to my innocence, O Most High. 10 Let the malice of the wicked come to an end,\n\nbut establish the righteous; *\n\nfor you test the mind and heart, O righteous God. 11 God is my shield and defense; *\n\nhe is the savior of the true in heart. 12 God is a righteous judge; *\n\nGod sits in judgment every day. 13 If they will not repent, God will whet his sword; *\n\nhe will bend his bow and make it ready. 14 He has prepared his weapons of death; *\n\nhe makes his arrows shafts of fire. 15 Look at those who are in labor with wickedness, *\n\nwho conceive evil, and give birth to a lie.\n\n16 They dig a pit and make it deep *\n\nand fall into the hole that they have made. 17 Their malice turns back upon their own head; *\n\ntheir violence falls on their own scalp. 18 I will bear witness that the LORD is righteous; *\n\nI will praise the Name of the LORD Most High. 8 Domine, Dominus noster 1 O LORD our Governor, *\n\nhow exalted is your Name in all the world! 2 Out of the mouths of infants and children *\n\nyour majesty is praised above the heavens. 3 You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *\n\nto quell the enemy and the avenger. 4 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *\n\nthe moon and the stars you have set in their courses, 5 What is man that you should be mindful of him? *\n\nthe son of man that you should seek him out? 6 You have made him but little lower than the angels; *\n\nyou adorn him with glory and honor; 7 You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *\n\nyou put all things under his feet: 8 All sheep and oxen, *\n\neven the wild beasts of the field, 9 The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *\n\nand whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea. 10 O LORD our Governor, *\n\nhow exalted is your Name in all the world!\n\nSecond Day: Morning Prayer 9 Confitebor tibi 1 I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *\n\nI will tell of all your marvelous works. 2 I will be glad and rejoice in you; *\n\nI will sing to your Name, O Most High. 3 When my enemies are driven back, *\n\nthey will stumble and perish at your presence. 4 For you have maintained my right and my cause; *\n\nyou sit upon your throne judging right. 5 You have rebuked the ungodly and destroyed the wicked; *\n\nyou have blotted out their name for ever and ever. 6 As for the enemy, they are finished, in perpetual ruin, *\n\ntheir cities plowed under, the memory of them perished; 7 But the LORD is enthroned for ever; *\n\nhe has set up his throne for judgment. 8 It is he who rules the world with righteousness; *\n\nhe judges the peoples with equity. 9 The LORD will be a refuge for the oppressed, *\n\na refuge in time of trouble. 10 Those who know your Name will put their trust in you, *\n\nfor you never forsake those who seek you, O LORD. 11 Sing praise to the LORD who dwells in Zion; *\n\nproclaim to the peoples the things he has done. 12 The Avenger of blood will remember them; *\n\nhe will not forget the cry of the afflicted.\n\n13 Have pity on me, O LORD; *\n\nsee the misery I suffer from those who hate me,\n\nO you who lift me up from the gate of death; 14 So that I may tell of all your praises\n\nand rejoice in your salvation *\n\nin the gates of the city of Zion. 15 The ungodly have fallen into the pit they dug, *\n\nand in the snare they set is their own foot caught. 16 The LORD is known by his acts of justice; *\n\nthe wicked are trapped in the works of their own hands. 17 The wicked shall be given over to the grave, *\n\nand also all the people that forget God. 18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten, *\n\nand the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever. 19 Rise up, O LORD, let not the ungodly have the upper hand; *\n\nlet them be judged before you. 20 Put fear upon them, O LORD; *\n\nlet the ungodly know they are but mortal. 10 Ut quid, Domine? 1 Why do you stand so far off, O LORD, *\n\nand hide yourself in time of trouble? 2 The wicked arrogantly persecute the poor, *\n\nbut they are trapped in the schemes they have devised. 3 The wicked boast of their heart's desire; *\n\nthe covetous curse and revile the LORD. 4 The wicked are so proud that they care not for God; *\n\ntheir only thought is, \"God does not matter.\"\n\n5 Their ways are devious at all times;\n\nyour judgments are far above out of their sight; *\n\nthey defy all their enemies. 6 They say in their heart, \"I shall not be shaken; *\n\nno harm shall happen to me ever.\" 7 Their mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression; *\n\nunder their tongue are mischief and wrong. 8 They lurk in ambush in public squares\n\nand in secret places they murder the innocent; *\n\nthey spy out the helpless. 9 They lie in wait, like a lion in a covert;\n\nthey lie in wait to seize upon the lowly; *\n\nthey seize the lowly and drag them away in their net. 10 The innocent are broken and humbled before them; *\n\nthe helpless fall before their power. 11 They say in their heart, \"God has forgotten; *\n\nhe hides his face; he will never notice.\" 12 Rise up, O LORD;\n\nlift up your hand, O God; *\n\ndo not forget the afflicted. 13 Why should the wicked revile God? *\n\nwhy should they say in their heart, \"You do not care\"? 14 Surely, you behold trouble and misery; *\n\nyou see it and take it into your own hand. 15 The helpless commit themselves to you, *\n\nfor you are the helper of orphans. 16 Break the power of the wicked and evil; *\n\nsearch out their wickedness until you find none.\n\n17 The LORD is King for ever and ever; *\n\nthe ungodly shall perish from his land. 18 The LORD will hear the desire of the humble; *\n\nyou will strengthen their heart and your ears shall hear; 19 To give justice to the orphan and oppressed, *\n\nso that mere mortals may strike terror no more. 11 In Domino confido 1 In the LORD have I taken refuge; *\n\nhow then can you say to me,\n\n\"Fly away like a bird to the hilltop; 2 For see how the wicked bend the bow\n\nand fit their arrows to the string, *\n\nto shoot from ambush at the true of heart. 3 When the foundations are being destroyed, *\n\nwhat can the righteous do?\" 4 The LORD is in his holy temple; *\n\nthe LORD'S throne is in heaven. 5 His eyes behold the inhabited world; *\n\nhis piercing eye weighs our worth. 6 The LORD weighs the righteous as well as the wicked, *\n\nbut those who delight in violence he abhors. 7 Upon the wicked he shall rain coals of fire and\n\nburning sulphur; *\n\na scorching wind shall be their lot. 8 For the LORD is righteous;\n\nhe delights in righteous deeds; *\n\nand the just shall see his face.\n\nSecond Day: Evening Prayer 12 Salvum me fac 1 Help me, LORD, for there is no godly one left; *\n\nthe faithful have vanished from among us. 2 Everyone speaks falsely with his neighbor; *\n\nwith a smooth tongue they speak from a double heart. 3 Oh, that the LORD would cut off all smooth tongues, *\n\nand close the lips that utter proud boasts! 4 Those who say, \"With our tongue will we prevail; *\n\nour lips are our own; who is lord over us?\" 5 \"Because the needy are oppressed,\n\nand the poor cry out in misery, *\n\nI will rise up,\" says the LORD,\n\n\"and give them the help they long for.\" 6 The words of the LORD are pure words, *\n\nlike silver refined from ore\n\nand purified seven times in the fire. 7 O LORD, watch over us *\n\nand save us from this generation for ever. 8 The wicked prowl on every side, *\n\nand that which is worthless is highly prized by everyone. 13 Usquequo, Domine? 1 How long, O LORD?\n\nwill you forget me for ever? *\n\nhow long will you hide your face from me?\n\n2 How long shall I have perplexity in my mind,\n\nand grief in my heart, day after day? *\n\nhow long shall my enemy triumph over me? 3 Look upon me and answer me, O LORD my God; *\n\ngive light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death; 4 Lest my enemy say, \"I have prevailed over him,\" *\n\nand my foes rejoice that I have fallen. 5 But I put my trust in your mercy; *\n\nmy heart is joyful because of your saving help. 6 I will sing to the LORD, for he has dealt with me richly; *\n\nI will praise the Name of the Lord Most High. 14 Dixit insipiens 1 The fool has said in his heart, \"There is no God.\" *\n\nAll are corrupt and commit abominable acts;\n\nthere is none who does any good. 2 The LORD looks down from heaven upon us all, *\n\nto see if there is any who is wise,\n\nif there is one who seeks after God. 3 Every one has proved faithless;\n\nall alike have turned bad; *\n\nthere is none who does good; no, not one. 4 Have they no knowledge, all those evildoers *\n\nwho eat up my people like bread\n\nand do not call upon the LORD? 5 See how they tremble with fear, *\n\nbecause God is in the company of the righteous. 6 Their aim is to confound the plans of the afflicted, *\n\nbut the LORD is their refuge.\n\n7 Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *\n\nwhen the LORD restores the fortunes of his people,\n\nJacob will rejoice and Israel be glad. Third Day: Morning Prayer 15 Domine, quis habitabit? 1 LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? *\n\nwho may abide upon your holy hill? 2 Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *\n\nwho speaks the truth from his heart. 3 There is no guile upon his tongue;\n\nhe does no evil to his friend; *\n\nhe does not heap contempt upon his neighbor. 4 In his sight the wicked is rejected, *\n\nbut he honors those who fear the LORD. 5 He has sworn to do no wrong *\n\nand does not take back his word. 6 He does not give his money in hope of gain, *\n\nnor does he take a bribe against the innocent. 7 Whoever does these things *\n\nshall never be overthrown. 16 Conserva me, Domine 1 Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in you; *\n\nI have said to the LORD, \"You are my Lord,\n\nmy good above all other.\"\n\n2 All my delight is upon the godly that are in the land, *\n\nupon those who are noble among the people. 3 But those who run after other gods *\n\nshall have their troubles multiplied. 4 Their libations of blood I will not offer, *\n\nnor take the names of their gods upon my lips. 5 O LORD, you are my portion and my cup; *\n\nit is you who uphold my lot. 6 My boundaries enclose a pleasant land; *\n\nindeed, I have a goodly heritage. 7 I will bless the LORD who gives me counsel; *\n\nmy heart teaches me, night after night. 8 I have set the LORD always before me; *\n\nbecause he is at my right hand I shall not fall. 9 My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; *\n\nmy body also shall rest in hope. 10 For you will not abandon me to the grave, *\n\nnor let your holy one see the Pit. 11 You will show me the path of life; *\n\nin your presence there is fullness of joy,\n\nand in your right hand are pleasures for evermore. 17 Exaudi, Domine 1 Hear my plea of innocence, O LORD;\n\ngive heed to my cry; *\n\nlisten to my prayer, which does not come from lying lips.\n\n2 Let my vindication come forth from your presence; *\n\nlet your eyes be fixed on justice. 3 Weigh my heart, summon me by night, *\n\nmelt me down; you will find no impurity in me. 4 I give no offense with my mouth as others do; *\n\nI have heeded the words of your lips. 5 My footsteps hold fast to the ways of your law; *\n\nin your paths my feet shall not stumble. 6 I call upon you, O God, for you will answer me; *\n\nincline your ear to me and hear my words. 7 Show me your marvelous loving-kindness, *\n\nO Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand\n\nfrom those who rise up against them. 8 Keep me as the apple of your eye; *\n\nhide me under the shadow of your wings, 9 From the wicked who assault me, *\n\nfrom my deadly enemies who surround me. 10 They have closed their heart to pity, *\n\nand their mouth speaks proud things. 11 They press me hard,\n\nnow they surround me, *\n\nwatching how they may cast me to the ground, 12 Like a lion, greedy for its prey, *\n\nand like a young lion lurking in secret places. 13 Arise, O LORD; confront them and bring them down; *\n\ndeliver me from the wicked by your sword. 14 Deliver me, O LORD, by your hand *\n\nfrom those whose portion in life is this world;\n\n15 Whose bellies you fill with your treasure, *\n\nwho are well supplied with children\n\nand leave their wealth to their little ones. 16 But at my vindication I shall see your face; *\n\nwhen I awake, I shall be satisfied, beholding\n\nyour likeness. Third Day: Evening Prayer 18 Part I Diligam te, Domine. 1 I love you, O LORD my strength, *\n\nO LORD my stronghold, my crag, and my haven. 2 My God, my rock in whom I put my trust, *\n\nmy shield, the horn of my salvation, and my refuge;\n\nyou are worthy of praise. 3 I will call upon the LORD, *\n\nand so shall I be saved from my enemies. 4 The breakers of death rolled over me, *\n\nand the torrents of oblivion made me afraid. 5 The cords of hell entangled me, *\n\nand the snares of death were set for me. 6 I called upon the LORD in my distress *\n\nand cried out to my God for help. 7 He heard my voice from his heavenly dwelling; *\n\nmy cry of anguish came to his ears.\n\n8 The earth reeled and rocked; *\n\nthe roots of the mountains shook;\n\nthey reeled because of his anger. 9 Smoke rose from his nostrils\n\nand a consuming fire out of his mouth; *\n\nhot burning coals blazed forth from him. 10 He parted the heavens and came down *\n\nwith a storm cloud under his feet. 11 He mounted on cherubim and flew; *\n\nhe swooped on the wings of the wind. 12 He wrapped darkness about him; *\n\nhe made dark waters and thick clouds his pavilion. 13 From the brightness of his presence, through the clouds, *\n\nburst hailstones and coals of fire. 14 The LORD thundered out of heaven; *\n\nthe Most High uttered his voice. 15 He loosed his arrows and scattered them; *\n\nhe hurled thunderbolts and routed them. 16 The beds of the seas were uncovered,\n\nand the foundations of the world laid bare, *\n\nat your battle cry, O LORD,\n\nat the blast of the breath of your nostrils. 17 He reached down from on high and grasped me; *\n\nhe drew me out of great waters. 18 He delivered me from my strong enemies\n\nand from those who hated me; *\n\nfor they were too mighty for me. 19 They confronted me in the day of my disaster; *\n\nbut the LORD was my support.\n\n20 He brought me out into an open place; *\n\nhe rescued me because he delighted in me. Psalm 18: Part II Et retribuet mihi 21 The LORD rewarded me because of my righteous dealing; *\n\nbecause my hands were clean he rewarded me; 22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD *\n\nand have not offended against my God; 23 For all his judgments are before my eyes, *\n\nand his decrees I have not put away from me; 24 For I have been blameless with him *\n\nand have kept myself from iniquity; 25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me according to my\n\nrighteous dealing, *\n\nbecause of the cleanness of my hands in his sight. 26 With the faithful you show yourself faithful, O God; *\n\nwith the forthright you show yourself forthright. 27 With the pure you show yourself pure, *\n\nbut with the crooked you are wily. 28 You will save a lowly people, *\n\nbut you will humble the haughty eyes. 29 You, O LORD, are my lamp; *\n\nmy God, you make my darkness bright. 30 With you I will break down an enclosure; *\n\nwith the help of my God I will scale any wall. 31 As for God, his ways are perfect;\n\nthe words of the LORD are tried in the fire; *\n\nhe is a shield to all who trust in him.\n\n32 For who is God, but the LORD? *\n\nwho is the Rock, except our God? 33 It is God who girds me about with strength *\n\nand makes my way secure. 34 He makes me sure-footed like a deer *\n\nand lets me stand firm on the heights. 35 He trains my hands for battle *\n\nand my arms for bending even a bow of bronze. 36 You have given me your shield of victory; *\n\nyour right hand also sustains me;\n\nyour loving care makes me great. 37 You lengthen my stride beneath me, *\n\nand my ankles do not give way. 38 I pursue my enemies and overtake them; *\n\nI will not turn back till I have destroyed them. 39 I strike them down, and they cannot rise; *\n\nthey fall defeated at my feet. 40 You have girded me with strength for the battle; *\n\nyou have cast down my adversaries beneath me;\n\nyou have put my enemies to flight. 41 I destroy those who hate me;\n\nthey cry out, but there is none to help them; *\n\nthey cry to the LORD, but he does not answer. 42 I beat them small like dust before the wind; *\n\nI trample them like mud in the streets. 43 You deliver me from the strife of the peoples; *\n\nyou put me at the head of the nations. 44 A people I have not known shall serve me;\n\nno sooner shall they hear than they shall obey me; *\n\nstrangers will cringe before me.\n\n45 The foreign peoples will lose heart; *\n\nthey shall come trembling out of their strongholds. 46 The LORD lives! Blessed is my Rock! *\n\nExalted is the God of my salvation! 47 He is the God who gave me victory *\n\nand cast down the peoples beneath me. 48 You rescued me from the fury of my enemies;\n\nyou exalted me above those who rose against me; *\n\nyou saved me from my deadly foe. 49 Therefore will I extol you among the nations, O LORD, *\n\nand sing praises to your Name. 50 He multiplies the victories of his king; *\n\nhe shows loving-kindness to his anointed,\n\nto David and his descendants for ever. Fourth Day: Morning Prayer 19 CÃ¦li enarrant 1 The heavens declare the glory of God, *\n\nand the firmament shows his handiwork. 2 One day tells its tale to another, *\n\nand one night imparts knowledge to another. 3 Although they have no words or language, *\n\nand their voices are not heard, 4 Their sound has gone out into all lands, *\n\nand their message to the ends of the world. 5 In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *\n\nit comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;\n\nit rejoices like a champion to run its course.\n\n6 It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens\n\nand runs about to the end of it again; *\n\nnothing is hidden from its burning heat. 7 The law of the LORD is perfect\n\nand revives the soul; *\n\nthe testimony of the LORD is sure\n\nand gives wisdom to the innocent. 8 The statutes of the LORD are just\n\nand rejoice the heart; *\n\nthe commandment of the LORD is clear\n\nand gives light to the eyes. 9 The fear of the LORD is clean\n\nand endures for ever; *\n\nthe judgments of the LORD are true\n\nand righteous altogether. 10 More to be desired are they than gold,\n\nmore than much fine gold, *\n\nsweeter far than honey,\n\nthan honey in the comb. 11 By them also is your servant enlightened, *\n\nand in keeping them there is great reward. 12 Who can tell how often he offends? *\n\ncleanse me from my secret faults. 13 Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;\n\nlet them not get dominion over me; *\n\nthen shall I be whole and sound,\n\nand innocent of a great offense. 14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my\n\nheart be acceptable in your sight, *\n\nO LORD, my strength and my redeemer.\n\n20 Exaudiat te Dominus 1 May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble, *\n\nthe Name of the God of Jacob defend you; 2 Send you help from his holy place *\n\nand strengthen you out of Zion; 3 Remember all your offerings *\n\nand accept your burnt sacrifice; 4 Grant you your heart's desire *\n\nand prosper all your plans. 5 We will shout for joy at your victory\n\nand triumph in the Name of our God; *\n\nmay the LORD grant all your requests. 6 Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his anointed; *\n\nhe will answer him out of his holy heaven,\n\nwith the victorious strength of his right hand. 7 Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, *\n\nbut we will call upon the Name of the LORD our God. 8 They collapse and fall down, *\n\nbut we will arise and stand upright. 9 O LORD, give victory to the king *\n\nand answer us when we call. 21 Domine, in virtute tua 1 The king rejoices in your strength, O LORD; *\n\nhow greatly he exults in your victory! 2 You have given him his heart's desire; *\n\nyou have not denied him the request of his lips.\n\n3 For you meet him with blessings of prosperity, *\n\nand set a crown of fine gold upon his head. 4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him: *\n\nlength of days, for ever and ever. 5 His honor is great, because of your victory; *\n\nsplendor and majesty have you bestowed upon him. 6 For you will give him everlasting felicity *\n\nand will make him glad with the joy of your presence. 7 For the king puts his trust in the LORD; *\n\nbecause of the loving-kindness of the Most High, he\n\nwill not fall. 8 Your hand will lay hold upon all your enemies; *\n\nyour right hand will seize all those who hate you. 9 You will make them like a fiery furnace *\n\nat the time of your appearing, O LORD; 10 You will swallow them up in your wrath, *\n\nand fire shall consume them. 11 You will destroy their offspring from the land *\n\nand their descendants from among the peoples of the earth. 12 Though they intend evil against you\n\nand devise wicked schemes, *\n\nyet they shall not prevail. 13 For you will put them to flight *\n\nand aim your arrows at them. 14 Be exalted, O LORD, in your might; *\n\nwe will sing and praise your power.\n\nFourth Day: Evening Prayer 22 Deus, Deus meu 1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *\n\nand are so far from my cry\n\nand from the words of my distress? 2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *\n\nby night as well, but I find no rest. 3 Yet you are the Holy One, *\n\nenthroned upon the praises of Israel. 4 Our forefathers put their trust in you; *\n\nthey trusted, and you delivered them. 5 They cried out to you and were delivered; *\n\nthey trusted in you and were not put to shame. 6 But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *\n\nscorned by all and despised by the people. 7 All who see me laugh me to scorn; *\n\nthey curl their lips and wag their heads, saying, 8 \"He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *\n\nlet him rescue him, if he delights in him.\" 9 Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *\n\nand kept me safe upon my mother's breast. 10 I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *\n\nyou were my God when I was still in my\n\nmother's womb. 11 Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *\n\nand there is none to help.\n\n12 Many young bulls encircle me; *\n\nstrong bulls of Bashan surround me. 13 They open wide their jaws at me, *\n\nlike a ravening and a roaring lion. 14 I am poured out like water;\n\nall my bones are out of joint; *\n\nmy heart within my breast is melting wax. 15 My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;\n\nmy tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *\n\nand you have laid me in the dust of the grave. 16 Packs of dogs close me in,\n\nand gangs of evildoers circle around me; *\n\nthey pierce my hands and my feet;\n\nI can count all my bones. 17 They stare and gloat over me; *\n\nthey divide my garments among them;\n\nthey cast lots for my clothing. 18 Be not far away, O LORD; *\n\nyou are my strength; hasten to help me. 19 Save me from the sword, *\n\nmy life from the power of the dog. 20 Save me from the lion's mouth, *\n\nmy wretched body from the horns of wild bulls. 21 I will declare your Name to my brethren; *\n\nin the midst of the congregation I will praise you. 22 Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *\n\nstand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;\n\nall you of Jacob's line, give glory.\n\n23 For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;\n\nneither does he hide his face from them; *\n\nbut when they cry to him he hears them. 24 My praise is of him in the great assembly; *\n\nI will perform my vows in the presence of those who\n\nworship him. 25 The poor shall eat and be satisfied,\n\nand those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *\n\n\"May your heart live for ever!\" 26 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to\n\nthe LORD, *\n\nand all the families of the nations bow before him. 27 For kingship belongs to the LORD; *\n\nhe rules over the nations. 28 To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down\n\nin worship; *\n\nall who go down to the dust fall before him. 29 My soul shall live for him;\n\nmy descendants shall serve him; *\n\nthey shall be known as the LORD'S for ever. 30 They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *\n\nthe saving deeds that he has done. 23 Dominus regit me 1 The LORD is my shepherd; *\n\nI shall not be in want. 2 He makes me lie down in green pastures *\n\nand leads me beside still waters.\n\n3 He revives my soul *\n\nand guides me along right pathways for his Name's sake. 4 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\n\nI shall fear no evil; *\n\nfor you are with me;\n\nyour rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 You spread a table before me in the presence of those\n\nwho trouble me; *\n\nyou have anointed my head with oil,\n\nand my cup is running over. 6 Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days\n\nof my life, *\n\nand I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. Fifth Day: Morning Prayer 24 Domini est terra 1 The earth is the LORD'S and all that is in it, *\n\nthe world and all who dwell therein. 2 For it is he who founded it upon the seas *\n\nand made it firm upon the rivers of the deep. 3 \"Who can ascend the hill of the LORD? *\n\nand who can stand in his holy place?\" 4 \"Those who have clean hands and a pure heart, *\n\nwho have not pledged themselves to falsehood,\n\nnor sworn by what is a fraud. 5 They shall receive a blessing from the LORD *\n\nand a just reward from the God of their salvation.\" 6 Such is the generation of those who seek him, *\n\nof those who seek your face, O God of Jacob.\n\n7 Lift up your heads, O gates;\n\nlift them high, O everlasting doors; *\n\nand the King of glory shall come in. 8 \"Who is this King of glory?\" *\n\n\"The LORD, strong and mighty,\n\nthe LORD, mighty in battle.\" 9 Lift up your heads, O gates;\n\nlift them high, O everlasting doors; *\n\nand the King of glory shall come in. 10 \"Who is he, this King of glory?\" *\n\n\"The LORD of hosts,\n\nhe is the King of glory.\" 25 Ad te, Domine, levavi 1 To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;\n\nmy God, I put my trust in you; *\n\nlet me not be humiliated,\n\nnor let my enemies triumph over me. 2 Let none who look to you be put to shame; *\n\nlet the treacherous be disappointed in their schemes. 3 Show me your ways, O LORD, *\n\nand teach me your paths. 4 Lead me in your truth and teach me, *\n\nfor you are the God of my salvation;\n\nin you have I trusted all the day long. 5 Remember, O LORD, your compassion and love, *\n\nfor they are from everlasting.\n\n6 Remember not the sins of my youth and my transgressions; *\n\nremember me according to your love\n\nand for the sake of your goodness, O LORD. 7 Gracious and upright is the LORD; *\n\n&nbsptherefore he teaches sinners in his way. 8 He guides the humble in doing right *\n\nand teaches his way to the lowly. 9 All the paths of the LORD are love and faithfulness *\n\nto those who keep his covenant and his testimonies. 10 For your Name's sake, O LORD, *\n\nforgive my sin, for it is great. 11 Who are they who fear the LORD? *\n\nhe will teach them the way that they should choose. 12 They shall dwell in prosperity, *\n\nand their offspring shall inherit the land. 13 The LORD is a friend to those who fear him *\n\nand will show them his covenant. 14 My eyes are ever looking to the LORD, *\n\nfor he shall pluck my feet out of the net. 15 Turn to me and have pity on me, *\n\nfor I am left alone and in misery. 16 The sorrows of my heart have increased; *\n\nbring me out of my troubles. 17 Look upon my adversity and misery *\n\nand forgive me all my sin. 18 Look upon my enemies, for they are many, *\n\nand they bear a violent hatred against me.\n\n19 Protect my life and deliver me; *\n\nlet me not be put to shame, for I have trusted in you. 20 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, *\n\nfor my hope has been in you. 21 Deliver Israel, O God, *\n\nout of all his troubles. 26 Judica me, Domine 1 Give judgment for me, O LORD,\n\nfor I have lived with integrity; *\n\nI have trusted in the Lord and have not faltered. 2 Test me, O LORD, and try me; *\n\nexamine my heart and my mind. 3 For your love is before my eyes; *\n\nI have walked faithfully with you. 4 I have not sat with the worthless, *\n\nnor do I consort with the deceitful. 5 I have hated the company of evildoers; *\n\nI will not sit down with the wicked. 6 I will wash my hands in innocence, O LORD, *\n\nthat I may go in procession round your altar, 7 Singing aloud a song of thanksgiving *\n\nand recounting all your wonderful deeds. 8 LORD, I love the house in which you dwell *\n\nand the place where your glory abides. 9 Do not sweep me away with sinners, *\n\nnor my life with those who thirst for blood,\n\n10 Whose hands are full of evil plots, *\n\nand their right hand full of bribes. 11 As for me, I will live with integrity; *\n\nredeem me, O LORD, and have pity on me. 12 My foot stands on level ground; *\n\nin the full assembly I will bless the LORD. Fifth Day: Evening Prayer 27 Dominus illuminatio 1 The LORD is my light and my salvation;\n\nwhom then shall I fear? *\n\nthe LORD is the strength of my life;\n\nof whom then shall I be afraid? 2 When evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh, *\n\nit was they, my foes and my adversaries, who\n\nstumbled and fell. 3 Though an army should encamp against me, *\n\nyet my heart shall not be afraid; 4 And though war should rise up against me, *\n\nyet will I put my trust in him. 5 One thing have I asked of the LORD;\n\none thing I seek; *\n\nthat I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days\n\nof my life; 6 To behold the fair beauty of the LORD *\n\nand to seek him in his temple.\n\n7 For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe\n\nin his shelter; *\n\nhe shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling\n\nand set me high upon a rock. 8 Even now he lifts up my head *\n\nabove my enemies round about me. 9 Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation\n\nwith sounds of great gladness; *\n\nI will sing and make music to the LORD. 10 Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; *\n\nhave mercy on me and answer me. 11 You speak in my heart and say, \"Seek my face.\" *\n\nYour face, LORD, will I seek. 12 Hide not your face from me, *\n\nnor turn away your servant in displeasure. 13 You have been my helper;\n\ncast me not away; *\n\ndo not forsake me, O God of my salvation. 14 Though my father and my mother forsake me, *\n\nthe LORD will sustain me. 15 Show me your way, O LORD; *\n\nlead me on a level path, because of my enemies. 16 Deliver me not into the hand of my adversaries, *\n\nfor false witnesses have risen up against me,\n\nand also those who speak malice. 17 What if I had not believed\n\nthat I should see the goodness of the LORD *\n\nin the land of the living!\n\n18 O tarry and await the LORD'S pleasure;\n\nbe strong, and he shall comfort your heart; *\n\nwait patiently for the LORD. 28 Ad te, Domine 1 O LORD, I call to you;\n\nmy Rock, do not be deaf to my cry; *\n\nlest, if you do not hear me,\n\nI become like those who go down to the Pit. 2 Hear the voice of my prayer when I cry out to you, *\n\nwhen I lift up my hands to your holy of holies. 3 Do not snatch me away with the wicked or with the\n\nevildoers, *\n\nwho speak peaceably with their neighbors,\n\nwhile strife is in their hearts. 4 Repay them according to their deeds, *\n\nand according to the wickedness of their actions. 5 According to the work of their hands repay them, *\n\nand give them their just deserts. 6 They have no understanding of the LORD'S doings,\n\nnor of the works of his hands; *\n\ntherefore he will break them down and not\n\nbuild them up. 7 Blessed is the LORD! *\n\nfor he has heard the voice of my prayer. 8 The LORD is my strength and my shield; *\n\nmy heart trusts in him, and I have been helped; 9 Therefore my heart dances for joy, *\n\nand in my song will I praise him.\n\n10 The LORD is the strength of his people, *\n\na safe refuge for his anointed. 11 Save your people and bless your inheritance; *\n\nshepherd them and carry them for ever. 29 Afferte Domino 1 Ascribe to the LORD, you gods, *\n\nascribe to the LORD glory and strength. 2 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his Name; *\n\nworship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters;\n\nthe God of glory thunders; *\n\nthe LORD is upon the mighty waters. 4 The voice of the LORD is a powerful voice; *\n\nthe voice of the LORD is a voice of splendor. 5 The voice of the LORD breaks the cedar trees; *\n\nthe LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon; 6 He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, *\n\nand Mount Hermon like a young wild ox. 7 The voice of the LORD splits the flames of fire;\n\nthe voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; *\n\nthe LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 8 The voice of the LORD makes the oak trees writhe *\n\nand strips the forests bare. 9 And in the temple of the LORD *\n\nall are crying, \"Glory!\" 10 The LORD sits enthroned above the flood; *\n\nthe LORD sits enthroned as King for evermore.\n\n11 The LORD shall give strength to his people; *\n\nthe LORD shall give his people the blessing of peace. Sixth Day: Morning Prayer 30 Exaltabo te, Domine 1 I will exalt you, O LORD,\n\nbecause you have lifted me up *\n\nand have not let my enemies triumph over me. 2 O LORD my God, I cried out to you, *\n\nand you restored me to health. 3 You brought me up, O LORD, from the dead; *\n\nyou restored my life as I was going down to the grave. 4 Sing to the LORD, you servants of his; *\n\ngive thanks for the remembrance of his holiness. 5 For his wrath endures but the twinkling of an eye, *\n\nhis favor for a lifetime. 6 Weeping may spend the night, *\n\nbut joy comes in the morning. 7 While I felt secure, I said,\n\n\"I shall never be disturbed. *\n\nYou, LORD, with your favor, made me as strong as\n\nthe mountains.\" 8 Then you hid your face, *\n\nand I was filled with fear. 9 I cried to you, O LORD; *\n\nI pleaded with the Lord, saying, 10 \"What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the Pit? *\n\nwill the dust praise you or declare your faithfulness?\n\n11 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; *\n\nO LORD, be my helper.\" 12 You have turned my wailing into dancing; *\n\nyou have put off my sack-cloth and clothed me with joy. 13 Therefore my heart sings to you without ceasing; *\n\nO LORD my God, I will give you thanks for ever. 31 In te, Domine, speravi 1 In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;\n\nlet me never be put to shame; *\n\ndeliver me in your righteousness. 2 Incline your ear to me; *\n\nmake haste to deliver me. 3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,\n\nfor you are my crag and my stronghold; *\n\nfor the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me. 4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *\n\nfor you are my tower of strength. 5 Into your hands I commend my spirit, *\n\nfor you have redeemed me,\n\nO LORD, O God of truth. 6 I hate those who cling to worthless idols, *\n\nand I put my trust in the LORD. 7 I will rejoice and be glad because of your mercy; *\n\nfor you have seen my affliction;\n\nyou know my distress.\n\n8 You have not shut me up in the power of the enemy; *\n\nyou have set my feet in an open place. 9 Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am in trouble; *\n\nmy eye is consumed with sorrow,\n\nand also my throat and my belly. 10 For my life is wasted with grief,\n\nand my years with sighing; *\n\nmy strength fails me because of affliction,\n\nand my bones are consumed. 11 I have become a reproach to all my enemies and\n\neven to my neighbors,\n\na dismay to those of my acquaintance; *\n\nwhen they see me in the street they avoid me. 12 I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *\n\nI am as useless as a broken pot. 13 For I have heard the whispering of the crowd;\n\nfear is all around; *\n\nthey put their heads together against me;\n\nthey plot to take my life. 14 But as for me, I have trusted in you, O LORD. *\n\nI have said, \"You are my God. 15 My times are in your hand; *\n\nrescue me from the hand of my enemies,\n\nand from those who persecute me. 16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *\n\nand in your loving-kindness save me.\" 17 LORD, let me not be ashamed for having called upon you; *\n\nrather, let the wicked be put to shame;\n\nlet them be silent in the grave.\n\n18 Let the lying lips be silenced which speak against\n\nthe righteous, *\n\nhaughtily, disdainfully, and with contempt. 19 How great is your goodness, O LORD!\n\nwhich you have laid up for those who fear you; *\n\nwhich you have done in the sight of all\n\nfor those who put their trust in you. 20 You hide them in the covert of your presence from those\n\nwho slander them; *\n\nyou keep them in your shelter from the strife of tongues. 21 Blessed be the LORD! *\n\nfor he has shown me the wonders of his love in a\n\nbesieged city. 22 Yet I said in my alarm,\n\nI have been cut off from the sight of your eyes.\" *\n\nNevertheless, you heard the sound of my entreaty\n\nwhen I cried out to you. 23 Love the LORD, all you who worship him; *\n\nthe LORD protects the faithful,\n\nbut repays to the full those who act haughtily. 24 Be strong and let your heart take courage, *\n\nall you who wait for the LORD. Sixth Day: Evening Prayer 32 Beati quorum 1 Happy are they whose transgressions are forgiven, *\n\nand whose sin is put away!\n\n2 Happy are they to whom the LORD imputes no guilt, *\n\nand in whose spirit there is no guile! 3 While I held my tongue, my bones withered away, *\n\nbecause of my groaning all day long. 4 For your hand was heavy upon me day and night; *\n\nmy moisture was dried up as in the heat of summer. 5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you, *\n\nand did not conceal my guilt. 6 I said, \"I will confess my transgressions to the LORD.\" *\n\nThen you forgave me the guilt of my sin. 7 Therefore all the faithful will make their prayers to you in\n\ntime of trouble; *\n\nwhen the great waters overflow, they shall not reach them. 8 You are my hiding-place;\n\nyou preserve me from trouble; *\n\nyou surround me with shouts of deliverance. 9 \"I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you\n\nshould go; *\n\nI will guide you with my eye. 10 Do not be like horse or mule, which have no understanding; *\n\nwho must be fitted with bit and bridle,\n\nor else they will not stay near you.\" 11 Great are the tribulations of the wicked; *\n\nbut mercy embraces those who trust in the LORD. 12 Be glad, you righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; *\n\nshout for joy, all who are true of heart.\n\n33 Exultate, justi 1 Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; *\n\nit is good for the just to sing praises. 2 Praise the LORD with the harp; *\n\nplay to him upon the psaltery and lyre. 3 Sing for him a new song; *\n\nsound a fanfare with all your skill upon the trumpet. 4 For the word of the LORD is right, *\n\nand all his works are sure. 5 He loves righteousness and justice; *\n\nthe loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth. 6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, *\n\nby the breath of his mouth all the heavenly hosts. 7 He gathers up the waters of the ocean as in a water-skin *\n\nand stores up the depths of the sea. 8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; *\n\nlet all who dwell in the world stand in awe of him. 9 For he spoke, and it came to pass; *\n\nhe commanded, and it stood fast. 10 The LORD brings the will of the nations to naught; *\n\nhe thwarts the designs of the peoples. 11 But the LORD'S will stands fast for ever, *\n\nand the designs of his heart from age to age. 12 Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD! *\n\nhappy the people he has chosen to be his own!\n\n13 The LORD looks down from heaven, *\n\nand beholds all the people in the world. 14 From where he sits enthroned he turns his gaze *\n\non all who dwell on the earth. 15 He fashions all the hearts of them *\n\nand understands all their works. 16 There is no king that can be saved by a mighty army; *\n\na strong man is not delivered by his great strength. 17 The horse is a vain hope for deliverance; *\n\nfor all its strength it cannot save. 18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him, *\n\non those who wait upon his love, 19 To pluck their lives from death, *\n\nand to feed them in time of famine. 20 Our soul waits for the LORD; *\n\nhe is our help and our shield. 21 Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, *\n\nfor in his holy Name we put our trust. 22 Let your loving-kindness, O LORD, be upon us, *\n\nas we have put our trust in you. 34 Benedicam Dominum 1 I will bless the LORD at all times; *\n\nhis praise shall ever be in my mouth. 2 I will glory in the LORD; *\n\nlet the humble hear and rejoice. 3 Proclaim with me the greatness of the LORD; *\n\nlet us exalt his Name together.\n\n4 I sought the LORD, and he answered me *\n\nand delivered me out of all my terror. 5 Look upon him and be radiant, *\n\nand let not your faces be ashamed. 6 I called in my affliction and the LORD heard me *\n\nand saved me from all my troubles. 7 The angel of the LORD encompasses those who fear him, *\n\nand he will deliver them. 8 Taste and see that the LORD is good; *\n\nhappy are they who trust in him! 9 Fear the LORD, you that are his saints, *\n\nfor those who fear him lack nothing. 10 The young lions lack and suffer hunger, *\n\nbut those who seek the LORD lack nothing that is good. 11 Come, children, and listen to me; *\n\nI will teach you the fear of the LORD. 12 Who among you loves life *\n\nand desires long life to enjoy prosperity? 13 Keep your tongue from evil-speaking *\n\nand your lips from lying words. 14 Turn from evil and do good; *\n\nseek peace and pursue it. 15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, *\n\nand his ears are open to their cry. 16 The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, *\n\nto root out the remembrance of them from the earth.\n\n17 The righteous cry, and the LORD hears them *\n\nand delivers them from all their troubles. 18 The LORD is near to the brokenhearted *\n\nand will save those whose spirits are crushed. 19 Many are the troubles of the righteous, *\n\nbut the LORD will deliver him out of them all. 20 He will keep safe all his bones; *\n\nnot one of them shall be broken. 21 Evil shall slay the wicked, *\n\nand those who hate the righteous will be punished. 22 The LORD ransoms the life of his servants, *\n\nand none will be punished who trust in him. Seventh Day: Morning Prayer 35 Judica, Domine 1 Fight those who fight me, O LORD; *\n\nattack those who are attacking me. 2 Take up shield and armor *\n\nand rise up to help me. 3 Draw the sword and bar the way against those\n\nwho pursue me; *\n\nsay to my soul, \"I am your salvation.\" 4 Let those who seek after my life be shamed and humbled; *\n\nlet those who plot my ruin fall back and be dismayed. 5 Let them be like chaff before the wind, *\n\nand let the angel of the LORD drive them away.\n\n6 Let their way be dark and slippery, *\n\nand let the angel of the LORD pursue them. 7 For they have secretly spread a net for me without a cause; *\n\nwithout a cause they have dug a pit to take me alive. 8 Let ruin come upon them unawares; *\n\nlet them be caught in the net they hid;\n\nlet them fall into the pit they dug. 9 Then I will be joyful in the LORD; *\n\nI will glory in his victory. 10 My very bones will say, \"LORD, who is like you? *\n\nYou deliver the poor from those who are too strong for them,\n\nthe poor and needy from those who rob them.\" 11 Malicious witnesses rise up against me; *\n\nthey charge me with matters I know nothing about. 12 They pay me evil in exchange for good; *\n\nmy soul is full of despair. 13 But when they were sick I dressed in sack-cloth *\n\nand humbled myself by fasting. 14 I prayed with my whole heart,\n\nas one would for a friend or a brother; *\n\nI behaved like one who mourns for his mother,\n\nbowed down and grieving. 15 But when I stumbled, they were glad and gathered together;\n\nthey gathered against me; *\n\nstrangers whom I did not know tore me to pieces and\n\nwould not stop. 16 They put me to the test and mocked me; *\n\nthey gnashed at me with their teeth.\n\n17 O Lord, how long will you look on? *\n\nrescue me from the roaring beasts,\n\nand my life from the young lions. 18 I will give you thanks in the great congregation; *\n\nI will praise you in the mighty throng. 19 Do not let my treacherous foes rejoice over me, *\n\nnor let those who hate me without a cause\n\nwink at each other. 20 For they do not plan for peace, *\n\nbut invent deceitful schemes against the\n\nquiet in the land. 21 They opened their mouths at me and said, *\n\n\"Aha! we saw it with our own eyes.\" 22 You saw it, O LORD; do not be silent; *\n\nO Lord, be not far from me. 23 Awake, arise, to my cause! *\n\nto my defense, my God and my Lord! 24 Give me justice, O LORD my God,\n\naccording to your righteousness; *\n\ndo not let them triumph over me. 25 Do not let them say in their hearts,\n\n\"Aha! just what we want!\" *\n\nDo not let them say, \"We have swallowed him up.\" 26 Let all who rejoice at my ruin be ashamed and disgraced; *\n\nlet those who boast against me be clothed with\n\ndismay and shame. 27 Let those who favor my cause sing out with joy and be glad; *\n\nlet them say always, \"Great is the LORD,\n\nwho desires the prosperity of his servant.\"\n\n28 And my tongue shall be talking of your righteousness *\n\nand of your praise all the day long. 36 Dixit injustus 1 There is a voice of rebellion deep in the heart of the wicked; *\n\nthere is no fear of God before his eyes. 2 He flatters himself in his own eyes *\n\nthat his hateful sin will not be found out. 3 The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; *\n\nhe has left off acting wisely and doing good. 4 He thinks up wickedness upon his bed\n\nand has set himself in no good way; *\n\nhe does not abhor that which is evil. 5 Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, *\n\nand your faithfulness to the clouds. 6 Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,\n\nyour justice like the great deep; *\n\nyou save both man and beast, O LORD. 7 How priceless is your love, O God! *\n\nyour people take refuge under the\n\nshadow of your wings. 8 They feast upon the abundance of your house; *\n\nyou give them drink from the river of your delights. 9 For with you is the well of life, *\n\nand in your light we see light. 10 Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, *\n\nand your favor to those who are true of heart.\n\n11 Let not the foot of the proud come near me, *\n\nnor the hand of the wicked push me aside. 12 See how they are fallen, those who work wickedness! *\n\nthey are cast down and shall not be able to rise. Seventh Day: Evening Prayer 37 Part I Noli Ã¦mulari 1 Do not fret yourself because of evildoers; *\n\ndo not be jealous of those who do wrong. 2 For they shall soon wither like the grass, *\n\nand like the green grass fade away. 3 Put your trust in the LORD and do good; *\n\ndwell in the land and feed on its riches. 4 Take delight in the LORD, *\n\nand he shall give you your heart's desire. 5 Commit your way to the LORD and put your trust in him, *\n\nand he will bring it to pass. 6 He will make your righteousness as clear as the light *\n\nand your just dealing as the noonday. 7 Be still before the LORD *\n\nand wait patiently for him. 8 Do not fret yourself over the one who prospers, *\n\nthe one who succeeds in evil schemes. 9 Refrain from anger, leave rage alone; *\n\ndo not fret yourself; it leads only to evil.\n\n10 For evildoers shall be cut off, *\n\nbut those who wait upon the LORD shall possess the land. 11 In a little while the wicked shall be no more; *\n\nyou shall search out their place, but they will not be there. 12 But the lowly shall possess the land; *\n\nthey will delight in abundance of peace. 13 The wicked plot against the righteous *\n\nand gnash at them with their teeth. 14 The Lord laughs at the wicked, *\n\nbecause he sees that their day will come. 15 The wicked draw their sword and bend their bow\n\nto strike down the poor and needy, *\n\nto slaughter those who are upright in their ways. 16 Their sword shall go through their own heart, *\n\nand their bow shall be broken. 17 The little that the righteous has *\n\nis better than great riches of the wicked. 18 For the power of the wicked shall be broken, *\n\nbut the LORD upholds the righteous. Psalm 37: Part II Novit Dominus 19 The LORD cares for the lives of the godly, *\n\nand their inheritance shall last for ever. 20 They shall not be ashamed in bad times, *\n\nand in days of famine they shall have enough. 21 As for the wicked, they shall perish, *\n\nand the enemies of the LORD, like the glory of\n\nthe meadows, shall vanish;\n\nthey shall vanish like smoke.\n\n22 The wicked borrow and do not repay, *\n\nbut the righteous are generous in giving. 23 Those who are blessed by God shall possess the land, *\n\nbut those who are cursed by him shall be destroyed. 24 Our steps are directed by the LORD; *\n\nhe strengthens those in whose way he delights. 25 If they stumble, they shall not fall headlong, *\n\nfor the LORD holds them by the hand. 26 I have been young and now I am old, *\n\nbut never have I seen the righteous forsaken,\n\nor their children begging bread. 27 The righteous are always generous in their lending, *\n\nand their children shall be a blessing. 28 Turn from evil, and do good, *\n\nand dwell in the land for ever. 29 For the LORD loves justice; *\n\nhe does not forsake his faithful ones. 30 They shall be kept safe for ever, *\n\nbut the offspring of the wicked shall be destroyed. 31 The righteous shall possess the land *\n\nand dwell in it for ever. 32 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, *\n\nand their tongue speaks what is right. 33 The law of their God is in their heart, *\n\nand their footsteps shall not falter. 34 The wicked spy on the righteous *\n\nand seek occasion to kill them.\n\n35 The LORD will not abandon them to their hand, *\n\nnor let them be found guilty when brought to trial. 36 Wait upon the LORD and keep his way; *\n\nhe will raise you up to possess the land,\n\nand when the wicked are cut off, you will see it. 37 I have seen the wicked in their arrogance, *\n\nflourishing like a tree in full leaf. 38 I went by, and behold, they were not there; *\n\nI searched for them, but they could not be found. 39 Mark those who are honest;\n\nobserve the upright; *\n\nfor there is a future for the peaceable. 40 Transgressors shall be destroyed, one and all; *\n\nthe future of the wicked is cut off. 41 But the deliverance of the righteous comes from the LORD; *\n\nhe is their stronghold in time of trouble. 42 The LORD will help them and rescue them; *\n\nhe will rescue them from the wicked and deliver them,\n\nbecause they seek refuge in him. Eighth Day: Morning Prayer 38 Domine, ne in furore 1 O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger; *\n\ndo not punish me in your wrath. 2 For your arrows have already pierced me, *\n\nand your hand presses hard upon me.\n\n3 There is no health in my flesh,\n\nbecause of your indignation; *\n\nthere is no soundness in my body, because of my sin. 4 For my iniquities overwhelm me; *\n\nlike a heavy burden they are too much for me to bear. 5 My wounds stink and fester *\n\nby reason of my foolishness. 6 I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; *\n\nI go about in mourning all the day long. 7 My loins are filled with searing pain; *\n\nthere is no health in my body. 8 I am utterly numb and crushed; *\n\nI wail, because of the groaning of my heart. 9 O Lord, you know all my desires, *\n\nand my sighing is not hidden from you. 10 My heart is pounding, my strength has failed me, *\n\nand the brightness of my eyes is gone from me. 11 My friends and companions draw back from my affliction; *\n\nmy neighbors stand afar off. 12 Those who seek after my life lay snares for me; *\n\nthose who strive to hurt me speak of my ruin\n\nand plot treachery all the day long. 13 But I am like the deaf who do not hear, *\n\nlike those who are mute and who do not open their mouth. 14 I have become like one who does not hear *\n\nand from whose mouth comes no defense. 15 For in you, O LORD, have I fixed my hope; *\n\nyou will answer me, O Lord my God.\n\n16 For I said, \"Do not let them rejoice at my expense, *\n\nthose who gloat over me when my foot slips.\" 17 Truly, I am on the verge of falling, *\n\nand my pain is always with me. 18 I will confess my iniquity *\n\nand be sorry for my sin. 19 Those who are my enemies without cause are mighty, *\n\nand many in number are those who wrongfully hate me. 20 Those who repay evil for good slander me, *\n\nbecause I follow the course that is right. 21 O LORD, do not forsake me; *\n\nbe not far from me, O my God. 22 Make haste to help me, *\n\nO Lord of my salvation. 39 Dixi, Custodiam 1 I said, \"I will keep watch upon my ways, *\n\nso that I do not offend with my tongue. 2 I will put a muzzle on my mouth *\n\nwhile the wicked are in my presence.\" 3 So I held my tongue and said nothing; *\n\nI refrained from rash words;\n\nbut my pain became unbearable. 4 My heart was hot within me;\n\nwhile I pondered, the fire burst into flame; *\n\nI spoke out with my tongue:\n\n5 LORD, let me know my end and the number of my days, *\n\nso that I may know how short my life is. 6 You have given me a mere handful of days,\n\nand my lifetime is as nothing in your sight; *\n\ntruly, even those who stand erect are but a puff of wind. 7 We walk about like a shadow,\n\nand in vain we are in turmoil; *\n\nwe heap up riches and cannot tell who will gather them. 8 And now, what is my hope? *\n\nO Lord, my hope is in you. 9 Deliver me from all my transgressions *\n\nand do not make me the taunt of the fool. 10 I fell silent and did not open my mouth, *\n\nfor surely it was you that did it. 11 Take your affliction from me; *\n\nI am worn down by the blows of your hand. 12 With rebukes for sin you punish us;\n\nlike a moth you eat away all that is dear to us; *\n\ntruly, everyone is but a puff of wind. 13 Hear my prayer, O LORD,\n\nand give ear to my cry; *\n\nhold not your peace at my tears. 14 For I am but a sojourner with you, *\n\na wayfarer, as all my forebears were. 15 Turn your gaze from me, that I may be glad again, *\n\nbefore I go my way and am no more.\n\n40 Expectans, expectavi 1 I waited patiently upon the LORD; *\n\nhe stooped to me and heard my cry. 2 He lifted me out of the desolate pit, out of the mire and clay; *\n\nhe set my feet upon a high cliff and made my footing sure. 3 He put a new song in my mouth,\n\na song of praise to our God; *\n\nmany shall see, and stand in awe,\n\nand put their trust in the LORD. 4 Happy are they who trust in the LORD! *\n\nthey do not resort to evil spirits or turn to false gods. 5 Great things are they that you have done, O LORD my God!\n\nhow great your wonders and your plans for us! *\n\nthere is none who can be compared with you. 6 Oh, that I could make them known and tell them! *\n\nbut they are more than I can count. 7 In sacrifice and offering you take no pleasure *\n\n(you have given me ears to hear you); 8 Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required, *\n\nand so I said, \"Behold, I come. 9 In the roll of the book it is written concerning me: *\n\n'I love to do your will, O my God;\n\nyour law is deep in my heart.'\" 10 I proclaimed righteousness in the great congregation; *\n\nbehold, I did not restrain my lips;\n\nand that, O LORD, you know. 11 Your righteousness have I not hidden in my heart;\n\nI have spoken of your faithfulness and your deliverance; *\n\nI have not concealed your love and faithfulness from the\n\ngreat congregation.\n\n12 You are the LORD;\n\ndo not withhold your compassion from me; *\n\nlet your love and your faithfulness keep me safe for ever, 13 For innumerable troubles have crowded upon me;\n\nmy sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see; *\n\nthey are more in number than the hairs of my head,\n\nand my heart fails me. 14 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; *\n\nO LORD, make haste to help me. 15 Let them be ashamed and altogether dismayed\n\nwho seek after my life to destroy it; *\n\nlet them draw back and be disgraced\n\nwho take pleasure in my misfortune. 16 Let those who say \"Aha!\" and gloat over me be confounded, *\n\nbecause they are ashamed. 17 Let all who seek you rejoice in you and be glad; *\n\nlet those who love your salvation continually say,\n\nGreat is the LORD!\" 18 Though I am poor and afflicted, *\n\nthe Lord will have regard for me. 19 You are my helper and my deliverer; *\n\ndo not tarry, O my God. Eighth Day: Evening Prayer 41 Beatus qui intelligit 1 Happy are they who consider the poor and needy! *\n\nthe LORD will deliver them in the time of trouble.\n\n2 The LORD preserves them and keeps them alive,\n\nso that they may be happy in the land; *\n\nhe does not hand them over to the will of their enemies. 3 The LORD sustains them on their sickbed *\n\nand ministers to them in their illness. 4 I said, \"LORD, be merciful to me; *\n\nheal me, for I have sinned against you.\" 5 My enemies are saying wicked things about me: *\n\nWhen will he die, and his name perish?\" 6 Even if they come to see me, they speak empty words; *\n\ntheir heart collects false rumors;\n\nthey go outside and spread them. 7 All my enemies whisper together about me *\n\nand devise evil against me. 8 \"A deadly thing,\" they say, \"has fastened on him; *\n\nhe has taken to his bed and will never get up again.\" 9 Even my best friend, whom I trusted,\n\nwho broke bread with me, *\n\nhas lifted up his heel and turned against me. 10 But you, O LORD, be merciful to me and raise me up, *\n\nand I shall repay them. 11 By this I know you are pleased with me, *\n\nthat my enemy does not triumph over me. 12 In my integrity you hold me fast, *\n\nand shall set me before your face for ever. 13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, *\n\nfrom age to age. Amen. Amen.\n\nBook Two 42 Quemadmodum 1 As the deer longs for the water-brooks, *\n\nso longs my soul for you, O God. 2 My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God; *\n\nwhen shall I come to appear before the presence of God? 3 My tears have been my food day and night, *\n\nwhile all day long they say to me,\n\n\"Where now is your God?\" 4 I pour out my soul when I think on these things; *\n\nhow I went with the multitude and led them into the\n\nhouse of God, 5 With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, *\n\namong those who keep holy-day. 6 Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *\n\nand why are you so disquieted within me? 7 Put your trust in God; *\n\nfor I will yet give thanks to him,\n\nwho is the help of my countenance, and my God. 8 My soul is heavy within me; *\n\ntherefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan,\n\nand from the peak of Mizar among the heights of Hermon. 9 One deep calls to another in the noise of your cataracts; *\n\nall your rapids and floods have gone over me. 10 The LORD grants his loving-kindness in the daytime; *\n\nin the night season his song is with me,\n\na prayer to the God of my life.\n\n11 I will say to the God of my strength,\n\n\"Why have you forgotten me? *\n\nand why do I go so heavily while the enemy\n\noppresses me?\" 12 While my bones are being broken, *\n\nmy enemies mock me to my face; 13 All day long they mock me *\n\nand say to me, \"Where now is your God?\" 14 Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *\n\nand why are you so disquieted within me? 15 Put your trust in God; *\n\nfor I will yet give thanks to him,\n\nwho is the help of my countenance, and my God. 43 Judica me, Deus 1 Give judgment for me, O God,\n\nand defend my cause against an ungodly people; *\n\ndeliver me from the deceitful and the wicked. 2 For you are the God of my strength;\n\nwhy have you put me from you? *\n\nand why do I go so heavily while the enemy\n\noppresses me? 3 Send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, *\n\nand bring me to your holy hill\n\nand to your dwelling; 4 That I may go to the altar of God,\n\nto the God of my joy and gladness; *\n\nand on the harp I will give thanks to you, O God my God.\n\n5 Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *\n\nand why are you so disquieted within me? 6 Put your trust in God; *\n\nfor I will yet give thanks to him,\n\nwho is the help of my countenance, and my God. Ninth Day: Morning Prayer 44 Deus, auribus 1 We have heard with our ears, O God,\n\nour forefathers have told us, *\n\nthe deeds you did in their days,\n\nin the days of old. 2 How with your hand you drove the peoples out\n\nand planted our forefathers in the land; *\n\nhow you destroyed nations and made your people flourish. 3 For they did not take the land by their sword,\n\nnor did their arm win the victory for them; *\n\nbut your right hand, your arm, and the\n\nlight of your countenance,\n\nbecause you favored them. 4 You are my King and my God; *\n\nyou command victories for Jacob. 5 Through you we pushed back our adversaries; *\n\nthrough your Name we trampled on those who\n\nrose up against us. 6 For I do not rely on my bow, *\n\nand my sword does not give me the victory. 7 Surely, you gave us victory over our adversaries *\n\nand put those who hate us to shame.\n\n8 Every day we gloried in God, *\n\nand we will praise your Name for ever. 9 Nevertheless, you have rejected and humbled us *\n\nand do not go forth with our armies. 10 You have made us fall back before our adversary, *\n\nand our enemies have plundered us. 11 You have made us like sheep to be eaten *\n\nand have scattered us among the nations. 12 You are selling your people for a trifle *\n\nand are making no profit on the sale of them. 13 You have made us the scorn of our neighbors, *\n\na mockery and derision to those around us. 14 You have made us a byword among the nations, *\n\na laughing-stock among the peoples. 15 My humiliation is daily before me, *\n\nand shame has covered my face; 16 Because of the taunts of the mockers and blasphemers, *\n\nbecause of the enemy and avenger. 17 All this has come upon us; *\n\nyet we have not forgotten you,\n\nnor have we betrayed your covenant. 18 Our heart never turned back, *\n\nnor did our footsteps stray from your path; 19 Though you thrust us down into a place of misery, *\n\nand covered us over with deep darkness. 20 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, *\n\nor stretched out our hands to some strange god, 21 Will not God find it out? *\n\nfor he knows the secrets of the heart.\n\n22 Indeed, for your sake we are killed all the day long; *\n\nwe are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 23 Awake, O Lord! why are you sleeping? *\n\nArise! do not reject us for ever. 24 Why have you hidden your face *\n\nand forgotten our affliction and oppression? 25 We sink down into the dust; *\n\nour body cleaves to the ground. 26 Rise up, and help us, *\n\nand save us, for the sake of your steadfast love. 45 Eructavit cor meum 1 My heart is stirring with a noble song;\n\nlet me recite what I have fashioned for the king; *\n\nmy tongue shall be the pen of a skilled writer. 2 You are the fairest of men; *\n\ngrace flows from your lips,\n\nbecause God has blessed you for ever. 3 Strap your sword upon your thigh, O mighty warrior, *\n\nin your pride and in your majesty. 4 Ride out and conquer in the cause of truth *\n\nand for the sake of justice. 5 Your right hand will show you marvelous things; *\n\nyour arrows are very sharp, O mighty warrior. 6 The peoples are falling at your feet, *\n\nand the king's enemies are losing heart.\n\n7 Your throne, O God, endures for ever and ever, *\n\na scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom;\n\nyou love righteousness and hate iniquity. 8 Therefore God, your God, has anointed you *\n\nwith the oil of gladness above your fellows. 9 All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, *\n\nand the music of strings from ivory palaces makes you glad. 10 Kings' daughters stand among the ladies of the court; *\n\non your right hand is the queen,\n\nadorned with the gold of Ophir. 11 \"Hear, O daughter; consider and listen closely; *\n\nforget your people and your father's house. 12 The king will have pleasure in your beauty; *\n\nhe is your master; therefore do him honor. 13 The people of Tyre are here with a gift; *\n\nthe rich among the people seek your favor.\" 14 All glorious is the princess as she enters; *\n\nher gown is cloth-of-gold. 15 In embroidered apparel she is brought to the king; *\n\nafter her the bridesmaids follow in procession. 16 With joy and gladness they are brought, *\n\nand enter into the palace of the king. 17 \"In place of fathers, O king, you shall have sons; *\n\nyou shall make them princes over all the earth. 18 I will make your name to be remembered\n\nfrom one generation to another; *\n\ntherefore nations will praise you for ever and ever.\"\n\n46 Deus noster refugium 1 God is our refuge and strength, *\n\na very present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth be moved, *\n\nand though the mountains be toppled into the\n\ndepths of the sea; 3 Though its waters rage and foam, *\n\nand though the mountains tremble at its tumult. 4 The LORD of hosts is with us; *\n\nthe God of Jacob is our stronghold. 5 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, *\n\nthe holy habitation of the Most High. 6 God is in the midst of her;\n\nshe shall not be overthrown; *\n\nGod shall help her at the break of day. 7 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are shaken; *\n\nGod has spoken, and the earth shall melt away. 8 The LORD of hosts is with us; *\n\nthe God of Jacob is our stronghold. 9 Come now and look upon the works of the LORD, *\n\nwhat awesome things he has done on earth. 10 It is he who makes war to cease in all the world; *\n\nhe breaks the bow, and shatters the spear,\n\nand burns the shields with fire.\n\n11 \"Be still, then, and know that I am God; *\n\nI will be exalted among the nations;\n\nI will be exalted in the earth.\" 12 The LORD of hosts is with us; *\n\nthe God of Jacob is our stronghold. Ninth Day: Evening Prayer 47 Omnes gentes, plaudite 1 Clap your hands, all you peoples; *\n\nshout to God with a cry of joy. 2 For the LORD Most High is to be feared; *\n\nhe is the great King over all the earth. 3 He subdues the peoples under us, *\n\nand the nations under our feet. 4 He chooses our inheritance for us, *\n\nthe pride of Jacob whom he loves. 5 God has gone up with a shout, *\n\nthe LORD with the sound of the ram's-horn. 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises; *\n\nsing praises to our King, sing praises. 7 For God is King of all the earth; *\n\nsing praises with all your skill. 8 God reigns over the nations; *\n\nGod sits upon his holy throne. 9 The nobles of the peoples have gathered together *\n\nwith the people of the God of Abraham. 10 The rulers of the earth belong to God, *\n\nand he is highly exalted.\n\n48 Magnus Dominus 1 Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; *\n\nin the city of our God is his holy hill. 2 Beautiful and lofty, the joy of all the earth, is the\n\nhill of Zion, *\n\nthe very center of the world and the city of the great King. 3 God is in her citadels; *\n\nhe is known to be her sure refuge. 4 Behold, the kings of the earth assembled *\n\nand marched forward together. 5 They looked and were astounded; *\n\nthey retreated and fled in terror. 6 Trembling seized them there; *\n\nthey writhed like a woman in childbirth,\n\nlike ships of the sea when the east wind shatters them. 7 As we have heard, so have we seen,\n\nin the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; *\n\nGod has established her for ever. 8 We have waited in silence on your loving-kindness, O God, *\n\nin the midst of your temple. 9 Your praise, like your Name, O God, reaches to\n\nthe world's end; *\n\nyour right hand is full of justice. 10 Let Mount Zion be glad\n\nand the cities of Judah rejoice, *\n\nbecause of your judgments. 11 Make the circuit of Zion;\n\nwalk round about her; *\n\ncount the number of her towers.\n\n12 Consider well her bulwarks;\n\nexamine her strongholds; *\n\nthat you may tell those who come after. 13 This God is our God for ever and ever; *\n\nhe shall be our guide for evermore. 49 Audite hÃ¦c, omnes 1 Hear this, all you peoples;\n\nhearken, all you who dwell in the world, *\n\nyou of high degree and low, rich and poor together. 2 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, *\n\nand my heart shall meditate on understanding. 3 I will incline my ear to a proverb *\n\nand set forth my riddle upon the harp. 4 Why should I be afraid in evil days, *\n\nwhen the wickedness of those at my heels surrounds me, 5 The wickedness of those who put their trust in their goods, *\n\nand boast of their great riches? 6 We can never ransom ourselves, *\n\nor deliver to God the price of our life; 7 For the ransom of our life is so great, *\n\nthat we should never have enough to pay it, 8 In order to live for ever and ever, *\n\nand never see the grave. 9 For we see that the wise die also;\n\nlike the dull and stupid they perish *\n\nand leave their wealth to those who come after them.\n\n10 Their graves shall be their homes for ever,\n\ntheir dwelling places from generation to generation, *\n\nthough they call the lands after their own names. 11 Even though honored, they cannot live for ever; *\n\nthey are like the beasts that perish. 12 Such is the way of those who foolishly trust in themselves, *\n\nand the end of those who delight in their own words. 13 Like a flock of sheep they are destined to die;\n\nDeath is their shepherd; *\n\nthey go down straightway to the grave. 14 Their form shall waste away, *\n\nand the land of the dead shall be their home. 15 But God will ransom my life; *\n\nhe will snatch me from the grasp of death. 16 Do not be envious when some become rich, *\n\nor when the grandeur of their house increases; 17 For they will carry nothing away at their death, *\n\nnor will their grandeur follow them. 18 Though they thought highly of themselves while they lived, *\n\nand were praised for their success, 19 They shall join the company of their forebears, *\n\nwho will never see the light again. 20 Those who are honored, but have no understanding, *\n\nare like the beasts that perish.\n\nTenth Day: Morning Prayer 50 Deus deorum 1 The LORD, the God of gods, has spoken; *\n\nhe has called the earth from the rising of the sun to\n\nits setting. 2 Out of Zion, perfect in its beauty, *\n\nGod reveals himself in glory. 3 Our God will come and will not keep silence; *\n\nbefore him there is a consuming flame,\n\nand round about him a raging storm. 4 He calls the heavens and the earth from above *\n\nto witness the judgment of his people. 5 \"Gather before me my loyal followers, *\n\nthose who have made a covenant with me\n\nand sealed it with sacrifice.\" 6 Let the heavens declare the rightness of his cause; *\n\nfor God himself is judge. 7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak:\n\n\"O Israel, I will bear witness against you; *\n\nfor I am God, your God. 8 I do not accuse you because of your sacrifices; *\n\nyour offerings are always before me. 9 I will take no bull-calf from your stalls, *\n\nnor he-goats out of your pens; 10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, *\n\nthe herds in their thousands upon the hills.\n\n11 I know every bird in the sky, *\n\nand the creatures of the fields are in my sight. 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, *\n\nfor the whole world is mine and all that is in it. 13 Do you think I eat the flesh of bulls, *\n\nor drink the blood of goats? 14 Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving *\n\nand make good your vows to the Most High. 15 Call upon me in the day of trouble; *\n\nI will deliver you, and you shall honor me.\" 16 But to the wicked God says: *\n\nWhy do you recite my statutes,\n\nand take my covenant upon your lips; 17 Since you refuse discipline, *\n\nand toss my words behind your back? 18 When you see a thief, you make him your friend, *\n\nand you cast in your lot with adulterers. 19 You have loosed your lips for evil, *\n\nand harnessed your tongue to a lie. 20 You are always speaking evil of your brother *\n\nand slandering your own mother's son. 21 These things you have done, and I kept still, *\n\nand you thought that I am like you.\" 22 \"I have made my accusation; *\n\nI have put my case in order before your eyes. 23 Consider this well, you who forget God, *\n\nlest I rend you and there be none to deliver you.\n\n24 Whoever offers me the sacrifice of thanksgiving\n\nhonors me; *\n\nbut to those who keep in my way will I show\n\nthe salvation of God.\" 51 Miserere mei, Deus 1 Have mercy on me, O God, according to your\n\nloving-kindness; *\n\nin your great compassion blot out my offenses. 2 Wash me through and through from my wickedness *\n\nand cleanse me from my sin. 3 For I know my transgressions, *\n\nand my sin is ever before me. 4 Against you only have I sinned *\n\nand done what is evil in your sight. 5 And so you are justified when you speak *\n\nand upright in your judgment. 6 Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, *\n\na sinner from my mother's womb. 7 For behold, you look for truth deep within me, *\n\nand will make me understand wisdom secretly. 8 Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; *\n\nwash me, and I shall be clean indeed. 9 Make me hear of joy and gladness, *\n\nthat the body you have broken may rejoice. 10 Hide your face from my sins *\n\nand blot out all my iniquities.\n\n11 Create in me a clean heart, O God, *\n\nand renew a right spirit within me. 12 Cast me not away from your presence *\n\nand take not your holy Spirit from me. 13 Give me the joy of your saving help again *\n\nand sustain me with your bountiful Spirit. 14 I shall teach your ways to the wicked, *\n\nand sinners shall return to you. 15 Deliver me from death, O God, *\n\nand my tongue shall sing of your righteousness,\n\nO God of my salvation. 16 Open my lips, O Lord, *\n\nand my mouth shall proclaim your praise. 17 Had you desired it, I would have offered sacrifice, *\n\nbut you take no delight in burnt-offerings. 18 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; *\n\na broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. 19 Be favorable and gracious to Zion, *\n\nand rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. 20 Then you will be pleased with the appointed sacrifices,\n\nwith burnt-offerings and oblations; *\n\nthen shall they offer young bullocks upon your altar. 52 Quid gloriaris? 1 You tyrant, why do you boast of wickedness *\n\nagainst the godly all day long?\n\n2 You plot ruin;\n\nyour tongue is like a sharpened razor, *\n\nO worker of deception. 3 You love evil more than good *\n\nand lying more than speaking the truth. 4 You love all words that hurt, *\n\nO you deceitful tongue. 5 Oh, that God would demolish you utterly, *\n\ntopple you, and snatch you from your dwelling,\n\nand root you out of the land of the living! 6 The righteous shall see and tremble, *\n\nand they shall laugh at him, saying, 7 \"This is the one who did not take God for a refuge, *\n\nbut trusted in great wealth\n\nand relied upon wickedness.\" 8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; *\n\nI trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. 9 I will give you thanks for what you have done *\n\nand declare the goodness of your Name in the presence\n\nof the godly. Tenth Day: Evening Prayer 53 Dixit insipiens 1 The fool has said in his heart, \"There is no God.\" *\n\nAll are corrupt and commit abominable acts;\n\nthere is none who does any good.\n\n2 God looks down from heaven upon us all, *\n\nto see if there is any who is wise,\n\nif there is one who seeks after God. 3 Every one has proved faithless;\n\nall alike have turned bad; *\n\nthere is none who does good; no, not one. 4 Have they no knowledge, those evildoers *\n\nwho eat up my people like bread\n\nand do not call upon God? 5 See how greatly they tremble,\n\nsuch trembling as never was; *\n\nfor God has scattered the bones of the enemy;\n\nthey are put to shame, because God has rejected them. 6 Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *\n\nwhen God restores the fortunes of his people\n\nJacob will rejoice and Israel be glad. 54 Deus, in nomine 1 Save me, O God, by your Name; *\n\nin your might, defend my cause. 2 Hear my prayer, O God; *\n\ngive ear to the words of my mouth. 3 For the arrogant have risen up against me,\n\nand the ruthless have sought my life, *\n\nthose who have no regard for God. 4 Behold, God is my helper; *\n\nit is the Lord who sustains my life. 5 Render evil to those who spy on me; *\n\nin your faithfulness, destroy them.\n\n6 I will offer you a freewill sacrifice *\n\nand praise your Name, O LORD, for it is good. 7 For you have rescued me from every trouble, *\n\nand my eye has seen the ruin of my foes. 55 Exaudi, Deus 1 Hear my prayer, O God; *\n\ndo not hide yourself from my petition. 2 Listen to me and answer me; *\n\nI have no peace, because of my cares. 3 I am shaken by the noise of the enemy *\n\nand by the pressure of the wicked; 4 For they have cast an evil spell upon me *\n\nand are set against me in fury. 5 My heart quakes within me, *\n\nand the terrors of death have fallen upon me. 6 Fear and trembling have come over me, *\n\nand horror overwhelms me. 7 And I said, \"Oh, that I had wings like a dove! *\n\nI would fly away and be at rest. 8 I would flee to a far-off place *\n\nand make my lodging in the wilderness. 9 I would hasten to escape *\n\nfrom the stormy wind and tempest.\" 10 Swallow them up, O Lord;\n\nconfound their speech; *\n\nfor I have seen violence and strife in the city.\n\n11 Day and night the watchmen make their rounds\n\nupon her walls, *\n\nbut trouble and misery are in the midst of her. 12 There is corruption at her heart; *\n\nher streets are never free of oppression and deceit. 13 For had it been an adversary who taunted me,\n\nthen I could have borne it; *\n\nor had it been an enemy who vaunted himself against me,\n\nthen I could have hidden from him. 14 But it was you, a man after my own heart, *\n\nmy companion, my own familiar friend. 15 We took sweet counsel together, *\n\nand walked with the throng in the house of God. 16 Let death come upon them suddenly;\n\nlet them go down alive to the grave; *\n\nfor wickedness is in their dwellings, in their very midst. 17 But I will call upon God, *\n\nand the LORD will deliver me. 18 In the evening, in the morning, and at noonday,\n\nI will complain and lament, *\n\nand he will hear my voice. 19 He will bring me safely back from the battle\n\nwaged against me; *\n\nfor there are many who fight me. 20 God, who is enthroned of old, will hear me and\n\nbring them down; *\n\nthey never change; they do not fear God. 21 My companion stretched forth his hand against his comrade; *\n\nhe has broken his covenant.\n\n22 His speech is softer than butter, *\n\nbut war is in his heart. 23 His words are smoother than oil, *\n\nbut they are drawn swords. 24 Cast your burden upon the LORD,\n\nand he will sustain you; *\n\nhe will never let the righteous stumble. 25 For you will bring the bloodthirsty and deceitful *\n\ndown to the pit of destruction, O God. 26 They shall not live out half their days, *\n\nbut I will put my trust in you. Eleventh Day: Morning Prayer 56 Miserere mei, Deus 1 Have mercy on me, O God,\n\nfor my enemies are hounding me; *\n\nall day long they assault and oppress me. 2 They hound me all the day long; *\n\ntruly there are many who fight against me, O Most High. 3 Whenever I am afraid, *\n\nI will put my trust in you. 4 In God, whose word I praise,\n\nin God I trust and will not be afraid, *\n\nfor what can flesh do to me? 5 All day long they damage my cause; *\n\ntheir only thought is to do me evil.\n\n6 They band together; they lie in wait; *\n\nthey spy upon my footsteps;\n\nbecause they seek my life. 7 Shall they escape despite their wickedness? *\n\nO God, in your anger, cast down the peoples. 8 You have noted my lamentation;\n\nput my tears into your bottle; *\n\nare they not recorded in your book? 9 Whenever I call upon you, my enemies will be put to flight; *\n\nthis I know, for God is on my side. 10 In God the LORD, whose word I praise,\n\nin God I trust and will not be afraid, *\n\nfor what can mortals do to me? 11 I am bound by the vow I made to you, O God; *\n\nI will present to you thank-offerings; 12 For you have rescued my soul from death and my feet\n\nfrom stumbling, *\n\nthat I may walk before God in the light of the living. 57 Miserere mei, Deus 1 Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful,\n\nfor I have taken refuge in you; *\n\nin the shadow of your wings will I take refuge\n\nuntil this time of trouble has gone by. 2 I will call upon the Most High God, *\n\nthe God who maintains my cause. 3 He will send from heaven and save me;\n\nhe will confound those who trample upon me; *\n\nGod will send forth his love and his faithfulness.\n\n4 I lie in the midst of lions that devour the people; *\n\ntheir teeth are spears and arrows,\n\ntheir tongue a sharp sword. 5 They have laid a net for my feet,\n\nand I am bowed low; *\n\nthey have dug a pit before me,\n\nbut have fallen into it themselves. 6 Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, *\n\nand your glory over all the earth. 7 My heart is firmly fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; *\n\nI will sing and make melody. 8 Wake up, my spirit;\n\nawake, lute and harp; *\n\nI myself will waken the dawn. 9 I will confess you among the peoples, O LORD; *\n\nI will sing praise to you among the nations. 10 For your loving-kindness is greater than the heavens, *\n\nand your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 11 Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, *\n\nand your glory over all the earth. 58 Si vere utique 1 Do you indeed decree righteousness, you rulers? *\n\ndo you judge the peoples with equity? 2 No; you devise evil in your hearts, *\n\nand your hands deal out violence in the land. 3 The wicked are perverse from the womb; *\n\nliars go astray from their birth.\n\n4 They are as venomous as a serpent, *\n\nthey are like the deaf adder which stops its ears, 5 Which does not heed the voice of the charmer, *\n\nno matter how skillful his charming. 6 O God, break their teeth in their mouths; *\n\npull the fangs of the young lions, O LORD. 7 Let them vanish like water that runs off; *\n\nlet them wither like trodden grass. 8 Let them be like the snail that melts away, *\n\nlike a stillborn child that never sees the sun. 9 Before they bear fruit, let them be cut down like a brier; *\n\nlike thorns and thistles let them be swept away. 10 The righteous will be glad when they see the vengeance; *\n\nthey will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked. 11 And they will say,\n\n\"Surely, there is a reward for the righteous; *\n\nsurely, there is a God who rules in the earth.\" Eleventh Day: Evening Prayer 59 Eripe me de inimicis 1 Rescue me from my enemies, O God; *\n\nprotect me from those who rise up against me. 2 Rescue me from evildoers *\n\nand save me from those who thirst for my blood. 3 See how they lie in wait for my life,\n\nhow the mighty gather together against me; *\n\nnot for any offense or fault of mine, O LORD.\n\n4 Not because of any guilt of mine *\n\nthey run and prepare themselves for battle. 5 Rouse yourself, come to my side, and see; *\n\nfor you, LORD God of hosts, are Israel's God. 6 Awake, and punish all the ungodly; *\n\nshow no mercy to those who are faithless and evil. 7 They go to and fro in the evening; *\n\nthey snarl like dogs and run about the city. 8 Behold, they boast with their mouths,\n\nand taunts are on their lips; *\n\n\"For who,\" they say, \"will hear us?\" 9 But you, O LORD, you laugh at them; *\n\nyou laugh all the ungodly to scorn. 10 My eyes are fixed on you, O my Strength; *\n\nfor you, O God, are my stronghold. 11 My merciful God comes to meet me; *\n\nGod will let me look in triumph on my enemies. 12 Slay them, O God, lest my people forget; *\n\nsend them reeling by your might\n\nand put them down, O Lord our shield. 13 For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips,\n\nfor the cursing and lies that they utter, *\n\nlet them be caught in their pride. 14 Make an end of them in your wrath; *\n\nmake an end of them, and they shall be no more. 15 Let everyone know that God rules in Jacob, *\n\nand to the ends of the earth. 16 They go to and fro in the evening; *\n\nthey snarl like dogs and run about the city.\n\n17 They forage for food, *\n\nand if they are not filled, they howl. 18 For my part, I will sing of your strength; *\n\nI will celebrate your love in the morning; 19 For you have become my stronghold, *\n\na refuge in the day of my trouble. 20 To you, O my Strength, will I sing; *\n\nfor you, O God, are my stronghold and my merciful God. 60 Deus, repulisti nos 1 O God, you have cast us off and broken us; *\n\nyou have been angry;\n\noh, take us back to you again. 2 You have shaken the earth and split it open; *\n\nrepair the cracks in it, for it totters. 3 You have made your people know hardship; *\n\nyou have given us wine that makes us stagger. 4 You have set up a banner for those who fear you, *\n\nto be a refuge from the power of the bow. 5 Save us by your right hand and answer us, *\n\nthat those who are dear to you may be delivered. 6 God spoke from his holy place and said: *\n\n\"I will exult and parcel out Shechem;\n\nI will divide the valley of Succoth. 7 Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine; *\n\nEphraim is my helmet and Judah my scepter.\n\n8 Moab is my wash-basin,\n\non Edom I throw down my sandal to claim it, *\n\nand over Philistia will I shout in triumph.\" 9 Who will lead me into the strong city? *\n\nwho will bring me to Edom? 10 Have you not cast us off, O God? *\n\nyou no longer go out, O God, with our armies. 11 Grant us your help against the enemy, *\n\nfor vain is the help of man. 12 With God we will do valiant deeds, *\n\nand he shall tread our enemies under foot. 61 Exaudi, Deus 1 Hear my cry, O God, *\n\nand listen to my prayer. 2 I call upon you from the ends of the earth\n\nwith heaviness in my heart; *\n\nset me upon the rock that is higher than I. 3 For you have been my refuge, *\n\na strong tower against the enemy. 4 I will dwell in your house for ever; *\n\nI will take refuge under the cover of your wings. 5 For you, O God, have heard my vows; *\n\nyou have granted me the heritage of those\n\nwho fear your Name. 6 Add length of days to the king's life; *\n\nlet his years extend over many generations.\n\n7 Let him sit enthroned before God for ever; *\n\nbid love and faithfulness watch over him. 8 So will I always sing the praise of your Name, *\n\nand day by day I will fulfill my vows. Twelfth Day: Morning Prayer 62 Nonne Deo? 1 For God alone my soul in silence waits; *\n\nfrom him comes my salvation. 2 He alone is my rock and my salvation, *\n\nmy stronghold, so that I shall not be greatly shaken. 3 How long will you assail me to crush me,\n\nall of you together, *\n\nas if you were a leaning fence, a toppling wall? 4 They seek only to bring me down from my place of honor; *\n\nlies are their chief delight. 5 They bless with their lips, *\n\nbut in their hearts they curse. 6 For God alone my soul in silence waits; *\n\ntruly, my hope is in him. 7 He alone is my rock and my salvation, *\n\nmy stronghold, so that I shall not be shaken. 8 In God is my safety and my honor; *\n\nGod is my strong rock and my refuge. 9 Put your trust in him always, O people, *\n\npour out your hearts before him, for God is our refuge.\n\n10 Those of high degree are but a fleeting breath, *\n\neven those of low estate cannot be trusted. 11 On the scales they are lighter than a breath, *\n\nall of them together. 12 Put no trust in extortion;\n\nin robbery take no empty pride; *\n\nthough wealth increase, set not your heart upon it. 13 God has spoken once, twice have I heard it, *\n\nthat power belongs to God. 14 Steadfast love is yours, O Lord, *\n\nfor you repay everyone according to his deeds. 63 Deus, Deus meus 1 O God, you are my God; eagerly I seek you; *\n\nmy soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you,\n\nas in a barren and dry land where there is no water. 2 Therefore I have gazed upon you in your holy place, *\n\nthat I might behold your power and your glory. 3 For your loving-kindness is better than life itself; *\n\nmy lips shall give you praise. 4 So will I bless you as long as I live *\n\nand lift up my hands in your Name. 5 My soul is content, as with marrow and fatness, *\n\nand my mouth praises you with joyful lips, 6 When I remember you upon my bed, *\n\nand meditate on you in the night watches. 7 For you have been my helper, *\n\nand under the shadow of your wings I will rejoice.\n\n8 My soul clings to you; *\n\nyour right hand holds me fast. 9 May those who seek my life to destroy it *\n\ngo down into the depths of the earth; 10 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, *\n\nand let them be food for jackals. 11 But the king will rejoice in God;\n\nall those who swear by him will be glad; *\n\nfor the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped. 64 Exaudi, Deus 1 Hear my voice, O God, when I complain; *\n\nprotect my life from fear of the enemy. 2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, *\n\nfrom the mob of evildoers. 3 They sharpen their tongue like a sword, *\n\nand aim their bitter words like arrows, 4 That they may shoot down the blameless from ambush; *\n\nthey shoot without warning and are not afraid. 5 They hold fast to their evil course; *\n\nthey plan how they may hide their snares. 6 They say, \"Who will see us?\n\nwho will find out our crimes? *\n\nwe have thought out a perfect plot.\" 7 The human mind and heart are a mystery; *\n\nbut God will loose an arrow at them,\n\nand suddenly they will be wounded.\n\n8 He will make them trip over their tongues, *\n\nand all who see them will shake their heads. 9 Everyone will stand in awe and declare God's deeds; *\n\nthey will recognize his works. 10 The righteous will rejoice in the LORD and put their trust in him, *\n\nand all who are true of heart will glory. Twelfth Day: Evening Prayer 65 Te decet hymnus 1 You are to be praised, O God, in Zion; *\n\nto you shall vows be performed in Jerusalem. 2 To you that hear prayer shall all flesh come, *\n\nbecause of their transgressions. 3 Our sins are stronger than we are, *\n\nbut you will blot them out. 4 Happy are they whom you choose\n\nand draw to your courts to dwell there! *\n\nthey will be satisfied by the beauty of your house,\n\nby the holiness of your temple. 5 Awesome things will you show us in your righteousness,\n\nO God of our salvation, *\n\nO Hope of all the ends of the earth\n\nand of the seas that are far away. 6 You make fast the mountains by your power; *\n\nthey are girded about with might. 7 You still the roaring of the seas, *\n\nthe roaring of their waves,\n\nand the clamor of the peoples.\n\n8 Those who dwell at the ends of the earth will tremble at your\n\nmarvelous signs; *\n\nyou make the dawn and the dusk to sing for joy. 9 You visit the earth and water it abundantly;\n\nyou make it very plenteous; *\n\nthe river of God is full of water. 10 You prepare the grain, *\n\nfor so you provide for the earth. 11 You drench the furrows and smooth out the ridges; *\n\nwith heavy rain you soften the ground and bless its increase. 12 You crown the year with your goodness, *\n\nand your paths overflow with plenty. 13 May the fields of the wilderness be rich for grazing, *\n\nand the hills be clothed with joy. 14 May the meadows cover themselves with flocks,\n\nand the valleys cloak themselves with grain; *\n\nlet them shout for joy and sing. 66 Jubilate Deo 1 Be joyful in God, all you lands; *\n\nsing the glory of his Name;\n\nsing the glory of his praise. 2 Say to God, \"How awesome are your deeds! *\n\nbecause of your great strength your enemies\n\ncringe before you. 3 All the earth bows down before you, *\n\nsings to you, sings out your Name.\"\n\n4 Come now and see the works of God, *\n\nhow wonderful he is in his doing toward all people. 5 He turned the sea into dry land,\n\nso that they went through the water on foot, *\n\nand there we rejoiced in him. 6 In his might he rules for ever;\n\nhis eyes keep watch over the nations; *\n\nlet no rebel rise up against him. 7 Bless our God, you peoples; *\n\nmake the voice of his praise to be heard; 8 Who holds our souls in life, *\n\nand will not allow our feet to slip. 9 For you, O God, have proved us; *\n\nyou have tried us just as silver is tried. 10 You brought us into the snare; *\n\nyou laid heavy burdens upon our backs. 11 You let enemies ride over our heads;\n\nwe went through fire and water; *\n\nbut you brought us out into a place of refreshment. 12 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings\n\nand will pay you my vows, *\n\nwhich I promised with my lips\n\nand spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble. 13 I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts\n\nwith the smoke of rams; *\n\nI will give you oxen and goats. 14 Come and listen, all you who fear God, *\n\nand I will tell you what he has done for me.\n\n15 I called out to him with my mouth, *\n\nand his praise was on my tongue. 16 If I had found evil in my heart, *\n\nthe Lord would not have heard me; 17 But in truth God has heard me; *\n\nhe has attended to the voice of my prayer. 18 Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, *\n\nnor withheld his love from me. 67 Deus misereatur 1 May God be merciful to us and bless us, *\n\nshow us the light of his countenance and come to us. 2 Let your ways be known upon earth, *\n\nyour saving health among all nations. 3 Let the peoples praise you, O God; *\n\nlet all the peoples praise you. 4 Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, *\n\nfor you judge the peoples with equity\n\nand guide all the nations upon earth. 5 Let the peoples praise you, O God; *\n\nlet all the peoples praise you. 6 The earth has brought forth her increase; *\n\nmay God, our own God, give us his blessing. 7 May God give us his blessing, *\n\nand may all the ends of the earth stand in awe of him.\n\nThirteenth Day: Morning Prayer 68 Exsurgat Deus 1 Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; *\n\nlet those who hate him flee before him. 2 Let them vanish like smoke when the wind drives it away; *\n\nas the wax melts at the fire, so let the wicked perish at\n\nthe presence of God. 3 But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; *\n\nlet them also be merry and joyful. 4 Sing to God, sing praises to his Name;\n\nexalt him who rides upon the heavens; *\n\nYAHWEH is his Name, rejoice before him! 5 Father of orphans, defender of widows, *\n\nGod in his holy habitation! 6 God gives the solitary a home and brings forth prisoners\n\ninto freedom; *\n\nbut the rebels shall live in dry places. 7 O God, when you went forth before your people, *\n\nwhen you marched through the wilderness, 8 The earth shook, and the skies poured down rain,\n\nat the presence of God, the God of Sinai, *\n\nat the presence of God, the God of Israel. 9 You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon your inheritance; *\n\nyou refreshed the land when it was weary. 10 Your people found their home in it; *\n\nin your goodness, O God, you have made provision\n\nfor the poor.\n\n11 The Lord gave the word; *\n\ngreat was the company of women who bore the tidings: 12 \"Kings with their armies are fleeing away; *\n\nthe women at home are dividing the spoils.\" 13 Though you lingered among the sheepfolds, *\n\nyou shall be like a dove whose wings are covered with silver,\n\nwhose feathers are like green gold. 14 When the Almighty scattered kings, *\n\nit was like snow falling in Zalmon. 15 O mighty mountain, O hill of Bashan! *\n\nO rugged mountain, O hill of Bashan! 16 Why do you look with envy, O rugged mountain,\n\nat the hill which God chose for his resting place? *\n\ntruly, the LORD will dwell there for ever. 17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand,\n\neven thousands of thousands; *\n\nthe Lord comes in holiness from Sinai. 18 You have gone up on high and led captivity captive;\n\nyou have received gifts even from your enemies, *\n\nthat the LORD God might dwell among them. 19 Blessed be the Lord day by day, *\n\nthe God of our salvation, who bears our burdens"
