        "text": "Selected Recordings\n\nLes Indes galantes: Chaconne\n\nPlatée, La Folie\n\nGavotte with 6 variations on piano\n\nSelected Sheet Music\n\nLaboravi clamans\n\nSource: CPDL.org\n\nShowcase Piece\n\nLes Cyclopes: Harpsichord Solo\n\nNotes and Commentary\n\n“With Jean-Philipe Rameau, the golden age of French classical opera is at hand. Lully was the founder of the French opera, and in essence Rameau’s operas were an extension of Lully, and not a departure. This fact makes all the more ridiculous the bitter war raged against Rameau by the Lully faction, which came to regard Rameau as an arch enemy, the negation of what Lully stood for and accomplished.”—David Ewen, The Complete Book of Classical Music\n\n“Top early French harpsichord genius, theorist, and opera specialist”—Phil Goulding, Classical Music\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the Baroque era. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside François Couperin.\n\nLittle is known about Rameau’s early years, and it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony (1722). He was almost 50 before he embarked on the operatic career on which his reputation chiefly rests. His debut, Hippolyte Et Aricie (1733), caused a great stir and was fiercely attacked for its revolutionary use of harmony by the supporters of Lully’s style of music.\n\nNevertheless, Rameau’s pre-eminence in the field of French opera was soon acknowledged, and he was later attacked as an “establishment” composer by those who favoured Italian opera during the controversy known as the Querelle des Bouffons in the 1750s. Rameau’s music had gone out of fashion by the end of the 18th century, and it was not until the 20th that serious efforts were made to revive it. Today, he enjoys renewed appreciation with performances and recordings of his music ever more frequent. He lived from September 25, 1683, to September 12, 1764.—Excerpted from Wikipedia\n\nBooks and Music\n\nSelected Books\n\nTreatise on Harmony\n\nDover Books on Music, 1971\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau\n\n$13.59 at Amazon\n\n“The importance of this work in the history of music would be hard to overestimate. While later music theorists and analysts, such as Schenker, find this emphasis on chords to be destructive to the horizontal considerations that make a great work hold together, this work has influenced so many people that even those that do not even know his name but talk about root position chords and their inversions are invoking his concepts without realizing the source.”—Craig Matteson on Amazon\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau: His Life and Work\n\nCuthbert Girdlestone\n\nDover Publications, 1990\n\n$31.01 used\n\n“OK, this is unquestionably a major book on Rameau, if not THE major work. So let’s get that out of the way. Masterful, scholarly, detailed and analytical, it’s a must. But, Rameau gave us more than most people know. First of all, he codified harmony for centuries to come. . . . The Baroque started with harmony in flux, and by the time it was over, there were certain progressions and cadences that had become established, and that still make sense today. . . . And Rameau was the man who set it down. His treatises are hard reading, and I suspect still not fully understood. And here is a basic problem with Girdlestone. In such a thick book, 600 pages, how can you fail to even try [to talk about this]? He mentions that others have covered the subject, and backs out at the outset of a brief chapter in which he mainly teeters on the verge of calling Rameau a crank. And that is not very deep or adventurous for what aims to be a definitive book on Rameau.”—Fernand Raynaud on Amazon\n\nSelected Music\n\nLes Fetes d’Hebe (1998) , 2-CD set\n\nUne Symphonie Imaginaire (2005) , 1 CD\n\nOvertures (1997) , 1 CD\n\nComplete Works\n\nThe following list is excerpted from Wikipedia.\n\nRCT numbering refers to Rameau Catalogue Thématique established by Sylvie Bouissou and Denis Herlin.\n\nInstrumental works\n\nPièces de clavecin.
