        "text": "‘I got out my copy of volume 1 recently – it was easy to find, which proves that it gets played quite frequently and hasn’t disappeared into the limbo of lost CDs at the back of the cupboard and was just as pleased with it as when I first reviewed it. That goes equally for its successor. Roll on the third and final volume – let’s not have to wait another four years, please.’\n\n—Brian Wilson, MusicWeb International\n\n‘Gutman does a creative and rather exacting job of performing the often tortuous lines of the huge Indes galantes suite. The use of ornamentation is precise and replicates that of the original in a way that does not detract from the sometimes dramatic and lyrical lines of the work. His tempos are suitably variable, emphasizing the various sentiments and descriptive movements. […]\n\nthe disc with a modern instrument has a certain resonance for everyone else, and this is largely due to Gutman’s sensitive playing. One might even suggest that Rameau himself would have been pleased with the result, and certainly pianists who wonder if his harpsichord pieces could ever make a successful transition to the pianoforte will find that this disc proves that they indeed can. Given the nice initial volume and this one, the third in the set should prove extremely useful.’\n\n—Bertil van Boer, Fanfare Magazine September/October 2013"
