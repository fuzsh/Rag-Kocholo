        "text": "Jean-Philippe Rameau Returns to Paris\n\nI later returned to Paris in 1723. It was at that time I began to write stage music when Alexis Piron approached me. He asked me to write music for his comedies.\n\nI wrote four musical tragedies based on Alexis Piron’s stage writing. They included:\n\n1. Samson\n\n2. Linus\n\n3. Les courses de Tempe\n\n4. Lisis et Delie\n\nAlthough I later reused some of the music for other projects, most of the tragedies never made it to the stage, primarily due to censorship, as in Samson’s case.\n\nDespite Voltaire’s declaration that he was finished with operas, shortly afterward, he began work on the libretto of Pandore and enlisted me to help. However, I found this opera work hard to finish, as the storyline lost interest after the first act and left me very little energy to continue writing the music for Pandore. The score was left unfinished.\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau’s Opera, Hippolyte et Aricie\n\nOnce my collaboration with Voltaire seemed to come to a standstill, Poupliniere organized for the Abbe Pellegrin to provide me with a text based on Phedre-Hippolyte Aricie in 1732. Hippolyte et Aricie came naturally to me.\n\n“I have been a follower of the stage since I was twelve years old. I only began work on an opera when I was fifty; I still didn’t think I was capable; I tried my hand, I was lucky, I continued.”\n\nLittle did I know that its first performance at the Opera on October 1, 1733, would catapult my career. The audience’s reception was split: one side was filled with admiration for such innovative work, while the other saw it as a personal attack on traditional French music.\n\nDue to the controversy, Hippolyte failed, especially when Jean-Baptiste Lully’s followers began claiming it went against all of Lully’s ideals and beliefs. His followers were worried I would replace Lully as France’s favorite composer of the time, or so it was rumored. I was not discouraged by the lack of Hippolyte’s commercial success.\n\nThen suddenly the Ramelian aesthetic played havoc with the confidence of the French in their patrimony, assaulted their national opera that they hoped was unchangeable.”\n\nIn response to the rumors and the debate, I said, “I sought to imitate Lully, not as a servile copyist but in taking, like him, nature herself — so beautiful and so simple — as a model.” The controversy lifted my popularity in the public eye.\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau’s Opera, Les Indes Galantes\n\nMy second opera was Les Indes Galantes, which I composed purely for public entertainment. The libretto by Louis Fuzelier tells the story of the Grand Vizier Topal Osman Pasha: “who was so well known for his extreme generosity.”\n\n[It] “was based on a story published in the Mercure de Suisse in September 1734 concerning a Marseillais merchant, Vincent Arniaud, who saved a young Ottoman notable from slavery in Malta, and the unstinting gratitude and generosity returned by this young man, who later became Grand Vizier Topal Osman Pasha.”\n\nLes Indes Galantes met a not-so-favorable reception on August 23, 1735 at the Academie Royal de Musique. Even though it ran for twenty-eight performances, I pulled it and chose to revise it. When it debuted again less than six months later, it received a more enthusiastic reception.\n\nDiderot, a supporter of mine (who later took his support elsewhere), said, “Old Lully is simple, natural, even, too even sometimes, and this is a defect. Young Rameau is singular, brilliant, complex, learned, too learned sometimes; but this is perhaps a defect on the listeners.”\n\nCastor et Pollux was successful. It was seen, later, as my best work.\n\nCuthbert Girdlestone said, “From the extreme dreaminess of the original Act IV, the tragic lament of Iphise and… of Dardanus on the one hand, to the martial or demoniac power of the duet of Act I, the magician’s chorus, the fury chorus, ‘Dardanus gemit’ and… ‘Le despoir et la rage,’ in Act III… there runs a tremendous range of feeling and all points along the scale are marked by first-rate music.”\n\nI later revised Dardanus in 1744, rewriting the last three acts and adding simplicity to the story. The revised version premiered in Paris on April 23, 1744.\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau’s Collaborations & Commissions\n\n1745 marked a turning point in my career. The Royal Court commissioned me to compose celebratory music for victory battles or marriages due to my newfound popularity.\n\nPlatee was a comedic opera based on the libretto by Adrian-Joseph Le Valois d’Orville. It was my first attempt at comedy and commissioned for the wedding of Prince Louis and Maria Theresa of Spain. It premiered at Versailles on March 31, 1745, to a great reception.\n\nLa Princesse de Navarre was composed alongside Voltaire and commissioned for the wedding, too. Although Voltaire believed the commission was not good enough for me, I wrote the music, which was well-received.\n\nVoltaire, however, said, “Poor Rameau is mad… Rameau is as great an eccentric as he is a musician.” He had many complaints about our collaboration, including, “the ceiling was so high that the actors appeared pygmies and they couldn’t be heard.” After the work became a huge success, Voltaire fell silent.\n\n“If I were twenty years younger, I would go to Italy, and take Pergolesi for my model, abandon something of my harmony and devote myself to attaining truth of declamation, which should be the sole guide of musicians. But after sixty-one [I] cannot change; experience points plainly enough to best course, but the mind refuses to obey.”\n\nThis quarrel was later named le guerre des bouffons. I won that fight, just like I had against the Lullists.\n\nThe Illness and Death of Jean-Philippe Rameau\n\nAfter the quarrel, I confined myself to home. I wrote two more operas in that time and other smaller pieces but began to struggle.\n\n“The imagination is worn out in my old head, it’s not wise at this age wanting to practice arts that are nothing but imagination.”\n\nUnfortunately, I became unwell with typhoid fever and died shortly after on September 12, 1764.\n\nMy last words were, “What the devil do you mean to sing to me, priest? You are out of tune.”\n\nI was buried at St. Eustache in Paris the same day I passed, and although my burial site remains a secret, a bronze bust atop a tombstone marks a likely spot.\n\nPlease find compelling quotes of Jean-Philippe Rameau here on his quotes page.\n\nSOURCES:"
