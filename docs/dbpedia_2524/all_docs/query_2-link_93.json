And I was held spellbound.Â Then I asked an angel, âWho are these, my lord?âÂ He answered and said to me, âThese are they who have put off mortal clothing and have put on the immortal, and have confessed the name of God. Now they are being crowned, and receive palms.âÂ Then I said to the angel, âWho is that young man who is placing crowns on them and putting palms in their hands?âÂ He answered and said to me, âHe is the Son of God, whom they confessed in the world.â So I began to praise those who had stood valiantly for the name of the Lord.Â Then the angel said to me, âGo, tell my people how great and how many are the wonders of the Lord God that you have seen.â\n\nDaniel 3:13â25\n\nNebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought in; so they brought those men before the king. Nebuchadnezzar said to them, âIs it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods and you do not worship the golden statue that I have set up? Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, drum, and entire musical ensemble to fall down and worship the statue that I have made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire, and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?â Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, âO Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to present a defense to you in this matter. If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire and out of your hand, O king, let him deliver us. But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods and we will not worship the golden statue that you have set up.â\n\nThen Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face was distorted. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times more than was customary, and ordered some of the strongest guards in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. So the men were bound, still wearing their tunics, their trousers, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire. Because the kingâs command was urgent and the furnace was so overheated, the raging flames killed the men who lifted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. But the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire. Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up quickly. He said to his counselors, âWas it not three men that we threw bound into the fire?â They answered the king, âTrue, O king.â He replied, âBut I see four men unbound, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the fourth has the appearance of a god.â\n\nDaniel 6:10â16\n\nAlthough Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he continued to go to his house, which had windows in its upper room open toward Jerusalem, and to get down on his knees three times a day to pray to his God and praise him, just as he had done previously.\n\nThe conspirators came and found Daniel praying and seeking mercy before his God. Then they approached the king and said concerning the interdict, âO king! Did you not sign an interdict, that anyone who prays to anyone, divine or human, within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be thrown into a den of lions?â The king answered, âThe thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.â Then they responded to the king, âDaniel, one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the interdict you have signed, but he is saying his prayers three times a day.â When the king heard the charge, he was very much distressed. He was determined to save Daniel, and until the sun went down he made every effort to rescue him. Then the conspirators came to the king and said to him, âKnow, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no interdict or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.â Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, âMay your God, whom you faithfully serve, deliver you!â\n\nHabakkuk 2:9â14\n\nâAlas for you who get evil gain for your houses,\n\nsetting your nest on high\n\nto be safe from the reach of harm!â\n\nYou have devised shame for your house\n\nby cutting off many peoples;\n\nyou have forfeited your life.\n\nThe very stones will cry out from the wall,\n\nand the plaster will respond from the woodwork.\n\nâAlas for you who build a town by bloodshed,\n\nand found a city on iniquity!â\n\nIs it not from the Lord of hosts\n\nthat peoples labour only to feed the flames,\n\nand nations weary themselves for nothing?\n\nBut the earth will be filled\n\nwith the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,\n\nas the waters cover the sea.\n\nIsaiah 44:21â26a\n\nRemember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for you are my servant; I formed you, you are my servant; O Israel, you will not be forgotten by me. I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like mist; return to me, for I have redeemed you. Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done it; shout, O depths of the earth; break forth into singing, O mountains, O forest, and every tree in it! For the Lord has redeemed Jacob, and will be glorified in Israel. Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the Lord, who made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who by myself spread out the earth; who frustrates the omens of liars, and makes fools of diviners; who turns back the wise, and makes their knowledge foolish; who confirms the word of his servant, and fulfills the prediction of his messengers.\n\nIsaiah 53:8â12\n\nBy a perversion of justice he was taken away.\n\nWho could have imagined his future?\n\nFor he was cut off from the land of the living,\n\nstricken for the transgression of my people.\n\nThey made his grave with the wicked\n\nand his tomb with the rich,\n\nalthough he had done no violence,\n\nand there was no deceit in his mouth.\n\nYet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain.\n\nWhen you make his life an offering for sin,\n\nhe shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;\n\nthrough him the will of the Lord shall prosper.\n\nOut of his anguish he shall see light;\n\nhe shall find satisfaction through his knowledge.\n\nThe righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous,\n\nand he shall bear their iniquities.\n\nTherefore I will allot him a portion with the great,\n\nand he shall divide the spoil with the strong;\n\nbecause he poured out himself to death,\n\nand was numbered with the transgressors;\n\nyet he bore the sin of many,\n\nand made intercession for the transgressors.\n\nJeremiah 12:1â3a\n\nYou will be in the right, O Lord,\n\nwhen I lay charges against you;\n\nbut let me put my case to you.\n\nWhy does the way of the guilty prosper?\n\nWhy do all who are treacherous thrive?\n\nYou plant them, and they take root;\n\nthey grow and bring forth fruit;\n\nyou are near in their mouths\n\nyet far from their hearts.\n\nBut you, O Lord, know me;\n\nYou see me and test meâmy heart is with you.\n\nPull them out like sheep for the slaughter,\n\nand set them apart for the day of slaughter.\n\nJeremiah 15:15-21\n\nO Lord, you know;\n\nremember me and visit me,\n\nand bring down retribution for me on my persecutors.\n\nIn your forbearance do not take me away;\n\nknow that on your account I suffer insult.\n\nYour words were found, and I ate them,\n\nand your words became to me a joy\n\nand the delight of my heart;\n\nfor I am called by your name,\n\nO Lord, God of hosts.\n\nI did not sit in the company of merrymakers,\n\nnor did I rejoice;\n\nunder the weight of your hand I sat alone,\n\nfor you had filled me with indignation.\n\nWhy is my pain unceasing,\n\nmy wound incurable,\n\nrefusing to be healed?\n\nTruly, you are to me like a deceitful brook,\n\nlike waters that fail.\n\nTherefore, thus says the Lord:\n\nIf you turn back, I will take you back,\n\nand you shall stand before me.\n\nIf you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless,\n\nyou shall serve as my mouth.\n\nIt is they who will turn to you,\n\nnot you who will turn to them.\n\nAnd I will make you to this people\n\na fortified wall of bronze;\n\nthey will fight against you,\n\nbut they shall not prevail over you,\n\nfor I am with you\n\nto save you and deliver you,\n\nsays the Lord.\n\nI will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked,\n\nand redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.\n\nJob 16:6â10\n\nâIf I speak, my pain is not assuaged,\n\nand if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?\n\nSurely now God has worn me out;\n\nhe has made desolate all my company.\n\nAnd he has shrivelled me up,\n\nwhich is a witness against me;\n\nmy leanness has risen up against me,\n\nand it testifies to my face.\n\nHe has torn me in his wrath, and hated me;\n\nhe has gnashed his teeth at me;\n\nmy adversary sharpens his eyes against me.\n\nThey have gaped at me with their mouths;\n\nthey have struck me insolently on the cheek;\n\nthey mass themselves together against me.â\n\nSirach (Ecclesiasticus) 51:1â12\n\nI give you thanks, O Lord and King,\n\nand praise you, O God my Saviour.\n\nI give thanks to your name,\n\nfor you have been my protector and helper\n\nand have delivered me from destruction\n\nand from the trap laid by a slanderous tongue,\n\nfrom lips that fabricate lies.\n\nIn the face of my adversaries\n\nyou have been my helper and delivered me,\n\nin the greatness of your mercy and of your name,\n\nfrom grinding teeth about to devour me,\n\nfrom the hand of those seeking my life,\n\nfrom the many troubles I endured,\n\nfrom choking fire on every side,\n\nand from the midst of fire that I had not kindled,\n\nfrom the deep belly of Hades,\n\nfrom an unclean tongue and lying wordsâ\n\nthe slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king.\n\nMy soul drew near to death,\n\nand my life was on the brink of Hades below.\n\nThey surrounded me on every side,\n\nand there was no one to help me;\n\nI looked for human assistance,\n\nand there was none.\n\nThen I remembered your mercy, O Lord,\n\nand your kindness from of old,\n\nfor you rescue those who wait for you\n\nand save them from the hand of their enemies.\n\nAnd I sent up my prayer from the earth,\n\nand begged for rescue from death.\n\nI cried out, âLord, you are my Father;\n\ndo not forsake me in the days of trouble,\n\nwhen there is no help against the proud.\n\nI will praise your name continually,\n\nand will sing hymns of thanksgiving.â\n\nMy prayer was heard,\n\nfor you saved me from destruction\n\nand rescued me in time of trouble.\n\nFor this reason I thank you and praise you,\n\nand I bless the name of the Lord.\n\nThe Psalm\n\nPsalm 31:1â5\n\nIn te, Domine, speravi\n\n1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge;\n\nlet me never be put to shame; *\n\ndeliver me in your righteousness.\n\n2 Incline your ear to me; *\n\nmake haste to deliver me.\n\n3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,\n\nfor you are my crag and my stronghold; *\n\nfor the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.\n\n4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *\n\nfor you are my tower of strength.\n\n5 Into your hands I commend my spirit, *\n\nfor you have redeemed me,\n\nO Lord, O God of truth.\n\nPsalm 44:20â26\n\nDeus, auribus\n\n20 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, *\n\nor stretched out our hands to some strange god,\n\n21 Will not God find it out? *\n\nfor he knows the secrets of the heart.\n\n22 Indeed, for your sake we are killed all the day long; *\n\nwe are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.\n\n23 Awake, O Lord! why are you sleeping? *\n\nArise! do not reject us for ever.\n\n24 Why have you hidden your face *\n\nand forgotten our affliction and oppression?\n\n25 We sink down into the dust; *\n\nour body cleaves to the ground.\n\n26 Rise up, and help us, *\n\nand save us, for the sake of your steadfast love.\n\nPsalm 116 or 116:1â8\n\nDilexi, quoniam\n\n1 I love the Lord, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *\n\nbecause he has inclined his ear to me whenever I called upon him.\n\n2 The cords of death entangled me;\n\nthe grip of the grave took hold of me; *\n\nI came to grief and sorrow.\n\n3 Then I called upon the Name of the Lord: *\n\n\"O Lord, I pray you, save my life.\"\n\n4 Gracious is the Lord and righteous; *\n\nour God is full of compassion.\n\n5 The Lord watches over the innocent; *\n\nI was brought very low, and he helped me.\n\n6 Turn again to your rest, O my soul, *\n\nfor the Lord has treated you well.\n\n7 For you have rescued my life from death, *\n\nmy eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.\n\n8 I will walk in the presence of the Lord *\n\nin the land of the living.\n\n9 [I believed, even when I said,\n\n\"I have been brought very low.\" *\n\nIn my distress I said, \"No one can be trusted.\"\n\n10 How shall I repay the Lord *\n\nfor all the good things he has done for me?\n\n11 I will lift up the cup of salvation *\n\nand call upon the Name of the Lord.\n\n12 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord *\n\nin the presence of all his people.\n\n13 Precious in the sight of the Lord *\n\nis the death of his servants.\n\n14 O Lord, I am your servant; *\n\nI am your servant and the child of your handmaid;\n\nyou have freed me from my bonds.\n\n15 I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving *\n\nand call upon the Name of the Lord.\n\n16 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord *\n\nin the presence of all his people,\n\n17 In the courts of the Lord'S house, *\n\nin the midst of you, O Jerusalem.\n\nHallelujah!]\n\nPsalm 121\n\nLevavi oculos\n\n1 I lift up my eyes to the hills; *\n\nfrom where is my help to come?\n\n2 My help comes from the Lord, *\n\nthe maker of heaven and earth.\n\n3 He will not let your foot be moved *\n\nand he who watches over you will not fall asleep.\n\n4 Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel *\n\nshall neither slumber nor sleep;\n\n5 The Lord himself watches over you; *\n\nthe Lord is your shade at your right hand,\n\n6 So that the sun shall not strike you by day, *\n\nnor the moon by night.\n\n7 The Lord shall preserve you from all evil; *\n\nit is he who shall keep you safe.\n\n8 The Lord shall watch over your going out and your coming in, *\n\nfrom this time forth for evermore.\n\nPsalm 124\n\nNisi quia Dominus\n\n1 If the Lord had not been on our side, *\n\nlet Israel now say;\n\n2 If the Lord had not been on our side, *\n\nwhen enemies rose up against us;\n\n3 Then would they have swallowed us up alive *\n\nin their fierce anger toward us;\n\n4 Then would the waters have overwhelmed us *\n\nand the torrent gone over us;\n\n5 Then would the raging waters *\n\nhave gone right over us.\n\n6 Blessed be the Lord! *\n\nhe has not given us over to be a prey for their teeth.\n\n7 We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; *\n\nthe snare is broken, and we have escaped.\n\n8 Our help is in the Name of the Lord, *\n\nthe maker of heaven and earth.\n\nPsalm 126\n\nIn convertendo\n\n1 When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, *\n\nthen were we like those who dream.\n\n2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *\n\nand our tongue with shouts of joy.\n\n3 Then they said among the nations, *\n\n\"The Lord has done great things for them.\"\n\n4 The Lord has done great things for us, *\n\nand we are glad indeed.\n\n5 Restore our fortunes, O Lord, *\n\nlike the watercourses of the Negev.\n\n6 Those who sowed with tears *\n\nwill reap with songs of joy.\n\n7 Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *\n\nwill come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.\n\nThe New Testament\n\nRomans 12:14â21\n\nBless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; do not claim to be wiser than you are. Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all. If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God; for it is written, âVengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.â No, âif your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads.â Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\n\n2 Corinthians 6:2bâ10\n\nSee, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are putting no obstacle in anyoneâs way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and seeâwe are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.\n\n2 Timothy 2:8â13; 3:10â12\n\nRemember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of Davidâthat is my gospel, for which I suffer hardship, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. The saying is sure: If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us; if we are faithless, he remains faithfulâ for he cannot deny himself.\n\nNow you have observed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and suffering the things that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them. Indeed, all who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.\n\nHebrews 10:32â36\n\nRecall those earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion for those who were in prison, and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting. Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward. For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.\n\n1 Peter 3:14â18,22\n\nEven if you do suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear, and do not be intimidated, but in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and reverence. Keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are maligned, those who abuse you for your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing good, if suffering should be Godâs will, than to suffer for doing evil.\n\nFor Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.\n\n1 Peter 4:12â19\n\nBeloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you are sharing Christâs sufferings, so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed. If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory, which is the Spirit of God, is resting on you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, a criminal, or even as a mischief maker. Yet if any of you suffers as a Christian, do not consider it a disgrace, but glorify God because you bear this name. For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And âIf it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinners?â Therefore, let those suffering in accordance with Godâs will entrust themselves to a faithful Creator, while continuing to do good.\n\nJames 1:2â12\n\nMy brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of any kind, consider it nothing but joy, because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance; and let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing. If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God, who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly, and it will be given you. But ask in faith, never doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind; for the doubter, being double-minded and unstable in every way, must not expect to receive anything from the Lord. Let the believer who is lowly boast in being raised up, and the rich in being brought low, because the rich will disappear like a flower in the field. For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. It is the same way with the rich; in the midst of a busy life, they will wither away. Blessed is anyone who endures temptation. Such a one has stood the test and will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.\n\nRevelation 6:9â11\n\nWhen the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the word of God and for the testimony they had given; they cried out with a loud voice, âSovereign Lord, holy and true, how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?â They were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number would be complete both of their fellow servants and of their brothers and sisters, who were soon to be killed as they themselves had been killed.\n\nRevelation 7:13â17\n\nOne of the elders addressed me, saying, âWho are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?â I said to him, âSir, you are the one that knows.â Then he said to me, âThese are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\n\nFor this reason they are before the throne of God,\n\nand worship him day and night within his temple,\n\nand the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.\n\nThey will hunger no more, and thirst no more;\n\nthe sun will not strike them,\n\nnor any scorching heat;\n\nfor the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd,\n\nand he will guide them to springs of the water of life,\n\nand God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.â\n\nRevelation 12:7â12\n\nWar broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole worldâhe was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.\n\nThen I heard a loud voice in heaven, proclaiming,\n\nâNow have come the salvation and the power\n\nand the kingdom of our God\n\nand the authority of his Messiah,\n\nfor the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down,\n\nwho accuses them day and night before our God.\n\nBut they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb\n\nand by the word of their testimony,\n\nfor they did not cling to life even in the face of death.\n\nRejoice then, you heavens\n\nand those who dwell in them!\n\nBut woe to the earth and the sea,\n\nfor the devil has come down to you\n\nwith great wrath,\n\nbecause he knows that his time is short!”\n\nThe Gospel\n\nMatthew 5:1â12\n\nWhen Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:\n\nâBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. âBlessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. âBlessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. âBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. âBlessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. âBlessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. âBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. âBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousnessâ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. âBlessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n\nMatthew 10:16â22\n\nJesus said,âSee, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of them, for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.\"\n\nMatthew 24:9â14\n\nJesus said, âThey will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name. Then many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world, as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come.\"\n\nMark 8:34â38\n\nJesus called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, âIf any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life? Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.â\n\nLuke 6:17â23\n\nJesus came down with his disciples and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast of Tyre and Sidon. They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all in the crowd were trying to touch him, for power came out from him and healed all of them.\n\nThen he looked up at his disciples and said:\n\n\"Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.\n\n\"Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.\n\n\"Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.\n\n\"Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.â\n\nLuke 12:2â12\n\nJesus said, \"Nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known. Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops.\n\nâI tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that can do nothing more. But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him! Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten in Godâs sight. But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.\n\nâAnd I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; but whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God. And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say; for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say.â\n\nLuke 14:26â33\n\nJesus said, âWhoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, âThis fellow began to build and was not able to finish.â Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.\"\n\nLuke 21:9â19\n\nJesus said, âWhen you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately.â Then he said to them, âNation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.\n\nâBut before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. This will give you an opportunity to testify. So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance; for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of my name. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your souls.\"\n\nJohn 12:20â26\n\nNow among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, âSir, we wish to see Jesus.â Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, âThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.\"\n\nJohn 15:1â7\n\nJesus said, âI am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit. You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing. Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.\""
