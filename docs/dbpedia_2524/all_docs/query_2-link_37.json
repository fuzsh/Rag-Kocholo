        "text": "The weekend after Easter, we visited the London Handel Festival for this tasty Baroque concert by the (then) fairly new Southbank Sinfonia.\n\nWe heard:\n\nHandel’s Overture to Giustino HWV37\n\nRameau’s Grand Motet: In Convertendo Dominus\n\nVivaldi’s Concerto Con Molti Istromenti RV 576\n\nLully’s Suite from “Isis”\n\nHandel’s Te Deum for the Peace of Utrecht\n\nJanie couldn’t complain that it was cold this time – we were having a bit of an April heatwave in London. But still she felt that St George’s was austere as a venue…\n\n…”it’s bum-aching, like sitting in Church”…\n\n…”it IS a Church”…\n\n…so she reiterated her strong preference for the Wigmore Hall.\n\nWe both agreed that the music was lovely, though.\n\nBelow is a delightful later performance by the very same orchestra (under Julian Perkins) of the Giustino:\n\nBelow is a beautiful video of the Rameau In Convertendo with William Christie conducting but no identification of the orchestra ( Les Arts Florissants presumably) nor the wonderful soloists – perhaps some of the Early Music Group aficionados can help with the identification of those:\n\nIf you click through this link instead, you can then also hear the other parts in YouTube.\n\nI have the whole festival programme, but here is the one-pager with most of the relevant information about that particular, excellent gig.\n\nI had recently acquired my first iPod – a gift from Kim and Micky, so this was my first party playlist and by gosh I did it the hard way.\n\nHad to do it the hard way, really, as my music collection was all CDs and vinyl, so I ripped (in the case of CDs) or specifically digitised through a sound box/Audacity (in the case of vinyl) every single track I wanted for this party.\n\nNot quite as onerous as the old cassette and reel-to-reel compilation tapes, but hardly the “quick search and click” ability I now have, as my whole collection is digitised and in the cloud on iTunes (other cloud music services are available.\n\nHere’s the CD Box Style thing that iTunes does for you, but it only shows the first 22 tracks…\n\nDaisy Partial Party Playlist CD Box Stylee with image\n\n…there are actually 114 tracks on this playlist; over 8 hours of music. Here’s the full list:\n\nDaisy Whole Party 2006 Playlist\n\nI made the first hour or more solidly Arabian style to go with the theme of the party – click here for a link to the story of the party and more besides. Then a more conventional party playlist, with the mandatory Barry White for Phillie and plenty of dance music for Janie.\n\nThere’s some seriously good stuff on there, though I say so myself. Janie and I still listen to that list reasonably often, even though I have better digital recordings of many of those tracks now.\n\nThis memory was triggered by this charming piece on the King Cricket website in late May 2020:\n\nJanie (Daisy) and I weren’t there for the tense ending of that match either. But we were nearby – there in spirit if not in body.\n\nWe had been eagerly following the match all day.\n\nBut that day was also the birthday of Daisy’s mother, The Duchess of Castlebar. I had bought tickets for the three of us to see a Bach concert at the Wigmore Hall for that evening.\n\nJanie had quite recently acquired a taste for chamber concert halls and baroque music, perhaps a year or two earlier. The Duchess tended to prefer large scale concerts of the Proms variety; we mostly booked those for her. But the Proms don’t get going until a bit later in the summer and it was the 250th anniversary of Bach’s death that year. So Bach at The Wig it was to be.\n\nAnyway, that afternoon the Lord’s Test Match was beautifully poised and/but for reasons I cannot recall – had there been a lot of overnight rain? – the day’s play had been delayed and was playing out until quite late.\n\nThe Duchess is an avid follower of the cricket as well as a music aficionado. We called her to let her know that we were on the way to collect her. We could all listen to the ending of the cricket match together on the car radio on our way to The Wig.\n\nAs we drove to the Duchess’s residence, England wickets fell and the match seemed to be drifting in The West Indies direction. Daisy and I anticipated a dark mood and we were not disappointed.\n\nThrown it away, they’ve thrown it away…\n\n…said The Duchess. We set off for Marylebone (the southern end thereof).\n\nThe Duchess explained to us, as she had several times before, that Denis (Compton), Ted (Dexter), Colin (Cowdrey) Ken (Barrington), Geoffrey (Boycott) and players of that ilk – whom she had met together with her late husband in the good old days- would not have thrown it away like this.\n\nWe arrived at The Wigmore Hall. England hadn’t lost a wicket for a while. Was it possible that they could snatch victory from the very jaws of defeat?\n\nDaisy parked up – it was a warm sunny evening so we sat in the car with the roof open and the car radio on, listening to the denouement of the cricket match.\n\nTry to imagine the scene, dear reader, as it must have looked to passing tourists who understand little or nothing about cricket. A distinguished-looking septuagenarian with her family sitting in a car leaping around in their seats, oohing and aahing every 45 seconds or so as the commentator spoke.\n\nThen, those same seemingly dignified folk whooping for joy for a while, before sealing up the car and entering the Wigmore Hall. Tourists: meet the English.\n\nHere’s a link to the scorecard and the Cricinfo bumf about the match.\n\nThen the concert.\n\nBasically it was an organ recital of JS Bach works by Jennifer Bate. When you click that preceding link you get some eye candy as well as the organist in question, as Jennifer Bate shares her name with a subsequent Miss England and sporting WAG.\n\nIt was a fine concert of mostly well-known Bach organ works. An example of one of the pieces (Bach after Vivaldi as it happens) can be seen and heard below.\n\nA slightly sad coda to this Ogblog piece was the discovery that Jennifer Bate died in March 2020, just a few weeks before I wrote this piece.\n\nHere’s another video of her playing one of the pieces we heard that night; Concerto in C BWV 595 (Ernst arr. Bach)."
