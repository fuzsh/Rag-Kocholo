        "text": "Author: E. J. Gwynn & W. J. Purton\n\nAn electronic edition\n\nview the header | view the Irish text\n\np. 127.\n\n1. A former layman was in company\n\nwith a “son of life.” He said:\n\nI do not understand your continual\n\nsinging of the Beati and the Canticle\n\nof Mary (i.e. the Magnificat). That\n\nis not hard to explain, truly, said\n\nthe other. As a man, being now at\n\nthe foot of the gallows, would pour out\n\npraise and lamentation to the king, to\n\ngain his deliverance; in like manner we\n\npour forth lamentation to the King of\n\nHeaven in the Beati, to gain our deliverance.\n\nAnd it is fitting also that\n\nthe song (?) which came from the head\n\nof the Virgin Mary, when she had\n\nconceived by the Holy Ghost at the\n\nangel’s announcement (i.e. at the message):\n\n—that this should be set as a\n\ncrown upon the chant which contains\n\npraise of God and lamentation addressed\n\nto Him.\n\n2. As for those who come to converse\n\nwith him, it is not his usage to\n\nask them for news, but to see that they\n\nprofit in those matters only for which\n\nthey come. Because it might harass\n\np. 128.\n\nand disturb the mind of him to whom\n\nit was told. If the persons in authority\n\nthat are in the Church where thou art\n\nhave not fully performed their duties, and\n\nif each . . . from thee, without correcting\n\nhimself, merely send him away from\n\nthy confession gently and kindly; if\n\nthey do anything [that they have been\n\ntold] thereupon, —it is well. If they\n\ndo not repent, it is best to dismiss them\n\nmerely.\n\n3. Whatever remains over after the\n\nmonks that live with thee are satisfied,\n\nthis he thinks it right to give to the\n\npoor, for they have nowhere that they\n\ncan go to beg anything. But it is meet\n\nfor thee, even if thou have no old leavings,\n\n[to feed] the poor with flitches of\n\nbacon and firkins of butter and so forth.\n\n4. Maeldithruib (of Tir Da Glas)\n\nasked Helair (of Loch Cre) whether,\n\nif the folk in the old churches had\n\nnot properly performed their duties, he\n\nought to accept from them any of the\n\nproduce of the church? Helair replied\n\nthat he should accept it, for it does\n\nnot defile thee, if thou have no share in\n\nreceiving them or in confirming them\n\nin orders: for though they be defiled\n\n(said he), yet they defile not the\n\npatron’s fruits. For that belongs to\n\nus (said he), rather than return to them.\n\nThe only bread that used to be brought\n\nto himself, and into his own island,\n\nwas the “bread of Ros Cré.” Let it\n\nbe Mochua’s bread, said he (that is,\n\nHelair) that is brought to us.\n\n5. Psalms of prayer and the Beati\n\nare used by some in the morning, but\n\nhe does not recite them in the morning:\n\nfor when he (that is Helair) performs\n\na morning vigil, it is with some part of\n\np. 129.\n\nthe Psalms that he performs his vigil,\n\n(in order to keep the order of the Psalms,\n\nbecause of the instruction) and the cross-vigil\n\nis performed with the Beati,\n\ntogether with the part [of the Psalms]\n\nwhich follows . . . . . . The evening\n\nPsalms of prayer he performs in the\n\nmiddle of the day, with the Beati, and\n\nafterwards he recites his Psalms of prayer\n\nat the office. He recites, however, three\n\nBeati, and a Magnificat with each of\n\nthem, after the Psalms, a Beati to each\n\nfifty. It was not, however, Maelruain\n\nthat had told him to do this. He had\n\nsaid to Maelruain: I have heard,\n\nsaid he, thus is the vigil Dublitir\n\npractices: the three fifties standing,\n\nand a genuflection at the end of every\n\nPsalm.\n\n6. Not a drop of beer was drunk in\n\nTallaght in Maelruain’s lifetime. When\n\nhis monks used to go anywhere else,\n\nthey used not to drink a drop of beer in\n\nTir Cualann, whomsoever they might\n\nhappen to meet. However, when they\n\nwent a long distance, in that case they\n\nwere allowed to drink. Not a morsel\n\nof meat was eaten in Tallaght in his\n\nlifetime [unless] it were a deer or a\n\nwild swine. What meat there was [at\n\nTallaght used to be consumed by] the\n\nguests.\n\nThen Dublitir came to Maelruain to\n\nurge him to grant his monks relaxation\n\non the three chief feasts, even if it were\n\nnot allowed after nor before those days.\n\nMaelruain replied: As long as I shall\n\ngive rules, said he, and as long as\n\nmy injunctions are observed in this\n\nplace, the liquor that causes forgetfulness\n\nof God shall not be drunk here.\n\nWell, said Dublitir, my monks\n\np. 130.\n\nshall drink it, and they shall be in\n\nHeaven along with thine. Anyone\n\nof my monks that shall hearken to me,\n\nsaid Maelruain, and keep my Rule,\n\nshall not need to be cleansed by the fire\n\nof Doomsday, nor to come to judgment,\n\nbecause they shall be clean already.\n\nThy monks, however, shall perchance\n\nhave somewhat for the fire of Doom to\n\ncleanse.\n\n7. There was a certain bishop of the\n\nDeisi at Findglas, named Cainchomrac:\n\nhe was Dublitir’s confessor. One day\n\nthe two came in front of the brethren\n\nout of the garden over the stile into\n\nthe field. There was a certain poor\n\nold woman waiting for Dublitir in the\n\nfield to pray him to let her sleep in\n\nthe nuns’ hostel. Presently the old\n\nwoman wearied him with her loud\n\npraying to God. Be off with you\n\nthen! said he; misfortune take your\n\nface! Instantly thereupon Cainchomrac\n\nbowed himself to the ground.\n\nWhat is this? said Dublitir. Alas!\n\nit is a dreadful deed thou hast committed,\n\nsaid Cainchomrac, to revile\n\nthe poor old woman. Then he bowed\n\nhimself statim. Thine award therefor?\n\nsaid Dublitir. This is my\n\naward, said Cainchomrac, that she\n\ngo into the women’s hostel, and be\n\ngiven a milch cow and a cloak. Moreover,\n\nwe will settle here and now the\n\npenance that is meet for thee. It\n\nshall be done, said Dublitir.\n\n8. Now Maeldithruib sings between\n\nevery two psalms of the hundred and\n\nfifty Sancte Michael, ora pro nobis,\n\nSancta Maria, ora pro nobis, adding the\n\nsaint whose feast falls on the day.\n\nWhen the office of nocturns is over, then\n\np. 131.\n\nMaeldithruib sings Celebra Juda and\n\nCantemus and Averte faciem, and so forth,\n\nand thereafter Hymnum dicat, this last\n\nin a cross-vigil. Then the Beati of\n\nnocturns, and along with it the Magnificat.\n\nAs to the Beati of the refectory,\n\nhowever, the Magnificat and Hymnum\n\nand Unitas are sung with it, and Ego uero\n\norationem, and so forth. But on Sunday\n\nnight the Beati is sung twice over. The\n\nPsalms of prayer are sung on Saturday\n\nnight and Sunday night at vespers.\n\nIt is also his custom to recite on Sunday\n\nnights a table grace and thanksgiving.\n\nImmediately after dinner he sings\n\nAverte faciem to a chant; after it a\n\nprayer, Columba sancte, sume nos in\n\ngremio. Caritatis tutela tuae sit nobis.\n\nAfter that, O Stephen, help me! guard\n\nwith thy head my heart against the\n\nsnares of death! O holy fire, save the\n\nhousehold of my dwelling! Let there\n\nbe no pains nor torments, et reliqua.\n\nThen he crosses himself.\n\n9. If anyone eats before the proper\n\nhour, a fast is the penalty for it, or to\n\nbe put on bread and water the next\n\nevening.\n\n10. Also Maelruain did not approve\n\nof listening to music. There was a certain\n\npiper, Cornan, who lived in Descert\n\nLagen, and he was an anchorite. They\n\ncalled him Cornan of the Glen (that is,\n\nof Glen Essa), a man of grace. Presents\n\nused to be sent to him from Maelruain.\n\nHe said once to Maelruain’s monks, I\n\nwould crave a boon, said he, to play\n\na tune to the cleric. Then Maelruain\n\nmade answer, Say to Cornan, said\n\nhe, these ears are not lent to earthly\n\nmusic that they may be lent to the\n\nmusic of Heaven.\n\n11. Now as to penitents: first,\n\np. 132.\n\nthose that are given to lust, and that\n\nfrequent various mates and have\n\nchildren born to them, seven years of\n\npenance for them. Also those that shed\n\nblood and commit homicide, seven years’\n\nstrict penance for them.\n\n12. This I have heard from him:\n\neven those who do not eat flesh\n\nregularly take a particle of flesh at Easter\n\nto guard against scarcity and hunger\n\noccurring in the course of the year.\n\nThis I have heard from him; this\n\nwas the practice at Tir da Glas when\n\nthe Rule was there: the whole congregation,\n\nwhen they left the oratory\n\nat noon on Easter Day, used to go\n\nstraight to the kitchen that each of\n\nthem might take a particle of flesh\n\nthere, as a precaution against scarcity\n\nor poverty during the year; for unless a\n\nman relaxes at Easter, it would not be\n\neasy for them to do so afterwards until\n\nthe next Easter a year later.\n\n13. A herb that is cut on Sunday,\n\nor kale that is cooked, or bread that is\n\nbaked, or blackberries or nuts that are\n\nplucked on a Sunday, it is not his\n\npractice, nor the practice of true clerics,\n\nto eat these things.\n\n14. If one of the laity accepts\n\nspiritual direction, he is to keep himself\n\nfrom his wife on these three nights,\n\nWednesday night, Friday night, and\n\nSaturday night. As to Sunday night, he\n\nis to do so if he can. And when a woman\n\nis in her monthly sickness, a man ought\n\nto keep away from her according to\n\nthe ghostly counsel of Peter in libris\n\nClementinis.\n\n15. When bishops and elders grant\n\nexemption from vigils, it is right that\n\nthis should be done for their sake,\n\np. 133.\n\nif it should be a day outside Lent, or\n\nif it be the feast of a saint [during\n\nLent], and if it be not in order to shirk\n\ndue observance that the exemption is\n\nsought. Although the performance of\n\nthe vigil in public be remitted, the\n\nperson concerned has to perform it in\n\nhis own cubicle afterwards. He does\n\nnot hold it right for any cleric to excuse\n\nany duty which his seniors have imposed.\n\n16. Maeldithruib asked Maelruain\n\nwhether it were enough to recite fifty\n\npsalms, if there chanced to be instruction\n\nalong with them? Maelruain\n\nreplied that he considered the whole\n\ncontents of the Psalter not too much\n\nof a task. This, indeed, is what we\n\nconsider to be the additional labour of\n\neach man. There is, indeed, at this\n\nmoment [among us] a man for the sickle,\n\nfor the flail, for the measuring-rod, and\n\nfor the ditch; but the additional labour\n\nof each of them is the Three Fifties.\n\nNone of them, said he, goes to table\n\ntill that man’s special business be\n\nfinished.\n\n17. This Maelruain heard the elders\n\nsay of the desertion of the land: Any\n\none who deserts his country, except to\n\ngo from the east to the west, and from\n\nthe north to the south, is a denier of\n\nPatrick in Heaven and of the Faith in\n\nErin.\n\n18. There is nothing that a man\n\ndoes on behalf of one that dies that\n\ndoes not help him, whether it be vigil\n\nor abstinence, or reciting intercessory\n\nprayers or almsgiving, or frequent benediction.\n\nMoedoc and all his monks\n\nwere a full year on bread and water to\n\nobtain the release of the soul of\n\np. 134.\n\nBrandub mac Echach. Sons ought to\n\ndo penance for the souls of their departed\n\nparents et cætera.\n\n19. The daughter of the king in\n\nthe eastern country bestowed land on\n\nFursa. She said to Fursa, What\n\nmanner of man art thou? said she.\n\nLike an old smith, said he. with\n\nhis anvil on his shoulder. The\n\nanvil of devotion? said she. Perseverance\n\nin holiness, said he. A\n\nquestion! [said she], if God should\n\ngive thee a block where thine anvil\n\nmight be planted, wouldst thou abide\n\nthere? It would be likely, indeed,\n\nsaid he. Then she bestowed on him\n\nthe spot where he was.\n\n20. He considers that priests who\n\ngo astray, however fervent their penitence\n\nmay be, should not be allowed to\n\nenter episcopal orders. For they consider\n\nthat to enter episcopal orders is a\n\npurification for the one who transgresses the\n\npriestly orders.\n\n21. He thinks it well that if a man\n\nmakes a resolution to do anything good,\n\nhe should openly vow and proclaim whatever\n\nresolution he has taken. Because\n\nwhat a man does merely in intention is\n\nnot greatly pleasing to God. This is what\n\nMocholmoc úa Litan said of the continual\n\nintending to do a thing. A certain layman\n\ncame to ask him for ghostly counsel.\n\nWhat sort of life dost thou lead?\n\nsaid Mocholmoc: Art thou still in the\n\nmarried state? Nay, said he it\n\nis three years since we two had intercourse.\n\nA question: have ye taken\n\na vow? said Mocholmoc. No,\n\nsaid he. Then said Mocholmoc: That\n\nis too long a time to part from the\n\np. 135.\n\nDevil without coming to God. For it\n\nis when he makes such a vow that a\n\nman comes into membership of God’s\n\nfamily.\n\n22. The feast of a saint that falls\n\noutside Lent on a Saturday, as, for\n\ninstance, Cainnech’s—he has seen the\n\nnoonday vigil on Saturday excused\n\nin honour of Cainnech in Tallaght.\n\nHowever, Maeldithruib never saw\n\nrelaxation as to a seland of butter\n\ngranted to Maelruain’s monastery on\n\nSaturday evening on account of\n\nCaindech’s feast-day. He used to\n\nconsume all his portion of porridge\n\nin morsels.\n\n23. Concerning the matter of spiritual\n\ndirection, some think it sufficient if\n\nthey have merely made their confession,\n\nthough they do no penance afterwards.\n\nHe does not approve of this. He thinks\n\nit well, however, that one should show\n\nthem what is profitable to them, even\n\nthough he does not ask for confessions.\n\nThis is what Helair did in the matter:\n\nat first he had received many, but he\n\nended by sending them all away, because\n\nhe saw that their penance was not\n\nzealously performed, and also that they\n\nconcealed their sins when making confession.\n\nAfter that he finally refused\n\nto receive anyone at all to spiritual\n\ndirection. However, he would sometimes\n\nallow holy persons to consult him.\n\n24. As for Maelruain he was not stiff\n\nin refusing to receive them finally. He\n\nhad no great desire even to receive\n\nMaeldithruib. This is what he said:\n\nDidst thou ask permission of those\n\nwhom thou didst leave before coming\n\nhither? Yea, said Maeldithruib.\n\np. 136.\n\nEven artisans, said Maelruain. the\n\nsmiths, the wrights, etc., none of them\n\nlikes a man of his household to go to\n\nanyone else. What thou sayest has\n\nbeen looked to, said Maeldithruib; I\n\nobtained authorization and permission.\n\nThen he made submission to the authority\n\nof Maelruain. Then said Maelruain:\n\nA year of repurification shalt\n\nthou have among us, said he. Thrice\n\nforty nights shalt thou be on bread\n\nand water, save for a sup of milk on\n\nSundays only, and he had permission\n\nto mix a cup of whey in the water in the\n\nsummer-Lent only. Now till that\n\ntime he had been under the spiritual\n\ndirection of Echtguide.\n\nNow this is what Maelruain said to\n\nhim: When thou hearest of a man’s\n\ndecease, said he, then [say to thyself\n\nthat] the fire thou most dreadest to\n\nburn thee, to it shalt thou go.\n\n25. Maeldithruib said to Maelruain:\n\nI have long had four darling\n\nwishes. My first wish was to read and\n\nto cast my eyes over whatever sacred\n\nreading had come into the country.\n\nThen it was a darling wish of mine,\n\nwherever there is the household of\n\nsaintly men that are holiest in this\n\ncountry, to be busied in attending on\n\nthose saintly persons and earning their\n\nblessing. And [my next wish was]\n\nthat I might attain to have my fill of\n\ndiscourse with thee; and [the last was]\n\nthat I might earn the blessing of thy\n\nfolk here, both those of them that we\n\nshould discourse with and those we\n\nshould not. Our saintly friend,\n\nFer da Chrich, said to us, speaking of\n\np. 137.\n\ncontinual contriving of that same thing,\n\nsaid Maelruain, Let the good desires of\n\ntheir hearts be granted to the sons of\n\nlife, so that their rewards may be paid\n\nthem according as their desires should\n\nbring about those results.\n\n26. Thereafter Maeldithruib inquired\n\nof him, whether he held it\n\nallowable to perform Sunday night’s\n\npenance on the Saturday, because,\n\nsaid Maeldithruib, the laity and the\n\npeople of the great old churches yonder\n\nare of little worth; and if those folk\n\nhear that we perform it on the [Sunday\n\nnight], there is no sort of transgression\n\nthey will not commit on the Sunday.\n\nThen Maelruain gave him leave to perform\n\nit on the Saturday.\n\n27. The regular time of tonsure. It\n\nis performed once a month on a Thursday:\n\nif it be not reached on the Thursday,\n\nit is performed on the Friday or Saturday.\n\nIf, however, it pass the Sunday,\n\nthere is no tonsuring until the regular\n\ntime of tonsure comes again that day\n\nmonth. This is what we received from\n\nMaelruain.\n\n28. He sings the Hymn to Michael\n\nbefore sleeping, and the Hymn to Mary\n\nin the morning. He names them the\n\nInvocation of Michael’s Protection and\n\nthe Invocation of Mary’s Protection\n\nrespectively. Afterwards he sings the\n\nHymn to Michael, as well as the Beati\n\nand Hymnum dicat, on Sunday at midday.\n\nThe Hymn to Mary, however, he\n\nsings, as well as the Beati, on Sunday\n\nevening. This is what he performs—\n\na hundred genuflections, [and] a cross-vigil\n\nwith the Beati and Hymnum\n\np. 138.\n\ndicat and Unitas or Cantemus. The\n\ncross-vigils he performs thus: Hymn to\n\nMichael with one cross-vigil, Hymn to\n\nMary with the next, and so alternately.\n\n29. The four books of the Gospels\n\nare to be read aloud at meal time till the\n\nend of the year, a book to every quarter:\n\nthe book of Matthew in the spring\n\nquarter, and the rest similarly in their\n\norder.\n\n30. He uses four cross-vigils: a\n\ncross-vigil with Beati and Hymnun dicat\n\nat prime; then he sings the Psalms as\n\nfar as the beginning of the last fifty;\n\nnext, a cross-vigil with Beati again\n\nat the end of the middle fifty, that is,\n\nCantemus at this point; then a cross-vigil\n\nat Domine probasti in the same\n\nway: that is, Hymn to Michael one\n\ntime; Hymn to Mary the next; finally,\n\na cross-vigil at the end [of the Psalms]\n\nwith the thirty paternosters. He used\n\nto call the Beati after which the Hymn\n\nto Michael is sung, “Michael’s Beati”\n\nand the Beati after which the Hymn\n\nto Mary is sung, “Mary’s Beati”. The\n\nBeati, after which he performs the cross-vigil\n\nof eventide he calls “little Beati”,\n\nbecause neither Unitas nor Cantemus is\n\nsung after it. Howbeit, Magnificat and\n\nHymnum dicat are sung after it. Now,\n\nthe cross-vigil is not performed between\n\nthe two Christmases, or between the\n\ntwo Easters, and flagellation is not\n\ninflicted at that time. Even the cross-vigil\n\nwith Hymnum dicat at nocturns is not\n\nperformed between the two Christmases\n\nnor between the two Easters. He\n\nexcuses also at that time the singing of\n\nthe psalms of prayers at vespers, between\n\nthe two Christmases. The thirty paternosters\n\nhe sings at the cross-vigil of eventide.\n\np. 139.\n\nHe sings them even between the\n\ntwo Christmases, though he does not\n\nperform a cross-vigil with them. However,\n\nhe performs the vigil at matins the\n\nday after Epiphany, and the Monday\n\nfollowing Low Sunday, and he performs\n\nthe cross-vigil with Hymnum dicat\n\nat nocturns on the night following\n\nEpiphany and on the night of Low\n\nSunday. Also the Beati with which\n\nhe performs his morning vigil, he sings\n\nit between two solemn feast days,\n\neven though he does not perform the\n\nvigil. This is his practice in regard to\n\nthe canticle wherewith he performs the\n\nvigils: it is sung, though there be a\n\nrelaxation as to the vigil itself. But as\n\nto the psalms of prayer, they are excused\n\nbetween the two Christmases and the\n\ntwo Easters, at vespers. They are not\n\nexcused, however, from Low Sunday to\n\nPentecost.\n\n31. He sings the psalms as follows:\n\nhe divides each fifty into four: the first\n\ndivision he makes is from Beatus to\n\nDomine quis: then a genuflection at\n\nthis point, and he sings a pater [and]\n\nDominus in adjutorium as far as Festina\n\nbefore each division. The second division,\n\nfrom Domine quis to Dominus illuminatio,\n\nand the last Benedicite and a\n\npater thereafter. Then from Dominus\n\nilluminatio to Dixi custodiam, and here\n\na pater and genuflection. From Dixi\n\ncustodiam then to the end: here a pater\n\nand genuflection. Then from Quid\n\ngloriaris to Te decet, and here a pater\n\nand genuflection. From Te decet to Voce.\n\nFrom Voce to Misericordias. From\n\nMisericordias to the end; but it is\n\nthere he sings his pater. From Domine\n\nexaudisti to In exitu Israel. From In exitu\n\np. 140.\n\nIsrael to In convertendo. From In convertendo\n\nto Domine probasti. [From Domine\n\nprobasti] to the end. The place where\n\nhe sings the Magnificat is immediately\n\nafter the Beati, not after the psalms.\n\nEvery [other] division is sung sitting,\n\nthe next standing. The pater noster\n\nwhich he recites at the end of each\n\ndivision, this is to mark the divisions.\n\n32. There was a certain nun from\n\nCaill Uaitne endowed with the grace of\n\nGod. She would not rise without singing\n\na pater. She would not sit down\n\nwithout chanting a pater. When she\n\nrose to recite the divisions [of the\n\npsalms] she used to recite a pater immediately\n\nafter rising, and then she would\n\nbegin the division. Then when that\n\ndivision was finished she would sit down\n\nand she would recite a pater immediately\n\nafter sitting down, and then she would\n\nbegin to recite the [next] division sitting\n\ndown. It is by her example that he\n\nappoints(?) the pater at the end of\n\neach division. It is his constant usage\n\nto sing a pater whenever he rises, and\n\na pater whenever he sits down.\n\n33. I have heard, said Maeldithruib\n\nto Maelruain, that the vigil\n\nwhich Dublitir practised was as follows:\n\nthe three fifties standing and\n\na genuflection after each psalm. I\n\ndo not tell thee [to do so], says\n\nMaelruain, such is not our practice.\n\nAnd the Canticles, how shall they be\n\nsung? said Maeldithruib. Not hard\n\nto say, said Maelruain: they may\n\nbe used in three ways after a division\n\n[of the psalms]: that is, either the\n\nwhole number may be sung at the end\n\nafter finishing the psalms; or three of\n\np. 141.\n\nthem after each fifty; or one canticle\n\nafter each division.\n\nNow this is Maeldithruib’s practice.\n\n34. There was a certain anchorite\n\nat Cluain ua Duban. Great was his\n\nlabour: two hundred genuflections he\n\nused to perform at matins and a hundred\n\nevery canonical hour, a hundred at\n\nnocturns—seven hundred in all. This\n\nwas told to Maelruain. By my word,\n\nsays Maelruain, a time will come to\n\nhim before his death when he shall not\n\nperform a single genuflection. This\n\ncame to pass: his feet were seized so\n\nthat he could not perform a vigil for a\n\nlong time before his death, on account\n\nof the excessive amount he had performed\n\nin other days.\n\n35. Wealth(?) that is given by lay\n\nfolk, he is careful not to accept. Some\n\naccept such things to be distributed by\n\nthem to the poor thereafter: because the\n\nlay folk do not distribute to the poor.\n\nThe consequence is that the lay folk\n\ndeem it enough to win a place in heaven,\n\nif only they have given something to\n\ntheir confessors, and after that they\n\nthink it will be at their pleasure. It is\n\nbetter then not to accept anything, save\n\nfrom one that is holy, or from one that\n\nsubmits to spiritual direction.\n\n36. Now if thou art angry with\n\nanyone, whether a stranger or one of\n\nthine own monks, if thou are wroth so\n\nas to lay a curse on anyone, or revile\n\nhim, fasting is imposed for it: (this is\n\nwhat Maelruain prescribed to Maeldithruib);\n\nand to beseech pardon of\n\neveryone thou hast offended, if he be not\n\none of thy monks; or, if it be one of thy\n\nmonks, if he be a holy man, and if his\n\nvirtue was reported before [he reached]\n\np. 142.\n\nthe orders which he transgressed by this\n\nill-behaviour against them, it is better\n\nto beseech him.\n\n37. As for a servant or attendant,\n\npenitence is not necessary on his account,\n\nlest thou increase(?) his carelessness,\n\nbut only fasting for thyself. If the\n\nservant who has no fear of God be not\n\nin awe of thee, thou wilt not have much\n\nhold on him, and he will treat thee negligently\n\nif thou show penitence to him.\n\nThis is what is right, after admonishing\n\nhim of his fault, that he should\n\ndo penance for his misbehaviour, and\n\nthat thou shouldest not be angry in any\n\nway, either consciously or unconsciously.\n\nIf thou art angry with thy servant, however,\n\nand there is no cursing nor reviling,\n\na hundred blows on thy hand in\n\nthe first place with a scourge. If this\n\ndo not check thee, then thou shalt put\n\nthyself on bread and water for the night\n\nafter getting angry.\n\n38. Now if spittle falls on a man’s\n\nhand at meals, their use is to pour water\n\nthereupon, after the spittle touches the\n\nhand.\n\n39. A “son of life” should always\n\nrecite his psalms by the psalter. This\n\nis what he used to say of this: There\n\nare three adversaries busy attacking me,\n\nmy eye, my tongue, and my thoughts:\n\nthe psalter restrains them all. Howbeit,\n\nthis is what Maelruain had said to\n\nMaeldithruib: The thought is no less\n\noccupied with the meaning when one is\n\nreciting the psalm by rote than it is\n\nwhen he is reading it with the psalter.\n\n40. It is not the practice of the\n\nCeli De for one to drink anything after\n\nmaking water. This is what I have\n\nheard from Maeldithruib. This was the\n\np. 143.\n\npractice of Siadal mac Testa of Ard\n\nMor:—It was forbidden(?) that any\n\none of his monastery should drink a\n\ndrop after passing his water. This had\n\nbeen also the practice of Cumine Fota:\n\nthis is also the practice of Clemens mac\n\nNuadat—if he were overtaken by jollity\n\nor tipsiness through drinking beer or a\n\ngoblet of mead, when this happened to\n\nhim he had to fast the next night\n\nimmediately thereafter.\n\n41. A groat that is given to a lad or\n\nyoung man for accompanying someone in\n\na sin of lust, or to a woman; if the lad or\n\nthe woman do penance thereafter for that\n\nsin, he considers it proper in regard to\n\nthat groat to give their price to the\n\npoor. He does not hold it admissible,\n\nhowever, to give it back to the person\n\nby whom it was given in the first\n\ninstance. But he does not consider it\n\nclean dealing for the person to whom it\n\nis given to keep possession of it,\n\nbecause it is given as the price of sin.\n\n42. He does not consider it forbidden\n\nthat an ewer of water should be provided\n\nfor one who is on bread and water.\n\nThis is what Maelruain said to Maeldithruib:\n\nA year of cleansing with\n\nus here, said he, to be on bread\n\nand water for the thrice forty nights:\n\na sip of whey-water on Sunday, if it\n\nchance to be ready. However, it was\n\npermitted him to mix a sip of whey\n\nwith water in summer-lent.\n\n43. This is their practice: to wash\n\ntheir hands after plying the scourge,\n\nwhether it be to read aloud the gospels\n\nthat a man goes after doing penance,\n\nor whether it be to the kitchen, or\n\nto any other matter—he washes his\n\nhands.\n\n44. This we received from Maelruain:\n\np. 144.\n\nTo consult his confessor once a\n\nyear regularly, if he be at a distance:\n\nif he be nearer, however, it is allowable\n\nto consult him oftener.\n\n45. It is not the practice of the\n\nCeli De to do anything whatever after\n\nevensong on Saturday. Once it happened\n\nto me that I chanced to stay in the bath\n\na while after evensong on Saturday.\n\nHe told me to go without condiment of\n\nbacon or butter on the Saturday evening\n\nand the Sunday following.\n\n46. This is what he said to one\n\nthat was devout: that concern for carnal\n\nthings should not weigh on him, unless\n\nthey led him to oppose the will of God.\n\nThis is what Maelruain said to Sechnasach\n\nthe bishop from Cill Gulbin.\n\nHis mother besought him to take care of\n\nher, and yet would not turn from her\n\nsins. Then Sechnasach asked Maelruain,\n\nHow shall I at all manage these two\n\nthings? This is what he said:\n\nThough thou bring her not to thee\n\nto life, let her not carry thee to\n\ndeath: but if she be converted, thou art\n\nbound to take care of her. If anyone\n\nthat is carnal be really poor, he deserves\n\npity, as every poor man doth.\n\n47. Three words Diarmaid, abbot\n\nof Iona, left with bishop Carthach: pittance,\n\nperseverance, cross-vigil: that is,\n\ndo not make a resolution— This is the\n\npittance I will always eat. I will\n\nsay the Beati perseveringly without\n\ndesisting. This is the vigil I will\n\nperform.\n\n48. This was Maelruain’s practice:\n\nany of the clerical students who suffered\n\nfrom great thirst had permission to take\n\na drink of water or whey from the\n\nhour of tierce to that of nocturns, lest\n\np. 145.\n\nexcessive thirst should cause him\n\nsuffering; and he was to perform thirty\n\npaters in cross-vigil thereafter. From\n\nnocturns to tierce, however, none was\n\npermitted to take a drink though he\n\nwere at the point of death. As to the\n\ninfirm and old, however, the rigour of\n\nthe rule does not bind them to go without\n\nany thing, like healthy persons.\n\nThis is what I have heard from Maeldithruib:\n\nthis was the practice in\n\nLismore:—Different folk for different\n\nhours: if a man were very infirm, he\n\nwas to do some duty at tierce, another\n\nman at midday, another at none, and\n\nanother in the afternoon, according to\n\neach man’s infirmity. A lad or youth\n\nthat gave up his body to Maelruain, such\n\nwould be excused from fasting when\n\nthey had made themselves liable to fast.\n\nThe feasts of the apostles in summer-lent:\n\nhe does not forbid the vigil to be\n\nrelaxed on these days.\n\n49. Now gathering of apples on a\n\nSunday or lifting a single apple from\n\nthe ground is not allowed among them.\n\nIn the case of one who does not eat\n\nmeat he thinks it proper that he should\n\nnot be allowed to drink the broth thereof.\n\nHe does not think it right to prepare a\n\nselann on a Sunday, but that it should\n\nbe done beforehand.\n\n50. The course prescribed to a\n\nwedded couple who are under spiritual\n\ndirection. From prime on Monday\n\nto matins on Wednesday, for these\n\ntwo days and nights they are given\n\nexemption and licence both for meals and\n\nconjugal intercourse. After that time\n\nabstinence is imposed on them both\n\nfrom flesh and intercourse, from matins\n\np. 146.\n\non Wednesday to matins on Thursday.\n\nThey are given exemption again from\n\nmatins on Thursday till matins on\n\nFriday. They must keep themselves\n\nagain from intercourse from matins on\n\nFriday till matins on Monday, that is,\n\nthey are to live separately for three\n\ndays and three nights. Abstinence from\n\nmeals is imposed on them on Friday and\n\nthe following night, and on Saturday\n\nand Saturday night. They are given\n\nexemption, for meals only, on Sunday\n\nand Sunday night.\n\n51. Now he that eats the flesh of\n\na wild deer or wild swine and who\n\neats no other flesh at Easter, must not\n\neat any other flesh until the Easter\n\nfollowing, unless constrained by some\n\nnecessity (for he does not reckon this\n\nas flesh). Now if he does not eat flesh\n\nand bacon at Easter, even though hunger\n\nor heathen constrain him to eat meat,\n\nand he has nothing else that he may\n\neat, he thinks it better and safer for\n\nhim to face death for the sake of fulfilling\n\nhis vow than to relax in regard\n\nto meat; and it is reckoned to him as\n\nmartyrdom if he chance to die for it, to\n\nfulfil what he had promised to his confessor.\n\nFor there ought to be no relaxation\n\nas to flesh even at Easter, till the\n\nconfessor grant it; and he thinks it right\n\nthat it should be from the hand of his\n\nconfessor that he should receive the\n\nsacrament.\n\n52. In the case of penance laid on\n\nsickly persons, this is what he thinks\n\nright, as to the continual preparing\n\nfor meals: alternate reviving and mortifying\n\nis practised on them, lest the\n\nperpetual confinement should cause their\n\ndeath; and this is done, if it can be\n\np. 147.\n\nmanaged, without their knowledge, by\n\ntelling his servant privately, Let a\n\nseland be brought to them in their\n\npottage or on bread (but it is more\n\nusual to bring it to them in the pottage).\n\nOnce it happened that the abbot who\n\nwas in Iona saw that the recluses had\n\na bad colour. Thereupon he went to the\n\ncook and himself made the pottage for\n\nthat day. He added one-third of water\n\nto the daily allowance and boiled\n\nthe water. When this third had boiled\n\naway, he put a lump of butter on each\n\nman’s allowance, and boiled it on the\n\nwater, and then put meal over it, and\n\nso he did every day. Then they noticed\n\nthe change in their colour, and knew\n\nnot what had caused it, since they saw\n\nthe usual ration unchanged. So when\n\ntheir colour came back and they revived,\n\nhe continued alternately to mortify and\n\nrevive them from their dying state after\n\nthis fashion.\n\n53. Now as to invalids who do not\n\ndrink like other people, if they do not\n\nloiter over it, and if retention of urine\n\ncauses disease unless they go out, he\n\nthinks it reasonable that they should be\n\nallowed to go out, lest the constraint\n\nupon them should induce disease;\n\nalways provided that they drink a\n\nproper amount, that is, as much as\n\nquenches their thirst. If, however,\n\nexcessive drinking be the object, they\n\nare not allowed to go out.\n\n54. Now he thinks it better and\n\nsafer that one should refuse to receive\n\nconfessions from anyone, unless he does\n\npenance at [the confessor’s] bidding; but\n\none should do [the sinner] all the good\n\nthat lies in one’s power, short of\n\nreceiving his confession: if, however, a\n\np. 148.\n\nman confesses his sins to some one, full\n\npenance must be laid upon him, or he\n\nmust be banished if he does not do\n\npenance.\n\n55. At the Epiphany he does not\n\nconsider it right to tonsure or wash or\n\nsplit wood or do any other form of work,\n\njust as such things are not done on a\n\nSunday. The bringing of Christ out\n\nof Egypt and the presentation in the\n\nTemple and the defeat of the Devil:\n\non these days Sunday’s office is to\n\nbe said: we never saw dinner in the\n\ndaytime on those feasts.\n\n56. This is what Colchu approves,\n\nto give the sacrament to those that are\n\nlying sick at the hour of death, provided\n\nthey have made a renunciation of every\n\nvanity. Leave it, however, to God to\n\njudge the mind of such, whether it be\n\ntrue conversion; and if it be so, [be sure\n\nthat] the sacrament can bring salvation\n\nto them in that moment. It is not\n\nproper, however, to repeat the sacrament\n\nthereafter in extremis.\n\n57. He considers it not unlawful\n\nthat somewhat should be accepted from\n\nidle folk, and that thou shouldst afterwards\n\ngive to the poor anything that is\n\nleft of it when thine own monks are\n\nsatisfied, because if it is in the hands\n\nof the idle, they give none of it to the\n\npoor.\n\n58. When at the end of a meal\n\nthe body happens to be roused to lust,\n\nslightly or strongly, he considers it\n\nnot amiss to cast that meal back\n\nupon the Lord in displeasure at him,\n\nas if one should say There, keep thy\n\nmeal for thyself! and he believes\n\nthat this trial of him will not often be\n\np. 149.\n\nmade thereafter. Or else, to subtract a\n\npart of the meal, and to pray God therewith\n\n[and to repeat] lead us not into\n\ntemptation, and Deus in adiutorium as\n\nfar as festina.\n\n59. Persons whose desires are excited,\n\nit may be through hearing confessions,\n\nor merely with meditating, or\n\nthrough youth, need strict abstinence to\n\nsubdue them, because it is excess of\n\nblood in their body that is the cause.\n\nAfterwards, when the blood fails, then\n\nlust and desire fail.\n\n60. Molaise of Daminis had a sister\n\nnamed Copar. Now desire lay heavy upon\n\nthe girl, for it is a third part as strong\n\nagain in woman as in men. Then he\n\nregulates her portion and her pittance\n\nfor a year: that is, a measured pittance.\n\nOn that day year she came to him, and\n\nconfessed that her desire still persisted.\n\nNow he was busy sewing before her.\n\nThen he thrust the needle thrice into\n\nher palm, and three streams of blood\n\nflowed from her hand. Then said he,\n\nNo wonder, said he, if it is hard\n\nfor the body, wherein are these strong\n\ncurrents, to contain itself. Then he\n\ndiminished her meals a second time.\n\nShe was on that ration for a year, and\n\nher desire still persisted. So after\n\nthat time he thrusts the needle into\n\nher hand thrice, and three streams of\n\nblood flowed from it. So he reduced\n\nher meals again for a year, and at the\n\nend of that time he thrust the needle\n\n[again into her hand]. This time, however,\n\nnot a drop of blood came out of\n\nher. Then he said to her: In future,\n\nsaid he, keep on this pittance until\n\nthy death.\n\n61. There was a certain itinerant\n\np. 150.\n\npedlar in Munster in the time of Samdan,\n\nwho used to carry greetings from her to\n\nthe “sons of life” in that country. Once\n\nshe called him to her and bound him\n\nnot to add to nor take away a single word\n\nthat she said, nor a word that anyone\n\nshould say to whom he was sent. Then\n\nshe said to him: Say to Maelruain for\n\nme, said she (—or to Fer Da Chrich, and\n\nthis latter is more likely, since Maelruain\n\nwas more venerable than Samdan), that\n\nhe is my favourite among the clerics of\n\nthe Descert, and another thing thou shalt\n\nsay to him: ask, does he receive womankind\n\nto his confession, and will he\n\naccept my soul-friendship? The pedlar\n\ntook this message. But when he told\n\nhim that he was Samdan’s favourite,\n\nhe rose at once and raised both hands\n\nas in a cross-vigil and gave thanks to\n\nGod. When the pedlar asked him\n\nnext whether women took counsel of\n\nhim, and whether he would accept\n\nSamdan’s soul-friendship, he blushed\n\ndown to his breast, and made three\n\ngenuflections, and fell silent for a long\n\ntime. Then he said: Tell her, said he,\n\nthat I will seek counsel from her.\n\nThen the pedlar told all these sayings\n\nto Samdan, and she said: I trow,\n\nsaid she, something will come of that\n\nyouth. Then she draws her brooch\n\nout of her mantle and drives it into her\n\ncheek till it stuck in the bone, and then\n\nthere came out two filaments of milk: yet\n\nnot a single drop of blood came out. At\n\nthat sight the pedlar began to weep and\n\nwail. Then she took the wound between\n\ntwo fingers and began to squeeze it for\n\na long time, and not a drop was wrung\n\nfrom it. Then at last by reason of\n\np. 151.\n\nthe long squeezing out came a little\n\ntiny drop. It was a little drop of water,\n\nand there was a little yellow on the\n\nsurface enough to change its colour.\n\nThen she put this little driblet on her\n\nnail, and she said: So long, said\n\nshe, as there is this much juice in his\n\nbody, let him bestow no friendship\n\nnor confidence upon womankind.\n\n62. Devout young nuns he thinks\n\nit [right] to go and converse with and\n\nto confirm their faith, but without\n\nlooking on their faces, and taking an\n\nelder man in thy company: and it is\n\nright to converse with them standing\n\non the slab by the cross in front of the\n\nhostel, or in the retreat where they\n\nlive. And the elder who goes with\n\nthee, and the senior nun who lives in\n\ncompany with the young nuns, should\n\nbe present and not far from you, where\n\nthey are. When ill desires or ill thoughts\n\novertake thee, through seeing women or\n\nin converse with them, if . . . . . . .\n\nthat it is not to be indulged by thee\n\neven as an idle thought(?), then he\n\nconsiders that such desire is no great\n\nmatter: it is meritorious, however, if\n\na man gets clear of it. When the\n\nthoughts are constantly straying towards\n\nill meditations, they must be checked\n\nand recalled as far as possible; and he\n\nshould resort to reading or to examining\n\nhimself against it, and keep his mind\n\nfixed on prayer. He does not consider\n\nit easy to fix any penance for such\n\nstraying of the thoughts; for . . . . not\n\nmuch about it here at all.\n\n63. If a man constantly keeps to\n\nthe pittance prescribed by the Rule,\n\nboth as to the bread and the selann of\n\np. 152.\n\nbutter (that is, the half loaf and the\n\nquarter or other quantity), and the\n\n[proper amount of] drink, even though\n\nhuman weakness may stir desire, so that\n\nthere is an excitation of desire in his\n\nmembers (perhaps it may happen immediately\n\nwith meals, or it may happen\n\nin bed, whether he be asleep or awake,\n\nor perhaps he may escape it until\n\nmorning)—he counts it no great matter,\n\nprovided there be no yielding to desire.\n\nIf a man’s allowance be suddenly\n\ndiminished, that will cause sickness and\n\ndry internal piles. Everyone should\n\nregulate his pittance for himself,\n\nknowing the proper amount, that it\n\ncause not sickness, if it be too little;\n\nneither nourish vice, if it be too much:\n\nas much then as suffices him, and does\n\nnot induce sickness. It should be\n\nlimited according to men’s natures, for\n\nthe course of nature differs in each man.\n\nThis is what is laid down in the Rule of\n\nDoimine, Abbot of Rome; he holds it\n\nbetter and safer for a man’s soul to use\n\na small light pittance rather than a large\n\npittance of coarse food: for the small\n\nlight diet is better to sustain a man\n\nand make him healthy, and it excites\n\nhuman nature to ill desires less than\n\nthe large diet of coarse food.\n\n64. When it is grievous for anyone\n\nin regard to such elderly people as live\n\nwith him not to indulge them with\n\na change or increase of diet, while\n\nthou art chastising thyself to subdue\n\nthy desires and propensions, and they\n\ndo not observe this—(they suppose,\n\nhowever, that it is by way of abstinence\n\non thy part)—he considers it safer in\n\nsuch a case not to indulge them, even\n\nthough it be grievous to them, and\n\np. 153.\n\nhowever aged they may be, rather than\n\nthat to do anything that might be\n\ndeath to thy soul, or shouldest fail to\n\ndo penance for thy soul’s sins. Some,\n\nhowever, make false confessions about\n\nthemselves, in order to increase the\n\npenance laid upon them; but this is\n\nnot right.\n\n65. Now, to eat a meal with a dead\n\nman (though saintly) in the house is\n\nforbidden; but instead there are to be\n\nprayers and psalm-singing on such occasions.\n\nEven one in orders who brings\n\nthe sacrament to a sick man is obliged\n\nto go out of the house at once thereafter,\n\nthat the sick man die not in his presence;\n\nfor if he be present in the house\n\nat the death, it would not be allowable\n\nfor him to perform the sacrifice until a\n\nbishop should consecrate him. It happened\n\nonce on a time to Diarmait and\n\nto Blathmac mac Flaind that it was in\n\ntheir hands that Curui expired. When\n\nhe died, they were about to perform\n\nthe sacrifice thereafter, without being\n\nreconsecrated, till Colchu hindered them\n\nfrom doing so. The authority is Leviticus;\n\nand Diarmait also, the Abbot\n\nof Iona, was with him on that occasion.\n\n66. Once upon a time a certain\n\nmonk went on a journey to Findio mac\n\nFiatach. A woman happened to meet\n\nhim on the journey, et postulavit illa\n\nconcubitum eius. She laid hands upon\n\nhim at last, and there befell intercourse\n\nby tryst between them. Immediately\n\nthereafter he did not stay to wipe the\n\ntear from his cheek, till he came to Findio\n\nand confessed to him his fault. Findio\n\nsaid: That shall not matter. A demon\n\nhas contrived it, said he, to carry thee\n\noff from us, and to set thee among the\n\np. 154.\n\nlaity, and bring thee into a penitentiary,\n\nthat thou mayst be publicly put to\n\nshame. It shall not avail him, however;\n\nthou shalt not go into a penitentiary,\n\nneither shall he carry thee off\n\namong the laity. Thou shalt go to the\n\nsacrament, and shall continue under the\n\nsame rule through each fast. Satan\n\ncame thereafter to him and accosted\n\nhim, tempting him a second time, and\n\nsaid to him: The counsel Findio gives\n\nthee will be no great cleansing for thee.\n\nThis is what is good for thee to do: go\n\nto Comgell, that he may pass judgment on\n\nthee. He went accordingly and confessed\n\nto him, and Comgell said: Welcome\n\nindeed is thy coming: this thing will\n\nnot matter ; and Comgell said to him\n\nthe same things as Findio had said.\n\nWhen he came along from Benchor,\n\njust then Colum Cille’s curragh reached\n\nharbour, and Satan persuaded him to go\n\nto Columba. Thou shalt get no cure\n\nthrough Findio and Comgell, said he;\n\nthis is what is good for thee to do, go\n\nto Columba. So he went and made his\n\nconfession to him, and Columba said to\n\nhim: Thou hast crucified Christ once of\n\nthyself by sin; secondly, in the person of\n\nFindio, because thou didst not believe\n\nwhat he said by the Holy Spirit; thirdly,\n\nin the person of Comgell; fourthly, in\n\nmine. I pronounce upon thee, said\n\nColum Cille, fifteen years of penance\n\nbecause of the contempt thou hast shown\n\nfor a true limb of Christ—namely,\n\nFindio. Finit. (I have written this on\n\nmy own account, and these two tales;\n\nand it is not in ignorance, but to set\n\nthem forth that we proceed in this\n\nway.)\n\n67. A garment that is brought from\n\np. 155.\n\nthe laity a demon accompanies it until it\n\nhas been washed; and it is no protection\n\nto shake or beat it, but only to wash it.\n\nA certain anchorite lived in Clonmacnois,\n\nnamed Laisren, quite naked and\n\nfree from sin, with nothing on his conscience.\n\nNow he was infirm with disease;\n\nso each of the clerical students in\n\nturn used to take him home with him.\n\nA certain student had taken him home\n\none night, and put a cloak under him.\n\nLaisren slept upon his cloak. He sees a\n\ncarnal vision, and he never saw one from\n\nhis birth till that night. Then he rose\n\nup, and began to weep and lament.\n\nThen he began to perform a vigil, and\n\nrecited the Three Fifties with his vigil.\n\nThen a trance fell upon him, as he lay on\n\nhis face. Then an angel came to him and\n\nsaid to him: Be not sorrowful, said he;\n\nwhat thou hast felt this night thou shalt\n\nnot feel again in thy life. And this is\n\nwhat caused the thing: because the cloak\n\non which thou hast slept is the cloak of a\n\nwedded couple, and it has not been\n\nwashed since it was used by them. So,\n\nbecause it has not been washed, a demon\n\nhath . . . . For any cloak that is\n\ntaken from lustful people, a demon\n\naccompanies it so long as it is not\n\nwashed, etc.\n\n68. He does not commend fasting:\n\nhe prefers a regular measured pittance.\n\nThere is no Rule where it is imposed,\n\nexcept on account of injury done. There\n\nis one fast in Comgall’s rule—namely,\n\nthe Wednesday before Easter. However,\n\nColum Cille recognized three fasts only\n\nin the year: the eve of Epiphany—that\n\nis, twelve days after Christmas, and the\n\neighth part of Colum Cille’s loaf at that\n\np. 156.\n\ntime, with a seland and a bochtan of good\n\nmilk: that was the manner of that fast;\n\nand the first Wednesday of Lent, and\n\nthe first Wednesday after Pentecost:\n\nthe eighth of a loaf to each fast. However,\n\nColum Cille relaxed the fast of the\n\nPassion for the saints of Ireland, because\n\nold men died of that fast after the\n\nlong privations of Lent. A great festivity\n\nand merrymaking was regularly allowed\n\nby Colum Cille thereafter to the brethren:\n\nthe growth of the crops was given to\n\nthem then: three months were spent in\n\ntending and watering them. He called\n\nthat the Feast of the Ploughmen,\n\nbecause it was then that the crops\n\nreached their full growth.\n\n69. In Colum Cille’s Rule Saturday’s\n\nration is the same as Sunday’s, on account\n\nof the honour paid to the Sabbath\n\nin the Old Testament. It is only in\n\nrespect of work that it is distinguished\n\nfrom Sunday. In other Rules also\n\nthere is a similarity of rations on the\n\nSabbath and on Sunday. When, however,\n\nthere is in the Rules “superponat”\n\nor “superpositio,” this is properly applicable\n\nto a half-ration and half-fast;\n\n“cena careat,” however, is used when a\n\nfast is meant—that is, cena in nocte.\n\n70. It is all one whether one person\n\nor a number is present at the Beati or\n\nthe Mass; for there is no less efficacy in\n\nhis prayer if there be many present than\n\nif it be appropriated to himself alone—\n\njust as the light of the sun is no greater\n\nfor one man only than for a number.\n\n71. He makes much of going the\n\nthousand paces, or more, to visit the\n\ntenantry on Sunday; and the thousand\n\npaces have been left as an ordinance\n\nfor watching a sick man, and for\n\np. 157.\n\nadministering the communion to him,\n\nand to the young, and to the laity\n\nwho are under spiritual direction who\n\ncome to wait for the Mass, and to\n\nhear preaching, and for urgent matters\n\nbesides, etc.\n\n72. This I have heard Crundmael\n\nsay, that Maelruain never fasted but\n\nthrice since he settled at Tamlacht\n\n—namely, against Artri son of Faelmuire,\n\nabout a business that arose between the\n\nmonastery of Tallaght and him. After\n\nthe first fasting the king’s leg broke in\n\ntwo; after the second, the fire fell and\n\nburnt him from top to toe; after the\n\nthird fasting the king died.\n\n73. This is the authority for the\n\nhabitual use of gruel. There was a\n\ngreat gathering of the saints of Ireland\n\nin Mag Lena. This is what brought\n\nthem together: they were grieved that\n\npenitents died on bread and water in\n\nthe days of the elders who lived before\n\nthem. Then they fasted against God on\n\naccount of this. Then an angel came to\n\nthem and said to them: Wonder not,\n\nsaid he, if the bread and the water cannot\n\nsustain the penitents to-day. The\n\nfruits and plants of the earth have been\n\ndevastated; so that there is neither\n\nstrength nor force in them to-day to\n\nsupport anyone. The falsehood and sin\n\nand injustice of men have robbed the\n\nearth with its fruits of their strength\n\nand force. When men were obedient to\n\nGod’s will the plants of the earth retained\n\ntheir proper strength. At that time\n\nwater was no worse for sustaining anyone\n\nthan milk is to-day. Then the\n\nangel told them to mix some meal with\n\np. 158.\n\ntheir butter to make gruel, so that the\n\npenitents should not perish upon their\n\nhands(?), because the water and the\n\nbread did not suffice to support them.\n\n74. There were three kinds of gruel\n\nafter that—gruel upon water, and gruel\n\nbetween two waters (while it does\n\nnot sink right down to the bottom of\n\nthe vessel, it does not float above on\n\ntop of the water), and gruel under\n\nwater. However, [in this case] it\n\nreaches the bottom of the vessel; the\n\ngrain carries it downwards. Those\n\nwhose sins are lighter, and who deserve\n\na year or two of penance, get gruel\n\nupon water. Those, however, whose\n\nsins are graver, who deserve four or five\n\nyears, get gruel between two waters.\n\nThose, however, who have committed\n\ngreat sins, and deserve seven years or\n\nmore, as do bishops or priests who fall\n\ninto mortal sin, or homicides and so forth,\n\nget gruel under water, etc. A cleric by\n\nwhom a captive is killed should, he\n\nconsiders, do penance like any other\n\nhomicide.\n\n75. This is what Maelruain used to\n\nsay when anyone enjoined on him to\n\npray God for him, and to lift up the\n\nGospels towards him. Do ye pray\n\nGod for us, said he; and then ye\n\nshare our prayers with us though we\n\ndo not mention your names. For if\n\nanyone prays to God for us, we pray to\n\nGod for him, though we do not mention\n\neach man’s name.\n\n76. This is what Mac Oige of Lismore\n\nsaid in reply to a certain man who\n\ninquired of him which attribute of the\n\nclerical character it would be best for him\n\nto acquire. He replied: That attribute\n\nwith which he has never yet heard fault\n\np. 159.\n\nfound. If a man be distinguished [for\n\ncharity], said he, it is said that his\n\ncharity is too great; if humble, it is said\n\nagain that that man is too humble; if\n\nascetic, that his abstinence is excessive,\n\nand so with the rest. I have never heard,\n\nhowever, said he, of anyone of\n\nwhom it was said that “this man is too\n\nsteady”. Whatever task a man has set\n\nhis hand to, it is best for him to\n\npersevere in it, etc.\n\n77. There was a certain anchorite\n\nfrom Slane, in the north, named Colcu,\n\na kinsman of Mochutu. He was much\n\ngiven to austerities and strict abstinence.\n\nNow, he had dairying and\n\nstore of victuals given him by the\n\nmonastery. Then he used to make frequent\n\ndistributions to the poor. Then\n\nhe had a desire to leave all and to go to\n\nMaelruain, because he exercised his\n\nconscience about eating the produce of\n\nthe monastery, as to whether each man\n\nwho brought the produce was sufficiently\n\npure. Then the elders said to his\n\ncook that he should go along with\n\nhim to Maelruain. Then Maelruain\n\nasked him what caused his ill colour,\n\nbut he would not confess. Then the\n\ncook came and disclosed the diet on\n\nwhich he lived to Maelruain, and he\n\nwas greatly moved. Truly thou hast\n\nwrought an unnatural crime upon thyself,\n\nsaid Maelruain. I submit indeed,\n\nsaid he, to thy will therein. In the\n\nfirst place, said Maelruain, thou wilt\n\nnot fit in this place. It is under due\n\narrangement(?) at present, said he.\n\nThose who are here, said Maelruain,\n\nwhile they do their proper share of\n\nwork, are able to eat their rations.\n\nThou, therefore, wilt not fit among them.\n\np. 160.\n\nThou wilt neither do active work, nor be\n\nable to eat thy rations. Then he knelt\n\ndown in submission to the absolute will\n\nof Maelruain. This is my will truly,\n\nsaid he; so that thy life fail not, to make\n\nsome increase in that scanty pittance,\n\nwithout leaving thee free to refuse it or\n\ndesire it(?). But as to what shall be\n\nbrought to thee out of “the patron’s\n\nfruits,” said Maelruain, though all\n\nwho bring it be impure, it is pure for\n\nhim who is holy. It shall be exhibited\n\non the floor of thy house, for the patrons’\n\nfruit belongs rather to thee than to\n\nthem. It is not forbidden thee to lay\n\nit upon thy conscience to distribute to\n\nthe poor the fruits of the patron’s\n\nland.\n\n78. He does not consider it right for\n\nanyone not to exact confession about\n\neverything from him to whom thou\n\nart confessor, without sparing him\n\nat meal-time if thou happen to be\n\nbeside him, and he does not care about\n\nthe healing effect of that confession;\n\nthou shouldst read the Rule and the\n\nPenitential aloud in his presence,\n\nand [do not] spare such persons, lest\n\nthou perish through indulgence to\n\nanother.\n\n79. Now, he does not consider that\n\nit matters if anyone accepts the spiritual\n\ndirection or receives the confession of a\n\nman that is older or more venerable\n\nthan he is (for example his tutor\n\nor an elder brother), if there be no\n\none else at hand of sufficient authority\n\nfor him to consult with. He should\n\nnot, however, lay upon such persons\n\nstrict injunctions; but let him read\n\nthe books before them, so that he may\n\ngain the more knowledge(?).\n\np. 161.\n\n80. Now, continual fasting was\n\nnot practised by Comgall, and it is\n\nnot practised by the saints at present,\n\nsave one fast, namely the eve of Maundy\n\nThursday after the Wednesday. On the\n\neve of the Passion, however, no fast is to\n\nbe observed.\n\nColum Cille, however, kept three\n\nfasts in the year, with a half-ration on\n\neach of them, and this half-ration was\n\nliberal. As an equivalent for fasting,\n\nDiarmait used to allow two exactly\n\nequal rations to be made, whether it\n\nhappened to be coarse or light food, and\n\none of these to be given to God; the\n\nother he was to eat himself; and this\n\nserves in place of a fast.\n\n81. This precept Colccu got from\n\nEogan, that whoever had a carnal dream\n\non a Saturday night should receive\n\ncommunion on the morrow, and should\n\nperform the due observances on the\n\nSunday before receiving communion,\n\nthat is to say fifty or a hundred genuflections:\n\neven on a Sunday or a\n\nfestival he was not allowed to forget\n\nhis penance. This is not Maeldithruib’s\n\nway, but he orders the penance\n\non Sunday night.\n\nIt was Colccu’s opinion that those\n\nwho used to stand in water did so for\n\nthe purpose of crushing and subduing\n\ntheir desires and longings: or else\n\nsimply as an additional labour of piety.\n\n82. He does not forbid anyone to\n\nsleep his fill, provided that he diligently\n\nobserve the Hours, both day and night.\n\nHe thinks it better, moreover, for anyone\n\nwho may intend doing any pious act,\n\nto make a vow and to fulfil it forthwith.\n\nSolomon says: Qui observat ventum non\n\nseminabit: qui considerat nubes non metet.\n\np. 162.\n\n83. Now as to the Beati of the\n\nrefectory: it is proper for them to\n\nrepeat(?) the last . . . with their lips\n\nstanding after meals, and it should be\n\nsung in the refectory.\n\n84. A cleric who kills a captive he\n\nconsiders bound to do penance like any\n\nother homicide.\n\n85. Now the Gospel helps and\n\nassists the souls of those towards\n\nwhom it is lifted up, as it helps the\n\nliving, and it is his practice to lift\n\nit up towards the dead.\n\nOnce upon a time there arose a contention\n\nin Cluain mac Nois over a\n\ncontest for the abbacy. Then Adamnan\n\nset a stranger among them [as abbot].\n\nThen while Adamnan was in Iona, they\n\npersecuted the stranger, and deprived\n\nhim of his abbacy. Then he sent his\n\nmonks to Adamnan to complain against\n\nthem, and told them not to eat nor\n\nloose their shoes until they should have\n\nspeech of him. Adamnan told them to\n\neat on that night, and they did eat; and\n\nthe next day they were not admitted to\n\nhis presence until the third hour and\n\nthen they set forth their case to him,\n\nand Adamnan lifted up his hand holding\n\nthe Gospel at the moment when the\n\nfire . . . . the monks of Cluain mac\n\nNois. He did not suffer one of them to\n\nsit or lie down until they received the\n\nstranger back again. Then Adamnan\n\ntold the messengers to go home, and on\n\ntheir arrival they found their comrade\n\nin possession of the abbacy. And the\n\nmessengers asked the precise hour in\n\nwhich he was made abbot, and it\n\nwas the hour that Adamnan lifted up\n\nthe Gospel yonder; and afterwards he\n\nwas asked about so sudden a miracle,\n\nand he answered: Wonder not, said\n\nhe, that the sign of the Cross by the\n\np. 163.\n\npower of the Gospel traverses quicker\n\nthan a wink of the eye all the elements\n\nup to heaven. With like speed doth it\n\nreach the pit of torment; and it reaches\n\nthe sunrise and the sunset and the\n\nsouthern and northern ends of the\n\nworld in a single twinkling and\n\nvanquishes every obstacle.\n\n86. Maeldithruib lived on bread\n\nand water every Lent for the good\n\nof his father’s soul, usque ad novissimum\n\ntempus: for his prayers were always\n\noccupied therewith in Lent.\n\nThere were a certain layman and\n\nhis wife in Mugdoirn living under the\n\nspiritual guidance of Eocha ua Tuathail\n\nin lawful wedlock, and with ten sons.\n\nAfterwards his enemies murdered him,\n\nand all the lay folk, seeing this,\n\nsaid: What did it avail him to live\n\nvirtuously? Eochu came at once to\n\nDublitir and set forth his case to him;\n\nand Dublitir told him to distribute\n\nto the poor half or a third of the\n\nlayman’s substance, and that one of\n\nhis sons should offer to God his body\n\nand soul, and should observe on his\n\nbehalf the penance which he would\n\nhave performed, the pittance and vigil\n\nand labour, to the end of seven years;\n\nand that his wife also should do penance\n\non her own behalf and on her husband’s\n\nfor the same period. Then all this was\n\ndone, and his son and wife came to\n\ncommunion that day seven years. Then\n\nhe appeared on that night to Dublitir\n\nseven years after his death, and . . .\n\nwas his comeliness and he had glistering\n\nraiment about him. Then he gave\n\nDublitir a blessing for the help that\n\nhad been given him, and said to him,\n\nIn this night the Lord hath taken\n\np. 164.\n\npity on me and has brought me out of\n\nhell to the kingdom of heaven. And\n\nDublitir said: Who art thou? I\n\nam a wretched man: Eochu has thought\n\nupon me. Afterwards he appeared on\n\nthe self-same night to Eochu and to his\n\nson and wife and blessed them and said\n\nthe same words to them.\n\n87. “Praind do tomailt la marb”\n\nought to come here, and “Etach berar\n\ndo aes túate” next. “Nico molatarsom\n\nin troscud . . . annos” ought to come\n\nthen.\n\n88. When pollution happens to\n\nanyone in sleep, and he does not see\n\na dream-image, and does not remember\n\nseeing anything which should cause him\n\nto be polluted, he sings four psalms and\n\nwashes in water; and it does not hinder\n\nhis going to communion next day. For\n\nthis is no pollution to him, but it is an\n\nevil recollection of the spirit, accompanying\n\na discharge of some of the\n\nexcess of liquid that is in the body.\n\n89. Now he forbids anyone to sleep\n\nat meals. This, however, is what he\n\nthinks right—to dispatch the meal so\n\nthat no long while may be spent over\n\nit. That, however, is [not] incumbent\n\non everyone.\n\n90. Three things which are not\n\npleasing to God: good that is mixed\n\nwith evil: good that is begun but not\n\nbrought to an end: and help that comes\n\ntoo late, which would render aid if an\n\nattack should be made, and there is\n\nmade an attack which it does not help\n\n[to resist].\n\n© 2007 Thesaurus Linguae Hibernicae"
