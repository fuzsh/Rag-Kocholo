        "text": "This week’s theme is…Sublime Stillness! The mysterious art we call music refers merely to frequencies that fill the air around us, controlled in a specific way by its performers. Technically this may be true, but we sense feelings and motions of intense clarity. Sometimes the incredibly high density of musical events creates furious, busy textures. And at other times achingly long-breathed sustained notes create a sublime impression of meditative stillness that seems to suspend time itself. This week we look at some examples of this.\n\nSublime Stillness, Day 5 – “Tristes Apprets” from Castor and Pollux by Jean-Philippe Rameau\n\nJean Baptiste-Lully had done the impossible, and something that was unprecedented and hence unrepeated in the history of Western music: the Florentine had single-handedly created a national musical style for a foreign country and secured a practical monopoly on the art in the process. I first learned of Lully’s story decades ago and it still fascinates me, both for his character and relationship with the powerful monarch known as the Sun King, and also for the lovely, sumptuous and dramatic music that came of it. I happily listen to the great fruits of Lully’s collaboration with Louis XIV, his tragedies lyriques, produced annually during the last decade and a half of his life. This superb, balanced, and colorful form was the result of decades of preparation spent writing for the French in other forms, learning and perfecting the art of ballet, and intense study of the rhythms and melodic tendencies of the French language. And once all of this had been digested, Lully proceeded to create a form of opera, based on Italian dramatic models and infused with a healthy measure of French dance and spectacle, that fit the French language like a comfortable glove and also managed to pay obsequious tribute to the Sun King as a bonus. For more about this story you can see this post and this one.\n\nLully’s muscular music, his perpetually successful creative process, and his close relationship with the powerful monarch allowed him to leverage his influence and create what was essentially a monopoly over French opera during his lifetime. No one besides him could write or stage operas in France without his permission under the threat of crippling financial damages. As a result, no operas could be produced in France without his approval. Lully was in complete control.\n\nAnd not only during his lifetime. Lully’s creative legacy was so strong that even half a century after his death, the highly conservative musical culture that flowed from his power discouraged the creation of any operas that too extravagantly broke the mold of his tragedies lyrique. Even operas newly composed during this time were required to comport with the standards of Lully’s operatic forms, spectacles, manner of text setting, and the lovely but quite conventional harmonic language which governed the music found within. And it’s certainly not an insult to call Lully’s harmonic style “conventional”. It is most serviceable to its purpose and represents a hearty and pleasing expression of tonality in its early maturity. Lully grew up as the tonal system was getting its legs, coalescing from the modal system of harmony which governed the polyphony of the Renaissance; he and all of the other early opera composers were discovering this new language. You can read about some of the others here, here, and here.\n\nThis solid, serviceable tonality, cast in Lully’s sturdy and rather vanilla-sounding 5-part string textures (of which he wrote only the outer voices and left their filling out to his apprentices), allowed for hours of music to be written in faithful imitation. Although beautiful and quite elegant, none of it is all that extraordinary for its orchestral imagination or depth of feeling. The next great composer of France would achieve results in both of these areas, and initially experience a bit of blowback for it.\n\nThere are countless minor French composers who wrote operas during the generation right after Lully, but only one of them possessed a combination of traits necessary to make his mark in a way that still interests historians, namely the traits of technique, imagination and the courage of his convictions. Jean-Philippe Rameau had spent the first half of his career immersed in the theoretical study of music, summarizing his observations in a great Treatise on Harmony which is still worthy of study for the insights it reveals about the construction of tonal music. Much of the science of chord progression and inversion still taught today finds its roots (so to speak) in Rameau’s theories. Rameau’s theoretical work won him early fame and then, in a move that few expected, he turned his ambitions to writing French operas.\n\nSuperficially they were written according to the form and text-setting model of the elder Lully, but below the surface, Rameau saturated his operas with exciting new orchestral textures and harmonic statements which would never be at home in one of Lully’s operas. Perhaps Rameau suspected that his artistry would be met with controversy. But he was emboldened by the patronage of a wealthy customs official, Alexandre Jean Joseph Le Riche de La Poupeliniere.\n\nPoupeliniere, a product of the Enlightenment, delighted in staffing his household salon with artists, writers, poets and musicians. Voltaire was a frequent guest. Rameau directed Poupeliniere’s own personal high-quality orchestra, with which he was able to test many of his progressive musical works before releasing them to the Parisian public. Perhaps he tinkered with his first opera, Hippolyte and Aricie in this setting until he felt that it was just right, and then let it out to play among the opinionated listeners of the French old guard. Listen to this excerpt, sung by a trio of Fates, a justifiably famous example of Rameau’s intensely forward-looking harmony from Hippolyte and Aricie:\n\nThe sharp rhythms and gestures of the opening are Lullian, but twice as jagged. The harmonic progression in the middle made many conservative Parisians, loyal to Lully’s old style, hot and bothered. But Rameau had his instant supporters too, and the scandal and resulting pamphlet war is a pattern that would play out among the commentators of the French musical scene numerous times over the course of the ensuing centuries.\n\nAfter the initial controversy of his first opera had died down, Rameau felt at liberty to write operas more or less as he pleased and settled into a personal style that, even if not quite as biting as that found in the Trio of the Fates, was always affecting and imaginative with regard to harmony and orchestration. Where Lully was writing in grey, Rameau always wrote in color, precisely selecting his instrumental textures with flair. One of his most sublime feats of emotional painting is the placid aria from his second opera Castor and Pullox. In this aria, found in the first act, the heroine Telaire sings out her grief over her beloved Castor’s recent death. Rameau haunts us with a calm ocean of string sound through which the melancholy waves of bassoon arpeggios ripple. These are the only instruments supporting Telaire’s plaintive lament and the choice is inspired. Moment by moment we hear Rameau’s masterful inversions and control of dissonance, honed through his years of theoretical work.\n\nTristes Apprets is, to me, the most pointed example of the imagination and emotional mastery of Lully’s most important artistic successor, a successor who gave French listeners some vivid new colors just when they were ready, even if they didn’t all realize it at the time. Rameau is unmistakably French, looking ahead to Berlioz, Saint-Saens, and beyond, foreshadowing their customarily suave melodies and orchestration. Rameau was crucial in overcoming the primacy of Lully’s tasty but vanilla flavors which dominated the French musical imagination for just a little too long, and later generations are indeed indebted to the boldness of his vision and his courage to release it to what he knew was a rather conservative public, still stuck in adoration of a powerful figure who had made his considerable mark and died long ago.\n\n—\n\nWould you like Aaron of Smart and Soulful Music to provide customized program notes especially for your next performance?
