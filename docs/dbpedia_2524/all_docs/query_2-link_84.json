Ad Dominum.\n\nWHEN I was in trouble, I called upon the LORD, * and he heard me.\n\n2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, * and from a deceitful tongue.\n\n3 What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue? * even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.\n\n4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Meshech, * and to have my habitation among the tents of Kedar!\n\n5 My soul hath long dwelt among them * that are enemies unto peace.\n\n6 I labour for peace; but when I speak unto them thereof, * they make them ready to battle.\n\nPsalm 121. Levavi oculos.\n\nI WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills; * from whence cometh my help?\n\n2 My help cometh even from the LORD, * who hath made heaven and earth.\n\n3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; * and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.\n\n4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel * shall neither slumber nor sleep.\n\n5 The LORD himself is thy keeper; * the LORD is thy defence upon thy right hand;\n\n6 So that the sun shall not burn thee by day, * neither the moon by night.\n\n7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil; * yea, it is even he that shall keep thy soul.\n\n8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, * from this time forth for evermore.\n\nPsalm 122. Laetatus sum.\n\nI WAS glad when they said unto me, * We will go into the house of the LORD.\n\n2 Our feet shall stand in thy gates, * O Jerusalem.\n\n3 Jerusalem is built as a city * that is at unity in itself.\n\n4 For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD, * to testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the LORD.\n\n5 For there is the seat of judgment, * even the seat of the house of David.\n\n6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; * they shall prosper that love thee.\n\n7 Peace be within thy walls, * and plenteousness within thy palaces.\n\n8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, * I will wish thee prosperity.\n\n9 Yea, because of the house of the LORD our God, * I will seek to do thee good.\n\nPsalm 123. Ad te levavi oculos meos.\n\nUNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, * O thou that dwellest in the heavens.\n\n2 Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, * even so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until he have mercy upon us.\n\n3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; * for we are utterly despised.\n\n4 Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy, * and with the despitefulness of the proud.\n\nPsalm 124. Nisi quia Dominus.\n\nIF the LORD himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say; * if the LORD himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;\n\n2 They had swallowed us up alive; * when they were so wrathfully displeased at us.\n\n3 Yea, the waters had drowned us, * and the stream had gone over our soul.\n\n4 The deep waters of the proud * had gone even over our soul.\n\n5 But praised be the LORD, * who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.\n\n6 Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler; * the snare is broken, and we are delivered.\n\n7 Our help standeth in the Name of the LORD, * who hath made heaven and earth.\n\nPsalm 125. Qui confidunt.\n\nTHEY that put their trust in the LORD shall be even as the mount Sion, * which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.\n\n2 The hills stand about Jerusalem; * even so standeth the LORD round about his people, from this time forth for evermore.\n\n3 For the sceptre of the ungodly shall not abide upon the lot of the righteous; * lest the righteous put their hand unto wickedness.\n\n4 Do well, O LORD, * unto those that are good and true of heart.\n\n5 As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, * the LORD shall lead them forth with the evil doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.\n\nEvening Prayer.\n\nPsalm 126. In convertendo.\n\nWHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Sion, then were we like unto them that dream.\n\n2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, * and our tongue with joy.\n\n3 Then said they among the heathen, * The LORD hath done great things for them.\n\n4 Yea, the LORD hath done great things for us already; * whereof we rejoice.\n\n5 Turn our captivity, O LORD, * as the rivers in the south.\n\n6 They that sow in tears * shall reap in joy.\n\n7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed, * shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.\n\nPsalm 127. Nisi Dominus.\n\nEXCEPT the LORD build the house, * their labour is but lost that build it.\n\n2 Except the LORD keep the city, * the watchman waketh but in vain.\n\n3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness; * for so he giveth his beloved sleep.\n\n4 Lo, children, and the fruit of the womb, * are an heritage and gift that cometh of the LORD.\n\n5 Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant, * even so are the young children.\n\n6 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; * they shall not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.\n\nPsalm 128. Beati omnes.\n\nBLESSED are all they that fear the LORD, * and walk in his ways.\n\n2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: * O well is thee, and happy shalt thou be.\n\n3 Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine * upon the walls of thine house;\n\n4 Thy children like the olive-branches * round about thy table.\n\n5 Lo, thus shall the man be blessed * that feareth the LORD.\n\n6 The LORD from out of Sion shall so bless thee, * that thou shalt see Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long;\n\n7 Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children, * and peace upon Israel.\n\nPsalm 129. Saepe expugnaverunt.\n\nMANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up, * may Israel now say;\n\n2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up; * but they have not prevailed against me.\n\n3 The plowers plowed upon my back, * and made long furrows.\n\n4 But the righteous LORD * hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.\n\n5 Let them be confounded and turned backward, * as many as have evil will at Sion.\n\n6 Let them be even as the grass upon the housetops, * which withereth afore it be grown up;\n\n7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, * neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom.\n\n8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The LORD prosper you; * we wish you good luck in the Name of the LORD.\n\nPsalm 130. De profundis.\n\nOUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O LORD; * Lord, hear my voice.\n\n2 O let thine ears consider well * the voice of my complaint.\n\n3 If thou, LORD, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss, * O Lord, who may abide it?\n\n4 For there is mercy with thee; * therefore shalt thou be feared.\n\n5 I look for the LORD; my soul doth wait for him; * in his word is my trust.\n\n6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the morning watch; * I say, before the morning watch.\n\n7 O Israel, trust in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, * and with him is plenteous redemption.\n\n8 And he shall redeem Israel * from all his sins.\n\nPsalm 131. Domine, non est.\n\nLORD, I am not high-minded; * I have no proud looks.\n\n2 I do not exercise myself in great matters * which are too high for me.\n\n3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his mother: * yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.\n\n4 O Israel, trust in the LORD * from this time forth for evermore."
