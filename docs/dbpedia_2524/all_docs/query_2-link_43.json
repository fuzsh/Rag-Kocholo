Musical adaptations in the form of Latin motets are very famous in the Roman Catholic tradition. In the protestant world translation in metrical verse, supplied with special melodies, became typical for the churches in the calvinist tradition. The words were supplied by Clément Marot and Théodore de Bèze and they were set to music by many French Renaissance composers, like Claude Goudimel, Louis Bourgeois, Paschal de L'Estocart and Claude Le Jeune, but also by the more secular oriented Clément Janequin. A special mentioning deserve the early Dutch metrical psalter which uses secular tunes, the Souterliedekens, which were set to music by Jacobus Clemens non Papa.\n\nNote on the different numbering of the Psalms\n\nThere is a confusing difference in the numbering of the Psalms. This is caused by the fact that Latin versions have mostly followed St. Jerome's Vulgata (V) which adopted the numbering of the Septuaginta, the Greek translation of the Old Testament. Protestant translators returned to the numbering of the masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible (H). Almost all modern bible-editions (including the Nova vulgata) use the Hebrew numbering.\n\nA résumé of the differences\n\nPsalms 1-8 (V) = Psalms 1-8 (H)\n\nPsalm 9 (V) = Psalms 9,10 (H)\n\nPsalms 10-112 (V) = Psalms 11-113 (H)\n\nPsalm 113 (V) = Psalms 114,115 (H) (In exitu)\n\nPsalms 114,115 (V) = Psalm 116 (H) (Das ist mir lieb, J'aime mon dieu)\n\nPsalms 116-145 (V) = Psalms 117-146 (H)\n\nPsalms 146,147 (V) = Psalm 147 (H)\n\nPsalms 148-150 (V) = Psalms 148-150 (H)\n\ntip:\n\nExcept for 1-8 and 148-150 Psalms in Latin have one number less than the modern ones.\n\nWhen in the range of 113-116: double-check the numbering.\n\nInformation about performance\n\nIt is the custom in some circles, for example among Monks and Nuns, and in the Anglican Communion, in many Cathedrals, to sing the Psalms frequently. Schemes in which the entire Psalter was sung in a day, a week, or a month were common, with the last being perhaps the most common of all. The earliest tradition of singing the Psalms developed may have originated in the Jewish Synagogue or Temple, and evolved into plainsong, in which the Psalm was sung in unison to a Psalm tone, a formula for handling texts with different numbers of syllables and accent patterns. Elaboration of the plainsong Psalm tone, by adding Organum, singing the text and melody in parallel intervals, first octaves, later fifths, (and less commonly other intervals) later developed into complete harmonizations, called Faux-bourdons; these in turn evolved into Anglican chants.\n\nIt was the usual practice most places for the Gloria Patri (sometimes called the lesser doxology) to be appended to each Psalm, set of Psalms, sung to the same tone, generally as two \"extra\" verses of the Psalm.\n\nThe Psalter contained in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (BCP) of the Church of England is very little changed from the Psalter included in the first English Book of Common Prayer in 1549, and generally matches the Latin text most closely in syllable count and accent patterns; when it is necessary to sing an English text to a setting originally intended for a Latin text, the translation from the 1662 BCP is often a good starting point.\n\nThe scheme for reading the Psalter in a month, from the 1662 Church of England Book of Common Prayer:\n\nDay 1:\n\nMorning: Psalms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nEvening: Psalms 6, 7, 8\n\nDay 2:\n\nMorning: Psalms 9, 10, 11\n\nEvening: Psalms 12, 13, 14\n\nDay 3:\n\nMorning: Psalms 15, 16, 17\n\nEvening: Psalms 18\n\nDay 4:\n\nMorning: Psalms 19, 20,21\n\nEvening: Psalms 22, 23\n\nDay 5:\n\nMorning: Psalms 24, 25, 26\n\nEvening: Psalms 27, 28, 29\n\nDay 6:\n\nMorning: Psalms 30, 31\n\nEvening: Psalms 32, 33, 34\n\nDay 7:\n\nMorning: Psalms 35, 36\n\nEvening: Psalm 37\n\nDay 8:\n\nMorning: Psalms 38, 39, 40\n\nEvening: Psalms 41, 42, 43\n\nDay 9:\n\nMorning: Psalms 44, 45, 46\n\nEvening: Psalms 47, 48, 49\n\nDay 10:\n\nMorning: Psalms 50, 51, 52\n\nEvening: Psalms 53, 54, 55\n\nDay 11:\n\nMorning: Psalms 56, 57, 58\n\nEvening: Psalms 59, 60, 61\n\nDay 12:\n\nMorning: Psalms 62, 63, 64\n\nEvening: Psalms 65, 66, 67\n\nDay 13:\n\nMorning: Psalm 68\n\nEvening: Psalms 69, 70\n\nDay 14:\n\nMorning: Psalms 71, 72\n\nEvening: Psalms 73, 74\n\nDay 15:\n\nMorning: Psalms 75, 76, 77\n\nEvening: Psalm 78\n\nDay 16:\n\nMorning: Psalms 79, 80, 81\n\nEvening: Psalms 82, 83, 84, 85\n\nDay 17:\n\nMorning: Psalms 86, 87, 88\n\nEvening: Psalm 89\n\nDay 18:\n\nMorning: Psalms 90, 91, 92\n\nEvening: Psalms 93, 94\n\nDay 19:\n\nMorning: Psalms 95, 96, 97\n\nEvening: Psalms 98, 99, 100, 101\n\nDay 20:\n\nMorning: Psalms 102, 103\n\nEvening: Psalm 104\n\nDay 21:\n\nMorning: Psalm 105\n\nEvening: Psalm 106\n\nDay 22:\n\nMorning: Psalm 107\n\nEvening: Psalms 108, 109\n\nDay 23:\n\nMorning: Psalms 110, 111, 112, 113\n\nEvening: Psalms 114, 115\n\nDay 24:\n\nMorning: Psalms 116, 117, 118\n\nEvening: Psalm 119:1–32\n\nDay 25:\n\nMorning: Psalm 119:33–72\n\nEvening: Psalm 119:73–104\n\nDay 26:\n\nMorning: Psalm 119:105–144\n\nEvening: Psalm 119:145–176\n\nDay 27:\n\nMorning: Psalms 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125\n\nEvening: Psalms 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131\n\nDay 28:\n\nMorning: Psalms 132, 133, 134, 135\n\nEvening: Psalms 136, 137, 138\n\nDay 29:\n\nMorning: Psalms 139, 140, 141\n\nEvening: Psalms 142, 143\n\nDay 30:\n\nMorning: Psalms 144, 145, 146\n\nEvening: Psalms 147, 148, 149, 150\n\nIn months with 31 days, the Psalms of day 30 are repeated.\n\nGregorian\n\nTypes of psalmody\n\nWhereas the choice of psalm texts depends on the liturgical calendar or prescripitions, the choice of reciting tone will depend on various elements:\n\nthe liturgical occasion (office or eucharist)\n\ntiming of the psalm (after a reading, during a liturgical action (introits, for example), in its own right (most of the office)\n\nthe solemnity of the occasion (Sundays vs weekdays, feasts, Holy Week, …)\n\nthe kind of performance that one seeks (or that is warranted by the occasion):\n\ndirect psalmody - sung by choir or soloist in its entirety (e.g. the various Tractus settings in Lent, or the Canticles of the Paschal vigil)\n\nantiphonal psalmody - an antiphon or 'refrain' is sung before and after the psalm verse(s), which are performed by a soloist (e.g. the responsoria prolixa from matins, responsory psalms from the mass, Venite adoremus after the invitatory)\n\nresponsorial psalmody, whereby the congregations splits up into 2 halves and alternates between even and uneven verses, thus singing the psalm in its entirety (e.g. most of the office psalms)\n\nPsalm tones\n\nThe choice of reciting tone also depends on the mode of the antiphon it follows. Antiphons in 2nd mode will take a reciting tone in the 2nd mode, etc.\n\nMost modes have a number of different tones associated with them, the so-called differentiae (singular: differentia). The main point in using differentiae is to choose one whose final cadence leads to the first note of the antiphon that follows. An overview of the modes with all their differentiae can be found in the Liber Usualis.\n\nA psalm tone consists of 4 elements:\n\nintonation: a fixed fomula intoning the psalm, taking the melody up to the reciting tone or tenor,\n\ntenor: sometimes called tuba, the equivalent of our modern dominant, which takes the majority of the verse text,\n\nmediatio: or suspending cadence, halfway through the verse (marked with an asterisk * in many editions)\n\nterminatio: or final cadence, ending on one of several possible differentiae.\n\nThe most common way to fit text unto a psalm tone is by counting the word stresses. Most tones have a final cadence on either one or two word stresses. Given the variable length of the texts, there are various possibilities to treat these:\n\nif the accents have the occasional unaccented syllables between them, one or more notes are added to the tone cadence. These are called epenthesis. If they precede the final stress, they are epenthesis intercalata, if they preced the penultimate accent, they are epenthesis anticipata.\n\nif the portion of text between these syllables is too long for singing comfort, e.g. et de regiónibus congregávit eos (psalm 107), the words stress is abandoned in favour of the cadence.\n\nDoxology\n\nSince the addition of the Gloria Patri is so common (and not only to Psalms), the doxology is often unwritten or given in abbreviated form: the variable ending of the chanted psalm tone will be indicated by the final six vowels, EUOUAE (\"sEcUlOrUm AmEn.\" G. H. Palmer's Plainchant Gradual gives the English equivalent o i ou e a e (\"world without end. Amen.\")\n\nAntiphons\n\nAnglican\n\nMetrical\n\nIncipits\n\nVulgate\n\nLatin text\n\nNo. Vulgate BOCP 1 Beatus vir, qui non abiit Blessed is the man that hath not walked… 2 Quare fremuerunt gentes Why do the heathen so furiously rage 3 Domine, quid multiplicati?
