        "text": "The Psalms of David\n\nDay 27. Evening Prayer\n\nPsalm 126.\n\nIn convertendo\n\nWhen the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion : then were we like unto them that dream.\n\n2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter : and our tongue with joy.\n\n3 Then said they among the heathen : The Lord hath done great things for them.\n\n4 Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already : whereof we rejoice.\n\n5 Turn our captivity, O Lord : as the rivers in the south.\n\n6 They that sow in tears : shall reap in joy.\n\n7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed : shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.\n\nPsalm 127.\n\nNisi Dominus\n\nExcept the Lord build the house : their labour is but lost that build it.\n\n2 Except the Lord keep the city : the watchman waketh but in vain.\n\n3 It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness : for so he giveth his beloved sleep.\n\n4 Lo, children and the fruit of the womb : are an heritage and gift that cometh of the Lord.\n\n5 Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant : even so are the young children.\n\n6 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them : they shall not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.\n\nPsalm 128.\n\nBeati omnes\n\nBlessed are all they that fear the Lord : and walk in his ways.\n\n2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands : O well is thee, and happy shalt thou be.\n\n3 Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine : upon the walls of thine house.\n\n4 Thy children like the olive-branches : round about thy table.\n\n5 Lo, thus shall the man be blessed : that feareth the Lord.\n\n6 The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee : that thou shalt see Jerusalem in prosperity all thy life long.\n\n7 Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.\n\nPsalm 129.\n\nSaepe expugnaverunt\n\nMany a time have they fought against me from my youth up : may Israel now say.\n\n2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up : but they have not prevailed against me.\n\n3 The plowers plowed upon my back : and made long furrows.\n\n4 But the righteous Lord : hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.\n\n5 Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.\n\n6 Let them be even as the grass growing upon\n\nthe house-tops : which withereth afore it be plucked up;\n\n7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand : neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom.\n\n8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you : we wish you good luck in the Name of the Lord.\n\nPsalm 130.\n\nDe profundis\n\nOut of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord : Lord, hear my voice.\n\n2 O let thine ears consider well : the voice of my complaint.\n\n3 If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss : O Lord, who may abide it?\n\n4 For there is mercy with thee : therefore shalt thou be feared.\n\n5 I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him : in his word is my trust.\n\n6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord : before the morning watch, I say, before the morning watch.\n\n7 O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy : and with him is plenteous redemption.\n\n8 And he shall redeem Israel : from all his sins.\n\nPsalm 131.\n\nDomine, non est\n\nLord, I am not high-minded : I have no proud looks.\n\n2 I do not exercise myself in great matters : which are too high for me.\n\n3 But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his mother : yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.\n\n4 O Israel, trust in the Lord : from this time forth for evermore."
