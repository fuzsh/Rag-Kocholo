        "text": "A chapter by John O'Flynn that outlines developments in choral and vocal music at St Patrick's College in Dublin (a teacher education and liberal arts college) from the end of the nineteenth century to 2016. Part of the book co-edited by John Buckley and John O'Flynn, published by Peter Lang.\n\nThe Choral Torah is a new publication of choral arrangements that uses fresh four-part harmony to reanimate ancient texts. Its mission is to promote musical and biblical literacy, using mindful singing and deep listening to foster stronger connections within Jewish communities. This introduction by Matthew Austerklein offers a theological reflection to the religious meaning and opportunity of choral music in the 21st century."
