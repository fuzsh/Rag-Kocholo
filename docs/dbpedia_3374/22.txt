Hadleigh opted to put the visitors into bat first and bowled them out for 132 a total which included 102 from Ahmed Khawaja.

Owen Lynch took three wickets in just eight balls and conceded just one run while Richard Revell, Adam Soilleux and Sam Handley all took two wickets each.

But Hadleigh were dismissed for 112 in their innings with Paul Tibbenham top scoring with 29, much to the annoyance of Soilleux.

“It was a game we should have won,” said Soilleux.

“We bowled well and dominated for the majority of their innings.

“We had them 77-7 but at that point their only batsman to make a notable score was still at crease.

“He then decided to open up and play more aggressively and that worked in his favour.

“He ended up scoring 102 but we dropped him when he was on 70 odd and so could easily have bowled them out for under 100.

“If we want to win these close games we have to stop dropping catches.”

However, Soilleux felt Hadleigh should still have been able to come out on top.

“We should have been able to chase 132,” said Soilleux, whose side sit just three points above the drop zone.

“The ball was seaming around but we showed little application with the bat and were 4-3 early on.

“We recovered slightly to 74-5 but we then lost two wickets in three balls.

“Paul Tibbenham provided resistance throughout and was the last man out for 30.

“Richard Revell had a quick fire 28 but it wasn’t quite enough as we ended 20 runs short.”
