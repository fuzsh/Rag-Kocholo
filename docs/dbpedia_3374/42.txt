… claims hat-trick in second match

MALTEENOES Sports Club’s 26-year-old all-rounder Kellon Carmichael has made an impressive start to his career in England where he was representing Hadleigh and Thundersley Cricket Club (HTCC) of Essex in that County’s Sunday League Premier division last weekend.

Having seen their first round match being washed out, HTCC faced Buckhurst Hill Cricket Club First XI last Saturday and suffered a five-wicket loss, despite Carmichael’s three of the five wickets Buckhurst lost in their run chase.

Winning the toss and opting to bat first, HTCC lost Oliver Smith (3) in the second over, from which they never recovered and were bowled out for 137 off 41.5 overs, despite 60 off 87 balls with 11 fours from Adam Soilleux, with Carmichael contributing 11 with two fours, batting at number four.

Shane Cassel took 5 for 29 for Buckhurst, who in reply reached 141 for 5 from 31.5 overs, led by an unbeaten 43 (70 balls, 6×4) from Haroon Khan and Ian Russell’s 42 (53 balls, 5×4), as Carmichael took 3 for 45 and Richard Revell 2 for 33.

In their third game of the season that was played last Sunday against Bardoli Cricket Club, HTCC electing to bat first on winning the toss were bowled out for 127 in 29.1 overs, with Carmichael topscoring with 48 (58 balls, 6×4, 1×6), backed by 25 (30 balls, 4×4) from Smith.

Abdul Samad-Hafesji took 5 for 17 from 6.1 overs for Bardoli, who in reply were scuttled out for an even 50 off 12.3 overs, as only Naeem Budi and Imtiyaz Dawood with 14 each offered resistance to Carmichael, who claimed 7 for 16 including a hat-trick and his new-ball partner David Williams who supported with 3 for 32.

In an invited comment, the soft-spoken Carmichael told Chronicle Sport he welcomed the experience, adding that the conditions were challenging especially batting-wise.

“So far, the experience has been really welcoming for me, with the conditions being challenging especially batting-wise along with the weather which has been a challenge for me with these conditions as I am not accustomed to this weather pattern.

“My bowling has been great and the ball is coming out of the hand good. I have been getting wickets and bowling well and to achieve a hat-trick was outstanding for me and also my first five-wicket haul and as far as batting is concerned, I am getting attuned to the conditions, while I am welcoming the experience and looking to move from strength to strength,” said Carmichael.
