The selected proteases, trypsin and chymotrypsin, clearly modified several membrane proteins of both bovine and equine RBC, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis; however, the protease treatments also modified the sialic acid content exclusively in bovine RBC, as demonstrated by lectin blot analysis. An in vitro growth assay using the protease-treated RBC showed that the trypsin-treated bovine RBC, but not the chymotrypsin-treated ones, significantly reduced the growth of B. bovis and B. bigemina as compared to the control. In contrast, the growth of B. equi and B. caballi was not affected by any of these proteases. Thus, the bovine, but not the equine, Babesia parasites require the trypsin-sensitive membrane (sialoglyco) proteins to infect the RBC.\n\nEffects of different dietary conditions on the expression of trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like protease genes in the digestive system of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpit, Jornt; Zels, Sven; Dillen, Senne; Holtof, Michiel; Wynant, Niels; Vanden Broeck, Jozef\n\n2014-05-01\n\nWhile technological advancements have recently led to a steep increase in genomic and transcriptomic data, and large numbers of protease sequences are being discovered in diverse insect species, little information is available about the expression of digestive enzymes in Orthoptera. Here we describe the identification of Locusta migratoria serine protease transcripts (cDNAs) involved in digestion, which might serve as possible targets for pest control management. A total of 5 putative trypsin and 15 putative chymotrypsin gene sequences were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these are distributed among 3 evolutionary conserved clusters. In addition, we have determined the relative gene expression levels of representative members in the gut under different feeding conditions. This study demonstrated that the transcript levels for all measured serine proteases were strongly reduced after starvation. On the other hand, larvae of L. migratoria displayed compensatory effects to the presence of Soybean Bowman Birk (SBBI) and Soybean Trypsin (SBTI) inhibitors in their diet by differential upregulation of multiple proteases. A rapid initial upregulation was observed for all tested serine protease transcripts, while only for members belonging to class I, the transcript levels remained elevated after prolonged exposure. In full agreement with these results, we also observed an increase in proteolytic activity in midgut secretions of locusts that were accustomed to the presence of protease inhibitors in their diet, while no change in sensitivity to these inhibitors was observed. Taken together, this paper is the first comprehensive study on dietary dependent transcript levels of proteolytic enzymes in Orthoptera. Our data suggest that compensatory response mechanisms to protease inhibitor ingestion may have appeared early in insect evolution. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the effects of activities of chymotrypsin and trypsin enzymes on fluorescence lifetime distributions of the substrat bovine serum albumin (BSA) modified with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PM) were examined. In the labeling study of BSA with PM, it is aimed to attach PM to the single free thiol (Cys34) and to all the free amine groups in accessible positions in order to produce excimers of pyrene planes of the possible highest amount to form the lifetime distributions in the widest range, that may show specifically distinguishing changes resulting from the activities of the proteases. The time resolved spectrofluorometer was used to monitor fluorescence decays, which were analyzed by using the exponential series method (ESM) to obtain the changes of lifetime distributions. After the exposure of the synthesized substrat PM-BSA to the enzymes, the fluorescence lifetime distributions exhibited different structures which were attributed to the different activities of the proteases.\n\nThe modifier effects of chymotrypsin and trypsin enzymes on fluorescence lifetime distribution of \"N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide-bovine serum albumin\" complex.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃzyiÄit, Ä°brahim Ethem; KarakuÅ, Emine; Pekcan, Ãnder\n\n2016-02-05\n\nChymotrypsin and trypsin are the well known proteolytic enzymes, both of which are synthesized in the pancreas as their precursors - the inactive forms; chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen - and then are released into the duodenum to cut proteins into smaller peptides.

The peptide codes were designed to contain a coding region and the substrate of protease for enzymatic cleavage, respectively, and an internal standard method was proposed for the MS quantitation of the cleavage products of these peptide codes. Upon the cleavage reaction in the presence of target proteases, the coding regions were released from the microplate, which were directly quantitated by using corresponding peptides with one-amino acid difference as the internal standards. The coding region could be used as the unique \"Protease ID\" for the identification of corresponding protease, and the amount of the cleavage product was used for protease activity analysis. Using trypsin and chymotrypsin as the model proteases to verify the multiplex protease assay, the designed \"Trypsin ID\" and \"Chymotrypsin ID\" occurred at m/z 761.6 and 711.6. The logarithm value of the intensity ratio of \"Protease ID\" to internal standard was proportional to trypsin and chymotrypsin concentration in a range from 5.0 to 500 and 10 to 500 nM, respectively. The detection limits for trypsin and chymotrypsin were 2.3 and 5.2 nM, respectively. The peptide-encoded microplate showed good selectivity. This proposed method provided a powerful tool for convenient identification and activity analysis of multiplex proteases.\n\nEffect of conformational mobility and hydrogen-bonding interactions on the selectivity of some guanidinoaryl-substituted mechanism-based inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases.\n\nPubMed\n\nRai, R; Katzenellenbogen, J A\n\n1992-11-13\n\nPreviously, we have reported that some guanidino-substituted alpha- and beta-aryl enol lactones I and II behaved as selective, mechanism-based inhibitors of some trypsin-like proteases (Rai, R.; Katzenellenbogen, J.A. J. Med. Chem., submitted). In this study, we describe the synthesis and kinetic evaluation of some related, guanidino-substituted enol lactones having greater conformational mobility and affording additional hydrogen-bonding sites at the active site. The alpha-aryl-substituted lactones 1 and 2, which have greater conformational mobility in the guanidinoaryl linkage than I, selectively inhibited the trypsin-like enzymes, and they were relatively poor inactivators of alpha-chymotrypsin and human neutrophil elastase (HNE). The iodo enol lactone 2 permanently inactivated trypsin, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasmin, showing exceptionally high specificity in its interaction with trypsin and urokinase. The selectivity pattern exhibited by the closely related, conformationally less mobile alpha-aryl-substituted iodo lactone Ib, which was previously shown to be a selective suicide substrate of urokinase and plasmin, provides an interesting comparison. The alpha-benzamido-substituted lactones 3 and 4, which afford an additional site for active-site hydrogen bonding, were found to be very potent alternate substrate inhibitors of trypsin and urokinase. In addition, the iodo lactone 4 permanently inactivated alpha-chymotrypsin. The importance of secondary interactions in increasing the specificities in the case of alpha-chymotrypsin is discussed.\n\nKunitz-type protease inhibitors group B from Solanum palustre.\n\nPubMed\n\nSperansky, Anna S; Cimaglia, Fabio; Krinitsina, Anastasya A; Poltronieri, Palmiro; Fasano, Pasqua; Bogacheva, Anna M; Valueva, Tatiana A; Halterman, Dennis; Shevelev, Alexei B; Santino, Angelo\n\n2007-11-01\n\nFive Kunitz protease inhibitor group B genes were isolated from the genome of the diploid non-tuber-forming potato species Solanum palustre. Three of five new genes share 99% identity to the published KPI-B genes from various cultivated potato accessions, while others exhibit 96% identity. Spls-KPI-B2 and Spls-KPI-B4 proteins contain unique substitutions of the most conserved residues usually involved to trypsin and chymotrypsin-specific binding sites of Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI)-B, respectively. To test the inhibition of trypsin and chymotrypsin by Spls-KPI proteins, five of them were produced in E. coli purified using a Ni-sepharose resin and ion-exchange chromatography. All recombinant Spls-KPI-B inhibited trypsin; K(i) values ranged from 84.8 (Spls-KPI-B4), 345.5 (Spls-KPI-B1), and 1310.6 nM (Spls-KPI-B2) to 3883.5 (Spls-KPI-B5) and 8370 nM (Spls-KPI-B3). In addition, Spls-KPI-B1 and Spls-KPI-B4 inhibited chymotrypsin. These data suggest that regardless of substitutions of key active-center residues both Spls-KPI-B4 and Spls-KPI-B1 are functional trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitors.\n\n[Comparative analysis of sensitivity of proteases (chymotrypsin and trypsin) and cholinesterases of different origin to some organophosphorus inhibitors].\n\nPubMed\n\nRozengart, E V\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe antichymotrypsin, antitrypsin, and anticholinesterase efficiencies of four homologous series of organophosphorus inhibitors are compared: O-ethyl-S-(n-alkyl)methylthiophosphonates, O-(n-alkyl)-S-(n-butyl)methylthiophosphonates, O-(n-alkyl)-S-beta-(ethylmercaptoethylene)methylthiophosphonates, and their methylsulfomethylates. As sources of a-chymotrypsin and trypsin, commercial compounds of Worthington Biochemical Corporation and Leningrad Myasokombinat were tested. Bimolecular constant of the reaction rate was used as the measure of antienzyme efficiency. In all cases, the antichymotrypsin efficiency was lower, while the antitrypsin--essentially higher than the anticholinesterase activity of the studied inhibitors. These differences were found to much depend both on the inhibitor structure and on nature of the cholinesterase compounds.\n\nPreparation and evaluation of dual-enzyme microreactor with co-immobilized trypsin and chymotrypsin.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeller, Kinga; Pomastowski, PaweÅ; GrzywiÅski, Damian; Szumski, MichaÅ; Buszewski, BogusÅaw\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe preparation of capillary microfluidic reactor with co-immobilized trypsin and chymotrypsin with the use of a low-cost commercially available enzymatic reagent (containing these proteases) as well as the evaluation of its usefulness in proteomic research were presented. The monolithic copolymer synthesized from glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) was used as a support. Firstly, the polymerization conditions were optimized and the monolithic bed was synthesized in the fused silica capillary modified with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (Î³-MAPS). The polymer containing epoxy groups was then modified with 1,6-diaminohexane, followed by the attachment of glutaraldehyde and immobilization of enzymes. The efficiency of the prepared monolithic Immobilized Enzyme Microreactor (Î¼-IMER) with regard to trypsin activity was evaluated using the low-molecular mass compound (NÎ±-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester, BAEE). The activities of both enzymes were investigated using a macromolecular protein (human transferrin, Tf) as a substrate. In the case of BAEE, the reaction product was separated from the substrate using the capillary liquid chromatography and the efficiency of the reaction was determined by the peak area of the substrate. The hydrolysis products of transferrin were analyzed with MALDI-TOF which allows for the verification of the prepared enzymatic system applicability in the field of proteomic research.

Each rat received sodium oleate in a dose of 0.12 mmol.h-1 via a duodenal tube. Sodium oleate infusion significantly increased pancreatic secretion (volume and protein output) compared with the saline given the control group. The increase in pancreatic secretion paralleled significant elevations of plasma concentrations of secretin and cholecystokinin. To determine a possible role of pancreatic proteases on the responses induced by sodium oleate, saline, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, a combination of chymotrypsin and trypsin or pancreatic juice was infused into the duodenum. The pancreatic secretion was significantly reduced by pancreatic proteases or pancreatic juice, and the reduction paralleled the decreases in plasma concentrations of the two hormones. These agents suppressed both pancreatic secretion and plasma hormone levels in the following order of magnitude: (pancreatic juice or chymotrypsin + trypsin) greater than (trypsin) greater than (chymotrypsin). The reduction of pancreatic secretion by pancreatic proteases was reversed by intravenous administration of secretin and cholecystokinin in physiological doses. It is concluded that negative-feedback regulation of pancreatic secretion is operative in the intestinal phase in rats and that both secretin and cholecystokinin are involved in the regulation.\n\nAllergenic characterization of a novel allergen, homologous to chymotrypsin, from german cockroach.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeong, Kyoung Yong; Son, Mina; Lee, Jae Hyun; Hong, Chein Soo; Park, Jung Won\n\n2015-05-01\n\nCockroach feces are known to be rich in IgE-reactive components. Various protease allergens were identified by proteomic analysis of German cockroach fecal extract in a previous study. In this study, we characterized a novel allergen, a chymotrypsin-like serine protease. A cDNA sequence homologous to chymotrypsin was obtained by analysis of German cockroach expressed sequence tag (EST) clones. The recombinant chymotrypsins from the German cockroach and house dust mite (Der f 6) were expressed in Escherichia coli using the pEXP5NT/TOPO vector system, and their allergenicity was investigated by ELISA. The deduced amino acid sequence of German cockroach chymotrypsin showed 32.7 to 43.1% identity with mite group 3 (trypsin) and group 6 (chymotrypsin) allergens. Sera from 8 of 28 German cockroach allergy subjects (28.6%) showed IgE binding to the recombinant protein. IgE binding to the recombinant cockroach chymotrypsin was inhibited by house dust mite chymotrypsin Der f 6, while it minimally inhibited the German cockroach whole body extract. A novel allergen homologous to chymotrypsin was identified from the German cockroach and was cross-reactive with Der f 6.\n\nEffects of black-eyed pea trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor on proteolytic activity and on development of Anthonomus grandis.\n\nPubMed\n\nFranco, OctÃ¡vio L; dos Santos, Roseane C; Batista, JoÃ£o A N; Mendes, Ana Cristina M; de AraÃºjo, Marcus AurÃ©lio M; Monnerat, Rose G; Grossi-de-SÃ¡, Maria FÃ¡tima; de Freitas, Sonia M\n\n2003-06-01\n\nThe cotton boll weevil Anthonomus grandis (Boheman) is one of the major pests of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the New World. This feeds on cotton floral fruits and buds causing severe crop losses. Digestion in the boll weevil is facilitated by high levels of serine proteinases, which are responsible for the almost all proteolytic activity. Aiming to reduce the proteolytic activity, the inhibitory effects of black-eyed pea trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor (BTCI), towards trypsin and chymotrypsin from bovine pancreas and from midguts of A. grandis larvae and adult insects were analyzed. BTCI, purified from Vigna unguiculata (L.) seeds, was highly active against different trypsin-like proteinases studied and moderately active against the digestive chymotrypsin of adult insects. Nevertheless, no inhibitory activity was observed against chymotrypsin from A. grandis larval guts. To test the BTCI efficiency in vivo, neonate larvae were reared on artificial diet containing BTCI at 10, 50 and 100 microM. A reduction of larval weight of up to approximately 54% at the highest BTCI concentration was observed. At this concentration, the insect mortality was 65%. This work constitutes the first observation of a Bowman-Birk type inhibitor active in vitro and in vivo toward the cotton boll weevil A. grandis. The results of bioassays strongly suggest that BTCI may have potential as a transgene protein for use in engineered crop plants modified for heightened resistance to the cotton boll weevil.\n\nCharacterization of cDNAs encoding serine proteases and their transcriptional responses to Cry1Ab protoxin in the gut of Ostrinia nubilalis larvae\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nSerine proteases, such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, are the primary digestive enzymes in lepidopteran larvae, and are also involved in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protoxin activation and protoxin/toxin degradation.

This study was undertaken to further evaluate the protease inhibitory potential of gpMuc, a multiform glycoprotein, and other protein fractions from M. pruriens seeds against trypsin, chymotrypsin, Echis carinatus snake venom, ecarin and thrombin. The results showed that gpMuc inhibited both trypsin and chymotrypsin activities and was thermally stable, maintaining its trypsin inhibitory activity at temperatures of up to 50Â°C. Its structural conformation was also maintained at pH ranges of 4-7. Immunoreactivity study confirms that it contains protease-recognizing epitope on one of its isoforms. The whole protein extract of M. pruriens seeds inhibited prothrombin activation by ecarin and whole E. carinatus venom, and also thrombin-like activity using chromogenic assay.

This proteolytic treatment specifically cleaves VP4, the protein that forms the spikes on the surface of the virions, to polypeptides VP5 and VP8. This cleavage has been reported to occur in rotavirus SA114fM at two conserved, closely spaced arginine residues located at VP4 amino acids 241 and 247. In this work, we have characterized the VP4 cleavage products of rotavirus SA114S generated by in vitro treatment of the virus with increasing concentrations of trypsin and with proteases AspN and alpha-chymotrypsin. The VP8 and VP5 polypeptides were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and by Western blotting (immunoblotting) with antibodies raised to synthetic peptides that mimic the terminal regions of VP4 generated by the trypsin cleavage. It was shown that in addition to arginine residues 241 and 247, VP4 is cleaved at arginine residue 231. These three sites were found to have different susceptibilities to trypsin, Arg-241 > Arg-231 > Arg-247, with the enhancement of infectivity correlating with cleavage at Arg-247 rather than at Arg-231 or Arg-241. Proteases AspN and alpha-chymotrypsin cleaved VP4 at Asp-242 and Tyr-246, respectively, with no significant enhancement of infectivity, although this enhancement could be achieved by further treatment of the virus with trypsin. The VP4 end products of trypsin treatment were a homogeneous VP8 polypeptide comprising VP4 amino acids 1 to 231 and a heterogeneous VP5, which is formed by two polypeptide species (present at a ratio of approximately 1:5) as a result of cleavage at either Arg-241 or Arg-247. A pathway for the trypsin activation of rotavirus infectivity is proposed. PMID:8709201\n\nCharacterization of the molecular features and expression patterns of two serine proteases in Hermetia illucens (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) larvae.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Wontae; Bae, Sungwoo; Kim, Ayoung; Park, Kwanho; Lee, Sangbeom; Choi, Youngcheol; Han, Sangmi; Park, Younghan; Koh, Youngho\n\n2011-06-01\n\nTo investigate the molecular scavenging capabilities of the larvae of Hermetia illucens, two serine proteases (SPs) were cloned and characterized. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of Hi-SP1 and Hi-SP2 were suggested that Hi-SP1 may be a chymotrypsin- and Hi-SP2 may be a trypsin-like protease. Hi-SP1 and Hi-SP2 3-D homology models revealed that a catalytic triad, three disulfide bonds, and a substrate-binding pocket were highly conserved, as would be expected of a SP. E. coli expressed Hi-SP1 and Hi-SP2 showed chymotrypsin or trypsin activities, respectively. Hi-SP2 mRNAs were consistently expressed during larval development. In contrast, the expression of Hi-SP1 mRNA fluctuated between feeding and molting stages and disappeared at the pupal stages. These expression pattern differences suggest that Hi-SP1 may be a larval specific chymotrypsin-like protease involved with food digestion, while Hi-SP2 may be a trypsin-like protease with diverse functions at different stages.\n\nsup 1 H assignments and secondary structure determination of the soybean trypsin/chymotrypsin Bowman-Birk inhibitor\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWerner, M.H.; Wemmer, D.E.\n\n1991-04-09\n\nThe {sup 1}H resonance assignments and secondary structure of the trypsin/chymotrypsin Bowman-Birk inhibitor from soybeans were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) at 600 MHz in an 18% acetonitrile-d{sub 3}/aqueous cosolvent. Resonances from 69 to 71 amino acids were assigned sequence specifically. Residues Q11-T15 form an antiparallel {beta}-sheet with residues Q21-S25 in the tryptic inhibitory domain and an analogous region of antiparallel sheet forms between residues S38-A42 and Q48-V52 in the chymotryptic inhibitory domain.

The purified protein was characterized as a potent inhibitor against trypsin and chymotrypsin and it was named I. umbratica trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor (IUTCI). MALDI-TOF spectra of the IUTCI, in the presence of DTT, showed six disulfide bonds content, suggesting that this inhibitor belongs to Bowman-Birk family. The circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that IUTCI is predominantly formed by unordered and beta-sheet secondary structure. It was also characterized, by fluorescence spectroscopy, as a stable protein at range of pH from 5.0 to 7.0. Moreover, this inhibitor at concentration of 75 microM presented a remarkable inhibitory activity (60%) against digestive serine proteases from boll weevil Anthonomus grandis, an important economical cotton pest.\n\nMidgut Protease Activity During Larval Development of Anastrepha obliqua (Diptera: Tephritidae) Fed With Natural and Artificial Diet\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRivera-Ciprian, JosÃ© Pedro; Aceituno-Medina, Marysol; Guillen, Karina\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract In this study, we examined the activity of two serine proteases (chymotrypsin and trypsin) and two metalloproteases (carboxypeptidases A and B) during larval development in Anastrepha obliqua fed natural (mango fruit) and artificial (formulation used in mass-rearing) diets. Proteolytic activity of chymotrypsin, trypsin, carboxypeptidase A, and carboxypeptidase B was detected in the midgut of different instars of A. obliqua and was strongly affected by the pH and diet type. The protein content of the natural and artificial diets was similar. Enzymatic activity was higher in the midgut of the larvae fed the natural diet than in larvae fed the artificial diet. The activity of the endopeptidases (chymotrypsin and trypsin) was lower than those of the exopeptidases (carboxypeptidases A and B). The pH of the midgut varied from acidic to neutral. The results indicate that in the midgut of the larvae reared on both types of diet, the level of carboxypeptidase activity was approximately 100-fold greater than the level of chymotrypsin activity and 10,000-fold greater than the level of trypsin. In conclusion, carboxypeptidase A and B are the main proteases involved in the digestion of proteins in the larvae of A. obliqua. The natural diet showed a high bioaccessibility. A clear tendency to express high activities of chymotrypsin and trypsin was observed by the third instar. Our research contributes to the planning and development of novel bioaccessibility assays to understand the nutrition processing of A. obliqua larvae under mass-rearing conditions for sterile insect technique.\n\nProtease-dependent hemagglutinin cleavage contributes to alteration in chicken hemagglutination by the H3N2 influenza A virus.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamaoka, Masaoki; Makino, Akiko; Sasahara, Kenji; Nastri, Aldise Mareta; Krisna, Luh Ade Wilan; Purhito, Edith Frederika; Poetranto, Emmanuel Djoko; Wulandari, Laksmi; Yudhawati, Resti; Setiawati, Landia; Setyoningrum, Retno Asih; Shinya, Kyoko\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe human influenza A virus (H3N2) has been the predominant influenza strain since 1992, and one property of this virus is non-agglutination of chicken erythrocytes [Ch(-) virus]. The Ch(-) virus in our study was able to acquire chicken hemagglutination [Ch(+)] by trypsin passage but not by chymotrypsin passage. Moreover, the trypsin-passaged Ch(+) viruses reacquired the Ch(-) property after a further chymotrypsin passage. In particular, genetic analysis showed no evidence of mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene during either trypsin or chymotrypsin passages: the only differences found were in the HA cleavage sites between the trypsin-passaged virus and the chymotrypsin-passaged virus as determined by the N-terminal amino acid sequence. These results suggested that protease-dependent differences at the viral HA cleavage site, rather than genetic mutations, are likely to have a significant effect on the viral ability to produce chicken hemagglutination.\n\nIsolation, expression and characterization of a novel dual serine protease inhibitor, OH-TCI, from king cobra venom.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Ying-Ying; Liu, Shu-Bai; Lee, Wen-Hui; Qian, Jin-Qiao; Zhang, Yun\n\n2008-10-01\n\nSnake venom Kunitz/BPTI members are good tools for understanding of structure-functional relationship between serine proteases and their inhibitors. A novel dual Kunitz/BPTI serine proteinase inhibitor named OH-TCI (trypsin- and chymotrypsin-dual inhibitor from Ophiophagus hannah) was isolated from king cobra venom by three chromatographic steps of gel filtration, trypsin affinity and reverse phase HPLC. OH-TCI is composed of 58 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 6339Da. Successful expression of OH-TCI was performed as the maltose-binding fusion protein in E. coli DH5alpha. Much different from Oh11-1, the purified native and recombinant OH-TCI both had strong inhibitory activities against trypsin and chymotrypsin although the sequence identity (74.1%) between them is very high. The inhibitor constants (K(i)) of recombinant OH-TCI were 3.91 x 10(-7) and 8.46 x10(-8)M for trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. To our knowledge, it was the first report of Kunitz/BPTI serine proteinase inhibitor from snake venom that had equivalent trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities.\n\nLoss of second and sixth conserved cysteine residues from trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine-rich domain-type protease inhibitors in Bombyx mori may induce activity against microbial proteases.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Youshan; Liu, Huawei; Zhu, Rui; Xia, Qingyou; Zhao, Ping\n\n2016-12-01\n\nPrevious studies have indicated that most trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine-rich domain (TIL)-type protease inhibitors, which contain a single TIL domain with ten conserved cysteines, inhibit cathepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase. Our recent findings suggest that Cys 2nd and Cys 6th were lost from the TIL domain of the fungal-resistance factors in Bombyx mori, BmSPI38 and BmSPI39, which inhibit microbial proteases and the germination of Beauveria bassiana conidia. To reveal the significance of these two missing cysteines in relation to the structure and function of TIL-type protease inhibitors in B. mori, cysteines were introduced at these two positions (D36 and L56 in BmSPI38, D38 and L58 in BmSPI39) by site-directed mutagenesis. The homology structure model of TIL domain of the wild-type and mutated form of BmSPI39 showed that two cysteine mutations may cause incorrect disulfide bond formation of B. mori TIL-type protease inhibitors. The results of Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicated that both the wild-type and mutated form of BmSPI39 harbored predominantly random coil structures, and had slightly different secondary structure compositions. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis showed that cysteine mutations affected the multimerization states and electrophoretic mobility of BmSPI38 and BmSPI39. Activity staining and protease inhibition assays showed that the introduction of cysteine mutations dramaticly reduced the activity of inhibitors against microbial proteases, such as subtilisin A from Bacillus licheniformis, protease K from Engyodontium album, protease from Aspergillus melleus. We also systematically analyzed the key residue sites, which may greatly influence the specificity and potency of TIL-type protease inhibitors. We found that the two missing cysteines in B. mori TIL-type protease inhibitors might be crucial for their inhibitory activities against microbial proteases. The genetic engineering of TIL-type protease inhibitors may be\n\nFunctional analysis of the interactions between reovirus particles and various proteases in vitro\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSargent, M.D.; Long, D.G.; Borsa, J.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe digestion of purified reovirus particles by various proteases including chymotrypsin, trypsin, pronase, papain, bromelain, proteinase K, and fibrinolysin has been examined as it relates to virion transcriptase activation and alteration of infectivity. In every case uncoating to the level of active transcriptase proceeds via two mechanistically distinct steps. All the proteases tested serve to mediate only the first of the two steps, converting intact virions to intermediate subviral particles (ISVP) in which the transcriptase is retained in a latent state. The second step of the uncoating process is mediated by a K/sup +/ ion-triggered, endogenous mechanism and results inmoreÂ Â» conversion of ISVP to cores, concomitant with transcriptase activation and loss of infectivity. All of the tested enzymes, except trypsin, reversibly block the second step of uncoating. These results indicate the generality, with respect to protease employed, of the two-step process for reovirus uncoating and transcriptase activation demonstrated previously with chymotrypsin.Â«Â less\n\nInga laurina trypsin inhibitor (ILTI) obstructs Spodoptera frugiperda trypsins expressed during adaptive mechanisms against plant protease inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nMachado, Suzy Wider; de Oliveira, Caio Fernando Ramalho; ZÃ©rio, Neide Graciano; Parra, JosÃ© Roberto Postali; Macedo, Maria LÃ­gia Rodrigues\n\n2017-08-01\n\nPlant protease inhibitors (PIs) are elements of a common plant defense mechanism induced in response to herbivores. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, a highly polyphagous lepidopteran pest, responds to various PIs in its diet by expressing genes encoding trypsins. This raises the question of whether the PI-induced trypsins are also inhibited by other PIs, which we posed as the hypothesis that Inga laurina trypsin inhibitor (ILTI) inhibits PI-induced trypsins in S. frugiperda. In the process of testing our hypothesis, we compared its properties with those of selected PIs, soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (SKTI), Inga vera trypsin inhibitor (IVTI), Adenanthera pavonina trypsin inhibitor (ApTI), and Entada acaciifolia trypsin inhibitor (EATI). We report that ILTI is more effective in inhibiting the induced S. frugiperda trypsins than SKTI and the other PIs, which supports our hypothesis. ILTI may be more appropriate than SKTI for studies regarding adaptive mechanisms to dietary PIs.

The rationale behind the investigation is that salmon industry workers are exposed to aerosols containing enzymes, which are generated during industrial processing of the fish. Knowing that serine proteases such as trypsin are highly active mediators with diverse biological activities, the stimulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) and interleukin (IL)-8 and the role of protease-activated receptors (PAR) in inflammatory signal mediation were investigated. Protease-activated receptors are considered important under pathological situations in the human airways, and a thorough understanding of PAR-inducedmoreÂ Â» cellular events and their consequences in airway inflammation is necessary. Human airway epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to trypsin isolated from fish (Salmo salar), and we observed that purified salmon trypsin could generate secretion of IL-8 in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PAR-2 activation by salmon trypsin is coupled to an induction of NF-{kappa}B-mediated transcription using a PAR-2 transfected HeLa cell model. Finally, we show that the release of IL-8 from A549 following stimulation with purified salmon trypsin is mediated through activation of PAR-2 using specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The results presented suggest that salmon trypsin, via activation of PAR-2, might influence inflammation processes in the airways if inhaled in sufficient amounts.Â«Â less\n\nProteases induce secretion of collagenase and plasminogen activator by fibroblasts\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWerb, Z.; Aggeler, J.\n\n1978-04-01\n\nWe have observed that treatment of rabbit synovial fibroblasts with proteolytic enzymes can induce secretion of collagenase (EC 3.4.24.7) and plasminogen activator (EC 3.4.21.-). Cells treated for 2 to 24 hr with plasmin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatic elastase, papain, bromelain, thermolysin, or ..cap alpha..-protease but not with thrombin or neuraminidase secreted detectable amounts of collagenase within 16 to 48 hr. Treatment of fibroblasts with trypsin also induced secretion of plasminogen activator. Proteases initiated secretion of collagenase (up to 20 units per 10/sup 6/ cells per 24 hr) only when treatment produced decreased cell adhesion. Collagenase production did not depend on continuedmoreÂ Â» presence of proteolytic activity or on subsequent cell adhesion, spreading, or proliferation. Routine subculturing with crude trypsin also induced collagenase secretion by cells. Secretion of collagenase was prevented and normal spreading was obtained if the trypsinized cells were placed into medium containing fetal calf serum. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, ..cap alpha../sub 1/-antitrypsin, bovine serum albumin, collagen, and fibronectin did not inhibit collagenase production. Although proteases that induced collagenase secretion also removed surface glycoprotein, the kinetics of induction of cell protease secretion were different from those for removal of fibronectin. Physiological inducers of secretion of collagenase and plasminogen activator by cells have not been identified. These results suggest that extracellular proteases in conjunction with plasma proteins may govern protease secretion by cells.Â«Â less\n\nProtease inhibitors in various flours and breads: Effect of fermentation, baking and in vitro digestion on trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities.\n\nPubMed\n\nKostekli, Mine; Karakaya, Sibel\n\n2017-06-01\n\nIn this study trypsin (TIA) and chymotrypsin inhibitory (CIA) activities were determined in the extracts of wheat, rye mix, mixed cereals and, whole wheat flours and, breads made with these flours. In addition, effects of fermentation, baking and in vitro digestion on TIA and CIA were studied. Whole wheat flour, dough, and bread did not show any TIA. Other flours displayed TIA. Contrary to, all flours, doughs, and breads exhibited CIA. Although TIA was not detected in the protein extracts obtained from wheat and rye mix breads, protein extract of rye mix flour exhibited TIA. Following in vitro digestion process, TIA of wheat bread was found as 5.91units/mL gastric dialysate and 9.17units/mL intestine dialysate. CIA was determined in dialysates obtained from wheat (2.12CI/mL and 3.78CI/mL for gastric and intestinal dialysate respectively) and rye breads (4.16CI/mL and 2.46CI/mL for gastric and intestinal dialysate respectively).

In the present study we investigated potential interspecific differences between two major herbivores, Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex, in terms of their tolerance to cyanobacteria with protease inhibitors. Seven clones each of D. magna and of D. pulex were isolated from different habitats in Europe and North America. To test for interspecific differences in the daphnids' tolerance to cyanobacteria, their somatic and population growth rates were determined for each D. magna and D. pulex clone after exposure to varying concentrations of two Microcystis aeruginosa strains. The M. aeruginosa strains NIVA and PCC(-) contained either chymotrypsin or trypsin inhibitors, but no microcystins. Mean somatic and population growth rates on a diet with 20% NIVA were significantly more reduced in D. pulex than in D. magna. On a diet with 10% PCC(-), the population growth of D. pulex was significantly more reduced than that of D. magna. This indicates that D. magna is more tolerant to cyanobacteria with protease inhibitors than D. pulex. The reduction of growth rates was possibly caused by an interference of cyanobacterial inhibitors with proteases in the gut of Daphnia, as many other conceivable factors, which might have been able to explain the reduced growth, could be excluded as causal factors. Protease assays revealed that the sensitivities of chymotrypsins and trypsins to cyanobacterial protease inhibitors did not differ between D. magna and D. pulex. However, D. magna exhibited a 2.3-fold higher specific chymotrypsin activity than D. pulex, which explains the observed higher tolerance to cyanobacterial protease inhibitors of D. magna. The present study suggests that D. magna may control the development of cyanobacterial blooms more efficiently than D. pulex due to differences in their tolerance to cyanobacteria with protease inhibitors.\n\nTrypsin-protease activated receptor-2 signaling contributes to pancreatic cancer pain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhu, Jiao; Miao, Xue-Rong; Tao, Kun-Ming; Zhu, Hai; Liu, Zhi-Yun; Yu, Da-Wei; Chen, Qian-Bo; Qiu, Hai-Bo; Lu, Zhi-Jie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPain treatment is a critical aspect of pancreatic cancer patient clinical care. This study investigated the role of trypsin-protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) in pancreatic cancer pain. Pancreatic tissue samples were collected from pancreatic cancer (n=22) and control patients (n=22). Immunofluorescence analyses confirmed colocalization of PAR-2 and neuronal markers in pancreatic cancer tissues. Trypsin levels and protease activities were higher in pancreatic cancer tissue specimens than in the controls. Supernatants from cultured human pancreatic cancer tissues (PC supernatants) induced substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide release in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, and FS-NH2, a selective PAR-2 antagonist, inhibited this effect. A BALB/c nude mouse orthotopic tumor model was used to confirm the role of PAR-2 signaling in pancreatic cancer visceral pain, and male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to assess ambulatory pain. FS-NH2 treatment decreased hunch scores, mechanical hyperalgesia, and visceromotor reflex responses in tumor-bearing mice. In rats, subcutaneous injection of PC supernatant induced pain behavior, which was alleviated by treatment with FS-NH2 or FUT-175, a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor. Our findings suggest that trypsin-PAR-2 signaling contributes to pancreatic cancer pain in vivo. Treatment strategies targeting PAR-2 or its downstream signaling molecules might effectively relieve pancreatic cancer pain.

The medically important vector, tsetse fly (Diptera:Glossinidiae), is involved in the transmission of African trypanosomes, which cause devastating diseases in animals and humans. Both the male and female tsetse can transmit trypanosomes and both are strict bloodfeeders throughout all stages of their development. Here, we describe the characterization of two putative serine protease-encoding genes, Glossina serine protease-1 (Gsp1) and Glossina serine protease-2 (Gsp2) from gut tissue. Both putative cDNA products represent prepro peptides with hydrophobic signal peptide sequences associated with their 5'-end terminus. The Gsp1 cDNA encodes a putative mature protein of 245 amino acids with a molecular mass of 26 428 Da, while the predicted size of the 228 amino acid mature peptide encoded by Gsp2 cDNA is 24 573 Da. Both deduced peptides contain the Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad and the conserved residues surrounding it which are characteristic of serine proteases. In addition, both proteins have the six-conserved cysteine residues to form the three-cysteine bonds typically present in invertebrate serine proteases. Based on the presence of substrate specific residues, the Gsp1 gene encodes a chymotrypsin-like protease while Gsp2 gene encodes for a protein with trypsin-like activity. Both proteins are encoded by few loci in tsetse genome, being present in one or two copies only. The mRNA expression levels for the genes do not vary extensively throughout the digestive cycle, and high levels of mRNAs can be readily detected in the gut tissue of newly emerged flies. The levels of trypsin and chymotrypsin activities in the gut lumen increase following blood feeding and change significantly in the gut cells throughout the digestion cycle. Hence, the regulation of expression for\n\nRole of Proteases in Extra-Oral Digestion of a Predatory Bug, Andrallus spinidens\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZibaee, Arash; Hoda, Hassan; Mahmoud, Fazeli-Dinan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRoles of salivary proteases in the extra-oral digestion of the predatory bug, Andrallus spinidens Fabricius (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) were studied by using 2% azocasein as a general substrate and specific protease substrates, as well as synthetic and endogenous inhibitors. It was found that salivary glands of A. spinidens have two anterior, two lateral, and two posterior lobes. Azocasein was used to measure the activity of general proteases in the salivary glands using different buffer solutions. The enzyme had the highest activity at pH 8. General protease activity was highest at 40 Â°C and was stable for 6â16 hours. The use of specific substrates showed that trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, aminopeptidase, and carboxypeptidase are the active proteases present in salivary glands, by the maximum activity of trypsin-like protease in addition to their optimal pH between 8â9. Ca2+ and Mg2+ increased proteolytic activity about 216%, while other ions decreased it. Specific inhibitors including SBTI, PMSF, TLCK, and TPCK significantly decreased enzyme activity, as well as the specific inhibitors of methalloproteases including phenanthroline, EGTA, and TTHA. Extracted endogenous trypsin inhibitors extracted from potential prey, Chilo suppressalis, Naranga aenescens, Pieris brassicae, Hyphantria cunea, and Ephestia kuhniella, had different effects on trypsin-like protease activity of A. spinidens salivary glands. With the exception of C. suppressalis, the endogenous inhibitors significantly decreased enzyme activity in A. spinidens.

Quercetin (Que), a flavonoid compound with antitumor ability, displays the inhibitory effect on proteasome activity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are ill defined. The present study found that Que treatment significantly reduced the chymotrypsin-like protease activity of proteasome whereas the trypsin- and caspase-like protease activities remained unchanged in HepG2 cancer cells, along with activation of p38 MAPK and JNK and reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Que-reduced proteasome activity could not be reverted by inhibition of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathway. In addition, MEK1 overexpression or knockdown upregulated or downregulated the chymotrypsin-like protease activity of proteasome, respectively. Both Que and MEK1/ERK1/2 inhibitor attenuated the expression levels of proteasome Î² subunits. These results indicate that Que-induced suppression of MEK1/ERK1/2 signaling and subsequent reduction of proteasome Î² subunits is responsible for its inhibitory impacts on proteasome activity.\n\nThe pharmacology of chymotrypsin administered by inhalation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGolberg, L.; Martin, L. E.; Sheard, P.; Harrison, C.\n\n1960-01-01\n\nThe ability of chymotrypsin to reach the limits of the bronchial tree has been studied in cats receiving the enzyme by inhalation as a very fine powder. For this purpose derivatives of chymotrypsin were used which had been labelled with a fluorescent molecule or with [131I]. Quantitative measurements of the absorption and distribution of inhaled chymotrypsin- [131I] revealed a rapid removal of radioactivity from the lungs over the first 24 hr. and corresponding excretion of labelled inorganic iodide in the urine. High levels of activity were not attained in the blood or thyroid. Subcutaneous administration of labelled enzyme led to more rapid accumulation of radioactivity in the blood and thyroid. Consideration of these and other results leads to the conclusion that, while some enzyme ascends the respiratory tract by ciliary movement of mucus, a substantial part is absorbed into the lungs and the [131I] subsequently detached from it. The changes in tidal air accompanying inhalation of labelled trypsin and chymotrypsin were followed in anaesthetized cats. Trypsin brings about a decrease in tidal air in distinctly lower doses than does chymotrypsin. Prior administration of mepyramine had an antagonistic effect, and it is suggested that the change in tidal air is essentially the result of bronchial spasm.

Using commonly accepted analytical strategies, a protocol was developed enabling the determination of elevated protease activities in doping control specimens followed by the visualization of protein degradation and identification of proteases such as chymotrypsin, trypsin and papain. Therefore, protease detection kits based on fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled casein were employed, and protease concentrations greater than 15 microg/mL of urine entailed subsequent 1-dimensional gel electrophoretic visualization of urinary proteins. The presence of 20 microg of proteases per mL of urine caused a complete degradation of proteins usually observed in urinary matrices (\"trace of burning\"), while respective proteases were still detected in spiked urine samples after 10 days of storage at + 4 and - 20 degrees C. Identification of target proteases at respective molecular weights was accomplished using bottom-up sequencing approaches based on in-gel digestion of separated enzymes followed by capillary liquid chromatography--Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nProperties of chymotrypsin bound covalently to dextran.\n\nPubMed\n\nZlateva, T P; Krysteva, M; Balajthy, Z; ElÃ¶di, P\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe kinetic properties dextran-chymotrypsin conjugate were studied by means of low molecular weight substrates. It was found that KM, kcat and kcat/KM of dextran chymotrypsin for the hydrolysis of benzoyl-L-tyrosine-ethyl-ester did not differ substantially from those of the free enzyme. However, the data found for kcat of dextran-chymotrypsin and free chymotrypsin assayed for the hydrolysis of three tripeptidyl-p-nitroanilide D-Arg-Val-Trp-pNA, D-Arg-Val-Tyr-pNA, Z-Phe-Pro-Phe-pNA, were definitely different. The inhibition of the modified chymotrypsin with soybean trypsin inhibitor was found to be less pronounced than that with the free enzyme. The effect of potassium and magnesium salts on the inactivation of both enzymes was also studied. The effect of dextran matrix on the catalytic properties and the conformational stability of modified chymotrypsin is discussed.\n\nDetailed two-dimensional gel proteomic mapping of the feces of the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and comparison with D. farinae: Reduced trypsin protease content in D. pteronyssinus and different isoforms.\n\nPubMed\n\nErban, Tomas; Harant, Karel; Hubert, Jan\n\n2017-06-06\n\nMajor domestic mite allergens are present in feces. We present a detailed 2D-E-MS/MS proteomic analysis of the Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus feces. Precise cultivation yielded a pure fecal extract. We detected differences in fecal allergens/digestive enzymes between D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae using 2D-E fingerprinting, including unique information on species-specific protease isoforms. Proteomic analysis was performed by 2D-E coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF identification. The species-specific differences in the fecal extracts of the mites were attributed to trypsin-like proteases known as group 3 allergens. In D. farinae, Der f 3 exhibited high abundance with a pI similar (acidic) to that of the cysteine protease Der f 1 and the chymotrypsin protease Der f 6, whereas in D. pteronyssinus, Der p 3 was rarely detected and exhibited low abundance only at basic pI. Moreover, Der p 9 was detected at a pI of ~ 10, in contrast to Der p 1 and Der p 6, suggesting different compartmentalization in the body. Overall, in D. pteronyssinus feces, allergens of groups 1, 2, 6, and 15 were quantitatively similar to those of D. farinae with the exception of the group 3 and 9 allergens. This work provides novel insights into mite-defecated proteins/digestive enzymes, which are important allergens. Millions of people are affected by allergy and asthma, and their number is growing. In homes, the major triggers of allergy and asthma are the house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus, and a clear understanding of the development of diseases caused by these mites is needed. The major sources of mite allergens are their feces, which are deposited in the environment and are easily inhaled as part of aeroplankton. However, descriptions of and comparisons between the major fecal allergens of these two mites are lacking. This study shows that similar group 1 (cysteine protease), 2 (NPC2 family), 6 (chymotrypsin) and 15 (chitinase-like) allergens are present in the feces of\n\nOviductal protease and trypsin treatment enhance sperm-envelope interaction in Bufo arenarum coelomic eggs.\n\nPubMed\n\nLlanos, Ricardo J; Barrera, Daniel; Valz-Gianinet, Jorge N; Miceli, Dora C\n\n2006-10-01\n\nWe describe the morphological and biochemical changes in Bufo arenarum coelomic egg envelopes (CE) following passage through the oviduct. In this species, the transformation of the CE into the vitelline envelope (VE) leads to the acquisition of fertilizability and involves the cleavage of a glycoprotein component. Electrophoretic patterns indicate that a pars recta oviductal protease selectively hydrolyzes in vitro the 84 and the 55 kDa glycoproteins of the CE. During the CE to VE transformation, the relative concentrations of gp48, 42 and 39 kDa also change. In in vitro tests, sperm binding to envelope glycoprotein occurs when they are exposed to VE but not when treated with CE, and VE labeled glycoproteins bind to the head and mid piece of the sperm. The gp39 VE component has 100% identity with internal domains of the sequence deduced from ovarian cDNA for the homologous zona pellucida glycoprotein type C (ZPC) protein precursor in B. arenarum. The effects of trypsin as a substitute for oviductal protease were also examined. Trypsin selectively attacks the 84 and the 55 kDa glycoproteins without hydrolyzing other components and renders coelomic eggs fertilizable in a jelly water preparation. Therefore, trypsin can mimic in vitro the biological action of the oviductal protease. However, it does not wholly mimic the biological action of the oviduct which, in B. arenarum at least, exceeds a mere proteolytic effect. This fact was verified by the lower fertility rates and the abnormal embryo development found when trypsin-treated coelomic eggs were fertilized in vitro. 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n\nInhibition of proteases activity in intestine needs a sustainable acidic environment rather than a transient.\n\nPubMed\n\nXing, Chang; Xing, Jin-Feng; Ge, Zhi-Qiang\n\n2017-10-01\n\nÎ±-Chymotrypsin (Î±-CT) and trypsin are important components of the enzymatic barrier. They could degrade the therapeutic proteins and peptides, inhibit their activity consequently, and thereby reduce their oral bioavailability. Acidic agents, as one type of indirect protease inhibitors, have shown proof of concept in clinical trials. We report here the inactivated proteases due to acid influence can be reactivated immediately by environmental pH recovery regardless of how long the inactivation last. To keep the inactivation time of proteases for 4-5âh, we designed and prepared a sustained-release tablet containing citric acid (CA) which can effectively reduce the pH below 5.0 and maintain it for 5âh in the dissolution-reaction medium. The activity of Î±-CT and trypsin was quantified by analyzing the residual amount of their respective substrates BTEE and TAME. More than 80% of the substrates were survived in 5.0âh of incubation, whereas the common tablet inhibited the proteases activity for only two hours in the same experimental medium. It indicates that the sustained-release tablet loaded with CA can efficiently inhibit the Î±-CT and trypsin activity longer than the common tablet. The results will be beneficial for designing and formulating the peroral administration of peptide and protein drugs.\n\nDual origin of gut proteases in Formosan subterranean termites (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nSethi, Amit; Xue, Qing-Gang; La Peyre, Jerome F; Delatte, Jennifer; Husseneder, Claudia\n\n2011-07-01\n\nCellulose digestion in lower termites, mediated by carbohydrases originating from both termite and endosymbionts, is well characterized. In contrast, limited information exists on gut proteases of lower termites, their origins and roles in termite nutrition. The objective of this study was to characterize gut proteases of the Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae). The protease activity of extracts from gut tissues (fore-, mid- and hindgut) and protozoa isolated from hindguts of termite workers was quantified using hide powder azure as a substrate and further characterized by zymography with gelatin SDS-PAGE. Midgut extracts showed the highest protease activity followed by the protozoa extracts. High level of protease activity was also detected in protozoa culture supernatants after 24 h incubation. Incubation of gut and protozoa extracts with class-specific protease inhibitors revealed that most of the proteases were serine proteases. All proteolytic bands identified after gelatin SDS-PAGE were also inhibited by serine protease inhibitors. Finally, incubation with chromogenic substrates indicated that extracts from fore- and hindgut tissues possessed proteases with almost exclusively trypsin-like activity while both midgut and protozoa extracts possessed proteases with trypsin-like and subtilisin/chymotrypsin-like activities. However, protozoa proteases were distinct from midgut proteases (with different molecular mass). Our results suggest that the Formosan subterranean termite not only produces endogenous proteases in its gut tissues, but also possesses proteases originating from its protozoan symbionts.

In addition to bacterial subtilisins and mammalian chymotrypsins, WSCI inhibits chymotrypsin-like activities isolated from digestive traits of a number of insect larvae. In vivo, as suggested for many plant proteinase inhibitors, WSCI seems to play a role of natural defence against attacks of pests and pathogens. The functional region of WSCI, containing the inhibitor reactive site (Met48-Glu49), corresponds to an extended flexible loop (Val42-Asp53) whose architecture is somehow stabilized by a number of secondary interactions established with a small Î²-sheet located underneath. The aim of this study was to employ a WSCI molecule as a stable scaffold to obtain recombinant inhibitors with new acquired anti-proteinase activity or, alternatively, inactive WSCI variants. A gene sequence coding for the native WSCI, along with genes coding for muteins with different specficities, could be exploited to obtain transformed non-food use plants with improved insect resistance. On the other hand, the genetic transformation of cereal plants over-expressing inactive WSCI muteins could represent a possible strategy to improve the nutritional quality of cereal-based foods, without risk of interference with human or animal digestive enzymes. Here, we described the characterization of four muteins containing single/multiple amino acid substitutions at the WSCI reactive site and/or at its proximity. Modalities of interaction of these muteins with proteinases (subtilisin, trypsin and chymotrypsin) were investigated by time course hydrolysis and molecular simulations studies.\n\nEthanol enhances carbachol-induced protease activation and accelerates Ca2+ waves in isolated rat pancreatic acini.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrabi, Abrahim I; Shah, Ahsan U; Muili, Kamaldeen; Luo, Yuhuan; Mahmood, Syeda Maham; Ahmad, Asim; Reed, Anamika; Husain, Sohail Z\n\n2011-04-22\n\nAlcohol abuse is a leading cause of pancreatitis, accounting for 30% of acute cases and 70-90% of chronic cases, yet the mechanisms leading to alcohol-associated pancreatic injury are unclear. An early and critical feature of pancreatitis is the aberrant signaling of Ca(2+) within the pancreatic acinar cell. An important conductor of this Ca(2+) is the basolaterally localized, intracellular Ca(2+) channel ryanodine receptor (RYR). In this study, we examined the effect of ethanol on mediating both pathologic intra-acinar protease activation, a precursor to pancreatitis, as well as RYR Ca(2+) signals. We hypothesized that ethanol sensitizes the acinar cell to protease activation by modulating RYR Ca(2+). Acinar cells were freshly isolated from rat, pretreated with ethanol, and stimulated with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (1 Î¼M). Ethanol caused a doubling in the carbachol-induced activation of the proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin (p < 0.02). The RYR inhibitor dantrolene abrogated the enhancement of trypsin and chymotrypsin activity by ethanol (p < 0.005 for both proteases). Further, ethanol accelerated the speed of the apical to basolateral Ca(2+) wave from 9 to 18 Î¼m/s (p < 0.0005; n = 18-22 cells/group); an increase in Ca(2+) wave speed was also observed with a change from physiologic concentrations of carbachol (1 Î¼M) to a supraphysiologic concentration (1 mM) that leads to protease activation. Dantrolene abrogated the ethanol-induced acceleration of wave speed (p < 0.05; n = 10-16 cells/group). Our results suggest that the enhancement of pathologic protease activation by ethanol is dependent on the RYR and that a novel mechanism for this enhancement may involve RYR-mediated acceleration of Ca(2+) waves.\n\nEthanol Enhances Carbachol-induced Protease Activation and Accelerates Ca2+ Waves in Isolated Rat Pancreatic Acini*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOrabi, Abrahim I.; Shah, Ahsan U.; Muili, Kamaldeen; Luo, Yuhuan; Mahmood, Syeda Maham; Ahmad, Asim; Reed, Anamika; Husain, Sohail Z.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAlcohol abuse is a leading cause of pancreatitis, accounting for 30% of acute cases and 70â90% of chronic cases, yet the mechanisms leading to alcohol-associated pancreatic injury are unclear. An early and critical feature of pancreatitis is the aberrant signaling of Ca2+ within the pancreatic acinar cell. An important conductor of this Ca2+ is the basolaterally localized, intracellular Ca2+ channel ryanodine receptor (RYR). In this study, we examined the effect of ethanol on mediating both pathologic intra-acinar protease activation, a precursor to pancreatitis, as well as RYR Ca2+ signals. We hypothesized that ethanol sensitizes the acinar cell to protease activation by modulating RYR Ca2+.

Our results suggest that the enhancement of pathologic protease activation by ethanol is dependent on the RYR and that a novel mechanism for this enhancement may involve RYR-mediated acceleration of Ca2+ waves.

In particular, it exhibits a highly specific inhibitory profile as a very strong inhibitor of trypsin with K(i) in the picomolar range. Determination of the crystal structure revealed that the protein has a Î²-trefoil fold. Site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry results have confirmed Arg-27 as the reactive binding site for trypsin inhibition. The loop containing Arg-27 is positioned between the Î²2 and Î²3 strands, distinguishing cospin from other Î²-trefoil-fold serine protease inhibitors in which Î²4-Î²5 or Î²5-Î²6 loops are involved in protease inhibition. Biotoxicity assays of cospin on various model organisms revealed a strong and specific entomotoxic activity against Drosophila melanogaster. The inhibitory inactive R27N mutant was not entomotoxic, associating toxicity with inhibitory activity. Along with the abundance of cospin in fruiting bodies of C. cinerea and the lack of trypsin-like proteases in the C. cinerea genome, these results suggest that cospin and its homologs are effectors of a fungal defense mechanism against fungivorous insects that function by specific inhibition of serine proteases in the insect gut.\n\nAnti-fibrinolytic and anti-microbial activities of a serine protease inhibitor from honeybee (Apis cerana) venom.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Jie; Lee, Kwang Sik; Kim, Bo Yeon; Choi, Yong Soo; Yoon, Hyung Joo; Jia, Jingming; Jin, Byung Rae\n\n2017-10-01\n\nBee venom contains a variety of peptide constituents, including low-molecular-weight protease inhibitors. While the putative low-molecular-weight serine protease inhibitor Api m 6 containing a trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine-rich domain was identified from honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom, no anti-fibrinolytic or anti-microbial roles for this inhibitor have been elucidated. In this study, we identified an Asiatic honeybee (A. cerana) venom serine protease inhibitor (AcVSPI) that was shown to act as a microbial serine protease inhibitor and plasmin inhibitor. AcVSPI was found to consist of a trypsin inhibitor-like domain that displays ten cysteine residues. Interestingly, the AcVSPI peptide sequence exhibited high similarity to the putative low-molecular-weight serine protease inhibitor Api m 6, which suggests that AcVSPI is an allergen Api m 6-like peptide. Recombinant AcVSPI was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells, and it demonstrated inhibitory activity against trypsin, but not chymotrypsin. Additionally, AcVSPI has inhibitory effects against plasmin and microbial serine proteases; however, it does not have any detectable inhibitory effects on thrombin or elastase. Consistent with these inhibitory effects, AcVSPI inhibited the plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin to fibrin degradation products. AcVSPI also bound to bacterial and fungal surfaces and exhibited anti-microbial activity against fungi as well as gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These findings demonstrate the anti-fibrinolytic and anti-microbial roles of AcVSPI as a serine protease inhibitor. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Roxb. seed extract.\n\nPubMed\n\nTripathi, Vinayak R; Kumar, Shailendra; Garg, Satyendra K\n\n2011-07-12\n\nProteases play an important role in virulence of many human, plant and insect pathogens. The proteinaceous protease inhibitors of plant origin have been reported widely from many plant species. The inhibitors may potentially be used for multiple therapeutic applications in viral, bacterial, fungal diseases and physiological disorders. In traditional Indian medicine system, Cassia tora (Senna tora) is reportedly effective in treatment of skin and gastrointestinal disorders. The present study explores the protease inhibitory activity of the above plant seeds against trypsin, Aspergillus flavus and Bacillus sp. proteases. The crushed seeds of Cassia tora were washed thoroughly with acetone and hexane for depigmentation and defatting. The proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulphate (0-30, 30-60, 60-90%) followed by dialysis and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The inhibitory potential of crude seed extract and most active dialyzed fraction against trypsin and proteases was established by spot test using unprocessed x-ray film and casein digestion methods, respectively. Electrophoretic analysis of most active fraction (30-60%) and SEC elutes were carried employing Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Gelatin SDS-PAGE. Inhibition of fungal spore germination was studied in the presence of dialyzed active inhibitor fraction. Standard deviation (SD) and ANOVA were employed as statistical tools. The crude seeds' extract displayed strong antitryptic, bacterial and fungal protease inhibitory activity on x-ray film. The seed protein fraction 30-60% was found most active for trypsin inhibition in caseinolytic assay (P < 0.001). The inhibition of caseinolytic activity of the proteases increased with increasing ratio of seed extract. The residual activity of trypsin, Aspergillus flavus and Bacillus sp. proteases remained only 4, 7 and 3.1%, respectively when proteases were incubated with 3 mg ml-1 seed protein extract for 60 min. The\n\nProtease Inhibitors from Marine Venomous Animals and Their Counterparts in Terrestrial Venomous Animals\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMourÃ£o, Caroline B.F.; Schwartz, Elisabeth F.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Kunitz-type protease inhibitors are the best-characterized family of serine protease inhibitors, probably due to their abundance in several organisms. These inhibitors consist of a chain of ~60 amino acid residues stabilized by three disulfide bridges, and was first observed in the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)-like protease inhibitors, which strongly inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin. In this review we present the protease inhibitors (PIs) described to date from marine venomous animals, such as from sea anemone extracts and Conus venom, as well as their counterparts in terrestrial venomous animals, such as snakes, scorpions, spiders, Anurans, and Hymenopterans. More emphasis was given to the Kunitz-type inhibitors, once they are found in all these organisms. Their biological sources, specificity against different proteases, and other molecular blanks (being also K+ channel blockers) are presented, followed by their molecular diversity. Whereas sea anemone, snakes and other venomous animals present mainly Kunitz-type inhibitors, PIs from Anurans present the major variety in structure length and number of Cys residues, with at least six distinguishable classes. A representative alignment of PIs from these venomous animals shows that, despite eventual differences in Cys assignment, the key-residues for the protease inhibitory activity in all of them occupy similar positions in primary sequence. The key-residues for the K+ channel blocking activity was also compared.

Larvae of P. brassicae also feed prolifically on garden nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L., of the family Tropaeolaceae). Proteolytic digestion was studied in larvae feeding on multiple hosts. Fourth instars were collected from cauliflower fields before transfer onto detached, aerial tissues of selected host plants in the lab. Variable levels of midgut proteases were detected in larvae fed on different hosts using protein substrates (casein and recombinant RBCL cloned from cauliflower) and diagnostic, synthetic substrates. Qualitative changes in midgut trypsin activities and quantitative changes in midgut chymotrypsin activities were implicated in physiological adaptation of larvae transferred to T. majus. Midgut proteolytic activities were inhibited to different extents by serine protease inhibitors, including putative trypsin inhibitors isolated from herbivore-attacked and herbivore-free leaves of cauliflower (CfTI) and T. majus (TpTI). Transfer of larvae to T. majus significantly influenced feeding parameters but not necessarily when transferred to different tissues of the same host. Results obtained are relevant for devising sustainable pest management strategies, including transgenic approaches using genes encoding plant protease inhibitors.

In the present study, trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activity was detected in the seed flour extracts of 13 selected cultivars/accessions of cowpea. Two cowpea cultivars, Cream7 and Buff, were found to have higher trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory potential compared to other tested cultivars for which they have been selected for further purification studies using ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column. Cream7-purified proteins showed two bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) corresponding to molecular mass of 17.10 and 14.90 kDa, while the purified protein from Buff cultivar showed a single band corresponding mass of 16.50 kDa. The purified inhibitors were stable at temperature below 60Â°C and were active at wide range of pH from 2 to 12. The kinetic analysis revealed noncompetitive type of inhibition for both inhibitors against both enzymes. The inhibitor constant (Ki ) values suggested high affinity between inhibitors and enzymes. Purified inhibitors were found to have deep and negative effects on the mean larval weight, larval mortality, pupation, and mean pupal weight of Spodoptera littoralis, where Buff PI was more effective than Cream7 PI. It may be concluded that cowpea PI gene(s) could be potential insect control protein for future studies in developing insect-resistant transgenic plants.

In the present study, two male reproductive tract KPIs, termed Man-KPI and Ers-KPI, were identified in Macrobrachium nipponense and Eriocheir sinensis, respectively. The inhibitory activities of recombinant Man-KPI and Ers-KPI against chymotrypsin, elastase, trypsin and thrombin were determined. The results showed that both of them strongly inhibit chymotrypsin and elastase. Kinetic studies were performed to elucidate their inhibition mechanism. Furthermore, individual domains were also expressed to learn further which domain contributes to the inhibitory activities of intact KPIs. Only Man-KPI_domain3 is active in the inhibition of chymotrypsin and elastase. Meanwhile, Ers-KPI_domain2 and 3 are responsible for inhibition of chymotrypsin, and Ers-KPI_domains2, 3 and 4 are responsible for the inhibition of elastase. Meanwhile, the inhibitory activities of these two KPIs toward Macrobrachium rosenbergii, M.Â nipponense and E.Â sinensis sperm were compared with that of the Kazal-type peptidase inhibitor (MRPINK) characterized from the M.Â rosenbergii reproductive tract in a previous study. The results demonstrated that KPIs can completely inhibit the gelatinolytic activities of sperm proteases from their own species, while different levels of cross-inhibition were observed between KPI and proteases from different species. These results may provide new perspective to further clarify the mechanism of KPI-proteases interaction in the male reproductive system. Crown Copyright Â© 2011. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Loss-of-function mutations in CTRC increase the risk for chronic pancreatitis. Here we describe functional analysis of eight previously uncharacterized natural CTRC variants tested for potential defects in secretion, proteolytic stability, and catalytic activity. We found that all variants were secreted from transfected cells normally, and none suffered proteolytic degradation by trypsin. Five variants had normal enzymatic activity, whereas variant p.R29Q was catalytically inactive due to loss of activation by trypsin and variant p.S239C exhibited impaired activity possibly caused by disulfide mispairing. Surprisingly, variant p.G214R had increased activity on a small chromogenic peptide substrate but was markedly defective in cleaving bovine Î²-casein or the natural CTRC substrates human cationic trypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase A1. Mutation p.G214R is analogous to the evolutionary mutation in human mesotrypsin, which rendered this trypsin isoform resistant to proteinaceous inhibitors and conferred its ability to cleave these inhibitors. Similarly to the mesotrypsin phenotype, CTRC variant p.G214R was inhibited poorly by eglin C, ecotin, or a CTRC-specific variant of SGPI-2, and it readily cleaved the reactive-site peptide bonds in eglin C and ecotin. We conclude that CTRC variants p.R29Q, p.G214R, and p.S239C are risk factors for chronic pancreatitis. Furthermore, the mesotrypsin-like CTRC variant highlights how the same natural mutation in homologous pancreatic serine proteases can evolve a new physiological role or lead to pathology, determined by the biological context of protease function.

We performed site-directed mutagenesis of ShPI-1 to produce two variants (rShPI-1/K13L and rShPI/Y15S) that were expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified, and characterized. After a single purification step, 65Â mg and 15Â mg of protein per liter of culture supernatant were obtained for rShPI-1/K13L and rShPI/Y15S, respectively. Functional studies demonstrated a 100-fold decreased trypsin inhibitory activity as result of the K13L substitution at the reactive (P1) site. This protein variant has a novel tight-binding inhibitor activity of pancreatic elastase and increased activity toward neutrophil elastase in comparison to rShPI-1A. In contrast, the substitution Y15S at P2' site did not affect the Ki value against trypsin, but did reduce activity 10-fold against chymotrypsin and neutrophil elastase. Our results provide two new ShPI-1 variants with modified inhibitory activities, one of them with increased biomedical potential. This study also offers new insight into the functional impact of the P1 and P2' sites on ShPI-1 specificity. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

After imbibition, the cotyledons contained high levels of sulfhydryl aminopeptidase activity (APA) but low levels of serine carboxypeptidase activity (CPA). CPA increased with germination through the apparent loss of a CPA inhibitor substance in the seed. Curves showing changes in endopeptidase activity (EPA) assayed at pH 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 during germination were distinctly different. EPA at pH 4, 5, 6, and 7 showed characteristics of sulfhydryl enzymes while activity at pH 8 was probably due to a serine type enzyme. EPA at pH 6 was inhibited early in germination by one or more substances in the seed. Activities at pH 5 and later at pH 6 were the highest of all EPA throughout germination and increases in these activities were associated with a rapid loss of protein from the cotyledons of the developing seedling.Jojoba cotyledonary extracts were found to inhibit the enzymic activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin but not the protease from Aspergillus saotoi.

In this study, Rhamnus frangula was selected as a protease inhibitor source. The maximum recovery of the protease inhibitor against trypsin was recorded in the crude extract made in 0.1Â M phosphate buffer (pHÂ 7.0) and isolated from the mature leaves. Then, the protease inhibitor designated as RfIP1 was purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G50 with an apparent molecular mass of 22.5Â kDa and its N-terminal sequence exhibited a high degree of homology with known serine protease inhibitor sequences. The RfIP1 displayed maximal activity at pHÂ 7 and 37Â Â°C. It maintained almost 80% of its maximal activity through a large pH range. The thermo-stability of RfIP1 was markedly enhanced by BSA, CaCl 2, and sorbitol, whereas the addition of Mg 2+ , Zn 2+ , NaTDC, SDS, DTT, and Î²-ME significantly promoted inhibitory activity. The protease inhibitor displayed high inhibitory activity toward some known proteases (cathepsin B, chymotrypsin, collagenase, thrombin, and trypsin) that have more importance in pharmaceutical industry and it acted as potent inhibitor of some commercially proteases from Aspergillus oryzae, Bacillus sp, and Bacillus licheniformis. The protease inhibitor also possessed an appreciable antibacterial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nCathepsin B Activity Initiates Apoptosis via Digestive Protease Activation in Pancreatic Acinar Cells and Experimental Pancreatitis*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSendler, Matthias; Maertin, Sandrina; John, Daniel; Persike, Maria; Weiss, F.

In the course of the anti-inflammatory action, enzymes degrade damaged cells and necrotic material and, through the inactivation of mediators and toxic products, they restrict the edema and pain. The study conducted at Grant Medical College, Mumbai, India was a clinical trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of three oral enzyme treatment groups-oral tablets containing trypsin:chymotrypsin (TC) (Chymoral Forte Â® ), serratiopeptidase (S) 5Â mg oral tablets, and oral enzyme tablets containing trypsin 48Â mg, bromelain 90Â mg, and rutoside 100Â mg (TBR)-to evaluate their healing potential in surgical wounds after orthopedic surgery. A total of 75 patients were screened, randomized, and divided into three groups in 1:1:1 ratio receiving either of the three treatments. In the TC group, erythema was significantly reduced from 3.44 on dayÂ 3 to 1.16 on dayÂ 10 (pÂ <Â 0.01). There was significantly better reduction in erythema scores in the TC group as compared to S and TBR groups (pÂ <Â 0.05) at each follow-up visit. Similarly reduction in the local irritation, wound discharge, edema, induration, and tenderness score with TC treatment at the end of the study was significantly higher than that observed in the other two groups. In addition TC showed significant reduction in pain on the VAS scale (pÂ <Â 0.01). Global assessment of response to therapy for efficacy and tolerability was reported to be good to excellent in 88% and 92% of the patients on TC as compared to 12% and 8% with S and 12% and 8% with TBR. TC provides a better resolution of symptoms of inflammation after orthopedic surgery as compared to S and TBR, thus facilitating better wound healing. Further studies are warranted to confirm the findings. Clinical Trial Registry of India (Reg.

The subcellular distribution has been investigated of a protease from rabbit polymorphonuclear leucocytes, obtained from peritoneal exudates. The enzyme, optimally active between pH7.0 and 7.5, hydrolyses histone but not haemoglobin, sediments almost exclusively with a granule fraction rich in other lysosomal enzymes, and is latent until the granules are disrupted by various means. 2. Enzymic analysis of specific and azurophilic granules separated by zonal centrifugation showed that neutral protease activity was confined to fractions rich in enzymes characteristic of"
