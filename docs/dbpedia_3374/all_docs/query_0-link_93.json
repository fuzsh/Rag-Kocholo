        "text": "Sean Paul Terry (born 1 August 1991 in Southampton, Hampshire) is an English born Irish cricketer. Terry is a right-handed batsman who bowls right-arm off break for Leinster, Northamptonshire and Ireland. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut for Ireland on 14 July 2016 against Afghanistan. He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut against Hong Kong on 5 September 2016.\n\nEarly life\n\nThe son of former England and Hampshire batsman Paul Terry, he spent much of his early life in Australia, where he was educated at Aquinas College, Perth, and the University of Notre Dame in Fremantle. While living in Australia, he also represented Western Australia at under-19 level.\n\nIn November 2011, he joined Hampshire on a two-year development contract. It was in that same year that he joined the MCC Young Cricketers programme at Lord's.\n\nHampshire career\n\nTerry made his first-class debut for Hampshire in their first fixture of the 2012 season against Loughborough MCCU at the Rose Bowl on 6 April. He made his maiden first-class fifty in this match, making an unbeaten 59 in Hampshire's first-innings of 445/7 declared. He also took two catches in a match which Hampshire won by 274 runs.\n\nDue to the unavailability of Hampshire captain James Adams for Hampshire's County Championship match against Leicestershire, Terry was called up to replace the opening batsman and make his debut in the County Championship. He was dismissed for a duck in Hampshire's first-innings by Alex Wyatt.\n\nIrish career\n\nIn April 2016, Terry declared that he is moving to Dublin to pursue his ambitions playing for Ireland national cricket team and signed a contracted with YMCA Cricket Club.\n\nHe made his first-class debut for Northamptonshire versus Sussex at Arundel during June 2016.\n\nIn June 2016, he was named in Ireland's One Day International squad for their series against Afghanistan, scheduled to take place the following month. He made his ODI debut on 14 July."
