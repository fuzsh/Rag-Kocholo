        "text": "GCB, WICB discuss Guyana schools cricket\n\nGuyana Times article.\n\nGeorgetown, Guyana - Representatives of the Guyana Cricket Board (GCB) and West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) met with Sports Minister, Dr Frank Anthony, and discussed the National School Cricket League.\n\nApart from Dr Anthony, present at the discussion were WICB Senior Project Officer of School Cricket, KJ Singh, GCB Secretary, Anand Sanasie, and GCB Territorial Developmental Officer, Colin Stuart.\n\nThe League is proposed to be a joint WICB/GCB/GOG venture. Singh explained that the League came about to fill the gap existing in school cricket. According to him, a research by the WICB found that almost 75 per cent of member territories had significant gaps in their development pathway between age groups, which encourage later development of cricketing skill sets. Instead of the youth players grasping the fundamentals of the game at ages 7-13, it is now done until ages 14-17, especially as it relates to hard ball cricket exposure at the school level.\n\nOnly the Under-15 age group is sustainable and functioning annually. So right now, the most important group is the Under-7 to Under-11 age groups. The WICB/GCB is hoping to have full tournaments in these different age groups in another two years time.\n\nMinister Anthony welcomed the initiative and discussed the proposed structures with the representatives while adding some ideas of his own. The Minister was of the opinion that when all the schools are staffed with a Physical Education Specialist, all the National Sporting disciplines can benefit. He also briefed the panel on the current plans by his Government to develop Community Grounds country wide.\n\nSanasie noted that covering all schools in Guyana is a challenge because of its wide geography and many schools. Focus on cricket is primarily done on the coastland and some parts in the Essequibo but the GCB is working on bringing in Lethem and North West soon. He stated that the National School Cricket League is a priority for him, the GCB and WICB as this will create a reliable feeder system for Guyana’s Club Cricket.\n\nSanasie emphasised that a body is needed to run school cricket which the National Schools Cricket League can do. The concept of the League is to facilitate and streamline the planning, management and execution of all primary and secondary school programmes and tournaments, with the overall mandate to develop and sustain a complete school cricket development pathway from under-9 to under-19 on an annual basis.\n\nIt will manage all annual cricket programme and tournaments in the Primary and Secondary School across its territory; and develop and execute an annual schedule of community based cricket matches for Primary and Secondary school (for both boys and girls), which leads into National Schools Tournaments.\n\nThe National School Cricket League in conjunction with the GCB, Sport Ministry, and the Education Ministry would develop all playing conditions and regulation for all age group tournaments, secure sponsorship for all age group based tournaments and programme, promote migration of primary and secondary school cricketers to localised Club System, perform scouting exercises to identify talented player (both Boys and Girls) for further development at the Club and National Cricket Systems, work with the Local Territorial Cricket Board and national stakeholder to ensure that sufficient qualified human resources (school coaches, etc) and cricket gear are available to build cricket capacity at all age groups in schools, develop proposal and seek sponsorship for the implementation of annual cricket infrastructure development initiatives at primary and secondary schools/community grounds, and monitor and manage all infrastructure development programme.\n\nSanasie stated, coming out of the League should be one point person from the GCB (coach), one from the Sport Ministry, and one from the Education Ministry in each district. He added that the GCB will create an office with one person overlooking primary school, one secondary, and one the club structure.\n\nSingh posited that one of the aims is have a games master in every school. Guyana has 19 qualified cricket coaches (level 1 and 2) who are disbursed across the country. Singh further informed that by 2017, at least one person in each school would be specialised at the foundation coaching level; they can be Physical Education teachers or anyone who is interested in cricket.\n\nThe Senior Project Officer of School Cricket in the West Indies stressed that cricket is an expensive sport; hence, it’s a challenge for everyone to acquire the equipment. Dr. Anthony suggested that his Ministry and the WICB/GCB work out an arrangement to buy equipment in bulk, as such, equipment can be made available at a cheaper and realistic cost for Guyanese cricketers. Singh agreed that it is a sensible move and promised to look into it.\n\nThe Minister said the ideas and visions are exciting and interesting. He advised the WICB and GCB to make a practical structure for the programme.\n\nThe panel also met with Sport Director Neil Kumar and Desrie Ogle, Administrator Allied Arts Department of the Education Ministry and other officials to discuss matters pertaining to the rolling out of the programme and other related issues.\n\nFirst Published In The Guyana Times.\n\nCategory:\n\nPublish On Home:\n\nYes\n\nBlurb:\n\nRepresentatives of the Guyana Cricket Board (GCB) and West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) met with Sports Minister, Dr Frank Anthony, and discussed the National School Cricket League.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHardball cricket returns to Region Ten\n\nKaieteur News article.\n\nGeorgetown, Guyana - Hardball cricket is expected to return to Linden in the form a of a T20 cricket competition, beginning on September 20.

The Demerara middle order also lacks a ‘worker’, someone able to find gaps, run hard and rotate the strike.\n\nBut, it is the Demerara bowling, which may concerns the Berbicians more.\n\nIn the spin department, Demerara will continue to place their hopes in the hands of Raj Nanan, Zaheer Mohamed, Amir Khan, Yatesh Dhanpaul, Steven Jacobs and Chanderpaul Hemraj.\n\nHowever, although Berbice does not have the big names as their opponents, they have a lineup that is capable of putting together huge totals.\n\nTeams for Saturday’s final reads:\n\nDemerara: Christopher Barnwell (Captain), Paul Wintz (V/Captain), Trevon Griffith, Robin Bacchus, Andrew Lyght Jnr, Shemroy Barrington, Rajendra Chandrika, Raj Nanan, Zaheer Mohamed, Amir Khan, Yatesh Dhanpaul, Steven Jacobs, Chanderpaul Hemraj, , Seon Daniels, Garvin Nedd (Coach), Clive Grimond (Manager/Assistant Coach).\n\nBerbice: Narsingh Deonarine (Captain), Veerasammy Permaul (V/Captain), Kandasammy Surujnarine, Seon Hetmyer, Devon Clements, Jonathan Foo, Rajiv Ivan, Anthony Bramble, Jason Sinclair, Romario Shepherd, Gudakesh Motie, Krishendat Ramoo, Keon Joseph, Raun Johnson, Albert Smith, (Manager), Hubern Evans (Coach).\n\nFirst Published In The Guyana Times.\n\nCategory:\n\nPublish On Home:\n\nNo\n\nBlurb:\n\nDemerara will journey to the Ancient County on Saturday where they will clash with Berbice in the final of the Guyana Cricket Board (GCB) senior Inter-County tournament.\n\n↧\n\nNedd’s birth anniversary cricket set for SEPT. 28\n\nKaieteur News article.\n\nGeorgetown, Guyana - Former National off spinner, coach, Garvin Nedd will be hosting a number of cricket matches on September 28 at the Demerara Cricket Club in observance of his birth anniversary.\n\nThe action will get underway from 09:00 hrs with a U-15 match, this will be followed by a female, male 10/10 softball matches and a kiddy’s game.\n\nThe main fixture, which is a T20, will see Demerara Cricket Club facing a select Rest Team under lights.\n\nFans will also be entertained by the popular Sound System and One Man Band after sunset, while there will be a well stocked bar and Bar-B-que which will be served from 11:00 hrs.

Administrators are always unsung heroes as it is always the cricketers in the spotlight but, today the BCB wants you to know you are all heroes.”\n\nThose were the words of Chairman of the Berbice Cricket Board Special Events Committee Hilbert Foster when the board launched a Hall of Fame for Administrators as part of its Diamond Jubilee Celebration.\n\nAt a simple ceremony at its Dr. Cheddi B. Jagan Street, New Amsterdam Office, the BCB inducted Lennox Phillips, Victor Omrow, Mortimer George, Ancel Hazel, Duncan Stuart and Leslie Amsterdam into its Hall of Fame for Administrators.\n\nFoster hailed the contribution for the six administrators and described them as hardworking, visionary and dedicated leaders, while expressing the hope that the current leaders of Berbice cricket at the club level would take a page out of their book.\n\nFoster also gave a comprehensive background on each of the inductees’ career as an administrator.\n\nDuncan Stuart is the first known President of the BCB and served for two periods 1948 – 1953 and 1956 – 1959. George served the BCB for 25 years and was Secretary between 1976 – 1983. Amsterdam, a former Guyanese opening batsman was the BCB President from 1987 up to his death in 1999, while Ancel Hazel is the only person to serve the BCB in every elected position, serving as President in 1986.\n\nLennox Phillips is the only serving President of the BCB 1972 – 1985 under whose leadership the board hosted six One Day International matches at the Albion Cricket ground, while Victor Omrow served as the BCB Secretary from 1969 – 1975.\n\nPresident Keith Foster, First Vice President Anil Beharry and former President Malcolm Peters all spoke at the ceremony and hailed the six inductees as heroes of Berbice cricket. Keith Foster, who has served as President since 2009, stated that under his administration, countless heroes of the game have been recognized and honoured.\n\nBeharry stated quite frankly that while cricketers enjoy massive financial benefits from the game, administrators serve voluntarily and are most times the unsung heroes.

Johnson traveled from Barbados yesterday where he is attending the University of the West Indies (UWI) and representing them in BCA tournaments.\n\nJohnson, who has played three ODIs for the West Indies but none since 2008 when the Regional team faced Canada at King City in North America, has two centuries and 19 fifties from 50 First-Class matches after making his debut at this level as a 16-year-old.\n\nThe Guyanese recently played against Bangladesh ‘A’ where he scored four half-centuries in that series in Barbados to earn him a place in the Test squad for the second Test against New Zealand in Trinidad but failed to make the final X1 as Jamaican Jermaine Blackwood was given his debut.\n\nJohnson was then surprisingly dropped from the squad for this series but he said he was hopeful of playing on Saturday and was happy that he is still being looked at.\n\nIf selected in the final X1, Johnson, who hails from Kumauni Creek in the Demerara River, will become the 48th Guyanese to play Test cricket and the first since Veerasammy Permaul made his debut against Bangladesh in 2012.\n\n“I just want to continue scoring runs as I have been doing and make meaningful contributions in whichever way I can to the team. I have been working hard on my cricket and my batting has improved,” Johnson, the only Guyanese to score a hundred in this year’s Regional First-Class session, said.\n\nJohnson has a realistic chance of playing Saturday since Kirk Edwards has had a poor run of form and could lose his place in the side.\n\nMeanwhile, West Indies Captain Denesh Ramdin wants his team to improve in the fielding department and is hoping for a ‘greener’ pitch for the second Test.\n\nWest Indies won the first Test by 10 wickets although five catches were floored at Arnos Vale by the home team with Mushfiqur Rahim, who scored his third Test century, benefiting most from the poor catching.\n\nHe got three lives – Chris Gayle dropped him at first slip on 10, Darren Bravo dropped him at gully on 25, Gayle again dropped him on 71, while Edwards also put down a simple chance offered by Mahmudullah when the batsman skied a catch off Gayle to cover.\n\n“I think our team is in a good place. Our batsmen are getting runs and our bowlers are getting wickets. We hope the pitch in St Lucia will be a lot greener than the one for the first Test,” Ramdin said.\n\nRamdin said the dropped catches are a cause for concern. ”Our slip catching has hampered us in the past and in St Lucia we definitely need to hold all our chances.\n\n“I think after the first innings, they came back and batted well in the second innings. They applied themselves. It was going to be hard following on, our bowlers had a good run in the first innings,” Ramdin said. “It was a good pitch and it got better as the game went along.\n\n“Rahim came in and batted really well with Mahmudullah. I think that was the partnership that took it away a little from us. But we bowled in some good areas and created chances. We didn’t take our slip catching as well as we wanted to.”\n\n“Kraigg Brathwaite is definitely growing from strength to strength and is displaying immense maturity. We hope he can continue on to bigger and better things. [Shivnarine] Chanderpaul also batted well to support Brathwaite,” Ramdin concluded.\n\nFirst Published By Kaieteur News.\n\nCategory:\n\nPublish On Home:\n\nYes\n\nBlurb:\n\nAt 27, left-handed middle order batsman Leon Johnson gets another chance to make his Test debut on Saturday when West Indies oppose Bangladesh in the second and final Dhaka Bank Test match here in St Lucia.\n\n↧\n\nPMCC makes donation to two players\n\nGuyana Chronicle article.\n\nGeorgetown, Guyana - With the aim of promoting literacy among its young members, the Vicram Seubarran-steward Port Mourant Cricket Club (PMCC) recently presented two of its young members with educational materials and school supplies.\n\nThe grandmother of Joshua Beharry, an Under-15 member of the club, approached same for assistance and got a favourable response, while Daniel Samaroo, the club’s Under-17 captain, is a fifth form student of Lower Corentyne High School and was the recipient of text books.\n\nBeharry, who is also an orphan and resides with his grandmother from birth, received from PMCC, a backpack which contained uniforms so he can attend school as well as shoes, socks, underwear, books, calculators, pens, etc, for his daily classes at the Lower Corentyne Secondary School.\n\nWith the belief that Samaroo has the potential to balance his academics while still performing commendably on the cricket field, the diminutive batsman was furnished with textbooks, while the club is presently identifying part-time lessons for him at their own expense.\n\nAccording to Seubarran, other young members of the club stand to benefit from the same gesture, with Cheddi Budhoo an Under-15 player being the next target for assistance in this regard,.

Lorimer top-scored with 34, backed by an unbeaten 33 from Omesh Wijesiriwardena, 23 from Lawrence Farnum and an unbeaten 19 from Carmichael, to earn for themselves the South London Sunday League Division One title.\n\nFirst Published In The Guyana Chronicle.\n\nCategory:\n\nPublish On Home:\n\nNo\n\nBlurb:\n\nMalteenoes Sports Club all-rounder Kellon Carmichael two weekends ago, struck back-to-back half-centuries for Hadleigh and Thundersley and Sabina Cricket Club respectively in England, powering the latter closer to the South London Sunday League Division One title.\n\n↧\n\nSeveral teams record wins in latest round\n\nGuyana Times article.\n\nGeorgetown, Guyana - The Muslim Youth Organisation of Guyana (MYO) in association with Raf’s Variety Store’s fourth annual Hajjin Zeleena Rafeek Memorial countrywide Inter-Jamaat 10/10 knockout softball cricket tournament continued last Sunday at various grounds with several teams recording victories.\n\nIn the games played, Grove B defeated Farm B, Diamond/Grove defeated Grove A, Success defeated Old Mosque, Enmore defeated New Mosque, Leonora defeated Farm A and Fairfield defeated Adventure.\n\nIn the first major upset of this year’s tournament, Grove B defeated the finalist of last year’s tournament, Farm B.

Garvin Nedd (coach), Clive Grimond (manager/assistant coach).\n\nBerbice: Narsingh Deonarine (captain), Veerasammy Permaul, Kandasammy Surujnarine, Seon Hetmyer, Devon Clements, Jonathan Foo, Rajiv Ivan, Anthony Bramble, Jason Sinclair, Romario Shepherd, Gudakesh Motie, Krishendat Ramoo, Keon Joseph, Raun Johnson.
