        "text": "Highlights: A century from Pearson 126(Benfleet)was not enough to secure the win for Benfleet as they chased the major score of 318 set by Hadleigh. Jack Holmes (90), A Walker (53) and Danny Timms (64) for Hadleigh set the total and, when Benfleet batted, George Cronin (6-57) did the damage to the Benfleet innings."
