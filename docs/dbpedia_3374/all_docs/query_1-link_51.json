A full price ticket equates to less than 1 hour of billable time for the majority of lawyers around the world. For students it is less than the price of a couple of cups of coffee for each session, and is less than 5% of the cost of many online courses. Therefore, we hope you will understand why we do not offer any additional discounts.\n\nProfessional Development\n\nThe conference offers 6 hours of self-accredited CPD.\n\nSponsors\n\nVenue Sponsor - OmniSports\n\nVenue & Travel Arrangements\n\nOmniSports, (The Gallery) 3 Archway, Hulme, Manchester M15 5QJ.\n\nTravel Arrangements:\n\n10 minutes by taxi from Manchester Piccadilly Train Station.\n\n18 minutes from Manchester Airport.\n\nCoach service (only on Monday 22 May):\n\nIn the morning two coaches will collect attendees from Manchester Piccadilly and take them to the conference venue, leaving at 8:55 & 9:25\n\nIn the evening there will be two coaches collecting attendees from the conference venue to Manchester Piccadilly at 19:00 and 20:00.\n\nYou can register for this service, which is on a first come first served basis, here.\n\nThe bus will be a white, unbranded bus collecting attendees from Piccadilly at the bus stop on Fairfield street.
