Laing -- Posted Tuesday, July 17 2007\n\nAlthough Canada cannot boast of cricketing giants of the calibre produced by some of the Test countries, we have produced some great cricketers, who, had they had an equal opportunity, could have reached that stature.\n\nPerhaps the greatest all-rounder of them all was John M. Laing. High profile cricketers are usually either expert bowlers or expert batsmen. Only once in a while do we come across a cricketer who excels at both bowling and batting.\n\nJohn M. Laing was born in London, Ontario, on March 13, 1874. His talent at cricket became obvious while he was still at school. In 1981 at the age of 17 he was selected to represent Western Ontario against a formidable touring English team captained by the famous Lord Hawke.\n\nThe next year, Laing was chosen to represent Canada against a touring Irish team at Toronto. He took 4 wickets for 35 runs. A few day after this match, he was chosen to represent Canada against the U.S.A. at Germantown. It was at this match that he came against the famous American all-rounder Bart King, who was also making this debut in international cricket. For the next ten years, these tow great cricketers dominated the cricket scene in North America.\n\nIn 1893, the 19 year old Laing representing Canada against the U.S.A. at Toronto, clean bowled the first three batcsmen, to complete the innings with 7 wicckets for 54 runs. In the second innings of this match he captured 4 for 69 runs.\n\nIn 1894 England again toured Canada again led by Lord Hawke. In the match at Toronto on October 3rd, thanks to Laing's bowling, England was able to accumulate only 147 runs. The match resulted in a draw. In 1895, in the Canada-U.S.A. match at Toronto, the U.S.A. collected only 65 runs in the first innings, with Laing capruring 7 wickets for 21 runs in 15 overs. It was at this match that he created Canadian Cricket history, by recording the first Canadain hat-tricket in international cricket. He clean bowled J.W. Sharp, S. Goodman and L.K. Mallinkrodt with three succesive balls.\n\nHe continued to play for various clubs, and during an illustrious career, scored 11 centuries, including 249 at Chicago in 1903, a Canadian record that was equaled by R.J. Buchan in 1913, but has not yet been beaten. Laingh died on October 1947 at age 74.\n\nArticle transcribed from \"CRICKET POCKET DIGEST' produced by the Ontario Cricket Association, circa 1987.

But we are forced to put this information in our website as the information that the other league has provided is inaccurate and it is everyone's right to know the information that is 100% GENUINE. We would like to clarify a few things that have been put in the MVCL website headed as \"Lower Mainland Cricket Clubs withdrawal letters\". They have gone ahead and put in the names of 13 clubs that have apparently withdrawn from BCMCL. Please be informed the information that they have put in under this heading is NOT 100% correct.\n\nWe have quite a few new applications to join BCMCL but that does NOT mean that they have withdrawn from MVCL. We will be accurate to let you all know on the basis of last year's structure, there were 26 Clubs and out of those only 9 Clubs have gone to MVCL and 16 clubs are with BCMCL.\n\nWe wish to put the development of BCMCL and cricket relating issues on our website and not talk about any other league. We at BCMCL are NOT interested in any other league's business but we wish that whenever any other league puts any information about BCMCL on their website or use the name of BCMCL then the information in that should be accurate. 2008-01-30 Arbutus CC Please click below to go through the email that Mr. John Hooker sent on December 16, 2007 to Mahbubul Islam confirming that he NO longer holds any position in Arbutus CC.

Due to this Mr. Hooker had NO authority to write a letter of withdrawal.\n\nOn January 13, 2008 Mr. Hooker wrote an email to BCMCL for withdrawal of Arbutus CC.

It was heavily criticised at the time for being too long, but more matches mean more revenue and that is a priority for both the ICC and the tournament organisers.\n\nThe main flaw of the 2003 event was that the Super Sixes was rendered almost pointless because of the way points were carried forward from the first round, and it remains to be seen if that will be addressed. The length of the last two World Cups have also been attacked, but it is hard to see with a reversion to the 2003 format how much time can be trimmed from the eight-week event.\n\nThe reduction from 16 to 14 teams means the Associates will lose two of their slots as Full Members, including Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, are guaranteed participation. The move is believed to have come from India and Pakistan, and with guaranteed support from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, it is likely to happen.\n\nPrivately, the ICC is believed to be split. Some senior officials are keen to retain as many Associates as possible to keep the World Cup a global event, but its commercial arm is thought to back a reduction in participants.\n\nLast week eight of the leading Associates wrote to Malcolm Speed, the ICC chief executive, registering their deep concern with the proposals. \"We would regard such a step as perverse and unwarranted,\" the letter said. \"It would be wholly contrary to the best interests of cricket and to the spirit of the game and [its] globalisation.\"\n\nTheir argument is a reduction in the number of sides goes against the stated aim of expanding the game into new areas. However, Cricinfo has learnt that some leading Full Members question the value of that policy and would prefer an acceptance that cricket will never really expand outside its traditional homelands.\n\nThose advocating the reduction say the Associates rarely shine at World Cups and that there is no strength in depth. While Ireland qualified for the Super Eights in 2007, the performance of other sides such as Bermuda and Canada was poor. And Kenya's progression to the semi-finals in 2003 was as much due to boycotts and a skewed format than anything else. It would be better, so the argument goes, to have the best four Associates playing six games than six playing three, as was the case in 2007.\n\nThe majority of the Associates most likely to be affected are meeting in London this week to discuss how they can tackle the proposals. The reality, however, is that they know only too well that if the major countries want to force the changes, there is little they can do about it.\n\nArticle authored by Martin Williamson, who is executive editor of Cricinfo\n\nArticle sourced from:-\n\nAssociates fume at World Cup pruning | Cricket | ESPN Cricinfo\n\nCanadian Cricket: \"National Championship\" -- Posted Tuesday, January 29 2008\n\nCanadian Cricket: \"National Championship\" Announcement\n\n....... and World Cup Reduction Proposal - 14 teams not 16\n\nAt a highly successful Etobicoke District Cricket League presentation evening on Saturday (January 26, 2008), CCA President Mr. Ben Sennik announced a \"National Championship\" that is apparently to be held on May 17, 18 and 19 - the Victoria Day weekend.\n\nIt was mentioned there might be two Ontario sides, so this would be a Provincial Championship, as distinct from the National John Ross Robertson event for which it is a few years since the East and West regional winners last met to decide a National Champion.\n\nNo word on a title sponsor for the Provincial Championship was given. There was no supporting media release that I am aware of and there had been no announcement on the CCA website when I checked earlier today (Monday January 28).\n\nAt the 2005 CCA AGM a plan was announced to stage a Provincial Championship in 2007. The official event proposal was deferred but the Manitoba Cricket Association showed great initiative and hosted an invitational Inter-Provincial event, won by the British Columbia side (Meraloma played in lieu of a formal provincial BC team). The Western provinces and Quebec all participated.\n\nThere has been much talk of the CCA being run on a professional basis. With certain notable exceptions, when will that come to pass?\n\nCricket World Cup 2011 Proposed Reduction to 14 teams\n\nInterestingly, nothing was said about the proposal to reduce the number of participants in Cricket World Cup 2011 from 16 to 14. Yet Canada was a signatory to a joint letter complaining about the situation. And the news would have almost certainly already broken in Malaysia by Saturday night in north Etobicoke, Canada.\n\nThe situation reflects a fear various Canadian players had around the time of CWC2007. Several of them will have heard far more fine words over the years than I have.\n\nBut again, this news had yet to break on the CCA website early on Monday morning. Why not?\n\nIt seems too much like business as usual, which is just not good enough. Or is it the fault of \"Cricket Canada\", rather than the \"CCA\"? Merely dabbling with name changes does not address substantive issues.\n\nThe players, officials, administrators, as well as potential players, officials and administrators across this country deserve much better. As do the spectators and potential spectators.\n\nFor the game to truly grow, it needs to attract the media. Mainstream, local, ethnic, cricket specialists, etcetera.\n\nReality Corner\n\nIt can sometimes be easier to deal with external party issues (such as ICC issues) than with your own issues (domestic Canadian cricket). But for the most part, if you can't run your own show properly to match the on-field talent and the support of the valiant volunteers who love the game, can you expect to be listened to on the broader stage?\n\nThe \"South Asian Contribution to Cricket\" series of exhibitions in Toronto was a Canadian nominee for this year's ICC Development Awards. Earlier in January, I received a simple inquiry as each nomination is subject to review in the overall processes. 'What was the CCA's contribution to this event?\"\n\nOther people had realized it did not seem to be very much. But various current and past players and officials were good enough to support the official launch at a reception. There was not even a welcome letter from the CCA in the official brochure for the event, produced by the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation department.\n\nIt was even necessary to find some extra sponsors to support the production of a limited number of brochures for the event. Some brochures have passed beyond Canada's borders to try and promote the image of the game in this country.\n\nApparently it is not easy to get sponsors and advertisers, according to one writing I recently received. But it seemed dead easy for the same CCA official to stand up and ask, if not demand, three more cricket pitches from the City on the night of the public reception. And who would pay for such development? There was no indication that the CCA would provide any financial support.\n\nRealistically, there is a need for more than three new pitches in Toronto so junior and women's cricket has a better chance of developing. Then someone would have to deal with the issue that many of the potential cricket playing population is poor. So serious financial help, patently needed for some time past, is needed.\n\nBut the ability to ignore gifthorses still exists. Which CCA leader was on hand to speak to the a Chairman of a major Canadian fund management company, who also ranks high in a local University, during last summer's Colleges and Universities Tournament?\n\nNone. But \"we\" are keen to promote cricket in our colleges and universities. Or so official CCA statements and speakers proclaim.\n\nEddie Norfolk\n\nMajor batting and bowling feats for Canada -- Posted Monday, January 28 2008\n\nMajor batting and bowling feats for Canada\n\nBATTING\n\nRay Nascimento 176 runs\n\nCanada versus U.S.A. at Toronto, Canada in 1963\n\nKen Trestrail 175 runs\n\nCanada versus Combined Services at Chatham, England, 1954\n\nQaiser Ali 174 runs\n\nCanada versus Holland\n\nat Pretoria, South Africa, 2006\n\nJohn Davison 165 runs\n\nCanada versus Bermuda\n\nat King City, Ontario, 2006\n\nPaul Prashad 164 runs, not out\n\nCanada versus Papua-New Guinea\n\nI.C.C.

This started with the public forum ”Cricket: Reality, Respect, Reward” at Toronto's Metro Hall in April 2006.\n\nWas this the same person who went on about being “I am East Indian. You are West Indian.” to Canada's team manager who was about to umpire a match, and a scorer back in August?\n\nA man who seemed ignorant of the migration of people from the Indian sub-continent to the Caribbean that began in the 1800s? Many of those who migrated did not have an easy time, to put it mildly, working in places like the plantations.\n\nAnd the first South Asian Test Cricketer, K.S. Ranjitsinhji, was not universally welcomed in England, the country for whom he played.\n\nPerhaps the influnce of the speakers' children is starting to take effect. They are clearly more used to a multi-cultural environment, such as exists in Canada and Canadian cricket. Would that there was an even broader mix. The potential of the Chinese market for cricket development has begun to be explored. Indeed, the defining picture in “Cricket without boundaries” is of cricket being played by youngsters with a backdrop of the Great Wall of China.\n\nEducation is a key need, not just in Canada and not just in cricket, but as part of life. The theme of the spirit of cricket being an integral part of the spirit of life is explored in many books on the sport and in the film ”Cricket and the Meaning of Life.”\n\nIn Canadian cricket there is a need to significantly expand the development program to attract youngsters through camps and walk-up opportunities. The British Columbia Mainland Cricket League has been running camps for many years. The Hamilton and District Cricket League ran a camp last summer, with assistance from the Ontario Cricket Association. Manitoba and Alberta Cricket Associations have developed programs.\n\nAll could do with more resources - infrastructure, funding, human resources to coach and run such programs. There has patently been limited direction and drive from the sport's governing body over several years in Canada. Opportunities to properly promote and resouce the game have been lost during events such as the 2001 ICC Trophy.\n\nBut mere words do not create proper spirit of the game. It is similar in corporate business where the tone at the top can be critical. “Do as I do (and believe)” rather than “do as I say (and at times clearly do not do or believe). There can be a fine line, at first, between working together with a common purpose and the 'divide and conquer' approach.\n\nThere are quite a few disciples of the 'self-praise' and 'self-interest 'societies in Canadian cricket in the Greater Toronto Area. My background and upbringing does not make me a member or a natural follower of those philosophy philosophies.\n\nCricket has tremendous potential in this country but it is not being properly lead or managed at the top. The overall pyramid of cricket's development is also dependent on proper leadership in the individual leagues and associations.\n\nCricket in Ontario took one step forward on Saturday night with the news that the Etobicoke District League is to be ratified as a full member of the Ontario Cricket Association. It is a well run league and the program supporting the Annual Awards Ceremony puts some other efforts to recognize Canadian cricketing achievements to shame.\n\nThe CCA Bylaws and Guidelines indicate that around 1982 the Etobicoke League had 120 players. It now has 62 clubs, 73 teams and about 1600 players. A major expansion, but one that is currently limited by lack of playing facilities.\n\nThe Toronto and District Cricket Association had about 2300 players plus some 170 juniors in 1982 (2500 players overall) and now has about 1500 players plus around 1000 juniors and students ( 2600 players overall). It also has said it is at capacity due to playing facilities.\n\nHopefully, someone will have proposed changing the election process to having nominations for specific positions and that this will be adopted as the way to progress. There is little point in having people without the necessary skills or interest in a particular area of administration holding responsibility for such an unmatched portfolio.\n\nIt has been disclosed during the summer that the T&D, as well as the OCA, has assisted the CCA financially. It will be interesting to see how that aspect plays out at this year's AGM, given the concerns expressed one year ago that resulted in changes in the T&D's Board of Governors.\n\nI cannot attend the start of the T&D AGM. Indeed, I am not sure if after last night I am interested in hearing some of the rhetoric that might be said. I'll see after my morning commitments.\n\nThe Canadian game needs genuine people to lead it forward, some requiring a mix of cricket and business skills. There is the restraint of how much time people can spare and some potential candidates may opt out due to some of the politics that detract from the development and growth of the game at various levels in the Canadian cricketing heartland. People who might bring planning and project management skills to the table. A deficiency identified in the Ontario Cricket Association by the Provincial Auditor General, and something clearly lacking in the CCA, based on my experience.\n\nOne of the most bizarre comments of the summer came at a forum at the University of Toronto. The 2001 ICC Trophy, hosted by the CCA, had been a success. It might have been logistically and certainly helped push Canada into the first of consecutive Cricket World Cup appearances. But financially the CCA was pushed towards bankruptcy.\n\nSomeone needs to do some broader thinking and the controlling body of the sport in this country needs to demonstrate it can control and lead the game. It certainly failed to do that last summer. A few fine words on Saturday night and a prettily written response to some simple questions are far from sufficient.\n\nI hold out a ray of hope for the person who talked about ”I'm East Indian” He admitted what he said in private correspondence. He and several other people who hold or have held office in Canadian cricket, could do with some education on working and living together. But I certainly would not support him for any office in Canadian cricket if I had a vote. And not just because of the one comment.\n\nIf anyone is particularly interested, I did raise the issue of the Oak Ridges Moraine legislation in detail with certain key people in Canadian cricket during the course of the summer. This has resulted in the recent announcement that major development at Maple Leaf Cricket Club of the stadium and hotel/convention centre will not go ahead. It is beyond me why this announcement was not made by the appropriate person at the CCA AGM.\n\nBut that's the way things are in Canadian cricket at present.\n\nVarious things are either done quickly or not at all. And sometimes when things need swift action, nothing is done.\n\nMeanwhile the National Coach, assisted by various senior players, is progressing in developing the GTA talent pool.\n\nIn my first conversation with the new CCA CEO he talked about not liking certain aspects of ”creative journalism”.\n\nMy friends at ”The Toronto Star” managed at least one creative item during Canada's trip to Africa in October. A scorecard was printed for Namibia A versus Canada. A phantom match, if you believe the schedule provided on the official CCA website.\n\nBut various aspects of relations and communications are weak at the CCA level and fail to assist the various provinces and leagues in giving the sport prominence.\n\nI am not certain if I will cross the city to take in whatever part of the T&DCA AGM is going on later today. My hopes and prayers will be for the sensible, pro-cricket people to succeed. The likes of Kam Chari, if he is still willing to help administer the game.\n\nWe certainly need more umpires. We need more scorers - ICC Americas helped run a regional course for scorers in Toronto last August, including an extra session for local scorers. And we need more people to report, capture images and publicize the game. Top to bottom.\n\nI had hoped to help get something going on the latter front after the ICC Cup Final at Leicester in May 2007. But what official role do I have in cricket in this country, or indeed any other? None. And who, by a short-term commitment and subsequent personal decision, basically funds my activities in cricket? I do.\n\nAnd if the sport is to receive better publicity there is a need for domestic matches to begin on time, scoreboards to operate and a range of other improvements to be made.\n\nThe key to success in cricket depends on hard work behind the scenes as well as on it. Richie Richardson said that at the April 2006 Forum at Toronto's Metro Hall to a sparse gathering.\n\nWhat a pity that more the self-praise society were not present that night. But, more important, in many ways, would be to see the Commowealth and Scarborough cricket associations come into the official Ontario fold.\n\nOr even the Markham one. I would have seen some of them last summer, if the ground had not been changed from that shown in a preview report.\n\nEddie Norfolk\n\nEtobicoke & District Cricket League -- Posted Tuesday, January 22 2008\n\nEtobicoke & District Cricket League\n\nPREMIER DIVISION AWARDS\n\nChampions Heartlake CC\n\nRunners-up Calypso CC\n\nPlay-off Champions Heartlake CC\n\nRunners-up Elmbank CC\n\nREGULAR SEASON\n\nBest batsman Arthur John (Heartlake) - 291 runs @ 97.00avg\n\nBest bowler Mattrasingh Ainsworth (Elmbank) - 21 wkts @ 9.29 avg\n\nMost runs Eddie Williams (Heartlake) - 478 runs @ 53.11avg\n\nMost wickets Vishal Uppal (Calypso) - 37 wkts @ 10.65 avg\n\nHighest individual score\n\nDrawin Christian (Heartlake) - 202*\n\nCenturies\n\nDrawin Christian (Heartlake) - 202*\n\nDrawin Christian (Heartlake) - 102*\n\nReyaz Prahalad (BSCC) - 145\n\nAlaska James (Calypso) - 134\n\nClive Newman (Elmbank) - 109\n\nBim Budhoo (Calypso) - 100\n\nMost wkts in a game\n\nVishal Uppal (Calypso) - 7/10\n\nAnthony Charles (York Central) - 7/33\n\nGilmore Stapleton (Heartlake) - 7/62\n\nMVP\n\n(1) Ganesh Badrie (GT Sports) - 328 runs @ 27.33 avg\n\n- 24 wkts @ 17.92 avg\n\n(2) Gilmore Stapleton (Heartlake) - 260 runs @ 28.89 avg\n\n- 23 wkts @ 10.04 avg\n\nPLAY-OFFS\n\nMost runs Abdool Samad (Elmbank) - 146 runs @ 146.00 avg\n\nMost wkts Eion Katchay (Heartlake) - 11 wkts @ 11.18 avg\n\nMVP Eion Katchay (Heartlake) - 26 runs @ 13.00 avg\n\n- 11 wkts @ 11.18 avg\n\n1st DIVISION\n\nAWARDS Division 1\n\nChampions Westies CC\n\nRunners-up Young Titans CC\n\nPlay-off Champions Young Titans CC\n\nRunners-up Cosmos CC\n\nREGULAR SEASON\n\nBest batsman Iqbal Kassamali (Melbourne) - 389 runs @ 48.63\n\nBest bowler Adnan Nazir (Gujarat) - 16 wkts @ 8.19 avg\n\nMost runs Darshan Buttar (Cosmos) - 443 runs @ 31.64 avg\n\nMost wickets Ritesh Patel (Peel India)- 34 wkts @ 13.47 avg\n\nHat-tricks\n\nHighest indiv. score Vivek Patel (Gujarat) - 129*\n\nCenturies Vivek Patel (Gujarat) - 129*\n\nIqbal Kassamali (Melbourne) - 124\n\nIjaz Malik (Diamond-A) - 121\n\nDarshan Buttar (Cosmos) - 106*\n\nManish Patel (Peel India) - 103\n\nMost wkts in a game Jaswinder S.

Attwell captured 190 wickets for East Toronto Cricket Club at a cost of 615 runs for an average of 3.39 runs. This is believed to be the highest total of wickets taken during a Canadian season.\n\nThe record of most wickets taken with consecutive balls in Canadian cricket appears to be held by F.M. Pellat who bagged six wickets in six deliveries while playing in a match at Trinity College, Port Hope, Ontario during the summer of 1890. Fred Pellatt was the brother of the famous financier Sir Henry M. Pellatt the builder of the Casa Loma in Toronto.\n\nThe first recorded hat-trick by a Canadian bowler in international play occurred at Toronto in September 1895 when J.M. (Jack) Laing clean bowled J.W. Sharp, S.Goodman and L.K. Mallinkdrodt of the United States with successive deliveries at the Rosedale Cricket Club.\n\nArticle authored by Kevin Boller.\n\nCanada cricket - A brief history ... -- Posted Tuesday, January 15 2008\n\nWhile there are fleeting references to cricket being played in Canada in the 18th century, it only established a more substantial footing in the 1820s with the founding of the Toronto Cricket Club in 1827 by George Barber, a master at Upper Canada College and newspaper publisher. He instigated local matches and in 1844 Canada met USA in what is widely believed to be the oldest international sporting contest in the world. The game, at the St. George's Club in New York, attracted large crowds and reportedly more than $100,000 in bets changed hands.\n\nGeorge Parr of Notts brought the first touring team to Canada from England in 1859, and although the tourists were far too strong for the locals the visit was a great success, becoming the first cricket tour in history.\n\nDuring these years of healthy cricket activity in the east, the game was spreading rapidly in the west. In 1864 the North West Cricket Club was formed at Winnipeg and in 1876 the famous Victoria Cricket Club was formed on the west coast. Cricket had already been played in both areas prior to the formation of these two clubs, but the game was now beginning to take hold in the west and as a result the sport was played from coast to coast.\n\nBy the 1860s the game was booming and when Canada became a nation in 1867 the prime minister declared cricket to be the national sport. In 1872 a third England side, including WG Grace toured, and the Australians visited for the first time six years later.\n\nA weak Canadian side toured England in 1880, then in 1887 the first major tour was undertaken by an all Canadian-born team. The side toured England under the captaincy of Dr ER Ogden and took on several of the counties on level terms. The team far from disgraced itself, recording wins over Ireland, Derbyshire, Warwickshire, and Leicester. In 1905 and 1907 MCC teams made brief tours to the USA and Canada.\n\nThe USA v Canada series reached its zenith in the 1890s, at which time the USA were strong enough to tour England themselves. But the growth of baseball and World War One saw cricket decline in popularity both sides of the border. The series with the USA ceased in 1912 and Canada did not play any overseas opposition until 1932 when Vic Richardson brought a strong Australian side including Don Bradman - he lived up to his reputation by smashing 260 not out against Western Ontario. Tours took place to and from the country in the 1930s - a public schools representative side was in Canada when war broke out in September 1939.\n\nAfter the war, touring resumed and a visit from MCC (1951) was followed by Canada touring England in 1954 where they played four first-class matches, including a game against the Pakistanis at Lord's. In 1958 Pakistan played a single match against Canada in Toronto at Varsity Stadium.\n\nIn 1963 the series against the USA was resumed at Toronto, while tours continued to arrive and the game was popularised by the increasing numbers of immigrants from the Caribbean and then the subcontinent. In April 1968 the Canadian Cricket Association was incorporated. Australia played four matches in Canada on their way to the first Prudential World Cup in 1975 and an Eastern Canada side beat Australia by five wickets in Toronto.\n\nCanada entered the inaugural ICC Trophy in 1979 and finished as runners-up to Sri Lanka, a result which earned them a place in the World Cup proper which followed but they were easily beaten by Pakistan, Australia, and England. Throughout the next two decades Canada continued to perform admirably, although never recapturing the success of 1979.\n\nThe large expat community led to Canada being identified as a potential venue for matches as the game looked to broaden its horizons. In 1989 a game took place between Rest of the World and West Indies which attracted more than 40,000, and in 1996 the Toronto Club hosted a one-day series featuring India and Pakistan, and this continued for four years. Official ODIs resumed in 2006 when Canada played their first games, although they had hosted the 2001 ICC Trophy\n\nWhile Canada has benefited from the ICC's desire to expand the game, it still faces major logistical problems. The season is short, the facilities are almost all shared with other sports and owned by local authorities, and the government, which used to back the sport, no longer does. Like the USA, the domination by expats, while improving the standard, raises concerns for the future and for the development of home-grown talent.\n\nThe John Ross Robertson Trophy is presented to the winner of an annual National club competition. The handsome silver trophy was first presented in 1910, after being donated by John Ross Robertson, owner of the Toronto Evening Telegram. Robertson was a well-known public figure and benefactor, and he is better remembered as the founder of the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children.\n\nRosedale CC won the first Trophy in 1910, but the dominant club for years was Toronto CC, who won it a record 16 times consecutively between 1932 and 1947. In 1982, the Trophy was re-organized to award a western and eastern Trophy, with a championship game arranged when possible.\n\nCanada v USA\n\nThe longest international rivalry in cricket, in fact in any sport is that between Canada and the USA, with the first match (won by Canada) played in 1844. It perhaps reached its high point between 1890 and 1910, when cricket has at the height of its popularity in both countries, and featured such great players as Bart King, undoubtedly the best North American cricketer of all time. The series lapsed somewhat between the wars, but was resurrected as a regular feature in 1963, when the two teams played for the KA Auty trophy for the first time.\n\nPEEL INDIA CRICKET CLUB -- Posted Tuesday, January 15 2008\n\nIn 1989 a group of cricketers joined together and registered a new cricket team in Brampton.\n\nPeel India C.C. was the result.\n\nThe club joined the Etobicoke & District Cricket League (EDCL) in 1990 and reached into the premier division within 6 years. The EDCL currently has over 43 teams within five different divisions and it is continually growing and has breed some of Canada's top players. With more and more players taking an interest in cricket, several new teams have developed in the Brampton area.\n\nYear Accomplishments\n\n1989 FOUNDED THE CLUB\n\n1990 ENTERED THE ETOBICOKE & DISTRICT LEAGUE\n\n1992 MAYOR DIVISION KNOCKOUT RUNNERS-UP\n\n1996 MAYOR DIVISION LEAGUE CHAMPION & PLAYOFF RUNNERS- UP WITH ADVANCED TO PREMIER DIVISION\n\n1997 SIX-A-SIDE RUNNERS-UP\n\n1998 SIX-A-SIDE CHAMPIONS\n\n2001 MAYOR DIVISION PLAYOFF CHAMPIONS\n\n2004 DIVISION # 2 CHAMPION & PLAYOFF RUNNERS-UP\n\nInformation sourced from:-\n\nYahoo's Aabaco Small Business: Websites, Ecommerce, Email & Local Listings\n\nCorrections to text by JH.\n\nToronto Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association -- Posted Monday, January 14 2008\n\nThe Toronto Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association welcomes all Old and New Umpires for the 2008 season of Cricket Umpiring.\n\nUmpires Motto to be remembered. \"When in doubt do not give out\"\n\nThe Spirit of the Game involves RESPECT for:\n\nThe role of the Umpires\n\nThere is no place for any act of violence on the field of play.\n\nThe Toronto Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association welcomes all Old and New Umpires for the 2008 season of Cricket Umpiring.\n\nUmpires Motto to be remembered.\n\n\"When in doubt do not give out\"\n\n\"Cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that it\n\nThe Spirit of the Game involves RESPECT for:\n\nThe role of the Umpires\n\nThe game's traditional values\n\nIt is against the Spirit of the Game:\n\nTo dispute an Umpire's decision by word, action or gesture\n\nTo direct abusive language towards an opponent or Umpire\n\nTo indulge in cheating or any sharp practice, for instance:\n\na) to appeal knowing that the batsman is not out\n\nb) to advance towards an Umpire in an aggressive manner when appealing\n\nc) to seek to distract an opponent either verbally or by harassment with persistent clapping or unnecessary noise under the guise of enthusiasm and motivation of one's own side\n\nThere is no place for any act of violence on the field of play\n\n\"Taken from the 2000 Code MCC laws\"\n\nInformation sourced from:-\n\nWebsite Disabled\n\nREFLECTIONS UPON A CRICKET GAME -- Posted Sunday, January 13 2008\n\nREFLECTIONS UPON A CRICKET GAME\n\nDecked in white against a blue sky, marking the point of concentration:\n\nThe striking of the wood surface by a seamed globe hurled fiercely (or cunningly),\n\nPoised to intercept the sudden flight or streaking blast across the ground,\n\nThese gentlemen still race their minds through the golden dreams of perfection --\n\nSplitting the sky with a single majestic stroke that converts that furious concentrated spin\n\nInto an aesthetic repudiation, returning an attacking passion with the triumph of the blow,\n\nThe deft parry that swiftly shoots sideways past the startled, helpless watcher in the grass.\n\nThe eyes that wait for that moment of grace when fortune tests the agile mastery\n\nOf he who would blot out the attempted comet rise --\n\nThe capture of the sphere of fate in a motion of unforgetful rage,\n\nLaunching the shouts of those captors fighting for the same quick death.\n\nAnd the chasing of that eluding ball, there to gather and to wing it near the sacred stick,\n\nPerhaps to surprise and vanquish the emboldened warrior\n\n(Who has just struck more life into his breast with his lathen weapon of joy).\n\nFinally, the executioner, who caressing his object of magic and of death,\n\nApproaches the rhythm of his art, and screams down upon his dauntless foe\n\nIn pure and surrendered ecstasy of all his strength and focused dance of desire,\n\nThere to let loose the motion of his life\n\nThat it may crack against the destiny of his tenacious pitch\n\nThis game, cricket, it makes me wonder how such beauty of giving, of yielding, of effortless stroking,\n\nCould not but compell us all to hurl ourselves upon the wonder of our fate,\n\nThere to seize the movement of the reception of our fate,\n\nStill passionately clinging to some goal of smashing down the middle stick of ignorance.\n\nPublished in The Canadian Cricketer, vol.8 no.2, June 1980 without attribution.\n\nU.S.A. versus CANADA -- Posted Saturday, January 12 2008\n\nThe International Series Match, Canada v United States, 48th Match\n\nPlayed at Griffith Rark, Burbank, California, September 4th, 5th, 1966\n\nTHE K.A. AUTY TROPHY MATCH\n\nIt is probably fair to say that the United States did not expect to win this match. This was especially so at the tea interval on the second day when Canada required only 99 runs to win with ten wickets in hand. The fact that Canada required only 99 runs to win with ten wickets in hand. The fact that Canada scored only 40 runs in its second innings and lost the match by 58 runs is now history. The wicket contributed in a great degree to the unusual happenings as the matting was on hardened clay instead of the usual Bermuda grass.\n\nThe United States won the toss and proceeded to bat for no less than 4 hous and 31 minutes for 136 runs. At the end of the first day Canada had replied with 70 for 3. Canada attacked quickly on the second day in the hope of forcing a decision but lost the remainder of the wickets in one hour to close the innings for 109. The United States were quickly in trouble and they lost 5 wickets for 19 then went on to 31 for 7. At this point Bains and Hodgson batted for 62 minutes in adding 29 runs. The United States innings closes at 71 leaving Canada two hours and 13 minutes to make 99 runs. At this point O.Lorrier of the Empire Club of New York took command of the game. At 14 for 2 he did the hat-trick, bowling Hackett, Taylor and Campbell. The innings was soon over in an hour and a half for only 40 runs, leaving the U.S.A. as victor by 58 runs.\n\nReport transcribed from the Canadian Cricket Association annual of 1967\n\nMeraloma Cricket Club -- Posted Friday, January 11 2008\n\nThe Meraloma Cricket Club was formed in 1989 when former Vancouver Rowing Club members sought to join the Meraloma Club.

(Jon Harris).\n\nThe Oak Ridges Moraine is one of the most significant landforms in southern Ontario. The moraine gets its name from its rolling hills and river valleys extending 160 kms from the Niagara Escarpment to Rice Lake and was formed 12,000 years ago by advancing and retreating glaciers.\n\nThe moraine contains the headwaters of 65 river systems (35 in the GTA alone) and has a wide diversity of streams, woodlands, wetlands, kettle lakes, kettle bogs and significant flora and fauna. It is one of the last remaining continuous green corridors in southern Ontario: it is still 30 per cent forested and is one of the last refuges for forest birds in all of southern Ontario.\n\nThe moraine's sands and gravel deposits act like a giant sponge absorbing rain and snow melt. This underground water is then stored through layers of sand and gravel (aquifers), filtered and slowly released as cool fresh water to the 65 rivers and streams flowing north into Lakes Simcoe and Scugog and south into Lake Ontario. The greatest threat to the function of the moraine is inappropriate land uses on and below the surface of the moraine, particularly in headwater areas.\n\nToronto City Council has recognized the importance of preserving this valuable part of our natural heritage. The moraine crosses many regions and local governments must take the total impact of any proposed development into consideration. The province has also recognized the importance of the moraine and needs to take more responsibility in protecting this critically important eco-region.\n\nThe moraine's treasures of native plants, birds and animals depend on us to save their natural habitats.\n\nThe moraine is one of the last remaining continuous green corridors in southern Ontario. It is still 30 per cent forested. Its 130 wetlands, unique kettle lakes and century old wood lots are home to more than 900 species of plants; it is also one of the last refuges for birds and animals in southern Ontario.\n\nToronto City Council recognises the importance of preserving this valuable part of our natural heritage. The moraine's native plants, birds and animals depend on us to save their natural habitats from development.\n\nCity Council formed the Oak Ridges Steering Committee to protect the moraine from development. Toronto residents can get involved by calling their councillors, MPP's and MP's to ask for their help in protecting the moraine. Residents can also find out more background on the moraine by visiting such web sites as STORM Coalition (Save the Oak Ridges Moraine) and Ontario Nature\n\nMoraine significance extends beyond its boundaries\n\nThe City believes the province needs to create new policy, act, or regulation to protect the Oak Ridges Moraine which is one of the most significant landforms in Ontario.\n\nThe moraine is a regionally significant natural feature that forms the northern boundary of the Toronto bioregion. The headwaters of all of the watersheds in Toronto originate in the moraine.\n\nDevelopment on the moraine will have significant effects on areas beyond its boundaries including: the overall health and quality of life in the region; ecological and biological diversity; groundwater, water quality and quantity within the watersheds of the region; definition of development areas in the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nThe red trillium enjoys the cool, forest floors of the Oak Ridges Moraine.\n\nThere is an overwhelming need for a comprehensive approach to preserve and protect the moraine. Following an expression of provincial interest in the moraine in 1990, Implementation Guidelines were released in 1991. However, a 1994 report The Oak Ridges Moraine Area Strategy for the Greater Toronto Area was never implemented.\n\nPreserving the Oak Ridges Moraine for future generations\n\nToronto City Council is working with a number of conservation organisations, local residents and other municipalities to support protection of the Oak Ridges Moraine, one of the most unique landforms in southern Ontario. The city also asks our provincial and federal governments to join in efforts to preserve this fragile ecosystem for future generations The moraine is one of the last remaining continuous green corridors in southern Ontario.

Grade 4, 5 and 6 students from Cornell Public School at Markham Road and Lawrence Avenue and North York's Grenoble Public School at Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue were invited to compete.\n\n\"There were cricket information displays and the school soccer field was transformed into a full-fledged cricket stadium with a boundary that goes all the way around,\" he said. \"There were also some tents to make a pavilion area.\"\n\nStone said he fell in love with the sport when he was studying for his teaching degree in Australia where the sport is popular.\n\n\"When I saw it being played in Australia I thought it was great,\" he said. \"It's a great game. It's a hand-eye co-ordination sport like baseball, but a lot more strategy.\"\n\nSo, along with a baseball team practice, the school held regular cricket practices.\n\n\"It provided an opportunity for more of the school to get involved,\" he said. \"Being a Toronto school there's no question that cricket is a sport for a lot of the students that is in their background. Maybe their parents played it.\"\n\nEngland is the birthplace of cricket, he said, and the sport spread through South Asia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies, including Jamaica and Barbados, and Australia.\n\nStone said he started working on the school's cricket festival back in March.\n\nThrough a partnership with the two other schools and help from Melvin John, president of M D Community Corp., who brought in and paid for cricket coaches as well as supplying equipment.\n\nJohn said he got involved in the cricket festival to promote the sport.\n\n\"I played cricket since I was a child and I like being able to bring cricket into the schools,\" he said. \"I went to the schools and offered my help in any way I could to promote cricket. They didn't have a coach so I found one that could go in and work with the kids.\"\n\nJohn, who is an Anglo-Indian from Pakistan, has been in Canada for 20 years and lives in Scarborough. \"A lot of kids have never played,\" he said. \"They're very hyped about it.\"\n\nHe would like to see the sport played competitively at a junior level.\n\n\"If we had started this in the 1970s we would have had a great team in the World Cup,\" he said. \"We need to groom our kids much earlier. It's not just a game for South Asians, English or Australians. It's a game for everybody.\"\n\nStone said he's all for pushing grass roots cricket in the schools.\n\n\"One day our national team will be made up of players who learned cricket in Canada,\" he said.\n\nStone said part of the problem with promoting the sport is most people are frightened of it. \"It seems so strange and different,\" he said. \"There's a lot of strategy, but the kids are attracted to that. The kids like that they have to do some thinking. It's perceived to be a complicated sport but it's not as much as people think.\"\n\nIt involves the skill of overhand bowling.\n\n\"You have to throw with a straight arm overhand bowl,\" he said. \"It doesn't compare to any other sport. It's a very unique action.\"\n\nThat's where the coach has been essential to teach them how to do the overhand bowling properly.\n\n\"The students have made great progress not only in their skill but also in understanding the spirit of the game,\" he said. \"All sports have sportsmanship but cricket puts a heavy emphasis on the spirit of the game. It's a gentleman's sport and the tradition of the game is very important.\"\n\nCricket will probably never become a major sport like baseball or hockey, John said.\n\n\"Cricket will find it's own place,\" John said. \"There should be a variety of sports for everybody and cricket is now a part of that variety.\"\n\nArticle sourced from:-\n\nPage not found\n\nCCA booklet 1960 -- Posted Sunday, January 6 2008\n\nThis booklet represents the second successive attempt to record the statistics for a full season of Canadain cricket. It is a pleasure to report that we have been able to extend our coverage due to the excellent cooperation of league and club statiscticians. In this annual are included the records of 124 clubs participating in league cricket and 5 clubs without league affiliation. Only one league and eight independent clubs to report their seasons fixtures. We have good reason reason to hope that the 1961 Annual will include all league and clubs for the first time, and so enable us to present a complete summary of a season of Canadain Cricket.\n\nDonald King - Secretary\n\nK.R.

Bermuda chose to bat and made 169 for 7 in their 40 overs. Canada then marched to an emphatic victory, and the Americas crown, reaching their target with five overs to spare.\n\nBermuda's only really meaningful contribution came from allrounder Terry-Lynn Paynter, with an outstanding innings of 58 from 61 balls. For Canada, Helene Gaffney produced a great late bowling spell, to end with figures of 3 for 31 in 5 overs.\n\nCanada got off to a nervous start in reply but a 123-run third-wicket partnership between Kim Coulter (37) and Joanna White, who made a brilliant undefeated 50, signed and sealed the outcome.\n\nAlthough Bermuda did snatch two late wickets, it was too little too late. Paynter was again the pick for Bermuda, with 1 for 17 off 8 overs.\n\n\"It was truly a great team effort, and a fantastic achievement to win the game and the Americas Championship,\" said Ave Mogan, Canada's captain. \"The partnership between Kim and Joanna was really important to get us into a winning position, after our bowlers had done an excellent job in restricting them to 169. Everyone is very happy with this victory.\"\n\nBermuda have the consolation of the World Cup qualifier in Pakistan later in the year, and will undoubtedly apply all lessons learnt during this competition in order to be at their best at the qualifier.\n\n\"We batted well, especially Terry, to give ourselves a chance, but unfortunately our bowling was less effective,\" said their vice-captain Linda Mienzer. \"We waited too late to apply more pressure, but I think we showed a lot of character throughout the game. Congratulations to Canada, and we will return home and continue to work hard towards the tournament in Pakistan.\"\n\nIn the other game, the Trinidad & Tobago U17 team recorded a massive 241-run victory over a gutsy Argentina side. Star of the show, and player of the match, was young Amanda Samaroo, who struck a superb unbeaten 128, off only 125 balls with 14 fours. Although she did offer a couple of chances, her innings was filled with superlative strokeplay and masterful placing and control - truly a name to look out for in the future.\n\nSupport came in the form of Whitney Cudjoe, who made a fine 55, off 91 balls with 7 fours. Cudjoe and Samaroo shared in an entertaining second wicket partnership of 122 runs. After the dismissal of Cudjoe, Samaroo teamed up with Melissa Sandy to add another 121 for the third wicket. Sandy made 29 in 64 balls with 2 fours.\n\nThe U17s finished on a mammoth 333 for 3, always beyond the reach of Argentina, who settled for trying to see out their 40 overs, which they did. Catalina Greloni made an unbeaten 20 and Marcela Rojas contributed 17 as they crawled to 92 for 4.\n\nArgentina team manager Moira Culley said: \"The girls are very happy with what they achieved today, and in the last days, and I'm sure they are going to improve in the future as they play more matches.\"\n\nTrinidad & Tobago U17 team manager, Brenda Solozano, was also happy with the past three days of competition. \"We have aimed to maintain a high level of cricket here, and I think we have done that. All the players in our squad were able to play in the games, thus allowing me to look at them for further development. It was also very pleasing today to see Amanda Samaroo achieve her personal best score.\"\n\nAfter a rest day, Friday will be the final day of the event with a match between the Trinidad & Tobago U17 team and an ICC Americas XI, after which an awards ceremony for the week will take place.\n\nICC Americas XI, from Ave Mogan (capt), Joanna White, Kim Coulter and Maree Wilson, Chevonne Furbert (v-capt), Reuna Richardson, Terry-Lynn Paynter and Wendy Woodley, Veronica Vasquez and Cecilia Birnie, Mawhish Khan and Santhiya Rajaram.\n\nCoach: Ann Browne-John\n\nReport sourced from:-\n\nCanada win first Americas women's tournament | Cricket | ESPN Cricinfo\n\nStadium proposal at King City cricket ground -- Posted Tuesday, January 1 2008\n\nVery recently there has been a rise in the discussion and articles on the stadium proposal in Maple Leaf Cricket Club (MLCC), King City.\n\nWhile the discussion about the need for a stadium needs to be appreciated, the continuous bashing of CCA for proposing a stadium in MLCC isn’t positive.\n\nThe current MLCC board has made enquiries and spoken with authorities regarding this matter and have come to a conclusion that development of such a magnitude will not be approved by the authorities. In all projects of this size and magnitude such suggestions are made about possible sites and then at some point a decision is made about the most appropriate location.\n\nThe need for a cricket stadium is both real and necessary to help the development process of the game in Canada. The efforts from CCA are genuinely guided by the interest of the game and I am confident that in the near future an appropriate size facility will be developed to meet our needs. The cricket community needs to participate positively in the support of this effort. The international teams from the test status countries are likely going to draw large crowds of cricket enthusiast’s.\n\nA credible facility to host 2012 U-19 World Cup will also be required. It is high time that the cricket supporters participate actively in suggesting solutions to the lingering developmental problems of the game in Canada.\n\nI want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a Happy New Year and also want to thank all those who came to the Maple Leaf Cricket Club and supported our facility and the game of cricket.\n\nRanjit Saini\n\nPresident, MLCC\n\nDecember 31, 2007\n\nGreetings for the New Year -- Posted Tuesday, January 1 2008\n\nHaving taken a break for the last few days, it is appropriate to wish readers and all Canadian cricketers the best of good cricket.\n\nIt is also appropriate that I should advise readers that there have been more than one million visits to Canada Cricket Online during the 2007 year.\n\nKeep playing with a straight bat.\n\nJon Harris.\n\nSouth American cricket\n\nChile v Argentina, 1938 (first-class match)\n\nSouth Americans tour of the British Isles (1932)\n\nMCC tour of South Ameri"
