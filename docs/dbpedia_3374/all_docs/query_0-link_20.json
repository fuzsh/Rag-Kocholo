        "text": "Leicestershire v Essex, Grace Road, County Championship, Day 4, 19th May 2012\n\nWell, you can’t say they didn’t try to make a game of it, but, as I was remarking just the other week, Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi Est (in this case, in the person of Peter Willey).\n\nI have seen fears expressed that our old friend the contrived finish might be a victim of sensitivity to accusations of match fixing but that didn’t seem to be the case at Grace Rd. yesterday. Certainly any shady Indian betting syndicates who’d thought to put a few million rupees on Wayne White scoring a 12 ball 50 would have been considerably better off by the afternoon.\n\nThe start of play was delayed until 1.30 by persistent mizzle. The personable Tymal Mills, fielding on the boundary, relayed the news to us that the arrangement was that Leicestershire were going to be setting Essex a target of 270 (I didn’t see anyone on their ‘phones to Ladbrokes at this point).\n\nI think most of us secretly like a bit of declaration bowling (perhaps something to do with the carnivalesque reversal of the normal roles and rules) and Josh Cobb added to the humour of the situation by being caught behind off his second ball from Adam Wheater (his second ball in first class cricket). As a freebie century would have done his average a power of good, Cobb may not have enjoyed the joke as much. Ronnie Sarwan was two short of his century when he skied it straight to Tymal Mills, who must have been wondering what the etiquette was in these situations, before taking the catch. In his current form, Sarwan might have done better to play his normal game.\n\nSomeone behind me pointed out – as slow half volleys were served up and the crowd cowered under a hail of sixes – it was just like watching the IPL (without the music, or the spectators). Apart from White’s 12 ball 50, Ned Eckersley bagged 70 off 19 balls and they can both be expecting an approach from the Deccan Chargers any time soon.\n\nMission accomplished, Essex began their reply and looked in all sorts of trouble against Leicester’s pace trio of Hoggard, Buck and Joseph. So much so that, after about an hour, they all came off the field again, citing Bad Light. Umpires Willey and Lloyds made a series of further inspections\n\nbut after a brief resumption the match was called off shortly before four o’clock.\n\nMost counties would regard coming off for Bad Light as an anachronism, but Grace Road is one of the few grounds (I think) that does not have permanent floodlights yet. One day I expect to see the last abandonment for Bad Light, which will be a bit like witnessing the last cavalry charge,or the last native speaker of Manx.\n\nIn case any readers new to cricket are confused about the difference between Good and Bad Light, this\n\nis Good Light (the divine light that emanates from the throne of God and his Angels), and this\n\nis Bad Light, the kind brought by Lucifer himself.\n\nYou can always tell that T20 is in the offing because strange objects begin to make their appearance around the ground a few weeks in advance. Last year they were in connection with the Hawaian theme adopted for the T20 season, but this year’s theme is more of a mystery.\n\nThese two objects\n\nmight be sentry boxes, or perhaps Edwardian bathing huts. Their use can only be guessed at. Perhaps the umpires will stand in them and emerge, dressed in Edwardian bathing costumes, to hold up signs indicating which kind of weather is causing the game to be abandoned. Or perhaps they’re planning to replace the cricket with a swimming gala.\n\nLeicestershire are still second to bottom of Division 2, largely because of the points deducted for a slow over rate in their victory over Glamorgan. Perhaps we should give up and try again in July, when the weather might have improved. (Exactly what we will be doing, of course).\n\nLeicestershire v Northants, County Championship, Grace Road, Day 4, 12th May 2012\n\nThere’s no art to find the mind’s construction in the face …\n\nThe classic shot of two batsmen leaving the pitch at the end of a game, being applauded off by the opposition and (though you can’t see this) getting a standing ovation from the crowd. But what was the result? What were the batsmen feeling? Hoggard isn’t known for wild displays of emotion, so he probably looked like this when he’d just won the Ashes. Wayne White could be relieved, in despair or just mussing his hair up a bit in case anyone wants to take his photograph. Mixed emotions, I’d say.\n\nA Leicestershire member could have run pretty much the full gamut of available emotions in the course of what was – in its way – a Readers’ Digest-style condensed classic of a game. In order …\n\nPathetic gratitude that we were going to see a full day’s play and that the captains had decided to make a match of it. Northants had scored 352-7 in their first innings, Leicester had foregone the chance of bonus points by declaring on 38-2 and Northants had done likewise on 26-0. 341 to win.\n\nDoubt as to whether giving up the bonus points was such a good idea and whether we were going to be there past about 3.00 as Smith and Kabeer Ali (who’s popped up again like a supply teacher to cover for sickness) went for 6 and 7 respectively.\n\nHope as Boyce (with his statutory solid 30-odd) and the man I see Michael Holding thinks should be captaining the Windies (Ronnie Sarwan) built a solid platform …\n\nElation as Josh Cobb joined Sarwan and played precisely the right innings, combining the power of his one-day batting with some judicious shot selection and resisting the temptation to hoick it over an imaginary ring of fielders down the throat of a real one. One compensatory aspect of Taylor’s departure has been that it allows the slightly older Cobb to emerge from Taylor’s (surprisingly large) shadow and feel sure of having an extended run in the four-day team, though the elation is tempered by the thought that, if he ever does achieve his full potential, the richer counties will redouble their efforts to lure him away. Unfortunately on 167-3 Cobb’s shot selection failed him and he was bowled by the pesky Daggett (ITMA) without offering a stroke.\n\nWavering as Ned Eckersley offered Sarwan useful support … victory was seeming less likely, but defeat avoidable too …\n\nThat familiar sinking feeling … Eckersley trapped lbw by Hall and his odd action for 35, Sarwan out unnecessarily sweeping Middlebrook six short of his century …\n\nResignation as Henderson (who’s now entering his forties) ended up flat on his face in the dirt going for a fanciful run, and Joseph and Buck both fell to the niggly Daggett, having added one run between them. Last man Hoggard joined Wayne White on 268-9 with 9.2 overs remaining.\n\nRelief turning to delight as the pair of them mounted a classic rearguard action (and who doesn’t love one of those?). Every ball in the last few overs, with every Northants fieldsman crowded around the bat, received a decreasingly ironic ovation, and when they left the pitch … well, that’s where we came in.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, Leicestershire came away with five points, Northants seven. And the bottom line is Leicestershire are second to bottom in Division 2, Northants one place above. A victory for either side would have been enough to take them clear of the pack and join the frontunners Derbyshire and Yorkshire, though I’d like to think that at the end of the day they had still time for a couple of reviving beers before they set off for Gloucestershire.*\n\nThe flowerbeds in front of the pavilion, by the way, are looking splendid, after all this weather we’ve been having …\n\n*Unless they were driving there, of course. In that case, I hope they stuck to the protein shakes.\n\nNorthamptonshire v Kent, County Ground, County Championship, 12th April\n\nLeicestershire v Loughborough MCCU, Loughborough, 14th April\n\nWell, here we are on the 15th of April with – for most counties – a ninth of the County Championship over already. By the end of May half of it will be gone.\n\nI had been a little concerned that the drought might mean a lack of traditional “early season conditions“, but I needn’t have worried. Almost every game so far has been low scoring and mostly over in three days. Any side with a decent brace or two of seamers and the nous to take advantage should still be in contention come the traditional mid-season break, even if their batting is a little fragile.\n\nLeicestershire, as we’ve seen, have been quick off the mark, but Northants still seem half asleep. Having lost their first game, they faced Kent on a morning when one would have thought that their seamers – Vaas, Brooks and the underrated Daggett – would have been straining at the leash to bowl. Acting Captain Sales, however, chose to bat. It was a day when, as they say, no batsman really looked comfortable (I don’t think anyone was comfortable for very long, as it was freezing) and they’d been bowled out for 132 by tea time.\n\nAfter last season’s poor showing, Kent have refreshed their squad by importing Scott Newman from Middlesex, Ben Harmison and Mark Davies from Durham and Charlie Shreck from Nottinghamshire. I suppose this is the other side of the trend for talented young players to transfer to First Division clubs – players who are slightly past their best or who haven’t quite made it sliding down to Division 2. Although Davies, Shreck and ex-Fox Stevens picked up wickets, the main damage was done by home-grown 22-year-old Matt Coles.\n\nI doubt whether Northants’ batting would have been troubled by this attack in the post-T20 dusty dog days of August, but by then – at this rate – it could well be too late.\n\nIt’s still the stage of the season when my mind is still focussed on the cricket, and – with so many wickets falling – there isn’t as much time as usual for the mind to wander, but I was pleased to see that Northants remains the only ground – to my knowledge – where a selection of eggs (hens’, ducks’ and – although they’re not pictured here – goose eggs) are on sale outside the Supporters’ Club bookshop –\n\nI had been intending to return to Wantage Road on Saturday for what should have been the third day, but it was fairly clearly that Northants wouldn’t be holding out for long enough to allow me to sample one of their much-improved pies for lunch, so I made it up to Loughborough to watch the MMCU take on Leicestershire.\n\nFor some reason, the ECB have decided that only the first two of the Universities’ games against the counties should qualify as First Class this year (if this rule were applied retrospectively, two of Leicestershire’s record wicket partnerships would be expunged from the records) but there was not, in the event, much boot-filling to be had, even against the students.\n\nThanks to those dreaded early season conditions, one A.C. Soilleux – who looked lively – took 6-64. When Loughborough batted a record low of some sort looked a possibility at 22-5, but – like Shackleton’s expedition dragging themselves through the Antarctic wastes – opener Patel and Leicestershire (and Harborough)’s own Rob Taylor managed to take them to a creditable 158. No-one seemed very keen to come out after tea, and most of the spectators were already on their way to the bus stop, but luckily any fatalities from exposure were averted by an icy downpour at 5.15.\n\nI would just like to refute the canard, by the way, that Ronnie Sarwan hasn’t taken his hands out of his pockets since arriving in England. Here he is, wearing no. 53, poised to take a slip catch –\n\nI see from Playfair that Kent have on their staff one Fabian Kruuse Cowdrey (Tonbridge) who may well soon be joined soon by Loughborough’s W.A. Tavare (who didn’t have much time today to display any hereditary obstinacy). It sometimes seems that being a professional cricketer is becoming a hereditary position, like being an Earl, or working at Billingsgate.\n\nLooming over the pitch at Loughborough is the intimidating bulk of the much-feared England Performance Centre. Sheltering from the wind at one point, I wondered about these mysterious drainage pipes that emerge from the side of it.\n\nWhat is it that drains out of here, I wondered. Icy water? Liquid nitrogen? Blood?"
