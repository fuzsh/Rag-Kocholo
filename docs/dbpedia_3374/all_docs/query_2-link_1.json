        "text": "Match Report By : Huntingdonshire CCC\n\nStill only one win for Development side\n\nThe Huntingdonshire Development Xl were without several key players for their trip to Essex where they were outplayed by a youthful side. The rain that forced two interruptions early in the match appeared to have little effect and the defeat was as the result of poor batting in the early order with one notable exception. The in-form David Clarke registered his second consecutive half century for the side and his fifth for the County this season but he lacked any sort of support until skipper Davis McCallum arrived at the crease with four wickets down. Earlier had batted solidly but McCallum claimed four wickets to slow their charge. There was a County debut at this level for teenage wicket keeper Chris Milner who performed well with both gloves and bat.\n\nBowling first Hunts claimed a wicket in their third over but skipper Dominic Hurst and Rishabh Shah batted confidently around the showers to add 117 for the second wicket. Spinner James Sykes got the wicket od Shah just one short of a half century and then opening bowler Simon Rose was brought back for his second spell and he claimed the important wicket of Hurst for 88. By now the home side were scoring at almost five runs per over and it was David McCallum who slowed the rate as he took the next four wickets at a personal cost of just 18 runs. Nick Browne (37) batted well for the home side and the target of 237 from 50 overs always looked to be a tough challenge. McCallum finished with 4 for 52 and Simon Rose 2 for 42.\n\nThe Hunts reply collapsed to 33 for 4 with only Clarke showing any real resistance. His 50 came up in just 35 balls with McCallum very happy to play second fiddle at the other end. Just twelve short of what would have been a deserved century Clarke miss hit a shot to mid wicket and was caught and he was replaced by James Cowan who together with McCallum reignited the chase for victory. McCallum was out for 46 and Cowan for an impressive 31 but then with just 38 runs required from five overs the tail collapsed with the last three wickets going down for just ten runs. opening bowler Max Osborne did the damage in his second spell taking four wickets for eight runs to finish with the best figures of the match at 5 for 23. Hunts last match in this years competition is against Cambridgeshire at Waresley on 26th August.\n\nCaption :\n\nAuthor : John Walker\n\nWebsite Url:"
