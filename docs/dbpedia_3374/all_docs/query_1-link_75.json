        "text": "An uncharacteristically poor display saw Wanstead and Snaresbrook suffer a 140-run defeat at Chingford on Saturday – although Wanstead remain top of the Premier Division.\n\nThe hosts won the toss and elected to make first use of the wicket, setting a commanding total of 241 all out.\n\nDaniel Lawrence opened the batting with a competitive knock of 55 before Shaun Eaton weighed in with 88.\n\nUsman Sahar was the pick of the visitors’ bowlers, finishing with figures of five for 68.\n\nJoe Ellis-Grewal also enjoyed an effective spell with the ball, claiming four for 53.\n\nOpener Arfan Akram (38) helped Wanstead get off to a steady if not spectacular start, but his teammates could not build upon his knock.\n\nOnly opening partner John Chambers (16) and Ellis-Grewal (13) reached double figures as the away side faltered at the crease.\n\nChingford took full advantage of the visitors’ shortcomings, removing them for just 101.\n\nEaton was the star man with the ball, taking five for 34, whilst Jamie Porter took three for 32.\n\nA quick-fire century from Bilal Butt helped Loughton beat Upminster by 98 runs.\n\nButt smashed his way to 103 from just 69 balls, scoring 13 fours and four sixes along the way.\n\nKashif Mahmood struck 76 and Mahmad Ali Khail hit 55 as Loughton reached 306 for four before declaring.\n\nThe impressive Butt then turned his hand to dismantling the Upminster attack, claiming six for 65.\n\nAlan Ison top-scored with 58 and Shahbaz Butt added 40 as the visitors were removed for 208.\n\nSouth Woodford suffered a five-wicket defeat at home to Chelmsford.\n\nBatting first, the hosts made 121 before being dismissed inside 42 overs.\n\nChelmsford reached a winning total of 123 for five from 43.5 overs to seal the victory.\n\nDivision One\n\nBuckhurst Hill picked off run-shy Hutton to claim a seven-wicket win.\n\nHosts Hutton won the toss and opted to bat first but could only make 133 before being bowled out.\n\nHanuma Vihari Gade top-scored with 38 as Hutton came up short with the bat.\n\nMohib Shah thrived with the ball for the visitors, taking three for 20.\n\nRicky Reynolds (59) got the Buckhurst response off to a good start, which Hermes Michael Solomonides (42) further built upon.\n\nThe away side reached their target of 134 with seven wickets intact to win comfortably.\n\nA disjointed batting display was to blame as Woodford Wells lost by six wickets at Hadleigh and Thundersley.\n\nPut into bat, the visitors struggled to build any momentum and were at 76 for five at one stage.\n\nThirty-eight from Ed Buxton at six and 29 from Joe Johnson helped smooth the innings out as Wells were bowled out for 193.\n\nTim Lowes took two for 14, removing the crucial wicket of Buxton.\n\nHadleigh started poorly and were three for two when Harry Callaway (1) was removed.\n\nKnocks of 78 and 73 not out from Kellon Carmichael and Adam Soilleux rescued the hosts, who finished on 194 for four.\n\nDivision Two\n\nFives and Heronians were undone by 142 from Orsett’s Paul Bennett, going on to lose by 133 runs.\n\nRyan Plom (55) and Bennett (142) gave Orsett a solid foundation before Mohammed Ahktar (52) came in at three.\n\nVisitors Orsett eventually closed on 332 for seven.\n\nEighty-three from opener Gary Edwards saw Fives start brightly and was supplemented by Mick Perry (45).\n\nA middle-order collapse undermined the innings and Fives were dismissed for 199.\n\nBennett played his part with the ball, taking four for 40, whilst Shahid Khan removed four for just 17.\n\nWest Essex enjoyed a seven-wicket win over Westcliff-on-Sea.\n\nHosts Westcliff opened the batting but were bowled out for 119 in 37 overs.\n\nThe visitors’ reply was swift and effective, racing to 120 for the loss of just three wickets inside 18 overs.\n\nDivision Three\n\nJibran Azam scored a stunning double century as Oakfield Parkonians beat Epping by 137 runs.\n\nVisitors Parks won the toss and chose to bat first, a decision which was vindicated when opener Shane Vamadevan put on 138.\n\nAzam came in at three to smash his way to 200 before being removed by Simon Lycett (four for 83).\n\nThe next three wickets went cheaply but the visitors finished on a huge 429 for six.\n\nOn another day, Epping’s reply of 292 for nine might have been enough but in the event they fell well short.\n\nRakesh Bagga (64) and Yasin Vadasaria (42) top-scored for the hosts, whilst Paran Kalley took three for 42.\n\nGareth Steed took three for 21 to condemn Woodford Green to a 42-run loss at Benfleet.\n\nThe hosts won the toss but were making little headway before Rob Zammit (50) rescued the innings.\n\nRemoved for 169, Benfleet knew they would have to bowl well.\n\nIn the event, they did exactly that and had the visitors at 73 for eight before some late resistance.\n\nAnthony Palmer top-scored with 31 as Green were dismissed for 127.\n\nSteven Reeve (two for six) helped Steed take apart the visitors with the ball."
