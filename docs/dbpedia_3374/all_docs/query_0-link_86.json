From the RectorSettling in to the last academic year before our 700th birthday, I feel a little out of touch.I took Trinity Term of 2012 as a sort of sabbatical, so that I could work on fundraisingand on one of the two important books we aim to have ready for the big year. Of course,I made less progress on both fronts than I had hoped, but that simply shows the risks ofperpetual optimism! 3\n\nP:05\n\nWe are now very much in the thick of planning our new site in Walton Street. WhenI wrote this column a year ago, we were just making the final choice of architect. Now,we have worked for almost a year with Alison Brooks and her colleagues. She is aCanadian by birth, who set up her own firm in Britain and has a subtle and immenselycreative approach to the project. She has given us a design that will snake along thenarrow site like the letter âSâ. A space on the central crossbar that we have dubbedthe âLearning Commonsâ will offer students and dons somewhere to meet, talk, hearspeakers, study and drink a cup of coffee. We believe that this will infuse the newcampus with all the characteristics that make an Oxford college quadrangle so unique. But although we can now see where we want to go, we are still in the foothillsgazing up at the peaks. We have had some astonishingly generous gifts over the pastyear, which have taken us some of the way to funding the project. But our fundraisingstill has a good way to go before we can safely start digging. In addition, we face thehurdle of planning permission. Our plans are for a dense-packed and striking group ofbuildings, and Oxford planners and politicians are a conservative lot. But Ruskin movedoff the site at the end of September 2012, and that encourages us to go forward. On the fundraising front, the Collegeâs biggest triumph has been to raise theproportion of Old Members making a gift during the year to a level never seen inOxford or Cambridge. No fewer than 36% of our former undergraduate and graduatestudents made a donation to the Annual Fundâsometimes only the price of a glass ofwine, and sometimes much more. We were especially impressed and delighted that,in every year since 2000, more than 30% of Old Members have made a giftâand inthe case of those who came up in 2006 and 2007 the proportion soared over 50%. Iwas profoundly touched by this expression of affection and support for the College. Itwould be wonderful to do even better in the current academic year. The Annual Fund, towhich we hope all Old Members will eventually give annually, on whatever scale theycan comfortably manage, is the bedrock of finance for the tutorial system. Even withannual fees at Â£9,000 for this yearâs intake, we are by no means covering the costs ofthis transformative but expensive method of teaching the young. We have also received a number of magnificent larger gifts from our alumni.Among them is one from Sir Ronald Cohen (1964, PPE) to help with the cost ofWalton Street. He is by a large margin the Collegeâs most generous benefactor, alreadysupporting in addition to this wonderful gift three of our Fellowships, all named forhis father, Michael Cohen. We are lucky to have his support. In addition, WilliamJackson (1983, Geography) has munificently donated sufficient funds to allow us, inconjunction with the Universityâs Teaching Fund, to endow another of our HistoryFellowships in perpetuity. We are deeply grateful to our major benefactors for theirtremendous support. I have also been working on one of the two books that we are producing for 2014.The other one is by Dr John Maddicott, our Emeritus Fellow in MediÃ¦val History. Toour great good fortune, this extraordinarily distinguished mediÃ¦val historian has agreedto write the history of Exeter College from its foundation by Walter de Stapeldon in1314 to its ârefoundationâ under William Petre in the 1560s. He has already made some 4\n\nP:06\n\nstunning discoveriesâfor instance, about the origins of the Fellowsâ Gardenâand iswriting in his customary wry and lucid style. The book I have been supervising, with the invaluable help of Hannah Parham(2001, Modern History), will be more appropriate on the coffee table than in the library:it is packed with reminiscences of Old Members. If you would like to send me a fewparagraphs on the Exeter you remember, please do: I particularly want to hear fromthose who came up between 1960 or so and the end of the century. Books apart, there are other ways in which we have already begun to celebrate thecoming birthday. Our series of high-profile lectures has continued. In May, our Fellowin Modern History, Dr Faramerz Dabhoiwala, gave a talk on his racy book, The Originsof Sex: a history of the first sexual revolution. It drew a large crowd. Philip Pullmangave a talk in Michaelmas Term 2012 about his book that retells some of the tales of thebrothers Grimm. And Sir Paul Nurse, President of the Royal Society and Nobel Prizewinner, will give the next lecture on Sunday 17 February 2013. Our other plans for 2014 are still taking shape. We are told by Dr Maddicott that theCollegeâs foundation date should probably be counted as April 4th, the date in 1314 ofWalter de Stapeldonâs charter making over the tithes of the Cornish church of Gwinearto support his new foundation. We are not yet quite sure how to mark the day. I amtrying to ensure a Royal visitor in the course of the year; we already have a promisethat our Honorary Fellow, Queen SofÃ­a of Spain, will come at some time in the spring.Our students are, of course, eager to have a Ball, not just a ball, and some are insistingthat it should be white tie, not black. So we had better all start recalling how to do theFoxtrot. We hope to create plenty of opportunities for our Old Members to return to thesite which we have occupied since 1315 and pay their respects. I have looked back at the two previous occasions on which the College marked amomentous anniversary. Many Old Members will recall the celebrations of 1964, butmore substantial and more poignant were those of 1914, when the College tucked into aten-course meal and marvelled at the newly-restored Dining Hall. When, a few monthslater, my predecessor Rector Farnell sat down to describe the festivities, he concludedwith these sad words: âOur atmosphere was unclouded by any foreboding of the war-storm that has burst among us. And now the memories of last [Trinity] Term are as agolden vista seen across a dark and perilous flood.â We are lucky to live in more stabletimes. In the course of the year, there have been the usual turbulences of academic life.We have lost some of our Fellows and gained others. Perhaps the saddest loss wasDr Joe Hatton, Fellow in Physics from 1956 to 1990, who died in April. He taughtmany Exonians physics, always with gentleness and good cheer. He insisted that hebe commemorated with âa large party for everyoneâ, at which Dr Dermot Roaf gavea delightful speech, which forms the basis of the obituary in this Register and isreproduced in full on the College website. We have said goodbye to four Fellows this year, and a fifth leaves at ChristmasProfessor Ian Reid, Fellow in Engineering Science, is returning to his native Australia totake up a chair at the University of Adelaide (where he will be followed at the end of this 5\n\nP:07\n\nyear by our Fellow in Philosophy, Dr Antony Eagle). We also lost several of our youngerFellows. Both of our Boskey Fellows, Dr Lucy Sackville, who has taught mediÃ¦valhistory, and Dr Christine Cheng, who has taught International Relations, came to the endof their three-year stints. These two important posts for young Fellows beginning theiracademic careers are the result of the generosity of Bennett Boskey, an American lawyerwho is an alumnus of Williams College and a friend of my family. Drs Sackville andChang have succeeded in securing permanent Lectureships at York and Kingâs CollegeLondon respectively. We also lost Dr Monika Gullerova, our Staines Medical ResearchFellow, another short-term post. She has already embarked upon a most distinguishedcareer, receiving last year one of four LâOrÃ©al UK and Ireland Fellowships for women inscience and more recently, an MRC Career Development Award. We will miss all of theseFellows, who have given the College a youthful sense of exuberance. We also lost Joan Himpson, who has retired after years of maintaining order in theCollege in her role as Academic Administrator. Mrs Himpson made a splash on her finalday by appearing in her uniform as a volunteer Games Maker on the Technical Officialsteam at the Olympic and Paralympic Games: she is a qualified and highly experiencedbasketball referee. In her place, the office is now run by Mrs Emily Eastham, whocomes to us from the Open University. We also welcome some new faces in Governing Body. Professor Jared Tanner joinsus from the University of Edinburgh as Tutorial Fellow in Mathematics, following thereturn of Professor Holger Wendland to Germany last Christmas. Dr Michael Osborne isour new Tutorial Fellow in Engineering Science, following Professor Reidâs departure.Like Professor Reid, Dr Osborne was an undergraduate at the University of WesternAustralia before coming to Oxford for his DPhil. Our two new Bennett Boskey Fellowsare Dr Kai Hebel from Lady Margaret Hall, to work on International Relations, and DrTom Lambert from Balliol and Brasenose colleges, who is an historian. We will alsohave a new Staines Medical Research Fellow in Dr Jeff Donlea, whose research is basedin the Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour here at Oxford, and a new MichaelCohen Fellow in Philosophy, Dr Andrew Huddleston from Princeton University. The College has had a good academic year this year, with a total of 32 Firsts inFinals. This huge haul put us only 12th in the Norrington Table, although we had thesatisfaction of being ahead of Merton. The table is an erratic guide to the quality of ourstudents and their work, but it is the one that grabs public attention. With the start of Michaelmas Term 2012 we have entered a new era. The incomingundergraduates pay Â£9,000 a head for a yearâs study. Many of our American alumnigape at the idea that this is a large sumâand of course, compared with the full cost ofa degree at Harvard or Princeton, it is a bargain. But it represents almost a trebling ofthe cost of University education, with little warning. The Governmentâs loan schemeis also generous by American standards. But it is still a considerable burden for astudentâs working life. Moreover, the College will gain only a few hundred pounds ofthis increase: the rest is offset by the withdrawal of the Governmentâs block grant, byfee waivers and by the cost of additional bursaries. Of course, young Americans at the top universities have access to generous financialaid. Oxford, I am glad to say, has designed the most generous package of bursaries and 6\n\nP:08\n\nfee waivers in the country. It benefits from a wonderful donation to the University fromMichael Moritz and his wife, Harriet Heyman, which will also help Oxfordâs colleges.Overall, though, half the cost of helping poorer students will fall on the colleges. Wehave had much help from alumni in meeting the cost of this, and I do hope we willhave more. I often think that I belong to the luckiest generation of the 20th century:born at the end of the War, educated free at Oxford, and emerging into a boomingjob market. Those of us who date from that era have, I think, some obligation to helptodayâs struggling youngsters in any way we can. Lucky usâpoor them. Frances Cairncross From the President of the MCRWhat an incredible year! And what a fantastic bunch of people! This has been, in manyways, a year of new beginnings. The MCR has recovered (with aplomb) from the nastyhangover of its very own financial crisis. The website is being launched afreshâtocapture in greater detail the life and times of the Exeter graduate community. The lockerrooms have been repainted and the gargantuan pile of âstuffâ that occupied the entranceto the water closet has finally been returned to its various rightful owners. The kitchenhas been refurbished with swanky cabinets and a dishwasher. Yes, a dishwasher! So nomore unwashed crockery blocking the sink, no more irate emails asking members toclean up after themselves and no more strategically reducing the supply of mugs. Itâs ahappy place. Do come join us for tea and cakes sometime. Right now, though, letâs take a look at what some of the members have been upto. The Junior Dean Michelle Caroline Fernandes won the TATA Ideal Idol 2012 forFoetoH (a portable technology for pregnant mothers to monitor the health of theirbabies themselves) and is (as I write) a semi-finalist at the Emerge Venture Lab. Shehas also been appointed as the Oxford Maternal Perinatal Health Institute InternationalResearch Fellow at the John Radcliffe Hospital, but will continue to be an integralpart of Exeter College as the Junior Dean. Akshat Rathi has joined The Economist asthe Richard Casement intern; in the past year, apart from two peer-reviewed papers,he has also published several popular science articles for Chemistry World and TheEconomist. Outgoing Exeter House Warden Barbara Havelkova, who has been the go-to person for all sorts of problems for those living in our graduate accommodation onIffley Roadâfrom welfare to lost keysâis now joining our sister college in Cambridge,Emmanuel, as the Herchel Smith Temporary Lecturer and Fellow in Law. She has alsopublished an article in the prestigious Cardozo Journal of Law and Gender 53. OwenWeller, who will have his paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters,won the Tony Carswell Prize for best student presentation at the recently concludedannual Metamorphic Studies Group meeting in Cambridge; as a runner-up in theOxford Graduate Photography Competition his photo will also grace this coming yearâsUniversity Prospectus. 7\n\nP:09\n\nMatthew Tye gave the keynote speech at the British Academyâs âVietnam inTransitionâ Conference. Ima-obong Ebong has published in two major scientific journalsand has been the publicity officer for a strategic focus group on Africa that attractedmore than 200 delegates from across the world. Dmitris Vayenas organised a workshopon policy analysis in Athens which led to the establishment of an educational not-for-profit foundation on policy analysis in Greece. Yaman Dalanayâs work will be publishedin a book edited by the Austrian ArchÃ¦ological Institute. And if thatâs not enough toimpress you, we have a Grammy Award winner as well: Felix Leach, in addition tobeing awarded the Graduate Teaching and Research Scholarship in Engineering atOriel College, has been a part of the choral production âLight and Goldâ which won aGrammy Award in the âBest Choral Performance Category.â Dazzled? Well, I am too. I canât go longer without pausing to congratulate this yearâs executive committeefor their effort and dedication towards maintaining Exeterâs reputation as one of thefriendliest student communities in the University. Vice President Maxim Polyakov (whohas taken over as President this academic year) has been outstanding in his role, setting agreat precedent for his successor Stein Belderok (the âDutch Tulipâ). Our Welfare OfficerEmily Dolmans has added a whole new dimension to tea and cakes with a deliciousselection of fruits, Mediterranean delicacies and vegan-friendly snacks. Our SocialSecretaries Andrew Bissette, Birgit Mikus and Yue-yi Hwa have kept the social calendarabuzz with memorable exchange dinners, bops and wine and whisky tasting events.Come Michaelmas Term 2012, Yue-yi will also be the MCRâs first Liaison Officer, andalongside the Welfare Officer will address the welfare-related concerns of the diversegraduate student community. A big shout out to Imogen Parry who has juggled the dualresponsibility of being Exeter House President and Sports Rep with impressive ease.Thanks to her, Exeter House has never seen a dull moment, with table tennis tournaments,movie nights, cocktail parties, barbecuesâand also Sumo wrestling! The MCR finances have seen some turbulent years, but thanks to the fierce austeritymeasures adopted by our outgoing Treasurer, Jaco Jacobs, our beloved common roomfunds have begun to look healthy again. The baton will be carried forward by SamuelDenny, who has settled into the role beautifully. Alistair Hanson succeeds Nathan Haleas the Environmental Officer and faces the challenging task of keeping the MCR petplant green and blooming. And last, but certainly not the least, is Paola Ferrari, whowith her infectious enthusiasm as the Freshersâ Rep in 2011 set the momentum for therest of the past year and now stays on as the Library Representative. But thatâs not all, really. There have been a lot of members who have worked behindthe scenes and have contributed in their own way in constructing an environment ofdebate and discussion and in strengthening ties with the College authorities and theundergraduate community. The issue surrounding the Christian Concern conference,though contentious, was handled with great sensitivity. Yue-yi Hwa, Toni Weis, DanielDolley, Mahima Mitra and Therese Feiler organised an independent MCR enquiry intothe living wage debate. A special shout out to all those who took time out from theirbusy schedules and made an effort to increase engagement and awareness among themembers. I feel honoured and privileged to have had the opportunity to work with acommunity of dynamic and motivated individuals. 8\n\nP:10\n\nAs I write in summer 2012 the new academic year comes closer, and the exec hasalready begun planning a flurry of social events for the incoming students. And as I getready to leave, I feel both excitement and envy for all the new students who will get toexperience the incredible journey that is Exeter College. Floreat Exon! Aishani Roy From the President of the JCRWhen I took over as JCR President there were two things I hadnât counted on. The firstwas that for the next 364 days my email inbox would permanently be filled with titlessuch as âMeeting Tomorrow,â âUrgent Mattersâ and âStressed? How about buyingâ¦.âThat last variety was spam, but certainly well targeted. The second was the vitality,quality, and calibre of everyone in this College: academics, staff, and certainly mypeers. Good sportsmen, great thinkers, bad karaoke singers and fantastic people; it hasbeen an honour to serve them. To do justice to this band of 350 JCR members in a littleover 1,000 words is almost impossible, but here goes. One thing that makes Exeter JCR stand out is its ongoing commitment to an activerole in giving the very best, irrespective of backgroundâthe opportunity to experience anOxford education. In Michaelmas Term 2011 the JCR voted to provide essential fundingfor a new âReach Scholarâ, an outstanding student from an underprivileged backgroundwho would have been unable to take up their place otherwise. Previous recipients haveincluded political refugees and self-educated members of war-torn nations. For me thisrepresents what we mean when we talk about Exeter being a âcaring and warmâ College.A special thanks to Dr Michael Hart for his advice and guidance in this matter. Another hallmark of JCR members is an extreme ability to combine academicdedication with social involvement, often to the detriment of sleep. The inauguralâLeaversâ Ballâ was held in Freuds cocktail bar as a black-tie, emotion-filled last hurrahfor Finalists to celebrate their success and time together. The first ever âWilliamsGoodbye BBQâ was also added to the JCRâs calendar, providing the chance to celebratethe great value of the ExeterâWilliams partnership. JCR hustings have become a centralpart of College events, with challenges involving a rap about the value of equality, whileelections received the highest turnout in recent history. Particular mention must alsogo to Charities Representative Chloe Evenson for a yearâs worth of open-mic-nights,quizzes and other charity events that have captured College spirit as well as makingsubstantial contributions to fundraising. Within JCR meetings Socratic debate and free thinking have been applied to issuesranging from whether limiting croquet playing hours in the Fellowsâ Garden representsan infringement of our human rights to academic facilities. Important improvementshave been made in turning a small room opposite the JCR into a quiet and comfortablelearning space for Finalists, simplifying the housing ballot process and bringing inoutside expert speakers on exam stress, modern feminism and careers. On the back of 9\n\nP:11\n\nJCR meetings, plans are in motion for the first ever JCR-written âCareers Handbookâand to hold a day called âDonât Worry Be Happyâ with the dual aim of maximisingCollege welfare and dispensing useful information. When discussing these changes with a JCR President at another, inferior, college, theyasked how I had possibly managed to do any work. The answer is that this wave of changeand improvement is the product of the whole College. Special thanks must go to CollegeâsGoverning Body and its Junior Dean, whose support and appetite for JCR engagementhas been a tribute to it. Even greater commendation is deserved by members of the JCRExec. Welfare Reps Ali Macrae and Tasha Jackson have shown unrelenting dedication tobeing the all-round happiest and friendliest people in College, with the former slightlyregretting his election pledge to bake a cake every week of term. Meanwhile Entz RepsImmy Pierce and Dana Singh have done a superb job of liaising with the aforementionedChloe Evenson in organising events and socials to bring all of College together, whileChris Morgan has done an excellent job of debunking the myth that all Treasurers areboring. Elise Bailey (Access and Academic Affairs), Nick Fletcher (Amalgas), DavidWallis (Domestic), Naomi Charatan (Music, Arts and Drama), Anjali Joseph (Equalities)and Adam Ward (Secretary) have all shown unquestionable dedication and it is a pity thatthis piece does not allow a detailed thanks to each of them. Particular mention, however,should go to Adam Ward who, for a long time being the only first year on the Exec,represents the spirit of his year as a vibrant, engaged and promising one. In contribution to College life further mention must go to Jamie Cherrington andKate Mathieson, who respectively organised the Trinity Ball and led the College charityExVac. The Ball, as always, provided one of the highlights of Trinity Term. WithCollege transformed by the theme âCarnivalâ Jamie and his superb team provided anexquisite spread of delights for all the senses. Many partied the night away while others,myself included, released their inner-child by going down the helter-skelter in excess ofone thousand times. Kate Mathieson, meanwhile, undertook the vast and yet incrediblyworthwhile job of being President of ExVac. This College charity, which provides localunderprivileged children with the opportunity to experience a real holiday, is no easyone to lead. Fundraising, organisation, teamwork, and the elusive ability to control largegroups of children are skills which few people possess, let alone a Finalist. Further creative and organisational ingenuity this year was shown by two English andone Economics and Management studentâJess Palmarozza, Jack Hutchinson and ChrisMorgan. The gang have relaunched the John Ford Drama Society under the new guiseof Exeter-run production company âExon.â The companyâs first (of hopefully many!)productions, Oscar Wildeâs The Importance of Being Earnest, was no less than a triumph! Sport remains a staple of College life, both in variety and quality. The footballteam produced a stunning final season and are favourites to be the best College team inOxford come Michaelmas Term 2012. Rugby witnessed a slight slip in its inter-collegiatestandard after last yearâs epic journey to the top division, although a streamlined versionof the squad has recently brought home silverware from an international beach-rugbycompetition in Jersey. The tennis team saw its most successful season in over ten years,with a run to the top four in inter-collegiate knockout and successive promotions. TheBoat Club is undergoing a transition phase, slightly dented by the departure of former 10\n\nP:12\n\nBoat Race squad members Ben Myers and Ben Snodin. Despite this Exeter posted strongresults in both Torpids and Summer VIIIs, with the women in particular showing almostOlympic ability. In University sport Exeter retains an over-proportionate representationfor its size. From rowing to hockey, and basketball to modern pentathlon, the never-ending battle with our Cambridge rivals lives on. Strangely often overlooked, Exeterâs academic progress represents a continuedmarch to the top. We normally donât pay much attention to the Norrington Table(ranking Colleges by Finals results) due to its volatility, but since we came ninth in 2011and not far from the top, we suddenly rate it very much. Individual performance remainsexceptional, with many leaving the JCR to move on to valuable further study. Particularmention might go to the former JCR President Alex Barrett who was representative ofmany in his year by taking a very high First. Above all I am always touched by Collegeâs ability to come together for those whoneed it most. Like any community some individual members have been hit this yearby family or personal difficulties, but like a great one the collective comes together forthose who need support. Phrases such as âthe Exeter familyâ and âCollege communityârisk becoming clichÃ©d, but in reality they are very true representations of the bonds andfriendships in our great College. Staring down the barrel of my last year is a daunting prospect. Two years haveflown by and no doubt this last one will too. And yet I know that above all I have beenprivileged to be a part of a College defined by its exciting, kind, interesting and brilliantpeople. This piece has only managed to do them a very small amount of justice. Floreat! Benjamin Clayton Vandana Singh (1991â2012)As the Register was in the press, the College learned of the death of Vandana Singh, athird-year law student. Dana, as she was known, was a livewire: she was at the heart ofmany College social events, as instigator, organiser and participant. She ran a Collegebarbecue at the Ephraim Williams House, ordered inflatables to ensure an evening of funat the end of the academic year, and helped to run the College Ball. Having never playedsquash before she came to Oxford, she joined the University squad. Not surprisingly,she is mentioned in the report of the JCR President in this issue of the Register for herwork as an Entz Rep, organising events and socials to bring all of College together. Her sudden death brought the student community together again, but in profoundsorrow. As I write, the front quad is thick with bouquets of flowers left by her manyfriends in this College and other colleges. No wonder. She was energetic, beautiful,gregarious and lively. She lit up our lives, and we will miss her very much. Frances Cairncross 11\n\nP:13\n\nJoseph Hatton (1923â2012)(This is an abridgement of the talk at a party given by his children for his widow Gwyn andfor family and friends on 29 July 2012. The unabridged talk is on the College website.)Joe Hatton was the youngest of five brothers brought up in a small Midlands village. Onthe certificate of Joe and Gwynâs marriage his fatherâs occupation is stated as âretiredcoal miner (underground)â. His mother gave the boys a strict Methodist upbringing: noactivities on Sunday apart from chapel (where she played the piano) and bible reading.Joe was made to take the pledge at the age of 14! As a boy he wandered the countrysideforaging; the boys threw sour apples against walls to bruise them and make them edible.He saw the bombing of Coventry one night when the planes were coming over hourafter hour. As he said, once they had the place lit up it was an easy target. He went toTamworth Grammar School where his favourite subject was originally ModernLanguages. But the teacher was called up and the best remaining teacher taught Physics, sohe switched to that. Like others who came up through the grammar schools Joe was froma family with no university experience, and it was his headmaster who encouraged him toapply to Oxford. A supportive teacher lent him money to cover his expenses as a student. He had already been offered a scholarship to Exeter when, in 1942 and still at school, hereceived call-up papersâa first payment of the Kingâs shilling, and a travel pass to the GordonHighlanders barracks inAberdeen. Then he got another letter from the Joint Recruiting Board atOxford asking him to come for an interview. He thought that was pointless, but his headmasterstrongly advised him to go for the interview so he could see Oxford for himself. He went forthe interview and was told he must come to Oxford. He said he couldnât as he had to go tothe barracks, but the interviewers said that would be cancelled, and he never heard anythingmore from the army. Joe told me later that at Oxford he studied Physics, wireless and bayonetfighting and expected to exercise the third of these skills when he graduated. He was interviewed then by two scientific manpower planners, C.P. Snow (later LordSnow of the Two Cultures) and his assistant Squadron Leader Hoff (also a novelist, whowrote under the name William Cooper). To Joeâs surprise he was directed to the secondskill, wireless, and put to work for the Admiralty research group on electronics. The labwas split into two halves, and he had no idea what the other side was doing but it wascalled the Tube Alloys Project, which he thought a very disconcerting title. He joinedthat group later. He said the Admiralty was one of his great lucky breaks. He became thefirst assistant of Rudi Kompfner, a refugee from Austria, an inspired scientist though bytraining an architect. It turned out that what he was to work on with Kompfner was oneof the most important communications developments of the war: a wide band microwaveamplifier known as the travelling wave tube, which meant signals could be received overa large number of frequencies and was to be taken up by Bell Labs in New Jersey. When his time with Rudi ended, he was asked by Lord Cherwell (Oxfordâs Professorof Physics and adviser to Winston Churchill) to go out to Montreal and join the secretBritish Nuclear Project. From there they went on to Chalk River, which is where I methim. He was exercising the first of his skillsâNuclear Physicsâwith his contemporary 12\n\nP:14\n\nJohn Sanders and with my father Douglas, a few years their senior. He and John spentpart of their leisure time with my family. I was eight, they were 21. I played Bridge withthem and my mother; they took me and my sisters canoeing. They were fun. Joe wasenergetic, swimming across the Ottawa River (more than a mile wide) in summer andskiing across in the winter. They played jokes. They hijacked the Town Beauty Contestwhich turned out to have six young men with long wigs as the finalists. In 1946 he returned to Oxford where he claimed to have explained the UncertaintyPrinciple to Heisenberg and took his Doctorate. He stayed on as a Pressed Steel ResearchFellow working on Helium-3 at very low temperatures. This led to a secret trip to theUS to see Edward Teller, the âfatherâ of the hydrogen bomb. In 1953 he was sharing ahouse on Henley Avenue with a South African medic who was soon to marry one ofGwynâs friends from Melbourne. Gwyn was invited to dinner there and arrived on time.Joe was not in evidence but she heard a man singing upstairs. It was Joe in the bath.Two things in evidence at that stage: he had a nice voice, and he was habitually latefor engagements. They were married on 12.12.1953. They then went off to Harvard,whither he had been head-hunted by Van Vleck. Joe was head-hunted back to Oxford in 1956 by Francis Simon (Lord Cherwellâssuccessor). He was also elected as the Collegeâs first Physics Fellow. He worked hard to buildup Science in the College. He teased his colleagues by describing Arts subjects as readingbooks and English as reading books at bed-time. His main concern at Exeter was not Collegepolitics but teaching his pupils. Many, writing in, have commented on his approachabilityand his understanding that students make mistakes such as forgetting to come to Collections.He pretended not to understand mathematics, and to being confused about conversion fromthe old cgs (centimetre, gram, second) units to more modern mks (metre, kilogram, second)units. He once told Robin Daniel that a formula was probably right because all the 2Ï factorslooked completely wrong. His pupils remember sunny afternoons in his Staverton Roadgarden with his home-brewed beer and with Gwyn as generous hostess. After some years at the top of Staircase 6 he moved to a small room on Staircase 14 of thethen new Thomas Wood building. With increasing seniority he could have changed later to alarger room in the Front Quad, but typically he did not regard his own comfort as important.He pretended to be incompetent at administration, but in a crisis he served as DomesticBursar and was eventually persuaded to be Senior Tutor from 1974 to 1978. His final greatservice to the College was as Vice-Rector from 1987 to 1988. Joe was on Sabbatical inMelbourne when Rector Crowther-Hunt died. He came back to run the College until SirRichard Norman could leave the Ministry of Defence to take up the Rectorship. In 1990 heretired from the College one year early to travel to Australia to see his first grandchild. He and Gwyn have three children and four grandchildren (only one of whom isstudying science). Apart from trips to see them, he and Gwyn spent their retirement inStaverton Road entertaining their friends to wonderful meals cooked by Joe. He was fitinto old age but in 2012 he became weaker and was eventually diagnosed with lung cancershortly before he died. He had been a member of the College for nearly 70 years. Heremained cheerful and joking to the end. And that is exactly how we all remember him. Dermot Roaf 13\n\nP:15\n\nJohn Linton Gardner, CBE (1917â2011)There can be few young musicians who do not feel at least some sense of historical awewhen they finally reach Exeter as the ânewâ Hubert Parry Organ Scholar. Evidence oftheir predecessorsâ musical achievements seems to lie all around them, and in my caseas one of them it was the name of John Gardner which was frequently mentioned, eventhough he had gone down nine years before I arrived. From the many anecdotes told bythose who had known him I began to build up a picture of a person who seemed littleconcerned with appearing to conform to the conventional image of an Organ Scholarand instead was much more imbued with the sheer joy of making music with his peers. John Gardner won a Music Scholarship to Wellington College in 1930, where hesoon made his mark, both as a pianist performing the first movement of RachmaninoffâsSecond Piano Concerto with the school orchestra, and as a composer with his Intermezzofor organ. His musical contemporaries at Wellington included fellow composer JohnAddison, and also Anthony Lewis and Philip Cranmer. In 1935 he came up to Exeter, where Geoffrey Bush, George Malcolm, Harry Blechand Edward Heath were among his University friends. His musical mentors at Oxfordwere Hugh Allen, Ernest Walker, R.O. Morris and Thomas Armstrong, and here I quotefrom a lecture his son gave in 2007, because it gives a sense of John Gardnerâs attitudeto the musical establishment of that time: âWell,â the father had reported, âthey gave melessons, yes, but they werenât lessons in Composition. It was how to pass the B.Musexamsâthatâs what the lessons were in; they werenât really in Music.â His greatestinfluence at that time was the philosopher, composer, Hitler refugee and Alban Bergpupil, Theodor Adorno, of whom he said, âI was a friend of his. I didnât have lessons,but I was always going through music with him at Oxfordâ¦. We played piano duets alot and we talked about music. He was an advanced student at Oxford when I was anundergraduateâ¦. He was very good company, actually.â In the June Eights Week Concert of 1939 Gardner conducted his cantata Salute toSummer and in September he was appointed Director of Music at Repton. Two termslater, in April 1940, he joined the Royal Air Force, becoming Bandmaster of FighterCommand Band which then consisted of some of the finest jazz musicians in the country,such as the trumpeter Kenny Baker. He then signed up for active service as a Navigatorand trained in South Africa, where he conducted his Variations on an Old GermanChorale with the Capetown Orchestra. On demobilisation in 1946 he completed hisSymphony No.1 and joined the Royal Opera House as rÃ©pÃ©titeur, and it was duringthat period that I had my first distant glimpse of him playing the piano on stage in theproduction of Alban Bergâs Wozzeck. Gardner later said that he had sight-read the partat the dress rehearsal because âthat would make it more interestingâ. From 1952 he embarked on a very successful career as a composer, receiving manycommissions and culminating in the performance of his Opera The Moon and Sixpenceat Sadlers Wells in 1957. As decade succeeded decade however, apart from the carolTomorrow Shall Be My Dancing Day, his name appeared less and less in programmesand he shared the fate, as did so many of his British composer contemporaries, of being 14\n\nP:16\n\nmarginalised, because these were the times when any âNew Musicâ that did not strictlyadhere to what was commonly supposed to have been the methods of the âSecond VienneseSchoolâ and the now even more avant garde âDarmstadt/Donaueschingen Groupâ wouldbe refused a hearing by the BBC and other concert promoters. Characteristically he wasnever bitter about this lack of recognition. But the invitation from Thomas Armstrong tojoin the staff of the Royal Academy of Music was timely, and for 30 years he would proveto be an inspirational, if unconventional, teacher of composition there. These skills he alsobrought to his teaching at St Paulâs Girlsâ School and to directing singers and orchestrasat Bernard Robinsonâs Summer Music Camps. At the latter his wide ranging choice ofmusic of all periods and styles, coupled with his insistence on the highest standards ofperformance, enthused professional and amateur musician alike. In spite of this full teaching schedule, which also included a professorship atMorley College, and in spite of fewer performances of his music, Gardner continuedto compose and by 2005 had reached op.249, the Concerto for Bassoon. There is notspace in this brief tribute to list the many substantial pieces which over the years flowedfrom his pen, and I urge those who would like to know more to go to the web for âJohnGardnerâhis life and musicâ, an illustrated talk which his son Christopher gave to theBritish Music Society in 2007 and on which my account here has drawn extensively.In that talk Gardnerâs music is fully discussed, and there is a discography to explorewhich shows the range and quality of his output. Now, in the second decade of the 21stcentury, when attitudes to musical orthodoxy are much more relaxed than they were 50years ago and contemporary composers have rediscovered tonality and melody, JohnGardnerâs finely crafted music must surely come into its own again. For myself, I was able at last to meet this man whose name had stayed with mefor over 30 years, when as Director of Music of Wellington College I invited himto adjudicate a competition for some of our top musicians there. It proved to be amemorable occasion, as he shared his lifetimeâs experience with us all and very soonhad made the meeting less an exercise in finding a winner and much more a celebrationof the sheer joy of making music. This ability to enthuse young and old, professionaland amateur alike, is a theme which has recurred over and over again in the nationalpressâs fulsome tributes which followed his death, and I think that is how he would haveliked to be remembered. Jared Armstrong David Walter Hamlyn (1924â2012)David Hamlyn, Professor Emeritus of the University of London, died after a long illnesson 15 July 2012. He was born and brought up in Plymouth and he retained a deeplove for his local countrysideâDartmoorâthe focus of many family outings. His wasnot an academic family, but no pressure was put on him to enter the family grocerybusiness and his parents were happy to support a son whose ability and willingness to 15\n\nP:17\n\nstudy gained him a scholarship to Plymouth College and, subsequently, scholarshipswhich enabled him to take up a place in Exeter College. This was in 1942 when Davidwas coming up to his 18th birthday, the age for call-up for the forces. Call-up could,however, be deferred for a year for students going up to university and David tookadvantage of this provision and matriculated in October 1942. As was required he hadto join one of the University Training Corps and he chose the Armoured Corps; as partof the training required he did some work with the three tanks stationed in Manor Road.His year concluded with Honour Moderations in Classics in which he gained First ClassHonours. David was called up soon after finishing his year at Oxford and after an initialcourse in Maidstone was scheduled to go for officer training. He duly passed out as asecond-lieutenant in the Royal Armoured Corps and went for further training beforereceiving a posting to the Far East. He went first to India, where he was fortunate tobe able to visit Agra and see the Taj Mahal and the Fort. After a time he was assignedas a tank commander to the Hodsonâs Horse Regiment which was based in Syriaand Lebanon at camps in places very much in the recent newsâHoms, Aleppo andDamascus. Later the regiment was to return to India, but before that David was ableto have a monthâs leave in England. During this leave he revisited Exeter and met BillKneale, then the philosophy tutor: David was already clear in his own mind that hisfuture lay in philosophy. However he had first to go back to his regiment, now in India,until a final return to England and demobilisation in 1946. Back in Oxford David worked on the second part of Greats, which lasted seventerms, so that he took his finals in December 1948, again being awarded a First. Ratherthan proceed to a B.Phil he accepted his tutorâs advice that he should take a second firstdegree in PPP, of which he would do the first two subjects, psychology and philosophy;this involved five further terms of study culminating in another set of finals and anotherFirst in 1950. David followed this with temporary posts at Corpus and Jesus beforetaking up a lectureship at Birkbeck College in the University of London, where hespent the rest of his academic career. He worked his way up the academic hierarchy,becoming in 1964 Professor of Philosophy and Head of the Philosophy Department atBirkbeck, posts which he held until his retirement in 1988. For five years during the eighties he simultaneously held the post of Head of Classicsat Birkbeck. He became a member of the University of London Senate in 1981 andVice-Master of Birkbeck College in 1983. Through the seventies he was also Chairmanof the Governors at Heythrop College, the specialist Philosophy and Theology Collegeof the University of London, and during 1985â6 he was Vice-Chairman of City Lit, thecentre for adult learning in London. His career as a philosopher was marked by many distinctions. From 1972 to 1984he was Editor of Mind, the leading British journal of philosophy. He was President ofthe Aristotelian Society from 1972 until 1978, Vice-President of the Royal Institute ofPhilosophy from 1991 to 1995, and Honorary Vice-President of the National Committeefor Philosophy from 1992 until 2003. He was also Consulting Editor of the Journal ofMedical Ethics throughout the eighties. 16\n\nP:18\n\nDavid always considered the teaching aspect of his job to be particularly important,but this did not prevent him from being a prolific contributor to the main philosophicaljournals, and the author of 12 books on different aspects of philosophy. His first book,published in 1957, was The Psychology of Perception; others included A History ofWestern Philosophy and In and Out of the Black Box which combined his knowledge andinterest in philosophy and psychology. He continued to be productive after retirement,publishing Being a Philosopher in 1992 and his last book, Understanding Perception,in 1996. Outside his academic interests David was throughout his life a passionate listenerto music, finding equal pleasure in mediÃ¦val plainchant, the classical symphonies ofBeethoven and Mahler, the avant-garde inventions of Stockhausen, and the jazz ofMiles Davis; and he was himself no mean performer on the keyboard. He was alsoa keen gardener. A kind, generous and considerate man, he was always ready to helpothers with their problems. He is survived by his wife Eileen, whom he met on his returnto Oxford when she was an undergraduate at St Hildaâs, and by their son, daughter, andgranddaughter. Philip Pettit David Blewitt (1935â2011)(We publish this appreciation of Dr David Blewitt (1955, Modern History), bypermission of The Stage.)David Blewitt, for many years The Stageâs chief opera critic, and a former honorarysecretary of the music section of the Criticsâ Circle, has died aged 76. David was born on March 20 1935 in India, where his father was an official inthe Indian police. He was educated at Stonyhurst, where he played cello in the schoolorchestra. He went on to study history at Exeter College, Oxford, where he acted instudent productions and received his degree in 1958. He began his wide-ranging careeras an English teacher at Eltham Green Comprehensive, where he used to recall a milkbottle being thrown at him on his first day. He continued his interest in acting duringthis period, taking part in a school production of Strindbergâs There are Crimes andCrimes. During the 1970s he became senior lecturer in drama at Bretton Hall Collegeof Education (now part of Leeds University), later moving onto Bristol University, andfinally Middlesex University. Following his retirement from lecturing, he was widelybusy with external examining. He undertook his own serious research while at Bristol,obtaining a doctorate in 1984 for his study of Tudor-period interludes, those shortdramatic and often musical pieces preceding or incorporated into larger stage-works,many of them written for child performers. His love and wide knowledge of film wasthen put to good use on the staff of the British Board of Film Classification, where heworked for a decade from 1984 to 1994. 17\n\nP:19\n\nMeanwhile, in the 1960s he had discovered Greece, where he taught English asa foreign language in Athens, and also met his future wife Aileen, who survives him.They eventually moved to Chania on the island of Crete, where they latterly built ahome and welcomed friends and relations from far and wide. He began writing for The Stage in 1979 and, succeeding Frank Granville-Barker,became its chief opera critic until his retirement in 2005. He was assiduous in attendingperformances by companies large and small all over the UK and sometimes furtherafield. His writing was sharp, informed and generous in tone, critical of anything he sawas sloppy or silly but full of praise for the ambitious or the excellent. Popular and widelyrespected within the critical profession, he was elected honorary secretary of the musicsection of Criticsâ Circle in 1998, remaining in post until 2000. In his retirement David continued to make occasional contributions to The Stage andto Opera magazine, to which he had also been a regular contributor since the mid-1990s.In one of them he brought to wide attention a forgotten gem of an opera house built as asmaller version of La Scala, Milan, on the Greek island of Skyros. His final reports for TheStage were from the Rossini Opera Festival in the composerâs birthplace of Pesaro in Italyin 2008âa favourite venue which he hoped to revisit in 2011, although in the event illnessprevented it. Throughout this difficult time he retained his positive outlook on life andsense of humour undimmedâhe invariably referred to one of his doctors as âThe FlyingDutchmanâ. But the illness would not go away, and eventually it took him away from uson December 31 2011, when he died peacefully in hospital on Crete. David was a delightful and much sought-after companion, warm, funny, articulateand gossipy. His breadth of knowledge might have been intimidating to those lessexperienced had it not been so lightly worn and generously shared. He could discoursefluently on all branches of theatre, including musicals and ballet, having spent so manyhours exploring and studying them. He enjoyed passing on his informed enthusiasm toyounger generations, though never with any sense of showing-off. All of this knowledge,together with his expertise in film, broadened the scope of his criticism. His sheer loveof theatre brought him into regular contact with performers in many genres and at alllevels. âGeorge, dear,â he said to me once, âif you feel like going to see The Lion King,just let me know. Iâve become very pally with one of the hyenas.â Opera was a long-term passion, his understanding of it based on decades of listeningto recordings and experiencing it live. Wide-ranging in his tastes, he encompassed it all,bringing to whatever he covered a sound understanding of vocal, musical and dramaticvalues and a keen ability to evaluate how bringing the different elements of the art-form together had worked in practical terms. He could be a strict critic, but he wasalways a fair one, and never lost his sense of humour. I remember sitting behind himat a particularly pretentious production of a Handel opera seria. After a dire first act,we reassembled for the second, which began with another sequence of bizarre physicalgestures. âOh dear! Oh no!â squealed David, before collapsing into giggles. Like all ofDavidâs criticism, his reaction was firmly founded in a combination of knowledge andtheatrical practicality, tempered by humour. He will be much missed.

After Exeter, where he read Modern History and graduated in 1961, he heldsuccessive administrative positions at the General Medical Council, the Royal Collegeof Art (then in the process of conversion to a university), the University of Bradford (aCollege of Advanced Technology which had newly made the conversion), Queen MaryCollege in the University of London, Trinity College of Music, and the Central Office ofInformation. Wherever he was, he both joined and encouraged music making, and cameto be esteemed by professional musicians. Married in 1980 to a fellow musician, heretired with her to Wadhurst in 1999.

We reproduce below, with permission, an abridged version of the appreciation ofhis life during retirement that appeared in the Kent and Sussex Courier in September2011.âA popular musician who helped entertain hundreds of people in Wadhurst has diedafter a three-month battle with cancer. More than 300 people, including the mayorand five visitors from Aubers in France, attended a memorial service to honour andremember Howard Spurr. Mr Spurr, 72, of Sparrows Green Road, gave concerts in oldpeopleâs homes, village clubs and societies, along with his wife Jane. Two years agothey were joined by their friend Michael Harte, calling themselves Oddsox because MrsSpurr always wore odd socks. Mr Spurr also volunteered for the Wadhurst Social ActionProject, giving residents lifts to the surgery, to visit relatives in hospital, to the shops orto churchâ¦. He was an active member of the twinning association. A founder committeemember, he enjoyed numerous visits to Aubers and hosted some of the Aubersois at hishomeâ¦. He joined the menâs Probus Club very soon after arriving in Wadhurst and hismembership of that organisation was a source of many more new friends. Mr Spurr found numerous outlets for his musical talents. He was always willing tojoin the parish church choir when needed, and when it was expanded to provide anthemsfor important times in the Christian calendar. He also joined the Mayfield Church Choirand the Mayfield Festival Chorusâboth of which provided not only musical experiencebut also made him many new friendsâ¦. Michael Harte, who read the eulogy at hismemorial, said: ââ¦. When we formed our trio, Oddsox, Jane found a piece of musicfor our signature tuneâa little Victorian ditty called Tenor and Baritone. In it, Howard,the baritone, sang these words: âHis many occupations are almost beyond belief and hismight is so tremendous he can call the world his ownâ. For me, that sums up Howardin a single phraseâ.â Â© Kent and Sussex Courier 19\n\nP:21\n\nIan Reid Professor Ian Reid enjoying ornithology in his free timeStaying ahead of competition is not an alien concept in academia, but even the keyevents, such as elections to a Nobel Prize, rarely hit the news the way commercialtakeovers, banks collapsing or military interventions to bring down not-too-friendlydictators are reported. Staying ahead of competition has always been the way of life forProfessor Ian Reid and his research team, as the applications for results of their researchhave spawned like mushrooms during wet Indian summers. Who would have thoughtthat the next move Ian was going to make would give him yet another advantage overcompetition, which will propel him ahead of everyone, on this occasion in time, bysimply moving nine and a half time-zones east-wise, back to his native Australia? It willprobably remain a mystery what exactly tipped the balance on his âdecisions scalesâ:was it âseeding the knowledgeâ, âconquering new marketsâ or the âdamn-good qualityof lifeâ Down Under? Ian came to Queenâs College, Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship in the late 1980s, aftercompleting his first degree in Computer Science, to undertake post-graduate researchtowards a DPhil. Just glancing at his photo from the days of his energetic postgraduateyouth, with academic and sports-spirit sparks in his eyes (also showing clear signs ofsleep deprivation, so typical for the highly competitive academic world), speaks thosethousand words with which every picture enriches the surrounding text. One does notneed to know much about academia in general, or Oxford in particular, to realise that thequality of Ianâs research and his personality must have been outstanding when straightafter completing his DPhil he became a post-doctoral research assistant in the sameresearch group, Stipendiary Lecturer in more than one Oxford college and, shortlyafterwards, a University Lecturer in the very same Department of Engineering Sciencewhich awarded him his DPhil. Only truly excellent and indispensable individuals havesuch biographies buried in their CVs. It was no surprise to his colleagues when in duecourse he was awarded the title of Professor in 2011. 20\n\nP:22\n\nMeanwhile the Robotics Research Group had exploded into several highlysuccessful activities with their own sub-grouping organisation, jointly the cause ofestablishing not just the ânotionâ but the true âfieldâ of Information Engineering asone of the core disciplines currently taught and researched within the Departmentof Engineering Science and across related disciplines in several other departmentsand faculties in the University. Ian and his long-standing colleague and collaboratorProfessor David Murray (Fellow of St Anneâs) are the key innovators and motivatorsin the field, and just a quick browse of their groupâs web pages (www.robots.ox.ac.uk)reveals the multiplicity of impacts their research has made upon the world in which welive today. So it should be no surprise that Exeter College chose Ian as successor when AndrewBlake was âpoachedâ by the software giant Microsoft at the turn of the century to headone of the research teams at their facilities associated with another reasonably wellknown university, a couple of hours drive east from Oxford. By that time, in 2000,Exeter had been without an Official Fellow in Engineering for a year, which had animmediate effect upon the students. Consequently, Ianâs first challenge was to reverse thenegative trend, whilst the College was working at the same time on engaging a secondEngineering Fellow; the IT and computing aspects of operations here also needed to bestreamlined and strategically directed into the 21st century. Those who are familiar withthe lecturing and research pressures on a new University Lecturerâs position in the firstfive years of appointment will know how to rate Ian when realising that he publishedequally, if not more, during those early years, despite the added administrative andlecturing burden of his new College post. In for a penny, in for a pound, he also gotmarried, quickly adding two lovely daughters to the list of those known as the Reids onCumnor Hill. Ian did look a bit tired when I joined him as the other Official Fellow in EngineeringScience in autumn of 2003. Even though I had five years of lecturing experience bythen, it is not until now that I have realisedâwell, rationallyâhow much easier it wasfor me to work alongside Ian than it would have been without him. I had to check a fewof the photos we took over the years to find out if those bags under his eyes did indeedget smaller after he could share some of his College workload with me. I shall alwaysremember some of the tasks we executed together, such as interviewing candidatesduring undergraduate admissions; and the fun we were able to have through refusingto see those tasks as no more than serious, responsible and mind-draining duties. Isincerely believe that those of you reading these lines who have been subjected to ourâinterview procedureâ will remember its moments as a sort of initiation to Exonianismof Engineering kind, both with capital âEâ. This appreciation would not be complete without mentioning birding. Or is ittwitching?âprobably the latter, which is used as a superlative in the âbusinessâ, thoughperhaps invented by fed-up angry wives or friends and neighbours and happy postmenand milkmen, jealous of the freedom, albeit only temporary, achieved by twitchersduring their escapades. It is worth checking some of Ianâs on line galleries (www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~ian/Birding/index.html), bearing in mind that he says that âtaking photos of 21\n\nP:23\n\nbirds is second best to just watching them and simply storing those experiences deep inyour own memory.â Whenever Ian decides to organise his own conference on computervision, it will probably be located and timed at a place where some rare birds stopbriefly in passing, leaving behind people with deep memories of the good times theyspent together. Nik Petrinic Holger WendlandProfessor Holger Wendland left Exeter College, Oxford and England in December 2011to take up the Chair of Applied and Numerical Analysis at the University of Bayreuth inGermany. The research required by this new position comprises modelling and analysisof problems coming from Engineering, Physical and Life Sciences and Finance. Thisalready speaks about the wide spectrum of competence that Professor Wendland hasas a researcher. The fact that he was offered this position also reflects the recognitionthat he enjoys within the community, as does the fact that he is by now editor of twojournals. Professor Wendland took up a position as Professor of Numerical Analysis andFellow of Exeter College in October 2009. His academic record (PhD, with mentionsumma cum laude, and Habilitation in Mathematics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen,whose mathematical school is one of the most prestigious and with long tradition inGermany; work as a consultant in Software Development for MSC Software, positionsheld at several prestigious universities in Germany, USA and England) marked him outalready as an outstanding mathematician. For the seven academic terms during which he was here, our students had the benefitof a tutor with knowledge and insight going far beyond the syllabus, author of threebooks, lecturer for some of the key courses in Numerical Analysis in the MathematicsDepartment, and a researcher fully aware of where the boundaries of current researchlie. During his stay in Oxford he was still on the steep slope of learning of the Oxfordsystem (a slope which in Mathematics is even steeper), therefore he had not arrived yetat the point where he could get involved more into College life, and thus become betterknown to the College community at large. As his colleagues in Mathematics, Dr Qianand I got to know him better, and to discover in him not only a distinguished researcher,but also an open, cheerful and honest human being. It has been a pleasure to have himas a colleague and as a tutor in our College, and one can only wish him a lot of successin his new position. Cornelia DruÅ£u 22\n\nP:24\n\nJoan HimpsonThis year saw the retirement of Joan Himpson, who had been ourAcademicAdministratorfor nearly 12 years since she joined the College in September 2000. Joan had workedin the University since 1989, initially for the Computing Laboratory and later for theInstitute of Biological Anthropology. In her years at Exeter, she devoted an enormousamount of time and energy to the College and its students, dealing very effectively witheverything thrown at her, and gaining an impressive reputation for her encyclopÃ¦dicknowledge of âhow the College workedâ. Since her retirement, Joan has been fully occupied with her other role as an accreditedtable official for the National Basketball Association. For several weeks over the LongVacation of 2012 she was deployed as a specialist basketball volunteer Games Maker on theTechnical Officials team at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London, a demandingrole that she earned through a rigorous selection process and extensive training. After her Olympic commitments Joan will be enjoying a well-deserved rest by herswimming pool in south-west France. But we are sure that she will soon have dedicatedherself to another interesting project, and we fondly wish her all the very best for a long,healthy, and happy retirement. In bidding farewell to Joan, the College welcomes Emily Eastham, the Collegeâsnew Academic Registrar, who took over from Joan in July 2012. Kate Cramp The ChapelâTruly speaking, it is not instruction, but provocation, that I can receive from anothersoul,â said Ralph Waldo Emerson in his incendiary address to the leaving class ofHarvard Divinity School in 1838. Staking his position against the mere imbibing ofreceived truths, and seeking truth rather in the very act of discovery, of encounter withother minds, he provides a fitting motto for life in Exeter College Chapel. Here we havemaintained very well a strong tradition of Chapel as a place not of easy answers but ofquestions, of exploration, challenge and encounter; as well of course as peace, beautyand rest in the busyness of term. Our preachers in Chapel have reflected this, with a range of speakers engaged inthe intersection of faith, politics and protest. Amongst many others, we heard fromSimon Morris, the parish priest from Tottenham whose church played a crucial role inmaintaining the bonds of community during the riots, opening its doors to all in need, aswell as from Catherine Pepinster, editor of The Tablet, Susannah Cornwall, a theologianfamous for her provocative and important work on intersex, and government ministerStephen (Lord) Green, who treated us to an extremely thought provoking analysis ofthe current economic situation in the context of philosophical and theological themesof history and salvation. We finished the year by welcoming back to Exeter, as ourpreacher for Commemoration of Benefactors, Professor Graham Ward, Chaplain from 23\n\nP:25\n\n1992 to 1995, whose fabulous sermon demonstrated how deserved is his election to theRegius Chair of Divinity from October 2012. It is a great pleasure to have ProfessorWard back in the Exonian fold! If Chapel life has any value, it is in turning the minds of those who come to theneeds of the world beyond the walls of College, enabling us to develop our ownengagement in the myriad struggles for human freedom. One of the great pleasuresof my first year as Chaplain has been seeing students impassioned by issues of socialjustice and equality. The Chapel has supported charitable efforts both close to home andfar abroad: Helen & Douglas House, The Oxford Sexual Abuse & Rape Crisis Centre,Medic Malawi, and the Teenage Cancer Trust. I hope that Chapel life, in common withall our endeavours at Exeter, encourages us to action, as well as generous support, inworking for the establishing of justice, mercy and peace. The music in Chapel has been full of flair and character, with senior Organ ScholarJoshua Hales confident and inspiring in front of the singers, drawing subtle andthoughtful performances from our justly famous choir. George de Voil joined us asjunior Organ Scholar, and has proved to be an extremely able musician. In MichaelmasTerm 2011 we welcomed a large cohort of new singers, and by Christmas the new teamwere working well together, and treated us to sublime singing for our carol services.A starkly moving Passiontide service rounded off Hilary Term, with the choir singingnot only with great commitment and passion, but also with tremendous sensitivity tothe drama of the liturgy. After the trials of examinations, the choir enjoyed work of adifferent kind on their tour to Catalonia this summer, where they sang to great acclaimin the gorgeous hill town of St Marti dâEmpuries, Barcelona Cathedral, Calbato, and theMonastery of Montserrat. The Hilary Term Turl Street Arts Festival saw the Chapel filled all week with sacredand profane music, under the magnificent direction of the festival president, NaomiCharatan. The week culminated in a stunning performance of Mozartâs great Mass in Cminor, and a full to bursting joint evensong. There we were treated to a sermon as funnyas it was provocative by Richard Coles, known to many as one half of 1980s high NRG,communist electro-pop band The Communards, and now enjoying a more stately careeras a clergyman and Radio Four presenter. It was with great sadness that we said goodbye at the end of the year to Joshua Hales,whose musicianship has been a joy for us all. His performance of 19th and 20th centuryFrench organ music was especially mature and fluid, and perfectly suited to our pasticheFrench instrument from which he drew the full extent of its colour and personality. Hetakes up the organ scholarship at Salisbury Cathedral in October. Also leaving us fromthe choir are Lizzie Ellen, Rhian Wood, Myriam Frenkel, Hannah Dickens and ThorstenHauler. Lindsey Graham and Sandra Shedd return to Williams College having beenmuch valued members of the choir. Austin Yim and Mark Gilbert also leave us, havingserved faithfully as Chapel Clerks. To these, and to all whose generosity, hard workand commitment have made the Chapel a place of openness, liberal enquiry, peace andsustenance, I am extremely grateful.

In 2012, as in previous years, the Library has faced challenges. Earlier in the summerlibrary staff and students rushed to remove as many books as they could from the Lawsection as a monsoon-like downpour penetrated the walls; and sadly this was also theyear that Alex the rat man agreed that he had better come out every week. In short, ashas been acknowledged for some time, the Library is in need of radical refurbishmentinside and out. Conditions have to be improved for readers and books, not least forExeterâs special collections of rare books and manuscripts which are in urgent need ofbetter storage and conservation. If our plans for Walton Street evolve as we hope they will, the new site will includeproper facilities for the historic collection. We would like to move the Libraryâs earlyprinted books and manuscripts together with the College Archive to the basement ofthe new building at Walton Street. That would provide an opportunity to plan excellentstorage and reading room conditions for this material right from the start. We wouldthen be able to shelve 30,000 early books and over 100 manuscripts, as well as the entirehistoric College Archive, on rolling racking in environmentally controlled conditions.We would be able at last to sort, catalogue and correctly store the College collectionof photographs, dating back to the 19th century. And we could create, next door to thesecure book stacks, a reading room for up to four researchers at a time. We also planexhibition areas at Walton Street where we would hope to display some of the Libraryâsmany treasures such as the Bohun Psalter and Petrarchâs copy of Suetonius, as well asgems from the Archive. In addition fundraising has also begun for much-needed work on the 19th centurylibrary building on the main College site. Externally, the stonework and the windowswill be restored. Internally the lighting and heating, IT facilities and furniture will beimproved and there will be a room for scanning and printing. The Library will expandfrom its present three reading rooms to four or five separate areas providing over ahundred reader seats. For the first time readers will be offered a mixture of single andcollaborative spaces to study there. As the renovation plans progress, the Library continues at the heart of the academiclife of the College. It remains open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and this generousaccess is much appreciated by students who also value their library as a congenial, if attimes cramped, place to study. This last year a good deal of housekeeping has taken place. The Library hasbeen deep-cleaned and a stock check of all books on the open shelves will have beencompleted before Michaelmas Term. Weeding of damaged and outdated stock has 25\n\nP:27\n\nstarted. The system of book ordering has been improved with many books now arrivingalready labelled and jacketed by Blackwellâs, and an improved form for students torequest new library books has been put on the internal College website. The numberof library and archive staff has increased as we have welcomed Penny Baker to thepost of College Archivist, and Alex Kampakoglou, Therese Feiler, Caterina Franchi andEleanor Franzen as part-time library assistants. The Library has had many visiting scholars during the year but it was particularlygratifying that some of the junior members of the College also became aware of ourremarkable collection of rare books and manuscripts. So it was that an English Literatureundergraduate had the undoubted thrill of sitting down in Exeterâs Library to read themanuscript of Audenâs play The Chase. âCool!â he remarked, âHow amazing we havethese thingsâ. Joanna Bowring The Third QuadrangleReaders of the Register will remember with clarity and affection the inviting andendlessly sociable open spaces at Exeterâthe Front Quadrangle and the FellowsâGarden. They define the College in many respects, but they come at the cost of lessbuilding and therefore fewer rooms in which to live and teach. It is a great credit to ourforebears, their architects and stonemasons, that we continue to occupy their buildings,happily so, and even with the hidden intrusion of electricity and wi-fi. But there arelimits to how far we can push 400-year-old listed buildings, and no less than three of theCollegeâs main teaching rooms are underground with little or no natural light. It was these considerations and the impetus to have more undergraduates livingclose to the College and the libraries and laboratories of the University that persuadedthe Governing Body to purchase the Ruskin College site on Walton Street in 2009.The vision for its regeneration was defined by the designation of Walton Street asthe Collegeâs Third Quadrangle, by which we intend that it will be an integral partof the College, not an annexe, combining residential and social accommodation forundergraduates with Fellowsâ teaching sets, seminar rooms flooded with light andbristling with relevant technology, communal study space which combines the bestqualities of the library and the coffee house, and an auditorium to enable actors, dancers,musicians and orators to flourish. The College ran an architectural competition last year, informed by a detailedstrategic brief and technical assessment of the site, to find an architect to regenerate thesite. Our choice was Alison Brooks who, more than any other competitor, demonstrateda deep sensitivity to the identity and aspirations of the College, and great insight intounlocking the potential of a difficult long, narrow plot. 26\n\nP:28\n\n27 Architectâs design concept of the Walton Street premises from Worcester Place, looking east\n\nP:29\n\nMs Brooksâs serpentine floor-plan opens up the circulation of the site, giving ita southern mini-quadrangle bounded by an elegant arcaded walk-way leading froma spacious entrance hall, past the principal seminar rooms and into the LearningCommons, which is the social and working heart of the campus. A second arcadeleads from the Learning Commons to a second mini-quadrangle, at the western end ofwhich sits the Auditorium. The Learning Commons is a sinuous combination of broadstaircases, expansive floors and hidden corners transcending two levels, with a cafÃ© atthe lower ground level and a student common room beyond. Our intention is that theThird Quadrangle should be a place for all members of College to go, not just those wholive or teach there. The current plan is also to incorporate a purpose-built rare book andarchive room in the basement to ensure that the Collegeâs special collections and uniquetreasures survive in the best possible condition and that scholars can consult them in asecure reading room. On the upper floors a hundred study-bedrooms will give undergraduates anabundance of natural light and ventilation, and views into the gardens of WorcesterCollege or across Jericho to the Radcliffe Observatory which now marks the newepicentre for Mathematics, the Blavatnik School of Government and the HumanitiesDivision. Large recreational kitchens have been incorporated on each floorâan amenityidentified by current students involved in the planning. Fellowsâ teaching sets willalleviate the press on rooms at the main College site and will provide memorable venuesequal to the 17th century splendour of Staircase 4 for those bleak February afternoontutorials. Exeter took vacant possession of the site on 1 October 2012 and the current projectplan envisages construction beginning in the Autumn of 2013, subject to planningconsent and having sufficient funding to complete the construction. Through the greatgenerosity of Old Members and friends, just over Â£10 million has been pledged. Furtherfunding is expected from the sale of Stapeldon House on the Iffley Road. There is asteep funding hill yet to climb before the College can begin construction but such is theshared enthusiasm for this significant celebration of 700 years of teaching and learningat Exeter that we believe former students and friends will make the project possible. Ifthe funding is in place to commence demolition and construction as soon as planningconsent is received, the buildings should be complete by September 2015, in time forthe new academic year. This would echo Exeterâs early years; the College outgrew itsfirst siteâHart Hallâin its first year and moved to the present Turl Street site in 1315.What better celebration could we have than to repeat this pattern 700 years later? A tantalising image of the Alison Brooks vision from the competition submissionis reproduced on p.27. The detailed design has advanced considerably from thecompetition scheme, but remains entirely faithful to the original vision. Once the publicconsultation is underwayâan essential part of the pre-planning application processâthe College will be able to provide access to drawings and images of the proposedbuilding on its website. William Jensen 28\n\nP:30\n\nComputing Systems at ExeterAn article on the topic of computing may not immediately capture the imagination ofmost readers, but within the vibrant and varied mix of cultures found at Exeter Collegeone will find a complexâoften unseenâworld. Unlike most of the departments in College, the Computing Department largelyprovides and develops services which help support the day-to-day work of otherCollege members. Students, Fellows and different offices within the Collegeeach expect a world-class computing experience to help them achieve excellence.Correspondingly, there are all manner of systems to meet, and hopefully exceed, thoseexpectations. Working closely with so many different groups gives the Computing team a uniqueinsight into trends in activities across the whole College. Observing this over the sevenyears Iâve worked at Exeter is a privilege, providing an insight into the enthusiasm andvigour present throughout the College. Particularly in the last few months, the digitalworld is for the first time being embraced throughout almost every aspect of Collegeoperations; an exciting time. To most people passing through the Turl Street or Exeter House gates, the oneservice they expect will be a connection to âthe internetâ. Be it for students, residents,staff or conference guests, College effectively acts as an Internet Service Provider (ISP)for around 2,000 connections per year, spread throughout our 45 discrete buildings ontwo sites. This type of service is heavily legislated1 and there are complicated recordkeeping and administrative procedures in place, hopefully resulting in quick and easyconnections for all. An aspect often lamented by those working in modern computing isthat as much as you equip and enable people, there is increasingly an imposed duty torestrict and govern. Itâs often the latter of these which consumes the most time and gainsattention, whereas the former is usually what attracted you to the work. Although we donât inspect the internet activities of individuals on the Collegenetwork, we do look at the trends in behaviour of the community as a whole. Forthe 2011â12 academic year around 65,000,000 MB of information was downloaded.Although the vast majority of this will have been the residentsâ recreational use(television programmes and similar), this is a fantastic amount of information. As anapproximate comparison, 1,000 MB could store the entire text contained within theaverage public library. Compared to most commercial organisations with a similar turnover of aroundÂ£7m,2 Exeterâs office computing requirements are complex. For example, due to thedifferent departments, no more than eight College staff ever work on similar tasks andthis variety of activity means high levels of customisation of systems for each officeare needed, whereas for the students and Fellows, who tend to work in similar ways,uniformity keeps things relatively simple, despite their higher numbers.1â Data Retention (EC Directive) Regulations 2009; Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000; Privacy and ElectronicCommunications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.

Several of these are âEnterprise Gradeâ and each would normallybe the core of a whole business. Iâm extremely grateful for the support and skills of mycolleagues, Mark Phillips and Carl Parker, in keeping everything running and on line,with a charity-sized budget, in an environment which literally never sleeps. People often ask how we like working with âcomputersâ. This question itselfperhaps best illustrates the current pace of change, as there really is no such thing as aâcomputerâ any more. College, and indeed wider society, is in the midst of a sea-change,with a flood of small affordable devices delivering information and entertainment atevery turn. When I joined the Exeter team in 2005, the College was surprised that around70% of the students brought a computer with them. In 2012, the average is now overtwo devices for each person and we expect as soon as 2015 to be connecting aroundfive devices for every student. With residents bringing more and more technology,you might expect demand for College-provided âworkstationsâ to diminish, but in factdemand is increasing, as students purchase small, compact devices for recreational andcommunication use and look towards the Collegeâs computing resources for seriousstudy and research. Ease of access to information is at the heart of an ongoing debate about the relevanceof some educational learning processes, and therefore what skill-sets to equip todayâsstudents with. For some time now, a challenge in modern life has been not to try toremember all you come across, but the very opposite: to filter out the vast majorityof information and commit to memory only that deemed worthy. Here, of course, iswhere the experience and wisdom imparted by the Oxford tutorial system helps to refinethe judgement of students: to teach the importance of values and rigorous independentmethods over and above verbatim recollection of fact or protocol. Related to this, exposure to these âalways onâ personal information systemsis, I believe, creating a mainstream culture of reliance on them. I often find myselfillustrating this by drawing a comparison with the electric light or the motor car: initiallyexpensive curiosities with many alternatives, but ultimately society itself becomesutterly dependent on them. The vast majority of people in the world currently own amobile telephone,4 far more than own a toothbrush, and the silicon chip design firmARM, whose chips are used in most portable devices, currently licences the productionof 25,000,000 new processors per day. Although the UK as a whole is tumbling downthe digital league tables, our College still holds its own: over the past seven years themain site has been without running water for longer than it has been without its maininternet connection. How the worldwide cultural changes are embracedâor rejectedâby Oxford willbe both fascinating and ultimately important for the standing of the institution in years tocome. Educationally, method changes are certainly afoot, with more and more materialbeing authored for consumption in the digital domainâno longer merely creating3â Systems to manage: accounts, student records, fundraising, libraries, property management, artwork and inventory, roombooking, CCTV, door entry, cashless payments and server systems, to name but a few.4âhttp://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/ 30\n\nP:32\n\nelectronic facsimiles of the output of a 16th century press, but instead embracing themedium for creation, consumption and feedback. Within College, the studentâs rateof uptake of the practical tools when made available is phenomenal; the majority aretold of their exam results via their mobile telephone or MP3 player5. How tutorial andteaching tools will be developed remains to be seen but I am confident that the currentgeneration will quickly embrace any advantage they can obtain. The various administrations within the University and colleges are changing too.In the corporate world the seat of âChief Information Officerâ, and increasingly alsoâChief Digital Officerâ, have become well established in many boardrooms, allowingcomputing to contribute powerfully towards strategic decisions. At the University levelweâre currently seeing the reorganisation of the central business services and computinggroups into one larger organisation6. The colleges themselves are beginning to evolvesimilarly, with several sharing IT Managers or creating senior ICT Director positions.Increasingly, these people are empowered and mandated to use computing andtechnology to deliver high-level college aims, such as attracting students and promotingacademic excellence. As Exeter moves towards its 700th anniversary celebrations there are robust plansfor the future: continuing development within the organisation, Exeter House completed,a third quad at the Walton Street site. Several of these projects have plans which detailthe likely activities through coming decades. Looking any further than perhaps fiveyears ahead, experience shows we cannot accurately predict the way computing willfit into the evolution of how the College teaches, learns and lives. I am confident,however, that computing will be there; increasingly expected, increasingly embedded,and increasingly essential. Simon Mortimore A Senior Exonian Looks Back(This is an excerpt from Captain Pollardâs unpublished autobiography, abridged withhis permission. He was at Exeter between 1958 and 1961.)Oxford was just a dream when I left school in 1932, a dream which was unlikely everto be realised. Before the Second World War you could go to Oxford provided youcould pay and many did, while public schoolboys benefited from close scholarshipswithout examination. When the War ended, despite several near misses, I was stillunmarried and 31. I also remembered how Bill Witts, my English master at Hereford,had maintained that everything about War was not necessarily bad since had it notbeen for the previous war he would never have gone to Oxford. So I applied to Balliolto do classical research backed by my old friend Jackson Knight, who had recently5âhttp://m.ox.ac.uk/6â OUCS, ICTST and BSP combining into ICCP: www.iccp.ox.ac.uk 31\n\nP:33\n\nbeen appointed a Reader. But this aim proved too high and I was on the point of givingup when I decided to try Exeter. I had actually approached the west-country collegeback in 1931, inquiring about scholarships. So here I was, 15 years later, boldly tryingagain. To my delight the College accepted me after a serious hiccup about the dateof my release from the Army. The Rector Eric Barber was kindness itself, despitesome misgivings concerning my age. He was also a little worried about an outsiderdoing research, who would have done better to opt for Classical Greats. But I had hadenough of written examinations and had become far more interested in Greek religionand myth than in history and philosophy. Oxbridge, by all accounts, is becoming aresearch institution. This was far from the case when I went up. Few scholars botheredto take research degrees, since oneâs place in the class list was all that counted. Theupshot was that it was hard to obtain advice and when I called on Hugh Last, theCamden Professor of Ancient History at BNC, he told me, irrelevantly, that he didnâtthink Julius Caesarâs desire to become Pontifex Maximus was entirely political butadvised me strongly to âkeep off livahsâ. In the end I was handed over to the IrishmanDodds, who was the Regius Professor of Greek with an interest in religion. Of Doddsâscholarship there could be no two opinions and I attended his lectures on the Greekdramatists delivered in the Old Lecture Room at the House. The January of 1946 was cruelly cold and when I retired to bed on the first nightI all but froze since no-one had warned the scout of my arrival and as a consequence Ihad no blankets. This was put to rights the following day, though I still had to get usedto ice on the washing bowl and a poorly gas-heated study. Still this was Oxford and thelife I had chosen so I was prepared to make the most of it. The pre-War syndrome ofbreakfast in bed had long since ended. Now after your scout had delivered a can of hotwater it was up to you to shave and scuttle downstairs. All meals were served in the Halland prepared in the adjacent buttery. At dinner in Hall the dons sat at high table, whilepostgraduate MAs occupied the end of a bench below. Though I was only a LondonMA, Tom Beasley, the senior scout, kindly placed me alongside the MAs. They, like me,were all ex-service so we had much in common. Of the dons my moral tutor Dacre Balsdon was by far the most noteworthy. Wehad much in common, apart from being Classicists, in as much as he was a Devonianand had attended Exeter School. He had a wry sense of humour, but was kindnessitself. His sense of the ridiculous was perhaps best exemplified when I took my degreeand arrived in the quad in the elaborate lace gown of a Bachelor of Letters completewith a blue silk hood ribbed with fur. âOh I say!â he exclaimed, smiling broadly as Istood self-consciously smiling back. I was very fond of Dacre and when he came tostay some years later it was his first visit to Wales. I also used to call on old âDawksâ[R.M. Dawkins, Fellow of Exeter 1922â39, Professor of Byzantine and Modern Greek1920â39, died 1955] who was always good for a fund of scandalous tales anent his pastcolleagues. Although I was past 30 I was no exception since the Varsity hooker was 35. SoI trained and got into the College rugby XV and had the satisfaction of scoring a tryagainst Keble in âCuppersâ. In cricket our successes were few though we managed tobeat Hertford who included Derek Bridge, the rugby blue who had also represented 32\n\nP:34\n\nthe Varsity at cricket. We came close to beating Magdalen, had it not been for the soloeffort of the captain who later became my brother-in-law. But when we travelled toCambridge to face our rivals Emmanuel College we were clearly out of our class. Inaddition to rugger and cricket, the only two sports which really counted, I also involvedmyself in boxing. Having suffered a serious wound to my nose while playing for theExeter club I decided that I would be foolish to box myself, although in retrospect I wishI had. It wasnât very difficult to get a boxing blue provided you were either small or big.But most fell like me into the middle or welter-weight category where the oppositionwas always strong. Instead I virtually ran the club in conjunction with a pleasant youngAustralian law don from Worcester named Alan Brown who was Senior Treasurer. From what I have just said it might well appear that I gave little time to workor lectures. Nothing could have been further from the truth since I made a point ofattending most of the important lectures given in the Classical Moderations course,as well as a number of those given for Greats. Few, however, had much bearing onmy specialist studies in Greek religion and myth so I spent most of my time in theAshmolean Museum where I became closely involved in archÃ¦ology, in fact so much sothat in my second year Dodds handed me over to Tom Dunbabin, a youngish Australianwho had won a DSO in Crete. Dunbabin was a man of action rather than words, but itwas entirely through him that I learned not to take anything on trust, but always to checkarchÃ¦ological references. The winter of 1947 was unparalleled for severity. Undergraduates could be seenhuddling round the fire in the Hall while I sought refuge in the warmth of the Ashmolean.The cold struck late in January while I was watching the rugby trials, and continuedwith several false springs right into March. Britain was buried deep in snow and when Iill-advisedly attempted to reach Cambridge by road in order to watch the boxing the buswas stopped by a drift of monstrous size somewhere near Bedford. Curiously enoughwhen the summer came everything turned brown and we basked in a heat wave. In order to be fair the Rector only permitted undergraduates to reside in Collegefor a limited number of terms. At the end you were required to look for digs which inpost-war Oxford was far from easy.
