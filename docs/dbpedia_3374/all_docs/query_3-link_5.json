        "text": "A 13-man squad headed for its capital Tallinn where MCC is playing a series of fixtures against various opposition.\n\nThe squad is made up of MCC Playing Members who represent the Club in fixtures across the UK over the course of the summer.\n\nRupert Kitzinger, formerly of the Dorset National Counties team, will captain the side, and Alex Harris is the Tour Manager for the trip.\n\nAll the matches on the tour will take place at the Estonia National Cricket and Rugby Field in Tallinn, which has two pitches and are the only permanent full-sized grounds in the country.\n\nThe Club will open the tour with two T20 fixtures against the Tallinn Hippos. The Hippos are a side that were formed in 2018 and have enjoyed success in the Estonian men’s domestic competitions in recent seasons.\n\nThe following day will see MCC face the Estonian national team in two T20 matches. Estonia was awarded T20 International status by the ICC in 2018 and its men’s side are currently placed at 72nd in the world rankings.\n\nEstonia hit the headlines recently during their tour of Cyprus when batter Sahil Chauhan hit the fastest ever T20I century, scoring a ton from 27 balls and breaking the record held by Chris Gayle of the West Indies. Chauhan finished unbeaten on 144 from 41 balls, including 18 sixes, which is also a T20I record.\n\nThe Tallinn Stallions will be the next opposition for MCC, another side who play in the Estonian domestic structure, before a 40-over match against NATO, a team comprised from the Forward Land Forces Battlegroup (Estonia).\n\nThe squad will then move into a more competitive environment as they take part in the Baltic Cup, with three T20s taking place over the second weekend of the tour. The tournament was relaunched in 2020 after a gap of several years, and this time will see national teams from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania competing. The tournament represents a rare occasion for the latter two countries to experience competitive cricket.\n\nWith the focus of any MCC overseas tour to assist with the development of cricket in the country, the squad will hold a coaching clinic with the Estonian women’s team, who also recently enjoyed a T20I tour of Cyprus and sit 71st in the ICC rankings.\n\nA 13-man squad departed Lord’s for Amsterdam, where MCC are playing a series of fixtures against strong opposition.\n\nThe squad is made of MCC Playing Members who play across the country in various ECB Premier Divisions, the highest standard of club cricket in England and Wales.\n\nOliver Haley, who plays for East Molesey in the Surrey Premier League and has previously played in the Home Counties and Birmingham Premier Leagues, will captain the side.\n\nTour Manager is Phil Nicholson, of Washington in the North East Premier League and formerly of Northumberland CCC.\n\nThe Club will face CTC De Flamingos in three separate T20 matches across the week. De Flamingos are one of the oldest clubs in the Netherlands, having been formed back in 1921.\n\nThey have faced MCC at several venues over the years and played the Club at Lord’s in 2022, losing by 90 runs.\n\nNetherlands ‘A’ are MCC’s opponents in two 50-over matches, and with the country currently sitting 14th in the ICC One-Day International rankings, the ‘A’ squad will provide a stern test.\n\nThere will be two venues used for the tour. The VRA Ground in Amstelveen is the most famous ground in the Netherlands, having hosted a match in the 1999 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup and it was the venue for three ODIs against England in 2022.\n\nVoorburg Cricket Club, situated in The Hague, will also play host to MCC and is another ground in the Netherlands which has hosted ODI cricket.\n\nIn the final trip of the 2023 MCC Overseas Touring Programme, a squad of players departed Lord’s for Kenya for a two-week men’s tour of the African country.\n\nA strong squad of 13 players, plus a Tour Manager and Umpire, travelled to Nairobi as the Club began its longest tour of the year, which comprises of eight matches. Previous overseas tours in 2023 have seen men’s squads travel to Belize, Austria and Greece, and a women’s squad to Germany.\n\nThis will be the strongest men’s squad that the Club has toured with this year, with several current and former first-class players included for MCC’s first trip to Kenya since 2018, having previously not toured there since 1999.\n\nThe squad will be captained by former Kent and Leicestershire all-rounder Darren Stevens and led by Tour Manager Arfan Akram, who sits on the MCC Committee and served on the Players & Fixtures sub-committee between 2013 and 2016, having played over 100 games for the Club.\n\nStevens can boast over 16,500 first-class runs and nearly 600 first-class wickets in a decorated career spanning more than 25 years.\n\nHe is joined by two former Kent teammates – Marcus O’Riordan, a batter who featured in the LV= County Championship and Metro Bank One-Day Cup this year, and Adam Ball, a former England Under-19s left-armer.\n\nCurrent Derbyshire and former Hampshire batter Harry Came, who averaged 43.43 across 11 matches in this year’s County Championship, boosts the first-class experience, with the remainder of the squad consisting of players who have regularly played county second eleven, National Counties and ECB Premier League cricket.\n\nIn the eight games that MCC will play across the fortnight, the formats will vary between 20, 30 and 50-over matches. The action will begin in Nairobi, and move north to Nakuru, before a coastal trip to Mombasa is bookended by further matches in the capital.\n\nComprising of 15 players, the squad played six matches in Nepal against a variety of opposition and led on several coaching sessions both for local children and coaches themselves in Pokhara.\n\nThese sessions were run in conjunction the MCC Foundation (MCCF) – who have been working to deliver cricket to young people in Nepal since 2019, Cricket Without Boundaries (CWB) and the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN).\n\nThe non-playing elements of the tour began with the running of an education session in which coaches were taught how to run engaging sessions and use coaching tools such as the use of questions, silence, praise, individual and group feedback.\n\nA gender sensitisation workshop took place where the barriers which women and girls face in cricket and in wider society were discussed. Local players who were part of the MCCF programmes told of how cricket empowers them in a relatively conservative society.\n\nThe workshops, led by a gender specialist, form a core component of the Cricket for Equality project delivery in Biratnagar/East Nepal and serve as a method to facilitate discussion around gender-based norms and issues.\n\nThe squad also led coaching sessions with schoolchildren, with one group of players coaching academy players from Pokhara and Kaski, whilst three other groups headed to schools across Pokhara, where players came from schools that Kidasha – the local delivery partner of MCCF – work in.\n\nThere were between 60-80 young cricketers at each two-hour session, with an even split of boys and girls. At the conclusion of the tour, the squad donated kit and clothing to Kidasha and CWB to distribute across MCCF programmes in Pokhara and Biratnagar.\n\nOn the playing front, MCC won two of their six matches, with their first win coming against an ICC Under-19 XI in Kathmandu, which comprised of players from Malaysia, UAE, Bhutan, Qatar and hosts Nepal.\n\nFormer England international Claire Taylor, who was managing the tour, struck 97 from 66 balls as MCC made 175 for 3 in their 20 overs. The tourists then restricted their opponents to 159 for 4, despite an unbeaten 80 from 18 year-old UAE international Theertha Satish.\n\nTaylor, who is Chair of the MCC Cricket committee and previously won 168 caps for her country, was making her 100th appearance for the Club.\n\nMCC also tasted victory in Pokhara against a CAN XI made up of players that were either from or had come through the local MCCF funded projects. Three wickets for Jo Foster helped bowl the Nepalese XI out for 66 before unbeaten knocks from Abbie Whybrow (30) and Rachael Potter (29) saw MCC win by 10 wickets.\n\nThere was also a low-scoring T20 thriller against Nepal in Pokhara. MCC had restricted their hosts to 99 for 9 and would have fancied a tilt at victory needing 22 from the final six deliveries with four wickets in hand, but an incredible last over from the experienced Rubina Chetri saw the seamer take four wickets in four balls as MCC were bowled out for 80.\n\nAway from cricket, the squad visited the beautiful Boudhanath Stupa, experienced the Diwali festivities in Kathmandu, admired the scale of the Himalayas, and visited The Tal Barahi Temple on the Phewa Tal (lake) followed by a hike to the World Peace Pagoda Stupa.\n\nThey also visited Gurkha and Mountaineering museums and a traditional Tibetan village, attended singing bowl meditation sessions and yoga, and headed up the cable car to the Sarangkot for sunrise. A few also braved the airways to paraglide over the Annapurna range and used the last morning in Kathmandu to fly past Everest.\n\nThe MCC Spirit of Cricket Tournament, hosted at the Desert Springs Cricket Ground in Almería, Spain, began with the first of two MCC teams playing Germany and Italy.\n\nAll three days of cricket provided some extremely competitive action in the T20 format, with the outcome of the matches usually decided by individual moments of excellence, such as Fayez Naseri’s unbeaten 42, which included 28 off only five balls as Germany defeated MCC.\n\nGermany became the stand out side in this segment of the tournament, winning all four matches and showing their experience in T20 Internationals. This format is prioritised by European nations, with most of their playing time normally dedicated to this form of the game.\n\nBoth MCC and Italy won one match out of their four, with MCC beating the Italians by seven wickets. Skipper Chris Swallow claimed miserly figures of 2 for 6 as Italy made 137 for 6, before Kent’s Marcus O’Riordan top-scored with 41 as MCC made it home with three balls to spare.\n\nThe second week began with a fresh squad of MCC players arriving in Almería ready to take on Austria and Spain. On the opening day, a strong Spanish performance saw them defeat Austria, before the Austrian side redeemed themselves in an exciting victory to beat MCC in the final over.\n\nUnfortunately, poor weather dictated proceedings on the second day as both matches were washed out. On the final day’s play, Spain again triumphed over Austria with Daniel Doyle’s unbeaten 80 the highlight of the innings.\n\nRain also played a part in the final game of the trip as Spain beat MCC by 12 runs on the Duckworth/Lewis/Stern method, despite a knock of 40 from Charlie Hurley. The result saw Spain match Germany’s achievements in the first half of the tournament by winning all their matches.\n\nThe tournament was gratefully received by the nations involved as well as the Members who represented MCC on this trip, which was the first overseas tour the Club has been able to provide since early 2020, due to the complications of travel caused by Covid-19.\n\nThe matches not only gave the players involved valuable experience of performing under pressure, but also provided the coaches the opportunity to see their players play in tight situations, which will add to their development significantly.\n\nItaly Head Coach and former Hampshire, Middlesex and Northamptonshire all-rounder Gareth Berg said: “From our perspective, it was like gold dust for me to get the opportunity to coach and look at a wider scope of possible national players moving forward.\n\n“We hope that one day we could invite MCC along with others to hold a similar event and showcase some of our beautiful country.”\n\nIan Ramage, who sits on the ECB’s Umpire Panel, also provided several of the officials with expert coaching whilst former Pakistan international Yasir Arafat, who managed the first squad of MCC players, has spent time with players from the opposing nations, imparting valuable knowledge from his vast experience of the international game.\n\nThe full scorecards and results from all the matches that took place are available via the 'Fixtures and Results' tab above.\n\nDarren Bicknell (Manager)\n\nFormer Surrey, Nottinghamshire and Cambridgeshire batsman Bicknell is the Tour Manager for this MCC tour. The 52 year-old is currently Chairman of cricket at Nottinghamshire CCC and Head Coach of the county’s Under-15 team. He scored just shy of 20,000 first-class runs in a career that spanned nineteen years.\n\nHis current role away from the game sees him work as Chief Executive of the Belvoir Cricket & Countryside Trust; a charity based in the East Midlands who work with primary school children and children with special needs, to encourage participation in cricket and countryside activities.\n\nNeil Bainton (Umpire)\n\nBainton is the Club’s umpire for the trip and has previously toured Mozambique and Uganda with MCC.
