        "text": "Upminster captain John Curtis was delighted the return of Shahbaz Butt coincided with his side getting back to winning ways by defeating relegation rivals Hadleigh & Thundersley on Saturday.\n\nA close Essex League Division One encounter occurred at John Burrows Park on Saturday and in the end it was Curtis’ team that held their nerve to earn a 13-run triumph and delight everyone associated with the club.\n\nShahbaz Butt made 87 on his return as Upminster posed 234-9 from their 50 overs before the hosts were bowled out for 221.\n\nCurtis said: “It was a massive result. We dug in well and we have definitely played better and got beat.\n\n“It wasn’t the best we have performed this season, but we showed spirit in the end with our fielding and bowling display.\n\n“Shahbaz batted brilliantly and has got that extra bit of quality that we have been missing. If it wasn’t his first innings for a while he probably would have got a century.\n\n“He did get tired towards the end. I think if he had been available for us all season we would probably be mid-table rather than struggling.”\n\nShahbaz Butt also showed he is no one trick pony by dismissing Hadleigh captain Adam Soilleux for 44 on Saturday to finish with 1-18 from his three overs.\n\nCurtis, who picked up three scalps himself, felt it was a key wicket to get and was delighted with the character his side showed.\n\nHe added: “Shahbaz never really bowled before, but over the winter he has been working on that in the nets. We were struggling at the drinks break and I threw him the ball and he got their best batsman to nick off behind.\n\n“That was the turning point to be honest because Hadleigh’s captain is a good player and when they beat Hornchurch the other week it was him that hit 90 not out.\n\n“Whenever they have won games it has been him who has hit big scores so not only did Shahbaz bat really well, he got a massive wicket too so it was a good day for him.”\n\nAnother positive for Upminster was seeing Alan Ison back bowling again for the first time since May after struggling with injuries.\n\nHe claimed two wickets in one over to finish with 2-27 from his four and that contributed towards the vital win.\n\nCurtis added: “Alan said he was ready to bowl but I know his back has been troubling him. He didn’t get off to a great start but what Alan has always been good at is bowling straight at the death.\n\n“He come on and got two wickets in an over to give us more control. They needed 30 runs after that, but I was always confident we would get the wickets we needed to win.\n\n“It was a positive for Alan to bowl on Saturday and hopefully he can bowl more for the rest of the season.”"
