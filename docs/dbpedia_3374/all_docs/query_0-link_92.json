Oxford University has a world-class reputation for academic excellence. For information about undergraduate courses available, and how to make your choice, see pp. 25–108. 2. Oxford University is accessible to all students of talent and ability, whatever their background. The generous Oxford Opportunity Bursary ensures that finance should not be a barrier to any UK student who wants to apply to Oxford. Further details are on p. 21. 3. Oxford is one of the few universities in the world that bases its teaching on the tutorial system, which means more individual attention and teaching from your tutors, tailored to your learning needs. See pp. 4–5 for more information about studying at Oxford. 4. Many Oxford tutors are international experts in their chosen fields. This engagement with research and scholarship enables students to have an enhanced understanding of their subject discipline. 5. College life is one of the University’s greatest assets, since a close college community provides a friendly and welcoming home for students who are living away for the first time. Students soon get to know each other, and tutors get to know students individually, enabling them to respond to their individual academic needs. For information on Oxford Colleges, and how to make your choice, see pp. 109–145.\n\n2\n\n6. Students have access to resources across the University: unrivalled libraries, sports facilities, laboratories, language-learning opportunities, computer equipment and music facilities. For further details on the facilities available see pp. 6–11. 7. Oxford University provides a diverse study environment: undergraduate students represent over 130 nationalities as well as all nations and regions of the UK. 8. With clubs, societies and events organised by both colleges and the wider University, as well as a vibrant city nightlife, Oxford offers opportunities for whatever social life you may be looking for. See some examples on pp. 10–15. 9. Most colleges offer student accommodation for two years of your course, and many can offer accommodation for every year of your course, saving you the trouble and expense of privately rented accommodation. For more information on where Oxford students live, see p. 16. 10. Oxford University has an excellent graduate employment record. Students have the use of the excellent careers service and enter a huge range of careers. Employers recognise that Oxford’s rigorously academic degree courses give graduates a range of transferable skills, as well as breadth and depth in their chosen subject. See pp. 18–19 for more information about careers.\n\nContents 4\n\nStudying at Oxford\n\n6\n\nLibraries\n\n7\n\nMuseums and collections\n\n8\n\nComputing services\n\n9\n\nLanguage Centre\n\n10\n\nSport\n\n11\n\nMusic, and organ and choral awards\n\n12\n\nClubs and societies\n\n14\n\nThe city and nightlife\n\n16\n\nWhere will I live?\n\n17\n\nWelfare and student support\n\n18\n\nGraduate destinations\n\n20\n\nStudent finance\n\n23\n\nInternational students\n\n24\n\nInternational students and scholarships\n\n25\n\nCourses\n\n110 Oxford colleges - belonging to a community 111 How do I choose a college? 112 Which colleges offer my course? 113 Colleges and Permanent Private Halls 146 Undergraduate numbers by college 2007-8 148 Admissions statistics 149 Summary of written work and test requirements 152 Open Days 2008 154 Finding out more 155 Widening access to Oxford\n\nAll images: Rob Judges\n\n156 Mature Students 157 Second undergraduate degrees 157 Visiting students 158 How to apply 161 Interview timetable December 2008 162 Index 164 Map of the University Back How to get to Oxford\n\n3\n\nStudying at Oxford The University of Oxford is world-famous for academic excellence. The best and brightest students are selected, irrespective of their background, on their academic merit, and passion and commitment for their chosen degree course. It’s not all work of course, and there’s more about the social side of life on the following pages, but studying is certainly at the heart of life for all Oxford University students.\n\nLearning and teaching Tutorials are central to teaching at Oxford, giving students an invaluable opportunity to discuss their subject with world leaders in their field. Personal support in this way means that every student is encouraged and supported to develop to his or her full potential. Tutorials take place in colleges, and are supplemented by lectures, classes and practicals, which are also important in developing students’ understanding. These usually take place in University department buildings, with students from all the colleges. This means that students have personal tuition within their college but also meet students from across the University in their departments. This combines the best of one-to-one or small group teaching in college with the wealth of resources available at University level.\n\nWhat happens in a tutorial? You will meet at least once a week with a college tutor, either on a one-to-one basis or with one or two other students, to discuss an essay or solutions to set problems which you will have researched in advance. The purpose of the tutorial is to review your answers and theories and to raise any new points that result from the discussion. The tutorial system’s success relies on the active exchange of ideas between you, your tutor and other students present. You do not need to be an experienced debater to do well in tutorials but you must be prepared to give and defend your own opinions, whilst conceding to others and accepting constructive criticism and advice. Through this method of teaching you will develop your ability to think independently, which will not only benefit you academically but will provide you with one of the many transferable skills employers find attractive when recruiting Oxford graduates.\n\nAm I only taught in my own college? From time to time, your college may arrange for you to have tutorials in another college, particularly after the first year when you may choose particular specialist options. This ensures that you are always taught by an expert in your chosen subject area. This can also be beneficial to your learning as it exposes you to different points of view and different ways of conducting a tutorial. Equally important are the University-run lectures and practical classes in central faculties; your tutor will advise you which would be useful or essential for your course.\n\n4\n\nThe courses Oxford offers a wide range of courses: all have a core element while also allowing plenty of scope to follow your own areas of interest. No matter which college you go to, the course will be the same, since the University organises all lectures and practical classes centrally, and sets your main examinations. All Oxford degrees are similar in their objective to make students think logically, laterally and independently. Your choice of degree is the most important decision when applying for university and you should make sure that Oxford will offer you the most appropriate course and the method of teaching that best suits you as an individual. You must choose which course you wish to study when you apply, and it is not usually possible to change your course after you have started. There are a few exceptions to this, which are explained on the individual course pages. For a list of courses see p. 25.\n\nJoint schools Oxford offers a number of combined courses, or joint schools, as they are often called. They allow you to choose the areas that interest you from more than one different discipline, sometimes across arts and sciences, such as Physics and Philosophy. It does not mean that you have to do more than one degree – you simply choose from a selection of elements of each degree, sometimes with special link or combination papers. Please note that competition for joint schools courses is particularly strong, and you must demonstrate your aptitude for each element of the course.\n\nHow will my work be assessed? Arts students are normally examined twice: preliminary examinations are taken within the first year and must be passed in order to continue the course, but do not count towards the degree. The second set of examinations (usually called the Final Honour School or Finals) takes place in your last term. Finals consist of several papers lasting three hours, which you sit within a two-week period. For some subjects, such as Modern Languages, there is an additional oral exam. In some courses one or two exams can be replaced by a thesis and/or some extended pieces of written work which will make up part of the final grade. Science students also sit preliminary exams during the first year, which they must pass in order to continue the course. All science subjects then focus towards exams at the end of the third year, although certain subjects sit some of them in the second year. Some papers are made up of projects or dissertations. Most science courses have a fourth year and this is either entirely research-based, or part research and part exams. All the exams count towards the final degree except the first year preliminary examinations. For further details about assessment please see the individual course pages.\n\nRob Judges Greg Smolonski\n\nRob Judges\n\nIs there a set syllabus or can I choose modules?\n\nWhat is academic dress?\n\nAll Oxford degrees offer a core element that forms the basis of your degree, and you will also have a variety of options from which to choose. This and the weekly exchange with your tutor allow you to tailor your course to your personal interests. You can see the individual course pages for further information and some examples of options but you may also wish to refer to course websites for more comprehensive information.\n\nYou may have seen pictures of Oxford students wearing academic dress and wondered about it. The only times students are required to wear academic dress are matriculation, which is the ceremony of admission to the University at the start of the course, and formal exams, where students are required to wear a gown and dark skirt or trousers and blouse (for women), or a dark suit (for men).\n\nWhat kind of student studies at Oxford?\n\nPart-time courses\n\nOxford students come from all kinds of schools and colleges, backgrounds and countries. All candidates are considered on the basis of their own individual merits and potential, making it impossible to define a ‘typical’ student. Common to all are commitment, enthusiasm and motivation for their chosen area of study, backed by a strong academic record.\n\nThrough its Department for Continuing Education the University also offers part-time Undergraduate Certificates, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas in various subjects, including Foundation Certificates in English Language and Literature, and History. Some of these courses may be taken online and all are accredited according to the nationally recognised credit framework. Past students have progressed on to complete degrees at Oxford and universities elsewhere: students on Foundation Certificates may apply, for example, for direct entry to year two of undergraduate courses in English or History. For further details please see www.conted.ox.ac.uk or contact 01865 270369 or [email protected].\n\nWill it be all work and no play? Students at Oxford work hard, but they all enjoy the opportunity to pursue other interests outside their course. Oxford offers plenty of opportunities to take up new sports, join societies, take part in the rich cultural and musical life, or simply enjoy time with your friends.\n\n5\n\nLibraries Oxford meets the needs of students, teachers and the international research community with a rich and diverse range of library resources provided by more than 100 separate libraries. Although their subjects may vary, all students will spend a significant amount of time reading, researching and writing their essays or working on projects. For example, a student writing a politics essay may choose to refer to more than a dozen books, journals and other references when researching for it. There are three types of libraries at the University: college libraries, departmental or faculty libraries and research libraries, including the largest University library, the Bodleian, known affectionately as the ‘Bod’.\n\nNigel Young/Foster + Partners\n\nCollege libraries The college library is a good first port of call. College libraries aim to provide the core material for those studying at that college, with multiple copies of the most popular books and other key works featuring regularly on tutors’ reading lists. This reduces the amount of material that needs to be bought. College libraries have generous lending limits, and many purchase new books for students on request. Most are open round the clock and all provide a quiet environment for studying. The college librarian is able to guide students to resources in the library and elsewhere in the University.\n\nDepartmental and faculty libraries In most subjects, the departmental or faculty library complements the college library. It acts as an extra source of reading list material, as well as giving students access to more specialist material for optional topics and more advanced study of particular areas within their degree course. Library staff give introductory sessions and are available to give further guidance in finding material and using electronic resources.\n\nResearch libraries Although focusing on provision for researchers, the research libraries are open to undergraduate students and many include material or collections specifically selected for students. They hold extensive collections of books and periodicals, making them a valuable resource, especially for extended essays and undergraduate dissertations in the final year. They include: n\n\nRadcliffe Science Library: supports the teaching, learning and research needs of the science and medical departments. From 2008, most purchased current journal issues, as well as extensive backsets, are available electronically. n Sackler Library: one of the world’s foremost collections on the archaeology and antiquities of Europe and the Middle East; extensive holdings in Art History (Western and Eastern) and Classics. There is a multiple-copy Classics lending collection to support undergraduate courses.\n\n6\n\nn\n\nSocial Science Library: supports the teaching/ learning and research needs of the departments in the Centre for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences; serves a number of undergraduate courses including PPE, Economics and Management, and History and Politics; houses a significant statistics collection and is well provided with computer terminals. n Taylor Institution Library: largest specialist library in the UK for medieval and modern European languages and literatures; houses the Modern Languages Faculty Library, including a new collection of books and DVDs.\n\nBodleian Library The principal University research library is the Bodleian, the second largest library in the UK, which houses more than eight million volumes over 117 miles of shelving. The Bodleian is a copyright library and can therefore claim a copy of every book and periodical published in the UK and Ireland, making it an unparalleled resource for students at Oxford University.\n\nElectronic resources The great majority of libraries in Oxford are linked electronically, including an online catalogue which makes it easy to locate materials. OxLIP (Oxford Libraries Information Platform) gives the students access to the largest collection of electronic resources in a UK university. Full texts of newspapers and pre-1900 books support preparation for extended essays in subjects such as English and History. There are also selected internet resources and over 22,000 electronic journals. Oxford is actively involved in developing electronic information provision, and is a leader in the digitisation of manuscripts and other library material.

It is the most important museum of art and archaeology in this country outside London. The Museum holds a particularly strong collection of European graphic art, which includes drawings by Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael. Undergraduate degrees drawing on Museum staff and collections include: Archaeology and Anthropology; Ancient and Modern History; Classical Archaeology and Ancient History; Classics; History of Art; and Fine Art. In addition to this, the Ashmolean hopes in the near future to offer elective courses to medical students, namely Ancient Medicine, Ways of Seeing and Observing. All undergraduates receive an invitation to a special evening event in the Museum in their first year. Web: www.ashmus.ox.ac.uk\n\nPitt Rivers Museum The Pitt Rivers Museum is one of the country’s largest collections of ethnography and world archaeology, numbering some half a million items when its important historical photographs are included. The Museum is noted for its period feel, for the density of its displays, and for their arrangement by artefact category rather than by cultural area. Undergraduate courses that draw upon the Museum’s resources include: Archaeology and Anthropology; Human Sciences; Geography; Classics; History of Art; and Fine Art. Web: www.prm.ox.ac.uk\n\nMuseum of the History of Science The Museum of the History of Science houses an unrivalled collection of over 10,000 historic scientific instruments in the world’s oldest surviving purpose-built museum building. The objects represented cover almost all aspects of the history of science, from antiquity to the early 20th century. Particular strengths include the collections of astrolabes, sundials, quadrants, early mathematical instruments, and optical instruments, together with apparatus associated with chemistry, natural philosophy and medicine. Museum staff contribute to the teaching of Modern History and History of Art. Web: www.mhs.ox.ac.uk\n\nPhil Sayer\n\nOxford’s world-renowned museums and galleries hold collections of international importance for the use of researchers, teaching staff and students, and the enjoyment of the wider public. They also provide a cultural resource for all, independent of set courses, and offer opportunities for voluntary work with the public or collections. There are four major museums in the University as well as the Botanic Garden and a number of significant collections in departments and colleges. Web: www.ox.ac.uk/museums/\n\nBotanic Garden\n\nThe University of Oxford Botanic Garden is the oldest in Great Britain and acts as a national The Natural History Museum houses the University’s reference collection of 7,000 different types of scientific collections of zoological, entomological plant, making it the most compact yet diverse and geological specimens. The Museum itself is a collection of plants in the world. Plants are grown Grade I listed building, renowned for its spectacular in the Garden to support teaching programmes, for neo-Gothic architecture. Among its most famous research scientists in this University and elsewhere, features are the first dinosaur to be scientifically and as part of plant conservation projects. identified, the dodo, and the swifts in the tower.

Oxford University Computing Services (OUCS) provides a wide range of IT services, focusing on those that are best provided on a centralised basis (the core networks, expensive peripherals, IT training, mail and information services).\n\nIT learning programme OUCS offers an extensive programme of practical IT courses, covering introductory and specialised uses of computers, common operating systems and popular application software. OUCS is a training and testing centre for the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) and ECDL Advanced, which are internationally recognised IT qualifications.\n\nVirtual Learning Environment (VLE) OUCS runs Weblearn, the central VLE, where course material can be found along with other tools for learning such as discussion rooms and online quizzes. To view the publicly available content (some is available only to specific students) log in to www.weblearn.ox.ac.uk.\n\nEmail and network services All undergraduates are issued with an email address when they arrive in Oxford. They may also obtain access to other computer systems in their college, department or OUCS to provide a range of facilities such as software.\n\n8\n\nOther services at OUCS The OUCS Help Centre provides general support and advice by email, telephone and in person. They have a small number of public PCs and Macintoshes providing network access (email, web access, etc.), mainly for self-paced learning, and for use with scanning and printing facilities.

The LASR (Languages for Study and Research) programme offers term-time courses in French, German, Italian, Mandarin, Modern Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, and Welsh at most levels from beginner to advanced. These courses are intended primarily (but not exclusively) for those who need foreign languages for their study or research. OPAL, the Oxford University Programme in Languages, offers certificated evening courses in a more limited range of languages for highly motivated language learners. Special courses are also organised for undergraduates studying (in 2007–8) Chemistry (German), Engineering Science (French and German), Law (French and Dutch), Maths (French), Modern History (French), History of Art (Italian), and Physics (French, German and Spanish). There are modest charges for courses which may be payable by colleges or departments.\n\nEnglish language support All students are expected to be fluent in English before starting their course (see p. 27 for requirements). Support is also available, with courses in English for Academic Studies. The Pre-sessional courses in English for Academic Studies in August and September are designed to help students adjust to studying in the UK and to improve their language skills before the academic year starts. Term-time courses are aimed at improving students’ current use of English or have a particular focus such as academic writing.\n\nGreg Smolonski\n\nThe University has a large and well-equipped Language Centre, which is open to all University members, regardless of whether they are studying for a language degree.\n\nLanguage Library resources For the independent learner, the Centre also has a first-class Language Library with text, audio, video and computer-based materials in more than 130 languages, foreign language satellite reception in 13 languages, as well as email and internet facilities offering links to many language learning sites. Students with GCSE or A-level French and/or German may also join the Lambda Project to maintain their language skills with the help of a language adviser.

In the current era, Oxford stands in a celebrated position: it is consistently amongst the top ten universities in the annual rankings produced by BUSA (British Universities Sports Association), thanks to the success of the 36 teams that regularly compete on a Wednesday and the raft of others who take part in individual and BUSA Championship weekend tournaments. If your aim is to represent Oxford, then you will be in the good company of the University’s vast and proud sporting community. However, if you wish to play for fun, take up a new sport or just get fit, then our set-up is ideal: college leagues which supplement inter-university competition. The University of Oxford boasts some of the best sporting facilities in the university sector, occupying three main sites within the city centre, namely the Iffley Road Sports Complex, the University Parks Sports Grounds and the Marston Road Sports Ground. The Iffley Road Sports Complex is where many key facilities can be found and where many clubs train and compete. It boasts a fitness gym, an allweather running track, an Olympic standard artificial hockey pitch and a 25-metre swimming pool. Association football, lawn tennis and rugby are also catered for, along with a rowing tank,\n\ncricket school, sports hall and dojo. In the summer, our cricketers have the use of the picturesque historic University Parks – the only venue in Britain where spectators can watch first class cricket for free. Many of our women’s teams have the privilege of using the Marston Sports Ground and its clubhouse. Further to the University sites, many colleges offer facilities of their own. These range from in-college squash courts or fitness suites, to immaculate external cricket ovals and lively clubhouses. They form a network of green space that traverses the city of Oxford. The University’s Sports Federation helps to run over 80 clubs, which range from the famous core sports to new and esoteric activities. They cater for a great range of participants, from the interested dilettante to the international performer. All participants find their university experience enhanced by engagement with the sporting scene. The elite among these gain the status of ‘Blue’: a historic accolade which stems from the earliest recorded boat races which saw Cambridge tying light blue ribbons to their vessel and Oxford adopting Christ Church’s dark blue colours. For those who do not have such lofty sporting ambitions, rest assured that the wide range of opportunities does mean that you can get as involved as you wish, in almost any sport, at any level. Whether you want to play in a serious team, a less serious one, or just enjoy running, swimming, cycling or other sports by yourself, you will find what you are looking for here.

Oxford’s strength in classical music stretches back for centuries. Some college choirs today have worldwide reputations and can be traced back to the college’s foundation. Today the city is home to a large number of University and collegebased ensembles and choirs. The Sheldonian Theatre and the Holywell Music Room are prime venues for both student and professional performances. Formed in 1867 to promote the appreciation and performance of music within the University, the Oxford University Music Society (OUMS) is one of the oldest societies in the University. Members, consisting of both listeners and performers, enjoy a wide range of facilities and benefits, and many performing groups are greatly assisted through the Society’s coordination work and financial support. OUMS runs several ensembles: the professionally conducted Oxford University Orchestra, student conducted Oxford University Philharmonia, Oxford University Sinfonietta, Oxford University Wind Orchestra, Oxford Chamber Orchestra, Oxford University String Ensemble, Oxford University Big Band and Oxford University Brass Band. Further to the University’s Music Society, many colleges also have their\n\nown music societies, which run smaller orchestras, choirs and organise recitals and a number of individuals run University-wide orchestras. As a soloist there are regular opportunities to play concerti or put on solo recitals and there are numerous student organised chamber music groups around the University. The Oxford Philomusica, the University’s Orchestra in Residence, offers a great range of opportunities, including performances, recitals, masterclasses and coaching. At the top end of musical ability, the University boasts student orchestras of professional calibre – notably the Oxford University Orchestra and the Oxford University Philharmonia – and choirs of renown, namely Christ Church, Magdalen and New College, along with the Schola Cantorum. Other levels of accomplishment are catered for by college music societies. Opera is represented by at least two University-based organisations. Other organisations within the University cater for almost every other conceivable interest, from soul to jazz, from classical Indian to contemporary Russian. And if you feel there is something missing, Oxford is the ideal place to do your own thing with the wealth of musical talent the University has at its disposal. Web: www.oums.org\n\nOrgan scholars either assist with or take charge of the music of the college chapel, and take an active part in the musical activities of the college in general. The scope of these duties varies from college to college, as do the requirements. Choral scholars are appointed to sing in the college’s chapel choir. Applications for these awards must be made by 1 September 2008. A number of colleges offer instrumental awards to undergraduates in recognition of their prowess and contribution to college musical life. Only undergraduates who are already in residence at a college are eligible to apply. For further information about these awards, information on the choral and organ awards open day, and details of how to apply, please see www.admissions.ox.ac.uk/orgscholars/. Open day: 3 May 2008.\n\nOrgan, repetiteur, choral and instrumental awards Many colleges at Oxford University offer awards for organ and choral scholarships, and a number also offer instrumental or repetiteur awards.\n\n11\n\nGreg Smolonski\n\nClubs and societies Student societies With more than 400 clubs and societies to choose from, your time at Oxford will never be dull. The range of societies – which, further to music and sports, also covers interests such as literature, politics, performing arts and media, as well as faith and culural groups – is so wide that it may be a challenge to decide on which ones to join. Regardless of your level of expertise, you can become involved in any club or society in which you are interested. If a society or team is not available, there is often support for those wishing to establish one. The annual Freshers’ Fair held at the start of the first term is an ideal opportunity to find out more about the clubs and societies available.\n\nDrama Oxford has excellent facilities for drama with no less than three venues presenting student productions: n\n\nBurton Taylor Theatre (50 seats) Old Fire Station (170 seats) n Playhouse (613 seats) About 30 productions take place per term with colleges also used as venues, in particular their gardens, which provide wonderful settings for a variety of outdoor productions in the third term. Whether your interest lies front or backstage, you will have lots of opportunities to participate in, as well as to see, a wide variety of traditional, contemporary and experimental productions. n\n\n12\n\nThere are many University-wide bodies, including Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), the Experimental Theatre Club (ETC), a University theatre technicians’ society (TAFF) and the Oxford Revue, as well as many societies at college level. OUDS flagships an annual overseas theatrical trip to Japan, touring a production directed, performed, produced and technically coordinated by students. Similarly, OUDS hosts an annual national summer tour, culminating at a run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. There is a full-time University Drama Officer who helps students to plan, programme and publicise their productions and organises supplementary workshops and talks which are free and open to all. The Drama Officer can also give advice to those who wish to pursue a career in theatre or film upon graduation. In addition to this, each year a major theatrical figure is appointed as Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre and gives a series of lectures and workshops to students. Previous incumbents include Sir Richard Attenborough, Nicholas Hytner and Patrick Stewart.

The Oxford Student and The Cherwell newspapers seek contributions for everything from restaurant reviews and crossword compilation to investigative journalism and sports reports. There is also the Isis magazine, which is the longest-running student publication in the country, as well as dozens of other print publications and websites from University-wide information to your college newsletter. Web: www.oxideradio.co.uk www.cherwell.org www.oxfordstudent.com www.isismagazine.org.uk\n\nThe Oxford Union The Union is the world’s most famous debating society, with an unparalleled reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to Oxford. Established in 1823, it aims to promote debate and discussion not just at the University of Oxford, but across the globe. As well as famous debates on topical issues featuring world-class speakers, the Union also serves as a social centre. There are frequent addresses by renowned international figures from all walks of life, ranging from Yassir Arafat to O. J. Simpson, from Frankie Dettori to Doris Lessing, and Michael Heseltine to Ewan McGregor. A membership fee is required for life membership. Web: www.oxford-union.org\n\nOxford University Student Union (OUSU) All Oxford University students are automatically members of OUSU, which represents students to the University and to external organisations. OUSU also provides a number of services, including welfare advice and resources, Raise and Give (RAG) and a night bus. OUSU produces more than 20 publications, including the Freshers’ Guide and the Oxford Handbook, and organises University-wide events such as the Freshers’ Fair and regular student nights at popular clubs. OUSU also campaigns on a range of issues affecting students, and has played a leading role in the national campaign to oppose upfront fees and push for better grants for students. Finally, OUSU works hard for students applying to Oxford by providing the Alternative Prospectus and through the Target Schools scheme, which encourages state school students to apply to Oxford.

As a result, you will find a youthful and cosmopolitan atmosphere and plenty of things to see and do. Beautiful and historic architecture sits alongside all the main high street stores, numerous coffee shops and restaurants, and a thriving bar and club scene. Oxford also boasts a surprising amount of green spaces, including beautiful riverside walks, the oldest botanic garden in the country (see www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk for further details), the University Parks and college gardens. Most colleges and departments are situated in and around the city centre, and accommodation is usually on the main college site, or is only a short walk or cycle ride away from other college and University buildings.\n\nLife at Oxford Live music Oxford has a vibrant music scene catering for all tastes – from acid jazz and ambient drum ‘n’ bass to trance, thrash metal and trip hop. With both the globally renowned Radiohead and up-andcoming stars Foals starting out as local Oxford bands, the city provides a number of gig venues for established acts and newcomers alike to showcase their talents. Worth a look are the Carling Academy @ Oxford – formerly called The Zodiac – on the Cowley Road, and The Venue at Oxford Brookes University, which in the past couple of years have brought to Oxford the likes of Calvin Harris, Dizzee Rascal, Franz Ferdinand and the Scissor Sisters. Meanwhile smaller venues such as The Cellar, off Cornmarket Street, and The Wheatsheaf, off the High Street, are great places to catch local bands and underground acts on the verge of the big-time.\n\nNightlife For a city of its size, Oxford has a surprisingly varied club scene, with many nightclubs within the city centre. Through the weekday nights the Student Union and several promoters provide numerous student clubnights, with the most popular clubs including The Bridge, Park End, and The Studio. Here R‘n’B, hip-hop and classic ‘cheese’ dominate the playlist, whilst The Purple Turtle provides free entry every night and cheap drinks for members of the Oxford Union (see p. 13). Elsewhere there is something for everyone. At the Carling Academy you can enjoy alternative,\n\n14\n\nindie and hard rock, whilst Po Na Na caters for fans of funk, chillout and eclectic music. For those who still feel that Oxford’s nightlife is too tame, London is only an hour and a half’s bus ride away, with return coach trips from Oxford 24 hours a day.\n\nPubs and restaurants Oxford’s restaurants cater for all tastes, from Jamaican, Thai, Polish and Kurdish to French and Lebanese, and from cheap and cheerful through to contemporary café cuisine and special occasion dining. The main clusters of restaurants are situated on the Cowley Road, in the Jericho area of the city, and in the recently developed area around Oxford’s former 18thcentury gaol. There are also numerous pubs and taverns ranging from the 14th century, such as the Turf Tavern off Holywell Street, as well as contemporary cocktail bars, including Raoul’s in Jericho.\n\nTheatre and cinema Drama fans will be encouraged to hear that there are several good theatres in the city including the Oxford Playhouse, one of Britain’s leading theatres and a key stop on the national touring circuit; the New Theatre, which stages a variety of touring dramatic productions, comedy, opera, ballet and pop; and the Pegasus Theatre, which specialises in contemporary performing arts from all over the world and youth arts education. The University-owned Burton Taylor Theatre is home to the Oxford University Dramatic Society (see p. 12), and a few colleges have their own smaller theatres. Film fans are catered for at two mainstream and two independent cinemas in the city, and a multiplex on the outskirts.\n\nShopping The central shopping area in Oxford, where you will find many of the main high street stores, is based around Cornmarket Street, Queen Street and the High Street, and includes the Westgate and Clarendon shopping centres. The famous Covered Market is also situated in this area and is the place where you will find exclusive shops and small outlets selling arts and crafts items, along with a wide range of stores, as well as sandwich bars and cafés. If you are interested in sampling delights from around the world, then the Cowley Road would be a good place to head for, since it is here that you will find a great variety of delicatessens.\n\nFurther information\n\nOxford’s history has provided us with a series of events, traditionally taking place in the summer months. Regular events include Party in the Park, Cowley Road Carnival, the Jericho Street Fair and Oxford Pride. It has long been the practice on May Day (1 May) to gather on the High Street and Magdalen Bridge to listen to choristers sing an invocation to summer from the top of Magdalen College Tower at 6 am. This has evolved into a real celebration over the years: large crowds attend the event, which is often accompanied by balls, parties and long opening hours. Summer Eights, the colleges’ annual rowing competition, takes place in June and attracts large crowds supporting their college from the side of the river. Whether you are interested in the sport or not, you will enjoy the buzz and party atmosphere that usually accompanies the event, which is held over several days.\n\nIf you want to find out more about the city of Oxford and what goes on, there are several websites you can refer to: n www.inoxfordmag.co.uk, www.oxfordcitylife.co.uk and www.dailyinfo.co.uk provide details on gigs, cinemas, theatres and shopping. n www.oxfordcity.co.uk provides information about the city including tourist information. n www.oxford.gov.uk is the city council’s website which includes information on public transport and the environment.\n\nGreg Smolonski\n\nRob Judges\n\nGreg Smolonski\n\nGreg Smolonski\n\nRob Judges Greg Smolonski\n\nSpecial events\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union (OUSU, see p. 13) publishes the Oxford Handbook, a concise guide to the city, the University and the colleges.\n\n15\n\nUndergraduate students are required to live in Oxford. All colleges provide rooms for their first year students. They may contact you with details of your room after offers are confirmed in August, or they may just wait until you arrive for your course, and then give you your keys – either way, it will all be arranged for you, and you do not need to look for your own accommodation before you start your course. All colleges also offer accommodation for at least one further year of your course and many can do so for the whole of your course. College rooms are usually single study bedrooms, and some are en suite. Some college have a few ‘sets’ where two students share a central study and living area, but you will always have your own bedroom. Rooms may be on the main college site, or in college owned buildings nearby. They will be furnished and there may also be an internal telephone and an internet point. Colleges are very safe environments, as each one has a Porters’ Lodge, which is like a reception office at the main entrance, where porters fulfil reception and security duties. They also tend to get to know the students and take an active interest in their personal safety. If your college does require you to find private accommodation for a year, or if you prefer to ‘live out’ of college, you may wish to share a house with your friends, or perhaps rent a room in a family home. This can be a little more expensive than staying in college, but it does mean that you can stay in Oxford throughout the vacations. Students usually need to move out of college rooms at the end of each term. All of the colleges and college accommodation buildings are either in the city centre or very close to it. Students who are in private accommodation usually also live\n\n16\n\nwithin a 15-minute walk or short cycle ride of the centre. This is an advantage of Oxford, as you do not need to spend money on bus fares or taxis, as you may have to in larger cities. Wherever you live you will have access to your college’s facilities, such as a library, bar, common room, laundry, computer room, sports ground and a dining hall, where three meals are offered every day. It is a benefit of the college system that a student can make use of college facilities throughout their course as well as the general University resources. You will need to bring your own personal items with you of course, such as your clothes, music and posters. You may need to bring some basic kitchen equipment as well, if you wish to cook for yourself, but your college will give you more details, and information of what will already be provided. Colleges may be able to provide storage over the vacations, particularly for overseas students. You may be able to stay in college during the vacations, or could arrange to stay with friends who are living out. Some students choose to do this to catch up on work and prepare for the term ahead, or just to enjoy spending some time in Oxford without any work commitments. The Land Agent’s and Accommodation Office provides information about private sector accommodation for all students. Lists of shared houses, particularly popular with undergraduates, are available from January. Land Agent’s and Accommodation Office Ewert House, Ewert Place, Banbury Road Oxford OX2 7DD Tel: 01865 280811/2 Email: [email protected] Web: www.admin.ox.ac.uk/ accommodation/\n\nRob Judges\n\nRob Judges\n\nWhere will I live?\n\n‘Living in college accommodation is a new experience for everyone; more grown-up than boarding and less full-on than living in a shared house. Everyone is apprehensive of what to expect and who they will meet when they first move into college but it is great that you will live next to someone studying something completely unrelated. The things you connect over are usually coffee breaks and the chance to talk about something other than the books you’ve been reading! When you need help though, friends from your course are always only a few steps away in college, which makes it easy to get together and sort through any problems or difficulties with your work. Living two minutes away from those on your course, as well as your friends, means that you should never be late for anything; tutorial, lecture, football practice, meal, or trip to the pub! Someone will invariably knock on your door to remind you, though it is a two-way street; there are times when you have to be on time to remind someone else! The friendships I made in college are those that have lasted the longest, and been the strongest. I have friends from many other colleges, as do all my friends from within college, but working, partying, playing football and pool with those in my college enabled me to get to know them better than any other friends I have.’ – Gareth ‘My college didn’t offer on-site housing for all three years of my course, so I had to live out in my second year. As it turned out it was a great opportunity to explore more of Oxford, as I rented a house with friends in Jericho, just a few minutes away from my college, and around ten minutes walk from the town centre. I think the year I spent living out was when I really became attached to Oxford as a city and not just as a university; it was fantastic to have a wider variety of bars and restaurants on our doorstep, as well as more greenery nearby. Living with five friends, who came from both arts and sciences backgrounds, meant that we never got bored of hearing each other moan or rhapsodise in equal measure about our essays and tutorials, good and bad!’ – Nina\n\nWelfare and student support Equal opportunities statement\n\nDisabled students\n\nChildcare\n\nThe University of Oxford and its colleges seek to admit students of high academic ability and potential. All colleges select students for admission without regard to gender, marital or civil partnership status, disability, race, nationality, ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation, age or social background. Decisions on admission are based solely on the individual merits of each candidate and the application of selection criteria appropriate to the course of study. Admissions procedures will be kept under review to ensure compliance with this policy.\n\nThe University welcomes applications from disabled students and makes reasonable adjustments to facilitate their access to its courses. Colleges and departments view applications from students with disabilities on exactly the same academic grounds as those from other candidates. Candidates are strongly advised, before applying, to consider the requirements of their chosen course and to identify any elements that might present particular difficulties. It is recommended that candidates arrange to visit the college and department of their choice to explore facilities and discuss specific needs. The University Disability Office is happy to facilitate or help with visits by individual students if sufficient notice is given. It takes time to arrange adjustments and to organise appropriate support so it is essential to make contact with the department and Disability Office as early as possible in the application process. The Access Guide gives practical information on access to University departments and colleges. The University’s Disability Equality Scheme is available from the Disability Office website. Students are advised to contact the Disability Office staff about arranging a study-related needs assessment and for advice on grants such as the Local Authority Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA). The University can provide audio recordings for students with visual impairments or Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD) including dyslexia. This is normally triggered by a DSA Study Needs Assessment. The University has a Braille production service and a range of assistive technology including screenreading, magnification and scanning software. Support workers can be arranged for students who require note-takers or readers. Special examination arrangements may be available to students with disabilities including students with dyslexia. On production of appropriate medical evidence arrangements such as extra time, rescheduling and wordprocessing, can be considered.

Each college and department has at least two advisers on harassment (one of either sex); the University also has a Harassment Hotline, Tel: 01865 270760. Email: [email protected] The Student Union can also provide information on harassment issues, and college JCRs have their own student welfare officers.\n\n17\n\nGraduate destinations What do employers look for?\n\nUsing your vacations\n\nFor entry to many occupations your degree subject, while important, may not be the main determinant of your employability. Of considerable importance will also be the range of transferable skills developed at Oxford, such as organising your time efficiently to meet deadlines and working well on your own, as well as in a group. Intellectual ability will be shown through your academic work, whilst your practical and social skills, of great importance in nearly every job, will be demonstrated through your participation in wider activities and interests. The opportunities to take part in activities and to develop your skills at Oxford are vast, and this is one of the reasons why Oxford graduates are so successful.\n\nThe Careers Service also offers advice and information on how to use your vacations to best effect. Year round vacancies for paid employment, work experience, voluntary work and courses are advertised. Some two-thirds of penultimate year students use the Careers Service and many of these make use of the vacation opportunities advertised on www.careers.ox.ac.uk.\n\nOxford University Careers Service The key to successful career search lies in finding out about yourself (your interests, motivations and skills), exploring options, making choices and then taking action. The Oxford University Careers Service has some of the best-resourced facilities and programmes of any careers service, including: n individual guidance discussions with Careers Advisers who are knowledgeable on a wide range of careers and know about the key attributes that employers are looking for; n n\n\nn n\n\nn\n\nn n\n\nn\n\n18\n\na Careers Adviser available most days for quick queries on a drop-in basis; employer presentations and talks on a wide range of career options by Careers Service staff and often alumni from different fields; practical skills sessions on making effective applications and interview techniques; a modern Information Room with material covering a wide range of occupational areas and employers, as well as work experience, postgraduate study and working overseas; online access, via www.careers.ox.ac.uk, to an extensive range of graduate and work experience vacancies; regular e-newsletters on forthcoming events; the Oxford Careers Network, which is an online database of recent Oxford graduates who are willing to be contacted by email to answer questions and provide information on their careers; and occupational booklets and numerous guidance sheets to take away, as well as a range of reference resources and DVDs. Much of this is also available on the Service’s website: www.careers.ox.ac.uk where students can register.\n\nAn investment in your future If you are wondering which universities have an excellent record for graduate employment, the figures for Oxford should speak for themselves. Despite changing economic situations, the employment record among Oxford graduates has consistently remained one of the best in the country, with our graduates entering a wide range of careers, regardless of degree subject. Many also go into further academic study or professional training.

The variety and range of opportunities presented by the role at Isis were significant in my decision to join the company. For example, my day-to-day activities might include visiting a researcher to discuss a potential project, meeting a business angel to discuss an investment opportunity, or drafting a business plan. As a Project Manager I’m responsible for the management of a product through its entire life cycle, from the initial thought through assignment of IP (intellectual property) rights to marketing and licensing/selling the product. My role includes networking with academic staff to identify commercially viable projects, liaising with legal experts to ensure that the IP is protected, performing market research, seeking out potential licensees, negotiating new licensing deals and managing existing deals. We also help researchers to spin-out companies, which involves setting up the infra-structure of the new company, identifying and securing early stage, seed and development investment, and supporting the company following its inception. At this stage in my career I see this role as an excellent opportunity to learn what it takes to start, develop and run a company, and who knows, maybe one day I will be running one of my own!’\n\n‘I graduated from Oxford in 2006 and now work as a Publishing Editor at Oxford University Press. As a Publishing Editor, I work closely with authors to ensure that they deliver the content as required and that they adhere to the schedules we suggest in order to allow our books to publish on time. I am also involved in market research and spend time out on campus talking to lecturers and academics in order to stay informed of any developments in my subject area. The skills I acquired whilst studying for my degree have proved vital in my subsequent career, particularly in terms of time-management, research and communication. As a history student I had to manage my workload carefully in order to meet weekly essay deadlines and balance other commitments. I also learnt to research topics which I had no prior knowledge of and to present my arguments in a logical manner, both written and orally. As Vice-President of my college’s Junior Common Room, I developed organisation and communication skills which have been vital in my job and also gained confidence when negotiating with academics. Finally, as a cox for my college boat club I developed leadership, decision-making and teamwork skills which are beneficial in any career. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Oxford and have gained valuable skills which will last a lifetime.’\n\n‘My employer is a not-for-profit strategic consultancy that works with businesses and governments to accelerate social progress. I’m based in our Geneva office and have what has to be one of the best commutes in the world: a boat ride across Lake Geneva, watching the morning sun glint off the side of Mont Blanc. I’m currently working with a large consumer goods company based near Paris: recently I was part of a team that helped it to review its corporate social responsibility programme, identifying a handful of social issues that it could make a difference on and that made sense from a pragmatic, business point of view. We’re now working with it to identify specific initiatives that will make this happen – we’ve already got a few ideas from some of their in-house experts in areas such as logistics and marketing. A lot of the data has been gathered through interviews with the company’s board members: interviews are the most common way that all strategy consultants, ourselves included, gather the raw information to analyse and base our recommendations on. I also have a case under way for a big US foundation working in public health in developing countries. Although the cases are very different, they both share the same “ingredients” of applying concepts from business strategy to increase the impact of social and environmental initiatives.’\n\n* First published in The Oxford Careers Service Guide 2008.\n\n19\n\nRob Judges\n\nStudent finance\n\nGreg Smolonski\n\nRob Judges\n\nStudying at Oxford is more affordable than you might think. College accommodation is reasonably priced and is available to most students for at least two years of their course. The food in college halls is of high quality, suits a variety of diets, and is reasonably priced. Even if you are living out of college, you can still eat in hall. The excellent library provision means you will not have to spend a lot on books. The city is compact enough for you to be able to get between your college, lectures and libraries on foot or by bike so your travel costs will be very low. Last, but by no means least, you will find that Oxford is sympathetic to the impact of the increasing costs of university for everyone and that there are considerable funds available through the University and colleges to help those with financial difficulties.\n\nLiving expenses The estimated living costs for 2008–9 are not yet available but will be published on the University website as soon as possible. As a guide, the living costs for an Oxford undergraduate in college accommodation in 2007 are expected to be on average, about £6,150 per year, based on the average projected costs given below: Accommodation – approximately £3,000 a year, over 27 weeks (standard accommodation in most colleges is generally within ±£200 of this figure). Meals – based on average college food costs, £1,300. General living costs – such as clothes, books, entertainment, £1,650. College rents and meal charges vary, so speak to your college of preference about what they offer and whether you will need to live out of college for one or two years. You will find some details on college web pages, and a contact number for more information. Costs will be somewhat higher for overseas students who are unable to return home during vacation periods. In 2007–8 it is estimated that an overseas undergraduate student spending a full 12-month period in Oxford will require a minimum of £9,750 for living costs.\n\nRegional funding maintenance grants and loans The funding available to students now varies by their region, i.e. England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Maintenance loans and grants are income assessed, however tuition fee loans are available to all UK students.\n\n20\n\nMaintenance grant and loan UK students from lower income households may be eligible for a government-funded maintenance grant. The grant is income assessed and the amount received depends upon which area of the UK you are from. Students from the Channel Islands and Isle of Man have their own support systems and are not eligible for UK government funding. General information on all the support available can be found at www.direct.gov.uk/studentfinance/. The maintenance loan has two parts. One part is not income assessed and is available to all students. An additional amount of loan might be available for those who opt to be income assessed, depending upon their level of income. The information provided here is based on the figures for 2008 entry. n England www.studentfinancedirect.co.uk The government has introduced changes which have substantially increased the income thresholds for students from England from 2008 entry. Students whose assessed household income is below £25,000 should receive a maintenance grant of £2,835. Income between £25,000 and £60,000 means you will probably be entitled to a partial grant. The maximum level of the student loan for maintenance will be £4,625. The non-income assessed loan is £3,470.

You should also be aware that it would be rare for an individual to receive support from several funds in any one year.\n\nOther University and college funding available The University and the colleges are very sympathetic to student hardship and are aware of the financial pressures facing undergraduates. There are considerable funds available for special purposes or for hardship, and the University and colleges are looking to extend these possibilities. Each college offers various financial awards and funds to its students; the amounts and type may vary, but include:** n\n\nscholarships and exhibitions – awarded after the first year for excellent academic achievement (scholarships c.£200, exhibitions c.£150); n tutorial prizes – for good, consistent work (e.g. £60); n study grants – towards accommodation for students staying in Oxford in the vacation for academic projects (up to £200); n travel grants – towards travel costs for a trip abroad related to academic work (£50–£300 approx.); n book grants – to cover the cost of purchasing books essential to your degree course (e.g. £50); n job opportunities – some colleges can offer part-time work during term and full-time opportunities to students during vacations, providing it does not interfere with their academic work (e.g. in college library c.£7 per hour); and n hardship funds – for students in financial need. These may be in the form of bridging loans or grants (£200–£1,000 with the higher figure only available in exceptional cases or genuine emergencies). The University has established links with organisations who provide bursaries in collaboration with the University. Students in receipt of the Oxford Opportunity Bursary can apply for these extra bursaries in their first year if they are reading eligible subjects. They usually receive £1,000 per year and have links with their bursary provider. Enhanced bursaries which were available in 2007/8 are listed below: IBM Bursary – Up to two awards are made per year and students are given the opportunity to undertake vacation work at IBM. Eligible subjects: Computer Science; Computer Science and Engineering; and Computer Science and Mathematics. Citi Foundation Bursary – Up to 15 awards are made per year. Students attend an annual event at the Citigroup Offices and assigned a mentor. Eligible subjects: PPE, Economics and Management; and Modern Languages (in the Oriental or Modern Languages Faculty).\n\n22\n\nMan Oxford Scholarship – Up to 15 awards will be made in 2007/8. Eligible subjects: Computer Science; Economics and Management; Engineering Science; Engineering and Computing Science; Engineering, Economics and Management; Materials Science; Materials with Economics and Management; Mathematics; Mathematics and Computer Science; Mathematics and Philosophy; Mathematics and Statistics; Physics; and Physics and Philosophy.

For more general queries, please contact the Student Funding and Access Office on 01865 270259 or [email protected].\n\nFinancial guarantees As in other universities, a person accepting admission to a college thereby accepts an obligation to obey the rules of the college and of the University, and to pay such fees, dues and charges as the University or college may lawfully determine. Colleges may therefore ask candidates, to whom offers have been made, for details of their proposed funding some months before the start of the academic year in October, and may require guarantees. This is the case for all students irrespective of their country of origin. It is not possible to fund your way through college with paid work.\n\nFurther information Further information for prospective undergraduates is available from the Government’s Aim Higher initiative: www.aimhigher.ac.uk. A free DVD about student funding is available to order or view at http://unimoney.direct.gov.uk or by calling 0800 5878500. Oxford also produces its own funding guide for undergraduate students.

If you are not currently in a position to make a competitive application, you may wish to undertake further study before applying. For further information about institutions offering A-levels or the International Baccalaureate in your country, you may wish to contact your local British Council (www.britishcouncil.org) or the International Baccalaureate Organisation (www.ibo.org).\n\nFees Undergraduate study is a significant investment in your future in terms of both money and time that will help you to progress quickly in whatever career you decide to pursue. Careful and thorough\n\nfinancial planning in advance is essential, and you must provide evidence of your proposed funding arrangements if you are offered a place at Oxford. You should make adequate arrangements to cover both the fees and expenses for the whole of your intended programme before leaving your home country. To read the University’s definition of those entitled to pay fees at the Home/EU rate, please visit www.admin.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate/finance/ clas.shtml or write to the Fees Clerk, Student Funding & Access Office, University Offices, Wellington Square, Oxford, OX1 2JD, or email fees. [email protected]. University tuition fees for overseas (non-EU) students in 2009–10 have not been decided at the time of going to press. Fee rates vary according to programme of study, but may be broadly categorised as shown below. For guidance, the fee rates applicable in 2008–9 are quoted in brackets: (a) BTh in Theology (£9,605) (b) Most programmes in social sciences, humanities and human sciences (£11,205) (c) Science subjects, including joint degrees, involving a laboratory-based element; Computer Science; Music; Fine Art (£12,810) (d) Clinical Medicine (£23,475)\n\nRob Judges\n\nOxford University has a strong international reputation. Over 10% of its undergraduate students and over 50% of its graduate students are from outside the UK with students from over 130 countries currently studying here. These students bring different perspectives to their subjects and contribute greatly to a stimulating academic environment. The University’s international reputation for academic excellence and its unparalleled libraries, laboratories and other specialist facilities are highly attractive to students from all over the world. Oxford’s colleges seek to admit undergraduate students of the very highest calibre and future potential, irrespective of nationality or other background. The University has a long experience of welcoming international students who quickly feel settled in both their academic and social life and are able to make outstanding contributions to their department and college. In a recent survey of international students at the start of their courses at UK universities, Oxford ranked highest for research and for its emphasis on independent, flexible learning.\n\nOnce finalised, University tuition fee levels for 2009–10 will be published on the University website (www.admissions.ox.ac.uk/finance/). In addition, college fees are payable. These vary between colleges, and are likely to be in excess of £4,800 per annum. Annual increases in fee rates should be expected.\n\nEmployment Undergraduate students are not usually permitted to take paid employment during term time, except possibly for a few hours a week working for your college, for example assisting in the library. However, you may be able to find full-time employment during the vacations.\n\nImmigration If you are a non-EU or non-EEA national, and you are offered a place, you must contact the British Embassy or High Commission in your home country to obtain entry clearance to come to the UK. To meet UK immigration requirements, you must provide: n\n\nProof of acceptance for full-time education by the University n Evidence of intention to return home after completion of study n Evidence of adequate means of financial support Further detailed advice and guidance is available at: www.admin.ox.ac.uk/io/ www.ukvisas.gov.uk n www.ukcisa.org.uk n UK Immigration Advisory Service – tel: +44 20 73577511 n n\n\n23\n\nInternational students and scholarships Further Information\n\nOrientation programme\n\nNoon/Oxford/OCSKET scholarships\n\nInternational Awards\n\nThe University’s International Student Advisory Service provides assistance and advice on a range of matters and also arranges an informative orientation programme that students arriving from overseas may choose to attend. The programme is open to all, guiding you through the practical issues that come with settling into not only the University but a new country whilst also offering the opportunity to meet other international students.

For more information: www.admin.ox.ac.uk/io/ funding/raffyman.shtml\n\nReach Oxford scholarships for students from low income countries (formerly Oxford Student scholarships) A number of Oxford colleges offer Reach Oxford Scholarships to students from low-income countries who, for political or financial reasons, or because equivalent educational facilities do not exist, cannot study for a degree in their own countries. A list of eligible countries is shown on the website. This scheme is only suitable for candidates of the highest academic ability who have outstanding examination results. However, financial need and social commitment are also major criteria for selection. The scholarships are valid for all undergraduate subjects except Medicine. The scholarships are fully funded through a partnership between various colleges, Common Rooms and the University. If your application is successful, you may be asked to transfer to a college that is providing a Reach Oxford scholarship. The participating colleges will not be finalised until early 2009.

This is not required for Course II, or for the Classics and English or Classics and Modern Languages courses involving a preliminary year learning a classical language. We hope that successful Course II candidates will be able to start on their chosen language after A-levels. The ideal would be to have reached GCSE standard in Latin or Greek on arrival.\n\n26\n\n3 If the candidate wishes to spend their third year of study in the Netherlands (studying European and International Law), then a modern language at A-level (or equivalent) is not essential since the course is taught in English.\n\n4 Students will normally be required to have at least a grade C at GCSE (or equivalent) in Mathematics or other evidence that they are appropriately numerate. 5 Candidates not offering Physics or Biology at A- or AS-level must either have that subject or dual-award science at GCSE. Candidates not offering Mathematics at A- or AS-level must have Mathematics at GCSE. 6 Candidates wishing to study Italian, Portuguese, Modern Greek, Czech, Russian or Polish can be admitted as beginners. Those not studying Spanish to full A-level (or equivalent) can be admitted provided that they undertake to reach A-level linguistic standard before starting their course in October. 7 See Music entry on p. 90 for further details.\n\nEntrance requirements\n\nInternational Baccalaureate\n\nOxford University is happy to receive applications from students from any country in the world providing that they are studying for, or have already achieved, three A-Levels or other equivalent academic qualifications. In order to be admitted, candidates must show evidence of an appropriate educational background and good standards of literacy and numeracy. However, the University does not have any formal matriculation requirements, and no requirement for any particular subjects or grades at GCSE, though tutors will use these grades as one indicator of academic ability. All applications are considered carefully on their individual merits and tutors consider academic achievements, predicted grades, candidates’ personal statements and academic references as well as any written work or written test that may be required as part of the application. Candidates who feel that they underperformed at GCSE may be able to compensate for this by demonstrating clear upward progression at AS-level as well as in predicted or achieved A-level scores. You may wish to refer to this in your personal statement. There are some specific subject requirements, as you can see in the table on the opposite page. Providing that you meet any specific requirements for your course, we recommend you to take those subjects that interest you most and in which you feel you have the ability to do best. Apart from the specific requirements shown, tutors are much more interested in candidates’ overall academic ability, and their potential and motivation for the course at Oxford, than the particular programmes which have been followed at school. Competition is strong and conditional offers are likely to be for high grades. The offer may specify certain grades to be achieved in particular subjects if they have not been achieved already. Further details on several qualifications are provided below. If you have any further questions regarding your personal circumstances, please refer to our website at www. admissions.ox.ac.uk. The University has reserved the right to require candidates to present their certificates for verification if it is deemed necessary.\n\nStudents of the International Baccalaureate would probably be required to achieve a level of performance of 38–40 points, including core points, with 6s or 7s in the higher subjects.\n\nA-levels Conditional offers for A-level students are likely to be AAA. Providing that any specific subject requirements have been met, all A-levels are approved for admissions purposes, with the exception of General Studies. Oxford University does not require its candidates to disclose information on the unit grades that have been achieved through their AS and A2 studies, but a candidate may include this information within their UCAS application should they wish to do so. Any conditional offer would usually be made on the basis of final grades alone.\n\nChanges to qualifications from 2008 There are significant changes proposed to existing A-levels, with the introduction of A* grades, Extended Projects, and also the introduction of Specialist Diplomas. Whilst this will not impact on entry in 2009, further information on Oxford University policy changes can be found at www.admissions.ox.ac.uk/courses/enreq.shtml.\n\nScottish qualifications In general, we are looking for a level of performance around grade AAAAB or AAAAA in Scottish Highers, usually supplemented by two or more Advanced Highers. Offers made to candidates on the basis of the Advanced Higher subjects are likely to be set at AA for two subjects, and AAB for three subjects. Applicants with Scottish Highers but no Advanced Highers are advised to get in touch with the Tutor for Admissions at their likely college of preference to discuss their application.\n\nIrish qualifications Conditional offers for students of the Irish Leaving Certificate would probably be for Higher or Honour grades of at least AAAABB.\n\nVocational qualifications Candidates with vocational qualifications equivalent to A-levels are welcome to apply although they may need to take additional academic qualifications to make a competitive application. For further information please refer to www.admissions.ox.ac.uk/ vocationalqualifications/.\n\nUS qualifications Successful candidates would typically have an excellent High School record supplemented by SAT I scores of at least 1,400 in Critical Reading and Mathematics and preferably also 700 or more in the Writing Paper, giving a combined score of at least 2,100, or ACT with a score of at least 32 out of 36. We would also expect Grade 5 in two or more Advanced Placement tests in appropriate subjects or SAT II two or three appropriate subjects at 700 or better.\n\nOther international qualifications Further details about different international qualifications can be found at www.admissions.ox.ac.uk/int/quals.shtml.\n\nEnglish language requirements All teaching at the University of Oxford is carried out in English (with the exception of some language-specific teaching"
