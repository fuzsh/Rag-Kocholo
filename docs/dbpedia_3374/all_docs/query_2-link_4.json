        "text": "Match Report By : Huntingdonshire CCC\n\nEssex off spinner is match winner\n\nTwo outstanding individual performances by players thwarted Hunts hopes of a second successive EEDC league victory giving them a narrow 21 runs victory in a high scoring match. Home skipper Harry Ramsden scored a magnificent century and as Hunts chased victory off spin bowler James Ellis-Grewell claimed a hat trick and a final tally of seven for 32 as he took all but two of the Hunts wickets to fall. The match was a credit to both sides and Hunts must be disappointed that their second best ever 50 overs score was insufficient to claim a win. The Hunts top order contributed well and with just 43 runs required from the last five overs they looked to be in with a chance. However Ellis-Grewell took four wickets for no runs in just seven balls and the chance of a memorable victory evaporated.\n\nWinning the toss Hunts invited their hosts to bat and having sent three of the top four Essex Batsmen back to the pavilion with just 42 on the board they must have been delighted with their start. However home skipper Harry Ramsden and Rehan Hassan put together a massive fourth wicket stand of 141 as the visiting bowlers toiled in the sun. When Hassan was out for 63 Essex were 183 for 4 with just ten overs left but the acceleration of the scoring rate in the final ten overs that produced a further 112 runs was to prove Hunts ultimate downfall. Ramsden added 55 to his score and Jonathan Das hit an undefeated 44 and when Ramsden was the last man out for 141 with eight balls to go the damage was done. Michael Kearns' early spell of six overs brought him 2 for 26 to make him the most successful visiting bowler but special mention for 15 years old Jordan Cafferkey making his senior debut and bowling ten overs for just 40 runs.\n\nHunts reply was positive inspired by skipper Michael Cafferkey who led from the front with a sparkling innings of 65 in an opening stand of 113 with Richard Atherton who made 45. When they were out Leon Le Roux took up the challenge top scoring with 73 and they was an outstanding innings from Ashley Rodgers who hit four sixes in his swift 42 from just 29 balls. However James Ellis Grewell who dismissed the top three Hunts batsmen was in the groove and his last three overs including a hat trick rendered six wickets for just eleven runs â€“ a truly match winning performance.\n\nCaption :\n\nAuthor : John Walker\n\nWebsite Url:"
