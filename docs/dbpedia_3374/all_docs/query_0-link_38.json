        "text": "Forum\n\nThreadFree kick laws\n\nat 21:48 26 Oct 2023\n\nA quiz question on the Chase today enquired, if a defender takes a direct free kick, passes it back to his goalkeeper who misses it and it goes into his own net is the outcome;\n\nA) Goal B) Goal Kick C) Corner. The answer might surprise you!\n\nCurious, I looked this up and found this Q & A’s for referees. Maybe in future I will be less critical of seemingly bizarre decisions made by referees!\n\n1). After a direct free kick is taken and the ball is already in play, one of the attacking players (Team A) encroaches within 1 m from a ‘wall’ formed by four defending players (Team B). A goal is scored by Team A directly from the free kick. What is the correct decision?\n\nWhere three or more defending team players form a ‘wall’, all attacking team players must be at least 1 m from the ‘wall’ until the ball is in play. It is not an offence if an attacking player encroaches after the ball has been kicked and clearly moved, so the goal is awarded.\n\n2). A defender takes a direct free kick and passes the ball back to a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper fails to kick the ball and does not touch it. After that, the ball enters the goal. What is the correct decision?\n\nIf a free kick is kicked directly into the team's own goal, the referee awards a corner kick to the opposing team.\n\n3). A player takes an indirect free kick. The ball enters the opponents’ goal without touching any other player. What is the correct decision?\n\nA goal kick is awarded to the defending team because a goal cannot be scored directly from an indirect free kick i.e. without the ball touching another player (of either team).\n\n4). When a free kick is taken, a defending player lies or kneels on the ground behind a wall formed by other defending team players. What is the correct decision?\n\nThe referee allows play to continue as no offence is committed.\n\n5). An attacker (Team A) kicks the ball when it is between Team B goalkeeper’s hand and the ground (inside Team B’s goal area). What is the correct decision?\n\nThe goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball so cannot be challenged. The referee awards a direct free kick to Team B to be taken from anywhere in the goal area. Any disciplinary sanction will depend whether the challenge was careless (no sanction/warning), reckless (caution/yellow card) or using excessive force (sending-off/red card).\n\n6). The referee stops play and cautions a player who committed a reckless challenge. The offending player shows dissent from this decision. What action does the referee take?\n\nThe player receives a second caution (yellow card) and is sent off (red card). Play restarts with a direct free kick to the opposing team from the place where the reckless challenge was committed (dissent occurred when the ball was not in play and does not change the restart).\n\n7). A player takes a free kick. After the ball is in play, the player kicks the ball again before it has touched another player. What is the correct decision?\n\nAn indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team.\n\n8). A free kick is taken quickly by a defending team player inside their penalty area. An opponent who deliberately remained in the penalty area intercepts the ball once it is in play and scores a goal. What is the correct decision?\n\nThe goal is disallowed and the free kick is retaken. Players who deliberately remain inside or enter the penalty area before the kick is taken should not gain an unfair advantage, even if the kick is taken quickly.\n\n9). While a free kick is taken by Team A, an opponent (Team B) is closer to the ball than the required distance. A player (Team A) deliberately kicks the ball at an opponent to play the ball again. What is the correct decision?\n\nThe referee allows play to continue - it is not an offence unless the ball was kicked in a careless or reckless manner or using excessive force, in which event a direct free kick is awarded to Team B and Team A player sanctioned accordingly.\n\n10). The referee awards a free kick but an opponent prevents the free kick being taken quickly. What is the referee’s decision?\n\nThe offending player must be cautioned (yellow card) for delaying the restart of play.\n\n11). Under pressure from an attacking team player, a defender deliberately kicks the ball to the goalkeeper. However, because the ball will go into the goal, the goalkeeper handles the ball inside the goal area to prevent a goal. What is the referee’s decision?\n\nAn indirect free kick is awarded to the attacking team which is taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line. There is no disciplinary sanction for the goalkeeper.\n\n12). A player took a free kick quickly, which was intercepted by an opponent who was less than 9.15 m (the required distance) away. What is the referee’s decision?\n\nThe referee will allow play to continue as the player took a risk (to gain an advantage) by taking the free kick when an opponent was still within 9.15 m.\n\n12. A player kicks an indirect free kick towards the opponents’ goal. The ball is touched by the goalkeeper before entering the goal. What is the referee's decision?\n\nA goal is awarded.\n\n12). An attacking player is fouled outside the penalty area but falls into the penalty area. How is play restarted?\n\nOffences are penalised at the point on the field where the offence occurred so a foul outside the penalty area is a free kick offence even if the player falls into the penalty area.\n\n13. When a direct free kick is taken, one of the attacking players (Team A) is less than 1 m from a ‘wall’ formed by four defending players (Team B). A goal is scored by Team A directly from the free kick. What is the referee’s decision?\n\nWhere three or more defending team players form a ‘wall’, all attacking team players must not encroach within 1 m from the ‘wall’ until the ball is in play. The referee will award an indirect free kick for the defending Team B from the place where the offender (Team A) was standing.\n\n[Post edited 26 Oct 2023 21:51]\n\nForum\n\nThreadColchester and East Essex return to second!\n\nat 06:38 17 Jul 2023\n\nA brilliant hundred and six wickets for Kiwi Adi Ashok ensured a crushing victory over Loughton CC at the weekend. Essex and recently Glamorgan Second XI batter, Joe MacGregor plundered yet another fifty, and eighteen year old Essex II’s batter Charlie Allison, smashed 33 after his midweek hundred for the County. Nothing remarkable about Charlie’s total, but it included five enormous sixes to take CEECC to a massive 320 for five declared. Loughton fell 166 short. With Chelmsford CC taking only 20 points and Brentwood losing, with 25 points from a win batting first, CEECC leapfrog back into second place in the Hamro Foundation Essex Premier League, whilst closing the gap on league leaders, Hornchurch CC that could only manage a draw. Now the competition is really hotting up, with CEECC well placed before we return to the 50 over format where they excel. We usually struggle in the longer (120 over, declaration) form of the game, but not this season.\n\nThis is (IMHO) THE best Colchester XI I have witnessed at Castle Park in two decades, and that includes watching England’s Reece Topley and New Zealand’s Tom Blundell. I predict Adi Ashok and Charlie Allison both have full international honours ahead, Ashok having already represented his country at U19 and A level. Charlie is just sensational in white/pink ball cricket and is yet to leave school.\n\nThe First XI return to Castle Park this coming Saturday to face third placed Chelmsford CC. Free admission, bar open all afternoon, what is not to like before and after the footy?\n\nThen don’t forget, 3rd to 6th August, the Colchester Cricket and Beer Festival. I have just seen the beer and cider list and over 90% are real ales that I have not previously tasted, which is the real deal when it comes to beer tasting events. Add craft ales from Two Brews and the First XI against currently third placed Brentwood CC, the “Silver Ashes”, and sensational covers band Cushti on the Saturday evening after the U’s beat Swindon at home. It’s going to be a blast!"
