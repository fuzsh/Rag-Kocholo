COMPILED BY ALGERNON GR AV E S. PUBLISHED BY MESSRS. HENRY GRAVES & CO., Printsellers and Publishers to Her Majesty The Queen and T.R.H. The Prince and Princess of Wales, 6, PALL MALL, LONDON, S.W. PREFACE. The purpose for which this Catalogue was first printed having passed, the compiler desires to make it of more permanent value to connoisseurs and lovers of the works of Landseer, and therefore has included the unengraved as well as the engraved works of our great artist ; he has added the more important subjects which are only partially known. This edition has also a separate index for the unengraved pictures, which can be distinguished by the absence of numbers. An index to the names of the various engravers is given. The compiler has embodied as much information as possible relative to each picture. The short descriptions and anecdotes are believed to be authentic, having been obtained direct from the parties named or from personal knowledge acquired in business transactions. Landseer was fastidious in his art, hence he left many sketches and unfinished works, some barely indicated, others more advanced. It is said of him that he would at times place a clean canvas on his easel and for a day and sometimes for several days let it remain without touching pencil or brush, until the entire subject had become matured in his mind, when he would com- mence to sketch and paint with extreme rapidity and precision. No doubt he laboured at the mechanical portion of his art in close study and drawing from models as other men have to do, but his best work was from within rather than from without. The humour, interest, pathos, cunning, and in some cases the ferocity expressed by his animals, did not come so much from models mechanically and laboriously copied, as from the revelations of genius, matured however by intense study of the originals. It has been said that his animals have too much of human expression, and this has been objected to ; but the abiding value of Landseer's work will be in this grand speciality, which distinguished him above all other painters of animals, namely, that farce, comedy, or tragedy, are to be found in some of his groups, and one or other in single subjects, which all classes of persons understand and appreciate who have the pleasure of looking at a Landseer picture or engraving. Haydon, in one of his lectures, stated that Landseer and Lance were both students under him, and to Lance he remarked, \" Still life will be your forte, you must be the Weenix of English art ; \" to Landseer he said, \" Study animals, and be the Snyders of England.\" Note. — Subjects marked thus * indicate that the Pictures or Drawings were exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, Burlington House, which Exhibition closed March 14, 1S74, and those marked thus f were the exhibited Sketches. Figures in parenthesis (139) are the numbers in the Royal Academy catalogue. CATALOGUE THE WORKS OF THE LATE SIR EDWIN LANDSEER, R.A, Born, March, 1S02. Died, October, 1873. 1.

The original picture belongs still to W. H. de Merle, Esq., who paid the artist £\"50 for it. On one occasion Landseer wished to see Liorf e\\cited. There chanced to be a live mouse in a trap. It was let loose. Lion gave chase, and in an instant the mouse disappeared. Where is it ? Has he swallowed it ? suggested someone. Nothing of the kind. The mouse had simply found refuge in Lion's huge jowls. The dog seemed much surprised, until his lips were opened, and out jumped the mouse, alive, uninjured, and able to run away. Lion was a splendid fellow, powerful as he was good tempered, but he would not submit to insult. Once walking by the side of a canal, a bargeman tried to tease him by poking at him with his oar. Lion seized the blade, and by a sudden jerk pulled the man into the water. The picture was sent to Paris in a large case at the time of the breaking out of the Revolution, and narrowly escaped being used for a barricade. Mr. Merle says that Landseer begged to defer painting the background until he had paid his first visit to Scotland. 81. The Angler's Guard — Mastiff and Greyhound Lithographed by W.

All that remains of the Gloryof William Smith Engraved by John Pye 1836 William Smith, being possessed of combativeness and animated by a love of glory, enlisted in the iorst regiment of foot. At the battle of Waterloo, on the 18th of June following, a cannon ball carried off one of his legs ; thus commenced and terminated William's military career. As he lay wounded on the field of battle, the <J\"g here represented, blind with one eye, and having also a leg shattered apparently by a musket shot, came and sat beside him as 'twere for sympathy. The dog became William's prisoner, and when a grateful country rewarded William's services by a pension and a wooden leg, he stumped about accompanied by the dog, his friend and companion. On the 15th December, 1834, William died.

Engraved by Thomas Landseer ^37 The picture, inhibited at the British Institution in 1834, was bequeathed to the Nation by Jacob Bell, Esq., in 1859. Mr. Bell gave the following account of the picture. The subject of this picture had been some two or three years waiting her turn for a sitting, and might have waited much longer if a misfortune had not brought about the event rather unexpectedly. She sometimes slept on a large balcony outside her master's room at Wandsworth. One moonlight evening she over- balanced and fell the height of twenty-three feet, and died in the course of the night. The next morning she was taken to St. John's Wood in the hope that at all events a slight sketch might be obtained as a reminiscence of an old favourite. It is an unpardonable offence to break in upon the retirement of an artist in that manner during his daily occupation ; but on this occasion the case was urgent, and at all hazards he must be brought out. The sight of the unfortunate hound suddenly changed an expression of something approaching vexation into one of sorrow and sympathy, and after the first expression of regret at the misfortune, the verdict was laconic and characteristic : — \" This is an opportunity not to be lost. Go away. Come on Thursday at two o'clock.\" It was then about the middle of Monday. On Thursday at two o'clock, there was the Countess as large as life, asleep as she is now. This subject has been engraved smaller by C. G. Lewis, and has recently been re-engraved the size of the original by J. C. Webb. 210. Prince George's Favourites ... ... Engraved by W.
