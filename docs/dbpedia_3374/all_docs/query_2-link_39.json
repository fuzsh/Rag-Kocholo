        "text": "Judging by the accounts received\n\nfrom time to time small-pox has made\n\ngood its footing in New South Wales.\n\nWhen it first appeared some six months\n\nago it found the authorities totally un-\n\nprepared. The statute book did not\n\ncontain any effective legislation on the\n\nsubject ; there was little or no vaccine\n\nlymph in the colony, and the means of\n\nisolating cases were defective. Efforts\n\nwere made to obviate the consequences\n\nof neglect, but the necessarily hurried\n\narrangements left a great deal to be\n\ndesired. At the eleventh hour the\n\nGovernment has invited Parliament to\n\npass a bill for more effectually pre-\n\nventing the spread of small-pox, and it\n\nis possible that its provisions may stamp\n\nout the plague. Although it is better\n\nto do right late than never, the action\n\nof Sir HENRY PARKES'S Ministry looks\n\nvery much like shutting the stable-door\n\nafter the steed has been stolen. Without\n\nventuring to say who is to blame for the\n\nwant of preparation in the first instance,\n\nand the delay which has taken place\n\nsubsequently, in asking the Legislature\n\nfor powers to deal vigorously with the\n\nemergency, we cannot avoid the con-\n\nclusion that very heavy censure\n\nwould properly fall in some quarters.\n\nIn such matters, want of precaution\n\nis a grave offence, against society, and\n\nwhen its effects are aggravated by in-\n\ndifference or want of administrative\n\nskill, there are good grounds for\n\npublic indignation. The authorities in\n\nNew South Wales have evidently failed\n\nto realise their obligations in this matter,\n\nand should small-pox become perma-\n\nnently established in these colonies as\n\none of the ordinary scourges of hu-\n\nmanity, they must be held responsible\n\nfor the national affliction.\n\nIt is our duty to see that we do not\n\ncome into a like condemnation. If we\n\nfail to learn from the shortcomings of\n\nour neighbours, we shall be utterly\n\nwithout excuse. They can plead that\n\nthey were, in a certain sense, taken by\n\nsurprise, while we have had daily warn-\n\ning for many months past. The great\n\nlesson taught by the rise and progress\n\nof small-pox in New South Wales is the\n\nparamount importance of being able to\n\ndeal effectually with it on its first appear-\n\nance, Are we in a position to do so ?\n\nThe answer must be, No. We are\n\nwithout the means of isolating patients\n\nunder favourable conditions, and\n\nthese are absolutely indispensable\n\nto a proper system of treatment.\n\nWhile we allow this state of\n\naffairs to continue, we go about almost\n\nwholly unarmed in the presence of a foe\n\nthat may spring on us at any moment.\n\nWe fear that those optimists who con-\n\nsider we are in no danger from the\n\ncontinued existence of small-pox in\n\nSydney, are living in a fool's paradise.\n\nHaving regard to the extent of the in-\n\ntercourse carried on between the two\n\ncolonies, and the utter impossibility of\n\ncarrying out quarantine regulations along\n\nseveral hundred miles of inland frontier,\n\nwe can scarcely hope to escape by any-\n\nthing less than a miracle. Yet in the\n\nface of what is almost a certainty, we\n\nfail to make the preparation which we\n\nknow to be essential to the safety of the\n\ncommunity. The Central Board of\n\nHealth has done all it can to secure the\n\nerection of a hospital for contagious dis-\n\neases. It has selected a site in a\n\nsecluded locality, and is ready, with\n\nmoney and approved plans, embodying\n\nall the latest sanitary appliances, to\n\nproceed with the necessary buildings.\n\nBut for some reason or other the\n\nGovernment withholds its sanction, and\n\nvirtually refuses to make over the land\n\nat Fisherman's Bend which has been\n\nchosen by the board as the most suitable\n\nof any available for the purpose.\n\nWhen questioned in the Assembly on\n\nWednesday last as to the steps taken to\n\nprotect this colony from the disease, Mr.\n\nGRANT read a report from the Central\n\nBoard, in which attention was drawn\n\nto the impossibility of completing the\n\nproper precautions until the Govern-\n\nment had arrived at some decision with\n\nregard to the land in question. The\n\nChief Secretary, however, did not think\n\nit necessary to explain the cause of the\n\ndelay in coming to a determination. Of\n\ncourse, we are aware that the muni-\n\ncipality of Sandridge objects to the\n\nestablishment of a contagious diseases\n\nhospital within its boundaries. But\n\nseeing that the site fixed on is peculiar\n\nin character and remote from the centre\n\nof population, the objection appears to\n\nus more sentimental than practical and\n\nvalid. We may be sure that if we wait\n\nfor such an institution near the metro-\n\npolis until we can erect it with the con-\n\nsent and approbation of every munici-\n\npality, we shall wait until the crack of\n\ndoom. We have no wish to see any-\n\nthing done which would injure property\n\nor endanger life, and should protest\n\nagainst any portion of the community\n\nbeing treated with arbitrary injustice for\n\nthe benefit of the rest. But Fisher-\n\nman's Bend is at present a sort of no-\n\nman's-land, and to prevent its utilisa-\n\ntion for an important public purpose is\n\nnot to maintain a legitimate right, but\n\nto indulge in selfish obstruction. It\n\nmust be remembered that the erection\n\nat Fisherman's Bend of such a hospital\n\nas is contemplated would not involve\n\nits maintenance in that locality to all\n\neternity. If at some future time the\n\nlocality should become populated, other\n\narrangements could be made.\n\nWithout going further into this part\n\nof the subject, we would earnestly press\n\nupon the Government the necessity for\n\na prompt decision. Other schemes\n\nhave been proposed which might be\n\nadopted as alternatives if the objections\n\nto the Fisherman's Bend site are\n\nheld to be absolutely insuperable.\n\nBut, so far as we can judge,\n\nthey do not possess the advantages\n\nwhich attach to that recommended by\n\nthe Central Board. It has been suggested\n\nthat the hospital should be built at\n\nPoint Cook, on the westside of the bay,\n\nsome seven or eight miles from Williams-\n\ntown. This spot would be much too\n\nfar unless a railway were made to it. The\n\nconstruction of a line, however, would\n\ninvolve a large outlay, and, what is worse,\n\nin view of the imminent danger, con-\n\nsiderable delay. The proposal to set aside\n\na hulk for the reception of small-pox\n\npatients commends itself to some people,\n\nbut we do not think that such a course\n\nwould be advisable. It appears to\n\nus that the objection to shipboard would\n\nbe so great in some cases that conceal-\n\nment would be practised in order to\n\navoid removal. Any arrangement that\n\nwould have this effect should be care-\n\nfully avoided, as prompt reports to the\n\nauthorities ought to be encouraged in\n\nevery way. So necessary is early in-\n\nformation to the process of \"stamping\n\n\" out,\" that it is questionable whether,\n\nas Mr. COPPIN suggests, concealment\n\nshould not be made a criminal offence,\n\npunishable by imprisonment. Once\n\nmore, we say, let something bo done,\n\nand done quickly. Our own opinion is\n\nthat the Fisherman's Bend scheme is the\n\nbest. Everything is in readiness to\n\nmake a commencement, and it only\n\nneeds a word from the Government\n\nto set things going. In the presence of\n\na great danger, Ministers should be pre-\n\npared to ignore local prejudices, and to\n\ntake the responsibility of acting in the\n\ninterests of the general community. If\n\nsmall-pox were to make its appearance\n\nto-morrow, and spread through the\n\ntown, as it probably would do, each\n\nmunicipality, under the act at present\n\nin force, would have to provide its own\n\ninfirmary. They would all be more or\n\nless unsuitable for isolated treatment,\n\nand together would provide some 15 or\n\n16 centres of infection. We trust the\n\nGovernment will not trifle any longer\n\nwith the public safety.\n\nWithin the last few years the Im-\n\nperial Government have made several\n\npraiseworthy attempts to regulate the\n\nrelations existing between the traders\n\nand adventurers who frequent t\n\nWestern Pacific, and tbe natives w\n\ninhabit the myriad islands which a\n\nscattered over that vast ocean, but t\n\nfrequont collisions which take pla\n\nbetween the two races demonstrate be\n\nineffectual their efforts have prove\n\nThe 'Polynesians would probably 1\n\ncontent if they were loft in und\n\nturbed enjoyment of their savage fre\n\ndom, but this is quite impossibl\n\nTheir labour is required for the develo\n\nment of the sugar and other promisii\n\ntropical industries of Queensland ut\n\nFiji, for the prosecution of ti\n\nlucrative pearl-shell and beche-d\n\nmer fisheries in Torres Strait\n\nand for many other purposes, Fe\n\npeople are aware of the extent to whic\n\nthe trade between Australia and ti\n\nPacific has already expanded. Betwee\n\n1871 a»,,}-\"1880, no less than 1,30\n\nvessels,J^tw aggregate tonnage i\n\n395,39r£ä-as, cleared out for ti\n\nWestern Pacific from New South Wal«\n\nports alone, and during that perio\n\nthe value of the imports receive\n\namounted to £2,147,858, and the e:\n\nports to £2,726,227. During the laf\n\nfew years the imports have average\n\nover £200,000 per annum, and the e:\n\nports over £300,000, the latter risin\n\nlast year to £367,441. Arma, ammuu\n\ntion, and liquor constituted no inconside;\n\nable portion of this large export trad«\n\nand to this cause may be partly attr\n\nbuted the growing love of the savage fe\n\nsquare gin and rifle shooting. Victori\n\nhas not participated in this semi-illegiti\n\nmate trade, but her commercial relation\n\nwith the Western Pacific are increasin,\n\nyear by year, her aggregate trade be\n\ntween 1871 and 1880 amounting ti\n\n£272,742.\n\nIn an article which we publishei\n\non the 12th ult., we described som'\n\nof the characteristics of the labour trad\n\nof the Pacific, and indicated grav\n\nabuses to which it is liable. It i\n\nfar easier to point out the defect\n\nof such a system than it is to suggest i\n\nremedy for admitted evils, but we ven\n\nture to assort that the experience o\n\ntiloso most intimately acquainted witl\n\nthe characteristics of the recruiting\n\nsystem would make thom agree almosi\n\nunanimously in urging the adoption o:\n\ncertain additional precautions, the mosl\n\nimportant of which we propose te\n\nenumerate.\n\nA good deal of authority is reposed it\n\nthe Government agents who accompany\n\nthe licensed labour vessels, and are\n\nsupposed to see that the regulations\n\nof the colonial Governments are strictly\n\nobserved. It is notorious that these\n\nofficials do not occupy a position oi\n\nsufficient independence. Their remune-\n\nration is absurdly small, and theil\n\nstatus is not sufficiently recognised to\n\nrender tbem above suspicion. Care\n\nshould be taken to employ only intelli-\n\ngent trustworthy men, proficient in the\n\nnumerous dialects in use throughout\n\nthe Pacific, and as an inducement for\n\nthem to perform their functions in an\n\nindependent spirit, they might be con-\n\nsidered eligible for promotion to the\n\nposition of consuls within the High Com-\n\nmissioner's jurisdiction. Â fruitful source\n\nof evil, and the cause of bitter ill-feeling\n\namongst the savages, which finds vent\n\nin the outrages which are so lamentably\n\nfrequent, results from the difficulty of\n\nreturning labourers to their own islands\n\nand villages at the oxpiration of their\n\nterm of service. Unless a Kanaka is\n\nrestored almost to tho exact spot from\n\nwhich he embarked, he runs an immi-\n\nnent risk of becoming a victim to the\n\nardent bead-hunters of some hostile\n\ntribe. If his life be spared, it\n\nis at the sacrifice of everything\n\nfor which he has toiled in the\n\ncanebrakes for upwards of three\n\nyeais. It has been suggested that the\n\nGovernment' agents should be instructed\n\nto prepare an enlarged plan of any\n\nisland from which a recruit is taken,\n\nwhile the master of the vessel should be\n\ndirected to enter the exact latitude and\n\nlongitude of the village to which the\n\nlabourer belongs in his log, so that the\n\nmeans of identification would be avail-\n\nable.\n\nAgain, the ignorance of many of\n\nthe Government agents of the dialects\n\nof the Pacific frequently forces them\n\nto seek the assistance of some of\n\nthe notorious adventurers who act as\n\nbeat-steerers or recruiting agents. These\n\nmen, from their greater familiarity with\n\nthe islands, are able, or profess to be able,\n\nto conversewith the natives. They accord-\n\ningly act as interpreters between the\n\nagent and the Kanaka, and of course\n\ncan conclude an arrangement nominally\n\nsatisfactory to both. They receive their\n\nfee for each enlisted native, but the\n\nlatter too late discovers that he has\n\nbeen grossly deceived. These inter-\n\npreters should not be allowed any\n\nadditional remuneration, and should\n\nbo severely punished whenever found\n\nguilty of holding out false in-\n\nducements to the natives. Another\n\nevil calls for prompt suppression. Ter-\n\nrible diseases have been introduced into\n\nsome of the islands by returned\n\nlabourers. The remedy obviously lies\n\nin a medical inspection of Kanakas\n\nbefore they are permitted to return\n\ntome. Employers should be forbidden\n\nto remunerate their labourers by\n\ngiving them firearms, and indeed it\n\nwould be well to carry the restriction\n\nfurther, and prohibit storekeepers and\n\ntraders from supplying weapons and am-\n\nmunition to this savage race. It is no exag\n\ngerotionto say that the oldnative weapons\n\nare disappearing from many of the\n\nislands, and being replaced with Snider\n\nrifles, whilo tho ammunition for this\n\nterrible arm is accepted as a sort of\n\nlocal currency amongst the New Ileb\n\nr'des and other groups. If the natives\n\nonly possessed the skill to effectually\n\nnae their deadly weapons, it would be\n\nfar more difficult than at present to\n\npreserve the semblance of peace in the\n\nislands.\n\nBut the system under which traders\n\ncan now obtain licences to recruit natives\n\nfor employment on board ship, as sea-\n\nmen, pearl fishers, &c, is open to even\n\nmoro serious objections. It is possible\n\nfor some of the most notorious scoundrels\n\nin the Western Pacific to obtain licences\n\nfrom one or other of the Australasian Go-\n\nvernors, who cannot possibly know any-\n\nthing of the character the applicants\n\nWay bear amongst the islands. It seems\n\ntous that arbitrary power to grant or\n\nto.refuso 8uch licences should be\n\nvested in some authority more fami-\n\nliar with the antecedents of these\n\nwen. It is probable that either tho High\n\nCommissioner or the naval officer in\n\ncommand of the Australian station, or\n\nboth, would exercise such authority\n\nwith better effect than tho ordinary\n\ncolonial governors. All masters holding\n\nlicences to recruit should be compelled\n\nto satisfy some official on the islands, or\n\nthe resident missionary, perhaps, that\n\ntho natives he has enlisted are voluntary\n\nrecruits, and on the return of the men\n\nthe same officials should bo convinced\n\nthat the contracts ontered into have\n\nbeen rigidly complied with. It is\n\nalso very necessary that the natives\n\nshould bo secured some fixed rato\n\nof pay, as well as rations and clothing,\n\nand that thoir hours of labour should\n\nbo regulated. Wo trust that these pre-\n\ncautions will bo adopted, and that the\n\nreproach of sanctioning a system in many\n\nrespects worse than slavery of the old\n\ntype will soon be removed.\n\nIn conclusion, wo may point out that\n\nthe Imperial Government have recently\n\nevinced a disposition to extend a larger\n\nmeasure of protection to British subjocts\n\nwho may have suffered from the out-\n\nrages of the natives of the islands. The\n\nnaval commanders have received in-\n\nstructions in coses where they are satis-\n\nfied that the natives have not been\n\ndriven by injustice or cruelty to retalia-\n\ntory measures, to promptly inflict such\n\nretribution as they may think desirable,\n\nwithout, as before, first reporting the\n\nfacts to the officer in command of the\n\nstation. The Admiralty have also\n\nsanctioned the destruction of native\n\nfruit plantations as a mode of retribution\n\nin extreme cases. These steps indicate\n\nthat the authorities have no wish either\n\nto be unduly lenient towards the mis-\n\ndeeds of the natives, or unduly harsh in\n\nthe punishment of offending British\n\nsubjects. They BÚnply desire to sea\n\nthe peace of the Pacific pre-\n\nserved, and that the honour of the\n\nBritish name is not disgraced by cruelty\n\nand oppression towards an unprotected\n\nrace of savages. Wo have of ton urged\n\nthat these results can only bo efficiently\n\nattained by establishing a description of\n\ninternational control over the South\n\nSeas, and we are glad to learn that Great\n\nBritain is negotiating with the conti-\n\nnental powers interested in the Pacific,\n\nwith the view of giving effect to some\n\nsuch scheme.\n\nThe members o£ tho Church of England\n\nmay be congratulated on tho measure\n\nof success which has already attended\n\nthoir efforts to place the Bishop of\n\nMelbourne in a position to claim the\n\n£6,000 generously promiaod to the\n\ncathedral fund by a gentleman who\n\ndesires to remain anonymous for a time.\n\nSeveral wealthy men have made hand-\n\nsome donations, and we feel sure that\n\nmany of the smaller contributions repre-\n\nsent equal, if not greater, liberality.\n\nBut it must be remembered that the\n\namount montioned waa offered under\n\ncertain terms, viz., that \"the sum of\n\n\" £25,000 additional to subscriptions pro\n\n\" viously promised, be raisod from other\n\n\"sources by tho 31st December, 1881.\"\n\nConsiderable progress haa boon made\n\ntowards the fulfilment of the conditions\n\nnamed. Since \" A.B.O.\" announced his\n\ngenerous intention, a total of £27,781 has\n\nbeen promised, of which £18,383 will be\n\navailable by the ond of the year. Bo\n\ntween £10,000 and £11,000 has been\n\nactually paid, and we may hero remind\n\nsubscribers who have not yet handed in\n\ntheir chequeB, that it is desirable they\n\nshould do so as early aa con-\n\nvenient. The time for realisation ia\n\nnow growing short, and it would be\n\nwell to avoid any noceasity for\n\nmaking personal application at the laat\n\nmoment. The figurea wo have given\n\nshow that while much haa boen accom-\n\nplished, much romains to be done beforo\n\nthe expiration of the period allowed for\n\ncollection. Over ono-quarter of the cash\n\ndonations required have yet to bo\n\nsecured, and strenuous efforts will be\n\nneeded to make up tho amount. It\n\nwould be a disgrace to the church if the\n\nyear should die out without leaving her\n\nin a position to avail heraolf of the assÍBt\n\nanco tendered on such easy terms by one\n\noutside hor communion. Any sums that\n\nmay bo offered will be thankfully received\n\nby the Anglican authorities, but wo ap-\n\npeal once more to wealthy colonists for\n\nsuch! gifts as will ewell tho subscription\n\nwith! the necessary rapidity. Is the roll\n\nof MILLERS and CLABKES q.ito ex-\n\nhausted ? When we find the Bishop him-\n\nself putting- down £1,000 towards the\n\nobject in view-in addition to former\n\ncontributions-is it too much to expect\n\nthatlton other gentlemen will yet be found\n\nto1 follow his self-denying examplo? A\n\ncheque for £10,000 on account of the\n\ncathedral fund would make the most ap-\n\npropriate and gratifying Chriatmaa box\n\nthat could be offered to the right rev.\n\ngentleman. Wo are sure that no person\n\nin the land deserves ono better. If\n\nYule-tide should bring with it complete\n\nprovision for the first half of his cathedral\n\nchurch, Dr. MOORHOO.SE would doubtless\n\nfeel, to his great encouragement, that the\n\n\"compliments of the season\" are occa-\n\nsionally something truer and better than\n\nmero empty words.\n\nIn the message which President AUTHUR\n\nhas just addressed to Congress, great pro-\n\nminence Í8 given to the stops which aro\n\nconsidered necessary to protect American\n\nlights in connexion with the interocoanic\n\ncanal which M DE LESSETS Í3 energeti-\n\ncally cutting through tho Isthmus o£\n\nPanama. When the sohome waa first pro-\n\njected it was contended by American\n\nstatesmen that it would be an infringe-\n\nment of the Monroe doctrine, and would\n\nprove highly prejudicial to the intoroats\n\nof the Republic, unless it wore fully recog-\n\nnised that the canal must be complotely\n\nsubject to the control of tho United States.\n\nThey appealed to the conditions of tho\n\ntreaty concluded in lcVlG with tho Go-\n\nvernment of Now Granada, now the\n\nRepublic of Colombia (through whose\n\nterritory tho canal will pass), by which\n\ntho United States guaranteed tho perfect\n\nneutrality of the Isthmus o£ Panama, as\n\nfully justifying thoir attitude of resist-\n\nance towards the claims advanced by the\n\nchief marítimo pon ora of Europa to parti-\n\ncipate in the political control of ÜIÍB impor-\n\ntant v, ork. Colombia, it seems, now desires\n\nthat the European powers should jointly\n\nguarantee the neutrality of the Isthmus\n\nand tho independence of tho Ropublic,\n\nbut tlie late Secretary of State for Amo\n\nrica, Mr. J. G. BLAINE, contends, and his\n\nviews havo been practically reiterated by\n\nPresident ARTHOTI, that the guarantee\n\ngiven by tho United States 35 yoars ago\n\n\" does not require reinforcement, acces\n\n\" sion, or assent from any other power,\"\n\nand in a diplomatic communication which\n\nho recently addressed to the Amerioan\n\nMinister in London, he remarked \" Any\n\n\" movemant in the sense of aupplemont\n\n\" ing this guarantee would neceasarllybo\n\n\" regarded aa an uncalled for intrusion\n\n\" into a field whero the local and\n\n\" general interests of Amorica must\n\n\" be considered beforo those oí any\n\n\" other power, Bave those of the\n\n\" United Statea and of Colombia alone.\"\n\nFortunately neither tho British Govern-\n\nment nor the Engliah press aro disposed\n\nto accept without question these some-\n\nwhat arrogant pretensions.

The Monroe de\n\ntrino hod been promulgated years bofo\n\nthe conclusion of this treaty, and if Amoi\n\ncan BtatoBmon raised no objection to ti\n\nparticipation of England in the control\n\na Nicaraguan Canal, it ig difficult to s\n\nhow they can consistently refuso her\n\nvoice in regard to the neutrality of\n\nsimilar undertaking vid Panama.

Mar]\n\nborough haB a representative who wishes t\n\nbe regarded OB an authority on subjects tha\n\nhave hitherto been looked after by th\n\nmembers for Williamstown and Footscray\n\nIn the meantime tbe nominal leader of th\n\nOpposition abstains from displaying anactlvi\n\ninterest in the business of the House, and ii\n\nrarely present in the Chamber after the refresh\n\nment hour. In these circumstances, it ia no\n\nsurprising to learn that the proposal whiel\n\nhas given BO mnch offenco to the Catholii\n\nliberals was not brought forward withou\n\nfull premeditation, and that a severance\n\nhas taken place between members who shan\n\nthe views broached by Mr. Patterson anc\n\nthe division of theparty which has not yel\n\nmade up its mind how to act. The organisa\n\ntion of a new party to deprive the Romar\n\nCatholic vote of its alleged undue propondor\n\nance in the country is what Mr. Patterson\n\nand his friends contemplate.\n\nThe'Harbour Trust Bill, aa it now stands,\n\nscarcely meets with the approval of the trust,\n\nwhich objecta to proposed changes in it!\n\nconstitution, and in tbo mode of electing\n\ncommissioners. Mr. Nimmo, M.L.A., how.\n\never, who was in charge of the measure laal\n\nsession, concerns\" himself chiefly With ob\n\ntaining three main points. Possession w11\n\nbe aeked on behalf of the trust of thf\n\nland necessary for carrying ont .Sir Johr\n\nCooele's scheme for shortening, the Iii701\n\nYarra, by a direct cut across Fisherman's\n\nBend. In the next place, Parliament will be\n\nrequested to give the trust power to borrow\n\n£500,000 for the execution of tho contem-\n\nplated works. In the third place, stress will\n\nbe laid on the necessity of validating\n\nthe ,paBt actions of the trust, which has\n\nbeen greatly inconvenienced by' defects in\n\nthe original act of 187G. The question\n\nwhether the allotment of commissioners to\n\nthe differentmunicipalitiea and the mercan,\n\ntile and shipping interests shall be varied is\n\nimportant, and diverse opinions are enter-\n\ntained as to the wisdom of altering the mode\n\nof electing the representatives of the City\n\nCouncil and suburban municipalities. Ko\n\nrequest has been made in tbe name of the\n\ncity of Melbourne for any alteration. It is\n\nonly suburban districts tbathave moved in the\n\nmatter. The Government intend proceeding\n\nwith the biUasitatands. Statementshavebeea\n\nlaid before the Premier, by the trust, of the\n\nviews entertained by the commissioners as a\n\nbody, but the Government think it better to\n\nrepard the amended bill as a compromise,\n\nwhich all have accepted, than to attempt to\n\nprepare a new measure. Mr. Nimmo ia in\n\nhopes of being able to present a case to the\n\nLegiBlutive Assembly on Tuesday which will\n\nconvince the one or two memberB who\n\nthreaten to stonewall the bill of the impera-\n\ntive necessity of facilitating the execution of\n\nplans upon which the safety of a vast amount\n\nof property depends.\n\nTho application which was gazetted last\n\nweek in the name of the Roman Catholic\n\nbody for a grant of the portion of the<Univer\n\nsity reserve set apart for that denomina,\n\ntion has been withdrawn, as it has trans,\n\npired that greater powers wero asked for than\n\nthe trustees wished or expected to obtain. Au-\n\nthority, it is stated, WEB given for the\n\nfirst portion of the application alone, and the\n\nrequest for power to sell or mortgage waa\n\nadded under a misconception. Copies of the\n\ngrant issued to the Church of England and\n\nthe certificate of title obtained by the\n\nWeBleyan body will be laid on the table of\n\nthe Legislativo Assembly on Tuesday. No\n\ncertificate has yet been taken out by the\n\nPresbyterians for the site of Ormond College,\n\nwhich is held under the original trust.\n\nIt is expressly provided in the Church of\n\nEngland grant (dated November 30,1881) that\n\nthe land is to be used exclusively for the pur-\n\nposes of an affiliated college. If this pro-\n\nvision is not observed, or if the members\n\nattempt to part with tho fee simple of the\n\nrand, or any less interest, the Crown\n\nhas power to resumo possession. The\n\ncertificate of title issued to the Wea\n\nlevon body simply names tho trustees\n\nand describes the site. The conditions undor\n\nwhich the land is held aro set forth in the\n\noriginal trust deed, which stipulates that the\n\nland may not be sold or mortgaged without\n\nthe consent of the Governor in Council. AU\n\nthe trusts are alike, and what tho Bonum\n\nCatholic body purpose applying for is a certi\n\nficate of title Bimilar to that obtained by the\n\nWesleyans.\n\nThe quarantine regulations with regard to\n\nveeeols coming from Chinese ports aro ex-\n\nplicit enough, but although clothed with all\n\nthe authority of the Government Gazette, they\n\nappear to be misunderstood or loosely in-\n\nterpreted occasionally. The Jerusalem, whioh\n\narm ed yesterday from Foochow, Bhould, in\n\ncompliance with the Gazelle notice, have\n\nbeen placed in quarantine, instead of which\n\nelie was brought up to the outer anchorage\n\nThe health officer, Mr. D. P. Maclean,\n\nordered her back to the quarantine\n\nBtation, huton strong representations being\n\nmade by the master that the vessel had\n\nbeen severely handled in a typhoon and\n\nsubsequently had been on a coral reef,\n\nthat she was crank in trim, and that tho\n\ncrew were well-nigh tired out, hepermitted her\n\nto remain at the anchorage. This permission\n\nwas conditional on the pilot, who brought\n\nher up, accepting the consequences of his\n\nact, and agreeing to submit to whatever\n\ndecision the Government might arrive at in\n\nthe matter. Mr. Maclean waa to report the\n\naffair to the authorities last evening.\n\nThe Government is desirous of securing an\n\nearly settlement of the remainder of the\n\nclaims for compensation arising out of the\n\nI Jolimont accident. With that view it ie\n\nintended to apply for a special sitting of the\n\nSupreme Court before the close of the year, in\n\norder that theactionB pending may be disposed\n\nof, A circular baa been issued by the Crown\n\nlaw department to the plaintiff ia each case\n\ngiving that intimation, and the matter will\n\nbo decided early next week.\n\nThe daily revenue retama at the Custom-\n\nhouse Bhow a most satisfactory and steady\n\nincrease. Yesterday they amounted to the\n\nlarge Bum of £10,515 Cs. 3d. In another\n\ncolumn we give an interesting comparison of\n\ntbe Customs returns of the United Kingdom\n\nand Victoria for the last five financial years,\n\ntogether with particulars of the cost per cent\n\nof collection in each country.\n\nThe Minister of Railways and Mr. Elsdon\n\nyesterday proceeded to Alphington, and in-\n\nspected the route of the suggested extension\n\nof the railway from that place to Heidelberg.\n\nThe necessity for this extension baa been\n\nurgently pressed upon Mr. Bent lately by the\n\nresidents of Heidelberg and ita vicinity.\n\nThe necessity for increased office accom-\n\nmodation in the Ballway department, espe-\n\ncially for the accountant's branch, has become\n\nmore urgent during the paat few months.\n\nThe accommodation for the clerks ia wholly\n\nInsufficient, and Mr, Boat has been endea-\n\nvouring, for Bomo weeks past, to nelect a\n\nsuitable Bite for new office buildings, ia or\n\nnear the Spencer-street station. Ko decision\n\nhas as yet been arrived at, but it is very pro-\n\nbable that the accountant's branch will be\n\nremoved to Flinders-street, a suitable site for\n\nthe erection of the necessary buildings being\n\navailable at that place.\n\nTbe question of lighting the Melbourne\n\nrailway stations and the departmental work-\n\nshops at Williamstown with the electric light\n\nis still under the consideration of Mr. Bent\n\n1 he cost of this light is looked upon, how-\n\never, as excessive, and unless some reduced\n\nterms can bo offered, it is probable that, light\n\ning by gas will be continued. Tho Williams-\n\ntown Goa Company has communicated with\n\nthe Minister, offering to light the local work\n\nshopa at a very much lower cost than the\n\nElectric Lighting Company.\n\nA telegram from Adelaide received yeBter\n\nday informed the Chief Secretary that there\n\nwaa still a mild case of scarlet fever on board\n\nthe mail steamer Carthage, bat that the\n\nvessel bad been ranted pratique. In conse-\n\nquence of the intimation, instructions have\n\nbeen ¡BBued that on her arrival at the Heads\n\nto-day abe ia to be taken to the quarantine\n\nstaion, and there examined, instead of being\n\nallowed to come np to Hobson'a Bay beforo\n\nthe scrutiny of the passengers is made. This\n\nwill not involve any delay if there is nothing\n\nserioua in the condition of tho patienta.\n\nThe tender of the Atlas Foundry Company\n\nfor the supply of machinery for five diamond\n\ndrills baa been accepted by the Government.\n\nFor two small ones the price ia £570, and for\n\nthree larger £1,260; and the contract Beta\n\nforth that one is to be supplied in 10 weeks\n\nfrom the acceptance of the tender ; another\n\nin 12 weeka, a third in 14 weeka, and the\n\nremainder aa soon afterwords as possible.\n\nThe Government steamer Despatch has\n\nreturned to Williamstown from the Heads,\n\nand ia now preparing for her periodical trip\n\nto the outer porta and harbours. During her\n\nstay at the Heads, the whole of the entrance\n\nfrom tbo Corsair Rock on the one aide, to\n\nPoint Lonsdale on the other, has been tho-\n\nroughly Bwept. Three hitherto unknown rocka\n\nliavo been discovered, and removed by the\n\nexplosion of dynamite charges upon them,\n\nand it ia now believed that all obstacles to\n\nnavigation have been cleared away from tho\n\nentrauco to Port Phillip Bay. When the\n\nDespatch ia again at liberty, the search for\n\nfurther obstacles will be resumed, with the\n\nvieyv of determining beyond a doubt that no\n\nother submerged rocka exist.\n\nSome correspondence has recently taken\n\nplace between tbe Railway department and\n\nthe Harbour Trust yvith regard to dredg-\n\ning at the Williamstown piers. In reply\n\nto a letter i from the secretary for rail\n\nwa)8, urging the neccsBity of this work,\n\nMr. * Ford, secretary of the Triiat, haa\n\nwritten, stating that the commissioners are\n\nprepared to accede to the requeat, pro-\n\nvided they are permitted to deposit\n\nthe 'apoiP in deep water, having hail\n\nthe powerful dredge Bunyip and.tyvo harbour\n\nbartses\"specially desigued and built for dredg-\n\ning in Hobson'a Bay. The hopper barges,\n\nwhich .alone coBt £10,000, not being suitable\n\nfor river work, have been laid up for months\n\nand their crews discharged. The material to\n\nbe raised from about the Williamstown piora\n\nia so aoft that if the Bunyip were put to work\n\nthere a very large quantity-18,000 cubicyarda\n\n-could be raised daily,' and this large quan-\n\ntity of silt could not be economically got rid\n\nof in any other way than by depositing it in\n\ndeep water. Under these circumstances\n\n' the commissioners ask for the temporary\n\nauthority of the Government to be given for\n\nthe deposit of the dredging in deep watara,\n\neubject to the result of the discussion of the\n\nquestion in Parliament, upon receipt of which\n\nprovisional authority dredging as required\n\nwould be at once undertaken.\n\nThe Tatiff Commiaaion paid a visit to\n\nGeelong yesterday, and inspected the local\n\nwoollen-mills. Some evidence waa also taken\n\nfrom representatives of the principal com-\n\npanies, who expressed the opinion that the\n\nremission or reduction of the protection\n\nduties would be injurious to those industries\n\nLast night the commission proceeded to Bal'\n\nlaxat.\n\nIt was stated yeaterday, with reference to\n\nthe accounts of the Board for the Protection\n\nof the Aborigines, submitted to the Coran-\n\nderrk Board by Captain Page, that Mrs. Bon\n\nand Dr. Embling were \"completely puzzled\n\nby tbo figurée.\" We are informed by Captain\n\nPage that the items which were not under-\n\nstood by these members of the board,\n\nalthough othermembera found no difficulty in\n\ncomprehending them, were the payments to\n\ntho employés, which covered irregular periods\n\nof time, and not the year exactly. The ex.\n\nplanation of the matter is that the accounts\n\nshowed the actual receipts and payments dur-\n\ning the 12 months, and that some of the\n\nemployés had not drawn their full salaries\n\nwhile others had received, in addition to\n\ntheir salaries, arrears from the previous\n\nyear.\n\nThe first meeting of the Education Com-\n\nmission is to be held on Monday afternoon\n\nat 2 o'clock at the Treasury-building. The\n\nbusiness will, however, be morely of a preli-\n\nminary character, and will consist of making\n\narrangementsforfuture meetings, and deciding\n\nupon the course of business which is to be\n\npursued.\n\nThe match between the Eleven of England\n\nand 'a represeutative eleven of New South\n\nWales was commenced yesterday on the\n\nAssociation-ground, atSydney. The English\n\nmen, went in firBt and remained at the\n\nwickets all day, having lost only Ave men\n\nfor 284 ruDB when the Bturaps were drawn.\n\nUljett and Selby played brilliantly, and\n\nBarlow, who exhibited his customary pa-\n\ntience at the wickets, was rewarded by being\n\nable lo carry his bat out at the conclusion of\n\ntho day's play, with 70 runs to his credit. Tho\n\nbowling was quite overpotvorod, but the\n\nGelding of the New South Wales Eleven waa\n\nvery fine.\n\nThe Australian Eleven of 1882 is to be\n\norganised on a somewhat different basis to\n\nthoBe of former years. The promotera com\n\npriae several gentlemen in Melbourne and\n\nSydney, who are to tako the whole riak of\n\nthe venture, and are to piok the boat available\n\ncricketers in these colonies, and pay them\n\nregular Balaries for their services. They com-\n\nmunicated in July last with Mr. Perkins,\n\nthe secretary' of tho Marylebono club,\n\nand , asked that 32 first - class matches\n\nmight bo arranged for the eleven in\n\nEngland. A special requeat was made that\n\nthree of these matches might be against the\n\nAll-England Eleven, BO that an ample oppor-\n\ntunity might be afforded of proving whether\n\nEngland or Australia could claim the cham-\n\npionship of the cricket world. A reply has\n\nbeen'received that 22 first-'cloas matches have\n\nbeen arranged for with 17 county teams, the\n\nGentlemen of England, the Universities, the\n\nPlayers of England, and the All-England\n\nEleven. The All-England Eleven, however,\n\nare only to meet the Australiana once lu\n\nthe programme. According to the telegram\n\npublished in The Argus of yesterday, the pro-\n\nmoters of the Australian Eleven are offered\n\nhalf the gate money, and the promotera in\n\nEngland are awaiting the acceptance of the\n\nterms offered. It is more than probable that\n\ntho former will accept them. The playera\n\nchocen for the Intercolonial Match were\n\nprevented from practising yesterday by the\n\nadverse weather.\n\nOn the subject of small-pox a correspon-\n\ndent suggests that the Central Board of\n\nHealth should publish a paper describing the\n\nsymptoms of the disease, particularly the\n\nearly stages, so that if small-pox should\n\nmake its appearance in Victoria, ita exiBtonce\n\nmay at once be made known to the proper\n\nauthorities. The cost of issuing circulara to\n\nthe different boroughs and shires for distri-\n\nbution, our correspondent points ont, wonld\n\nbe trivial compared with tho havoo the\n\nepidemic would make in this colony, particu-\n\nlarly in tho city of Melbourne and ita\n\nBuburba.\n\nAbout a dozen winegrowers from the\n\nvarions parta of the colony met yesterday at\n\nGunBler's Café, and having voted Mr. L. L.\n\nSmith to the chair, they formed themselves\n\ninto a society, under, the title of \" The Vic-\n\ntorian Winegrowers' Association.\" Résolu-\n\ntions were carried that \" the whole of the\n\nvines within the proclaimed infected district\n\nof Geelong should bo destroyed,\" and that\n\n\" it was imperative that a thorough inspec-\n\ntion of all the vineyards in Victoria should\n\nbe instituted immediately ;\" and Messrs.

Byrne.\n\nThe object of the suit was to have a declara-\n\ntion made that certain land in Russell-street,\n\non part of which the Duke of Wellington\n\nHotel is built, belonged to the estate of the\n\nlate Mr. Henry Donovan Brown. His\n\nHonour made a decree to the effect that the\n\nland did belong to Mr. Brown's estate, and\n\nmade an order accordingly.\n\nTbo following gentlemen wero yesterday\n\nadmitted by the Supreme Court to practise\n\nas barristers in this colony :-Mr. W, P.\n\nForlonge, Mr. W.

Mr. Fodongo is a gradúate of\n\nthe University of Melbourne, and Messrs.\n\nPhillips and Waterhouse are members of the\n\nEnglish bar.\n\nMr. JuBtico Molesworth gave judgment yes-\n\nterday in a suit of A li Moy v. Ohogg Goon, in\n\nwhich the plaintiff sought to restrain the\n\ndefendant from mining on some land at\n\nHaddon, which the plaintiff claimed to hold\n\nunder a lease from the Reform Gold-mining\n\nCompany. There waa already a suit pending\n\nbetween Chong Goon as plaintiff and the Re-\n\nform Company about mining on this and\n\nother land, and an arrangement had been\n\nmade by which Chong Goon was allowed to\n\nwork the ground, pending the hearing, he to\n\nreceive 70 per cent, of the receipts for work-\n\ning expenses, and the balance to bo divided\n\namong the parties pending the decision in\n\nthe suit. His Honour said that as there had\n\nbeen the agreement mentioned in the suit of\n\nChong Goon v. the Reform Company, which\n\nsuit was not yet disposed of, ho would not\n\ninterfere with that arrangement, and there-\n\nfore refused the application for the injunction\n\nin this suit.\n\nThe judges of the Supreme Court have pub-\n\nlished an order extending the Hilary term\n\nsittings of .the Supreme Court during the\n\ncurrency of the present month.\n\nThe sittings of the Divorce and Equity\n\nAppeal Courts were to have commenced on\n\nMonday next. Owing, however, to the com-\n\nmon law business in banco not having yet\n\nbeen concluded tbo Divorce and Equity\n\nAppeal Court has been postponed till Thurs-\n\nday neat.\n\nAn application was made to the Chief\n\nJustice jeBterdoy, as judge of the Vice-Ad-\n\nmiralty Court, in the case of the steamer\n\nFerret, to tender certain sums to the sailors\n\nn ho claimed wages from the owners of the\n\nvessel. Dr. Madden appeared for the owners,\n\nof the Ferret, and Dr. Mackay for the sailors.\n\nThe case was postponed till Monday next.\n\nThe small consignments of dynamite de-\n\nspatched from the hulk Empire to Dunolly\n\nand Heathcote, have now been destroyed. As\n\nsoon as thev dangerous character of the ox\n\nplosive was ascertained the whole of tho re-\n\nmaining quantity on board the hulk was de-\n\nstroyed. On ThurBday Mr. Cosmo Newbery\n\ndestroyed the four cases which had been sent\n\nto Dunolly, and yesterday ho forwarded a tele-\n\ngram to the Commissioner of Trade and\n\nCustoms intimating that he had success-\n\nfully, exploded six cases at Heathcote.\n\nWith reference to the telegram from\n\nLondon which appeared in The Argus yester-\n\nday, stating that MeaBre.

The state-\n\nment ia entirely without foundation. We\n\nwere1 in possession of the information for\n\nseveral days before the extradition warrant\n\nwas applied for in September last, and it\n\nwas only when confirmation of the facts was\n\nBought that the police requested that publica-\n\ntion should be delayed. Tho request was\n\ncomplied with in the interests of justice, but\n\nsufficient time having elapsed to enable the\n\nofficer who was Bent in pursuit of Denny to\n\nreach America, further reticence became un-\n\nnecessary, and with the consent of the prose-\n\ncution we published the particulars on the\n\nICth of November laBt.\n\nThe Olde Englishe Fayre, to be held at the\n\nTown Hall next week, is being pro\n\nmotcd under very enterprising management\n\nAVe hove received an advance copy of\n\nan elaborate quarto pamphlet of 134 pages,\n\nprinted in antique type, and called \" Ye\n\nBooke of yo Olde Englishe Fayre.\" It\n\ncontains a full programme and description\n\nof the proceedings, with numerous interest-\n\ning little articles, sketches, and poems re-\n\nlating to the matter and to kindred old\n\nEnglish Bubjects, from the pens of well-known\n\nMelbourne littérateurs.
