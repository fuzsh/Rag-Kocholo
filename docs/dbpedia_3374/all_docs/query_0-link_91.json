        "text": "There is no museum in Rosebud but there is a virtual one on the internet, mainly consisting of photos, namely:\n\nRosebud - Rosebud, VIC - History Museum | Facebook\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/rosebudhistory\n\nMore great history of Rosebud can be found on Steve Burnham's website which can be accessed by googling VIN BURNHAM, ROSEBUD. Vin was slightly out with some of his assumptions and was unsure of The Swedish fisherman's surname.Tony Durham was the grandfather, not father, of Judith Durham. Her father was William Cock, winner of the D.F.C. in W.W.2, who was serving overseas when Judith Mavis Cock was born in 1943. Judith's great grandmother, Emily, married a Greek fisherman, Tony's father, and later married Mr Durham. Emily's sister, Elizabeth married Fort Lacco, whose Rosebud Fishing Village block Emily occupied for decades. The Swede who took over Chatfield's fishing licence at Rosebud West was Axel Vincent. Steve has many photos on the website such as Hindhope (Holiday) Park on the Rosebud Plaza site with the Burnhams' fish shop across McCombe (sic) St, and the original footy ground on the foreshore.\n\nPeter Wilson's ON THE ROAD TO ROSEBUD also has many great photos. Peter was the grandson of Walter Burnham, whose house on the foreshore became the Sunday School at St Katherine's McCrae.\n\nOur churches - The Anglican Parish of All Saints Rosebud ...\n\nwww.rosebudmccrae.melbourneanglican.org.au/our-churches.html\n\nSt. Katherine's Church McCrae ... The cottage was relocated from the foreshore, opposite Boneo Road, and was bought from Mr Burnham for 400 pounds early ..\n\nThe first history of Rosebud was written by Isabel Moresby whose husband was descended from Captain Moresby who named Port Moresby in New Guinea.\n\nRosebud wins a name!!\n\n\"ROSEBUD, FLOWER OF THE PENINSULA,\" by Isobelle Moresby. 2/6 at booksellers and newsagents.\n\nA SHIPWRECK isn't always complete disaster. Had a schooner, prettily named, not been wrecked nearby, between 1844 and '45, (SIC, IN 1855) Rosebud not only might have lacked a romantic history, it might have been called Wooloowoolooboolook, the natives' title for their camp site behind.\n\nRosebud was owned by Edward and Edmund Hobson, who came to Melbourne in 1820, (SIC) and Luttrell Bros. (THEN JAMES PURVES who insured her for 700 pounds!) She traded to New Zealand, Tasmania, and as far afield as the Swan,in Western Australia, in 1838.The wreck was one of the sights of the bayside for years, her planks made fishermen's huts and fences, and housewives delighted in her salvaged damask.\n\nA later wreck, a Peruvian barque carrying Greeks and Austrians, at the same spot, provided from her castaways some of Rosebud's early settlers. All this and plenty more of local and tourist interest Mrs. Isobelle\n\nMoresby tells you in her brochure, \"Rosebud,Flower of the Peninsula,\" a welcome addition to the library of little neighborhood histories.\n\n-IRWIN MOORE (P.15,Argus,8-1-1955.)\n\nFOR EASE OF PARKING,EVEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE TOURIST SEASON,THE WALK STARTS ON THE FORESHORE OPPOSITE MCDONALDS. ENTER THE MIDDLE PARKING VIA THE FIFTH OR FOURTH AVENUE BREAKS IN THE MEDIAN STRIP. CLOCKWISE COURSE.\n\n1. ROADS AND DRAINAGE; PUBLIC FACILITIES.\n\nThe Kangerong Road Board was established in late 1863 to do something about the roads, reserved on the Kangerong, Wannaeue and Nepean parish maps, between Ellerina Rd and Portsea. Some of these reserved roads,such as Burrell Rd (the western boundary of Dromana Township) were never made because of steep terrain and Hiscock Rd, between the junction of Jetty/Old Cape Schanck Rds and Truemans Rd because it crossed the Tootgarook swamp. It was much easier to draw a road than make it! Roads had to cross creeks so bridges were required as well. Drainage was another matter that the road board had to spend its revenue on, not only because lack of it (blocked culverts etc) could ruin roads, but also disputes between landowners where water was diverted from a flooded paddock onto a neighbour's land, such as by Cr Henderson onto Watkins and Pidoto's land at Dromana circa 1880 and by Back Road Bob Cairns onto Robert Henry Adams at Rosebud in about 1905.\n\nBy 1869, most of the road boards formed at the same time as the Kangerong Board had built their own home, but for many decades, even after Kangerong merged with the Flinders board in 1874 to create the Shire of Flinders and Kangerong, the municipality rented accommodation at the Dromana Hotel and later the Dromana Mechanics' Institute. Why? Lack of revenue!\n\nMost of the ratepayers in what we call Rosebud lived in the Rosebud Fishing Village and ratebooks show that none of these paid rates until 1873, the first assessment after the Village was declared. The land across the beach road between Adams Avenue and Boneo Avenue, referred to as Wannaeue (the parish name)was owned at that time by five men with Cr William Ford owning the 660 acre Wannaeue Station between Ford's Lane (Eastbourne Rd) and the never-made Hiscock Rd beside the Drum Drum Alloc Creek.\n\nFarm land had a very low nett annual value which would almost double if even the most basic house was built on it. Because of bad roads and distance from markets, farming was basically of the subsistence variety. Most farmers relied on off-farm income such as timber getting near Arthurs Seat,lime burning near Boneo Rd and farther west, employment on the big stations and road maintenance to garner enough money to buy items they couldn't grow themselves-such as clothing, willow pattern crockery and horses,and of course to pay their rates.\n\nThus revenue was very low and most of it went to paying for roads, bridges and drainage. Services such as Melbourne residents came to expect, such as rubbish and sanitary collections were out of the question. Recreational facilities were completely out of the question! At Dromana, reserves were proclaimed near the Dromana Secondary College site (serving as one of the two racecourses) and on the Bowling Club (showgrounds)and Court/Information Centre (Soldiers' Memorial Park) sites; the other racecourse and the footy ground were behind the Dromana Hotel on two private 17 acre parcels owned by the Pidoto and hotel families.At Rye, cricket was played on Mrs Hill's paddock near the original post office, and on the foreshore where the Australia Day Celebrations are held according to the late Ray Cairns.\n\nNo privately owned land seemed to have been offered at Rosebud. The Rosebud public golf course land had been reserved for public recreation, as was a small block on the north side of Waterfall Gully Rd near the waterfall, but these were too far from Rosebud to be of much value. The shire could not afford to buy any land but land had been reserved on the foreshore for recreational purposes and council enthusiastically supported any requests from residents for the government to supply land for public facilities. The Mechanics'Institute site on crown allotment 15 of the fishing village was gazetted in 1874 but rapid development of Rosebud after W.W.2 saw the need for a bigger hall as well as a bowling green,yacht club and motor boat squadron. The carnival helped to pay for the soldiers' memorial hall.\n\nCrown Land Sought At Rosebud.\n\nMr Galvin, Minister for Lands, was asked yesterday by a deputation from Rosebud and surrounding seaside centres for an acre of Crown land, close to the Rosebud Recreational Reserve, for the erection of public utilities, including a hall, library, and infant welfare centre.\n\nHe was opposed to the alienation of the people's land unless it could be proved that the use of the land by\n\nthe public would not be stopped, Mr Galvin said, however, he would inspect the area.\n\n(P.2, Argus, 28-3-1946.)\n\nBOWLING GREEN AT ROSEBUD\n\nA notification was received by Flinders Shire from the Rosebud Foreshore Trust, that it desired to construct a bowling green on the foreshore. Cr. Wood said the approximate cost was £800 to £1000. The new green was essential and would improve Rosebud greatly. A Resolution was carried that,in the opinion of the Council,\n\nthere was nothing to prevent the Trust from establishing a green.(P.16,Standard,10-7-1947.)\n\n2.VILLAGE GREEN.\n\nThe foreshore land west of the Rosebud Fishing Village was permanently reserved for Public Purposes, gazetted in 1923. This seems to have extended to the outlet of Chinaman's Creek which had originally entered the Bay opposite the Rosebud Hospital site until Ned Williams of \"Eastbourne\" cut the present channel.\n\nThe interrupted Cricket Grand Final.\n\nThe first camping at Rosebud was on the Clemengers' \"Parkmore\". The mansion was built in 1896 by Albert Holloway and accommodation was at first within the building before the Clemengers bought Parkmore in 1908.\n\nSEASIDE -MANSION HOME paying guests,every comfort, fishing, shooting, bathing.\"Parkmore\" Rosebud near Dromana.\n\n(P.12,Argus, 11-2-1903.)\n\nRobert Henry Adams' Hopetoun House (McCrae Car Wash site) offered similar accommodation.\n\nBased on crown allotment 17 subdivision information, Parkmore was on 10 acres of grounds so there would have been plenty of room for campers.\n\nROSEBUD.-\"PARKMORE,\" excellent TENT Accommodation, every convenience. Mrs.Clemenger, Central, 3138._Write for particulars.(P.23,Argus,22-10-1910.)\n\nBecause of the 1890's depression and its after-effects, and inadequate descriptions of properties, the shire of Flinders was almost bankrupt by 1912. Seeing Parkmore's success,the shire must have sought government approval for camping on the foreshore. The only problem would have been a lack of cleared areas to pitch tents.\n\nSEASIDE CAMPS\n\nInquiries as to seaside camps come from \"K.McD. (Clifton Hill) Camping in Mornington Shire is I understand, not encouraged, but Flinders shire, farther south, has no objection to campers, rather encourages them. There are good sites from Dromana on past Rosebud, to Portsea, and permission should be sought from the secretary of the shire or the local constable who supervises the camps. A small fee is charged, so that camps may be supervised and sanitary precautions imposed. (NOTES FOR BOYS. P.7,Argus,12-11-1918.)\n\nThe progress association would soon take care of that. You can't have trees on a sports ground!\n\nThere is marked evidence of progress in this line seaside resort on the eastern shores of the bay. An active progress association is helping considerably in the scheme of development, and much useful work will have been accomplished within the next year or two. Some of the ideas of practical value which will then have come into existence include a boat harbour for the shelter of yachts and fishing craft, the forming of an ornamental promenade running parallel with the foreshore, and the acquirement of a sports ground.\n\n(P.11, Argus, 10-11-1927.)\n\nROSEBUD.\n\nThe final cricket match of the S.P.C. Association, between Dromana and Red Hill, being played on the Rosebud Recreation Oval, has reached a most interesting stage. It now looks as if Red Hill may win the premiership. The game was well patronised by the public, again showing how popular cricket is down this end of the Peninsula, although the only admission fee asked for has been a silver coin to cover expenses, just on £35 has gone into the funds of the S.P.C.A. for the semi-final and final played at Rosebud. The ground was in perfect order. Scores-Dromana, 2nd innings, all out, 196; Red Hill, 2nd Innings, 1 for 91. This leaves Red Hill about 63 runs to win. On account of next Saturday being Easter Saturday, no play will take place on that day.\n\nThe local football club is rather anxious to see the end of the cricket match at Rosebud as they cannot get full use of the oval on account of the cricket pitch not being able to be covered. (P.6, Standard, 17-4-1946.)\n\nJust in case you thought the game wasn't continued on Easter Saturday because of religious reasons, I'd better add this.\n\nAs the Oval at Rosebud will not be available on Easter Saturday, play will not be resumed until April 27.\n\nRed Hill correspondent (same page,same paper.)\n\nROSEBUD FORESHORE COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT.\n\nRosebud residents asked the shire to transfer control of the foreshore to a local committee (article probably in my shire of Flinders journal)which was first mentioned in 1944.\n\nROSEBUD FORESHORE COMMITTEE .\n\nThe following is the audited statement of receipts and expenditure for the Rosebud Foreshore Trust for the\n\nyear ending 30/6/44:\n\nReceipts: Balance at 1/7/43, £21516/2; fees, camping, £1434/3/; bathing boxes and boat houses, £190/4/3;\n\nrecreation ground, £14/14/; tennis court, £91/16/; -residential, £10; sale of bathing box, £1/10/; sale of\n\nfirewood, £10/5/; deposit firewood,£10; total, £1978/8/5.,\n\nExpenditure: Permanent works conveniences, water, etc., £601/5/; maintenance materials, £70/5/10; salaries and.wages, £300/7/5; lighting, £45/14/; sanitary and garbage,.£117/4/6; loan redemption, £1431/6; water rates, £36/12/6; printing and stationary, £4/10/7; petty cash,£7; insurance, £4/19/6; bank charges, £2/4/9; miscellaneous, £211/6; . balance, £433/11/4; total,£ 1978/8/5. (P.2, Standard, 7-9-1944.)\n\nIt is likely that foreshore camping had first been on the footy ground but the ground was most likely reserved for sporting use by the campers in 1946, rather than being full of tents as I initially thought. The public works department was doing its part in spreading the campers out.\n\nROSEBUD.\n\nROSEBUD FORESHORE.\n\nThe Public Works Department is now carrying out certain works on the foreshore. The Foreshore Committee has found £500 towards these Works. They consist of lavatories containing the usual conveniences, showers and wash basins, laundry blocks, fire places and office buildings. Cement (colored amber), bricks on granite stone is the material used, and give quite an imposing appearance. The laundry blocks, of which one is nearing completion, are of doubtful blessing, and are, in fact,not favored by the committee, but the Tourist Bureau is warm about them. Why the committee is dubious is the possibility of destruction of timber for firewood. As it is, the danger of extensive destruction to the existing timber, through the campers, has to be most carefully guarded against. The erection of two lavatories ,between the township and McCrae should spread the campers, also another is to be erected some 200 yards west of Boneo Road.\n\nThe next, and just as urgent, need is for the local butcher to institute a better method of meat distribution.\n\nTo force campers spread over three miles to congregate at one shop in Rosebud, at the same time refusing to\n\nsupply orders for the local inhabitants, is a matter that will require the attention of the committee and the\n\ntwo councillors. (P.5, Standard, 15-6-1944.)\n\nScout Hall dressing rooms.\n\nI have been told that the scout hall was originally the change room for the footballers.\n\nFooty 1929-two blues.\n\nPhotos in the Olympic Park clubrooms show that Rosebud's first footy team, in 1929, wore the present jumper modelled on the Carlton jumper,the suggestion of fisherman Tom Alderson, an enthusiastic supporter of the Blues. Shortly afterwards,apparently just for one season,the club wore a jumper with dark blue at the top and light blue on the bottom. This was the result of old Mr Dark complaining that the Rosebud players were too hard to see in the last quarter. The photo showing this jumper is in black and white but match reports refer to Rosebud as the Two Blues.\n\nRoad widening. Pt Nepean Rd was widened in 1963*. The foreshore ground was so reduced in size that the football and cricket clubs had to move to the new ground at Olympic Park. An aerial photo of the foreshore ground is on Steve Burham's website.\n\n(*rosebud activity centre urban design framework august 2012\n\nwww.mornpen.vic.gov.au/.../Rosebud_Activity_Centre_Urban_Design_...)\n\n3.

Bachli who are living in Canberra now, revisited friends in Shepparton yesterday.\n\n(P.4, Shepparton Advertiser, 9-7-1937.)\n\nDoug was already a good golfer by 1938 when he was second,by three strokes in Canberra's Federal Cup.\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, Peter Wilson said in ON THE ROAD TO ROSEBUD that the Rosebud Hotel opened in 1941 so Doug's father, who obviously preferred his second given name, must have been the first licensee. Being able to indulge his love of the Sport of Kings may have been the clincher in bringing the family to Rosebud,but having the footy ground directly across the road from the pub for Doug to practise his golf would have been another powerful argument.\n\nHOTEL ROSEBUD.-First class accommodation. H. and C. water bedrooms. Phil Bachli. licensee.\n\n(P.11,Argus,16-4-1941.)\n\nTHEIR CUP WAS FULL.\n\nCelebrations at Patron Park Stud, Rosebud, on Saturday, had nothing to do with Peshawar. Caulfield Cup day just\n\nhappens to be a pretty good day for the stud. For instance, the brood mare Standsure had a filly foal by Carbon Copy on Saturday. The last foal she had was on Caulfield Cup day in 1948. Patron, the stud's sire, was presented with his first foal on Saturday and On Caulfield Cup day in 1948, Doug Bachli, owner of the stud, won the Australian amateur golf championship. -JIM SHANNON. (P.9, Argus,22-10-1952.)\n\nIF DOUG BACHLI had not been a great golfer he might have been an Olympic swimmer or a champion footballer.\n\nNot one of his family had ever been interested in golf. As a boy Doug lived in Sandringham, and it was not surprising that he became a swimmer. When he was only 12 he won a Victorian championship in record time at the Brunswick Baths.\n\nThe family later moved to Canberra, where Doug continued his swimming successes, which included records in the combined high schools of NSW and the junior and senior backstroke records at Canberra when aged 14 and 15.\n\nIn 1936 Doug shone at football. He was a member of the Canberra team that played in the Australian schoolboys' carnival in Adelaide, where he gained the honour of best and fairest player.\n\nHe started golf when he was 14, only because he had heard men talking at his home about the game. It was not long before he came home to tell his father that he had broken 100. \"Dad said that he would have to see me in action,\" said Doug. \"He then arranged for me to take lessons from Jim Tetterson, then, and still,professional at Royal Canberra. While I was still 14 I won the Canberra Cup with a handicap of 20, and with off-the-stick scores of 86 and 83. Next year I won it again, but then I was down to a handicap of nine, and had scores of 76, 76.\"\n\nDoug returned to Victoria when 17, and joined Victoria and Sorrento clubs, playing pennant with Victoria\n\noff scratch. Later he went out to plus 2. After winning various club titles with record figures, Doug entered for the Australian championship at Metropolitan last year, and, with a seven and six margin in the final, took the title. He and Bob Brown also won the Australian foursomes with a record 69 at the same course. The\n\nVictorian championship followed, but Peter Thomson beat Doug in the final at Woodlands. Early this season Doug won the Sorrento open with a record 69-66, cracking the record that had been held for 10 years. He has not been\n\nso conspicuous in recent months, being unable to practise because of the illness of his mother and father\n\nat their hotel at Rosebud.\n\nThe next item is the Victorian title, to be played this month, and Doug is out to regain it. Still in the early 20's, he should be a power in the golf world for years. (P.5s, Argus,15-10-1949.)\n\nBIG CHANCE IN BRITISH TITLE\n\nBy JACK DILLON\n\nTHERE is something exhilarating about a fellow who can step back and look at himself with the same unstinted pleasure he would display if his best friend was as worthy of commendation as he is himself. Such a one is Douglas Bachli, 32-year old refrigeration sales manager, former school star swimmer and footballer, who\n\ntoday at Muirfield meets American \"Big Bill\" Campbell in the final of the British amateur golf championship.\n\nI believe, despite the strong opponent, that Bachli has at least an even chance of bringing the title to\n\nAustralia for the first time.\n\nBachli won the Australian amateur championship in 1948, the Victorian title 1949, 1950 and 1953,the\n\nQueensland championship 1948, the A.C.T. amateur title twice and dozens of open and club competitions. But\n\n31-years-old \"Big Bill\" Campbell is a formidable opponent. He won the \"world's\" amateur championship at\n\nChicago 1948 and 1949 and was runner-up 1952. Thrice he has reached the British amateur sixth\n\nround, and semi-finalist in the U.S. amateur of 1949 and in the past three Walker Cup internationals\n\nhas represented America against Britain.\n\nThere are no pawky inhibitions about Doug. He looks you fair in the face to talk or tell, and he loves talking\n\nabout the things he likes best—work, racing, football, swimming, his pals, his and their golf,and. of course.\n\nDoug. As far as I know no one else in these parts has won as many trophies in golf—plus quite a few in other\n\nparts. Like the human being he is, Doug is properly proud of that collection.\n\nBefore his father's death, when they had a hotel in Rosebud, there was a huge display case in the dining room—and those rewards for play prowess were there for all to see. Among Doug's many friends is a prominent poster\n\nartist. No difficulty was placed in his way when he sought to make a life-size painting of his friend. There's nothing of the exhibitionist about Doug. If there was he wouldn't have the army of admirers he has. But he is a realist and with equal ease can reel off his own plus and minus points with the facility he summarises his\n\nlatest round of golf. Bachli goes at his golf as he does for everything else, directly, cleanly, determinedly,\n\nefficiently and without any trimmings of style, mannerisms or temperament. You cannot fault his shot-making\n\nmethods in detail or over-all, for they are quite orthodox.(etc.)(P.9, Sporting Globe, 29-5-1954.)\n\nPhil's father, William, died in Canberra in 1938.\n\nFamily Notices\n\nThe Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957) Tuesday 5 April 1938 p 10 Family Notices\n\nBACHLI.—On the 3rd April, 1938, at Canberra, late of Dundas place, Albert Park, William, relict of the late Agnes Bachli, and loved father of Alfred, Violet (Mrs. H.

When the stud was being established Doug was rarely on a golf course* which made his progress even more remarkable; perhaps he kept in form on the footy ground a stab kick away from the Rosebud Hotel.Phil transferred the licence for the Rosebud hotel to the Bakers only months before his death. When he beat Campbell for the British Amateur title, he was a refrigeration sales manager but by 1956 he had returned to hotel-keeping. His wife, Dorothy, was from Camberwell and three years after they wed she was still only 5 minutes by train (on the Lilydale line)from her old home. I believe Frank Bachli of Ararat circa 1916 was William Bachli's brother. I couldn't re-find the article but I think Frank called one of his sons \"Deed\" as well, as did a K.Bacchli later; what a strange pet name!\n\n(*Also when Phil became ill.\n\nBachli, who has been working on his father's stud farm this year, was playing only his fourth competitive\n\nround for the season,(but was equal leader with Peter Thompson on 68 strokes.)P.10,Argus,5-10-1951.\n\nMr. DOUGLAS WILLIAM BACHLI, former Australian Amateur Golf Champion, and Mrs.Bachli (above), at the reception last night after their marriage in Our Lady of Victories' Church, Camberwell.

It is being built to provide for the growing holiday population which concentrates at this favourite seaside resort during vacation periods. A strong committee has been working for some considerable time to raise funds for the project which is to be undertaken by a local architect and builder. Up to now Mass on Sundays has been celebrated in the Mechanics' Hall.

Mr. Inchbold, Education Minister, said this yesterday.\n\nHe was hearing a deputation from Flinders Shire and Mornington Peninsula State schools.The deputation said that the Government had bought a 14 acre site for the school in 1944, but nothing had been done.Mr. Inchbold said the proposed new school should be finished by January, 1953.It would have 38 classrooms to accommodate 400 children, and would cater for all branches of high, technical, and commercial education.(P.7,Argus, 21-7-1950.)\n\nROSEBUD SECONDARY CELEBRATED ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY ON 21-3-2015.\n\nLOTUS LODGE.\n\nSTATE BUYS \"MOTEL\" FOR AGED\n\nSeaside village will be home of 250 old Victorians\n\nVICTORIA'S first self-contained community settlement for the aged will be established at Rosebud; the first of 250 tenants will probably move in in July.\n\nThe settlement will be at Lotus Lodge, an ultra-modern \"motel,\" which the State Government has bought for £61,000.This completely new approach to the problem of housing the aged was announced last night by Mr.Fulton, Health Minister. He said Lotus Lodge would provide accommodation in two-room flats and bungalows.A set scale of fees would be charged. At first the accommodation would be self-contained, allowing all residents to have an independent existence. Ultimately central services would probably be available, but accommodation would still be independent.\n\nNo delay\n\nMr. Fulton said that the Hospitals and Charities Commission had assured him that there would be no delay in opening the settlement, which should be largely self-supporting.Mr. Fulton added: \"This marks the beginning of a new era for the aged. \"I am sure it will be welcomed by all members of the community.\"\n\nLotus Lodge is on about 21 acres of land with a frontage to the Nepean Highway, on the Sorrento side of Rosebud. The sale, which is on a walk-out, walk-in basis, was made on account of Mr. A. E. Stanton by\n\nE Jacobs and Lowe, of Mornington.\n\nPrefab, hospital\n\nA second State Government project for Rosebud is a pre-fabricated hospital that it will build at Rosebud to serve the Mornington Peninsula. Mr. Fulton said last night that the hospital would have 20 beds at first, and should be completed within three years. It would be made of trussed steel and concrete, and would be imported in sections from Britain. The hospital would be built on eight acres at present owned by the Alfred Hospital.\n\nAs it was within a few yards of Lotus Lodge it would cater for residents at the old-age settlement.\n\n(P.3, Argus, 21-4-1951.)"
