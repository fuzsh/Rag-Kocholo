Robert Musil (born Nov. 6, 1880, Klagenfurt, Austria—died April 15, 1942, Geneva, Switz.) was an Austrian-German novelist, best known for his monumental unfinished novel Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (1930–43; The Man Without Qualities).

Musil received a doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1908 and then held jobs as a librarian and an editor before serving in the Austrian army in World War I (1914–18). (He inherited the Edler title, awarded his father in 1917, but did not use it as an author.) From 1918 to 1922 Musil was a civil servant in Vienna and thereafter worked randomly as a writer and journalist. He lived in Berlin (1932–33) but returned to Vienna until the Nazi Anschluss of 1938, when he fled to Switzerland, where he lived first in Zurich and then in Geneva.
