        "text": "Robert Musil was born in Klagenfurt, capital of Carinthia. After completing his studies and working for sometime in Berlin he settled in Vienna and became a journalist and writer. During World War I he was busy as a war correspondent at the beginning of World War II he managed to emigrate to Switzerland as he feared for his Jewish wife.\n\nHis first novel ‘Die Verwirrungen des Zögling Törleß‘ (Confusions of Young Torless) was published in 1906 and hauntingly describes the experiences of a sensitive boy in an exclusive military school with all its repression and brutallity. It was immensely popular. His later publications did not rise to the same popularity."
