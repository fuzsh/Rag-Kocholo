        "text": "Nondescript Man\n\nThe Man Without Qualities.\n\nBy Robert Musil.\n\nTranslated by Eithne Wilkins and George Kaiser. Coward-McCann. 367 pp. $4.00.\n\nRobert Musil’s Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften is a great and tragic book. It is also an untranslatable one. And not only because of its language-I doubt even if German readers outside the boundaries of Old Austria are able to follow all the ironies and innuendoes of its style. The English translation, one-fifth the length of the original, simply fails to make sense. Its very title is misleading in translation. Ulrich, the man without “qualities,” has qualities galore. Only they defy definition. It is one of the paradoxes of the book that it nevertheless attempts such definition.\n\nIt is very much an Austrian, and not a German, novel. The style of life in the last years of Franz Joseph’s reign produced a literature so enamored of nuances, so absorbed in the spectacle of its own brilliant decline, that it found its end in a kind of private joke. Those who now try to revive this joke in translations find a queer obscurity instead of the scintillating wit they had been led to expect. Yet this literature still preserves the elaborate, detailed, microscopically correct image of an imperial civilization; that it crumbles to pieces in the hands of the translator is but a sign of its original fineness. Nor did this literature perish with the end of the Hapsburg monarchy. As a memory-more delicate still and even less exportable-it lived on, until 1938: in much of Schnitzler, some of the earlier Hermann Broch, Joseph Roth’s Radetzkymarsch, Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s comedy Der Schwierige (“The Man Who Was Difficult”), and most certainly in the later works of the satirist Karl Kraus.\n\nIt would be easy to say that all these books, different as they are, resist translation because they sacrifice content to form, and meaning to a narcissistic concentration on linguistic exclusiveness. But it isn’t so. These writers were preoccupied with a period and a society which they knew were doomed. It is only that if they penetrated the iridescent surface of their civilization in search of “reality” (they were contemporaries of Freud and, almost, of the Neo-Positivists), they did so with the period’s old vocabulary, and conditioned by its climate of moribund irony. To tell their melancholy jokes in full, to annotate their books, to “explain” the references, is both to obscure the radiance of the surface and to choke off the light from below for which they had been searching.\n\n_____________\n\nRobert Edler (Knight) von Musil was born in Klagenfurt, Austria, in November 1880, and died in April 1942 in Geneva, Switzerland. Like Rainer Maria Rilke, he was educated in an Austrian military academy. Unlike Rilke, he was not broken by it; he did not experience Old Austria as a trauma to be suppressed for an entire lifetime. He lived in Vienna until 1938, when the arrival of the Nazis forced him, the genteel Gentile, to move to Switzerland; the year before he had given a public talk about the Nazis called “On Stupidity.”\n\nIn Mann ohne Eigenschaften, Musil strove, in Hermann Broch’s words, to depict man “in the full scale of his possibilities of experience, starting with the physical and emotional and extending up to the moral and metaphysical.” Being a novelist, and an Austrian novelist, however, he concentrated on the extreme ends of the scale. The novel contains an ample catalogue of sexual experiences from the farcical to the pathological. It also contains aphorisms about “God and the world.” The intermediate region, however, that of life as a social phenomenon, is treated with less precision and gusto, and moreover, is so encumbered with erotic anecdotes and philosophical reflections as almost to be lost to view.\n\nIntelligence was the main criterion Musil applied to his time and to himself; applied intelligence is the un-Austrian activity his hero practices. For lack of intelligence, of intellectual precision and courage, seemed to Musil the sickness that had befallen Austria and the Europe for which she stood. Intellectual clarity drives his hero to denounce the moral and social conditions of his era as mere barbarism, without, however, being able himself to keep from tasting the refined pleasures which this barbarism had to offer. Not only does Musil mock Old Austria by holding it up to the mirror of Ulrich’s intelligence; he mocks his hero by holding him up to his, Musil’s, intellectual standards.\n\nUlrich (he has no last name) does not live, but exposes himself systematically to occurrences; his Weltanschauung is no philosophy but an infinite repartee forced upon him by an unreal environment. He is attracted by high society and by crime-though he loathes both. Physical assault fascinates him no less than sexual adventure. He is promiscuous out of politeness, and cruel out of the pleasure he gets from an intellectual exchange. If he has any center at all, it is what he himself calls the “Baroque of the Void”: a profound silence under all the words; a deep-seated nihilism under all his protestations of loyalty to traditional mores.\n\n_____________\n\nMusil’s style resembles Ulrich’s character; It is gracious and cruel; at times, a very excess of precision tips it over into vagueness. The English translation (containing only the initial chapters of the novel) shows but the semblance of an action: the campaign launched in Austria before the 1914 war to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of Franz Joseph’s reign, as a retort and counter-attraction to Wilhelm II’s thirtieth anniversary as Kaiser of Germany. Both celebrations were scheduled to take place in 1918. Musil’s novel starts, however, in 1913 and ends some time in 1914. Those involved in the campaign (Ulrich becomes honorary secretary of the committee) are not only mocked directly, but are the victims of the irony of history: off-stage, rarely alluded-to but all-pervading realities, are Archduke Ferdinand’s assassination and the outbreak of war.\n\nIn the . novel Austria becomes “Kakania,” the Dual (kaiserlich und königlich—k. und k .) Monarchy, with all the faecal associations of the Greek word kakos. It is the arena of Europe’s self-destructive tendencies, where nothing is ever done and anything can happen. Life in “Kakania” is a ritual without direction. Ulrich remembers what his boyhood friend, Walter, once said about him: “Ulrich always puts tremendous energy into doing the very things he doesn’t consider necessary,” and adds, not without conceit: “That could be said about all of us today.” He is the self-analysis, the self-indictment, and the self-mockery of Western man on the eve of the “Age of Stupidity” that dawned just in 1913.\n\nMusil published the first part of the Mann ohne Eigenschaften in 1930; he was still at work on it when he died. The 1,672 pages of the German edition come to no ending; but we know that the last chapters were meant to be entitled “A Sort of Conclusion,” as the first are called “A Sort of Introduction.” Infinite pains went into this fabric of innuendoes and ironies; “many chapters exist in more than twenty versions,” writes his widow about the last part of his work. He went on slowly peeling off layer after layer from his characters until nothing remained but a b on mot, an aphorism, a sharp and painful splinter of wisdom.\n\n_____________"
