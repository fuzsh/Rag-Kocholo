        "text": "The Artist-Intellectual, in or versus Society? A Dilemma\n\nRANDOLPH J. KLAWITER\n\nThe following reflections on three of the most outstanding German novels of the twentieth century, viz. Robert Musil’s Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, Hermann Hesse’s Das Glasperlenspiel, and Thomas Mann’s Dr. Faustus, are offered with full cognizance of the fact that these particular works of fiction are an all but inexhaustible source of literary, sociological and psychological themes and complexities, concerning each of which an extensive monograph might be written (the selective bibhography alone at the end of this essay indicates what scholarship has already been devoted to some of these aspects). The present study then makes no claim to greath depth of insight or to comprehensiveness of treatment. It attempts rather merely to isolate one element that underlies and thus unites in spirit these three works, namely the attitude of each writer vis-à-vis the position of the artist-intellectual in society, and to delineate within the context of the plot of each story the various solutions to this problem proffered, albeit tentatively, by the authors themselves.\n\nI\n\nSed quia tepidus es,\n\net nee frigidus,\n\nnee calidus, incipiam\n\nte evomere ex ore meo.\n\n(Rev. 3, 16)\n\nRobert Musil’s unfinished novel, Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, portrays in epic fashion the mind of the German intellectual and the state of German society in the years immediately prior to the First World War. Although the plot as “plot” is intricate and complex, it functions almost solely as a vehicle by means of which the various characters are brought into contact with one another and through which the philosophic inquiries of the author are given some semblance of coherent form. The central foci of the novel are its main protagonist, Ulrich, the motivating catalyst of the “Parallelaktion” and the convicted sex murderer Moosbruger.\n\nEmperor Wilhelm II of Germany is to celebrate on a grand public scale the 13th anniversary of his coronation (1918). Not to be outdone by their brothers to the North, the Austrians conceive of an equally elaborate celebration in honor of the 70th anniversary of the coronation of Franz Josef, their “Emperor of Peace.” The formation and interaction of the members of the planning committee function as the nucleus of the story since in one way or another each character of the novel reacts for or against the committee and its grandiose dreams: Count Leinsdorf, a representative of the enhghtened, but still paternalistic Austrian nobility; Hermine Tuzzi, the wife of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, referred to as Diotima, a frustrated composite of intellectual pretention, artistic sensibility, social awareness (viewed through the myopic prism of class snobbery) and animal passion, constrained only by the ephemeral bonds of acceptable social decorum; Paul Arnheim, a Prussian representative of the 20th century Renaissance Man, who strives to equalize within himself the rival claims of intellectual pursuits and commercial success; General Stumm von Bordwehr, the embodied spirit of the ever present but appropriately incompetent military complex; the Jewish family of Leo Fichel, caught in the cross-current of self-identity versus assimilation; Ulrich, the artist-intellectual, who would portray his society through the perspective of symbolic relief but who, in the final analysis, becomes so enmeshed in the intricate vortices of intrapersonal detail that he is rendered hopelessly “denatured,” a man without dominant personal characteristics of his own, thus functioning solely as a mirror for those about him.\n\nConsidered individually the several characters appear as little more than reflections of stereotyped human beings; viewed in toto, however, the interwoven complexities of the various types present a sharply delineated portrayal of Austro-German thought and society at the turn of the century. In Count Leinsdorf, Musil depicts the social decay of the Austrian nobility which, through years of non-involvement, has been reduced to the level of the “privileged effete.” Vaguely aware of the needs and rights of the working class, Leinsdorf nonetheless operates on the principle that true nobility should be “felt not heard,” and thus, although he personally would bestow rewards for services rendered, his idealism has estranged him from the slowly emerging mass culture. General Stumm von Bordwehr is a searing depiction of the military establishment, a frame of mind that finds its stability within the rigid confines of “classification” and regimentation, an attitude buttressed by an unswerving conviction of class consciousness. As an individual the General is a likeable personahty, for he is in reality little more than a caricature of the person he believes himself to be, but as a representative of the military he reflects a caste that has lost all contact with the society that supports it and, having become so enamored of its own importance, it can no longer master its own profession. An institution, however, that has become a mere travesty of its former self is tragic, not amusingly ludicrous. In the person of Paul Arnheim, Musil voices a condemnation of the emotionless, stereotyped Prussian mentality so wholly orientated toward commercial prowess that any admixture of intellectual or artistic proclivities results only in affectation. Though driven to the “Parallelaktion” by a desire to fulfill his intellectual pursuits, Arnheim can involve himself only on a pedantic, metaphysical level, for his basic materialistic motives dominate his every concern, from his expensive hotel rooms and extensive wardrobe to his passion for the acquisition of the Galatian oil fields. Like many another “denizen of the tea party set,” Diotima strives to display intellectual gifts that far surpass those with which nature has endowed her. The utter pretentiousness of her character is illustrated not so much by the adoption of a pseudonym redolent of the dialogues of Socrates as it is by the sardonic humor that forms the background to her attempts to explain to Ulrich her metaphysical principles of the unity of love and sex, namely her seizures due to menstrual cramps. By nature, Diotima can be likened to a great “earth-mother of the social elite” who attracts pseudo-intellectuals, as fire must draw moths, but any relationship between her and her devoted coterie is doomed from the outset to frustration. It is in the person of Ulrich, however, that Musil has most poignantly portrayed his criticism of society. Like Musil himself, Ulrich is a dispassionate character in matters of the mind or affairs of sex. Although he can gratify his endless streams of lovers, he himself experiences no emotion through his various encounters and even his father’s death leaves him unmoved. His cynicism has destroyed any individual qualities within him and thus he can accurately mirror the qualities of those about him—through his eyes contours of society are brought into focus: Diotima’s shallowness, Arnheim’s duphcity, General Stumm’s foolish incompetence, the basic selfishness of Nietzsche’s super race as embodied in the sexual tension between his friend Walter and Walter’s animal wife Clarissa, the natural goodness and love in the servants Soliman and Rachel as opposed to the “socially proper” relationships of their masters and mistresses, the ludicrous posture of pre-war anti-Semitism as embodied in Sepp who inveighs against the abstraction “Jewishness” and yet marries a Jewess.\n\nIn speaking of the pre-mechanized Austria Musil refers to it as Kakania (cf. kaiserlich-königlich), a type of unnatural reality which has remained ensnared in its established values and ideals, a society in which the intellectually oriented “Parallelaktion” could never really materialize; for while the few vainly strive to simulate activity, the majority remains blissfully inert, lulled into antipathy by the soothing strains of Strauß and the savor of the current “Heuriger.” The most striking symbol of the decadent lethargy that has settled upon Kakania is the alluringly attractive personality of Moosbruger. In daring to actualize in his person the fascination of sex and physical force, Moosbruger has not only posed an all but insoluble judicial problem—officially his actions have placed him beyond the pale of the sane citizen, thus his incarceration in an insane asylum—but he has awakened in society as a whole those very drives which “good people” have endeavored to suppress and thus he represents those very passions the Kakanian society has not dared to attain (cf. the various visitors to the asylum, some drawn by mere curiosity, others, i.e., Clarissa, who have come to defend him, haunted by the specter of a man who might somehow unite the intellect of the Nietzschean Ulrich and the demonic passion of Moosbruger).\n\nIndirectly the whole novel forms a treatise on the problem of the artist versus society. Since Kakania has become a parody of life there is a distinct dividing line between thought and action wherein the actions of the stereotyped characters are predictable but curiously undefined. Unlike the Victorian novel, Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften is pervaded by a spectrum of muted figures, neither black nor white, and thus the artist as creative agent is an all but contradictory impossibility. The very atmosphere of the society in which Ulrich finds himself is such that he could never come to grips with a single being or situation that might challenge his artist’s soul. Stripped of the principle of creative activity, the artist can function only as the cynical reflection of decadence enthroned as a way of life. To create, the artist must withdraw from the arena of action and ponder its effects upon him—for Ulrich or Kakania such an escape is impossible since everything from birth to death is regulated on the social level, adjusted and classified within the confines of bureaucratic efficiency. Withdrawal and, therefore, depth are denied the artist in such a two dimensional environment and with their loss all hope for true art is but self-deception.\n\nIn a sense, the main theme of Musil’s unfinished epic is the pressing urgency of social questions forced upon a wholly decadent and thus indifferent society. Every aspect of society is treated, every philosophy of life is touched upon but no solution is ever forthcoming, not because the author himself necessarily had no ideas of his own nor because the novel itself remained incomplete. The answer lies rather in the nature of society itself which defies a total literary vivisection and analysis, especially a society which seems to be dying from within of a disease that is neither recognized as such nor one that would be combated were it so recognized. Although the artist in Musil’s view is doomed to failure, he himself has not failed and his particular novel has become a classic, portraying a sensitive and perceptive vision of a decaying society for which the cataclysm of war was a salutary, cleansing purgative.\n\nII\n\nAmen dico vobis:\n\nQuamdiu fecistis uni ex his\n\nfratribus meis minimis,\n\nmihi fecistis.\n\n(Matt. 25, 40)\n\nDas Glasperlenspiel by Hermann Hesse tells the story of a man who conquers the seemingly inevitable and whose fate at long last grants him the chance to perform that task to which he is naturally predisposed, namely to serve. It is fundamentally a portrayal of the place of the intellectual in society, cast in relief through the actions of the main protagonist, Joseph Knecht. Underlying the entire novel is the unstated question: what purpose is intellectual acquisition to serve? Is it not possible that knowledge can become an end in itself rather than a means, thus breeding narrowmindedness instead of an active world-consciousness and a true humanitarianism? Possible? Yes—one need but contemplate the society of Castalia and the quasi religious aura which enshrines its every order and function to realize to what a degree the intellectual life can become an object of veneration in itself, beyond the confines of which the inhabitants of such a society never venture. Since it is the psyche of man that dominates all, the physical characteristics of Knecht are never mentioned and, like the society as a whole, he too gradually loses his human equilibrium in a pursuit of purely spiritual phenomena, a quest that clearly demonstrates that this “new dispensation” has become as degenerate as the old order which it sought to replace.\n\nThe chief protagonists of the novel represent the various possible solutions to the unstated dilemma of the intellectual in or rather versus society. Tegularius seeks in Castaha a refuge from life, a retreat that can be attained and safeguarded only through machine-like solving of research problems. The entire scope of his preoccupation is delimited within the term “technique”—all else is a terra incognita for him and in his effete bias he neither can nor wills to cope with life as a whole. In the person of the Music Master, Hesse would illustrate that such a restrictive position need not necessarily destroy an individual provided he is prepared to shift the main emphasis from the “self” to “others”, whereby technique becomes the means or the vehicle that unites the one and the many. The Music Master, however, is in a sense as provincial as Tegularius for his love of mankind is defined wholly in terms of abstract concepts, each concrete individual viewed solely as but a notational unit within the symphonic whole of mankind. Like the classical devotees of the Enhghtenment, the Music Master has risen above pure knowledge to the more sublime heights of culture but he too fails to grasp the inherent dichotomy in the living, operative entity called man; like Tegularius, he too views the worth of man only in the abstract, thus formal technique is sacrificed in favor of ideal concepts, and contact with the concrete reality of life is not even once considered. Isolation of the intellectual is possible, but in isolation the mind as well as the person of man is moribund.\n\nIn the person of Father Jacobus Hesse envisioned an initial approach toward personal involvement, a tentative rapprochement between man and the goals toward which he aspires via the agency of religion. Just as Christianity preserved and in its own way promoted the culture of Western Europe during the Middle Ages, so too does Father Jacobus protect and promote the exploration and betterment of the condition humaine. For him, however, as for monasticism before him, a gulf exists between those to be saved and those who are to act as surrogate saviors—the isolated life of the intellectual within the confines of Castaha is a barrier between mind and matter as impenetrable as the mortared walls of any medieval monastery. The priest can perceive the dilemma, he realizes the problem involved and what is at stake, but he too fails to act because of his basic orientation, his inability to combine the creativity of a scholar with an active involvement in the reahty of life.\n\nIf isolation and retreat are not the answers, what can be said for a complete and wholehearted involvement in the world? Hesse’s response to this query is embodied in the figure Plinio Designori, a man of the world whose appearance in Castalia is jarring, an unwelcome anomaly. Unable to renounce the world he has left and thus unable to adopt the attitudes of his new environment, Designori is a person at war within himself, a man whose goals have lost their foundation, casting him adrift in a vacuum somewhere between mind and matter. Leaving Castalia, however, poses no solution for him for he can no longer readapt himself to his former modes of life and thought and thus he vainly struggles to establish a new equihbrium in his vacillations from one extreme to another. Even a position of neutrality, symbolized by his new home and his endeavors for his son, Tito, prove fleeting and illusory. Once encountered, the life of the intellect cannot be renounced with impunity for only the strong, the man who is able to evaluate and love both positions, can fuse the two terms into a new reality. Plinio is not such a person and as a broken man he too retreats, away from and not into the world of the soul.\n\nFor Hesse, Joseph Knecht symbolizes the true intellectual, a man whose primary motivating force is his desire to realize in his life a viable equilibrium between the two poles of human activity. He is attracted to the intellectual sphere and the cultures of the past and thus he can befriend Tegularius and the Music Master; he can also appreciate the connecting bonds between the academic and the secular and thus he honors Father Jacobus. In Plinio’s position, however, he can likewise espy a certain element of truth but he is forced to refute Plinio’s stance as he is to reject those of his other friends for basically the same reason, they are all alike one-sided and thus unbalanced. Truth as something vibrantly alive and humanly cogent lies not at either extreme but somewhere in the middle. Man is neither disembodied spirit nor spiritless beast, he is a composite of both and as such truth for him entails the conjunction of mind and matter. When Knecht renounces his position as Magister Ludi to enter life beyond the borders of Castaha, he publishes a circular letter stating his reasons for doing so, a letter that decries the stultifying blindness of the purely academic attitude but at the same time praises Castaha as the protector of the spirit. The true intellectual is indeed the guardian of the Weltgeist at any given moment of time and thus he cannot prostitute his calling by serving merely as the mouthpiece of one particular political bias. Detachment is necessary if he is to function as the conscience of the era—detachment but not complete isolation for the mind can guide and inspire only that which it has experienced. To withdraw from society into an idealized world of concepts is to condemn oneself to the level of a mere librarian of the repositories of past glories; to renounce the spirit for political agitation is equally disastrous for then one substitutes expediency for truth and demagoguery for philosophic discernment. A union of the two extremes is necessary, but is it possible to achieve it? Knecht abandons Castaha and seeks to establish such a union between mind and matter but in his attempt he fails; he is destroyed by that very nature that he formerly renounced, not because he was wrong in his attempt but rather because he was unprepared to meet and overcome the exigencies of the task at hand. The spirit was willing indeed but the flesh was weak. Joseph does not die, therefore, as a punishment for attempting the difficult but rather because he had dared to enter history and was willing to accept the consequences of human existence, to actualize in his person the solemn warning of Father Jacobus that to deal with history means to abandon oneself to chaos and yet retain a belief in ordination and meaning. His death is thus not tragic in the sense that, like Oedipus, he had delved too relentlessly into the secret of fate, but tragic only insofar as all deaths are tragic—the dénouement in the inescapable drama of the human condition. In a sense it is reminiscent of the words once employed to describe the Bead Game: “Es bedeutete eine erlesene, symbolhafte Form des Suchens nach dem Vollkommenen, eine sublime Alchimie, ein Sichannähern an den über allen Bildern und Vielheiten in sich einigen Geist, also an Gott.”1 The pure intellectual cannot hope to survive in the physical world for he is not equipped to counter its demands with sufficient force and thus Knecht must die. His death, however, was a willed form of martyrdom, in a sense a self-offering in the hope of reconciling apparently eternally warring camps. In Tito, a son of the world tutored by Knecht, Hesse would seem to envision a slowly evolving union of the two extremes, a merging of the two diverse impulses that can be accomplished not by revolution but only through the successive stages of an evolutionary process.\n\nAlthough a sense of pessimistic gloom seems to pervade the novel in spite of the power of its message—it was after all written during the zenith of the Nazi orgy in Europe—Hesse’s “philosophy of synthesis” is still not wholly eclipsed even here. In the final analysis, what is synthesis if not a living receptivity to all shades and gradations of stimuli, the personal reaction to which fosters and eventually matures man’s quest for self-knowledge? The devotees of the metaphysical Bead Game strove to materialize in thought a unio mystica of the disparate arts and sciences, a rapprochement heightened and fortified by introspection. Trained thus in terms of Hegelian dialectic, what would be more logical than the eventual interjection of the consequent antithesis to their approach to reality, whereby the synthesis would no longer remain a psychic game but rather a lived experience? Were this to occur, could the next dialectical confrontation be avoided, the face-en-face encounter between a spiritually informed secular life and the divine reality which admits of no multiphcation of incongruent factors, a synthesis, therefore, of the One with the Many? Such an ultimate union demands, however, more than mystic contemplation, it postulates total self-abandonment, a complete submersion of the self-conscious personal ego into the limitless reaches of the infinite Ego; it demands in a word, death. Joseph, the servant, must consequently die, passing from the scene of partial activity into the realm of complete receptivity, thereby bridging the chasm between temporal historicism and its unavoidable chaos on the one hand, timeless eternity and its inherent sense of an endlessly progressive order on the other.\n\nIII\n\nDixit eis Jesus: Si caed essetis,\n\nnon haberetis peccatum;\n\nnunc vero dicitis: Quia videmus.\n\nPeccatum vestrum manet.\n\n(John 9, 41)\n\nThe theme of the complex relationship that ensues between the artist and society is pursued on a three-fold level in Thomas Mann’s Dr. Faustus: the personal, the political and the transcendental. The first two levels are intricately interwoven in the person of the musician Adrian Leverkühn and his fictional biographer Zeitblom, whereas the third is embodied in the nature of music as a symbol. It is of decisive importance that the form of the novel is biographical for thus impersonal “fact” is filtered through the medium of a third-person perspective whose cogency is derived from the immediacy of a first-person report. Inasmuch as the novel is constructed in its every detail around the subjectivity of the first-person narrator, it is impossible to separate or distinguish between Zeitblom’s function as a fictive biographer and as a figure in the novel. From a strictly formal point of view, the significance of Zeitblom also allows a two-fold avenue of approach, that of the biography itself and that of the genesis of this biography. Zeitblom thus serves a double purpose—he has to compose the biography of a friend and at the same time he is made to comment upon the course of his undertaking. Through the use of authorial comment the construction of periodization is assured, thus spanning the time gap between the past (Leverkühn), the present (Zeitblom) and the future (the reader). This division of time is of the greatest significance for the novel and its central theme in that it permits the period encompassed by the actual writing of the novel (the initial years of World War II) to parallel the narration of Leverkühn’s tragedy, in a sense enhancing the tragedy of the individual and vicariously functioning as its subterranean fundament.\n\nAs a representative of the age stretching from Bismarck to Hitler, Leverkühn cannot be said to be identical with any one specific individual. Absorbing the historical figure of Nietzsche into himself, he also expresses the contingent and opposing movements and Weltanschauungen of the entire period. As has often been pointed out, however, the portraiture of this age is only conditionally accurate since it is depicted from the subjective vantage point of Mann himself, thus reflecting Mann’s preoccupation with the more questionable, suspect aspects of human motivation, his predilection for the problematic relationship between society and the artist and the grave concern he felt for contemporary developments in Germany.\n\nThe subjectivity of the first-person narrator has also a further significance since it was through the immediacy of his relationship with Leverkühn that Zeitblom was confronted directly with a demonic element that serves as an intensifying factor in his (Zeitblom’s) biographical narration. Thus Zeitblom as a narrator and as an existential figure in his work are identical, the two functions as inextricable in Mann as in his creation. The novel is consequently constructed from the point of view of a humanist, every detail existing in “fact” only because the narrator had experienced it as such. Reality in the novel, therefore, participates in a double aspect—on the one hand the slight distance that separates Mann from the material of his story, on the other the use of historical and/or literary events as a montage against which larger issues stand out in sharper relief (cf. the portrait of Mann’s mother as Mrs. Rodde, the fate of his sister reflected in that of Clarissa, etc.). It is again the fictive first-person narrator that strikes a balance between these two aspects; although individual characteristics of real persons are discernible, the nature of the novel as a portrait of an entire age assumes that the basic problems are real but the main characters are real only to the degree that they embody these problems per se without reference to any particular individual. They are, therefore, not identical with any specific historical personality for as ideal figures they absorb within their fictive reality the reality of history itself.\n\nA more essential factor of the novel is Mann’s arrangement of the represented time continuum. Superficially considered it would appear that two distinct time spans are under consideration—the biographical aspect of Leverkiihn’s life extending from 1885 to 1930 and the actual writing of the biography between 1943 and 1945. These two periods of time are united in the person of the narrator who relates personal experiences with reference to both time divisions thus weaving into the texture of the past the personal experiences of the present. The relationship between the musical creations of Leverkühn and the tragic developments in Germany are clearly realized and become evident in this division of time. The position of the reader is also an integral element of time in the novel, the future namely, for although the work ends with the absolute hopelessness of total destruction, it poses a question to future generations, a question that is hkewise a task to be undertaken and hopefully fulfilled: “Wann wird aus letzter Hoffnungslosigkeit ein Wunder, das über den Glauben geht, das Licht der Hoffnung tagen?”1\n\nThus far we have considered only Mann’s attitude concerning the immediate relationship that exists between the artist and his time, in a sense the immediacy of time in the artist. It remains for us to examine, if only cursorily, Mann’s conception of the artist and his art. The one dominant symbol of Dr. Faustus is Mann’s vision of the “world without transcendency” in which a complex of motifs are operative and interactive: theology, demonology, music; the problem of music in conjunction with the Faust figure and this in turn with the psychology of the German mentality; the problem of genius and the motif of the pact with the devil; these various motifs concentrated then in the question of the basic nature of music as it is related to the German soul on the one hand and German history on the other.\n\nThe old Faust figure as transformed by Goethe into a vehicle of classical-romantic perspectives is retransformed by Mann into a vehicle of psychological analysis. The original Faust figure retains only a certain demonological, neurotic atmosphere to which Mann conjoins the atmosphere of the characteristic musicahty of the German temperament, a cultural-critical motif which forms the crystallization point of the entire novel. At times music is conjured forth in the name of passion, or a morality in opposition to pure aestheticism, or an animal glorification of life; again music might represent the principles of modernity or conservatism in the form of Wagnerian total objectivity; or again music might symbolize a melancholic apolitical or almost anti-democratic bias. In any event music is the antipode of reason and progress, politics and democracy, being in essence the reflection of the spiritual excellences of the German soul, a battle cry of an emotional nationalism. And yet in the pivotal conversation between Leverkühn and the devil, it is the devil who states that, like sin and evil, music is a supremely theological factor. Like sin, therefore, music is a product of evil since it stems from the recesses of animal potency, beyond the pale and control of man’s higher faculties of reason and will. But again, considered as a natural by-product of man’s animal nature, the demonic potency inherent in art cannot be equated with evil for it rises to the surface not in opposition to reason or morality but as a natural expression of the force of life which sustains human existence. Thus when judged, or perhaps prejudged, solely by certain undisciphned intoxicating effects emanating from it, the demonic in music can be suspect, indeed feared as the fountainhead of uncontrolled passion, the extended effects of which are then able to encompass even the elemental nature of love, which thus also is viewed as something evil.\n\nThe ambivalence of these views forms a perplexing coloration to the whole of Dr. Faustus for at times music, i.e., art is seen as a divine gift by reason of man’s nature, at other times it is represented as the excrescence of black magic, both of which aspects have driven the German temperament to attain either the heights of romantic-mystical transfiguration or to sink to the perverse excesses of an alliance with Satan.\n\nThe concatenation of music, theology and the German psyche illustrates most poignantly the demonic essence of music. If one can but compromise the nature of theology, revealing it to be nothing more than a snare of the devil whereby the reason of man can seduce the soul from its unquestioning submission to the fiat of God (a position in extremo of Luther’s Reformation theology), then it all but inexorably follows that a nation such as Germany, that is by nature addicted to theology and to music (an art form that proceeds most directly from the well-spring of the purely animal in man), is ipso facto a fallen, perverse people.\n\nIn contrast to Goethe’s devil, Mann’s is wholly secularized, the classical metaphysical nucleus of the struggle with evil assuming for Mann a psychological-physiological complex whereby the antagonists are no longer God and Satan but rather various aspects of contemporary reality and 20th century culture. Two particular elements of human existence are specified as the humus in which the demonic is spawned—sex and disease, united in Leverkühn in the form of venereal disease. Localizing a source of evil in a natural potency of man, Mann has not only forged a relationship between sex and evil, but he has questioned the very essence of human love of which sex is the most natural expression. The one woman Leverkühn ever loved was the very person from whom he contracted syphilis!\n\nMusic, the soul of Leverkühn’s whole life, is thus seen as the very incarnation of the spirit of evil, the fruits of which are disease and isolation from one’s fellowman. Art is then by nature a creative expression of both infirmity and vitality, a formal union of subterranean force with terrestrial debilitation wherein disease is the catalyst but not the cause of creativity. As in Goethe’s Faust, so in Mann’s Dr. Faustus, two souls inhabit the selfsame breast; for Mann these two “souls” would seem to be disease and a vital life force, a psychological extension of the classical concepts of good and evil. For both Goethe and Mann, however, the nature of genius remains in the final analysis beyond the grasp of reason, a transcendental phenomenon, be its origin demonic or divine.\n\nMann’s ambivalent attitude toward the relevance of the artist to the rest of society informs almost all of his works from Buddenbrooks through Tonto Kröger and The Magic Mountain to Dr. Faustus. As Mann grew older, his sympathies seemed to weigh evermore heavily in favor of society, the life of activity and encounter, the sane and physically beautiful. In Dr. Faustus his solution might even be said to be anti-artist. Leverkühn is the very embodiment of the incompatibility of the artist either to adapt himself to his milieu or for the milieu to accept, if not necessarily understand, the artist. From his very birth Leverkühn was an isolated soul—born on a farm away from the bourgeois society of Germany, he never really escaped his fated cell. In school he remained a recluse and when he removed to the south of Germany —the haven of physical beauty and animal passion—he chose a small secluded village for his home. His final act of escape into solitude was his regression into madness. As the man, so his art: misunderstood by his contemporaries, judged as sheer cacaphony, it is stigmatized with the most condemning term of opprobium, i.e., impractical, as unfit for society as the artist was for military service. When in a fit of final desperation and fury, born of fear and contempt alike, the artist does attempt to explain the soul of the artist to the uninitiated masses, no one understands him for no one, not even his best friend Zeitblom, can appreciate the plight of his soul. Some are bhnded by uncomprehending love for him, some perceive only an external rhetoric, the rest are repulsed with disgust or disbehef. With no one to share his soul’s ecstacy or agony, Leverkühn flaunts the ultimate in defiance of “sane reason,” he takes refuge in insanity. By nature a breed apart from the masses of humanity, the artist is not equipped to cope with society’s demands and thus he must perish. To be wholly self-sufficient he is not able, to prostitute his transcendental patrimony he is too proud and, therefore, he has no choice but to succumb. One cannot escape the feeling that Mann himself believed in his declining years that the blond and blue eyed animals of this world can obviously thrive without the sensitive, temperamental species of the Tonio Kröger breed, whereas the artist cannot survive without his counterpart no matter how he might look down upon it—the law of the survival of the fittest shall not be repealed.\n\nIV\n\nQuocumque enim perrexeris, pergam:\n\net ubi morata fueris,\n\net ego pariter morabor.\n\nPopulus tuus populus meus,\n\net Deus tuus Deus meus.\n\n(Ruth, 1, 16)\n\nIf what has been asserted thus far is true, what conclusions can be drawn concerning the German novel of the 20th century? The most obvious response is that the novel reflects a deep concern about the rapidly changing world situation. Fiction no longer portrays a static society for the simple reason that the nature of society has become bewildering, complex and fluid. The society and mores as they existed at the turn of the century have been forever destroyed in the holocaust of two catastrophic wars and a new order has assumed their place, an order, however, that is yet unrooted and ephemeral if only because its rarified atmosphere lacks the depth of perspective that time alone can grant. In the works discussed above the primary concern of the authors was not the nature of this new order, a nature as yet undefinable for it itself has yet to establish its own end or even some tentative means thereto; their concern was rather the relationship between this new dispensation and the artist-temperament struggling for survival beneath its new banners. Although differing in degree, the authors treated (as well as most contemporary writers) are essentially pessimistic in their prognosis — the artist, and by extension any individual sensitive to the dichotomy that exists between a mass materialistic civilization and the individual psyche striving to realize its own form of personal fulfillment, must eventually either acquiesce to the standards of society or perish beneath the weight of castigation or, what is even worse, complete indifference.\n\nIn Das Glasperlenspiel Hermann Hesse would demonstrate that the artist (i.e., the intellectual or the true humanist) cannot remain totally segregated from society and continue to remain true to his vocation. The intellectual society of Castalia had become so wholly inbred and inert through its willed self-ostracism from the rest of the world that its one specific gift to civilization, the Bead Game, had atrophied to the point of complete uselessness, its once valid and valuable contribution to the preservation of culture now devoid of relevancy. Such total self-perpetuating stultification cannot fail to repulse the true artist-intellectual, who for his own sake as well as that of his fellow man must eventually escape the bonds of complete segregation. On the other hand, total involvement is also not the answer; Designori lost all claim to intellectual achievement by his choice to reenter the secular society and Knecht, when he finally does abandon the confines of Castalia, is crushed by his new environment. Although the solution in Hesse’s terms is not completely without hope nor beyond the realm of the possible, the gulf of the probable yawns seemingly endless between the inescapable reality of the “here and now” and the realm of that “consumation devoutly to be wished.”\n\nA compromise, or rather a compromised position, forms the basis of Thomas Mann’s Dr. Faustus. Here the artist protagonist does retain a somewhat tenuous contact with society, a contact, however, that produces only friction since it is based neither on mutual understanding nor mutual consent. Physically as well as emotionally, Leverkühn remains isolated from his society. Calling his best friend by only his last name, he is incapable of a truly selfless love and his one contact with secular society in the form of his woeful femme fatale results in a fatal case of syphilis. Society and the artist are seemingly incompatible and at the climax of the novel the artist is driven mad in his futile attempt to explain his artistic tribulations to an audience that cannot and wills not to comprehend. To gain true perspective the artist must remain aloof from society, but to do so results in the vacuous pedantry of Castalia; not to do so, on the other hand, compromises the artist’s “objectivity” thereby placing him in an untenable position. A damned if you do and damned if you don’t situation, devoid of any redeeming glimmer of hope. Like Hesse, Mann is a realist vis-à-vis the abyss of the probable, but unlike Hesse his own temperament could foresee not even the slightest illusion of “a rosy fingered dawn” of a possibly better tomorrow.\n\nRobert Musil’s Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften depicts a totally social environment in which no artist could ever exist. Ulrich, the only representative (or should we not say a pseudo-representative) of the artistic world is nothing more than a soundingboard and reflecting surface mirroring the reality of the characters he encounters. He himself possesses no individual quahties, no ambition, no desire and certainly no artistic motivation. Such an insipid, shallow milieu merely saps the genius of the artist, absorbing his personality as a sponge absorbs water. With nothing against which to react and without the sobering effect of distance, the establishment of correlative relationships is impossible and without the awareness of the relationship between objectives realized and goals yet to be attained, all art and thought and culture are doomed. For Musil, as for Mann, total involvement is just as self-destructive as total self-isolation is for Hesse. Herein lies the dilemma of the modern German intellectual—both total segregation and complete involvement are impossible and yet even partial involvement is hardly tenable since it engenders more conflicting fields of interest (which eventually must also destroy art) than it creates plains of fruitful mutual intercourse.\n\nThe nature of this dilemma is so oriented toward the very personality of the artist-intellectual that the contemporary novel has had to assume a psychological form in which the characters function more and more as symbols within a manufactured environment in order that the nature of the conflict itself may be illustrated. In a manner strikingly analogous to the Mystery Plays of the late Middle Ages, ideas and ideals have once again usurped the stage of action, concepts and conflicts have tended to replace people and personalities since the concern of literature as well as that of life in general is now the survival of “individuality” and not the triumphs and defeats of a particular “individual.”\n\nFrom the death of Goethe to the total destruction of Germany in the wake of Nazi barbarism, slowly but inexorably the German temperament has been weaned increasingly from its spiritual heritage which postulated the value of human action only with reference to an infinite source of good. Taught by Kant that the infinite was beyond the reason of man, by Schopenhauer that the will to act is the cause of pain, by a misunderstood Nietzsche (via a Bismarck, a Wagner and ultimately an Adolf Hitler) that individual might purifies itself, rendering it by right superior to the yet impure masses of humanity, and then ultimately schooled in the horrors of existential fear and the all too proximate “abomination of desolation” by the catastrophic devastation of two world wars, the German soul has found itself hopelessly adrift between the chaotic activity of a nationalistic Scylla and the abysmal despair of a personal Charybdis. To submit to either order is a perversion of the haunting ghosts of a long inherited tradition, but to remain entirely detached from either is impossible. Such a dilemma is indeed overwhelming, inspiring despair. Born into a society that has been building in oppression for 150 years, forthright resistance is fatal and yet a torturous coexistence is equally dangerous to the stability of the character of the true intellectual. In sheer desperation, therefore, the German artist has progressed beyond any thought of direct action; he sees what society has developed into and he can only lament and cry the woe of the Prophets of the Old Testament. Because no positive action seems feasible, his problem has become an internal one, a trial of personal conscience. A fight for what is impossible, a return to the old order, is as useless as it is impossible and thus the German intellectual wages a more significant and equally destructive war (if it is lost) within himself to justify his own existence."
