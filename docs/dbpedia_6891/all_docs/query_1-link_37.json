        "text": "POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF A LIVING AUTHOR By Robert Musil. Translated by Peter Wortsman. 145 pp. Hygiene, Colo.: Eridanos Press. Cloth, $21. Paper, $12.\n\nSINCE so little of Robert Musil's work is available in English, this collection's appearance is a major literary event. A congeries of light sketches, composed for Austrian and German newspapers between 1913 and 1929, it was compiled in 1935 when Musil was still living in Austria. But it was first published a year later in Switzerland, the country he fled to in 1938 following the Anschluss. So often ahead of his time, the archivist of social estrangement seems to have anticipated this exile. By 1935 he was both impoverished and horrified by Austrian politics. His audience, never large, had been reduced to a small group, predominantly Jewish and even more endangered than he. Musil's sense that with the destruction of his public he had ''outlived himself'' underlines the not quite facetious title, ''Posthumous Papers of a Living Author.''\n\nTrained as a mathematician, behavioral psychologist and engineer, Musil, who died in 1942, had worked as a journalist, librarian and civil servant before devoting his energies exclusively to literature. With a more academically honed intelligence than any of his peers, he attempted to make of the solitary act of thinking a literary drama. Rather than pursue a Joycean stream of consciousness, he captured the divagation of thought in essays. Indeed, his great novel, ''The Man Without Qualities,'' is a perfected instance of essayistic fiction. Each qualification of thought is answered by some astonishing image or incident. The transition between dramatic and discursive realms is a seamless one.\n\nThe Musilian posture is fraught with contradictions. In the novel, he hails the essay's capacity to regard ''a thing from many sides without comprehending it wholly, for a thing wholly comprehended instantly loses its bulk and becomes a concept.'' For Musil, concepts were dogmatic, totalitarian, destructive of every living pattern. He also found them vulgar and humorless, and thus had no time for the Big Idea men, Freud, Heidegger or Jung. On the other hand, Musil said that the essay's best trait was its reflection of the form ''a man's inner life assumes in a decisive thought'' - that is, thought that discovers itself in the process of enunciation. But decisiveness is precisely what you don't find in his writing. Ulrich, the hero of ''The Man Without Qualities,'' possesses so many attributes - professional, national, political, cultural - that they conspire to dissolve him unless he acquires ''the passive illusion of spaces unfilled.'' This capacity for making yourself a receptacle for experience, rather atypical for a male protagonist, allows him to regard his public lives with baffled amusement: grim, moralistic but never entirely serious. The playfulness - and the transcendence -reside in the freedom from concepts.\n\nMusil enjoyed the permutations and combinations produced by the collision of our several roles. But how is ''decisive thought'' possible amid such chaos? Perhaps not since David Hume has a writer so thoroughly exposed the impossibility of objective thought, and then relied on verbal momentum to steer him out of his cul-de-sac.\n\nYet a theoretical liability frees the essayist's talent. As he strolls among his several selves, Musil becomes a flaneur of thought. He loiters among impressions as much as objects, regarding them with equal amplitude and precision. Having defined our various traits, he has a particular alertness to popular culture, the kitsch and more-than-kitsch that saturate our lives. After years in Berlin and Vienna, he was too shrewd to condemn the masses' entertainment. Though exquisitely refined, he was no cultural elitist. Musil's conceit is that the only alternative to the generalized mess he has revealed is the coherence of his meandering thought. His linguistic facility - the merging of aim, manner and result - is virtuosic. He's such a consummate stylist that after him Kafka may seem immature, Mann chatty, Brecht arch, Rilke precious and Walter Benjamin hermetic.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
