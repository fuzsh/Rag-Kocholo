        "text": "8\n\nModern by numbers: modern mathematics as a model for literary modernism\n\nNina Engelhardt\n\nBeing modern = being mathematical(?)\n\nLet no one object that outside their field mathematicians have banal or silly minds, … but in their field they do what we ought to be doing in ours. Therein lies the significant lesson and model of their existence; they are an analogy for the intellectual of the future.1\n\nIn his humorous essay ‘The Mathematical Man’, published in German in 1913, the Austrian author Robert Musil puts forward the argument that in order to negotiate the early twentieth century with its specific challenges, people have to become ‘mathematical men’. The ‘we’ in the quotation refers to literary writers who are asked to take mathematicians as a model for their work. Addressing mathematics, literature and the question of how human beings ought to behave at the beginning of the twentieth century, the opening citation brings together the central concerns of this chapter: to examine how early twentieth-century writers developed the idea that successfully ‘being modern’ – and ‘writing modernity’ – calls for ‘being mathematical’.\n\nIn the following, I analyse Musil’s essay as well as his novel The Confusions of Young Törless (1906). The Russian writer Yevgeny Zamyatin’s essay ‘On Literature, Revolution, Entropy, and Other Matters’ (1923) and his novel We (written in 1920, published in English in 1924) provide material for comparison as they similarly develop, if in rather different ways, the idea that for life and literature to be modern they have to, in a sense, become mathematical. However, We, one of the first dystopian novels, also illustrates the dangers of ‘mathematising’ society and literature. Inhumane regulation of lives and denial of personal happiness are among the possible results, as are some infelicitous effects on literature. These effects are evident, for example, in the poem ‘Happiness,’ which the protagonist of We values highly:\n\nI was enjoying a sonnet titled ‘Happiness.’ […]:\n\nForever enamoured are two plus two,\n\nForever conjoined in blissful four.\n\nThe hottest lovers in all the world:\n\nThe permanent weld of two plus two …2\n\nWe here taps into a widespread view of mathematics as the pinnacle of reason and as an example of exactitude and certainty that does not readily offer itself to be copied by life and literature. Yet, as the following discussion explores, Musil and Zamyatin’s writings refer to a particular modern notion of mathematics, which questions formerly accepted mathematical positions. It is precisely this modern notion of mathematics that Musil and Zamyatin’s texts present as a model for literature and for ‘being modern’.\n\nIn the following discussion, I first introduce the modern understanding of mathematics and then analyse Musil and Zamyatin’s engagements with it in light of new opportunities to negotiate the pressures of the early twentieth century and redefine the place and function of literature. The rapprochement between mathematical and literary positions that these examples indicate moreover demonstrates the need to reconsider the place of modern mathematics in relation to the division between the ‘two cultures’ of the natural sciences and the humanities.\n\nModern mathematics\n\nIn the early twentieth century, mathematics increasingly comes under attack as an instrument of streamlining, reduction and rationalisation. The sociologist Max Weber famously deplored the belief ‘that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation’.3 He invoked commonly understood characteristics of mathematics – clarity, simplicity, certainty – as reasons for its power and the influential role it plays in the ‘rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, … the disenchantment of the world’.4 While Weber aimed to dispel the limited and limiting view of a calculable – mathematised – world, others endorsed the exemplary state of mathematics, celebrated its apparent rigour, reliability and certainty, and welcomed innovation and progress in the field. Mathematics had undoubtedly seen significant developments since the nineteenth century, and the modernisation of the discipline showed in the creation of new fields of research, new methodologies, sub-disciplines and mathematical entities. However, these developments went hand in hand with growing concerns about the nature of mathematical proof and truth. Gottlob Frege, a key figure in nineteenth-century mathematics and philosophy, summarised the situation: ‘Mathematics should properly be a paradigm of logical rigour. In reality one can perhaps find in the writings of no science more crooked expressions and consequently more crooked thoughts, than in mathematics.’5 Attempts to rectify the ‘crooked expressions’ failed and only revealed the seriousness of the challenges to mathematical exactitude and certainty. Thus, the process of modernisation in mathematics gave rise not only to hope for a professionalised and improved discipline, but also to a sense of crisis.6 The emerging uncertainty existed next to, alongside and in competition with the image of mathematics as the pinnacle of certainty, rationality and absolute truth. The negotiation of these conflicting views took place among mathematicians themselves but also in a broader circle that felt a keen interest in the challenged role of mathematics, the resulting status of reason, and the possibility of attaining certainty and truth.\n\nFrege’s call for logical rigour was part of his programme to eliminate any references to intuition in mathematics and to demonstrate that arithmetic was reducible to logic. With this attempt, Frege founded the school of logicism – one of three schools that aimed to establish sound foundations for mathematics around 1900.7 His project was not successful, however. Famously, just as Frege was about to publish the second volume of his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (The Basic Laws of Arithmetic) in 1902, he received a letter from Bertrand Russell that called his entire project into question. The so-called ‘Russell’s paradox’ shows that the axioms Frege drew on in his project were troubled by inconsistencies. Specifically, Russell detected a paradox in set theory in relation to the question of whether the ‘set of all sets that are not members of themselves’ is a member of itself: if it is a member of itself, then it is by definition not one of the sets that are not members of themselves; at the same time, if the ‘set of all sets that are not members of themselves’ is not a member of itself, then it logically is to be counted towards the sets that are not members of themselves. Due to the inconsistencies pointed out by Russell, Frege had to relinquish core elements of his views about logic and mathematics and accept that his work did not in fact establish a foundation for mathematics. Russell’s discovery also was a major blow to his own hopes of putting mathematics on a foundation of logic: ‘It was the discovery of one such contradiction, in the spring of 1901, that put an end to the logical honeymoon that I had been enjoying. I communicated the misfortune to Whitehead, who failed to console me by quoting, “never glad confident morning again”.’8\n\nBertrand Russell is also the main protagonist in the graphic novel Logicomix (2009), by Apostolos Doxiadis, Christos Papadimitriou, Alecos Papadatos and Annie Di Donna. This graphic novel vividly, if at times with ‘comical’ licence,9 illustrates the search for certainty and truth in mathematics and the mounting sense of anxiety about these issues in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. I will draw on this graphic novel below, while recognising its limitations as a historical resource, and will introduce key issues in the foundational crisis of mathematics with the help of illustrations from it. I will support these ideas with a range of further evidence, before turning to my literary analyses.\n\nLogicomix depicts Bertrand Russell’s search for stable foundations for mathematics, from his first contact with numbers as a young boy to the publication of his major contribution to the discussion, namely the Principia Mathematica, written together with Alfred North Whitehead. Figure 8.1 shows Russell laying out his motivation: since science and knowledge greatly depend on mathematics, so the graphic Russell explains, it is vital to establish the rigour of mathematics itself.\n\nA related picture emerges in fact from Russell’s autobiography:\n\nI thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics than elsewhere. But I discovered that many mathematical demonstrations … were full of fallacies, and that, if certainty were indeed discoverable in mathematics, it would be in a new kind of mathematics, with more solid foundations than those that had hitherto been thought secure.10\n\nRussell here echoes Frege’s demand for rigour, and points to the logicist approach intended to clarify basic assumptions in mathematics. But Logicomix offers a striking graphic representation of Russell’s sense of the failure of Frege’s search for more secure foundations (Figure 8.2).\n\nThe illustration in Figure 8.2 suggests that Frege’s supposedly foundational theory – illustrated by a tortoise in this picture – was faulty and that attempts to support it with a more comprehensive theory – a bigger tortoise – similarly failed. In (other) words: Russell’s paradox can be resolved in a bigger foundational system, yet, this bigger system then includes paradoxes of its own and is itself in need of a more comprehensive ‘stabilisation’. In his autobiography, Russell indeed uses the example of the elephant and the tortoise to describe this disconcerting situation in mathematics: ‘I was continually reminded of the fable about the elephant and the tortoise. Having constructed an elephant upon which the mathematical world could rest, I found the elephant tottering, and proceeded to construct a tortoise to keep the elephant from falling. But the tortoise was no more secure than the elephant’.11 Logicomix and Russell’s autobiography clearly, and at times indeed graphically, communicate how the modern understanding of maths differs from earlier associations with rigour, certainty and truth, and why the impossibility of setting their field on secure grounds had reverberations beyond the circle of mathematicians immediately concerned with the problems. These reverberations certainly reached the writers Musil and Zamyatin, who both received a mathematical education at university level, and were aware of developments and concerns regarding mathematics. In the following discussion, I explore how their works engage with anxieties and opportunities tied up with the modern notion of mathematics and in what ways they introduce this as a model for literature and for ‘being modern’.\n\n© Apostolos Doxiadis, Christos H.

Papadimitriou, Alecos Papadatos and Annie Di Donna, 2009, Logicomix, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.\n\nMusil: ‘The Mathematical Man’\n\nLike Logicomix and Russell’s writing, Musil’s 1913 essay ‘The Mathematical Man’ emphasises the fundamental role of mathematics for other fields and for life at large. It introduces maths as the basis of the development of technology and machines, which thus means that it determines a large part of existence:\n\nWe may say that we live almost entirely from the results of mathematics … Thanks to mathematics we bake our bread, build our houses, and drive our vehicles … All the life that whirls about us, runs, and stops is not only dependent on mathematics for its comprehensibility, but has effectively come into being through it and depends on it for its existence[.]12\n\nHaving argued that mathematics constitutes the underpinning of many aspects of life, the essay then introduces the ‘foundational crisis’ in mathematics:\n\nsuddenly, after everything had been brought into the most beautiful kind of existence, the mathematicians … came upon something wrong in the fundamentals of the whole thing that absolutely could not be put right. They actually looked all the way to the bottom and found that the whole building was standing in midair.13\n\nConsequently, everything that depends on mathematics – all the technology and machines brought into ‘existence’ through it – lacks foundation. The feeling of the entirety of existence floating in midair probably resonated at the time of publication in the year before the outbreak of the First World War, yet, the humorous and exaggerated tone of the essay cautions against taking the assertion at face value. Moreover, the speaker in the essay cannot easily be equated with Musil but has to be understood as a fictional mouthpiece through which he develops a particular view in a hyperbolic manner. The concluding paragraph then spells out the serious concerns that underlie the self-professed ‘playfulness’14 of the previous lines, as it clarifies that the foundational questions in maths stand for a general crisis and ‘lack of culture’15 and that mathematicians’ reactions to their problems can show literary writers and intellectuals how to respond to theirs.\n\nMusil’s essay celebrates mathematicians’ pragmatism. The building of mathematics might stand in midair, but on the plus side, this does not stop mathematics from being extremely useful or life from being liveable: ‘the whole building was standing in midair. But the machines worked! We must assume from this that our existence is a pale ghost; we live it, but actually only on the basis of an error without which it would not have arisen.’16 The essay then praises the reaction of mathematicians who continue to believe in the power and value of maths. This constitutes a contrast to other fields and professions where fundamental questions are treated less pragmatically and criticism of reason leads to its renouncement: ‘After the Enlightenment the rest of us lost our courage.’17 Taking mathematicians as an example for dealing with crises, non-mathematicians too, so the essay suggests, should continue to build on reason, the Enlightenment tradition and its still valuable results – even if aspects of it might have become compromised.\n\nMusil’s essay then goes on to argue for the need for literary writers in particular to emulate mathematicians. The speaker complains that contemporary literature has turned away from the rational and has focussed on feeling and aesthetics, so much so that it injures understanding of life and has ruined ‘our imaginative literature to such an extent that, whenever one reads two German novels in a row, one must solve an integral equation to grow lean again.’18 The essay thus opposes early twentieth-century lamentations of rationalisation and excesses of the intellect and argues against limiting reason to science. Instead, it introduces the idea that successfully being modern requires a ‘mathematical man’ who holds on to reason despite its drawbacks, and it particularly calls for ‘mathematical writers’ who recognise the continued value of reason for their work. The following literary analysis of Musil’s debut novel examines a fictional perspective on the suggestion that to live through and make sense of the crisis-ridden early twentieth century, people, most of all literary writers, have to become ‘mathematical men’.\n\nMusil: The Confusions of Young Törless (1906)\n\nTörless, the protagonist of Musil’s novel, is an adolescent in an elite boys’ academy and he experiences the time of transition between childhood and adulthood as deeply unsettling. When his classmate Basini steals money and then submits to torture by his classmates, Törless becomes aware of a hidden side of society and of the disconcerting sexual attraction he feels towards Basini. But the confusion goes deeper; Basini triggers the realisation in Törless that ‘[t]here had always been something that his thoughts could not deal with.’19 While partly a Bildungsroman, the novel goes beyond a focus on Törless’s education and development. The philosophical and ideological positions the adolescent encounters open the novel to a broader picture of society in the early twentieth century which, like Törless, struggles with the loss of former certainties, revaluates the place of reason and rationality, and strives towards overcoming conflicting views.20\n\nThe novel signals the potentially leading role of mathematics when Törless, realising that what he calls ‘the wooden ruler of rationalism’21 cannot fathom certain aspects of reality, turns to mathematics to attempt to grasp the whole of confusing reality. As mathematics is commonly set at the apex of rationality this move might appear counter-intuitive, yet, Törless is prompted to turn to maths for help when he finds that several of its concepts seem to be contrary to reason: the infinite, for example, and irrational and imaginary numbers. These examples show, so Törless explains to his classmate, that mathematics ‘sometimes runs so contrary to the understanding … The idea of the irrational, of the imaginary, of lines that are parallel and intersect in infinity – somewhere or other – excites me.’22 Törless hopes that examining these curious cases in the most rational domain will help him come to terms with his wider confusions regarding the unintelligible elements of his teenage life and the special qualities of the early twentieth century.\n\nImaginary numbers prove the most fruitful example to examine the aspect of mathematics that resists rational understanding. Törless wonders about the very nature of an imaginary number: ‘It doesn’t exist … there can’t be such a thing as a real number that’s the square root of something negative.’23 It here helps to remind ourselves of the definition of imaginary numbers: i = √–1. This is the same as: i2 = –1. In the real number system, which is most commonly used in everyday calculations, square roots can only be positive. Törless’s contention that imaginary numbers do not ‘exist’ echoes concerns by actual mathematicians who, well into the nineteenth century, considered imaginary numbers to be dubious. The very term ‘imaginary number’ suggests a problematical relation between √–1 and some kind of reality.24 The problem for both Törless and nineteenth-century mathematicians is that imaginary numbers do not have a direct correspondence in nature; they do not relate to anything ‘real’. They thus contradict realist notions, such as expressed in Galileo Galilei’s famous phrase that mathematics is the language of the Book of Nature.25 In this view, correspondence to nature ultimately guarantees the existence and meaning of mathematical objects. Mathematicians today happily calculate with imaginary numbers and accept them as ‘real’ or as ‘unreal’ as any other number.26 In the early twentieth century, imaginary numbers were already widely accepted, so Young Törless primarily draws on historical and metaphorical questions around imaginary numbers.\n\nIn the novel, Törless concludes that, since there are no ‘real’ counterparts of imaginary numbers, mathematics does not have a direct referential relationship with nature. He reasons that it consequently has to be set on purely mathematical foundations and sets out to learn these. With this endeavour Törless mirrors turn-of-the-century research into the foundations of mathematics and, as the novel and Musil’s nonfictional writing propose, into the fundamental structures of modern life itself. Unsurprisingly, teenage Törless does not acquire advanced mathematical knowledge, but his enquiries nevertheless result in an experience of the crisis in mathematics. Indeed, the novel points to the foundational debate that took place at the time of publication when Törless’s friend doubts that even mathematicians themselves know the foundations of their field: ‘These grown-ups and clever people have completely spun themselves into a web, one stitch supporting the next … ; but no one knows where the first stitch is, the one that holds everything up.’27 Törless himself maintains a pragmatist stance, arguing that the success of maths implies its truth. And when he moreover realises that the ambiguous, unexplained elements make mathematics more powerful, the novel foreshadows the argument in Musil’s essay that uncertainty enables existence: ‘we live it, but actually only on the basis of an error without which it would not have arisen.’28 In Törless, the protagonist notices a similar process regarding the specific case of imaginary numbers, which allow one to arrive at a ‘real’ result that otherwise could not have been attained:\n\nin that kind of calculation you have very solid figures at the beginning, … And there are real numbers at the end of the calculation as well. But they’re connected to one another by something that doesn’t exist. Isn’t that like a bridge consisting only of the first and last pillars, and yet you walk over it as securely as though it was all there?29\n\nThe metaphor of imaginary numbers here illustrates the function of the not-fully-explainable to lead over stretches of missing ground and arrive at secure results. Methods to cover the gaps generated by lost certainties have wider significance for Törless, not least since he turns to mathematics in order to deal with the adolescent feeling of being in the air. When he recognises that uncertainties in the foundations of mathematics do not inhibit its usefulness, he can similarly accept confusions in his life, leave the critical bridging time of adolescence behind and approach adulthood, a once-again stable state. In other words, the way forward for Törless – and by implication for the young twentieth century and its search for foundations – is to emulate mathematics, to ‘be mathematical’.\n\nThe model of mathematics helps Törless end the uncertainties of the in-between teenage years, but, as Musil’s novel implies, he should have had it easier. Specifically, fictional literature should have provided a guide over the stormy waters of adolescence. Unlucky for Törless then that the school library is not well stocked: ‘That illusion, that trick favouring personal development, was missing from the institute.’30 This remark at the beginning of the novel alerts the reader to the fact that the imaginary domain is part of literature more prominently than of mathematics.31 The fact that appropriate fiction is unavailable to Törless and he has to resort to mathematics is echoed in ‘The Mathematical Man’ and its lament that contemporary German literature is inadequate to the demands of its time. If Musil’s essay then praises mathematicians’ continued belief in reason as a model for literary writers, the novel illustrates how mathematics takes on a model function for Törless that literature should have fulfilled, and shows how its own novelistic engagement with maths negotiates the changing role of reason in the transitional age of the early twentieth century. Importantly, in both Musil’s texts, mathematics has to be thought in its specifically modern form that puts into question its certainty and truth and involves the pragmatic use of imaginary domains.\n\nZamyatin: ‘On Literature, Revolution, Entropy, and Other Matters’\n\nYevgeny Zamyatin also introduces what he calls the ‘new mathematics’32 as a model for a modern way of being and writing both in essayistic and novelistic form. Where Musil emphasises the continued value of maths despite uncertainties regarding its foundations, however, Zamyatin treats the absolute truth of mathematics and its applicability to the world as a given and establishes that problematical developments call for new understandings not of maths but of nature. In his view, the modern transformation of mathematics shows the necessity of a fundamentally changed understanding of reality and of a new literature appropriate to it.\n\n‘On Literature, Revolution, Entropy, and Other Matters’ indicates some key concerns of Zamyatin’s thinking even in its title, and the interrelation of literature, politics and science is also present in a text such as his dystopian novel We (1921), as are mathematical metaphors and examples, which are also used in the essay. In ‘On Literature’, Zamyatin explicitly contrasts traditional mathematics, exemplified by the immensely influential and long-lived geometry of Euclid, and a modernised new mathematics, associated with the work of Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792–1856). Geometry, literally the measurement of the earth (from Ancient Greek: gê- ‘earth’ and -metría ‘measurement’), had been largely determined by Euclid’s work for over two thousand years. Zamyatin establishes geometry as a tool to survey and understand the world more broadly when he introduces an event that fundamentally changed the mathematical landscape in the nineteenth century: ‘Lobachevsky cracks the walls of the millennia-old Euclidean world with a single book, opening a path to innumerable non-Euclidean spaces: this is revolution.’33 Lobachevsky showed that Euclid’s geometry is not the only possible geometry and that non-Euclidean geometries can be taken to better describe the world: Euclidean geometry is suitable to planes but not to curved surfaces, and since the earth is a sphere and therefore curved, it requires surveying with non-Euclidean geometry. When Zamyatin introduces Lobachevsky’s work as a revolution, he establishes that with it, fundamental tools of thought and ways of understanding the world have to be reconsidered.\n\nHaving used maths as an example of how revolutionary changes institute new views of and approaches to the world, Zamyatin extends the argument to literature. He suggests that if non-Euclidean geometry reveals that measuring the earth with the long-trusted tools of Euclidean geometry is no longer adequate, so literary writers have to similarly realise that their traditional ways of describing the world produce overly simplistic representations of that world. Instead of adhering to realism and depicting the surface in conventional ways – ‘clicking his Kodak (genre)’34 – a literary writer has to take a similar step as mathematicians and establish new literary styles adequately to engage with reality. Zamyatin explicitly equates literary realism with Euclidean geometry and deduces the need for new literary forms from the advent of the new mathematics:\n\nScience and art both project the world along certain coordinates… . All realistic forms are projections along the fixed, plane coordinates of Euclid’s world. These coordinates do not exist in nature. Nor does the finite, fixed world; this world is a convention, an abstraction, an unreality. And therefore Realism … is unreal. Far closer to reality is projection along speeding, curved surfaces – as in the new mathematics and the new art.35\n\nZamyatin thus does not disavow the possibility of realist accounts but argues that when non-Euclidean geometry outstrips traditional mathematics, it implies the need for equally new literary styles to represent reality: ‘Realism that is not primitive … consists in displacement, distortion, curvature, nonobjectivity.’36 Only with such a deeper and more adequate understanding of reality can literature be useful to the ‘new men’37 of the twentieth century. Zamyatin thus urges literature to implement in its domain the revolution of the new mathematics – we might say: the modern mathematics – and its more truthful representation of complex reality. In the next section, I analyse how Zamyatin establishes a similar call for a deeper understanding of reality and new literature in his novel We.\n\nZamyatin: We\n\nMathematics is omnipresent in We: the first-person narrator D-503 is a mathematician, citizens in OneState are not named but numbered, and the four basic rules of arithmetic regulate all aspects of life, including sexual relationships, the moral system and art. At first sight, We takes a critical stance towards mathematics as a means of instituting totalitarian control, and D-503’s plan to celebrate the ‘mathematically perfect life of OneState’38 in writing appears to be misguided at best. The difference between D-503’s rationally produced text – he begins by copying out a newspaper article and announces his intention to continue writing in this factual manner – and traditional literature is made explicit when D-503 discredits the literature of the readers’ present: ‘I wondered, that the ancients did not immediately see how completely idiotic their literature and poetry was.’39 The sonnet ‘Happiness’ quoted above, however, alerts one to the fact that OneState’s mathematised literature is not necessarily an improvement on the works of Shakespeare and Dostoevsky.\n\nIn his records D-503 describes people and relationships in mathematical terms, drawing on shapes common in Euclidean geometry: ‘Her brows make a sharp mocking triangle’;40 ‘she’s got a simple round mind’;41 ‘[h]is forehead was a huge bald parabola’;42 ‘we’re a triangle, maybe not isosceles but still a triangle’.43 Yet, when he meets the enigmatic woman I-330, the mathematical imagery changes: D-503 notices ‘something about her eyes or brows, some kind of odd irritating X that I couldn’t get at all’44 and frets that ‘[t]his woman was just as irritating to me as an irrational term that accidentally creeps into an equation and can’t be factored out’.45 The mathematical terms here do not refer to the domain of certainty and rationality but to unknown and irrational values. Following the newly emerging emotion, confusion and sexual attraction expressed by these metaphors, D-503 begins a relationship with I-330 and encounters the Ancient House, a hideout with a secret tunnel to a world outside the bounds and rules of OneState. These experiences profoundly change his views, and he begins to measure the world along different coordinates: ‘The coordinates of the whole business all begin, of course, with the Ancient House. The X, Y, and Z axes that recently began serving as the basis of my whole world all start there.’46\n\nThe terms describing D-503’s changing views are remarkably similar to Zamyatin’s essay, and if ‘On Literature’ then goes on to demand a transformation of literary coordinates, We does indeed exhibit a change in the style of D-503’s records. Critics commonly comment on the fact that the rational style so consciously established at the outset of the novel is increasingly replaced by unordered, expressionistic diction. Gary Rosenshield describes this stylistic development as a ‘transformation of the narrator from mathematician to poet’.47 While Rosenshield’s analysis very successfully traces changes in D-503’s character and writing, the juxtaposition of mathematician and poet is misleading. Rather, shifts in D-503’s writing style are precisely in concert with his changing mathematical views, which move from a traditional belief in its certainty to the acceptance of apparently non-rational aspects.48 I consequently argue that the poet D-503 does not usurp the mathematician but that mathematics constitutes a crucial factor in producing D-503’s poetic self.\n\nMathematics in We is not synonymous with reason; this becomes clear when concepts such as the unknown value X, irrational terms and imaginary numbers provide D-503 with vocabulary to describe his confusion and grasp experiences that take place outside of OneState’s rational order. After the encounter with I-330, D-503 increasingly becomes aware of the fact that certain aspects of mathematics contradict OneState and its values. Notably, he remembers his first encounter with imaginary numbers and their troubling ‘inexistence’:\n\nOnce Pliapa told us about irrational numbers – and I remember how I cried, I beat my fists on the table and bawled: ‘I don’t want √–1! Take it out of me, this √–1!’ That irrational root grew in me like some alien thing, strange and terrifying, and it was eating me, and you couldn’t make any sense of it or neutralize it because it was completely beyond ratio.49\n\nDespite its apparently non-rational aspects, D-503 never doubts the truth of mathematics. Rather, he logically concludes that the existence of unknowns, irrationals and imaginaries in maths proves the fact that such elements similarly are part of life: ‘For every equation, every formula in the superficial world, there is a corresponding curve or solid. For irrational formulas, for my √–1, we know of no corresponding solids … [I]f we don’t see these solids in our surface world, there is for them, there inevitably must be, a whole immense world there, beneath the surface’.50 Maths thus retains its status as ultimate truth and hence supports criticism of complete rationalisation. Indeed, mathematics also serves as a tool for the enemies of OneState. The revolutionary Mephi live outside the city-state and plan its downfall, and significantly, they possess advanced mathematical knowledge with which they motivate their revolution. If numbers go on to infinity, so their argument goes, then there also has to be an infinite number of revolutions. The often-repeated view that the Mephi are opposed to rationality is therefore only partly correct: when they justify their aims with the help of mathematics, they use ‘the major language of reason’51 against OneState, yet, this language itself includes irrational and imaginary elements.\n\nD-503’s realisation of the existence of irrational and imaginary aspects in mathematics and life also leads him to call for a new style of writing that takes account of these; or rather, he notices that they have been influencing his records all along: ‘instead of the elegant and strict mathematical poem in honor of OneState, it’s turning out to be some kind of fantastic adventure novel. Oh, if only this really were just a novel instead of my actual life, filled with x’s, √–1, and degradations’.52 Mathematical imagery thus also describes the style of D-503’s records, which make up the novel We. They progressively deviate from the aim of objective and rational recording and instead become more and more subjective and disordered, increasingly including sudden shifts and fragmentary sentences. D-503’s initially realist recording thus turns to a modernist style that reflects his confusions and the non-rational aspects of reality. With this ‘non-rational’ way of writing D-503 opposes the ideology of OneState, but this changes when he is forced to have an operation to remove a part of the brain and thus realign him with the totalitarian order. The surgery removes the ‘imagination’, a brain section that houses all irrational feeling and deviationist tendencies. After the operation, D-503 betrays I-330, negates the validity of irrational and imaginary perspectives, holding that ‘reason has to win’,53 and returns to his rational writing style: ‘It is day. Clear. Barometer at 760.’54 ‘Cured’ of imagination, citizens are streamlined, completely happy and hardly human: ‘not “men” – that isn’t the word … Not men but some kind of tractors in human form.’55 We thus establishes the imagination as the ultimate enemy of mechanisation and as at the core of what it means to be human. Not least, the imagination is a vital part of literary production, and D-503’s resistance to totalitarian OneState manifests in a literary work – namely We itself. Yet, importantly, the imagination and its revolutionary potential also are part of mathematics. After the mass operation on the imagination, citizens of OneState will be unable to handle imaginary numbers and only have access to the ‘rational’ part of mathematics. Hope remains then that the revolutionary Mephi, who can draw on the entirety of this powerful tool to understand the world, might be victorious after all.\n\nWe distinguishes between a traditional notion of maths that lends itself to support rationalisation and modern mathematics, which implies a reconsideration of what counts as reality. As Zamyatin proposes in his essay, in We too, mathematics points to the fact that reality is not clearly ordered or wholly graspable, and the example of maths calls for a new way of writing that takes account of the ‘mathematically proven’ unknowns, irrational and imaginary parts of life. In Zamyatin’s writing, modern mathematics thus works as a model for literature to abandon naïve realism and find new means of expression.\n\nBeing modern = being mathematical = being imaginary\n\nMusil and Zamyatin’s texts express the need for a new literature, not unlike Ezra Pound’s famous modernist battle cry: ‘Make it new!’. Pound, too, looks to science and mathematics as inspirations for the new literature he envisions. When asking literature to produce ‘lasting and unassailable data’,56 he seems to imply that it can be true or false, just like scientific facts are commonly assumed to be true or false. Although the literary texts discussed here differ in the details of their engagements with the uncertainties of a specifically modern mathematics, they do all identify uncertainty and newness in mathematics itself and draw on precisely these aspects to indicate promising ways to modernise literature.57\n\nMusil and Zamyatin’s texts also show that nuanced engagement with mathematics does not necessarily place it at the heart of a threatening technology and inevitable rationalisation, but their modern notions allow them to connect literature and mathematical material in unforeseen ways. Musil’s texts engage with concerns that maths loses its power as its foundations are discovered to be uncertain. His essay and novel propose that this does not inhibit the usefulness of maths but indeed leads to its status as a model of pragmatist use and continued value in changing times. In contrast to Musil’s engagement with foundational questions and his emphasis on the enduring value of reason, Zamyatin does not challenge mathematics or its representational relationship to the world. Rather, he employs the example of maths to illustrate why writers cannot approximate twentieth-century life by representing surface reality and thereby champions greater attention to the irrational as the source of individuality and resistance to totalising movements. In this way, modern mathematics offers the writers different models to develop new literary forms with which to respond to the pressures of modern experience.\n\nThe fruitfulness of considering mathematics and literature together was and is not only noticed from the literary side. Indeed, since the 1990s historians of mathematics have paid increasing attention to aspects of crisis and anxiety in the process of modernisation; among them Herbert Mehrtens and Jeremy Gray most prominently consider the possibility of understanding the ‘foundational crisis’ of mathematics as part of the wider sense of crisis in the early twentieth century and to thus speak not only of a modern but of a modernist mathematics. In other words, while it is generally accepted that the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw modernisation and the consequent development of a modern mathematics, some historians of mathematics argue for regarding this transformation as part of more general movements and thus include mathematics in the notion of modernist culture.58 Both Musil and Zamyatin’s texts advocate considering mathematics as part of a broader understanding of culture when they connect its development with their analyses of the early twentieth century and with new trends in literature. The fact that both writers engage with mathematics in essayistic as well as novelistic work further indicates their challenges to boundaries between the factual and the fictional. Moreover, Musil plays with genre expectations when he adopts a fictional speaker in his essay, and Zamyatin uses a speech from the fictional character I-330 as an epigraph to ‘On Literature’ and takes up her argument in the main body of his essay. A further factor in their undermining of any clear distinction between factual and fictional writing is their emphasis on the importance of the imaginary for reality. Musil’s texts show that ‘inexistent’ imaginary domains make possible transitions to once-more-stable states, and Zamyatin’s We develops the idea that abandoning the imaginary means ceasing to be human. Both writers consequently establish imaginary numbers as a key part of modern mathematics and employ the concept as a central metaphor. ‘Being modern’ thus might partly be equated to ‘being mathematical’, but the ‘equation’ for Musil and Zamyatin also necessitates a third term: being modern ‘=’ being mathematical ‘=’ being imaginary.\n\nNotes"
