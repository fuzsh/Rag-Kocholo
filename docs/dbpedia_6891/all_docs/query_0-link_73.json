        "text": ".\n\nExcerpted from a draft for my long-delayed essay (almost a small book now) on the relationship of revolutionary Marxism to revolutionary liberalism.\n\n.\n\nIt is difficult to even mention the concept of civilization without conjuring up images of Occidental hauteur. One is immediately reminded of the so-called â€œcivilizing missionâ€ undertaken by the great colonial powers of Europe. The wordâ€™s origins, however, prove far more benign. Nevertheless, the timing of its emergence in history cannot be thought a mere coincidence. â€œCivilizationâ€ is an invention of the bourgeois epoch. According to the French semiotician Ã‰mile Benveniste, the term first appeared in print in a 1757 book by the Marquis de Mirabeau.1Â Though it derives more generally from the Latin civilis, denoting a higher degree of urbanity and legality, â€œcivilizationâ€Â in its modern sense dates only from the Enlightenment. In its post-1765 French usage, Benveniste observed that here â€œcivilisation meant the original, collective process that made humanity emerge from barbarity, and this use was even then leading to the definition of civilisation as the state of civilized society.â€2Â From there, the concept was then imported to Great Britain by Scottish Enlightenment figures like Ferguson, Millar, and Smith. This most likely came through their interactions with the French physiocrats Quesnay, Necker, and Turgot.3 Freudâ€™s suggestion in Civilization and Its Discontents â€” that the civilizing process of society in history resembles the maturation of the individual4 â€” was already largely anticipated by Ferguson in the introductory paragraph to his Essay on the History of Civil Society. There he asserted: â€œNot only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilization.â€5Â For Millar, as it was for Smith, civilization was marked by the development of a complex division of labor, what he called â€œthe distinctions of professions and of ranks.â€ With the further articulation of this system of distinctions, â€œthe human mind is cultivated and expanded; and man rises to the highest pitch of civilization and refinement.â€6Â Smith reaffirmed Millarâ€™s identification of civilized society as being one in which there was a highly-developed system of ranks. At one point, Smith clarified that whenever he used the term â€œcivilized society,â€ what he really meant was just a â€œsociety where the distinction of ranks has once been completely established.â€7\n\nBesides Benveniste, the German-Jewish sociologist Norbert Elias and his Austrian exegete Helmut Kuzmics also picked up on this civilizational theme of Mirabeauâ€™s. One of Eliasâ€™ most interesting arguments centers on the transmission of certain conventions from pre-bourgeois European court life â€” an attention to good manners, etiquette, dress codes, and behavioral norms â€” to bourgeois civil society rising out of the collapse of the feudal order. Although later philosophers of moral sentiment like Hume and Smith did much to displace aristocratic â€œvirtueâ€ through their valorization of bourgeois self-love,8 these vestiges of courtly politesse in civic politeness9 account for the high premium that was placed on â€œcourtesyâ€ (courtoisie, cortesia) and â€œcivilityâ€ (civilitÃ©, civiltÃ , ZivilitÃ¤t) in early bourgeois circles.10Â Kuzmics is correct to add, however, that the carryover from courteous modes of conduct would have been more direct among members of the grande bourgeoisie.11Â But this historical lineage passed down from medieval court society was only one part of what Elias and Kuzmics called â€œthe civilizing process.â€ More broadly, what this process entailed was a transition from external restraints imposed from without to internal restraints imposed from within; one of the defining features of civilization for Elias was precisely this regime of self-restraint.12Â Some have noted a similarity between Eliasâ€™ notion of â€œrestraintâ€ through the civilizing process and Foucaultâ€™s later concept of â€œdisciplineâ€ through correct training,13 but this similarity is only apparent. Self-restraint for Elias has far more in common with Freudâ€™s psychoanalytic category of repression.14Â Apart from these aristocratic frills and ruffles adorning bourgeois civilization, there were several forms of self-restraint peculiar to the modern world. As Elias and Kuzmics each acknowledge, these usually had to do with vocational norms and expectations associated with the workplace (rather than the banquet hall, the baronial court, or the curia regis).15 The primary locus of modern civilization would thus seem to reside in labor.\n\nHere, the meaning of â€œcivilizationâ€ examined by Elias and Kuzmics reconnects with that of Benveniste, Lucien Febvre, and the political economists like Smith, Ferguson, and the physiocrats. Of the new behaviors inculcated as a result of the generalization of the wage-relationship â€” along with the progressive refinement of the social division of labor and the more precise measurement of the labor-time expended â€” moderation, diligence, expedience, and what E.P. Thompson called â€œtime-disciplineâ€ were foremost. From the schoolyard to the factory floor, both children and adults now â€œentered the new universe of disciplined time.â€16 Max Weber, commenting upon the utilitarian ethos of Benjamin Franklinâ€™s advice in Poor Richardâ€™s Almanack, recorded that for the modern bourgeoisie, â€œ[h]onesty is useful, because it assures credit; so are punctuality, industry, frugality, and that is the reason they are virtues.â€17 Beyond these highly-valued bourgeois personality traits (or â€œcivic virtuesâ€), this civilizing process in modern society moves from the ethical domain of individual behavior to the political domain of liberal policies of governance. The old practices of government-controlled monopolies, tariffs, protectionism, and trade restrictions â€” in short, of French and British mercantilism and German cameralism â€” now appeared antiquated and barbaric. With respect to these more specifically bourgeois aspects of civilization, Kuzmics asserts:\n\nFrom [the physiocrats] on, the French concept of civilization is wedded to the bourgeois notion of progress; knowledge turns into one of its central categories; the concept of â€œbeing civilizedâ€ is transferred from the behavior of individuals to the state, the constitution, the educational system (and access to that system by the populace) and to a penitentiary system which is seen to be barbaric. Social inequality, anchored in feudal barriers, appears as barbaric and unreasonable. The same perspective is brought to bear on the lack of economic freedom imposed by government trade restrictions. The refinement of manners and the pacification of civil society are supposed to be the consequence of civilization in this wider sense.18\n\nThat â€œcivilization,â€ a concept born of the Enlightenment, should bear the imprint of the narrative of progress should not come as a shock to anyone. Indeed, the Swiss philologist and literary critic Jean Starobinski not long ago suggested that â€œ[t]he word civilization, which denotes a process, entered the history of ideas at the same time as the modern sense of the word progress.â€19 As such, it would appear that â€œcivilizationâ€ is perhaps a distant cousin of the later concept of â€œmodernization,â€ as a process implying progress or enhanced development over time, though Kuzmics warns against such interpretations.20 Already by 1775, Diderot was using the term in exactly this sense: â€œ[C]ivilization follows from the inclination which leads every man to improve his situation.â€21 Condorcet was even more wildly optimistic than Diderot when it came to the linkage between progress and civilization. It was while awaiting the guillotine, at the height of the Terror, that Condorcet penned his famous ode to progress, A Sketch for an Historical Picture of the Future Progress of the Human Mind (1793), in which he asked:\n\nWill all nations necessarily approach one day the state of civilization achieved by those peoples who are most enlightened, freest, and most emancipated from prejudice, such as the French and the Anglo-Americans? Will we necessarily see the gradual disappearance of that vast distance now separating these peoples from the servitude of nations subjected to kings, the barbarism of African tribes, the ignorance of savages? Are there regions of the globe where the inhabitants have been condemned by their environment never to enjoy liberty, never to exercise their reason? Do the differences in enlightenment, resources, or wealth so far observed between the different classes within civilized peoples â€” the inequality that the initial advances of society augmented and may even have produced â€” derive from the very nature of civilization or from the current imperfections of the social art? Must these differences continually diminish, giving way to the real equality that is the ultimate goal of the social art, that of reducing the very effects of natural differences in individual capacities while allowing for the continuation only of an inequality useful to the common interest because it will foster the progress of civilization, education, and industry without entailing dependence, humiliation, or impoverishment?22\n\nThe passage from Condorcet excerpted here above introduces a third meaning to the term â€œcivilization,â€ besides its association with mannerly ennoblement and technical progress. This third meaning of â€œcivilizationâ€ attains its significance only in contradistinction to its conceptual antipode, â€œbarbarism.â€ Between these two poles one might find a spectrum of intermediate stages, ranging from conditions of relative civility to conditions of relative barbarity. Another term, â€œsavagery,â€ enters in at times, as well. In most discussions of civilizational benchmarks during the Enlightenment, Foucault rightly noted, the â€œsavageâ€ suggests a pre- or non-civilized person living in a state of nature, whereas the â€œbarbarianâ€ suggests a person who is actively opposed to civilization, who is thus anti-civilizational, living in a state of general crudity and boorishness.23 This understanding corresponds, more or less, to the somewhat lacking categories established by Louis Morgan and later employed by Engels in his writings on The Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State: 1.) savagery (hunger-gatherer, predominantly nomadic, or pre-historic society); 2.) barbarism (agrarian, predominantly rural, or traditional society); and 3.) civilization (commercial/industrial, predominantly urban, or modern society).24 Civilization would thus seem to presuppose widespread urbanization (or â€œcitificationâ€): â€œBefore rusticus and rusticitas can be defined as antonyms of urbanus and urbanitas, there must be cities and people who live in cities.â€ According to these antinomic pairs, the civilization of the city was counterposed to the barbarism of the countryside. This opposition was reflected, as Starobinski points out, in dictionaries from the time. â€œUnlike the bourgeois, peasants are not civilized,â€ asserted FuretiÃ¨reâ€™s Dictionnaire of 1694.25\n\nIndeed, one of the commonest misunderstandings about the concept of â€œcivilizationâ€ concerns its specific reference to the capitalist social formation. Building on the work of the French and British political economists, Marx and Engels used the term â€œcivilizationâ€ as basically equivalent to modern bourgeois society. â€œ[Capitalism] forces all nations to adopt the bourgeois mode of production or go under,â€ they wrote in the Manifesto. â€œ[I]t forces them to introduce so-called civilization amongst themselves, i.e., to become bourgeois.â€26 This is a point Spencer Leonard brought home in a recent interview with Kevin Anderson, in combating charges of â€œEurocentrismâ€ and â€œOrientalismâ€ that post-colonial theorists like Edward Said have recently leveled at Marxism.27 â€œCapitalism for Marx is not a superior civilization,â€ Leonard elucidates. â€œRather, capitalist society is â€˜civilization,â€™ per seâ€¦The issue is the universality of the form realizing itself at the level of world historyâ€¦[W]hen he is using that language, he is talking about a social form, one that just happens to have emerged in Europe.â€28 Nor is this merely some sort of clever rhetorical flourish. Certain selections from Engels clearly seem to substantiate Leonardâ€™s general equation of modern bourgeois society with civilization as a whole: â€œ[C]ivilization is that stage of development of society at which division of labor, the resulting exchange between individuals, and commodity production, which combines the two, reach their full development and revolutionize the whole of hitherto existing society.â€29 Already, Marx had on several occasions written of â€œthe civilizing aspects of capital,â€ insofar as it helped to eradicate the forms of slavery and serfdom that preceded it.30 In his preparatory work on the Grundrisse, he had similarly praised â€œthe civilizing influence of external trade.â€31 But perhaps the most irrefutable proof that, for Marx, capitalist society is â€œcivilizationâ€ can be found in his endorsement of John Wadeâ€™s provocative proposition that â€œCapital is only another name for civilization.â€32 Marx, who did not think much of Wadeâ€™s original contributions to the study of political economy (accusing him at one point of plagiarism), still admitted that â€œWade isâ€¦correctâ€¦insofar as he posits capital = civilization.â€33\n\nOn this level, then, it appears that the commonplace objection to the identification of civilization with the capitalist West, an identity upheld by classical liberals and Marxists alike, commits a category mistake. The simultaneous birth of civilization and modernity in Europe, and along with it their exponential growth in productivity, has nothing at all to do with the supposedly innate â€œsuperiorityâ€ of Western peoples or cultural institutions. This is why the pseudo-radicalism of postmodern hermeneutics â€” which interprets the logic of capital to be somehow intrinsically white, Christian, European, male, etc. â€” is utterly inadequate to the understanding of civilization, qua bourgeois society. In fact, this view even tends to reinforce the chauvinist discourse that treats all the accomplishments of Western civilization as the outcome of the heroic feats of the industry, ingenuity, and spirit of innovation that supposedly characterize all white, Christian, European males. Such accounts overlook the practically ubiquitous stereotype of the peasant in medieval Europe, usually depicted as monumentally lazy, shiftless, and ignorant. Neither Marx nor Engels had much patience for the quaint customs and inoffensive, folksy conventions of traditional society, no matter where these traditions stemmed from. Nowhere was the authorsâ€™ disgust with reactionary traditionalism more evident than in Engelsâ€™ evaluation of â€œThe Civil War in Switzerlandâ€ in the Deutsche BrÃ¼sseler Zeitung in 1847. Engels could not for an instant countenance sympathy with the stout resistance of these â€œAlpine shepherdsâ€ â€” whose favorite pastimes included acorn-eating, cheese-making, yodeling, and chastity.34 The fact that such unrelenting criticisms were directed as the traditions of a country in the heart of Europe should put to rest the notion that either Marx or Engels unconsciously harbored racist or Orientalist sentiments. Both were fairly ecumenical (or, to put it differently, â€œequal opportunityâ€) when it came to choosing objects to critique.35 The ruthless criticism of everything existing could leave no rock unturned.\n\nRelated to such objections to the concept of â€œcivilization,â€ especially its normative or universalizing claims, is a tendency to prefer speaking of so many particular â€œcultures.â€ Sadly, this preference, like several others acquired during the postmodernist â€œcultural turnâ€ â€” which sought relativize the hegemonic pretensions of the Western civilization â€” harkens back to reactionary antimodernist (even fascist) sources. The invidious contrast between â€œcultureâ€ and â€œcivilizationâ€ goes back to the sociologist Alfred (brother of Max) Weberâ€™s conservative and irrationalist drift following the German defeat in World War I. Typically, the distinction is this: Kultur is understood as authentic, concrete, and firmly rooted in real, organic community traditions; Zivilisation is understood as superficial and abstract, rootlessly trailing after imaginary, inorganic social trends. Weber was looking to separate out two distinct components of human social life that he believed had become rather carelessly intermingled. He thus fulminated against Hegelianism, and by extension Marxism, which he felt had indiscriminately united both the â€œintellectualâ€ and â€œspiritualâ€ dimensions of social existence.36 Much of the mischief, Weber surmised, arose from an ambiguity in the meaning of the German term Geist, which at once signifies both â€œmindâ€ and â€œspirit.â€37 â€œThis [Hegelian] notion of objective spirit [Geist] bound upâ€¦intellectual elements (mastery of existence) withâ€¦elements of spiritual expression, thusâ€¦identifying intellect and soul, and hopelessly confusing civilization and culture,â€ recorded Weber.38 Civilization was the cerebral sphere of science, progress, technology, and rationalization in their universal unfolding â€” â€œthe epitome of mankindâ€™s increasing enlightenment.â€39 Oppositely, culture was the spiritual sphere of art, religion, convention, and intuition of a particular life-world in its givenness40 â€” â€œsimply the soulâ€™s will and expressionâ€¦of an â€˜essenceâ€™ lying behind all intellectual mastery of existence.â€41 The civilizational subject is the individual or ego who has developed his own outlook, worldview, or perspective.42 The cultural subject is the community â€” the family, church, or nation â€” with its own â€œyearnings,â€ desires, or â€œdestiny.â€43 Weberâ€™s contemporary, the phenomenologist Max Scheler, associated civilization with a deep â€œhatred of the world.â€ This hatred originated, the philosopher conjectured, first with Judaism (following Sombart)44 and then later with Calvinism (following the elder Weber).45 â€œEverything can rise again in the area of pure, spiritual culture,â€ wrote Scheler in 1917. â€œBut in the area of technical values,â€¦values of utility, a renascence would be tantamount to â€˜regress,â€™â€¦because continuous progress and internationality belong to the cosmos of civilization [Zivilisationskosmos].â€46\n\nMore temperate minds have in the past expressed some reservations at setting up such a rigid bifurcation between the concepts of â€œcultureâ€ and â€œcivilization.â€ All the same, however, they also recognized that any attempt to privilege the former to the detriment of the latter would be a reactionary gesture. Some of them, like Elias, have acknowledged the partial legitimacy of distinguishing these terms, according to their normal usages. In his sociogenetic account of this distinction, Elias conveyed the progressive character of civilization: â€œâ€˜Civilizationâ€™ describes a process or at least the result of a process. It refers to something which is constantly in motion, constantly moving â€˜forward.â€™â€47 Moreover, he highlighted its implicit internationalism. â€œ[T]he concept of civilization plays down the national differences between peoples; it emphasizes what is common to all human beings,â€ he observed. â€œIn contrast, the German concept of Kulturplaces special stress on national differences and the particular identity of groups.â€48 Elias was, without a doubt, well-acquainted with the distinction between culture and civilization, having once trained with Alfred Weber and his erstwhile associate, Karl Mannheim (who defended Weberâ€™s choice to disentwine the two terms).49 The Austrian modernist and critic Robert Musil had a more sardonic take on this conceptual division between culture and civilization. In his review of Spenglerâ€™s Decline of the West, Musil confessed that figuring out â€œ[h]ow to distinguish between culture and civilization is to my way of thinking an old and really fruitless quarrel.â€ Despite his professed indifference, he could still discern of some of the finer points with either word. â€œEvery civilization is characterized by a certain technical mastery over nature and a very complicated system of social relations,â€ Musil wrote in 1921, while mocking the pedantic tone of those who insisted on the opposite meanings of the two words. â€œAn immediate relation to the essence of things is almost always ascribed to culture, a kind of fateful security of human demeanor and an assurance that is still instinctive, in comparison to which reason, the fundamental symptom of civilization, is supposed to possess a somewhat lamentable uncertainty and indirectness.â€50 But it was without question Horkheimer and Adorno who most stringently criticized the tendency to exalt the â€œauthenticityâ€ of Kultur against the purported â€œinauthenticityâ€ of civilisation. â€œIn the name of culture,â€ declared Adorno, â€œcivilization marches into barbarism.â€51 Of the various theorists to treat this opposition, Adorno, Horkheimer, and other members of the Frankfurt School were again the ones best able to make out the connection between the industrial revolution and the onset of modern civilization.52 To bemoan the loss of organic forms of â€œcultureâ€ in the face of modernizationâ€™s steady onslaught, however, was useless and regressive. They thus warned:\n\nOnly that consciousness which despairs of creating a human world out of freedom and consciousness will arrive at the point of sharply separating culture, as the creation of the spiritual, from the externality of civilization, of setting up culture against the latter and rendering it absolute. And often enough in so doing it opens the gate to the true enemy, barbarism. Whoever glorifies culture at the expense of civilization today is more concerned with setting up cultural preserves than with humanityâ€¦It is not proper to invoke culture against civilization. The gesture of invocation itself, the exalting of culture at the expense of mass society, the devoted consumption of cultural values as a confirmation of oneâ€™s elevated internal spiritual equipment, these are inseparable from the decadent character of the civilization. The invocation of culture is powerless.53\n\nBut if barbarism is admitted to exist in backward, traditional, or premodern communities, as well as in the atavistic appeal to cultural practices lost in the process of civilization, then where is that recognition, so central to the Marxist critique, of â€œthe â€˜barbarismâ€™ of bourgeois societyâ€ itself? As Losurdo rightly notes, this was one of Marxâ€™s and Engelsâ€™ most original and devastating insights.54 After all, it was not only civilization that they discerned in liberal bourgeois society. Contained within these very same forms of social organization there also lurked the possibility of a new and untold barbarism. The issue at hand here is the one Adorno and Horkheimer dealt with as â€œthe reversion of enlightened civilization to barbarism.â€55 Civilization itself, they maintained, had relapsed into a sort of barbaric state.56 Bourgeois society had mutated into what Adorno (and Lenin before him) called â€œcivilized barbarism.â€57 On the eve of the World War, in an article bearing the title of â€œCivilized Barbarism,â€ Lenin expressed his total astonishment at the way that â€œthe civilized nations [especially France and Great Britain] have driven themselves into the position of barbarians.â€58 Three decades earlier, Engels noticed this tendency of bourgeois society â€” that is, civilization â€” to increasingly move to conceal the traces of its own steady barbarization. â€œ[T]he more civilization advances,â€ he asserted, â€œthe more it is compelled to cover the ills it necessarily creates with the cloak of love, to embellish them, or to deny their existence.â€59 But of all the variations on this theme in the annals of Marxist literature, none approaches the poetry of Rosa Luxemburgâ€™s Junius Pamphlet: The Crisis of German Social Democracy:\n\nFriedrich Engels once said, â€œCapitalist society faces a dilemma, either an advance to socialism or a reversion to barbarism.â€ What does a â€œreversion to barbarismâ€ mean at the present stage of European civilization? We have read and repeated these words thoughtlessly without a conception of their terrible import. At this moment one glance about us will show us what a reversion to barbarism in capitalist society means. This world war means a reversion to barbarismâ€¦This is the dilemma of world history, its inevitable choice, whose scales are trembling in the balance awaiting the decision of the proletariat. Upon it depends the future of culture and humanity. In this war imperialism has been victorious. Its sword of murder has dashed the scales, with overbearing brutality, down into the abyss of shame and misery. 60\n\nThe naked barbarity that was seen in the trenches of Europe in World War I was simply the homecoming of what post-1848 European liberalism hoped to confine to its colonies. â€œThe profound hypocrisy and inherent barbarism of bourgeois civilization lies unveiled before our eyes,â€ commented Marx, in an 1853 article on India, â€œturning from its home, where it assumes respectable forms, to the colonies, where it goes naked.â€61 Still, this inherent barbarism of bourgeois society did not first show its face in the colonies. It had actually emerged several years prior, as Engels wrote in 1849, in the core of old Europe: â€œOn the one side the revolution, on the other the coalition of all outmoded estate-classes and interests; on the one side civilization, on the other barbarism.â€62\n\nNotes"
