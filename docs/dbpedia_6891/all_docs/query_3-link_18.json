        "text": "The protagonist of The Man Without Qualities, Ulrich, is in his early 30s, an engineer from a well-to-do family. Unmarried, physically attractive, socially prominent, he draws the attention of a variety of desirable women; he's had a string of mistresses. He possesses a keen intellect, however, which leads him to alternate truth-seeking and pleasure-seeking.\n\nMusil, like Theodore Dreiser, uses his gigantic novel as a vehicle to express all manner of opinions and observations, philosophical, psychological and political, and to paint a portrait of the Hapsburg empire on the brink of destruction. Vienna was one the great artistic and intellectual centers in modern history, and Musil is certainly aware of its impressive characteristics and citizenry.\n\nThe work has a huge cast of characters and a number of themes. Among them is the Collateral Campaign, meant to celebrate the 70th year of the reign of Hapsburg emperor Franz Josef, a project in which Ulrich becomes involved.\n\nAnother theme involves a psychotic murderer of prostitutes, Moosbrugger, who sits in his cell awaiting a verdict for his crimes--will he be executed or imprisoned in an asylum? His case has caused a sensation in Vienna and attracts the attention of Ulrich, who ponders the question of how to judge him. He (and Musil) are not moral absolutists. What should the punishment for Moosbrugger's crimes be? Clarisse, the wife of Ulrich's friend, Walter, urges Ulrich to liberate Moosbrugger. \"This murderer is musical ... ,\" she cries.\n\nIn certain respects, author and character are detached observers and critics of humanity with somewhat similar educational and social backgrounds. Musil was touched but also amused by the social and economic scrambling and competitiveness he witnessed, and he often wrote in an ironic mode.\n\nIn the third volume of The Man Without Qualities, Ulrich and his younger sister, Agathe, discover each other after having been separated for years. They quickly form a mutual attraction, intellectually and sexually. Ulrich says to her, \"Now I know what you are, you're my self love.\" More than one commentator has noted that the novel focuses on this motif of love as a form of self-realization. Indeed, later, Ulrich observes:\n\nIt goes back a very long way, this desire for a doppelg√§nger of the opposite sex, this craving for the love of a being that will be entirely the same as one's self, and yet another, distinct from one's self, a magical figure that is one's self and that does nevertheless remain a magical figure as well and is more than any figment of the imagination in that it has the life-breath of self-sufficiency and independence."
