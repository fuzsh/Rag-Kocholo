        "meta_description": "<p>It is universally acknowledged that style and meaning are closely associated with each other. This paper is intended to discuss the very special case pertaining to these two elements when both of them go together or even fuse with each other in certain literary or philosophical works. Taking Robert Musil and Nietzsche as two comparative examples, we try to explain the reasons why Musil as one of the most famous novelists in the 20th century was much more concerned about his Essayismus or essayism, and why a poetic philosopher Nietzsche paid unusual attention to his writing styles. To both Musil and Nietzsche, style and meaning could never be separated in their writings and thoughts. Thus, this paper might be an invitation not only to re-start the discussion about the literature and intellectual history, but also to re-open the dialogue between poetry and philosophy.</p>",
