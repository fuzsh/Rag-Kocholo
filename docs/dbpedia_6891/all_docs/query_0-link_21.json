        "text": "The Novelist as Pathologist\n\nWhy did the disasters of the twentieth century happen?\n\nBy “disasters” we mean the enslavement of nations to totalitarian regimes, the exterminations of class and race, the world wars and revolutions. We mean the apparent cultural degeneration of elites in democratic countries, whose members accommodated themselves one way or another to the power of these regimes and to the movements that instigated them, and finally, we mean the dogmatic claims of these movements over science and the human spirit. This “why” is the pragmatic and theoretical question giving rise to the political philosophy of Eric Voegelin.\n\nIn 1965, when the problems of culture and the spirit had not yet been studied very deeply within the academic discipline of political science, Voegelin said, “If, for instance, one wishes today to gain information about the great problems of thinking about order in Germany, one would be well advised to read the literary works of Robert Musil, Hermann Broch, Thomas Mann, Heimito von Doderer . . . rather than the professional literature of political science.”1\n\nElsewhere Voegelin gives partial credit to creative writers such as Proust, Valéry, and Joyce, for opening to him the field of consciousness,2 for in an age of spiritual closure, realms of experience that are ideologically closed for academic and political elites may still be open to poets and novelists, particularly ones who stand apart skeptically from movements and parties and report what they have known about life directly and pragmatically without being philosophically naïve.\n\nAt the head of Voegelin’s list of insightful German novelists is Robert Musil (1880-1942), whose name he often invokes in connection with the concept of “second reality,” which is Voegelin’s concept for a condition suffered by ideologues when they substitute imaginary cause and effect for normal people’s experiences.\n\nIdentifying “The Man Without Qualities”\n\nWhile [Heimito von] Doderer, not Musil, is the novelist who uses the terminology of “second reality” explicitly, there is another exclusively Musilian concept that Voegelin finds useful in explaining ideological susceptibilities, indeed the concept that gives rise to the title of Musil’s great unfinished novel, The Man without Qualities.3\n\n“Second reality” is a pathology of deformed consciousness that we might observe, not only in ideologists, but in many other people whose states of deformation nevertheless leave them functional; and such is its universality that in his Hitler and the Germans Voegelin illustrates it using the case of Don Quixote. On the other hand, one may find the concept of “man without qualities” harder to get at, even after reading Musil’s enormous novel. Provisionally, let us say that a “man without qualities” is the modern man who is susceptible to conceiving his own second reality or who allows the ideologists and intellectual faddists to impose one on him.\n\nWhatever structure of the soul is meant by “man without qualities,” it is the defect of character that gives rise to indulgence in second realities. And although one could perhaps find literary and philosophical antecedents for this condition, Voegelin does not provide them so we are forced to read Musil in order to fully discern Voegelin’s intention.\n\nHardly a Naïve Novelist\n\nA problem in developing the subject is the burden of riches one discovers in Musil. There is a congruence in Voegelin’s and Musil’s backgrounds and interests.4 As already noted, a novelist may capture experience with great directness without necessarily being philosophically naïve, and Musil, far frome being philosophically naïve, had written his dissertation as a phenomenological critique of Ernst Mach’s positivism.5\n\nHe wrote his dissertation while studying experimental psychology, problems of sense perception, Gestalt psychology, and (one may also assume) morbid psychology to some extent. And in the novel, Musil contextualizes his “second reality” pneumopathology with clinical cases: one plotline involves a sex murderer (Moosbrugger) and the fascination he arouses among “normal” people resulting in a plot to release him; another plotline involves a victim of childhood sex-abuse who has developed a fixation on Nietzche (Clarisse), who tours a sanitarium and feels kinship with its inmates and eventually suffers a breakdown; and there is plenty of hysteria spread around among other characters.\n\nMusil is interested in the same psychological issues that interest Freud and Jung. But Musil regards Freud with suspicion and perceives Freudianism’s growth as an ideological movement, and he doesn’t need Jung because he already has found his own handle on the typology of human personality and on mysticism.\n\nThe Range of Musil’s Thought\n\nMusil and his main character embrace the study of mysticism as they search for the authentic spiritual experience that has been lost to European culture at least since the Enlightenment. Musil is interested enough in the philosophy of history to write a skeptical essay on Spengler,6 and he is a European liberal who nods to the free market economics of the Viennese school.7\n\nThen there is Musil’s criticism of ideology and utopia which we will touch on here. And there is the heritage of early twentieth century Symbolist poetry, giving rise to early modern literature, out of which Musil’s fiction grows– which was also one of Voegelin’s literary interests and lies in part behind his study of consciousness and mysticism, about which we will try to say a little.\n\nTaking all these strands together, one acquires a surer sense of the milieu in which Voegelin arose, a context of themes and influences which have had an effect on the American conservative climate of opinion in the later twentieth century (not only through Voegelin). Musil deserves to be studied whole, both for his own sake and in relation to Voegelin.\n\nCreating a Parallel Universe\n\nThe fictional time of Musil’s tale is one year, Summer 1913 to Summer 1914, during which a thirty-three-year-old Viennese dilettante named Ulrich takes what he calls a vacation from life itself, in order to pursue life as a pure experiment. (The present paper is the fruit of a year of Musil reading, embarked upon as an experiment. This year of Musil studies parallels the plot of The Man Without Qualities.)\n\nI say “fictional time” because this novel is a story taking place in a fictional parallel universe. This fictional Vienna is not located in the Austro-Hungarian Empire but in a satirically named, fictional country called Kakania, after the honorific initials that precede the names of the dual monarchy’s rulers and its ministries and institutions.8 (As sarcastic as this kaka reference seems, Musil pays many backhanded compliments to a regime where life was definitely better than in the later independent Austrian republic entre deux guerres.)\n\nWhy does Musil underline the fictive nature of his novel this way? History is important to him, but he does not mean to write a historical novel,9 nor the Austrian War and Peace, and certainly not the Great Austrian Novel.10The Man Without Qualities is meant as a philosophical, psychological, and sociological novel, an investigation of the bankruptcy and lostness of people in a doomed regime. These people carry on with no inkling of its doom. It is a story in which events happen that did not happen in the actual Austria-Hungary of 1913, so that the collapse of the real Austria-Hungary as a society, starting with its elites, may be understood.\n\nA Larger Theme than the Nazi Catastrophe\n\nLet me note—by way of clarifying Musil’s intention in the novel—that one cannot look to The Man Without Qualities for an analysis of the rise of Nazism, even though Musil worked on it throughout the Nazi period until his death. Even so he had a full and immediate sense of Nazi evil; the Musils had to flee Austria because his wife was Jewish; and to protect himself in case his private papers were confiscated he referred to Hitler in his diaries under the code name “Carlyle.”\n\nIn Hitler and the Germans, Voegelin summarizes very well Musil’s address to his fellow writers “On Stupidity,” an analysis of the pneumopathology of a “higher stupidity” suffered by those who should know better but are able to become spiritually closed in order to accommodate themselves to ideological movements.11\n\nIn The Man Without Qualities, however, Musil believes he has higher concerns. There is a young antisemitic German nationalist in the novel (Hans Sepp), leader of a student circle in which poems of Stefan George are chanted chorally, and this character commits suicide rather ignobly; Musil admits that there could have been more realism and relevance in the portrait of this character and his National Socialist politics, “but there is already enough of the ridiculous in the book . . . ”12\n\nWhile acknowledging in his notes from the 1930’s that the present European catastrophe presents non-European enemies with the spectacle of a Europe destroying herself in an act of spite,13 he still believes that the catastrophe is only an episode, and that the cultural problem which is resulting in the rise of National Socialism will still be there when National Socialism has perished:\n\n“I dedicate this novel to German youth. Not the youth of today—intellectual vacuum after the war—quite amusing frauds—but the youth that will come after a time and that will have to begin exactly where we stopped before the war, etc. (On this also rests my justification for writing a prewar novel today!)”14\n\nNow these particular sentences are notes from the 1920’s for an unwritten preface. A “prewar” novel is absurd because it may not be fully clear to him yet that he is again living in a “prewar” period. He knows that a novel on pre-war Austria-Hungary is losing more of its relevance every day. He persists, however, because as an inwardly free man working in obscurity, this is how he conserves the modicum of truth that he feels has been entrusted to him.\n\nHe has little strength or influence to exert publicly against the ideological regime, and so he continues the struggle for his own experience of truth in private, even if it seems like an indulgence. We may recall Voegelin saying that “Nobody is obliged to participate in the “crisis of his time.”14a\n\nAloofness and social disconnection, ironically, are characteristic of Ulrich, the hero, who is a comic version or self-satire of Musil himself. But Ulrich is not the only man without qualities. “Of course they are all without qualities,” Musil says in his notes, “but in Ulrich it is somehow visible.”15\n\nThe other quality-less characters are seeking social connections ambitiously and frentetically, particularly Arnheim the fabulously wealthy son and heir of a German industrialist—a man who writes the most vacuous pop-psychology and political commentary best-sellers and who may be a spy. And there is also Ulrich’s cousin Diotima, the salonnière and hostess of a grand civic project called the Parallel Campaign, which is on its way to becoming the most important movement in Kakania because no one knows what it is while everyone has an idea of what they could turn it into.16\n\nHow to Function as a Man Without Qualities\n\nIf we translate “man without qualities” literally into Aristotelian terms, we would say “substance without accidents.” In a special way, Ulrich is the man without qualities par excellence and is ideally suited to involvement in this ridiculous movement because no one can know what he is while everyone has an idea of what they could turn him into. Of course, as a man, he possess all kinds of specific attributes and talents such as handsomeness, a capacity for recklessness that outwardly resembles bodily courage, athleticism, marksmanship, mathematical powers bordering on genius, and skepticism.\n\nBut, paradoxically, these attributes and talents have no connection to his core or essence as Ulrich. They are mere phenomena circulating around him, and other people are mere phenomena who react and relate to him; they contrive situations which call his “qualities” into play without involving his will or desire. How then can we like him or sympathize with him–if we do?\n\nBecause we sympathize with his alienation or we enjoy his passive infiltration of [Musil’s imagined] Kakanian society or we are titillated by his erotic adventures which are still those of a Schnitzlerian rogue. And how does one function at all as a quality-less man? The narrator says “nevertheless, one is undoubtedly conditioned by one’s qualities and is made up of them, even if one is not identical with them, and so one can sometimes seem just as much a stranger to oneself at rest as in motion.”17\n\nIn a chapter headed “Effect of a Man Without Qualities on a Man With Qualities,”18 Ulrich is given this name or diagnosis by his rather nerdy childhood friend Walter, the failed artist-husband of Clarisse the Nietzschean hysteric. And let it be said here that if being a man without qualities goes with amorality and passive involvement in entanglements imposed from the outside, then an implicit erotic triangle here between Ulrich, Clarisse, and Walter comes as no surprise and must eventually lead to trouble. Here is the dialogue in which the married couple discuss Ulrich’s condition:\n\nSuddenly [Walter] burst out: “He’s a man without qualities!”\n\n“What is that?” Clarisse asked, giggling.\n\n“Nothing. That’s just it, it’s nothing . . . There are millions of them nowadays . . . It’s the human type produced by our time . . . Just look at him! What would you take him for? Does he look like a doctor, a businessman, a painter, or a diplomat?”\n\n“He’s none of those,” Clarisse said dryly.\n\n“Well, does he look like a mathematician?”\n\n“I don’t know–how should I know what a mathematician is supposed to look like?”\n\n“You’ve hit the nail on the head! A mathematician looks like nothing at all–that is, he is likely to look intelligent in such a general way that there isn’t a single specific thing to pin him down! . . . ”19\n\nThe Tenth Character\n\nUlrich is an unusual man. He manifests characteristics of the Attention Deficit Disorder: an inability to confine himself to one job or career or subject of specialization or line of thought. So after failed careers in the army and engineering, he becomes a dilettante, and an intellectual with more than one area of scholarly competence.\n\nThe one field that appeals most to him, however, is pure mathematics, which suits him perfectly as a man who refuses to maintain any connection with society since pure mathematics is inapplicable to any concrete endeavor. But if morality is possible only for a unified character, then a man without qualities could be dangerous.\n\nEarlier, however, the novel’s narrator approaches the modern pathology in a slightly different way, as the problem of multiple “characters,” a loss of a core of selfhood in the division of the person between various social roles and identities:\n\n“. . . the inhabitant of a country has at least nine characters: a professional, a national, a civic, a class, a geographic, a sexual, a conscious, an unconscious, and possibly even a private character to boot. He unites them in himself, but they dissolve him, so that he is really no more than a small basin hollowed out by these many streamlets that trickle into it and drain out of it again, to join other such rills in filling some other basin.” (I, 30)\n\nBut the consequence of this is to create a “tenth character” which partakes of the void left over, the shadow from which these visible personalities emerge:\n\n“. . . nothing else than the passive fantasy of spaces yet unfilled. This permits a person all but one thing: to take seriously what his at least nine other characters do and what happens to them; in other words, it prevents precisely what should be his true fulfillment. This interior space–admittedly hard to describe–is of a different shade and shape in Italy from what it is in England, because everything that stands out in relief against it is of a different shade and shape; and yet it is in both places the same: an empty, invisible space, with reality standing inside it like a child’s toy town deserted by the imagination.” (I, 30)\n\nThe Negative Freedom in Kakania\n\nThis negative space or shadow space becomes visible only in Kakania, the mythical country of the tale, the kingdom and empire of Musilian irony where people enjoy “a negative freedom” along with “the sense of insufficient grounds for one’s own existence” and are surrounded by “a great fantasy” of things that never happened as by an ocean of possible existence (I, 31).\n\nSo Kakania is the invisible Austria-Hungary made visible by the exploration of possibilities that were never really explored in history. And so it can be a place where a mathematician manifests himself as the new alienated human type, through adventures that include attempting to release a convicted sex murderer from prison and an affair with his own sister that seems likely to lead to a suicide pact.\n\nWhat marvelous experiences, indulged in for their own sake, it would seem. And one takes a “vacation from one’s life” because one has a disturbing sense about what one is (or is not), and must try to find experiences that would compose a life. “In earlier times, one had an easier conscience about being a person than one does today,” the narrator says in Ulrich’s behalf about his bad conscience (I, 158). It is as if his disconnected qualities weigh too heavily upon them and he would like to become a man without qualities in the absolute sense.20\n\nThe Cult of Experience\n\nPersons, in the old sense, were centers of moral responsibility. Now there is a cult of experience, and the experiences are cultivated in an experimental way so that people talk about them as categories of being apart from the persons who experience them. “Who can say nowadays that his anger is really his own anger when so many people talk about it and claim to know more about it than he does.”\n\nSo just as “a world of qualities without a man has arisen,” so there are now “experiences without the person who experience them.” And Ulrich smiles and realizes that he is, “after all, a character, even without having a character. . .” (I, 159) But does he belong to a generation of men without qualities?\n\nHe says that the disposition of his generation was to protect one’s inner freedom by respecting “only a few external laws.” The result means “knowing, in every human situation, why one doesn’t need to be bound by [one’s own inner freedom], but never knowing what one does want to be bound by.” So it is a boredom with freedom that is purely negative. As a result, Ulrich’s connections to society have become “pale, shadowy, negative” (285-6). The “vacation from life,” then, perfects the state of noncommitment, noninvolvement, and heightens it to the level of ultimate absurdity.\n\nOne chapter heading reads, “Even a Man Without Qualities Has a Father With Qualities” (I,8). This father is a more or less Kantian legal scholar who plays the game of toadying to the aristocracy and eventually becomes a knight, receives the “von.” and is taken into the upper house of the legislature.21\n\nAt the father’s death, Ulrich and his long-lost sister Agathe (whom he hasn’t seen since early childhood) commit two thrill crimes involving the violation of their father’s will: burying him with his medals (the real ones are supposed to be returned to the Imperial government and copies affixed to his corpse) and changing the will to disinherit the sister’s husband, whom she wishes to divorce.\n\nThe brother-sister affair itself contains a gesture of revolt against the father. In each case the crime can escape detection and does not, in their eyes, authentically injure another party. There is, for example, something fundamentally unjust about the law of inheritance that would place Agathe’s share of the father’s estate entirely under her highly unsympathetic husband’s control, and so she alters the will so that it goes to a deserving third party and not herself.\n\nFalse Exhalation and the Loveless Self\n\nThe seemingly amoral Ulrich is more and more concerned in the abstract with ethical issues, and as he follows his instincts into a reading of ancient religious mystics, he finds his way to a belief in an unsystematic and spontaneous morality based on living spiritual experience, and comes to blame the Enlightenment for a spiritually stultifying cult of normality based on an instrumentalized reason. Here he seems about to find a cure for qualitylessness.\n\nThis mystical turn is a fairly direct statement of Musil’s own critical hypothesis: “I attempt to show what I call ‘the hole in European morality’–as in billiards, where sooner or later the ball gets stuck in such a hole–because it interferes with right action. It is, in a word, the false treatment that the mystic experience has been subjected to” (II, 1746).\n\nPlaced in the context of the novel, Musil’s theory is subject to irony. It partakes of the Nietzschean flavor of man divinizing himself, even as brother and sister place themselves on the level of gods and commit incest, like divine Egyptian monarchs or Wagner’s Siegmund and Sieglinde.22 And both experiments fail. They cannot halt the approaching World War, and the affair is a moment of false exaltation that coexists with a mood of depression and seems destined to lead to death. (Musil held several plot lines in reserve, the possibility of a suicide pact, or Ulrich’s decision to seek his death as a soldier at the front.)\n\nIn Hitler and the Germans, Voegelin summarizes the qualityless condition:\n\n“. . . the man without qualities is contrasted with the qualities without the man. The hero lives in a shadowy relationship with himself. He doesn’t recognize his qualities as his own because they operate as qualities of a particular role and not as the qualities of a man. The qualities are classified within specific contexts. The ‘man without qualities’ can do this and that’ he merely carries out different roles. The qualities are defined in terms of their social function. But no man belongs to them.”\n\n“In this context, the expression “spirit” has become meaningless; there’s no longer any meditative experience. The hero finds out that he doesn’t love himself. Aristotle had defined nous as the core of personality. If man doesn’t love this core, and thus his own self, he has lost contact with reality . . .”"
