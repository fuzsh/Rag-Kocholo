        "text": "Editors’ Preface\n\nGetting to know Robert Musil combines moments of joy with moments of strain. Being his friend is not easy work. He hints that he is aware of this situation, that he even approves of and perpetuates it by creating characters who cannot handle this type of friendship: Walter in Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, Aeins in Die Amsel, the fat friend from “Ein/ Der Mensch ohne Character.” Failed relationships belong to the markers he uses to paint around a vast undetermined space where affinity can take root and thrive on truthful, austere, yet ultimately generous exchanges. Through such mechanisms Musil chose and continues to choose his company carefully. He sought the unlikeliest conversation partners, and he clearly knew he would never sit in the same room with them: “Sometimes I wanted to write letters to a young man who lived eighty to one hundred years after me. Instead of that have them addressed to a young American alive now” (Tb 1 806). The contributors feel addressed by Musil and are indeed responding roughly eighty years later and/or from America. Our studies are situated on the field of affinity that Musil stakes out, and they are intended to enrich existing intellectual friendships and encourage new ones.\n\nThis volume emerges from a series of panels held at the thirty-ninth annual German Studies Association conference, which was held near Washington DC. It also still shares the same title as the panel series, Musil’s Intellectual Affinities. When we concocted the idea, we had hoped to hear from scholars who were working on previously unexplored connections between Musil and any intellectual predecessor, contemporary, or successor. The field of Musil studies has been receptive to such comparative approaches, be they on Kant, Husserl, or Luhmann. Our panel’s intent was to add new names and ideas to this ever expanding roster of intellectual peers or to revisit established connections in search of new insight. Our call for papers elicited a substantial response, which allowed us to curate three full panels spanning the entire conference weekend. It was encouraging to see that the←7 | 8→ strong general interest in our topic also came from a diverse international research community.\n\nThat being said, we should note that Musil scholarship in the United States and the support thereof is not as prolific vis-à-vis its European counterparts. This however is a product of circumstance rather than necessity. In Europe, traditional philology continues to inform literary scholarship to a much stronger degree than in the U.S., where approaches to the lives and works of literary figures often betray a strong ideological inflection. It follows then that Musil, who famously resisted ideological instrumentalization – and in his textual afterlife continues to do so – will find less traction in America. The materiality of the enterprise plays a role as well: thousand-plus-page texts are seldom read, taught, or written. The intellectual marketplace offers very little room for such activities at the moment. Despite these and other obstacles, we were delighted to demonstrate that market trends can be bucked and that there is indeed high, if unobtrusive demand for Musil in the U.S. The 2015 GSA featured as many panels dedicated to Musil as to graphic novels! Certainly, good work is being done in this field, but who would argue that it’s harder to sell comics than Musil products?\n\nWe would therefore like to thank every scholar who was interested enough to respond to our call for papers. We thank all of our presenters as well as the GSA for allowing us to hold three panels. We would like to thank all of the contributors to this volume for their patience, flexibility, and extra interest in nurturing this project to completion. Finally, we would also like to thank Longwood University for its generous support."
