        "text": "Overriding instinct is one of the foundations of Young Torless by Robert Musil, a novel about a young man who cannot overcome his Freudian nature simply through means of rationality. Since a young child, Torless had always been alone. He has been split between the two worlds of the rationale and the irrational always pulling him to his wits’ end. The opening of the narrative gives the reader a glimpse into what the novel is about: “the parallel railroad lines with their dingy traces” (3). The parallel railroad lines are both the rational side of instinct and the irrational side, each of them run in the same way, each of them never touch one another, and each of them are equal in their measures. Most importantly, these instincts are supplemental to one another.\n\nThe easiest focus on Torless’ struggle is related to the rationale as this takes up the primary motivation in the novel, and shows how much Torless is an enigma in comparison to his friends Reiting and Beineberg. As mentioned previously in my novel’s thoughts, I have surmised that this work or novel, is a critique of the fall of the Enlightenment period and drastically shifting into the age of Modernism. It is taking something that is speculative in nature, placing all hopes upon it and then watching it crash down all around you as the concrete, hard truths are growing through the cracks, creating a beckoning that is of irrisoric nature. This critique of the era is simply reflected in the mind of a young student who had only been raised in a Bourgeoise lifestyle, despite a life of loneliness and truths. Where a high class society lives a socialistic lifestyle, our hero tends to be one that is brooding and alone, creating a hard sympathy to the realistic values that can be found between individuals instead of viewing groups as a whole. Young Torless has a natural progression which highlights the railroad quote above, in that in every second guessing of the natural elements, there is a concrete proof in which Torless makes his decisions. Despite the novel being written in freely used indirect discourse, we constantly find ourselves either disgusted by Torless or enamored with the struggles that he is going through. Torless seeks a life where all answers are concrete, but he is incapable of that lifestyle due to the pressures of his friends and the natural instincts threatening to swallow him whole.\n\nAnd as if the story was coming from Kafka’s Metamorphosis, we are left with the shaping of human existence and instinct overcoming all thought and rationality, giving a glimpse into the murky world or other railroad, or the novel says it “Between events and himself, indeed between his own feelings and some inmost self that craved understanding of them, there always remained a dividing-line, which receded before his desire, like a horizon, the closer he tried to come to it[..]” (25). “The closer he tried to come to it” is a reference to the fact that he cannot grasp the rationality behind the actions of his friend’s torture of Basini, and the fact that his emotions are always at bay and no longer in arm’s reach.\n\nWriters seldom set out to write a novel that will become part of a movement. The thought isn’t “I think I’ll write a modernist novel,” although I’m sure authors are aware of where their content fits in. What’s more interesting then, is how a movement begins. Is it life imitating art, or otherwise? If the novel speaks to the human condition, then it makes sense that through different movements, we can say something about the time they were written in. The postmodern movement is such that it engages modern society, drawing from pop-culture, previous novels, and sometimes (if not often) alluding to the author’s predecessors. It is the hipster of the literary movement; it underscored the human condition outside of the grand narrative before it was cool, and it didn’t concern itself with meaning, but rather had no use for it; laughed in its face. Junot Diaz’s Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao solidifies its place in the postmodern canon through its vibrant use of magical realism, a prevalent force throughout the novel, while allowing its author to create a story exclusively his.\n\nThe magical curse of the Fuku is the driving force in Oscar Wao’s narrative. Before the narrative truly begins, there is a bit of a prologue in which our narrator aims to explain the fuku to his readers, as understanding it will be a necessary part of the story. Throughout the novel, readers see Oscar, Beli, Lola, and even Yunior deal with the Fuku, manifesting itself repeatedly as a faceless man. We see this happen before terrible acts are committed, beginning with Beli’s encounter with the faceless man on the way to the cane fields. Yunior tells us of Beli’s struggle as her two kidnappers drag her into their car: “Dejame, she screamed, and when she looked up she saw that there was one more cop sitting in the car, and when he turned toward her she saw that he didn’t have a face.” Diaz uses the mysterious faceless man to foreshadow events that are a result of the fuku placed on the family, and more broadly, on the Dominican people. In fact, we see the event repeat itself with Oscar decades later during his own abduction. Yunior tells us that like his mother, “Oscar was sure he was being beaten by three men, not two, that the faceless man from in front of the colmado was joining them.” (299) The faceless man becomes a repetition tool for Diaz’s novel, bringing the reader’s attention back to the meaning of the blank man and the curse. But no villain is complete without a worthy opponent, and so it is with the Mongoose.\n\nThe Yang to the fuku’s Yin is the mighty Mongoose, ever present as the De Leon family’s protector. After both Oscar and his mother’s beatings in their “family cane field,” the Mongoose enters to save them, but it is not left solely to the readers to recognize this: “To her dying day [La Inca] believed that Beli had met not a curse but God out in that canefield (152) Indeed, the Mongoose is godlike, exhibiting a regality through its “golden lion eyes and the absolute black of its pelt” (149) hardly Ricky Ticki. Later, just as the faceless man comes back to meet with Oscar, so too does the Mongoose come to Oscar offering him strength. As Oscar lay in bed, seemingly between life and death, the Mongoose comes to him: “Oscar remembers having a dream where a mongoose was chatting with him. Except the mongoose was the Mongoose.” (301) When reading that line, I can’t help but think of “him” vs. capital H.I.M; the Mongoose in all His goodness is again godlike. Yunior continues with the mongoose asking Oscar to make a choice: “What will it be muchacho? It demanded. More or less?” (301) The Mongoose is aware of the fuku, or that phrasing wouldn’t be necessary – it knows that Oscar will experience more pain if he stays alive. In a way, this serves as affirmation to the reader that the story does not end happily for Oscar. Indeed, his “more” is a repeat of the situation that got him there in the first place because, unlike his mother, he didn’t choose to stay away, but the fuku doesn’t give, it takes- giving is for the zafa.\n\nI really enjoyed the use of “blankness” in Oscar Wao, it really encapsulated how the Fuku works. The diaspora created a faceless people bound together by the unspeakable atrocities of a man who’s name was spoken only less than Lord Voldemort’s. The Zafa, in contrast is in Oscars choice on how to live, even when it meant choosing how to die. It was in Lola’s fire; brilliant and overpowering her mother’s dark shadow; in the Mongoose – its “absolute black” pelt making the skin color that so often brought shame to the De Leon’s both in Santo Doming and in the U.S, beautiful. The magic of the novel truly lies in this exploration of blankness, of blank people, because, really, it doesn’t matter if you can see them, they can see you.\n\nIn Tyrant Banderas, influence from context separate it from “traditional” Modernism movement and places it into the novel of the Mexican Revolution genre –considering Virginia Woolf and Joyce James the representatives of the British Modernist movement. Ramón Del Valle-Inclán writes, in the same way than authors like Mariano Azuela and Juan Rulfo a genre that is shaped by the events of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. However, the novel’s structure, narrative, sense of lost, fragmentation, and being continuously experimental resembles the elements that created the British Modernism movement. Therefore, Tyrant Banderas is a European modernist novel that narrates the events of the Mexican Revolution.\n\nThe Independence Wars of 1910 in Latin America that ended the Spaniard colonization –in most of today’s countries, did not solve social, political, and economic problems of the new formed countries. On the contrary, it gave birth to worst forms of tyranny that triggered, in the case of México the Revolution of 1910. Forms of slavery, exploitation, and cruelty against the, farmers, laborers, and indigenous people continued in the same way as in the colony time. In Tyrant Banderas, Del Valle-Inclán captures the physical sufferings and social discomfort of Latin America people; through the voice of a narrator, he exposes what perhaps is the summary of the novel and the essence of the revolutionary wars of Latin America, especially in México:\n\nThe Creolocracy retains all the privileges and protections of ancient colonial law. The liberators failed in destroy them. Our indigenous people suffer the slavery of indenture labor just as in the worst day of the viceroyalty. This America of ours has gained its independence from Spanish tutelage but not from Spanish prejudice. (44)\n\nDel Valle-Inclán exposes America Latina inherited Spanish prejudice –that perhaps prevails until today, with a treatment of European Modernism elements.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) crossed in time with World War I (1914-1918), and as the influence of World War I is present in modernist novels such as Mrs. Dalloway, the Mexican Revolution influence is present in Tyrant Banderas. Even that Del Valle-Inclán is a European author, he could no escape the reality imprinted by his visits to México, and the events of the Mexican Revolution influenced the fiction of his modernist novel. In addition, the geographical location is not only given by the revolutionary events in the novel, but by references such as “Those famous festivities on All Saints’ Day and the Day of the Dead!” (59). They are the festivities of a Mexican tradition that not only gives a sense of time in the novel (November first and second), but also places the novel in México by two reasons. First, All Saints’ Day and the Day of the Dead belong to a tradition that originated in México; therefore, unconsciously one attach those festivities in Mexican land. And second, the Mexican revolution started in November 20; November is the month suggested in the novel when the revolutionary acts happen. Again, the date in the fictional revolution in Tyrant Banderas is unconsciously connected to the date of a real event in México.\n\nThe revolutionary events and place, the suggested date, and the Mexican tradition are some of the elements that makes Tyrant Banderas to be positioned in Mexican Land. Moreover, the same novel’s elements make it falls into the novel of the Mexican Revolution genre, with a touch of European Modernist elements. After all, Del Valle-Inclán is a European author writing a Mexican reality.\n\nWork Cited\n\nDel Valle-Inclán, Ramón. Tyrant Banderas. Translated by Peter Bush, New York Review Books, 2012.\n\nBy the strictest definition, Literary Modernism began at the turn of the 19th century and gave way to Postmodernism after World War II. The problem with that definition is in its rigidity, as many of the philosophical and material issues that were present between 1900 and 1945 are still unresolved decades later. In fact, it could be argued that Postmodernism only addresses the compounding issues, and only differentiates between Modernism in terms of style. After all, Marx and Freud are just as relevant, albeit in different ways, today as they were to Modernist writers in the 20th century. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the definition of what Modernism is. In less strict terms, Modernism is a literary genre in which the reaction to social upheaval is expressed through individual experience. W.G. Sebald’s 2001 novel Austerlitz is an excellent text to test this hypothesis, as it grapples with the memory by breaking narrative conventions.\n\nAusterlitz focuses on the life Jacques Austerlitz, an art historian, and, as he discovers, a Jewish child refugee who escaped the Holocaust by being forced to flee from Prague to Britain. The narrative unfolds as Austerlitz rediscovers the memories of his early childhood. It should be noted that the narrative is presented through the recollection of the narrator, who, over the course of several decades, listened to Austerlitz’s struggles to uncover his past. Therefore, the text can be considered the narration of a narration, in which something that was recalled, is recalled once more. To further complicate the narrative, it should also be noted that the novel jumps back and forward through time as the narrator recalls his meetings with Austerlitz. The time that is spent with the narrator and Austerlitz is dedicated to the uncovering of Austerlitz’s past. Early in the narrative, the narrator sees Austerlitz in England for the first time in almost twenty years, their first encounter occurring in the 1960’s. The narrator tells the reader, “I…suddenly noticed a solitary figure on the edge of the agitated crowd, a figure who could only be Austerlitz, whom I realized at that moment I had not seen for nearly twenty years” (Sebald 39). Shortly after, Austerlitz confesses his lack of memory, as the narrator recalls, “Since my childhood and youth, [Austerlitz] finally began, I have never known who I really was” and begins to reveal what he can remember, his childhood in Wales (Sebald 44). This pattern of the narrator recalling Austerlitz’s recollections is the mode of operation for the rest of the novel, and the implications of such a style give meaning to the text.\n\nThis double-layered novel of recollection raises important questions. Is the reader experiencing Austerlitz’s reaction to the trauma of the Holocaust? Or is the reader experiencing the recollections of the narrator who is also making sense of Austerlitz’s narrative. The novel is structured in such a way that Austerlitz’s bewilderment with his own life is shared vicariously with the reader through the recollection of the narrator, Austerlitz is a Modernist text in that it focuses on an individual’s reaction to upheaval, and breaks with literary tradition by creating a bewildering narrative that forgoes linearity.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nSebald, W. G. Austerlitz. New York: Modern Library, 2011. Print.\n\nIn the simplest terms, Modernism is a literary movement that developed at the end of the 19th century, and gave way to Postmodernism after World War II. Modernism is defined in the Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature, as a literary movement from 1901 to 1939 (Dettmar 1). To understand Modernism as a literary movement, one must consider the material conditions that brought it into existence. Modernism drew influence from a variety of developments of 19th century philosophy, and social science. Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche all cast doubts on the idea that the individual, as a result of ideology, the unconscious mind, and the limits of traditional ethics, was his own master (Dettmar 3; “Modernism” 385). To complicate the definition of Modernism further, the Twentieth-Century Literary Movements Dictionary claims that Modernist authors addressed “the increasingly complex and disillusioning realities of twentieth-century life…with the intent of radically refashioning them so as to concretize their self-conscious separation, even alienation from the writers and beliefs of the past” (“Modernism” 382). Unfortunately, the alienating, disillusioning aspects of modern life have not subsided, and, as the world becomes more interconnected, these issues have become global. Therefore, Modernism may be considered as a global phenomenon – a constant literary undertaking in which the struggle between the individual, their unconscious mind, and their material conditions, is given some meaning. What follows is a discussion of Literary Modernism in various national traditions.\n\nIn the British context, Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, published in 1902, is “one of the most studied works of modern fiction” (“Modernism” 383). Heart of Darkness deals directly with the tensions between the individual, and the ideology of colonialism, and does so through a “consciously ambiguous method of narration” (“Modernism” 383). Thus, Conrad, while grappling with tensions of modernity, is also facilitating the separation from writing conventions of the past. Virginia Woolf, author of Mrs Dalloway can also be credited with contributing the split from the narrative practices of the past. In 1919, she defended the stream-of-consciousness technique, claiming, “…The mind receives a myriad impressions – trivial, fantastic evanescent, or engraved with the sharpness of steel. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms…Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall…” (Dettmar 6-7). Stream of consciousness was a style often utilized in Modernist literature, and Woolf’s quote shows the relationship between the style, and the movement’s psychological roots in the works of Freud. James Joyce, despite being Irish, is also a titan of British Modernism, and his novels Ulysses utilizes stream of consciousness while playing with the tradition of myth (“Modernism 386). The fact that James Joyce is often appropriated into the British tradition of literature complicates the subgenre, and raises questions about the canon of British Literature.\n\nThe Modernism movement in Latin America was characterized by the cultural “emancipation” from the Spanish Empire and the search of a new identity. With the exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico, Latin America was no longer Spanish colonies; therefore, the newly formed countries began to raise their voice and demand unification. Born in Nicaragua, Rubén Dario (Félix Rubén García Sarmiento) is considered the “father of Modernism.” One of his most prominent works of literature is Azul… which is also considered the first book of Modernism in the Spanish language. Azul… is a collection composed of prose and poems. Published for the first time in 1888 in Valparaiso, Chile and two years later as a revised edition in Guatemala. However, the list of modernist authors is extensive; one has to keep in mind that Latin America is integrated by a great cultural diversity that is unique in each country. Perhaps the only factors that unified them is the Spanish language, and Catholicism. Consequently, this list reflects only a Mexican identity rather than a representation of the modernism movement in the Spanish language. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) characterized many modernist novels of authors such as: Mariano Azuela (Mariano Azuela González), Los de Abajo (1915, The Underdogs); Juan Rulfo (Juan Nepomucemo Carlos Pérez Rulfo Vizcaíno), Pedro Páramo (1955, Pedro Paramo) and El Llano en Llamas (1953, The Burning Plain); and the Spaniard author, Ramón Del Valle-Inclán (Ramón María del Valle-Inclán y de la Peña), Tirano Banderas (1926, Tyrant Banderas).\n\nFrench Modernism seems to have developed from Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, specifically the free indirect discourse that seemed to grow into the modern stream of consciousness form of writing. According to a Yale research page on modernism, Flaubert’s methods were used to create a ambiguity and irony which “appealed strongly to the modernists, who were to make ambiguity and irony central to their literary work” (Lewis). In this way, Flaubert was a sort of proto-modernist. One of the more important early French modernist writers is Marcel Proust. His novel, Remembrance of Things Past, represents the experimental side of modernism by having a lot of points in the novel where time does not seem to make sense. Regaining forgotten memory is another major part of the plot. According to the Yale research page on modernism, Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past “is the only modernist novel that has a fair claim to being as important in the history of the genre as James Joyce” (Lewis). Louis Aragon is a special case, for he belongs more to the surrealists than anything else. His work, Paris Peasant appears to be written with the idea that the old ways of Paris is about to wiped out by modernization. It is an experimental and archaeological novel that is said to break all the rules of novel writing (Colby, 160). And finally, Louis Ferdinand Celine’s Journey to the End of Night, which critiques and examines modern life, while using stream of consciousness and terrifying depictions of life after a war (Self).\n\nAmerican modernism came about during the early 20th century as reaction to societal and cultural changes and as rejection of enlightenment ideals. This movement sought to capture reality in the newly industrial world. They sought to highlight the loss of individuality caused by modern life and the feelings of isolation, alienation, and separation from society that arose from the dissolution of old social structures. John dos Passos’ Manhattan Transfer exemplifies these modern sentiments. Passos weaves a tale that follows many peoples live in 1925 New York. He tries to capture the feeling and the speed of modern life in the city by showing its effects on his characters. Other modernist writers attempt to do the same, trying to capture the feeling that surrounded modern life at the time. Writers like T.S. Elliot, Ezra Pound, and other expatriates of the Lost Generation all tried to capture the feeling of modern life after the first World War. Other modernists tried a type of nativism to try and capture American life in reaction to the Lost Generation writers. Modernists like John Steinbeck tried to capture the feeling of life during the Great Depression. The list of influential American modernists could go on forever but the main thing that ties them all together was their attempts to capture the raw emotion and feeling of the time and place they are writing about.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nColby, Sasha. “Urban Archaeologies of the French Surrealists” Stratified Modernism: The Poetics of Excavation from Gautier to Olson.

The novel deals with memory, our access to it, and how our understanding of it in relation to the past effects our self-expression in the present.\n\nThis first-person narrative reflects the inner turmoil of a person who has lost their homeland, their connection to the past and is attempting to regain it by assimilating her memories into the present. The novel begins unconventionally with a photograph, the single photograph of the text, and having the reader enter the disjointed narrative through that visual cue. This postmodernist technique of mixing media and interweaving photographs into the narrative breaks from traditional literary conventions of a linear narrative, and forces the reader to confront the fact that what they are reading is a narrative construct by the novel’s drawing attention to that fact. Ugresic uses not only photographs, but also collages of smaller stories, vignettes, and interspersed quotations throughout her novel to further prevent an easy, linear reading of the narrative by providing these disjointed narrative distractions in the form of fragments. And that is exactly the author’s intention, to mirror this reading experience with the exile’s frustratingly fragmented attempt of trying to access memories through photos, collages, and other types of material media and somehow tie these separate threads from the past into a cohesive whole in the present. It is a project of tracing your roots when you have been uprooted.\n\nThe novel also examines the nature of these memories themselves, and how they function as signals for the past. As we begin the novel, we’re given a description of a display case enclosing a taxidermized Walrus and the objects that have been preserved in its stomach over the years. The observers try to make sense of the random objects that the Walrus ate it its final days. The material objects have outlived the essence of the animal, and it is through them that we try to gauge some meaning and understanding of the animal while it was alive. This morbid episode sets the tone for the remainder of the novel, as photographs, albums, movies, cards and other unrelated objects come to constitute a possession of the past, or standing in as a memory of the past itself. We have no access to the past, but can only try to re-construct and re-assemble through our memories a disjointed re-telling of it. The other various exiles that feature in the novel are divided into two groups, those that possess photographs and those that do not; or those with a tie to the past and those without.\n\nThis disjointed archive of experiences showcases, much like a museum, the inherent difficulty in trying to create a present, cohesive identity based on fragmented shards of memories rooted in the past. It is akin to building a castle in the sand; the structure is built on millions of grains which slip though the fingers as the castle struggles to stand erect. At the end of her journey mapping her identity, Ugresic’s closes with a German heading translating into, “Where am I?’ still displaced and trying to express her metanarrative with the collapse of the story she has known most her life, the disintegration of Yugoslavia and her home.\n\nFranco-Czech writer Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being represents a quite experimental Modernist take on Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia. It is the story of a man, his most common mistress, and ultimately, his love and their struggles. The Soviet control over the country acts as a backdrop in most cases to the actual plot, but at times it creeps into the story of the main characters. It exists as a modernist novel because of its social commentary and style. In the novel, Kundera seems to disregard the concept of linear time, with some chapters taking place sometime before the previous chapter without warning. Another thing Kundera does is take time out of the story to explain or examine what happens in the current chapter or the previous chapter. An example of this can be found in the second part, Soul and Body, where Kundera goes into detail about Tereza’s backstory right after speaking mostly about Tomas. Yet, that is not all he does, for this section becomes all about Tereza, even switching from Tomas’ perspective to Tereza’s. Everything that had happened to Tomas with Tomas’ point of view, now shifted to her. This is not the only time he does this, for Sabine, Franz, and, in a way, even the dog Karenin get chapters or pages devoted to their perspective of specific events. This is also a usual characteristic of modernist literature; multiple perspectives being told in abnormal ways. Kundera also takes time to philosophize, sort of, about the nature of certain things people believe to be accurate. In some cases, he tears through the story to personally say what the characters truly want as opposed to what they say they want. Such an example exists at the beginning of the story, where he spends a little while speaking of Nietzsche, the French Revolution, and Christianity, among other things. As evidenced by the prologue, Kundera tends to talk about historical events relatively frequently, most of the time at least once a “Part”. The parts of the novel are used to identify the character whose point of view on which the majority of the section will focus. Instead of going from one part of the plot to the other, Kundera effectively creates a web of a story, with characters, plot lines, and even some details that seem insignificant popping up later with actual importance. Sabina’s bowler hat and paintings frequently pop up, and gain more and more importance as the story unfolds. Lightness of Being describes realistic scenarios, but also focuses on examining dreams to explain or predict what happens in the story. In some instances, the opposite occurs and the reality explains the dreams. In a way, Kundera appears to be using fantastical, horrific elements to help people understand real issues. This all exists as an example of Kundera’s experimental writing style. The Unbearable Lightness of Being also exists as an example of the stream of consciousness writing style that many modernists use. Kundera’s modernist work existing in a post-modernist era proves that modernism is not just a specific era in time written in a history book, but an era that happens in different places at different times.\n\nWorks Consulted/Cited\n\nKundera, Milan.

Harper Perennial Modern Classics.\n\nPostmodernism is a literary movement that came to dominate the majority of the latter 21 century. The term didn’t enter popular lexicon until Jean-Francois Lyotard’s usage of it in 1979 to describe what he calls The Postmodern Condition, and it remains difficult to properly define postmodernism it its entirety. However it can best be explained as an attempt to destabilize and deconstruct concepts of identity, historical progress, and the universality of truth and meaning with a linguistic and structural playfulness and irony.\n\nIn The Postmodern Condition, Lyotard notes that postmodernity is characterized by the “loss of meaning,” yet postmodernist do not lament this loss, of narrative coherence or the loss of being, and instead seek to confront the resulting plurality that results from the dissolution of boundaries. These boundaries are boundaries between the internal body and the external environment, nature and technology, high and low culture, and between reality and representation. Postmodern literature questions and breaks down these traditional constructs through its highly experimental nature, utilizing parody, irony, fragmentation, ambiguity, extreme self-reflexivity, and questioning of grand narratives.\n\nStarting with the personal and working outwards, Julia Kristeva explores the most intimate dissolution of boundaries in the Powers of Horror, in which she discusses the threatened breakdown of meaning caused by the transgressions of the subject and object, or the absence of division between the self and other. Kristeva uses the term “abject” to describe this feeling when an individual is confronted with this breakdown of distinctions. An example would be a corpse, that which is “me but not me.” Other examples are wounds or any body fluids, things that trespass from the inside of the physical body into the outside, an abject reminder of our mortality and a frightening dissolution of barriers between ourselves and the deceased, the objects.\n\nIn A Cyborg Manifesto, Donna Haraway rejects the traditional boundaries separating “human” from “animal” and “human” from “machine.” Haraway’s cyborg is a synthesized creature who exists in the absence of the existing dichotomies, instead a fusion of them. The cyborg defies distinctions in three ways: between the human and animal, man and machine, and the physical and non-physical. The resulting chimera is a fusion of two separate spheres, a postmodernist construct only made possible due to contemporary technology.\n\nMoving away from the personal, postmodernity examines the basis of distinctions between what is reality and how we represent it. This is especially important to postmodern art and literature, and our understanding of history. Postmodernist break down the established narrative and temporal linearity, inducing a non-linear and fragmented understanding of the passage of time and temporal distortion. Linda Hutcheon features temporal distortion in her work on historiographical metaficition. The term rejects the projection of present beliefs onto the past, and suggests a separation between “facts” and “events” as understood by historians. History and fiction, according to postmodernist dogma, are both linguistic constructs, equally intertextual and based more on verisimilitude than objective truth. Hutcheon argues for the erasure of the line separating history and literature, between fact and fiction and opening the grand narrative to scrutiny by introducing a plurality of narratives and “truths.” Historiographic metafiction uses parody, anachronisms, and irony to challenge traditional renditions of historical literature, in line with postmodernism’s penchant for playfulness.\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood is a work of postmodern literature. A work of speculative fiction, the author employs a sort of “what if” scenario to the hyper conservative attitudes towards reproduction, thus creating a narrator who has been stripped of her identity in order to be nothing but a vessel for carrying children to term. There is also a fragmentation throughout the novel due to the way it is presented, via present events as they occur to the narrator, and past memories that led her to this new reality. It is represented best through the sometimes confusing shifts in narration and how the narrator seems to be trying and failing to cope with the trauma of being under a new regime. Overall the novel evokes a bleak future but ends on a more positive note, leaving hope in the epilogue and beyond. These themes are common in postmodernism as authors try to change and reshape their own realities by writing reflections of current events and using speculative fiction to explore not only those “what-if’s” but deeper themes of identity.\n\nIn Junot Diaz’s The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, identity politics and the postmodern condition are the central subject of Diaz’s subjects. Diaz shifts his narrative though out time and space, travelling from contemporary New Jersey to 21st century Dominican Republic and erroding the barriers from what is considered reality to what is fantasy through the use of fantastical elements placing the novel in the magical realism realm. The titular Oscar de Leon uses code switching, a linguistic tool that fuses the two dominant languages and cultures in his life and also expresses his state of alienation due to not fitting in with the grand narrative as has been prescribed to him.\n\nPaul Beatty’s The Sellout establishes a cultural milieu that is pseudo-urban in that it is a rural community situated in the midst of Los Angeles towns—like Compton, for one. Though this backdrop is agrarian in contemporary space and time, it is also familiar to many Blacks by way of experience. Dickens, the story’s not-so fictional town is predominantly Black, threatened by dissipation, and stagnant growth and development. This postmodern parody of the contemporary condition of many communtites existing today impacts the protagonist in a number of ways. He is a farmer who travels by horse. His father is a Black nationalist who imparts Black power values in his son. He attempts to cure his small town of gentrification by defining, outlining, and segregating it from its surrounding—literally– by replacing removed signage that once labeled Dickens, and by drawing a contiguous line around the town which eventually psychologizes the community to “abide by” the boundary. They actually police themselves. Historical elements are present. The town of Dickens draws from Richland Farms, an actual farming community in Los Angeles affected by gentrification. Segregation was and is a reality of Black disenfranchise within the United States. As well, the argument that oppressed Blacks are complacent in their upward mobility is a standing one.\n\nDubravka Ugresic’s The Museum of Unconditional Surrender is a postmodernist exploration of a young woman’s struggle to place her identity within the present based on her imperfect recollection of past memories, making for a scattered and fragmented experience. Hailing from the former Yugoslavia, the novel is told as an exploration of photographs and other forms of media, breaking down the distinction between mediums and having the effect of interrupting a linear reading of the novel.\n\nThe novel Persepolis is a biography and Bildungsroman graphic novel about Marjane who grows up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran. The story takes place during her childhood and story ends during her early adulthood. Persepolis fits in the Bildungsroman because of the graphic and length descriptions of her childhood and early adulthood in Iran and as she is traveling to other countries. Marjane shares her experience about the Islamic Revolution and how she had a terrible childhood of horrible religious groups, forcing of the Veil, and harsh laws against women and men. She also talks about how she experienced different cultures and how she was treated because of her race. Persepolis is an example of how women were restricted of certain personal items and could not wear anything fashionable. Women were given strict clothing to wear and had to cover their whole body because their body was a distraction to the men. The Veil seemed to play an important role in graphic novel as well since the chapter title is seen many times in the novel. But the novel also explores how Marjane’s family struggled to have a good life and constantly had to hide their belongs that were considered personal or fun before authorities came into their home. They also lost family members or relatives along the way during the constant battle along in Iran.\n\nThere were also themes of social class in the novel as well. It points out that citizens have to marry within their same class and cannot marry someone else of a different class. Persepolis continues to set an example of a Bildungsroman novel because while it doesn’t give us her entire life story, it shows parts of historical contexts from history and religion. Even the graphic novel points out how the authorities abuse their religion as a way to put harsh punishments on the citizens by, for example, placing execution laws, torture in prisons, and even killing victims and calling themselves the “deliverers of justice”. The novel shows how freedom can be take advantage of by different countries and how abusive their power can be. But we can also see in the graphic novel on how social activism is very active when they are fighting against injustice. Families have to send their children off somewhere safer away from Iran in order to provide them with a better life away from war. The beginning of the novel starts in 1980 after the Islamic Revolution but there is still violence that goes on in Iran afterwards. The graphic novel also shows the means of having sacrifices in life and how giving up freedom is hard."
