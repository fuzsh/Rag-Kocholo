Excellent condition for its 90+ years!\n\nVintage Chan paper remains very popular among collectors and Chan buffs. However, early paper like this from the early 30s with Warner Oland is Extremely scarce and RARELY ever appears on the market. Posters with the Warner Oland (original and first Charlie Chan) are highly sought after.\n\n* Imagine how Gorgeous this would look vintage framed and displayed on your favorite wall?\n\n* See enlargeable images above and below\n\nNOTE: We acquired three Very RARE photos for this Lost 1932 Chan film, along with other Rare movie advertising paper for early 1930s Chan films. . See the others below under, \"Other Vintage Treasures You Might Like\"\n\nCharlie Chan's Chance (Fox, 1932). Vintage Photo Still (8\" X 10\").\n\nWarner Oland's third excursion as the Chinese detective, this early talkie features a plot in which Chan himself was the intended victim of a murder, but escaped, while another man was killed. He has to fend off the inquiries of both Scotland Yard and the New York police while he tracks down the killer. Unique in the series as being the only Chan film to have the involvement of creator Earl Derr Biggers (credited with \"added suggestions\"), this is a lost film, much to the chagrin of many Chan enthusiasts. What's not lost is this original fantastic Stunning Sepia promotional photo still with a terrific image of Oland and his co-stars\n\nStarring Warner Oland, Alexander Kirkland, Ralph Morgan, H.B. Warner, Marian Nixon, Linda Watkins, James Kirkwood, James Todd, and Charles McNaughton. Directed by John G. Blystone. .\n\nNote: Cvtreasures stamp Not on original"
