        "text": "About Hedgehog's Whimsey Books New Hampshire, United States\n\nBiblio member since 2017\n\nHedgehog's Whimsey Books was born in a random moment when I decided to become a used books seller. Beginning in 2001, I apprenticed myself with a longtime pro in the next town, hoping to learn her secrets. She encouraged my free help but was wary of sharing all those secrets. Nonetheless, she turned me loose when she felt I would not embarrass her; she was impressed, finding I actually knew something about books and authors and styles.\n\nI am still learning, and I am having a good time with the random avalanches of books to be recycled into good homes, one by one. Inventory has mounted: my mother downsized her 7,000-plus library, and we (my Geezer and I) went to library book sales, yard emporiums on weekends, estate dispersals, and added the books my kids left behind, wanting to stock their own shelves anew. Some folks simply tooled down our dirt road and left boxes on our porch.\n\nMyself? Well, I am also a photographer, journalist, curious stuff collector, avid reader, writer, editor, small-time publisher, and online pontificator. At Hedgehog Enterprises, I do \"Words & Pictures by & for Folks with Prickly Backs, Soft Bellies, & Small Brains\", established in 1991. Since I have the smallest brain (by unpopular vote), I am the Head Hedgehog.\n\nDo I specialize in particular genres? I thought I did, but my barn has lots of Geezer-built shelves, and we have many interests, so topics vary, as do book conditions and editions. I try to describe such, and sometimes have too much fun as I poke along. There is no charge for the therapy of browsing, folks, so find my sites and stay awhile. If a purchase results, know that the tax collector in Newport, New Hampshire, may get a pleasant surprise. Or, I may buy a few more apple cider donuts or sweet potatoes. No pressure. Hedgehogs do have yearnings.\n\nIf you should visit by chance or by appointment, enjoy our old New Hampshire farmhouse location alongside the Sugar River and its companion recreation Rail Trail, nearby two historic railroad covered bridges just off Chandlers Mill Road. Feel welcome. -- Lucy G Wells, proprietor.\n\nTerms of Sale:\n\n30 day return guarantee, with full refund including original shipping costs for up to 30 days after delivery if an item arrives misdescribed or damaged.
