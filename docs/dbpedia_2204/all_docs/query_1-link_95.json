        "text": "SINGAPORE - An animated film adaptation of Sonny Liew's graphic novel The Art Of Charlie Chan Hock Chye is a step closer to the screen after its producers recently won a chance to pitch it at a major French animation festival.\n\nThe adaptation was one of six South-east Asian projects pitched at the Animation Du Monde workshop in Manila in February. On Feb 22, it won the opportunity to move on to the Annecy International Animation Film Market in June.\n\nFilm-maker Jerrold Chong, 27, who has been working on the adaptation for a year, said this would give the team the chance to pitch to hundreds of film distributors, production companies and other potential investors.\n\nThe project's producer, Mr Fran Borgia, 38, said: \"It's indeed great to have received such an award. It does make things a little easier for us now as the project has gotten the right exposure.\n\n\"We are still in the midst of securing the right writers and director to join us on this adventure. We are aiming to go into production only in 2021 as we need at least two years to develop the right project and get the proper financing and support.\"\n\nThe Annecy festival began in 1960 and is held annually in Annecy, a town in the south-east of France. Animation Du Monde is a series of pitch sessions it started in 2015 to open doors for emerging animators from around the world."
