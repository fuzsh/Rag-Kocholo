        "text": "A Collection of Charlie Chan Books and Related Material\n\nWelcome, dear visitor, to our Library. Here, you will find information on the many and varied books that relate to renowned detective Charlie Chan.\n\nCharlie Chan made his first appearance in print in the January 24, 1925 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. In this magazine, the first installment of The House Without a Key by Earl Derr Biggers ran for a month. Soon thereafter, this adventure was offered in book form, which began the appearance of numerous books over the decades that continue to this day.\n\nWhat follows is a humbly offered collection, in a chronological format, of most of the books that have been published containing either stories or material directly related to Charlie Chan. As well, some other books that have another, less direct connection, will be added.\n\nWe begin with the six original tomes by Earl Derr Biggers that contain Charlie Chan’s original adventures. These stories have been re-published by numerous companies over the years not just in the United States but have also been printed in other countries around the world, including, but not limited to, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the land of Charlie Chan’s ancestors…China…up to the present day!\n\nThe House Without a Key\n\nEarl Derr Biggers\n\nOriginally published by The Bobbs-Merrill Company (hardcover, 1925)\n\nIn this first adventure, penned by Earl Derr Biggers, Charlie Chan solves a mystery involving a murder that occurs in his own Honolulu. This story’s popularity led to its being adapted to a 10-episode film serial, The House Without A Key (1926), starring George Kuwa as Chan. In 1933, Charlie Chan’s Greatest Case, starring Warner Oland, sprang from the pages of this book.\n\nThe Chinese Parrot\n\nEarl Derr Biggers\n\nOriginally published by The Bobbs-Merrill Company (hardcover, 1926)\n\nEarl Derr Biggers’ second Charlie Chan novel took the detective to the California desert where he uncovers the reason for the mysterious disappearance of a millionaire. As was true of the first Charlie Chan mystery, this story led to another film, The Chinese Parrot (1927), which featured George Kuwa as the detective. In 1934, Warner Oland starred in Charlie Chan’s Courage, which was adapted from his book.\n\nBehind That Curtain\n\nEarl Derr Biggers\n\nOriginally published by The Bobbs-Merrill Company (hardcover, 1926)\n\nBiggers’ third book in the Charlie Chan series involves the detective in a case that spans decades and continents, culminating in the city of San Francisco. This novel provided the basis for the first “Charlie Chan” film to come out of Fox Film studios, Behind That Curtain (1929), a “talkie” featuring E.L. Park, whose Chan appeared onscreen for but a few minutes toward the end of the movie. This Biggers story was later the inspiration for two other Charlie Chan movies, Charlie Chan’s Chance (1932) and Murder Over New York (1940).\n\nThe Black Camel\n\nEarl Derr Biggers\n\nOriginally published by The Bobbs-Merrill Company (hardcover, 1929)\n\nThe death of Hollywood actress Shelah Fane in her Waikiki beach house brings Charlie Chan of the Honolulu police to seek the identity of the killer. This was the fourth of Earl Derr Biggers’ books in the Charlie Chan series. The film of the same name, produced by Fox Films in 1931, starred Warner Oland as Charlie Chan.\n\nCharlie Chan Carries On\n\nEarl Derr Biggers\n\nOriginally published by The Bobbs-Merrill Company (hardcover, 1930)\n\nThe fifth of the Earl Derr Biggers Charlie Chan books involves the Honolulu detective in a case of murder that stretches around the world, as members of a tour group are dying, one by one. Chan carries on for a fallen colleague as the tour reaches Honolulu. The Fox film Charlie Chan Carries On, the first movie in the Chan series, proper, starred Warner Oland as Charlie Chan.\n\nKeeper of the Keys\n\nEarl Derr Biggers\n\nOriginally published by The Bobbs-Merrill Company (hardcover, 1932)\n\nKeeper of the Keys was the final book written by Earl Derr Biggers before his passing a year later. In this last written adventure, Charlie Chan travels to Lake Tahoe in California, soon becoming embroiled in a case of murder there. No film was ever based on this book, while brief elements may be detected in Charlie Chan in Reno (1939).\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThe Charlie Chan Omnibus\n\nEarl Derr Biggers\n\nGrosset & Dunlap Publishers (hardcover, 1932)\n\nThis collection includes The House Without a Key, Behind That Curtain, and Keeper of the Keys.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nBetween 1939 and 1942, a series of three “Better Little Books” featuring the adventures of Charlie Chan. These tales were adapted from the Chan newspaper comic strips that were produced by noted cartoonist Alfred Andriola. Measuring 3 5/8 by 4 1/2 inches, each book contained a complete story with alternating pages of imagery and corresponding text. These Chan adventures were also issued in a Spanish language version.\n\nInspector Charlie Chan of the Honolulu Police\n\nDrawn by Earl Alfred Andriola\n\nThe Whitman Publishing Company (hardcover, 1939)\n\nIn London, Charlie Chan seeks to locate a kidnapped scientist who has developed a formula for “Dark Light,” something that would allow spies from other countries to photograph anything through an invisible screen.\n\nInspector Charlie Chan Solves a New Mystery\n\nDrawn by Alfred Andriola\n\nThe Whitman Publishing Company (hardcover, 1942)\n\nCharlie Chan solves a mystery aboard a “banana boat” freighter at sea.\n\nVillainy on the High Seas\n\nDrawn by Alfred Andriola\n\nThe Whitman Publishing Company (hardcover, 1942)\n\nWhat begins as a fishing expedition aboard a Navy Admiral’s yacht becomes a voyage fraught with danger and international espionage for Charlie Chan and his companions.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nQuotations From Charlie Chan\n\nCompiled and Edited by Harvey Chertok and Martha Torge\n\nCrown Press (softcover, 1968)\n\nThis book features a compilation of indexed aphorisms as collected from the 21 Charlie Chan films from Twentieth Century-Fox that were featured at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City from March 4-17, 1968. Interestingly, a few sayings from the “lost” Charlie Chan movies appear as well.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan Returns\n\nDennis Lynds\n\nBantam Books (softcover, 1974)\n\nIn 1974, Bantam Books released a full set of the six Charlie Chan novels written by Earl Derr Biggers. A seventh book, containing a new, original story penned by Dennis Lynds, was added to the set.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nIn 1976, two volumes of Charlie Chan comic reprints were issued through a collaboration between American and European comic art collectors. Both volumes featured Chan comics by noted artist Alfred Andriola which ran in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada between 1938 and 1942. Evidently, a total of five such volumes were planned, but the final three were never issued in the same format or quality. A “Volume 3” (of lesser production quality) was later released by Pacific Comics Club and is described below.\n\nCharlie Chan’s Adventures (Volume Primo)\n\nComics Stars in the World (hardcover, 1976)\n\nContained in this well-produced volume are the daily strips for the Charlie Chan newspaper comics by Alfred Andriola. Included are “dailies” that originally appeared between October 24, 1938 and November 18, 1939.\n\nCharlie Chan’s Adventures (Volume Secondo)\n\nComics Stars in the World (hardcover, 1976)\n\nIn this volume, also well-produced, are the Sunday strips for the Charlie Chan newspaper comics by Alfred Andriola. Included are three-color reproductions of the strips that originally appeared between October 30, 1938 and March 17, 1940. Also offered are daily strips (presented in three-color format) that ran from November 20, 1939 to March 20, 1940.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen\n\nMichael Avallone\n\nPinnacle Books (softcover, 1981)\n\n“They call her the Dragon Queen, a woman of impenetrable mystery and unknown powers. Then someone makes the fatal mistake of putting her in jail for murder. Years later, San Francisco is paralyzed by a wave of the most bizarre killings ever documented, each more unspeakable than the last, each devoid of clues, at least to Western eyes. There is only one man who stands a chance of outsmarting the killer – Charlie Chan.”\n\nThis book contains a story that was an adaptation of the Charlie Chan comedy-mystery feature movie, Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan: Five Complete Novels\n\nAvenel Books (hardcover, 1989)\n\nContained within this handsomely produced volume are five of the six Charlie Chan adventures by Earl Derr Biggers. Included are The House Without a Key, The Chinese Parrot, Behind That Curtain, The Black Camel, and Keeper of the Keys.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan at the Movies: History, Filmography, and Criticism\n\nKen Hanke\n\nMcFarland & Company, Inc. Publishers (hardcover, 1989; softcover, 2004)\n\nIn his extensive study of Charlie Chan films, the first such compilation of research focusing specifically on Charlie Chan and Charlie Chan movies, Ken Hanke offers detailed information on the films as well as their place in history. In gathering information for his book, Mr. Hanke interviewed Keye Luke, who appeared on-screen as Chan’s Number One Son, Lee. Mr. Luke’s insights are interspersed throughout the book, offering an interesting perspective.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nA Guide to Charlie Chan Films\n\nCharles P. Mitchell\n\nGreenwood Press (hardcover, 1999)\n\nTen years after the release of Ken Hanke’s compendium of Charlie Chan films and related information, Charlies Mitchell offered a book that, though similar in genre, offered new insights into both Charlie Chan and the films featuring the globe-trotting detective. Not only are the movies from the series proper presented, but many other Chan pictures, including foreign-made films. Throughout the book, Mr. Mitchell describes as well as rates the movies. Also, the aphorisms stated by Charlie Chan are included.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThe Charlie Chan Film Encyclopedia\n\nHoward M. Berlin\n\nMcFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers (hardcover, 2000; softcover, 2005)\n\nThis was a highly anticipated book by Dr. Howard Berlin. When it became available, fans of Charlie Chan were treated to a collection of information on the detective and his movies that remains unsurpassed. Everything from A to Z, from the widely known to the trivial, is contained within the covers of this fascinating and most informative volume.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nA Charlie Chan Omnibus\n\nWordsworth Editions (softcover, April 1996)\n\nThis collection of the first three Charlie Chan adventures by Earl Derr Biggers included The House Without a Key, The Chinese Parrot, and Behind That Curtain.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan’s Words of Wisdom\n\nHoward M. Berlin\n\nWildside Press (softcover, June 2001)\n\n“A collection of 600 proverbs spoken by the cinema’s favorite Oriental detective.” Dr. Berlin organized Charlie Chan’s aphorisms by film, including a cast list for each of the movies. After each saying is a note indicating the context of the proverb, noting the individual to whom the statement was directed.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThe following two books each contain a selection from the four “Charlie Chan” stories that appeared in the short-lived Charlie Chan Mystery Magazine, four issues of which appeared between November 1973 and August 1974. These stories featured an “updated,” anachronistic Charlie Chan who solved crimes in the 1970s. The Temple of the Golden Horde (from the May 1974 issue) and The Pawns of Death (from the August 1974 issue) were penned by Bill Pronzini and Jeffrey M. Wallmann who wrote under the pseudonym of Robert Hart Davis.\n\nCharlie Chan in The Temple of the Golden Horde\n\nBill Pronzini and Jeffrey M. Wallmann writing as Robert Hart Davis\n\nBorgo Press (hardcover, 2002; softcover, 2003)\n\n“Alive, he had been an innocent courier. Dead, he plunged Charlie Chan into perhaps the deadliest game of murder in his distinguished career as he sought the terrible secret of – The Temple of the Golden Horde.”\n\nCharlie Chan in The Pawns of Death\n\nBill Pronzini and Jeffrey M. Wallmann writing as Robert Hart Davis\n\nBorgo Press (hardcover, 2002; softcover, 2003)\n\n“Not one, but two murders committed in two locked rooms of the luxurious Hotel Frontenac in Paris! It challenged all of Charlie Chan’s ingenuity. He sought to unravel the tangle of calumny, hate and twisted ambitions, with his only clue the whispered word from the halting lips of a dying reporter.”\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan: The Untold Story of the Honorable Detective and His Rendezvous with American History\n\nYunte Huang\n\nW.W. Norton and Company (hardcover, August 2010)\n\nIn this book, Yunte Huang has traced Charlie Chan’s evolution from island legend, detective Chang Apana, to cultural icon to vilified, postmodern symbol, ingeniously juxtaposing Apana’s rough-and-tumble career against the larger backdrop of a territorial Hawaii.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThe Charlie Chan Mystery Movie Guide\n\nLuke Freeman\n\nParasolo (softcover, July 16, 2014)\n\nThe Charlie Chan Mystery Movie Guide features a detailed commentary, analysis, and review on each of the Charlie Chan films produced by Twentieth Century-Fox, including character studies and a detailed exploration of the themes and philosophies prevalent through the series as well as cast lists and plot synopses. The author also offers new take on the age-old Oland vs. Toler debate.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan Movie Poster Book\n\nGreg LenburgCreate\n\nSpace Publishing (softcover, February 27, 2015)\n\nThe Charlie Chan Movie Poster Book presents posters and poster art from Charlie Chan films from 1931-1949 featuring Warner Oland, Sidney Toler, and Roland Winters. Also included is the mystery/spoof Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen (1981) starring Peter Ustinov.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan’s Poppa: Earl Der Biggers\n\nBarbara Gregorich\n\nOhio History Connection (softcover, February 2, 2018)\n\nAs a sixteen-year-old, Barbara Gregorich discovered the Charlie Chan novels of Earl Derr Biggers on the “local authors” shelf of the Warren, Ohio Public Library. She fell in love with the wisdom, humor, and perceptiveness of the amiable Chinese-Hawaiian police detective, and she admired the author who created him. Wanting to know more about Earl Derr Biggers and how he came to write his mysteries, Barbara Gregorich researched the Bobbs-Merrill Archives at the Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington. There she read all the correspondence between Biggers and his editor — correspondence which brings to life the author’s struggles to satisfy the Chan-hungry public.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThe Charlie Chan Films\n\nJames L. NeibaurBear\n\nManor Media (hardcover/softcover, May 1, 2018)\n\nThis book offers a look at all of the films in the Charlie Chan series, including early ones that are now lost, examining each movie in context. Common themes, critical assessments, discussion of the director and the actors, period reviews, production information, and recollections from those who appeared in the films are all included.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThe Library of American Comics Essentials Volume 13: Charlie Chan\n\nAlfred Andriola; Introduction by Bruce Canwell\n\nIDW Publishing (hardcover, July 2019)\n\nThe collected complete first-year run of the Charlie Chan daily newspaper comic strip from October 31, 1938, to November 17, 1939.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nChina and the Chinese in Popular Film:\n\nFrom Fu Manchu to Charlie Chan\n\nJeffrey Richards\n\nBloomsbury Academic (softcover, November 26, 2020)\n\n“There’s a folk memory of China in which numberless yellow hordes pour out of the ‘mysterious East’ to overwhelm the vulnerable West, accompanied by a stereotype of the Chinese as cruel, cunning, and depraved. Hollywood films played their part in perpetuating these myths and stereotypes that constituted ‘The Yellow Peril’. Jeffrey Richards examines in detail how and why they did it. He shows how the negative image was embodied in recurrent cinematic depictions of opium dens, tong wars, sadistic dragon ladies, and corrupt warlords and how, in the 1930s and 1940s, a countervailing positive image involved the heroic peasants of The Good Earth and Dragon Seed fighting against Japanese invasion in wartime tributes to the West’s ally, Nationalist China. The cinema’s split-level response is also traced through the images of the ultimate Oriental villain, the sinister Dr. Fu Manchu, and the timeless Chinese hero, the intelligent and benevolent detective Charlie Chan. Filling a longstanding gap in Cinema and Cultural History, the book is founded in fresh research into Hollywood’s shifting representations of China and its people.”\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCharlie Chan‘s Luxury Cruise\n\nB. Allyn Clayton\n\nAmazon (softcover/hardcover/Kindle, April 1, 2022)\n\n“Jason Fairfax, a very junior reporter for the Honolulu Gazette, is sent by his editor on an assignment that requires him to travel on the luxury liner, the Oahu Paradise, in the company of a disreputable detective who promises him the scoop of his reporting lifetime—maybe. While on board, he meets a cross-section of people from movie stars to ensigns, but none more intriguing than the world-famous Honolulu inspector, Charlie Chan, and his very large family, who are vacationing on board.”\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nThe Wisdom Within Earl Derr Biggers’ Charlie Chan:\n\nThe Original Aphorisms inside the Charlie Chan Canon\n\nLou Armagno\n\nBookBaby (softcover/Kindle, September 4, 2023)\n\n“The Wisdom Within Earl Derr Biggers’ Charlie Chan is a collection of 175 aphorisms found inside the six Charlie Chan novels by author Earl Derr Biggers. This collection differentiates between the original aphorisms of literature and those from 44 films made between 1931 – 1949. Most readers likely never realized the author often borrowed words of wisdom from ancient philosophers: Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, Lao-Tzu and the I Ching. He expertly wove them within his prose to bring deeper insight and meaning. Contrary to this, the movie maxims were written—or rewritten—by scriptwriters and did not serve the same purpose. Hollywood often produced their own fortune-cookie style wisecracks for film having quite the opposite effect as the literature.”\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nSons of Charlie Chan Volume 1: A Complete History of the Asian American Trailblazers\n\nScott Allen Nollen with Yuyun Yuningsih Nollen\n\nBearManor Media (hardcover/softcover, November 2, 2023)\n\n“Charlie Chan has been recognized by fans and critics as one of the most famous of fictional screen detectives, achieving prominence both in the novels of creator Earl Derr Biggers and, of course, through a series of popular films made throughout the 30s and 40s: The Golden Age of Hollywood.\n\n“Assisting the Chinese master detective in solving puzzling and intriguing cinematic mysteries are his Americanized Number One, Two and Three sons: each eager, well-meaning . . . and occasional bumbling.

Through the pages of Volume 1, readers will learn about the backgrounds, early ambitions and the interesting circumstances that landed each their most famous role. In addition, Scott provides detailed information about other early screen appearances and offers a personal look into their lives away from the camera.”\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nDeath, I Said: A Charlie Chan Mystery\n\nJohn L.
