        "text": "CHARLIE CHAN’S SECRET:\n\nHow did the killer[s] know when and how Allen Colby would be coming home so as to plan to kill him before Colby reached San Francisco?\n\nThe bridge being built in the scene where Charlie is headed for San Francisco by clipper is most likely the Oakland Bay Bridge. (Courtesy of Rush Glick).\n\n. . . [A]t the beginning of Charlie Chan’s Secret, there are two divers underwater, but only one is brought up, or did I just miss the other one? (Courtesy of RANDLESEKTA@aol.com) .\n\nWhen the diver brings up Allan Colby’s briefcase, it’s wet. It’s dry in the close-up, as are the papers that Charlie looks over in the boat’s cabin. The papers don’t look like they’ve ever even BEEN wet!\n\nHow come Allen Colby didn’t see the panel in the wall open so the murderer could toss the knife and kill him? And how easily could the killer toss the knife through that size of hole in the wall?\n\nWhen Dick Williams meets Alice Lowell at Colby house, they end up in the séance room where he changes how he rests his arms on the back of a chair, depending on the camera shot used.\n\nWhen is the short-wave radio set up at Colby House, not to mention the ultraviolet light? How could anyone know that they/he would be needing the light and in that position and in that place?\n\nHow did Professor Bowen flick the hidden switch to turn on the “ghost music” sent from their apartment for the séance?\n\nHow did Allan Colby’s body get in the hidden passage-way door during the first séance, and hw does he stay popped up, only to suddenly fall down the stairs?\n\nDoes Charlie bring a chemical analysis bag on each case? If he doesn’t then how does he know which ones to bring it on? (Courtesy of Beckey Truesdale).\n\nWhen Charlie comes back to the Lowell House after discovering the rifle in the church bell tower, he moves the vase to the table for it to act as target for the rifle. How come there was water waiting in it for Baxter to put flowers in it?\n\nWatch the vase after Baxter puts the flowers in it. Freeze the frame when the bullet hits the vase. (Courtesy of Rush Glick).\n\nWatch Baxter when the vase is shot up. He is sprayed with water as he turns and jumps into the Inspector’s arm. When the camera angel shifts, Baxter is completely dry.\n\nWhy wasn’t the Professor arrested at least for conspiracy to murder or accessory after the fact?\n\nDoes Charlie bring a chemical analysis bag to each case? If he doesn’t, how does he know which ones to bring it on?\n\nWhat mode of transportation do the following have in common: Secret, Olympics, Reno, Treasure Island, and Panama?\n\nThey all have characters traveling in clippers.\n\nWhat do Charlie Chan’s Chance, Shanghai, Secret, Treasure Island, Murder Cruise, and Castle in the Desert have in common?\n\nThey all have cats in them – possibly Puzzums!\n\nCHARLIE CHAN AT THE OLYMPICS:\n\nNot exactly a blooper, the masking of the Swastika to obliterate it from the fin of the zeppelin.\n\nYvonne Roland’s wardrobe (including the infamous white fox fur) is left behind on the ship. Does she have—or get—an entirely new one (including new furs) in Berlin?\n\nHow did Miss Roland get down off of that very large ship from her porthole to the boat in the water over 50 feet below in a heavy fog without being seen by anyone? Now you must realize all ships in dense fog have extra lookouts all over the ship watching for other ships and dangers in the water, forward and aft and along both port and starboard sides..and when a ship that large enters into a river or port (especially) river, there is a pilot boat comes along side to bring it into a bouy or dock, in this case a passenger ship it would go dockside…and a special sea detail is set and a port of entrance always sends out a local special pilot to bring the ship in, he takes over from the ships captain, as he know the channels of deep and shallow waters so the ship will not run aground, now saying all that, was she strong enough to go hand over hand down a small line some 50 or more feet without losing her grip, set down in a small boat while this large ship is underway? Without being detected by anyone, you see its quite quiet in fog, and a lookout topside would have heard the engines of a small craft coming alongside, and if he had seen her going over the side he would more than likely shouted out Man Overboard…its not easy to lower someone into a small boat even tho the large ships wake wouldn’t be too bad it would still cause problems…of Olympic proportions…pun intended…theres more to it but this will do for now… (Courtesy of Evan Thompson, expert, having spent 4 years at sea in the U. S. Navy)\n\nWhy does the German policeman coming over the car radio sound like a Los Angeles policeman straight out of Dragnet.\n\nIt just seems at the end of Olympics…Hughes the guy who wants Lee to stand alone so they will shoot him if Charlie doesn’t give out the info as to where the invention is, but then the police bust in and he doesn’t get the chance, they nail the guy with the ink on his feet and the spies…but Hughes seems to get off as no one approaches him to arrest him, then we jump to Lee swimming…UGH…not the ending I was expecting to a great story other wise…. (Courtesy of Evan Thompson)\n\nWhat do Olympics, Monte Carlo and City in Darkness have in common?\n\nThey all have the same set for the climax of the film.\n\nWhat do Opera and Olympics have in common?\n\nLee picks pockets; cigarette “holders” in Opera and Arthur Hughes’ pocket in Olympics.\n\nWhat mode of transportation do the following have in common: Secret, Olympics, Reno, Treasure Island, and Panama?\n\nThey all have characters traveling in clippers.\n\nWhat do Olympics and Shadows Over Chinatown have in common?\n\nThey both use sign language.\n\nCHARLIE CHAN AT TREASURE ISLAND:\n\nHow can four different actors (Cesear Romero, Gerald Mohr, Sidney Toler and, supposedly, Abdul (The Turk) use the same costume of Dr. Zodiac without people recognizing their voices?\n\nAnd how can Abdul be the good doctor when (1) it would be logistically difficult for him to show them into the séance room and then show up in full Zodiac costume so quickly and (2) it doesn’t explain Gerald Mohr’s voice out of Zodiac?\n\nThis isn’t a blooper but watch when Chan goes to Zodiac’s house by himself—a black cat runs past him for bad luck!\n\nThe taxi driver who takes Charlie, Peter Lewis, and Rhadini to Dr. Zodiac’s house doesn’t take the money offered him. He just tears off!\n\nWhen our fearless threesome plus Jimmy have broken into Zodiac’s house, they find his blackmailing vault where he keeps file cabinets of blackmailing information on various people. Charlie starts a fire with the contents of only a few files out of a few drawers. The others are kept closed when Chan closes the vault door. Question: wouldn’t that not only leave most of the files unaffected but severely restrict the oxygen, limiting the potential for fire damage?\n\nThere is an obvious blooper between when Eve Cairo is levitated and when Jimmy is used. Rhadini shows that there is nothing under the levitation table when he levitates Eve. The second time, Rhadini “shows” the underside of the table and there is clearly the wax dummy of Cairo as Jimmy clearly is thrown from the table through a trap door under the table to the basement.\n\nWhen Jimmy slides into the basement during the levitation trick, he rips his pants. So why doesn’t Eve Cairo get her dresses ripped when she does the trick?\n\nJimmy puts on one of Rhadini’s jackets when going on stage to make an announcement for “Pop.” One left shoulder is exaggerated to accommodate Rhadini’s tricks.\n\nWhat do Charlie Chan’s Chance, Shanghai, Secret, Treasure Island, Murder Cruise, and Castle in the Desert have in common?\n\nThey all have cats in them.\n\nWhat do Paris, Treasure Island and Murder Cruise have in common?\n\nThey have at least two different actors using the same costume and no one can apparently tell them aprt by their voices.\n\nWhat do Paris, Shanghai, Treasure Island and Murder Cruise have in common?\n\nThey all have beggars in them.\n\nWhat mode of transportation do the following have in common: Secret, Olympics, Reno, Treasure Island, and Panama?\n\nThey all have characters traveling in clippers.\n\nWhat do Treasure Island and Murder Over New York have in common?\n\nTrevor Burdette plays Hindus in them.\n\nWhat do Treasure Island and Wax Museum have in common?\n\nDr. Zodiac's costume.\n\nCASTLE IN THE DESERT:\n\nIn “Castle in the Desert,” when Charlie first sits down with Mr. Manderley in his study, he attempts to cross his legs and fails miserably. He continues his dialogue with out missing a beat! (Courtesy of Bill Lutters).\n\n1-A world famous detective like Charlie must get tons of requests for “Help and advice”..yet, on a note slipped under the door he changes all his plans without 5 minutes of thought…and heads off to Manderley Castle????\n\n2-Manderley, a multi-millionaire..has only ONE car?? And a low end one like a Ford..wouldn’t you think he’d have two..and maybe a Packard or something?\n\n3-Did Manderley begin his obsession with the Borgias before or after he married his wife? I, mean..his whole life revolves around the Borgias…his car has the Borgia crest, he built a castle like the one Caesre Borgia had..and he tells Lucy..we won’t discuss it????\n\n4-The scar…the owner of the hotel tells Charlie “He won’t talk civil to nobody”…so I’m expected to believe he cares what he townspeople gossip about him?” The scarf probably would make it worse.\n\n5-When Lucy calls Watson King “Jim”…what was all that about?\n\n6-When Charlie shows the Dr. the bottle with the tagara weed, and the Doctor tells Charlie his knowledge of the drug…yet, in the scene in Lucy’s room the Dr. tells Charlie “Where did we obtain the drug, it’s very rare?’’…maybe out of the bottle Charlie showed you a couple of scenes back!\n\n7-At the end of the film Lucy says she is left-handed…yet, if you watch her throughout the film…she does everything right-hand.\n\n8-If Watson King is really a world famous sculptor…and the step-brother of Lucy…why would he need to try and tap into the lawyer for a touch? (Robert J. Hiza).\n\n#6 In regards to “Jim”, It appears from a GOOGLE Search that in 1930’s slang “Jim” is roughly equivalent to “Buddy” or “Mac”. A more modern example would be from the song “Werewolves of London”\n\n“….Better stay away from him\n\nHell rip your lungs out, Jim…..” (Courtesy of Julian M. Lobacewski).\n\nAs you point out, this film has a lot of plot loopholes, as well as other things that make me wonder:\n\n1. The castle has a lot of servants and guards. Do they live there, or do they commute from somewhere, like the Mojave Wells town, and would they need another car to do so?\n\n2. Even with no running water or laundry facilities, the inhabitants of the castle look very well groomed.\n\n3. Apparently an elegant meal is being planned for the guests. It would have to be cooked in a primitive wood stove, or over a fire. How can you store food in such a castle with no refrigeration. (Courtesy of John Cucinotta).\n\nI was just wondering (here we go with the hat thing again), did anyone notice in “Castle in the Desert: that when Honorable Chan step from the taxi that brought him to the towns [sic] only hotel, that when he steped [sic] from the taxi his white hat was creased or “dented” in the back of his hat and in the next scene, seemingly by magic the dent was gone. Hollywood magic I guess, sort of like the gus that seem not to run out of bullits, [sic] etc. (Courtesy of Ken Miller, kmillerqw@hot.rr.com, October 6, 2004).\n\nWhat do Charlie Chan’s Chance, Shanghai, Secret, Treasure Island, Murder Cruise, and Castle in the Desert have in common?\n\nThey all have cats in them.\n\nSECRET SERVICE:\n\nWhen the inventor blows up the ships in his lab at the beginning of the movie, the background doesn’t match the mid-shot.\n\nWhat about the bomb…all were dummies…so how did they explode when he threw one, if he had trown the loaded one they would all be dead…why? Because if you remember the inventor said if that one was to go off it would blow everything within 2 blocks to bits…so what explodes? that chans son threw ??? (Courtesy of Evan Thompson).\n\nCharlie walks through the deserted lobby of a federal building in Washington, D.C., and onto almost as deserted street with little foot and no vehicular traffic to a taxi that just “happens” to be at curbside.\n\nThe California State Flag flying in front of a government building in Washington [D.C.], as well as Charlie’s long walk from the taxi to the house. Daytime when he starts and night when he arrives. (Courtesy of Bill Lutters).\n\nCharlie’s kids, Tommy and Iris, are in his office when he comes in and announces that he has to leave them for a murder investigation. Iris says they don’t know where he’s going and Tommy announces he knows how to figure out where “Pop” is going. The next scene finds them at the right house.\n\nWhen did anyone have the opportunity to electrify the closet door and do the remote switch or the magnetized gun set-up\n\nNow if you have ever seen (he Boogie man will get you)with [sic] boris and peter lorre you will see Mantan in the same machine only in the Charlie Chan one…Mantan jumps in it just before the shooting starts, and comes out and asks them what’s going on I thought I heard shots fired. (Courtesy of Evan Thompson).\n\nNote when Charlie is shot at from behind a curtain, looks like Mantan walks out from behind the same curtain or very close to it. (Courtesy of Evan Thompson).\n\nThe spy lady made a Statue of Liberty for the inventer before she got to his house, so how did the secret plans get inside of it ??? Charlie had to break it to find the plans..not dig into the bottom, if it was closed off..? (Courtesy of Evan Thompson).\n\nand how did she know that her partner in crime was going to sit in the couch right under the gun?? (Courtesy of Evan Thompson).\n\n…[W]hen in the inventors work shop they are shot at by someone..Benson Fong throws a “bomb that is supposed to be a dummy, yet it explodes, had or if he trew the one with the+ on it they as the inventor said ..they would have been blown to bits for 2 blocks around…yet the explosion didn’t do much more than a fire cracker… oh by the way in slang on your blog..a joint is also a marijuana “stick” smoke looks like a roll your own cigarette…just thought I’d drop that on youheheheheee…I think theres another blooper or 2 in that movie…note when Charlie is shot at frm behind a curtain, looks like Mantan walks out from behind the same curtain or very close to it…chk it out. I like that movie…and hey…how about this one the spy lady made a Statue of Liberty for the inventor before she got to his house, so how did the secret plans get inside of it???Charlie had to break it to find the plans,,not dig into the bottom, if it was closed off..? and how did she know that her partner in crime was going to sit in the couch right under the gun??there are a few questions more but that will give you something to hehehe ”Chew” on for a while ….yer pal Evan the blooper snooper…….heheheheeeee\n\nWhat do Secret Service and Shanghai Cobra have in common?\n\nThey both have the Federal Building scene that’s supposed to be set in Washington, D.C., during World War II, yet there are few people and fewer cars. On top of that, the California State Flag is flying at full staff in front of the Federal Building.\n\nSHADOWS OVER CHINATOWN:\n\nThe back window on the bus had a vertical bar in it when the bus turned into the bus station that the window didn’t have when Charlie was talking to the two little old ladies.\n\n[Charlie] runs into an elderly lady whose grand daughter is missing, he goes to the missing persons office and finds a photo of her missing, goes to the grandmother and talks a while, then at a café he spots her…and produces a photo of her…and shows it to son Tommy…where did he get that picture of her? He didn’t ask granny for one and the missing persons place didn’t have one…I watched it 3 times, and I never seen him procure one anywhere in the movie…just a little fun like the turtle with the flash lite on its back, (Courtesy of Evan Thompson).\n\n[I had posted a “whazit” (as opposed to a blooper) on the CCMB about where the turtle with the flashlight on it’s back came from.] …just a little fun like the turtle with the flash lite on its back, I do know the flashlite was Willy Bests as he dropped his when scared, how it balanced on the turtles back is another quirk, but fun… (Courtesy of Evan Thompson).\n\nThe morgue doesn’t have a knob on the inside of the door?!\n\nWhat do Black Camel, Monte Carlo, Honolulu, Shadows Over Chinatown, and Shanghai Chest have in common?\n\nMeals at table.\n\nWhat do Olympics and Shadow Over Chinatown have in common?\n\nThey both use sign language.\n\nWhat do Panama, Murder Over New York, and Murder Over New York have in common?\n\nA suspect gets shot but no one wants the credit for shooting him.\n\nDANGEROUS MONEY:\n\nMy wife and I were watching Dangerous money last nite and I noticed some similarity in the music at the start of it and the start of The Jade Mask…and one other of the CC films but can’t remember which…maybe I’m just getting crazier….and she noticed that when Willy Best dropped in on the cook, he burned his fanny, BUT? When he got down he touched the edge of that same grill and didn’t get burnt…we slow motioned it several times and it sure looked like he did touch the same hot area only at the edge…now we had one of those resturant sized grils in our home for many years and I have grated (holy stone, Cleaned) them many times and where he touched is very hot…10 kids we needed that grill…its been since donated to our local Lions club…and the knife seen in the door way was drawn back a if it were being thrown…but yet we are told its being shot, am I right or didn’t I hear a reason because I fell asleep before I fell asleep before the end….ZZzzz Evan(Courtesy of Evan Thompson).\n\nFreddie, the knife thrower, is running away from the museum. A knife gets him. You hear the sound of a woman laughing in the distance….which sounds rather (for want of a better word) “surrealistic” to laff at someone’s death…..but CC doesn’t want to investigate……he (rightly) feels that it’s just 2 lovers in the jungle….. (Courtesy of Norm Vogel).\n\nTRAP:\n\nSomeone is supposed to run across the beach behind the opening credits. (Courtesy of Rush Glick).\n\nWhen King Cole and his troop arrive at the Malibu house and they start piling out of the station wagon . . . just how many people are IN that station wagon?\n\nThe phone call to Birmingham gives the address of the beach house in Malibu, but a close up of the front door shows a different address later.\n\nThis same phone call that gives Birmingham the address. . . . He scribbles what looks like two letters or numbers but Jimmy can read the entire address when he shows up looking for Birmingham.\n\nThe house is architecturally off. At least one front bedroom has a window in the common wall with the room behind it.\n\nWhen it’s revealed that the doctor is married to one of the showgirls (who’s supposed to be French), she gets emotional and hugs the doctor, losing her French accent and says “What’s the difference?” where she SHOULD have said, “What’s za dif-far-ANCE!”. (Courtesy of Norm Vogel).\n\nOne of the beach scenes has the beach ball tossed one way and it’s seen going in another direction in the next shot. (Courtesy of Doug Palmer).\n\nCharlie not only doesn’t seem to care that the villain steals his car but wrecks it as well at the end of the movie. (Courtesy of Doug Palmer)."
