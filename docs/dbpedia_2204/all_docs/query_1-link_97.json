Charlie agrees to protect him.\n\nHe goes to talk with his wife Marsha, who is sunbathing on the beach, but no wife, all he finds is a kidnap note.\n\nThe police question Kramer's long time secretary Miss Ella Parsons, who explains the picture had been painted by \"close friend\" Andre Paton. She evidently does not like Marsha, \"she's a parasite... I hope she's dead.\"\n\nAndre appears unconcerned about Marsha Kramer's disappearance, as he reckons Kramer \"could do a lot of strange things.\" Charlie offers him some advice on the lines of steering clear of Marsha in future.\n\nPolice listen to a recording tape made by her, \"please do what they ask. They want $50,000.\" Charlie works out from this tape that \"it's an inside job.\"\n\nKramer pays the money but Charlie and the police stake the place out, and it's Andre, they follow him back to his studio. But what a shock there, the corpse of Marsha Kramer!\n\n\"I didn't kill her,\" claims Andre. Charlie is inclined to believe him, for he argues, why would Andre have returned to his studio if he knew Marsha's dead body was lying there? \"That's a big fat question,\" comments the cop in an understatement of near genius.\n\nElla hands Charlie his fee. She's pleased Marsha is dead, for her boss is now free of his grasping wife.\n\nOn the beach where the kidnap story had begun, Charlie \"expresses his regrets\" to the sorrowing Kramer. But, he adds cryptically, hate is the most powerful motive for murder.\n\nAnd taking the hint, rushing as fast as he can, Kramer heads for Andre's studio where he finds that proof. A sad confrontation is interrupted by Charlie. \"You knew all the time!\" The killer confesses.\n\nThis was not a good start to the series. Don't watch this one first if you can help it. The stunning beach shots are the best thing in a feeble story.\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSecret of the Sea\n\nCharlie Chan is in San Pedro. \"Something big\" is destined to happen on the Honolulu Star, reports an informer, who is shot dead.\n\nCharlie investigates the murder of this man, a steward on the ship. Thus we find Charlie bound for a \"calm, uneventful voyage,\" at least that's what Captain Paul Carnovan promises him. But there are plenty of suspicious characters of course, the clumsy steward who has replaced the dead man, Ed Barker radio signaller, as well as the incompetent chief engineer Johnny Flynn. One of the other rare passengers is Doris, wife of the captain, and much younger than him. Oddly she wears high heels on board.\n\nWhen the engine seizes up 200 miles out to sea, and the crew cannot find the cause, it's Chan who points out the source of the trouble, \"loaded with dirt.\" Flynn is sent for to get a piece of the captain's mind but he's found \"extremely dead.\" The captain has no choice but radio for help, which is soon forthcoming from a ship out of Acapulco commanded by Arturo Ramirez. It's an expensive operation, with the salvage bill coming to $150,000.\n\nSo has Carnovan colluded with Ramirez to share this absurdly large fee? Maybe not, as Lt Kovacs and Chan arrive in the nick of time to prevent Carnovan from shooting Ramirez! Their dispute is over the attractive Doris, has she been two-timing? \"He didn't do anything,\" Doris promises her husband as he bursts into tears. Asks Ramirez, \"tell me what's going on. I don't get any of this.\" That goes for me too.\n\nCharlie \"straightens\" him, though not me, out, expounding his theory of collusion between Ramirez and someone on the Honolulu Star. But if it wasn't Cpt Carnovan, who was it?\n\nA gun persuades Charlie to search no further. But some exceptionally clumsy feinting from Chan incredibly enables him to snatch the dangerous gun and arrest the accomplice. \"You explain things very well.\" Allegedly\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Lost Face\n\nThis is an unpleasant opening, clumsily executed, as a woman has acid thrown at her in her San Fernando Valley home, while outside a little girl plays ball. She sees the attacker leave.\n\nThe LA police warn Charlie Chan that \"prosperous\" Dan Randolph is \"too dangerous\" a man to investigate. Randolph is an attorney who specialises in getting villains released on bail, later they mysteriously get bumped off.\n\nHis latest atrocity is the one seen at the beginning. The wife of crime reporter Zac has had acid thrown in her face, she is likely to lose her sight.\n\nJack Hart is identified as the attacker by the child, and he's one of Randolph's \"boys.\" His lawyer is urging his release and the perceptive Charlie proposes that Hart choose between leaving the police station with Randolph, or stay in custody. Hart chooses bail.\n\nZac decides to take the law into his own hands and give the evil Randolph his due. \"I didn't hit him that hard,\" he tells the cops, but Randolph has been killed! Zac's in a spot, and \"I don't have a Dan Randolph to get me off.\"\n\nCharlie is paid by the friendly neighbourhood barman to do a Randolph for Zac. He succeeds and now races to prevent the inevitable \"imminent departure from this world\" of Jack Hart. He achieves this by the unusual method of accusing Hart of murdering Randolph, and exposing his own paymaster of being another of Randolph's hatchet men.\n\nAt least that payment comes in useful for an eye operation to restore Zac's wife's sight\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBlind Man's Bluff\n\nI suspect this was intended to be the first story, for it begins with Charlie flying with No1 Son from Mexico in to LA International Airport.\n\nThey emerge to witness a blind fellow passenger being shot in an abortive attempt to snatch the man's guide dog, which runs away, only to get run over. Charlie, against all First Aid principles, kindly carries the injured dog to the Westchester animal hospital where a vet treats it. However he has a surprise, it's not actually a guide dog for the blind.\n\nCharlie fills in the LA police and then has a great scene with No1 Son discussing the crime. Barry, whose special study assignment is Criminal Deduction, enthusiastically demonstrates with his giant blackboard the Soderheim system of visual thinking. \"One factor missing,\" quips dad, who's the killer?\n\nWhile Charlie sleeps on this problem, Barry breaks into the hospital. Unfortunately the dog thief has the same idea, wanting to steal the dog. Thus poor Barry is hit on the head unconscious. Why? \"Wish I had my blackboard,\" sighs No1 Son when he comes round. Quick as a flash, Charlie explains to the bemused cop that this method \"obviates all the old system of using the brain.\"\n\nCharlie's brain has grasped what we, though not No1 Son, have guessed, namely the dead man was no blind man. He was a smuggler. But what, and where were the goods hidden? In the dog's collar, which has now been given by Nurse Sheila to Juanita, a young Mexican.\n\nThe smugglers track him down, but so does Charlie. In a dangerous bluffing game at the end of a gun, Charlie warns them the dog had rabies. Describing the frightening symptoms, they seem to fall for the ruse.\n\n\"Soon you will have cramps,\" warns Charlie. But No1 Son bursts in at this point, excited because he's learned where the collar is.\n\n\"There it is,\" he shouts, unwisely pointing to the boy with the dog's collar. He further blurts out that dad is really a police inspector, whereupon the gun is prepared to fire at Charlie. But the lad's dog saves the day and the crooks are arrested. In the collar are found diamonds.\n\nThere's a nice punchline to an otherwise poor story, the police kindly suggest their success is due, well might have been due, to No1 Son's blackboard\n\nTo Chan menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Great Salvos\n\nCharlie is in Washington DC, where plans for a new jet engine Project 5 have been stolen from Professor Douglas Fenton.\n\nRands night club, with a reputation for being cover for espionage, is the venue for Charlie's party with the Fentons, a farewell before the great detective flies off to Madrid. Charlie has brought Barry, No 1 Son, who has just completed his criminology course, and the only other guest of Mr and Mrs Fenton is a Dr Kruger. From Hungary, The Great Salvos provide the floor show, a brother and sister mind reading act. A blindfolded Reena is amazingly able to reveal the details about the Chans' journey to Europe.\n\nNo1 Son has deduced that the robbery at the Fenton's is the work of Dr Kruger, who has been prescribing Mrs Fenton with aspirin for her headaches, he's the guilty party. Can't be him then!\n\nCharlie is hit on the head in his hotel room, but Barry chases the attacker off. Nothing stolen though Charlie's watch is damaged.\n\nThat night Reena Salvo interrupts Charlie's sleep, \"a matter of life or death.\" They meet in a park, where a masked man tries to rob Charlie. Wise old Charlie is even cleverer than Reena, he knows who the attacker is, her brother Karl. Something has been hidden inside his watch, the microfilm stolen from Fenton! Reena tells Charlie that she and brother Carl are refugees from Hungary, and are being blackmailed to act as spies, otherwise their parents will come to harm.\n\nAfter some checking Charlie is able to learn that the parents are safe in an Austrian refugee camp.\n\nAt Dick Rands' cabaret, he returns the Fenton's hospitality with a Surprise Party. He casually lays his watch on the table. The lights dim, all part of Charlie's trap. The Great Salvos begin their act. Charlie has a 'message' which he asks Carl to get Reena to mind read. Hearing the good news her parents are safe, she is also able to assist Charlie in his request to find his watch which has disappeared.\n\nAfter a dramatic pause, \"it's in Mrs Fenton's handbag,\" reveals Reena. \"Excellent demonstration,\" praises Charlie as his watch comes to light.\n\n\"How did you do it?\" asks a baffled No1 Son.\n\nThe last US-made story, before Charlie flies to Europe.\n\nTo Chan menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Counterfeiters\n\nPan Am Flight 654 from New York lands at London Airport with distinguished passenger Charlie Chan, accompanied by No1 Son Barry, for the first of their European based adventures. (It had been stated Charlie was flying to Madrid in the previous story, but who cares?)\n\nGreeting him is Inspector Duff (Patrick Holt, later in the series to be transformed into Rupert Davies) who wants Charlie to investigate the theft of a French currency plate from a venerable London firm of banknote engravers. The pompous manager of the firm, Sir John (John Loder) tells Charlie how a courier had produced documents which later proved to be forged, and carried off the 5,000 franc plate. Forged notes will soon be causing a crisis in France! \"Wow, what a natural!\" exclaims No1 Son. Charlie translates this utterance for his British hosts.\n\nSpeeding to Paris, Charlie shows the police the forged papers which are identified as the work of Spanish Roy, a valuable member of the orange Circuit resistance during the war, trained to be a forger. \"The man's a genius,\" admits Inspector Chauvet.\n\nNo1 Son attempts to trace Roy at the Cafe Mandrake where he's early relieved of his passport. \"I'm looking for Spanish Roy, he's a shoemaker,\" explains Barry, not realising he is, by chance, addressing the very man. \"Lucky we're honest,\" says Roy, returning the passport. Later Barry realises his blunder, when Roy responds to Charlie's invitation to talk. But as they talk a bullet flies through the window, aimed at Spanish Roy. Luckily a pocket chess set saves his life, but the incident seems to decide him not to talk after all. Though Roy is arrested, Charlie secures his release, but this favour still won't budge him \"I'm still not talking.\" Charlie surmises Roy forged the documents for a friend, an old resistance leader, perhaps. Michel is the name, but Roy refuses to reveal his real identity.\n\nHowever he changes his mind later and as Charlie is not there, hands Barry an envelope with Michel's real name, \"highly confidential.\" In absence of honourable dad, Barry hands it to Sir John. We all know who he really is, of course. All except Barry. \"We know who's behind the gang,\" No1 Son naively informs Sir John, who scribbles a note for No1 Son to take to police, and there Barry is arrested.\n\nAt the old underground headquarters Charlie comes face to face with Michel. Why did you do it? asks Charlie. Sir John explains he wanted to pit his wits against the best, ie Chan. But his ex-colleagues are disiilusioned with such behaviour and mete out their own very summary justice.\n\nCharlie returns Spanish Roy's chess set to him.\n\nUncredited speaking extra: secretary to Sir John. Police car: NLN820\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDeath of a Don\n\nNo1 Son is studying crime at the famous Stratford University, and has made friends with music student Derek Robinson (Francis Matthews). Derek is at loggerheads with his professor Dr Don Wellman (John Bailey) who scorns the young man's soulful compositions, \"you call that music!\" He \"lacks talent\" and writes \"undisciplined drivel,\" in other words Dr Wellman doesn't go for avant garde stuff at all. Goaded, poor Derek responds to the stinging remarks, \"you're dead, washed up, living in the past, there's nothing in the future for people like you, except death.\" Armed with such a line, we await the inevitable murder.\n\nDerek is rusticated for such rudeness. When introduced to Charlie, the wise advice is \"apologise.\" Derek attempts to do so, when he catches up with Wellman who is at a show I'm In a Dancing Mood at the Palace Theatre. Musical director is Jack Pearson (William Franklyn) and Janet Rushton (Betty McDowall) is his leading lady. She's Dr Wellman's ex-wife. He has come to seek a reconciliation, but she tells him, \"it's no use.\" The show must go on anyway. It appears to be a mixture of ballet, not to Charlie's taste, and music of the nations.\n\nDuring the interval Wellman offers to resign from his post if she will come back to him. While No1 Son and honourable dad enjoy some frenzied dancing to bongo drums, Derek goes backstage to apologise to Wellman. But he stumbles over his enemy, stabbed to death. Blood on Derek's hands is an obvious clue.\n\n\"Murder, call the police!\" shouts the doorman, and the show doesn't go on any more.\n\nOf course Derek is chief suspect, though Charlie points out to the dim inspector that Janet Rushton might also have a motive, as does Jack Pearson, who seems smitten with Janet, although he had been conducting the orchesta at the time of the killing.\n\nThe murder weapon cannot be found. According to forensic evidence, it must have been a round object about the thickness of a pencil. \"Everything now quite clear,\" pronounces Charlie.\n\nIt is to Barry too, for in Janet's dressing room he thinks he has found the weapon, a hat pin. So we know that eliminates her! \"Case already closed,\" Charlie informs No1 Son bluntly.\n\nFor Charlie is now moving in to corner the killer during the next performance of the show, \"you had opportunity and motive.\" He had spotted what had been overlooked. Barry does redeem himself by felling the fleeing murderer.\n\nThus Derek is reinstated at the university and Charlie bids farewell to No1 Son, who is to continue his studies. Barry remembers dad's birthday is coming up, so shouts to Charlie's departing taxi, asking him what he'd like. Bongos, comes back the answer.\n\nMaybe, in view of this final scene, this was intended to be Barry's final appearance in the series?\n\nUncredited speaking part: police constable. Charlie's taxi: GHX688\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nCharlie's Highland Fling\n\n\"Hoots mon,\" is Charlie's greeting to No1 Son, who enters dancing in a kilt, for they are the guests in the ancestral home of Sir Malcolm Gregg in Glentarn Scotland.\n\nWingate, Malcolm's friend and lawyer (Ian Fleming), gives Charlie the lowdown on the elderly Malcolm's marriage to young Lady Gregg, which is on the rocks. His son, 'Master Donald,' Lady Gregg's stepson is the cause of the rift. But it's clear Wingate does not like her, \"she's as welcome as the plague.\"\n\nSo there are no dry eyes, och aye, when news is received of her death on the Perth road. But this is no road accident, she's been shot in her sports car.\n\nAfter three days away in Perth, Donald drives home again. On the way he stops off to see his sweetheart Betsy, daughter of convicted poacher Duncan, but had he also stopped off for anything else? A rifle in his car looks exceptionally suspicious. Runnals, the butler (Ballard Berkeley) takes it out of the car.\n\nBarry examines it and notes enthusiastically, \"this gun was fired a short time ago.\" Now he has his suspect, at least until Charlie points out that Donald would hardly have left a murder weapon lying around, if he were the killer.\n\nSo Barry latches on to another suspect. Duncan has just escaped from prison. He'd been put there thanks to Lady Gregg's testimony, and he'd sworn to get even with her. But Sir Malcolm doesn't believe this, explaining that Duncan is very short sighted.\n\nWingate is Barry's new suspect. In his room are travel brochures for far away places like Honduras, even though it appears he may be in financial difficulties. So No1 Son goes off sleuthing, but ends up in a secret passage attacking honourable dad in error. To make amends, Barry promises, \"I'll bring you the murderer on a plate!\"\n\nHe nearly does, when he grabs a gun and orders his latest suspect Runnals to put up his hands. The well trained butler replies in the best butlery tradition,\"as you wish sir.\" Barry reveals the result of his searches. He has found the murder weapon in the butler's room. And this butler is in fact the brother of Lady Gregg. But Charlie calms his excited son and produces \"plenty of proof\" of the real murderer.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you he did it, pop!\" shouts No1 Son in triumph. \"Right suspect,\" agrees Charlie, \"but for wrong reason.\"\n\nI like this little mini-film, set in fresh Highland air.\n\nLady Gregg's car: STW53\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Patient in Room 21\n\nI like this well constructed story, partly because of its strong cast.\n\nDr Paul Liggat (Peter Dyneley) was convicted in 1947 in Canada for a mercy killing. Ten years later under the name of Michael Winstead he is working as a surgeon at the Mercy Hospital London where No1 Son is enjoying being treated by Nurse Elizabeth Vernon (Honor Blackman). Charlie is there too, to see Chief Surgeon George Morley and Sir Edward Pomeroy, Chairman of the Board of Directors (Raymond Francis). Morley has received an anonymous letter about Winstead's past, plus a press cutting of the trial in Ottawa of a Dr Liggat. \"It does look like Dr Winstead,\" gasps Barry.\n\nCharlie promises to do \"humble best\" and find if Liggat and Winstead are one and the same. His starting point is the accusing letter, which however is stolen from Barry's room that night. A concussed Barry ends up in hospital again, happily treated by Nurse Elizabeth. Recovered, Barry is sent by dad to Ottawa to get the dope on the case first hand. When he returns, he brings with him Anne Gerald, the victim's private nurse.\n\n\"I've never seen him before,\" is her response. But though he is vindicated, Winstead admits the truth. \"I shall leave at once,\" he adds, even though he claims he never killed his Canadian patient.\n\nPrivately afterwards, Charlie is curious why Miss Gerald had failed to identify him. Charlie believes it was she who performed the mercy killing, even though she doesn't admit as much.\n\nShe then talks to Liggat, \"I'd do anything to undo it,\" she tells him. She agrees to confess to the truth, but inevitably before Charlie can talk to her she is silenced, a knife in her back. However she is still breathing, and Dr Winstead tends her.\n\nCharlie discusses developments with Sir Edward, who is however unwell with acute ileitis. Morley is about to operate, but Charlie recommends postponement, since, he claims, Morley has tried to kill Anne.\n\n\"You're mad,\" is all Sir Edward can reply with a groan, but it is enough to solve the case for the inscrutable Charlie.\n\nThe unseen Inspector Duff is on the case. With her dying breath, Anne Gerald has at least cleared Winstead.\n\nBut it's Charlie who solves her murder when he revisits Sir Edward, lying on the operating trolley. He tells the patient he has arranged for Winstead to operate. But Sir Edward raves that he does not want to be treated by a murderer. In his delirium, he confesses it was he who had sent the anonymous letter, for he loves Elizabeth, and was jealous of rival Winstead. How he got off his sick bed to murder Miss Gerald is never revealed!\n\nBut he has now admitted all. Ironically Charlie tells him in a last sad line, \"Mr Morley will perform operation. He will save your life for the hangman.\"\n\nUncredited extra (non-speaking): the nurse-witness\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Rajput Ruby\n\nA guided tour of The Tower of London, location shooting done here, with members of the group casting Furtive Looks at oneother. In The White Tower a scream,\"my necklace- its gone!\" The necklace of the Maharanee (Jill Melford) has been stolen.\n\nHis Highness the Maharajah of Rajput offers a reward of $25,000 for the return of the 2,000 year old necklace.\n\nCharlie is retained by him on the case. He examines The White Tower. A police inspector (Charles Morgan) has made an unsuccessful search for the necklace, despite a nine hour questioning of all the tourists. \"How was it gotten out of here. pop?\" eager Barry asks honourable dad.\n\nHis Highness sacks Joe (Bill Nagy) his private detective, who has failed to prevent three other thefts this past year. Joe makes \"a friendly call\" on Charlie, warning him that \"the maharajah carries diamonds and rubies around as though they are peanuts.\" He blames the Maharajah for his carelessness with his valuables. He says Ida Kelly \"a pretty kid from Brooklyn\" only consented to become the Maharanee for his cash.\n\nBarry's theory is that Ida and Joe are secret lovers- so that can be discounted! In Joe's room, No1 Son searches for a clue to justify himself, but all he can find is a torn up photo of Ida kissing am ex-baseball player called Lefty Ryan (Maurice Kaufmann). Lefty, Barry knows, had been \"thumped out of baseball,\" due to his uncertain temper. Moreover he had been in the group of tourists that day in the Tower.\n\nIn fact Lefty is offering Joe a 50-50 split of the ruby. Joe refuses, for he \"is about to fly nest.\" Barry trails him.\n\nCharlie meanwhile is interviewing His Highness, who does know of his wife's affair. Now Chan knows who stole the ruby.\n\nIn Suite 914, he reveals all. \"Who took it?\" the maharanee asks.\n\n\"You did your highness,\" smiles Charlie. He means that she smuggled it out of the tower, to pay a blackmailer. Naturally she denies Charlie's accusation.\n\nBarry has followed Joe into Dikker's shop, where expert diamond cutting is done. Joe is offering to sell the Rajput Ruby. Lefty, who has been following them both, grabs the necklace, and as he is holding a gun, Joe agrees to that split. As for No1 Son, \"you're going to be wrapped in a parcel and dropped in the Thames River!\"\n\nLuckily for Barry, his father arrives in time to prevent such a tragedy. A phone call to Inspector Duff wraps the case up.\n\nUncredited speaking roles: 1 Tower Guide. 2 Bellboy (Donal Donnelly)\n\nTo Charlie Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFinal Curtain\n\nCharlie and Barry are staying at the Archway Hotel London, planning a visit to Stratford-on-Avon. The Earl of Latham interrupts their plans, asking for \"a complete dossier\" on Johnny Douglas (David Oxley) who is dating his daughter Barbara. Her late mother Norah was heiress of Harley the famous car manufacturer. \"I'd kill him,\" swears the client, whom Charlie perceives is actually a penniless actor, the once famous Philip Royce (John Longden), \"you made a Prince come alive.\" No1's verdict however is, \"Royce is a phoney.\"\n\nIndeed \"swindler\" Johnny is a fortune seeker, but it seems that he has actually fallen for his intended victim, much to the jealousy of his partner in crime Claire Harris. Charlie and Barry talk to her and it is clear \"pot of gold has been found at foot of rainbow.\"\n\nRoyce gives a report on the dubious Johnny to his sceptical daughter. But she's in love also, cornily explaining, \"for the first time in my life I'm truly happy.\" So Royce phones Charlie, who overhears Royce shouting at Johnny who has just come into his room. Royce is shot dead.\n\nEasy for Inspector Duffer to solve this one, \"clear enough what happened.\" Johnny is arrested by the Duffer, \"you should have hung up the telephone first!\"\n\nDespite what Charlie had heard over the phone, Douglas protests his innocence, and Charlie is amazingly inclined to accept his statement. He gives an alibi, he had been with Claire Harris, but maybe she is so envious of his relationship with Barbara, she refutes that alibi.\n\n\"With woman like that,\" Charlie comments, \"he has no need for enemies.\"\n\nNo1 has \"the whole thing figured out,\" his new suspect is Claire, so we know it can't be her! All pop had heard was a recording, according to Barry. He decides to ply her with champagne to get the truth out of her, but \"bubbly champagne very very sneaky,\" and he ends up the very much the worse for drink himself.\n\nCharlie finds out that there had been a splash immediately after the shooting. Four storeys down on the ground, the water butt had suddenly splashed. As Royce had once been \"a brilliant actor\" it's evident to the great detective, Charlie that is, that Royce had killed himself. Charlie explains to Barbara how he did it, as Duffer's eyebrows are raised.\n\nBut Charlie is able to vindicate his theory that Royce committed suicide to implicate Johnny in his 'murder' when the gun is discovered in the water butt/\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Porter. 2 Barbara's maid. 3 Policeman. 4 Police sergeant\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDeath at High Tide\n\nNazi war criminal Karl Brettner has excaped prison. As he's the only man alive who knows the exact location where the SS Patrick was sunk by his men during ze war, it's important he's found before he gets away with the cargo of ten million dollars worth of gold bullion. Charlie is employed by insurance broker Frank Wells to recover the treasure.\n\nLe Bon Marane is an inn near Bordeaux run by Henri and his wife Marie (Lisa Daniely), she never leaves the place, grieving for her parents who had been killed by the Gestapo. Here Charlie stays with No 1 Son, at his most Barryish, the only other guest being an American, John Robey (Peter Dyneley), who was the only survivor from the SS Patrick, and who owed his life to Henri's prompt action.\n\nIt's a wild and stormy night and while dad sleeps, No1 Son watches, on the lookout for Brettner. Inevitably he dozes, and misses an important conversation between Robey, Henri and the shadowy Brettner about how to retrieve the gold and split the proceeds. All this is opposed by Marie.\n\nNext day, they meet prison guard Jakob, who is after Brettner also. He claims he has lost his job because of Brettner's escape.\n\nOn the beach, Brettner is found dead, clutching a gold bar! According to Henri, Brettner had first killed John Robey in a quarrel over sharing the loot, and Henri now offers to help Charlie and Barry. The police conclude that Robey was the killer. Now it's time for No1's theory, gold oxidises unless polished, but when kept underwater it should turn black, but the bar Brettner was holding was not black. Charlie beams at Barry's unaccustomed astuteness.\n\nNext night, as Barry sleeps, Charlie discovers Robey tied up in the cellar of the inn. After a fight, Charlie faces the murderer with the facts. The hiding place of the gold is revealed.\n\nUncredited speaking part: German guard\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nCircle of Fear\n\n\"It's no use... I can't cut the diamond,\" jeweller Emil van Boorman protests. It's the largest stone to have come from a Nigerian mine in the past fifty years. Charlie Chan, staying at the Archway Hotel London, is asked to recover this diamond which has been stolen.\n\nInspector Duff has already arrested the belligerent Bert Conway for attacking the diamond cutter, but Bert claims he \"had nothing to do with it,\" the robbery that is, adding that he's being framed by Franz Webber (Arnold Marle), assistant to van Boorman.\n\nHowever Emil's wife (Patricia Burke) has identified Bert as the attacker of her husband, so the Duffer's case seems pretty cut and dried. Mrs van Boorman's son Joe Hawkins attends college in Amsterdam. Her doctor, Dr George Laird (Leonard Sachs) stops Charlie questioning her when she gets worked up. It's clear he's in love with her. He does tell Charlie he'd been treating Emil for nerves, with a tranquilizer.\n\nBarry, who is under instructions to watch and learn, takes things into his own hands, searching the doctor's files. He finds details of Emil's prescription, only to be discovered, as per usual. The doctor phones complaining to Charlie. He counters Dr Laird's charges against No1 Son, with the information that analysis of Emil's pills show they are not tranquilizers, but stimulants.\n\n\"That doctor's mixed up somewhere in it, I know it,\" Barry tells dad later. Though he also has to admit, \"Sounds screwy, pop... I don't get any of this.\"\n\nWebber is also being prescribed tablets, and they are stimulants! It seems the war had taken its toll on him. Also Conway, who has been released, has vowed to get his own back on Webber. Charlie and No1 Son stop him. There and then, Charlie exposes a wartime collaborator and persuades Duff to arrest the real thief.\n\n\"I knew it was him all the time,\" declares optimistic No1 Son.\n\nUncredited speaking roles: 1 Van Boorman. 2 Bert Conway (Michael Balfour). 3 Chemist. 4 Miss Webber (Norah Gordon). 5 Airport inspector. 6 Joe Hawkins (Ian Whittaker)\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nExhibit in Wax\n\nAt Madame Tussaud's (\"entrance 3/-\"), curator Mr Wallace (Ronald Leigh-Hunt) is showing Charlie and Inspector Duff some of the famous exhibits, when a man knocks the head off the wax model of Edward Simpson, the Brighton Murderer. Quick as a flash, Duff arrests the man, an Alan Roberts (Brian Nissen), a bank clerk. He has just found out that this killer was his real father. Simpson had been hanged in July 1927 for the murder of his wife. The husband's broken spectacles in her hands had been the crucial evidence that proved his guilt. Simpson admitted the glasses were his, but denied killing her. But Charlie has his own theory, though the Duffer scoffs, \"couldn't have happened that way.\"\n\nRoberts is blackmailed for £1,000, and fearing for his continued employment at the Bank of England agrees to pay up.\n\nOptometrist Dr Antrim repairs the spectacles that the waxwork model had been wearing. These were a copy of the actual glasses of the murderer.\n\nThe executor of the Simpson estate, John Kingsley, now Roberts' boss at the bank, says he has been \"like a father\" to the young man. He states that a George Winslow was one of the few people who knew of Roberts' real identity, who had been adopted in the aftermath of the trial. Winslow was Simpson's solicitor. \"I hardly knew him,\" contradicts Winslow. One thing is clear, however, that Winslow is exceptionally short sighted.\n\nAnother murder- this time Dr Antrim. Wallace finds him in Tussaud's, shot dead. Roberts' £1,000 is on his person. However though Roberts has a gun, it has not been fired recently.\n\nIt's the spectacles that yield the solution to the case of this ancient murder, and the more recent one. \"Clouds are now clearing, inspector,\" Charlie tells the Duffer. Though Simpson had admtted the glasses were his, thus leading to his condemnation, Charlie can show that the actual lenses in them were not those of Simpson. \"Simpson's figure has been wearing the murderer's glasses for thirty years.\" Who knew this? Who had swapped the lenses? \"I am afraid I don't understand,\" Duff's remark should have been an epitaph written on his gravestone. But he's not the only puzzled one.\n\nDr Antrim had obviously discovered the truth and had been killed for it. After some explanation, Duff believes he can see the light- but he can't! Charlie is of course able to put him on the right track: \"actual person who tried to deceive humble duck \" With a flourish he announces the killer and proceeds to the finish with the poetical line: \"curious duck will now put foot on unsuspecting worm!\" It was , as Charlie admits, a million to one chance.\n\nLater, Mr Wallace proudly shows Charlie the new wax model of the real Brighton murderer.\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 George the guard. 2 Mr King. 3 Miss Dawson (Rosemary Frankau). 4 Policeman at the Yard. 5 Winslow's secretary. 6 Man counting banknotes\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBackfire\n\nSir Basil Dawson's moment of triumph, as he finds the secrets of an Egyptian tomb, is shortlived, for his identical cousin shuts him inside to die, \"you'll never get away with it.\"\n\nAssuming Basil's identity, the imposter (Bruce Seton) meets Charlie at the British Museum. He asks Charlie to find his long-lost 'wife' Monica, so he can divorce her.\n\nCharlie agrees to help and Inspector Duff is able to loan him a \"dusty\" file on Lady Dawson's disappearance. Barry, unusually silent up till now, bets he can find her first, and he employs the simple method of placing an ad in the Evening News, \"Lady Monica Dawson, last heard of at Wanborough Manor Hertfordshire, please contact advertiser....\"\n\nCharlie however is pursuing his own more productive line of inquiry. At St Mary's Home Richmond he meets Monica's mother who blames her daughter for her failed marriage. A religious lesson from Charlie alleviates her bitterness, and she hands over to Charlie a photo of Monica.\n\nAt Wellington School, Charlie obtains a photo of Basil, when he had been a pupil there. A teacher tells of Basil's \"black sheep\" cousin Richard, full of anti-establishment ideals, leader of the New Progressive Party. Charlie locates the impoverished fellow (William Franklyn) at Speaker's Corner. \"This man's an imposter,\" he tells Charlie of the new Basil. It's something to do with his ears! Charlie learns how Basil had recently inherited a million.\n\nEnid (Virigina Keiley), carer to Monica's mother, reads Barry's ad, and spots the chance. She is able to produce some proof of who she is and the convinced No1 Son introduces her to her 'husband.'\n\n\"This is wonderful!\" exclaims the false Basil to his pretend wife. Over tea the couple discuss their future, it soon becoming clear Enid knows she is dealing with a phoney. He has no choice but accept her as his wife.\n\n\"I told you I could handle the case,\" boasts Barry. But Charlie has used his incredible detective skills, and with the aid of his photo, shows that young Basil's ears were a different shape to the current one's. Coolly, Basil burns the photo Charlie had obtained, \"there goes your proof.\" But Charlie can trump that for Inspector Duff enters asking if he is Sir Basil. Of course! Then, announces Duff, \"I arrest you for the murder of your wife.\" Charlie had found her body embalmed in a mummy, murdered years ago by her real husband.\n\nCousin Richard inherits the fortune and thanks Charlie, though his newly inherited wealth seems to have gone to his head\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPatron of the Arts\n\nCharlie Chan is admiring the paintings at the Brussels museum, \"a temple of beauty,\" though No1 Son is drawn to the more contemporary beauty of Monica (Adrienne Corri). She's the wife of artist Paul Breton (Maurice Kaufmann), and pitying their financial plight, Charlie buys the couple a slap up meal meal.\n\nPaul has been forced to sell one of his paintings very cheaply to dealer Francois Duval (Lloyd Lamble). Paul is in the traditional state of an artist, unrecognised in his own lifetime. But his \"untimely death\" would surely increase the value of his paintings, or as Duval puts it, \"if something very sad were to happen, his pictures would certainly increase highly in value.\" Another artist, Baldini, had recently committed suicide, allegedly, and this is the background to an evil scheme.\n\nDuval's assistant Andre has run up huge debts at Renaud's gambling joint. There's something about art collector Renaud that makes Charlie distrust him. With good reason, for he has forced Andre to break into Paul's studio and shoot him, to effect his posthumous glory plan. But he bungles for Paul is only grazed in his shoulder. Charlie senses another attempt will be made, but he should have also been more concerned about his own safety!\n\nOutside Renaud's casino stands Barry's brand new sports car. No1 Son proudly prepares to start it up, but it's been tampered with and only Charlie's quick thinking saves them, \"if you had started car, we would now be paying premature visit to honourable ancestors.\"\n\nAfter a failed attempt to push Paul under a bus, Renaud asks Paul to sell some pictures, but really also to finish him off. But Andre has rebelled and is threatening \"I will shoot Paul Breton with your gun,\" he tells Renaud, \"then I will shoot you.\" They struggle and Renaud is killed just as Paul enters, \"in a moment I will make you immortal,\" announces Andre. But Charlie walks up, \"excuse unexpected visit,\" he explains to Paul, \"but in digging up tree, one must start with roots.\"\n\nDuval is arrested too, as Charlie ends with a line from Shakespeare\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHamlet in Flames\n\nBack in 1940 Col Schmidt (Raymond Huntley) had forced a marquis to sell him a $200,000 first folio of Hamlet made in 1603 for $100, and his own life would be spared. Having signed the bill of sale dating it 1937, with Nazi evil, the marquis is then shot.\n\nNow it is 1957, and Charlie and Barry are at Baron Schmidt's chateau to ask permission for No1 Son to photograph the folio, which is being sold through dealer Rudolf Zeigler. Representing the Shakespearean Historical Society, Arthur Fitzroy is one potential purchaser. \"I don't trust him,\" says Schmidt.\n\nWhen Charlie and No1 Son arrive at Zeigler's shop, they interrupt a thief, we can see it is Schmidt wearing a mask, who has to flee empty handed. Barry, right for this once, relays this suspicion to Inspector Steiner.\n\nThat night, at Zeigler's bookshop, Barry, alone, photos the folio. Charlie is enjoying a chat with Inspector Steiner, \"like retired fire horse who smells the smoke, I can't resist the lure of police headquarters.\" The phone rings and Barry is told his father has been taken seriously ill. Nothing doubting, Barry rushes to his dad's side, to find he is perfectly well. Charlie sees the whole plot at once, but too late. Zeigler's is on fire. In the rubble is Barry's camera, the charred folio, as well as the corpse of the Baron.\n\n\"Ex Chinese policeman not born yesterday.\" This fire was arson, and as for Baron, he had been \"dead before it started, shot through the heart.\" Further, the Hamlet hadn't been destroyed in the fire.\n\nFitzroy and his friend Pierre Lebec were wartime buddies of the marquis, and had been determined to avenge his death. But they deny killing Schmidt. \"There was only one man\" who could have killed him, Charlie announces. Motive: theft of the folio. Schmidt had been trying to steal his own property, in an insurance swindle, when this other thief had interrupted him and accidentally shot him. After a sad confession, the folio is returned to its rightful owner. The story ends with No1 Son playing with a gun, \"pistol in hand of No1 Son is like giving child stick of dynamite- too dangerous.\"\n\nUncredited speaking parts: Douglas Wilmer as Marquis Francois Remy. 2 Butler\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDateline Execution\n\nFather Dolan (Richard Caldicot) is performing the last rites in Pentonville Prison, have hope my son, he concludes. But there is no reprieve for poor Arthur Donald (John Stratton).\n\nHowever this man of God is absolutely convinced Donald is not guilty. I know when a man speaks the truth, he tells the governor (Robert Raglan), who is man enough to phone the Home Secretary to grant a temporary stay of execution.\n\nCharlie Chan is asked by the priest as a matter of urgency, to find out the truth. Cancelling his flight to America- he never does return there in this series- he commences his inquiries with old friend Inspector Marlowe (Hugh Williams), who refuses to countenance any error by the police. The case is quite simple: night of March 3rd- Dr Roy Beechs body found in a burning car on Hampstead Heath. Previously, he been clubbed to death. Next morning, Donald, Beechs chauffeur and handyman had been arrested outside nearby Chalk Farm underground, carrying a stack of cash. In Donalds East End room was found the murder weapon and clothing with the doctors bloodstains.\n\nThe doctors widow Marilyn (Mary Laura Wood) explains that her wonderful husband had picked Donald up from an East End Mission Hall and this man had worked very satisfactorily for Dr Beech for the past six months. I could believe Arthur would have done it, she adds, because he had been attracted to her.\n\nAt the mission hall, the vicar there believes Donald isnt a killer. Charlie concurs, having endured the difficulties of subway (ie underground) travel. Why would Donald travel all the way to the East End with the murder weapon, leave it in his room, and then return all the way to Chalk Farm?\n\nWhen Charlie tackles Donald about this, as he languishes in jail, he starts by being antagonistic. He says he hadnt seen a lot of the extravagant Mrs Beech, shes old enough to be my mother. So why is she lying?\n\nThe solution Charlie discovers in the doctors blood group. Donald is certain he was group AB, but O was the victims group. So the corpse is an imposter. Karl Bonner was Mrs Beechs half-brother. Hes allegedly away on holiday abroad in Spain. Or is he?\n\nCharlie goes to Highgate Cemetry to examine the mausoleum where Dr Beech is supposed to have been interred. However he is interrupted in his exploration by Mrs Beech, accompanied by her very-much-alive husband. Its Karl who lies there dead. It was all an insurance swindle. Inspector Marlowe appears by magic and laps it all up, and makes his arrest.\n\nYoure a marvel, he tells Charlie, as he phones through Arthur Donalds reprieve\n\nUncredited speaking part: Passport officer\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Sweater\n\nShots of Charlie Chan standing on a bridge over an Amersterdam canal. He walks to a fashion show to purchase a sweater for his daughter, and here he meets an acquaintance from Honolulu, Verna Martin. She has just purchased an exclusive powder-blue bejewelled sweater, made by the celebrated Dirk (Conrad Phillips). However the owner of the salon Anton van Doren has sold it to her in error, for it had been commissioned by the Contessa, who is naturally very angry when she cannot have her sweater. She offers to buy it from Mrs Martin, but her request is rejected.\n\nVerna is found murdered. Inspector van der Reyden and Charlie comfort her husband Dick, who had been quarrelling with her over her friendship Bob in London, \"I don't intend to lose you ever again.\" So he is definitely one suspect. But the sweater is missing, so is the Contessa.\n\nVan Doren is sure it's she who must have killed Mrs Martin, for Dirk's sweaters are indeed unique and desirable. Charlie sees Dirk creating a new sweater similar to the missing one. \"Where would first sweater be now?\" is Charlie's pertinent question.\n\nThe answer is with the Contessa. Charlie finds her packing to sail to America, but she claims Mrs Martin had sold her the sweater providing she agreed to pay Dirk to make a second one.\n\nOn a boat tour round Amsterdam, Charlie is nearly knifed. Clearly someone is worried Charlie is getting close to the truth! Diamond smuggling is behind the killing, Charlie theorises, \"what would be more simple than respectable notable dressmaker and social celebrity Contessa together going into diamond smuggling?\"\n\nVan der Reyden and Charlie stop the Contessa leaving, and Dirk is there with her. However surprisingly the sweater is concealing no diamonds. Apologies all round, the detectives exit shamefaced. But when she boards the liner Charlie \"takes possession\" of the sweater, which had been concealed successfully earlier, and the police now have all the evidence they need. But the Contessa is no murderer, declares Charlie.\n\nSo Charlie has one \"sad duty\" to perform, that is to arrest Verna's killer. After an exchange of gunshots, the case is closed\n\nNote: the two location scenes above are all that remain of the unit's filming in Holland\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThree Men on a Raft\n\nMemory of Terror by Tony Hathaway (Raymond Huntley) is being launched at a bookshop, with the author signing copies. Charlie who says he's on his way to Paris, is at the shop to purchase a rare edition of Don Quixote, when he notices a young lad point a gun at Hathaway, \"loaded gun and angry boy very bad companions.\" Ronnie Ramsden is so worked up because he believes the writer has slandered his late father. Though Charlie prevents him shooting, Ronnie runs away straight into the path of a car.\n\nAt the Mercy Hospital he seems to have lost the will to live, so Charlie promises Norma his mother (Maxine Audley) that he will look into Hathaway's allegations in his book- these are that Captain Ramsden acted like a coward when he, Hathaway and a Chinese steward had been marooned for many days on a raft.\n\nMcDowall, Hathaway's publisher takes Charlie to the India Docks to meet this servant, but it's too late, for from Mrs Dawkins the landlady they learn he \"kicked the bucket\" six months ago. Later however, the wily Charlie obtains a notebook belonging to this Chinese and uses it as a bluff. Disguised as the Chinaman's uncle, he tells Hathaway this notebook is a quite different account of events on that raft. (That's certainly no lie, for it's actually a cookery book written in Chinese.) Hathaway produces £100 for the book. Charlie declines.\n\nThen Norma Ramsden has a surprising request to Charlie, \"I want you to drop the case.\" She's very uncommunicative only warning \"the truth might be as great a shock for Ronnie as that book of Hathaway's.\"\n\nAt the India Docks, after being attacked unsuccessfully en route, the 'uncle' waits results with Mrs Dawkins his witness, \"very difficult to know how many flies this fly paper will catch.\" The \"first gent\" offers £200- it's Hathaway, improving his earlier price. Then it's Norma, it's clear she used to be a little too friendly with our author! They start arguing over how Captain Ramsden was killed on that raft as McDowall enters, to \"stop my client making a fool of himself.\" The last to come is Sir Arthur Ruggles, Norma's new fiance (Ernest Clark), who also offers cash.\n\n\"Great heavens- it's Charlie Chan!\" For Chan has now removed his disguise and is able to force Hathaway to sign a prepared statement that Memory Of Terror is not fact at all, but pure fiction. Charlie then reveals the feared volume is but a cook book, \"but like empty gun, brought out the truth.\"\n\nOn Waterloo Bridge, the recovered Ronnie thanks Charlie and hands him his agreed fee of £3, though with sleight of hand, the beneficient oriental returns it to the boy's pocket. The grateful Ronnie promises to supply some more clients for \"a pretty good detective.\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Bookseller. 2 Doctor. 3 Hathaway's servant. 4 Nurse. 5 Crook who attacks Charlie\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNo Holiday for Murder\n\nA pleasing little story. Arriving on a Sabena flight in Brussels are Charlie and Barry Chan. They take a large taxi to the Plaza hotel where, in the foyer, Barry notices a letter, just dropped on the floor, and asks a newly arrived group of tourists if it belongs to any of them.\n\nProfessor Ambrose (Alan Wheatley) is in charge of this group. Does the letter belong to \"blustering\" Mrs Remington, or her companion Marianne Edwards (Betty McDowall)? Or maybe it's boxer Max's, or \"potential juvenile delinquent\" Sharon's? None claims it, not surprising really as the envelope is addressed to a Mr Joseph Grady No7190 Sing Sing Prison, New York. For sure, nobody likes Mrs Remington, \"One of these days, I'll murder that dame,\" openly declares Max.\n\nOn the tour to the Congo Museum, Barry latches on to Sharon, Charlie tagging along with the group also. Prof Ambrose explains its delights, telling his group that Magellan discovered the Congo. That's incorrect points out the rather dumb looking Max. The prof stands corrected. Mrs Remington becomes very obnoxious when Max tells everyone more about the gorillas there. She insists Marianne go with her to see the diamonds, mainly so she can't see any more of Max. While Charlie is admiring a stuffed gorilla in the foyer, there's a scream and Mrs Remington dramatically topples down the wide staircase. \"She is dead,\" pronounces Charlie, but not before she has whispered to Charlie that she had been pushed.\n\nThe police question the group, and secrets inevitably emerge. Marianne had recently been discharged from a mental home, and since she had been so obviously persecuted by her employer, she's the no1 suspect. But Charlie finds another possible motive, for a $10,000 jewel has been stolen from Mrs Remington's handbag. Now Barry pipes in with his solution. That Sing Sing letter is the key. Max confesses that it is his, and that he's the killer. But even Barry doesn't swallow that story, he's covering up for Marianne as he's \"crazy\" over her.\n\nCharlie phones the USA about his own suspect; but which person is he phoning about? He teases Barry with this conundrum.\n\nWhile he does so, that particular suspect is convincing Marianne that she is still \"tragically sick\" and cannot recall killing her employer, even though she did. Jump off the bridge and end it all seems a nice solution. But she does know that she isn't guilty and she has to be pushed. Just in time, Charlie and the police stop another tragedy.\n\nTo No1 Son Charlie explains the background to the case as Marianne smiles again. \"My son,\" Charlie concludes, \"I must tell you about the birds and the bees.\"\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Hotel receptionist. 2 Waiter. 3 Posh Tourist. 4 Second tourist. 5 Museum Guard\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNo Future for Frederick\n\nOnly a brief part, sorry to say, for Derrick de Marney as a theatrical impresario and ladies' man, who is warned by a palmist that he \"has many enemies... you have no future.\"\n\nAlso in this distinguished cast is Hugh Williams as Inspector Marlowe who has offered to introduce Charlie Chan to this \"idol of the London theatre.\" But backstage, there are opening night jitters as the overbearing Frederick berates \"incompetent fool\" Beck the stage manager. Margaret Archer, his leading lady and ex-lover, also receives his acid tongue: \"I could kill you for that.\" Peter Vane is angry because his \"big scene\" in Act Two has been cut since Frederick finds it \"dull.\" Even long serving dresser Bendall is in trouble, for Frederick hasn't any of his tablets, and Bendall is sent to the chemist as a matter of urgency. \"You enjoy crucifying people, he's told.\"\n\nSo when Frederick's body is found in his dressing room, it's hardly a surprise. Everyone had a \"desire\" to kill him, notes Charlie, though most curious, is the weird make-up that the corpse has been daubed with. There Charlie reconstructs the crime alone, but then oddly agrees with Dr Moore that death was a result of a heart attack. The inspector breathes a sigh of relief, commenting to Charlie \"it's not often a case of murder turns out to be a case of natural death.\" But Charlie is still sure it's murder, and learns that Frederick's pills contain digitalis, a heart stimulant. But another bottle has a lethal dosage prescribed. As Inspector Marlowe stands by uselessly, Charlie explains the killer's motive. It involves a lot of 'supposing,' based on the fact that Mrs Stella Moore was yet another of Frederick's lovers. She too had been cast aside, \"he deserved to die.\"\n\nA bemused inspector listens as Charlie explains how he solved the case\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Palmist Madame Clara (Anita Sharp-Bolster). 2 Waiter. 3 Doorman. 4 Vane, an actor with \"no talent.\" 5 Call boy. 6 Police constable. 7 Chemist\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSafe Deposit\n\nA courier is knocked out with a judo cut and robbed of his case just outside Finlay's Bank. It had just been filled with banknotes, over £20,000 for the Allied Dairies payroll. In a neat switch, the thief bumps into Barry Chan who is innocently walking down the street.\n\n\"Pop, tell them I didn't do anything,\" protests No1 Son to dad, who is discussing this latest in a line of robberies with Inspector Marlowe (Hugh Williams). The man who shoved the decoy case into Barry's hands to try and create a diversion is identified as Bill Shaw from Shoreditch. Charlie interviews his dad.\n\n\"Why did Bill do this?\" his puzzled parent (Jerrold Wells) asks. For Bill is a fulfilled lad, who spends most of his time at the local boys' club, run by ex-Commando Colonel Arthur Ross. At the mission hall, the vicar admits to Charlie that Bill is \"no angel,\" though one of the volunteer helpers, James Collins, manager of the Finlay's Bank, is very surprised that Bill should have so gone off the rails.\n\nIt's No1 Son for once, who makes a breakthrough in the case when his inquiries reveal that Col Ross died five years ago. Is his club a School for Crime, \"like in Oliver Twist?\" Charlie neatly obtains the bogus colonel's fingerprints to find out if he is known to police.\n\nIn Brixton Prison, Barry tries to persuade Bill to talk. But he won't. Then outside the gates, Barry is knocked out, and police arrest him on suspicion of being drunk! Unfortunate, for he's supposed to be trailing Bill, who is released from jail on Charlie's say-so, in the hope that he'll lead police to the bogus colonel.\n\nBill does do just that, but finds Col Ross strangled. As Bill is standing by the body, he's rearrested. But Charlie proves the killing must have been done by a black belt judo expert.\n\n\"Who would suspect.....?\" Charlie addreses the killer, in an unusual scene, one-to-one, not the usual gathering of suspects. The reason becomes obvious, as the criminal tries his judo on Charlie also, but Charlie proves he's pretty adept at the oriental art also. Well, he would be, wouldn't he?\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1&2&3 policemen. 4 policeman Johnson. 5 Manager of boxes at bank\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nVoodoo Death\n\nRich Joseph Temple is receiving his morning shave from servant Bartou. Branding him \"a sullen brute\" while he wields a cut throat razor is asking for trouble! But why is Bartou collecting his master's hair clippings? Voodoo- \"filthy nonsense!\"\n\nAnn Temple (Ann Sears) is at loggerheads with her father over her intended, Michael Ross, whom Mr Temple unpleasantly brands \"a fortune hunting parasite.\"\n\nIt's a weekend house party, others of the \"mixed bag\" of guests being Payne, who has just discovered a rich uranium mine in Honduras, and Temple's nephew, Harry Carr, Payne's assistant. Temple undertakes to purchase Payne's share in the mine and donate it to Harry.\n\nTo the assembled group, which also includes Charlie Chan and No1 Son, Michael Ross announces his engagement to Ann. Temple's grim response is that he will be consulting his lawyer in the morning to cut her out of his will. We are hardly surprised therefore when Temple is found with a fractured skull next morn.\n\nMurder \"with the usual blunt instrument,\" declares the police inspector (Trevor Reid, on top form). It's \"an open and shut case,\" he confidently declares, as Bartou had been \"pushed too far.\" Barry concurs, \"the inspector has got the case sewn up.\" And indeed he must have, for Bartou himself confesses, \"My magic killed him.\"\n\nBut so many changes of mind by the bewildered inspector are a joy to behold, as Charlie explains that this Bartou has voodoo death fetishes in his room, and that's what he means by his words. So the \"dejected\" inspector has to admit his \"bubble\" has burst.\n\nNo1 Son however has his own theory. He had heard Michael Ross argung with Temple the previous night, though Michael claims, \"the man was alive when I left him.\"\n\nThe solution lies in a cablegram that Temple had recently received, \"the mine faked.\" \"Notes Barry, \"there's your motive, pop.\" And the inspector eagerly snatches at this latest idea, \"he's our man all right.\"\n\nBut Charlie also wants to question \"wildcat\" Ann, who clearly never liked her father. The inspector follows this new tack happily, \"could be the type to hit you over the head as soon as look at you.\"\n\nSo many suspects, they're all guilty! Charlie summons them all at midnight in a dramatic finale. Bartou's \"art of finding the guilty one by voodoo\" is Charlie's method for flushing out the killer. Lights are switched off. Drums roll. Bartou enters, in a costume enough to frighten anyone. This forces the confession, \"he always despised me.\" Concludes our hapless policeman, not for the first time, \"yes he's our man all right.\"\n\nThe guilty one is arrested and Bartou is thanked, Charlie presenting him with a recording of voodoo\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Expatriate\n\nAmerican racketeer Nate Peliter (Alan Gifford) is searching for his long lost daughter Ellen. Actually she on the verge of marrying an English lord. The couple are set to be very happy together, but there's something to mar that happiness. The man she believes to be her father, Herbert, cannot permit her to marry Henry. \"I'm sorry darling but I must.... I can stop it.\" He won't say why, but we know he's only trying to shield her from her past.\n\nNow Charlie happens to be staying (\"for pleasure\") in the same hotel as Ellen, room 719, when is heard \"unmistakeable sound of pistol shot.\" Herbert has been shot in the lift. \"Operation to his brain\" required, so he's taken to Queen's Hospital.\n\nThe police inspector (Russell Napier this time) questions Ellen, Charlie holding a watching brief. She does admit she'd fallen out with Herbert over her forthcoming marriage. \"I didn't shoot him.\" Lisa Blanchard (Delphi Lawrence), Herbert's legal partner demands to see her boss, but as he's undergoing a brain operation, that is scarcely possible.\n\nEnter the racketeer, (\"long time no see\" is Charlie's greeting, for he had put him away years back) and the crook confesses to shooting Herbert who had been blackmailing him. Herbert, he explains, \"bled me white,\" blackmailing him over his prison record. Charlie isn't convinced by this confession, nor by the inspector's desire to arrest Ellen.\n\nNo1 Son, who has been very quiet in this story up till now, tells the inspector the gun used in the shooting was Lisa's. \"It's obviously that Blanchard dame,\" declares the confident Barry, \"don't you agree?\" Charlie looks dubious, \"someone must have stolen it.\" For he has worked out what Ellen still doesn't know, that Herbert isn't her natural father. Herbert's dowdy wife tells Charlie the whole story, in return for which Charlie gets her in to see her ailing husband.\n\nIn a hospital private room, she talks to her severely bandaged spouse. A pillow smothers him, \"you mustn't wake up ever.\" Charlie steps in promptly to prevent murder. Behind the bandages is hidden only No1 Son. She explains why she was trying to kill her husband, he had been having an affair with Lisa. Anyway that's over now, for the naughty Herbert has died.\n\nAll very sad, but here's a happy ending with Ellen marrying Henry. Charlie toasts their health, and Ellen's natural father joins in. She thanks her real daddy.... aaah!\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Benny. 2 Henry (Frederick Jaeger). 3 Bellboy. 4 Hotel receptionist. 5 Doctor. 6 Nurse\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAirport Murder Case\n\nOutside a railway station in Rome, off the train from Paris where she had been buying furs, a girl is shot dead. \"I need your help,\" Charlie is asked by Dino Rienzi (Raymond Young) to find the killer of his ex-girl friend American singer Joan March.\n\nCharlie is really here on holiday, so Barry enthusiastically takes on the case, Charlie with his old fashioned methods, agreeing to assist!\n\nNo1 Son's first job, using the skills learned from Prof Soderheim, is to question Charlie's old friend Inspector Galvani. He confidently tells his dad, \"I'll let him make the arrest after I solve the case!\" Galvani is currently rather busy getting \"nowhere fast\" on a case of a leakage of information from a top secret reactor plant, but listens patiently to Barry.\n\nCharlie, meanwhile, is at the Arcadian Club where Miss March sang. He learns Rienzi had been in love with Joan, but had recently fallen for a \"rich and very beautiful\" American widow Carol Vane (Kay Callard). This Carol admits she's hoping to marry Dino soon. She'd never met this Joan.\n\nDino confirms all this, and admits he had been still seeing Joan, but then his chat with Charlie is interrupted by Galvani, Barry in tow. They are searching for Dino's gun. \"This gun has been fired very recently.\" He's arrested. \"I didn't do it,\" protests No1 Son's client.\n\nCharlie notes there are no prints on the gun, whilst conceding \"you have a very good case, inspector.\" But he isn't convinced, and questions Carol again. She admits she did know Joan, who had tried to warn her off Dino, who, she claimed, was only after her for her money. But it seems Carol didn't care Dino was penniless.\n\nJoan's source of wealth seems the key to the case. She hadn't earned that much at the \"crummy club,\" so what was the source of her income? She had quipped about finding her fortune in a \"lobster\" and it so happens she had a friend who was a fisherman, and he just happens to fish off the shores near the reactor plant. Clearly blackmail.\n\nAt 2am Charlie breaks into the Arcadian Club and finds the ejected cartridge from the murder weapon (why it was there who knows?). Lobsters are there in plenty too, for it's the headquarters of a gang of spies. Joan had stumbled on the secret and had been blackmailing the owner. Charlie fights the traitors and handcuffs them. \"The case is over.\" I don't think Barry quite solved that one.\n\nNote: The title Airport Murder Case is clearly wrong, as we see Joan at the start emerging from a train station. However as the episode title is not seen on screen, perhaps this title was given to the story later by some ignorant assistant\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Hand of Hera Dass\n\nAt the Hotel Negresgo in Nice, Monsieur Dubois negotiates with Charlie over collecting a package in Cairo from one Ali.\n\n\"What's the gimmick?\" asks the straightforward No1 Son.\n\n\"There are certain things I cannot tell you,\" replies Dubois, though Charlie is not going to act as any messenger boy. So Dubois comes clean, it will avert a tribal conflict in the Near East.\n\n\"Wow, what's in the package?\" blurts Barry, \"an H bomb?!\" Not quite, it's the golden hand of Hera Dass. Dubois must have it at precisely 8pm this Wednesday, or it could mean War.\n\nAt the Hotel Continentale in Cairo, it's very very hot. Ali brings The Hand. \"He sure looked nervous,\" notes Barry, who is on form today. Next minute we know why. Ali is stabbed in back, his dying words are get Akim.\n\nClose on this drama, into their room comes a veiled lady, Yasmin (Eunice Gayson). She warns that one-eyed Ahmed (Martin Benson) is after The Hand. Barry escorts her home, and is rewarded with a kiss, \"gosh.\" But he notices her leave home immediately, and he follows her to an assignation with a one eyed man. Then Barry is attacked, of course, and left unconscious, his two assailants make straight for his hotel room to search it.\n\nThen another visitor, this time an elderly gent who talks in pithy sayings like the great detective. He also wants The Hand, claiming it had been stolen from him yesterday. Charlie is unsure whether he is yet another fake on the make.\n\nYasmin is the next in this procession to their room. She had received this note from Ahmed and had gone to talk to him, as Barry knows, and she is worried Ahmed will kill them. \"Give me that hand now,\" she unsurprisingly concludes.\n\nA final interruption! This time it's Ahmed and his cronies. He wants, you guessed it, The Hand. Name your own price. All Charlie wants is the name of Ali's killer. Easy, responds Ahmed, it was Yasmin. She draws a knife, but the police make a belated appearance to cart all the villains off.\n\nBack in Nice ahead of schedule, Dubois is handed the Golden Hand. But Charlie accuses Dubois, \"you were the assassin.\"\n\n\"You are out of your senses.\" But of course Charlie is not, as he hands The Hand to its rightful owner, the elderly bloke, naturally in good time to avert tribal war\n\nUncredited speaking part: Haroun Ali\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nChippendale Racket\n\nAmerican Tom Steele is an acquaintance of Charlie's from his Honolulu days. He buys a pair of antique candelabras, date c1750, for £2,000.\n\nWhat do you think of them?\n\nThey're beautiful, declares No1 Son.\n\nNot quite, declares Charlie, for they are fakes.\n\nThey return to Winkleman the vendor who assures them the provenance is excellent, for they had belonged to Lady Laura Abbot. He seeks the opinion of an expert in Georgian silver, Cecil Meadows, who however declares them not genuine, a clever copy.\n\nWinkleman summons John Carstairs, his assistant. The explanation is given that Carstairs had, at Laura Abbots request, made copies for her of what she was selling, and that these copies had been sold in error.\n\nTheres something fishy about this deal, notes Barry wisely, and he drives his sports car to Lady Abbots, where he overhears Lady Abbots plot with Winkleman and Carstairs, who turns out to be her wastrel brother. The conversation betwixt brother and sister is poorly scripted, and comes across as badly acted.\n\nBarry is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, the butler has caught him \"red handed,\" accusing him of murdering Lady Abbot! Thankfully Charlie is able to persuade Inspector Duff that No1 Son is innocent.\n\nIn Winklemans shop, Charlie finds the owner burning his sales ledger, which Charlie rescues from the stove.\n\nPut that down, Chan. But Inspector Duffer steps in to examine the ledger.\n\nOnly fraud charge, declares Charlie, for he knows Winkleman is not Lady Abbots killer.\n\nAll Lady Abbots genuine antiques are discovered in Carstairs rooms, \"how did you know pop?\" These candelabras are the genuine ones, Meadows declares, and are handed to Tom. However its not Carstairs who is arrested for murder either. A clever piece of bluff from Charlie exposes the real killer.\n\nI dont get it pop, complains No1 Son, to whom Charlie reveals all, and adds a nice joke about Barry.\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Martha Steele (Stella Bonheur). 2 Carstairs\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Invalid\n\nA well written story directed by Don Chaffey, with a strong cast.\n\n\"You've had this coming for a long time!\" shouts a girl as she shoots Charlie Chan himself. Chan collapses writhing on the ground. But he's only acting in a film, in which he is technical adviser. \"You should be in front of the camera,\" congratulates the director Pietro Pinero (Robert Arden).\n\nHe is one admirer of the girl, the star Sybil Adams (Joan Rice), her other \"lovesick rival\" being producer Howard Richards (Basil Dignam). It's the latter who asks Charlie to find Sybil, when she suddenly runs away.\n\nIn her dressing room, No1 Son finds a bouquet of flowers from Pinero, and constructs his elaborate theory to prove he is behind it. Then he is distracted by her see through negligee, while Charlie pores over an advertisement for an invalid carriage. Some questions from the shop selling such aids, and he learns one Don McGruder (Philip Friend) of Ivy Cottage Lovat Green has just been bought one, DAP726.\n\nWith Barry posing in a wheelchair, Charlie approaches Don. \"If you have come here to snoop...\" Don warns, holding one of his many rifles. But Charlie is only inquiring after invalid carriages, though Barry's imposture is soon revealed, when a gunshot makes him jump clean out of his chair. But they soon find Sybil there, she's secretly married Don, secretly because \"who'd be interested in a star who was tied to a wreck like me?\" No, in the public eye, \"love and wheelchairs don't go together.\"\n\nSomeone shoots at Don, but misses. \"Could be attempted murder,\" pronounces Charlie, rather obviously. So Inspector Duff is phoned. He questions everyone and from the housekeeper Mrs Frost, who obviously despises Don, we learn that Don had once been a fine actor, but was paralysed after rescuing Sybil from a fire, \"he uses his paralysis as a whip.\"\n\nFilming recommences, Sybil rehearses a scene with Cary Norton (William Lucas). Her prop gun fails to make any noise, so the watching Don mends the bent firing pin. Scene 30 take 2. This time the gun with the blank goes off, however the bullet is real! Pinero is hit in the shoulder.\n\nCharlie evolves a plan, persuading Sybil to start a row on the set, and storm off. Charlie then produces a friend's lucrative film contract for Don and Sybil in which he could reprise his part as a Mandarin, \"my most successful theatre role.\" But Don has to decline since he cannot walk.\n\n\"If only I could,\" he repeats. He tries but doesn't quite stay on his feet. Sybil tells Don she's suing for divorce so she can take up the contract, and Cary puts himself forward.\n\n\"You can't,\" claims Mrs Frost, for she had watched Cary earlier shooting at Don. She had kept silent as she hates Don. Motive: Cary is yet another admirer of Sybil.\n\nBut all this charade was part of Charlie's plan, so there's a happy ending as a desperate Don really attempts to walk again. Wow, he does!\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Inspector Duff (Rupert Davies). 2 Wheelchair salesman. 3 Props man\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMan in the Wall (aka Skeleton in Armour)\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMan of A 100 Faces\n\n\"That guy could not fool me for one minute,\" boasts No1 Son to dad and Inspector Rietti, who are watching the stage act of that master of disguise, Pietro Monti (Alan Wheatley), known as The Man of a Hundred Faces. But look, here comes Pietro wandering around the audience dressed as an old flower seller, to prove Barry wrong. Yes, it's back to the books for poor No1 Son, and a thorough reread of his favourite textbook by Wolfgang Sodorheim. \"No astute student of criminology can possibly be fooled by a disguise, no matter how clever it is.\"\n\nNearly 70,000,000 lire-worth of jewels have just been stolen by Vincente Donati (Eric Pohlmann) with the help of this same Monti, wearing his crooked face.\n\nBut next day, Charlie and Barry meet Pietro again, disguised as the gondolier escorting our tourists round Venice. He asks Charlie for help, he claims he's being forced to use his mastery of disguise by the villainous Donati to commit robberies, because his brother Vittorio had been found out by Vincente, passing forged cheques.\n\nCharlie takes on the case and, in a district of \"very doubtful appeal,\" offers Donati 15,000 dollars for a share in his export business. Donati accepts but seems suspicious of Charlie's motives. And even No1 Son can see Donati wouldn't agree a partnership with a famous detective, \"unless he has something up his sleeve.\" So Barry expects honourable dad to be \"bumped off,\" though not so dramatically as he thinks with a bullet, but in the food, as a waiter at the Hotel de Medici brings them their lunch. Yes, it's Pietro Monti as usual, now as a balding waiter, who warns the pair that Donati is going to rob the Count de Venci tomorrow at 10.30am of his $200,000 painting Virgin and Child. Adds Monti, \"I shall be disguised as a curator.\"\n\nThen Donati phones Charlie who feigns poisoning. While Donati gloats at the other end of the line, Barry panics, until he realises it's all an act.\n\nPapers announce the tragedy, so Donati, believing Charlie is safely off the scene, arrives at the Count's palace with a curator in tow. Charlie and Inspector Rietti are waiting and all are arrested, except for the curator.\n\nBut Charlie exposes the deeper plot. This painting is a fake, it's part of Monti's plan to get the rest of his gang arrested, whilst he clears off with the genuine painting. The Count is horrified to find his painting has been switched and helps the search for the curator who has disappeared. But there's one last ingenious twist, the count is actually Monti in disguise and Charlie is now able to clear the case up, \"you've played your last masquerade, Monti!\"\n\nBut, asks No1 Son, how on earth did Charlie spot his disguise? Charlie refers back to the immortal Sodorheim.\n\nUncredited speaking roles: 1 Shop assistant. 2 Inspector Rietti\n\nChan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPoint of No Return\n\nNo1 Son has suddenly left Venice for Paris, where Charlie explains he is studying French culture. We never see him again. Surely this is a case for the police?\n\nAt the Venice casino, Charlie is watching John Benson (John McClaren) who is losing. \"Winning can be a bore,\" is his novel response. But as he's a millionaire, he can afford to be blase; he's also a keen skin diver, and a man with a beautiful wife. Alice (Jeanette Sterke) is in love with a local doctor, Paul Durant. \"Keep away from my wife,\" is the warning Benson gives him. \"I'd do anything to be free of John,\" sighs Alice.\n\nCharlie is positive he's seen Benson before, he's Arthur Whalen, a swindler wanted by the Californian police. Inspector Bonini follows Charlie's tip-off and boards his gondola to arrest Benson alias Whalen, but he's dead. His clothing has been discovered on the beach, his aqualung poisoned with cyanide.\n\nHis solicitor Henry Winslow (Cyril Chamberlain) is the sole beneficiary of Benson's new will, which had been drawn up the previous evening, under Benson's conviction that his wife and her lover were planning to kill him.\n\nExploring the beach, Charlie finds the solution to this case, which is \"not so simple\" as the inspector had believed. For the corpse has not yet been washed ashore. However Bonini learns Alice had recently purchased some cyanide, she claiming her husband had asked her to, and she is under arrest. But for Charlie, such an action is too \"indiscreet\" if she were the killer.\n\nWinslow is toasting his new found fortune. However Charlie throws a spoke into his happiness by pointing out the estate is not legally bound to pay out in the absence of any body. \"That is the law here.\"\n\nThis draws Winslow to fall for Charlie's \"long shot\" as he speeds by gondola (the gondolier dressed the same as the Man with 100 Faces, #33), whilst Charlie and the inspector tail him. Winslow goes straight to Benson, and tries to throttle him, in an attempted double cross. But Charlie prevents Benson's death who is then arrested.\n\nWhat had excited Charlie's suspicion? Simple really. You see, the position of the aqualung on the shore was well above the waterline. Ah so.\n\nUncredited speaking part: Telephonist\n\nTo the Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nA Bowl by Cellini\n\nThis is rather different from the usual Chan story, containing a nice portrait of a bumbling tourist.\n\nArchibald Meaker is in Rome, but how unfortunate that he's forgotten that today, Friday the 13th, is his 25th wedding anniversary. How fortunate that he has bumped into a salesman who offers him an \"exquisite\" silver bowl! After haggling (\"mio molto broko\"), a price of 20,000 lire is agreed.\n\nIt's disappointment for downtrodden Archibald, when his \"rather dictatorial\" wife Martha tells him it \"belongs in a junkyard,\" and insists he gets his money back. Since he can't find the salesman, he takes it to a jeweller and is shocked when he's offered 800,000 lire for it.\n\nIt just happens that Charlie is in the shop at the same time, and offers to help Archibald trace the original seller. After a tour of Rome, they do find where the man came from, but the house is actually owned by wealthy Roberto Ricci (Martin Benson), who doesn't know, he says, about this salesman. However we learn that Archibald has accidentally been sold a genuine silver bowl instead of one of the numerous reproductions Ricci keeps in his home, to sell to unsuspecting tourists.\n\nAt the National Museum, it is confirmed to Charlie that the bowl is a genuine one by Cellini. But the innocent Archibald is then duped by one Count Veschi, who admires the bowl, \"you are a very fortunate man,\" he tells Archibald. He switches the bowl for a fake.\n\nPolice are able, from the description of this so-called count, to identify him. He's another swindler, and when they catch up wth him, he has been strangled. Of course the genuine bowl is nowhere to be seen.\n\nCharlie and the police know where to find it- at Ricci's. He's not at home, but that salesman is, and he shows them a cabinet containing an \"amazing collection\" of fake Cellinis. Ricci interrupts them, brandishing a gun. A swift move by Charlie, and he's under arrest.\n\nArchibald is now reunited with his valuable bowl. Despite all this, there's a nice touch, as Martha cannot appreciate it, \"it still looks like junk to me.\"\n\nRichard Goolden has a splendid part as the bumbling Meaker.

The receptionist Vittorio (Alan Tilvern) shows them to their rooms, she's in 16, he in 47. But she is baffled when Vittorio later states that he's never even met her father. Where is he?\n\nFrantic, she finds Charlie Chan in the Hotel Florino. He had helped her father before, and smells a rat, knowing the professor is working on a top secret ultrasonics project. Charlie moves into room 16, his first task is to talk to that receptionist.\n\nHe finds Vittorio's Polish wife, Roxanne, who is living in luxurious premises: \"very beautiful new television set costing much money,\" notes Charlie. She's about to reveal something vitally important when in walks her husband.\n\n\"Me, I do not like police,\" he states, and tries to knife Charlie, who however gives him a judo clip. Charlie has arranged to meet Roxanne near the Forum, and as he clambers around the ruins he's attacked. That is repulsed but then he stumbles on a corpse. It's poor Roxanne. On a piece of paper he finds the numbers 876.500.\n\nIt's a phone number, and police chief Inspector Galvani discovers it's an exclusive private hospital for \"mad persons.\"\n\nThe receptionist there recognises Curtis' picture, he was patient Mr John Robertson, treated by a new doctor, who has \"a blonde beard.\" But the patient had died and his body taken away.\n\nInspector Galvani looks on nonplussed as Charlie examines Room 47 where the occupant Gastelli has just checked out. He's the man with the \"blonde beard.\" Charlie examines a notepad which has the impression of some words, the airport 11.30.\n\nWith the useless inspector, Charlie dashes to the funeral parlour to demand \"open the casket.\" Gasps Janet, \"Daddy!\" The good news is that Curtis is still breathing, but drugged. The blonde bearded doctor-crook is arrested.\n\nLater Janet is happily reunited with her father. Charlie explains the whole plot, all about smuggling Curtis to Poland. \"See you on the train for London,\" he concludes.\n\nGaffe: Charlie calls Janet \"Jane\" to the inspector.

She wants the conviction overturned.\n\n\"The evidence is pretty conclusive,\" The Duffer informs Charlie. He was found guilty of passing coded messages to the enemy, using his own typewriter. Charlie visits Bleinheim Huouse where Coslow worked during the war, with a secret unit run by Sir Aubrey, others in the group who go there are Maxwell Duggan, he had found the typewritten code, Miss Murdoch, secretary, in love with Coslow, and Cecil Barnes, perennial drunk. This last nearly causes a large painting to fall on top of Charlie.\n\nCharlie gets Linda to prove that the person who typed this coded emssage was a proficient typist, now her dad was no trained typist. Charlie asks to read some secret war documents, that name the person the Nazis intended to run Britain once their invasion succeeded. He forges such a document, typed by Linda.\n\nThen the unit reassembles for Charlie's \"little experiment.\" The sight of these papers makes the quisling snatch them in the dark and burn them. At gunpoint, Charlie exposes this traitor.\n\nCoslow thanks Charlie for his freedom, \"we shall always be in your debt.\" However, Charlie modestly declines fee, naturally\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Padre. 2 Warder. 3 Governor (Robert Raglan). 4 Quiz show host (Richard Waring)\n\nTo Chan Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThree For One\n\nAme's Treasure House (sic) has acquired a valuable collection of antique china. An interested purchaser is Stephen Cosgrove (Ronald Leigh-Hunt), who is wearing a patch over one eye, but he deliberately smashes a rare vase. He can offer no explanation for his out of character behvaiour, apologising to the salesman Peter Ross (Derek Bond) who happens to be a friend.\n\nThis seems almost like a proto-Avengers script, for this is only the latest in a line of acts of sabotage at the Treasure House. And all the attacks have been by friends of Ross.\n\nFirst there was Herbert Hodges, a taxidermist, who had ripped a Picasso. Then Doris Tillman (Delphi Lawrence) manager of the Hastings Grill, who had poured acid over tapestries. And now Cosgrove. All three cannot remember the damage they'd done or why they had done it.\n\nCharlie Chan perceives a plot to discredit Ross, but the only enemy he seems to have is Marilyn Marsh, whom he jilted when he met his present wife Betty, daughter of the owner of the Treasure House. But Marilyn is in a rest home at present, so it can't be her.\n\n\"Where am I?\" asks Colin Prentice, another pal of Ross. He becomes the fourth vandal, smashing an antique chair in the shop.\n\nA common link with all four is eye specialist Dr Sanders (Ernest Clark), who runs a consultancy in rooms above the Hastings Grill. And he had once been engaged to Betty before Peter Ross had come on the scene.\n\nSix o'clock is chiming when Charlie reports his findings to Ross, who draws a gun and shoots. Charlie ducks, knowing Ross has been put in some trance.\n\n\"I don't remember anything,\" claims Ross, adding \"who did it?\"\n\nAt the Hastings Grill, Charlie assembles all the vandals, as well as Ross and Dr Sanders, \"quite a party.\" Hastings, the owner, (Robert Cawdron) once The great Van Dusen, hynoptises Charlie. Charlie falls under his spell. He's only pretending of course, and thus the tables are turned. Hastings' motive: he is the sister of Marilyn whom Ross had jilted.\n\nSo the party can continue.\n\n\"To Charlie Chan!\" toasts Derek Bond.\n\n\"To a happy ending, Mr Chan\" declares Ernest Clark, as a fitting finale to this series.\n\nUncredited speaking parts: 1 Carl Prentice. 2 Dr Saunders' receptionist\n\nChan Menu"
