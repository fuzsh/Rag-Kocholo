Upon discovering the plot, Eve leaves Durand and joins an old family friend on a desert expedition in India. Later, fearing she will implicate him in her affairs, Eve deserts her friend and goes to San Francisco. Sir Frederic Bruce, of Scotland Yard, is attracted to the case by a mysterious pair of Chinese slippers found on the victim's body--a gift from the explorer, John Beetham. His investigation leads to a San Franciso lecture hall where Beetham is speaking, and there Durand is revealed to be the murderer and is killed by Bruce's lieutenant, Charlie Chan, in a shootout, leaving Eve to a happy future with the explorer.",

John Stone and Wilbur Morse led the work on the film.\n\nBehind the Curtain and the $5-million brand new Fox Theatre in San Francisco, CA, premiered together on the same Friday night, 28 June 1929, the 3 August 1929 Motion Picture News reported. \"Seats for the dedicatory performance went on sale one month in advance of the opening, scaling at $2, $3 and $5. Saturday, June 29th, the Fox opened on regular schedule with the same show at regular prices.\" Will Rogers emceed the gala affair, and many Hollywood stars showed up.\n\nBehind the Curtain was a \"solid hit\" when it opened at Broadway's Roxy Theatre in New York as part of a nearly two-and-a-half-hour show, according to the 6 July 1929 Motion Picture News. The 17 July 1929 Variety reported that it took in over $115,000 the first week, but then fell to $86,809 during the second.\n\nA Fox Movietone advertisement in the 7 July 1929 Film Daily boasted that the \"All Dialog Mystery Melodrama\" had \"perfect reproduction of natural outdoor sounds...[and] the speed and movement of a silent picture,\" thanks to Movietone's \"sound-on-film\" process.\n\nBehind That Curtain was the first film in Fox's long-running Charlie Chan series, as well as being the first all-dialogue Chan film, even though his role was small (the September 1929 Photoplay noted that he was \"reduced to a minor figure\"). Earl Derr Biggers' original novel was serialized in The Saturday Evening Post (31 Mar--5 May 1928). The novel also became the basis for the 1932 Fox production Charlie Chan's Chance, directed by John Blystone and starring Warner Oland (see entry). For additional information on other films featuring the Chinese detective, see the 1931 Fox production Charlie Chan Carries On, directed by Hamilton MacFadden and starring Warner Oland and Marguerite Churchill.\n\nLess"
