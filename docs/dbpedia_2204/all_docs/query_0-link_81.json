        "text": "I watched all the Warner Oland Chan movies some years ago and couldn't bring myself to start the Sidney Toler films, though I tried. He wasn't as kind, for one thing, and for another, when Oland died, Keye Luke also decided to not carry on as Number One Son. How to continue a popular franchise with none of your leads returning?\n\nCharlie Chan in Honolulu finally provides the answer, and it's a smart one. Taking place in Honolulu, Chan's home, allows us to start with scenes of him surrounded by his large family - all (excepting Toler) played by Asian American actors and actresses. Grace Lem is his wife, Philip Ahn appears as his son in-law. And then, when the…\n\nYour humble correspondent has confessed to a weakness for comedy-mysteries from the 30s and 40s, a consequence of having grown up seeing dozens of such on TV. While my favorite of this genre was the Falcon series, regardless of whether George Sanders or his bro Tom Conway was the star, I also liked the Charlie Chan films, regardless of whether Warner Oland or Sidney Toler was in the lead. Such films initiated my lifelong love of mysteries, though I didn’t actually read any crime novels until I was almost thirty.\n\nCharlie Chan in Honolulu is notable as Toler’s first appearance as Chan, following Oland’s death, and the first of Victor Sen Yung, as Jimmy Chan, aka Number Two Son, Keye…\n\nI'm a sucker for 1930 and 1940's detective films but the one film series that I avoided was the Charlie Chan one. The yellowface was a big turnoff for me but I finally broke down and watched my very first Charlie Chan film, thanks to the Criterion Channel and their \"Chinese in Hollywood\" documentary and film series as this film was included in their collection.\n\nFellow Letterboxd member, BrianNaas does an excellent job in his review in giving us the backstory of how Sydney Toler came to be Charlie Chan after Warner Oland died.\n\nThis was Toler's debut as Charlie Chan and for the most part, I enjoyed this film. I still found it very difficult to watch Toler as…\n\nPart of my Double Feature Challenge\n\nOn August 6, 1938, at age 57. the great Swedish actor who played Charlie Chan, Warner Oland, passed away of bronchial pneumonia. Incredibly, one of Fox Studio's earliest Chan series directors, John G. Blystone (\"Charlie Chan's Chance,\" 1932), also died at age 45 on the same day. That could very well have been the end of the franchise, but producer Darryl F. Zanuck was not about to let the popular money-maker disappear with a whimper. He bagan the search for a new Charlie Chan, considering all manner of actors.\n\nAmong the 34 potential players screen-tested and rejected were J. Edward Bromberg, Noah Beery Jr., Michael Visaroff and Leo Carillo. Also on the original shortlist…\n\nStrained but fascinating transitional Chan mystery, which introduces Sidney Toler in the titular role and (Victor) Sen Young as Jimmy, No.2 son. Toler offers an edgier, more sarcastic Chan than the warm-hearted, softly spoken Warner Oland. The Asian make-up is also more pronounced, so it is Chan-in-draft-form. The script introduces him at dinner at home with his family, which is a good strategy to attempt to humanise him. But Toler has a different rhythm to Oland to which the script and director are clearly trying to find the right approach. Playing it safe, the emphasis is on comedy and a bizarre supporting character, the phrenologist played by George Zucco, who appears to have missed his stop at Universal Studios. Sen…\n\nWarner Oland passed away in August 1938. He had been Charlie Chan in sixteen films and was enormously popular all over the world for that role. His drinking and the associated damage that did to his body did him in. In his last few films he had to be held up at times he was so drunk. At one point after Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo he walked away and said he would do no more Chan films. But the studio lured him back with a three picture deal. He had begun a film but he left after a few days of filming and told Fox that he needed a break. Fox started looking around for a replacement and had…\n\nH. Bruce Humberstone’s crime comedy horror in which Charlie’s son poses as his father in order to examine a murder. Starring Sidney Toler, Phyllis Brooks, Victor Sen Yung and Eddie Collins.\n\nThis entry in the Charlie Chan series is most notable for being the first appearance of Sidney Toler as the main man, with Victor Sen Yeung also making his first arrival as Charlie’s No.2 son Jimmy – and the final product is an enjoyable one.\n\nThe story concerns the Chinese sleuth (Sidney Toler) and his No. 2 son (Victor Sen Yung) who hold a boat in harbour to investigate an incident on board.\n\nSidney Toler gives a good performance in his role as the title character Charlie Chan, the…\n\nThe Warner Oland Charlie Chan era is over after Oland passed away a few months earlier in 1938, which starts the new era with Sidney Toler as the Oriental detective which would last the next 18 years until he too would die.\n\nI was a little worried how I'd take a new Charlie Chan, but even with Toler Charlie Chan is a blast! A lot of comedy in Toler's first installment. And his family is there to make a mess. No Keye Luke as his \"Number One Son\" Lee Chan. Instead we have Victor Sen Yung as James Chan, maybe his \"Number Two Son\"?! And also Layne Tom Jr. as his \"Number Five Son\" pops up on deck. So it's…"
