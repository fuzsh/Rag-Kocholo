Blue Ridge Christian School is a PreK – 12th grade college prep school. We are accredited by both Cognia and the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). Creativity, innovation, and curiosity are woven into every classroom as our teachers embrace methods that will lead to success in tomorrow’s workforce and mission field. Our high school's students can take part in a wide variety of dual-credit courses.

We provide an opportunity for our students to be part of the A+ program. This encourages our students to meet attendance requirements, volunteer, and make good grades in an effort to receive fully-funded scholarships to Missouri community colleges and vocational schools.
