        "text": "On October 3, 1980, just a month before his victory in the Presidential election, Ronald Reagan stopped in Lynchburg, Virginia, to address a convention of the National Religious Broadcasters, whose host was the Reverend Jerry Falwell, pastor of the Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg and the president of the Moral Majority. On arriving at the airport, Reagan said, in answer to a question, that he was “quite sure” God heard the prayers of Jews. At the convention, he told an audience of pastors, students, and Lynchburg citizens that he believed in the separation of church and state. He also said that he supported voluntary, nonsectarian prayer in the public schools. “I don’t think we should have ever expelled God from the classroom,” he told the cheering audience. Reagan’s statements received national news coverage, for there was then some uncertainty about his theological views. In mid-August, at a convention of evangelical pastors in Dallas, he had confessed to having grave doubts about the theory of evolution, and asserted that the Bible contained the answers to all of the world’s problems. At that time, he had condemned the use of the separation of church and state as a means of keeping religious values out of government.\n\nAbout a hundred members of the national press corps had arrived in Lynchburg two days before Reagan’s visit, in order to attend the whole of the religious broadcasters’ convention. They had hoped to be able to interview a number of the star television evangelists, but they were disappointed, for few of the stars showed up. Pat Robertson and Jim Bakker did not come, although they lived only a few counties away. Even Jerry Falwell was not much in evidence, because he had a son in the hospital and there was a concurrent meeting of the state chairmen of the Moral Majority to attend. Falwell did, however, hold a press conference, at which he denounced abortion, homosexuality, and pornography and called for increased American support to Israel and a stronger national defense. There was nothing much new in it: Falwell’s purpose was to assure the press that the Moral Majority was not a sinister organization with a “medieval mentality,” as some had alleged. The members of the press went away from the convention with the view that Reagan had moderated his theological position and Falwell had moderated his approach to politics.\n\nAbout a year before, the press had begun to report on a campaign, already under way, to mold conservative Christians into a political voting bloc. The leaders of the campaign—a number of political organizers for conservative causes and a number of television evangelists—claimed a constituency of fifty million Protestant evangelicals and thirty million “morally conservative” Catholics, as well as a few million Mormons and Orthodox Jews. The political organizers did not, in spite of their public statements, really expect to enlist this whole constituency or to create a Christian political party. What they expected was that a campaign focussed on such concerns as abortion, homosexuality, and the proposed Equal Rights Amendment might swing sufficient numbers of Catholics and Protestant evangelicals to change the normal voting patterns and the election results. And by October of 1980 their expectation seemed a reasonable one. The new organizations—the Moral Majority, the Christian Voice—had grown apace; pastors, working at a local level through the churches, had registered impressive numbers of new voters and had raised money and volunteers for conservative, and against liberal, candidates in a number of states. In Alaska, for example, Moral Majority members had packed the Republican caucuses, and so, at the state convention, Ronald Reagan won all nineteen of Alaska’s delegates to the National Convention; they had also campaigned successfully to secure the Republican senatorial nomination for the conservative Frank Murkowski. The Moral Majority had had similar victories in Alabama and Iowa. In many other states, the organizations of evangelicals, in combination with Right-to-Life groups and conservative political-action committees, had defeated liberals and nominated those on the right wing of their Party in the Republican primaries. In many states, the relative influence of these various groups was difficult to measure, because the secular and the religious organizations tended to support the same candidates and espouse the same goals. The main issues continued to be abortion and “the family,” but the secular conservative groups also spoke out for prayer in the schools, and the pastors increasingly spoke out on the defense and foreign-policy issues of the right, such as the SALT II and Panama Canal treaties.\n\nBy October, the question was whether this conservative alliance might actually come to dominate the Republican Party. The Republican platform embodied the views of the alliance on a number of issues, including abortion, school prayers, gun control, and the need for military superiority; the Party also dropped its past commitment to the E.R.A. Though the organizers had initially favored John Connally to win the Presidential nomination, Reagan had proved sympathetic to many of their causes. True, he had rejected their candidate for the Vice-Presidency, Senator Jesse Helms, and had chosen a running mate whom they had specifically opposed. But he had selected Robert Billings, the former executive director of the Moral Majority, as his liaison with the religious groups. And after the Convention he had taken a number of positions espoused almost exclusively by the pastors and other members of the alliance—such as the desirability of America’s reëstablishing an official relationship with Taiwan. His appearance at the convention of religious broadcasters in Lynchburg seemed to testify to his accord with the pastors—and to the influence of Jerry Falwell.\n\nFew journalists who visited Lynchburg for the convention had ever heard of Falwell until a few months before. That in itself was a curious fact, for by the summer of 1980 Falwell was well known to millions of Americans through the very media that many of the journalists themselves used: radio and television. On Sunday mornings, his religious television program, “The Old-Time Gospel Hour,” was broadcast on network affiliates and other VHF stations across the country; it was, according to Falwell, more widely distributed than the Johnny Carson show. Falwell was not the most popular evangelist on television, but he was one of a handful who in the nineteen-seventies had developed a nationwide audience and had been bringing in over thirty million dollars a year in contributions from that audience. As such, he was a part of a phenomenon.\n\nIn the nineteen-fifties and early sixties, most religious broadcasters on television were main-line clergymen—Catholics, Jews, and Protestants—who received free public-service air time. Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, and Rex Humbard had been on television since the nineteen-fifties, but by the nineteen-seventies a host of newcomers had taken over—men in their thirties and forties who created their own organizations to buy time on the air and acquired their own systems of distribution via satellite and cable networks. Many of them were charismatics, who preached the power of the Holy Spirit to heal and to work miracles; they tended to be fundamentalist and politically conservative. Along with the older evangelists, Pat Robertson, Jim Bakker, James Robison, Jerry Falwell, and others bought up most of the public-service time on Sunday-morning TV, pushing much of the main-line religious programming off the air and making television evangelism a big business for the first time. In the nineteen-seventies, the annual expenditure of TV ministries for air time went from around fifty million dollars to six hundred million; by the end of the decade, there were thirty religiously oriented TV stations, more than a thousand religious radio stations, and four religious networks—all of them supported by audience contributions.\n\nThe sudden and dramatic success of the so-called electric church resulted in part from changes within the media themselves. Television had begun as a highly centralized medium: the local stations were controlled by the networks, and the networks by Federal Communications Commission regulations. Because the F.C.C. demanded it, all stations had to allocate a certain amount of public-service time for religious programming. Because of network policy, many of the affiliates could not accept paid religious broadcasting. By the nineteen-seventies, this situation had changed. The networks no longer dominated their affiliates, and the F.C.C. had ruled that it would consider paid religious broadcasts as satisfying the public-service requirement; therefore, one affiliate after another had begun to sell off its Sunday-morning hours. Since there was—initially—little competition for the “religious ghetto” hours on Sunday morning, the evangelists could buy this time cheaply. The new technology of television—cable systems, communications satellites, and UHF stations—made air time even more available. And it made it even cheaper, too, since many cable stations would pick up the religious broadcasts free to fill their programming schedules. Thus, even in fiscal 1979 it cost Falwell only nine million dollars a year to broadcast his daily radio and weekly television programs all over the country. In addition, new computer technology (or the new availability of it) permitted independent evangelists to establish sophisticated “feedback loops” through telephone banks and direct-mail services with “personalized” letters and solicitations. These feedback loops were, in a sense, the key to the evangelists’ operations, for it took relatively few people giving ten or twenty dollars a month to keep the programs on the air.\n\nThe main-line clergy—who worried a great deal about this use of television—insisted upon the minority status of these evangelists, and pointed to ratings showing that Oral Roberts reached only two per cent of American households each week and that most of them, including Robertson, Bakker, and Falwell, reached less than one per cent. (National television ratings, however, do not take into account the cable channels, so these figures are in fact significantly higher.) The main-line clergy also pointed out that the audiences for these programs consisted mainly of women over forty-five in relatively low income brackets. They said that while many of the programs of major churches had far larger ratings, this meant nothing to the television stations, since the major churches could not pay for the air time (and would not solicit contributions). The local stations, by selling off their Sunday-morning air time, had permitted those evangelists with no scruples about commercializing religion to drive much of the other clergy—Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish—off the air. In 1980, ninety per cent of all religion on television was commercial, and most of it was controlled by right-wing fundamentalist groups. In the view of the mainstream clergy, this represented a distortion of the medium and a great injustice to the majority of Americans.\n\nAll the same, the mainstream clergy had to admit that the television evangelists had come along at a time of change in the religious life of the country. During the nineteen-seventies, they had watched a decline in the membership of liberal churches and a rather dramatic rise in the membership of conservative churches. In 1976, the year of Jimmy Carter’s election, the Gallup organization had found that there were fifty million “born-again Christians” in the country. About half of them were fundamentalists, and not even all of the fundamentalists were consistently conservative on social and political issues. Still, as the political mood of the country was shifting toward the right the religious trend was away from the social gospel and toward the pietistic and the privatistic. The liberal clergy feared that the capture of the media by conservative evangelists had increased this trend, and that in the end the evangelists might succeed in changing the structure of religious life in the country.\n\nTheologically speaking, it is easy to see why conservative evangelists should be attracted to television as a medium: for those who believe that salvation can be achieved by a sudden, spontaneous leap to faith, television serves as the equivalent of a vast revival tent, offering immediate mass escape from eternal damnation. But why a mass television audience should be attracted to a specifically fundamentalist theology is—in the abstract—less understandable. From a doctrinal point of view, fundamentalism is, after all, a gloomy and demanding enterprise that goes against much of what has long been assumed to be the American grain: faith in science, faith in human nature, and faith that man can improve the conditions of life on earth. Fundamentalism runs through a number of Protestant denominations (there are Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist fundamentalists in addition to Holiness and Pentecostal fundamentalists), but at its core is the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy. Fundamentalists believe that every word in the Bible is—literally—the Word of God. Many of them also believe that creation occurred in exactly six days around ten thousand years ago, and that human history will end fairly soon with the coming of the Antichrist, and after that most of mankind will have to endure a terrible period of tribulation before Christ returns to the earth and installs his millennial reign of peace and justice (the doctrine of premillennialism). The world is now full of sin and suffering, but even Christians can do little to improve matters, since man’s very nature is evil. The sole task for a Christian is to bring as many others as possible to Christ, so that they can escape the tribulation to come.\n\nThis dour message was not, however, much in evidence on the television airwaves—and certainly not in the programming of the big-time evangelists. Anyone who turned on the tube of a Sunday morning would see a lot of well-washed, smiling faces and hear the only two pieces of good news in fundamentalist theology: the certainty of salvation for the believer, and the willingness of God to intervene directly in the believer’s life. On the “700 Club,” sleek, good-looking Pat Robertson would interview a celebrity guest, such as Charles Colson, then, minutes later, fall to his knees, lift his hands to Heaven, and say, “There’s a woman in Philadelphia who has cancer—cancer of the lymph nodes. It hasn’t been diagnosed yet, but God has just cured her of it!” On the James Robison show, Robison, who looks like a combination of James Dean and Burt Lancaster, would thunder on about sexual perversion and “secular humanism,” then introduce a lovely woman singer—or perhaps the lovely Mr. and Mrs. Cullen Davis, newly brought to Christ. The Oral Roberts show has grand vistas and large multitudes. Standing tall against the skyline of his new hospital and university complex, in Tulsa, Roberts directs banked choirs in inspirational singing or calls students out of the huge auditorium to pray over the mountains of mail he receives. The message that comes through clearest from all these shows is that God pays particular attention to the health and financial prosperity of those who send in contributions to religious TV shows.\n\nFundamentalist evangelists have traditionally preached the American civil religion; that is, reverence for the flag, for freedom, for the armed forces, and for the American way of life. Most of the television evangelists have thus been addressing political and social issues for some time. Still, it was somewhat surprising that they would launch themselves directly into electoral politics—that was a break with tradition. And not all of them did join the fray. Oral Roberts, a paternal and politically moderate figure, kept out of it altogether—as did Billy Graham and Rex Humbard. It was the younger men who stepped forward: Pat Robertson, the host of a talk show and the director of a religious network in Virginia Beach, Virginia; Jim Bakker, a former protégé of Robertson’s, who has duplicated Robertson’s success with his own talk show and his own religious network, in North Carolina; James Robison, in Fort Worth; and Jerry Falwell, in Lynchburg. Initially, it was Pat Robertson who showed the greatest enthusiasm for politics. In the fall of 1979, he brought politicians onto his talk show, endorsed candidates all over the map, and told the press, “We have enough votes to run the country.” Jim Bakker was not far behind. In November of 1979, he told a reporter, “Our goal is to influence all viable [Presidential] candidates on issues important to the church. We want answers. We want appointments in government.” In the late spring of 1980, however, both Robertson and Bakker retreated from the political arena, having apparently decided that the risks of political involvement were too great. (Hence, perhaps, their decision not to attend the broadcasters’ convention where Reagan would speak.) In the end, only two of the superstars—Robison and Falwell—remained in the fight. Interestingly, unlike Bakker and Robertson, they were not charismatics: Robison was a Southern Baptist, and Falwell the pastor of an independent Baptist church. Falwell was the senior of the two, with the larger television audience, and, as head of the Moral Majority, he took a more active role than Robison. By the end of the campaign, he had become for the press the symbolic head of the whole fundamentalist political movement. “We are fighting a holy war,” Falwell had said, “and this time we are going to win.”\n\nBy comparison with the other evangelists (who were his competitors in what became a fierce and expensive competition for Sunday-morning air time), Falwell is the most sober and conventional of preachers. His program, “The Old-Time Gospel Hour,” is simply a videotape recording of the eleven-o’clock service in the Thomas Road Baptist Church. (The tape is edited, and extra footage is occasionally added.) The choir behind him sings traditional Baptist hymns, and he, strong-jawed and portly of figure, wearing a thick three-piece black suit, looks every inch the Baptist preacher of the pre-television era. True, there is a good deal of showmanship in his services. The female members of one of his singing groups, the Sounds of Liberty, wear Charlie’s Angels hairdos and seem to snuggle up against their virile-looking male counterparts. Don Norman, one of the resident soloists and a pastor of the church, has a distinctly television-era pouf to his silver-gray hair. Another resident soloist, a cherub-faced young man called Robbie Hiner, provides comic relief by joking with Falwell and by wearing, on occasion, a bright-green suit, which contrasts strikingly with the baby-blue carpeting of the church. The “inspirational” singing involves a good deal of heavy breathing and a good many references to heavenly riches. Falwell does not, however, actually say that financial rewards will accrue to those who send him money. And, unlike many of the evangelists, he quite often mentions the problems of leading a Christian life in a sinful world.\n\nIn a sense, it was not surprising that Falwell decided to go into politics. No mystical, otherworldly type of Baptist, he is most characteristically an organizer and a promoter. In 1956, he founded the Thomas Road Baptist Church with thirty-five people in an old factory building. Twenty-five years later, he has by far the biggest church in Lynchburg. It holds four thousand people and is jammed for every service on Sundays. He has a school, Lynchburg Christian Academy, from kindergarten through the twelfth grade, for the children of his parishioners; he has a home for alcoholics, a summer camp for children, a Bible institute and correspondence course, a seminary, and Liberty Baptist College, which is accredited and for which he is engaged in building a campus. He has a few wealthy backers, but most of his funds come from small contributors in Lynchburg and around the country. Businessmen in Lynchburg say he is a born leader and the best salesman they have ever seen.\n\nBut Falwell is also, as he has said, a “separatist, premillennialist, pre-tribulationist sort of fellow.” He believes, he has said, that “this is the terminal generation before Jesus comes.” And in 1965 he eloquently argued the doctrine of separation from the world in a sermon called “Ministers and Marchers”:\n\nAs far as the relationship of the church to the world, it can be expressed as simply as the three words which Paul gave to Timothy—“Preach the Word.” We have a message of redeeming grace through a crucified and risen Lord. This message is designed to go right to the heart of man and there meet his deep spiritual need. Nowhere are we commissioned to reform the externals. We are not told to wage wars against bootleggers, liquor stores, gamblers, murderers, prostitutes, racketeers, prejudiced persons or institutions, or any other existing evil as such. Our ministry is not reformation but transformation. The gospel does not clean up the outside but rather regenerates the inside. . .\n\nWhile we are told to “render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,” in the true interpretation, we have very few ties on this earth. We pay our taxes, cast our votes as a responsibility of citizenship, obey the laws of the land, and other things demanded of us by the society in which we live. But, at the same time, we are cognizant that our only purpose on this earth is to know Christ and to make Him known. Believing the Bible as I do, I would find it impossible to stop preaching the pure saving gospel of Jesus Christ, and begin doing anything else—including fighting Communism, or participating in civil-rights reforms.\n\nAt his press conference at the broadcasters’ convention, Falwell repudiated this sermon as “false prophecy.” Last summer, he had moved a hundred and eighty degrees from his former position by vowing to undertake civil disobedience if Congress voted to draft women into the armed forces.\n\nWhy Falwell changed his mind is an interesting question, and, in view of the fact that great numbers of fundamentalist pastors and lay people around the country went through the same transformation in the nineteen-seventies, it is also an important one. In the nineteen-sixties, fundamentalists had been one of the least politicized groups in the country; as Falwell discovered, very few of them were even registered to vote. Whether or not their numbers were on the increase, by the mid-seventies they had begun to make their voices heard. In 1974, for instance, fundamentalist pastors and parents in Kanawha County, West Virginia, had closed the schools down in protest against the introduction of schoolbooks that they said were un-Christian, unpatriotic, and destructive of the family and constituted an incitement to racial violence. A committee of the National Education Association investigated what became a prolonged series of demonstrations, and concluded that the trouble resulted in part from the cultural gap between the school board and the isolated mountain communities it served. The Kanawha County incident itself, however, turned out to be far from isolated. In the mid-seventies, groups of “concerned citizens” in many parts of the country, including the Northeast and the Midwest, attempted to purge their schools of similar books, protested against sex education, lobbied for the teaching of “scientific creationism” in biology courses, and called for the return of the old pedagogy of rote work. In hundreds of other communities—principally but not exclusively in the South—parents pulled their children out of the public schools and helped their pastors to build “Christian academies.” According to Falwell, there were fourteen hundred “Christian” schools in the early sixties and sixteen thousand in October of 1980, with new ones going into construction at the rate of one every seven hours. The same period saw the growth of statewide, then nationwide campaigns against abortion, gay rights, and the E.R.A. Supported by fundamentalist pastors—such as Falwell—these campaigns had considerable success in state referenda and in state legislatures. Fundamentalists were not the only constituency for these movements (Anita Bryant is a fundamentalist, while Phyllis Schlafly is a Catholic), but they were an important one, and their pastors had influence with other conservative evangelicals. By 1978, a Washington-based group of political organizers on the right—a group that included Richard Viguerie, the direct-mail specialist; Howard Phillips, the director of the Conservative Caucus; Terry Dolan, of the National Conservative Political Action Committee; and Paul Weyrich, of the Heritage Foundation and the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress—had identified the fundamentalist pastors as a strategic element in the building of a new coalition, which they called the New Right.\n\nThere was something extraordinary about all this. At the time of the Scopes trial, in 1925, most educated people had considered fundamentalism outmoded and irrelevant—a mere reaction to the advances in science and to modernity in general. Since then, American historians have tended to neglect the fundamentalist constituency or to see it as vestigial—the last cry of the still backwaters of the South against the modern world. But now fundamentalism was the religion of television and a part of the evangelical revival of the nineteen-seventies and eighties. The oldest right in America had become the New Right of 1980. Instead of being typified by a businessman on the golf links, the Republican Party leadership was now looking more and more like William Jennings Bryan in a double knit and television makeup. Pastors who once counselled withdrawal from the world of sin—and specifically the evils of politics—now bargained with politicians in the back rooms of Congress and gave sermons on defense policy.\n\nFalwell’s own explanation for these things, as one might imagine, has to do with the increasingly parlous state of the nation and the sense of crisis he and other Americans began to feel in the mid-seventies. That crisis, he says, now extends across the board, from the forty per cent divorce rate to the growth of the pornography industry to the feminist movement, the widespread use of drugs, social-worker intervention in the family, sex education, abortion on demand, the “abandonment” of Taiwan and the “loss” of the Panama Canal, Internal Revenue Service interference with “Christian” schools, rampant homosexuality, the notion of children’s rights, and the spread of “secular humanism.” In his view, all these things have corrupted the moral fibre of the country and destroyed its will to resist Communism. In his view, the country is in far worse shape than it was thirty, or even ten, years ago. In his view, moral Americans—Catholics, Protestants, Mormons, and Jews—finally woke up to this fact and realized that they must do something about it.\n\nIt is a theory, and, like most theories about American society, it is difficult to test on the national level. It cannot be proved by Nielsen ratings, voting statistics, or public-opinion polls—certainly not by the polls that Falwell sends his supporters, which ask such questions as “Do you approve of the American flag being burned in liberal and radical anti-American demonstrations?” and “Do you approve of the ratification of the E.R.A., which could well lead to homosexual marriages, unisexual bathrooms, and, of course, the mandatory drafting of women for military combat?” It is a theory, and it may be the correct one. Yet it is a theory that seems singularly farfetched in the context of Lynchburg, Virginia, for a more stable, tranquil, family-oriented city would be hard to find. But Lynchburg is the city where Falwell grew up and where he found his congregation.\n\nLynchburg lies on the James River, in a country of small farms and wooded, rolling hills at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. A hundred and sixty miles southwest of Washington, it is beyond the gentleman-farming, horse-breeding country and more than halfway to Appalachia. It’s a small city—only sixty-seven thousand people—far from any major urban center. All the same, it is enterprising and not wholly provincial. Several large American corporations have plants in Lynchburg, and its nearly two hundred small factories turn out a great variety of goods, including paper products, medical supplies, children’s clothing, and shoes. Because of the diversity of its manufactures, business journals sometimes use it for a Middletown or a model of the national economy as a whole. It is an old manufacturing city—one of the oldest in the South, according to its Chamber of Commerce—but it does not look it, for there are few belching smokestacks. The vista from the top of its one twenty-story building is mainly of trees and a bend in the river. It does not rival Charlottesville—sixty miles to the north—as a cultural center; yet it is perhaps best known in the South for two women’s colleges, Randolph-Macon and Sweet Briar, which have turned out generations of Southern debutantes.\n\nLynchburg was founded—fairly recently, for Virginia—in the late eighteenth century, by John Lynch, an Irish-American tobacco farmer. During the Revolutionary War, John’s brother Colonel Charles Lynch set up an informal military court on his property and sentenced Tories to hanging by their thumbs—thus the origin of the word “lynching.” Lynchburg began as a tobacco-trading center and an agricultural market town. In the nineteenth century, new settlers—many of them Scotch-Irish Methodists and Presbyterians—moved in to build grain mills, an iron foundry, and small manufacturing enterprises. During the Civil War, it served as a staging area and hospital center for the Confederate Army of northern Virginia. After the war, its small tobacco farms grew less profitable, but its manufacturers prospered. When the industrial revolution came along, the Lynchburg merchants had the capital to build new foundries, cotton mills, and textile mills and a shoe factory. They used white labor almost exclusively, the blacks remaining on small, poor farms in the countryside.\n\nIn 1950, Lynchburg was still a mill town, most of its factories old-fashioned and its society hidebound, stratified, and segregated. But in the mid-fifties the town underwent the kind of transformation that was taking place in communities all across the South. A number of major national corporations began to arrive in town, attracted by low property taxes, nonunion labor, and relatively low pay scales. Among them were Babcock & Wilcox, the manufacturer of nuclear reactors; General Electric, which built a radio-assembly plant; and Meredith/Burda, a printing enterprise. The national corporations stimulated local industry and attracted other large manufacturers, from the North and from West Germany. Lynchburg businessmen now point with pride to the healthy diversity of the economy and to high levels of employment, even in recession times. In fact, the unemployment rate is usually lower than the national average; still, the median family income in Lynchburg is below that of Virginia as a whole. But the town has changed in other ways since 1950, for the big industries brought new money into town and new faces into the boardrooms and the country clubs. The colleges flourished. And in the mid-sixties, when the black ministers and their congregations conducted a series of sit-ins and demonstrations, they found that the white community was not immovable. Under pressure, the companies hired black workers, and the city’s segregation ordinances were stricken from the books.\n\nLynchburg calls itself a city, but it is really a collection of suburbs, its population spread out over fifty square miles. In the nineteen-fifties, its old downtown was supplanted by a series of shopping plazas, leaving it with no real center. There’s a good deal of variety to its neighborhoods. Along the James River, in a section called Rivermont, stately nineteenth-century mansions look out over wooded parks and lawns. Behind them are streets of white-shingled Victorian houses and, behind them, tracts of comfortable post-Second World War developer-built Capes and Colonials. At the edges of town, the developers are still at work, and streets with such names as Crestview and Forest Park run through sections of half-acre lots before dead-ending in the woods. There are poor neighborhoods in Lynchburg—neighborhoods where cocks crow in the back yards of trembling wooden houses—and a part of the old downtown is a depressed area of abandoned factories and boarded-up shops. But there are no real slums. The city has used federal funds to build low-cost housing, and it is now having some success in revitalizing the old downtown.\n\nLynchburg is not a graceful city. The automobile has cut too many swaths across it, leaving gasoline stations and fast-food places to spring up in parking-lot wastelands. But it is a clean city, full of quiet streets and shade trees. Even the factories are clean; the new ones are windowless buildings with landscaped lawns. It’s a safe city and a comfortable place to live. There’s not much crime or juvenile delinquency. The medical services are good. The public schools are handsome, well equipped, and good enough to send sixty-three per cent of their students on to college. They are also racially integrated and free of racial tension. As for the things Falwell spends so much time denouncing—pornography, drugs, “the homosexual life style”—Lynchburg harbors these things quietly if it harbors them at all. You can find Playboy in a few magazine racks, but the movie theatres rarely play even an R-rated film. There are a number of bar-restaurants and discos. But the hottest band in town is probably the combo that plays nightly in the lounge of the Sheraton Inn. At night, young people can go to the skating rink or to night games of the New York Mets farm team, held at the Lynchburg Municipal Stadium. If there is a single public nuisance for the young in this town, it is surely boredom.\n\nLynchburg is a city of churches—it has over a hundred of them—and the first question people ask of new acquaintances is not what they do but what church they attend. At church time on Sunday, the streets are empty and quiet, with almost all the cars in town parked near the churches. Dominated by its churches and by its business community, it is a conservative place in most respects. Traditionally a Byrd Democrat town, it has turned Republican in recent years, voting for Gerald Ford in 1976—while remaining faithful to Harry Byrd. Still, it has its liberal element. The population is twenty-five per cent black, and the civil-rights movement left a well-organized black community. And, besides Liberty Baptist College, Randolph-Macon, and Sweet Briar, it has another liberal-arts college: Lynchburg College, which is coeducational. These colleges do not generate much intellectual ferment or political radicalism, but they and their graduates do provide the city with other voices and a useful degree of political flexibility. The seven-member city council includes at least four moderate liberals, among them a woman and a black man. These liberals now belong. They participate in the humane and amicable consensus that runs the city. When they speak to outsiders, it is in the complacent tone of the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFalwell’s church, on Thomas Road, is a block or two away from Lynchburg College, in one of the older middle-class sections. From the outside, it is not much to look at: a large, octagonal brick building fronting the street, with a three-story brick school behind it. The parking lot beside it is, however, supermarket-size, and on Sundays the cars jam up the street for blocks trying to fit into it beside the school buses. In summer, many of the cars come from out of state, for families from all over the country like to visit the church they watch on television. In winter, the cars and school buses bring Liberty Baptist College students and visitors from small rural churches in the area as well as the regular church members.\n\nWinter and summer, the congregation looks like nothing more or less than the solid midsection of this town. It consists mainly of couples with two or three children, but there are a number of young adults and a number of elderly people. The men wear double-knit suits and sport gold wedding bands or heavy brass rings stamped with mottoes; the women, their hair neatly coiffed and lacquered, wear demure print dresses and single-diamond engagement rings. The young women and the high-school girls are far more fashionable. Their flowered print dresses fall to mid-calf but are cut low on the bodice and worn with ankle-strap high heels. They wear their hair long, loose, and—almost uniformly—flipped and curled in Charlie’s Angels style. Like the boys with their white shirts, narrow-fitted pants, and close-cropped hair, they look fresh-faced and extraordinarily clean. The members of the congregation look, in other words, much like Robbie Hiner, Don Norman, and the other singers who appear on “The Old-Time Gospel Hour.” There are proportionately about the same number of blacks in the congregation as there are in the choir—which is to say, very few. (The television cameras tend to pan in on the two black choir members, thus making them more conspicuous to the television audience than they are to the congregation in the church.) What is startling about the congregation is its uniform aspect.\n\nAs it turns out, a number of the Thomas Road Church members live in the new, developer-built houses on the edges of town; comfortable suburban-style houses set on half-acre lawns, with central air-conditioning and kitchens like the ones that appear in detergent advertisements on television—and just as clean. To these houses, the Thomas Road families have added shag rugs and wallpaper or chintz curtains. A woman I visited, Nancy James, had just bought a living-room suite, and another, Jackie Gould, had ordered a new set of kitchen cabinets and had them installed without—she says, giggling—consulting her husband. One family had not only a living room but a family room, with a Naugahyde pouf, a twenty-four-inch television set, and a sliding glass door looking out over a stone-paved terrace. On a Sunday evening while I was there, this couple gave a potluck supper for twenty neighbors and fellow church members. The man of the house—resplendent in a fitted white shirt, cream-colored trousers, and white shoes—watched a boxing match on television with the other men while his wife organized the dishes of ham, baked beans, candied squash, and potato salad the other women had brought with them. At dinner, around a lace-covered table, the guests joked and made small talk about their gardens, the water system in Lynchburg, the problems of giving a Tupperware party, and the advantages of building one’s own house. After dinner, the men and women separated, the men going into the living room and the women upstairs for an hour or so of Bible reading and prayers.\n\nIn such circumstances, it was difficult to see how Falwell could complain so much about moral decay, sex, drink, drugs, the decline of the family, and so on. Conversely, it was difficult to imagine why such people would be drawn to a preacher who spent so much time denouncing drink and pornography. On the face of it, these people would seem far better suited to a tolerant, easygoing church whose pastor would not make a point—as Falwell once did—of forbidding his congregants to watch “Charlie’s Angels.” Of course, not all Thomas Road Church members live in such order and comfort. To go with its pastors on their rounds is to see that the Sunday-morning impression of the congregation is to some degree misleading—or in the nature of a Platonic ideal. A number of its members live in government-sponsored housing projects or in neighborhoods of old wooden houses. In one thin-walled apartment, I saw a woman sitting with her head in her hands gazing dejectedly at four squalling children under the age of nine—the baby crawling naked across the linoleum floor. (The pastor prissily told the older girl to put some underpants on the baby.) At a church-sponsored flea market, I found a number of women with worn faces buying and selling children’s used clothing while their husbands squatted in a circle under a nearby tree and talked about boot camp and “Nam.” According to one pastor, many of the elderly people in the church are single women who live on Social Security allowances of four or five thousand dollars a year. And most of them, according to the pastor, have never travelled outside the state of Virginia.\n\nWhat is more, to talk to the people who live in the comfortable suburban-style houses is to discover that many of them did not grow up in such middle-class circumstances. William Sheehan, chairman of the church’s Division of Prayer, became a lawyer late in life. He ran away from home and a drunken father at the age of eighteen and lived for a year with his grandfather in the boiler room of a school in Montana. He held various jobs, married at the age of twenty-one, and had nine children. His family responsibilities kept him hard at work at manual or clerical jobs. Only when he was in his forties did he have the time to study. He then took night courses in law, passed the state bar exam, apprenticed himself to an older lawyer, and eventually inherited a practice in a small Montana town. In conversation, Sheehan thanks God in every other sentence and gives the Lord credit for everything that he has ever done or that has ever happened to him. He never drank, he said, but he was able to stop cursing when he accepted Jesus Christ as his Saviour, at the age of nineteen.\n\nMost of Falwell’s parishioners came from closer to home, but a lot of them came from the countryside and the small towns of southern Virginia and West Virginia. One guest at the potluck supper talked about his childhood in a narrow coal-mining valley of Appalachia, where the preachers handled poisonous snakes and spoke in tongues. He has never got used to the Lynchburg traffic, he said, for where he had lived the sound of a car on the road meant that you picked up your shotgun and left by the back door.\n\nTo talk to Falwell’s parishioners is to see that the geography of Lynchburg is symbolic in terms of their lives. As the city stands between Appalachia and Washington, D.C., so the arrival of new industry over the past twenty-five years made it the transfer point between the Old and the New South, between the technologically backward and the technologically modern parts of the society. Many current Lynchburg residents, including many Thomas Road members, literally made the journey between the underdeveloped countryside and the city. Many others, however, made a similar journey without moving at all. In the early fifties, Lynchburg had a relatively unskilled work force and a very small middle class; today, it has a highly skilled work force and a much larger middle class. Falwell’s parishioners stand, as it were, on the cusp of this new middle class. They are clerical workers, technicians, and small businessmen, and skilled and semiskilled workers in the new factories.\n\nAmong the church members and the students at Liberty Baptist are many who grew up in fundamentalist Christian families and have never known any other way of life. Those who came from the small towns of Virginia or West Virginia think of Lynchburg as a sophisticated city; and those who came from big cities like Philadelphia think of it as a refuge from the anarchy of modern America. Among those who do not have a fundamentalist background, a high proportion seem to have had difficult, disorganized childhoods—family histories of alcoholism, physical violence, or trouble with the law. They had—or so they say—to struggle out of their families and then to struggle with themselves. They credit the Lord with their success, and they date their success from the moment they were, as they say, “saved.”\n\nFalwell’s parishioners do not give the Thomas Road Baptist Church—or any other church—credit for the changes in their lives, because in their theology it is an error (specifically, a Catholic error) to suppose that institutions stand between man and God. There is some irony in this belief, for the Thomas Road Church is a great deal more than a house for prayers. It is a vast and mighty institution, with some sixty pastors and about a thousand volunteer helpers and trainees. It has the Lynchburg Christian Academy, the summer camp, and Liberty Baptist College, whose students worship and work in the church. In addition, it has separate ministries for children, young people, adults, elderly people, the deaf, the retarded, and the imprisoned. Last year, it added a ministry for divorced people and another one for unmarried young adults. On Sundays, the church holds three general services and has Sunday-school classes for children of every age group, from the nursery on up. But it is a center of activity every day of the week. There is a general prayer meeting every Wednesday night. Then, every week each ministry offers a program of activities for its age group, including Bible-study classes, lectures, trips, sports outings, and picnics. The ministries also organize groups of volunteers to visit hospitals, nursing homes, and prisons and to proselytize in the community. The organization is so comprehensive that any Thomas Road member, old or young, could spend all his or her time in church or in church-related activities. In fact, many church members do just that.\n\nEldridge Dunn, a former tool-and-die-maker for General Electric, runs one of the largest and busiest of the church organizations, the Children’s Ministry. Dunn explained to me that the purpose of his ministry is to provide a total environment for children—a society apart from the world. “Our philosophy is that children should not have to go into the world,” he said. “They should not have to get involved with drugs or Hollywood movies. But you can’t just tell kids not to do things. You have to give them something to do. So we try to provide them with everything that’s necessary for children. We take the older kids backpacking. We’ll rent a skating rink this year. Our idea is to compete with the world.” This philosophy, Dunn went on to say, is not unique to the Thomas Road Church; all churches advocating separation from the world engage in a similar competition, however limited their resources—and some churches have far better facilities than Thomas Road. What distinguishes his church is its aggressiveness. “I’d like to build a program for every child in Lynchburg,” Dunn said.\n\nOn Monday afternoons, Gary Hunt, a ministerial student in his mid-twenties working with the Thomas Road Youth Ministry, collects a dozen or more children from various parts of Lynchburg in a school bus and takes them back to his house for the afternoon. With one exception, the children do not come from Thomas Road families or attend Lynchburg Christian Academy. Hunt, who is tall, blond, and athletic, found them by hanging around a junior high school and playing basketball with the kids coming out of class. Now they gather at his house every week for sports and a Bible-study class, and they have all been, as they say, “saved.”\n\nWhen I arrived at the Hunts’ house one Monday afternoon, Hunt was just bringing the boys in from a ballgame outside, and his wife, Angie, was showing the girls how to bake chocolate-chip cookies. For a while, the kitchen was a confusion of twelve-year-olds, the girls yelling at each other and the boys wandering around sweatily in search of something to drink. When the kids had quieted down, Gary took the boys to the basement, and Angie settled the girls in the living room. Downstairs, Hunt had the boys sit in a circle around him and passed out small workbooks. Asking them to turn to the chapter on baptism, he read out the text and explained, in a manner that seemed to me perfunctory, the scriptural basis for baptism. He seemed less interested in having them understand the idea of baptism than in having them copy the correct words in the blank spaces of the workbook. But, then, three or four of the boys did not read very well, and all of them seemed to have a hard time sitting still and concentrating on anything for long. When the spaces were filled in, Hunt talked to the boys briefly about their behavior, reminding them that smoking and cursing were sins, and praising them for making progress toward their goal of living as Christ did. He ended by inviting two of them to join the church choir and by asking those who were not baptized to come with him to the church on Sunday and go through the ceremony. The boys agreed with a touching eagerness.\n\nLater, Hunt told me that most of the children came from fairly poor families and that most of them were not Baptists by background. “Some of them are rough kids,” he said. “The girls don’t know anything about conduct—they yell at each other. Angie shows them how to be ladylike and how to do things they don’t do at home, like baking cookies. The boys are tough—used to using their fists. But they’ve come a long way in a few months. They’re less wild. They don’t swear like they used to, and they don’t fight with the other kids so much.”\n\nThe pastors and pastoral students at the Thomas Road Baptist Church conceive of their activities in theological terms and could, if called upon, justify any one of them by a Biblical quotation. All the same, to listen to Hunt or to see a pastor remind a little girl to put underpants on her baby brother is to see that they are involved in a world of appearances, social forms, and personal behavior at some remove from Biblical history and at some remove from the direct, mystical experience of Christ. For them, getting “saved” is clearly only the first step. It is true that most clergymen of all faiths are involved with the conduct of daily life, but the Thomas Road pastors—and fundamentalist pastors generally—have a much more specific and detailed set of prescriptions for the conduct of everyday life than do most Protestant churchmen. They have—like many Southern Baptists—absolute prohibitions against drink, tobacco, drugs, cursing, dancing, rock and roll, and extramarital sex, but they also have specific prescriptions for dress, child rearing, and the conduct of a marriage. The Liberty Baptist College student handbook, for instance, decrees that men are to wear ties to all classes. “Hair should be cut in such a way that it does not come over the ear or collar. Beards or mustaches are not permitted. Sideburns should be no longer than the bottom of the ear.” As for women, “dresses and skirts. . . shorter than two inches [below] the middle of the knee are unacceptable. Anything tight, scant, backless, and low in the neckline is unacceptable. . . .” These rules are less formally laid down for the members of the Thomas Road Church.\n\nFor the proper relations between husband and wife, parents and children, the rules are spelled out in a book called “The Total Family,” written by Edward Hindson, the family-guidance pastor of the church, and endorsed by Falwell. According to Hindson:\n\nThe Bible clearly states that the wife is to submit to her husband’s leadership and help him fulfill God’s will for his life. She is to submit to him just as she would submit to Christ as her Lord. This places the responsibility of leadership upon the husband where it belongs. In a sense, submission is learning to duck, so God can hit your husband! He will never realize his responsibility to the family as long as you take it.\n\nThe same passages that command the wife to obey her husband, command the husband to love his wife! Being a leader is not being a dictator, but a loving motivator, who, in turn, is appreciated and respected by his family. Dad, God wants you to be the loving heartbeat of your home by building the lives of your family through teaching and discipline.\n\nIn another chapter, Hindson deals with the parent-child relationship and gives “Five Steps to Effective Discipline.” He attacks Dr. Benjamin Spock, modern psychology, and modern public education, on the ground that they have encouraged children to challenge their parents. Parents founding their authority on the word of God should, he says, command absolute authority over their children. Spanking, he explains, is Biblically mandated and must be employed if we are not to have another generation of irresponsible, undisciplined adults.\n\nThe pastors at Thomas Road would define most relationships outside the family in terms congruent with these. In school, children should not challenge their teachers but should accept instruction and discipline. On the job, a man should work hard, show discipline, and accept the authority of his employer. He should accept the authority of the church and the civil government in the same way. “He does not have the right to break the law, no matter how just his cause may seem,” Hindson writes. The pastors would, in fact, make a Confucian equation between the relationships of man to civil government and church and of children to their parents. In Hindson’s book, there is an organization chart that depicts these relationships: from “God,” at the top, the lines of authority descend to “local church,” on the one hand, and “civil authority,” on the other; the lines then descend and converge upon “total family”—father first, then mother, then children. The organization chart is entitled “God’s Chain of Command.”\n\nThe pastors at Thomas Road talk about creating a society apart from the world. But when they talk about “the world” in this context what they clearly mean is pornography, drugs, “secular humanism,” and so on: the evils of the world as they see them, and not American life in general. It is not, then, really paradoxical that many of their prescriptions for life look very much like tactics for integrating people into society rather than like tactics for separating them from it. Most communities, after all, would be happy to have a clean, hardworking family man who respected authority, obeyed the law, and kept off the welfare rolls. A factory manager, a city official, or a landlord would find such a man an ideal type—particularly if the alternative to him were a drinking, brawling country fellow with no steady job, six runny-nosed kids, and a shotgun he might consider using against a law officer. And, to look at it from another angle, the country fellow would get nowhere with General Electric or the Rotary Club, even if he desperately wanted to. As for the women involved—why, they might have invented this church, so heavily do the prohibitions fall on traditional male vices such as drinking, smoking, running around, and paying no heed to the children. To tell “Dad” that he made all the decisions would be a small price to pay to get the father of your children to become a respectable middle-class citizen.\n\nThe pastors at Thomas Road set enormous store by the virtues of sports for young men. And sports, the oldest of Anglo-Saxon prescriptions for the sublimation of male violence and male sexual energies, might stand as a metaphor for the whole social enterprise of the church. Indeed, they ought to so stand, for the pastors often use sports as such a metaphor themselves. At a Lynchburg Christian Academy athletic-awards banquet whose theme was “Steppin’ Up to Victory,” Edward Dobson, the good-looking young dean of students at Liberty Baptist College, gave an after-dinner sermon on sports and the Christian life. He said that when he was a soccer player he used to spend hours—sometimes eight hours at a time—practicing one shot; he would give up everything else to do it. Well, he said, success in the Christian life is like success in sports: you have to discipline yourself to give up everything that might interfere or prove an obstacle. What you need is discipline, devotion, and consistency. There are Christians who start up fast, who read the Bible and go to church a lot, but then quit. But you can’t quit, because “whenever you quit you become a loser.” Keep your eye on the goal, keep running consistently, and “one day you will cross the finish line and stand before Jesus Christ.” Later, one of the coaches made another point: “The whole purpose of junior-high-school soccer is to instill a Christlike attitude into young men,” he said.\n\nSchool athletic banquets do tend to call up sports metaphors, but Thomas Road pastors talk about sports on all sorts of occasions. They probably talk about them as much as Anglican schoolmasters—which is a lot—but they talk about them in a different way. Where the Anglican headmaster will go on about how it’s not whether you win or lose but how you play the game, Thomas Road pastors will tell kids to get out there and win. Grace under pressure, aristocratic prowess, even fair play are not virtues they are much interested in. “God wants you to be a champion,” Falwell once told an assembly of his college students. “He wants you to be a victor for God’s glory. A champion is not an individual star but one of a team who knows how to function with others. Men of God are not interested in gaining personal fame. The man of God says, “I will be the best for God in the place where He puts me.’ ” Such sports talk does not suggest the manor house or the high commissioner’s residence any more than it suggests software and SoHo lofts. It suggests the steel mills and the values of nineteenth-century American capitalism.\n\nSuccess and how to get it are major themes in Thomas Road preaching. Falwell himself likes to preach from Paul’s Epistles to Timothy—from the letters in which the older evangelist gives the younger one some sound practical advice. For one sermon, Falwell chose the text “Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.” In his commentary, he said he often told younger preachers that “nothing is more important to you than moral purity,” and explained to them, “You can survive rumors of a money scandal, you can survive a split in the church . . . but if you break your marriage vows you will never fly so high again.” Falwell did not add “if you are caught at it,” but the advice is nothing if not a piece of worldly wisdom. In his sermons, his terms of reference often modulate in this fashion from Heaven to earth—from how to be a better Christian to how to improve yourself and gain the respect of others. He promises no miracles; his philosophy is simply that material wealth “is God’s way of blessing people who put Him first.”\n\nWhen Falwell is addressing his congregation on Wednesday evenings, he often talks about what he has done during the week. He talks about all the important people he has met on his trips around the country. He talks about New York and the narrow escapes he has had among the denizens of Sin City. He talks about his trips abroad—his visits to Israel, Thailand, Taiwan, and southern Africa—picturing himself on the front lines of conflict, and quoting what he said to high officials and heads of state. The obvious inferiority of the natives in these places does not at all appear to dispel the glamour of them for his congregation.\n\nLast summer, Falwell posed for a Newsweek photographer beside his swimming pool on the green lawn in front of the imposing white house he lives in. That the shot might be bad publicity did not occur to him at the time, for his own people know all about that house and the way he lives. At Christmas, Falwell sends out color photographs of himself, his wife, and their three children (whose first names all begin with “J”) in posh surroundings or posed in formal dress. His own people love to look at these pictures, for they think he deserves everything he has. They love to hear about his travels, for his account of them brings those faraway people and places somehow within their reach. They think themselves fortunate to be in the church with the television cameras where this man broadcasts to the nation. Furthermore, they love to hear him talk about himself, for when he talks about his early life he makes it clear that he is not some pale, prissy, holier-than-thou minister but—underneath his celebrity—someone much like them.\n\nFalwell has said a good deal about his early life, in sermons and in books he distributes as advertisements for himself and his enterprises. As in all biographies, certain facts have been selected for publication and others left out. According to “Aflame for God,” by Gerald Strober and Ruth Tomczak, Falwell was born, with a twin brother, Gene, to Carey and Helen Falwell on August 11, 1933. (“Although it was impossible to predict at the time, one of the most crucial dates in the history of the town...”) The family, which included two children—Virginia and Lewis—considerably older than the twins, lived in a white frame house a mile and a half east of a section of downtown Lynchburg called Fairview Heights. The earliest photograph in the book shows Jerry and Gene aged about two, Jerry in the arms of a man in overalls and a work-stained shirt, with a high-crowned dark hat pulled down over his weather-beaten face. The man is Jerry’s grandfather Charles Falwell, and the family resemblance is striking. In later life, Jerry would have the same strong features, the same powerful, confident stance. A photograph of Jerry’s father, by contrast, shows a slight man in a three-piece suit with a pained expression on his face. Jerry’s older brother and sister are not pictured, but there is a photograph of his mother taken on Mother’s Day of 1971 and showing an ample-breasted woman with her hair pulled back beneath a black hat, wearing a printed black silk dress.\n\nThis book and other biographical accounts do not say very much about the Falwell family. There is no reason that they should, but the family history does have a certain sociological interest. Charles Falwell was a dairy farmer whose family had settled in the hills east of Lynchburg in the mid-nineteenth century, and had farmed in the narrow bottomland between the steep hills. Around 1900, with the industrialization of Lynchburg, mill hands and factory workers came to settle among the farmers along the railroad line. Fairview Heights—the new settlement—was a poor neighborhood, even in 1920; it had no paved roads and no street lights, and the houses had no running water. It was also a rough neighborhood. During the Prohibition era, the gentlefolk of Lynchburg used to frighten their daughters with tales of crime, vice, and white slavery in Fairview Heights. The tales were exaggerated but not without foundation, for four or five bootleggers who had sizable operations there had effectively closed it off to the law. “If you didn’t live there, you didn’t go there,” Gene Falwell recalls.\n\nCarey Falwell was the oldest in a family of boys. He had only a sixth-grade education, but he was a shrewd, hard-driving man, and before the twins were born he had managed to start a succession of small businesses. He financed bootlegging operations, and at various times he owned a service station, an oil dealership, and a small trucking company. The house Jerry was born in was a gentleman’s house that Carey had moved piece by piece from Rivermont, the wealthy section of town. He was driven by ambition. In the early thirties, along with his other enterprises, he set up a dance hall called the Merry Garden, with a restaurant and “tourist court” across the street. In 1931, he had shot and killed his brother Garland in the heat of an argument, apparently in self-defense. Around the time the twins were born (their birth, apparently, was not planned for), he went broke and had to sell his businesses to his brother Warren. His reverses and his remorse over the death of his brother drove him to despair and to drink. Eventually, he pulled himself and his family back from the brink of bankruptcy, but he continued to drink, and he died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1948, when Jerry was only fifteen.\n\n“Aflame for God” says of Jerry’s twin brother, Gene, that he “would follow in his father’s footsteps and become an aggressive, successful businessman and, along with his older brother Lewis, consolidate and add to the family’s extensive commercial interests.” The description could be more accurate. Some of the Falwells did very well in life. Calvin and Lawrence, the sons of Carey’s more stable brother Warren, took the small businesses they had inherited and built up a series of successful enterprises, including a well-drilling company, a trucking firm, and an aviation company. Genial, hardworking, and civic-minded, Calvin became one of Lynchburg’s city fathers; he is a member of the Chamber of Commerce and the president of the New York Mets farm team. But Jerry is the only real success in his immediate family. His brother Lewis has an excavation company, and Gene, who lives in the “home place,” where they grew up, runs a trailer park on the Falwell land. Calvin, an outgoing man with a soft Virginia drawl, speaks affectionately of Gene: “Aggressive? He’s the most easygoing kind of guy you’d ever want to meet. Never gets mad. Has all the time in the world for you. I suppose he hasn’t worn a tie since his mother’s funeral. In fact, I’m sure he hasn’t. Like someone once said to me, ‘I guess Jerry got the other half.’ ”\n\nThe Falwell “home place” isn’t far from the main commercial road, but the white house stands alone in a small pasture between two thickly wooded hills. “Jerry always said he wanted a house up there,” Gene told me, pointing to the top of a steep little hill. Gene is in and out of the house all day; he’ll go to fix an electric wire in someone’s trailer or help a brother-in-law prune a maple tree. A homebody who likes to hunt and fish and to make things grow, he can tell you in detail how to make maple sugar or how people make moonshine in a still. An unself-conscious man, he will also tell you how his grandpa used to make fun of the “colored boys” who worked for him. Gene’s wife, Jo Ann, who keeps the house, with its shag rugs and its modern kitchen, so neat it looks uninhabited, has clearly not been able to do very much about Gene’s clothes or the stubble on his chin. While Jo Ann goes to the Thomas Road Church and Calvin is a charter member of a rather more relaxed Baptist church, Gene stays home on Sunday, like his father and his grandfather before him.\n\nThe contrast between the twins became obvious in their early years. The boys entered elementary school together, but after a year Jerry skipped a grade, leaving Gene behind for the rest of their school careers. Jerry was good at schoolwork; he was particularly good at spelling and math, and he used to finish his tests fifteen minutes before the other kids. Since he had an almost photographic memory, he did not have to work hard, yet he did, for he wanted to be the best. In his junior year in high school, he entered the state spelling championship; when he lost because he could not recognize an unfamiliar word, he went back and read through an entire college edition of a dictionary. “He didn’t like farm work,” Gene recalls. “He’d leave me with the chores. When the time came, he always had something else to do. He never wanted to come out trapping with me, either. He’d have his head in a book or he’d be out playing baseball.” Jerry liked the sociable, competitive sports, and he was a good athlete. In his senior year in high school, he was captain of the football team. While Gene dropped out of school in his senior year and soon after joined the Navy, Jerry graduated with a 98.6 per cent average and was named class valedictorian.\n\nJerry was not allowed to give the valedictory speech, however, because school auditors discovered that he had taken cafeteria tickets and for some time had been handing them out to members of the football team. That incident was the last straw for the school authorities. Jerry had been in trouble with them for years. In grade school, he once set a snake loose in the classroom, and another time he put a large rat in a teacher’s desk drawer. Later on, in high school, he and some friends tied up the gym teacher and locked him in the basement. Jerry was, as his biographies put it, a prankster. Out of school, he and Gene used to hang around the Royal Café in Fairview Heights with a gang of boys who for fun would do things like piling a family’s porch furniture on the roof of the house. They didn’t like it when boys from other parts of town tried to date girls from Fairview Heights, so every week or so there would be fights with neighboring gangs. In a recent sermon called “My Testimony,” Falwell described these fistfights and said that he and a close friend, Jim Moon (now co-pastor at the Thomas Road Church), used to spend days and nights away from home, in “places it’s not necessary to talk about, doing things it’s not necessary to talk about.”\n\nMoon recalls that Jerry was always a leader among the Fairview boys, and that he was so in part because he had the only car and he was generous with it. Like so many leaders, Falwell seemed to have need of followers. At the same time, he was different from them, in that he knew what he wanted. “I didn’t have any aspirations,” Moon said to me. “I don’t remember wanting anything or hoping for anything except to grow up. There weren’t many opportunities back then. You could go to work at the hosiery mill, the foundry, or the shoe factory. There wasn’t much else. When I was sixteen, I was drinking a lot. But Jerry, he always wanted to be an engineer, and he was willing to do whatever was necessary to be the best.”\n\nIn 1950, Falwell entered Lynchburg College and began to take courses that would lead to a major in mechanical engineering. His plan was to transfer to Virginia Polytechnic Institute in his junior year, and by the end of his sophomore year there seemed to be no reason he should not do it: he had the highest math average in the college that year. But by fall he was enrolled in Baptist Bible College, in Springfield, Missouri, and was on his way to becoming a pastor. Just how he came to this decision is not clear.\n\nThe Falwells were not pious people. When Jerry was growing up, the men seemed to regard religion as something that women did. Jerry’s mother (described in “Aflame for God” as “a stern disciplinarian, but . . . kind, gracious, and loving”) used to take the twins to Sunday school when she went to church; but as soon as she had deposited them they would slip out the back and run to an uncle’s house to read the comics until it was time for her to pick them up. According to Falwell’s biographies, his only exposure to religion until he was eighteen came from listening—involuntarily—to Charles F. Fuller, a fundamentalist Baptist whose “Old-Fashioned Revival Hour” was the most popular religious radio program of the day. Jerry’s mother, so the story goes, would turn the program on every Sunday morning, and he and his brother would be too lazy to get up and turn it off. In January of his sophomore year, Jerry went with a group of friends, including Jim Moon, to the Park Avenue Baptist Church, in Lynchburg, for Sunday-evening services. After the service, he, Moon, and a number of others responded to the altar call and—as he says—accepted Christ. Under the instruction of a youth pastor, Jerry began reading the Bible, attending church services, and participating in church activities. “From January to March . . . I got my salvation established, and then from March to about July, I got my call to full-time service established,” Falwell has said.\n\nAt least one of the Falwell biographies says that Jerry and his friends went to that initial service at Park Avenue Baptist mainly because they had heard there were some pretty girls in the congregation. The story is wholly plausible, for Jerry later married the pretty young church pianist, Macel Pate, and Moon married the organist. But in “My Testimony” Falwell said that he went not only because of the pretty girls but also because he was already thinking of founding a church on his own. How he would have conceived of such a plan if, as he says, he had not heard the Bible preached in a church before is difficult to imagine. But then, according to Fairview Heights people, he had attended other churches—usually on Sunday nights with his friends. He had simply not been to a fundamentalist church before. In any case, Jerry did not seem to go through any moral or spiritual turmoil when he made his commitment. By his own account, he made a career decision.\n\nBaptist Bible College was little more than a group of quonset huts with the most Spartan of living arrangements. Falwell says that it was there that he met a number of “great preachers” with churches of three and four thousand people. He would, he says, follow these preachers around and run errands for them, to be near them and to learn as much as he could. He studied hard, but he did not give up his pranks. Once, he drove a motorcycle through the boys’ dormitory at midnight. Another time, he ran a garden hose into a friend’s room and flooded it. After his friend had spent three hours cleaning the water up, Falwell came in and emptied a five-gallon can of water onto the floor. (“He has an aggressive nature,” his biographers comment.) Macel Pate was now engaged to one of his roommates. Falwell managed “to get the other ring off her finger,” according to one account, in part by tearing up letters to her that the roommate gave him to mail. Macel, however, did not marry him until he was established in Lynchburg five years later.\n\nAccording to the biographies, the first real crisis in Falwell’s life came during his Bible-college career. He had asked to teach a Sunday-school class of eleven-year-olds in the local Baptist church, but because after some weeks he still had only one student the church superintendent threatened to take away his classbook. Jerry then began to go every afternoon to an unused room on the third floor of the college’s administration building, where he would pray for several hours, “crying out to God” for help with the class. On Saturdays, he went through all the parks and playgrounds in the town looking for eleven-year-olds, and by the time the school year was over, in May, he had fifty-six of them in his class.\n\nIn 1954, Falwell took a year out of college to work at the Park Avenue Baptist Church. In 1956, he returned to Lynchburg at the end of his senior year and, though he had received an offer to go elsewhere, decided to start a new church there with thirty-five dissident members of Park Avenue Baptist. He and his new congregation found an empty building on Thomas Road—it had recently been vacated by the Donald Duck Bottling Company—and spent several days scrubbing the cola syrup off the walls. A week after the first service in the church, Falwell began a half-hour Sunday broadcast for a new local radio station. Not long afterward, he began a daily radio program and a live Sunday-evening broadcast from a local television station. With these two broadcasts and the morning and evening Sunday services in his church, Falwell was for some time preaching four sermons every Sunday, beginning at 6:30 A.M. and ending around 9:00 P.M. On weekdays, he would go from door to door visiting each house in an ever-expanding radius from the church. In a year, his congregation went from thirty-five people to eight hundred and sixty-four.\n\nFalwell lays no claim to great originality as a preacher. When he speaks about the sources of his faith, his vocation, or his evangelistic style, he always makes much of Charles F. Fuller and his “Old-Fashioned Revival flour;” he also speaks of Dwight Moody, Billy Sunday, and the Southern preachers he took for mentors at Baptist Bible College. In the fundamentalist tradition, his theology is wholly orthodox; it is the religion of independent Baptist preachers throughout the Bible Belt. His preaching style is similarly conventional. Falwell does not have the flamboyance of a Billy Sunday—he has no real love for the language—nor does he have the soothing, media-modern style of charismatics like Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson. He is a pithy, old-fashioned preacher—a man who has made himself out of the traditional cloth. What distinguishes him among his peers is his organizational talent and his enormous, driving energy.\n\nIn “Church Aflame,” a book he wrote with Elmer Towns, the vice-president of Liberty Baptist College, the authors explain in some detail how Falwell organized the Thomas Road Church and built its membership into the thousands. His method was simply to use every available medium at once—the telephone, the printing press, personal contacts, broadcasting. In the late fifties and early sixties, he devoted himself to building up the church’s capacities for what he calls “saturation evangelism.” He put his parishioners to work on the phones. He bought a printing press and, with the help of church members, printed announcements, leaflets, and, finally, a newspaper. He then set up a telephone bank and also began to produce tape cassettes for sale. As his congregation increased, he would raise money, build new facilities, and then cast out a larger net for new members. In 1964, he completed the construction of a thousand-seat auditorium for his church services; from that year on, he acquired a new piece of land or built a new building almost every year. In 1967, he founded Lynchburg Christian Academy. In 1972, he brought nineteen thousand people to the Lynchburg Municipal Stadium for a Sunday-school meeting.\n\nFor twelve years—from 1956 to 1968—Falwell preached in his own church on Sundays and then went to a television station (first to the one in Lynchburg and later to one in Roanoke, sixty miles away) to preach a sermon for broadcast locally. In 1968, he was able to buy black-and-white television cameras and to tape one of the Sunday services in his church—at once easing his own incredible preaching schedule and providing a format for a television program. Two years later, shortly after the current Thomas Road church building was completed, he bought color-television cameras. Once he was in control of the production of his program, he and his brother-in-law, Sam K. Pate, bought time for the program on local television stations in the East and then throughout the country; following the practice of Oral Roberts, Rex Humbard, and others, they set up a direct-mail funding operation to defray the costs of production and distribution. In 1971, Falwell bought time on two hundred television stations; his revenues that year reached a million dollars.\n\n“Church Aflame” might serve as a how-to-do-it guide for the ambitious young evangelist if it were not for one important lacuna: money-raising. In this and other books, Falwell discusses the tithing of the local congregation, but he is silent on how to raise money from a television audience. On this subject, he has said, “We try to do everything that General Motors does to sell automobiles. Except that we do it better, maybe”—a statement that is not only too general to be helpful but also not quite accurate.\n\nFalwell’s fund-raising pitches on television (he makes them himself—an uncommon practice among television evangelists) suggest not General Motors ads but cereal-box-top offers. Send in nine-ninety-five and you will receive, in addition to your own special volume of inspirational literature, a perfectly free gratis Jesus First pin. Or: Become a Faith Partner—send in ten dollars a month and receive our four-color magazine of faith, Faith Aflame. Alternatively, here are two free Jesus First pins—wear them always—and send fifteen, twenty-five, a hundred dollars a month to help our Liberty Baptist students or our crusade against sin. You will receive our Crusader’s Passport. Call Jerry Falwell toll-free and share your need with one of our counsellors.\n\nSome of the pitches are more sophisticated. Last spring, Falwell was offering seven volumes of inspirational literature—the package, wrapped in silver paper with ribbon tied in a bow, looked extraordinarily like a gift-wrapped package from a liquor store. Celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Thomas Road Church, Falwell said, and send in a hundred dollars now, or twenty-five dollars for four months, to help with the construction of much-needed buildings at Liberty Baptist. He explained that the package contained the books that, apart from the Bible, had most influenced his spiritual life. One can only assume that these books were out of print and so reissued for the anniversary—which was in fact the church’s twenty-fourth.\n\nFalwell himself dreams up a good many of these pitches, but, as this particular appeal suggests, there are also a number of professionals at work on his fund-raising. Since 1973, he has employed an advertising agency and a Massachusetts computer-consulting firm called Epsilon Data Management, both of which have what they call “inputs on the creative side.” The main job of Epsilon Data Management is to help coördinate the mailings. Through this firm, Falwell can make appeals to a variety of different constituencies with a series of computer-printed letters appropriate to each. One set of appeals, for example, stresses patriotism, another missionary work, another the menace of pornography and homosexuality. Through Epsilon, Falwell manages four different “clubs,” whose members contribute to his various ministries monthly sums averaging about twenty dollars. His hundred and seventy thousand Faith Partners and the forty thousand members of his I Love America Club contribute to the general “Gospel Hour” fund; the members of his Founders Club and his 15,000 Club give money for buildings and for scholarships, respectively, at Liberty Baptist College. Falwell’s televised appeals alternate among these various constituencies.\n\nOn occasion, Falwell will make appeals for causes outside his own ministries, but the giver must beware. Last year, Falwell flew to Thailand to visit a refugee camp, where he was photographed in a bush jacket holding a Cambodian child in his arms. Thereafter, he made a series of appeals on television for the Indo-Chinese refugees. In March of 1980, he sent out an urgent letter describing in heartrending detail the plight of the Vietnamese boat people and appealing for emergency funds to buy food and medical supplies. On page 2 of the letter, the recipient would discover that the first hundred thousand dollars from that appeal would go to the boat people and the balance would go to “The Old-Time Gospel Hour.” (This spring, two similar appeals were made on behalf of refugees in Somalia.) A special newsletter sent out around the same period included photographs of starving Cambodian refugees and a description of their plight. In this newsletter, Falwell asked for twenty-five, fifty, or a hundred dollars from each recipient to help start the Liberty Missionary Society, “which will reach out to lost, hurting, and hungry souls around the world.” To examine the budget for the society in the newsletter was, however, to see that the appeal would bring the starving Cambodians no food and no medicine at all. The budget—two million dollars—showed, for instance, four hundred and fifty thousand dollars to support Liberty Baptist students on short-term missionary service in eighteen countries, thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars to buy air time for “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” in countries outside the United States and Canada, and four hundred and fifty thousand for capital expenditures on Liberty Baptist College. A hundred thousand dollars was promised for “foreign Bible distribution.”\n\nThese fund-raising techniques have proved remarkably successful. In fiscal 1979, “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” raised thirty-five million dollars from the two and a half million people on its mailing lists. The financial management of the church has been rather less than successful, though, and over the years Falwell has had his troubles with it. In the early seventies, his organization floated bond issues worth six and a half million dollars. In 1973, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the combined ministries for “fraud and deceit,” charging that the church was insolvent and could not redeem the bonds when they came due. In court, the judge absolved the church of intentional wrongdoing, and the S.E.C. lawyers dropped the words “fraud and deceit” from their complaint. Falwell thereupon declared a great victory. The church, however, had admitted in the course of the trial that one of its bond prospectuses was inaccurate and that its general ledgers were incomplete. The financial affairs of the church were put in the hands of five prominent Lynchburg businessmen; that is, into what was for a nonprofit institution the equivalent of receivership.\n\nOn assuming responsibility for the finances of the Thomas Road ministries, the businessmen found that the scant records the church did have were in a state of confusion. In the next three years, they instituted proper accounting procedures, cut overhead costs, let a number of “Gospel Hour” administrators go (including Falwell’s brother-in-law), and, perhaps most important, adopted a cost-effective system for buying radio and television time. “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” had been buying “packages” of air time almost at random from brokers, when the tried-and-true system for evangelists was to persuade a local group to finance the purchase of air time on a local station for thirteen weeks and drop it if contributions did not then cover the cost. Between 1973 and 1977, “Gospel Hour” revenues rose from seven million dollars a year to twenty-two million, and in May of 1977 the committee of businessmen was able to retire most of the church’s unsecured indebtedness and hand the management back to Falwell and his staff.\n\nThree years later, the church was again in financial trouble. Its balance sheet for the fiscal year ending in June of 1980 showed that it had assets of forty-one million dollars, of which thirty-six million were sunk into property, plant, and equipment; it showed mortgages and liabilities amounting to nineteen million dollars. In August of 1980, the church borrowed three and a half million dollars more through a bond issue. Its ability to service its debt depended entirely on Falwell’s ability to bring in money, particularly through “The Old-Time Gospel Hour.” In the fiscal year 1979, he had brought in six million seven hundred thousand dollars above operating expenses—sufficient funds to service the debt. But in the fiscal year 1980 “Gospel Hour” income did not increase as much as expected, and the operating expenses rose, giving the whole organization a net of only three million eight hundred thousand dollars. Since the church had few assets apart from its own buildings and grounds, the whole enterprise of the Thomas Road Church began to look shaky.\n\nHow the church could have got into such debt when its total revenues had continued to rise each year—from twenty-two million two hundred thousand dollars in fiscal 1977 to fifty-one million in fiscal 1980—was an interesting question. In 1973, when the businessmen took over the organization they made an extensive investigation of its bank accounts—personal and institutional—and found no evidence of hanky-panky. What they did find—in addition to a lack of any financial management—was deficit spending, on the one hand, and a great deal of waste and inefficiency, on the other. Some in Lynchburg therefore concluded that the organization had simply fallen back into its old ways. “Jerry’s always criticizing the government for overspending,” a businessman close to him said. “But he is the biggest deficit spender of them all. There’s no end to what he would like to do, and he doesn’t know how to say no to anyone.”\n\nThe theory concerning deficit spending bears some examination, for Falwell is clearly an ambitious man, who is always out ahead of himself, his vision always exceeding his present possibilities. He himself has rather proudly said that he has never had the money to complete any project that he began. He founded Liberty Baptist College in 1971, when the church was millions of dollars in debt; and last summer, when it was in the throes of a new financial crisis, he was talking about putting up a new church building for ten thousand people, a college for fifty thousand students, and apartments for thousands of elderly people. Clearly, Falwell would like to do everything at once. But what he actually does with his money is the real point at issue.\n\nFigures from Falwell’s organization show that “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” raised about a hundred and fifteen million dollars in four years—fiscal 1977 through fiscal 1980—and that virtually none of this money went toward the operating expenses of the Thomas Road Church; the local congregation paid for most of the church’s expenses with tithes. In those four years, Falwell put a total of sixteen million dollars into the construction of the L.B.C. campus, and each year he put about two million dollars into the operating expenses of the college. The bulk of the revenues, however, went back into “The Old-Time Gospel Hour,” for its own operations.\n\nSo in the scheme of things Falwell gave a rather high priority to “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” and a rather low one to the comfort and education of his college students. As the businessmen who took over his organization found out, although “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” is the fund-raising arm and the vehicle for further expansion, it was the college that attracted a sizable percentage of the contributions. The businessmen had wanted to close the college for prudential reasons but had found that, for the same prudential reasons, they could not. As a result, the college had two entirely independent existences for its first six years—one on paper, the other in reality—and the students fell into the gap between the two. Falwell advertised the college on television. He sent out a catalog with a picture of what seemed to be a bosky campus; one of his books of the period pictures students playing basketball in a gymnasium. When the students came to Lynchburg—first three hundred, then a thousand, then two thousand strong—what they found was a series of dilapidated rented buildings scattered around the city. There was no campus (the catalog photo was of a city park), no gymnasium (the college used gyms belonging to a public high school and to Lynchburg Christian Academy), and, for the first few years, no library. (Falwell’s students used the Randolph-Macon and Lynchburg College libraries until there were complaints about their attempts to proselytize other students.) Some of the students took pride in their ability to survive these hardships, but others left. Finally, in 1977, Falwell was able to begin the construction of the campus, and the students were finally installed on it. When I was there last summer, however, the campus consisted mainly of a collection of prefabs made of cinder block and metal sheeting. Since then, a few new buildings faced with brick have been added. Those students who live on campus must sleep on bunk beds, four to each tiny room.\n\nWhether one judges the “Gospel Hour” to be an efficient operation or not depends on whether one categorizes it as a direct-mail business or as a church. In fiscal 1979, for example, when its receipts were thirty-five million dollars, its operating expenses were nearly twenty-six million dollars. The fund-raising vehicle itself spent more than five dollars for every seven dollars it earned. Of course, many of those who send in money are contributing to the program itself. Thus, the cost of air time—nine million dollars in fiscal 1979—and the cost of production are the very objects of their charity. But in fiscal 1979 “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” spent nearly eleven million dollars for direct mail and promotion. It had other administrative costs, which included the payroll and employee benefits for some eight hundred people. Falwell himself makes only forty-two thousand five hundred dollars a year in salary, but his organization pays a number of his expenses—including the maintenance of his twelve-room house (deeded to the church by a wealthy businessman) and the cost of a private jet. Therefore, Falwell’s contributors, in 1979, paid roughly forty cents of every dollar they gave for administrative costs.\n\nThere is no evidence of any illegality in these practices. Still, Falwell’s organization has engaged in certain transactions that most businesses and nonprofit institutions would avoid. In the fiscal year 1980, it bought a million and a half dollars’ worth of gift offers and other materials from a company whose president was a member of its own board, and it also borrowed a million dollars from a board member. It currently employs an agency run by Falwell’s brother-in-law to buy its media time. All these transactions may have worked to the advantage of “The Old-Time Gospel Hour”; there is some evidence in each case that they have. But that is surely not true of a decision made in the summer of 1979 to transfer all the health-insurance policies for “Gospel Hour” employees from Blue Cross/Blue Shield to a “Christian” company that turned out to be inadequately financed and had been legally barred from doing business in another state. Another company now handles those policies.\n\nThere may be no illegality within the Falwell organization, but there is very often a disquieting difference between what Falwell says is happening and what is actually going on. In October of 1979, for instance, Falwell informed his supporters through his newspaper and by direct mail that he would have to take “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” off the air “unless God definitely shows me that he wants us to continue in this media.” Therefore, he wrote, “I am putting out the fleece.” (He carefully explained that the reference was to Gideon and the salvation of Israel.) He asked for fasting and prayer and six and a half million dollars. When a reporter questioned him about the announcement, Falwell said, in effect, that he had exaggerated a bit—that he did not intend to take the program off the air but merely to reduce the number of stations from which he bought air time; and that the six and a half million dollars represented only a million dollars more than “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” had brought in the previous October. In November, Falwell announced that he had raised the six and a half million and the crisis was over.\n\nWhether or not Falwell actually raised all of that money, the crisis was not over; it was just beginning. He had called a moratorium on further construction of the L.B.C. campus in October—at the time of the crisis call—and it remained in effect until July of 1980. Yet in 1980—and this was yet another indication of his priorities—his expenditure for air time actually increased. “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” picked up some fifty television stations last year, and in addition Falwell produced three television specials and bought air time for them on two hundred stations around the country. Also, in the spring of 1980 he spent two million dollars to buy the entire shopping plaza in which the “Gospel Hour” offices were situated.\n\nIn June of 1980, Falwell refused to pay sixty-seven thousand dollars in local real-estate taxes owed on the land occupied by L.B.C. but owned by “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” which was not, for these purposes, tax-exempt. When the city dunned him for the unpaid real-estate taxes, he told his congregation that the city was discriminating against the Thomas Road Church and that he would not pay “until all churches and colleges in Lynchburg pay taxes”—a phrase suggesting that the land belonged to the college or the church. Around the same time, the chief executive officer of “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” told the local press that the church owned no property of enterprise in Lynchburg not “involved in the ministry of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.” At that time, however, “The Old-Time Gospel Hour” was leasing space to a supermarket, a gift shop, and a restaurant-bar in the shopping plaza that contained its offices.\n\nFalwell’s financial troubles—and the confusion that he creates around them—can be understood only in the context of the relationships that exist between him and his congregation and between that congregation and the outside world. In 1979, the dean of the Liberty Baptist Seminary resigned after a doctrinal dispute with Falwell. When, in the course of the dispute, Falwell questioned his administrative abilities, the dean angrily responded that it was Falwell who was the poor manager, creating financial crisis after financial crisis. He also accused Falwell of running a dictatorship. The last accusation was a curious one for the dean to make, since fundamentalist churches are generically dictatorships. Most Baptist churches—including most of those which belong to the Southern Baptist Convention—are governed by their lay members; they have deacons or committees of laymen to oversee the finances of the church and to hire and are the pastors. But independent Baptist churches are run by their pastors. Falwell has always run the Thomas Road Church, and he has always insisted on his own absolute rule. In a sermon titled “The Day of Great Men Has Not Passed,” he said, “God’s plan is that His flock is to be led by shepherds, not run by a board or a committee.” He explained:\n\nGod never intended for a committee nor a board of deacons nor any other group to dominate a church or control a pastor. The pastor is God’s man, God’s servant, God’s leader. When you tie the hands of God’s man, when you keep him from acting as the holy Spirit leads him, you have murdered his initiative, you have killed his spirit.\n\nThis system of governance might seem out of place in a church that democratically assumes that anyone can attain salvation without the intervention of the pastor. But just as fundamentalist theology posits the absolute authority of the Bible, fundamentalist moral doctrines posit the absolute authority of pastors, teachers, fathers, “civil authority,” and so on. In “God’s chain of command,” there are no relationships of equality but only superiors and inferiors, authority and obedience. While fundamentalist theology exists quite independent of individual pastors, individual pastors do tend to impose their own personal authority.\n\n“This Jim Jones thing haunts everyone,” Jackie Gould told me. She was the second person in Falwell’s congregation to bring Jones’ name up to me. The first was a professor who worked with the Moral Majority. “Imagine a spectrum that runs from a Jim Jones cult on the one hand to the most arid of liberal churches on the other,” the professor said. “Well, some of the big fundamentalist churches in the South would fall close—dangerously close—to the Jim Jones end of the spectrum. I know because I used to belong to one of them. I got out, but it was a terrible culture shock. The question is, of course, where Dr. Falwell’s church would fit in this spectrum. It is one of the religious kingdoms of the South. But in my view it is one of the most liberal and progressive of them.”\n\nIt is true that Falwell’s church is nothing like a Jim Jones "
