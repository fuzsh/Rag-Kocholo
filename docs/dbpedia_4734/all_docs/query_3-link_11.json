        "text": "On May 1, 1990, Christian parents from across the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia gathered and decided to launch Blue Ridge Christian School, a parent-owned, non-denominational Christian school. That very night 43 students were registered in the newly formed school. The summer of 1990 was full of excitement as these same dedicated parents secured teachers, searched for a building, enrolled students, and hired the first administrator. Just two weeks before classes were scheduled to begin, the doors opened for Blue Ridge Christian School (BRCS) to purchase the vacant former Bridgewater Elementary School. Parents and faculty worked side by side to clean and paint classrooms before the first day of school. On September 10, 1990, BRCS began the school year with 80 students in grades Kindergarten through 7th."
