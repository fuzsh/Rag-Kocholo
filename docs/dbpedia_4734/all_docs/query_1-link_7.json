        "text": "The support and aid my son has received exceeds what other programs could ever compare to. I am able to use his strengths to help him exceed in a homeschooling environment. Blue Ridge Academy allows parents to design a structure in the home tailored to fit the student and that is something worth applauding.\n\nElizabeth (Parent)\n\nThanks to Blue Ridge Academy, I received the support and resources to be able to educate my son in the best way to develop his passions and talents, while also supporting his developmental needs. It's the perfect fit because he can learn at a pace that is suited for him, and also have the social connection with peers that have similar interests and learning needs.Lexia (Parent)\n\nBlue Ridge Academy provides us a priceless educational experience which allows us flexibility to customize our learning processes. Being able to watch my children's successes and struggles has given me the ability to be the best possible teacher for them. We are teaching them how to think critically and not just going through the motions to memorize and repeat. I wish I had this opportunity throughout all my years of schooling. Dawn (Parent)"
