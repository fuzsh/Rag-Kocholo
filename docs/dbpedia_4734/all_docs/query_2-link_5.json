We honour the Indigenous People who have tended and cared for it.\n\nWe acknowledge that we meet on the traditional lands of the Wadawurrung people. They are the first people to have lived in this region and the custodians of this area.\n\nWe pay our respects to their leaders past & present and extend that respect to other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who are present."
