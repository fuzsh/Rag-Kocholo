        "text": "Support Dominion Ridge\n\nWhether you’re volunteering to tutor our students learning a new language, on the planning team for one of our special events, or helping to raise funds for our great programs, we rely on your involvement and support.\n\nAnd your investment of time and resources pays dividends that last a lifetime for our students.\n\nGive to Dominion\n\nThe mainstay of Dominion Ridge Academy’s fundraising is the annual fund. Contributions to this fund are raised and spent during the current fiscal year to offset operating costs.\n\nTo donate to this fund, contact our Director of Development (540-635-6799) or select an option.\n\nArchery Hits the Mark\n\nHenry Thoreau said, “In the long run, you only hit what you aim at.” For members of the Dominion Archery team, this is twofold.\n\nNot only are they aiming at the target, they’re aiming at becoming better with each practice and tournament.\n\nMusicals\n\nLights! Music! Action! Every year the Drama Department at Dominion Ridge Academy presents a musical that results in annual standing ovations and celebrations of student talents.\n\nMore often than not students who are least likely to speak out in class find their voice on the Dominion stage.\n\nThe Center for Cognitive Formation\n\nEquipped with new scientific data and a strong belief in the human spirit Dominion is taking a fresh look at how students learn.\n\nSince its inception, Dominion Ridge Academy has been committed to the spiritual, moral, and intellectual development of its students.\n\nFrom Our Head of School\n\nWe respect that you make an investment when you choose to enroll your child in private education. We are excited that you are considering Dominion. We know that the reasons vary for choosing Dominion to teach your child the necessary skills for an ever-changing world.\n\nBecause we recognize the needs are different for the 21st century learner, we are continually evolving to not only meet those needs, but to exceed them so that your investment in your child’s education results in the best opportunities for your child.\n\nDominion Ridge Academy\n\nDominion Ridge Academy is a PreK – 12th grade non-denominational, independent, private Christian school in Front Royal, Virginia, that focuses on the education of the whole child.\n\n“And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” – Mark 12:30-31\n\nDominion Ridge Academy provides a holistic approach to education.\n\nAll children, from vulnerable to gifted, do more than learn in the classroom. They also learn how to transfer that learning to their everyday life.\n\nDominion Ridge Academy is the model school for the Center for Cognitive Formation, focusing its philosophy of education on cognitive modifiability and social-emotional learning.\n\nDominion Ridge is committed to the spiritual, moral, and intellectual development its students. Our interest is always in your child.\n\n“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” – Jeremiah 29:11\n\nCompetence\n\n“That the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.” 2 Timothy 3:17\n\nDominion Ridge provides a holistic approach to learning, where we believe it is so much more than just curriculum or a set of tests, where serving our neighbors is a priority, and our interest is always in the child – each child. For this purpose, the approach Dominion Ridge takes towards education is unique.\n\nWe focus on how a child learns more than what a child learns. Once students learns how they learn, they become self-managers of their own learning – and thus independent, lifelong learners – which is our goal for each student at Dominion.\n\nThe education of Dominion Ridge students starts with training our teachers in a therapeutic approach to the classroom. Our teachers receive professional development in both cognitive modifiability and social-emotional learning.\n\nConfidence\n\n“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” Philippians 4:13\n\nThrough service learning, Dominion Ridge graduates students who are empathetic, collaborative, reflective, and involved.\n\nService learning actively involves students in a wide range of experiences, which benefit others and the community, while also advancing the goals of the Dominion Ridge curriculum. Service learning comes to life through the Dominion Ridge missions program which begins in preschool and the lower grades with outreach to the local community and grows towards high school students participating in annual trips supporting disaster relief efforts. Through service learning, students transfer their knowledge of loving their neighbors to actively serving the needs of those in need.\n\nWe believe each child comes to Dominion Ridge with his or her unique, God-given purpose and it is the school’s responsibility to support each child to reach their full potential, ultimately becoming the best version of themselves.\n\nBelonging\n\n“My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.” John 15:12\n\nAll Dominion Ridge students, from the gifted learner to the vulnerable learner come together in an inclusive environment. Inclusive classrooms are places where educational barriers are removed and students of all abilities are educated. Dominion Ridge believes in honoring each student’s unique learning requirements.\n\nDominion Ridge believes that inclusion goes beyond vulnerable learners to ensure that all learners are included. Dominion Ridge developed its Center for Cognitive Formation (CCF) inside the school as a lifeline to students needing one-on-one support. CCF provides educational and social-emotional therapy, executive functioning coaching, and other support to its students.\n\nDominion Ridge educators and administrators are trained and dedicated to engaging a range of learning styles and creating an environment where students not only learn from the daily curriculum but also daily from each other.\n\nThe Center for Cognitive Formation: A Fresh Look at How Students Learn\n\n10 percent of the Dominion Ridge student body receives individual support through The Center for Cognitive Formation.\n\nThe other 90 percent experience and benefit from what it means to be a part of an inclusion program where everyone is considered a vital, contributing member of the school.\n\nThe dignity of each child is respected."
