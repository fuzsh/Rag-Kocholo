        "text": "God’s first recorded actions are as Creator (Artist). As we are created in His image, He has given each of us gifts to reflect that to the world. Visual art electives help students develop their gifts and appreciation for God’s role as our Creator by exploring how art integrates all other aspects of their academic and personal lives.\n\nThrough visual arts at BRCS, students can find a sense of belonging, develop passion for their craft, and cultivate purpose in using their talents for God’s glory. Students gain a deeper understanding of who Christ is and grow their desire to serve Him through their unique giftings.\n\nMiddle School Art\n\nMiddle School Art focuses on the study of different artists and teaches students to critique using art terms. Students further their knowledge of the Elements of Art: line, color, shape, value, form, space/depth, and pattern. They also study various artists and art history and discuss different styles of art. As they progress through the program, students continue with the Principles of Design: balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, pattern, rhythm, and unity/variety.\n\nHigh School Art\n\nArt I, II, and III applies all they’ve learned about the Elements of Art to create projects that explore a wide variety of media. As they progress through the program, students focus on 2-D and 3-D art using art history as inspiration. Students have the opportunity to focus on specific media and techniques of personal interest to develop a portfolio.\n\nGallery Shows: Each spring K-12 selected student art is on display at the Park Gables Gallery in Harrisonburg\n\nPhotography\n\nPhotography I & II (High School) begins with the basic elements of a photograph, like color, line, pattern, texture, and depth-of-field. As students expand their understanding, they learn the fundamentals of operating a DSLR camera and will be introduced to photographic styles and to the art of storytelling via photography. Some class periods are spent walking to various locations in the Dayton area to practice photography techniques.\n\nFashion Design\n\nFashion Design I & II (High School) begins with understanding pattern drafting and recognizing flattering styles for different figure types. Students learn and practice basic sewing machine and hand sewing skills. As they progress through the program, they create original designs for themselves. They learn five art principles and how to justify that their original designs are artistic compositions. Additionally, they practice essential workplace readiness skills.\n\nGallery Shows: Each spring K-12 selected student art is on display at the Park Gables Gallery in Harrisonburg"
