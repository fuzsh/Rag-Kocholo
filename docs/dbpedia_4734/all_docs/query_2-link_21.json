[Insert Photo of a ribbon cutting ceremony.] Caption: Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nuñez, FDOT, and partners cut ribbon on transformative bridge. (Photos: FDOT)\n\nKennedy Space Center and Merritt Island are more accessible after the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) recently opened the eastbound span of the new NASA Causeway Bridge over the Indian River Lagoon. A ribbon-cutting took place on June 9, 2023 — over 100 days ahead of schedule — and was attended by Florida Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nuñez and representatives from NASA, FDOT, and Space Florida.\n\nThe next phase of the $126 million, five-year project has already begun, with construction crews currently dismantling and demolishing the old bridge, which has stood in place since 1964. The work is expected to take between six and eight months. Once that has been completed, crews will begin the construction of the westbound span, which is slated to be completed by January 2026. During this interim period, the eastbound span will be set up to accommodate two-way traffic over the causeway.\n\nAt the ceremony, Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nuñez recognized the importance of this project to the state’s long-term success stating, “This year, the Space Coast is projected to host close to 100 launches, further cementing Florida’s position as the Launch Capital of the World. With surging demand across the commercial aerospace industry, we are committed to improving infrastructure to accommodate space payloads making their trek to launch pads. This NASA Causeway Bridge will meet the demands that ensure Florida remains the global hub for all aerospace activity.”\n\n“This project is a perfect example of FDOT’s commitment to serving and working with our local communities to meet their vision for the area and their transportation needs,” said FDOT Secretary Jared W. Perdue, P.E. “These bridges not only improve the transportation for [spacecraft] and payloads but also increase safety and connectivity for motorists driving on top of it and marine traffic using the waterway below it.”\n\nSpanning 4,025 feet over the Indian River Lagoon and rising 65 feet above the water, the new double high-rise fixed bridges will be taller and wider and will provide greater clearance for waterway traffic below, eliminating the need for a drawbridge. The wider lanes and uninterrupted traffic flow will significantly improve accessibility to the corridor encompassing the Kennedy Space Center and the Cape Canaveral Spaceport.\n\n“The road we are standing on today is more than a bridge – it is a critical artery that supplies the lifeblood to our mission,” said NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Director Janet Petro, who attended the ribbon cutting. “Kennedy’s mission is to provide continuous access to space from Earth’s premier spaceport using creativity and innovation, and in many ways, this bridge is a representation of that spirit.”\n\nThe completion of the NASA Causeway Bridge project underscores Florida’s dedication to the aerospace industry and the more than 150,000 jobs it supports. By investing in robust infrastructure that accommodates the demands of modern space activities, Florida aims to harness the full potential of the space industry.\n\nFrank DiBello, President and CEO of Space Florida, also attended the ribbon-cutting and remarked, “To harness the full potential of the space industry, it is critical that we invest in robust infrastructure that supports the demands of modern space activities.” DiBello further stated it is his belief the new causeway bridge will serve as a “powerful enabler, facilitating the flow of resources, talent, and ideas between the mainland and the spaceport complex.”\n\nThe $126 million NASA Causeway Bridge project was made possible through a partnership between FDOT, NASA, and Space Florida, utilizing a combination of state and federal funding.\n\nFEATURES\n\nSigns of the Times\n\nCity's New LED Signs shine bright.\n\n[Photo of the new City Hall LED sign at night. Insert photo of the sign during manufacturing.] Caption: One of the new Titusville LED signs during fabrication at Kendal Signs based in Rockledge.\n\nAs Titusville continues to experience an exciting period of growth. The city recognized the need to replace the outdated and no longer functioning LED signs in front of City Hall and next to the fire station. Over the years, the signs began to show their age and break down. It was up to the Community Relations Division to spearhead the project of replacing and upgrading the signs. As part of the bid process, the team sought out the expertise of various sign manufacturers before ultimately selecting Kendal Signs—a locally renowned company based in Rockledge, FL. With its solid reputation, extensive experience, and impressive client roster, Kendal Signs was the perfect choice for Titusville’s much-anticipated signage upgrades.\n\nEstablished in 1996 by Kendal Mullen, Kendal Signs has grown into Brevard County’s largest sign manufacturer. The company’s success can be attributed to its commitment to quality craftsmanship and customer satisfaction. Over the years, Kendal Signs has developed a reputation for delivering exceptional signage solutions, earning the trust of numerous clients throughout Florida and across the country.\n\nKendal Signs boasts an impressive portfolio of clients, highlighting the company’s ability to handle projects of varying sizes and complexity. Some notable clients include the World Equestrian Center, KSC Gateway, Northrop Grumman, Planet Play, iMax Saturn Rings Display, Parrish Medical, Publix, and the recently opened BB Rads.\n\nKendal Signs is a Florida State Certified Sign Contractor whose manufacturing plant is MET Laboratories approved and inspected. These qualifications help put their clients at ease as they know they will provide high-quality products designed and fabricated to rigorous, exacting standards.\n\nCommunity Relations submitted several design concepts to the City Council at a public meeting. A discussion ensued, including some input from the public present. With the City Council’s approval, a design was selected and approved for construction. Community Relations Department worked closely with Kendal Signs; to bring these ideas to life. The team submitted sketches and concepts to Kendal Signs, who transformed them into impressive technical illustrations for final approval.\n\n[Aerial photo of a crane truck lifting a sign into place.] Caption: Kendal Signs installs the sign at Fire Station 11.\n\nFabrication of the signs began at one of the two Kendal Signs manufacturing facilities in Rockledge. The structure was fabricated from aluminum, and the logos and lettering, and backlit accent were cut and formed from acrylic material. After consulting the Kendal staff, a decision was made to install the 6mm pixel pitch for LED panels on the message board. Once painted and tested, the sign was ready for installation.\n\nInstallation of the sign began on April 6th of this year. Crews arrived that morning with both signs on a flatbed trailer and carefully hoisted them into place. The new LED signs were installed and running by the end of the day. Once in place, the Community Relations staff realized that the back of the signs would be an excellent place to add more valuable information for pedestrians.

Appropriately, the reverse side of the fire department’s sign includes Titusville’s first fire truck, a 1925 La France, and the Fire Departments’ vision, mission, and values statements. Kendal Signs provided the enhancements and no extra charge.\n\nTitusville’s new LED signs provide the city with another method of communication with its citizens, informing them of the latest events, like Lunch in the Lot, Red White and Boom, or upcoming workshops and hiring information, as well as emergency conditions affecting the city.\n\nTitusville’s new signs represent the City’s continuing commitment to communicate, inform and educate the public during this booming growth and modernization of our city.\n\nCanine Colleagues\n\nBring Your Dog to Work for a Pawsitive Office Environment.\n\n[Photo of a woman and her dog at work.]\n\nKendal Signs has embraced a pet-friendly workplace, allowing employees to bring their furry companions to work. This forward-thinking approach has created a warm and welcoming environment, benefiting employees and customers as the pets walk freely in and out of the offices and the warehouse area.\n\n[Two photos of dogs at the Kendal Signs office.]\n\nDuring our site visit the presence of pets with their wagging tails created a real sense of relaxation.\n\n[Kendal Signs logo.]\n\nPage 10 Talking Points / July 2023\n\nFEATURES\n\n[Graphic of a soldier saluting, on a background of a waving US flag.]\n\nServing Those who Served\n\nDisabled American Veterans (DAV) is a national organization that helps over 1.1 million veterans each year. Created in 1920 by a group of World War 1 veterans, the DAV assists veterans and their families to access health and disability benefits; and provides various other assistance to serve those who have served our country.\n\nThe organization offers its services at no cost to the veterans. Last year, the DAV helped to file over 150,000 claims for benefits, along with providing veterans over 7.6 million miles in no-cost rides to medical appointments.\n\nThe DAV is also a parent organization to the Disabled American Veterans Auxiliary (DAVA). Founded in 1922, the DAVA is a community service program dedicated to volunteerism with veterans and their families. Units put on programs to adopt veterans for special holidays, backto-school efforts for children of the deployed, assistance with errands, respite for caregivers, and general aid. The DAVA operates hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics across the country. With over a quarter-million members, the DAVA offers diverse programs including Americanism, community service, junior activities, legislative, and VA voluntary services.\n\nThe DAV Mission Statement\n\nWe are dedicated to a single purpose: empowering veterans to lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity. We accomplish this by ensuring that veterans and their families can access the full range of benefits available to them, fighting for the interests of America’s injured heroes on Capitol Hill; and educating the public about the great sacrifices and needs of veterans transitioning back to civilian life.\n\nThis mission is carried forward by:\n\nProviding free, professional assistance to veterans and their families in obtaining benefits and services earned through military service and provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and other agencies of government.\n\nProviding outreach concerning its program services to the American people generally and to disabled veterans and their families specifically.\n\nTitusville’s Chapter\n\nDAV Chapter 109, located on North Singleton Avenue, is dedicated to helping the disabled veterans of the space coast. Their goal is to provide a safe place and helping hand to their community; regardless of age or era served.\n\nEstablished in 1972, the chapter has been serving for over 50 years. Chapter 109 is directed by Commander John\n\n{Continued below.}\n\n{Continued from above.}\n\nDunn, who served in Aviation Ordinance for 20 years. Commander Dunn has compassion to help fellow veterans, and is an active Chapter Service Officer.\n\n“We are always looking for more ways to help veterans,” says Commander Dunn. “We need YOU to come in and share your experiences and ideas on how we can meet the needs of today’s veterans and their families.”\n\nChapter 109 serves over 400 members in Titusville with the aid of their Service Officers. The chapter currently has 13 officers, all of whom are unpaid volunteers. Along with assisting with claims, they also operate a service office at 435 North singleton Avenue which provides a place where veterans can always feel welcome. The facility is home to several activities, including community meals, weekly BINGO nights, and regular fellowship with other veterans.\n\n“Monday is our busiest day by far,” says Heidi Pennington, title. “Members are always coming in to grab a bite to eat, get assistance, and use the BINGO machines.”\n\nAll Service Officers attend annual training and are DAV certified. The officers provide several services, including the operation of the DAV/VA Shuttle to help veterans get to medical appointments, processing and management of donations, operation of cold night shelters, facilitating events such as spaghetti dinners and movie nights, and paying home visits to those in need. They also visit nursing homes and hospitals, and provide music therapy for veterans struggling with PTSD.\n\nThe DAV is always looking for donations and volunteers!

The supplies used for the project, such as plants, soil, mulch, and planters, were all donated by Lowe’s of Titusville.\n\n[Photo of landscaping supplies.]\n\nOver the course of a few days, volunteer staff from Lowe’s, as well as members of the DAV, Titusville Garden Club, and the local boy scouts, came together and assisted in transforming the DAV grounds.\n\n[Photo of volunteers doing landscaping.]\n\nThe beautiful new landscaping is now complete, offering a warm welcome to visitors of the DAV center, which serves so many in our community.\n\nFEATURES\n\n[Photo of roofers rappelling off a tall church roof, removing shingles.]\n\nLengthening Ropes, Strengthening Stakes\n\nFacility improvements herald in new and exciting times for local church and school.\n\nIf you’ve driven down South Park Avenue over the past several months, you’ve probably noticed some changes happening on the Park Avenue Baptist Church campus, most notably, people suspended from repelling lines or a large crane replacing the roof on the unique sanctuary building. Coupled with the brand-new digital message board sign along the roadway, the church complex — which also houses Park Avenue Christian Academy — has been undergoing improvements inside and out for the past few years. Recently the academy began its own expansion and improvements to better serve the students of Titusville and North Brevard.\n\nThe academy has been experiencing a significant increase in demand for enrollment in recent years. To accommodate this growth in student registration, the church and school decided to expand and add more classrooms and teachers. In an interview with Dr. Brian McKinney, the Headmaster of Park Avenue Christian Academy, he discussed the changes made over the past few years, as well as its outlook for the future.\n\nFounded in 1978 as Park Avenue Baptist School — a ministry of Park Avenue Baptist Church — the academy teaches students ranging from VPK (Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten) through 8th grade and has historically held class sizes to a smaller number, averaging about 36 students per graduating class. With the notable increase in demand for enrollment, the school decided to increase the class size to 64 students, requiring them to utilize every available space on campus.\n\n[Photo of the new church roof.] Caption: The new roof on the Sanctuary building, installed by Wescon Construction.\n\n[Photo of the church's new LED monument sign.] Caption: PABC’s new LED digital monument sign at the entrance to the church campus.\n\n“When I got here [in 2016], we had 335 students and now we’re at 540-something students and still growing,” said Dr. McKinney, or “Dr. Mac” as he is affectionately known by nearly everyone. “At the end of 2028, we’ll have 640 students.”\n\nStarting around 2021, the school began formulating plans based on the previous five years of growth, determining that the available classroom space on campus wasn’t sufficient. The solution the planning team devised was something that public schools have utilized for decades: portable classrooms.\n\n“When we looked at the process through 2028, we knew we would need to add 13 more portables,” Dr. Mac explained. “So, we formulated a plan of action. Instead of doing them one at a time, we’re doing them in groups as needed. The first group of portables landed last year [October 2022] and we will be having five VPK classes in them.”\n\nTeachers have already moved in and the classrooms are now ready for the start of the 2023-24 school year. The additional eight portables are slated to be installed and ready by August 1, 2024.\n\nPortables aren’t the only improvement happening on the campus. An all-new playground is being constructed featuring equipment painted in the school’s colors and manufactured by GameTime of Longwood, Florida. The equipment has already been fabricated and is waiting for sidewalks to be poured as well as landscaping improvements between the middle school building and the church’s Retreat Center.\n\n“We’re hoping for the last week of July. But everything’s contingent on the weather, and of course, getting the concrete,” Dr. Mac said as he\n\n{Continued below.}\n\nFEATURES\n\n{Continued from above.}\n\nunfurled renderings of the planned playground which features a rocket ship climbing frame. “Because we’re in the space capital of the world, we have a rocket ship. That’s one of the items the kids will climb on — a rocket ship.”\n\n[Graphic rendering of a new rocket-shaped climbing frame.] Caption: The rocket ship climbing frame that will be a part of the academy's new playground.\n\n[Graphic rendering of a blue slide and jungle gym.} Caption: One of the slides to be installed on the new playground, painted in the school's colors. (Renderings: GameTime / PACA)\n\nThe steady growth each year has brought also brought academic enhancements to the school. A Media Academy was started featuring state-of-the-art audio-visual and computer technology, including an e-sports arena. There is also a new performance band program starting this school year that will be headed up by Jim Matthews, former band leader and teacher at Jackson Middle School. The school has also recently hired four new teachers to meet the students’ needs.\n\n[Photo inside a multimedia game room with multiple monitors and computers.] Caption: Park Avenue Christian Academy’s E-sports Arena which is part of he school’s Media Academy. (Photo: PACA Facebook)\n\nLooking ahead to the future, Dr. Mac expressed hope and optimism for the school he’s overseen for over seven years. When asked about any plans to expand the academy into secondary education someday, Dr. Mac expressed his desire to see another Christian high school in Titusville.\n\n“I would love to see another Christian high school in Titusville. Obviously, Temple Baptist Church has one,” he expounded, “but I believe there is a growing need for an additional Christian high school in Titusville and North Brevard.

The ‘Titusville’ is positioned slightly forward to symbolize that the Titusville Playhouse is leading the way in developing quality cultural events for our citizens and visitors,” says Steven Heron, Executive Artistic Director.\n\nIn addition to a new brand, the playhouse launched a new website on June 19th.\n\n59th Season has something for everyone!\n\nSpeaking of leading the way…..this season has shows that are being presented for the first time at a community theatre in Brevard (The Prom), and the first time in Florida (Beautiful, May We All). In addition, the theatre is collaborating with the Moore Cultural Center Board of Directors to produce the story of Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore. The special event will occur over one weekend only in mid-October and will feature a one-act original play followed by a talk-back with actors and experts on the Moore legacy.\n\n[Poster with a painting of Harry T.

You want it to be the best. A place for you and your family to put down roots and grow. A community that you are proud to call home. You depend on us to provide efficient and reliable city services. To meet that need, we have made a big change in our city organization. We have combined two of our most integral community service departments, Water Resources and Public Works, into one unit: The New Public Works Department.\n\nThe New Public Works Department will provide all of the municipal day-to-day services you expect and enjoy. Your water service, street repair, sewer service, traffic light maintenance, garbage service, and stormwater service will be coming from one department — One department focused on providing you and your family with efficient service, ease of contact, and improved response. Over the next few months, we will be updating our web pages, signage, etc. to reflect this change.\n\nWe look forward to serving you in the future.\n\n[Photo of a city worker tending to a fire hydrant.]\n\nRoad Resurfacing Update\n\nFor Fiscal Year 2023 approximately 6 miles of roads were resurfaced in the City.

The Business Trespass Program requires a simple registration with Code Enforcement, which will in turn provide law enforcement officers with information on business contacts.\n\nEach business completes a blanket trespass affidavit along with details on who is allowed on the property after hours. When a business registered in the program requires assistance, law enforcement is notified and officers can respond promptly to address the issue due to the valuable information previously provided by the business via the Business Trespass Program initiative.\n\n[Photo of a No Trespassing sign on a chain link fence.]\n\nIf you are a Titusville Business owner and would like to participate in this program please call 321-567-3770 or go to https://titusville.com/2712/Business-Trespass-Program-and-Affidavit\n\n[Titusville Police silver logo.]\n\nCode Enforcement - Promoting Teamwork within our community – 1100 John Glenn Blvd., Titusville, FL 32780 — PH 321-567-3770\n\nThe City of Titusville Code Enforcement Department has recently implemented an interactive reporting tool, Prepared Live.\n\nPrepared Live is a system that provides real-time video or photographs of a scene to a Code Enforcement Specialist, allowing them to immediately visualize a situation with real-time access and an immediate GPS location of the incident. When a caller is reporting an in-progress code violation, issue, or concern they can opt to get an immediate text on the cell phone they are calling from with a provided link. If the caller chooses to click on the link, they can immediately hold up their phones and send live video to the Code Enforcement Specialist.\n\nWith enhanced situational awareness, Prepared Live assists our Code Enforcement Department to work more efficiently across the board and focus on what they do best, enforcing municipal land development and property maintenance codes in an effort to eliminate conditions that threaten the life, health, safety, and general welfare of residents. The system gains vital real-time information directly from mobile devices, which can then be immediately communicated to responding Code Enforcement Officers. This will drastically improve the communication of descriptions and details of an active incident. In addition, any video obtained can then be downloaded to evidence storage instantly. However, it is important to note, that once the caller hangs up, all contact with the phone is lost. This was an important step for the developers of this software for privacy purposes. Once the caller hangs up, Code Enforcement has no contact whatsoever with the caller. Prepared Live is a focused effort by the City of Titusville Code Enforcement Department to provide the highest level of service to citizens.\n\n[Photo of Titusville Code Enforcement trucks outside the police department.]\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\n[Titusville Fire Department logo.]\n\nTitusville Fire Department\n\n550 S.
