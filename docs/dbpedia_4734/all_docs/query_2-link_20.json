        "text": "Set in a Christian halfway house, Abby Rosebrock’s “Blue Ridge” (at the Atlantic Theatre Company) is a recovery story that dispenses with the dramatic trope of relapse. Nobody falls off the wagon or gets rushed away in an ambulance as onlookers sob. Rosebrock, a thirty-two-year-old Brooklyn-based playwright and actress who grew up in South Carolina, keeps her characters committed to their newfound sobriety, which isn’t to say that they are blessed with untroubled minds. Her subject is healing, the queasy, fragile calm that follows the storm of addiction and abuse; she’s interested in the ways in which damaged people try—or don’t—to fix themselves by untangling the harm that they’ve done from the harm that has been done to them. Who is really at fault for our failures? Should we blame God? Society? Genetics? Or must we invariably point the finger at ourselves?\n\nAlison (an electric Marin Ireland) knows exactly who’s responsible for her problems: men. We’re in the living room of St. John’s Service House—the best halfway house in southern Appalachia, according to a search she did on Yelp—which looks as if it were last redecorated during the Carter Administration, although a wide picture window offers a soothing glimpse of trees through slatted blinds. It’s a Wednesday evening in September, time for weekly Bible study. Alison, a thirtysomething former high-school English teacher, is the program’s newest arrival, and Grace (Nicole Lewis), its co-director and den mother, has asked her to introduce herself with a verse of Scripture. But Alison doesn’t really go in for the God stuff. Instead, she offers two Carrie Underwood songs, sacred texts that she can actually relate to: “Jesus, Take the Wheel,” in which a woman whose car is spinning out on a highway prays for divine intervention, and “Before He Cheats,” whose narrator, forsaking Jesus’ teachings, destroys her fickle lover’s truck, an act that Alison finds justifiable. “Well, by this point in life, all the accumulated pain an’ hopelessness an’ annihilatin’ degradation uh bein’ a woman in this sexual economy’ve juss . . . racked the speaker’s brain and body, like a cancer,” she explains. (Rosebrock’s script is written in a regional twang that looks jarring, even patronizing, on the page but rolls easily off the performers’ tongues.) “Frankly, she doesn’t know how to surrender those fillins to Christ anymore.”\n\nThis is more than a close reading of some country-and-Western lyrics. Not long ago, Alison herself took an axe to a Honda owned by the principal of her school, a mentor who reeled her in romantically and then jilted her. That’s why she’s stuck at St. John’s, selling aboveground pools and doing community service as part of a court-mandated rehabilitation, instead of in her classroom at Blue Ridge High, a rough school that she nonetheless adores. She doesn’t have substance issues, just a major rage problem and a diagnosis of “intermittent explosive disorder,” though she claims that her lawyer made that part up; it’s too difficult to admit that, like an addict, she suffers from something she can’t control.\n\nAlison has learned to cover her fear and neediness with a brash, mouthy manner that seems to spell trouble, but she’s welcomed by her St. John’s cohort: Wade (Kyle Beltran), an easygoing, guitar-strumming optimist who’s kicking a pain-pill habit, and the openhearted Cherie (Kristolyn Lloyd), a recovering alcoholic and a former teacher herself. They choose to see Alison’s whiplash mania as high-spiritedness, and extend her their friendship—no small thing for this prickly, lonely woman. Alison saves her suspicion, and her sass, for Hern (Chris Stack), the program’s other leader, a handsome, hangdog pastor. “He gives off a smell,” she tells Cherie. “Kinda masquerades as sensitivity, but bespeaks a deep unexamined dysfunction.” When a new resident, Cole (Peter Mark Kendall), arrives, Alison is quick to typecast him, too: poor white hillbilly conservative, probably a woman-hating homophobe. Protectively hunched over on a couch in baggy jeans and a beanie, Cole does look the part; he reminded me of the kind of pasty, silently seething boy who might take up a tiki torch after watching too many alt-right videos on YouTube.\n\nIn fact, Cole turns out to be gentle and a little slow, and he, too, is nursing a terrible psychic wound. Alison, scrupulously committed to denial, can’t see it at first, but Cole recognizes her as a kindred spirit, damaged and desperate for real love, the kind that comforts the soul. St. John’s, as Grace likes to remind the residents, is a safe space, but Alison can’t feel fully safe anywhere, because her greatest threat comes from within. One night, while the others are meditating outside (it’s that kind of place), she stays in to fold laundry. Cole enters to get a jacket and sees her beating her head with her fists, crying out in agony, “Why did you make me like this?”\n\nLater, considering this wrenching scene, I thought of Milton’s formulation of free will, in “Paradise Lost,” in which God says that he made humankind “sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.” Why did you make me like this? Cherie, Wade, and Cole all follow the Twelve Steps, which call for participants to put their will and their lives in the care of God, presumably a benevolent God with a plan. But Alison has been left to fall too many times by too many people to believe that God has any interest in catching her now.\n\nThere’s a lot of tenderness and friendly understanding in this play—maybe too much. Its success depends on Ireland, who is perfect in the role, bawdy and bristling, talking a mile a minute as she lashes her lanky body around the stage. Her performance has an element of slapstick, and Taibi Magar, the play’s director, makes smart comic use of her, as she does of the rest of the strong ensemble cast, playing up the quick, humorous volleys of Rosebrock’s script without letting us lose sight of Alison’s pain. Collective female anger has got so much good press lately as a galvanizing force for political change that it is jolting to be reminded how ugly and crippling the emotion can be for a woman experiencing it in isolation.\n\nThe freedom to act freely means the freedom to screw up royally, a theme that Rosebrock touches on in the play’s second half, when things, somewhat predictably, go to pieces. After Alison sniffs out the emotional attachment that is developing between Cherie and Hern, who has a girlfriend he seems unwilling to either love or leave, she confronts him, and, through him, every man who has persuaded her to open up and then let her down. She’s right to call Hern out, but it’s not her job to do so. Cherie is furious when she discovers that Alison has been interfering behind her back. Race is at play in this fraught dynamic; Cherie, like Grace and Wade, is black, and she doesn’t want her white friend to secretly advocate on her behalf. She needs to own her choices, especially the ones she is most likely to regret.\n\nThat’s what it means to recover, and here Rosebrock is saying something worth listening to about women and victimization, even if she hasn’t entirely worked through it. “Thass not yer fault, thass men’s fault,” Alison tells Cherie. She means everything: pain, rage, sadness, fear. That may be true more often than not—certainly, it feels good to believe it—but to be faultless all the time is to be helpless, too, with no ability to heal oneself. In a devastating scene late in the play, Alison and Cole, brought together by shock and mutual need, manage to briefly connect, only for Alison to initiate the kind of rote, transactional sex that she has earlier complained is dehumanizing to women. She understands what it is to be debased but can’t see Cole clearly enough to grasp that he can also be humiliated. That kind of power—to damage a man the way that men have damaged her—is exactly what Alison has been chasing, and, when she finally gets it, it leaves her feeling hurt, small, and profoundly alone. ♦"
