        "text": "A Story of a Special Friendship between Two Sons & Their Fathers\n\nTwo class of 2021 ECS alumni and teammates since fourth grade are both headed to the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament this week, Kam Jones with Marquette and Thomas Kizer with Samford. The friendship forged on the courts of AAU tournaments did not end with their last game as ECS seniors at the Tennessee State Division II-A Final Four. It continues today, as this seemingly unlikely pair encourages one another to live out the faith lessons their coaches and dads imparted to them.\n\nHow It Started\n\nBasketball introduced Kameron Jones, currently a leading scorer for the Marquette men’s basketball team, and Thomas Kizer, who last year earned a coveted spot as a walk-on at Samford, when they were just 10 years old. Kam and Thomas got to know one another when they played on the same AAU basketball team, the War Eagles team coached by Thomas’ dad, Dr. David Kizer. Kam’s dad, Kevin, joined the team as an assistant coach.\n\nThe Joneses\n\nAir Force Master Sargent Kevin Jones, a maintenance management analyst, grew up in South Memphis where he was a standout on the baseball diamond at South Side High School. He noticed early on that his son’s interest was in basketball. When Kam was just one year old, he would sit beside his dad and watch basketball on TV for long stretches of time. At age two, Kam accompanied his dad to the YMCA while Kevin and his coworkers played basketball, his dad stopping the game occasionally to change the two-year-old’s diaper. While other children played made-up games together in the gym, Kam watched intently as his dad and teammates played basketball. Kevin took his son to the gym nearly every day when he was three, and they would dribble and shoot the ball. That year, Kevin coached a four-year old team at the YMCA, and he gave his three-year-old son a jersey.\n\nAs he noticed Kam’s natural skills in basketball develop, Kevin asked around for the best place for his son to play competitive basketball in Memphis. He was directed to Memphis Athletic Ministries where Kam played for the Memphis Kings in early elementary school. Then he was referred to the War Eagles organization, whose reputation for producing players who went on to great collegiate and professional success was well documented. At first, Kam played on a War Eagles team that was a year older than he was. The next year, Kevin thought it was time for Kam to play with his own age group. Kam’s coach recommended that he play for Dr. Kizer. Kevin didn’t know this coach, but he was assured he was in good hands.\n\nThe Kizers\n\nDr. David Kizer, a dentist, who is married to current ECS board member Kathleen Campbell Kizer (’89), grew up playing basketball for the War Eagles under its founder, Dr. Van Snider. David was a star basketball player at a Christian school called SBEC, now known as Northpoint, then went on to play basketball at Union University. In 1993, after David had completed dental school, his old coach came calling. Looking to pass the baton of leadership in the War Eagles organization, he approached David and his friend Frank Harris to head up the organization. David felt inspired to follow in his coach’s footsteps.\n\n“From an early age, I always had a huge passion for basketball,” David said. “I loved watching the Tigers play and loved playing and coaching. I also have a passion and love for the Lord. Because (the War Eagles organization) was founded by Bellevue and Dr. Snider who used basketball to bring kids to Christ, it was a perfect way to combine my love for the Lord and basketball. It was an amazing blessing for me to be able to combine the two passions for over 30 years now.”\n\nPart of David’s joy in coaching basketball was getting to coach his son, Thomas, from age 9. “It was an awesome experience and an incredible blessing to coach my son,” David reflected. “The memories we made traveling to all of those tournaments for many years is something I’ll never forget. They are lifelong memories.”\n\nA Friendship of Two Father-Son Duos\n\nWith both dads coaching their sons, the many practices, games and out-of-town tournaments meant these four spent a lot of time together. While the dads strategized the game plan, the sons spent time hanging out, telling jokes and of course, playing basketball.\n\nThomas remembered Kam as a nice, funny guy who he enjoyed being around when they were kids. His favorite memories with Kam revolve around playing basketball in the Kizers’ driveway when they were young. “We would play one-on-one and pretend were in March Madness. It’s cool to come full-circle, and we both have that opportunity before us.”\n\nThomas admits those driveway contests got intense. In fact, rather uncharacteristically, Thomas bit Kam in one particular competitive play. “On the court, I was trying to keep up with him. That made me better, and I hope it made him better.” Thomas joked, “My main goal was to try not to get embarrassed. If I can go against him, I can go against anybody.”\n\nKam laughed remembering that time Thomas bit him. “Thomas is very competitive, and he wants to win everything he does. I’ve always appreciated that about him. That’s the type of person he is.” Kam also appreciates Thomas’ humor and says he loves to crack jokes. On a serious note, he added, “Thomas is the epitome of his dad, the way he carries himself.”\n\n“Thomas and Kam gravitated toward each other,” Kevin remembered of his young son and his friend. “They loved each other. Thomas was like Kam’s balance – not too playful, just enough.”\n\nThe respect between these two families extends to each dad. Kevin said, “Coaching with Dr. Kizer that first year gave me another aspect of coaching. He never yelled, never cursed, never demeaned an opponent and never yelled at a ref, yet he was able to coach the kids and get them to run through a brick wall for him. At that age, to get a kid to play that way, it changed the way I coached.\n\n“The personal relationships he formed with the kids and their parents and the way he used basketball as a way to connect with those kids was something I hadn’t seen before,” Kevin added. “Going through that together for years, there was a bond between us. During games, he would know what I was thinking, and I would know what he was thinking. I’d get subs ready before he asked me for them.”\n\nDavid agreed. “Fortunately, we were always on the same page from a basketball standpoint, and he was great at making recommendations for in-game adjustments. David added, “Also, he was not the typical AAU dad just wanting to promote his son. He always wanted what was best for the team. But more importantly, he was very committed to bigger issues such as promoting high character, discipline and integrity. He supported me, and I always knew he had my back. We did our best to help build a spiritual foundation for Kam and Thomas, and then it was incredible to pass the torch to ECS coaches Terry Tippett and Willie Jenkins who really took their spiritual growth to new levels and challenged them in amazing ways. I'm forever grateful for that.\"\n\nAn Uncommon Friendship Based on a Common Faith\n\nDavid explained how the War Eagles organization is unique. “From the beginning, the War Eagles organization was based on a biblical foundation using basketball to teach about Christ and life.” Every time they traveled, the team ended each night with a team devotion. Prayer preceded every game and practice, and coaches aimed to live out their faith by showing good sportsmanship and in the way they conducted themselves on the court and on the sidelines.\n\n“During the seven years I coached Thomas, just about every player on the team came to Christ,” David said. “The annual National Tournament was a week-long tournament, and we would share the gospel with them the whole week. On the last night, I would give a clear gospel presentation and give them a chance to accept Jesus. Kam came to the Lord during one of those tournaments.”\n\nKam remembered that night. “It was at an AAU Nationals in fifth grade that I gave my life to Jesus Christ. I’ve always felt and known that there was a God. I remember being curious at that age about Him. Dr. Kizer put it out in a very simple way for us to understand it. I remember my dad was sitting next to me. That was pretty special.\"\n\n“The things that stood out to me are the stories that (Dr. Kizer) told. There is one story I think about very often, probably four to five times a week now. He told us about a man who was very wealthy, and in that town, there were a bunch of people that were very poor. People asked the rich man, ‘How much is enough for you?’ and he replied, ‘Just a little more.’” The point of the story was that the things of this world – success, fame or wealth – will never truly satisfy us. Only a personal relationship with Christ can truly fulfill us and give us peace and joy. Kam understood this message and realized a true need for Christ.\n\nKam explained that because of NIL opportunities, the lesson of that rich man is often on his mind. “I don’t want to have that type of spirit in me. I want to be able to help others and help the community. That’s what I think about very often.”\n\nThomas thinks the coaches did a great job of pouring into the players spiritually. “The coaches told us about the gospel, but they also really lived it out in how they coached us and how they encouraged us. Looking back on that, it makes me want to have the same joy and character that the coaches had.”\n\nDr. Kizer also led a Bible study with emphasis on biblical dating for his War Eagles team and for members of the eighth grade ECS boys basketball team. “I wanted to bring our ECS players and the AAU players together,” David said. I wanted to lay a foundation with these guys as they entered high school. One day basketball would end, but hopefully, each will find a godly wife for life.”\n\nThomas was already a student at ECS when Dr. Kizer and Thomas started encouraging Kam to join him at ECS in the ninth grade. Kevin put the ball in his son’s court to decide where he would attend high school. Kam remembered, “My dad was like, ‘It’s on you.’ Having a relationship with Thomas, I chose ECS.”\n\nKam, who went on to be ECS’ all-time leading scorer and its first Tennessee Mr. Basketball, said, “My experience at ECS was great. There are great people I formed great relationships with who call to check on me to this day. I’m very glad Thomas encouraged me to go to ECS.”\n\nKam remembers the transition to ECS in ninth grade was challenging at first. The academic rigor and pace were more difficult at ECS. Also, going from a public school with mostly black students to a private school with mostly white students was a different experience, but Kam said it wasn’t long before he felt at home.\n\nIn the first year, Kevin observed that Kam was unsure of himself and didn’t want to go to the football games. But by the time he was a senior, he was running with the flag on the football field before a game. “Kam loved ECS. It wasn’t just school,” Kevin said. “It was an experience for him. He continued to grow spiritually which was great. It prepared him academically for college. There were a lot of genuine people and great kids like Thomas. It was meant for him. It all fell into place.”\n\nHow It’s Going\n\nKam Jones is a household name in college basketball, having earned All-Tournament Team honors in this year’s Big East Tournament and multiple Big East Player of the Week honors as a junior. In his two previous seasons at Marquette, he earned Big East All-Freshman Team honors, and as a sophomore, he was named to the Second Team All-Big East. He is a scoring threat from inside the paint to outside the perimeter as an all-time top 10 three-point shooter for the Golden Eagles, which is headed into the NCAA Tournament for the third straight year, this year as a two-seed.\n\nKam’s success is no surprise to Dr. Kizer, who has coached four NBA players and more than 50 D-I college basketball players in his 30-plus years of coaching. “Even from a young age, he was a phenomenal shooter. Kam was the best shooter I ever coached, and his basketball IQ was off the charts,” Dr. Kizer said. “Recently one of the commentators called Kam a ‘basketball savant.’ I could see that in fourth and fifth grade. He is so much smarter and knew the game and strategy so well. It is so much fun watching him grow in college, and guys calling college games see that as well.”\n\nHis AAU coach added that Kam has a team-first mentality. “Sometimes shooters can make it all about them, but he is not a ball hog; he shares the ball.” David noticed in college that Kam’s passing and defense have both improved. “He is committed to the team, and he is someone who can make his teammates better. He is a great team player.”\n\nAt Samford, Thomas earned a sought-after spot on the men’s basketball team after serving as the team manager in the two previous seasons. His job on the scout team is to make the starters better, like what he did for Kam back in his own driveway. Thomas is apparently doing his part well as the team earned its first berth into the NCAA Tournament since 2000 by winning the Southern Conference Championship. “I show up and practice like everybody else, but don’t get in the game.” Thomas admits, “I feel like it’s hard to keep your head up sometimes. But when the team is being successful, that’s all you care about.”\n\nKam’s encouragement has meant a lot to Thomas as they continue to keep in touch in college by calling and texting each other. Kam knows how badly his friend wanted to be on the team those first two years, and he has told Thomas he’s proud of him for making the team and keeping his head up.\n\nLikewise, Thomas is proud of his friend’s success, and he and his dad were excited to fly up to Columbus, Ohio to watch Kam play in the NCAA Tournament last year.\n\nThe fact that the friendship of those two sparring boys pretending to play in March Madness on the Kizers’ driveway a decade ago continues today is no wonder to their AAU coach. “Having that bond of Christ together helped Thomas and Kam develop a deeper relationship not just based on basketball but based on Christ,” David said.\n\nAfter their sons graduated ECS in 2021, David and Kevin were asked by then Coach Willie Jenkins to coach the Eagles freshman boys basketball team. Work and traveling to Kam’s games made it difficult for Kevin to continue in this role, but David still coaches the freshmen and serves as an assistant to the varsity team under Coach Tim Wise, who incidentally, David grew up with playing basketball.\n\nDavid still heads up the War Eagles organization but no longer coaches its teams and is proud to help coach with his old friend who became the ECS varsity head coach in the past year. David said, “Tim is an amazing basketball coach and developer of men. He loves the Lord, and he is committed to growing godly men. It is the same legacy we built at the War Eagles, and he carries it on at ECS. He teaches values like life, character and integrity. The biblical focus has been amazing and something I want to be a part of.”\n\nYears after his son graduated, it's not surprising to see Dr. Kizer continuing to spend his time discipling young men on a basketball court. “Men like Dr. Snider had a profound impact on me. Seeing how he poured his life into coaching AAU basketball for 42 years – the extra way he poured into those guys – he was an amazing example of how it should be done. He set a great example for me, Kevin, Coach Harris and others. Hopefully some of these young guys coaching teams will do the same things we’ve done.”\n\nNow both juniors in college, Thomas reflected on his friendship with Kam and the experience they shared with their dads as their coaches, “I think it was really special. That has been a special bond.”\n\nKam added, “I love basketball mainly because it’s a beautiful thing and it’s just fun. It brings people together from different backgrounds. An example of that is Thomas and me.”\n\nKevin agreed. “There will always be a relationship there. The Kizers have been here for my family more than basketball. It hasn’t just been about basketball. There is a friendship and a bond there that will forever be there that is really special.”\n\nLater this week, Kam and Thomas get the chance to make their 10-year-old dreams come true in the NCAA Tournament. Basketball may have brought these two seemingly unlikely father-son pairs together 12 years ago, but it is their common bond in their shared faith in Jesus Christ that keeps them close.\n\nAn Inspiring Story of Perseverance\n\nIn a world where only 5.6% of high school baseball players advance to play in college1 and a staggering .03% of Little Leaguers make it to the major leagues, Brent Rooker is living proof that big league dreams do come true!\n\nAfter three years of trying to get his big break — bouncing back and forth between the majors and minors, getting traded twice and claimed on waivers — Brent continued to work while waiting for his opportunity. In 2023, Brent earned an everyday spot in the lineup with the Oakland A’s and on July 11, 2023, made his MLB All-Star debut!\n\nBrent grew up in a baseball family. His dad, Terry, played catcher for the University of Memphis, and coached Brent from tee ball and coach-pitch through youth competitive baseball until he was 14. After playing in tournaments every weekend, Brent and his teammates always wanted to play more. They would go to nearby tennis courts and play there, all with dreams of playing in the big leagues one day. “We could never get enough of it,” Brent said.\n\nHaving dad serve as coach can be tricky for many children, but Brent loved it. He remembered,\n\n“My dad did a great job coaching and never put too much pressure on us. He made sure that if it was something we were going to pursue, that we were going to work at it adequately while at the same time keeping it fun.”\n\nAt ECS, Brent enjoyed great success as a three-sport athlete. In his senior year of high school, he played in three state championships in football, basketball and baseball. As quarterback, he set 18 school records by piling up more than 3,300 yards in total offense with 33 touchdowns and was named a 2013 Tennessee Mr. Football finalist. Brent helped lead the Eagles baseball program to two state championships, one as a sophomore and the other as a senior. As a senior baseball player, Brent set the state tournament record for home runs in a game and home runs in a tournament. That season, he hit .430 with 37 runs, 32 RBIs, 23 stolen bases and nine home runs.\n\nOther favorite memories Brent has at ECS include his relationships with teachers and coaches.\n\n“All three of my head coaches: Coach (Geoff) Walters, Coach (Ryan) Porter and Coach (Terry) Tippett were all just fantastic men, coaches and leaders. They are guys who I loved playing for and learned a ton from.” Brent also enjoyed Mr. V’s chemistry class and Coach Durham’s English class. “Mr. (Mark) Brink and Coach (Noah) Brink are two really special people that I had great relationships with. I met with Coach Brink once a week for a Bible study for the last three years of high school, and he had a pretty profound impact on me. I think that’s one of the most special parts of ECS - the relationships you form with teachers and how personal those relationships are. They are people I still keep in contact with today, and I think that’s my favorite part of the ECS experience.”\n\nIn 2013, Brent signed to play baseball at Mississippi State. He had impressive seasons as an underclassman, but nothing compared to his junior year.\n\nWith a standout 2017 season at Mississippi State, Brent was named Collegiate Baseball National Player of the Year and SEC Player of the Year after leading the conference with a .387 batting average, 23 home runs and 82 RBIs, winning only the second triple crown in SEC history. Add to that a .495 on-base percentage, .810 slugging percentage, 30 doubles and 18 stolen bases in the same season. He was also a Golden Spikes Award finalist and the recipient of the C Spire Ferris Trophy, given to Mississippi’s top college baseball player. As a fun way to cap off his impressive collegiate career, Brent starred in the College World Series Home Run Derby at TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nNot surprisingly, Brent was a first-round draft pick in the 2017 MLB Draft, selected as the 35th overall pick by the Minnesota Twins. He was first assigned to the Elizabethton Twins in rookie ball, which was a stark contrast to playing in the SEC. “You go from playing against Ole Miss and LSU in front of 10-12,000 fans to playing in very small towns in front of 40-50 fans. The difference in playing three to four games a week to playing every single night is pretty stark as well, and you have to adjust to that.” His stint there was short, just three weeks, before he was promoted to the Single-A Fort Myers Miracle.\n\nBrent continued to have success as a power hitter in the minor leagues. He played for the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts in 2018, and in 2019, he was promoted to Triple-A where he was distinguished as an International League All-Star while playing for the Rochester Red Wings. Brent was selected to the United States national baseball team in the 2019 WBSC Premier 12. There, he was selected to the All World Team as the best designated hitter in the tournament, batting an impressive .300/.333/.800 including three home runs and five RBIs in 20 at-bats.\n\nBrent’s stats soared. But still no appearance in the big leagues.\n\n“There have been several times I questioned how long to continue,” Brent admitted. “I played very well in Triple-A but wasn’t really getting any opportunities to play in the big leagues. I always felt like I was good enough to do so and just needed the right opportunity and the right team to get me those looks. I was spending all this time away from my family, and I was missing my wife and kid. I wondered if it was worth being away from them if it’s not going to pay off and come to fruition. But my family kept encouraging me, and I actually continued to have the belief myself that I was good enough.”\n\nOn September 4, 2020, Brent finally had his chance. He was promoted to the major leagues for the first time and made his MLB debut in a Twins uniform against the Detroit Tigers.\n\nA memorable highlight of his time with the Twins included hitting his first major league home run in Busch Stadium, where he grew up cheering for his favorite team. Originally from the Midwest, Brent’s dad grew up a Cardinals fan and passed his enthusiasm for the team onto his children. The Rooker family traveled to this stadium nearly every year to watch the Cardinals play. “To hit my first home run there was pretty special,” Brent remembered.\n\nBut his stint in the major leagues didn’t last long.\n\nWith a solid lineup, the Twins bounced Brent between the major league club and the Triple-A club until he was traded to the San Diego Padres on April 7, 2022. Then on August 2, the Padres traded him to the Kansas City Royals. Finally, on November 17, 2022, he found a fit with the Oakland A’s.\n\nBrent has shined this year with the A’s. He landed on a team that gave him the opportunity he needed to show his strengths. After the first half of the season, he led the A's in home runs with sixteen. He was named the American League Player of the Week on May 1, 2023 after going 10 for 24 with five home runs and 11 RBI’s in the previous week. “I just needed an opportunity, and I was able to take advantage of that, and it’s been fun,” Brent said.\n\nThen mid-season, his All-Star selection was announced. Perhaps no one was more surprised than Brent himself. \"As a 27-year-old, spending most of last season at Triple-A, this seemed like a far reach, but here I am. The All-Star Game didn't cross my mind until last Sunday when they told me I was in it,\" he told an ESPN reporter the week of the All-Star game in Seattle.\n\nIn an All-Star announcement that was shared on social media, Mark Kotsay, A’s general manager, revealed the big news that Brent was selected to the team in the locker room, commending his perseverance through all of the years of work, grinding on four different teams. Kotsay pointed out that Brent received the second highest number of votes by players to be an All-Star designated hitter, second only to Shohei Ohtani. Overwhelmed with emotion, Brent described the moment as “surreal. It really was. Making the All-Star team wasn’t really anything I ever considered was possible, to be honest. To have that happen and to find out like that was a surreal moment. It’s still even hard to believe even after it happened.”\n\nThe All-Star game and events surrounding it exceeded Brent’s expectations. He said, “The league did a great job putting it on.” He enjoyed spending time with the guys he always played against but hadn't had the opportunity to get to know very well.\n\nAnd the game didn’t disappoint. When Brent got his opportunity at the plate, he pelted a ground-rule double to right center field. That All-Star debut at-bat wasn't a bad way to say hello to a festival of the world’s most elite baseball talent.\n\nPerhaps what made it most special is sharing this memorable time with his family. His wife, Allie Oliver Rooker, also a graduate of ECS (’12) and their two-year-old daughter, Blair, made appearances with him on the red carpet and were announced on the field. “Having Blair around while I’m playing is definitely one of the coolest things that I’ve gotten to experience. Being able to bring her on the field before the game, having her on the field for the Home Run Derby and the All-Star game, getting to watch her run around the bases postgame – it’s something you can’t really describe.”\n\nHe credits his wife, Allie, his high school sweetheart, for her tremendous support and encouragement over the years. He admits that baseball season is probably harder on her than it is on him because he is gone so much during the season. Allie travels sometimes eight to nine hours with a two-year old to see Brent play in different cities. “Allie is fantastic,” Brent said. “I know it is difficult, but she makes it work, and I love her for it.”\n\nThe entire Rooker family – incidentally, all ECS alumni – made the trip to Seattle in July too: parents, Terry and Lynne Tipton Rooker, (classes of '87 and '86), brother Josh (’17) and sister Alden (’19). Even his grandfather was able to come. Brent said, “I wouldn’t want it any other way than for them to experience it with me. I am definitely glad they were able to make the trip.”\n\nSo after all of the hardships, the what seemed like endless Triple-A play and multiple trades to teams all over the country, what does Brent think about when he realizes he is living his childhood dreams?\n\n“I take a moment,” Brent reflected. “I look back and think about that 10- or 11-year-old version of myself and how happy that guy would be that I made it here and that I’m doing what I love and doing what I always dreamed of. It makes it a little easier to stay motivated, to keep working and to keep grinding and get through those hard times because it’s well worth it.”\n\nThrough the ups and downs of baseball, Brent’s faith keeps life in proper perspective. “You may have a rough night, but you can’t let it define you,” Brent said. “You can’t let a rough stretch define you. You can’t let sports as a whole define you. It’s just something you do, and it doesn’t determine the kind of person you are. It doesn’t make up your identity. Our identity first is as Christians, as followers of Jesus, so that’s always the most important thing. Knowing that helps to make the failures a little easier to deal with, and it helps to keep things in perspective during the successful times as well.”\n\nHis subjects have ranged from Apple CEO Tim Cook to Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett to famous American actor Chuck Norris.\n\nHis credits include the top national and worldwide publications: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Business Week, Travel + Leisure, Garden & Gun, Golf Digest and Zeit Magazin (published in Germany).\n\nUndoubtedly, Houston Cofield’s resume is impressive. He uses his art form of photography to document the key influencers of our time – and more importantly for him – he writes his own narrative of the American South.\n\nOne could say that it all started at the ECS Eagle’s Eye newspaper in 2006.\n\nBut perhaps it really started three generations ago.\n\nHouston’s paternal grandfather and great grandfather were studio photographers in Mississippi and photographed renowned Southern author William Faulkner throughout his life.\n\n“Having that in the background growing up was really special. I was never planning on being a photographer, but I find it kind of ironic that here I am doing the same thing now.”\n\nWhen he was a child, Houston wanted to be an archeologist. He enjoyed digging in his backyard and even dug up his dog’s bones, which disturbed his mom who kindly suggested they could have belonged to a dinosaur. Houston noted, “What I was interested in as a kid carried over into what I’m interested in today: looking at the unseen, looking at something in plain sight and seeing it in a new way. The discovery of that process is something I think a lot about.”\n\nIn his junior year of high school, he started shooting photos for the Eagle’s Eye, which he joined with an ulterior motive. In his quest to avoid study hall, he discovered that he enjoyed making photos, not photos of sports like most of his peers did, but photos of plants, flowers and chain-link fences. “I started to realize I loved framing these things in a rectangle and looking at the way light hit an object. That’s when I first started taking it a little more seriously and realized I have a real interest in it.”\n\nHouston’s interest in storytelling was fueled by his high school English teacher, Jonathan Sherrod, who only taught for one year because he would enter medical school the following year. Houston remembered him saying, “‘I am not a teacher. But I like English, and I like reading.’ I really appreciate how straightforward he was. He led the class out of his own interest and curiosity. That’s what made the class so special. I look back and as a freshman, he got me interested in fiction, storytelling and writing. I don't think he knows how much of an impact he made on me.”\n\nAfter he graduated ECS in 2008, Houston studied journalism at the University of Mississippi as a way to pursue his interest in writing and storytelling. It wasn’t long before he realized the tool through which he wanted to tell stories was the lens of a camera. Specifically, he wanted to shoot magazine editorial photos for feature stories – more on the artistic end of making pictures. He took magazine editorial classes, and for inspiration, he started studying photographs in The New Yorker, Bloomberg Business Week and Garden & Gun, among others. He added art classes to his curriculum and minored in art with a photography emphasis.\n\nWith a penchant for formal study of his craft, he then pursued his Master’s of Fine Arts in photography at the University of Illinois in Chicago.\n\n“That’s where my career took a turn,” Houston reflected. “It pushed me in the direction I needed to be going. I caught up to speed very quickly surrounded by people who are my mentors and close friends.” In his studio, he honed in on photography as an artistic form.\n\nFollowing school, he worked for a prominent photographer in Chicago and assisted in shooting pictures which included tasks from carrying gear to setting up lighting to printing his work. “Being in Chicago was probably one of the best things for my career. It put me in the community of like-minded artists to help me see what was possible and pushed me to be really good at what I do. It opened the door and opened my eyes to what is possible in this career,” Houston recalled.\n\nAfter living in Chicago for a few years, his wife, Kristen, completed graduate school, offering a natural fork in the road: stay in Chicago or return home to the South. Even though Houston had an opportunity to stay, the couple chose to return home to Memphis to be close to family and friends.\n\nHouston began working for the Memphis Daily News, now called the Daily Memphian. He did some photojournalism and took portraits of people in the business sector, building his portfolio. “I had free creative reign.” He added, “I love making something bland interesting.”\n\nIt wasn’t long before a colleague referred him to the New York Times. In his first assignment for a national publication, he took photos of the musicians who accompanied Isaac Hayes. “Those were some of the best pictures I ever made.” Houston remembered, “Sending in work I thought was good and hearing that affirmation was really reassuring.” Houston got five assignments that week because they were so pleased with his work.\n\nFrom there, he got work from Garden & Gun, Bloomberg Business Week and The New York Times Magazine. “A lot of the magazines I have been inspired by I have now gotten to work for,” he noted. More credits include A&E Network, The Wall Street Journal and Time Magazine.\n\n“I have been fortunate to work for the people I have always wanted to. It is always a good challenge and involves problem-solving.”\n\nSome of these people include a few of the most successful individuals in the world: Apple CEO Tim Cook and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet. Then in Texas, Houston took photos of Chuck Norris for A&E Network.\n\nPerhaps his most memorable assignment was making pictures of Harold Primat, former professional racing driver and investor. Primat offers a three-day luxury excursion known as the Primland Racing Experience at his Auberge resort called Primland. Guests enjoy driving high performance race cars with him at the Virginia International Raceway, golfing, fine dining and helicopter rides. “I have always had an interest in cars,” Houston said, “and I got to meet someone who is the best at that.”\n\n“Photography has allowed me to be around people who are the best at what they do. Having a camera has given me access I wouldn’t otherwise have,” Houston said. “It is a fun and exciting part about this career.”\n\nAs glamorous as some of these assignments have been, Houston is most interested in making photos that tell the story of the American South. “Moving away from my home gave me an appreciation for the culture of both Memphis and Mississippi. I’m very interested in the myth and culture that surrounds the South, like what Faulkner wrote about the South and Mississippi. In a similar vein, I look at what I’m photographing as my own narrative that I’m constructing and giving that some sort of platform whether I photograph people that I find interesting or a building on the side of the road. I am very curious about adding my own narrative to this culture that has already been so surrounded by myth and storytelling.”\n\nTragically, part of his narrative includes the senseless and still unsolved murder of his father, Glenn Cofield, in a possible robbery attempt as he and his wife, Natalie, were leaving a charity event in June 2019. Glenn, a financial services executive and civic volunteer, was well-known and loved in the ECS and Memphis community.\n\n“How does that affect me personally and as an artist? That’s what I’m trying to draw out in photography. Rather than me looking at the work, I’m turning inwards, and that story is now part of my story. It’s a different narrative – a narrative about grief, sadness and darkness.”\n\nWhile he hesitates to call photography therapy for him, Houston said, “The work I made around my dad’s death has made me label or pay respect to the grief that I felt and the grief that I continue to feel. In some ways, it’s a direct response to the grief. When you lose someone close to you in a traumatic way, it is unlike anything else. It is hard to describe how awful it feels, but that feeling to me is important to, instead of avoid it, confront it. I don’t think of grief as a negative thing but a necessary thing in the whole process of losing someone. Making work around it made sense to me.”\n\nUsing photography in the process of grieving his father’s death has meant making photos of concrete subjects that reflect his feelings, such as photos of rotten fruit from a forgotten but well intended gift basket published in the March 2022 issue of Memphis Magazine. Those images served as a metaphor for grief. Most times, however, photographing through grief involves making photos of common subjects but with a different, more inward perspective.\n\nHouston intends to publish a collection of his photography into a book centered around grief. While he doesn’t have a release date yet, he does think the work is close to being completed. He is not motivated by sales of the book and admits that most photography books are not lucrative. His motivation for publishing is simple, as he said: “I want it to exist in the world.”\n\nUsing the gifts he has developed and the perspective he wishes he didn’t have, in this book, Houston will take a big step toward fulfilling his goal as a photographer – adding his own narrative to the story-rich culture of the American South.\n\nAt ECS, our Lower School program is growing exponentially, which is why plans are currently underway to open a new Lower School campus at the Shelby Farms location beginning 2023-2024. We think it is appropriate to honor a foundational leader in our Lower School program.\n\nMrs. Marilyn Wray, former ECS lower school principal who served ECS for 31 years, was honored with a reception at the Lower School campus last spring as a part of the Grandparents Day presentation. Many of Mrs. Wray’s former teachers and students were present to celebrate her many years of dedicated service to ECS. Head of School (at the time) Braxton Brady honored her at the conclusion of the program and presented her with a plaque to honor her leadership in helping to lay the foundation for our Lower School program.\n\nBut Mrs. Wray did not always set out to be an elementary school principal.\n\nIn 1950, Mrs. Wray graduated from Humes High School. She received a scholarship to attend Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College) where she studied English. While there, she met her husband, Red Wray, a Navy pilot. The couple married in February 1954, and she graduated from college three months later.\n\nHer first job was working in the bridal registry at Goldsmith’s Department Store which she quickly realized was not for her. She decided to pursue teaching and received her emergency certificate to teach by the end of summer. She interviewed with the superintendent of the city schools, and he offered her a sixth grade teaching position at Sherwood Elementary where she taught for two years.\n\nThen, she taught at Presbyterian Day School for six years. When her son, Andy, was born, she became a stay-at-home mom. She earned her Master of Education from the University of Memphis shortly after Andy was born. Her daughter, Lynda, was born two years later.\n\nAs her children got older, Mrs. Wray became interested in teaching again. In 1973, she joined ECS as a fifth grade teacher. There was an opening for the elementary school principal the following year, and then-Headmaster Doug Petersen asked if she would be interested in filling that role. She was surprised by that offer and said she would talk to her husband about it. That’s when she learned that her husband was in on the plan; in fact, he had told Mr. Petersen that he already had his principal in Marilyn.\n\nFor 30 years she filled that role. During her tenure as principal, ECS had four separate campuses around Memphis: Union at Lindenwood Church, East on Poplar Avenue, North at Dellwood Church and the Park Avenue campus. Some of her favorite memories include days in which she made appearances at all four campuses for Field Day and Awards Day.\n\n“I stayed in my car a lot,” Mrs. Wray remembered. “I always tried to attend chapel and faculty meetings at each of the four campuses.” During those years, ECS opened and closed campuses 14 times.\n\nField Days formed some of Mrs. Wray’s favorite memories. “I always wanted the kids to be looking toward (middle school together at) Macon. All elementary students arrived at the Macon campus on buses wearing different colored t-shirts representing their campuses. The elementary campuses were separate, but we were one,” Mrs. Wray said.\n\nFor many years, elementary students from all campuses would also play basketball together on winter Saturdays at the Macon campus in what was known as Saturday League. Mrs. Wray explained “the bubble” that used to cover the gym at that campus, similar to the temporary bubbles used to allow for winter swimming at some outdoor swimming pools today. She recalled the time the bubble leaked heavy rain onto the gym floor. She laughed, “We had probably the only basketball game cancelled due to rain!” That is when leadership decided it was time to raise funds for a new, more permanent gym structure.\n\nMrs. Wray believes that having shared activities such as Field Day and Saturday League helped students from different campuses bond together so that when they arrived at Macon they were one group.\n\nCindy Logan Garrison (‘88) speaks very fondly of Mrs. Wray, her childhood principal. One of Cindy’s favorite memories was from a summer Bible camp in Louisiana she attended for free by memorizing 142 Bible verses in third grade. Mrs. Wray was sitting on the front row of the bus to camp and made young Cindy move and sit near her due to excessive talking and not showing proper respect to her principal. When they arrived at camp, Cindy called her mom to complain about her punishment to which her mom surprised her by siding with her principal. She was to hang up the phone, apologize to Mrs. Wray and receive her punishment for her disrespectful behavior. Laughing about this incident years later, Cindy reflected about Mrs. Wray: “She loved me enough to provide a way, invest in my character and discipline out of love. I had the best week at camp and grew to LOVE Mrs. Wray more and more year after year. She was a godly leader, always professionally poised and stern with a gentle smile. Her demeanor was always endearing towards kids and confident with parents. She always reminded me of Queen Elizabeth. I will forever cherish her investment into Christian education – and her patience with kids like me!”\n\nMrs. Wray served on the administration team as the only woman for many years. She admits in retrospect that she was probably breaking the glass ceiling, although she said she was not really thinking along those lines. She thoroughly enjoyed working alongside many great leaders of ECS who treated her with the utmost respect.\n\nMrs. Wray even helped the administrative team craft the ECS mission statement, which is still paramount today. She remembers many meetings to write the mission statement in which they would write it, discuss it and rewrite it. “Mark Brink was instrumental in guiding us. The mission statement is so important. When I was at another school, there was Bible and chapel, but when I got to ECS, I realized what worldview was. It changed how I looked at things. I read books about worldview. I learned that all truth is God’s Truth. There is no difference between the secular and the sacred. All is sacred. That was new to me.”\n\nMrs. Wray said ECS is so important because the school trains the next generation in Truth. Elementary school is the very foundation of ECS, building Truth in children from a very young age.\n\nThe Wray family demonstrated their belief in generational Christian education as each of Mrs. Wray’s children, Andy (‘79), Lynda (‘82) and her grandson Alexander (‘14) all graduated from ECS. In fact, all three were Valedictorians of their respective graduating classes at ECS, reflecting Mrs. Wray’s commitment to educational excellence.\n\nMrs. Wray said she prays for ECS. “I pray they stick to the mission and not let the world squeeze them out. It looks like they have done that.” She advises, “Keep faithful to the past while looking to the future.” She praised the administration for not deviating from the mission.\n\n“When people ask me about school, I just point out III John 4: ‘I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.’ It is always very rewarding to see graduates bringing their children and grandchildren back to campus.”\n\nThe Marilyn Wray Scholarship, established in 2010, is awarded annually to the ECS graduate with the highest grade point average who has attended ECS for 12 or more years. It is a great way to recognize not only that student’s hard work in the classroom but also his or her parents’ loyalty to ECS and shared commitment to our mission. In addition, it serves as a great reminder of Mrs. Wray’s loyalty to ECS for 31 years.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Wray, for your many years of faithful service to ECS!\n\nThe auditorium in the chapel bears his name. Selected as the first recipient of the Steve Collums Distinguished Faculty Award, he has served in many positions, from his most widely known roles as Bible department chair and beloved Bible teacher to his lesser known duties which have included varsity golf coach, after-school bus driver and painting volunteer, to name a few. Now, after 49 years of service to ECS, Mark Brink has retired from ECS.\n\nMr. Brink, often called “a true ECS legend,” has been faithfully preparing our oldest students for college and the real world for nearly five decades through teaching the book of Romans and apologetics, ethics and Christian worldview. His impact on students, teachers and faculty members is immeasurable.\n\n“A spiritual leader at ECS and the ECS community.” - Coach John Roelofs, ECS colleague\n\nOn May 19, ECS hosted a retirement reception for Mr. Brink, and many current and former students, parents and colleagues flooded the White House to show appreciation to their beloved teacher and friend.\n\nWhile most of us can’t imagine ECS Bible without Mr. Brink at the helm, he will be the first to tell you that he never set out to be a teacher.\n\nFirst, some background....\n\nMr. Brink grew up on a dairy farm in Michigan, which taught him the importance of family, commitment and hard work. His parents, three siblings and he ate 21 meals at home together every week, which provided needed structure and family connection. Because the constant attention the cows required, they never took a family vacation. While he prized his upbringing and his parents’ dedication to the Lord, their family and their farm, Mr. Brink felt called to a different profession.\n\nHis future career began to unfold with his decision to attend Wheaton College, which he first learned about from an aunt who was an alumna.\n\nMr. Brink remembered, “I became a Christian around 10 years of age, but I really didn’t know how to think Christianly. I could think in terms of moral areas but I was not challenged in the intellectual areas until I attended Wheaton.”\n\n“He was one of my favorite teachers at ECS. He motivated me like no other teacher had before. I still talk about him to this day. Congrats on a job well done!” - Alicia Adams Downen (’98)\n\nIn his second week, he was introduced to Francis Schaeffer, guest speaker at Wheaton’s annual fall spiritual emphasis week. After hearing him speak both morning and evening for five days, a young Mark Brink, writing to his parents, penned, “I don’t understand what he is saying, but I know that what he is saying is important.” Little did Mr. Brink know at that time how Dr. Schaeffer would impact his life and teaching career at ECS.\n\nMr. Brink earned two graduate degrees – a Master of Arts in Christian Education at Wheaton and a Master of Psychiatric Social Work from the University of Illinois – with the intention of pursuing a career in Christian counseling.\n\nWhile fulfilling his commitment to the United States Army after four years of graduate school, a man with a heavy Southern accent contacted 1LT Brink by telephone, recruiting teachers for a fairly new Christian school in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“Mark Brink is a pillar in the ECS community! We won’t know until we get to Heaven all of the students, parents and teachers (me being one of them!) that he has impacted for Christ. Thank you just isn’t enough, Mark!\" – Peggy Selph, ECS kindergarten teacher for more than 40 years\n\n“He was very proud to tell me that they were able to increase the faculty salary by $1000 that year, which made it $5700,” Mr. Brink remembered, not being overly impressed by the offer. The year before, his wife, Sandra, had earned $9600 teaching music at the local public high school.\n\nUndeterred, Mr. Brink decided to look into this opportunity, but admitted he first needed to check the map to see exactly where Memphis was located! His original interest in Christian counseling morphed into an interest in Christian education. His training in theology at Wheaton and his enjoyment of teaching adult Sunday school back in Illinois gave him both the education and experience which led him to pursue a career as a high school Bible teacher.\n\nWhen Mr. Brink arrived in 1973, ECS was nine years old. Starting out, Mr. Brink was assigned to teach Bible to 7th and 8th graders. Immediately, he felt at home. “I enjoyed stretching students and helping them to see the wonder of redemption and how that is developed in the Scripture historically.”\n\n“We all love Mr. Brink! What faithful service and commitment to ECS and all of us!” - Tasha Thomas Shew (’85)\n\nIn his third year at ECS, Mr. Brink was assigned to teach the sophomore and junior Bible classes (semester classes) but eventually ended up teaching senior Bible exclusively. Senior Bible, a year-long course, was structured to accomplish two objectives – to provide a summary of all ECS Bible instruction and to prepare the graduate for life after ECS.\n\nA detailed study of Romans 1-8 had been chosen to accomplish the first objective. Teaching Romans became Mr. Brink’s joy since Romans, perhaps better than any other part of the Scripture, “gives the best explanation of the Gospel – how can anyone be right or acceptable to God.”\n\nMr. Brink explained, “In other religions, the individual seeks to give something to the deity (i.e., to ascend to god), but in Christianity, the Deity uniquely descends to give the individual what he doesn’t have – a perfect righteousness.” Mr. Brink added, “Because this contrast is so critical, Paul uses three chapters to reveal the problem – that no one, the bad person or the good person, has what is needed, but there is one individual who does – Jesus.” This is why his students have heard four simple words to summarize the Gospel: “I can’t; He can.”\n\nHe stated another benefit that comes from studying Romans: “Paul is very deliberate in how he structures his arguments, and I think that’s why it appeals to seniors. They see the connections, the unity of truth.”\n\nMr. Brink had been teaching the concept of worldview years before it became common terminology in the Christian community. “A worldview is a person’s presuppositions that cause him to interpret the world as he does.” Francis Schaeffer – that intriguing speaker from his Wheaton days – used three questions to help identify a person’s worldview: Where do things come from? Why do things have form? and Who is man? How a person answers these questions form a ‘grid’ or ‘lens’ through which he interprets all of life. The reason we have different views on abortion, for example, is that we have different views on life. We put glasses on and see everything through those lenses.\n\n“Dr. Shaeffer saw the unity of truth whether it was in theology, philosophy, science or art. Rather than withdrawing from culture to maintain doctrinal purity, which was common in the 20th century, Schaeffer believed that Christians were to engage the culture demonstrating genuine love while maintaining what he called ‘true truth.’”\n\n“After I graduated, I appreciated how difficult his class was because I learned a lot. Such a good man!” - Tim Tatum (‘77)\n\nIn 1977, Mr. Brink and former ECS headmaster Steve Collums attended a conference in Atlanta at which Schaeffer presented his 10-film series How Should We Then Live? In this series, Schaeffer contrasted the biblical worldview with thought from Greek and Roman days through the 20th century. This series became a part of the senior Bible curriculum for the class of 1978. As Dean of Faculty, Mr. Brink also oversaw faculty training on worldview so that all subjects, not just the Bible department, were integrating biblical worldview into their curricula.\n\nUnits on apologetics, worldview and ethics are included in the Bible curriculum to prepare seniors for life beyond ECS. Studying apologetics prepares them to give an answer to those who question or oppose the Christian faith. Many ECS graduates have taken their senior Bible notes with them to college, and many have called or emailed Mr. Brink with more questions to help them defend their faith. A firm believer that our faith is defensible, Mr. Brink also admits that there are some questions for which we do not have answers. To this, he poses, “Does this weaken the Christian position when we can’t understand or explain something? May it never be! Since God is infinite and we are finite, there will always be mysteries, but by grace we have the capability of knowing in dependence upon Him.”\n\nTo consider practical implications of a biblical worldview, Mr. Brink concluded senior Bible with a unit on ethics. Most of the topics in this unit dealt with medical ethics such as abortion, infanticide, euthanasia and in vitro fertilization. One of Mr. Brink’s most memorable moments came when he discovered that he taught a student who would have been aborted had his mother not studied this topic in his senior Bible class.\n\n“Thank you for giving me the foundation in theology. It has not only helped me as a follower of Jesus but has also EQUIPPED me to lead a church. I’m so grateful to you.”\n\n- John Horne (‘85)\n\nIn the early years at ECS, parents and teachers pitched in and provided the sweat equity needed for maintenance and campus improvements. Mr. Brink was often seen with a paintbrush in his hand. Coach Roelofs laughed as he told of the time Mr. Brink fell of a ladder while painting the Middle School gym but didn’t spill a drop of paint.\n\nFor years, Mr. Brink has brewed a pot of coffee every morning but not for himself. He was the first person on campus every day by 6:00 a.m., with a thermos already full. He started his day on the treadmill, and he consistently led the faculty and staff in steps per day in our health insurance benefits competition.\n\nFor many Christmas seasons, Mr. and Mrs. Brink opened their home to the upper school faculty. Junior chemistry teacher Paul Vander Zwaag remarked that Mr. Brink “believes in community and lives it.” He also says Mr. Brink is living embodiment of the ECS mission statement, which the senior Bible teacher helped craft with other administrators in the mid-1980’s.\n\nA responsibility that has meant a lot to Mr. Brink has been awarding the Avis Grant on graduation day every year. The grant, named after Dr. Kenneth Avis, one of the founders of ECS, is selected by the faculty and distributed to the graduate who has embraced the ECS mission and has demonstrated financial need. The Avis Grant has gifted 53 students with a total of $416,000 since it was established in 1979.\n\n“I made my first D in your class the first year you came to ECS, but brought it up to A’s by the next semester. In Bible … no less. But I so appreciate the strong foundation of Bible knowledge and critical thinking you taught. You will be missed at ECS.” - Sheila Tatum Whitworth (’78)\n\n“ECS began eight years before I came,” Mr. Brink said, “but its founding purpose, to provide Christian parents a way to fulfill their calling of providing a consistent Christian world and life view for their children, is what attracted me to and has kept me at ECS. To have taught my three sons and now a grandson has to be the high point of my career but also to teach many second generation students, to work with a group of colleagues committed to the mission of the school, and to witness students who connect truth to life are some of the best things about my life at ECS.”\n\nWhen asked to name his most memorable moment working at ECS, Mr. Brink responded, “One?” After so many years, he named a few which include: “Seeing one of my 7th graders fall (unharmed) through and out a window that he was attempting to close, seeing our Eagle Scouts lay wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in D.C., painting the inside of the Middle School gym with colleagues and parents as it was being built on a limited budget, hearing ECS graduates sing ‘May the Mind of Christ’ a cappella.”\n\nIn closing, we thank Mr. Brink for being a “faithful senior,” another phrase he often uses. Mr. Vander Zwaag shared at the faculty and staff recognition service that Mr. Brink has “been that faithful ECS senior for a half a century.” He directed his thoughts to Mr. Brink, his own former teacher and colleague: “You are that elder brother that has gone before us to smooth out the rough patches in the road so we would not trip. You laid the cornerstones of the auditorium and the middle school gym and Eagle Hall and the Legacy Center, and we have reaped the benefits. We come to the end of our journey together, and more than one person has asked, ‘How will ECS survive without Mr. Brink?’ You’ve provided that answer, too. Because at the end of your leg of the race, you planted a sign, and it says, ‘Look to Christ.’”\n\n“What a tremendous legacy with eternal impact!” - Aubrey Boren, former ECS teacher and coach.\n\nTHANK YOU, Mr. Brink, for faithfully teaching the Word of God for 49 years at ECS, investing in the lives of more than 4500 students with the most important message of all – salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Clown Lady. The heart of ECS. The hands and feet of Jesus. A gem.\n\nThese are common descriptions of Mrs. Carolyn Montfort, who we celebrate for her faithful service to ECS for 40 years.\n\nMrs. Montfort never met a stranger. She gives the warmest hugs around, knows your name, asks how you and your family are doing and assures you she is praying for you. And she means it.\n\nShe sees the unseen, pursues the rebel, treasures relationship and loves Jesus above all. When you see her, prepare to receive the best hug, put away your electronic device and sit a spell, because she wants to talk. You won’t regret it.\n\nShe oozes the fruit of the Spirit from Galatians 5: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.\n\nWell, self-control may be the only fruit in question at times – but with the purest of intentions.\n\nHer children joke that she sometimes “lacks a filter,” referring to her tendency to share every little detail most would leave out in her very elaborate stories. While the added color in her stories may raise a few eyebrows at the dinner table – with nothing crude of course because she is a lady – she speaks in such an unassuming and truthful way that’s not only comical and entertaining but also refreshing to the soul.\n\nMrs. Montfort stands proud at 4 foot 11, always decked out in Chico’s best, dripping with not one or two necklaces, but three or four, plus or minus a color-coordinated scarf or boa, because, why not? Before she retired, she used to lay out her clothes for the week, complete with accessories on Sunday nights; otherwise, she said she would be late for work every day.\n\nIf you can believe it, there was a day that this great ECS ambassador had yet to hear of ECS. Carolyn told how she and her husband, Skip, had moved into the house in the Berclair neighborhood in 1962 so that their children could walk to the nearby public school. Then she met Jean Patrick at a Bible study at Open Door Bible Church on North Parkway. Carolyn explains, “She took the time to share with me that there was a difference between a school and a Christian school. So I told Skip we need to see the school she told me about. Not knowing how they could afford tuition, she said the Lord taught her this lesson over and over: “If you purpose to give the very best for your children, then God provides a way.”\n\nWhen she enrolled her oldest daughter Mikki in kindergarten at ECS at the old Central Church on Poplar where Kirby Woods Baptist is now, Mrs. Montfort was pregnant with their youngest in 1972 and was a wreck about dropping her off. The teacher that God gave Mikki was Mrs. Glenda Kragt and lived in an apartment upstairs behind the white house. According to Mrs. Montfort, the teacher looked 12. Her teacher asked, “Do you have any questions?” to which Mrs. Montfort answered, “I do. How old are you?”\n\n“When Mikki learned a Bible verse, I learned a Bible verse!” Mrs. Montfort said. “There’s so much I learned from Mikki being at ECS! Kindergarten wasn’t just for Mikki. It was for our entire family.\n\n“I have never regretted a day that we spent at ECS over the years. I have heard so many people say that it is such a sacrifice. I never saw it that way. I saw it as an investment. We signed the contract every year and trusted the Lord to provide.”\n\nWhen her youngest daughter, Lisa was born (known to most today as Melisse), Mrs. Montfort served as a volunteer at the Ridge Lake campus and helped start Dog Day there. Then she volunteered stamping envelopes. She got her first paid job at ECS in the business office answering phones and performing jobs which included counting quarters from the Coke machine in the cafeteria.\n\nMickey Bowden, Headmaster at the time, approached Mrs. Montfort and said, “I want you to pray about something. I think you should apply for the Admissions Director.”\n\nShe protested, “I don't know how to do that.”\n\nHe responded, “Carolyn, you’ve been doing that from the beginning. Pray about it.”\n\nAfter praying and talking it over with her family, Mrs. Montfort accepted the position of Admissions Director, which she held for 18 years and pulled many 14-hour days. She told about spending hours at home with a typewriter on her lap, manually typing contracts.\n\nSome of her favorite jobs at ECS were not a part of her job description.\n\nMrs. Montfort was the Director of the Harvest Festival, which brought together parents and students of all four satellite ECS campuses so that they could get to know one another and raise money for the school each year, up to $10,000 annually. Parents and students sold homemade goodies including scones, donuts and other treats. The Harvest Festival offered fun games for children, horse and motorcycle rides and the highlight was the famous Clown Parade, the tradition with which Mrs. Montfort is probably most closely identified because she has led it for close to 40 years.\n\nThe Harvest Festival also featured a talent show on the front porch of the white house. In fact, Mrs. Montfort loves to tell about when Johnny Cash performed on the front porch of the white house because his sister worked at ECS. She went on to say that Jerry Lee Lewis, his wife and child marched with her in the Clown Parade one year.\n\nShe laughed as she remembered when the Outdoors Club installed a zip line from the top of the Middle School building over the pond that used to be between the chapel and Eagle Hall. She recalled that the business manager at the time “…about had a heart attack when he saw that!”\n\nMrs. Montfort was also the most willing chaperone on any school trip. Over the years, she has chaperoned numerous senior trips to Washington, D.C., she traveled to Ireland with the band, and we’ve lost track of the number of times she has gone to Chicago with the 7th graders and St. Louis with the 5th graders. Mrs. Montfort looked forward to the long bus rides to get to know new ECS families. She was also always fast friends with the bus drivers and the hotel staff wherever ECS stayed. On trips, there was always a new person to know, to love and with whom to share Jesus.\n\nMrs. Montfort can host a party. Well known for her cooking and catering abilities, she knew how to feed a crowd not just comfort food but she oozed hospitality and somehow made a meal feel like a friend.\n\nAs Admissions Director, she laughed as she remembered when a certain dad came for a tour and asked, “Is this school charismatic?”\n\nShe responded, “No, I wouldn't say that this school is charismatic, but we do have some charismatic people here.”\n\n“Do you speak in tongues?” he said.\n\n“We teach Spanish, French and Latin,” she answered.\n\nHe insisted, “I mean, do you stop class and cast out demons?”\n\n“We don’t,” she answered. “We go ahead and let those little devils stay all period.”\n\nFormer Headmaster Mickey Bowden said of Carolyn, “Thousands of ECS students, parents, teachers, and administrators have experienced the love of Christ through the ministry of Carolyn Montfort. The warmth of her love, her understanding, her compassion, and her personal attention has touched all of us. She embodies Christ-like love and is a blessing to ECS. She is an outstanding ambassador for Christ and for ECS. She brings joy, enthusiasm, faith, love and hope into all of our lives. Her legacy of love will always serve as a hallmark of an ECS education.”\n\nFormer Advancement Director, Rex Jones, agreed, “Carolyn Montfort is a foundational piece of the ECS heritage. She is on the ‘Mount Rushmore of ECS!’ Her love for the school, for the mission, but more importantly for the people in the ECS family have inspired my family to invest in the future of the school. Her impact will far outlive her presence.”\n\nWhen asked how she felt about being described as “the heart of ECS,” Mrs. Montfort very meekly said, “Well, I have a mother’s heart for ECS.”\n\nAnd isn’t that true? A mother sees her child’s strengths as promise. She sees her child’s weaknesses as potential. She willingly sacrifices sleep, and works long, hard hours because the mission of the task and legacy of the future are greater than herself.\n\nNo matter which hat she has worn for ECS over the years, whether as the Admissions Director, Dog Day volunteer, Harvest Festival Director, Chicago chaperone, business office secretary, bus driver, caterer, or as the Clown Lady, Mrs. Montfort has lived out Paul’s admonition in I Corinthians 9:22-23: “I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.”\n\n“The poster child of the ECS mission.”\n\n“The embodiment of everything ECS is about.”\n\nThese are some of the descriptions of Coach John Roelofs by those who know him best.\n\nAs we celebrate Coach’s service to ECS for 50 years at Homecoming this year, we thank the Lord for using this man of God to disciple future generations of ECS students so faithfully for more than a half century.\n\nThe son of a farmer and homemaker, Coach learned the value of hard work in the onion and potato fields of Albert Lea, Minnesota. He attended Dordt University, an evangelical Christian college in Sioux Center, Iowa. His college friend, Arlo Kreun, began his career as a math teacher at a fairly new school in Memphis called Evangelical Christian School. A year later, Coach joined him in Memphis to teach PE at ECS, eight years after the school’s founding.\n\nAs they say, the rest is history.\n\nThe history of ECS unfolded during John’s tenure at the school, now in its 57th year of Christian education. And he has the stories to prove it.\n\nCoach laughed as he recalled teaching PE before there was a gym on campus. The area between the White House and the ARC served as the basketball court. Rainy days necessitated creative PE class plans before the Middle School gym was built, which now bears his name. Coach taught Civics class in what is now the Head of School’s office in the white house.\n\nThe booster club did not require an annual fee back then. It was made up of committed parents who put in sweat equity, spending their Saturdays doing odd jobs which included painting the gym, cutting the grass on what is now Legends Field and selling Christmas trees and an apparent smoked sausage delicacy Coach loved known as “Smoky-in-a-Bun” to raise needed funds to support their athletic endeavors.\n\nCoach was a star on a basketball team in the Park Commission League made up of ECS faculty members including Arlo Kreun, Skip Hannah, Larry Louters and Steve Collums whose storied victories included beating the University of Memphis freshman team in double overtime, stunning the overconfident college players and wowing the ECS student section in attendance that night.\n\nWhile there were thousands of games, practices, classes and grades over the span of 50 years, without a doubt, the most impressionable memory of Coach’s tenure at ECS occurred at the 1975 Baccalaureate. Doug Peterson, ECS Headmaster at the time, delivered an invocation that Coach remembers to this day. At that time, the bank called the school’s loan. In order for ECS to keep its doors open the following year, ECS had to raise $800,000 in 21 days, an unheard of amount in an unbelievably short timeline. The whole community prayed, rallied together and sacrificed greatly to keep ECS alive. Board members as well as other parents, most of whom were middle class families, guaranteed the loan with their own homes; yet, they were still short in the final hours. When graduates, faculty members, and guests arrived at the Baccalaureate at First Evangelical Church on Union Extended at the end of the 21-day period, no one knew whether they had raised the necessary funds. Then Mr. Peterson announced those pivotal words: “Not only will we have a graduation in 1975, but we will have a graduation in 1976.” The whole sanctuary erupted in applause and tears, all in praise for the Lord’s amazing provision. Coach still gets choked up when retelling this memory – what he calls “a God thing, the greatest time I felt God’s hand on the school.”\n\nIn the years Coach has served at ECS, he has taught PE, science and civics, coached cross country, track, basketball, soccer, football and baseball. He has chaperoned many mission trips, senior retreats and senior trips, and he has also worked in the alumni department. Coach said that he was drawn to ECS because he came from a Christian college and wanted to be in a Christian setting. He then added, “I didn’t know I was going to be here 50 years. The Lord has been gracious.”\n\nTo work at the same place for 50 years is very rare, especially these days. Coach knew his purpose to disciple students for Christ, and he has remained faithful to that calling for five decades. When asked why Coach spent his career at ECS, he answered immediately: “the people and the kids.”\n\nHe also gives credit to Bonnie, his wife of 46 years, who has supported his ministry at ECS for so long. In fact, she has also worked at ECS, as a home economics teacher. Coach describes Bonnie as a Proverbs 31 woman and his number one prayer warrior. Coach’s four children also attended ECS: Angela, Bradley, Matthew and Nathan.\n\nLongtime ECS Headmaster Mickey Bowdon said, “Coach Roelofs embodies the ECS mission statement. His life and ministry at ECS has instilled the vision and practice of excellence for God’s glory in 5 decades of student lives, lives of his colleagues, and lives of ECS parents. John is known for his loyalty to Christ, his unwavering integrity, his life of honor, his life of prayer, and his solid and dependable friendship. John models what we pray that each ECS student will gain from their ECS experience. As a father, I am so grateful for the example that John is for my son and daughter. John is a fierce competitor in athletics and demonstrates what are the distinctives of Christ-centered, biblically directed student athletes. His legacy of faithfulness to Christ will always serve as a hallmark of an ECS education.”\n\nPete Tashie, ECS board member and class of 1978 said, “It’s hard to put into words my relationship with Coach. He was my first coach at ECS. It was his first year at ECS and my eighth grade year. It was so fun having a Coach that really wasn’t that much older than me and who was great at every sport. We had so much fun going to watch Coach and all the other teachers at ECS play basketball in the Park Commission League. … Coach was the best player on the team and my favorite. … I deeply love and admire Coach. His character and integrity are beyond reproach, and he is perhaps the best example of a humble yet strong servant leader. He is still my favorite coach after all these years.”\n\nLong-term ECS Bible teacher Mark Brink said of his colleague and friend, “There are many ways that the LORD has blessed me through my friendship with Coach Roelofs over the last forty-nine years. These blessings become extra special when they have involved my own sons. All three have benefited from his teaching. They have witnessed his physical and spiritual care in the gym, on the track, on cross country paths, on senior trips, on mission trips. His influence in their lives continues, even when separated, but especially in the next generation. I was brought to tears seven years ago when I realized that John would be the cross country coach of my oldest grandson. ‘May it never be’ that we conclude other than Soli Deo Gloria.”\n\nKevin Weaver, ECS class of 1978 and former chairman of the ECS Board of Trustees, said of Coach, “The biggest impact on me is that he taught me how to be a man. My dad died when I was 14. John was one of the guys that took me in and spent time with me. I used to go fishing with him and Skip Hannah.” Years later, Kevin and Coach had children the same ages, so they found themselves parenting together. “When our children were really young, Coach gave me a book on the importance of speaking blessings over your children. I developed a blessing that I would speak over my children every night. Now my son, Walter, has that blessing hanging on the wall of my grandson’s room. That’s an example of how he impacted me and my family.”\n\nRichard Reyle, class of 1983 remembered, “My first encounter with Coach was my first day on the Macon (now Shelby Farms) campus in seventh grade PE. He was a lot younger obviously – very athletic and a little intimidating. I was far from an athlete, and yet he gave everyone the feeling they could rise beyond their present abilities and do more. All for the glory of God.” Richard continued, “As I grew up at ECS, he was there when I was a senior, and my dad became terminally ill. He checked up on me almost daily. Coach is the embodiment of everything ECS is about – the servant leader who faithfully shows all of us what a Christ-like walk should look like.”\n\n“ECS is a better place because of Coach as he is STEADFAST,” Pete reflected. “Steadfast in his faith and love of Jesus; steadfast in his love of us his students; steadfast in dedication to ECS; and steadfast in his love of family and country.”\n\nKevin added, “To me, he is the poster child for the ECS mission. I don’t know if ECS would be the ECS it is today without John Roelofs. He was always completely faithful to the mission of ECS.”\n\nRecently, family, friends and even complete strangers poured out their support so that fellow Memphian, John Payne (ECS class of 1997), could walk again.\n\nIn June 1998, just a year after high school, Payne, a high level mountain bike racer, was training in Chattanooga for nationals later that year. While training, Payne was involved in a freak accident and suffered a spinal cord injury, paralyzing him from the chest down.\n\nWhile others may have resorted to anger, doubt and idleness at such a tragedy, Payne forged ahead, determined to live out his life as normally as before, enrolling in classes just two months later and graduating college in four years.\n\nAs a part of adapting to his new life, Payne remained active physically and through volunteer work. He began hand-bicycling (on a hand-crank bicycle) and wheelchair racing. He also volunteered for two major running organizations: the Memphis Runners Track Club for 17 years and Memphis Youth Athletics since its inception in 2014, serving both as a race timer, enabling and encouraging others to run, a pleasure he had been denied. He has served both organizations on their boards and as president. In addition, Payne has volunteered for Girls on the Run and serves on the board for Accessible Hope International and is hoping to participate in relief work through them in Sierra Leone in the next year. Throughout all of his efforts volunteering in the running community, Payne never gave up his dream to one day walk again.\n\nIn 2020, an opportunity to fulfill his dream presented itself in the form of a new device called ReWalk, an exoskeleton which depends on user-controlled technology and weight balance to walk. But this device came with a hefty price tag. Payne traveled to North Carolina to learn more about it and see the device in use. That’s when he decided to post about this opportunity on Facebook, which began a grassroots effort to make Payne’s dream come true.\n\nBill Rhodes, CEO of AutoZone, for which Payne works as a senior operations analyst, got wind of Payne’s opportunity, and reached out to him to learn more about the ReWalk device. He encouraged Payne to get in touch with AutoZone’s Human Resources who worked to find a way for Payne to get his own device.\n\nAutoZone Human Resources and Community Relations connected Payne to a fundraising organization, I GOT LEGS, that helps raise money for ReWalk devices. After retaining their services, he had raised $20,000 in just four days! However, there was still a long way to go to raise the $92,250 needed to purchase this exoskeleton. As word got out, donations kept pouring in, and he had reached the $67,000 mark. That’s when a longtime Memphis journalist learned about this fundraising effort.\n\nPayne explained, “Geoff Calkins (of the Daily Memphian) wanted to do an article on it. He called me that night. He posted the article on Monday, April 12. By Tuesday morning, we had raised $81,000, and within the hour, we were over the goal.” Payne was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support.\n\nCalkins wrote in his follow-up article on April 13: “I chronicled Payne’s story in a Monday column. Readers responded as I suspected they would. It’s not just that Payne is a good guy who suffered misfortune. It’s that he didn’t let his misfortune get in the way of giving back.”\n\nThe total amount raised was $129,447, well over his goal, donated from friends in the running community as well as complete strangers. The surplus will be used to help others walk.\n\nPayne was given access to a refurbished exoskeleton to increase his speed of training. He attends training three times a week with a physical therapist, Melanie Morton, who, incidentally, is married to an ECS alumnus, Richard Morton (class of 1994). This specialized training helps Payne learn how to work the battery-powered device that straps onto his legs and lower back. Payne moves the ReWalk device to different modes such as stand and walk through a Bluetooth-paired watch while he balances his weight on crutches. Learning how to synchronize the device to his body to produce controlled movement takes about 30-40 sessions to become proficient; Payne is about halfway through his training.\n\n“It’s pretty mechanical. It’s all driven by a device but with a lot of input from the user.” Payne adds, “It is way harder than I thought it was going to be. It’s a lot of work.” It’s a good thing he has remained so active!\n\nThroughout his journey, Payne credits his family and friends for their support. “Family has had a big role to play. My church, friends and parents helped support me a lot.” His friendships from ECS have been a part of this as well. Payne reflected, “ECS has provided me with good life values and a Christian education. I have remained engaged in my church. ECS has provided me with a lot of good friends such as the Butler family.”\n\nFellow ECS classmate David Butler said of his friend, “Being able to walk alongside this journey with John has been an awesome and yet humbling experience. JP does more from his chair than many able-bodied individuals. Whether it’s marathons or timing youth running events, he just refused to let his injury define him.\n\n“John’s positive attitude and sense of humor have been magnetic for everyone he has come into contact with. I’ve watched two of my brothers complete marathons because of John’s example and encouragement.”\n\nButler continued, “It’s been a testament to JP’s determination and faith in God’s plan for him for this opportunity to come to fruition. JP has worked, researched and prepared for this opportunity when it was still theoretical research. I’m excited for his wife Sabrina, family and his friends to be able to see him stand and walk since, for some, they have only known him in a chair. It’s an answer to 20+ years of prayers.”\n\nEngineer Andy Short (ECS 1996), shares his experiences in a revolutionary industry, including working for SpaceX founder Elon Musk.\n\nMany watched with rapt attention as the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched into orbit from Kennedy Space Center on May 30, 2020, the first time the United States has launched a rocket into space in 10 years. Perhaps more notably, this marked the first time a rocket built by a private company launched astronauts into orbit, ushering in a new era in human space travel.\n\nAndy Short was also watching the launch closely, but with perhaps greater anticipation than the rest of us. Six years ago, he was on the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) team responsible for the design and creation of a prototype of the Dragon 2, a capsule which later housed astronauts aboard the Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nEven though Short has been working as an engineer in the aerospace industry for 20 years, launch day revealed his boy-like wonder: “By far, the coolest part of working in aerospace is seeing the final countdown of the rocket launch and watching those initial 20 to 30 seconds of flight. The anticipation, the amount of power on display as the rocket lifts off, and the myriad systems that have to work perfectly together is incredible.”\n\nLaunch day is a culmination of years of work from the nation’s brightest minds researching, planning, building, testing, troubleshooting and revamping time and again, to finally achieve exhilarating success.\n\n“SpaceX was probably the place that was the most demanding and challenging, but it’s also where I learned the most,” Short reflects of his job as Director of Composites Production, in which he led a team of more than 200 people. “I think the most important thing I learned while working at SpaceX was the value of setting really ambitious goals and objectives. Some people used the word impossible to describe their goals. Working there meant learning to get comfortable in that environment of trying to make the impossible possible.”\n\nShort describes what it was like to work for Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and one of the founders of Tesla, Inc., with whom he had regular interaction: “Elon Musk is a man that is always pushing forward and using ambitious goals as a driving motivating factor. As a result, he has accomplished more in scope than was ever thought possible. That’s his M.O.\n\n“It is a really tall order to hit the objectives and accomplish what he expects of you, but if you can get comfortable in that pressure cooker, and you accomplish 80% of his expectations, then you are still miles and miles ahead of other companies.”\n\nUltimately, working in an environment likened to a pressure cooker can lead to exhaustion. “When I decided to leave SpaceX, I wanted to work in a new industry. I had been in aerospace for a long time and was eager to try something new. I wanted to work in a small company.” He transitioned to a position as Director of Operations at Goldbrecht, Inc., a company that makes high-end architectural windows and door designs.\n\n“No one should shy away from making a career change based on following your interests or expanding your horizons,” Short advises. “For me, it was cool, but I realized I did miss the more technical challenges of aerospace.”\n\nNow, Short is the Senior Director of Manufacturing at Virgin Orbit, which provides launch services for small satellites and has developed the air-launched LauncherOne rocket.\n\nAs both an engineer and a business manager, Short relishes his role at this up and coming company. At the time he was brought on in 2016, Virgin Orbit still needed to make foundational decisions and establish basic business processes such as determining which enterprise systems to use, how to purchase parts and manage inventory, and how to plan and manage production.\n\nShort prefers the smaller company size – Virgin Orbit currently employs around 500 people – and enjoys his ability to influence decisions and the direction of the company. “There was a lot that had to be done in terms of maturing the organization and business processes.” He adds, “We are working on building a rocket but also building a company.”\n\nVirgin Orbit recently completed their launch demonstration mission. There was a malfunction early in flight that ended the mission. While disappointing, Short says that in his industry, it is not unusual for new rocket programs to experience failures or anomalies during their first several missions. Now, they are investigating what went wrong and strategizing how to fix it for future launches.\n\nEach rocket is equipped with sensors and instrumentation from which engineers at Virgin retrieve valuable data needed to learn how to improve the design and launch future rockets successfully. Short and his team simultaneously incorporate these new findings into manufacturing future rockets so that their launch timeline is minimally affected.\n\nShort shares that extensive testing and learning from failures is a key aspect of work for engineers. He advises young engineering students, “Sometimes you may get a very black-and-white answer for simpler designs or problems. When you are dealing with a complex system like launching a rocket, you can’t always get a crystal clear, black-and-white answer. It always takes engineering judgment and quantification of risk. That is a vital part of an engineer’s job. We could tinker with a rocket design for years, but you can’t run a business like that. At the end of the day, you have to get the data, use that along with engineering judgment to determine, based on everything we have collected and others’ input, what we could do to solve the problem.”\n\nShort encourages students interested in one day becoming engineers to develop their skills in active STEM programs as early as possible. “I am a huge proponent of maximizing opportunities to apply what students are learning in the classroom.” He advises, “Students should take advantage of robotics teams or similar organized groups and competitions. Things start to come together when you are forced to work with your hands. There is a lot you can learn in that environment that you can’t learn in the classroom.”\n\nTo future engineers, Short offers some valuable advice as a hiring manager in one of the most cutting edge industries in the world. The pool of applicants for jobs at any aerospace company is impressive, and there is no shortage of graduates from highly distinguished universities. But Short has found, “One of the most important, foundational qualities of a good engineer is a great work ethic. What a differentiator between people in terms of what they know versus how they perform!”\n\nTHE SHORT LIST\n\nEducation:\n\nBachelor’s of Science in Textile Engineering, Auburn University, 2000\n\nMaster’s of Business Administration in International Business, Xavier University, 2004\n\nExperience:\n\nVirgin Orbit, Senior Director of Manufacturing, 2016-present\n\nGoldbrecht, Inc., Director of Operations, 2015-2016\n\nSpace Exploration Technologies, Director, Composites Production, 2012-2015\n\nMessier-Bugatti USA, LLC, Vice President, Carbon Operations, 2008-2012\n\nQuality Director, 2007-2008\n\nQuality and Program Manager, 2004-2007\n\nProcess Engineer, 2001-2004\n\nFamily:\n\nMarried to Stephanie with five children ages 5 to 17\n\nHOW DID ECS PREPARE YOU FOR LIFE?\n\nThe number one thing that ECS helped with was writing and critical thinking. It provided guided opportunities to think through faith and how it applied to different areas of my life. A lot of that was done in the advanced English classes. I was fortunate to be with a group of students who prompted debate and discussion and critical thinking. My teachers were good about integrating Christian worldview into our class discussions of books. It pushed me to think in areas I wouldn’t have on my own. ECS was a safe place to be challenged in the thought process. After ECS, students will be challenged on their faith and worldview, but perhaps with less support, and in a not-as-safe environment. That could be difficult without the foundation of a place like ECS.\n\nWHO WERE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE TEACHERS?\n\nJoyce Herring, my AP English teacher, and Peter Cooper, my sophomore History and Literature teacher were some of my favorites. I also have such wonderful memories from cross country and track with Coach Baker and Coach Roelofs. Both of those guys were mentors to me who taught the values of working hard, living your faith, supporting your teammates, and in all that, having fun."
