        "text": "RCA’s current tuition is listed on the “Enrollment & Registration” page here on our website. Our tuition is evaluated twice a year to offer the best possible price for parents, while still equitably paying our staff and bills as necessary. We feel our price is competitive and our care and education is excellent and well worth the investment.\n\nWe do not currently accept financial aid in the form of ABC vouchers or other voucher programs. We will accept 3rd party payments from work or a company that pays for your childcare. Any other direct questions should be sent to [email protected] or call the office at (843) 873-9856 for school questions or (843) 879-0599 for Daycare/Preschool questions.\n\nDiscounts may be offered to families based upon individual circumstances, and a meeting must be scheduled with our finance office and Headmaster or Preschool Director to obtain information about them. Please call the office at (843) 873-9856 for school questions or (843) 879-0544 for Daycare/Preschool questions.\n\nOpen enrollment for each school year starts in the previous March. After the school year begins in August, space available questions should be directed to the office. While we normally have openings throughout the school year, some classes and age groups fill up quickly, and waiting lists may be started. Please call the office at (843) 873-9856 for school questions or (843) 879-0544 for Daycare/Preschool questions.\n\nWe accept students with special needs on a case by case basis. We want to make sure that all students have the best possible outcome of their education. For some students, that means being in a regular classroom, learning and working with other students of similar age is important and the most intervention they need. Other students will need resources and extra time with one on one aides designed to keep them focused and safe. We are aware that we are not able to care for all special needs students and will have to turn some cases away. Please call the school with questions, and concerns.\n\nRCA does have a sports program. Currently we offer an inclusive program from 5th grade to 12th grade that allows students to participate in sports like cross country volleyball, basketball and track. Some years we have been able to field football, archery and other sports as well. Sport availability depends on the students and coaches available each year, and occurs an extra $100 yearly sports fee\n\nWe use several learning curriculum and learning strategies at RCA. A main proponent in the Elementary and daycare is A beka and teacher led curriculum. Students are grounded in God’s word and works as they learn basic information and go through formative years learning to read write and grown into young people. In Middle and High School we use A beka, Teacher led Curriculum and third party curriculum (BJU, TeacherspayTeachers, Kanemiller, and other Christian Curriculums to round out student interest) to prepare young students for college, trade school or the workforce.\n\nSchool Closures are posted on Facebook, the school website, school calendar and are sent out on text message groups that are started at the beginning of the school year. If enough warning is available (such as for weather events) we will add our name to the school lists on tv news sites as well.\n\nPossible school emergencies are practiced at school and teachers are trained once at the beginning of the year and a refresher in the middle of the school year to protect your children at all costs."
