He passed for 487 yards and rushed for 240 last season. His tackles production decreased last season with 24 after recording 68 as a sophomore, but he figures to be in on many tackles as he concentrates more on his defensive production.\n\nSabino LB/RB Isaiah Robertson\n\nRobertson announced his transfer in January to Centennial but backtracked after it was a second transfer and he would have had to win an appeal to maintain eligibility. Robertson is the top returner for the state-champion Sabercats recording 44 tackles, recovering two fumbles and causing a couple of fumbles.\n\n3A SOUTH NOTES:\n\n— Every school lost pivotal seniors from last season, with Sabino quarterback Cameron Hackworth the most substantial graduate from the state-champion Sabercats. Hackworth’s career 8,799 passing yards and 97 touchdowns are the most in the history of Southern Arizona high school football. He is now at NCAA Division III program Lake Forest (Ill.). Morenci lost its top running back Michael Casillas and its head coach RIshard Davis. Casillas, who has exhausted his eligibility, rushed for 1,732 yards on 306 carries last season. He finished with 5,828 rushing yards in his career.\n\n— Morenci will have alum Frankie Gonzalez as its head coach after Davis left to coach Jemison High School near his home in Huntsville, Ala. The other coaches in the league are at least in their fourth season at their respective school — Sabino’s Ryan McBrayer (eighth season), Pusch Ridge’s Kent Middleton (fifth year), Thatcher’s Daniel Jones (fifth year) and Safford’s Robert Park (fourth year).\n\n— Morenci plays its first four games at home and has only four games on the road this season. The early home games will not be easy with ALA-Ironwood, Round Valley and Pima each coming off winning seasons. Pima went 13-1 with its loss in the 2A state championship game against Scottsdale Christian.\n\n— Pusch Ridge will play three of its first four games on the road and its two games away from home in region play will be challenging against Morenci and Thatcher. The Lions’ annually anticipated game with Sabino is at home on Oct. 4.\n\n— Sabino opens defense of its 3A state championship facing one of the most difficult schedules in the state. The Sabercats play local 4A schools Sahuaro and Mica Mountain at home and have a tough three road games consecutively in the middle of the season against Pusch Ridge, Thatcher and ALA-West Foothills (8-3 last year) from Oct. 4-18. The regular season ends with a home game against Morenci followed by a road game at Mohave (11-2).\n\n— Safford hosts Rincon/University as part of its non-region schedule. The Bulldogs play four of their last six games on the road against challenging opponents including Sabino, Blue Ridge, Round Valley and Pusch Ridge. Safford also plays at Pima on the road in the second week of the season.\n\n— Thatcher plays the runner-up in the 4A state title game (Yuma Catholic) and faces both teams involved in the 3A state championship last year (Sabino and Paradise Honors). The Eagles again open against Paradise Honors, this time at home after losing 35-14 in the opener last year at Paradise Honors (which went on to lose the 3A state championship game to Sabino). Much like the rest of the 3A South, Thatcher faces a daunting schedule that includes home games against Valley Christian (11-2 last season), Yuma Catholic (13-1 with lone loss against CDO in the 4A championship game), Sabino and Pusch Ridge.\n\n3A SOUTH\n\nMORENCI\n\nHead coach: Frankie Gonzalez (first year at Morenci and overall).\n\nWildcats compete in the 3A South. *Region game.
