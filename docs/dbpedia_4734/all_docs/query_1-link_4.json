        "text": "BRCS is part of the Virginia Association of Christian Athletics (VACA) conference\n\nVACA’s Constitution States: Athletic programs in Christian schools must be in harmony with God’s Word to us in all other areas of life. Athletics is to be a means, not an end to itself. As the passage from I Timothy indicates, there is value in physical training, but only if it encourages and adds to an individual’s pursuit of godliness. Unfortunately, we live in a society that deifies athletes and relegates God\n\nto the occasional sound byte at end-of-game interview with a victorious player (Are there not Christians who can thank God in defeat?). In contrast, athletic programs in Christian schools should glorify God, while developing individual character and team integrity.\n\nMembership in this conference shall be limited to current membership and to other independent Christian day schools elected according to the method prescribed in the Constitution.\n\nVACA’s geography includes the Shenandoah Valley, Roanoke and Lynchburg Districts."
