This is a B grade movie all round, even down to the topless women. Poor cinematography, poorly produced, poor acting, poor fight scenes, overall junk, do not waste your time.

Fighting looks so obviously fake its almost comical, apart from it being so crap. Along with the poor editing with the screen shot changing every 0.5 of a second you really don't see anything at all worth while.

Oh didn't i mention how crap this film is.........if you have a choice between this film and something else then choose the something else. 1 out of 10 and thats generous, there really needs to be 0 for this one!!!
