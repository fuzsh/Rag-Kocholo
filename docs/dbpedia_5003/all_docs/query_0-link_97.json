        "text": "As the new millennium dawned, cinema stood on the cusp of a revolution. The 2000s ushered in an era of unprecedented technological advancement, creative storytelling, and cultural shifts that would forever change the landscape of filmmaking. From the rise of epic fantasy franchises to the gritty realism of superhero reboots, this decade saw a diverse array of films that entertained, challenged, and inspired audiences worldwide.\n\nIn this journey through the cinematic wonders of the 2000s, we’ll explore 20 iconic films that left an indelible mark on the art form and continue to influence filmmakers and audiences alike.\n\nThese movies pushed boundaries, broke box office records, and, in many cases, redefined entire genres. They represent not just the best of what cinema had to offer in the first decade of the 21st century but also serve as a time capsule of the hopes, fears, and dreams of a world in rapid transition.\n\n1. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001)\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter leaped from the pages to the big screen in this enchanting adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s beloved novel. In addition to Rupert Grint and Emma Watson playing his devoted friends Ron and Hermione, the Chris Columbus-directed movie introduced audiences to Daniel Radcliffe as the bespectacled boy wizard.\n\nWith its stunning recreation of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, memorable characters like the stern Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and the lovable giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), and John Williams’ iconic score, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” captured the imagination of viewers young and old. The film grossed nearly $1 billion worldwide and launched a franchise spanning eight films over the next decade.\n\n2. Spirited Away (2001)\n\nHayao Miyazaki’s animated masterpiece follows Chihiro, a young girl trapped in a mysterious spirit world.
