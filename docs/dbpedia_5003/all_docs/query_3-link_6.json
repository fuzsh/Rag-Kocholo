K. (GAMER)\n\nReviewed on 12/28/2022...\n\nPretty good fight scenes and plotline! A must watch for Street and MMA fighters!\n\n3 of 4 member(s) found this review helpful.\n\nAdam C. (i12bnmovie) from SAINT LOUIS, MO\n\nReviewed on 7/13/2009...\n\nThis was a 100% predictable movie from start to finish. The only reason I wanted to see it was because of Max Martini. I love The Unit. I went into this movie not expecting much, and it met those low expectations. There was over the top dialog. It was over the top acting. I don't know what the director was thinking. I hope that David Mamet comes knocking on Martini's door for another film. Martini needs better movies or a better agent. I think he should get the same agent as Statham.\n\n2 of 3 member(s) found this review helpful.\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nGreat Action... Great Fights... Beautiful Women...\n\nXKAL | USA | 04/14/2009\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"The \"Street Warrior\" is Jack Campbell, played by Max Martini, an\n\nex-army ranger, who comes back home to discover his brother beaten near\n\ndeath because of an underground no holds barred fight club. He enters\n\nthe gauntlet to avenge his brother and bring order to the town that has\n\nbeen corrupted by the ring leader, played by Nick Chinlund.\n\n\"Street Warrior\" supplies us with tons of great action fight scenes\n\nthat are at times vicious. Various styles of fight techniques are\n\nused... martial arts, boxing, wrestling, street brawling, luchador, and\n\nlots of cheat moves. What more can you ask from a fight movie? Well,\n\nhow about some beautiful women? Street Warrior has lots of great eye\n\ncandy as well to keep your interest piqued between the fists and blood.\n\nThe acting is very good and believable by the entire cast. Props to Max\n\nMartini and Nick Chinlund on their performance, but also to the\n\ncharacters of Baldus, played by Gary Kasper, the evil white supremacist\n\nNazi fighter who entices the rabid paying audience by yelling \"Hate\n\nMe!\", and the character of Santo, played by Danny Arroyo, the luchador\n\nfighter who befriends Campbell and is forced to fight in order to save\n\nhis wife and children.\n\nFighting, sex, blood, dancing women and great action... What more can\n\nyou ask from a fight movie? \"Street Warrior\" is well worth the rental or purchase.\""
