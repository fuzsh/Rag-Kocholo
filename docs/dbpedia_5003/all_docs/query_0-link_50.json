        "text": "Director: John McTiernan\n\nCast: Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia\n\nBest quote: “Now I have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.”\n\nThe killer scene: Alan Rickman’s final tumble: iconic, nostalgic, slightly-shoddy-effects–based glory.\n\nBruce cannon\n\nSo here it is. The No. 1 spot, the top of the skyscraper. The perfect action movie. But does Die Hard really fit the bill? It doesn’t have anything to say about the state of the world. It doesn’t offer much insight into the human condition (though the image of Bruce Willis walking on broken glass could be taken as a poignant metaphor for life’s little brutalities). It isn’t exactly what pseuds would call High Art.\n\nAll of which is precisely the point. If cinema is the perfect escapist medium—and until someone invents a virtual-reality device that works, it will be—then action movies are its purest expression, the best way we know of for humanity to shake itself loose from the trappings of humdrum reality and take to the ether. We don’t want to see ourselves reflected, we don’t want understanding or honesty or intellectual insight. We want speed and intensity, wit and wisecracks, cartoon violence and things going boom. We want Die Hard.\n\nThe story is so ingenious, it’s incredible no one had thought of it before: A group of terrorists invades a state-of-the-art skyscraper and takes the inhabitants hostage. Their only hope is a man locked in with them, yet free to roam, a lone hero who must pick off the bad guys one by one, arcade-game–style, until he reaches the Big Boss. Admittedly, there are precedents—Assault on Precinct 13 must have been an on-set favorite—but no one had told this tale with such streamlined precision before. It’s little accident that, in the wake of the film’s success, clones sprouted up like toadstools almost overnight, from Die Hard on a boat (Under Siege) to Die Hard on a bus (Speed) and this year’s Die Hard on a musical instrument (Grand Piano).\n\nThat said, even the highest of concepts will only work if all the elements are right, and Die Hard is a textbook case of everything falling into place. John McTiernan’s direction pulls no punches, and there are sequences here—like the oft-imitated, never-bettered swinging-through-a-window-on-a-firehose moment—that achieve something close to visual poetry. The script is crammed with humor and invention, and whoever came up with the idea of setting it at Christmas deserves a big medal. But of course, the blue-ribbon winner in all this has to be Bruce Willis, who crashed from nowhere (well, from TV’s Moonlighting) onto the world’s stage, thanks to a combination of antiheroic self-mockery, battered but unbowed machismo and one very grubby T-shirt. Yippie-ki-ay, indeed.\n\nTom Huddleston\n\nArts and culture journalist\n\nDirector:James Cameron\n\nCast:Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton\n\nBest quote:“Game over, man! Game over!”\n\nThe killer scene:Ripley straps into a Power Loader suit to destroy the alien queen.\n\nMoms and ammo\n\nWhen James Cameron stepped into Ridley Scott’s space-horror boots to direct the sequel to the brilliant Alien, he didn’t try to ape the sickening, paranoid, slow creep of the original. He just said “Screw that subtlety shit” and went big on explosions, big on aliens, and let the guns (and mech-robots) do the talking. Where before there was endless deep-space dread and grimness, now there was fully fledged big-screen action. Cameron was a relative newbie at the time, having previously only directed The Terminator, but he took to big-budget work with gusto.\n\nSigourney Weaver is pitted yet again against a vicious many-toothed foe, this time in an abandoned space colony, but now she’s surrounded by weapon-heavy Marines, hell-bent on kicking ass and taking no names. As in Alien, the plot centers around a male-dominated corporation’s obsession with developing bioweaponry, no matter what the human price may be. Yeah, it’s kind of a metaphor for the evils of big business, and sure, it’s an empowering fable about the strength of the female voice in a male world, but we all know what you’re here for: to watch Ripley stomp around in a huge mechanical suit and destroy some shockingly phallic alien bastards. And that’s awesome.\n\nEddy Frankel\n\nArt & Culture Editor\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa\n\nCast: Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura, Seiji Miyaguchi\n\nBest quote: “If we only defend, we lose the war.”\n\nThe killer scene: The villagers’ rain-lashed last stand against the rampaging bandits—the very definition of iconic\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nIf you’ve never seen a Kurosawa film and wonder why he’s held in such high regard, this all-time classic is all the evidence you need—not least because it inspired Hollywood’s much-loved, if slightly simplistic, remake, The Magnificent Seven. Running over 200 minutes, it’s also a textbook example of making action mean more, because we’re totally engrossed in the lives of the characters. We truly feel the fear and abject hunger of vulnerable farmers, so desperate to protect their new crop that they’re paying hired samurai with their last grains of rice. You also feel the desperation of the masterless ronin prepared to take the job, since at least it means bed and board for a while.\n\nKurosawa takes an hour to show us what’s at stake, and another hour showing how wise leader Takashi Shimura, volatile wanna-be samurai Toshiro Mifune and their cohorts plan to fend off their marauding foes. When the action does erupt, however, the ebb and flow of strategy is that much more absorbing, the casualties hitting hard, the payoff intense. Filmmaking of this breadth and depth takes courage, wisdom and the formal skills to put your ambitions on the screen. Utterly groundbreaking in its day, the kinetic energy with which Kurosawa’s mobile camera puts us in the midst of some hairy stunts and near-feral skirmishes has barely dated. Every action movie since owes him a debt for the hugely influential manner in which he distills space and movement into the enclosure of great cinema.\n\nDirector: Sam Peckinpah\n\nCast: William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan\n\nBest quote: “We’re after men. And I wish to God I was with them.”\n\nThe killer scene: One of the bunch sees his foxy former lover laughing in the arms of a fat-cat general—jealousy gets the better of him, and it’s a bloodbath.\n\nGoing out with a bang\n\nIt’s become customary to talk about Sam Peckinpah’s classic as the tombstone of the Western genre, the moment when Hollywood’s already-tired tradition of white-hat heroics was plunged irrevocably into nihilism, apocalypse and zero-sum catharsis. Then again, no other Western has proven as durably modern, or able to speak to a younger generation like this one. (Not for nothing, The Wild Bunch was comfortably the highest-ranked oater on our list.) It might be time for a rethink: The Wild Bunch is still very much with us, in every movie that gushes slo-mo rivers of blood in the name of brotherly principle, in every action film that lunges for timely political complexity amid the spent ammo casings and slung epitaphs.\n\nThe Vietnam War was raging when the movie was being made, and Peckinpah seized on those allegorical resonances, hoping to confront viewers with footage similar to what they were seeing on the nightly news. Call it a mark of his virtuosity (or naïveté) that the movie was met with a polarized response, some hailing it as a masterpiece, other pointing to it as a sign of a bankrupt art form. The Wild Bunch is breathtaking in its uncompromised grubbiness, the almighty dollar leading good men to their doom, and lesser men to a mercenary bounty. It echoes some of the director’s own struggles in Hollywood, but mainly stands as a testament to integrity: Go dark, go deep, and true action fans will follow you to the ruinous end.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Jackie Chan\n\nCast: Jackie Chan, Brigitte Lin, Maggie Cheung\n\nBest quote: “The success of the operation depended on careful planning.”\n\nThe killer scene: The climactic shopping-mall showdown sees Jackie taking a death-defying three-floor plunge down a lighting wire.\n\nGood cop, mad cop\n\nYou have to go back to the silent-comedy era of Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton to find the equivalent of Jackie Chan in his Hong Kong prime—a star who’d put life and limb at risk to get the shot he wanted. These days the phrase he does his own stunts implies relatively risk-free challenges, but Chan’s ’80s peak delivers a whole other level of insanity. Yes, that really is his gung-ho cop dangling by an umbrella off a moving double-decker bus in Police Story’s opening salvo, one slip away from a bone-breaking fall. (Moments later, the stuntmen tumbling from the top deck to the tarmac all ended up in hospital, lengthening a serious injury list that saw the star form a stunt-team association to pay their medical bills.)\n\nBy the time mainstream audiences encountered Chan in 1998’s Rush Hour, age and common sense had caught up with him, and he never quite matched the exuberant blend of comic knockabout thrills and heart-stopping spills from this landmark cop flick, where his character’s pledge to protect state witness Brigitte Lin endangers both of them. The star’s expertise in fight choreography also made him an assured action director, committed to registering the hurt and commitment the performers put in. If he shows his own climactic shopping-mall leap from three different angles, it’s not egotism—only making sure we believe he’d do something that batshit crazy. The after effects of electrocution, burned hands and damaged vertebrae have long dissipated (Jackie says), but the flying three-story fall has since become celluloid legend.—Trevor Johnston\n\nDirector: Robert Clouse\n\nCast: Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly, John Saxon\n\nBest quote: “Boards don’t hit back.”\n\nThe killer scene: Lee takes on an army.\n\nBruce Lee goes to grindhouse heaven\n\nBruce Lee’s fame is based on a mere four movies he made as an adult, and Enter the Dragon was the lightning strike that transformed him into an international box-office icon, one month after his death. A legendary movie, it really shouldn’t be: the production was a mess, director Robert Clouse was a hack, and the screenplay, by and large, sucked. But the performances turn a crap sandwich into fried gold. The project’s Hollywood pedigree allowed Lee to ditch all pretense of charming his hometown Hong Kong audience and play a savage superman who’s all oiled muscles and savage grace, coming alive only when he’s in motion. Full of underground dungeons and goofy gadgets, it’s one of those rare cases when what should have been a B-list James Bond knock-off with an Asian cast wound up becoming one of the greatest action movies of all time.—Grady Hendrix\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: George Miller\n\nCast: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult\n\nBest quote:“Oh, what a day—what a lovely day!”\n\nThe killer scene: Racing into battle, an army’s pet guitar player unleashes a raging soundtrack. His ax shoots flames, shaming the memory of Kiss.\n\nOn the Road again\n\nThe fourth installment of George Miller’s rambunctious post-apocalyptic saga arrives like a tornado tearing through a tea party. In an age of weightless spectacles that studios whittle down from visions to products, here’s a movie that feels like it was made by kidnapping $150 million of Warner Bros.’ money, absconding with it to the Namibian desert, and sending footage back to Hollywood like the amputated body parts of a ransomed hostage. Marrying the mordant frenzy of Terry Gilliam’s cinematic universe with the explosive grandeur of James Cameron, Miller cooks up some of the most exhilaratingly sustained action ever captured on camera. The digital effects, sparingly used, take a backseat to the film’s non-stop parade of “people actually did that!?” stunt work. With Charlize Theron’s Furiosa behind the wheel, though, Fury Road steers this testosterone-soaked franchise in a brilliant new direction, forging a mythical portrait about the urgent need for female rule in a world where men need to be saved from themselves.\n\nDirector: John Woo\n\nCast: Chow Yun Fat, Tony Chiu Wai Leung, Anthony Wong\n\nBest quote: “You’re full of shit, you know that? There’s a toilet over there.”\n\nThe killer scene: A cop spits a toothpick faster than he shoots a bullet.\n\nNot over easy\n\nIt’s just another day for Hong Kong policeman “Tequila” Yuen (Chow Yun Fat) and his partner, until the sting they’re overseeing at a teahouse goes very wrong. One of the lawmen lies dead. Tequila, meanwhile, blazes his way through the bad guys, putting a bloody end to one gangster with a gunshot to the face. That’s just the opening scene of John Woo’s vigorous rogue-cop thriller—one of his best bullet-riddled ballets. Eventually, an undercover agent, Alan (Tony Leung), emerges to give Tequila a run for his money, though in true Woo fashion, both men find they have similar stoic-macho codes and an identical goal: bring down the criminal syndicate led by ruthless mobster Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong).\n\nTequila’s love for jazz—he frequents a blues bar run, in a delightful bit of casting, by Woo himself—epitomizes this go-for-broke adventure, which moves between modes (moodily mournful one moment, fiercely kinetic the next) with the sublime confidence of a virtuoso playing at peak form. There’s a valedictory quality to the movie that seems especially poignant in retrospect, since this was the last film Woo made before he spent a decade-plus churning out Hollywood product of varying quality (see our No. 19). What a way to go out, though, especially in the astonishing climax in which Tequila and Alan infiltrate Johnny Wong’s arsenal…which just happens to be housed in a hospital filled to brimming with sick patients and newborn infants. By that point, even Hard Boiled seems too soft a title.—Keith Uhlich\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nCast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong\n\nBest quote: “There’s no fate but what we make for ourselves.”\n\nThe killer scene: Sarah Connor's apocalyptic nightmare vision of L.A., as the city is blasted to ashes by a nuclear firestorm\n\nA boy’s best friend is his cyborg\n\nIt’s interesting to note that, on our recent 100 Best Sci-fi Movies poll, James Cameron’s original Terminator placed in the top ten, with its sequel trailing behind at No. 16. Here, those positions are all but switched, but perhaps that’s as it should be. The Terminator is a perfect science-fiction movie, packed with ideas and invention, but thanks in large part to its tight budget, the action can feel a little constrained. The sequel suffered no such setbacks. By this point the most in-demand director in Hollywood, James Cameron was given a blank check to realize his most extreme destructive visions, and the result is a film that rockets from one incendiary set piece to the next, barely pausing for breath as burned-out trucks, exploding cop cars and crashed helicopters pile in its wake.\n\nIt’s also—with the arguable addition of Jurassic Park—the film that proved once and for all what computer-generated special effects were capable of. Admittedly, many of the most impressive effects were in-camera: The aforementioned helicopter crash is a triumph of practical ingenuity. But from the first appearance of the murderous, mercurial T-1000, a steely shape-shifter played to perfection by the blank-faced Robert Patrick, it was clear that something entirely new had been brought into the world. It’s possible to pick holes in the film—it’s sentimental in a way its predecessor wasn’t, and the employment of Arnie’s original Terminator as a comic sidekick can become grating—but as an action movie, this one’s hard to beat. And yet…—Tom Huddleston\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCast: Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman\n\nBest quote: “Snakes. Why’d it have to be snakes?”\n\nThe killer scene: Chasing a kidnapped Marion down Cairo’s alleys, Indy confronts a black-robed swordsman who clearly wants a little time. Our hero doesn’t have any.\n\nRolling with the punches\n\nAre these not the most euphoric opening 12 minutes of any movie, forget the action ones? Steven Spielberg and conceptual guru George Lucas always tip their fedoras to the ’30s cliffhanger serials (movies that they were probably too young for, realistically). Rather, consider Raiders as a statement of ceaseless forward momentum, made by two impatient movie brats rewriting the rules of Hollywood. First, we see the dark Peruvian jungle, then the bullwhip, the golden idol, the boulder (the boulder, people), the blowgun-armed natives, the vine leap to the plane and finally, the supreme wink of a gag line, delivered by the pilot: “Come on, show a little backbone, will ya?” All in 12 minutes.\n\nAction movies had never before been this supercharged, nor would they be, by virtually anyone else. It’s a perfect entertainment machine, effortlessly involving to teenage boys (fine, guilty as charged) or anyone looking for a pure hit of hotsy-totsy-Nazi escapism. When the dust settles on Spielberg’s career, many fans will point to his childlike sense of wonderment, supported by John Williams’s stirring orchestral scores and infused in the plots themselves. Raiders of the Lost Ark, meanwhile, just throws you in, with little time to think. (We’re hot on the trail of…the power of the Hebrew God?) It might be more of a masterpiece than any of Spielberg’s other triumphs, simply for unearthing the treasure of the chase, running down the magic for a perfect two hours and then, suggestively, hiding it in a dusty warehouse as if to say: Now it’s your turn. Go find it.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: George Miller\n\nCast: Mel Gibson, Bruce Spence, Vernon Wells\n\nBest quote: “Greetings from Lord Humungus, the Warrior of the Wasteland!”\n\nThe killer scene: The first appearance of psychotic mutant Humungus and his band of gibbering drones—both hilarious and disturbing\n\nLife’s a gas\n\nIt’s no accident that the car chase has become one of the foundation stones of popular cinema. Here is everything you could ever require from an action scene distilled into one easy package: speed, intensity, noise, competitiveness, swearing, gunfire, shiny surfaces and things blowing up. And no filmmaker has ever shot a pulse-pounding pedal-to-the-metal pursuit better than Australian legend George Miller, doing everything short of shoving the audience’s face into the fan belt to ensure that we can feel every bump in the road, every grind of the gears, every fender-bending slam.\n\nThe Road Warrior is without doubt Miller’s finest hour as a director, laying down the narrative ground rules in the first 20 minutes or so: Surly postapocalyptic drifter Max (Gibson) agrees to help a group of mullet-haired survivalists drag a truck filled with oil out of the Aussie desert, while a bunch of leather-clad loonies try to stop him. And when Miller pulls out the stops, no director on earth can match him: The closing chase, pitting Max’s V8 Special and accompanying Mack tanker against an army of souped-up dune buggies and rusted-out roadsters, is a symphony of destruction, an epic of excess, and arguably the finest automotive action sequence ever shot.\n\nTom Huddleston\n\nArts and culture journalist\n\nDirector:Quentin Tarantino\n\nCast:Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Daryl Hannah\n\nBest quote:“You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?”\n\nThe killer scene:The Bride unleashes the five-point palm-exploding heart technique.\n\nMother fucker-upper\n\nThough released in two “volumes,” Quentin Tarantino’s extraordinary martial-arts magnum opus is best viewed as one four-hour whole. The action-packed first part achronologically details the roaring rampage of revenge undertaken by the Bride (Uma Thurman), a trained assassin out to slay the former associates who left her and her unborn child for dead. It culminates in the celebrated House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which our sword-wielding heroine takes down a gaggle of masked antagonists and shaves off more than the hair on the head of Lucy Liu’s yakuza villainess. The second volume becomes more contemplative (ass-kicking mobile-home standoff with one-eyed Daryl Hannah notwithstanding) as the Bride closes in on the gang’s leader: her former inamorato Bill (David Carradine, relishing QT’s pop-infused soliloquies). As always with Tarantino, it’s the words that provide the real action, cutting deeper than any blade could.—Keith Uhlich\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:John Woo\n\nCast:John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen\n\nBest quote:“It’s like looking in a mirror, only not.”\n\nThe killer scene: Nicolas Cage, who’s actually John Travolta, gets thrown into a supermax prison, and stages a riot to break himself out.\n\nPersonality crisis\n\nHow’s this for a mainstream movie premise? A cop redefines ‘deep undercover’ by surgically grafting the face of a criminal mastermind onto his own head – a gambit that backfires when said criminal steals his face and crawls in bed with his wife. It sounds preposterous, if not downright insane. Also, the two principals are played by Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. Twenty-five years later, though, you wish contemporary Hollywood would have the guts to try something so bonkers. But Face/Off could’ve easily been nothing more than an ironically entertaining fever dream if anyone other than John Woo were in the director’s chair. With his third and most successful American movie, the Hong Kong action genius finally got a script he could fully sink his teeth into. He blitzes the screen with slow-mo shootouts, eye-popping setpieces and some rad boat chases, allowing the freeform insanity of Cage and Travolta mimicking each other’s mannerisms to achieve an operatic level of intensity. —Matthew Singer\n\nDirector:James Cameron\n\nCast:Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn\n\nBest quote:“Come with me if you want to live.”\n\nThe killer scene: The police station raid, which goes from ominous to thunderous in the space of three little words. (You know them.)\n\nRobots to riches\n\nFor a while, The Terminator was the highest-grossing film of all time in terms of cost-to-profit ratio (it’s since been trounced by The Blair Witch Project). It certainly wasn’t shot for peanuts—$6.4 million was a fair bit of change back in 1984—but James Cameron did manage to squeeze a heck of a lot of bang out of every measly buck. So while it lacks the slick, CG-assisted style and grand scope of its successor (which places on this list at a truly impressive slot yet to come), The Terminator does arguably have the edge in grit, weight and intensity. Add the fact that it was the work of a filmmaker with only one film under his belt (1981’s disastrous Piranha Part Two: The Spawning), it all adds up to something truly impressive: an against-the-odds smash hit that launched the careers of two men who would, over the next decade, completely rewrite the action rule book.—Tom Huddleston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Prachya Pinkaew\n\nCast:Tony Jaa, Petchtai Wongkamlao, Suchao Pongwilai\n\nBest quote:“The fucker never gives up!”\n\nThe killer scene: A running, jumping, high-kicking marketplace confrontation\n\nOld-school Thai\n\nBy the new millennium, filmmakers’ ability to digitally remove support wires changed the onscreen parameters of martial-arts choreography, arguably for the worse. But if Hong Kong and Hollywood had slightly lost the plot, they still did things the old way in Thailand. Enter Phanom Yeerum—a.k.a. Tony Jaa in English–speaking territories—who combined the feline agility of Jackie Chan and punishing close-quarter skills of Jet Li, with his own brand of Muay Thai–influenced destruction. There’s no wire work or CGI in sight as he demolishes the bad people who nicked his village’s Buddha statue, and if he lacks a certain acting presence, his free-flowing parkour-style slinkiness (let’s jump through a ring of razor wire!) more than compensates. The trademark move, however, is the flying elbow to the top of the skull, just one of the many Muay Thai maneuvers with their own special nomenclature. Liked Tony’s “wildcat fight”? Wait till you see his “monkey crossing world”!—Trevor Johnston\n\nDirector: John McTiernan\n\nCast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke\n\nBest quote: “I ain't got time to bleed.”\n\nThe killer scene: The endgame as Arnie’s battered Dutch faces off against his nemesis and comes out on top. For about 15 seconds...\n\nRumble in the jungle\n\nIt ain’t got time to bleed, but that’s only because John ‘Die Hard’ McTiernan’s other action landmark is too busy giving you a furiously visceral funride as its cast of paramilitary beefcakes take on, and mostly lose badly to, an intergalactic killing machine. Somewhere in amongst the flying cartridges and exploding rifle grenades is a critique of American foreign policy in the ‘80s – if it’s in the Central America, it’s a threat and probably needs blasting with a minigun – and in retrospect, probably its environmental policy too (wince as Arnie, Jesse Ventura and co machine-gun the jungle to smithereens). But never mind all that: Predator’s primal joys come in the continuously changing of the odds – never heavily in favour of humankind in the first place – as one after another of its commandos gets offed, leaving only one for the climactic showdown. Luckily, it’s the right one.—Phil de Semlyen\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Paul Greengrass\n\nCast:Matt Damon, Joan Allen, David Strathairn\n\nBest quote:“This is Jason Bourne, the toughest target that you have ever tracked. He is really good at staying alive, and trying to kill him and failing just pisses him off.”\n\nThe killer scene: Grappling their way through a living room and bathroom, Bourne and a resourceful foe become intimate with smashed furniture and tile work.\n\nComing home for vengeance\n\nThe most recent film in our top 20 is a lasting phenomenon and, more critically, an influence on other contemporary movies. When even the Bond franchise begins feeling a little Bourne-ish, you know the tail is wagging the dog. It helps when you have an actor like Matt Damon, turning Robert Ludlum’s stoic literary creation into his signature role, equal parts ferocity and bruised betrayal (and, yes, superhuman reserve). The screenplay proved extra daring in its post-9/11 moment: Bourne returns home to a somber NYC to confront his masters, who perpetuate a state of fear in a decade that needed no more of it. Bourne is an amnesiac beginning to remember his past; Ultimatum, too, reminds us of a panache that’s largely been forgoken. A metal-crunching Manhattan car chase and a phenomenal assassination at London’s Waterloo station are staged by director Paul Greengrass (United 93) with jazzy fluidity.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nDirector:Tsui Hark\n\nCast:Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Xiong Xin-xin\n\nBest quote:“If we are so rotten, how can our country be saved? Where can we go? There’s no escape.”\n\nThe killer scene: Jet Li versus Donnie Yen with absurdly long poles in an absurdly narrow alley\n\nJet Li saves humanity from itself.\n\nIt’s the last days of the Qing dynasty and China is falling apart. The xenophobic White Lotus Cult has declared holy war on foreigners, while the Qing empress is trying to round up and execute Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s revolutionaries. Caught between them is Wong Fei-hung (Jet Li), avatar of Confucian virtue and master of martial arts. An actual Chinese folk hero, Wong Fei-hung featured in over 70 films between 1949 and 1970, but received a new lease on life when director Tsui Hark revived him with 1991’s Once Upon a Time in China. But it’s Part II that the fans love, and it’s easy to see why. A nightmarish phantasmagoria of Chinese-on-Chinese violence, only Wong Fei-hung and his strict moral code (and awesome kung fu) stands against the tidal wave of blood unleashed by religious extremists and government thugs alike. Frankly, we could use some of that today.—Grady Hendrix\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Ted Kotcheff\n\nCast:Sylvester Stallone, Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna\n\nBest quote:“They drew first blood, not me.”\n\nThe killer scene: Sly’s put-upon Vietnam vet proves a point by setting an entire town alight\n\nKeep the home fires burning\n\nThe film that provided Stallone with a post-Rocky career has often seemed an undervalued affair, overshadowed by the cartoonish excesses of its more commercially successful Rambo sequels. But while the bandana-wearing, M60-toting protagonist eventually became an emblem of Reaganite hawkishness, his origin story is shaped by an almost diametrically opposed sensibility: firmly on the side of embittered soldiers isolated by society after the trauma of combat, and critical of America’s weekend-warrior culture for its unforgivably glib attitude toward firearms. From an early flashback in which Sly’s harassed drifter conflates abusive Oregon cops with the Vietcong who once tortured him, it treats the escalating hostilities with convincing gravitas, while stringing together tautly conceived confrontations in and around the mist-shrouded mountain landscape. For all the blade work, gunfire and explosions, though, it’s Sly’s final emotional meltdown that’s most potent of all, a nakedly vulnerable outpouring where John Rambo’s terrifying, pitiable contradictions are laid bare.—Trevor Johnston\n\nDirector:Paul Verhoeven\n\nCast:Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O’Herlihy\n\nBest quote:“Bitches, leave!”\n\nThe killer scene: RoboCop nemesis ED-209 brings a board meeting to a bloody halt.\n\nI was born ’bot\n\nFor his second English-language feature, Dutch bad boy Paul Verhoeven took us to a time in the not-too-distant future when Detroit is a crime-ridden, economically depressed metropolis (who’da thought?) in desperate need of a hero. Enter rookie flatfoot Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), who is literally shot to pieces on his first day and resurrected by the corporate conglomerate OCP as a steely metallic cyborg who serves the public trust, protects the innocent and upholds the law. (Also: shoots would-be rapists in the gonads.) But something human is still stirring inside. The film is both a biting satire of consumer culture—love those interstitial faux commercials—and an emotional character study (Murphy’s flashes of his former home life are tinged with sorrow). But Verhoeven doesn’t skimp on the memorable action, with gunfights aplenty, a death by toxic waste that will have you gleefully cringing, and an awesome antagonist in the trigger.\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirectors: The Wachowskis\n\nCast:Keanu Reeves, Hugo Weaving, Laurence Fishburne\n\nBest quote:“There is no spoon.”\n\nThe killer scene: Stop! Bullet time! The Wachowskis and their tech wizards invent a whole new way of shooting action.\n\nDude, where's my reality?\n\nCombining kick-ass action and chin-stroking philosophy was hardly a new trick, even in 1999. The Wages of Fear is all about the inevitability of death; numerous kung fu flicks contain deeply embedded existentialist ideas; and even The Terminator can be read as a meditation on the implacability of fate. But the way the Wachowskis managed to fuse leather-clad cyberpunk chop-socky thrills with concepts cribbed from Descartes for Beginners still feels fresh and vibrant, 15 years later. To be fair, the central idea is more comfortably old-fashioned and biblical than you might realize: Keanu Reeves’s hero may question his reality at every turn, but so do all saviors of humanity, from Jesus to Batman. What really makes The Matrix fly is the action: With their new “bullet time” technique (essentially a triggered series of hundreds of still photographs taken around a moving subject), the Wachowskis found a way to convincingly “move” the camera within an all-CG environment, revolutionizing action films, music videos and try-hard TV ads for the next decade.—Tom Huddleston\n\nDirector: Sergio Leone\n\nCast: Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards\n\nBest quote: “People scare better when they’re dyin’.”\n\nThe killer scene: Three hired guns wait for Bronson’s gunslinger at the railway station. And wait. And wait a bit more. And then wish they’d waited even longer.\n\nDeath in the dust\n\nSergio Leone’s greatest western and a landmark in the genre, Once Upon a Time in the West somehow reinforces the myths of the old west and pulls them apart all at once. It’s there in the casting of Henry Fonda, a long-time upstanding good guy in the genre, as a chilling, child-slaying villain in black. And it’s there in its refusal to equate progress with civilisation (the railroad bring death and corruption in this film) and in its mood of melancholy. With help from Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, Leone pens a dusty requiem to an old way of life that’s embroidered by Ennio Morricone’s musical motifs and delivered with the director’s own trademark extravagance as the bullets begin to fly. Charles Bronson provides an enigmatic centrepiece, with Jason Robarts and Claudia Cardinale delivering swagger and heart – a strange, undefined trio who represent a strange, undefined form of justice.—Phil de Semlyen\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Liu Chia-liang\n\nCast:Gordon Liu, Lo Lieh, Yue Wong\n\nBest quote:“I wish I had learned kung fu instead of studying.”\n\nThe killer scene: When struggling hero Liu finally passes his master’s log-balancing test and gets on his way to becoming a Shaolin warrior\n\nBuddha up\n\nThere are numerous claimants to the title of Greatest Kung Fu Movie Ever, but the one that crops up consistently is Liu Chia-liang’s Buddha-bothering, Wu-Tang Clan–inspiring revolutionary epic The 36th Chamber of Shaolin. The opening credits are a dazzling work of art in themselves, as Gordon Liu performs his high-kicking martial-arts exercises in an empty, spotlit studio, gold bangles jangling on his wrists. Then the story kicks in: Liu plays Liu Yude, a rebellious student who realizes that the only way to help his downtrodden people fight against Manchu oppression is to learn the ancient ways of Shaolin. But the monks abhor violence—will they aid this charismatic renegade? Like its questing hero, The 36th Chamber achieves a near-perfect balance between violent action and keen-sighted moral, spiritual and philosophical inquiry. The training sequences are second to none—water! fire! heavy lifting!—while the final showdown is a fist-pumping triumph.—Tom Huddleston\n\nDirector:Michael Mann\n\nCast:Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer\n\nBest quote:“Don’t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat, if you feel the heat around the corner.”\n\nThe killer scene: Finally, acting giants Al Pacino and Robert De Niro stare each other down across a diner booth—the moment is electric.\n\nCops versus robbers, deluxe\n\nAfter reinventing television in the 1980s with Miami Vice, Michael Mann took his stylish instincts to the big screen, but he didn’t quite get all the parts working until this film, an extraordinary L.A. crime saga with cool-blue depth. Heat is an action fan’s dream, provided that dream includes room for the serious topic of professional compromise, marital dysfunction and parental abandonment. The movie’s main protagonists—Vincent (Pacino), a hard-driving lieutenant, and Neil (De Niro), a wary career criminal looking for that proverbial last job—both have commitment issues; their game of cat and mouse involves a ton of collateral damage. (Pay note to a 14-year-old Natalie Portman, whose fragile character could use a dad.) When the movie breaks out the guns, it becomes abstractly beautiful, especially during a brazen midday bank robbery scored to Brian Eno’s pumping synth beats. It’s a scene of urban warfare that’s never been eclipsed.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Lau Kar-Leung\n\nCast:Jackie Chan, Ken Lo, Lung Ti\n\nBest quote:[Looking at bottle label] “What does it mean when there’s a picture of a skull?”\n\nThe killer scene: Jackie, an opponent and a wooden bench—it becomes a woozy dance for three.\n\nThe highest kick of all\n\nDon’t be surprised that some sequels place highly on our list. Few genres are as rewarding as action when it comes to second chapters upping the ante, improving on the stunts, pumping up the explosions. Jackie Chan proved himself the king of subsequent installments as his career entered its golden phase in the 1990s. Wong Fei Hung is one of Chan’s most likable creations: the dutiful son of a teacher who nonetheless brings shame upon his family by pursuing the unpredictable art of “drunken boxing,” all dizzying feints and unexpected blows. And it turns out that actually getting soused helps the practitioner; several scenes in Drunken Master II have Chan desperately smashing bottles and guzzling down their contents for strength, even as his challengers rush him. The film’s extended, fire-breathing climax is a high point of Chan’s Peking Opera–trained artistry, a master class in hand-to-hand combat with a video-game–like frenzy.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nDirector:Jackie Chan\n\nCast:Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao\n\nBest quote:“Big Nose, if you don’t jump now, forget about making any more films.”\n\nThe killer scene: A three-story drop from a clock tower with no safety nets\n\nBig stunts, big chases, big action: the first “real” Jackie Chan movie\n\nThe aforementioned quote was shouted at Jackie by his “big brother,” Sammo Hung, as Chan clung to the face of a clock tower for a week, terrified of the three-story fall he was about to take. But with the aid of Sammo’s gentle abuse, Jackie let go, and the rest is history. The first Jackie Chan movie to combine large-scale stunts with balls-out action, Project A also cemented his onscreen persona as the ultimate Hong Kong everyman, a working-class guy who just wants to get through the day, and maybe take his girlfriend out for dinner. That a gang of pirates doesn’t want that to happen is merely an exasperating complication, like crosstown traffic. Whether he’s staging a bike chase down back alleys, swinging from a chandelier, or almost breaking his neck, it’s Jackie’s endless physical resourcefulness in the face of overwhelming odds that feels like a refreshing shower for your soul.—Grady Hendrix\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Richard Donner\n\nCast:Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Gary Busey\n\nBest quote:“I’m too old for this shit.”\n\nThe killer scene: Gibson and Busey’s stripped-to-the-waist showdown in the rain, the most hilariously homoerotic sequence in Mad Mel’s filmography\n\nGibson on top\n\nWhere would Mel Gibson be without Lethal Weapon, his big Hollywood breakthrough? We like to imagine him back in Oz, far from the cruel attentions of the tabloid press, sinking a few cold ones after a hard day’s work on Australian TV’s Home and Away. Would he have been happier that way? We’ll never know. What we do know is that the world would’ve been robbed of one of the great buddy duos in movie history, not to mention several of its most perfectly delivered wisecracks. The Lethal Weapon series went pretty wildly off the rails in later installments, but the original remains a heady blast of vigilante nihilism, reveling in scenes of excessive drug use, execution and torture (a theme Mel would return to regularly throughout his career). But it’s in balancing these scenes with the cozy suburban warmth of Glover’s family life that the screenplay (by then-25-year-old Shane Black) finds its center, and becomes more than just another full-throttle beat-’em-up.—Tom Huddleston\n\nDirector:John Woo\n\nCast:Chow Yun Fat, Danny Lee, Sally Yeh\n\nBest quote:“Good people are usually misunderstood.”\n\nThe killer scene: A final assault in the church is bloodily, dramatically, spiritually excessive in every way.\n\nBrothers in arms\n\nThe most dementedly elegiac thriller you've ever seen, distilling a lifetime's enthusiasm for American and French film noir, with little Chinese about it apart from the soundtrack and the looks of the three beautiful leads. It started out as a homage to Martin Scorsese and Jean-Pierre Melville, but the limitless arsenal of guns and rocket-launchers appears to have gotten in the way. Exquisitely-tailored contract killer Jeff (Chow Yun-Fat, Hong Kong's finest actor) accidentally damages the sight of nightclub singer Jennie while blasting a dozen gangsters to kingdom come. He befriends the near-blind girl, and decides to take One Last Job to finance the cornea graft she needs. There are half-a-dozen mega-massacres along the way, plus extraordinary spasms of sentimentality, romance and soul searching.\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Peter Yates\n\nCast:Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn, Jacqueline Bisset\n\nBest quote:“Time starts now.”\n\nThe killer scene: McQueen + 1968 Ford Mustang + San Francisco = action-film history\n\nCut to the chase\n\nIf car chases over the hilly streets of San Francisco are what gets your heart a-pumpin’, this quintessential ’60s shoot-’em-up is the movie for you. Steve McQueen could not be cooler—we like the whole turtleneck-with-shoulder-holster look—and the thing moves faster than a speeding…um…what’s that word again? These action sequences are brilliant: crisp and done without trickery in real locations, lending an extraordinary sense of immediacy to the shenanigans and gunfights.\n\nDirector: Gareth Evans\n\nCast: Iko Uwais, Joe Taslim, Donny Alamsyah\n\nBest quote: ‘Let's clean this city’s mess!’\n\nThe killer scene: Indonesian SWAT-teamer Rama uses a fridge, a gas canister and a grenade to improvise a corridor-clearing weapon. Do not try this in Homebase\n\nBet you’re glad you didn’t pay the management fee\n\nBy one of those weird bits of movie happenstance, two films with almost identical plots came out close together in the early 2010s: Dredd and this Indonesian actioner from Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans. And it’s no disrespect to the former that it’s The Raid that we’re still talking about a decade or so later. Scratch that, it’s The Raid that we’re still recovering from. The set-up, of course, involves a law enforcer battling their way to reach a superbad at the top of a tower block. That man is charismatic pencak silat superstar Iko Uwais, who pulls out moves we didn’t even know the human body was capable of in punching, stabbing, kicking and hammering his way up myriad storeys of an unusually dangerous housing project. It’s almost too much, except Evans remembers to throw in moments of (relatively) light relief and humanity to help catch our breath before the next round of pummelling starts. The best action film of the decade? Very possibly.—Phil de Semlyen\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Buster Keaton\n\nCast: Buster Keaton, Marion Mack, Glen Cavender\n\nBest quote: ‘If you lose this war, don't blame me.’\n\nThe killer scene: Keaton rides the cowcatcher of an actual moving train and tosses one dislodged railroad tie at another in order to avoid derailment. It’s crazier than it looks – if he mistimed it at all, the movie might be famous for entirely grimmer reasons.\n\nI choo-choo-choose you\n\nLong before Jackie Chan, Tom Cruise or the Jackass franchise, there was Buster Keaton, cinema’s original pratfall artist and the actor who redefined the boundaries of just how far a movie star could or should go to personally entertain an audience. ‘Movie magic’ had just barely been invented when the guy tossed it all out and said: ‘Screw all that, I’m doing this shit for real,’ and The General is perhaps his greatest achievement, both as a film and as a feat of daredevilry most studios would never dare to insure today. Set during the American Civil War, Keaton plays a Confederate railroad engineer whose beloved locomotive is stolen by Union spies with his paramour aboard. (Yes, the Union are the villains. Hey, it was the ’20s.) Cue what’s effectively a movie-length chase scene, filled with legit cannonfire, bridge derailments and the aforementioned cowcatcher scene, still one of the most famous stunts in film history. Sure, The General is the oldest full-length feature on this list, but it’s not simply a historical milemarker. Even a century later, it leaves jaws slack and hearts racing. —Matthew Singer\n\nDirector:William Friedkin\n\nCast:Gene Hackman, Fernando Rey, Roy Scheider\n\nBest quote:“If that’s not a drop, I’ll open up a charge for you at Bloomingdale’s.”\n\nThe killer scene:Gene Hackman chasing a subway train—by car\n\nHere froggy, froggy\n\nMost of The French Connection involves action of the moody, low-key sort, with Gene Hackman as Popeye, a no-nonsense, fists-flying detective on the trail of some big-time French drug importers (“Frog One” and “Frog Two” as the cops call them) in early-1970s New York City. Director William Friedkin sucks up the sights and menacing sizzle of the rundown, wintry metropolis, with a shouty, near-comic raid on a Brooklyn dive bar and ample shots of wet streets, looming bridges and packed subway trains. It’s a master class in tense, doc-style location shooting. But a set piece for the ages comes late in the game, as Popeye commandeers a passing car to chase a hijacked subway train under its elevated track (Friedkin’s camera is mounted on both train and automobile). A final, anticlimactic shoot-out also lingers in memory.—Dave Calhoun\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Michael Curtiz and William Keighley\n\nCast:Errol Flynn, Basil Rathbone, Olivia de Havilland\n\nBest quote:“You’re a bold rascal, Robin!”\n\nThe killer scene: Flynn and Rathbone’s climactic sword fight as all hell breaks loose in Nottingham Castle\n\nSword of Sherwood\n\nErrol Flynn robs from the rich, gives to the poor and winks at the ladies in what is still the greatest screen version of this durable legend. Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains head an outstanding supporting cast. Way, way too much fun. The movie’s rich three-strip Technicolor gives the whole thing a picture-book quality, yet what we’re seeing here with Flynn at his zenith is actually the forebearer of James Bond, Indiana Jones et al.: the sheer essence of the celluloid action hero.\n\nDirector:Mark L. Lester\n\nCast:Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rae Dawn Chong, Dan Hedaya\n\nBest quote: ‘Let off some steam, Bennett.’\n\nThe killer scene: The shopping mall brawl to end them all, in which Arnie fights off a gaggle of hapless security guards, pursues the lead baddie to the parking garage, gets run over by a convertible and just keeps on coming.\n\nThe original Matrix\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has been in better movies, but no movie really got him like Commando. He was already a star by the time he made this shamelessly violent, unapologetically absurd shoot-’em-up, but this is the film that solidified the Arnie cliche in the popular imagination. He redefines ‘one-man wrecking crew’ as hilariously named retired army colonel John Matrix, who goes on an all-time rampage after terrorists kidnap his daughter (a young Alyssa Milano), full of ridiculously huge explosions that send anonymous henchman flipping through the air like Olympic gymnasts, some improbable stealth manoeuvring from a man the size of a redwood and a handful of the greatest one-liners he’s ever delivered. (Although the funniest scene might be the opening montage depicting his placid home life, showing Matrix happily feeding a deer and casually carrying a tree trunk over his shoulder.) It’s certainly trashier than many of the films on this list, but it’s also more purely fun than most of them. Honestly, if you can’t appreciate this kind of magnificently dumb spectacle, then maybe you don’t really like action movies. —Matthew Singer\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Ang Lee\n\nCast:Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Ziyi Zhang\n\nBest quote:“A sword by itself rules nothing. It only comes alive in skilled hands.”\n\nThe killer scene: The breathtaking dance to the death 60 feet high up in a bamboo forest\n\nFloat like a butterfly, sting with a sword\n\nIf you first saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in a cinema, you’ll remember the gasps in the audience during the first major fight sequence, as Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi float up from the ground as if gravity has stopped working its magic. Astonishingly beautiful, this is an action film loved even by those who hate such things. The plot concerns a warrior, Li Mu Bai (Chow), who, about to retire, entrusts his sword to Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh); their unspoken love is the heart and soul of the film. Zhang plays the daughter of a local governor who has secretly learned martial arts. Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee has said he wanted to make a tribute to the wuxia films he grew up with. The film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film and scored the highest-ever box-office gross in the U.S. for a film not in English (it wasn’t really about talk to begin with).—Cath Clarke\n\nDirector:Sammo Hung\n\nCast:Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao\n\nBest quote:“Pigeons—the disciples of capitalism. Goldfish—the disciples of communism. Got it?”\n\nThe killer scene: The final fight to end all final fights\n\nThe Three Dragons execute a flawless kung fu rom-com\n\nJackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao grew up together in a harsh Chinese opera school, and you’d have to go back to the Marx brothers to find performers with their kind of chemistry. In Dragons, Jackie plays a sleazebag attorney defending a slimeball who polluted a nice lady’s fish hatchery. Blocked by the opposing lady lawyer, he hires a small-time crook (“Big Brother” Sammo) and an unhinged surveillance expert (“Little Brother” Yuen) to help him entrap the defendants, but then everyone falls in love. The three amigos can’t stop fighting long enough to do their jobs, but the jokes end with a final fight in a drug lab that is, quite simply, one of the greatest action scenes of all time. This marked the last time the three brothers all worked together, but they went out in style, setting the screen on fire and breaking every jaw in sight.—Grady Hendrix\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Park Chan-wook\n\nCast:Choi Min-sik, Yoo Ji-tae, Kang Hye-jeong\n\nBest quote: ‘Even though I'm no more than a monster, don't I, too, have the right to live?’\n\nBest scene: It’s not really an ‘action scene’ per se, but the moment when Choi Min-sik consumes a live octopus – a real live octopus, mind you – will tie your guts in knots as much as anything else.\n\nStop! Hammer time\n\nDoes Park Chan-wook’s new Korean classic count as an action movie, in the technical sense? Sure, it’s got some banger sequences – emphasis on ‘bang’ – but it could also slot in as a horror film, or a melodrama, or a psychological thriller. In truth, Oldboy belongs to a genre entirely of its own design. But those aforementioned action scenes… well, goddamn. Most of the other directors on this list would give up their filmographies for a sequence as awesome as the side-scrolling hallway fight, as vengeful father Oh Dae-su (a mesmerising Choi Min-sik) mows down a whole crew of henchmen using only a hammer. In a vacuum, it’s monumentally badass. But like the rest of the film, it’s a moment shot through with both sadness and futility, as the movie barrels toward the protagonist’s ultimate, shocking denouement. Again, Oldboy isn’t an action movie in the way others here are – it’s more like a Greek tragedy for the video game era. – Matthew Singer\n\nDirector:George P.

(“Sir, do we get to win this time?” our hero asks beforehand.) The perma-sweaty, muscle-bound Sly grunts and grimaces his way through a string of violent set pieces, mercilessly slaying faceless villains with whichever tools are lying around: fishing lines, bazookas, or, in one memorable scene, an exploding arrowhead. Most critics, alarmed by the fantastical anti-Communist politics on display, slammed First Blood Part II. It also waltzed away with a whopping five Razzie Awards. But audiences didn’t care: It became the first film to play on over 2,000 screens in the U.S., and Sly’s third-biggest box-office success to date. Moreover, its blend of high-octane widescreen action and ever-spiraling body count helped set the template for a new breed of OTT action movie.—Ashley Clark\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:John Woo\n\nCast:Ti Lung, Chow Yun Fat, Leslie Cheung\n\nBest quote:“I am God.”\n\nThe killer scene: Chow Yun Fat, two guns, and some potted plants take out the trash\n\nThe big bang that birthed a billion heroic bloodshed movies\n\nJohn Woo’s career was in the toilet when he and Tsui Hark decided to remake Patrick Lung Kong’s 1967 classic, Story of a Discharged Prisoner. Channeling all his frustrations into the script, A Better Tomorrow ushered in a new era of ballistic brotherhood. Ti Lung plays a crook, just out of the slammer, caught between patching things up with his little brother, a cop (Leslie Cheung), and staying away from his old boss (Waise Lee) who wants him back in the game. When the pressure gets to be too much, things explode into two-gunned action with the help of his old comrade-in-arms, Mark (Chow Yun Fat), onetime king of cool, now a limping squeegee man. Written in fire and blood, the image of Mark, a gun in each hand, trench coat flapping like black wings, branded itself into the brains of a generation of action fans, and still appears in movies to this day.—Grady Hendrix\n\nDirector:Kathryn Bigelow\n\nCast:Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, Gary Busey\n\nBest quote: \"They only live to get radical.”\n\nThe killer scene: After a high-speed foot chase through the backstreets – and backyards – of Los Angeles, Johnny Utah finally has Bodhi cornered… but he just can’t pull the trigger, so to speak.\n\nThe first time a person watches Point Break, it’s typically with a certain level of ironic detachment. C’mon, a movie about Keanu Reeves as an ex-college football player turned hotshot detective named Johnny Utah going undercover to bust a gang of SoCal surfer bank robbers led by Patrick Swayze as a hunky zen master known only as Bodhi? Sure, hilarious premise, but is this a film we’re really supposed to take seriously? Then, somewhere around your 20th viewing, you realise your palms still get sweaty during Keanu’s parachuteless skydive and your jaw still goes slack during that iconic foot chase, and you see Point Break for the absolute guilt-free, high-octane, sky-shooting, pitbull-tossing, vaguely homoerotic banger that it is. Not that it isn’t laugh-out-loud absurd at points… or at basically every point. But that’s precisely what makes it one of the most fun, immortally rewatchable action-thrillers ever made, from your first viewing to your 200th. —Matthew Singer\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Stephen Chow\n\nCast:Stephen Chow, Yuen Wah, Bruce Leung\n\nBest quote:“I want to be bad.

There’s a reason it’s on this list of the greatest stunts ever.\n\nWell, HALO there\n\nFrom Fast and Furious to the mass of superhero movies, all franchises lose their spark in the end. Not Mission Impossible and definitely not Fallout, a sixth instalment that builds on the strengths of Ghost Protocol to deliver a taut, tense and thrilling blockbuster. What it might lack in visual aesthetic it trades for a string of unthinkable action setpieces, making it the most daring instalment since Brian De Palma’s slick 1996 original, director Christopher McQuarrie keeps things moving at lightning speed. No action sequence is allowed to falter: from the brutal bathroom beatdown, to the hair-raising HALO jump, to the climactic helicopter-on-helicopter battle – and all without resorting to heavy CGI or clever editing. Cruise’s masochistic dedication to entertaining the moviegoing masses makes this one of the most exhilarating mainstream action films in recent years. Mission accomplished.—Yu An Su\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Richard Brooks\n\nCast:Lee Marvin, Burt Lancaster, Claudia Cardinale\n\nBest quote:“Let’s go to work.”\n\nThe killer scene: The explosive dawn raid on the kidnappers’ hideaway\n\nSpecial delivery\n\nActive from the 1940s to the mid-’80s, writer-director Richard Brooks exemplified the extraordinary changes Hollywood went through during that time, and this all-star Western marks the transition between old-school Hollywood entertainment and the darker tone of the post-studio era. The film takes a men-on-a-mission scenario (old soldiers Marvin, Lancaster and Robert Ryan head south of the border to rescue kidnap victim Cardinale) and infuses it with star-driven banter, intermittent action highlights, and much musing on the transient nature of idealism by hardened pros. While the gunplay and the assault on the villains’ hideout are certainly tame by Sam Peckinpah standards, the characters’ sense that they’re mere hirelings with nothing left to believe in definitely anticipates The Wild Bunch, making this a movie that’s perfectly enjoyable on its own terms, but even more fascinating when viewed in the wider context of what was to come.—Trevor Johnston\n\nDirector:Wilson Yip\n\nCast:Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Simon Yam\n\nBest quote:“I want to fight ten people.”\n\nThe killer scene: Opponent has a large sword, Donnie has a dried cattail. Place your bets.\n\nKeep calm and carry on\n\nBest not look here for a historically accurate portrayal of the eminent real-life martial artist Ip Man, who later mentored Bruce Lee and recently inspired Wong Kar-wai’s latest offering, The Grandmaster. The facts are sacrificed for yet another commercially savvy epic of Chinese national resistance against Japanese invaders. What you will find, however, is a great role for the occasionally wooden Donnie Yen, whose straight-backed demeanor and lightning moves make him more dramatically convincing than usual as the reserved bourgeois adherent of the wing chun school, discovering his true role as inspirational leader during his community’s darkest hour. While the action highlights are inventive and crunching in equal measure (particularly when Yen gets his hands on various handy implements), director Yip’s careful, nuanced unfolding of the protagonist’s progress makes this a surprisingly engrossing watch, even for martial-arts skeptics.—Trevor Johnston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Wilson Yip\n\nCast:Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung, Wu Jing\n\nBest quote:“He used to be real cool. He turned a suspect into a half-wit with only one punch.”\n\nThe killer scene: A semi-improvised alleyway beatdown\n\nThe rebirth of Hong Kong cool\n\nIn 2005, Hong Kong action cinema was dead. Then Wilson Yip, director of junk like The Mummy, Donnie Yen, a 42-year-old also-ran, and Sammo Hung, then serving time in movie jail, came out of nowhere with this sleek butt-kicker that shot 50,000 volts through the genre’s heart. Inspector Chan (Simon Yam) has been trying to arrest triad kingpin Po (Hung) for years but now he’s got a brain tumor. Inspector Ma (Yen) is taking over his cases and who cares? But Yip serves up these cliches with Dark Knight levels of bleakness, and Donnie Yen delivers intense badassery that is downright religious in its sheer conviction, culminating in a semi-improvised back-alley brawl, followed by a smackdown with Sammo that only ends when every table in the world is broken.—Grady Hendrix\n\nDirector:William Wyler\n\nCast:Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet\n\nBest quote:“Hate keeps a man alive—it gives him strength.”\n\nThe killer scene: Hold tight for the epic chariot race to end ’em all\n\nSwing low, sweet chariot\n\nIt’s got a cast of thousands, stretches of religiosity, a dab of leprosy and even a cameo from Our Lord Jesus, but the chariot race remains the prime reason this sword-and-sandal Oscar winner represents a strain of pre-digital epic cinema we’ll never see again. Before Charlton Heston faced off against enemy Stephen Boyd in this film’s vast Circus Maximus set built at Rome’s Cinecittà, Hollywood action sequences involved the second unit covering the stunt work, then the editor dropping in back-projected inserts of the star. Ben-Hur changed the game forever, since Heston and Boyd trained for months to handle chariots in close-up, ace stunt coordinator Yakima Canutt’s team provided death-defying spills, and director William Wyler planned his widescreen camera angles so the whole assembly worked as a dynamic construct. The white-knuckle realism still works thrillingly, and—George Lucas’s Phantom Menace rerun included—simply can’t replicated by today’s pixel-crunching technology.—Trevor Johnston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:James Cameron\n\nCast:Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton\n\nBest quote:“Can you hurry up? My horse is getting tired.”\n\nThe killer scene: The guns-blazing helicopter chase across the Florida Keys’ seven-mile bridge\n\nHezbollah-a-poppin’\n\nBack in the 1990s, Islamic terrorism was a big goof. James Cameron could happily present a gang of wanna-be nuclear bombers as pratfalling jokers, bungling their way through a suicide mission like Allah’s own Keystone Kops. Now, of course, it doesn’t seem quite so amusing. What does still work, however, is the central conceit, based on a little-seen 1991 French comedy called La Totale! Part James Bond, part Homer Simpson and part his own bad self, Arnie plays it to the hilt as Harry Tasker, an undercover CIA agent who leads a double life as a suburban family man—at least until wife Jamie Lee Curtis smells a rat. One of Cameron’s lightest, least apocalyptic projects (the occasional atomic explosion aside), True Lies is a film of simple, perfectly executed pleasures: gun battles, helicopter chases and saucy screwball misunderstandings. Those terrorists still leave a bad taste, though.­—Tom Huddleston\n\nDirector:Tsui Hark\n\nCast:Zhao Wen-zhuo, Xiong Xin-xin, Song Nei\n\nBest quote:“I kill pigs for money.”\n\nThe killer scene: A final fight unfolding so fast, it blisters your eyes\n\nThe Unforgiven of martial-arts movies\n\nTsui Hark deconstructs the world of chivalrous heroes, turning it into a man-eat-dog hellscape where mercy is just another word for “weakness.” Reimagining Chang Cheh’s landmark 1967 film, The One-Armed Swordsmen, as a psychotronic phantasmagoria full of scars and tattoos, mutilation, amputation, sexual frustration and heavy chunks of steel-splitting muscle and breaking bones, Tsui rolls his superstylized camera through the dirt and turns the freeze-frame into a tombstone. Sharp Manufacturers is a sword factory protected from the violence raging outside its walls by Master, who tolerates zero nonsense. But his daughter (Song Nei) is bored and decides to play with the help, manipulating two apprentice sword makers into a contest for her affections, unleashing a tidal wave of sex and blood that drowns them all. By the time the last body hits the ground, the audience has been battered into submission.—Grady Hendrix\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Luc Besson\n\nCast:Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman\n\nBest quote:“I like these calm little moments before the storm. It reminds me of Beethoven.”\n\nThe killer scene: Gary Oldman guns down Natalie Portman’s family in a cramped Manhattan apartment while under the influence.\n\nThe oddest odd couple\n\nHollywood action meets European art house in Luc Besson’s first American film. This is the most twisted Pygmalion story in the history of cinema, in which a hangdog lonely hit man, Léon (Jean Reno), teaches streetwise 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman) the art of killing after a psychotic cop (Gary Oldman) takes out her family. The pair finds redemption in each other: Léon, a man who calls the houseplant on his windowsill his best friend, learns to love; Mathilda finds security and strength. The film splits audiences: Is their relationship sweetly touching or, given her age, troubling? Is Oldman the scariest, most deranged villain since Jack Nicholson in The Shining? Or an overacting ham? Wherever you stand, Léon is slick, stylish and unpredictable, with its share of explosive action scenes.—Cath Clarke\n\nDirector:Doug Liman\n\nCast:Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper\n\nBest quote:“You’re U.S. government property—you’re a malfunctioning $30 million weapon.”\n\nThe killer scene: Death by ballpoint pen when Bourne takes out a machine-gun–armed assassin in his Paris apartment\n\nHe’s on his own side now\n\nDirector Doug Liman considered Russell Crowe and Sylvester Stallone to play the CIA operative with a hard-core case of amnesia. Now it’s impossible to imagine any actor other than Matt Damon in the role. Watching The Bourne Identity, the first film in the series, Damon looks touchingly young, bringing vulnerability to the near-superhuman Jason Bourne, who is pulled out of the sea by fishermen with bullets in his back and his memory wiped. The mega-successful conspiracy-thriller franchise has reinvented the genre, kick-starting a new generation of gritty action movies by lending them the texture of real life. You can certainly trace Bourne in Daniel Craig’s 007 films, but, according to Damon, there are a million miles between Bourne and Bond, whom he calls “a misogynist, an imperialist. He’s all the things that Bourne isn’t. He kills people, then drinks a martini.” The protectiveness is sweet, really.—Cath Clarke\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Henri-Georges Clouzot\n\nCast:Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck\n\nBest quote:“When someone else is driving, I’m scared.”\n\nThe killer scene:The bitter end, which fulfills the bleak promise the entire film has been making all along\n\nTrucking hell\n\nBefore the rise of Lucy’s Luc Besson and his cavalcade of Eurotrash shoot-’em-ups, the French were not a nation noted for their propensity for cinematic action. They seemed to prefer films about cigarette-smoking intellectuals, shabby policemen and gone-to-seed strippers—not, say, giant robots who enjoy smashing stuff. But there was a time, long ago, when nail-biting thrills and tough philosophical statements about man’s inhumanity could sit quite comfortably side by side, a trend that reached its peak with Henri-Georges Clouzot’s dizzying The Wages of Fear. The tale of four hopeless losers forced by poverty and desperation to take a job driving trucks filled with nitroglycerine dynamite across the worst roads in the Amazon jungle, this is an unrelentingly sweaty, grimy, dread-filled experience. But it’s also one of the cinema’s toughest, least forgiving portraits of men on the edge, barreling toward certain death and bitching miserably every inch of the way.—Tom Huddleston\n\nDirector:Chad Stahelski and an uncredited David Leitch\n\nCast:Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen\n\nBest quote:“People keep asking if I'm back and I haven't really had an answer. But now, yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.”\n\nThe killer scene: Wick takes out henchmen in a neon-lit dance club filled with pounding techno and appreciative onlookers.\n\nKeanu, rising\n\nAn action franchise was born and we took notice. John Wick (Keanu Reeves, channeling his euphoric whoa of yore) is a recent widower and secret assassin whose final gift from his cancer-stricken wife—a floppy-eared beagle—is snuffed out with a sad little yelp during a brutal home invasion by Russian thugs. Wick recovers in record time, then out come the guns, the rifles and the mysterious gold coins, as Game of Thrones' hapless Alfie Allen (forever destined to be a picked-upon target) finds himself pursued by a ruthless, legendary killing machine that every other character seems wise enough to fear. John Wick is action manna for its cleanly designed gun-fu sequences, ones you can actually follow. The film's codirectors, veteran stunt experts, have designed the movie within an eye for impact, and there's an elegant sparseness here that's thrilling. We didn’t go in expecting poetry but we’re glad we went.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Wilson Yip\n\nCast:Donnie Yen, Louis Koo, Ngai Sing\n\nBest quote:“Stop trying to be cool all the time! Why don’t you just arrest people?”\n\nThe killer scene: The final half hour of nonstop, thighs-around-face mayhem\n\nDonnie Yen stars in the most Donnie Yen movie ever.\n\nFor the audience who found its Kill Zone—S.P.L. too intellectual, Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen deliver Flash Point, which is to martial-arts movies what MMA is to gay porn: unconscious macho camp. But like all good drag shows, it’s also a total guilty pleasure. Donnie Yen doubles down on his self-conscious cool, all peacock struts, leather jackets and skinny jeans as he infiltrates a Vietnamese gang with undercover buddy Wilson (Louis Koo). The two bros frequently meet on the beach, topless, to see who has the better bod. The first 50 minutes are devoted to characters repeating that Donnie is a “loose cannon.” The final 30 minutes are a nonstop orgy of mayhem showcasing Donnie’s new-school action choreography that features boxing, judo, MMA, Muay Thai and karate. The greatest metaphor for this flick is its central image of a ticking time bomb stuffed inside a roast turkey.—Grady Hendrix\n\nDirector:Zack Snyder\n\nCast:Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, Dominic West\n\nBest quote:“My arm!” “It’s not yours anymore.”\n\nThe killer scene: The astonishingly intense final fight, marking the end of Leonidas\n\nGreeks for geeks (of the action variety)\n\nIn this blistering (and gloriously campy) historical epic, director Snyder makes remarkable use of computer technology to bring Frank Miller’s sprawling graphic novel to life. With its stunningly detailed visuals, rigorously controlled color scheme and clean, episodic storytelling, it remains the purest example to date of cinema-as-comic book. A murderer’s row of quality acting talent—including Gerard Butler, Michael Fassbender and Dominic West—lines up to stab, spear and slash their way through a blood-spattered retelling of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae. Special mention should be made of Rodrigo Santoro, who gives a deliciously ripe performance as the bejeweled, pierced and ultra-sadistic villain Xerxes. The film inspired a dismal spoof (Meet the Spartans) and a feeble sequel (300: Rise of an Empire), but laid the groundwork for a new wave of brutal, sexed-up sword-and-sandal fare like Spartacus: Blood and Sand and HBO’s Game of Thrones.—Ashley Clark\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Sammo Hung\n\nCast:Yuen Biao, Lam Ching-ying, Sammo Hung\n\nBest quote:“You sissy! What kind of cult kung fu was that?”\n\nThe killer scene: A duel with an opponent whose knuckles drip with heavy jade rings\n\nA vindication of the badassery of wing chun\n\nLet’s learn about wing chun! Founded by a Buddhist nun, this fighting style with its up-close contact and low kicks is constantly dissed as sissy fu, but The Prodigal Son dumps that junk in a grave. Yuen Biao plays a cocky kung fu brat whose rich daddy secretly pays his opponents to lose. When a Chinese opera company comes through town, its cross-dressing diva, Leung (Lam Ching-ying), turns out to be a wing chun master who teaches the brawling brat a lesson. Yuen is suddenly desperate to become Leung’s student—and Leung is just as desperate for that not to happen. Lam Ching-ying (Bruce Lee’s stunt double) struts his stuff as the asthmatic Leung, with shaved eyebrows and a beanpole physique. An actual student of wing chun, Lam dispenses elegant beatdowns in fights that turn into musical numbers, as well as wrist-locking, joint-cracking battles fought on narrow gang planks.—Grady Hendrix\n\nDirector:Sammo Hung\n\nCast:Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, Joyce Mina Godenzi\n\nBest quote:“It’s the Americans’ fault. They got us into this. Fucking America! Goddamn America!”\n\nThe killer scene: Coconuts, vines and palm fronds become deadly weapons.\n\nIf Sammo Hung had been in charge, we’d have won Vietnam.\n\nOne of Sammo’s four masterpieces, Eastern Condors is a Vietnam War movie that replaces politics with punching, angst with ass-kicking. It’s 1976 and the Pentagon offers Sammo and 11 other Chinese prisoners a deal: go back to Vietnam and destroy a weapons cache they left behind and be given their freedom. But before boots even hit the ground, the mission goes totally FUBAR—it’s canceled halfway through their parachute drop and a teammate nicknamed “Stammer” screws up his rip-cord countdown. Making matters worse, an elite Vietcong kill squad is on their trail, led by Yuen Wah, a giggling, fan-flicking psychopath who minces into action before ripping out shoulder blades. Brimming over with Russian roulette, tiger cages, child soldiers and phenomenal female-freedom fighters, the climax features eight of Hong Kong’s best martial artists going at it hammer and tongs, as Hung’s prowling camera glides between three simultaneous fights. Suck it, Oliver Stone.—Grady Hendrix\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Sylvester Stallone\n\nCast: Sylvester Stallone, Julie Benz, Graham McTavish\n\nBest quote:“Burma’s a war zone.”\n\nThe killer scene: Rambo lays waste to a bunch of soldiers with a mounted machine gun.\n\nLast blood?\n\nWhen we last saw one-man army John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) in 1988’s ill-conceived Rambo III, he was riding off into the sunset with the mujahideen. Twenty years later, Islamic freedom fighters are kinda-sorta not in favor, so he’s somehow made his way to Thailand where he works a cushy job as a snake handler. Along come some missionaries on a humanitarian journey to Burma, and Rambo—against his better judgment—agrees to lead them through the war-torn country. How do you think that goes? This is the first time Stallone directed one of his own Rambo scripts, and the film feels infused with his particular brand of cartoonishly monosyllabic machismo, which is perversely a virtue. Think too hard about what happens (every peacenik inevitably turns violent; the villains are child-raping mass murderers) and you’ll see this is as hysterically reactionary as movies get. But Stallone makes his one-sided, pro-interventionist argument with such intoxicating fervor—especially in an astonishingly bloody finale filled with decapitations, bullet-riddled bad guys and a visual equation of Rambo to Jesus Christ—that the fantasy becomes impossible to resist.—Keith Uhlich\n\nDirector:Stanley Kubrick\n\nCast:Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Jean Simmons\n\nBest quote:“A good body with a dull brain is as cheap as life itself.”\n\nThe killer scene: There’s really only one contender here, and it involves the film’s title preceded by the word I’m.\n\nRomanes eunt domus\n\nWhenever critics try to minimize Stanley Kubrick as a cold, monolithic creator, they always get hung up on Spartacus. Here is a film that displays almost none of that master filmmaker’s customary traits: It’s lusty and full-throated, sprawling and sentimental, and as far as it’s possible to get from the clinical, claustrophobic Kubrick of cliché. The director didn’t work on the script (penned by blacklisted leftist Dalton Trumbo), hence all the authority-baiting socialist rhetoric that underpins its mythic account of slave rebellion. Additionally, Kubrick surrendered creative control to producer Kirk Douglas, a move he would never make again. But surely it’s the mark of a great artist to be flexible, and one of the pleasures of Spartacus—particularly in its vast, flaming battle scenes—is feeling that pull between the messy grandiosity of an old-fashioned Hollywood epic and the artistic precision that Kubrick strived to bring to the proceedings. Maybe he should’ve cut loose like this a little more often.—Tom Huddleston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Sammo Hung\n\nCast:Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung\n\nBest quote:“Dumb and crazy are two different things.”\n\nThe killer scene: Chan himself called the final fight with karate world champ Benny “The Jet” Urquidez as a career-best scene.\n\nThe pain in Spain\n\nYears before the 1992 Olympics, Jackie Chan hit Barcelona in this comedy-actioner evidently angled toward international audiences. Ironically, they weren’t so interested, since the humor in this caper—where food-truck partners Chan and Yuen tangle with a mysterious missing heiress—is still very much playing to the Hong Kong market. If not exactly smoothly assembled, the result still has a lot of puppyish charm, with the happy-go-lucky twosome at its fleetest, and the usual quotient of oof-tastic pratfalls. It does take too long to get to warp speed, but by the time Chan and Yuen tackle a team of henchmen in the villain’s castle, the film really takes off—especially when Chan lines up against undefeated world karate champ Benny “The Jet” Urquidez in an encounter whose speed of movement beggars belief. Was there ever a badder dude named after an Elton John song?—Trevor Johnston\n\nDirector:Sergio Leone\n\nCast:Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Eli Wallach\n\nBest quote:“When you have to shoot, shoot. Don’t talk.”\n\nThe killer scene: Three men step onto a sun-baked mesa, preparing to draw in the tensest Mexican standoff in movies.\n\nSome spaghetti with your American beef\n\nItalian maestro Sergio Leone invented a delicious kind of cinematic foreplay—his action scenes explode into violence but you remember the buildups more vividly: sweat collecting on knotted brows, fingers creeping toward triggers and, most iconically, two big eyes filling the screen. Grander spaghetti Westerns were on the horizon (including Leone’s own poetic Once Upon a Time in the West, but arguably, none were as critical as this one), ramping up the brutality that made the genre feel like a subversive comment on an increasingly warlike America. His stars came from Hollywood, but once they arrived in Rome—and, soon after, the Spanish deserts passing for the Old West—they were in a country of one filmmaker’s supreme imagination. So much modern action grammar comes from Leone and his genius composer Ennio Morricone, who transformed twangy doom guitars and shrieking ay-ya-yas into the natural sound of the frontier.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Auguste and Louis Lumière\n\nCast:A train\n\nBest quote:[Silence]\n\nThe killer scene: The locomotive comes right at us.\n\nThe little engine that could\n\nThe legend goes like this: At the premiere of pioneer filmmakers Auguste and Louis Lumière’s one-minute, single-shot document of a train pulling into a coastal French station, audience members jumped out of their seats, convinced the locomotive was racing toward them. Truth or apocrypha? Many scholars have argued for the latter, but the myth took hold and persists to this day. (Martin Scorsese’s 3-D fantasia Hugo even re-creates the purported incident.) Once you hear the tale, it’s impossible to divorce the film from it—the fantasy is too attractive, and it perfectly ties into the ethos of the action movie, which thrives on goosing our emotions by making us believe (if primarily on a subconscious level) that we’re truly in the thick of things. All the bullets we’ve dodged, all the cars we’ve crashed, all the trains we’ve ducked away from, they all start here.—Keith Uhlich\n\nDirector:Richard C. Sarafian\n\nCast:Barry Newman, Cleavon Little, Dean Jagger\n\nBest quote:“The last American hero to whom speed means freedom of the soul.”\n\nThe killer scene:Newman puts pedal to the metal heading straight for a police roadblock.\n\nRoad to nowhere\n\nHe collects the white Dodge Challenger in Denver on Friday at 11:30pm, due for delivery in San Francisco on Monday at 3pm. Impossible? The question doesn’t apply when our antihero’s odyssey is less endurance challenge than existential metaphor for the bleak state of post-’60s America. Sure, there’s something ineffably watchable about these big old gas-guzzlers sliding all over the asphalt as Newman’s Kowalski outmaneuvers police in three states, though director Sarafian’s really interested in the wide, wide shots where the car’s just a speck against a massive landscape. It certainly puts in cosmic context the anti-authoritarian trajectory, allowing an ex–speedway racer to win the hearts of the poor, the black and the hippified as Cleavon Little’s DJ, Super Soul, broadcasts his exploits. A stunningly astringent finale offers no easy solutions for a divided nation. It’s a cool touch—though it would have been cooler had Super Soul put some actual soul music on the mundane rock soundtrack.—Trevor Johnston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Terence Young\n\nCast:Sean Connery, Robert Shaw, Lotte Lenya\n\nBest quote:“Oh, James, will you make love to me all the time in England?”\n\nThe killer scene: The fight between Sean Connery and Robert Shaw in an old-school train compartment, en route from Istanbul\n\nThe Gospel According to Saint James\n\nThe second Bond movie has Sean Connery returning as 007, now sucked into a cat-and-mouse plot when he has to travel to Venice and Istanbul to try and retrieve a code-breaking device. Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya are memorable SPECTRE villains, but this first sequel now stands out for its Hitchcock-Le Carré qualities: a slow-burn plot centered on a train ride through Europe. That said, it also introduces elements repeated since: the signature pre-titles action sequence and a penchant for speedboats and helicopters. It’s somehow both leisurely and brutal.—Dave Calhoun\n\nDirector:Louis Leterrier\n\nCast:Jet Li, Bob Hoskins, Morgan Freeman\n\nBest quote:“Like my saint of a mum used to say, ‘Get ’em young and the possibilities are endless.’”\n\nThe killer scene: Jet Li’s one-punch takedown of an overgrown gimp\n\nJet Li is ready for his close-up now, Mr. DeMille.\n\nConsidered the best actor among the action-hero aristocracy, Jet Li proves that he’s got the chops to play a street kid brutalized from birth to become a human attack dog “unleashed” on the enemies of his mob-boss master, Bob Hoskins. This story of a man-dog running away to live with a gentle piano tuner (played by Morgan Freeman, no less) and his hottie daughter dances right on the razor’s edge of risible, but the feral thesping of Hoskins and surprising charm of Li keep it anchored. So does the brutal action design by Yuen Woo-ping (The Matrix), full of nipple gnawing, head butting and savage smackdowns in narrow bathrooms. It could all be a metaphor for Li’s career. After all, Unleashed is ultimately about a young martial artist who wants to run away from his masters so he can stop beating people up and simply entertain them.—Grady Hendrix\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:George Lucas\n\nCast:Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher\n\nBest quote:“Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.”\n\nThe killer scene: The final trench run, as X-Wing fighters peel off in unison to the sound of John Williams’s triumphant trumpet fanfare\n\nMakin’ wookiee\n\nIn comparison with your average modern blockbuster, in which the story grinds to a halt every 15 minutes to make room for another eye-scorching set piece, there’s very little action in the first Star Wars movie: an extended chase through the Death Star corridors, a perfunctory sword fight between two knightly codgers and a pair of space dogfights, and that’s pretty much it. Sure, to ’70s audiences raised on the creaky likes of Planet of the Apes and TV’s Star Trek, that may have seemed like a lot, but why do modern movie lovers return so regularly and enthusiastically to this particular film? The answer lies in George Lucas’s mythic storytelling and the narrative momentum he manages to sustain throughout. From Star Wars’ opening blast of laser fire to its climactic fireball, it keeps raising the dramatic stakes, giving the impression of action even when the characters are just sitting on their backsides chatting about exhaust ports. It’s a lesson we hope J.J. Abrams has studied well.—Tom Huddleston\n\nDirector:Sammo Hung\n\nCast:Sammo Hung, Lau Kar-leung, Billy Chow\n\nBest quote:“Fatty!

Although it ended his jaw-dropping string of hits, Pedicab Driver remains a charming throwback to old-school Chinese cinema given an adrenalized action injection. Sammo plays a pedicab-driving slob in 1940s Macau, in love with a woman who can’t see past his belly. The movie is mostly a charming comedy of blue-collar manners until a satanically evil pimp takes a piss on paradise. At which point, Sammo straps on his suspenders of justice and marches off to restore order, bare-knuckle style. A celebration of hand-to-hand combat, featuring kung fu legend Lau Kar-leung showing off his chops, this flick does for lumberjack shirts what Bruce Lee did for yellow jumpsuits.—Grady Hendrix\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Takeshi Kitano\n\nCast:Takeshi Kitano, Tadanobu Asano, Yui Natsukawa\n\nBest quote:“Even with my eyes wide open, I can’t see a thing.”\n\nThe killer scene: Zatoichi slices and dices his way through a gang of sword-wielding gangsters, all without batting an eyelid.\n\nIn the kingdom of the blind, a samurai will slice you up.\n\nA combination of oddball surrealism and vicious violence, this 2003 Japanese reboot of the classic samurai series makes for some uncomfortable viewing. The film revolves around Zatoichi, a “blind masseur” who takes it upon himself to single-handedly protect a village from a greedy gang terrorizing the locals with extortionate protection fees. So far, so Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves—but darkness starts slipping in with tales of child prostitution, political assassinations and gory murders. Zatoichi bumbles and stumbles his way through town, slicing up any wrongdoers with a flick of his hidden katana, before eventually leaving a pile of dismembered yakuza bleeding on the ground in a brilliantly graceful final fight. Adding immeasurably: It’s all laced with surreal humor, and the film ends with a massive, choreographed tap-dancing scene.—Eddy Frankel\n\nDirector:Andrei Konchalovsky\n\nCast:Jon Voight, Eric Roberts, Rebecca De Mornay\n\nBest quote:“I’m out of my cage now!”\n\nThe killer scene: Any of Voight’s eyeball-rolling, scenery-chewing soliloquies on the subject of life’s brutality and unfairness\n\nEnter the Voight\n\nA classic case of as-advertised satisfactions, this thunderously OTT action melodrama—adapted from an original outline by Akira Kurosawa—sees Jon Voight’s psychotic convict escape from an Alaskan prison with goofy rapist Eric Roberts in tow. Stowing away on the last freight train back to civilization, the pair realizes it’s in deep trouble when the driver keels over from a heart attack. Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky may be the only man to have worked with both Andrei Tarkovsky (he cowrote Andrei Rublev) and Sylvester Stallone (he would go on to direct the underrated Tango & Cash), and he brings both sensibilities to bear here: Runaway Train isn’t just a high-speed chase flick, it’s also a batshit faux-Shakespearean meditation on man’s animal instincts. The result is completely ludicrous, but as brakes screech, sparks fly, and Voight’s lip-curling nut raises his fists to the sky and curses a hateful God, it’s impossible not to be swept along in the slipstream.—Tom Huddleston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Alfred Hitchcock\n\nCast:Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason\n\nBest quote:“You gentlemen aren’t really trying to kill my son, are you?”\n\nThe killer scene: So many to choose from, but the surreal crop-duster chase is an essential sequence from the Master of Suspense.\n\nA monumental achievement\n\nIt’s easy to forget how radical Hitchcock’s greatest action comedy is, given all the things that make it so deeply 1959: Cary Grant, that impeccable gray suit, a raging Cold War, the ol’ wrong-man scenario. Then again, this is also the film with a brazenly sexual Eva Marie Saint (and that train plunging into the tunnel), as well as a seesawing Bernard Herrmann score that feels like the beginning of all of Hans Zimmer’s ominous blasts. North by Northwest belongs on any serious list of action essentials, at the least for offering up a framework for the upcoming James Bond series. The sheer size of the spectacle Hitchcock served up in VistaVision is still apparent in today’s elephantine offerings; to watch these characters scramble across the impassive face of Mount Rushmore during the climax is to witness the modern action movie being born.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nDirector:Robert Aldrich\n\nCast:Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, John Cassavetes\n\nBest quote:“Donald Duck’s down at the crossroads with a machine gun.”\n\nThe killer scene: Jim Brown’s race for glory ends in disaster in front of the Château Rennes.\n\n12 angry men\n\nNot every corner of London was swinging back in 1967. In and around the suburban Borehamwood studios, a rough-hewn band of Hollywood roustabouts were busy creating a film that stood in direct opposition to the hippie dream—and just about everything else. Brutal, bloodthirsty and belligerent (with a moral compass bent way out of shape), The Dirty Dozen is one of the most unlovely films ever to be released by a major studio. It’s also, of course, an absolute blast, as Lee Marvin’s hard-bitten major recruits 12 death-row inmates for a WWII suicide mission way behind enemy lines. The majority of the film is taken up with scowling, yelling and scrambling up ropes in the training yard, but when the big finale arrives, it’s everything you hoped it would be: The buildup of tension is immaculate, and when the bullets start flying, all hell really does break loose.—Tom Huddleston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Jackie Chan\n\nCast:Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung, Kwok Hung-Lam\n\nBest quote:“Jackie, don’t do anything stupid!”\n\nThe killer scene: A children’s playground provides the perfect setting for Jackie versus various pipe-wielding henchmen.\n\nOnce more with feeling\n\nJackie Chan obviously knew the frisky comedy and life-threatening spills in the original Police Story would be hard to top. So he took a different strategy in the sequel: a more developed procedural plot involving a bomber at large, and a fuller role for concerned girlfriend Maggie Cheung. Unfortunately, all this proves slightly stodgy in practice, rendering the thrills on display somewhat subdued. It’s a shame, really, since taken on its own terms, the action’s very much prime Jackie—not least a couple of dazzlingly fleet fight scenes, plus the addition of a firework-throwing deaf-mute villain. As ever with Chan, the lure here is absolutely no special-effects fakery, and end-credits outtakes reveal the physical toll incurred, not least for costar Cheung, who almost had her scalp ripped off when a stunt went wrong.—Trevor Johnston\n\nDirector:Christopher Nolan\n\nCast:Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart\n\nBest quote:“Why so serious?”\n\nThe killer scene:A shot of the Joker sticking his head out of a speeding car window to taste the night air is at once appealingly puppyish and weirdly terrifying.\n\nSmile, though your heart is breaking\n\nThe first and third installments of Christopher Nolan’s lucrative Batman reboot are, like so much of the director’s work, excessively po-faced and portentous, demanding that the audience swallow the concept of an aristocrat in eyeliner battling crime in a growly porn voice. But sandwiched in the middle came this near-flawless conspiracy thriller, featuring the greatest screen villain since Darth Vader drew his last rattling breath. The announcement of tween-friendly pretty boy Heath Ledger’s casting as the Joker was the cause of huge controversy and debate in the nerdosphere, but the results speak for themselves: This is a hurricane of a performance, as unnerving as it is beautiful to watch—the emergence of a towering talent. Rather than be hemmed in by Nolan’s Swiss-watch directing style, Ledger subverts it at every turn, railing against the prison of action-movie precision in the same way his unhinged character batters at the walls of moral conformity. The result is something very rare in the blockbuster age: true unpredictability.—Tom Huddleston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Martin Scorsese\n\nCast:Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci\n\nBest quote:“You punch like you take it up the ass.”\n\nThe killer scene: Jake LaMotta’s defeat at the hands of Sugar Ray Robinson\n\nGreat punch line\n\nMartin Scorsese’s evocative black-and-white biopic about real-life brawler Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) is an intensely physical movie, tracing with operatic grandeur its protagonist’s life from volatile middleweight contender to an obese has-been. The punches land hard in and out of the ring—LaMotta’s confrontations with his long-suffering wife (Cathy Moriarty) and loyal-to-a-fault brother (Joe Pesci) often seem bloodier than any of the astonishingly visceral slugfests. It’s also a deeply spiritual film, in no small part due to De Niro’s monastic commitment to the role. His much publicized regimen—training with LaMotta himself to get into tip-top fighting condition, then plumping himself up for the final scenes via a four-month eating binge—is the ultimate in actorly sacrifice.—Keith Uhlich\n\nDirector:Don Siegel\n\nCast:Clint Eastwood, Andrew Robinson, John Vernon\n\nBest quote:“I know what you’re thinking, punk…”\n\nThe killer scene: The gibbering Scorpio killer gets an entire bus of hijacked schoolkids to join him in a rendition of “Row, Row, Row Your Boat.”\n\nCleaning up the streets\n\nIn the mid-’90s, rumors abounded of a big-screen adaptation of Alan Moore’s The Dark Knight Returns, set to star Clint Eastwood as Gotham’s glowering caped crusader. But the truth is, Clint had already said everything he needed to say about the fascist appeal of vigilante crime-fighting with this one, arguably his most iconic screen role. Here is the template for every subsequent hard-bitten antihero, Batman included, the major difference being that instead of a millionaire playboy lurking in his mansion, Harry Callahan was blue-collar to his core: a crumpled flatfoot living in a two-room walk-up and existing entirely on a diet of whiskey, cigarettes and slinky bebop jazz. He even had his own Joker to contend with, Andrew Robinson’s giggling Scorpio killer (based on San Francisco’s real-life Zodiac case), whose megalomaniacal schemes laid the groundwork for legions of unhinged comic-book villains to come. Listen closely, and you can almost hear Christopher Nolan frantically scribbling notes.—Tom Huddleston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:David Lean\n\nCast:Alec Guinness, William Holden, Jack Hawkins\n\nBest quote:“This is war! This is not a game of cricket!”\n\nThe killer scene: The climactic bust-up between heroic Holden and madman Guinness is both gripping and tragic.\n\nMen at work\n\nPeople know it better these days from the gang’s demoralized whistling in The Breakfast Club—that’s the “Colonel Bogey March,” originally used as WWII soldiers trudged their way into their POW camp. David Lean’s epic has a bit of stuffiness to it: It’s a big prestige picture that won a lot of Oscars. But there’s no denying that when that bridge finally goes kaboom, we’ve seen one of cinema’s greatest action scenes. There is no clear distinction between heroism and villainy; Lean uses the massive CinemaScope canvas to keep us at an emotional remove from the characters so they seem like checkerboard pieces moving toward a fixed, destructive point.\n\nDirector:Zhang Yimou\n\nCast:Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung\n\nBest quote:“Today you will learn the essence of your culture.”\n\nThe killer scene: Jet and Tony walk on water in an aerial duel over a picturesque lake.\n\nThe official version\n\nAfter Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (see No. 36), it was only a matter of time before a Chinese filmmaker made it his mission to top Taiwanese-born Ang Lee’s martial-arts game changer. The surprise was not so much that Zhang Yimou applied his visual bravura to a movie of beguiling extravagance, but that he did so in service of a Qin-dynasty saga that played like a metaphorical endorsement of centralized political authority. Marquee names Jet Li and Donnie Yen promise fist-pummeling action, yet Zhang’s refined sensibility instead offers a dance-influenced take on combat that is all flowing robes, swathes of primary color and essentially choreographic displays of menace. Hero is utterly entrancing, if clearly the product of extensive digital postproduction, and though the overlapping perspectives of rival assassins maneuvering against an all-powerful monarch precludes any genuine emotional through line, the film certainly delivers an eye-popping showcase for China’s exquisite traditional crafts and majestic landscapes.—Trevor Johnston\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector:Stanley Tong\n\nCast:Jackie Chan, Michelle Yeoh, Maggie Cheung\n\nBest quote:“Supercops in Hong Kong are cheap and plentiful, like commodities in supermarkets.”\n\nThe killer scene: That’s actually Jackie himself, swinging from a helicopter’s rope ladder high above the skyline of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nStuff it, Superman\n\nBuster Keaton and Harold Lloyd both tempted fate with insane stunts, but Jackie Chan eclipsed them both—this film is the peak example of an entertainer defying safety for the public’s enjoyment. (Not for nothing has Quentin Tarantino called Supercop’s acts of daredevilry “the greatest stunts ever filmed in any movie, ever.”) The generic plot is just there to get things in motion: a fearless cop, a drug lord, a hapless girlfriend, a much-tougher female sidekick. But once the chase sequences kick in, there’s no going back to what passes for action in Hollywood; this is a movie that raises the stakes to an impossible standard. Chan scrambles up walls, stumbles down hillsides and flings himself onto a helicopter’s trailing rope ladder for the ride of his life. Just as impressively, Michelle Yeoh does a running leap onto a motorbike and burns her way through traffic in hot pursuit, eventually racing alongside a train and Evel Knieveling on top. Staggering stuff.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nDirector:Michael Bay\n\nCast:Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris\n\nBest quote:“Losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.”\n\nThe killer scene: The San Francisco car chase, in which Cage comes off all Steve McQueen and narrowly avoids getting flattened by a rampaging tram\n\nFrisky in Frisco\n\nCome the mid-’90s—after more than a decade of muscular, monosyllabic, machine-gun–toting hard men—the world was ready for a new kind of action star: not a regular Joe, exactly, but at least a guy who could walk and chew gum at the same time. Enter Nicolas Cage, whose off-kilter energy had made him the darling of the indie scene, but whose real ambition was to be a serious big-time player like his lifelong heroes, Elvis Presley and Superman. His character in The Rock isn’t exactly a wild man—in fact, Cage largely plays the straight arrow to Sean Connery’s old-time criminal, himself the only man to ever break out"
