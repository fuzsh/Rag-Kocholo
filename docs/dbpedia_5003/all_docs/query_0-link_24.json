        "text": "Law? or Film? Architecture? or Film? Medicine or Film?\n\nWhat's more fun? Yes, Film, when she's not a cruel mistress spurning your every attempt to get that next directing gig. There is never a day when I'm directing that I regret my choice to embrace Film. I love Directing, even on a super low budget project, even when an actor is being ridiculously narcissistic , even when it is too cold or too hot or too much to stuff in the too-small schedule. OK, maybe when the catering sucks, I don't love that. And maybe when the script is just SO bad that you can't fake your way out of a turd of a scene, but still, I try, selling the whole effort to my skeptical cast while we dazzle with a clever bit of staging or camera or a bit of contrived backstory for that character so that it just, dear god, makes sense. Because directing is managing time, talent, and personalities while keeping your eye on the possibilities of the moment and not forgetting what you wanted to say in the first place; in that ideal moment when the image first appeared in your private headspace and now, now, if you can just get that exquisite truth in the actor's eyes, you can share it with the world."
