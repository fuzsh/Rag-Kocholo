        "text": "If you were to argue that romance and basketball make strange bedfellows on-screen, you would be very right when it comes to Tall Story (1960) and very wrong in the case of Love and Basketball (2000). Jane Fonda made her motion picture debut opposite Anthony Perkins in the romantic comedy Tall Story, about a tall young woman who matriculates to basketball power Custer College in search of a hoopster husband. Even though acclaimed film and stage director Joshua Logan produced Tall Story, it comes up short again and again. On the other hand, Love and Basketball, written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, is as smart and believable as Tall Story is dumb and contrived. Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan play well-heeled L.A. neighbors who grow up together, become basketball stars, and eventually realize that they were meant for each other. The on-court action is convincing; the characters are complex; and the central relationship is touching.\n\nRomantic relationships are also central to One on One (1977) and Promised Land (1987), but these movies are on this list together because both are about big-fish, small-town hardwood heroes who flounder in the world of big-time college basketball. After his hoop dream comes up empty, Davey Hancock (Jason Gedrick) becomes a policeman in his Utah hometown in the overly earnest but engaging Promised Land (which also features an impossibly young Meg Ryan and Kiefer Sutherland). Robby Benson (yeah, him) is surprisingly good—in a whiny, “aw shucks” kind of way—in One on One, as a former high-school phenom whose college coach (played with hiss-worthy despicableness by G.D. Spradlin) wants to take his scholarship away when he doesn’t meet expectations. Benson (who cowrote the screenplay) is likable and lithe as the chastened cager who has to dig deep within himself to find the strength to stand up to his abusive coach; Annette O’Toole is his grad student tutor-cum-love interest.\n\nThe on- and off-court triumphs and tragedies of real-life basketball players have been at the center of several films. Maurie (1973) focuses on the ever-deepening friendship during the 1950s and ’60s between a pair of Cincinnati Royals teammates and future Hall of Famers, Maurice Stokes (played by pro football player and blaxploitation star Bernie Casey), a gentle giant who was the prototype of the modern power forward, and Jack Twyman (Bo Svenson), his white teammate who devotes himself to his friend after Stokes is paralyzed by an on-court head injury. The friendship between Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble, a pair of inner-city Philadelphia running mates who took their talents to the West Coast and flourished at Loyola Marymount University, is the linchpin of Final Shot: The Hank Gathers Story (1992). This time, tragedy comes suddenly when the immensely gifted Gathers drops dead during a game as a result of a heart ailment. Maudlin and soap operaish, neither film is anywhere as near as compelling as Rebound: The Legend of Earl “the Goat” Manigault, in which Don Cheadle plays the title character. Widely regarded as one of the greatest school-yard players in New York City basketball history, Manigault butted heads with his college coach, left school, and was swallowed for years by a heroin addiction. His descent into addiction and his recovery are movingly portrayed.\n\nThere is no shortage of films in which real-life basketball players try their hands at acting with widely varying degrees of success. Julius (“Dr. J”) Erving heads an all-star cast (including Jonathan Winters, Stockard Channing, Harlem Globetrotter Meadowlark Lemon, and Airplane! costar and sometime basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh (1979), an “astrological-disco-sports” extravaganza about a woeful pro basketball team that fills its roster with players who share a zodiac sign, Pisces. In Fast Break (1979), Hall of Famer Bernard King plays one of the “Noo Yawk” street ballers whom a delicatessen clerk turned coach (comedian Gabe Kaplan) takes with him to Nevada to put Cadwallader College on the map. Neither film is particularly memorable. Not so the Mike Newell-directed Amazing Grace and Chuck (1987), which features NBA scoring machine Alex English as a basketball star who follows the lead of a Little League pitcher in refusing to play again until nuclear proliferation is halted. Onetime UCLA star Keith (later Jamaal) Wilkes made a short journey from hoops to Hollywood to play a much-recruited high-school player who is fatally shot by the police in the uneven but arresting and prescient Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975). Blue Chips (1994), which depicts the pressure to win at any cost in big-time college basketball, stars Nick Nolte as the coach who bends the rules to outrecruit real-life college coaching legends Bobbv Knight, Rick Pitino, and Jim Boeheim to land schoolboy superstars played by Shaquille O’Neal and Anfernee (“Penny”) Hardaway. Roundball great Bob Cousy plays an athletic director.\n\nFeaturing an impressive acting turn by NBA all-star sharpshooter Ray Allen, He Got Game (1998) takes us for a sometimes nauseating ride on the merry-go-round of big-time basketball recruiting. It is in a class by itself, however, in its moving depiction of a complex father-son relationship and its profound understanding of basketball’s place in American culture and especially in African American culture. Spike Lee, a ubiquitous courtside presence at New York Knicks games, wrote and directed this visually stunning story of the courting of the country’s number one basketball prospect (Allen), whose estranged father and basketball mentor (Denzel Washington) is temporarily released from prison to try to persuade his son to attend the governor’s alma mater. The scenes between Allen and Washington are poignant; John Turturro’s hyperslick coach is unforgettable; the opening basketball-across-America sequence is poetic; and the scene in which Washington explains why he has named his son Jesus—in honor of the whirling-dervish wizardry of Earl (“the Pearl”) Monroe—speaks volumes on the aesthetic and aspirational aspects of basketball.\n\nMore than a few filmmakers have hit the hardwood in search of laughs only to emerge floor-burned and forsaken by the critics and the box office. From dumb to dumber, the comedy bricks heaved up by Hollywood include Celtic Pride (1996), written by the usually reliable Judd Apatow and starring Dan Aykroyd and Daniel Stern as obsessive Boston fans who kidnap the star player of the Utah Jazz (Damon Wayans) to ensure a Celtics victory in game 7 of the championship; Sixth Man (1997), about a University of Washington player (Kadeem Hardison) who dies but returns as a ghost to help his brother and the rest of the Huskies advance through the NCAA tournament, bringing new meaning to March Madness; and Semi-Pro (2008), starring Will Ferrell as a flamboyant player-owner trying to save his franchise in the waning days of the American Basketball Association. Semi-Pro squanders Ferrell’s talent and that of Woody Harrelson, who fares much better in White Men Can’t Jump (1992), an exception to the Basketball Movies Can’t Be Funny rule. Written and directed by Ron Shelton (who went yard with the baseball movie Bull Durham [1988]), this engagingly sweet story of ambition, necessity, and loyalty makes the most of the chemistry between Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, who plays his partner in two-on-two basketball hustling, and Rosie Perez as Harrelson’s girlfriend who studies an almanac in pursuit of appearing on Jeopardy!\n\nSome of the best basketball movies are based on the struggles and accomplishments of real-life basketball teams, presented with varying degrees of historical accuracy and literary license. In Coach Carter (2005), Samuel L. Jackson portrays the coach of a Richmond, California, high-school team in 1999 whose pursuit of academic achievement over success on the court led him to literally lock his players out of the gym and to require them to sign an agreement pledging to maintain a 2.3 grade point average. Although Glory Road (2006) skirts the advances made by African American players in college basketball before 1966, it tells the inspirational story of the Texas Western University (now the University of Texas at El Paso) squad that was the first team to win the NCAA national championship with five black starters, besting Adolph Rupp’s all-white powerhouse University of Kentucky and triumphing over prejudice and bigotry. Both movies manipulate details in the service of drama. Hoosiers (1986) plays even faster and looser with history, though it doesn’t claim to be telling a true story, even if its sentimental, often-exhilarating tale of the David versus Goliath success of a small-town Indiana high-school team mirrors the “Milan Miracle,” in which the team from a tiny Indiana high school (164 students) won the single-division championship in 1954.\n\nWhen it comes to basketball movies, there is also something to be said for not keeping it real at all. Usually basketball-related flights of fancy hinge on fancy flight, to wit the aboveground acrobatics of Air Jordan, Air Bud, and Air (Teen) Wolf. In Space Jam (1996) the world’s greatest basketball player Michael Jordan (or perhaps second greatest—we hear you, LeBron fans) not only literally plays basketball with animated Looney Tunes cartoon characters, including Bugs Bunny, but figuratively becomes a highly entertaining cartoon character himself in the same way that the Beatles were figuratively cartoon characters in Help! long before they were literal cartoon characters in Yellow Submarine. Inhabiting a similar cartoon reality to comic effect for family fun is Air Bud (1997), the first installment in the series of films about a jack-of-all-trades golden retriever, Buddy, who demonstrates his basketball prowess on his new owner’s kids team (the film’s canine star first won fame shooting baskets as a “stupid pet trick” on Late Night with David Letterman). To perform his high-flying heroics for his high-school team in Teen Wolf (1985), the character portrayed by Michael J. Fox first has to undergo transformation into a werewolf.\n\nSome of the very best basketball movies are not really about basketball at all. In some of them, basketball is ancillary to the real story; in others, basketball appears only briefly but tellingly. In Finding Forrester (2000), Sean Connery plays a reclusive J.D. Salinger-like writer who becomes a literary mentor to an African American teenager whose basketball skills have earned him a spot in a swanky prep school, where his integrity is questioned when he demonstrates his virtuoso abilities as a writer. Four ex-teammates (Bruce Dern, Stacy Keach, Paul Sorvino, and Martin Sheen) gather with their former coach (Robert Mitchum) for a reunion 25 years after they won a state basketball championship in That Championship Season (1982). Before the evening is over, old wounds have been opened and flown into the bitterness and disappointments of the men’s current lives. Although basketball is on the margins of The Great Santini (1979), the father-versus-son game of one-on-one between Marine Lieut. Col. “Bull” Meechum (Robert Duvall), a warrior without a war and a domineering father, and his son Ben (Michael O‘Keefe) is every bit as powerful and central to plot in this film as the climactic father-son contest is in He Got Game. Both games are rites of passage that tell us as much about the fathers as they do about the sons. Only by practicing late at night in the driving rain beneath the window of Ben’s room can Bull acknowledge that his son has surpassed him."
