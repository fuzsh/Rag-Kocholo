        "text": "Lights, Camera, Action…Westchester!\n\nEver get that “Haven’t I been here before?” feeling when traveling?\n\nIn Westchester, there’s a good reason the scenery looks familiar — you’ve been seeing our County for years as the setting for countless TV series and movies.\n\nSome of the hottest shows on TV have been filmed in Westchester, including The Americans, Billions, The Blacklist, City on a Hill, The Crowded Room, Gilded Age, The Flight Attendant, Law & Order: SVU, and Succession.\n\nProximity to New York City, convenient sound stages in Yonkers, and every possible backdrop — from a 19th-century Gothic Revival mansion to famed Sing Sing Prison — make Westchester a popular pick for film crews.\n\nWe have idyllic towns — see The Good Wife. We have artsy downtowns — check out HBO’s Divorce. We have scenic countryside views — filmed by the Coen brothers in Inside Llewyn Davis. And we have one-of-a-kind spots like Rye’s Art Deco Playland amusement park — remember the grant-a-wish scene in Tom Hanks’ Big?\n\nYou’ll see Westchester in films like The Intern with Robert Di Niro, The Post, starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, and Martin Scorcese’s The Irishman. Mount Vernon alone has starred in Riding In Cars With Boys, The Thomas Crown Affair and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\n\nCheck out Westchester's filmography below:\n\n2024\n\nFBI: Most Wanted: Townhouse Diner, White Plains\n\n2023\n\nDaredevil: Born Again: Yonkers\n\nFeud: Capote vs. The Swans: C.V.
