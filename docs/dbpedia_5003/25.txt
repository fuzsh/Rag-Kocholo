I FIRST SAW THE FILM “THE WARRIORS” IN SPRING OF 1979.

it was at the long since torn down brick 1 screen theater house in Alhambra (on Main & Atlantic) where I first saw this film and have been hooked into it ever since. Long before the film gained its cult status and while the press and news media were attributing theater style gang fights during its release, I enjoyed the action, the rumbles, the costumes, the drama, the chases, the humor and the New York City backdrop to what has been one of my favorite films ever since.

Fast forward 30+ years and thanks to the magic of Hollywood style Autograph Conventions, I have been able to meet a bit of the cast that continue to attend conclaves of all sorts and greet their army of fans that continue to support and enjoy this film. For almost 40 years the question is still asked:

“CAN YOU DIG IT?”

MY VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THE HOLLYWOOD SHOW

and its proprietor David Elkouby for bringing together over the last decade so many of the cast members from this amazing film. A tremendous special Thank You to these celebrities for bringing themselves to their fans and to conclaves and conventions whereas these autographs and photos can be so happily shared and enjoyed in years to come.
