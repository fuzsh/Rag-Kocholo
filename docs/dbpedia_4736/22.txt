Blue Ridge Christian School has a long history of excellence in athletics. Christian athletics means more than just a "Christian involved in athletics". We emphasize Christ-like living through athletics. We encourage & train character over competition.

The ultimate goal is not to win at all costs or that losing is a tragedy! Key aspects of our athletic program involve training students to display the attitudes and actions of our Lord Jesus Christ (Philippians 2:5, Romans 8:39).

High school students may participate in junior varsity and varsity athletics. For boys, sports include soccer, basketball, baseball, and golf. Girls participate in cheerleading, volleyball, basketball, golf, and soccer. Practices are held outside the school day. Games include competition against other Christian and private schools in the greater Kansas City area as well as in locations around the state.

The school is a member of the Metro Christian Athletic Association (MCAA) conference and the Missouri Christian School Athletic Association (MCSAA), competing against other Christian schools in Missouri.

At the middle school level, boys may participate in soccer, basketball, golf, and baseball. Girls may participate in cheerleading, volleyball, basketball, golf, and soccer. Depending on the level of interest, there may not be enough students to field a dedicated middle school team. We encourage participation as it prepares our students to learn to win and lose gracefully. Our coaches are focused on character over competition.
