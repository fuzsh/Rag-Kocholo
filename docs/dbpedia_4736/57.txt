Welcome to Shalom Christian Academy athletics! We hope that your time on our website is beneficial to your understanding more about our athletic department. Shalom is a member of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA), with our varsity teams competing as an independent school within the PIAA. Our middle school teams (6th-8th grade) participate in the MDCC.

We want you to see that our goals and vision go beyond that of just competition and trophies. The purpose of our athletic department is to offer our student athletes an opportunity to excel in each of our sports at the highest level possible, while giving them the opportunity to learn and display Godly character in each situation.Being an athlete at Shalom is a privilege, and the Lord has blessed us with opportunities to honor Him with our abilities, talents, and actions both on and off the field of competition.

We also have a tradition of excellence here at Shalom where we continue to focus on building young men and women not only athletically, but academically and spiritually. We hope that you see an athletic program that has gained the respect of the surrounding schools and communities, but more importantly, we hope you see a program that strives to glorify and honor our Lord Jesus Christ in everything we do.

“Whatsoever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not unto men.” – Colossians 3:23
