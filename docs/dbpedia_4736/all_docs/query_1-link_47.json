Like the VMI series, ETSU also came away with a series sweep over the Bears in 2023-24.\n\nETSU gets a look at the last two conference champions as the Bucs head to Greenville, S.C. for a showdown at Furman on Jan. 15, while a rematch of last year's title game with Samford is set for Saturday, Jan. 18 in Birmingham.\n\nFurman makes the return trip to Freedom Hall on Saturday, Feb. 1, while Samford comes to town the following Saturday (Feb. 8).\n\nBoth games of the in-state rivalry with Chattanooga will be played on Saturday this season. Part I will take place in Freedom Hall on Jan. 25, while Part II in Chattanooga will be played on Feb. 15.\n\nThe Bucs' remaining home conference games feature Western Carolina (Jan. 22), UNCG (Feb. 19) and the home finale will be against Mercer on Wednesday, Feb. 26.\n\nETSU's other road games send the Bucs to Greensboro (Jan. 29), VMI (Feb. 5), Western Carolina (Feb. 12), Wofford (Feb. 22) and the regular season finale will be played in Charleston, S.C. against The Citadel on Saturday, March 1.\n\nThe Southern Conference Tournament will again be played inside Harrah's Cherokee Center Ashville from March 7-10.
