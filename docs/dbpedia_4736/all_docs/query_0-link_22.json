        "text": "Somewhere in my head is reserved a sacred space for not just my favourite high school teams of all time, but the ones with the best nicknames.\n\nIn what started out as an early-pandemic project last March before going into a very extended hibernation, has today, a year later, emerged as something of a finished product.\n\nWith the help of longtime friend and high school sports enthusiast Wilson Wong, I am somewhat confident in saying that we’ve produced a near-complete list of every high school in B.C. which fields a senior varsity (Grade 11-12) sports team. Middle schools have not been counted.\n\nYet I say “somewhat confident” because I know we have not gotten every one. Still, our list features some 314 schools.\n\nMy efforts over the spring break have been stymied by the fact that schools have been closed for two weeks, and thus we have a small list of schools that have been left off as incomplete because we either could not verify their nickname or the status of their sports program.\n\nNonetheless, I wasn’t going to wait another week!\n\nThis is a project I have wanted to complete for at least 20 years, and I am presently winding down Year 38 of my career at present.\n\nI figured if I didn’t get it out there soon, I might never get around to it.\n\n(If I have missed a nickname, either obscure or obvious, be kind and let me know with an email at howardtsumura@gmail.com)\n\nAs well, there are two other nickname-related stories available today. For the inside story on a B.C. high school with one of the most enduring nicknames click here. For a comical look at fantasy high school invitational tournaments based solely on nicknames and school names, click here.\n\nAlas, it’s a mass of schools and their names. But to me, and I hope to so many of you, the loyal reader, it’s actually so much more.\n\nGleaning through the nicknames these past few days, I am immediately taken on trip down memory lane.\n\nEven when I wasn’t a sportswriter, which I have been since the age of 19 (North Delta Huskies Class of 1981 grad), I just somehow knew school nicknames. The Gladstone Gladiators. The Eric Hamber Griffins. The Notre Dame Jugglers. The Steveston Packers.\n\nThat last one?\n\nI come from a family of boat builders and fishermen, and when I head down to Steveston, and see some of the fibreglass gillnetters my dad and his brothers built still moored along the docks next to the old fish-packing plant, I just say to myself: “Calling Steveston Secondary’s teams the Packers was as close to perfection as there was.”\n\nOf course if you are a seasoned high school sports person, you understand that communities evolve, and as change comes, schools can close or merge, leaving new identities in their wake.\n\nPresently, after merging with London Secondary, they are now known as the Steveston-London Sharks.\n\nAs times change we obviously need to adapt with complete inclusivity, respect and sensitivity to all, and thus more change has followed.\n\nOver two years ago, Quesnel’s Correlieu Secondary decided to drop its longtime moniker of Clan in favour of Coyotes.\n\nTeams from Castlegar’s Stanley Humphries Secondary, long known as the Rockers and Rockettes, are these days also known as the Coyotes.\n\nEarlier this month, Pleasant Valley Secondary in Armstrong announced its boys teams would no longer be known as Saints, and its girls teams as Sinners, as had been the case for at least the last 40 years.\n\nYet sometimes nicknames are a home run from the second they are adopted.\n\nCase in point, Terrace’s Caledonia Secondary calls its teams the Kermdoes (these days often referred to Spirit Bears).\n\nNot only is the fair-furred cousin of the black bear native to the Terrace region, they are also B.C.’s official provincial mammal.\n\nI pine for the return of the Cumberland Toppers (1957 B.C. boys basketball finalists) and West Vancouver’s Hillside Highwaymen, as much for their monikers as anything else. They just sound so good\n\nI praise the fine folks in my late dad’s hometown of Prince Rupert for finding a way to keep the Rainmakers nickname alive at Charles Hays Secondary.\n\nAnd I love turning great, long-lost nicknames into trivia questions, like this one: Which team lost to my alma mater, the North Delta Huskies, in the 1985 B.C. senior boys soccer championships, which in fact, were played at B.C. Place Stadium?\n\nYes, none other than Burnaby’s Alpha Aardvarks (now Eagles).\n\nAnd to close?\n\nHow about going back to the fall of 1983 where as a 19-year-old Kwantlen College journalism grad, I suddenly found myself a long ways from home in Houston, B.C., pretty sure even then that writing about high school sports like basketball was going to be the passion of my professional life.\n\nI showed up at practice one day at Houston Secondary and met the new head coach, a guy named Bill Barrie. The first question I asked him: What’s the name of the team?\n\n“The guys took a vote, and we decided we are going to be the Wolverines,” said Barrie, who a handful of years later had moved south and led the Agassiz Chieftains to the 1988 B.C. Double-A title.\n\nThe Wolverines nickname has held a special place in my heart ever since, even when I discovered many years later that Houston Secondary had actually had a name which I have to say was even better.\n\nFor a team from the up-country that toils in relative obscurity on its way to a coveted B.C. tournament berth, what better name than the Houston Shadows?\n\nRemember, if we’ve missed someone obvious, or you know of a more obscure school that indeed offers at least one senior varsity sport, give us both school and nickname. Once we confirm, we’re happy to add it to the list.\n\nNicknames. I love ‘em.\n\nHere’s our list!\n\nAAAAAAAAAA (13)\n\nA.L. Fortune Falcons (Enderby)\n\nA.R.
