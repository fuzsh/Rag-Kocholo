        "text": "A truly wonderful school! It is a great atmosphere. The teachers here genuinely care about each and every student. They care about our academics, but also our walk with God. It is a small school, but this makes it so easy to make friends because everyone knows everyone else in the school. I have been attending this school since the first grade. This is my senior year. I was always asked by my parents if I wanted to switch schools. But I always told them no, because I did not want to leave this school. This school, these teachers, and these friends have made an impact on my life, that would not have happened at any other school. Love this place."
