        "text": "Homework is done, football practice is over—so now what? At Blue Ridge School, there’s always a fun answer to that question. Like fly fishing. Ultimate Frisbee. Video gaming. Poetry slams. Cooking. Whatever the boys’ interests, they can build a club around it and chances are good a Blue Ridge faculty member will join in, too. From music and broadcasting to robotics, mountain biking, volunteerism, and art, there are kindred spirits on campus eager to create a community around it.\n\nWhile the clubs are informal, we also plan formal weekend activities that take boys away from campus where they can mingle with other boys and, perhaps more importantly, girls! Here are some of the places Blue Ridge School boys are likely to be seen socializing in supervised environments on the weekends:\n\nShort Pump and Tyson’s Corner mall trips\n\nTrips to Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall\n\nD.C. trips for cultural and historic enrichment\n\nMixers with girls’ schools, such as Madeira and Foxcroft\n\nWeekly trips to the movies\n\nSkiing at Massanutten and Wintergreen\n\nHiking in the Shenandoah National Park\n\nFishing, canoeing, and camping trips\n\nUniversity of Virginia athletics and events\n\nSome examples of Blue Ridge School clubs and organizations:"
