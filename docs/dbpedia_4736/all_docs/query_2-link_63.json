        "text": "COLLEGE\n\nSPORTSTENNESSEE VOLS\n\nTennessee's McCoy Named to Wuerffel Trophy Watch List\n\nATLANTA â Tennessee wide receiver Bru McCoy was named to the 2024 Allstate Wuerffel Trophy Watch List, as announced by the Wuerffel Foundation on Thursday.\n\nThe Wuerffel Trophy is college football's premier award for community service and one of the most meaningful awards in collegiate sports.\n\nThe award is named after Danny Wuerffel, the 1996 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback from the University of Florida who parlayed his success on the football field into a lifetime of service. The trophy embodies Wuerffel's commitment to being a humanitarian while honoring student-athletes who are inspired to serve others and make positive impacts on society.\n\nMcCoy, who enters his third season at UT, has made it a main focus of his to make a positive impact within the Knoxville community and beyond, primarily through his \"Huddle for Hearts\" initiative.\n\nIn partnership with the Peyton Walker Foundation, McCoy developed \"Huddle for Hearts\" to help provide youth athletic organizations with AEDs (automated external defibrillator), a medical device designed to save those experiencing sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n\"Huddle for Hearts\" is aiming to not only spread awareness about the dangers and prevalence of sudden cardiac arrest, but to alert people on prevention and treatment. In partnership with the Peyton Walker Foundation, McCoy is working to raise money to provide communities with AEDs while increasing understanding and awareness about sudden cardiac arrest in sports.\n\nMcCoy's vision goes beyond Knoxville, as he is working towards involving athletes from schools across the country to take part in this initiative to help spread awareness and make AEDs accessible to underserved communities nationwide.\n\nThe Wuerffel Foundation recently partnered with Allstate to unify college football's highest community service honors. Eleven of the watch list nominees will be named to the Allstate AFCA Good Works Team and will be Allstate Wuerffel Trophy semifinalists.\n\nThe 2024 Allstate Wuerffel Trophy finalists and recipient will be selected by a national voting committee, including a fan vote component, and announced on ESPN's Home Depot College Football Awards Show on Dec. 12. The Allstate Wuerffel Trophy Presentation Gala will take place Feb. 1, 2025, at the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta."
