He rushed for 20 touchdowns and threw for 12. He completed 133 of 225 pass attempts (59.1 percent). He had 105 tackles (five for loss) and had two interceptions and seven pass deflections as a cornerback. Lopez is also a budding baseball prospect as an outfielder who helped lead the Pumas to the 2A state championship in the spring.\n\nTombstone senior quarterback/safety DJ Elias\n\nVery similar to Lopez, Elias is a dual-threat quarterback, a solid defender in the defensive secondary and a baseball talent at catcher. Elias completed 68 of 120 pass attempts for 1,536 yards with 18 touchdowns and only four interceptions last year. He rushed for 485 yards on 68 carries with 13 touchdowns. He also had 45 tackles with an interception.\n\nScheduling notes:\n\n— Five of the eight schools in the region will feature new coaches — Benson’s Chris Rasmussen, Bisbee’s Carlos Lopez, Catalina’s Andy Fetsis, Santa Rita’s Douglas Smith and Willcox’s Jeston Lotts. The dean of coaches is Tombstone’s Dominik Bonilla, who is only in his fourth season.\n\n— Santa Rita is tentatively returning to varsity football after having only a junior varsity program last season due to lack of participants. Although the Eagles are in the 2A San Pedro, none of their games this season factor into the region standings. The move to have all their games “freedom” games was done in case the Eagles are unable to play certain weeks due to number of players on the roster.\n\n— Rasmussen has it difficult early with Benson opening at Phoenix Shadow Mountain followed by a game at 3A power Morenci in Week 3. But Benson has only four road games scheduled and it has four straight home games against Palo Verde, Santa Rita, Catalina and Willcox scheduled from Oct. 4 to Oct. 25.\n\n— Two of Bisbee’s freedom games are at home at historic Warren Ballpark against good opponents — longtime rival Douglas and Santa Cruz Valley. Bisbee is slated to make three trips to Tucson with games scheduled at Catalina, Palo Verde and Santa Rita.\n\n— Catalina’s three freedom opponents — Highland Prep, NFL Yet and ALA-Anthem South — were a combined 6-24 last season. Fetsis has long been a successful boys and girls tennis coach at Pusch Ridge and he served on the football staff at the school when his son Christian, a quarterback, led the Lions to the 2017 3A state championship game, finishing with a 13-1 record. Andy Fetsis was also on the staff when Pusch Ridge won the title in 2015, when Christian was a sophomore. He coached Christian and the boys tennis team to a 2018 state championship and his daughters Sofia and Estelle to state titles in tennis. Sofia and the Lions were state champs from 2017-19 and Estelle won the doubles state title last season. Fetsis became involved with the Catalina program when Greg McKinstry III coached there when Fetsis toured the school as an area representative of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Fetsis told AllSportsTucson.com that he will coach Pusch Ridge’s tennis program and Estelle (a senior) in tennis one last year in the spring of 2024-25 after leading the Trojans’ football program in the fall.\n\n— Palo Verde will play 4A school Rincon/University on the road in the second week of the season Sept. 6. Last season, the Rangers defeated the Titans 20-6 at Palo Verde.\n\n— After starting the Jeff Bollnow era on the road for the first two games last season, Tanque Verde welcomes Phoenix Christian and Glendale Prep the first two weeks this season.\n\n— Tombstone has two important games in October scheduled at home — against Tanque Verde on Oct. 4 and Bisbee on Oct. 25.\n\n— Willcox starts the Lotts era on the road at Arizona Lutheran, but then the Cowboys play three of the next four games at home sandwiched around a trip to Santa Rita. Lotts coached Parker to the 2A semifinals in 2021 and the quarterfinals in 2019 before joining Eric Hjalmarson’s staff at Willcox in 2022 and was on the staff there the last two seasons. Hjalmarson is now at his alma mater Blue Ridge. Lotts, a counselor at Willcox, was 61-40 in his 10 years at Parker.\n\n2A SAN PEDRO SCHEDULES\n\nBENSON\n\nHead coach: Chris Rasmussen (first year at Benson and overall)\n\nBobcats compete in the 2A San Pedro. *Region game.
