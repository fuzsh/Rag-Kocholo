If you loved camp, if your children love camp, if you see the value in providing a space for others to rest, play, and grow in relationship with each other and Jesus, then we believe BRCC is a good non-profit for you to partner with. Have you considered monthly giving?\n\nOur current monthly donors are helping make things happen here. We are seeing the fruit from their generosity and we also see the potential for greater things. Our dining hall was overflowing this summer with teenagers. It was amazing but also eye opening. We want to ensure that if a teen wants to be here, there is room at our table. 425 campers played and splashed in our 50 plus year old pool this summer. The time to replace it is coming soon. Our fall retreat season has us considering space for additional groups to gather."
