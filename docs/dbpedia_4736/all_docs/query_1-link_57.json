        "text": "Superintendent Dr. Chris Ballenger of Warren County Public Schools has shared several updates and important information as the new school year approaches. With school set to start on August 13th, there are many new initiatives and reminders to ensure a smooth and successful year for students, parents, and staff.\n\nOpen House and Community Fun Day Adjustments\n\nOriginally scheduled for Thursday night, the Open House event for all schools has been postponed to Monday, August 12th, due to a tropical depression. Dr. Ballenger emphasized the importance of starting the school year safely, recalling last year’s tornado warning during Open House. The new date will still allow families to meet teachers and ease any first-day jitters despite the quick turnaround for staff preparing for the first day of school.\n\nDespite the weather concerns, the Community Day event is still set to take place on Saturday at Warren County High School from 10 AM to 2 PM. The event will feature various vendors, activities, and a dunk tank, promising a fun day for families to kick off the school year together.\n\nSafety on the Roads\n\nWith school buses back on the roads starting Tuesday, Dr. Ballenger reminded the community to be vigilant about bus safety. When the stop arm is out, vehicles must stop in both directions to ensure the safety of students crossing the street. The importance of this cannot be overstated, as it helps protect the community’s youngest members on their way to and from school.\n\nIn addition to bus safety, school zones will be active again. Drivers should be mindful of flashing lights and reduced speed limits to protect students walking or biking to school. Dr. Ballenger highlighted the presence of cameras in some school zones, which have effectively reduced speeding and enhanced safety.\n\nNew Policies and Initiatives\n\nThis school year brings several new policies and initiatives aimed at improving education and safety. The Virginia Literacy Act (VLA) will be implemented to enhance literacy across elementary schools. Additionally, changes to the standards in math and English will be introduced, aligning with the state’s new requirements. These changes are expected to initially challenge students and teachers but are essential for long-term academic improvement.\n\nThe school board has also addressed cell phone use in schools. Following Governor Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 33, Warren County Public Schools will enforce stricter cell phone policies during instructional time. Students will not be allowed to use cell phones during class, with specific guidelines varying by school level.\n\nAddressing Staffing Shortages\n\nDr. Ballenger acknowledged the ongoing challenge of staffing shortages, a widespread education issue. Warren County Public Schools are currently short of 10 teachers, 2 instructional assistants, 2 nurses, and 2 counselors. However, the superintendent assured that plans are in place to manage these shortages and continue providing quality education.\n\nEncouraging Community Involvement\n\nDr. Ballenger emphasized the importance of community involvement in education. He encouraged parents and community members to attend school events, support their children’s activities, and stay engaged with the schools. Events like band programs, theater performances, and sports games are vital for students, and parental presence can significantly boost their morale.\n\nLooking Forward to a Great Year\n\nDespite the challenges, Dr. Ballenger remains optimistic about the upcoming school year. He praised the school’s staff’s dedication and the community’s support, highlighting that Warren County continues to produce successful graduates who go on to prestigious colleges and careers.\n\nWarren County Public Schools is ready to embark on a new academic year with a focus on safety, academic excellence, and community involvement. Dr. Ballenger’s updates and reminders ensure that everyone is prepared for a successful start to the school year.\n\nTown Talk is a series on the Royal Examiner where we will introduce you to local entrepreneurs, businesses, non-profit leaders, and political figures who influence Warren County.

The shelter, a vital service in the community known for providing warmth and safety to the homeless during the winter months, is gearing up for its upcoming season.\n\nOne of the key fundraisers this year is a “money board,” where donors can choose numbered slots corresponding to dollar amounts; for example, selecting slot 50 costs $50. Each $50 contribution allows donors to win prizes, such as a free oil change, a $50 gift card for OnCue, or even a $500 aeration and seed service from Presidential Landscaping. This creative approach allows people to donate based on their means while contributing to a significant cause.\n\nThe shelter plans to open its doors the Saturday before Christmas, which falls on December 21st. This timing depends on successful fundraising efforts, as the shelter opened early last year due to adequate funds, which are currently lacking. Running the shelter is costly, with payroll alone reaching approximately $2,800 per week. Volunteers and donations are crucial, and the community’s support is needed more than ever.\n\nSmeltzer also highlighted upcoming events like a paint night in October and a “Coldest Night Walk” in February, a national event that HARTS will participate in for the first time. These efforts are part of a broader push to secure the necessary funds to keep the shelter operational through the winter.\n\nHARTS is making participation easy for those interested in donating or volunteering. You can pick numbers on the money board online or at local events like the Pickle Fest and the Festival of the Leaves.

Since beginning his campaign, Mitchell has traveled extensively across the vast, mostly rural district, which stretches from Winchester to Roanoke. Through these travels, he’s gained a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by the district’s residents, particularly those in agriculture and small businesses.\n\nMitchell emphasized the importance of listening to the people he hopes to represent. His conversations with farmers, small business owners, and other constituents have revealed local concerns, including the need to improve rural education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\n“Our district is huge—bigger than the state of Delaware,” Mitchell said. “I’ve been putting in the hard work, getting up and down, meeting a lot of people.” He stressed that any good candidate must listen more than they speak, a principle that has guided his interactions throughout the campaign.\n\nMitchell highlighted the need for better investment in rural areas, comparing the revitalization of cities like Detroit with the lack of similar efforts in rural communities. He pointed out that broadband access is critical for modern farming practices, education, and small business development, arguing that it’s as essential today as electricity was a century ago.\n\nMcCool noted that many candidates for federal office get caught up in national issues, often losing sight of the needs of their local constituents. Mitchell agreed, stating that his focus is on the 750,000 people of the 6th Congressional District. He detailed the district’s significant agricultural output, which includes four of Virginia’s top five agricultural counties. “You have to be engaged in the local agricultural and rural areas,” Mitchell said, noting that Rockingham County is the second-largest agricultural county on the entire Eastern Seaboard.\n\nMitchell also discussed the challenges of retaining young people in rural areas, many of whom leave for urban centers in search of better opportunities. “We’ve got to figure out a way to make sure that when we educate folks, there are job opportunities and economic opportunities that keep them here,” he said, emphasizing the importance of keeping family units intact.\n\nAs the conversation continued, Mitchell reflected on how his campaign has evolved. While he started with a broad platform, his direct interactions with voters have sharpened his focus on local issues. “Where I started this endeavor and where I’m at right now, I’ve got a much broader perspective of the issues and concerns that people have,” he explained.\n\nMitchell’s campaign strategy is rooted in connecting with voters from all political backgrounds. He aims to run a campaign that represents everyone in the district, not just one political party. “I’m going to keep my head down, continue to run this campaign, and run through to the finish line,” he told McCool, emphasizing his commitment to staying focused as the election approaches.\n\nThe interview concluded with McCool inviting Mitchell back for another discussion as the election draws nearer. Mitchell expressed his enthusiasm for returning, noting that his experiences on the campaign trail have deeply influenced his understanding of the district and reinforced his commitment to representing the 6th Congressional District in Washington.\n\nIn a recent Town Talk with Mike McCool, publisher of the Royal Examiner, he had the pleasure of speaking with a remarkable young man, Milo Medina, and his proud mother, Celia. At just 14, Milo has already become somewhat of a local celebrity, capturing the hearts and minds of our community with his dedication to the Young Marines program.\n\nMilo’s journey into the Young Marines began through family tradition. His father, a Marine Corps veteran, introduced him to the program after being impressed by the discipline and manners of young Marines he met while volunteering. Milo joined the program at the tender age of eight and has since risen to the rank of sergeant, becoming the platoon sergeant of his unit.\n\n“My dad was very impressed with how well-mannered and respectful they were,” Milo explained. “He thought, ‘I want my kids to be in that program when they get old enough.’ So, when I was eight, I joined.”\n\nMilo’s role in the Young Marines involves more than just drills and discipline. He’s a leader and a mentor, tasked with lesson planning and educating his peers on important issues like drug demand reduction. This initiative aims to inform youth about the dangers of drugs, a cornerstone of the Young Marines’ mission.\n\n“The main part of the Young Marines is youth DDR, which is drug demand reduction,” Milo said. “We try to reach all the youth in the U.S., telling them the dangers of drugs and why you shouldn’t do them.”\n\nMilo’s commitment to leadership is evident through his participation in the Young Marines’ leadership academies. He has completed the junior and senior leadership schools, earning ribbons for his achievements, and aims to attend the advanced leadership school next year. These programs teach vital skills such as decisiveness, public speaking, and effective communication.\n\n“We learned how to be better leaders, how to be decisive,” Milo shared. “It was really fun. There were a ton of kids from the East Coast area.”\n\nBalancing his commitments to the Young Marines and his education at Randolph-Macon Academy (RMA) is no small feat. Milo, who will enter the ninth grade, is already making his mark academically and socially. His experiences in the Young Marines have bolstered his confidence and public speaking skills, which he uses in school.\n\n“I used to be petrified of speaking to adults and stuff,” Milo admitted. “But now, what I’m doing right now, I would not have wanted to do this before. The Young Marines taught me a lot about that.”\n\nMilo’s mother, Celia, is immensely proud of his achievements. She credits the Young Marines program with instilling in him a sense of perseverance and discipline.\n\n“He puts so much work and drive into everything he does,” Celia said. “The Young Marines program really helped him with that and taught him how to keep pushing and researching how to get better.”\n\nMilo’s ambitions extend beyond the Young Marines. He dreams of attending the Naval Academy to study engineering and business, with the ultimate goal of becoming an officer in the Marine Corps and starting a hydroponics business.\n\n“Naval Academy is my big dream,” Milo revealed. “I want to do my years of service while also learning and taking college. I want to own a hydroponics business. We’re building a greenhouse at my house right now.”\n\nMilo’s dedication to the Young Marines has inspired his younger sister, who, at ten years old, is also part of the program and holds the rank of Lance Corporal. The Medina family embodies the spirit of service, community, and continuous improvement.\n\n“It’s a competition right now,” Milo joked. “I’m going to see who gets higher first.”\n\nCelia is also deeply involved, supporting her children and the broader community of young Marines. She emphasizes the importance of the program’s communal support and the life lessons it imparts.\n\n“We treat all the kids as if they were our own,” Celia explained. “It’s about being a community and being there for all the youth.”\n\nMilo’s journey with the Young Marines is far from over. Milo’s future is bright, with plans to reach higher ranks and his eyes set on the Naval Academy. His story is a testament to the power of perseverance, discipline, and community support. The Young Marines program has shaped him into a leader and prepared him for a lifetime of success and service.\n\nAs the Town Talk concluded, Milo gives us a glimpse of his philosophy: “It’s always about perseverance, trying to improve yourself, not just as a young Marine but as a person.”\n\nWe look forward to following Milo’s journey and celebrating his future successes. His story inspires all young people striving to make a difference in their communities and beyond.\n\nClick her to find out more about the Young Marines program.\n\nAbout the Young Marines\n\nThe Young Marines is a national non-profit 501(c)(3) youth education and service program open to boys and girls from age eight through high school graduation. This program is dedicated to promoting its members’ mental, moral, and physical development. It emphasizes leadership, teamwork, and self-discipline, encouraging members to live and advocate for a healthy, drug-free lifestyle.\n\nAmerican youth are taught the importance of self-confidence, academic achievement, honoring veterans, good citizenship, and community service through the Young Marines. By focusing on character building and leadership, the program prepares its members to become productive members of society.\n\nIn 1959, in Waterbury, Connecticut, a group of former Marines founded an organization for boys that mirrored the values of the Marine Corps. Their vision of offering leadership training and essential life skills laid the foundation for what would become the Young Marines. Today, the program has expanded to include over 236 units nationwide and is highly respected. Despite its growth, the focus remains the same: to strengthen the lives of America’s youth by teaching self-confidence, academic achievement, honoring veterans, good citizenship, community service, and living a healthy, drug-free lifestyle. The core values of leadership, teamwork, and discipline are deeply ingrained and practiced by all members.\n\nTown Talk is a series on the Royal Examiner where we will introduce you to local entrepreneurs, businesses, non-profit leaders, and political figures who influence Warren County.

Eshelman, who has been actively engaging with the community, shared insights on critical issues like the town’s water supply and his vision for its future.\n\nEshelman emphasized the importance of addressing the persistent water shortage in the town. “We need a secondary water source, and we should be talking about it,” he said. Despite acknowledging that solutions can’t be implemented overnight, Eshelman criticized the current administration for not taking sufficient action. He recalled a suggestion for a water committee made in a liaison meeting last October, which was well-received but never acted upon.\n\nEshelman pointed out that no concrete actions have been taken while discussions about water have occurred. He expressed frustration over the lost time, noting, “We’ve lost a whole year. We can’t recapture that, but I tend to think that if we had some forward-thinking vision, this is something we could have been working on already.” He suggested various potential solutions, including utilizing McKay Springs, exploring quarries, creating a reservoir, and even recycling water.\n\nApart from water issues, Eshelman talked about his extensive experience in revitalizing Front Royal’s downtown area. He recounted purchasing and refurbishing several historic buildings, turning them into successful businesses. One notable project was the transformation of the old McCrory 5 and Dime store into an antique emporium, which eventually housed various businesses, contributing to the town’s economic growth.\n\nEshelman also highlighted his tenure as general manager of the Shenandoah County Fair, where he brought horse racing to the fairgrounds, providing a significant financial boost to the community. He emphasized the need to leverage such experiences to enhance tourism and local business development in Front Royal. “The Warren County Fairgrounds is a hidden gem,” he said, advocating for better utilization of local resources to attract visitors and stimulate the economy.\n\nIn terms of governance, Eshelman expressed his desire to form various committees to address pressing issues. He believes in involving community members with expertise in relevant fields. “The solutions to a lot of our problems are in our community,” he said, emphasizing the importance of local input over external consultants.\n\nEshelman’s campaign also stresses the importance of representing all citizens, not just those who vote for him. He values the independence of his candidacy, free from partisan pressures, and aims to be a mayor for all residents. “Everybody has a voice, and being an independent candidate, we’re not getting that partisan endorsement, but independent candidates are free to think on their own,” he stated.\n\nEshelman plans to continue engaging with residents, attending events, and listening to their concerns as the election approaches.
