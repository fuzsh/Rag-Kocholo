We are successfully competing against much larger schools in all classifications and more than 175 Landmark graduates have earned athletic scholarships to compete at the collegiate level. Landmark student-athlete graduates have competed in the SEC, ACC, and almost all other major conferences in several different sports. Although most Landmark athletes do not play at the next level, they all, elementary, middle, and high school students, will be impacted by their participation in the Landmark Christian athletic program. The peer relationships, godly mentoring, hard work, accountability, physical demands, lessons of winning losing, mental toughness, self-discipline, and teamwork prepare them for the higher calling of impacting their world for Jesus Christ.\n\nLandmark has an impressive history of athletes competing at the next level to continue their athletic careers. More than 175 Landmark graduates have competed in the SEC, ACC, and almost all other major conferences in several different sports."
