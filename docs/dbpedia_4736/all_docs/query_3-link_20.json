        "text": "I was not the athlete who picked up a club and was just naturally good at it, I had to work much more than my peers yet that's why I am so passionate about golf and have had an extreme love for the sport since starting in 2018. However, I feel I grew the most as a student-athlete in the spring and summer before my Junior Year when I was recovering from my eye surgery (Evisceration) and re-learning the whole game of golf, yet keeping high expectations for myself. That hardship helped me grow as a person and lead me to re-focus feeling a good swing and good golf instead of just trusting my eyes.\n\nI do plan and want to play golf in college. Also in college, I'm hoping to major or study in Elementary Education or Marketing and Hospitality. I was fortunate enough to be part of an amazing tournament, Central Links and USKids golf. I learned the game of golf on a simulator yet started playing on courses and in tournaments in 2019 dropping my scores and climbing the leaderboard since. I learned the value of dedication, practice, work ethic, and love for the sport during the first two years of playing tournaments and not even in sight of the leaderboard.\n\nI'm looking for a program that will be a good fit for me athletically as well as academically. I believe I not only have the talent to compete for a college team, but the character, work ethic, and leadership skills to make an immediate impact on your program. As I am on many leadership councils and officers and managers in many clubs such as Events Manager in Chior Leadership Council, Marketing and Publicity/ Social Media officer in my International Thespian Society Troupe, Costumes Co-Manager for my Teatre Department, and I am three-time captain on my golf team and the manager on the boy's team, I know that I have what it takes to be a leader on your team! My name is Nora Schuh, and golf is my passion and I have endless love for it.\n\nI will be graduating from Summit Christian Academy in Leeâ€™s Summit MO. I had an all-around good season with my eye and shoulder taken into consideration. I have already set goals for my senior year, I want to definitely improve my short game and I hope to win the conference and place very well in the district and state tournaments."
