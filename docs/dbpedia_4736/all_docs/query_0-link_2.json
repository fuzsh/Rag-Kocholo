        "text": "FCS encourages all its students to experience athletic competition because the requirements of athletics often play a powerful role in preparing them for all of life. Persistence, discipline, hard work, teamwork, fairness, camaraderie, selflessness, courage, as well as the ability to both win and lose wellâ€”all characteristics of a successful person.\n\nWhen godly coaches modeling godly behavior mold students through athletics, lasting godly character is formed. Athletic competition can give students a deeper understanding of the Gospel itself.\n\nThe goal of Faith Christian School Athletics is that the students move beyond the act of competition to deepen their biblical understanding of its purpose, pitfalls, and rewards."
