        "text": "Superintendent Dr. Chris Ballenger of Warren County Public Schools has shared several updates and important information as the new school year approaches. With school set to start on August 13th, there are many new initiatives and reminders to ensure a smooth and successful year for students, parents, and staff.\n\nOpen House and Community Fun Day Adjustments\n\nOriginally scheduled for Thursday night, the Open House event for all schools has been postponed to Monday, August 12th, due to a tropical depression. Dr. Ballenger emphasized the importance of starting the school year safely, recalling last year’s tornado warning during Open House. The new date will still allow families to meet teachers and ease any first-day jitters despite the quick turnaround for staff preparing for the first day of school.\n\nDespite the weather concerns, the Community Day event is still set to take place on Saturday at Warren County High School from 10 AM to 2 PM. The event will feature various vendors, activities, and a dunk tank, promising a fun day for families to kick off the school year together.\n\nSafety on the Roads\n\nWith school buses back on the roads starting Tuesday, Dr. Ballenger reminded the community to be vigilant about bus safety. When the stop arm is out, vehicles must stop in both directions to ensure the safety of students crossing the street. The importance of this cannot be overstated, as it helps protect the community’s youngest members on their way to and from school.\n\nIn addition to bus safety, school zones will be active again. Drivers should be mindful of flashing lights and reduced speed limits to protect students walking or biking to school. Dr. Ballenger highlighted the presence of cameras in some school zones, which have effectively reduced speeding and enhanced safety.\n\nNew Policies and Initiatives\n\nThis school year brings several new policies and initiatives aimed at improving education and safety. The Virginia Literacy Act (VLA) will be implemented to enhance literacy across elementary schools. Additionally, changes to the standards in math and English will be introduced, aligning with the state’s new requirements. These changes are expected to initially challenge students and teachers but are essential for long-term academic improvement.\n\nThe school board has also addressed cell phone use in schools. Following Governor Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 33, Warren County Public Schools will enforce stricter cell phone policies during instructional time. Students will not be allowed to use cell phones during class, with specific guidelines varying by school level.\n\nAddressing Staffing Shortages\n\nDr. Ballenger acknowledged the ongoing challenge of staffing shortages, a widespread education issue. Warren County Public Schools are currently short of 10 teachers, 2 instructional assistants, 2 nurses, and 2 counselors. However, the superintendent assured that plans are in place to manage these shortages and continue providing quality education.\n\nEncouraging Community Involvement\n\nDr. Ballenger emphasized the importance of community involvement in education. He encouraged parents and community members to attend school events, support their children’s activities, and stay engaged with the schools. Events like band programs, theater performances, and sports games are vital for students, and parental presence can significantly boost their morale.\n\nLooking Forward to a Great Year\n\nDespite the challenges, Dr. Ballenger remains optimistic about the upcoming school year. He praised the school’s staff’s dedication and the community’s support, highlighting that Warren County continues to produce successful graduates who go on to prestigious colleges and careers.\n\nWarren County Public Schools is ready to embark on a new academic year with a focus on safety, academic excellence, and community involvement. Dr. Ballenger’s updates and reminders ensure that everyone is prepared for a successful start to the school year.\n\nTown Talk is a series on the Royal Examiner where we will introduce you to local entrepreneurs, businesses, non-profit leaders, and political figures who influence Warren County.

This marks the revival of a beloved tradition initiated by the restaurant’s former owner, Vincenzo Belvito, who held similar events several times before the pandemic.\n\nChef Biagio Vignola, the current owner of Osteria Maria, has announced that the opera will take place on August 26th and 27th. This year, the event will feature a selection of the greatest hits from various operas performed by professional singers from the Shenandoah Conservatory. Among the performers will be Melissa Chavez, who, along with her colleagues, has performed across the United States. The event is dedicated to the late John Marlow, a figure in Front Royal who never missed a single opera at Osteria Maria.\n\nThe restaurant’s intimate setting allows for just 50 guests per night, meaning only 100 tickets will be available for the entire event. Tickets are priced at $105 per person, with a $25 deposit required to secure a reservation. This helps ensure that guests who reserve a spot will attend, as the restaurant has experienced no-shows in the past despite fully booked reservations.\n\nChef Vignola and his team will treat guests to a four-course meal. The menu includes a late summer salad with local ingredients, house-made butternut squash tortellone, braised short ribs with potatoes and spinach, and a unique Italian-style cheesecake with a crème brûlée twist. The dishes are crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients, a hallmark of Italian cuisine, which Chef Vignola emphasized during a recent interview.\n\nThe event will feature multiple 15-minute opera sets between courses, allowing guests to enjoy the performance in a relaxed and interactive atmosphere. A guide will be provided for those unfamiliar with the opera’s original languages, which include French and Italian, to help them follow along with the performance.\n\nOsteria Maria, located across from Spelunker’s on South Royal Avenue, has a rich history dating back to 1941 when it was first established as the Blue Ridge Steakhouse and Seafood. Since taking over the restaurant, Chef Vignola, who has a background working at prestigious establishments like the Inn of Little Washington, has strived to offer an authentic Italian dining experience. The restaurant is open for lunch from 12 to 2 p.m. and for dinner from 5 to 9 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday.\n\nFor those interested in attending the opera, reservations can be made by visiting Osteria Maria’s website or calling the restaurant directly. With only 100 tickets available, those interested are encouraged to act quickly.\n\nTown Talk is a series on the Royal Examiner where we will introduce you to local entrepreneurs, businesses, non-profit leaders, and political figures who influence Warren County.

At just 14, Milo has already become somewhat of a local celebrity, capturing the hearts and minds of our community with his dedication to the Young Marines program.\n\nMilo’s journey into the Young Marines began through family tradition. His father, a Marine Corps veteran, introduced him to the program after being impressed by the discipline and manners of young Marines he met while volunteering. Milo joined the program at the tender age of eight and has since risen to the rank of sergeant, becoming the platoon sergeant of his unit.\n\n“My dad was very impressed with how well-mannered and respectful they were,” Milo explained. “He thought, ‘I want my kids to be in that program when they get old enough.’ So, when I was eight, I joined.”\n\nMilo’s role in the Young Marines involves more than just drills and discipline. He’s a leader and a mentor, tasked with lesson planning and educating his peers on important issues like drug demand reduction. This initiative aims to inform youth about the dangers of drugs, a cornerstone of the Young Marines’ mission.\n\n“The main part of the Young Marines is youth DDR, which is drug demand reduction,” Milo said. “We try to reach all the youth in the U.S., telling them the dangers of drugs and why you shouldn’t do them.”\n\nMilo’s commitment to leadership is evident through his participation in the Young Marines’ leadership academies. He has completed the junior and senior leadership schools, earning ribbons for his achievements, and aims to attend the advanced leadership school next year. These programs teach vital skills such as decisiveness, public speaking, and effective communication.\n\n“We learned how to be better leaders, how to be decisive,” Milo shared. “It was really fun. There were a ton of kids from the East Coast area.”\n\nBalancing his commitments to the Young Marines and his education at Randolph-Macon Academy (RMA) is no small feat. Milo, who will enter the ninth grade, is already making his mark academically and socially. His experiences in the Young Marines have bolstered his confidence and public speaking skills, which he uses in school.\n\n“I used to be petrified of speaking to adults and stuff,” Milo admitted. “But now, what I’m doing right now, I would not have wanted to do this before. The Young Marines taught me a lot about that.”\n\nMilo’s mother, Celia, is immensely proud of his achievements. She credits the Young Marines program with instilling in him a sense of perseverance and discipline.\n\n“He puts so much work and drive into everything he does,” Celia said. “The Young Marines program really helped him with that and taught him how to keep pushing and researching how to get better.”\n\nMilo’s ambitions extend beyond the Young Marines. He dreams of attending the Naval Academy to study engineering and business, with the ultimate goal of becoming an officer in the Marine Corps and starting a hydroponics business.\n\n“Naval Academy is my big dream,” Milo revealed. “I want to do my years of service while also learning and taking college. I want to own a hydroponics business. We’re building a greenhouse at my house right now.”\n\nMilo’s dedication to the Young Marines has inspired his younger sister, who, at ten years old, is also part of the program and holds the rank of Lance Corporal. The Medina family embodies the spirit of service, community, and continuous improvement.\n\n“It’s a competition right now,” Milo joked. “I’m going to see who gets higher first.”\n\nCelia is also deeply involved, supporting her children and the broader community of young Marines. She emphasizes the importance of the program’s communal support and the life lessons it imparts.\n\n“We treat all the kids as if they were our own,” Celia explained. “It’s about being a community and being there for all the youth.”\n\nMilo’s journey with the Young Marines is far from over. Milo’s future is bright, with plans to reach higher ranks and his eyes set on the Naval Academy. His story is a testament to the power of perseverance, discipline, and community support. The Young Marines program has shaped him into a leader and prepared him for a lifetime of success and service.\n\nAs the Town Talk concluded, Milo gives us a glimpse of his philosophy: “It’s always about perseverance, trying to improve yourself, not just as a young Marine but as a person.”\n\nWe look forward to following Milo’s journey and celebrating his future successes. His story inspires all young people striving to make a difference in their communities and beyond.\n\nClick her to find out more about the Young Marines program.\n\nAbout the Young Marines\n\nThe Young Marines is a national non-profit 501(c)(3) youth education and service program open to boys and girls from age eight through high school graduation. This program is dedicated to promoting its members’ mental, moral, and physical development. It emphasizes leadership, teamwork, and self-discipline, encouraging members to live and advocate for a healthy, drug-free lifestyle.\n\nAmerican youth are taught the importance of self-confidence, academic achievement, honoring veterans, good citizenship, and community service through the Young Marines. By focusing on character building and leadership, the program prepares its members to become productive members of society.\n\nIn 1959, in Waterbury, Connecticut, a group of former Marines founded an organization for boys that mirrored the values of the Marine Corps. Their vision of offering leadership training and essential life skills laid the foundation for what would become the Young Marines. Today, the program has expanded to include over 236 units nationwide and is highly respected. Despite its growth, the focus remains the same: to strengthen the lives of America’s youth by teaching self-confidence, academic achievement, honoring veterans, good citizenship, community service, and living a healthy, drug-free lifestyle. The core values of leadership, teamwork, and discipline are deeply ingrained and practiced by all members.\n\nTown Talk is a series on the Royal Examiner where we will introduce you to local entrepreneurs, businesses, non-profit leaders, and political figures who influence Warren County.

Eshelman, who has been actively engaging with the community, shared insights on critical issues like the town’s water supply and his vision for its future.\n\nEshelman emphasized the importance of addressing the persistent water shortage in the town. “We need a secondary water source, and we should be talking about it,” he said. Despite acknowledging that solutions can’t be implemented overnight, Eshelman criticized the current administration for not taking sufficient action. He recalled a suggestion for a water committee made in a liaison meeting last October, which was well-received but never acted upon.\n\nEshelman pointed out that no concrete actions have been taken while discussions about water have occurred. He expressed frustration over the lost time, noting, “We’ve lost a whole year. We can’t recapture that, but I tend to think that if we had some forward-thinking vision, this is something we could have been working on already.” He suggested various potential solutions, including utilizing McKay Springs, exploring quarries, creating a reservoir, and even recycling water.\n\nApart from water issues, Eshelman talked about his extensive experience in revitalizing Front Royal’s downtown area. He recounted purchasing and refurbishing several historic buildings, turning them into successful businesses. One notable project was the transformation of the old McCrory 5 and Dime store into an antique emporium, which eventually housed various businesses, contributing to the town’s economic growth.\n\nEshelman also highlighted his tenure as general manager of the Shenandoah County Fair, where he brought horse racing to the fairgrounds, providing a significant financial boost to the community. He emphasized the need to leverage such experiences to enhance tourism and local business development in Front Royal. “The Warren County Fairgrounds is a hidden gem,” he said, advocating for better utilization of local resources to attract visitors and stimulate the economy.\n\nIn terms of governance, Eshelman expressed his desire to form various committees to address pressing issues. He believes in involving community members with expertise in relevant fields. “The solutions to a lot of our problems are in our community,” he said, emphasizing the importance of local input over external consultants.\n\nEshelman’s campaign also stresses the importance of representing all citizens, not just those who vote for him. He values the independence of his candidacy, free from partisan pressures, and aims to be a mayor for all residents. “Everybody has a voice, and being an independent candidate, we’re not getting that partisan endorsement, but independent candidates are free to think on their own,” he stated.\n\nEshelman plans to continue engaging with residents, attending events, and listening to their concerns as the election approaches. He hopes that his business acumen and proactive approach will resonate with voters. “We need to prioritize it,” he said, referring to the town’s water issue. “Hopefully, we’ll find solutions no matter who’s the mayor and who’s the council.”\n\nWith early voting starting in September, Eshelman and other candidates ramp up their campaigns, making their cases to the electorate. Front Royal’s future, particularly its water security and economic vitality, remains a key focus in this election, with candidates like Eshelman promising action and innovation.\n\nTown Talk is a series on the Royal Examiner where we will introduce you to local entrepreneurs, businesses, non-profit leaders, and political figures who influence Warren County.

Susan Schwartz, one of the directors, describes it as a ministry that helps teens develop valuable skills such as public speaking, confidence, and teamwork.\n\nThe club typically stages two to three productions a year.

This area stretches from Winchester to the West Virginia line, covering the 81 corridor with 75 clubs and nearly 3,000 Rotarians. Taking office on July 1st, Brett will lead the district with a focus on expanding membership and enhancing the club’s impact on both local and global scales.\n\nHrbek, who previously served as the Front Royal Rotary Club president, is now becoming more prominent. “My job as district governor is to ensure the infrastructure is established and working well for all the clubs,” he explained. This involves supporting and training clubs, ensuring their activities thrive, and facilitating collaboration.\n\nWith over 40,000 clubs and 1.4 million members worldwide, Rotary International is committed to service above self. The organization’s initiatives range from ending polio to advocating for peace, providing clean water, and supporting education. However, Hrbek emphasizes that most of Rotary’s impactful community service happens at the club level. “We want other people to know what we’re doing so they’ll come and join us,” he said, highlighting the importance of visibility for recruiting new members.\n\nHrbek’s vision includes making Rotary more accessible and appealing to diverse communities. “We have clubs that meet in the evening, in the morning, at lunchtime. We have satellite clubs,” he shared. This flexibility accommodates various schedules and demographics, from teachers to working professionals. Reducing membership costs is also a priority to attract passionate individuals eager to serve their communities.\n\nOne of Hrbek’s key initiatives is promoting peace and conflict resolution. He believes that many of Rotary’s focus areas, such as clean water and economic development, contribute to global peace. Herbeck advocates for starting peace at a local level, encouraging respectful interactions and understanding within communities. He also promotes the installation of peace poles in public spaces as symbols of Rotary’s commitment to peace.\n\nHrbek also aims to address mental health, or as he prefers to call it, mental fitness. He stresses the importance of supporting mental well-being, particularly among men and boys, who are facing increasing rates of mental health issues and suicide. “We need more men to be mentors,” he said, highlighting the role of Rotarians in providing guidance and support to younger generations.\n\nRotary’s youth programs, such as EarlyAct for elementary students and Interact for middle and high schoolers, play a crucial role in fostering leadership and service values. Hrbek praised Michael Williams, a dedicated teacher at E. Wilson Elementary School in Front Royal and Rotarian, for his work mentoring young students. These programs aim to instill a sense of service and community involvement from an early age.\n\nHrbek is optimistic about Rotary’s future and impact. He believes growing membership and enhancing engagement are vital for the organization’s continued success. “Rotary Club equals happiness,” he said, summarizing the sense of purpose, sacrifice, and enjoyment of being part of this global service organization.\n\nFor more information about joining Rotary or learning about its initiatives, visit the Rotary District 7570 website. Hrbek and other Rotarians are always eager to welcome new members who share their passion for service and community.\n\nTown Talk is a series on the Royal Examiner where we will introduce you to local entrepreneurs, businesses, non-profit leaders, and political figures who influence Warren County.

Grace Green and Machal Ashby from the local library joined Mike McCool in the Royal Examiner’s studio to share the exciting lineup of events.\n\nThis year, the Adult Summer Reading Program is a bit different. Instead of counting how many books you read, it’s about how long you’ve been reading. Plenty of fun events and prizes, including the “Bad Romance and Beyond” theme, focus on adventurous and sometimes quirky love stories. Grace explained that “bad romance” refers to those surprising stories that make you think, “Wow, that was published?”\n\nAnother engaging adult activity is the “Journal Book Craft” on July 20th, hosted by Whitney, the resident artist. Participants will receive a hardbound book to personalize and decorate, turning it into an adventure journal for garden projects, nature observations, or anything else they fancy.\n\nThe “Walking Book Club” is set for July 2nd. Participants will enjoy a leisurely walk around nearby parks while discussing any books they’ve read. And every Tuesday at 2 PM, there’s “What the Tech,” where you can get help with electronics from friendly library staff.\n\nAdditionally, there’s the “Tiny Art Gallery.” Participants who received tiny art kits last month can now see their creations displayed on two bookshelves in the library.\n\nThe children’s summer reading program is in full swing with hundreds of participants. Every time a child reads a book or listens to five, they get a free book or prize. Grace encourages everyone to sign up and join the fun.\n\nSpecial programs for kids include the “Rainbow Puppets” show on July 23rd at 10:30 AM, featuring classic tales like Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast. On July 27th at 2 PM, the “Misunderstood Duck” theatrical performance by the Hard Act to Follow theater troupe will entertain audiences with a unique story.\n\nLive reptiles will visit the library on July 30th at 2 PM. Reptile experts Scott and Kim Larson will share fascinating stories about rare lizards and other reptiles, promising an exciting and educational experience.\n\nThere’s an art program on July 6th at 11 AM for aspiring artists where elementary-age students can recreate and reinterpret classic paintings. The “Summer Slime” event is back by popular demand on July 13th at 3 PM, where kids can get messy and creative with slime.\n\nPartnering with Parks and Rec, the library also offers “Toddler Trails” on July 12th at 10 AM at Chimney Fields or Peter Luther Park. This program focuses on the wonderful world of dandelions, including tasting them, making crafts, and hearing stories.\n\nA new program called “Wildlife in the Garden” on July 13th encourages children to gather facts about animals and write creatively about them. It’s a great way to slow down, observe nature, and reflect on their experiences.\n\nLastly, “Teens Connect” on July 20th at 2:30 PM offers teens a chance to play chess, guided by the new assistant, Ben Garrand, who is enthusiastic about teaching this classic game.\n\nThe library’s comprehensive list of events is available on its website, making it easy for everyone to find something exciting and fun to do this summer.\n\nWhether you’re an adult looking for a creative outlet, a child eager to explore new stories and activities, or a teen wanting to connect over chess, the library has something for you.
