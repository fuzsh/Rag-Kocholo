        "text": "Cross-country is arguably the most consistent sport among Fort Collins-area prep schools.\n\nEvery year, there's elite success â€” and last year was the latest example.\n\nLocal runners accounted for seven podium finishes at the state meet, with Heritage Christian winning a Class 2A girls team title, Liberty Common's Isabel Allori repeating as 3A girls champ and the Fossil Ridge girls beating out nationally-ranked competition for a runner-up 5A finish.\n\nThis year should be no different. While a generational standout like Allori is gone, there are plenty of state contenders returning this fall.\n\nMore athletes to watch: Top Fort Collins-area softball stars this season\n\nHere are a dozen Fort Collins-area cross-country runners to watch for the fall 2024 high school season:\n\nTatum Berg, Fossil Ridge\n\nBerg is the top returning runner for a Fossil Ridge squad that brings back nearly its entire scoring roster from a remarkable 5A runner-up finish last fall.\n\nThe senior has been a SaberCats staple since she was a freshman and is poised for a big final season.\n\nBerg had her best year yet as a junior, placing 12th individually at state cross-country while also earning top-five Class 5A finishes at state track in the one- and two-mile events.\n\nCadel Ruthven, Fort Collins\n\nThe Lambkins' junior had a breakout sophomore campaign, posting four sub-16 minute times and earning a podium finish (10th) at the 5A state meet.\n\nHe followed that up with a strong spring on the track, which included top-three state track performances (800 and 1,600 meters) and four new personal-record times at the Nike Outdoor Nationals.\n\nRuthven could help Fort Collins vault into the 5A top 5 with a junior jump.\n\nIzzy Schimmelpfennig, Timnath\n\nThe rising Cubs' sophomore burst onto the scene as a freshman. She placed fifth among 2A runners at the state meet, won an event and had three other runner-up finishes during the season.\n\nSchimmelpfennig has one of the 50 best times (18 minutes, 29.76 seconds) among all classes for returning Colorado girls runners, but the task gets tougher with Timnath moving up from Class 3A to 4A this season.\n\nCarter Brazelton, Fossil Ridge\n\nBrazelton could be a force this year, and he leads the returning local boys runners with the top time last year (15:30). He took third in regionals and 21st at the 5A state race and was also a top-20 distance performer at state track.\n\nThere are high hopes for the Fossil Ridge boys squad this fall, and the SaberCats' senior could lead that charge.\n\nMikaela Kendall, Heritage Christian\n\nKendall has already shined as an underclassmen, winning a state track title as a freshman and finishing runner-up in 2A cross-country last year. Oh yeah, she also helped the Eagles win their first-ever cross-country team title.\n\nHeritage Christian returns much of that championship squad, so it should be another big fall for Kendall and co.\n\nMia Williams, Fossil Ridge\n\nThe SaberCats' senior forms a dynamic distance duo with Berg, and she's not exactly far behind.\n\nShe posted a top-20 finish among 5A runners at state last year and threatened the sub-18 minute mark (18:01) with a PR at the Liberty Bell Invite. Williams also posted two PRs at the Nike Outdoor Nationals in June, bringing momentum into her final prep season.\n\nTyson Bhalla, Rocky Mountain\n\nThe Lobos' senior is the picture of consistency, scoring eight top-10 finishes in his junior season and only going over 17 minutes once.\n\nHe set a new PR (15:52) in the Front Range League Championships and was a top-10 Class 5A performer in the two-mile run at state track last spring. Expect Bhalla to be Rocky's top runner for an improving boys team.\n\nLeah McDonald, Poudre\n\nMcDonald surged in her junior season, winning the Andy Meyers Invitational in Greeley (with a new course and personal best time of 18:01.60) and earning four other top-10 finishes.\n\nShe narrowly missed out on 5A state qualifying despite an eighth-place FRL finish. McDonald should be among the state pick this time.\n\nLindsey Kaines, Rocky Mountain\n\nKaines will lead the Lobos' girls team this fall after a strong 2023 season that saw her place among the top-50 runners in Class 5A at state.\n\nThe senior has one of the top returning local times (18:26) and added a top-10 finish in the 800 meters at state track last spring. After several close class last year, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Kaines get a race win this season.\n\nIan Molgaard, Heritage Christian\n\nThe Eagles' junior looks like a contender this fall, coming off a seventh-place finish (and new PR of 16:48.20) in Class 2A at last year's state meet.\n\nMolgaard was also runner-up at the Mile High/Foothills league meet and fifth in 2A regional action. Heritage Christian has a strong junior class, but expect Molgaard to lead the pack.\n\nSorrelle Salcido, Fort Collins\n\nThe Fort Collins senior could improve on a promising junior campaign, when she shaved over two minutes off her average time and posted three top-10 race finishes.\n\nIf Salcido shows similar improvement in her final season, she could challenge for city supremacy and help the Lambkins continue the school's proud distance running tradition.\n\nAddison Geraets, Timnath\n\nIt's time for seniors to shine at Timnath, with the school finally having seniors in the school's third year.\n\nGeraets has already made her mark, placing ninth and 22nd at her first two 3A state meets and winning a 300 hurdles track title while helping the Cubs win their first-ever team championship last spring.\n\nShe'll help Timnath adjust to Class 4A competition as a leader for the Cubs' deep, talented distance team.\n\nBonus names to know:"
