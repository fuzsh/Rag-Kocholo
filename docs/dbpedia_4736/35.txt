After trailing late in the fourth, the Bears forced overtime and went on a 15-2 run to take the title. The team was led by senior co-captain and state MVP Makenna Secrist, who averaged 24 points per game this season.

On Monday, Blue Ridge Christian School celebrated the Bears and their historic achievement by hosting a ceremony honoring the team.

“I’ve been a student here since preschool, so this is a really big deal for us. Everyone came to watch us play; we won the title for our school and our families,” said Secrist.

According to sophomore co-captain Callie Paradzinski, camaraderie was a defining factor in the success of the team.

“I’ve played basketball for most of my life and I love the sport. There is a sense of community, and it’s amazing to contribute to the team,” said Paradzinski.

For head coach Harold Henderlite, the championship marks the start of a bright future for the Blue Ridge program.

“The girls played their hearts out. This is the first time we’ve had a winning season, so the state title signals a big turnaround for the program,” added Henderlite.
