Homework is done, football practice is over—so now what? At Blue Ridge School, there’s always a fun answer to that question. Like fly fishing. Ultimate Frisbee. Video gaming. Poetry slams. Cooking. Whatever the boys’ interests, they can build a club around it and chances are good a Blue Ridge faculty member will join in, too. From music and broadcasting to robotics, mountain biking, volunteerism, and art, there are kindred spirits on campus eager to create a community around it.

While the clubs are informal, we also plan formal weekend activities that take boys away from campus where they can mingle with other boys and, perhaps more importantly, girls! Here are some of the places Blue Ridge School boys are likely to be seen socializing in supervised environments on the weekends:

Short Pump and Tyson’s Corner mall trips

Trips to Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall

D.C. trips for cultural and historic enrichment

Mixers with girls’ schools, such as Madeira and Foxcroft

Weekly trips to the movies

Skiing at Massanutten and Wintergreen

Hiking in the Shenandoah National Park

Fishing, canoeing, and camping trips

University of Virginia athletics and events
