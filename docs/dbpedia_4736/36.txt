The TCS Flag Football team is one of our coed sports that has competed in the Blue Ridge Mountain Conference (BRMC).

The team has won a BRMC regular season and tournament championship while setting a record for wins in a season and becoming the first team to go undefeated with a record of 6-0.

We measure success through hard work, effort, and dedication to teamwork. Our program expects and demands Christ-like attitudes on and off the field from our players. We also expect our athletes to excel in the classroom. We believe athletics teaches more than how to play a sport; it teaches them traits and characteristics that will enable them to be successful citizens.

The TCS coed soccer program began in 2013. While having experience is a great benefit, you do not have to be an experienced player to be part of the team. The volunteer coach teaches fundamentals of the team sport and how to become skilled and competitive while showing a Godly attitude . Playing a team sport like soccer helps build character and leadership skills that athletes can manifest beyond the game itself.
