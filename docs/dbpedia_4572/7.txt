Evaluation of hydrological models on small mountainous catchments: impact of the meteorological forcings

Guillaume Evin, Matthieu Le Lay, Catherine Fouchier, David Penot, Francois Colleoni, Alexandre Mas, Pierre-AndrÃ© Garambois, and Olivier Laurantin

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 261–281, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-261-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-261-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

Hydrological modelling of mountainous catchments is challenging for many reasons, the main one being the temporal and spatial representation of precipitation forcings. This study presents an evaluation of the hydrological modelling of 55 small mountainous catchments of the northern French Alps, focusing on the influence of the type of precipitation reanalyses used as inputs. These evaluations emphasize the added value of radar measurements, in particular for the reproduction of flood events.

Projecting sediment export from two highly glacierized alpine catchments under climate change: exploring non-parametric regression as an analysis tool

Lena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, and Axel Bronstert

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 139–161, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

How suspended sediment export from glacierized high-alpine areas responds to future climate change is hardly assessable as many interacting processes are involved, and appropriate physical models are lacking. We present the first study, to our knowledge, exploring machine learning to project sediment export until 2100 in two high-alpine catchments. We find that uncertainties due to methodological limitations are small until 2070. Negative trends imply that peak sediment may have already passed.

Short summary

Short summary

We analyzed the water budget of nested karst catchments using simple methods and modeling. By utilizing the available data on precipitation and discharge, we were able to determine the response lag-time by adopting new techniques. Additionally, we modeled snow cover dynamics and evapotranspiration with the use of Earth observations, providing a concise overview of the water budget for the basin and its subbasins. We have made the data, models, and workflows accessible for further study.

Comparing quantile regression forest and mixture density long short-term memory models for probabilistic post-processing of satellite precipitation-driven streamflow simulations

Yuhang Zhang, Aizhong Ye, Bita Analui, Phu Nguyen, Soroosh Sorooshian, Kuolin Hsu, and Yuxuan Wang

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4529–4550, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4529-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4529-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Our study shows that while the quantile regression forest (QRF) and countable mixtures of asymmetric Laplacians long short-term memory (CMAL-LSTM) models demonstrate similar proficiency in multipoint probabilistic predictions, QRF excels in smaller watersheds and CMAL-LSTM in larger ones. CMAL-LSTM performs better in single-point deterministic predictions, whereas QRF model is more efficient overall.

Recent ground thermo-hydrological changes in a southern Tibetan endorheic catchment and implications for lake level changes

LÃ©o C. P. Martin, Sebastian Westermann, Michele Magni, Fanny Brun, Joel Fiddes, Yanbin Lei, Philip Kraaijenbrink, Tamara Mathys, Moritz Langer, Simon Allen, and Walter W. Immerzeel

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4409–4436, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Across the Tibetan Plateau, many large lakes have been changing level during the last decades as a response to climate change. In high-mountain environments, water fluxes from the land to the lakes are linked to the ground temperature of the land and to the energy fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, which are modified by climate change. With a numerical model, we test how these water and energy fluxes have changed over the last decades and how they influence the lake level variations.

Towards robust seasonal streamflow forecasts in mountainous catchments: impact of calibration metric selection in hydrological modeling

Diego Araya, Pablo A. Mendoza, Eduardo MuÃ±oz-Castro, and James McPhee

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4385–4408, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4385-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4385-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Dynamical systems are used by many agencies worldwide to produce seasonal streamflow forecasts, which are critical for decision-making. Such systems rely on hydrology models, which contain parameters that are typically estimated using a target performance metric (i.e., objective function). This study explores the effects of this decision across mountainous basins in Chile, illustrating tradeoffs between seasonal forecast quality and the models' capability to simulate streamflow characteristics.

Modelling flood frequency and magnitude in a glacially conditioned, heterogeneous landscape: testing the importance of land cover and land use

Pamela E. Tetford and Joseph R. Desloges

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3977–3998, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3977-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3977-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

An efficient regional flood frequency model relates drainage area to discharge, with a major assumption of similar basin conditions. In a landscape with variable glacial deposits and land use, we characterize varying hydrological function using 28 explanatory variables. We demonstrate that (1) a heterogeneous landscape requires objective model selection criteria to optimize the fit of flow data, and (2) incorporating land use as a predictor variable improves the drainage area to discharge model.

Direct integration of reservoirs' operations in a hydrological model for streamflow estimation: coupling a CLSTM model with MOHID-Land

Ana Ramos Oliveira, Tiago Brito Ramos, LÃ­gia Pinto, and Ramiro Neves

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3875–3893, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3875-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3875-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

This paper intends to demonstrate the adequacy of a hybrid solution to overcome the difficulties related to the incorporation of human behavior when modeling hydrological processes. Two models were implemented, one to estimate the outflow of a reservoir and the other to simulate the hydrological processes of the watershed. With both models feeding each other, results show that the proposed approach significantly improved the streamflow estimation downstream of the reservoir.

Towards Interpretable LSTM-based Modelling of Hydrological Systems

Luis Andres De la Fuente, Mohammad Reza Ehsani, Hoshin Vijai Gupta, and Laura Elizabeth Condon

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-252,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-252, 2023

Revised manuscript accepted for HESS

Short summary

Short summary

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a widely used machine learning model in hydrology. However, it is difficult to extract knowledge from it. We propose HydroLSTM which represents processes like a hydrological reservoir. Models based on HydroLSTM perform similarly to LSTM while requiring fewer cell states. The learned parameters are informative about the dominant hydrology of a catchment.Our results show how parsimony and hydrological knowledge extraction can be achieved by using the new structure.

Modelling the regional sensitivity of snowmelt, soil moisture, and streamflow generation to climate over the Canadian Prairies using a basin classification approach

Zhihua He, Kevin Shook, Christopher Spence, John W. Pomeroy, and Colin Whitfield

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3525–3546, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on snowmelt, soil moisture, and streamflow over the Canadian Prairies. The entire prairie region was divided into seven basin types. We found strong variations of hydrological sensitivity to precipitation and temperature changes in different land covers and basins, which suggests that different water management and adaptation methods are needed to address enhanced water stress due to expected climate change in different regions of the prairies.

To what extent does river routing matter in hydrological modeling?

NicolÃ¡s CortÃ©s-Salazar, NicolÃ¡s VÃ¡squez, Naoki Mizukami, Pablo A. Mendoza, and Ximena Vargas

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3505–3524, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3505-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3505-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

This paper shows how important river models can be for water resource applications that involve hydrological models and, in particular, parameter calibration. To this end, we conduct numerical experiments in a pilot basin using a combination of hydrologic model simulations obtained from a large sample of parameter sets and different routing methods. We find that routing can affect streamflow simulations, even at monthly time steps; the choice of parameters; and relevant streamflow metrics.

Calibrating macroscale hydrological models in poorly gauged and heavily regulated basins

Dung Trung Vu, Thanh Duc Dang, Francesca Pianosi, and Stefano Galelli

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3485–3504, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3485-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3485-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

The calibration of hydrological models over extensive spatial domains is often challenged by the lack of data on river discharge and the operations of hydraulic infrastructures. Here, we use satellite data to address the lack of data that could unintentionally bias the calibration process. Our study is underpinned by a computational framework that quantifies this bias and provides a safe approach to the calibration of models in poorly gauged and heavily regulated basins.

Francesco Fatone, Bartosz SzelÄ g, PrzemysÅaw Kowal, Arthur McGarity, Adam Kiczko, Grzegorz WaÅek, Ewa Wojciechowska, MichaÅ Stachura, and Nicolas Caradot

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3329–3349, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3329-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3329-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

A novel methodology for the development of a stormwater network performance simulator including advanced risk assessment was proposed. The applied tool enables the analysis of the influence of spatial variability in catchment and stormwater network characteristics on the relation between (SWMM) model parameters and specific flood volume, as an alternative approach to mechanistic models. The proposed method can be used at the stage of catchment model development and spatial planning management.

airGRteaching: an open-source tool for teaching hydrological modeling withÂ R

Olivier Delaigue, Pierre Brigode, Guillaume Thirel, and Laurent Coron

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3293–3327, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3293-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3293-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Teaching hydrological modeling is an important, but difficult, matter. It requires appropriate tools and teaching material. In this article, we present the airGRteaching package, which is an open-source software tool relying on widely used hydrological models. This tool proposes an interface and numerous hydrological modeling exercises representing a wide range of hydrological applications. We show how this tool can be applied to simple but real-life cases.

Stable water isotopes and tritium tracers tell the same tale: no evidence for underestimation of catchment transit times inferred by stable isotopes in StorAge Selection (SAS)-function models

Siyuan Wang, Markus Hrachowitz, Gerrit Schoups, and Christine Stumpp

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3083–3114, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3083-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3083-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

This study shows that previously reported underestimations of water ages are most likely not due to the use of seasonally variable tracers. Rather, these underestimations can be largely attributed to the choices of model approaches which rely on assumptions not frequently met in catchment hydrology. We therefore strongly advocate avoiding the use of this model type in combination with seasonally variable tracers and instead adopting StorAge Selection (SAS)-based or comparable model formulations.

Uncertainty in water transit time estimation with StorAge Selection functions and tracer data interpolation

Arianna Borriero, Rohini Kumar, Tam V. Nguyen, Jan H. Fleckenstein, and Stefanie R. Lutz

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2989–3004, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2989-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2989-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

We analyzed the uncertainty of the water transit time distribution (TTD) arising from model input (interpolated tracer data) and structure (StorAge Selection, SAS, functions). We found that uncertainty was mainly associated with temporal interpolation, choice of SAS function, nonspatial interpolation, and low-flow conditions. It is important to characterize the specific uncertainty sources and their combined effects on TTD, as this has relevant implications for both water quantity and quality.

Changes in Mediterranean flood processes and seasonality

Yves Tramblay, Patrick Arnaud, Guillaume Artigue, Michel Lang, Emmanuel Paquet, Luc Neppel, and Eric Sauquet

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2973–2987, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2973-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2973-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Mediterranean floods are causing major damage, and recent studies have shown that, despite the increase in intense rainfall, there has been no increase in river floods. This study reveals that the seasonality of floods changed in the Mediterranean Basin during 1959–2021. There was also an increased frequency of floods linked to short episodes of intense rain, associated with a decrease in soil moisture. These changes need to be taken into consideration to adapt flood warning systems.

On optimization of calibrations of a distributed hydrological model with spatially distributed information on snow

Dipti Tiwari, MÃ©lanie Trudel, and Robert Leconte

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-143,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-143, 2023

Revised manuscript accepted for HESS

Short summary

Short summary

Calibrating hydrological models with multiple objective functions enhances model robustness. By integrating spatially distributed snow information into the calibration process, the overall performance of the model can be enhanced without compromising the model outputs. In this study, HYDROTEL model was calibrated in seven different experiments, incorporating the SPAEF (SPAtial Efficiency metric) alongside NSE and RMSE, with the aim of identifying the optimal calibration strategy.

Glaciers determine the sensitivity of hydrological processes to perturbed climate in a large mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau

Yi Nan and Fuqiang Tian

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-182,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-182, 2023

Revised manuscript accepted for HESS

Short summary

Short summary

This paper utilized a tracer-aided model validated by multiple datasets in a large mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau to analyze the hydrological sensitivity to climate change. The spatial pattern of the local hydrological sensitivities and the influence factors were analyzed in particular. The main finding of this paper is that the local hydrological sensitivity in mountainous basins is determined by the relationship between the glacier area ratio and the mean annual precipitation.

Technical Note: Testing the Connection Between Hillslope Scale Runoff Fluctuations and Streamflow Hydrographs at the Outlet of Large River Basins

Ricardo Mantilla, Morgan Fonley, and Nicolas Velasquez

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-187,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-187, 2023

Revised manuscript accepted for HESS

Short summary

Short summary

Hydrologists strive to “Be right for the right reasons” when modeling the hydrologic cycle, however, the datasets available to validate hydrological models are sparse, and in many cases, they comprise streamflow observations at the outlets of large catchments. In this work, we show that matching streamflow observations at the outlet of a large basin is not a reliable indicator that a correct description of the small-scale runoff processes.

Flow intermittence prediction using a hybrid hydrological modelling approach: influence of observed intermittence data on the training of a random forest model

Louise Mimeau, Annika KÃ¼nne, Flora Branger, Sven Kralisch, Alexandre Devers, and Jean-Philippe Vidal

EGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1322,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1322, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Modelling flow intermittence is essential for predicting the future evolution of drying in river networks and better understanding the ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, modelling flow intermittence is challenging and observed data on temporary rivers is scarce. This study presents a new modelling approach for predicting flow intermittence in river networks and shows that combining different sources of observed data reduces the model uncertainty.

Can the combining of wetlands with reservoir operation reduce the risk of future floods and droughts?

Yanfeng Wu, Jingxuan Sun, Boting Hu, Y. Jun Xu, Alain N. Rousseau, and Guangxin Zhang

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2725–2745, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2725-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2725-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Reservoirs and wetlands are important regulators of watershed hydrology, which should be considered when projecting floods and droughts. We first coupled wetlands and reservoir operations into a semi-spatially-explicit hydrological model and then applied it in a case study involving a large river basin in northeast China. We found that, overall, the risk of future floods and droughts will increase further even under the combined influence of reservoirs and wetlands.

Knowledge-informed deep learning for hydrological model calibration: an application to Coal Creek Watershed in Colorado

Peishi Jiang, Pin Shuai, Alexander Sun, Maruti K. Mudunuru, and Xingyuan Chen

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2621–2644, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2621-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2621-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

We developed a novel deep learning approach to estimate the parameters of a computationally expensive hydrological model on only a few hundred realizations. Our approach leverages the knowledge obtained by data-driven analysis to guide the design of the deep learning model used for parameter estimation. We demonstrate this approach by calibrating a state-of-the-art hydrological model against streamflow and evapotranspiration observations at a snow-dominated watershed in Colorado.

Leveraging gauge networks and strategic discharge measurements to aid development of continuous streamflow records

Michael J. Vlah, Matthew R. V. Ross, Spencer Rhea, and Emily S. Bernhardt

EGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1178,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1178, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Virtual stream gauging enables continuous streamflow estimation where a gauge might be difficult or impractical to install. We reconstructed flow at 27 gauges of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), informing ~199 site-months of missing data in the official record, and improving upon official estimates at 11 sites. This study shows that machine learning, but also routine regression methods, can be used to supplement existing gauge networks and reduce monitoring costs.

When best is the enemy of good â critical evaluation of performance criteria in hydrological models

Guillaume Cinkus, Naomi Mazzilli, HervÃ© Jourde, Andreas Wunsch, Tanja Liesch, NataÅ¡a Ravbar, Zhao Chen, and Nico Goldscheider

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2397–2411, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2397-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2397-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

The Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) is a performance criterion extensively used to evaluate hydrological models. We conduct a critical study on the KGE and its variant to examine counterbalancing errors. Results show that, when assessing a simulation, concurrent over- and underestimation of discharge can lead to an overall higher criterion score without an associated increase in model relevance. We suggest that one carefully choose performance criteria and use scaling factors.

The suitability of differentiable, physics-informed machine learning hydrologic models for ungauged regions and climate change impact assessment

Dapeng Feng, Hylke Beck, Kathryn Lawson, and Chaopeng Shen

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2357–2373, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2357-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2357-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Powerful hybrid models (called Î´ or delta models) embrace the fundamental learning capability of AI and can also explain the physical processes. Here we test their performance when applied to regions not in the training data. Î´ models rivaled the accuracy of state-of-the-art AI models under the data-dense scenario and even surpassed them for the data-sparse one. They generalize well due to the physical structure included. Î´ models could be ideal candidates for global hydrologic assessment.

Producing reliable hydrologic scenarios from raw climate model outputs without resorting to meteorological observations

Simon Ricard, Philippe Lucas-Picher, Antoine Thiboult, and FranÃ§ois Anctil

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2375–2395, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2375-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2375-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

A simplified hydroclimatic modelling workflow is proposed to quantify the impact of climate change on water discharge without resorting to meteorological observations. Results confirm that the proposed workflow produces equivalent projections of the seasonal mean flows in comparison to a conventional hydroclimatic modelling approach. The proposed approach supports the participation of end-users in interpreting the impact of climate change on water resources.

Using normalised difference infrared index patterns to constrain semi-distributed rainfallârunoff models in tropical nested catchments

Nutchanart Sriwongsitanon, Wasana Jandang, James Williams, Thienchart Suwawong, Ekkarin Maekan, and Hubert H. G. Savenije

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2149–2171, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2149-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2149-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

We developed predictive semi-distributed rainfall–runoff models for nested sub-catchments in the upper Ping basin, which yielded better or similar performance compared to calibrated lumped models. The normalised difference infrared index proves to be an effective proxy for distributed root zone moisture capacity over sub-catchments and is well correlated with the percentage of evergreen forest. In validation, soil moisture simulations appeared to be highly correlated with the soil wetness index.

Deep learning for monthly rainfall-runoff modelling: a comparison with classical rainfall-runoff modelling across Australia

Stephanie R. Clark, Julien Lerat, Jean-Michel Perraud, and Peter Fitch

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-124,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-124, 2023

Revised manuscript accepted for HESS

Short summary

Short summary

Are machine learning models able to produce reliable rainfall-runoff predictions and add enough benefits that justify the effort to implement these methods? This study covers a large set of Australian catchments (almost 500) comparing deep learning and traditional model results. The deep learning model matched or exceeded conceptual model performance for more than two-thirds of the study catchments, indicating the general viability of these models in a variety of catchments conditions.

Revisiting the hydrological basis of the Budyko framework with the principle of hydrologically similar groups

Yuchan Chen, Xiuzhi Chen, Meimei Xue, Chuanxun Yang, Wei Zheng, Jun Cao, Wenting Yan, and Wenping Yuan

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1929–1943, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1929-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1929-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

This study addresses the quantification and estimation of the watershed-characteristic-related parameter (Pw) in the Budyko framework with the principle of hydrologically similar groups. The results show that Pw is closely related to soil moisture and fractional vegetation cover, and the relationship varies across specific hydrologic similarity groups. The overall satisfactory performance of the Pw estimation model improves the applicability of the Budyko framework for global runoff estimation.

Reconstructing five decades of sediment export from two glacierized high-alpine catchments in Tyrol, Austria, using nonparametric regression

Lena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, Christoph Mayer, and Axel Bronstert

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1841–1863, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1841-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1841-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

We present a suitable method to reconstruct sediment export from decadal records of hydroclimatic predictors (discharge, precipitation, temperature) and shorter suspended sediment measurements. This lets us fill the knowledge gap on how sediment export from glacierized high-alpine areas has responded to climate change. We find positive trends in sediment export from the two investigated nested catchments with step-like increases around 1981 which are linked to crucial changes in glacier melt.

Water and energy budgets over hydrological basins on short and long timescales

Samantha Petch, Bo Dong, Tristan Quaife, Robert P. King, and Keith Haines

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1723–1744, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1723-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1723-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Gravitational measurements of water storage from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) can improve understanding of the water budget. We produce flux estimates over large river catchments based on observations that close the monthly water budget and ensure consistency with GRACE on short and long timescales. We use energy data to provide additional constraints and balance the long-term energy budget. These flux estimates are important for evaluating climate models.

Hydrological response to climate change and human activities in the Three-River Source Region

Ting Su, Chiyuan Miao, Qingyun Duan, Jiaojiao Gou, Xiaoying Guo, and Xi Zhao

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1477–1492, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1477-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1477-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

The Three-River Source Region (TRSR) plays an extremely important role in water resources security and ecological and environmental protection in China and even all of Southeast Asia. This study used the variable inï¬ltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrologic model linked with the degree-day factor algorithm to simulate the runoff change in the TRSR. These results will help to guide current and future regulation and management of water resources in the TRSR.

Short summary

Short summary

We advance our understanding of including information derived from environmental tracers into hydrological modeling. We present a simple approach that integrates streamflow observations and tracer-derived streamflow contributions for model parameter estimation. We consider multiple observed streamflow components and their variation over time to quantify the impact of their inclusion for streamflow prediction at the catchment scale.

Short summary

This study examines, for the first time, the potential of various machine learning models in streamflow prediction over the Sutlej River basin (rainfall-dominated zone) in western Himalaya during the period 2041–2070 (2050s) and 2071–2100 (2080s) and its relationship to climate variability. The mean ensemble of the model results shows that the mean annual streamflow of the Sutlej River is expected to rise between the 2050s and 2080s by 0.79 to 1.43 % for SSP585 and by 0.87 to 1.10 % for SSP245.

Short summary

Short summary

This paper uses remote sensing data from ICESat-2 to calibrate a 1D hydraulic model. With the model, we can make estimations of discharge and water surface elevation, which are important indicators in flooding risk assessment. ICESat-2 data give an added value, thanks to the 0.7 m resolution, which allows the measurement of narrow river streams. In addition, ICESat-2 provides measurements on the river dry portion geometry that can be included in the model.

Short summary

Short summary

In some watersheds, the severity of the dry season has a large impact on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we design a way to predict, about 5 months in advance, how severe the dry season will be in a rural watershed in northern California. This early warning can support seasonal adaptive management. To predict these two values, we assess data about snow, rain, groundwater, and river flows. We find that maximum snowpack and total wet season rainfall best predict dry season severity.

Hydrological modeling using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool in urban and peri-urban environments: the case of Kifisos experimental subbasin (Athens, Greece)

Evgenia Koltsida, Nikos Mamassis, and Andreas Kallioras

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 917–931, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-917-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-917-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Daily and hourly rainfall observations were inputted to a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model to investigate the impacts of rainfall temporal resolution on a discharge simulation. Results indicated that groundwater flow parameters were more sensitive to daily time intervals, and channel routing parameters were more influential for hourly time intervals. This study suggests that the SWAT model appears to be a reliable tool to predict discharge in a mixed-land-use basin.

Revised manuscript accepted for HESS

Short summary

Short summary

This study used the relationship between river water and air temperature to understand processes causing stream warming and predict how streams might respond to future climate warming. We found that the air-water relationship was diverse across sites and controlled largely by geology and snowmelt. Our findings can be used to inform strategies for river basin restoration and conservation, such as identifying climate insensitive areas of the basin that should be preserved and protected.

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 495–499, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-495-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-495-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

An important hydrological issue is to identify components of streamflow that react to precipitation with different degrees of attenuation and delay. From the multitude of methods that have been developed for this so-called hydrograph separation, a specific, frequently used one is singled out here. It is shown to be derived from plausible physical principles. This increases confidence in its results.

A comprehensive open-source course for teaching applied hydrological modelling in Central Asia

Beatrice Sabine Marti, Aidar Zhumabaev, and Tobias Siegfried

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 319–330, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-319-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-319-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Numerical modelling is often used for climate impact studies in water resources management. It is, however, not yet highly accessible to many students of hydrology in Central Asia. One big hurdle for new learners is the preparation of relevant data prior to the actual modelling. We present a robust, open-source workflow and comprehensive teaching material that can be used by teachers and by students for self study.

Short summary

Short summary

Patchy snow cover during spring impacts mountainous ecosystems on a large range of spatio-temporal scales. A hydrological model simulated such snow patchiness at 10 m resolution. Slope and orientation controls precipitation, radiation, and wind generate differences in snowmelt, subsurface storage, streamflow, and evapotranspiration. The snow patchiness increases the duration of the snowmelt to stream and subsurface storage, which sustains the plants and streamflow later in the summer.

Technical note: Extending the SWAT model to transport chemicals through tile and groundwater flow

Hendrik Rathjens, Jens Kiesel, Michael Winchell, Jeffrey Arnold, and Robin Sur

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 159–167, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-159-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-159-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

The SWAT model can simulate the transport of water-soluble chemicals through the landscape but neglects the transport through groundwater or agricultural tile drains. These transport pathways are, however, important to assess the amount of chemicals in streams. We added this capability to the model, which significantly improved the simulation. The representation of all transport pathways in the model enables watershed managers to develop robust strategies for reducing chemicals in streams.

Short summary

Short summary

We produced a daily 0.1° dataset of precipitation, soil moisture, and snow water equivalent in 1981–2017 across China via reconstructions. The dataset used global background data and local on-site data as forcing input and satellite-based data as reconstruction benchmarks. This long-term high-resolution national hydrological dataset is valuable for national investigations of hydrological processes.

Disentangling scatter in long-term concentrationâdischarge relationships: the role of event types

Felipe A. Saavedra, Andreas Musolff, Jana von Freyberg, Ralf Merz, Stefano Basso, and Larisa Tarasova

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6227–6245, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6227-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6227-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

Nitrate contamination of rivers from agricultural sources is a challenge for water quality management. During runoff events, different transport paths within the catchment might be activated, generating a variety of responses in nitrate concentration in stream water. Using nitrate samples from 184 German catchments and a runoff event classification, we show that hydrologic connectivity during runoff events is a key control of nitrate transport from catchments to streams in our study domain.

Short summary

This study addresses the issue of increasing interest in the hydrological impacts of converting cropland to perennial forage cover in the Canadian Prairies. By developing customized models using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform, this long-term (1992–2013) modelling study is expected to provide stakeholders with science-based information regarding the hydrological impacts of land use conversion from annual crop to perennial forage cover in the Canadian Prairies.

How can we benefit from regime information to make more effective use of long short-term memory (LSTM) runoff models?

Reyhaneh Hashemi, Pierre Brigode, Pierre-AndrÃ© Garambois, and Pierre Javelle

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5793–5816, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5793-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5793-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

Hydrologists have long dreamed of a tool that could adequately predict runoff in catchments. Data-driven long short-term memory (LSTM) models appear very promising to the hydrology community in this respect. Here, we have sought to benefit from traditional practices in hydrology to improve the effectiveness of LSTM models. We discovered that one LSTM parameter has a hydrologic interpretation and that there is a need to increase the data and to tune two parameters, thereby improving predictions.

On the value of satellite remote sensing to reduce uncertainties of regional simulations of the Colorado River

Mu Xiao, Giuseppe Mascaro, Zhaocheng Wang, Kristen M. Whitney, and Enrique R. Vivoni

Short summary

Short summary

As the major water resource in the southwestern United States, the Colorado River is experiencing decreases in naturalized streamflow and is predicted to face severe challenges under future climate scenarios. Here, we demonstrate the value of Earth observing satellites to improve and build confidence in the spatiotemporal simulations from regional hydrologic models for assessing the sensitivity of the Colorado River to climate change and supporting regional water managers.
