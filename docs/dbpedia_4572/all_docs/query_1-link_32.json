        "meta_description": "Abstract Since 2002, the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, later in partnership with the Climate Prediction Center, has issued an ENSO prediction product informally called the ENSO prediction plume. Here, measures to improve the reliability and usability of this product are investigated, including bias and amplitude corrections, the multimodel ensembling method, formulation of a probability distribution, and the format of the issued product. Analyses using a subset of the current set of plume models demonstrate the necessity to correct individual models for mean bias and, less urgent, also for amplitude bias, before combining their predictions. The individual ensemble members of all models are weighted equally in combining them to form a multimodel ensemble mean forecast, because apparent model skill differences, when not extreme, are indistinguishable from sampling error when based on a sample of 30 cases or less. This option results in models with larger ensemble numbers being weighted relatively more heavily. Last, a decision is made to use the historical hindcast skill to determine the forecast uncertainty distribution rather than the models’ ensemble spreads, as the spreads may not always reproduce the skill-based uncertainty closely enough to create a probabilistically reliable uncertainty distribution. Thus, the individual model ensemble members are used only for forming the models’ ensemble means and the multimodel forecast mean. In other situations, the multimodel member spread may be used directly. The study also leads to some new formats in which to more effectively show both the mean ENSO prediction and its probability distribution.",

        "text": "c. Ensemble spread: Useful or not?\n\nIdeally, for any given single forecast, the standard deviation of the forecasts of the members of an individual model should indicate the uncertainty in the forecast. Much research has been done exploring the degree to which ensemble spreads provide realistic estimates of forecast uncertainty (e.g., Hamill et al. 2004; Schubert et al. 2008), and while results have been somewhat inconclusive, they have suggested at most a weak relationship, particularly for weather-aggregative (e.g., weekly to seasonal) time scales.\n\nIn our analyses, we find that the spreads of the individual models do remain approximately constant from year to year for given target month/lead time combinations. More revealing, however, is that different models have differing relationships between their mean ensemble spreads and the uncertainties implied by their respective average hindcast-based skills. Specifically, some models have spreads that are usually too small considering the uncertainty associated with their expected skill, while other models have spreads more appropriate for their expected skill. Figure 6 shows the ratio of ensemble spread to the skill-based SEE for each of the NMME models. The CFSv2 model generally has an approximate equivalence between ensemble spread and SEE. The CMC2 and GFDL models also have this favorable correspondence between spread and SEE, but only for some of the target months and lead times. Otherwise, in the case of the other three models (CCSM3, CMC1, and NASA), the spreads are more pervasively smaller than the hindcast skill-based SEE.\n\nThe forecast amplitude correction, discussed in section 3b above, should be applied to the ensemble mean forecasts of an individual model, and not to the individual ensemble members whose amplitudes are expected to be larger. Because amplitude adjustments to ensemble means are usually decreases rather than increases, when applied to individual members they make an often already too small spread (e.g., Fig. 6) even smaller (not shown). A correction for the individual members should just translate the members’ deviations from the original ensemble mean forecast to the amplitude-corrected mean by adding the difference between the latter and the former means. The preserved deviations about the corrected ensemble mean could then be adjusted by multiplying by the factor making the members’ interannual standard deviation equal SEE—a factor that would most often exceed unity.7\n\nFigure 7 shows the ratio of the spread of all members of all models about the multimodel ensemble mean to the SEE of the NMME over the hindcast period, under conditions of 1) no corrections, 2) bias corrections for all members of each of the individual models, and 3) bias and amplitude corrections for all members of each of the individual models.8 The ratio for the uncorrected forecasts shows too large a spread, due to significant uncorrected biases that differ among the models. A plume showing such a collection of uncorrected forecasts typically features relatively tightly clustered members within individual models, but comparatively widely differing central locations of the forecasts by one model versus another. This situation gives rise to a plume of ensemble means that vary considerably even during times of high expected ENSO forecast skill, such as that illustrated in Fig. 1, and implies larger forecast uncertainty than actually exists.\n\nFollowing individual model bias corrections the spread/SEE ratio for the NMME decreases toward unity, although the spread of forecasts for boreal spring target months remains at higher than ideal levels, likely because of inflated ensemble mean amplitudes during the northern spring predictability barrier, a time of longstanding difficulty in ENSO prediction (e.g., Barnston et al. 1999; Jin et al. 2008) but not fully acknowledged by the models as a time of low signal-to-noise ratio. The inflated amplitudes of ensemble mean forecasts of some of the models cause inflated forecast spread for this challenging target season because the ensemble mean forecasts of some models diverge from one another by large amounts, a situation similar to that caused by differing uncorrected model biases.\n\nWhen the forecasts of individual models are corrected for both mean bias and amplitude bias, applying the ensemble mean amplitude correction to the individual members of each as well (a practice not recommended for an individual model considered alone, as discussed above), ratios of spread to SEE decrease further and average slightly lower than unity as a result of some leads and target months having too small a spread (e.g., forecasts for June for the second lead time have a ratio of 0.68, and some of the very longest lead forecasts have ratios below 0.5). This result shows many seasons/leads with acceptable ratios, despite the spreads about the ensemble means of individual models tending to be too small (Fig. 6), and usually even smaller following amplitude bias correction. The NMME ratios may average close to unity, with some seasons/leads deviating somewhat in either direction, because of remaining differences in the ensemble mean forecasts of individual models, even after bias and the amplitude corrections that are usually damping. These differences may represent legitimate forecast “differences in opinion” among models, which may remain substantial because of the different physical representations (representing uncertainty) among the models. In other words, the final result may be acceptable because of the offsetting influences of two (possibly related, as both may be based on the signal-to-noise ratio) model flaws: 1) too small a spread in most of the individual models, particularly after applying an amplitude correction to individual members that is intended for the ensemble mean, and 2) too much “difference in opinion” among bias-corrected model ensemble means due to the unique details of the model physics leading to unique errors. The final ratios would likely be larger if the individual ensemble members were not subjected to the amplitude correction using (2), but rather by adding a constant to the members’ forecasts equaling the corrected ensemble mean minus the original ensemble mean for the given model.\n\nWhen spread/SEE ratios do not approximate unity, a viable alternative to estimating forecast uncertainty by using the ensemble member spreads directly (following the above-mentioned adjustments) is to use the uncertainty distribution that is statistically derived from the NMME hindcast skill, using the standard error of estimate (SEE) as in (5). In this case the only error in the uncertainty estimation would come from estimating hindcast skill on the basis of the finite sample of cases (29 years here). Let us briefly consider the pros and cons to selecting this alternative approach.\n\nFirst, to weigh the acceptability and desirability of using SEE instead of the NMME’s ensemble spread to estimate forecast uncertainty in the case of the current ENSO forecasts, we ask whether the deviations from unity in the ratios shown in Fig. 7 are statistically significant, or if they could have arisen because of sampling variability even if the true underlying ratio is unity. If we cannot reject the hypothesis that the true ratio is unity, then we lack evidence that the forecast system is not acceptably calibrated.9 For any individual cell in Fig. 7, the F distribution can be used to determine a confidence interval straddling unity for the spread/SEE ratio, given the sample sizes for the number of ensemble members in the NMME spread (n = 72 for lead times of 9 months or less) and the number of years contributing to SEE (n = 29). The resulting 90% confidence interval for the ratio is 0.76 to 1.32, indicating a moderately wide range of possibilities when the true ratio is unity. Within the first 9 months of lead time, 14 cells have a ratio outside of this interval, where 11 would be expected on average by chance. An analytic assessment of collective statistical significance (field significance) across all 108 cells requires knowledge of the number of degrees of freedom provided in the combined target season and lead time dimensions; this can also be done empirically using a Monte Carlo approach. An assessment of degrees of freedom for ENSO forecasts by the CFSv1 and CFSv2 models was conducted previously (Barnston and Tippett 2013), where the set of 12 target seasons and the first 9 lead times (108 cells) were estimated to provide only 2.9 times as many degrees of freedom as a single cell in Fig. 7.10 Multiplying the number of years (29) by 2.9 and assessing the number of excursions outside of the 90% confidence interval among the 108 individual cell ratios in Fig. 7, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the true underlying ratio of spread to SEE is unity in the NMME forecasts derived from the six models used here. We therefore conclude that the ratios here do not differ statistically from unity.\n\nThese significance diagnostics imply that the NMME ensemble spreads may be used directly to form the forecast uncertainty estimates for our multimodel forecasts. However, the ratio of spread to SEE might have been statistically different from unity if a different set of individual models had been used, such as a set that omits CFSv2 and either one of CMC2 or GFDL. (In fact, the ratios appear to be substantially less than unity for leads greater than 10 months, where CFSv2 is not included.) The addition of more models could also alter the resulting NMME ratios of spread to SEE. When spread/SEE ratios are not in the neighborhood of unity, either overall or for specific target seasons or lead times, the spreads may not be able to be taken literally to best estimate the uncertainty of their forecasts. There are examples showing that some of today’s leading models still have calibration needs (e.g., Goddard et al. 2013), not just for forecast mean and amplitude but also for ensemble spread, and the use of SEE to represent forecast uncertainty ensures such calibration.\n\nWhen SEE rather than the spread is used to determine the uncertainty envelope, the individual member forecasts still have value in forming the individual model ensemble means, following bias correction, as they contribute skill to the MME mean forecast, and the more contributing members, the better the ensemble mean reflects the forecast signal. The multimodel ensemble mean has been shown to yield greater average deterministic and probabilistic skill, leading to better value, than the most skillful individual model (e.g., Tippett and Barnston 2008; Kirtman et al. 2014). Probabilistic reliability is one aspect of forecast value, as the probability distribution is often just as important to user needs as the best-guess single deterministic forecast. Toward providing the most reliable and useful probability distribution, it is safe practice (assuming an adequate sample of hindcasts, e.g., at least 30 years) to generate the uncertainty distribution on the basis of the historical hindcast skill of the multimodel system. Instances of a lack of realism of individual model ensemble spread may be a result of an unrealistic model signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., Becker et al. 2014). The use of SEE in describing the uncertainty distribution is commonly embedded in regression-based statistical prediction methodologies (e.g., Shongwe et al. 2006); and a symmetric, Gaussian distribution is often assumed. The Gaussian is a reasonable approximation for the distributions of tropical Pacific Ocean SST in the Niño-3.4 region (Chiodi and Harrison 2009), but not for SSTs farther east (which have positive skewness) or farther west (negative skewness).\n\nAt present, we intend to use SEE for the uncertainty distribution for this improved ENSO prediction plume, unless we find clearly favorable spread/SEE ratios in the larger (currently unknown) set of models to be used. However, depending on the individual case, either approach may be justified. We expect that in the future, dynamical model physics and engineering issues associated with model forecast runs (e.g., initialization, numerics, computer power) will be improved to the point where model spreads will routinely be relied upon as direct indicators of forecast uncertainty. It is desirable to use the ensemble member distribution because the individual members contain the physics, and so ideally they could be used to identify the physical sources of uncertainty and could be trusted in cases of unique forecast probability distributions such as bimodal or highly skewed ones as seen occasionally even in forecasts of a 3-month mean climate or ENSO state."
