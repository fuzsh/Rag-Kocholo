        "text": "\"Unveiling New Insights into Arctic and Boreal Landscapes\" üõ∞ üåé Is it possible to retrieve data on ground permittivity and vegetation optical depth over snow-covered areas during winter across Arctic and boreal landscapes? The answer holds the key to unlocking a deeper understanding of land-atmosphere interactions, including freeze-thaw dynamics and carbon flux exchanges in these critical environments. üéâ I am thrilled to share that our #latest #research, published in the Journal of Remote Sensing of Environment, titled- \"Global estimates of L-band vegetation optical depth and soil permittivity of snow-covered boreal forests and permafrost landscape using SMAP satellite data\", introduces the Tau-omega-snow (TO snow) emission model. üöÄ This emission model simulates L-band microwave emission in the soil‚Äìsnow‚Äìvegetation continuum, enabling the retrieval of vegetation optical depth (VOD) and ground permittivity over snow-covered areas. üöÄ By leveraging SMAP satellite data, we've developed a global dataset that promises to significantly enhance our knowledge of wintertime carbon fluxes. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with such accomplished scholars. My heartfelt thanks go to my advisor, Dr. Ardeshir Ebtehaj, as well as Dr. Mike Schwank, Xiaojun Li, and Jean Pierre Wigneron, for their invaluable guidance and insights throughout this research journey. If you're interested in learning more about our findings and their implications, I'd be delighted to discuss further details. #RemoteSensing #SMAP #satellite #Lband #snow #Arctic #Boreal #CarbonExchange #EarthObservation #Tau-#Omega-#Snow #EmissionModel\n\nI would like to invite you to read our latest scientific report titled \"Long-Term Evolution of Significant Wave Height in the Eastern Tropical Atlantic between 1940 and 2022 Using the ERA5 Dataset\" Summary: Studies on the variability in ocean wave climate provide engineers and policymakers with information to plan, develop, and control coastal and offshore activities. Ocean waves bear climatic imprints through which the global climate system can be better understood. Using the recently updated ERA5 dataset, this study evaluated the spatiotemporal distribution and variability in significant wave height (SWH) in the Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETA). The short-term trends and rates of change were obtained using the Mann‚ÄìKendall trend test and the Theil‚ÄìSen slope estimator, respectively, and decadal trends were assessed using wavelet transformation. Significant, positive monthly and yearly trends and a prevailing decadal trend were observed across the domain. Observed trends suggest that stronger waves are getting closer to the coast and are modulated by the Southern and Northern Atlantic mid-latitude storm fields. These observations have implications for the increasing coastal erosion rates on the eastern coast of the Tropical Atlantic.

Overall, continental water volumes vary so much over time that global sea levels fluctuate significantly too. By combining the hydrological model WaterGAP with #GRACE satellite data, a team of geodesists at the University of Bonn have come up with a new set of data that shows how the total distribution of water over the Earth's land surfaces has changed over the past 20 years more accurately than ever before. Their findings (https://lnkd.in/eDt8PXEV) are now being published in the Journal of Geodesy. \"The new method allows us to test out model calculations on the future effects of climate change, particularly how rising temperatures and changes in #precipitation patterns will impact the #waterbalance in different parts of the world,\" says Prof. Dr.-Ing. J√ºrgen Kusche from the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation at the University of Bonn. The process involves comparing #climatemodels, which invariably cover a certain period of time in the past, with the results of actual measurements, and Kusche and his team are planning several such studies over the coming months. The improved resolution that the team has achieved shows that #droughts are significantly more common across the world than the GRACE satellite data would suggest in isolation. \"What we're seeing is that even extensive droughts like the massive one that struck the whole of the Amazon in 2010 are spread across much wider areas than the #satellitedata indicates on its own,\" Kusche says. \"This means that the satellites aren't picking up many of the more localized droughts.\" Working together with counterparts from Goethe University Frankfurt and the Polish capital Warsaw, a team of researchers from the University of Bonn has now combined #satellite measurements with high-resolution #meteorologicaldata for the first time. \"What's special about this method is that it's enabled us to improve the resolution of the #water distribution maps that are generated from around 300 kilometers to 50 kilometers,\" explains Kusche, who is a member of the Modelling and Sustainable Futures Transdisciplinary Research Areas and the Regional #ClimateChange Collaborative Research Center at the University of Bonn. To do so, the researchers used the \"#WaterGAP\" hydrological model developed at Goethe University Frankfurt plus a mathematical technique borrowed from weather forecasting... #dataassimilation #global #glws #grace-fo Continue reading\n\nClimate change and landslides \"Climate change is having a profound impact on our planet, and one of the most visible effects is the increase in landslides. According to a recent study by NASA, climate change is driving more volatile precipitation patterns around the world, which can affect slow-moving landslides in unanticipated ways. Geologists are working to better understand how landslides react to record drought or extreme rainfall so that they can better predict their future behavior and develop strategies to protect vulnerable areas. As we continue to grapple with the effects of climate change, it‚Äôs important to remember that we all have a role to play in mitigating its impact. By working together and taking action to reduce our carbon footprint, we can help protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. https://lnkd.in/dSWShHPg https://lnkd.in/dHkgN6X3 #climatechange #landslides #sustainability #geology #geologist #engineering_geology\n\nHYDROLOGY: University of Washington study improves understanding of #snow sublimation In a study published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, a team of scientists has filled longstanding gaps in the process of #sublimation ‚Äì the process by which snow transforms directly from a solid (snow) to a gas (water vapor). The research was led by Jessica Lundquist at the University of Washington, with co-authors at the University of Washington, Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) NSF NCAR - The National Center for Atmospheric Research. It was based on observations taken during the 2022-2023 Sublimation of Snow Project, in which scientists used a battery of instruments to collect data on wind speed, snowfall and blowing snow at a site outside Crested Butte, #Colorado. ‚ÄúThese findings are really important for our ability to model the amount and timing of runoff for seasonal forecasts and future climate projections,‚Äù said NSF NCAR scientist Ethan Gutmann, a co-author of the study. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt understand the processes that control historical runoff, we cannot be as confident in our predictions.‚Äù Read more here: https://lnkd.in/eYXfR9AT #Meteorology #Climate #ClimateChange #Science #Weather #Data #Forecasts #Environment #Technology #MetTechExpo #MetTechExpoNA\n\nGLOBAL WARMING on STEROIDS: -The Batagay MEGASLUMP- The Batagay megaslump is not only a prominent local feature of rapid permafrost thaw, but offers excellent conditions to study rates and mechanisms of rapid permafrost degradations and to calculate the stock and release of, e.g., organic matter. The Batagay \"crater‚Äù emerges from a pre-existing hillslope ravine first recognized on satellite imagery of 1991 (Kunitsky et al., 2013). Since then, average headwall retreat rates have been calculated for different sections of the feature, reaching 7 to 15 m per year (in 2004‚Äì2010; Kunitsky et al., 2013), 11.3 to 14.9 m per year (in 1991‚Äì2018; recalculated from area loss data given in Vadakkedath et al., 2020) and even up to 30 m per year (G√ºnther et al., 2016). Additionally a few studies have been carried out to project the RTS's further growth (Matchitov et al., 2022). Previous results of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey and of laboratory data on ice and sediment composition obtained in 2019 allowed a characterization of the volumetric ice content distribution of the exposed cryolithological horizons in the largely vertical RTS headwalls and to identify the main morphological features of the landforms on the RTS floor as well as the headwall's morphology (Kizyakov et al., 2023). The study of the Batagay RTS provides insights into drivers and processes of rapid permafrost thaw possibly predefined by cryolithological (permafrost) properties such as ice content, horizon thickness, and material parameters, which control the morphology and the expansion (headwall retreat) rates of the RTS. https://lnkd.in/gK6EBFEE.\n\nüì£ NEW ARTICLE from Big Earth Dataüì£ üëâ The first 10 m resolution thermokarst lake and pond dataset for the Lena Basin in the 2020 thawing season üë• Yining Yu, Fengming Hui, Yu Zhou, Chong Liu & Xiao Cheng üîó https://lnkd.in/geYvp6pS #Climate warming rates in the #Arctic are far greater than the global average, exerting stronger impacts on #permafrost degradation and #thermokarst landform development. Thermokarst lakes and ponds (TLPs), which are widely distributed in the #LenaBasin in the Russian Arctic, play a vital role in altering local ecosystem. However, the detailed distribution of TLPs in the Lena Basin still remains poorly known. In this study, we built the first 10 m resolution TLP #dataset for the Lena Basin in the 2020 thawing season by utilizing 4902 #Sentinel2 images. A robust mapping workflow was developed and implemented in the #GoogleEarthEngine (#GEE) platform. The accuracy assessment demonstrates a satisfactory accuracy (93.63%), and our results exhibit a better consistency with real TLPs than global water body products. A total of 380,477 TLPs (~0.53% of the total surface area of the Lena Basin) were identified, showing an uneven distribution in the five sub-basins. The TLPs were found to be mainly located within plain areas, with an active layer thickness in the range of 80‚Äì100 cm. The higher ground #ice content and mean annual ground temperature were favorable for TLP development. This dataset will be valuable for investigating the complex interaction between TLPs and permafrost. It will also serve as a baseline product for better incorporating thermokarst processes into permafrost-climate models. #bigearthdata #digitalearth #geoscience #remotesensing #earthobservation #GIS #dataanalysis #BigData #geoinformation #dataanalytics #geoinformatics #geospatialdata #polarregions #climatechange #lake #water #snow"
