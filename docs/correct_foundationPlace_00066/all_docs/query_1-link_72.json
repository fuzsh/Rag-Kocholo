        "text": "Xero migrated from a managed service provider to AWS cloud and in doing so, had to understand how to take ownership and responsibility of the things they do.\n\nDuring the migration, they used workshops, seminars, webinars, public and on-site instructor-led training with AWS to understand how to migrate effectively and securely.\n\nAlong the way they learned some important lessons about how to succeed with AWS cloud, whether you are an organisation or IT professional…\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING\n\nXero came to understand that innovation and change at speed requires the right insight.\n\nIt’s key to understand the best practices and how to learn from them.\n\nHaving comprehensive training is one of the fundamental pillars in understanding how you’ll scale effectively.\n\nTraining enabled Xero to work quickly without sacrificing reliability or security\n\nAdditionally, it was vital that their employees understood what they were doing and how they were doing it\n\n…and the key to that is having the right type of knowledge and certifications.\n\n2. TRUST\n\nAWS certifications enabled Xero to have a strong confidence and trust in the way they do things in the AWS cloud.\n\nCertification is now their principle model of trust and ownership of things in the cloud because with certifications, they can trust their decisions.\n\nTom Britton, Team Lead – Security at Xero recommends AWS training and certification when doing migrations.\n\nHe says…\n\n“AWS certification has been a really strong way of getting my team to understand that there is real value in these certifications and that they are really useful for doing their day-to-day work”"
