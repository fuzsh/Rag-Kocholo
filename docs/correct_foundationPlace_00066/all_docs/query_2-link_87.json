It is his first software-as-a-service investment since stepping down from the top job at the accounting software giant in 2018.\n\nMr Drury, who has spent most of his time since Xero engaged in philanthropic endeavours in New Zealand and working with the Queenstown local government on pandemic response projects, said he had no interest in building another software company, but that Atomic caught his attention, having been founded by a group of early Xero employees."
