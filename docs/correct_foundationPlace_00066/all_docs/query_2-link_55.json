        "text": "Who should read this guide?\n\nThis article will teach you how to automate Airbnb trust accounting using Xero, including the workflows that surround Airbnb property managers who use a trust account to collect funds from Airbnb on behalf of owners. This guide can be used as a general foundation for property managers who need to follow state or local requirements in regards to trust accounting. A trust account in this context is a bank account provided by a financial institution that is used by real estate brokers and licensed property managers to manage funds on behalf of the property owners they service.\n\nIn this guide, we assume that you have Xero accounting software and all monies collected by Airbnb are transferred directly to the trust bank account. We also assume that you have a separate bank account for your day-to-day business operations.\n\nUSING QUICKBOOKS? READ THIS ARTICLE INSTEAD\n\nNOTE: We only cover income accounting in this guide, not costs. For a guide about Airbnb costs and chart of accounts to consider, check out this guide: Airbnb Costs and Chart of Accounts to Consider\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat you’ll get from this guide:\n\nA template for Xero with detailed chart of accounts for Airbnb trust accounting\n\nLearn how to automate Airbnb trust accounting with Bnbtally\n\nExecute common transaction workflows in Xero\n\nGenerate monthly owner statements and reports for your clients\n\nCash Flow Diagram\n\nWho should not read this guide?\n\nThere are other business models that may be more suitable in your particular scenario, which are covered better in the following guides:\n\nAirbnb Property Management Accounting using Xero\n\nAirbnb Co-Host Accounting in Xero\n\nAirbnb Arbitrage Accounting in Xero\n\nAirbnb Investment Accounting in Xero\n\nAll Airbnb templates for Xero\n\nAirbnb Accounting & Bookkeeping: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nTrust Accounting vs Accounting for your Business\n\nWhat is fiduciary duty? Fiduciary duty is a legal term that means you are acting in the best interest of another person or organization. As part of trust accounting, property managers serve a fiduciary responsibility when they are handling owner funds within a trust account. This requires them to provide auditable records for the sake of transparency in their use of owner funds.\n\nMany jurisdictions have requirements around managing the accounting and reporting of trust accounts. However, even if your state has no requirements, it’s still a good practice to act as though such requirements exist. This is because of the transparency that trust accounting provides, which owners love transparency.\n\nWhen you are operating a business that manages a trust account, you are essentially accounting for two entities within the business: 1.) Accounting for the Trust Account and 2.) Accounting for your Property Management Business.\n\nThree-Way Trust Reconciliation for Trust Accounting\n\nThe proper reconciliation process for Airbnb trust accounting is known as the three-way trust reconciliation process. This means there are three components that have balances that must be equal when reconciling. These three components are as follows: the trust ledger, the stakeholder ledgers, and the trust bank statement (Source)\n\nThe trust ledger: This is a ledger of all the transactions of the trust account, which will be recorded in Xero. In our chart of accounts template, the trust ledger is the sum of all accounts that start with the words “Trust Account Liability” (all codes starting with 23xxxx).\n\nThe stakeholder ledgers: The stakeholder ledgers are created by taking the trust ledger a step further, assigning each transaction to a specific stakeholder and grouping together all the trust account activity associated with each individual stakeholder. In our chart of accounts template, under our trust ledger (Trust Account Liability), we separate two primary stakeholders, Owner Funds and Property Mgmt Funds. We’ll also make use of tracking categories in Xero to further separate funds between each of our owners.\n\nThe trust bank statement: This is generated by the bank where the trust account is held and it provides third party verification of the transactions posted to the trust account.\n\nDuring reconciliation, the trust bank statement balance should match both the trust ledger and the sum of all stakeholder ledger balances – this is the reason it’s called “three-way reconciliation.”\n\nAccounting for your Property Mangement Business\n\nIn addition to reconciling the trust ledger and each stakeholder ledgers, the property manager also needs to reconcile their own company ledgers. Property management funds are held in the trust account and are eventually paid from the trust bank account to the property manager’s operating bank account. Accordingly, in our template, you’ll notice three main sections: Trust Account Assets, Trust Account Liabilities and Property Mgmt Revenues. Respectively:\n\nTrust Account Assets: This is the sum of accounts that start with “Trust Account Asset”, which tracks what’s owed to the property management company from the trust account and should always match the Property Mgmt Funds total within Trust Account Liability.\n\nTrust Account Liabilities: This is the trust ledger discussed above.\n\nProperty Mgmt Revenues: This keeps track of all earnings of the property management company derived from the trust account.\n\nAirbnb Trust Accounting: Xero Chart of Accounts Template\n\nHere we’ll explain the chart of accounts template provided by Bnbtally (by Tallylytics) in great detail.\n\nAccount Codes\n\nNOTE: In this guide, we only cover income accounting, not costs. For a guide about Airbnb costs and chart of accounts to consider, check out this guide instead: Airbnb Costs and Chart of Accounts to Consider\n\nDetailed Explanation of Accounts\n\nClick to expand and learn more about any particular account.\n\nAccounts not included in this template\n\nFor the scope of this guide, we’re mainly focused on Airbnb revenue recognition and movements within the trust account. It is important to point out that our template does not include many general accounts. We also make reference to some accounts not include in this particular template, which we’ll list here:\n\n11000 – Airbnb Payment Clearing Account – This account is created by Bnbtally (by Tallylytics) but is not included in this template in particular. This account is used to apply payments to Airbnb invoices upon the day the Airbnb reservation payout is posted. Payouts can take 3-5 days (or longer) to arrive in the bank account after posted from Airbnb. Monies owed are held in this clearing account until the payouts are received in the bank. This account also helps to automate the reconciliation process in Xero.\n\n1XXXX – Trust Bank Account – This is a bank account set up with your financial institution for funds held in trust. It’s a cash asset account solely for the management of owner funds as part of the three-way reconciliation process.\n\n1XXXX – Operations Bank Account – This is a separate bank account set up with your financial institution. It’s a cash asset account to facilitate your Airbnb property management company’s day-to-day business operations.\n\n4XXXX – Billable Expenses Income – This is a general account for capturing income received for the payment of billable expenses by owners, which may include a markup.\n\n7XXXX – Billable Expenses – This is a general account for tracking billable expenses for any owners.\n\nHow to Automate Airbnb Trust Accounting with Bnbtally\n\nBnbtally (by Tallylytics) is a powerful tool that helps property managers track all monies collected by Airbnb. It reconciles all reservations automatically and in great detail, making it easy for you to keep track of trust funds and commissions. Additionally, Bnbtally (by Tallylytics) offers presets so property managers can use trust accounting practices right out of the box. In this section we’ll discuss step-by-step how to set up a seamless automation using the chart of accounts above.\n\nBnbtally (by Tallylytics) establishes a connection between any number of Airbnb and Xero accounts, which therein processes accounting data for each reservation. Here you’ll set specific accounting rules for each listing. When reservations are detected, Bnbtally (by Tallylytics) can generate invoices automatically in Xero with all allocations processed to the trust account, including Airbnb collections, property management commissions, cleaning fee allocations and any other split needed.\n\nBnbtally Listing Presets for Airbnb Trust Accounting\n\nBnbtally (by Tallylytics) makes it easy to manage your listings on Airbnb and Xero. Once connected, you will be guided through the process of setting up trust accounting rules for each listing in just a few clicks. With our presets from our template, you can get started quickly and can customize as needed. These presets can be broken down into three groups: Lines 1-6, Lines 7-10 and Lines 11-14.\n\nExplanation of Preset Lines\n\nClick to expand and learn more about each preset.\n\nIn Bnbtally (by Tallylytics), for each invoice in your listing rules, you’re able to configure a contact. For property managers, we usually recommend to set the owner as the contact. As for tracking categories, it’s a good idea to set both the owner and the listing address as the tracking category. See the example below for further illustration:\n\nAutomate Additional Bills & Invoices (Optional)\n\nWith Bnbtally (by Tallylytics), you’re also able to automate the creation of additional bills and invoices for each reservation. Consider the following:\n\nCreate a bill to set payouts payable to the property owner for each reservation.\n\nCreate a bill to set amounts payable to a tax authority for each reservation.\n\nCreate a bill to set amounts payable to a cleaning service for turnover of each reservation.\n\nCreate additional invoice to set amounts receivable by any third party for each reservation.\n\nExecute Common Transaction Workflows in Xero\n\nIn this section, we describe the common transaction workflows that take place in Xero, as needed for Airbnb trust accounting and property management.\n\nPaying the Property Manager from the Trust Account\n\nCommissions have accumulated and it’s time to pay yourself, the property manager, from the Trust Bank Account. After any additional expenses have been reconciled, you can find the amount owed in your balance sheet under Property Mgmt Funds Payable and Property Mgmt Funds Receivable (both of these account balances should match). See the below example on how to process this transaction:\n\nExample Transaction\n\nYou, the Airbnb property management company, have funds in the Property Mgmt Funds Receivable account in the amount of $9,000 owed by the owner, Jona Bombard for listing 989 Athens Way. You’d like to pay yourself this amount from the trust account.\n\nFirst, you’ll need to transfer the money between the bank accounts at your financial institution. Once the transfer is posted and complete, record the outgoing transaction from the Trust Bank Account with the following entry:\n\nNext, record the incoming transaction to your Operating Bank Account with the following entry:\n\nPaying Owners from the Trust Account\n\nOwner funds have accumulated over the previous month and it’s time to pay owners from the trust account. The amount owed to owners can be found in the balance sheet under “Owner Funds”. Each owner amount can be filtered by selecting the appropriate tracking category. See the example on how to process the payout transaction:\n\nExample Transaction\n\nYou, the Airbnb property management company, are holding funds in the amount of $23,500 for the owner, Jona Bombard, for the listing 989 Athens Way. You’d like to pay this amount to the owner from the trust account as a result of a month-end report.\n\nFirst, you’ll need to send the owner the money via bank transfer, ACH, check or other means. Once the transfer is posted and complete, record the outgoing transaction from the Trust Bank Account using the following entry:\n\nPaying Expenses on Behalf of Owners Directly from the Trust Account\n\nYou likely have a clause in your contract that allows you to purchase items on behalf of the owner, for things like property maintenance, which allows you to pull directly from their funds in the trust account. Before making such a purchase, first you’ll want to make sure the owner has enough funds allocated in their Owner Funds Reserved account. If this is not the case, you’ll want to allocate funds into this account before making the purchase, else you’ll run the risk of commingling funds from other owners within the trust account. Assuming all is well, see the following example on how to perform this transaction:\n\nPaying Expenses on Behalf of Owners from your Operations Bank Account\n\nThere are indeed cases where you may purchase items for the owner’s properties from your property management operations bank account, rather than from the trust account. This may be especially true for smaller maintenance issues that need to be fixed quickly. You can arrange these amounts to be paid back to you after month-end when you report and retrieve the funds back from the trust account. Here’s how such a transaction would work:\n\nRemitting Taxes from the Trust Account\n\nIn many jurisdictions, Airbnb will collect taxes and remit to local tax authorities on the owner’s behalf. However, you can opt to collect these taxes from Airbnb and remit them directly. If you’re using Bnbtally (by Tallylytics), the Custom Taxes line item found in our presets will take care of the allocation of custom taxes for each reservation. This section is about paying the local tax authorities the amounts owed.\n\nGenerate Monthly Owner Statements & Reports in Xero\n\nNow that all Airbnb data has been imported perfectly into Xero, after reconciling any other expenses, you’re able to produce beautiful owner statements and reports each month.\n\nMonthly Owner Statement by Listing\n\nThis statement can be sent to owners every month. It is grouped by tracking category, which means it is focused on displaying activity details on a per listing, per owner basis. This helps owners see their earnings, per listing, in precise detail along with all the movements in and out of the trust account for each listing. Each line created by Bnbtally (by Tallylytics) includes a reservation code and details of the transaction. Finally, a grand total due to the owner is displayed at the bottom.\n\nIn the following example, we’re showing an owner statement for a single owner, Linette Thompson:\n\nConclusion\n\nConsider this a thorough guide to automating the management of other peoples funds with the highest integrity. Just remember that even if you’re not legally required, following trust accounting standards in your property management operations has a positive impact on how your clients view your services. Proper Airbnb trust accounting discussed in this article provides the most transparency to your owners – which is key for maintaining their trust in you and recommending you to others who are looking for similar services.\n\nThe complexity involved in providing such transparency in your accounting is a daunting task that needs automation.
