        "text": "A NEW ODYSSEY IN ACCOUNTING\n\nThe Greeks are no strangers to an Odyssey, but George started one of his own when he uprooted from Greece and moved his family halfway across the world in 2012. “I think the transition has been easier for our boys than for my wife and I.” he says. “They’re younger and they’re surrounded by English-speakers at school every day. They often correct our English – but that’s good, it helps us improve even more!”\n\nWith more than 20 years professional experience as a Dentist, George found that his Greek qualifications weren’t recognized globally, and that re-qualifying would be like pulling teeth – literally. Instead of dealing with the arduous, lengthy, and expensive process of re-qualifying, George decided to take his first tentative steps in a new career.\n\nAt first, George was considering a career in tourism, but considering that “I’m not in my twenties anymore,” and that he had a proven record of business acumen, he instead opted to begin a career in accountancy. Attending polytechnic was not appealing; it was more costly than online learning, and would seriously cut into the hours where George could be earning an income.\n\nSo, he searched online and found The Career Academy’s Certificate in Accounting. From his first phone call, it was obvious George had made the right choice. Amy (his one-on-one student advisor) was patient and kind on the telephone, carefully answering his questions, explaining how online learning would look (you can see it for yourself here), and letting him know he’d be supported every step of the way.\n\nStudying around his temporary job at a fast-food restaurant, George successfully completed the 140 hour course in just seven weeks. George’s online experience at The Career Academy was so good, he decided to take a second course, this time in the Advanced Certificate in Accounting, which expands on the core concepts he learned while studying the Certificate. Ultimately, George has his sights set on becoming an Accounting Technician, and he likely won’t be far away with the certificate’s endorsement by the International Association of Accounting Professionals. The course also includes up to six months access to MYOB and allows students to receive the official Xero Advisor Certification, so George will be well equipped with the tools of the trade.\n\nGeorge’s Odyssey is far from over, but if you want to follow in his footsteps check out the Certificate or Advanced Certificate in Accounting and you can get started immediately."
