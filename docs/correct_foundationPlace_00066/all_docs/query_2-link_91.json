        "text": "Since 2015, we have been investigating the relationship between play and school. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that play supports children’s social, cognitive, emotional, and physical development, and that there is a positive connection between enjoying learning and academic success. But integrating playful practices into school, or embracing play as a strategy for learning, has proven challenging. In part this is due to paradoxes that arise when play and school intersect:\n\nIn play, children are in charge. At school, the adults typically set the agenda.\n\nPlay can be chaotic, messy, and loud. Schools often need to be orderly and quiet.\n\nPlay often involves taking risks. Schools aim to keep children safe.\n\nBoth statements in each bullet above are true, and both statements of each bullet should be honored. These paradoxes are the underpinning of why a pedagogy of play—a whole school approach to examining, discussing, and supporting playful learning and teaching—is critical.\n\nSix Core Principles of Playful Learning\n\nBased on literature reviews of learning and play, insights from educators and researchers around the globe, and practitioner action-research with playful teachers and school leaders in Denmark, South Africa, the U.S., and Colombia, our research team developed six core principles of playful learning:\n\nPlay supports learning\n\nPlayful learning in school requires play with a purpose\n\nParadoxes between play and school add complexity to teaching and learning\n\nPlayful learning is universal yet shaped by culture\n\nPlayful mindsets are central to playful learning\n\nSupportive school cultures enable playful learning to thrive\n\nThese principles form the foundation of a pedagogy of play. You can read more about each principle in our book, linked on the Overview page.\n\nPlayful Learning Indicators\n\nIt is easier to talk about, plan for, and assess playful learning with colleagues who share an understanding of what playful learning means. Together with educators, we co-created working definitions of what playful learning looks and feels like in their own contexts. Through interviews with educators and students, observations, focus groups, study group discussions, and examining documentation of student learning, we developed site-specific, culturally relevant maps of playful learning. If you hover over the points marked on the map below, you can see these Indicators of Playful Learning for each site:\n\nFor each model, playful learning is represented at the intersection of the indicators; in other words, playful learning is likely to occur when all three indicators are present. The models are explored in depth in our working papers. Educators have used these indicators to develop a whole school approach to playful teaching and learning appropriate for their setting. Perhaps not surprisingly (after all, playful learning is universal), the models also share features across contexts. Looking across our four sites, we noticed patterns and developed a cross-cultural model of playful learning indicators.\n\nThe cross-cultural indicators provide a starting point for educators and school communities interested in exploring what playful learning looks and feels like, and how they might foster a pedagogy of play in their school. If you are interested in digging deeper or co-creating your own playful indicators, the Playful Learning Indicator Guide: A Weekly Handbook for Research Teams can be found on the For Educators tab on this website.\n\nPlayful Learning Practices & Strategies\n\nHow can educators set up the conditions where playful learning thrives? Based on extensive classroom observations and interviews across sites, consultations with key thought partners, a review of literature (including related pedagogies such as inquiry and project-based learning), and our own prior research and experiences in the classroom, we identified the following key practices and strategies that support playful learning and teaching across ages and contexts:\n\nPractices Strategies Empower learners to lead their own learning\n\nGet to know your learners\n\nInvolve learners in decision-making\n\nReflect on learning with learners\n\nBuild a culture of collaborative learning\n\nUse play to build relationships\n\nFacilitate purposeful conversations to build knowledge\n\nFoster a culture of feedback\n\nPromote experimentation and risk-taking\n\nDesign open-ended investigations\n\nEncourage risk-taking as a strategy for learning\n\nEncourage imaginative thinking\n\nShare stories to engage and enhance learning\n\nUse role-play and pretend scenarios\n\nProvide materials and experiences that engage the senses and the body\n\nAsk questions that invite curiosity and imaginative thinking\n\nWelcome all emotions generated through play\n\nDesign for joy\n\nUse play to explore complex issues\n\nSupport learners in working through frustration\n\nClick here for an expanded description of these practices and strategies which, along with related tools, can be found on the For Educators tab and in our book.\n\nPlayful Participatory Research\n\nTo promote playful learning for children and older learners, it’s important for the adult learning community to also embody and engage in playful learning. We developed Playful Participatory Research (PPR) as a research and professional development approach for educators to reflect on their playful practice. PPR is a form of action research in which teachers collect data, analyze results, and use the knowledge to develop or deepen playful teaching and learning in their own schools. PPR provides opportunities for teachers to play with ideas, take risks, and explore new possibilities, and it provides school communities the opportunity to come together for conversations about a pedagogy of play. You can read more here about our collaboration with the International School of Billund and the impacts of PPR. If you want to learn more and try PPR in your school, you can find a link to the Playful Participatory Research Guide: An Interactive Workbook on the For Educators tab on this website.\n\nOne of our goals is to help educators—classroom teachers, teacher leaders, and administrators—incorporate more playful teaching and learning into daily practice. Here, we offer specific tools and resources that support a pedagogy of play.\n\nThe Educator Toolbox includes an overview of the playful learning practices and strategies, and eighteen related tools appropriate for all ages and contexts. We invite you to adapt the tools (with integrity!) to fit your needs.\n\nPlayful Learning Classroom Practice PoP Tools Planning for playful teaching and learning\n\nPlayful Learning Practices Overview\n\nPlayful Learning Planner\n\nEmpower learners to lead their own learning\n\nGetting to Know Your Learners\n\nMaking Learning Meaningful\n\nInvolving Learners in Decision-Making\n\nSay Yes to the Mess\n\nLicense to Hack Cards\n\nPlayful Learning Reflection Planner\n\nBuild a culture of collaborative learning\n\nSelecting a Thinking Routine\n\nExpert Books\n\nPromote experimentation and risk-taking\n\nSelecting and Facilitating a Design Challenge\n\nCreating a Culture of Risk-taking\n\nEncourage imaginative thinking\n\nStorytelling and Story Acting for Older Learners\n\nPlay Kits\n\nQuestions Worth Playing With\n\nImaginative Sparks Generator\n\nMoving to Learn\n\nWelcome all emotions generated through play\n\nSupporting Learners with Conflict and Frustration\n\nUsing Play to Explore Complex Issues\n\nWe also offer two guides and accompanying workbooks, designed for educators interested in conducting their own playful research (and research playfully!). The first is the Playful Participatory Research (PPR) Guide: An Interactive Workbook, developed by the Pedagogy of Play research team as a way to support educators’ playful learning. PPR is a type of practitioner inquiry or teacher research—research done by educators. It is a reflective and playful way for members of a learning community to explore learning through play together, through collecting and discussing data, analyzing it together, and applying what is learned. The PPR Guide provides an overview of the process, an interactive workbook to play with, and some additional resources to support the research.\n\nThe Playful Learning Indicator Guide: A Weekly Handbook for Research Teams helps educators co-create their own definition of playful learning. Modelled after the research process of Pedagogy of Play, the guide is helpful for any team of educators interested in better understanding what playful learning looks and feels like in their classrooms and school."
