        "text": "Wellington â 15 May, 2023 âXero, the global small business platform, has today released research from NZIER that reveals a 20% increase in the number of businesses adopting cloud-based business tools in the future could add up to $7.8 billion to Aotearoaâs annual GDP through improved productivity.\n\nâWhile COVID expedited digitalisation rates as Kiwi small businesses swiftly figured out how to run our businesses remotely, there are still phenomenal opportunities for us to take this adoption further. Aotearoa can become a world-leading digital nation and add billions to the economy,â says Snelling.\n\nThe NZIER report recommends a road map for the New Zealand Government to consider for improving the digitalisation of Aotearoa. Key areas of focus in the short term include:\n\nâAfter all, it can be daunting to commit to overhauling all your processes without knowing what the outcome will be. However, the Government can create policy and encourage digitalisation investment to improve our local economy by billions.â\n\nFurther NZIER research recognised there are costs to digitalisation but the payback period for businesses is relatively short, typically less than two to three years before they start seeing an ongoing positive return.\n\nâIn as little as two years we can help rejuvenate the economy, potentially adding billions of dollars through the improved productivity delivered by the increased uptake of digital tools,â says Snelling.\n\nâEconomies around the world are rapidly digitalising and businesses in Aotearoa need to recognise the risk being left behind. The Government needs to do everything it can to support our digital progress. In an election year, this should be a priority for all parties.\n\nXero is a global small business platform with 3.5 million subscribers which includes a core accounting solution, payroll, workforce management, expenses and projects. Xero also has an extensive ecosystem of connected apps and connections to banks and other financial institutions helping small businesses access a range of solutions from within Xeroâs open platform to help them run their business and manage their finances.
