        "text": "Further to the first objective, Xero has outlined Workplace Inclusion Principles for all Xeros to utilize when navigating interpersonal conversations and engagements. We take these expectations seriously and anyone found to have breached them will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, which may include dismissal.\n\nAlong with prioritising reporting on representation, we focus on driving a culture of inclusion that enables everyone to tap into the potential and power of our differences. Inclusion means all Xeros have a sense of belonging and fairness, feel valued and respected, and can play their part in doing the most #beautiful work of their lives.\n\nOur global diversity, inclusion, and belonging program is led by our Head of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging. We report annually on our progress against the measurable objectives for diversity approved by the Xero Board. For information about our progress against our objectives, see our most recent Annual Report.\n\nERGs may be built upon shared characteristics or life experiences that are focused on encouraging an exchange of ideas, promoting a greater sense of belonging and enhancing career and personal development of employees in the workplace.\n\nAt Xero, focusing on gender diversity has always been a priority for us as weâre keen to get more women into the tech sector, ensure we have good female representation across our management levels, and remove any roadblocks to gender equality in all aspects of life at Xero. We know this drives better business outcomes not only for Xero but for our small business partners and customers.\n\nCurrently, 40% of our Xero leadership team (Xero CEO and direct reports) and 44% of our employees are women, and we have three female and five male directors on our Board.\n\nAs part of Xeroâs continuing commitment to gender equality, we are proud to be included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. This inclusion recognises our investment in fostering a more inclusive and equitable workplace.\n\nWe regularly track our diversity data for internal monitoring and accountability. As part of this work, we conduct an annual organisation-wide pay equity review at Xero and communicate results to employees. At the time of our last review in March 2023, our analysis showed that on a like-for-like basis, we are providing equitable salary outcomes when compared to overall median market remuneration.\n\nNote: To calculate our gender pay gap, we review actual total earnings of employees over the past 12 months. We then take the median actual earnings of males, minus the median actual earnings of females, divided by the median actual earnings of males. A weighted average is then used across each region to get to a Xero overall figure.\n\nIn the UK, we are required to submit gender pay gap metrics to the UK government annually. You can read our most recent UK Gender Pay Gap Report which covers the period 5 April 2022 to 5 April 2023 here.\n\nDespite the disruption of Covid-19, we continued our community outreach and engagement program in New Zealand with the aim of increasing gender and ethnic diversity in the early stage pipeline of talent into tech. We shifted many activities online, including creating an online coding adventure for young people aged 9 to 14, co-creating the Trailblazing Women in Tech quiz for girls aged 9 to 13 with the She# team, and supporting our people to participate as mentors in the GirlBoss Edge engineering and technology online career accelerator for high school-aged young women. In 2021, we resumed some in-person activities, such as hosting school student work experience days for young women and Pasifika students, and ShadowTech days for teachers.\n\nWe offer multiple avenues for learning opportunities for our people and people leaders to participate in, increasing the capability for everyone to drive a culture of inclusion within their teams. Below are some of the learning opportunities we offer at Xero to help build inclusion and belonging:\n\nWe're proud to be a member of the Australian Network on Disability (AND). We're also proud to be a Level 2 Disability Confident Employer in the United Kingdom.\n\nAlong with goals focused on the diversity of our candidate pool, we want to ensure all participants experience inclusion throughout the hiring process. To do so, we have launched several new initiatives in the past year:\n\nWeâre committed to increasing the diversity of our workforce and have entered into a number of country-specific partnerships to help us achieve this. Since April 2021 weâve been working with the National Association of Black Accountants (NABA) in the United States. We were proud to sponsor NABAâs 2021 scholarship program, and awarded our first scholarship recipient in October 2021.\n\nIn July 2021 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Association for Advancement of Black Accountants of Southern Africa (ABASA). Weâre joining forces to support the great work theyâve been doing to drive the advancement of black accountants and practices, and encourage future professionals into the industry. This partnership marks our ongoing commitment to create a diverse and thriving accounting industry in South Africa. It follows the launch of our program with First National Bank to mentor and drive digital adoption and skills amongst fast-growing, entrepreneurial black-owned accounting firms.\n\nAt Xero, we want to create a culture of belonging, where differences not only exist but where they are respected, supported and fully celebrated. Itâs about ensuring our people can be their authentic self, and flourish in an environment where they feel accepted and know they belong. LGBTQIA+ awareness and support is an important part of creating an inclusive culture at Xero.\n\nIn 2022, we launched a new program of inclusive benefits to support our people when they are starting or growing their family. Our support for parents is available to all permanent employees globally, regardless of their gender identity, how they become a parent, or how long theyâve been with Xero. Since we introduced our gender-neutral parenting benefits, 10% of employees taking up parental leave have been men.\n\nWe also provide support for Xeros who have caring responsibilities through paid carerâs leave, which they can use to care for sick children, older parents or any other family members who require support. This is in addition to flexible and remote working arrangements, which help our people to balance work and family responsibilities.\n\nXero is proud to partner with Circle In to launch our caregivers platform. The platform is a place for employees with caregiving responsibilities, and the people leaders of carers, to find personalised support and connection. It aims to make life easier wherever possible by providing tailored resources and a community to lean on and guide you through different aspects of caregiving.\n\nXeroâs culture and the way in which we live our values every day are something for which we are widely known, and weâve been recognised in multiple countries as one of the best places to work:\n\nWe provide our people with the freedom to shape their career and do the best work of their lives. And weâre proud of the work we do to help small businesses succeed.\n\nWe know that it can be hard to find time for learning, so we have an internal learning channel packed with bite-sized learning modules to help our people fit learning into their everyday life. This allows our people to participate in continuous development even if it's a busy season of the year.\n\nAt Xero, weâve long championed the benefits of mental health and wellbeing to our people, our customers and our partners. Our people leaders continue to share their experiences authentically, creating an environment where talking about mental health and wellbeing is normalised. Some of the ways in which we do this include:\n\nOur first annual wellbeing climate survey in 2021 identified clear links between wellbeing and the performance of individuals and teams. It also provided an evidence-based way of understanding how to create the workplace conditions that foster wellbeing at Xero and what interventions will deliver this.\n\nUnder the stewardship of our Global Head of Wellbeing, weâre committed to putting wellbeing at the heart of how we operate. Weâre exploring how we can make changes to the way work is designed in order to improve our peopleâs experience of work, such as introducing designated meeting-free âfocus timeâ for deep, concentrated work. Our data demonstrates that the same workplace factors that are good for our peopleâs wellbeing are also good for performance, reducing the chance of burnout. We have close to 80 wellbeing champions across our global offices.\n\nOur 2022 research continued to put wellbeing at the heart of our sustainability as a fast growth company, linking our wellbeing climate with individual factors such as burnout and organisational factors such as attrition.\n\nWeâre partnering with two leading cognitive neuroscientists from the University of Berkeley to help optimise how we spend our mental energy and our time to maximise performance and wellbeing. This programme, called Time Well Spent, is a company-wide reset on how we approach meetings, prioritise focus time and get clear on our daily priorities so we can be deliberate about how we spend these precious resources of our time, energy and attention.\n\nXero's Annual Report 2024 outlines our performance for the year to 31 March 2024 and also includes details of our work in sustainability, and our latest gender diversity figures."
