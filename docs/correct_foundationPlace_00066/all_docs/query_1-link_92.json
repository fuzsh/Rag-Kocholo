        "text": "Xerocon Sydney FAQs\n\nFind out how to get tickets, how to get there, who to contact, and information about cancellation and refund policies.\n\nA Xerocon ticket includes the two-day conference on 23-24 August 2023. It does not include entrance to the Xerocon wrap party - tickets for this event must be purchased separately.\n\nNo, the not-to-be-missed wrap party has its own tickets. You can buy yours through the registration website for AU$100 each.\n\nNot this year, unfortunately. Only people who purchase tickets for the full Xerocon experience can attend the wrap party.\n\nNo, the ticket price does not include an event T-shirt. You can buy yours through the registration website for AU$20 each. All proceeds from the sale of the event T-shirts will be donated to Beyond Blue (AU) and The Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand.\n\nWe will process 10 or more tickets by invoice. Payment terms are 7 days from the date of invoice unless otherwise specified. Please email xerocon.sydney@xero.com if you wish to pay by invoice.\n\nThe unmissable Xerocon party will be held on the evening of Thursday 24 August 2023. Access to the wrap party requires a separate ticket which can be purchased from the registration website.\n\nXerocon is an event you really have to be at to experience, we arenât going to have a virtual option for Xerocon Sydney, we will be hosting roadshows and considering additional ways we can still connect with our community throughout 2023.\n\nHow are you going to ensure peopleâs health and safety in a large gathering with Covid-19 still in the community?\n\nOur top priority is the health and wellbeing of staff and attendees. So that you can focus on all the sights, sounds and fun of Xerocon, we will continue to follow COVID-19 guidelines in NSW, Australia and will post updates leading up to the event.\n\nPlease advise us by email on xerocon.sydney@xero.com if you cannot attend Xerocon. If you notify Xero at least 10 business days prior to the Event, a full refund of your ticket price (less a $50 administration fee) will be made. If you notify Xero within 10 business days of the Event, a full refund of your ticket price (less a $250 administration fee) will be made.\n\nIf you canât travel to Australia due to Covid-19 travel restrictions being in place then, we will waive the $50 administration fee if you need to cancel. Please note that we canât be responsible for flight or hotel bookings you have with third parties.\n\nProviding the event has not begun, we are able to transfer your ticket if you're not longer able to attend.. Please email xerocon.sydney@xero.com and we will be happy to assist."
