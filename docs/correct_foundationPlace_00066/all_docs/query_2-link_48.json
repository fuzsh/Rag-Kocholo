        "text": "What is Cloud Accounting?\n\nCloud accounting is best described as ‘online accounting’. Instead of installing and running your accounting software on your local computer you access the software and your data files over the internet. Your data is securely stored ‘in the cloud’ rather than on your local hard drive or server which means you have access to your financial data from anywhere, at any time, using any device including your mobile phone or tablet. All you need is an internet connection. Most people now use the cloud for applications like internet banking.\n\nIs cloud accounting right for you?\n\nHere at Simon Jones & Co we aim to help you unlock the financial potential of your business. One of the foundation stones in your business 'wall' is your accounting software and one size certainly doesn't fit all businesses. There are a number of software packages on the market and they vary in functionality and price. Before we recommend any accounting software package we always ask three key questions:\n\n❶ What does your business need? Payroll, inventory, debtors, creditors, invoicing or a full blown general ledger so you can produce your own financial statements?\n\n❷ What is your level of accounting skill?\n\n❸ Do you want to use a cloud or desktop accounting solution?\n\nAs such, your choice of accounting software will depend on your business needs and level of accounting skill. For that reason we support a number of programs including cloud based solutions. Increasingly our clients are opting for cloud based bookkeeping solutions because of the flexibility. You can run your business from home, work or on the go. The cloud also has the benefit of 24/7 access and all you need is an internet connection and your password.\n\nYou can access your financial data via the internet and invite your accountant or bookkeeper to view your accounts at the same time. This means you can get bookkeeping assistance and valuable advice in real-time. Log in online anytime, anywhere on your Mac, PC, tablet or smart phone to get a real-time view of your cashflow. Your data is completely secure, even if your computer is lost or stolen. Your data is automatically backed up and stored at various secure offsite locations.\n\nAll your invited users have access to the latest version of your financial data and you never need to worry about installing software or updates. Your data is never out-of-date and provided your subscription is current, software updates are automatically available when you login. Large upfront fees and switching costs are eliminated using cloud based solutions. These services run on a pay as you go basis so you only pay for what you use and the costs are 100% tax deductible.\n\nUltimately the idea is to let you spend more time working ON your business and less time on your record keeping. If you would like a demonstration of a cloud based software solution to assess the suitability to your business, contact us today.\n\nAs Certified Partners of Xero we have hundreds of clients using the program to do their bookkeeping in the cloud and we offer small business owners a range of options including:\n\nEstablish Your XERO file from scratch\n\nMove your bookkeeping from MYOB or QuickBooks/Reckon to XERO\n\nTrain you to use the program\n\nCorrect your XERO file (fixing other people's mistakes is a speciality of ours)\n\nProvide ongoing bookkeeping in XERO (we can even update daily if you'd like us to)\n\nProvide peace of mind that you're dealing with an experienced and certified XERO Partner\n\nWe invite you to book a FREE, one hour introductory consultation to discuss your business software needs. At this meeting you can expect practical advice designed to help you accelerate your business success.
