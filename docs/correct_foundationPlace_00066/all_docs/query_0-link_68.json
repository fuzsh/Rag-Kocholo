        "text": "“My mother graduated from MIT with a qualification specialising in medical administration and quickly got into a job as a ward clerk. Shortly afterwards she was promoted into another great position and she’s doing very well for herself.\n\nFor me, I saw myself doing something like this too. I wanted to work within a hospital, and I really enjoy the administration and customer service side. There are great job opportunities in medical administration and a lot of diversity within the hospital. I’m already a receptionist at Middlemore Hospital and by doing this course I hope to expand my career and become a ward clerk.\n\nI chose MIT because it's the only place that offered this course (medical administration), it’s close to home, and my mother recommended both the course and the lecturers – she had such great things to say about the programme. It was an easy transition from high school and there is great flexibility so I can work part-time while studying. I had two days of onsite classes and one day of online classes. It’s clear and well-structured and I was able to complete most of my work and assignments within class hours.\n\nI enjoyed the people, the culture, and the relationships I have developed over time with my lecturers. They were always there to help me out and really supported me in my journey.\n\nIf help is needed, help is always there for you.”\n\nAnushka Mani\n\nMIT graduate\n\n“I chose MIT because it was convenient and easy to enrol. I have a passion for accounting. What I enjoy most about MIT is meeting people, especially people from other ethnicities. The lecturers are really good, they will help out if you are ever lost or need anything. You just don't get the same support at other institutes.\n\nMy dream job is to work at a bank or do something in accounting. My family is proud that I am following something that I am passionate about instead of doing what others tell me to do.”\n\nVerrila Toai\n\nMIT student\n\n“What I learnt at MIT, and especially in the medical admin course, was super helpful. It’s kind of the baseline to what I go back to throughout my day. If I’m stuck on something, I think back to what we learned there and it helps guide me to what I’m supposed to be doing.\n\nMy advice would be just to jump in and check it out because you never know what you are missing until you get into something. Just do it.”\n\nEsther Zimri\n\nMIT graduate\n\n“I chose to study accounting support to prepare myself for a job and for further studies in the future. Accounting applies in every situation in life and growing up I had always loved numbers.\n\nBefore I started studying, I was a full-time stay-at-home mother of two beautiful daughters. I chose MIT because of the flexibility it offered, and the support from the lecturers. I was always provided with help and assistance. The constant encouragement from my lecturer and her hunger for my success, and for a better and brighter future, make me love MIT.\n\nEverything I learned and studied; I’m currently applying in my role as a team administrator (clinical) at Te Whatu Ora Te Toka Tumai Auckland. MIT prepared me well.\n\nIf you want to be successful, well-prepared to face the real world and be supported every step of the way – then MIT is the place for you. I have never met such loving lecturers who have always lived up to what the MIT values stand for, than the lecturers I had over my study period at MIT.\n\nThe support system and hunger for the success of the students from the lectures make MIT very unique.\"\n\nZeranya Pauga Faamoe\n\nMIT graduate"
