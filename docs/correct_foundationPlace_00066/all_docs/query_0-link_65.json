        "text": "We use Xero for our business and recommend it to clients who need an accounting system.\n\nXero is small business accounting software that runs in the cloud. This means all your financial data is stored online – so you can access it anywhere, anytime, from any device with an internet connection.\n\nEach day Xero automatically downloads a list of transactions from your bank and then the next time you log onto Xero it asks you to classify them (for example sales, office expense, entertainment).\n\nOnce you’ve classified your transactions (Xero calls it “reconciling”), your accounts are up to date and you can run a GST return in Xero with everything you need to fill in your return at IRD. You can also get up-to-date financial reports and at the end of the year most of what your accountant needs is waiting in Xero.\n\nXero also has all the other things you need from an accounting system: invoicing, payroll, inventory, multi-currency, fixed assets, contacts and full financial and management reporting. The invoicing function in Xero is particularly good. Because it loads your bank transaction history each day, reconciling your transactions shows at a glance which invoices are overdue.\n\nYou can go to the Xero website and sign up for a free trial. If you like it, you start paying monthly.\n\nEven better we provide a 10% discount on all Xero pricing plans to our clients.\n\nWe also offer fixed price pay monthly accounting packages that include Xero.\n\nContact us to find out more about using Xero."
