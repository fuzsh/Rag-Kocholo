        "text": "Making AML easier, and more human\n\nWhilst the Firmcheck journey is at the beginning, itâs spun out of 10 years of experience in building tools to help accounting and law firms manage their clients in a more efficient and streamlined way in New Zealand. We tackled tasks like filing annual returns and dealing with the administration of Trusts, paving the way for our market-leading entity management solution. This history of empowering firms to streamline their operations laid the foundation for us to address a new challenge in recent years â AML compliance.\n\nAs AML compliance laws rolled out and processes had to change, we heard from countless customers about the pains of managing AML in relation to their clients. That's when we knew there was a need for an AML management system like Firmcheck. With our expertise and experience in working in accounting technology, we set out to turn AML from a \"necessary evil\" into something that not only satisfies your obligations but also adds value to your firm. Thereâs no escaping your AML obligations but that doesnât mean it has to be challenging, and uninspiring. Through a great user experience, weâre turning your AML interactions into something that can help you build stronger client relationships, more efficiently complete AML checks, and keep your firm compliant at the same time."
