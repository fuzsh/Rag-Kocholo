        "text": "XERO is our preferred choice of accounting application for the Charity and Nonprofits sectors.\n\nCharities and Non Profits often have very limited resources to work with and limited access to funding. It’s very important for these Non Profits to be able to track their finances and keep an eye on the flow of funds in order to have a good understanding of their financial situation.\n\nXERO offers non-profits and charities with all the tools and features to manage their finances to achieve better transparency. Fundraising is crucial for NPO’s and our experience has shown that donors are influenced by the level of transparency of the reporting and management system used by an organization. This can influence their decision about whether or not to donate.\n\nWith xero keep a record of how much cash is flowing in and out. Getting easy access to information is crucial for your non-profit organization. Use a Xero to monitor the flow of cash and visualize your income, expenses, and budget. With xero you will always be on top of expenses with the cash summary Report."
