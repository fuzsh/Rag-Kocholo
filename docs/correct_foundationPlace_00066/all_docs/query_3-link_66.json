Most business owners discover that their time is better spent focusing on their goods and services rather than accounting debits and credits as their company expands.\n\nYou may outsource everything from day-to-day accounts receivables to payables, payroll, transaction coding, accounting, filing your Profits Tax Return, and even financial reporting.\n\nWhat accounting software is FastLane using?\n\nFastLane is using a cloud-based accounting software named Xero. Xero accounting system offers businesses a simple, yet powerful, way to manage their finances. Xero users can access their business finances wherever they are, collaborate seamlessly with other parties, and can even improve their cash flow through online invoices.\n\nFastLane Group started its journey with Xero in 2013 and is certified as one of the Xero Advisors and Xero Platinum partners. Our team are Xero experts and can guide you through the benefits of Xero and transform how you do your bookkeeping, run your credit control and even pay your employees.\n\nWhat accounting software is FastLane using?\n\nFastLane is using a cloud-based accounting software named Xero. Xero accounting system offers businesses a simple, yet powerful, way to manage their finances. Xero users can access their business finances wherever they are, collaborate seamlessly with other parties, and can even improve their cash flow through online invoices.\n\nFastLane Group started its journey with Xero in 2013 and is certified as one of the Xero Advisors and Xero Platinum partners. Our team are Xero experts and can guide you through the benefits of Xero and transform how you do your bookkeeping, run your credit control and even pay your employees.\n\nWhat is cloud accounting?\n\nCloud accounting, also known as online accounting, entails hosting accounting software on remote servers, transitioning the entire process to a cloud-based system while maintaining the same functionality as traditional desktop accounting. This approach mirrors the PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) business model, where data undergoes processing in a separate location before returning to the user or client.\n\nCloud accounting software eliminates the requirement for individual desktop installations and maintenance, providing businesses with real-time reporting and visibility. Besides, a significant advantage is the ability for users to access software applications remotely via the Internet or Intranet. In the context of a Hong Kong accounting firm, employees across various departments can access consistent, up-to-date data and software versions without missing any updates.\n\nFurthermore, most cloud platforms offer API functionality, allowing third-party software to integrate with your system and enhance your business accounting processes.\n\nWhat is bookkeeping and can I handle it myself?\n\nYou can handle bookkeeping yourself, but it is not recommended. Keeping account books is essential for ensuring the efficient operation of the company. It involves maintaining a comprehensive record of year-round financial transactions, including profit and loss statements, balance sheets, ledger accounts, accounts receivable and payable, and bank reconciliation statements.\n\nWhat are the tax filing requirements in Hong Kong?\n\nEvery company is required to submit its Profits Tax Return annually. For newly incorporated company, the first Profits Tax Return is issued 18 months after incorporation. The company will then have 3 months to prepare the accounts and audit report for the initial profits tax filing. Subsequently, the tax return must be filed by the deadline determined by the Company’s Accounting Year End Date.\n\nFurthermore, companies employing staff are required to submit the Employer’s Return of Remuneration & Pensions annually. This report should include the salaries and wages disbursed to employees for each fiscal year (April to March) and is commonly filed in April each year.\n\nI didn’t find the answer to my question…\n\nThat’s alright!
