When my specialist said they were aiming for a cure, that’s what I was focused on. As a friend had said to me, I had to get on the train, strap on for a ride and get through to the other end. So that’s what I did.\n\nSharing my experience is my way of spreading the message to create awareness which is why it’s so special that my workplace, Xero, has jumped on board to become a Pink Ribbon Breakfast sponsor this year.\n\nToday is all about supporting the more than 5,500 incredible people all around the country who are fundraising today. Please donate so we can ensure more Kiwis learn about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer.”\n\nDonate now at the link in our bio\".",
