        "text": "Last year, we launched the Xero Beautiful Business Fund, which offers more than NZ$750,000 in funding to Xero customers across Australia, Canada (excluding Quebec), New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, the UK and the US. We‚Äôre excited to share that the Xero Beautiful Business Fund is back for 2024. Entries are now open for Xero small business customers across Aotearoa New Zealand. There are four categories: - Innovating for environmental sustainability: How are you taking the next step on your environmental sustainability journey? - Strengthening community connection: How are you serving your community and making a positive impact? - Trailblazing with technology: How are you seeking to innovate and set pace using emerging technologies? - Upskilling for the future: How are you overcoming a skills gap and preparing for the future? It‚Äôs easy to enter. All you need to do is complete a short online form and record and upload a 90-second pitch video. This can be as simple as a self-recorded video on your phone. Submit your entry by 27 August 2024 NZT, then sit tight for the winners to be announced at the end of October. https://lnkd.in/gq4c2jFR Good luck! ü§û\n\nAs a nation, it‚Äôs important we‚Äôre as productive as possible with every hour we work - especially in the current economic climate. Our latest Xero Small Business Insights special report looking into the productivity of Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs small business economy found the national productivity fell in 2023. In fact, average productivity was 6.1% lower than in 2022. This decline was experienced by all industries, with agriculture and hospitality particularly feeling the pinch. Poor productivity impacts all aspects of a businesses operation, stalling the growth of wages and impacting employers ability to attract and retain staff. The Government and business sector at large need to create avenues and opportunities to empower small business owners to improve productivity through the adoption of digital tools. For every hour an employee is at work, they should be doing work only a human can do - using digital tools to free up their time and unlock their potential. At Xero, we‚Äôre committed to helping Kiwi small businesses tap into the productivity gains waiting to be uncovered through embracing digital tools and processes. #Xero #Productivity https://lnkd.in/gP4cWBXe\n\nToday is Pink Ribbon Breakfast Day. To say that people have come out to show their support is an understatement. Events and donations are happening all over the country, and the cream on top was yesterday when Xero doubled donations towards Breast Cancer Foundation NZ‚Äôs Pink Ribbon campaign, matching up to $30,000. We met this goal in three minutes. THANK YOU! As many of you will know, Breast Cancer Foundation NZ is a charity close to my heart and I am personally very grateful for their support, and your support. Breast cancer affects more people than you might realise. While cancer is now thankfully behind me, for many others their journey is just beginning and the Breast Cancer Foundation NZ will play an important role for them. Thank you once again, Xero is incredibly proud to be supporting this campaign. Donate now at https://lnkd.in/gUz798PU\n\nNominations are rolling in for the New Zealand Leadership Awards, with only one week to go until entries close next Friday (24 May). This is a great opportunity to celebrate standout individuals who have made an incredible impact within their organisation. I encourage you to nominate yourself or a leader you know who deserves to be recognised - the entry process is fast and only asks you one question. As a champion of small businesses, Xero is excited to sponsor the SME business leadership award this year. There‚Äôs also a range of other categories to enter, with a panel of 30 exceptional judges. To learn more or submit your nomination, visit: https://lnkd.in/gxjpk9gt\n\nWhile you may not agree with the commercialisation of a day to celebrate mothers, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to be reminded to stop and express gratitude for the amazing mothers in your life and all they do for the people they love. Here is my amazing mum Liz (known as Liddy) with me and my sister. Liddy is a lionnes who devoted her life to my brother, sister and me; and who now is a devoted and involved granny to her nine grandchildren. She is also the rock for my dad, who until he was early 70s worked 60-70 hour weeks as a G.P. Liddy is the unsung hero. She shouldered most of the day to day parenting of us growing up, given dad‚Äôs long hours at his surgery. She herself gave up her career as a dietician to raise us - and then went back and retrained when I was 20 (and she was 52) and subsequently enjoyed a successful and rewarding career as a community dietician and wound specialist at Waitakere Hospital. She has always encouraged, supported and pushed us to be the best we can be - as people first and foremost, and then in our chosen fields. She is central to our villages as we juggle careers and kids. And I still need her hugs. She laid down the path of what being a mum means, and I strive to follow her as I navigate my own mothering journey for my three little people. Thank you Liddy for being an amazing mum - I am grateful to you for everything you do and everything you are. ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üòò Happy Mother‚Äôs Day."
