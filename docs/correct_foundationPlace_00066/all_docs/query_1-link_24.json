        "text": "Our physical and emotional health as well as mental and spiritual wellbeing are key to happiness, contentment and being productive. It makes sense for our nation as well. Every dollar spent on mental health services in New Zealand repays the nation with $3.50 in productivity gains and other savings.\n\nWorkplaces can play a central role in building peopleâs resilience and positive wellbeing, so they can better cope with setbacks, take advantage of opportunities, and make valuable contributions as members of families, communities and workplaces.\n\nIt makes financial sense to consider wellbeing as well. New research from the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research has found that, for every single dollar you spend on staff wellbeing initiatives, you can earn up to $12 back on your investment within a year, due to increased productivity.\n\nThe Agri Check-In is a five-step series to help support you and your workers to thrive based on advice from New Zealand health and wellbeing experts. It takes the guesswork out of how to get started, with a checklist thatâs focused on the wellness of those working in the agriculture sector. The best part is, itâs easy to implement and doesnât need to cost anything.\n\nHaving genuine face-to-face conversations in person or on video calls can help you understand your team members, who they are and what makes them tick.\n\nHelping your team build connections with one another helps them maintain a healthy outlook on life and is a crucial part of their overall wellbeing.\n\nFrom exercise to making healthy life choices, there are plenty of habits employers can encourage their employees to pick up in order to make a positive change in their lives.\n\nFoster an environment that empowers your team to ask for professional help before they really need it.\n\nBecause we take wellbeing seriously at Xero, in 2019, we worked with the Mental Health Foundation to investigate wellbeing across the Kiwi small business sector. That work resulted in the Small Business Wellbeing Report.\n\nIf youâre interested in the financial benefits of wellbeing and digitisation, The Next Level guide takes a deeper look at the economics behind wellbeing.\n\nBased on advice from New Zealand health and wellbeing experts, The Check-In is a five-step series to help improve small business wellbeing in a way thatâs easy and cost-free to implement.\n\nBuilding an open environment where you and your employees feel safe and empowered to make the right calls where mental wellbeing is concerned is a very positive, beneficial achievement that all Kiwi businesses can aspire to.\n\nXero customers have access to free and 100% confidential wellbeing support through the Xero Assistance Programme, which offers employees and their families access to free face-to-face, telephone, live chat, and online counselling. If youâre a Xero customer, make sure your staff and their families know how to access the programme.\n\nConsider what your businessâs long-term wellbeing plan needs to be. By making small changes over time, you can make a big difference to your teamâs life and to your business.\n\nFarmstrong is an initiative designed to give farmers the skills and resources to live well, farm well and get the most out of life."
