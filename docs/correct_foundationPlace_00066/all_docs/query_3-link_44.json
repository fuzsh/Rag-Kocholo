        "text": "Import your accounting actuals from Xero to begin planning and reporting in Jirav\n\nJirav's foundation is built on your accounting data. To get started, import the chart of accounts, account balances, and optionally, a department structure from Xero. Follow these steps to import your accounting actuals​ from Xero.\n\nFrom your Jirav account, navigate to Settings ⚙️ > Actuals\n\nLocate Xero in the Actuals: Accounting section and click Connect.\n\nYou will be redirected to the Xero website to enter your credentials and establish the connection between Jirav and Xero. After validating your credentials, you'll automatically be sent back to Jirav to complete the connection.\n\nReview the date range prompt and click Import.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you will receive a confirmation indicating that the data import was successful. This confirms the successful establishment of the connection, and you will see the Connect button replaced with an Import button.\n\nYou can now go start exploring dashboards, reports & plans!\n\n​\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe integration between Xero and Jirav will run automatically every night for the current and previous month. To refresh the data immediately, or to reimport a historical period, navigate to Settings > Actuals and click the IMPORT button.\n\nJirav Departments & Tracking Categories\n\n​\n\nIn Xero, tracking categories can be used to classify transactions based on different criteria such as departments, locations, or projects. This categorization facilitates organized reporting and analysis of financial data, providing insights into various aspects of the business's performance.\n\nOptionally choose to map a tracking category of your choice from Xero to Jirav Department.\n\nTo enable this feature, go to Settings ⚙️ > Departments, click on the ellipsis (...) next to the XERO column to enable the context menu, click on Select Tracking Category, choose the desired Tracking Category from the prompt, and click Confirm.\n\nAfter selecting the desired tracking category, map the chosen tracking category values to their corresponding Jirav Departments by clicking in the white space to the right of Jirav department.\n\nHelpful Hints:\n\nUsing tracking categories is not mandatory - If your company does not currently utilize tracking categories, you can simply plan at the company level in Jirav\n\nJirav Departments can map to a single Tracking Category of your choice\n\nYou will need \"Standard\" access to Xero - a \"Read Only\" user does not have the permission required to establish the connection to Jirav\n\nIf you have more than one account in Xero, be sure to choose the specific account you wish to link to Jirav when prompted during the connection process\n\nIf you decide you would like to change which Tracking Category from Xero that you previously mapped to Departments in Jirav, navigate to Settings ⚙️ > Departments > Click on the ellipsis (...) next to the Xero column to enable the context menu, click on Select Tracking choose the desired Tracking Category from the prompt, and click Confirm.\n\nClick here to learn more about Departments in Jirav\n\nClick here to learn more about Tracking Categories in Xero"
