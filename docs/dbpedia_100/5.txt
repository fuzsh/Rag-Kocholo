BYU basketball's home game against Texas on Saturday has sold out, the program announced on Thursday. The Cougars, who are coming off a narrow loss to no. 4 Houston, have only played the Longhorns once in basketball in the last 45 years according to Sports Reference. This is a critical game for a BYU basketball team that is 2-4 in conference play and competing for an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament.

The last matchup between BYU and Texas came in 2013 when the two teams squared off in the College Basketball Experience Hall of Fame Classic. BYU beat Texas 86-82. That was the first basketball game between BYU and Texas since 1978 when BYU lost at no. 13 Texas 57-96.

BYU in the Polls

On Monday, the new AP poll for college basketball was released and BYU dropped one spot from no. 20 to no. 21 after splitting games last week against Iowa State and Texas Tech. The Cougars, who are 2-4 in conference play, are looking to rebound after suffering a narrow loss to no. 4 Houston on Tuesday night.

BYU is one of seven Big 12 teams in the AP top 25. They are joined by Houston (4), Kansas (7), Oklahoma (11), Baylor (15), Texas Tech (20), and Iowa State (23).

This is the second game in a critical week for BYU hoops. These two games were swing games on BYU's schedule. At minimum, it felt like BYU needed to split this home series. After an 0-1 start, the game against Texas feels like a must-win game. An 0-2 record this week would have BYU near the bottom of the conference with a 2-5 record, and getting back to .500 would be an uphill battle.

Below is the full AP top 25.
