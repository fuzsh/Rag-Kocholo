        "text": "10/10 BAYLOR BEARS (9-2)\n\nLocation: Waco,Texas\n\nConference/Affiliation: Big 12\n\nHead Coach: Nicki Collen (Marquette, 1998)\n\nRoster | Stats | Game Notes (PDF) BAYLOR (9-2) vs. NORTH TEXAS (6-3)\n\nDecember 29, 2021 • 7 p.m. CT\n\nWaco, Texas • Ferrell Center\n\nLIVE STATS: Stat Broadcast\n\nWATCH: Big 12 Now on ESPN+\n\nTalent: Lincoln Rose (pxp), Jim Haller (analyst)\n\nLISTEN: ESPN 1660AM, 92.3FM, BaylorBears.com\n\nTalent: Derek Smith (pxp), Sophia Young-Malcolm (Analyst)\n\nBaylor Social Media: NR/NR NORTH TEXAS MEAN GREEN (6-3)\n\nLocation: Denton, Texas\n\nConference/Affiliation: Conference USA\n\nHead Coach: Jalie Mitchell (North Texas, 2002)\n\nRoster | Stats | Game Notes (PDF)\n\nONE MORE FOR 2021\n\n• After Baylor had to cancel its matchup against Houston Baptist due to COVID-19 protocols within the Huskies' program, the Bears scheduled a contest against North Texas to replace it.\n\n• Wednesday night's game is being dubbed the \"Rockin' New Year\" game for BU. It also marks the first time since 2006 that the Bears and Mean Green have faced off on the court.\n\n• Baylor has not played a game since its Dec. 19 contest vs. Michigan. After playing eight games in November, Wednesday is just the fourth December game for the Bears.\n\nWALKING DOUBLE-DOUBLE\n\n• NaLyssa Smith leads the country with 10 double-doubles on the season. Keep in mind, the Bears have only played 11 games. The senior has recorded 10-straight double-doubles.\n\n• During this streak, Smith has five games with a minimum of 15 rebounds. She leads the country in rebounds per game (13.3).\n\n• Smith is currently ninth in Baylor history with 34 career double-doubles. She's one away from tying for seventh alongside Lauren Cox (2016-20) and LaNita Luckey (1988-92).\n\nLET IT FLY\n\n• The calendar hadn't even flipped to December yet before the Bears tied for second in program history with 13 3-pointers made in their blowout win over Morehead State (11/30).\n\n• Baylor's program record for triples made came on Dec. 18, 2019 against Arkansas State when Juicy Landrum caught fire and set an NCAA record with 14 triples. Besides that record-setting performance, BU hadn't drained more than a dozen shots from deep since 2011.\n\n• BU's record for 3-point attempts in a season came in 2013-14 when the Bears attempted 596 3s.\n\n• From that season to 2020-21, Baylor made 10 or more 3-pointers in a game only five times across a total of 281 games (1.78 percent).\n\n• This season alone - in Nicki Collen's new offensive system - the Bears are letting it fly from the perimeter. Twice in 10 games BU has sank double-digit triples.\n\n• Prior to this season, ony 14 Bears had made six or more 3s in a game. Two of them had done it multiple times (Makenzie Robertson, 2012, 2014) and Jennifer King (1990, 1991, 1993).\n\n• Sarah Andrews and Ja'Mee Asberry have already joined the club this season. Andrews went 6-for-8 against Morehead State from deep and Asberry fired off 6-of-8 against Alcorn State.\n\nCLUB 17K\n\n• Jordan Lewis surpassed the 1,700 career-points mark in Baylor's win over Alcorn State. The sixth-year graduate transfer left Alabama as the Crimson Tide's fifth all-time leader in assists (510) and ninth all-time leader with 1,581 points.\n\n• Lewis is No. 16 among active players for most points scored in her career with 1,716.\n\n• She's third among active players with 563 career assists."
