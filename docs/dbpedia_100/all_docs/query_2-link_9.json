        "text": "Streeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nThe field is set for college football bowl season. The matchups for all 35 postseason bowls were announced on Sunday night.\n\nWith the way the conference championship games unfolded, there weren't any real shocks among the BCS bowl selections.\n\nOhio State's loss to Michigan State ended any sort of controversy about the national championship. Florida State will meet Auburn in Pasadena in what will be the biggest must-see matchup of bowl season.\n\nIt will be great to see Jameis Winston and the balanced Seminoles offense go head to head against Tre Mason, Nick Marshall and that splendid Auburn running game.\n\nAmong the other four BCS games, the Rose Bowl stands out. Both Stanford and Michigan State play a physical style of football. The Cardinal and Spartans have strong defenses and offenses predicated on running the football. Don't be surprised if this game proves to be the most enjoyable in Pasadena this January.\n\nBrian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports\n\nClemson and Ohio State is also an intriguing matchup in the Orange Bowl, as many were criticizing the Tigers and Buckeyes' resumes throughout the season. Both teams need a quality win to silence some of the doubters and begin the hype train for 2014.\n\nOf course, bowl season isn't all about the big boys.\n\nMany fans argue that it's foolish to have over half of of the teams in the FBS qualify for bowl games, as it devalues qualifying for a postseason bowl. There's some validity to that criticism.\n\nOn the other hand, bowl games are often the biggest showcase schools from non-AQ conferences can get. It's a chance to play in front of a national audience with the lights on bright and plenty of NFL scouts in attendance, and a bowl is a great reward for guys like Jordan Lynch and Derek Carr, who've done so much for their respective schools.\n\nBrian Bahr/Getty Images\n\nPlus, the smaller bowls are a great proving ground for potential BCS busters. Boise State made the slow climb up from the Humanitarian Bowl to the Liberty Bowl and then eventually a win over Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nChances are, a future BCS buster is lurking among those lesser-considered bowl games.\n\nWithout further ado, here's the schedule for bowl season."
