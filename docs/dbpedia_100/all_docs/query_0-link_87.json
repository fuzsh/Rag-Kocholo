        "text": "NEW YORK, N.Y. – Luke Wysong, who missed all but four games last season with an injury, has been named to the 2024 Comeback Player of the Year Award Watch List. The award is presented by the College Sports Communicators (formerly CoSIDA) in association with The Associated Press (AP) and the Fiesta Bowl Organization, and in total 90 college football student-athletes from 68 different schools were named.\n\nWysong, who was previously on the Paul Hornung Watch List for multi-position players, caught seven passes on the season before suffering a shoulder injury against New Mexico State. Wysong had the only punt return for positive yardage last year for UNM in that game as well. He was recently honored by his teammates with the honor of being the first pick in the initial Lobo Football Jersey Selection Ceremony, picking his customary 15.\n\nSince 2018, the award has recognized college football student-athletes for overcoming injury, illness, or other circumstances. At the conclusion of each season, in a vote by a panel of college football writers, editors, and sports information directors, three college football student-athletes are honored as Comeback Player of the Year Award winners at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl.\n\nCollege athletic communications professionals working with football programs are encouraged to nominate deserving candidates at www.Comeback-Player.com. Here’s a look at the 2024 Pre-Season Comeback Player of the Year Watch List.\n\nPLAYER SCHOOL Conference POSITION Zuberi Mobley FAU AAC RB Ikaika Ragsdale North Texas AAC RB Jason Vaughn Univ.
