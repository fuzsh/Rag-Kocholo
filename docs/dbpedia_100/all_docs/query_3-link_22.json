        "text": "After three months of constant changes to the college basketball landscape -- due to seismic coaching changes, the transfer portal, the NBA draft -- July was a quieter period for roster machinations. There were a couple of noteworthy additions, but the final real needle mover from the portal was Arthur Kaluma going to Texas.\n\nAs a result, there's no major team movement in the August edition of these rankings. There could still be some changes before we officially hit the preseason, with the potential for reclassifications from the recruiting class of 2025 and international prospects still yet to reveal themselves.\n\nSo we're taking a different approach to this month's rankings: We're picking one nonconference game to watch for each of the top 25 teams. They might not be the best games on a schedule, but they do present fascinating storylines. And they could inform how good these teams might be in 2024-25.\n\nLast updated: August 5, 2024\n\n1. Kansas Jayhawks\n\nPrevious ranking: 1\n\nNov. 26 vs. Duke in Las Vegas: It's our preseason No. 1 team facing the projected No. 1 pick in the 2025 NBA draft in Duke's Cooper Flagg. The Jayhawks have big games against North Carolina and Michigan State earlier in the month, but the role allocations should be a bit more defined by the time they arrive in Vegas.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nDajuan Harris Jr. (8.5 PPG)\n\nZeke Mayo (18.8 PPG at South Dakota State)\n\nAJ Storr (16.8 PPG at Wisconsin)\n\nK.J. Adams Jr. (12.6 PPG)\n\nHunter Dickinson (17.9 PPG)\n\n2. Alabama Crimson Tide\n\nPrevious ranking: 2\n\nDec. 4 at North Carolina: The Crimson Tide have a slew of intriguing nonconference games this season and will show up as opponents for other top 25 teams. But this trip to Chapel Hill is a big one for Nate Oats' team for a couple of reasons. One, it's a rematch of last season's Sweet 16 matchup. Two, it's a true road game, which always adds a little extra importance in a top-10 matchup.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nMark Sears (21.5 PPG)\n\nLatrell Wrightsell Jr. (8.9 PPG)\n\nChris Youngblood (15.3 PPG at South Florida)\n\nGrant Nelson (11.9 PPG)\n\nClifford Omoruyi (10.4 PPG at Rutgers)\n\n3. UConn Huskies\n\nPrevious ranking: 3\n\nDec. 14 vs. Gonzaga at Madison Square Garden: UConn's blowout of the Zags in Seattle last December was one of the early signs that the Huskies had the ability to repeat as national champs. Gonzaga should be better this season, however -- and this game will still be relatively early in the season for UConn. This will also be a familiar opponent for Saint Mary's transfer Aidan Mahaney.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nHassan Diarra (6.1 PPG)\n\nAidan Mahaney (13.9 PPG at Saint Mary's)\n\nLiam McNeeley (No. 9 in ESPN 100)\n\nAlex Karaban (13.3 PPG)\n\nSamson Johnson (5.4 PPG)\n\n4. Houston Cougars\n\nPrevious ranking: 4\n\nNov. 26 vs. Alabama in Las Vegas: A terrific offense-defense battle as the headliner of the Players Era Festival. Under Nate Oats, the Crimson Tide have consistently fielded one of the nation's best attacks, and Kelvin Sampson's defenses have been at the heart of Houston's success. We won't see Mark Sears vs. Jamal Shead this season, but there's more than enough talent on the floor.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nMilos Uzan (9.0 PPG at Oklahoma)\n\nL.J. Cryer (15.5 PPG)\n\nEmanuel Sharp (12.6 PPG)\n\nJ'Wan Roberts (9.5 PPG)\n\nJa'Vier Francis (6.0 PPG)\n\n5. Gonzaga Bulldogs\n\nPrevious ranking: 5\n\nDec. 28 vs. UCLA in Los Angeles: This isn't a true road game for Gonzaga, with the tilt set to take place at the Intuit Dome a short drive south of the Bruins' campus. And while the Zags have their typical loaded nonconference slate, this first game in the two-year series is likely to be one of their final real tests before the NCAA tournament.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nRyan Nembhard (12.6 PPG)\n\nNolan Hickman (14.0 PPG)\n\nMichael Ajayi (17.2 PPG at Pepperdine)\n\nBen Gregg (9.0 PPG)\n\nGraham Ike (16.5 PPG)\n\n6. Baylor Bears\n\nPrevious ranking: 6\n\nDec. 4 at UConn: A true road game for Scott Drew's team. Baylor reloaded in the offseason with transfers Jeremy Roach (Duke) and Norchad Omier (Miami) and top-five recruit V.J. Edgecombe. This is the marquee matchup of the Big 12-Big East Battle and should be one of the best nonconference games of the campaign.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nJeremy Roach (14.0 PPG at Duke)\n\nJayden Nunn (10.5 PPG)\n\nV.J. Edgecombe (No. 3 in ESPN 100)\n\nLangston Love (11.0 PPG)\n\nNorchad Omier (17.0 PPG at Miami)\n\n7. Iowa State Cyclones\n\nPrevious ranking: 7\n\nNov. 25-27 Maui Invitational: This multiple-team event (MTE) has no shortage of ranked teams in the field this season, with UConn, North Carolina and Auburn joining the Cyclones in Hawaii. While the bracket is yet to be released, expect Iowa State to be a favorite to at least reach the title game. A great national stage early for this program.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nTamin Lipsey (12.4 PPG)\n\nCurtis Jones (11.0 PPG)\n\nKeshon Gilbert (13.7 PPG)\n\nMilan Momcilovic (10.9 PPG)\n\nDishon Jackson (11.4 PPG at Charlotte)\n\n8. Duke Blue Devils\n\nPrevious ranking: 8\n\nNov. 12 vs. Kentucky in Atlanta: The Blue Devils also face Arizona, Kansas and Auburn, but this will be Cooper Flagg's first game against a ranked team with the nation watching. While Jon Scheyer added a bit of experience from the transfer portal to the incoming No. 1 recruiting class, new Kentucky coach Mark Pope will be trotting out a group almost entirely loaded with veteran college players.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nTyrese Proctor (10.5 PPG)\n\nCaleb Foster (7.7 PPG)\n\nCooper Flagg (No. 1 in ESPN 100)\n\nMaliq Brown (9.5 PPG at Syracuse)\n\nKhaman Maluach (five-star)\n\n9. Arizona Wildcats\n\nPrevious ranking: 9\n\nNov. 27-29 Battle 4 Atlantis: Similarly to the Maui Invitational, we don't know the exact bracket for this tournament yet. But Arizona is one of three top-20 teams participating, along with Gonzaga and Indiana. Louisville and Providence will also be there. This is a chance for Caleb Love, Tommy Lloyd and the Wildcats to make a first-month statement.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nJaden Bradley (7.0 PPG)\n\nCaleb Love (18.0 PPG)\n\nKJ Lewis (6.1 PPG)\n\nTrey Townsend (17.3 PPG at Oakland)\n\nMotiejus Krivas (5.4 PPG)\n\n10. North Carolina Tar Heels\n\nPrevious ranking: 10\n\nNov. 8 at Kansas: Arguably the first true marquee game of the season. Plus, it's a true road game for the Tar Heels. It will feature two likely preseason All-Americans in RJ Davis and Hunter Dickinson, while we will also get an early look at how Kansas divvies up its wing and forward minutes and what Carolina does with its frontcourt.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nElliot Cadeau (7.3 PPG)\n\nRJ Davis (21.2 PPG)\n\nIan Jackson (No. 7 in ESPN 100)\n\nCade Tyson (16.2 PPG at Belmont)\n\nVen-Allen Lubin (12.3 PPG)\n\n11. Auburn Tigers\n\nPrevious ranking: 11\n\nNov. 9 at Houston: Bruce Pearl's program finalized a two-year series with Houston, beginning this season at the Toyota Center. Johni Broome's decision to return cemented Auburn as a borderline top-10 team entering 2024-25, and the Tigers will get an early chance at a statement against a perennial national contender, with one of the elite paint defenses in the country.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nJP Pegues (18.4 PPG at Furman)\n\nDenver Jones (9.1 PPG)\n\nMiles Kelly (13.9 PPG at Georgia Tech)\n\nChad Baker-Mazara (10.0 PPG)\n\nJohni Broome (16.5 PPG)\n\n12. Texas A&M Aggies\n\nPrevious ranking: 12\n\nDec. 14 vs. Purdue in Indianapolis: The Aggies have some of the most roster continuity in the SEC, with seven of their top eight scorers returning from last season. Purdue, meanwhile, is replacing two-time Wooden Award winner Zach Edey. The backcourt battle between Wade Taylor IV and Braden Smith should be outstanding.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nWade Taylor IV (19.1 PPG)\n\nManny Obaseki (7.0 PPG)\n\nZhuric Phelps (14.8 PPG at SMU)\n\nHenry Coleman III (8.8 PPG)\n\nPharrel Payne (10.0 PPG at Minnesota)\n\n13. Tennessee Volunteers\n\nPrevious ranking: 13\n\nNov. 21-22 Baha Mar Bahamas Championship: A two-day trip to the Caribbean offers a number of opportunities for Rick Barnes' transfer-laden lineup to take shape against strong competition. The hope is that the Volunteers will face Baylor at some point, but a game against the elite backcourt of St. John's or defense of Virginia is also worth monitoring.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nZakai Zeigler (11.8 PPG)\n\nChaz Lanier (19.7 PPG at North Florida)\n\nJahmai Mashack (4.5 PPG)\n\nDarlinstone Dubar (17.8 PPG at Hofstra)\n\nFelix Okpara (6.6 PPG at Ohio State)\n\n14. Arkansas Razorbacks\n\nPrevious ranking: 14\n\nDec. 10 vs. Michigan at Madison Square Garden: John Calipari's first full schedule in Fayetteville hasn't been released just yet, but there are a couple of games already being reported -- with a game against Michigan and fellow first-year head coach Dusty May in New York City the headline. It's also a reunion between May and his former Florida Atlantic star, Johnell Davis.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nD.J. Wagner (9.9 PPG at Kentucky)\n\nJohnell Davis (18.2 PPG at Florida Atlantic)\n\nKarter Knox (No. 26 in ESPN 100)\n\nTrevon Brazile (8.6 PPG)\n\nJonas Aidoo (11.4 PPG at Tennessee)\n\n15. Creighton Bluejays\n\nPrevious ranking: 15\n\nDec. 4 vs. Kansas: Ryan Kalkbrenner vs. Hunter Dickinson down low? Sign us up. Creighton isn't the same team it's been the past couple of years, with Baylor Scheierman and Trey Alexander both gone, but Greg McDermott still has more than enough to win in March. A home game against potential No. 1 Kansas in early December is the perfect proving ground.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nSteven Ashworth (11.1 PPG)\n\nPop Isaacs (15.8 PPG at Texas Tech)\n\nJamiya Neal (11.0 PPG at Arizona State)\n\nMason Miller (5.6 PPG)\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner (17.3 PPG)\n\n16. Purdue Boilermakers\n\nPrevious ranking: 16\n\nNov. 15 vs. Alabama: The Boilermakers have a slew of games to watch -- against Marquette, Texas A&M, Auburn and at the Rady Children's Invitational -- but welcoming in a preseason top-three team in the first few weeks of the season is difficult to pass up. Zach Edey is no longer in town, but Matt Painter still has an elite backcourt in Braden Smith and Fletcher Loyer; Smith vs. Mark Sears is terrific.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nBraden Smith (12.2 PPG)\n\nFletcher Loyer (10.6 PPG)\n\nCamden Heide (3.4 PPG)\n\nTrey Kaufman-Renn (6.4 PPG)\n\nDaniel Jacobsen (four-star)\n\n17. Marquette Golden Eagles\n\nPrevious ranking: 17\n\nDec. 4 at Iowa State: With Tyler Kolek out the door, this season the Golden Eagles will be Kam Jones' team. And he will be the focus of Iowa State's elite defense -- particularly Tamin Lipsey, one of the best defenders in college basketball. How effective Jones and the rest of the Marquette offense can be against the Cyclones is worth watching.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nSean Jones (5.8 PPG)\n\nKam Jones (17.2 PPG)\n\nStevie Mitchell (8.8 PPG)\n\nDavid Joplin (10.8 PPG)\n\nBen Gold (5.0 PPG)\n\n18. Indiana Hoosiers\n\nPrevious ranking: 18\n\nNov. 27-29 Battle 4 Atlantis: There's not a ton of excitement on the Hoosiers' nonconference schedule, but their trip to the Bahamas is a chance for Mike Woodson's talented roster to live up to the expectations placed on them. Gonzaga and Arizona will enter the tournament as favorites, but there's an opportunity to see whether Malik Reneau and Oumar Ballo can dominate down low.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nMyles Rice (14.8 PPG at Washington State)\n\nKanaan Carlyle (11.5 PPG at Stanford)\n\nMackenzie Mgbako (12.2 PPG)\n\nMalik Reneau (15.4 PPG)\n\nOumar Ballo (14.2 PPG at Arizona)\n\n19. Cincinnati Bearcats\n\nPrevious ranking: 19\n\nDec. 14 vs. Xavier: Even on a loaded Saturday of basketball, the Crosstown Shootout stands out. This is a crucial season for Wes Miller and the Bearcats, who have won 45 games in two seasons but have yet to reach the NCAA tournament in that stretch. A rivalry game against a Xavier team that brings in one of the best transfer classes in the country is must-watch.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nDay Day Thomas (10.4 PPG)\n\nConnor Hickman (14.5 PPG at Bradley)\n\nDan Skillings Jr. (12.9 PPG)\n\nDillon Mitchell (9.6 PPG at Texas)\n\nAziz Bandaogo (6.6 PPG)\n\n20. Ole Miss Rebels\n\nPrevious ranking: 20\n\nNov. 28-29 Rady Children's Invitational: A trip to Louisville on Dec. 3 is a fun early-season test for two talented teams, but this strong four-team tournament is a chance for Ole Miss to really make a statement. The Rebels are joined by Purdue, NC State and BYU -- two 2024 Final Four teams and a BYU group with tournament expectations. It's a big opportunity for Chris Beard's team.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nSean Pedulla (16.4 PPG at Virginia Tech)\n\nMatthew Murrell (16.2 PPG)\n\nDre Davis (15.0 PPG at Seton Hall)\n\nJaemyn Brakefield (12.9 PPG)\n\nMalik Dia (16.9 PPG at Belmont)\n\n21. Florida Gators\n\nPrevious ranking: 21\n\nDec. 17 vs. North Carolina in Charlotte: Taking place at the Spectrum Center in the Jumpman Invitational, this game should feature one of the best scoring guard matchups in the sport in Walter Clayton Jr. vs. RJ Davis: the latter is a preseason Wooden Award favorite, and the former scored 33 against Colorado in the NCAA tournament.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nWalter Clayton Jr. (17.6 PPG)\n\nAlijah Martin (13.1 PPG at Florida Atlantic)\n\nWill Richard (11.4 PPG)\n\nAlex Condon (7.7 PPG)\n\nRueben Chinyelu (4.7 PPG at Washington State)\n\n22. Texas Longhorns\n\nPrevious ranking: 22\n\nNov. 4 vs. Ohio State in Las Vegas: A chance to host reigning national champion UConn on Dec. 8 is the Longhorns' best nonconference game. But all eyes will be on Rodney Terry's newcomer-heavy lineup on opening night against the Buckeyes, who should be an NCAA tournament team under Jake Diebler.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nJordan Pope (17.6 PPG at Oregon State)\n\nTramon Mark (16.2 PPG at Arkansas)\n\nTre Johnson (No. 5 in ESPN 100)\n\nJayson Kent (13.5 PPG at Indiana State)\n\nKadin Shedrick (7.7 PPG)\n\n23. Kentucky Wildcats\n\nPrevious ranking: 23\n\nDec. 14 vs. Louisville: The first rivalry game in the new era of Kentucky, and Louisville, basketball. Mark Pope vs. Pat Kelsey. Neither team brings back a single scholarship player from last season, adding another layer -- even if the level of disdain toward the opponent isn't quite there yet. Pope will make sure his players are up for this one.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nKerr Kriisa (11.0 PPG at West Virginia)\n\nOtega Oweh (11.4 PPG at Oklahoma)\n\nJaxson Robinson (14.2 PPG at BYU)\n\nAndrew Carr (13.5 PPG at Wake Forest)\n\nAmari Williams (12.2 PPG at Drexel)\n\n24. UCLA Bruins\n\nPrevious ranking: 24\n\nDec. 14 vs. Arizona in Phoenix: The fifth game on this list taking place on Dec. 14, to underscore how loaded that Saturday will be. Although UCLA and Arizona are no longer Pac-12 rivals, the two programs have scheduled a three-game series to take place over the next four seasons. Mick Cronin has also reloaded his roster to make sure there's no repeat of 2023-24.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nDylan Andrews (12.9 PPG)\n\nSebastian Mack (12.1 PPG)\n\nKobe Johnson (10.9 PPG at USC)\n\nLazar Stefanovic (11.5 PPG)\n\nTyler Bilodeau (14.3 PPG at Oregon State)\n\n25. Rutgers Scarlet Knights\n\nPrevious ranking: 25\n\nNov. 26-29 Players Era Festival: With the two best prospects in school history, Steve Pikiell centered his nonconference schedule on this tournament. The Scarlet Knights open with Notre Dame, then play Alabama and Houston. The talents of Airious Bailey and Dylan Harper will be on full display in Las Vegas.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nDylan Harper (No. 4 in ESPN 100)\n\nJeremiah Williams (12.2 PPG)\n\nJordan Derkack (17.0 PPG at Merrimack)\n\nAce Bailey (No. 2 in ESPN 100)\n\nZach Martini (8.4 PPG at Princeton)"
