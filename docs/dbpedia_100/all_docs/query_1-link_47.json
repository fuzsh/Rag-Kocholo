        "text": "THE GAME\n\nWHAT: New Orleans Bowl\n\nWHEN: noon Saturday\n\nWHERE: Superdome, New Orleans\n\nRECORDS: Troy (10-2), North Texas (9-4)\n\nON THE AIR: TV — ESPN; Radio — WTXK-FM 107.5, WTXK-1210, WACQ-FM 101.1, WACQ-AM 580\n\nLINE: Troy by 5 1/2\n\nTWITTER: @AStacyLong\n\nFOUR-DOWN TERRITORY\n\n1. Massive injuries: Troy receiver Emanuel Thompson, after breaking an arm in last year’s regular-season finale, was a star in Troy’s Dollar General Bowl win. Well, Thompson is following a lot of the script again, but not all of it. Thompson broke an arm in this year’s regular-season finale, but he won’t play in the New Orleans Bowl. He’s one of three starters set to miss the game, Brown said. Cornerback Blace Brown and safety Kris Weatherspoon are out. Receiver Tray Eafford will be “a game-time decision,” Brown said. The Trojans “lost” six guys in their win at Arkansas State two weeks ago. “We’re not going to be as healthy as we’d like to be,” Brown said. “The Arkansas State game was probably as freak a game, injury-wise, as I’ve seen.”\n\n2. Family ties: If it wasn’t for having to face each other in Saturday’s New Orleans Bowl, Brown and North Texas coach Seth Littrell would have spent time together on Bourbon Street this week. “We go a long ways back,” Brown said. “Our coaching tree is very similar.” The two have ties to the spread offense with Mike Leach and Tony Franklin between them. “We’ve been pretty good friends through coaching schools and different coaches we know,” Littrell said. “We’ve had that friendship over the years.” One of Littrell’s assistants has deep insight into Brown. North Texas passing game coordinator Tommy Mainord was under offensive coordinator Brown at North Texas from 2010-12 and Kentucky in 2013-14.\n\n3. Turnarounds: Both coaches have overseen major turnarounds early at their schools. After going 4-8 in Brown’s rookie season, Troy has reached double-figure wins in the last two years. North Texas was 1-11 two years ago before hiring Littrell. The Mean Green went 5-8 and played in the Heart of Dallas Bowl, losing in overtime to Army. “Our No. 1 goal this year was to win a bowl game,” Littrell said. “We didn’t do that last year. We had an opportunity against a quality team, and we came up short.”\n\n4. QB fun: Saturday’s game features two quarterbacks who have posted prodigious numbers. North Texas sophomore Mason Fine was Conference USA’s Offensive Player of the Year with 3,749 yards and 28 touchdowns passing. Troy senior Brandon Silvers sits at 2,985 yards and 13 TDs this year. Silvers sits second on the Trojans’ career list, while Fine is already sixth in yards and TDs.\n\nPLAYER OF THE WEEK\n\nMelvin Tyus\n\nS, 6-0, 212, So.\n\nWith Kris Weatherspoon out with an injury, Tyus appears in line to start for the first time in 10 games. Tyus, a G.W. Carver graduate, has 39 tackles this season.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n8-2: Troy’s all-time series lead against North Texas.\n\n12: Years North Texas spent as a member of the Sun Belt Conference. The Mean Green joined Conference USA starting in the 2013 football season.\n\n6, 4: Sun Belt championships won by the Trojans and Mean Green, respectively.\n\n14-7: Score of the team’s last meeting, a Troy victory in 2012 in Denton, Texas.\n\n2: Times the Trojans have been shut out since a 21-0 loss at North Texas in 2003.\n\n9: Previous times that Troy has played in a dome, including three times in the Superdome for the New Orleans Bowl. The others were at Georgia State and the Georgia Dome (2013, 2015), Idaho (2014, 2016), Minnesota (2003) and South Dakota (1986).\n\n2-1: The Trojans’ record in previous New Orleans Bowl appearances. They beat Rice 41-17 in 2006, lost to Southern Miss 30-27 in overtime in 2007 and beat Ohio 48-21 in 2010.\n\nPREDICTION"
