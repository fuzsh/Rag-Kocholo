        "text": "Share This:\n\nThe Aspire Group has expanded its presence in Conference USA by adding the North Texas Athletics Fan Relationship Management Center (FRMC) on the Denton, Texas campus, just north of Dallas. The FRMC, consisting of a manager and three sales consultants, is tasked with growing ticket revenues and attendance for Football along with Men’s and Women’s Basketball while maximizing fan engagement among the Mean Green community.\n\n“It was important that North Texas Athletics partner with a company that not only is the industry leader in revenue enhancement for universities and sports organizations, but the experts in conducting fan research studies and developing a customized Ticket Marketing, Sales and Service Plan” stated Paul Batchelder, Associate Athletic Director for North Texas.\n\nTo launch the partnership, The Aspire Group has conducted a comprehensive Mean Green fan study to analyze fan identification, satisfaction, and behaviors with North Texas Athletics. The findings from the study will be utilized to collaboratively create a Ticket Marketing, Sales and Service Plan that will guide the FRMC operation.\n\nThe North Texas Athletics FRMC Manager is A.J. Tomeny, previously a Senior Team Leader for the Buffalo FRMC. While managing the Buffalo FRMC, Tomeny oversaw $360,000 in revenue generation and sold one of the largest group sales at the University at Buffalo. The North Texas Athletics FRMC will use intelligent marketing and proactive sales techniques to lay the foundation for sustainable performance by generating a two way dialogue with Mean Green fans.\n\n“We recognize this is a critical time in the history of North Texas Athletics and we look forward to engaging the North Texas community in joining the Mean Green Family” stated The Aspire Group’s SVP & GM of Fan Relationship Management, Bill Fagan. “Conducting the Mean Green fan study will fuel intelligent fan marketing and service for North Texas Athletics fans.”\n\nThe North Texas Athletics FRMC has already begun selling for the upcoming football 2013-14 season in Apogee Stadium, a $78 million facility that opened in 2011. The home opener will be against Idaho on August 31 and will feature the celebration of 100-Years of North Texas football, including the recognition of an All-Century team which includes “Mean” Joe Greene.\n\nAbout The Aspire Group\n\nThe Aspire Group is a global sports and entertainment firm formed in 2008 by Dr. Bernie Mullin that partners with its clients to maximize revenue, people and organizational performance. Aspire provides ongoing strategic advice and implementation support in executing and maintaining highly innovative sales, marketing, management and operational systems. This is best embodied in the Fan Relationship Management Center, the fastest growing arm of the company, operating in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nFor more information visit www.theaspiregroupinc.com and follow @theaspire_group on Twitter.\n\nAbout The University of North Texas Athletics\n\nNorth Texas athletics is comprised of 18 varsity teams competing across 12 sports.
