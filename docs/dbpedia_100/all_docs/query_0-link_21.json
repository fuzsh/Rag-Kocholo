        "text": "The most successful walk-ons in recent college football history\n\nEver since ESPN's \"College GameDay\" preview show premiered for Notre Dame-Florida State in 1993, the pre-game show has traveled around the country at the top games each week. Find the complete rundown of every location below, most appearances and most times hosting, plus the eventual score for each game.\n\nAlong with featuring traditional powers such as Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State and more, the show has also visited FCS schools and even DIII. The preview show includes Rece Davis, Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit, among others, with Corso making his pick known by donning the headgear (or other related school item) of the winning team.\n\nCollege GameDay: Most appearances, times hosted\n\nOhio State has the most appearances with 59. Alabama is a close second with 58 appearances. But the Buckeyes have the most wins with GameDay in attendance, winning 40 games. Ohio State has also hosted the most times with 23.\n\nMost times hosting\n\nOhio State — 23\n\nAlabama — 18\n\nMichigan — 14\n\nFlorida, LSU — 13\n\nMost appearances\n\nOhio State — 59\n\nAlabama — 58\n\nFlorida — 42\n\nOklahoma — 40\n\nMichigan — 39\n\nNotre Dame, Georgia — 36\n\nFlorida State — 35\n\nMost wins\n\nOhio State — 40 (40-19 record)\n\nAlabama — 37 (37-21 record)\n\nOklahoma — 27 (27-13 record)\n\nFlorida — 26 (26-16 record)\n\nMichigan — 21 (21-18)\n\nLSU — 21 (21-13 record)\n\nHow accurate is Lee Corso? Meet the man who tracks his College GameDay picks\n\nFun oddities\n\nFCS North Dakota State has the best win percentage with at least two appearances; NDSU is 3-0.\n\nFor teams with at least five appearances, USC leads the nation in winning percentage. The Trojans are 18-6 in College GameDay games.\n\nOne DIII school has hosted: Williams for its 2007 game against Amherst.\n\nThough not held in consecutive weeks, Ohio State is the only school to play in three College GameDay games in the same season. In 1996, GameDay was at Ohio State's games against Notre Dame (29-16 win), Penn State (38-7 win) and Iowa (38-26 win).\n\nGeorgia Tech has the worst winning percentage. Though a bunch of schools are winless in GameDay appearances, the Yellow Jackets have the most without winning: 0-5.\n\nArmy has the most GameDay appearances for a school outside the Power Five (and not including Notre Dame). The Black Knights are 5-7, last hosting in 2020.\n\nCollege GameDay: Locations, all-time appearances\n\nHost schools are in bold. All rankings are from the AP Poll for that week.\n\n2024 season locations\n\nDate Location Game Aug. 24 Dublin, Ireland Florida State vs. Georgia Tech Aug. 31 College Station, TX Texas A&M vs. Notre
