        "text": "DENTON, Texasâ€”Riding a nine-game winning streak, Middle Tennessee looks to continue its recent surge Saturday at North Texas. Tipoff is set for 3:30 p.m. inside the Super Pit.\n\nThe game will be broadcasted on YouTube and the Blue Raider Network.\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\nMiddle Tennessee women's basketball dominated in every phase on Thursday night, getting contributions from a plethora of Lady Raiders on their way to an 80-41 win over UTSA at the Murphy Center.\n\nThe Lady Raiders (11-2, 4-0 C-USA) took control of the game in the second quarter, starting the quarter on a 13-0 run to power their way to a 42-22 advantage at halftime. UTSA (3-9, 1-2 C-USA) managed just one field goal in the quarter, turning the ball over six times as MTSU's press and defense off of screens have the Roadrunners nothing to attack. Courtney Blakely ended the first half with seven assists and no turnovers, three of those assists finding Jalynn Gregory for three.\n\nAttacking UTSA both inside (38 points in the paint) and outside (9-for-21 from three) of offense, MTSU held the Roadrunners to just 25.4 percent shooting from the field on defense, with an aggressive press and stout work on ball screens denying UTSA open looks all night.\n\nSix Lady Raiders finished the game with at least 10 points, led by 18 points off the bench from Kseniya Malashka. Blakely just missed out on a triple-double, scoring 11 points to go with 11 assists and eight rebounds. Anastasiia Boldyreva scored 16 points, hauled in nine rebounds and recorded a team-high four blocks.\n\nON THE COURT\n\nStat Leaders:\n\nPoints - Kseniya Malashka (16.9 PPG)\n\nRebounds - Courtney Whitson (8.0 RPG)\n\nAssists - Savannah Wheeler (3.7 APG)\n\nSteals - Jalynn Gregory (1.9 SPG)\n\nLADY RAIDER NOTES\n\nMiddle Tennessee moved up to 23rd in the NET rankings as of Jan. 6 and continue to receive votes in both the AP and USA Today Coaches Poll.\n\nMTSU is 123-35 vs. C-USA members since joining the league prior to the 2013-14 season. The 123 wins are the most of any league member during this span.\n\nMiddle Tennessee leads all of Conference USA and ranks 26th in the nation with a 18.7 scoring margin.\n\nThe current nine-game winning streak ties for the longest by a Lady Raider team since MTSU won nine in a row from Jan. 21 to Feb. 21, 2016.\n\nAfter a nine-block performance vs. UTSA, Middle Tennessee leads C-USA and ranks 44th nationally in overall blocks per game (4.5). Also on the defensive end, the Lady Raiders are holding opponents to a league-low 35.2 percent from the field (overall), which is 28th in the country.\n\nAt the free throw line, MTSU is one of the top teams in not only getting to the line, but making free throws, as well. The Lady Raiders rank third in the nation in free throws made per game (18.5), 10th in free throw percentage (78.7 percent) and 13th in attempts per game (23.5).\n\nSCOUTING THE MEAN GREEN\n\nNorth Texas is led by Conference USA's leading scorer Quincy Noble. The 5-10 guard out of McKinney Texas, is averaging 18.5 points overall and 20.3 points in conference play.\n\nNoble is joined by Tommisha Lampkin, who is averaging a league-best 8.1 rebounds per game and is second in the conference to Kseniya Malashka in blocks per game with 1.64.\n\nThe Mean Green are holding teams to 29.3 percent shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#1 Courtney Blakely\n\nG\n\n5' 8\"\n\nSophomore\n\nSO-1L\n\n#2 Anastasiia Boldyreva\n\nC\n\n6' 6\"\n\nSophomore\n\nSO-1L\n\n#10 Jalynn Gregory\n\nG\n\n5' 8\"\n\nSophomore\n\nSO-1L\n\n#5 Kseniya Malashka\n\nF\n\n6' 0\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\nr-Sr-TR\n\n#33 Courtney Whitson\n\nF\n\n6' 0\"\n\nJunior\n\nJR-3L\n\n#4 Savannah Wheeler\n\nG\n\n5' 6\"\n\nJunior\n\nJR-3L"
