        "text": "Article Courtesy of Phil Hicks, Tyler Morning Telegraph\n\nA talented passing and scoring threat, Eaglin ranked third in the country among all NJCAA players last season with 7.6 assists per game, yet still averaged 15.2 points per game. He tallied eight games with at least 10 assists, including four outings with 12 assists. A threat from the perimeter, the sophomore sank 51 3-pointers on a 39.8 percent clip.\n\nIn his biggest scoring output of the season against Panola College, Eaglin racked up 42 points on 7-of-10 shooting from 3-point range. On the year he averaged 3.7 rebounds per game.\n\nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, Todd Eaglin and his family were forced to evacuate the Crescent City.\n\nEaglin's life was turned upside down.\n\nThe family eventually settled in the Houston area, and Eaglin grew to love his new surroundings.\n\nSince leaving Louisiana, Eaglin's journey has taken him from The Woodlands Christian Academy to Tyler Junior College. And now he will head to Denton, as the Apaches' standout point guard signed a basketball letter of intent to attend the University of North Texas.\n\n\"I'm thankful Coach (Mike) Marquis gave me an opportunity,\" said Eaglin, who was a standout in baseball, football and basketball in high school. \"Coach Mike is a really great guy. He has helped me through this whole process. I can't thank him enough. Coach Marquis' main goal is for us to get our degree.\n\n\"Coming here has made me a harder worker. In high school, everything was kind of given to me, but at TJC you had to work.\"\n\nEaglin also received interest from New Mexico and New Mexico State before picking the Mean Green.\n\nWhile Eaglin's family eventually moved back to Louisiana, he elected to stay in Texas.\n\n\"I still have family in Louisiana, but I was blessed to be placed in a home with my new family â€” the Moras. They are great people; great people to be around,\" Eaglin said of Rick and Gina Mora, who served as his guardians.\n\nHe said the whole experience with the Moras, The Woodlands Christian Academy and TJC have greatly influence his life.\n\n\"I have become more confident and more of a leader,\" Eaglin said. \"It has made me a better player and a better person.\"\n\nMarquis discovered Eaglin playing for the TAPPS school.\n\n\"Todd is the perfect example of what Tyler Junior College can do for an athlete and student,\" Marquis said. \"Todd came to TJC as a walk-on. He put in two hard years of work. Todd was about loyalty, and dedicated to getting better. It's a credit to the administration and staff; Todd is going to graduate and will get to play at a Division I school.\"\n\nEaglin was named All-Region XIV second team.\n\nHe earned TAPPS all-state first-team honors as a senior at The Woodlands Christian High School in 2011-12, and earned an honorable mention selection as a junior. A versatile athlete, Eaglin was considered a Division I prospect in baseball as a shortstop and on the football field as a quarterback.\n\n\"We couldn't be more excited to have Todd coming on board our program,\" UNT head basketball coach Tony Benford said. \"He's a character kid, and a true point guard with excellent leadership skills. At the same time, he can really shoot and score the basketball. He's been very well coached by Mike Marquis at Tyler Junior College, who I and Scott Monarch have always enjoyed a great relationship with.\"\n\n- See more at: http://www.etfinalscore.com/ET-Basketball/198301/tjcs-eaglin-signs-with-north-texas#sthash.0OvpDswF.dpuf"
