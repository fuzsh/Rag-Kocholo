        "text": "Game Notes In PDF Format\n\nTHE OPENING TIP\n\nThe UTEP women's basketball team (15-13, 8-9 C-USA) will wrap up the regular season when it plays at North Texas (11-18, 5-12 C-USA) at 6 p.m. MT/7 p.m. CT Saturday. The contest will be streamed by CUSA.tv (subscription based). It will also be broadcast locally in El Paso on 600 ESPN El Paso withDuke Keith andTraci Milleron the call. The Miners are coming off an 82-59 defeat at league-leading Rice on March 5. The Mean Green had a two-game winning streak snapped in a 74-63 loss at Middle Tennessee on March 5. North Texas is 8-7 at home (3-5 C-USA). UTEP is 3-7 on the road (2-6 C-USA). The Miners are alone at seventh place in the league at 8-9, while the Mean Green are 12th at 5-12. UTEP is in search of a season sweep, having rallied past UNT, 67-63 on Jan. 25.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH FOR\n\nUTEP can lock up its second winning season in three years underKevin Baker with a win at North Texas ... he'd become just the second UTEP coach (Carol Ammerman) in history to do so ... a victory would also seal the No. 7 seed for the Miners at the upcoming 2020 C-USA Championships ...Katia Gallegos(142 assists) is tied with Shalana Taylor (2004-05) for the most assists in a season by a freshman in program history ... her next helper will set the freshman record at the school and also allow her sole possession of fifth place regardless of class on the list ...Ariona Gill has hit double figures in scoring in nine of the past 10 games.\n\nHE SAID IT (COACH BAKER ON NORTH TEXAS)\n\n\"North Texas has been playing some great basketball as of late. We know that they will give us a great game on their 'Senior Night.' The last time we played it was a great game and went down to the wire. This game will be no different. We will need to play well to beat them at home and build momentum for the conference tournament.\"\n\nREVISITING THE C-USA PRESEASON POLL\n\nThe Miners exceeded expectations based on upon the Conference USA Coaches' Preseason Poll. UTEP enters the regular-season finale at 8-9 in the league and alone in seventh place. It was tabbed to finish 12th according to a vote by the league's head coaches in the preseason. For perspective, North Texas sits in 12th place at 5-12 in C-USA action.\n\nWHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES\n\nIn 2018-19 the Miners were decimated by injuries and finished the year at 9-22, including 5-11 in C-USA action. It has been a much different story this year, with UTEP (15-13, 8-9 C-USA) having surpassed both its overall and conference win total from a year ago.\n\nBIG WINS\n\nTen of UTEP's victories have been by double figures,including seven of at least 20 points. It is the most wins by 20+ points since 2013-14 (nine). The Miners had their largest differential (+45) under head coachKevin Baker in a 92-47 drubbing of Alcorn State (11/16/19), which tied as the 10th-biggest margin of victory in program history. They've also taken down UTSA (1/18/20) by 40 (94-54), Florida Atlantic (1/4/20) by 31 (96-65), FIU (1/2/20) by 30 (64-34), Western Michigan (11/29) by 30 (76-46), at UTSA by 26 (85-59) and NM State (11/23/19) by 20 (64-45). Overall UTEP's scoring margin (+6.5) is sixth in C-USA and 104th in the country.\n\nTALKING 30+ POINT WINS IN CONFERENCE\n\nUTEP has three wins by at least 30 points in league play, which is the most such victories in a single season in program history. In fact the Miners had achieved the feat seven times total prior to this year, with the 2003-04 team (twice) previously holding the standard for a single season.\n\nFINDING ANOTHER WAY TO WIN\n\nThe Miners' first four league wins were by an average of 29.5 points, but UTEP showed it has the ability to take care of business in a close contest against North Texas. The Miners rallied from a 10-point deficit on the way to holding off the Mean Green, 67-63, on Jan. 25. It also marked the first time this season that the Orange and Blue overcame deficits at the half (down five) and through three quarters (down three) to win a game. UTEP also was involved in a nail biter in its 82-76 OT victory against Charlotte on Feb. 6. The Miners trailed by four with two minutes to play in the contest before rallying to force OT.\n\nGAME FORMAT\n\nNCAA women's basketball games are played in four 10-minute quarters. Teams reach the bonus and shoot two free throws on the fifth team foul in each quarter. In the four-quarter format, team fouls reset to zero at the start of each frame. Teams have four timeouts (three 30s, one 60), three of which carry over to the second half. They will be able to advance the ball to the frontcourt after a timeout with less than 59.9 seconds in 4Q. There are seven media timeouts (four under five minutes in quarter/first called), two intermission media timeouts (after first and third quarters) and the first team-called timeout during the second half. Bands or amplified music may play during any dead ball.\n\nGET TO KNOW NORTH TEXAS (11-18, 5-12; 8-7 HOME; 3-9 ROAD; 0-2 NEUTRAL)\n\nNorth Texas enters Saturday's regular-season finale at 11-18 on the season, including 5-12 in C-USA action. The Mean Green were 3-4 through seven contests in league action before losing seven in a row. They got back on track with consecutive wins before falling at Middle Tennessee, 74-63, last time out on March 15. Post player Anisha George paces the team in scoring (14.2 ppg-10th C-USA) and rebounding (8.8 rpg-fifth C-USA/74th NCAA). George has been a difference maker in offensive rebounding, grabbing 4.1 offensive boards per contest (third/16th). George is shooting 63.4 percent from the floor to pace C-USA and check in sixth nationally. She is also fifth in the league for blocked shots per game (1.3). Eight other players pitch in at least 5.0 ppg, helping UNT account for 65.5 ppg. UNT is among the C-USA leaders and top-100 nationally for rebounds per game (40.5-second/51st) and fewest turnovers per game (14.3 fourth/78th). North Texas entered this year with back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since a four-year stretch from 1998-02 when current head coach Jalie Mitchell was starring for the squad as a four-time All-Sun Belt honoree. Notable North Texas alumni include \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin (professional wrestler), Jeff Coffin (Jazz saxophones member of Dave Matthews band) and \"Mean\" Joe Green (NFL Hall of Famer).\n\nTHE SERIES (OVERALL: UTEP LEADS, 9-5; IN DENTON: NORTH TEXAS LEADS, 5-3)\n\nUTEP leads the series against North Texas, 9-5, including a 6-3 advantage against the Mean Green as members of Conference USA. UNT does have a 5-3 cushion when the two squads square off in Denton. The Miners rallied to best UNT, 67-63, in the first meeting on the year between the programs on Jan. 25. The two squads first squared off during the 1980-81 season.\n\nLAST MEETING WITH NORTH TEXAS: AT UTEP 67, NORTH TEXAS 63 1/25/20\n\nFrom the 6-minute mark in the first quarter until 11 seconds were left in the fourth, North Texas had a firm grip on the lead over UTEP, but the Miners rallied in the final moments to steal a 67-63 victory from the Mean Green on Jan. 25 at the Don Haskins Center. Ninety seconds into the game, UTEP had a 4-3 lead over North Texas. From that point until 11 seconds remaining in the game, the Miners trailed the Mean Green untilAriona Gill's tip-in gave UTEP a 65-63 advantage and its first lead since early in the first quarter. Gill also sunk the And-1 to give the Miners a 66-63 lead with 11 seconds left in the game. Katarina Zec, who went off for 18 points in the second half after being silenced in the first, also added a free throw with three seconds remaining to clinch the 67-63 victory for UTEP. The Miners shot just 14 percent (2-14) in the opening frame, but never shot below 40 percent the rest of the way, finishing the game 23-of-47 from the field in the final three quarters. North Texas led UTEP for more than 30 minutes in the game, including a 27-22 lead for the Mean Green at the halfway point, but the Miners fought back to outscore UNT 45-36 in the final two frames. Defensively, UTEP entered the game ranked first in C-USA in turnovers forced and lived up to that ranking after forcing 23 Mean Green turnovers, including 15 in the first half.\n\nGOING BACK IN TIME (aT RICE 82, UTEP 59, 3/5/20\n\nAriona Gill (19 points),Katia Gallegos (15 points) andKatarina Zec (11 points) hit double figures in scoring but homestanding Rice used a barrage of 3-pointers to topple UTEP, 82-59, at Tudor Fieldhouse on March 5. The Miners used a 7-0 run to pull even at 48 midway through the third quarter before the Owls wrapped a 15-1 run around the quarter break to pull away for good. Zec pulled down a team-high and career-best tying nine rebounds to flirt with a double-double while Gallegos dished out a squad-best three assists. Gallegos now has 142 assists on the season, which tiesShalana Taylor (2004-05) for the UTEP freshman single-season record. UTEP connected on 42.0 percent (21-50) from the floor and forced 21 turnovers that led to 24 points, but Rice overcame that through sharp shooting and a big night on the glass. The Owls nailed 51.8 percent (29-56) from the floor, including making a season-best 12 triples on 23 attempts (52.2 percent). Rice also had a 39-23 advantage on the boards, which led to a 18-2 differential on second-chance points. The Owls were led by Erica Ogwumike with game highs in points (24) and rebounds (16). Sydne Wiggins (18 points) and Lauren Schwartz (14 points) also hit double figures for scoring for Rice, who dished out 22 assists on 29 field goals made.\n\nD-UP\n\nUTEP is getting after it on defense in 2019-20, ranking among the league and national leaders for multiple defensive categories. The Miners lead C-USA and are 32nd nationally in turnovers forced per game (19.6). They are also in the upper half of the league with 3-point field-goal percentage defense (30.5-seventh/134th). All of those figures were aided when UTEP set the program record for fewest points allowed in a conference contest by holding FIU to 34 points on Jan. 2.\n\nYOUTH+EXPERIENCE IN STARTING LINEUP\n\nUTEP has turned to its underclassmen to comprise 60 percent of the starting lineup for 20 of 28 contests on the year. FreshmanKatia Gallegos has started all 28 games, with fellow classmateAvery Crouse (27 starts) earning all but one. SophomoresAriana Taylor(10 starts) andSabine Lipe (eight starts) have also been in the line-up, along with freshmanArina Khlopkova(four starts). SeniorsAriona Gill (27 starts) andKatarina Zec (28 starts) have been the other fixtures for UTEP's starting five. JuniorMichelle Pruitt (eight starts) has also been among the starting five numerous times.\n\nZEC'S GAME GOING STRONG\n\nSeniorKatarina Zechas been a consistent performer across the board for the Miners in 2019-20, including pouring in a career-high tying 22 points against ODU on Feb. 8. Overall she leads the team in scoring (12.9 ppg) and minutes played (31.8 mpg) while starting all 28 games. Zec also paces the unit for 3-pointers made (40) and attempted (111). Dating to the end of last season, she has hit double figures in scoring in 34 of the past 40 contests, helping her join the UTEP 1,000+ points club. She enters Saturday's regular-season finale with 1,103 points to rate eighth all time at UTEP.\n\nBALANCED SCORING\n\nKatarina Zectops the team in scoring (12.9 ppg), but she is not the only capable scorer on the roster. Five other players are pitching in at least 5.0 ppg. They are in the form ofAriona Gill(11.8 ppg),Katia Gallegos(9.8 ppg),Avery Crouse(7.6 ppg),Ariana Taylor(6.6) andMichelle Pruitt(5.7 ppg). The balanced effort has played a big role in UTEP accounting for 70.6 points per game, which is fourth in C-USA and 70th in the country.\n\nSHARING THE ROCK\n\nFreshmanKatia Gallegoshas settled into the role as starting point guard, and is playing beyond her years. She has dished out 142 assists (tied fifth on UTEP single-season list & tied UTEP freshman single-season record) while committing 82 turnovers in 29.8 minutes per game. The El Paso native leads C-USA and is 31st nationally for assists per game (5.1). She is also third in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.7). Overall, UTEP's 15.2 assists per game places second in the league and 49th nationally.\n\nGILL KEYING EFFORT ON THE BOARDS\n\nUTEP has a +3.1 rebounding margin (fifth C-USA/101st NCAA), withAriona Gill(8.6 rpg-sixth C-USA/86th NCAA) setting the tone. She has grabbed at least 10 boards in 10 games, including posting the second most by a Miner in a road game and tying for the fifth most in program history with 18 boards in the win at UTSA on Feb. 20. The team's leading scorerKatarina Zec(5.2 rpg) and No. 3 scorerKatia Gallegos(4.8 rpg) have also been helping out on the glass. Overall UTEP's total of 1,115 rebounds is fourth in the league and 135th nationally.\n\nGIVE ME THAT BALL\n\nUTEP's full-court pressure defense has given the opposition fits, with foes making 19.6 turnovers per contest (first C-USA/32nd NCAA). UTEP has converted those into 18.4 points per game.Katia Gallegos(48 steals),Ariona Gill(37 steals),Katarina Zec(34 steals) andAvery Crouse(29 steals) lead the way with each tallying more steals than total games played.\n\nDEFENDING THE 3-BALL\n\nUTEP has kept opponents 30.5 percent on 3-point percentage, which is seventh in the league and 134th in the nation. Twelve foes have been held to less than 28 percent from distance, including five below 10 percent.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW THE 2019-20 MINERS\n\nThe Miners returned three starters and seven letter winners from a year ago, including senior guard/forwardKatarina Zec(10.1 ppg/4.4 rpg/1.9 apg), senior guard/forwardAriona Gill (8.7 ppg/4.4 rpg), sophomore forwardAriana Taylor (5.9 ppg), senior guard/forwardJade Rochelle (4.0 ppg/4.7 rpg), senior guardNeidy Ocuane (4.0 ppg/1.8 apg) and sophomore guardSabine Lipe (3.2 ppg and 2.3 rpg).

It was a back-and-forth game with five ties and five lead changes, with the Miners ripping off seven straight points midway through the fourth quarter to turn a one-point deficit into a six-point advantage (63-57). The Lady Eagles could get no closer than four the rest of the way, with UTEP closing out the contest in style. The 12 assists by Gallegos were one shy of the UTEP single-game record and tied for third-most in a contest by a Miner. Her seven steals earned her a share for seventh for UTEP's single-game charts. The Miners shot 48.3 percent (28-58) from the floor, piled up 22 assists on 28 field goals made, while forcing 23 turnovers that led to 24 points. That effort allowed UTEP to offset being outrebounded by 13 (43-30).

All four seniors for UTEP played, with Zec leading the quartet with 17 points, two assists, two rebounds and two steals.Jade Rochelle came off the bench to provide five points and a team-best seven boards in only six minutes, whileAriona Gillfought through foul trouble to contribute five rebounds.Neidy Ocuane, who has been sidelined since the fourth game of the year with an injury, played in the final minute of the contest. But on a day when the seniors were honored, it was the freshmen that showed UTEP has a bright future as well. Crouse, Gallegos and Khlopkova combined for 41 points, seven rebounds, 14 assists and nine steals to make contributions across the board.\n\nMT 92, at UTEP 80, 2/22/20)\n\nSeniorsKatarina ZecandAriona Gill each scored 16 points to pace a quintet of players in double figures, but Middle Tennessee used a barrage of 3-pointers and drives to the basket to slip past UTEP, 92-80, at the Don Haskins Center on Feb. 22. The Miners led by nine (15-6) early on in the contest, but once the Lady Raiders heated up the visitors were able to come back to spoil UTEP's upset bid. MT nailed 12 three pointers, compared to four from UTEP, while shooting 47.8 percent overall (32-67) to shoot past the Orange and Blue. UTEP was a solid 41.4 percent (29-70) from the floor, but just 4-19 (21.1 percent) from 3-point range. UTEP tried to compensate for that by winning the boards (44-41) and forcing 19 turnovers, but MT's firepower was too much. Anastasia Hayes (24 points) Aislynn Hayes (20 points), Alexis Whittington (20 points) and Taylor Sutton (15 points) combined for 79 points to lead the way for the visitors. Whittington did the majority of her damage from 3-point range, connecting on six of the team's 12 treys. Yet in spite of that, the Orange and Blue trailed by four (81-77) with 4:38 remaining in regulation after a jumper from Zec. MT responded by closing the contest on an 11-3 run to stem UTEP's rally bid. FreshmanKatia Gallegos filled up the stat sheet with 10 points, seven assists and six rebounds whileAvery Crouse (13 points) andSabine Lipe(11 points) also hit double figures in scoring. Gill led the charge on the boards with a game-high tying nine rebounds, while Gallegos and Zec each secured six. UTEP did a solid job at the free-throw line by nailing 78.3 percent (18-23).\n\nUTEP 85, at UTSA 59, 2/20/20\n\nAvery Crouse poured in a career-high 21 points,Ariona Gill posted a monstrous double-double (17 points, 18 rebounds), andKatia Gallegos (17 points, seven rebounds, seven assists) andMichelle Pruitt (14 points) also got after it as UTEP used a huge fourth quarter to post a convincing 85-59 win at UTSA on Feb. 20. Gill's 18 boards are the second most in a road game by a Miner, in addition to tying as the fifth-highest total ever in program history. The Miners (14-11, 7-7 C-USA) led by four (56-52) after 30 minutes of action before outscoring the Roadrunners (6-19, 2-12 C-USA) 29-7 in the fourth quarter to cruise to the road victory and get back to even in league play. UTEP won the boards (46-36), forced 22 turnovers that led to 28 points, piled up 56 points in the paint and shot a solid 45.0 percent (36-80). UTSA was a respectable 40.7 percent (22-54) from the floor, but it was held to just 20 percent shooting during the decisive final frame. Conversely, the Orange and Blue connected on 65 percent (13-20) over the final 10 minutes of action. UTEP shared the ball effectively by piling up 20 assists while committing only eight turnovers. Gallegos keyed the charge with seven helpers, while Katarina Zec dished out a quartet of assists and Crouse added three. The Miners piled up 22 offensive boards, with 10 of Gill's career-best 18 rebounds coming at that end.\n\nAT MARSHALL 76, UTEP 66, 2/15/20\n\nAriona Gill (21 points, eight boards) had another big day, but UTEP was tripped up at Marshall, 76-66, on Feb. 15. The Miners (13-11, 6-7 C-USA) shot 39.3 percent from the floor, won the boards (35-27) and took decent care of the ball (15 turnovers) only to have the Thundering Herd (11-13, 6-7 C-USA) overcome that with hot shooting. MU nailed 55.1 percent from the floor, including 11-24 (45.8 percent) from 3-point range. The Thundering Herd had entered the contest last in C-USA in field-goal percentage (.362), but managed to get going on all aspects Saturday. It spoiled the effort by Gill, who hit double figures in scoring for the sixth straight contest. She was buoyed by the all-around effort ofKatia Gallegos (12 points, five rebounds, five assists).Katarina Zec (12 points, five boards) also got after it, whileAvery Crouse pitched in seven points and four helpers. MU plated four in double figures, with Kristen Mayo (17 points) leading the way for the home side. UTEP had an 18-4 margin in second-chance points, in addition to advantages in points in the paint (30-26) and points off turnovers (17-12), but it wasn't enough to offset the Thundering Herd.\n\nAT WKU 78, UTEP 65, 2/13/20\n\nAriona Gill (19 points) andMichelle Pruitt (career-high 17 points) both had big scoring nights, but UTEP's valiant comeback bid fell short in a 78-65 setback at WKU on Feb. 13. The Miners (13-10, 6-6 C-USA) trailed by 27 (44-17) with 3:29 to play in the first half, but they made the Lady Toppers (17-7, 9-3 C-USA) sweat by fighting back to get within five (66-61) with 2:45 remaining in regulation. Included in that was an 11-0 run to close the first half, setting the stage for the second half. The Orange and Blue couldn't complete the rally, with WKU doing just enough to hold on for the win. Pruitt was a perfect 8-8 from the floor to post the seventh contest in program history with 100.0 percent shooting percentage (min. seven attempts).Katia Gallegos added nine points, seven boards and four assists, whileKatarina Zec had seven points and seven rebounds.Sabine Lipe pitched in seven points and four assists. UTEP shook off a sluggish start to connect on 50.0 percent (28-56) from the floor, but it was hindered by committing 19 turnovers that led to 23 points for the home side. WKU opened up the game by making 57.9 percent (11-19) to lead by 15 (26-11) through 10 minutes of action. UTEP held the Lady Toppers to below 40 percent in each of the final three frames, but WKU still finished at 42.9 percent (30-70) from the floor. It also did a good job against UTEP's vaunted press, with the Orange and Blue forcing 12 giveaways. UTEP was aggressive in getting to the hole, piling up 52 points in the paint compared to 36 by WKU. But ultimately the slow start to the game proved too much to overcome.\n\nPRUITT's PERFECT NIGHT\n\nMichelle Pruitt had a perfect shooting night at WKU, finishing 8-8 from the floor on the way to tallying a career-high 17 points. She became the first Miner in 17 years and seventh all time to shoot 100% from the floor (min. seven FGA). Pruitt, though, is the first Miner to do so on the road.\n\nODU 77, AT UTEP 69, 2/8/20\n\nKatarina Zec poured in a career-high tying 22 points andAriona Gill (13 points, nine boards) andKatia Gallegos (11 points, seven assists, six rebounds) also got after it, but UTEP was tripped up by Old Dominion, 77-68, at the Don Haskins Center on Feb. 8. It was a back-and-forth contest with seven lead changes and eight ties. The Miners led by three (60-57) with 7:55 to play before the Monarchs (20-3, 10-1 C-USA) scored six straight-on back-to-back triples by Victoria Morris- to put UTEP down by three (63-60). UTEP continued to battle but could not pull back ahead, with the Monarchs making enough plays down the stretch to hold off the Orange and Blue.Sabine Lipe pitched in eight points in her second straight start, whileAriana Taylor provided a boost from the bench with six points and six rebounds. But it was Zec who stole the show for the home side, particularly over the first 10 minutes. Zec tallied 16 points, the second most in a frame in UTEP history, by going 6-7 from the floor (3-3 on triples) in the first quarter. UTEP shot 39.3 percent (24-61) from the floor and had 15 assists to 13 turnovers. The Miners also won the boards (42-41), but the Monarchs overcame that. Morris and Amari Young each scored 23 points to pace a trio of players in double figures for ODU. Morris was deadly from distance with seven triples, including the consecutive treys during the fourth quarter.\n\nAT UTEP 82, CHARLOTTE 76, 2/6/20\n\nAriona Gill posted a monstrous double-double (career-high 25 points, career-high tying 14 rebounds),Katarina Zec scored 13 points to surpass 1,000 career points andKatia Gallegos (13 points) andSabine Lipe (career-best 12 points) also hit double figures in scoring as UTEP outlasted Charlotte, 82-76, in overtime at the Don Haskins Center on Feb. 6. The Miners raced out to a 17-point (38-21) first-half lead only to have the 49ers strike back to take a four-point advantage (64-60) with 1:50 to play in regulation. UTEP didn't flinch, peeling off seven straight points to pull back ahead by three (67-64) with 27 seconds left. After Charlotte tied the game with a triple from Octavia Jett-Wilson with 22 seconds remaining, both sides got defensive stops to send the contest to OT. Each team connected on a triple on its opening possession of OT before UTEP kicked it into high gear. The Miners ripped off 10 straight points over the next three minutes, effectively putting the contest away. Charlotte made a push with six consecutive points to get within four (80-76) with 32 seconds left, but a pair of UTEP free throws iced the tilt.\n\nAT UAB 63, UTEP 51, 2/1/20\n\nAvery Crouse(11 points),Katarina Zec (11 points) andAriona Gill (10 points) all hit double figures in scoring, but an off shooting day loomed large in UTEP's 63-51 setback at UAB on Feb. 1. The Miners finished at 29.5 percent from the floor (18-61), which was hindered by shooting 18.5 percent (5-27) over the first 20 minutes. The Blazers capitalized, putting UTEP in a 17-point hole (36-19) at the half. The Miners fought back after the break to get within eight (55-47) with four minutes left, but they couldn't complete the comeback. The nation's second-best 3-point shooting team lived up to its billing by connecting on 43.5 percent (10-23) from beyond-the-arc. Overall UAB finished at 47.1 percent (24-51) from the floor. Rachel Childress was the catalyst with 26 points on 10-13 shooting, including 4-5 from distance. Still UTEP's defensive efforts were to be lauded after holding the top scoring offense in the league to 15 points shy of its seasonal average (78).\n\nAT MIDDLE TENNESSEE 76, UTEP 60, 1/30/20\n\nAriona Gillposted a double-double (20 points, 12 rebounds), but UTEP dug itself an early hole and could never recover in a 76-60 setback at Middle Tennessee on Jan. 30. The Miners trailed by four (14-10) late in the opening frame before the Lady Raiders unleashed a game-altering 17-0 run that carried into the second quarter to put UTEP down by 21 (31-10). The Miners battled back to get within 14 at the half (41-27) and then within seven (65-58) in the fourth quarter, but MT was able to hold off the rally. UTEP finished at 37.1 percent from the floor, including 21.1 percent (4-19) on 3-point tosses. An off night (10-20, 50 percent) at the charity stripe and 24 turnovers also affected the outcome.Avery Crouse buoyed Gill with nine points and a career-best nine boards.Katarina Zecpitched in eight points and a career-high tying nine rebounds.Tia Bradshaw led the effort from the reserves with a career-high tying eight points to go along with a personal-best five caroms. The Miners kept MT to 39.7 percent (23-58), including 28.6 percent (6-21) from 3-point range. MT compensated for that by going 24-29 (82.8 percent) at the free-throw line. UTEP won the boards (49-33), but it wasn't enough to make up for other discrepancies.\n\nAT UTEP 67, NORTH TEXAS 63 1/25/20\n\nFrom the 6-minute mark in the first quarter until 11 seconds were left in the fourth, North Texas had a firm grip on the lead over UTEP, but the Miners rallied in the final moments to steal a 67-63 victory from the Mean Green on Jan. 25 at the Don Haskins Center. Ninety seconds into Saturday's game, UTEP had a 4-3 lead over North Texas. From that point until 11 seconds remaining in the game, the Miners trailed the Mean Green untilAriona Gill'stip-in gave UTEP a 65-63 advantage and its first lead since early in the first quarter. Gill also sunk the And-1 to give the Miners a 66-63 lead with 11 seconds left in the game. Katarina Zec, who went off for 18 points in the second half after being silenced in the first, also added a free throw with three seconds remaining to clinch the 67-63 victory for UTEP. The Miners shot just 14 percent (2-14) in the opening frame, but never shot below 40 percent the rest of the way, finishing the game 23-of-47 from the field in the final three quarters. North Texas led UTEP for more than 30 minutes in the game, including a 27-22 lead for the Mean Green at the halfway point, but the Miners fought back to outscore UNT 45-36 in the final two frames. Defensively, UTEP entered the game ranked first in C-USA in turnovers forced and lived up to that ranking after forcing 23 Mean Green turnovers, including 15 in the first half.\n\nRICE 69, AT UTEP 61 1/23/20\n\nAriana Taylor,Avery Crouse andAriona Gill all tallied 11 points, but UTEP fell to league-leading Rice, 69-61, at the Don Haskins Center on Jan. 23. It is the first C-USA setback at home for the Miners, who battled but ultimately saw the Owls post their 26th straight win against Conference USA competition. Gill added a team-high eight rebounds to nearly finish with a double-double despite playing only 16 minutes due to being plagued with fouls.Katia Gallegos stuffed the stat sheet with five points, seven rebounds and five assists.Katarina Zecpitched in nine points and five rebounds. The Miners forced 21 turnovers and won the boards, 42-39, but it wasn't enough to compensate for finishing at 33.3 percent (23-69) from the floor. Rice's 13 blocked shots, including nine alone from 6-9 Nancy Mulkey, impacted UTEP's shooting percentage. Another factor was UTEP finishing 10-18 at the charity stripe (55.6 percent) compared to the Owls going 20-28 (71.4 percent) at the line. It was a game of runs, with UTEP using a 7-0 push early in the fourth quarter to get within four (52-48). Rice countered with nine straight points, and the Miners were unable to get closer than six the rest of the contest.\n\nAT UTEP 94, UTSA 54, 1/18/20\n\nUTEP flexed its muscle at both ends of the court by drilling UTSA, 94-54, at home on Jan. 18. The 40-point win is the third biggest in a conference game in program history. The Miners came out firing, outpacing the Roadrunners by 27 (55-28) at the half. It marked the largest halftime lead in a league contest at the school. The 55 points over the first 20 minutes tied as the second most in first-half action in program annals.

For the second time in two weeks, the Miners scored 90+ points without having an individual player tally more than 15 points. UTEP also did so in the 96-65 romp of Florida Atlantic (1/4/20). Prior to this season, the feat had never been achieved at the school. UTEP shot 50.7 percent (37-73) from the floor and piled up its most assists (25) against a DI opponent in six years. Gallegos (10) andTia Bradshaw (four) both set career highs for helpers. The Miners also got 48 points from their bench to nearly match UTSA's overall output. At the other end of the court the Orange and Blue held the Roadrunners to 32.3 percent (21-65) shooting, in addition to forcing 21 turnovers that were converted into 24 points. UTEP crushed UTSA on the boards (53-34), while also having a huge advantage for points in the paint (53-32). All 12 Miners who played scored at least three points.\n\nAT LA TECH 87, UTEP 80, 1/11/20\n\nUTEP shot 47.9 percent (23-48) from the floor and nailed a season-high 10 triples, but it sustained its first Conference USA loss of the year in an 87-80 setback at LA Tech on Jan. 11. The Miners were hurt by committing 28 turnovers and allowing the Lady Techsters to drill 53.8 percent (28-52) from the floor, including 50.0 percent (11-22) from 3-point range. FreshmanKatia Gallegos flirted with a double-double (15 points, seven assists) to pace a trio of players in double figures.Katarina Zec (13 points) andAriana Taylor (11 points) buoyed her, whileSabine Lipe (nine points, three assists) andJade Rochelle (eight points, two assists) led the efforts off the pine. It was a seesaw battle with 11 ties and 14 lead changes. The game was knotted at 71 with 9:34 to play before LA Tech took control with an 8-0 surge. The Miners battled back, trimming the margin to three (81-78) after a Zec free throw with 3:19 remaining. That was as close as they would get, with the Lady Techsters staving off every remaining push from the Orange and Blue to improve to 8-2 on the year at home.\n\nUTEP 89, AT SOUTHERN MISS 72, 1/9/20\n\nFueled by the highest scoring first half on the road in program history, UTEP surged to an 89-72 win at Southern Miss on Jan. 9. The Miners' 89 points tie as the most in league road contest in school history. They also did so in an 89-74 win at UCF on Feb. 24, 2008. UTEP piled up 51 points to lead the Lady Eagles by 20 at the break on the way to their third victory in as many league games. It marked just the second home loss of the campaign for USM, which slipped to 8-2 inside Reed Green Coliseum this year.

UTEP also controlled the boards (39-28), with Taylor's career-high nine rebounds setting the tone in the area.\n\nAT UTEP 96, FLORIDA ATLANTIC 65, 1/4/20\n\nUTEP bolted out to the largest halftime lead in a conference game in program history on the way to drilling Florida Atlantic, 96-65, at the Don Haskins Center on Jan. 4. The Miners led by 22 (47-25) at the break and never let the Owls back into the game as they improved to 2-0 in league play for the first time since 2016.

The Miners committed 16 of their 22 turnovers in the first half and finished 13-25 at the charity stripe. UTEP connected on 34.0 percent (18-53) from the floor, which was hindered by going 2-11 (18.2 percent) in the final frame. Yet in spite of those challenges, the Orange and Blue went toe-to-toe with former WAC and Conference USA foe Tulsa. There were seven ties and 11 lead changes, and UTEP led by three (46-43) with seven minutes to go. It wasn't to be, though, with the Golden Hurricane peeling off an 8-0 run over the next five minutes. The Miners stopped the surge with a pair of Katia Gallegos free throws, but couldn't get any closer than three points down the stretch.Katarina Zec tallied 13 points to pace the squad while Gallegos netted 10 points and a game-high five assists.Ariona Gillflirted with a double-double (nine points, eight rebounds) while also tallying a trio of steals.Ariana Taylor put up seven points in her first start of the season.\n\nAT SMU 60, UTEP 54, 12/19/19\n\nKatarina Zec (12 points) andAriana Taylor (season-high 10 points) both reached double figures in scoring whileAriona Gill (eight points, 11 rebounds) flirted with a double-double in UTEP's hard-fought 60-56 setback at SMU on Dec. 19.

The Miners limited the Wildcats to 38.0 percent shooting (19-50), including just 7.1 percent (1-14) from beyond-the-arc. Arizona entered the contest averaging 78 points and shooting 49 percent from the floor. UTEP also kept All-American Aari McDonald to 13 points on 4-14 shooting, eight below her scoring output.

The Wildcats (1-5) put up quite a fight, but UTEP had enough in the tank to continue its best start to a year during theKevin Baker era. UTEP won the boards (42-35), thanks primarily toAriona Gill'scareer-high 14 rebounds. Gill added seven points to flirt with the double-double. But the night was stolen by Rochelle, who was electric in her 21 minutes off the pine. She connected on 6-10 from the floor, in addition to going 3-3 at the free throw line. Her presence was equally felt on the defensive end where she came up one steal shy of cracking UTEP's top-10 single-game list. Another factor was the Miners' defense forcing 31 turnovers, the most by a UTEP opponent in four years. WSU was held to 35.6 percent (16-45) from the floor, including 23.1 percent (3-13) from 3-point range.
