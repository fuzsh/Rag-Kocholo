Atlanta, GA – August 1, 2024 – The Wuerffel Foundation announced today its Allstate Wuerffel Trophy Watch List for the 2024 season, consisting of a record 111 nominees representing players from college football’s Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). College Football’s Premier Award for Community Service and one of the most meaningful awards in collegiate sports, The Allstate Wuerffel Trophy is named after Danny Wuerffel, the 1996 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback from the University of Florida who parlayed his success on the football field into a lifetime of service. The Allstate Wuerffel Trophy embodies Wuerffel’s commitment to being a humanitarian, while honoring student-athletes who are inspired to serve others and make positive impacts on society.

I am deeply honored to see such outstanding individuals nominated for this year's Allstate Wuerffel Trophy,” said Wuerffel. “Their commitment to serving others and making a positive impact in their communities is truly inspiring.
