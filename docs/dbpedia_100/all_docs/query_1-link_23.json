UNT defeated CLT by a score of 66-59 last season. At Halton Arena, the 49ers were 7-0 versus the Mean Green coming into today.\n\nQUICK TIMEOUT\n\nNorth Texas got off to a hot start with a 9-0 run to begin the game, forcing an early timeout from head coach Cara Consuegra. The Mean Green had an efficient first quarter of offense as they attacked the basket to create open looks, shooting 8-for-18 while making two three-pointers. Tommisha Lampkin was a force in the paint with 8 points as she made all four of her attempts. The biggest lead in the quarter was 10 for UNT, as they led 21-12 after 10 minutes.\n\n20 TO 2 RUN\n\nCharlotte started out the second quarter by scoring the first eight points to cut the deficit to 21-20, and tied the game at 23 on a layup from Tracey Hueston to force a North Texas timeout.

Tracey Hueston picked up her third foul midway through the third quarter, but in stepped freshman Fatou Diakite. She finished with three blocks in just 12 minutes off the bench, coming up big defensively for the Niners in helping preserve the lead. Going into the fourth, CLT led 49 to 44.\n\nHIGH SCORING FOURTH\n\nBoth teams found their rhythm offensively as the final 10 minutes were back and forth with made baskets. CLT shot 10-for-13 as a team, once again led by Dazia Lawrence who had nine in the period while making all four attempts.

On the following possession, Lawrence found Jacee Busick for the clutch three-pointer to extend the advantage back to nine. The dagger proved to be on the next offensive possession for Charlotte when Tracey Hueston found Keanna Rembert for the easy layup, fueling the 74-64 victory for the first win in the American.\n\nINSIDE THE BOX SCORE\n\nPreseason Second Team selection in the American Dazia Lawrence stepped up with 23 points (11-20) and three steals to lead Charlotte to victory. Imani Smith played 35 minutes off the bench on her way to finishing with 11 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, three blocks, and two steals in an all-around effort. Jewel Watkins and Fatou Diakite both gave great minutes off the bench as well, combining to score 11 points as they made impact plays on both ends of the floor.\n\nCharlotte out-rebounded North Texas 40 to 31, including four more offensive rebounds. 46 of CLT's points came in the paint, and 22 of them off turnovers. The Mean Green coughed the ball up on 22 occasions, compared to 17 from the Niners. Bench points (22) was a deciding factor in the outcome along with the free throw comparison, where Charlotte shot 72.2% compared to 46.2% from North Texas.\n\nCOACH CONSUEGRA ON THE WIN\n\n\"North Texas is a great team, they made us earn this win. Coach Burton has done a great job in his first year with the program. They got off to a great start, but our team never wavered and hung in there. Our team stayed focused on the next play. We saw a lot of progress today and we are proud of the effort.\"\n\n\"For us to come away with the win against a great North Texas team in our first conference game in the American shows how far we have come as a team. It is a privilege for us to be the first Charlotte women's basketball team to play in this conference. Going forward, we must stay the course.\"\n\nDAZIA LAWRENCE ON IMANI SMITH\n\n\"Smitty brings the energy off the bench, we go as she goes. She made an impact the minute she came onto the court and gave us a much-needed lift on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nNEXT UP\n\nCharlotte travels to Tampa, Florida on Wednesday (Jan. 3) for an away game at South Florida. Opening tip is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., with video, radio, and live stats links available online."
