He's scored 15 points or more in nine different games so far, and has already been named Paradise Jam MVP and BIG EAST Player of the Week in this young season.\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. (13.1 ppg., 9.1 apg.) was a preseason All-BIG EAST selection. He's the nation's active leader in career assists (730), and his 9.1 assists per game this year rank lead in the country.\n\nTwo Omaha products in the starting line-up are also doing big things. Khyri Thomas averages 13.3 points per game, as the sophomore wing shoots 60 percent from the field and 53.3 percent from deep. Redshirt freshman big man Justin Patton averages 12.0 points and 6.3 rebounds per game. He's shooting 80.3 percent from the field (second nationally) and has 24 dunks already.\n\nScouting Oral Roberts\n\nOral Roberts owns a 2-9 record, which includes wins over John Brown and Rogers State. ORU is 0-8 away from home this season against a grueling schedule that includes Baylor, Michigan State and Oklahoma, among other squads.\n\nKris Martin leads four players in double-figures with 15.0 points per game, with Albert Owens (13.7 ppg.) the second-leading scorer and the team-leader with nine blocked shots.\n\nNorfolk, Neb., native Jalen Bradley (12.7 ppg., 4.7 apg.) also produces at a double-figure clip, as does leading rebounder Emmanuel Nzekwesi (11.5 ppg., 8.5 rpg.).\n\nORU shoots 43.1 percent from the floor and 39.1 percent from three-point range while averaging 70.7 points per game. ORU also allows 80.5 points per game as teams shoot 46.2 percent versus the Golden Eagles.\n\nThe Series With Oral Roberts\n\nCreighton leads the all-time series 6-4 over Oral Roberts, including a 4-1 record in Omaha.\n\nThe teams have not met since Creighton won 87-65 on Nov. 22, 2008 in Omaha.\n\nCreighton head coach Greg McDermott is 15-15 in his career against the current members of The Summit League, which includes a 4-0 mark since coming to Creighton. Ten of those losses came when he was coaching at Division II Wayne State.\n\nMcDermott has never faced ORU nor Scott Sutton. He went 1-1 against Scott's brother Sean's Oklahoma State teams from 2006-08 as Iowa State coach. Scott is now an ORU assistant coach.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his seventh season as head coach at Creighton. He is 151-72 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 431-267 in his 23rd season and is 300-203 in his 16th Division I campaign. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Preston Murphy.\n\nOral Roberts is coached by Scott Sutton (Oklahoma State, 1994), the son of former Creighton head coach Eddie Sutton. He owns a 322-235 record in his 18th year with the Golden Eagles, which also doubles as his career mark. Sutton is assisted by Sean Sutton, Marc Stricker and Rodney Perry.\n\nSutton Connections\n\nOral Roberts head coach Scott Sutton is the son of former Creighton head coach Eddie Sutton.\n\nEddie Sutton got his first Division I head coaching gig at Creighton when he posted an 82-50 record from 1969-74. He took Creighton to the 1974 NCAA Tournament, where it lost to #14 Kansas 55-54 before rallying to beat #16 Louisville 80-71 in a consolation contest played at Oral Roberts' Mabee Center. Later he became the first coach to lead four schools to the NCAA Tournament (also Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma State).\n\nScott Sutton was born June 3, 1970 in Omaha.\n\nThe Sutton family will be recognized by Creighton in a pregame ceremony on Saturday night.\n\nAnother Creighton/ORU Connection\n\nOral Roberts guard Darian Harris might look familiar to Creighton fans, as the junior spent the 2013-14 season in Omaha while redshirting alongside Toby Hegner within the Bluejay program.\n\nHarris transferred to Oral Roberts following the season and has contributed 124 points and 110 rebounds in 64 career games with the Golden Eagles.\n\nThe departure of Harris opened up a scholarship in the summer of 2014 that eventually led to Creighton signing Cole Huff.\n\nScoring In Bunches\n\nCreighton has scored 916 points through 10 games, to rank fifth nationally with 91.6 points per contest.\n\nThe 916 points are 50 more points than Creighton has EVER scored in its first 10 games of any season, as seen below:\n\nMost Points Through 10 Games, Creighton History\n\nPoints Year Final W-L (Postseason)\n\n916 2016-17 ? ? ?\n\n866 1965-66 14-12\n\n860 2011-12 29-6 (NCAA)\n\n855 1964-65 13-10\n\n855 2015-16 20-15 (NIT)\n\nA Good Start\n\nHere's a look at how Creighton has done statistically after 10 games in recent seasons.\n\nOf note, Creighton has started 5-5 or better after 10 games in 22 of the past 23 seasons.\n\nThis year's team, with four double-figure scorers, is only the second time since 1994-95 that Creighton has had more than three players scoring in double-figures after 10 games.\n\nCreighton's 91.6 points per game clip is the team's highest mark after 10 games in the last 23 years.\n\nCreighton's 54.4 percent field goal percentage through 10 games is the best mark in the last 23 years, a good trend since the next three spots are owned by the three winningest teams in program history.\n\nCreighton's 99 three-pointers through 10 games are second-most in the last 23 years, as well.\n\nCreighton Stats Through 10 Games, Since 1994-95\n\nYear W-L PPG FG% 3FG 10+ PPG guys\n\n2016-17 10-0 91.6 .544 99 4\n\n2015-16 7-3 85.5 .506 93 5\n\n2014-15 8-2 73.8 .438 85 2\n\n2013-14 8-2 83.7 .491 113 2\n\n2012-13 9-1 80.2 .519 90 2\n\n2011-12 9-1 86.0 .516 90 2\n\n2010-11 6-4 69.0 .426 74 3\n\n2009-10 4-6 71.3 .450 78 2\n\n2008-09 8-2 75.6 .439 89 3\n\n2007-08 9-1 80.8 .478 84 2\n\n2006-07 6-4 66.0 .408 59 3\n\n2005-06 7-3 69.3 .405 70 3\n\n2004-05 8-2 69.2 .434 80 2\n\n2003-04 10-0 72.1 .463 61 2\n\n2002-03 10-0 84.9 .526 97 1\n\n2001-02 6-4 75.9 .439 63 3\n\n2000-01 8-2 76.0 .445 83 3\n\n1999-00 9-1 74.7 .458 84 2\n\n1998-99 8-2 78.4 .454 79 2\n\n1997-98 7-3 77.3 .467 73 1\n\n1996-97 5-5 65.7 .409 57 2\n\n1995-96 5-5 66.7 .390 56 3\n\n1994-95 4-6 65.1 .404 66 3\n\nPlaying With The Lead\n\nWith the exception of the Ole Miss game on November 21st, Creighton has played with the lead on a consistent basis this season.\n\nIn CU's last three games, Creighton led wire-to-wire against Akron, and trailed only 2-0 against both Nebraska (before a 14-0 run) and Longwood (before an 11-0 run).\n\nOn the season, Creighton has trailed for just 49:40 of 400 possible minutes of action, a figure that ranks fourth-lowest nationally among remaining unbeaten teams, as seen below:\n\nTeam Time Trailing Next Game\n\nGonzaga 33:06 12/18\n\nUCLA 45:44 12/17\n\nVillanova 48:56 12/21\n\nCreighton 49:40 12/17\n\nSouthern California 87:46 12/17\n\nBaylor 90:41 12/17\n\nPerfect 10\n\nCreighton is off to an 10-0 start for the first time since the 2003-04 team started 12-0. That team's first loss came to a Northern Iowa club coached by...Greg McDermott.\n\nThis is Creighton's third different 10-0 start or better since 1999-2000, and the seventh time in school history.

Baylor is currently ranked fourth nationally.\n\nORU lost 95-88 in overtime to Ole Miss in the Paradise Jam, just three days before Ole Miss gave Creighton its toughest test of the season. In that game, Oral Roberts led the Rebels 79-74 with 36 seconds to play.\n\nMore recently, Oral Roberts lost at perennial power Michigan State by an 80-76 count despite missing starters Aaron Anderson and Javan White.\n\nThe Under .500 Streak\n\nCreighton has won 96 straight home contests against teams that enter the game with a record of .500 or worse, a streak that dates to Feb. 25, 2002.\n\nOral Roberts is 2-9 entering Saturday's game.\n\nKeeping It 100\n\nCreighton cracked the century mark in its 103-77 win over Washington State on Nov. 18, then did it again two days later in a 112-94 win over North Carolina State. Creighton also scored 113 points against Longwood on Dec. 9th.\n\nCreighton is 56-2 all-time when scoring 100 or more points, with 28 straight wins.\n\nCreighton scored 100+ points in consecutive games for the fourth time in school history, having also done it once last year and twice in 1965-66. Creighton has never scored 100 points in three straight games.\n\nCreighton's 215 points over those two games were the second-most in school history for point totals in consecutive contests, trailing only the 219 in two straight games (104 & 115) in 1965-66.\n\nCreighton's 301 points at the Paradise Jam were its most points in a three-game stretch since scoring 303 points (84, 104, 115) over the course of three games from Jan. 27-Feb. 2, 1966.\n\nCreighton's 113 points on December 9th vs. Longwood were its fifth-most in school history for a game, and the most since 115 vs. Indiana State on Jan. 19, 1985.\n\nBelow is a list of the most points in a game in Creighton history:\n\nScore Opponent Date\n\n124-94 at Miami (Fla.) 02/10/1964\n\n120-76 Nevada 12/21/1962\n\n115-80 Indiana State 01/19/1985\n\n115-82 Memphis 02/02/1966\n\n113-58 Longwood 12/09/2016\n\n112-94 vs. North Carolina St. 11/20/2016\n\n111-110 (2ot) Bradley 03/11/2008\n\nDouble-Doubles In Limited Minutes\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. needed just 23 minutes of playing time to earn a double-double (10 points, 11 assists) against Longwood last Friday.\n\nIn the seven-year era under Greg McDermott, only Will Artino (3x) and Gregory Echenique (2x) have produced double-doubles in less than 23 minutes, but all of those were of the point/rebound variety.\n\nThe only previous Bluejay with a point/assist double-double in less than 30 minutes under McDermott had been Austin Chatman, who had 14 points and 10 assists in 28 minutes vs. Missouri State on Jan. 30, 2013.\n\nHave A Half\n\nCreighton opened up a 62-25 halftime lead over Longwood last Friday, the program's largest lead at intermission since a 56-19 lead over IUPUI on Nov. 25, 2002 in a game played in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nLongwood is one of two schools that Creighton has had multiple halftime leads of more than 25 points against since 1990-91, joining Nebraska.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's largest halftime margins since 1990-91.\n\nLargest Halftime Leads, Since 1990-91\n\nMargin Score Opponent Date\n\n38 54-16 Grambling State 12/06/99\n\n37 56-19 IUPUI 11/25/02\n\n37 62-25 Longwood 12/09/16\n\n29 48-19 Towson 11/14/98\n\n29 53-24 Longwood 11/20/12\n\n29 53-24 Butler 01/14/14\n\n29 53-24 St. John's 02/28/16\n\n28 54-26 Western Illinois 11/20/00\n\n28 39-11 Alcorn State 11/15/04\n\n27 49-22 Texas-San Antonio 11/30/90\n\n27 47-20 Nebraska 11/24/07\n\n27 47-20 Saint Joseph's 12/01/12\n\n26 52-26 Southern 12/20/97\n\n26 42-16 Southern Illinois 03/10/03\n\n26 43-17 Presbyterian 11/18/12\n\n26 51-25 Nebraska 12/08/13\n\n25 57-32 Grambling State 11/29/01\n\n25 49-24 Bradley 01/19/11\n\nMost Lopsided Wins\n\nCreighton's 113-58 win over Longwood is tied for the third-largest margin of victory in school history, just two behind a record set 91 years ago.\n\nMost Lopsided Wins\n\nOpponent Margin Score Date\n\nMidland 57 63-6 12/12/25\n\nTexas-Arlington 56 106-50 11/17/02\n\nRegis 55 93-38 11/30/73\n\nLongwood 55 113-58 12/09/16\n\nMorningside 54 105-51 02/17/61\n\nDrake 53 79-26 02/14/33\n\nNorthern Colorado 51 105-54 12/02/59\n\nSouth Dakota State 51 67-16 01/11/27\n\nNebraska-Omaha 50 90-40 03/01/52\n\nWashburn 50 66-16 03/06/37\n\nYankton 50 70-20 01/07/22\n\nToby Steps Up\n\nToby Hegner grabbed a career-high 10 rebounds in just 17 minutes during Creighton's Dec. 7 win at Nebraska.\n\nMaking the achievement all the more impressive is that he played just two minutes before half thanks to two quick fouls.\n\nHegner's previous high for rebounds in a game was eight vs. Georgetown during his freshman season.\n\nHegner also established a career-high in dunks vs. Nebraska, when he had back-to-back throwdowns in a span of 38 seconds. Prior to that, the 6-foot-10 perimeter-based big man had one career dunk at Creighton in 74 career games.\n\nHegner continued his prowess last Friday with 10 points and nine rebounds in 14 minutes vs. Longwood.\n\nMcDermott Earns 150th Win At Creighton\n\nWith a win at Nebraska on Dec. 7th, Greg McDermott became the third coach in CU history to record 150 wins on the Bluejay sideline, as only Arthur A. Schabinger (165) and Dana Altman (327) had previously reached that milestone.\n\nMcDermott needed 71 games at Creighton to win his 50th contest and 134 games to earn his 100th win.\n\nThe Nebraska win marked McDermott's 222nd game on the Bluejay sideline.\n\nMcDermott is now 151-72 with the Bluejays when you include his Longwood victory. That Longwood win was the 300th Division I victory of McDermott's career.\n\nIf At 1st You Don't Succeed, Try The 2nd Half\n\nCreighton has been on an absolute terror in the second half of its last six games as its up-tempo style wears down the opposition.\n\nThe Bluejays have outscored teams just 241-195 in the first half of games vs. Ole Miss, Loyola (Md.), Buffalo, Akron, Nebraska and Longwood, but crushed those same foes by a combined 292-196 after intermission.\n\nCreighton has shot 60.5 percent from the field after the break in those six contests, with Justin Patton a near-perfect 22-for-24 (91.7 percent) from the floor. CU's top three second-half scorers in those games (Patton, Marcus Foster and Khyri Thomas) are a combined 52-64 (81.3%) from 2-point range in the second half of those six games.\n\n1,000 x 3\n\nCole Huff became the third member of the current Creighton team to surpass 1,000 career points when he reached the mark at Nebraska on Dec. 7. Huff entered the game with 999 points (including 527) at Nevada, then added 13 points in the win on 4-of-5 shooting from long-range.\n\nMarcus Foster surpassed the 1,000 point mark during the Nov. 29 win over Buffalo. Foster owns 178 points this season, and scored 875 points during his first two seasons at Kansas State. It took Foster 69 games total to reach the mark.\n\nLast year Maurice Watson Jr. surpassed 1,000 career points (including Boston), and he now owns 1,423 career points.\n\nCreighton has never previously had three players with 1,000 career points on the roster at the same time.\n\nBIG EAST > \"Football 5\" So Far\n\nCreighton has knocked off teams from the Big Ten (Wisconsin and Nebraska), Pac-12 (Washington State), ACC (North Carolina State) and SEC (Ole Miss) this year, all by nine or more points.\n\nThose five wins over the \"Football 5\" leagues are the most of any other team in the nation.\n\nThe BIG EAST owns 21 wins over \"Football 5\" leagues, second-most of any conference in the nation.\n\nBoth figures are through games of Dec. 14.\n\nMBB Wins Over \"Football 5\" Leagues, By Team\n\n5 Creighton\n\n4 Butler\n\n4 Gonzaga\n\n4 Kansas\n\n4 UCLA\n\nMBB Wins Over \"Football 5\" Leagues, By Conference\n\n25 Atlantic Coast\n\n21 BIG EAST\n\n16 Big 12\n\n15 Big Ten\n\n9 Southeastern\n\n9 American\n\nDouble-Digits x 8\n\nMarcus Foster and Justin Patton each scored in double-figures during each of Creighton's first eight games this season.\n\nThey joined Doug McDermott as the only Bluejays to open their career in double-figures during CU's first eight games in the last 35 years. McDermott opened his 2010-11 campaign with eight straight games in double-figures before being held scoreless in his ninth contest (against Saint Joseph's) for the only time in his college career.\n\nBefore Foster this year, Rod Mason was the last Bluejay with seven straight games of 15+ points to start any season, having done so in 1987-88.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's longest double figure scoring streaks to start a season since 1979-80.\n\nConsecutive Double-Figure Scoring Games\n\nTo Start Year, Since 1979-80\n\nConsec.

He would finish his career with 3,150 in 145 career games to rank fifth in NCAA history.\n\nMost Points, Newcomers First 10 Games Since 1995-96\n\nPts.

The Bluejays were previously ranked ninth on February 24, 2014 and 10th the week of January 20, 2003, November 28th and December 5th.\n\nCU has now been ranked 74 weeks in program history, with 46 of those under the direction of seventh-year head coach Greg McDermott.\n\nThe Bluejays are one of four BIG EAST teams in the top-16, as Villanova ranks first, Xavier is 17th and Butler is 18th.\n\nBelow is a list of the top weekly rankings in the AP poll in program history:\n\nBest Weekly AP rankings, Creighton History\n\n9th - 3/1/14\n\n10th - 1/20/03\n\n10th - 11/28/16\n\n10th - 12/5/16\n\n10th - 12/12/16\n\n11th - 11/26/12\n\n11th - 2/17/14\n\n12th - 2/10/03\n\n12th - 1/14/13\n\n12th - 2/3/14\n\n12th - 11/21/16\n\nOpposites Attract\n\nUCF's 7-foot-6 center Tacko Fall entered his game Thursday night leading the nation in field goal percentage at 83.3 percent, making 55-of-66 field goal attempts.\n\nThat put Fall just ahead of Creighton center Justin Patton, who is at 80.3 percent while shooting 53-for-66 to rank second.\n\nMaking Patton's figures all the more impressive is that he's also 3-for-5 from three-point range this fall.\n\nDespite their marksmanship while being guarded, both men have struggled at the charity stripe. Fall is 14-for-41 (34.1 percent) at the free throw line this year, while Patton is 11-for-28 (39.3 percent).\n\nPatton Wins Second BIG EAST Freshman Honor\n\nCreighton basketball center Justin Patton has won BIG EAST Freshman of the Week accolades for the second straight week, the league announced on Monday, Dec. 5th.\n\nPatton averaged 16.0 points, 8.5 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 2.0 blocked shots per game on 82.4 percent shooting from the field as Creighton posted a pair of double-digit wins over the defending champions from the Mid-American Conference Tournament (Buffalo) and regular-season (Akron).\n\nPatton started his week by becoming just the third Creighton freshman in the last 25 years to post a double-double, as he had 21 points, 10 rebounds, two blocks and a steal in a win vs. Buffalo. Patton made 9-of-10 shots from the field, becoming the first 7-footer in program history to sink a three-pointer.\n\nHe then had 11 points, seven rebounds, three steals and two blocks in a win vs. Akron. Patton had eight of his points and five of his rebounds after halftime, including a pair of slams that give him 21 dunks in eight games the season.\n\nBaker's Dozen For Watson\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. had a CenturyLink Center Omaha 13 assists in a Dec. 3 win over Akron. That's one more than the previous record held by Creighton's Grant Gibbs vs. Northwestern on December 22, 2011.\n\nThe contest was the third of Watson's Creighton career with 13 or more helpers, and fifth overall as a collegian.\n\nPer Sports-Reference.com, Watson is one of nine men with five games of 13+ assists since 2010-11, and the only active player. He's joined on that list by players such as Kris Dunn, Kendall Marshall and Michael Carter-Williams. The list is topped by Marshall and LIU-Brooklyn's Jason Brickman, with 10 each.\n\nWatson now owns three of Creighton's eight games all-time of 13+ assists, with Ralph Bobik (3), Latrell Wrightsell (1) and Jason Bey (1) owning the others.\n\nWe're Jamming!\n\nJustin Patton has 24 of CU's 46 dunks this season, with Marcus Foster (8), Khyri Thomas (4), Martin Krampelj (3), Toby Hegner (2), Zach Hanson (2), Cole Huff (1), Davion Mintz (1) and Kobe Paras (1) and accounting for the others. Nine of those dunks came last Friday against Longwood.\n\nLast season Creighton had 58 dunks total in 35 games, the most its had in any of Greg McDermott's first six years at the helm of the Bluejays. That group had 21 dunks after 10 games.\n\nHere's a look at the Creighton student-athletes with 20 or more dunks in a season, and 19 or more dunks in a career, under McDermott:\n\nMost Creighton Dunks, Season, Since 2010-11\n\nDunks Name Year\n\n36 Gregory Echenique 2012-13\n\n30 Gregory Echenique 2011-12\n\n24 Gregory Echenique 2010-11\n\n24 Justin Patton 2016-17\n\n22 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2010-11\n\nMost Creighton Dunks, Career, Since 2010-11\n\nDunks Name Years\n\n90 Gregory Echenique 2010-13\n\n38 Will Artino 2011-15\n\n29 Zach Hanson 2013-Pres.\n\n25 Geoffrey Groselle 2012-16\n\n24 Justin Patton 2016-Pres.\n\n22 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2010-11\n\n19 Doug McDermott 2010-14\n\nMost Creighton Dunks, Team, Season, Since 2010-11\n\nDunks Year Team W-L\n\n58 2015-16 20-15 (NIT)\n\n56 2010-11 23-16 (CBI)\n\n54 2012-13 28-8 (NCAA)\n\n46 2016-17 10-0 so far\n\n42 2011-12 29-6 (NCAA)\n\n35 2013-14 27-8 (NCAA)\n\n29 2014-15 14-19\n\nPatton On The Button\n\nJustin Patton has made 34 of his last 38 field goal attempts dating back to midway through the Ole Miss (Nov. 21) win and now is second the nation in field goal percentage at 80.3 percent.\n\nPatton owns 24 dunks this year, which no doubt contributes to his high accuracy rate, but he also shown his range by making 3-of-5 three-point attempts.\n\nPatton is the only Bluejay 7-footer in history to make a three-point shot.\n\nSince 1994-95, Creighton has had six performances where a player shot 90 percent or better from the field with eight or more attempts. Two of those were done by Justin Patton in his consecutive games in late November, as seen below:\n\nBest FG%, Since 1994-95, Minimum 8 FG\n\nFG% Name (FG-FGA), Opponent Date\n\n1.000 Anthony Tolliver (11-11) vs. Illinois State 1/1/07\n\n1.000 Geoffrey Groselle (8-8) vs. Coppin State 12/28/15\n\n1.000 Justin Patton (8-8) vs. Loyola (Md.) 11/26/16\n\n.900 Khyri Thomas (9-10) at Loyola (IL) 12/5/15\n\n.900 Geoffrey Groselle (9-10) at St. John's 12/31/15\n\n.900 Justin Patton (9-10) vs. Buffalo 11/29/16\n\nMore From Patton\n\nJustin Patton made more history when he had 21 points in 10 rebounds vs. Buffalo on Nov. 29.\n\nHe's just the third Creighton freshman since 1988-89 to post a double-double. Ronnie Harrell Jr. had 14 points and 11 rebounds vs. North Texas last December, while Doug McDermott had nine double-dips as a freshman in 2010-11.\n\nMcDermott had three games of at least 20 points and 10 rebounds during his freshman campaign, with his first one coming in his seventh game (like Patton) when he had 20 points and 12 rebounds vs. BYU.\n\nDoubling Up\n\nOmaha natives Khyri Thomas (18 points, 12 rebounds) and Justin Patton (20 points, 10 rebounds) both had double-doubles in CU's Nov. 29 win over Buffalo.\n\nThe Bluejay duo were the first Creighton teammates with 10+ rebounds in the same game since Doug McDermott and Gregory Echenique on Dec. 29, 2012 and the first Creighton teammates with a double-double in the same game since Doug McDermott and Austin Chatman on Jan. 30, 2013.\n\nFoster & Patton Honored By BIG EAST\n\nCreighton picked up a pair of weekly awards from the BIG EAST Conference on Nov. 28th. Marcus Foster was named BIG EAST Player of the Week, while Justin Patton was named BIG EAST Freshman of the Week. It was the first weekly league honor for both as Bluejays.\n\nFoster averaged 20.5 points and 3.5 rebounds per game in a pair of Bluejay victories, shooting 60 percent from the floor (15-25), 50 percent from downtown (6-12) and 83.3 percent at the line (5-6).\n\nFoster's week began with a season-high 25 points against Ole Miss in the title game of the Paradise Jam. He scored 17 points in the first half to help keep Creighton within six at the break, and would take home Tournament MVP honors on the All-Tournament Team after leading CU back from a 11-point deficit.\n\nOn Saturday, Foster had 16 points and two assists in an 82-52 win over Loyola (Md.). With Creighton off to a sluggish start, Foster scored the first nine points in an 11-2 Bluejay run as Creighton overcame a 20-18 deficit to take the lead for good.\n\nPatton averaged 14.0 points and 5.5 rebounds in two games while shooting 86.7 percent from the field. He added two assists, two blocked shots and a steal to help Creighton improve to 6-0. Twenty-two of his 28 points came after halftime, as Creighton outscored foes 98-58 (the Jays were outscored 71-70 in the first half).\n\nPatton's week began on Monday in a win over Ole Miss in the title game of the Paradise Jam. Patton had 11 points and five rebounds in 28 minutes, making 5-of-7 field goal attempts.\n\nHe then had 15 of his season-high 17 points after halftime in Saturday's 82-52 win over Loyola (Md.). Patton was a perfect 8-for-8 from the field and also led CU with six rebounds.\n\nShooting Stars\n\nCreighton is second nationally in field goal percentage at 54.4 percent, trailing only UCLA (56.0).\n\nNationally, Creighton is the only team to shoot 50 percent or better in every game this season.\n\nCreighton ranks fifth nationally with 91.6 points per game and has scored 77 points or more in all nine games this winter.\n\nIt Do Run, Run\n\nCreighton ranks seventh in the KenPom.com's Adjusted Offensive rankings this year and 37th in tempo through Thursday morning.\n\nPer figures from StatBroadcast.com, Creighton has scored on more than half its possessions in all but one game this season, despite averaging just 14 seconds per possession.\n\nCreighton Offense\n\nOpponent Poss.

Two days later vs. North Carolina State, Creighton set a tournament record with 112 points in a game.\n\nOn Nov. 21, Creighton finished the tournament with records for points, assists, field goal percentage and three-point field goal percentage, most of them by a significant margin.\n\nCategory Old Record Creighton in 2016\n\nPoints 267 301\n\nAssists 55 64\n\nFG Percentage .516 .569\n\n3FG Percentage .491 .543\n\nNot 1, Not 2, Not 3, Not 4, Not 5, Not 6...\n\nCreighton placed seven men in double-figures last Sunday against North Carolina State. All five starters scored in double-figures, as did Isaiah Zierden and Zach Hanson off the bench.\n\nIt was just the second time since 1980-81 that Creighton has had seven men score 10 or more points in the same game, joining a win over Coppin State on Dec. 28, 2015.\n\nFirst Half Blitz\n\nCreighton led 62-25 at halftime on Dec. 9 vs. Longwood. The 62 points were a CenturyLink Center Omaha record for points in a half, and the most by the Bluejays in any half since scoring 63 in the second half of a 106-50 win over Texas-Arlington on Nov. 17, 2002.\n\nCreighton's 55-point win was also its largest since that same 106-50 win over Texas-Arlington on Nov. 17, 2002.\n\nCreighton has won 66 straight games in which it has scored 42 or more points in the first half, and 51 straight when scoring 44 or more in the first half.\n\nAssist Leader\n\nNot only is Maurice Watson Jr. is the nation's active leader in assists with 730, but he's also fifth in steals (175), eighth in assist/turnover ratio (2.13) and 12th in field goals made (543).\n\nWatson is the nation's only active Division I player with at least 600 field goals and 600 assists.\n\nBelow is a look at the national active leaders in assists and steals, through Dec. 14th.\n\nActive Leaders in Career Assists\n\n1. Maurice Watson Jr., Creighton 730\n\n2. Monte Morris, Iowa State 606\n\n3. Alec Wintering, Portland 517\n\n4.

Justin Robinson, Monmouth 180\n\n5. Damon Lynn, NJIT 177\n\n4. Maurice Watson Jr., Creighton 175\n\nShooting Stars\n\nCreighton has shot 54.4 percent from the field this season, and an equally impressive 44.8 percent from three-point range.\n\nNo team has shot better than 47 percent from three-point territory for an entire season since Indiana (47.6) in 1988-89. When Creighton led the nation in three-point shooting percentage in 2013-14, it finished the year at 41.4 percent.\n\nBig man Justin Patton is shooting 80.3 percent from the field (second nationally), with 24 dunks among his 53 made field goals. Patton has made 34 of his last 38 field goal attempts dating to midway through the Ole Miss game.\n\nEach of Creighton's nine players with multiple made three-pointers have connected on 39.1 percent or better of their shots from downtown.\n\nBIG EAST in the Paradise Jam\n\nCreighton's participation in the Paradise Jam marked the 11th straight year at BIG EAST has participated in the event, which began in 2001.\n\nCreighton's title was the sixth by a team that was a BIG EAST member at the time it won the title, joining Seton Hall (2014), Marquette (2011), Connecticut (2008), Boston College (2003) and Miami (2001).\n\nHanson Hurt\n\nSenior center Zach Hanson was expected to miss 8-12 weeks after tearing a tendon and the ligaments in his left ankle during Creighton's win over Ole Miss on Nov. 21st.\n\nHanson underwent surgery on Nov. 28th.\n\nA Pierre, S.D., native, Hanson was averaging 8.0 points and 3.2 rebounds per game while shooting 68.0 percent from the field in 13.2 minutes per game.\n\nThough he will not be on the court, look for Hanson to maintain a strong leadership role on the team as he mentors freshmen centers Justin Patton and Martin Krampelj.\n\nAll-Around Excellence\n\nCreighton is ranked on the hardwood, but also excels in several other sports as well.\n\nIn fact, Creighton, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Kentucky are the nation's only four schools that currently have a ranked team in men's basketball (AP poll), men's soccer (NSCAA poll) and women's volleyball (AVCA poll).\n\nOmaha's Team\n\nCreighton has started Omaha natives Justin Patton and Khyri Thomas in each of its first 10 games.\n\nIt's the first time Creighton has started two Omaha products in the same game since March 16, 2000 vs. Auburn, when Matt West (Omaha Westside) and Donnie Johnson (Omaha Central) earning a nod.\n\nJohnson, coincidentally, coached Thomas at Omaha Benson High School.\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nCreighton was picked to finish third in its fourth season as BIG EAST Conference members according to a preseason poll of league coaches. Villanova was picked first with 81 points and nine first-place votes, while Xavier and Creighton round out the top three. Seton Hall and Georgetown tied for fourth place, while Butler, Marquette, St. John's, Providence and DePaul rounded out the bottom half.\n\nCreighton guard Maurice Watson Jr. was named Preseason All-BIG EAST First Team, while Marcus Foster was picked to be a Preseason All-BIG EAST Honorable-Mention choice.\n\nNBA Representation\n\nThis year marks the third straight season that Creighton has three NBA players at the same time, as Kyle Korver (Atlanta Hawks), Anthony Tolliver (Sacramento Kings) and Doug McDermott (Chicago Bulls) are all in the league.\n\nIncluding 2016-17, Creighton has now had an NBA player in 33 of the last 34 years.\n\nKorver ranks eighth in NBA history with 1,929 three-pointers and is also eighth in league history with 42.9 percent marksmanship from three-point range (through December 14). He set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range in 2009-10, and is the only player in league history to lead the NBA in three-point percentage three times. He's currently averaging 8.9 points per game while making 40.4 percent of his three-point attempts this year.\n\nTolliver is averaging 3.4 points and 2.7 rebounds per game this season for the Kings, his 11th NBA organization.\n\nMcDermott is in his third season with the Chicago Bulls, where he's averaging 9.9 points per game and shooting 48.4 percent from the field and 31.0 percent from three-point range for fellow Ames High alum Fred Hoiberg. Hoiberg, ironically, is the same man who replaced Greg McDermott as Iowa State's head coach in 2010.\n\nWho Are These Guys?\n\nCreighton returns four regular starters (Maurice Watson Jr., Isaiah Zierden, Khyri Thomas and Cole Huff) from last year's team that finished 20-15. Creighton's roster contains players who made 130 starts a year ago (35 by Watson, 31 by Zierden, 28 by Thomas, 23 by Huff, 12 by Toby Hegner, 1 by Zach Hanson), and a combined 173 career starts as Bluejays. That doesn't factor in the 57 starts for Marcus Foster at Kansas State or the 30 starts at Syracuse for Kaleb Joseph.\n\nEach of Creighton's five teams since 1980-81 to return 130 or more starts from the previous season won 20 or more games and went on to reach the postseason.\n\nReturning Returning Starts Final\n\nYear Starters From Previous Year W-L\n\n2016-17 4 130 ? ? ?\n\n2015-16 1 64 20-15\n\n2014-15 1 49 14-19\n\n2013-14 4 144 27-8\n\n2012-13 4 140 28-8\n\n2011-12 3 101 29-6\n\n2010-11 4 123 23-16\n\n2009-10 3 106 18-16\n\n2008-09 3 83 27-8\n\n2007-08 1 44 22-11\n\n2006-07 4 120 22-11\n\n2005-06 4 134 20-10\n\n2004-05 2 58 23-11\n\n2003-04 3 101 20-9\n\n2002-03 5 159 29-5\n\n2001-02 2 65 23-9\n\n2000-01 3 90 24-8\n\n1999-00 3 84 23-10\n\n1998-99 3 84 22-9\n\n1997-98 4 72 18-10\n\n1996-97 4 126 15-15\n\n1995-96 4 100 14-15\n\n1994-95 2 52 7-19\n\n1993-94 3 73 7-22\n\n1992-93 2 64 8-18\n\n1991-92 2 51 9-19\n\n1990-91 4 132 24-8\n\n1989-90 4 127 21-12\n\n1988-89 4 123 20-11\n\n1987-88 3 83 16-16\n\n1986-87 2 65 9-19\n\n1985-86 1 48 12-16\n\n1984-85 4 124 20-12\n\n1983-84 3 72 17-14\n\n1982-83 3 77 8-19\n\n1981-82 2 78 7-20\n\n1980-81 4 112 21-9\n\nAmong The Nation's Best\n\nBelow is where Creighton ranks nationally in the since Greg McDermott took over in 2010-11, per Basketball-Reference.com:\n\n2010-11 to 2015-16\n\nCategory Stat NCAA Rank\n\nFG Percentage .476 4th\n\n3FG Made 1,775 4th\n\n3FG Percentage .386 5th\n\nAssists 3392 7th\n\nFG Made 5,534 18th\n\nWins 141 31st\n\nWinning Percentage .662 47th\n\nGoing For 20, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 16 of the last 18 seasons (including 2015-16), a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust three schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 18 years: Duke, Gonzaga and Kansas.\n\nKentucky , Florida, Texas and Syracuse have each done it in 17 of the last 18 seasons.\n\nAlong with Arizona, Xavier and Connecticut, Creighton is one of four schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 16 of the past 18 years.\n\nEight Out Of 18 Tourney Titles\n\nCreighton owns eight league tournament titles in the last 18 years. On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this are Gonzaga (14), Duke (10), Winthrop (9), Creighton (8), Kansas (8) and Kentucky (8).\n\nFull House\n\nCreighton is averaging 16,909 fans per home game this season, fifth-best nationally. That figure would rank 17th best in the NBA, ahead of 14 franchises.\n\nLast year was the 11th straight season that CU has been among the nation's top 25 in average home attendance, and the fifth straight season in the top-10 nationally in attendance, as well.\n\n2016-17 Attendance Leaders (12/16)\n\nRk.

The 302,887 home fans this season ranked as the most in school history.\n\nCreighton had never attracted more than 141,000 home fans in any season prior to the opening of CenturyLink Center Omaha, and now has done it in the previous 13 seasons.\n\nCreighton has led its conference in home attendance every year since moving into CenturyLink Center Omaha, which is opening its 14th season.\n\nCreighton's Most Home Fans, Season\n\nRk.

While respectable, that pales in comparison to CU's 75-10 (.882) mark the last six years when shooting better than 40.00 percent from downtown.\n\nLower the standards to 30%, and it's still impressive. Creighton is 112-30 in the last six years when shooting 30 percent or better from deep, compared to 16-25 when shooting 29.99 percent or less.\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 16 victories under Greg McDermott after trailing by double-figures at some point. Nine of those comebacks came away from home, including the win over Ole Miss in the Virgin Islands on Nov. 21st.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2014, Creighton trailed 42-24 to No. 18 Oklahoma with 18:30 to go before putting together a comeback for the ages. It was CU's largest comeback victory under Greg McDermott (see chart below), and the second-biggest in the history of CenturyLink Center Omaha (see chart, left column on page four).\n\nOn the other hand, CU is 131-9 under McDermott when putting together double-digit leads, including wins 119 of the last 124 times.\n\nDouble-Digit Comebacks Under Greg McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n12 at DePaul 01/17/16\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n11 vs. Ole Miss 11/21/16\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Dramatics\n\nProvidence's Kris Dunn hit a game-winning shot as time expired to beat Creighton last Jan. 12th.

The 151 wins are easily the most in Creighton history in the first seven seasons, way more than Tom Apke's 130.\n\nMost Wins at CU, First Seven Seasons\n\nCoach Years W-L After 7 Yrs\n\nGreg McDermott 2010-Pres. 151-72 so far\n\nTom Apke 1974-80 130-64\n\nDana Altman 1994-00 123-86\n\nRed McManus 1959-65 105-75\n\nMcDermott Passes McManus On CU Wins List\n\nGreg McDermott currently has 151 victories at Creighton, good for third place on CU's all-time wins list.\n\nMcDermott's .677 winning percentage is Creighton's best since Arthur A. Schabinger's .714 win rate more 80 years ago.\n\nBelow is a list of the most victorious Creighton coaches in program history.\n\nMost Coaching Wins, Creighton History\n\nRk.

In fact, Watson had owned or shared the team lead in assists in 23 straight games before that streak was snapped in the NIT vs. Alabama on March 15th.\n\nWatson has also led Creighton in assists every game this season, which means he's led or tied for the team lead in assists in all but three of his 45 games since becoming eligble at Creighton.\n\nWatson became Creighton's sixth player since 1970-71 to lead the club in both points per game and assists per game, as seen below:\n\nCreighton Leaders in PPG & APG, Since 1970-71\n\nName, Year PPG APG\n\nKevin McKenna, 1979-80 16.5 3.7\n\nMatt Petty, 1992-93 17.2 3.1\n\nKyle Korver, 2001-02 15.1 3.3\n\nNate Funk, 2003-04 11.1 2.7\n\nNate Funk, 2006-07 17.7 3.0\n\nAustin Chatman, 2014-15 11.5 3.7\n\nMaurice Watson Jr., 2015-16 14.1 6.5\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 228 regular and postseason contests at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time in the 14-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own a 190-38 (.833) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Thursday (7-0) or Friday (12-0).\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 17,448-14,668 in games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, an average margin of 12.19 points per game. Creighton has led wire-to-wire 63 different times, including 11 of its last 25 home games.\n\nCreighton is also 25-22 all-time in the 47 games at CLCO in which it's fallen behind by double-figures at any point, 7-8 when down by 10+ points at halftime at The Link, and 31-20 when trailing at halftime at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nCreighton is 93-20 (.823) at CenturyLink Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, including a 55-4 record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 210-38 (.847) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nOn Your Mark, Get Set, Go\n\nCreighton averaged 79.63 points per game in 2015-16, and is scoring 91.60 points per game in 2016-17.\n\nGreg McDermott is 41-1 as a Division I head coach when his teams score 90 or more points, including a 35-1 mark on the Creighton sideline.\n\nIn fact, McDermott's team scored 90 or more points 10 times (in 35 games) last season, compared to six total times in 280 games on the sideline in nine years at Northern Iowa and Iowa State.\n\nCreighton had won 75 straight games when scoring 90 or more points at all sites since a Jan. 11, 1988 loss to Southern Illinois, before a March 5th 98-93 loss at Xavier.\n\nCreighton is 56-2 all-time when scoring 100 points or more, including 28 straight wins since a 1977 loss to North Texas.\n\nPizza Pie, Piled High = Wins\n\nThanks to a promotion with Omaha-based Godfather's Pizza, Creighton season ticket-holders can get a free mini pizza any time the Jays score 75 points at home.\n\nHistory has proven that when the team earns the fans pizza, it often leads to a victory as well.\n\nThe first three years of CenturyLink Center Omaha (2003-06), Creighton needed 70 points to earn its fans free pizza, and the Jays went 27-3 when reaching that threshold, closing out that run with 12 straight wins.\n\nSince upping the standard to 75 points prior to the 2006-07 campaign, Creighton is 102-1 when scoring 75 points or more at CenturyLink Center Omaha. In other words, Creighton is 114-1 in CenturyLink Center Omaha since Feb. 6, 2005 when scoring enough points to earn its fans some free pizza. The perfect streak of 101-0 was snapped on Dec. 2, 2015 when Arizona State scored three points in the final 15 seconds to sneak away with a 79-77 victory.\n\nHome Run\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over in 2010, Creighton is averaging 79.24 points per home game (8,954 points in 113 home games).\n\nSince a 92-83 loss to Southern Illinois on Feb. 19, 2000, Creighton is 125-0 at home (95-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 78 points or more, and 105-0 at home (78-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 80 points or more at home dating to that same setback.\n\nLast Season Recap\n\nCreighton went 20-15 last season and reached the quarterfinals of the National Invitation Tournament before being eliminated at BYU. Maurice Watson Jr. (14.1 ppg., 6.5 apg.) led the Bluejays in both scoring and assists, while senior Geoffrey Groselle (6.1 rpg.) led the team in rebounding and set a Creighton record by shooting 70.2 percent from the field.\n\nCreighton's best victories last season included a 70-56 win over No. 5 Xavier, and a pair of wins to claim the title at the Men Who Speak Up Main Event in Las Vegas.\n\nShuttle Service Provided Again\n\nChief Bus will provide complimentary shuttle service from the Creighton University campus to CenturyLink Center Omaha for all men's basketball home games this season. The service is available to all fans, not just Creighton students.\n\nThe shuttle will start 75 minutes before tip-off and shuttles will continue to operate the route during the game. The three designated stops for pick-up around the CU campus are: 24th & California (nearside/southbound); 20th & Cass (nearside/eastbound) and at Harper Dining Center (outside the Mike & Josie Harper Center in the turnaround which is on the east side of the building).\n\nThe shuttle will then go eastbound on Capitol Avenue and then go north up 10th Street for drop-off at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance. The route is designed for each shuttle driver to make a roundtrip every 15 minutes.\n\nFollowing the game's conclusion, the shuttle will start at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance on 10th Street and loop the original route with the first of three stops at 24th & California Streets.\n\nTicket Information\n\nSingle-game tickets for the 2016-17 season went on sale on October 24th.\n\nFans can purchase single-game tickets at CenturyLink Center Omaha Box Office, Ryan Athletic Center, all Ticketmaster locations (Baker's, Younkers), Ticketmaster online at http://www.ticketmaster.com or by calling Ticketmaster and charging by phone at (800) 745-3000.
