        "text": "SAN ANTONIO — UTSA will continue its six-game home stand and open Conference USA play with a 6 p.m. matchup on Friday against North Texas at the Convocation Center.\n\nThe contest is the first C-USA game of the season and it will be broadcast on the American Sports Network (WOAI-2 in San Antonio) with Ron Thulin (play-by-play) and Chris Walker (analysis) calling the action.\n\nRyan Bowie continues to lead the Roadrunners (2-11) with 18.2 points and 7.6 rebounds per game and those marks rank fourth and seventh in the league, respectively. The squad will be coming off a nine-day layoff after it closed non-conference play on Dec. 22 against Cal Poly when Bowie picked up his eighth career double-double with 23 points and a career-high 14 boards.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mean Green (5-8) shook off a seven-game losing streak to win three of their last four contests. Picked to finish eighth in the league's preseason poll, North Texas has three players scoring in double figures, led by guards Deckie Johnson (14.3 ppg) and Texas A&M transfer J-Mychal Reese (14.3 ppg).\n\nNorth Texas leads the all-time series, 11-10, but UTSA took both meetings last season to improve to 2-1 against the Mean Green since both teams joined C-USA for the 2013-14 season.\n\nFriday’s game can be heard live in the San Antonio area on KBUC 92.5/93.3 FM beginning with the pregame show at 5:30 p.m. Andy Everett (play-by-play) will have the call."
