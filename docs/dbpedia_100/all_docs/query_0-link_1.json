        "text": "North Texas (5-3) at Brigham Young (6-2)\n\nTuesday, Dec. 3, 2013 • 8 p.m. Central\n\nProvo, Utah • Marriott Center (20,900)\n\nRadio: MGRN - 88.1 KNTU-FM, 95.3 KHYI-FM\n\nTV: BYUtv\n\nWebcast: BYUTVSports.com\n\nLive Stats: BYUCougars.com\n\nSeries: BYU leads 2-0 • Last: L 97-68 at BYU on Dec. 8, 1989\n\nGame 9 - BYU\n\nPROVO, Utah - The North Texas basketball team has made two previous trips to take on BYU, and while both games took place over two decades ago, they still rank No. 1 and No. 5 in the largest crowds a Mean Green team has ever played in front of.\n\nThe Marriott Center, capacity 20,900, will once again host North Texas on Tuesday, and the Mean Green (5-3) players know they'll be playing in front of the largest audience of the season, and possibly their lives.\n\nThe 1980 matchup in Provo, Utah saw an overflow crowd of 21,758 fans pack in to watch BYU and North Texas, which is still the record for the biggest crowd to watch an NT squad play.\n\nTuesday's crowd probably won't reach that level, but they'll see a versatile Mean Green squad intent on getting to the free throw line. Five different NT players have led the team in scoring this year, and four different players have recorded a double-double."
