He was named the ACC Rookie of the Year and earned Freshman All-American honors. Concepcion finished his first collegiate season with 71 receptions for 839 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also rushed the ball for 320 yards, averaging 7.8 yards per carry. Concepcion broke NC State’s Freshman records for receptions and touchdown receptions.\n\nESPN released their 2024 College Football Preseason Power Rankings today, and slotted NC State at #20.\n\nGeorgia\n\nOhio St.\n\nOregon\n\nTexas\n\nAlabama\n\nNotre Dame\n\nOle Miss\n\nPenn St.\n\nMichigan\n\nFSU\n\nMissouri\n\nUtah\n\nLSU\n\nTennessee\n\nClemson\n\nKansas St.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma St.\n\nMiami\n\nNC State\n\nArizona\n\nTexas A&M\n\nUSC\n\nKansas\n\nIowa\n\nHere’s what they had to say about the Wolfpack:\n\nNo. 20 NC State Wolfpack\n\nNC State has just one 10-win season in program history — all the way back in 2002 with Philip Rivers at QB — but there’s a strong case that this is as talent-rich an offensive unit as any the Wolfpack have had since that season. Along with rising sophomore KC Concepcion, coach Dave Doeren added a host of impact players in the portal this offseason, including center Zeke Correll, tailbacks Jordan Waters and Hollywood Smothers, receiver Noah Rogers, tight end Justin Joly and QB Grayson McCall. NC State is 17-9 over the past two seasons despite myriad QB issues and an offense that has averaged just 25 points per game (85th in FBS) over that span. Instead, the questions might be on defense — a unit that must replace All-American Payton Wilson. The job likely falls to converted safety Sean Brown, but he’ll be flanked by a solid secondary led by Aydan White and a veteran front. NC State’s schedule is another reason for optimism, but the Wolfpack will need to survive an arduous start with Tennessee in Week 2 and Clemson in Week 4 before enjoying the softer slate in October and November. — Hale\n\nWeek 1 matchup: vs. Western Carolina on Aug. 29 (7 p.m., ACC Network)\n\n(ESPN)\n\nESPN’s David Hale is rolling out his Preseason ACC Position Rankings, and he ranks NC State’s Defensive Line 8th in the ACC.\n\nFor perspective, looking back at last year, he ranked the Wolfpack’s D-Line 8th last year.\n\nNotes from Hale’s thread:\n\n-Here’s a genuinely ridiculous stat: NC State’s Red Hibbler had just 13 tackles last season. 6.5 of them were sacks. The next lowest tackle tally among P5 DL with 6+ sacks was UCF’s Malachi Lawrence with 29.\n\n-Returning ACC players w/5+ sacks and 100+ snaps from the interior line: Aeneas Peebles Davin Vann Ashton Gillotte Joshua Farmer Rueben Bain.\n\nHere’s Hale’s rankings of the Running Backs, Linebackers , Wide Receivers/Tight Ends."
