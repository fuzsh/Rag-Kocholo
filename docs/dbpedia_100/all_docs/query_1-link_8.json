        "text": "North Texas Mean Green\n\n2012-13: 12-20 (7-13 Sun Belt)\n\nIn-conference offense: .97 points per possession (10th in Sun Belt)\n\nIn-conference defense: 1.03 points per possession (8th in Sun Belt)\n\nA relentless slew of injuries made a highly touted season for the Mean Green a disaster under first-year coach Tony Benford. He'll try to bounce back without last season's top talent, forward Tony Mitchell, who was selected by Detroit in the second round of the NBA draft despite a sophomore season drop-off.\n\nProjected starting lineup\n\nAmong many other injuries a season ago, two members of the starting backcourt each broke a foot -- 2-guard Brandan Walton in the season's first game, and point guard Chris Jones in the 13th. Jones returned late but played in just 16 games. Both are back this season, which is good news for Benford. Walton hit 37 percent of his 3s in 2011-12, and Jones' assist rate of 37.8 last season would've ranked in the national top 25. Jordan Williams, a 6-foot-6 junior and last season's leading scorer, returns after turning in an offensive rating of 101. Guard Alzee Williams brings back a low turnover rate after starting 22 games.\n\nA group of both juco and Division I transfers gives Benford potential options in both the backcourt and the frontcourt. Guard T.J. Taylor, a one-time Marquette commit back when Benford was a Golden Eagles assistant, is eligible after a strong 2011-12 season at Paris Junior College. Vertrail Vaughns, a 3-point threat at George Mason for three seasons, will play his senior season with the Mean Green. Six-foot-5 guard Maurice Aniefiok was a late addition over the summer; he played with Ole Miss in 2011-12. Kelvin Gaines, a 6-10 Cincinnati transfer, has two seasons of immediate eligibility after having labrum surgery in April. Armani Flannigan and Colin Voss, two successful juco forwards, could be a part of the new frontcourt mix. Benford's most promising freshman might be Greg Wesley, an athletic 6-7 forward ranked by TexasHoops.com as one of the state's top 10 prospects in the class of 2013."
