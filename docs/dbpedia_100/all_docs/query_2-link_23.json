With conference championships, individual honors, national tournament appearances and many other events, the 2013-14 season was a banner year.\n\nWe will release the list one at a time throughout the summer until the No. 1 story of the year is announced on Aug. 1 -- just as #FalconFast BGSU football camp gets underway and the 2014-15 season has officially started!

And those expectations were met as Bowling Green went 10-4 on the year, won the MAC East Division and beat then-undefeated Northern Illinois in the MAC Championship game. The season started off with a bang, beginning with a 34-7 win over Tulsa that sparked the team to a 5-1 start. After two losses, by a combined four points, dropped the team to 5-3, Bowling Green started one of the most dominant stretches of football played by anyone. Over the final four games of the regular season, the Falcons allowed just one offensive touchdown. BGSU outscored Miami, Ohio, Eastern Michigan and Buffalo by a combined total of 176-17 to clinch the East Division and a trip to the MAC Championship game. Facing 12-0 Northern Illinois, ranked No. 14 in the country, Bowling Green steamrolled the Huskies 47-27, compiling 574 yards of offense along the way.
