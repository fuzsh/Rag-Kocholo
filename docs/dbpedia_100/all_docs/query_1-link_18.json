        "text": "UTEP To Play At Second-Place North Texas Saturday\n\n1/27/2023 10:43:00 AM\n\nGame Notes In PDF Format\n\nOPENING TIP\n\nThe UTEP men's basketball team (11-9, 4-5 C-USA) will open a three-game roadswing by playing at second-place North Texas (17-5, 8-3 C-USA) at 4 p.m. MT/5 p.m. CT Saturday. Mattress Firm is the Presenting Sponsor of UTEP Men's Basketball. It's the first of two match-ups on the year between the Texas foes, with the Mean Green making the visit to El Paso on Feb. 18. The Miners are 3-2 in their past five contests, but they were edged out by No. 24 Florida Atlantic at home, 67-59, on Jan. 21 last time out. UNT is on a two-game winning streak, most recently dispatching UTSA, 63-59 on Jan. 26. The Mean Green sport a 7-2 record at home (3-2 C-USA) while the Orange and Blue are 1-6 on the road (1-3 C-USA). The Miners did win their most-recent road game, however, overcoming a 13-point deficit to hand Charlotte its first home loss of the season, 60-58, on Jan. 16. UTEP is also well rested, having been idle for a week. Jon Teicher (42nd year) and Steve Yellen (20th year) will be on the call on \"The Home of UTEP Basketball\" 600 ESPN El Paso. It will also stream nationally on ESPN+, with Kyle Youmans (PxP) and Hank Dickenson on the call.\n\nFACING THE TOP TIER OF THE LEAGUE\n\nAfter challenging league-leading and No. 24 Florida Atlantic (L, 67-58, Jan. 21), UTEP now squares off at second-place North Texas. Following the contest with the Mean Green, the Miners travel to face currently fourth-place Middle Tennessee on Feb. 2. Through all games played on Jan. 26, those squads are a combined 50-14 (24-7 in C-USA).\n\nON THE ROAD AGAIN\n\nUTEP is in the midst of having five of seven games on the road, including the next three tilts. It marks the second straight season that the Orange and Blue will have three consecutive league road games. Last year the Miners had three conference contests in the span of five days, something they hadn't done since the 1983-84 campaign. UTEP wraps up the stretch with games at Middle Tennessee (Feb. 2) and at WKU (Feb. 4). The Miners are 1-6 on the road but did win at Charlotte, 60-58, on Jan. 16. Plus, their three most-recent road setbacks before the breakthrough against the 49ers were by a combined nine points.\n\nSERIES HISTORY: UTEP LEADS, 11-8\n\nUTEP leads the series 11-8, including a 7-6 cushion since the Mean Green joined Conference USA. The two programs met six times from 1951-52 through 1974-75 before not locking up again until North Texas became a member of C-USA. Last year, the Miners knocked off the Mean Green, 70-68, on March 5 to halt their 15-game winning streak. It also stopped a five-game skid for UTEP against UNT. The Miners are aiming for their first triumph in Denton since a 68-66 outcome on March 3, 2018.\n\nGET TO KNOW NORTH TEXAS\n\nNorth Texas rolled to a record of 9-2 in nonconference play. It has kept things going since the start of league action, forging a mark of 9-3 to sit alone in second place behind No. 21 Florida Atlantic. The Mean Green have won two straight and three of the past four, including toppling UTSA, 63-59, at home on Jan. 26. UNT puts up only 62.2 points per game (11th C-USA/339th NCAA) but makes up for that with its stifling defense. The Mean Green lead C-USA in scoring defense (55.3-third NCAA), field-goal percentage defense (40.0-32nd NCAA) and 3-point percentage defense (30.7-55th NCAA). It has yielded 70+ points just once on the year (L, 60-72, vs. Rice, Jan. 19), The Mean Green also control the boards (+4.9-third C-USA/49th NCAA), with 12.1 offensive rebounds per game (second C-USA/53rd NCAA). They also take good care of the ball (11.9 turnovers per contest-third C-USA/93rd NCAA). Three different players are in double figures for scoring, in the form of Tylor Perry (17.5 ppg-fifth C-USA/85th NCAA), Kai Huntsberry (11.4 ppg-20th C-USA) and Abou Ousmane (11.2 ppg-22nd C-USA). No other player on the roster contributes more than 6.0 ppg. Ousmane also tops the team in rebounding (6.4 rpg-seventh C-USA) and blocks per game (1.3 bpg-fifth C-USA) while Perry does so for steals (1.3 spg-17th C-USA). Perry loves the 3-point shot, with more than half of his attempts coming from distance. He is 66-141 for a sizzling 45.7 percent (first C-USA/eighth NCAA) on 3-point tries. He also does a good job of getting to the line (83-99) and making his tosses (83.8 percent-fifth C-USA). Notable North Texas alumni include \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin (professional wrestler), Jeff Coffin (Jazz saxophones member of Dave Matthews band) and \"Mean\" Joe Green (NFL Hall of Famer).\n\nLAST TIME OUT: #24 FLORIDA ATLANTIC 67, AT UTEP 59, (1/21/23)\n\nUTEP held to No. 24 Florida Atlantic to 11 points below its seasonal scoring average but couldn't overcome a slow start and an off shooting night in a 67-59 setback in a physical contest in front of 5,421 fans at home on Jan. 21. The Owls bolted out to a 12-0 lead six minutes into the game to put the Miners in a big hole. The home side continued to battle as the game wore on but could get no closer than six the rest of the way. It marked the first time this season that UTEP never led in a contest. UTEP was hindered by shooting 30.8 percent from the floor (20-65), including 18.8 percent from 3-point range (3-16). FAU sank 42.6 percent overall (20-47), including 37.5 percent (6-16) from 3-point range. UTEP won the boards (43-40) against the C-USA leader in rebounding margin, aided by 16 offensive boards, held an 18-6 advantage in second-chance points and forced 20 turnovers that led to 19 points. The Miners also made a season-high 76.2 percent (16-21) from the free throw line. It wasn't enough, however, to compensate for falling behind big early. The Miners were led by Calvin Solomon's (season-high tying 16 points, 10 rebounds) second double-double of the year. Tae Hardy matched Solomon with 16 points to go along with three boards. Mario McKinney Jr. provided a spark off the bench with 11 points and seven rebounds while Otis Frazier III added six points and eight rebounds before fouling out.\n\nDOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE\n\nCalvin Solomon equaled his season high with 16 points to go along with 10 rebounds against No. 24 Florida Atlantic on Jan. 21. It marked his second double-double of the season, having also done so at UAB on Dec. 29. He has also now hit double figures in scoring in four consecutive contests, doubling his total of such games over the first 16 tilts of the campaign.\n\nKNOCKING DOWN SHOTS AT THE LINE\n\nUTEP connected on a season-high 76.2 percent (16-21) at the charity stripe against No. 24 Florida Atlantic on Jan. 21. That was aided by going 9-10 in the second half, which kept the Miners within striking distance.\n\nALTERNATING SCORING OUTPUTS\n\nThe past four games UTEP has put up 82 points at Rice (Jan. 14), 60 at Charlotte (Jan. 16), 81 vs. FIU (Jan. 19) and 59 against No. 24 Florida Atlantic. In order to keep the back-and-forth pendulum going toward an offensive outburst, UTEP will have to do so against the No. 3 scoring defense in the nation at North Texas on Saturday.\n\nTAKE CARE OF THAT BALL\n\nAfter four straight games with at least 18 turnovers, including a pair of 22+, UTEP has valued the basketball the past five contests (3-2 record). The Miners had 14 giveaways in the win against UTSA (Jan. 11), 12 in a buzzer-beating loss at Rice (Jan. 14), a season-low nine in the triumph at Charlotte (Jan. 16), 14 in the victory against FIU (Jan. 19) and 15 in a setback to No. 24 FAU (Jan. 21).\n\nCOMEBACK KIDS\n\nUTEP has had to overcome big first-half deficits to pull out the win in two of its four league triumphs this year. The Miners dug themselves a 19-6 deficit eight minutes into the contest at Charlotte (Jan. 16). UTEP recovered and closed the half on a 27-8 surge to take a lead it would never relinquish to match the second-biggest comeback under head coach Joe Golding. That rally for the win came on the heels from fighting back from a 14-point deficit (19-5, 11:57 1H) against UTSA. Similar to the game at Charlotte, UTEP countered with a 25-6 surge to take the lead for good in the biggest comeback under Golding and largest in three years. In the 2019-20 campaign, the Miners overcame a 19-point differential to knock off Rice (68-62, Feb. 22, 2020).\n\nNARROWING THE GAP\n\nAfter its first three defeats on the season were all by at least 15 points, the Miners' six setbacks since have been by a total of 23 points. UTEP either led/was tied or within two points inside of one minute of regulation in five of the six games. Each have been decided by eight points or less, including two by one point and another by two points.\n\nBEATING UP ON EACH OTHER\n\nFor the most part Conference USA team have been beating up on each other since the onset of league action. Only No. 21 Florida Atlantic (10-0) is undefeated in C-USA play. North Texas (8-3), Rice (6-3) and Middle Tennessee (6-4) are the only other teams above .500 within the league. The other seven squads are .500 or worse. UTEP is alone in sixth place at 4-5.\n\nSIMPLY THE BEST\n\nUTEP tops Conference USA in two different categories. The Miners pace the league in turnovers forced per game (18.0-10th NCAA) and steals per game (9.3-20th NCAA). They also lead the conference in overall (61,947) and average (4,765) attendance.\n\nNO QUIT IN THIS GROUP\n\nUTEP has three wins on the season when trailing by at least eight points, including coming back from 13+ points in two of them. The Miners posted a 14-point come-from-behind win against UTSA (Jan. 11), their largest rally in three years. They fought back from down 13 in a triumph at Charlotte (Jan. 16) and overcame an eight-point differential in a win against NC A&T (Dec. 21). UTEP also showed tremendous heart by erasing a 15-point deficit before succumbing in OT to Rice (Dec. 31), while twice fighting back from 10 down with under 10 minutes left in a 60-58 setback at LA Tech. It also wiped out a nine-point differential to lead by one with six seconds left before falling, 83-82, on a buzzer beater at Rice on Jan. 14.\n\nGETTING AFTER IT ON THE GLASS\n\nUTEP has won the battle of the boards in nine of the past 10 contests. Included in the stretch was a seven-game streak in which they were even or better on the glass, which was the longest surge since doing so in nine consecutive contests during the 2009-10 campaign. Overall, UTEP has a +2.7 rebounding margin (36.3-33.6), good enough for fifth in C-USA\n\nCRASHING THE OFFENSIVE BOARDS\n\nUTEP has pulled down 10+ offensive rebounds in nine of the past 10 games, including securing 16 offensive boards (second-highest total this year) against No. 24 Florida Atlantic on Jan. 21. There was also a streak of seven streak, which was the longest such run since posting eight in a row (twice) in 2008-09. UTEP's 11.3 offensive rebounds per game is third in C-USA and 95th in the country.\n\nLOCKING UP ON DEFENSE\n\nThe Miners have held four of the past six opponents to 61 points or less, which has dropped UTEP's scoring defense to 66.4 ppg. That figure is fifth in C-USA and 90th nationally.\n\nTIED FOR MOST OT GAMES IN REGULAR SEASON\n\nUTEP's four overtime contests this year tie the 1994-95 and 2011-12 Miners for the most such games in a regular season in program history.\n\nONE OT GAME SHY OF TYING SCHOOL RECORD\n\nWith one more overtime contest, this year's team will match the 1994-95 and 2011-12 teams for the single-season school record for overtime games at five. Both the '94-95 and '11-12 squads had four regular-season OT contests and one postseason OT tilt.\n\nBACK-TO-BACK OT\n\nThe Miners played back-to-back OT games at two different points this year, which is something that had never previously occurred at the school. Earlier this season, UTEP won consecutive OT games for the first time since the 2016-17 season (W, 88-87, FIU, 2OT, Jan. 14, 2017; W, 66-65, FAU, Jan. 16, 2017) with a double-overtime win against Alcorn State, (73-61, Nov. 22) and a 68-67 OT vanquishing of CSUB (Nov. 23). More recently the Orange and Blue dropped consecutive contests that both went to OT (L, 79-73, 2OT, at UAB, Dec. 23; L, 72-67, OT, Rice, Dec. 31).\n\nTALKING DOUBLE OVERTIME\n\nUTEP has had two games (1-1 record) go to double overtime this year, marking the first time in program history that the Miners have had multiple double-overtime games in the same season.\n\nLOTS OF OT UNDER GOLDING\n\nOverall, UTEP is now 69-49 all time in overtime contests, including 3-3 under head coach Joe Golding. The six OT contests under Golding tie with former head coach Tim Floyd as the most during the first two seasons on the sideline for a Miner head coach\n\nGUARDING THE THREE\n\nUTEP has kept 10 teams on the year to below 30 percent from the floor on 3-point attempts. The effort has helped the Miners sport a 3-point field-goal percentage defense of 31.0 to rate second in C-USA and 64th in the nation. That figure of 31.0 would be fourth all time at the school.\n\nTALKING INJURIES\n\nUTEP has battled through some injuries this season, with 24 man games across the board lost to injuries/illness. The breakdown is as follows: Malik Zachery (10 games), Jon Dos Anjos (six games), Otis Frazier III (three games), Mario McKinney Jr. (three games) and Carlos Lemus (two games) have all missed time this year.\n\nTHAT'S MORE LIKE IT IN THE SECOND HALF\n\nDuring the Miners' first seven contests of the campaign against Division I opposition, they had been outpaced by an average score of 40.1-31.4 (281-220) in the second half of those games. UTEP has made some progress, outscoring its foes during the second half in eight of the past 11 contests. That includes a +5 differential against No. 24 Florida Atlantic last time out.\n\nFREE THROWS WIN BALL GAMES?\n\nThe old saying goes that free throws win ball games, but UTEP is 6-4 (had been 5-1) on the season when shooting 60 percent or less in a contest and 5-5 when eclipsing that figure. Included in the win count when falling short of 60 percent was a 40.5 percent (15-37) effort in a 60-55 triumph against LA Tech on Dec. 17. It marked the first time the Miners had won a game with 20+ misses at the charity stripe since topping UTSA, 81-74, on March 5, 2016 (20-40). It was the lowest FT% in a contest since making 14.3 percent (1-7) in a 58-45 setback to LA Tech on Jan. 18, 2015.\n\nKNOCKING DOWN SHOTS\n\nUTEP nailed at least 40.0 percent of its shots in 17 of 20 games on the campaign. That includes surpassing 40 percent in the first 11 tilts of the year, the longest stretch to begin a season since the 2010-11 team did so over the initial 15 contests. The Miners have been particularly accurate with 2-point attempts, drilling 53.2 percent inside the arc.\n\nPACK THE DON\n\nUTEP is leading Conference USA in both overall attendance (61,947) and average attendance (4,765) in 2022-23. UAB is the closest team for total attendance (50,443) while WKU is second in average attendance (4,019). Last year the Miners led in overall attendance and were second in the league in average attendance.\n\nWAS RARE AIR TO HOME START\n\nUTEP shot out to 8-0 at home, joining the 2019-20 team (9-0 start) and 2003-04 squad (8-0 start) as the only this century to win its first eight home contests. The Miners are now 10-3 in El Paso, marking their fourth consecutive campaign with 10+ home triumphs. UTEP has a +10.3 (71.0-60.7 ppg) scoring differential in the Sun City. UTEP is shooting 45.8 percent compared to 38.7 by the foes, has a +3.5 turnover margin (15.5-19.1) and has taken nearly 100 more free throws (313-226) in those 13 contests.\n\nTAKING DOWN 2022 POSTSEASON TEAMS\n\nThree of the Miners' 11 wins this year have come against teams that played postseason basketball a year ago, including two that went to the NCAA tournament. UTEP knocked off NM State (2022 NCAA second round) and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (2022 NCAA first four), in addition to Alcorn State (2022 NIT). All three of those teams won their conference. UTEP also has a victory against LA Tech, which was a stellar 24-10 last season.\n\nWIN CLOSE\n\nNearly half (five of 11) of the Miners' victories this year have been by five points or less, demonstrating their toughness and grit. UTEP toppled NM State by three (67-64, Nov. 12), CSU Bakersfield by one (68-67, OT, Nov. 23), Texas A&M-Corpus Christi by five (72-67, Nov. 25), LA Tech by five (60-55, Dec. 17) and at Charlotte by two (60-58, Jan. 16).\n\nLOCK THEM DOWN AT THE DON\n\nUTEP has a scoring defense of 60.7 ppg at the Don Haskins Center this season, with opponents shooting 38.7 percent overall and just 27.3 percent from 3-point range. None of the 13 opponents have tallied more than 67 points (in regulation) in El Paso, with three held in the 50's and one in the 40's.\n\nFINISHING GAMES WITH THE LEAD\n\nEven though the Miners have had some close calls this year, they are 11-1 on the season when they have a lead with 5:00 to play in the contest. UTEP is also strong on the campaign (11-2) when up at the half.\n\nC-USA GOT IT DONE OUT OF CONFERENCE\n\nConference USA's 11 squads thrived out of conference, with a combined mark of 87-34 between the 11 programs. The league features four programs with top-100 NET rankings, in the form of FAU (17), North Texas (64), UAB (83) and Charlotte (94).\n\nGETTING TO THE LINE\n\nUTEP has been aggressive offensively, which has resulted in it going to the line often. The Miners are second in C-USA and 19th nationally with 22.8 free throw tosses per game, aiding by piling up 43 attempts against Alcorn State on Nov. 22. It marked the most free throw attempts by UTEP since taking 47 in a season-opening victory against Loyola on Nov. 14, 2016. UTEP's 13.9 free throws made per contest is fourth in the league and 103rd nationally. Aiding those figures was a 16-21 effort vs. No. 24 Florida Atlantic on Jan. 21.\n\nHARDY DOING IT ALL\n\nSouthern Miss transfer Tae Hardy is doing a little bit of everything this year, pacing the Miners in scoring (13.1 ppg-10th C-USA), rating third in assists per game (1.8) and steals per game (1.5-10th C-USA) and tied for fourth in total blocks (six). He's also shown endurance, placing second on squad at 31.7 minutes per game (11th C-USA). He is one of three Miners to start all 20 games (Shamar Givance and Calvin Solomon) are the others. Hardy has been a consistent scorer, tallying at least eight points in 17 contests. He has a quartet of 20+ point efforts. He has led or shared the top spot on the team in scoring in 12 tilts. Hardy also has a team-high 12 double-digit scoring efforts. He also has shown ice in his veins, nailing two free throws of the one-and-one variety with six seconds left to give UTEP a one-point lead at Rice (Jan. 14) before the Owls emerged victorious, 83-82, on a buzzer beater.\n\nGIVANCE THE LEADER\n\nEvansville transfer Shamar Givance, the only senior on the roster, has contributed in multiple ways this season while running the point for the Orange and Blue. He tops the team in assists per game (4.8-second C-USA/53rd NCAA) and playing time (32.2-eighth C-USA) while rating second in scoring (10.1 ppg) and steals per game (1.8-seventh C-USA), third for free-throw percentage (min. 10 FTA, 71.3 percent) and tied for fourth in rebounding (3.9 rpg). He has dished out at least five assists in 10 of the past 15 contests while surpassing double figures in scoring in eight of the past 10 outings. He has three double-doubles-all on assists and points-, doing so at UAB (17 points, 10 assists, Dec. 29), at Rice (16 points, 10 assists, Jan. 14) and against FIU (15 points, 10 assists, Jan. 19). That's the most double-doubles of that variety in six years since Dominic Artis had four during the 2016-17 season. Givance has shown the ability for clutch play, making two free throws with 3.0 seconds left to help lift UTEP to a 68-67 OT win against CSUB on Nov. 23. He also nailed a go-ahead 3-pointer with four seconds left in regulation at UAB before the Miners eventually fell in double overtime.\n\nSUPER MARIO\n\nNM State transfer Mario McKinney Jr. has been a big key for UTEP. After reaching double digits in scoring in five of his first seven appearances (all off the bench), he earned his initial start of the year against LA Tech on Dec. 17. He has since returned to coming off the pine where he can provide an instant spark for the Orange and Blue. Overall, McKinney Jr. is the leading scorer among reserves and third overall (9.9 ppg) on the team, aided by a career-high 24 points on the road against his former squad on Nov. 30. He is also third on the team for double-figure scoring efforts (nine) and rebounding (4.0 rpg) and fourth in steals per game (1.1 spg).\n\nFRAZIER III'S IMPACT FELT\n\nGeorge Mason transfer Otis Frazier III has been a valuable piece for the Miners in 2022-23 despite having to battle through some injuries that cost him three games. He has started 14 of 17 games played, rating third in offensive boards (26), tied for fourth in rebounding (3.9 rpg) and fifth on the squad in scoring (7.8 ppg). Frazier III is also tied for fourth in total blocks (six). He has done that while playing only 20.5 minutes per game. Frazier III is also connecting on 52.6 percent of his shots (fourth on team). His numbers are a stark improvement from his two years at George Mason, where he averaged 2.5 ppg and 1.7 rpg in 35 games played.\n\nONYEMA MAKING A LEAP\n\nAfter failing to reach double figures in scoring over his first two seasons with the Orange and Blue, forward Ze'Rik Onyema has done so in five contests this year (five straight to begin the season). He has also recorded his first career double-double (10 points, career-high 10 rebounds) in the win vs. Alcorn State on Nov. 22. He is second on the team in rebounding (4.2 rpg), third in field-goal percentage (59.7), fourth for offensive boards (23) and sixth for scoring (5.5 ppg). He put up 2.0 ppg and 1.6 rpg in 2021-22.\n\nCALVIN'S CORNER\n\nStephen F. Austin transfer Calvin Solomon has been an impact player for UTEP in his first year with the Miners. He is one of three players (Shamar Givance and Tae Hardy are the others) to have started all 20 contests on the season. Solomon leads the team in rebounding (6.1 rpg-10th C-USA), steals per game (2.2-third C-USA/30th NCAA) and offensive rebounds (42, 2.10/game-eighth C-USA) while placing second in assists per game (2.0) and checking in fourth in scoring (8.1). He has been on a tear in several categories of late, having produced double figures in scoring in four straight games (two over the first 16 contests). Over the past eight games, he is averaging 10.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg and 2.9 spg. He's the lone Miner to have at least one steal in every tilt of the year and has 29 total thefts over the past 11 contests. Solomon has a pair of double-doubles on the year,with 16 points and 10 boards vs. No. 24 Florida Atlantic (Jan. 21) and 16 points and 11 rebounds at UAB (Dec. 29).\n\nKALU GETTING IT DONE\n\nKevin Kalu has done good work inside, tying for the team lead in field-goal percentage (66.7). Overall, he is putting up 4.4 ppg (1.5 ppg as a freshman last year). He is second on the team in offensive boards (29) and sixth in rebounding (3.7 rpg), which was aided by a career-high 10 boards at UAB (Dec. 29).\n\nMAKING THE MOST OF HIS MINUTES\n\nSophomore junior-college transfer Derek Hamilton has shown some potential in his 13 appearances off the bench this year. He is chipping in 3.1 points per game despite playing only 4.4 minutes per contest. Hamilton tops the team in free-throw percentage (min. 10 attempts) by going 8-10 (80.0 percent) and is second in field-goal percentage (66.7).\n\nPOINTS ACROSS THE BOARD\n\nSix different players are scoring between 5.5 and 13.5 points per game. Tae Hardy (13.1 ppg-10th C-USA), Shamar Givance (10.1 ppg) and Mario McKinney Jr. (9.9 ppg) lead the way. Calvin Solomon (8.1 ppg), Otis Frazier III (7.8 ppg), and Ze'Rik Onyema (5.5 ppg) round out the group. There have been 11 players (out of 13) to register at least one double-digit scoring contests.\n\nTURNOVER MACHINES\n\nUTEP is forcing the opposition into 18.0 turnovers per game to lead Conference USA and place 10th nationally. The Miners harassed the first eight foes to commit at least 15 turnovers, the longest stretch to begin a season since the initial 12 opponents did so in 1974-75. Six opponents have made at least 20 giveaways, including No. 24 Florida Atlantic (20 giveaways) on Jan. 21. Sul Ross State (Nov. 15) had 32, which was the most in nine years by a UTEP opponent. All but one team (Kent State-10, Dec. 22) has committed at least 14 giveaways. The Miners are on pace to force 576 turnovers, which would break the school record (573, 2007-08).\n\nGIVE ME THAT BALL\n\nUTEP's pressure defense has resulted in 9.3 steals per game to lead the league and rank 20th in the country. Aiding that figure was a school-record 24 steals in the victory against Sul Ross State on Nov. 15. Six different Miners had at least three steals in the contest to help them surge past the prior school standard of 21 which had stood since 1994 (against Cardinal Stich on Dec. 20, 1994). The Orange and Blue are currently on pace for 298 steals this season, which would break the school record (288, 2009-10). The charge has been led by Calvin Solomon (2.2 spg-third C-USA/30th NCAA), Shamar Givance (1.8 spg-seventh C-USA) and Tae Hardy (1.5 spg-10th C-USA), making the Miners the lone team in the league with three in the top 10 of the category.\n\nSTEALING THE SHOW\n\nShamar Givance piled up a career-high seven steals at UAB on Dec. 29, which ties as the most in program history against D1 opposition and rates tied for second overall at the school against opponents of all levels. His efforts helped the Miners post 12 steals. UTEP heads into Saturday's tilt with six contests of 10+ steals on the season, having done so most recently against No. 24 Florida Atlantic (Jan. 21) last time out.\n\nTHE BENCH BUNCH\n\nThe Miners' bench has provided at least 15 points in 17 of 20 games this year (13 with 24+ points), including going off for a season-high 51 against Sul Ross State on Nov. 15. UTEP's campaign best vs. DI foes is 34, which happened both at DePaul (Dec. 10) and against NC A&T (Dec. 21). Overall, UTEP reserves are contributing 25.5 points per game to rank second in Conference USA and 49th nationally. Super sub Mario McKinney Jr. has been vital in this category, tallying 9.9 ppg while coming off the pine in 16 of his 17 total appearances.\n\nWHAT A CROWD\n\nUTEP played in front of an almost capacity crowd of 11,315 fans in the win against NM State on Nov. 12. It marked the largest home attendance for the Miners since an actual sellout (12,000) of the Don Haskins Center when they beat WKU, 93-89, in a game commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1966 Texas Western NCAA Champions.\n\nTHERE WAS PLENTY OF PRODUCTION TO REPLACE\n\nBetween Jamari Sibley, Kevin Kalu and Ze'Rik Onyema, the Miners returned just 20.8 percent of their rebounding, 11.1 percent of their scoring and 9.0 percent of their assists from the 2021-22 squad. In total, the Miners lost four starters and 12 letter winners from last year's squad, including a pair of All-Conference USA performers in Souley Boum (second team) and Jamal Bieniemy (third team).\n\nNEW-LOOK TEAM\n\nUTEP lost four starters and 12 letter winners from last year's team, giving the Miners a new look in year two under head coach Joe Golding. UTEP brought in six Division I transfers (Otis Frazier III, George Mason, Shamar Givance, Evansville, Tae Hardy, Southern Miss, Garrett Levesque, Tarleton State, Mario McKinney Jr., NM State and Calvin Solomon, Stephen F. Austin) while adding four junior-college transfers (Jon Dos Anjos, Florida SouthWestern College, Derick Hamilton, Bossier Parish CC, Carlos Lemus, Chipola College and Malik Zachery, South Plains) and two true freshmen (Antwonne Holmes, Chapin HS, El Paso, Texas, and Jamal Sumlin, Rhodes HS, Cleveland, Ohio). It should be noted that Dos Anjos spent his freshman campaign at Loyola Marymount (Calif.) before going the junior-college route.\n\nEXPERIENCED D1 TRANSFERS\n\nThe Miners' six DI transfers combined to play in 379 contests, including making 165 starts, prior to their arrival in the Sun City. Shamar Givance (Evansville, 118 GP, 63 GS) and Calvin Solomon (Stephen F. Austin, 82 GP, 56 GS) are the most experienced of the bunch, but Otis Frazier III, George Mason, 35 GP), Mario McKinney Jr. (NM State, 38 GP, 5 GS) and Tae Hardy (Southern Miss, 30 GP, 26 GS) also have 30+ appearances.\n\nHOME COOKING\n\nUTEP got off to an 8-0 start at home (now 10-3), allowing it to join the 2019-20 team (9-0) and the 2003-04 unit (8-0) as the only this century to start at least 8-0. The Miners are scheduled to play 18 total times in the Don Haskins Center, with eight nonconference (finished 7-1) and 10 Conference USA tilts (3-2 thus far). The Miners have five home tilts remaining (all in C-USA) and have already secured a fourth straight season with 10+ home triumphs.\n\nLIFE ON THE ROAD\n\nUTEP started off 0-6 on the road, including dropping its first three C-USA contests by a combined nine points. The Miners either were leading/tied or within two points in the final minute of regulation in each of those tilts. The nine points was the smallest differential when starting 0-3 on the road in conference action in program history (happened 18 times previously). The Orange and Blue had a breakthrough last time out, rallying from 13 down to defeat Charlotte, 60-58, on Jan. 16. UTEP began the year at No. 12 Texas (L, 72-57, Nov. 7), its first true road game to start a year since a 73-61 victory at Pac-12 foe Washington on Nov. 21, 2000. Overall, the Miners will have 13 road games (1-6 thus far) on the year, with three nonconference (finished 0-3) and 10 in C-USA (1-3 thus far). UTEP went 7-6 in 2021-22 on the road, its first winning road record since forging a mark of 8-2 in 2013-14.\n\nNATIONAL SPOTLIGHT\n\nThe Miners will have 17 contests (3-6 thus far in situation) broadcast/streamed on nationwide platforms, with 13 on ESPN+ (3-3), and one each on ESPNU, FS1 (0-1), the Longhorn Network (0-1) and Stadium.\n\nA YEAR IN REVIEW\n\n- UTEP (20-14) posted its first 20+ win season since going 22-11 in 2014-15. It marked the 27th 20+ win campaign in program history.\n\n- The Miners notched their first postseason appearance since 2015 and first postseason win since 2009.\n\n- The Miners finished 11-7 in league play to secure their first winning conference record since forging a mark of 12-6 in 2016-17. That was aided by winning 10 of 14 down the stretch, including halting back-to-back C-USA West Division Champion North Texas' 15-game winning streak, 70-68, on \"Senior Day\" on March 5.\n\n- UTEP downed Old Dominion, 74-64, on March 9 for its first victory at the C-USA Championships in five years.\n\n- UTEP's seven road wins were the most since going 8-2 in 2013-14.\n\n- The Miners had their first winning road record (5-4) in league play since 2016-17.\n\n- UTEP's five league road wins surpassed its total (four) of such games from the prior three seasons combined.\n\n- UTEP had a six-game conference USA winning streak (Jan. 15 to Feb. 5), which was its longest since also posting six straight wins in 2016 (2/4-20/16). It marked the fifth winning streak of at least six C-USA games since the Miners joined the league in 2005-06.\n\nTHE BASIC FACTS ON UTEP\n\n- This is the 102nd season of UTEP men's basketball. The Miners made history by starting five African-Americans to defeat Kentucky, 72-65, and win the 1966 NCAA Championship on the way to inspiring the Disney hit movie Glory Road. Overall, UTEP has 17 NCAA Tournament appearances (last in 2010), 11 NIT bids (last in 2015), 12 conference championships (last in 2010) and 27 seasons with at least 20+ victories (last in 2022). The Miners have won five league tournaments (last in 2005).\n\n- The Miners have a strong presence in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame with Don Haskins, Nate Archibald, Nolan Richardson, the 1966 team and Tim Hardaway all representing UTEP.\n\n- UTEP finished 20-14 in 2021-22, which was its most wins since going 22-11 in 2014-15.\n\n- The Miners returned one starter (Jamari Sibley), and three letter winners overall. The two other returning letter winners are Kevin Kalu and Ze'Rik Onyema.\n\n- UTEP has 12 newcomers: Jon Dos Anjos, Otis Frazier III, Shamar Givance, Derick Hamilton, Tae Hardy, Antwonne Holmes, Carlos Lemus, Garrett Levesque, Mario McKinney Jr., Calvin Solomon, Jamal Sumlin and Malik Zachery.\n\nGET TO KNOW COACH GOLDING\n\nJoe Golding is in his second year at UTEP and is the 20th head coach in program history. He is the eighth head coach for the Miners since legendary Hall of Fame Coach Don Haskins retired following the 1998-99 season. Golding is 189-167 in his 12th season as a collegiate head coach, including 31-23 at UTEP. Last year he became the fourth head coach (20 total) in program history to have a winning season in their first year on the sideline. Don Haskins was the first when he directed the Miners to a mark of 18-6 in 1961-62. Doc Sadler (27-8, 2004-05) and Tim Floyd (25-10, 2010-11) also achieved the feat. Overall, the prior 19 head coaches combined to forge an average record of 9-13 in their first year with UTEP. Previously Golding spent 10 years at Abilene Christian (158-144), helping it transition from a Division II to a Division I program. Golding led the Wildcats to the 2019 and 2021 NCAA Tournaments, including a stunning upset as a 14-seed of third-seeded Texas in the first round of the 2021 Big Dance.\n\nPRESEASON PREMONITIONS\n\nUTEP was predicted to finish eighth out of 11 teams in Conference USA for the 2022-23 season, but keep in mind that last year's edition of the Miners was underestimated. The Orange and Blue were tabbed to finish in 10th place a year ago before tying for the fifth-most wins in league play by forging a mark of 11-7 in 18 C-USA tilts. Overall UAB was predicted to finish first, followed by WKU and North Texas at second and third, respectively.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUTEP wraps up a three-game roadswing with respective games at Middle Tennessee (7 p.m. MT/8 p.m. CT- Feb. 2) and at WKU (2 p.m. MT/3 p.m. MT-Feb. 4). Both contests will be carried nationally, with the game against the Blue Raiders airing on ESPNU while the match-up with the Toppers going on Stadium. Jon Teicher (42nd year) will be on the call on \"The Home of UTEP Basketball\" 600 ESPN El Paso.\n\nHelp support UTEP student-athletes by making a gift to the Miner Athletic Club.\n\nVisit givingto.utep.edu/mac today!\n\nMattress Firm is the Presenting Sponsor of UTEP Men's Basketball.\n\nFor complete coverage of UTEP men's basketball, be sure to follow the Miners on social media at @UTEPMBB (Twitter), @utepmbb (Instagram) and on Facebook @UTEPMensBasketball or visit the official home of UTEP Athletics at www.UTEPMiners.com"
