        "text": "After the greatest opening weekend in college football history, many of us were ready to write off the SEC.\n\nAmong the myriad reasons: SEC East favorite Tennessee nearly lost to Appalachian State in overtime; Arkansas almost fell to Louisiana Tech; and LSU's offense was a hot mess in its loss to Wisconsin at Lambeau Field.\n\nBut Week 2 revealed that the SEC probably isn't quite that bad. Sure, Kentucky looks to be historically awful, and uninspired Georgia nearly lost to FCS foe Nicholls before pulling out a 26-24 win at home.\n\nBut No. 1 Alabama rolled an opponent for the second straight week, beating Western Kentucky 38-10. Arkansas upset No. 15 TCU 41-38 in two overtimes, and Tennessee rebounded to beat Virginia Tech 45-24 at Bristol Motor Speedway.\n\nIt's easy to overreact early in the season. What we do know to be the truth: Another 27 FBS teams have no chance of reaching the College Football Playoff. The Eliminator has now eliminated 56 of the 128 FBS teams from playoff consideration after only two weeks.\n\nAmong the casualties this week: Power 5 teams California, Kansas, NC State and Purdue. Better luck next week, guys.\n\nHere's where FBS stands after Week 2:\n\nJump to Sections: Who's In | Still In Contention | On The Fence | Better Luck Next Season | Previously Eliminated\n\nWho's in\n\nThree of our four CFP teams are going to remain the same for the second straight week: No. 1 seed Alabama, No. 2 seed Florida State and No. 3 seed Michigan. But the No. 4 seed is going to change, with Ohio State replacing Houston. The Buckeyes beat Tulsa 48-3 at home, while the Cougars shut out FCS foe Lamar 42-0. The Buckeyes get their first big test at Oklahoma on Saturday. As long as the Cougars keep winning -- and get back injured quarterback Greg Ward Jr. soon -- they'll stay in the CFP mix. Clemson, which played Alabama for the CFP national championship last season, remains outside the top four after struggling on offense for the second week in a row in a 30-24 win over Troy.\n\nStill in contention\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nImagine what Alabama coach Nick Saban might have done (and said) if his team had beaten Western Kentucky by only three touchdowns.\n\nClemson Tigers\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nYeah, that's Florida State in front of Clemson and Louisville in its rearview mirror. The Tigers better kick it in high gear in a hurry.\n\nFlorida State Seminoles\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nFCS member Charleston Southern suspended 14 players from playing in its 52-8 loss at FSU because they improperly purchased school supplies from the bookstore.

Suckers.\n\nLouisville Cardinals\n\nTrending: UP\n\nAfter a record-setting start against Charlotte and Syracuse, Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson moves from Keeneland to Churchill Downs this week. No. 2 Florida State is coming to town on Saturday night, along with ESPN's College GameDay.\n\nMichigan Wolverines\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nRemember that time Colorado quarterback Kordell Stewart threw that long pass to Michael Westbrook? The Buffaloes play at the Big House on Saturday.\n\nMichigan State Spartans\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nIt has been 2,188 days since Michigan State defeated Notre Dame. But, hey, who's counting? The Spartans haven't won in the series since a 34-31 victory in overtime in 2010.\n\nOhio State Buckeyes\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nIt's almost criminal that Ohio State and Oklahoma have played each other only twice in their storied histories. Finally, after waiting 33 years, we'll get the third meeting in Norman, Oklahoma, on Saturday night.\n\nOklahoma Sooners\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nJust like last season, the Sooners might be able to rebound from an early-season loss and still reach the CFP -- if they can knock off the Buckeyes at home on Saturday.\n\nStanford Cardinal\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nNo, you didn't miss another Christian McCaffrey highlight show late Saturday night.

But they opened as a four-point underdog at Auburn on Saturday. Remember, there's a reason Las Vegas has really tall buildings.\n\nWashington Huskies\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nSomebody tell Huskies coach Chris Petersen that he's not still coaching at Boise State. The Huskies played Rutgers and Idaho the first two weeks and they'll host FCS foe Portland State on Saturday night.\n\nWisconsin Badgers\n\nTrending: UP\n\nMan, the Badgers are sure lucky LSU didn't play that Purdue quarterback at Lambeau Field.\n\nOn the fence\n\nAir Force Falcons\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nAir Force's Timothy McVey returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown in a 48-14 win over Georgia State. It was the Falcons' first kickoff return for a score since Oct. 9, 2010.\n\nArizona Wildcats\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThat wasn't a typo on the Bottom Line late Saturday night: Arizona trailed FCS foe Grambling State 21-3 at the half.

He had 185 all-purpose yards and ran 13 times for 137 yards with seven touchdowns.\n\nArkansas Razorbacks\n\nTrending: UP\n\nDan Skipper, a 6-foot-10 offensive tackle, might have saved the Hogs' season when he blocked TCU's 28-yard field goal with 10 seconds remaining in the game. The Razorbacks beat the No. 15 Horned Frogs 41-38 in two overtimes.\n\nArmy Black Knights\n\nTrending: UP\n\nAfter defeating Rice 31-14 on Saturday, the Black Knights are 2-0 for the first time since 1996, when they won 10 games, the most in the academy's history. Army has already matched its win total from last season.\n\nAuburn Tigers\n\nTrending: UP\n\nA week after struggling mightily on offense, the Tigers piled up 706 yards of offense in a 51-14 rout of Arkansas State, the second-highest total in school history. They had 712 yards of offense against Western Carolina in 2013.\n\nBaylor Bears\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Bears still haven't played anyone of consequence yet, and won't until they play Oklahoma State at home in two weeks. But they're still one of only three unbeaten teams left in the Big 12.\n\nBoise State Broncos\n\nTrending: UP\n\nDon't sleep on the Broncos. They knocked off Washington State 31-28 last week and play at Oregon State on Saturday. Boise State and San Diego State don't play during the regular season, but might be on a collision course for the Mountain West Conference championship game.\n\nBoston College Eagles\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nAfter losing to Georgia Tech in Ireland, the Eagles stayed close to home and won 26-7 at Massachusetts, their first victory since beating Northern Illinois 17-14 on Sept. 26, 2015.\n\nCentral Michigan Chippewas\n\nTrending: UP\n\nWho cares if officials completely bungled the ending of the Chippewas' 30-27 upset of Oklahoma State? Colorado still counts its 33-31 win over Missouri in 1990.\n\nCincinnati Bearcats\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Bearcats' 38-20 win at Purdue on Saturday was their first road victory over a Big Ten opponent since winning at Indiana in 1957.\n\nColorado Buffaloes\n\nTrending: UP\n\nAfter beating up Colorado State and Idaho State in its first two games, Colorado is about to take a big step up in competition. The Buffaloes play consecutive road games at No. 4 Michigan and No. 22 Oregon the next two weeks.\n\nDuke Blue Devils\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nIt looks like it might be a long season for the rebuilding Blue Devils. They've turned the ball over eight times in their first two games.\n\nEast Carolina Pirates\n\nTrending: UP\n\nAfter defeating NC State 33-30, the Pirates have won six consecutive games against ACC foes. They'll get a chance to make it seven straight when they play at Virginia Tech on Sept. 24.\n\nFlorida Gators\n\nTrending: UP\n\nYeah, the Gators looked good against Kentucky, just like they did in each of the previous 29 seasons. We're reserving judgment until after their Sept. 24 trip to Tennessee.\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Bulldogs survived a 26-24 win over FCS foe Nicholls in coach Kirby Smart's home debut. Georgia was favored to win by 55 points. The Bulldogs can't blame that one on Mark Richt.\n\nGeorgia Southern Eagles\n\nTrending: UP\n\nEasy, Eagles. It's a little premature to call yourselves the best FBS team in the state.\n\nGeorgia Tech Yellow Jackets\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nAfter beating FCS foe Mercer 35-10 last week, the Yellow Jackets host Vanderbilt on Saturday. Georgia Tech hasn't lost to the Commodores since 1941, going 11-0-1 since then.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nAfter losing to North Carolina 48-23, the Illini will try to avoid becoming the second straight Big Ten team to lose to Western Michigan, which knocked off Northwestern 22-21 in Week 1.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nA big sign of progress for the IU defense: It already has forced six takeaways in two games after getting only 22 in 13 games in 2015.\n\nKansas State Wildcats\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Wildcats had an extra week to fix their mistakes from their opening loss at Stanford. They'll have more time to get better in consecutive nonconference games against Florida Atlantic and FCS foe Missouri State.\n\nLSU Tigers\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nQuarterback Danny Etling, who was 2-10 in his 12 games as a starter at Purdue in 2013-14, came off the bench to lead the Tigers to a 34-13 win over FCS foe Jacksonville State. Tigers coach Les Miles hasn't said whether Etling will start Saturday night's SEC opener against Mississippi State.\n\nMarshall Thundering Herd\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nAfter beating FCS foe Morgan State 62-0, the Thundering Herd play Akron on Saturday, before back-to-back games against ACC foes Louisville (home) and Pittsburgh (road).\n\nMaryland Terrapins\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThere's a good matchup of first-year coaches in Orlando, Florida, this week: Maryland's D.J.

They'll play Kansas at home on Saturday.\n\nMiami Hurricanes\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nSomebody owes new Hurricanes coach Mark Richt an apology. Miami's trip to Appalachian State doesn't look scary or anything.\n\nMinnesota Golden Gophers\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nJunior college transfer Kobe McCrary, who led the country with 22 touchdowns at Butler (Kansas) Community College last year, ran 17 times for 176 yards with two touchdowns in a 58-28 rout of FCS foe Indiana State.\n\nMissouri Tigers\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nMissouri's Drew Lock is the only SEC quarterback averaging more than 300 passing yards per game.

He was 4-10 against the Ducks as Oregon State's coach in two different stints.\n\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels\n\nTrending: UP\n\nThe Tar Heels must have really taken something out of Georgia in Week 1.\n\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish\n\nTrending: UP\n\nNotre Dame's secondary suffered another big blow when starting cornerback Shaun Crawford was lost for the season with a torn Achilles tendon in last week's 39-10 win over Nevada. Starting safety Max Redfield was dismissed from the team following his arrest during preseason camp.\n\nOklahoma State Cowboys\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nWhat was the biggest surprise from the Pokes' getting jobbed in their 30-27 loss to Central Michigan? OSU coach Mike Gundy took it like a man. Well done.\n\nOle Miss Rebels\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nDon't worry, Rebels. I'm sure Alabama coach Nick Saban probably doesn't remember that you beat his teams in each of the past two seasons.\n\nOregon Ducks\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nOlympic hurdler Devon Allen, fresh off the Rio Games, caught four passes for 141 yards with one touchdown in the Ducks' 44-26 win over Virginia. He joins Florida A&M's Bob Hayes (1964), West Virginia's James Jett (1992) and Texas' Marquise Goodman (2012) as active NCAA players who competed in the Olympics.\n\nOregon State Beavers\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Beavers had a week off after losing to Minnesota 30-23 in Week 1. After losing 10 straight games, they should finally get into the victory column against FCS foe Idaho State on Saturday.\n\nPenn State Nittany Lions\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nPenn State's offensive line might be a little motivated this week. The Nittany Lions allowed 10 sacks in a 27-10 loss at Temple last season, which was Penn State's first to the Owls in 74 years.\n\nPittsburgh Panthers\n\nTrending: UP\n\nSo that's why Penn State doesn't want to play Pitt every year (or is it vice versa?).\n\nRutgers Scarlet Knights\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nFCS member Howard led by two touchdowns in the first quarter, before the Scarlet Knights exploded for 52 straight points for a 52-14 win.\n\nSan Diego State Aztecs\n\nTrending: UP\n\nIt might be time to add San Diego State tailback Donnel Pumphrey to the list of Heisman Trophy candidates. He ran for 281 yards with three touchdowns in the Aztecs' 45-40 win over California. He passed Marshall Faulk to become the school's all-time rushing leader, and he's the active leader in FBS in rushing yards, rushing touchdowns and 100-yard games.\n\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks\n\nTrending: UP\n\nThe Gamecocks lost 27-14 at Mississippi State last week, but might have found themselves a quarterback. Freshman Brandon McIlwain came off the bench and threw for 126 yards with two touchdowns on 11-for-22 passing.\n\nSouth Florida Bulls\n\nTrending: UP\n\nThe best individual performance you might have missed on Saturday: USF quarterback Quinton Flowers passed for 350 yards with four touchdowns and ran for 53 yards in a 48-17 win over Northern Illinois.\n\nSouthern Mississippi Golden Eagles\n\nTrending: UP\n\nThe Golden Eagles allowed 41 yards of offense, the fewest ever surrendered in a game in Conference USA history, and only three first downs in a 56-0 rout of FCS foe Savannah State on Saturday.\n\nSyracuse Orange\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Orange are definitely playing faster under first-year coach Dino Babers. But the Syracuse defense also gave up points pretty quickly in a 62-28 loss to Louisville at home on Friday night.\n\nTCU Horned Frogs\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Horned Frogs allowed 82 points in their first two games. They didn't allow that many points until their 10th game in 2010, when they went 13-0 and won the Rose Bowl.\n\nTexas State Bobcats\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Bobcats had an extra week to prepare for a grueling two-game stretch in which they'll play at No. 24 Arkansas and host No. 6 Houston.\n\nTexas Tech Red Raiders\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nRed Raiders quarterback Patrick Mahomes is on pace to throw for 6,649 yards in 13 games, which would shatter the FBS single-season record of 5,833, set by Texas Tech's B.J. Symons in 2003.\n\nToledo Rockets\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe balance of power in the MAC might have shifted to the West. The Rockets are one of three 2-0 teams in the West Division; every team in the East has already suffered at least one loss.\n\nUCLA Bruins\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Bruins have to be breathing a sigh of relief after last week's 42-21 win over UNLV. Defensive tackle Eddie Vanderdoes left the game with a left knee injury, but it's believed to be only a strain.\n\nUSC Trojans\n\nTrending: UP\n\nThe Trojans bounced back from a dismal opener against Alabama by beating Utah State 45-7 last week. They're headed in the right direction going into Saturday night's Pac-12 opener at Stanford. The Cardinal have won six of the past eight games in the series.\n\nUtah Utes\n\nTrending: UP\n\nThe Utes' sixth consecutive victory over BYU was hardly a work of art. Utah threw three interceptions and fumbled six times, losing three, in an ugly 20-19 victory.\n\nVanderbilt Commodores\n\nTrending: UP\n\nVanderbilt's Ralph Webb ran for 211 yards with two touchdowns in a 47-24 win over Middle Tennessee State, becoming only the third player in school history to run for more than 200 yards in a game. Frank Mordica was the last Vandy player to do it with 321 yards against Air Force in 1978.\n\nVirginia Tech Hokies\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThere were plenty of good things for the Hokies to take away from their 45-24 loss to Tennessee at Bristol Motor Speedway. They raced out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter and piled up 400 yards of offense. But they're not going to beat anybody turning the ball over five times.\n\nWake Forest Demon Deacons\n\nTrending: UP\n\nAfter beating Tulane 7-3 in their opener, the Demon Deacons had an offensive explosion in Week 2. They scored three touchdowns in a 24-14 win at Duke.\n\nWest Virginia Mountaineers\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nWest Virginia fans didn't get to see Bo Pelini's cat, but they did get to see a sideline tirade in the Mountaineers' 38-21 win over the Penguins.\n\nWestern Michigan Broncos\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nAfter losing 15 games in a row to Big Ten foes before this season, the Broncos can win two straight when they play at Illinois on Saturday. They knocked off Northwestern 22-21 in their opener.\n\nBetter luck next season\n\nAkron Zips\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nDon't worry, Zips, you're not the only ones who didn't know the Badgers would be this good.\n\nBall State Cardinals\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Cardinals lost 30-20 at Indiana, but they might still be better than Purdue.\n\nBYU Cougars\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThat's one way to put your stamp on a program. After the Cougars pulled to within 20-19 of Utah with 17 seconds left in the Holy War, first-year coach Kalani Sitake decided to go for a win. Unfortunately for him, Cougars quarterback Taysom Hill was stuffed short of the end zone.\n\nCal Bears\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Bears are allowing an average of 291 rushing yards per game, which is about 40 more than any other Power 5 school. They host No. 11 Texas next week.\n\nConnecticut Huskies\n\nTrending:EVEN\n\nDown 28-24 to Navy on Saturday, the Huskies had the ball at Navy's 1-yard line with 17 seconds left. Somehow, they used all 17 seconds for no gain.\n\nEastern Michigan Eagles\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nIf the Eagles don't start playing better, Central Michigan and Western Michigan might disown them. They're giving Directional U. a bad name.\n\nFlorida Atlantic Owls\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Driskel family vs. Miami: 613 yards, two touchdowns, five interceptions and a 0-3 record (courtesy of ESPN colleague David Hale).\n\nIdaho Vandals\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Vandals were walloped 59-14 at Washington Saturday. The good news: They get to play at Washington State next week.\n\nKansas Jayhawks\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nYeah, they probably should have let the Kansas students tear down the goalposts last week. The Jayhawks lost to Ohio 37-21 on Saturday.\n\nLouisiana Monroe Warhawks\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nHey, at least the Warhawks didn't have to play Nicholls this past week.\n\nMiddle Tennessee Blue Raiders\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nWith all due respect, it might be time to re-evaluate the defensive game plan after allowing 47 points to Vanderbilt.\n\nNevada Wolf Pack\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nNevada's Ahki Muhammad needs to send Clemson's Ray-Ray McCloud a thank-you note. Muhammad made an equally boneheaded play when he caught a kickoff and carried it out of the end zone, only to step back into the end zone and take a knee for a safety.\n\nNew Mexico Lobos\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Lobos blew a 9-point lead in the fourth quarter and lost to New Mexico State 32-31, their first loss to their instate rivals since 2011.\n\nNC State Wolfpack\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Wolfpack shouldn't feel too bad about losing to East Carolina again. The Pirates have also beaten ACC foes North Carolina and Virginia Tech twice since 2013.\n\nOld Dominion Monarchs\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nYeah, it probably wasn't a good week to play Appalachian State.\n\nPurdue Boilermakers\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nNo, you're not seeing things, Purdue fans. Somehow, there is a team (winless Northwestern) below you in the Big Ten West standings.\n\nSMU Mustangs\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Mustangs lost 40-13 at Baylor on Saturday. They play FCS foe Liberty next week in the second date of their Baptist university tour.\n\nSouth Alabama Jaguars\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nYeah, I'm guessing there were more than a few bottles of Zing Zang consumed in Mobile, Alabama, last week. A week after beating Mississippi State, the Jaguars still seemed to be celebrating until losing to Georgia Southern 24-9.\n\nTexas San Antonio Roadrunners\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Roadrunners had minus-1 rushing yards after allowing six sacks in a 23-14 loss at Colorado State.\n\nTroy Trojans\n\nTrending: UP\n\nThe Trojans should have known they weren't going to be on the right end of a borderline call at Clemson -- or two or three.\n\nTulsa Golden Hurricane\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nLook on the bright side: Tulsa's defense kept Ohio State's vaunted offense out of the end zone during the entire first half and then some.\n\nUCF Knights\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nFirst-year UCF coach Scott Frost said his players hit harder than Michigan's in a 51-14 loss at the Big House. Yeah, but the Wolverines ran, passed, caught, blocked and kicked better than the Knights.\n\nUNLV Rebels\n\nTrending: UP\n\nThe Rebels are already showing marked improvement under second-year coach Tony Sanchez. UCLA had only a 7-point lead in the fourth quarter before pulling away for a 42-21 win.\n\nUtah State Aggies\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Aggies' 45-7 loss at USC might have been very costly. Star running back Devante Mays, who ran for 208 yards with three touchdowns in Week 1, left the game with a leg injury and was using crutches on the sideline.\n\nUTEP Miners\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nThe Miners made a smart move by resting injured quarterback Zack Greenlee (knee) before the start of Conference USA play. He probably wouldn't have made much of a difference in a 41-7 loss at Texas.\n\nWestern Kentucky Hilltoppers\n\nTrending: EVEN\n\nThe Hilltoppers lost at Alabama by four touchdowns, but they did enough good things to tick off Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban.\n\nWyoming Cowboys\n\nTrending: DOWN\n\nTalk about a nightmare: The Cowboys trailed Nebraska 17-10 in the second half, but then had turnovers on six of their last seven possessions. Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen threw five interceptions and fumbled a lateral.\n\nPreviously eliminated"
