        "text": "Since becoming head coach of the BYU men's basketball program on April 11, 2005, Dave Rose has guided the Cougars to an impressive array of on-the-court awards and accolades while his unassuming approach to service and the community has been recognized at the top of his profession.\n\nWith a 348-135 record, Rose has produced a 14-year resume that is nearly unmatched. Among active head coaches, he is 11th in career winning percentage. His streak of 13-straight 20-win seasons (2005-06 to 2017-18) is tied for sixth all-time in NCAA history. Among the 40-plus coaches who took over a program in 2005, Rose has the best winning percentage (.720) and the most wins (348). Rose currently holds the school record for career winning percentage and is second in career victories. He reached the 200 career victory mark in his 259th game to make him the 15th fastest in NCAA history to reach the milestone. In 2016-17, Rose reached 300 wins in his 407th games, tied for 25th fastest in NCAA history.\n\nEqually committed to excellence off the court, Rose was honored on April 6, 2008, by the National Association of Basketball Coaches with its Game Pillar Award for Service, one of only four Pillar Awards (Education, Leadership, Service and Advocacy) that the Association annually bestows on the most deserving among its vast membership. While Rose has never sought such attention, his actions and accomplishments – both on the court and in the community – have commanded the praises of faithful followers and casual observers alike. In April 2008, Rose became the 63rd recipient of the Dale Rex Memorial Award, given annually to the person who has done the most for amateur athletics in the state of Utah. Further evidence of Rose's commitment to excellence is his basketball program received APR Public Recognition awards for seven-straight seasons (2006 to 2012) for its high academic achievement. In fact, the Cougars were the only Division I program to earn public recognition and a bid to the NCAA tournament every year from 2007 to 2012.\n\nIn 2018, Rose won the ESPN INFINITI Coaches’ Charity Challenge to raise more than $100,000 for the BYU Simmons Center for Cancer Research. In September 2018, the Simmons Center used those funds to create the David and Cheryl Rose Family Student Cancer Research Endowment, a fellowship for BYU students conducting cancer research.\n\nCougar fans have had plenty to \"Rise and Shout\" about with Rose at the helm. A tireless worker, gifted motivator and talented strategist, Rose has returned BYU to the national stage with five-straight seasons appearing in the top-25 polls (2006 to 2011), six-straight trips to the NCAA tournament, six-straight 25-win seasons (2007 to 2012) and four-straight seasons with a postseason victory (2010 to 2013) – all four are program-record streaks. Rose and the Cougars are also in the midst of two current streaks that are program records, including 13-straight 20-win seasons (2005-06 to 2017-18) and 13-straight trips to the postseason (2006 to 2018). In his first season, Rose and his staff produced the nation's second-most improved team by turning a 9-21 squad that finished tied for last with three wins in the Mountain West Conference in 2004-05 into a 20-9 NIT qualifier and 12-4 second-place MWC finisher in 2005-06. Under his tutelage from 2007 to 2009, the Cougars achieved the MWC's first back-to-back outright league championships (2007 and 2008) while adding to the streak with a share of the regular season title in 2009. Historically, the last time a BYU team garnered back-to-back outright league crowns was in 1979 and 1980 when the Cougars touted one of their all-time greats in Danny Ainge, while the last time the Blue and White produced three-straight titles was from 1932 to 1934. In 2010, BYU set a then-program record with 30 victories and defeated Florida in the first round of the NCAA tournament, the program's first NCAA tournament victory since 1993.\n\nIn 2010-11, Rose and the Cougars set numerous program records with 32 wins and a winning percentage of 86.5, a fourth conference title in five seasons and nine-straight weeks ranked in the top 10 (BYU was ranked the entire season), including a No. 3 ranking in both the AP and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches polls. BYU’s No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament tied the best seed earned by the Cougars in team history. With wins over Wofford and Gonzaga in the second and third rounds of the tournament, BYU reached the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1981. Statistically, BYU finished fifth in the nation in winning percentage and scoring margin, seventh in scoring offense, 10th in free-throw percentage, 15th in turnover margin, 16th in assist to turnover ratio, 17th in turnovers per game and 18th in 3-point field goals per game. Rose also coached the nation’s player of the year and NCAA Division I scoring leader Jimmer Fredette, who averaged 28.9 points per game.\n\nDespite the loss of Fredette and BYU's all-time steals leader Jackson Emery, Rose kept the Cougars rolling in 2011-12. With a 26-9 overall record and a 12-4 record in West Coast Conference play, BYU extended its streak of 25-win seasons to six, a program record. Rose also led the Cougars to a program-record sixth-straight NCAA tournament bid where BYU overcame a 25-point deficit to defeat Iona in the first round. The comeback set the record for the biggest comeback in NCAA tournament history. It also marked a program record as the Cougars won in the NCAA tournament for a third-straight season. Post players Noah Hartsock and Brandon Davies led the way for BYU and earned All-WCC first-team honors.\n\nRose and the Cougars improved their streaks of 20-win seasons and trips to the postseason to eight in 2012-13. BYU finished with a record of 24-12 overall and 10-6 in WCC play and received an invitation to the NIT as a three seed. In the NIT, BYU defeated Washington and Mercer at home and Southern Miss on the road to earn a trip to the semifinals at Madison Square Garden. The season ended with a loss to eventual champion Baylor. Tyler Haws and Brandon Davies earned All-WCC and All-District honors.\n\nThe 2013-14 season was highlighted by a 23-12 overall record, a second-place finish in the WCC, one of the toughest nonconference schedules in team history and a return trip to the NCAA tournament as a 10 seed for the team's seventh bid in eight years. After battling a nonconference schedule that featured wins over Stanford and Texas, Rose guided the Cougars to a 13-5 mark in league play that included a sweep of Saint Mary's and a home win over WCC champ Gonzaga. Tyler Haws and Kyle Collinsworth earned All-WCC honors and Haws was selected as the WCC Player of the Year.\n\nIn 2014-15, Rose led the Cougars to another 25-win season and a second-straight trip – and eighth in nine years – to the NCAA tournament, this time as an 11 seed. BYU's nonconference schedule was highlighted with wins at Utah State and at home against Stanford and UMass. The Cougars finished conference play by winning their last six-straight, including a win at No. 3/2 Gonzaga to close out the regular season. Tyler Haws finished the season No. 3 in the country in scoring and concluded his career as BYU's all-time scoring leader. Kyle Collinsworth set the NCAA single-season record for triple-doubles and tied the career record with six. Both players repeated as first-team All-WCC honorees.\n\nIn 2015-16, Rose and the Cougars finished 26-11 overall and 13-5 in WCC play. BYU advanced to the postseason for a 11th-straight season with a bid to the NIT. The Cougars won three straight at home to advance to the semifinals of the NIT at Madison Square Garden for the second time during Rose's tenure. Collinsworth equaled his triple-double total from the previous season to become the NCAA's all-time leader in career triple-doubles. Collinsworth and Chase Fischer earned All-WCC first-team honors while Nick Emery set numerous BYU freshman scoring and 3-point shooting records and earned All-WCC second-team and freshman honors.\n\nIn 2016-17, BYU finished 22-12 overall and 12-6 in WCC play while earning a second-straight trip to the NIT. Sophomore forward Eric Mika led BYU in scoring and rebounding while posting 17 double-doubles. He and freshman TJ Haws earned All-WCC First Team honors while Yoeli Childs and Haws were named to the All-Freshman Team.\n\nIn 2017-18, the Cougars were 24-11 overall and 11-7 in the WCC and received a third-straight at-large bid to the NIT. Junior guard Elijah Bryant and sophomore forward Yoeli Childs earned All-WCC First Team honors while TJ Haws received All-WCC Honorable Mention.\n\nAs the only BYU men's basketball coach to ever win top conference coaching honors in back-to-back seasons, Rose was named the MWC Coach of the Year in 2006 and 2007. In his second season, Rose coached the 2006-07 Cougars to a 25-9 overall record and a NCAA tournament berth after winning the MWC regular-season title with a 13-3 mark. In his first season, Rose received conference and USBWA District VIII Coach of the Year accolades as well as honorable mention for National Coach of the Year by Scout.com after turning a picked-to-finish-last 9-21 team into a 20-9 winner and NIT qualifier. After the record-setting 2010-11 season, Rose earned his third conference honor by being named co-coach of the year. He was also the USBWA District VIII co-coach of the year and a finalist for Naismith national coach of the year honors.\n\nRose first came to BYU as an assistant in 1997 to help newly hired head coach Steve Cleveland rebuild the Cougar program after a 1-25 season. Rose served eight seasons with Cleveland, including the last five as associate head coach, before being promoted to BYU's head job just two days after Cleveland announced his departure.\n\nRose played a vital role in rebuilding BYU's program from an inherited 1-25 team into a regular NCAA tournament participant and 20-game winner. BYU has qualified for postseason play in 11 of the past 12 seasons, including eight NCAA bids while claiming five MWC titles. Rose fulfilled a variety of responsibilities under Coach Cleveland, including defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator. His efforts earned notice, such as being named the top assistant in the Mountain West Conference by Street & Smith in the 2004-05 College Basketball Preview.\n\nA strong evaluator of talent with a vast network of coaching connections across the country, Rose has a proven record as a top recruiter. BYU has had multiple top-20 recruiting classes with Rose overseeing or coordinating its efforts. Rivals.com recognized Rose in 2004 as one of the top-25 college basketball recruiters.\n\nProving that Rose has excelled in recruiting and developing players, 16 recruits have earned conference newcomer honors or a major league award in their first season as a Cougar in Rose’s 20 years in Provo. Seven BYU players have been singled out as either the conference newcomer or freshman of the year. Most recently in 2017, TJ Haws became the first BYU freshman since Danny Ainge to earn first-team all-conference honors while he and Yoeli Childs were named to the All-WCC Freshman Team. Nick Emery earned All-WCC Second and Freshman Team honors after averaging 16.3 points in 2015-16. Tyler Haws was named third-team All-MWC as a freshman in 2010 and set the BYU record with 48-consecutive free throws without a miss. Jonathan Tavernari was named the 2007 MWC Freshman of the Year after fellow Cougar and second-team Freshman All-American Trent Plaisted received the same honor in 2006. Following is a list of conference honors earned the last 20 seasons by Cougar recruits in their first seasons.\n\nTJ Haws (2016-17 All-WCC Freshman Team, All-WCC First Team)\n\nYoeli Childs (2016-17 All-WCC Freshman Team)\n\nNick Emery (2015-16 All-WCC Freshman Team, All-WCC Second Team)\n\nEric Mika (2013-14 All-WCC Freshman Team)\n\nMatt Carlino (2011-12 All-WCC HM, All-WCC Freshman Team)\n\nTyler Haws (2009-10 All-MWC Third Team)\n\nJonathan Tavernari (2006-07 MWC Freshman of the Year)\n\nTrent Plaisted (2005-06 MWC Freshman of the Year, All-MWC Second Team)\n\nMike Hall (2003-04 MWC Defensive Player of the Year, All-MWC Third Team)\n\nRafael Araujo (2002-03 Newcomer of the Year, MWC media poll, All-MWC Third Team)\n\nJared Jensen (2001-02 MWC Co-Freshman of the Year)\n\nTrent Whiting (2000-01 MWC Newcomer Team, All-MWC Second Team)\n\nTerrell Lyday (1999-2000 MWC Newcomer of the Year, All-Tournament Team)\n\nMark Bigelow (1998-99 WAC Freshman of the Year, Newcomer Team, All-WAC Second Team)\n\nMekeli Wesley (1997-98 WAC Newcomer Team)\n\nRon Selleaze (1997-98 WAC Newcomer of the Year, Newcomer Team, All-WAC Second Team)\n\nWith 30-plus years of coaching experience – including 23 seasons as a head coach at the Division I, junior college and high school levels – Rose has a proven record of success. Prior to coming to BYU as an assistant in 1997, Rose compiled a 167-57 record at Dixie State College (St. George, Utah) while guiding six of his seven teams to top-20 rankings, including a national ranking as high as No. 2. He earned three conference titles and was honored by his peers as the 1993 Scenic West Athletic Conference Coach of the Year. While at Dixie, Rose coached three NJCAA All-Americans as well as long-time NBA player Keon Clark. On Sept. 14, 2013, Rose was inducted into the Dixie State Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\nAt BYU, Rose has coached eight players who have received All-America recognition – Mekeli Wesley (2001 AP honorable mention), Rafael Araujo (2004 Basketball Times Second Team, AP honorable mention), Trent Plaisted (2006 Scout.com Freshman Second Team), Keena Young (2007 AP honorable mention), Lee Cummard (2008 AP honorable mention, FOXSports.com Fourth Team), Jimmer Fredette (2010 third-team Sporting News and NABC, second-team Basketball Times, AP Honorable Mention and Lute Olson All-America team; 2011 first-team AP, NABC, John R. Wooden, Sporting News, USBWA), Tyler Haws (2014 and 2015 AP Honorable Mention) and Kyle Collinsworth (2015 and 2016 AP Honorable Mention and 2015 Lute Olson All-America team) – and four players who have been selected in the NBA Draft – Travis Hansen (2003), Araujo (2004), Plaisted (2008) and Fredette (2011). Fredette also earned numerous player of the year honors in 2011, including Wooden, Naismith, AP, Oscar Robertson and Sporting News.\n\nBefore his promotion to the head coaching position at Dixie, Rose served as a Rebel assistant coach under Ken Wagner for three seasons. Rose coached multiple sports at Millard and Pine View high schools in Utah before joining the staff at Dixie. He was the head basketball coach at Millard for three years from 1983-86. Rose is the 17th person to guide the Cougar basketball program since its first season in 1903. He follows the coaching pedigree of Basketball Hall of Fame coach Stan Watts, who is BYU's all-time leader in coaching victories with a 371-254 record from 1949-72. Watts also coached at Millard High School and Dixie State College before coming to BYU.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nRose was a two-sport athlete at Dixie State College in St. George, Utah, before the Texas native returned to his hometown, transferring to the University of Houston where he completed his degree and was a shooting guard and co-captain of the famous Phi Slama Jama team featuring Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. In 1983, his Houston team was ranked No. 1 nationally and finished as the national runner-up after suffering a buzzer-beating defeat to North Carolina State in the NCAA Championship game. Rose spent three years at Houston, playing in 1980-81, redshirting in 1981-82 and concluding his career in 1982-83.\n\nAt Dixie, Rose was first-team all-league in both basketball and baseball. Rose was also the Region 18 batting champion, hitting .421 as a center fielder. While playing basketball for Houston's Northbrook High School, he led the District 16AAAA in scoring, was selected first-team all-district and All-Greater Houston and was named team MVP.\n\nPersonal\n\nA native of Houston, Texas, Rose and his wife Cheryl have three children and eight grandchildren. Rose followed Steve Cleveland as the second BYU head coach to have served a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Rose served in Manchester, England, from 1977-79 between his two years as a player at Dixie State College. An important component in Rose’s success is the unwavering support and encouragement of his wonderful family. Rose’s wife Cheryl is actively involved in helping families who have children with cancer as she has served as the vice chairperson and an honorary chairperson for the Mac's Gift Children's Cancer Foundation. Daughter Chanell played forward on the BYU women’s basketball team from 2000-03 and is married to Brock Reichner, who was a member of the BYU men’s basketball team from 2004-06. His son Garrett served a mission in Little Rock, Arkansas, and married his wife Brooke in 2006. Rose’s daughter Taylor married her husband William in 2017.\n\nCommunity Service\n\nRose and the team annually provide service for the Mac's Gift Children's Cancer Foundation (formerly the Children with Cancer Christmas Foundation) to comfort local families who endure the challenges of raising a child who has cancer. Rose and his wife Cheryl currently serve as honorary chairmen for the foundation. The National Association of Basketball Coaches honored Rose with its Game Pillar Award for Service in April 2008. While at Dixie State College, Rose became the first coach in the state of Utah to participate in the American Cancer Society's nationwide Coaches vs. Cancer campaign and served on the Academic Excellence Committee at Dixie. He has also been a volunteer coach for youth groups. Dave and Cheryl were Chamber of Commerce Citizens of the Year in St. George. Cheryl is extremely committed to serving in the community, receiving the Beacon of Hope Award in 2005. She previously served as the Vice Chairperson for the Children with Cancer Christmas Foundation.\n\nAt the 2012 NCAA Final Four, Rose was named a member of the National Coaches vs. Cancer Council that includes Mike Krzyzewski (Duke), Roy Williams (North Carolina), Jim Boeheim (Syracuse) and Mike Brey (Notre Dame). He and Cheryl are currently assisting with the Hope Lodge, a facility that will be constructed in Salt Lake City to house families of cancer patients.\n\nThe fight against cancer became more personal for the family when Dave was diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cancer in June 2009. Since the emergency surgery to remove the tumor, no other cancer has been found. Rose has since been given a clean bill of health. The United States Basketball Writers Association recognized Rose for his efforts with its Most Courageous Award in 2010.\n\nWorth Noting"
