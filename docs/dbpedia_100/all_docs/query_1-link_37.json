        "text": "Jan. 29, 2016\n\nGame 19 Notes (at North Texas)\n\nRice Owls (3-15, 2-5 C-USA) at North Texas Mean Green (8-9, 3-4 C-USA)\n\nSaturday, Jan. 30, 2016 • 2 p.m. (CT)\n\nDenton, Texas • The Super Pit (10,500)\n\nBuy Tickets Online: Ticketmaster\n\nVideo Stream ($): C-USA Digital Network\n\nLive Stats:\n\nTwitter Updates: @RiceWBasketball | @MeanGreenWBB\n\nSeries Record: Rice leads, 4-3\n\nNEWS & NOTES\n\nOwls Return to Action vs. Mean Green\n\nFollowing a six-day break, the Rice Owls return to the hardwood on Saturday (2 p.m.) for their second meeting of the season against the North Texas Mean Green. The two teams squared off against each other back on Jan. 10 in Houston with the Owls winning an epic triple overtime thriller, 100-97. That game marked the highest combined score in Rice history. On Saturday the Owls will be looking to snap a four-game losing streak while North Texas has gone 2-2 since the 3OT loss.\n\nLast Time Out\n\nMiddle Tennessee's Brea Edwards connected on a game-winning three-pointer with four seconds remaining to hand the Owls a heartbreaking 61-60 loss last Saturday afternoon at Tudor Fieldhouse. Rice was led by junior forward Jasmine Goodwine, who poured in a team-high 22 points to go along with four rebounds, three blocks and two steals. Junior guard Maya Hawkins helped Goodwine in the scoring column with 14 points of her own and a game-high nine assists in 39 minutes.\n\nNorth Texas Scouting Report\n\nThe Mean Green are 4-5 at home this season and is coming off a dramatic 53-51 win over UAB in which Kelsey Criner scored the game-winning layup with two seconds left in regulation. Criner, who came up one rebound shy of the program's first triple-double in the first meeting vs. Rice, is averaging a team-best 16 points per game during C-USA play while shooting 49 percent from the field.\n\nGoodwine Overfloweth\n\nOver her last five games junior forward Jasmine Goodwine has raised her game to a new level offensively, averaging 16.2 points on 52 percent shooting while making 17-of-22 (77 percent) attempts from the free throw line. Last Saturday Goodwine scored 22 points vs. MT and blocked a season-high three shots.\n\nShots Starting to Drop\n\nThe Owls have shot 50 percent from the field in consecutive games for the first time since the 2013-14 campaign when Rice accomplished the feat against Southern (.509, 11/21) and Michigan St. (.500, 11/23).\n\nWhat's On Deck\n\nFollowing the game at North Texas the Owls finish the season by playing six of their final 10 games away from Tudor Fieldhouse, including road trips to Louisiana Tech (Feb. 4) and Southern Miss (Feb. 6)."
