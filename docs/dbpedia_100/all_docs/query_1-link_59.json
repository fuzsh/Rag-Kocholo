Chatman is the only returning starter from that group.\n\nThe Bluejays are trying to replace the most victorious senior class in program history, as Grant Gibbs, Jahenns Manigat, Doug McDermott and Ethan Wragge combined for 107 wins as well as 5,934 points, 872 three-pointers, 1,062 assists and 2,250 rebounds at CU. All four men are now playing professionally, including McDermott in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls after he averaged 26.7 points per game and swept 14 National Player of the Year awards last winter.\n\nScouting North Texas\n\nNorth Texas is 5-4 on the season, including a 5-1 record at home. The Mean Green own wins over Arkansas-Monticello, Nicholls State, Delaware State, Mississippi Valley State and Langston, and have lost to Iona, Arkansas, Oklahoma State and Stephen F. Austin.\n\nUNT is paced by Jordan Williams, who leads the team with 14.3 points, 2.6 assists and 1.9 steals per game, as well as 14 three-pointers.\n\nAlso in double-figures is Jeremy Combs (10.3 ppg., 6.3 rpg.). Combs shares the team-high in rebounds with Colin Voss (6.6 ppg., 6.3 rpg.).\n\nAs a team, the Mean Green average 66.9 points per game while allowing 67.1 per contest. North Texas shoots 43.9 percent from the field and 64.1 percent at the line while holding foes to 37.9 percent shooting from the field.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his fifth season as head coach at Creighton. He is 116-41 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 396-236 in his 21st season and is 265-172 in his 14th Division I campaign. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Patrick Sellers.\n\nTony Benford (Texas Tech, 1992) is in his third year as a head coach at the college level, owning a 33-40 record that doubles as his career mark. He'd previously been an assistant coach at Marquette, Nebraska, UTEP, Arizona State and New Mexico. Benford is assisted by Rob Evans, Scott Monarch and David Anwar.\n\nThe Series With North Texas\n\nCreighton owns a 5-4 lead in the all-time series vs. North Texas, but the Bluejays are 0-3 in Denton. CU is making its first trek to Denton since a 108-105 overtime loss in 1977.\n\nThe teams have met just once in the last 35 years, Creighton's 71-51 season-opening victory over the Mean Green in Omaha two years ago.\n\nGreg McDermott is 1-0 against North Texas and also 1-0 versus Tony Benford.\n\nLast Game\n\nCreighton scored the game's first seven points and never trailed in a 75-60 win over Texas-Pan American on Friday night in Omaha. Austin Chatman had 20 points while Toby Hegner added 16 points. Isaiah Zierden and Avery Dingman each had career-highs with six assists for the Bluejays.\n\nEarly Birds Get The Win\n\nWhen Creighton's offense gets rolling under Greg McDermott, the results have been evident. Creighton has won 50 straight games under McDermott when scoring 40 or more points in the first half.\n\nCU has also won 68 straight home games when scoring 40 or more points in the first half dating to a Feb. 3, 2002 loss to Southern Illinois, including a perfect 60-0 mark at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nAll I Want For Christmas Is 10 Wins\n\nCreighton is 9-3 heading into its final game before Christmas break. A win on Sunday would mark just the fifth time in program history the Jays own 10 or more wins by Dec. 25th. Each of the previous four times it's been done, Creighton won at least 22 games that year, including a postseason contest.\n\nMost Wins By Dec. 25th\n\nW-L Season Final W-L Postseason?\n\n11-1 2012-13 28-8 NCAA (1-1)\n\n10-1 2011-12 29-6 NCAA (1-1)\n\n10-2 2008-09 27-8 NIT (1-1)\n\n10-1 1963-64 22-7 NCAA (1-2)\n\nGuards Keep Going & Going\n\nGuards Isaiah Zierden and Austin Chatman have each played 120 minutes over the course of CU's last three games.\n\nZierden played 43 minutes off the bench vs. South Dakota, then added 42 more minutes in a starting role last Saturday vs. Saint Mary's. In the process, Zierden became the first Bluejay to play more than 40 minutes in consecutive games since Gary Swain in 1986-87.\n\nChatman owns 232 minutes played during the previous six games (38.7 mpg.), and has played a league-high 410 minutes this season.\n\nDespite logging heavy minutes, Chatman and Zierden have combined for 24 assists and just six turnovers in those 240 minutes of action while making 15-of-36 three-pointers and 26-of-30 free throws.\n\nMore Than Basketball\n\nRedshirt junior center Geoffrey Groselle has had quite the week.\n\nOn Thursday, Groselle finished the requirements to earn his undergraduate degree in Financial Analysis in just 3.5 years.\n\nOn Friday, he learned that he'd been accepted into Creighton's MBA program.\n\nOn Friday night, Groselle grabbed a career-best six rebounds in 11 first half minutes, with CU outscoring Texas-Pan American by 19 points with him on the floor.\n\nBirds of Prey\n\nCreighton has lost a total of 28 home games in the last 15 seasons, including a Dec. 13 setback to Saint Mary's. Following almost every setback, Creighton has taken out its frustration in its next regular-season home game.\n\nCreighton has followed all but two of its previous 28 home losses with a win in its next home game by an average of 15.11 points, including 17 double-digit triumphs.\n\nSince February of 2000, Creighton has suffered consecutive home losses just twice, as it fell to Kent State and Wyoming in 2004 and in 2011 it fell to Missouri State and Wichita State in consecutive home games.\n\nCreighton's Home Losses, Last 15 Years\n\nHome Loss Next Home Game\n\nL 67-71 (OT), St. Mary's W 75-60, Texas-Pan American\n\nL 72-75, Illinois St. W 59-45, Southern Illinois\n\nL 70-83, Boise St. W 80-51, Saint Joseph's\n\nL 68-89, Wichita St. W 81-79, Long Beach State\n\nL 65-77, Missouri St. W 76-59, Drake\n\nL 54-68, Wichita St. W 81-68, Bradley\n\nL 55-67, Missouri St. L 54-68, Wichita State\n\nL 65-77, #21 BYU W 82-75.

The suspension comes after an undisclosed violation of team rules.\n\nThe guard from Siler City, N.C., will not practice, play or travel with the team while under suspension. A decision on his standing within the program is not expected until after the Christmas break.\n\nMarathon Coming Up\n\nThe BIG EAST Conference will ring in the New Year with a full day of BIG EAST Basketball for the second annual New Year's Eve Tip-Off Marathon on FOX Sports 1. From noon until midnight, fans can watch the debut of the 2014-15 conference slate.\n\nFull schedule for the FS1 broadcast below (all times are Eastern):\n\n• St. John's at Seton Hall Noon\n\n• Butler at Villanova 2:30 p.m.\n\n• Marquette at DePaul 5 p.m.\n\n• Creighton at Providence 7:30 p.m.\n\n• Georgetown at Xavier 10 p.m.\n\nWill The Thrill\n\nWill Artino leads Creighton in both points per 40 minutes (17.8 ppg.) and rebounds per 40 minutes (11.6 rpg.) this season.\n\nAmong players to play 100 or more minutes in any season during Greg McDermott's tenure, Artino has consistently put up big numbers.\n\nIn those five seasons, a player has averaged at least 10.0 rebounds per 40 minutes 10 times, with Artino accounting for four of those seasons.\n\nMost Rebounds Per 40 Minutes, Since 2010-11\n\n(Minimum 100 minutes, Season)\n\nREB/40 Name Year\n\n12.4 Will Artino 2012-13\n\n12.2 Gregory Echenique 2011-12\n\n11.9 Will Artino 2011-12\n\n11.6 Gregory Echenique 2012-13\n\n11.6 Will Artino 2014-15\n\n11.3 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2010-11\n\n10.4 Zach Hanson 2014-15\n\n10.3 Doug McDermott 2011-12\n\n10.2 Gregory Echenique 2010-11\n\n10.0 Will Artino 2013-14\n\nMoving On Up\n\nAustin Chatman moved into seventh in Creighton history on the career assist chart, and now owns 429 in his career. Only seven previous men in school history have reached 400 career assists as a Bluejay.\n\nWith two helpers on Sunday, Chatman can pass Tyler McKinney (430 assists) for sixth place. Chatman and McKinney are the only point guards in program history to go 4-0 against Nebraska in their career.\n\nMost Career Assists (Since 1970-71)\n\nAst. Name Years\n\n570 Ryan Sears 1997-01\n\n549 Ralph Bobik 1971-74\n\n505 Antoine Young 2008-12\n\n498 Grant Gibbs 2011-14\n\n458 Randy Eccker 1974-78\n\n430 Tyler McKinney 2001-05\n\n429 Austin Chatman 2011-Pres.\n\n418 Vernon Moore 1981-85\n\n388 Josh Dotzler 2005-09\n\n382 Duan Cole 1987-92\n\nHigher and Higher\n\nAustin Chatman entered this month with a career-high of 19 points, but in five December contests he's averaged 20.2 points.\n\nChatman tied his career-high with 19 points in road games against both Tulsa and Nebraska, then upped the ante with 24 points in a Dec. 9 double-overtime win over South Dakota.\n\nAll 24 of his points against the Coyotes came in the final 16 minutes of regulation and the overtime sessions.\n\nOf Creighton's 26 points during the overtime, Chatman made or assisted all six field goals, and also drained five of the team's 10 free throws.\n\nHe followed that up with another 19 point effort against Saint Mary's last Saturday, then threw in 20 more points vs. Texas-Pan American on Friday.\n\nAwesome Austin\n\nAustin Chatman had identical stat lines in two games to start the month. In road games at Tulsa and Nebraska, Chatman had exactly 19 points, seven rebounds and six assists in both games.\n\nBefore Chatman, the last time a Creighton player had any game with at least 19/7/6 or more in each category was Ryan Sears at Southern Illinois on Jan. 8, 2000.\n\nBefore Chatman, Creighton's last player with two games of 19/7/6 in the same season was Rodney Buford, who did it in 1998-99.\n\nChatman also became the first Creighton player to own at least a share of the team in lead in points/rebounds/assists in consecutive games since Kyle Korver on Dec. 7 & 14, 2002.\n\nChatman was also stellar in the win over South Dakota on Dec. 9, finishing with 24 points and eight rebounds. In the process, he became the first Bluejay with 24 points and eight assists in the same game since Sears in the same Jan. 8, 2000 game listed above.\n\nThrough games of Wednesday, Dec. 17th, Chatman was the nation's only player with at least 150 points, 51 rebounds and 55 or more assists.\n\nCareful Chatman\n\nAustin Chatman owns a 57/17 assist/turnover ratio (3.35) early this season, a figure that ranked first in the BIG EAST and 14th nationally.\n\nLast season Chatman finished third in the BIG EAST with a 2.6 assist/turnover ratio, good for 29th nationally.\n\nFor his career, Chatman owns 429 assists compared to 194 turnovers, good for a 2.21 ratio. The man considered by many to be Creighton's best point guard in recent history, Ryan Sears, finished his career with a 2.26 assist/turnover ratio.\n\nChatman Of The Boards\n\nCreighton point guard Austin Chatman owned the team lead in rebounds just twice in his first three seasons (106 games) with the Bluejays.\n\nRecently, however, the diminutive Chatman has led Creighton in rebounds in six of the last 10 games.\n\nNo other player has led CU in rebounds more than four times this year.\n\nFor the season, Chatman is tied for the team lead with 44 defensive rebounds.\n\nTexas Two-Step\n\nCreighton will be playing games in the state of Texas for the first time since ending last season by splitting two games in San Antonio in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIncredibly, Creighton has not played a regular-season game in Texas since playing at TCU in 2001.\n\nCreighton owns three Texans on this season't team, Lone Star State natives Austin Chatman, Geoffrey Groselle and Leon Gilmore III.\n\nMore Success At Home\n\nCreighton has won 85 straight home games against teams that enter with a record of .500 or worse. The last team to upset the apple cart was Feb. 25, 2002, when Drake won at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nAmong The Leaders\n\nA look at where Creighton ranks among the national leaders, through games of Dec. 17th:\n\n-Austin Chatman ranks 28th in total minutes played, 14th in assist/turnover ratio and 27th in total assists.\n\n-Isaiah Zierden ranks 18th in free-throw percentage, 21st in three-pointers made and 26th in three-point percentage.\n\n-As a team, Creighton ranks 10th in free throws made, ninth in three-pointers made, 10th in free-throw percentage and 17th in three-pointers per game.\n\nSenior Trio Joins Elite Group\n\nSeniors Will Artino, Austin Chatman and Avery Dingman joined some elite company with Creighton's Dec. 7 win at Nebraska, as the trio became the rare Bluejay players to appear in four wins vs. Nebraska.\n\nCreighton's only previous six men to play in four career wins over the Cornhuskers were Kyle Korver, Joe Dabbert, Mike Grimes, Michael Lindeman, Tyler McKinney and Ethan Wragge.\n\nOf those six, only Korver and McKinney had never played in a loss against NU, something Dingman, Artino and Chatman can now claim.\n\nToughest Thing In Sports\n\nCreighton is 25-13 in true road games the last four years, and 41-19 when you also include neutral site games.\n\nLast year's team was 7-4 in true road games and 4-4 at neutral sites. Each of Creighton's last 11 NCAA Tournament qualifiers have had 10 or more road/neutral wins.\n\nCreighton is currently 1-1 in true road games this season, and 2-2 away from home when you factor in a pair of games in Niceville, Fla., during the Emerald Coast Classic.\n\nHalftime Lead A Key\n\nCreighton was 26-0 last year when leading at halftime, but just 1-8 when trailing at intermission.\n\nThis year's team is 6-1 when leading at half, 3-1 when trailing at halftime and 0-1 when tied at the break.\n\nCreighton has won all but one of its last 40 games played when leading at the half, falling only vs. Ole Miss on Nov. 28, 2014.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 194 regular and postseason contests at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time in the 12-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own an 168-26 (.866) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Thursday (7-0) or Friday (10-0).\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 14,751-12,464 in games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, an average margin of 11.79 points per game. Creighton has led wire-to-wire 52 different times, including seven times last season and four times already this year.\n\nCreighton is also 25-15 all-time in the 40 games at CLCO in which it's fallen behind by double-figures.\n\nCreighton is 71-8 (.899) at CenturyLink Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, including a 40-3 record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 187-26 (.878) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nCreighton's 24-game home win streak that was snapped by Saint Mary's on Dec. 13th was also the longest in facility history by Creighton. The school-record for longest home win streak is 28, done from 1917-1920 and again from 2002-04.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's longest home win streaks in the 12-year history of CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nStreak Dates Snapped By\n\n24 Feb. 19, 2013 - Dec. 9, 2014 Saint Mary's\n\n16 Feb. 9, 2005 - Jan. 31, 2006 Southern Illinois\n\n16 Jan. 19, 2010 - Dec. 22, 2011 Missouri State\n\n14 Feb. 2, 2008 - Dec. 28, 2008 Northern Iowa\n\n11 Nov. 22, 2003 - Feb. 4, 2004 Southern Illinois\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 14 victories under Greg McDermott after trailing by double-figures at some point, including three games this year, and seven such comebacks away from home.\n\nOn Nov. 19, Creighton trailed 42-24 to No. 18 Oklahoma with 18:30 to go before putting together a comeback for the ages. It was CU's largest comeback victory under Greg McDermott (see chart below), the second-largest since 2000 (see chart below), and the second-biggest in the history of CenturyLink Center Omaha (see chart, left column on page 2).\n\nOn the other hand, CU is 100-5 under McDermott when putting together double-digit leads, including wins 88 of the last 89 times.\n\nDouble-Digit Comebacks Under Greg McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\nLargest Double-Digit Comebacks Since 2000\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n19 (25-6) Wichita State 01/28/06\n\n18 (37-19) #17 Western Kentucky 11/27/01\n\n18 (42-24*) #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 (34-17) Missouri State 02/12/03\n\n17 (25-8) DePaul 11/09/07\n\n17 (52-35*) Rhode Island 03/18/08\n\n17 (31-14) at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 (53-37*) TCU 01/26/03\n\n16 (43-28*) at Drake 02/04/06\n\n16 (59-43*) New Mexico 11/16/08\n\n16 (31-15) at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n15 (54-39*) Wichita State 02/02/08\n\n*second half\n\nCome One, Come All\n\nCreighton has thrived when playing in front of large crowds of late.\n\nCreighton is 27-2 in its last 29 games played before 14,000 fans or more.\n\nSince the start of last season, Creighton has seen an average crowd of 14,623 in its 36 victories, and an average crowd of 9,162 in 11 losses.\n\nWinning With Defense...It's True\n\nCreighton held Middle Tennessee to 15 first half points and 47 points overall in its Nov. 29 win over the Blue Raiders.\n\nThat defensive effort helped CU withstand a drought of more than 16 minutes without a field goal, and a 3-for-14 second half showing from the field.\n\nCreighton's 57-47 win was its fewest points in a victory since a 57-56 home win over Wichita State on Jan. 16, 2010. CU had been 0-9 under Greg McDermott when scoring 57 or less before the victory, and lost 11 straight overall as a program in that situation.\n\nThe 15 points scored by MTSU were the fewest by any Bluejay opponent in a half since Savannah State scored 15 points in the first half on Dec. 16, 2009.\n\nZierden Earns Honor\n\nSophomore guard Isaiah Zierden was named to the All-Tournament Team at the Emerald Coast Classic. He led the Bluejays in scoring during three of the four games in the event, including both contests in Florida.\n\n7-Foot Surprise\n\nRedshirt junior center Geoffrey Groselle had the best game of his Bluejay career on Nov. 25th, finishing with 15 points on 7-of-8 shooting in just 12 minutes of playing time. His play earned him a pair of standing ovations from the more than 17,400+ fans at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nGroselle had owned just 44 career points in the first 36 games of his career before his outburst.\n\nGroselle has made 29-of-42 career field goal attempts, good for 69.0 percent.\n\n3-Headed Monster\n\nCreighton has used three men who alternate playing time at the “5” position for most of this season, Will Artino, Zach Hanson and Geoffrey Groselle.\n\nWhile none of them have stats that might jump off the page individually, as a collective group they're tough to beat, combining for 16.1 ppg. and 10.1 rpg. in 39.7 minutes per game, all while shooting 59.4 percent from the floor.\n\nName MPG FG-FGA RPG PPG\n\nArtino 17.8 38-69 5.2 7.9\n\nHanson 14.8 26-32 3.3 5.3\n\nGroselle 7.8 15-22 1.7 3.1\n\nTotal 39.7 79-133 10.1 16.1\n\nQuick Starts Key To Playing in Postseason\n\nCreighton has started off 3-0 (or better) in 14 of the previous 16 seasons, and has done so once again this winter. Each of Creighton's last 15 3-0 starts have been culminated in a postseason tournament appearance at the end of the year.\n\nCreighton also started 5-0 or better for the fourth straight year. The only previous time CU has started 5-0 in four straight years had come in a five-year stretch from 1916-17 to 1920-21.\n\nBalanced Offense\n\nCreighton owns five players who are averaging 7.9 points per game or more this season. Eight players have scored 12 or more points in a game this year, and CU has seen five different leading scorers.\n\nCreighton also has 10 different players with five or more rebounds in a game this year. The Bluejays have had a different player with 10 or more rebounds in four games this season after only having three players with double-figure rebound totals (McDermott, Gibbs, Artino) all last season. Three of those men (Chatman, Milliken, Brooks) are guards.\n\nRank And File\n\nCreighton jumped into the Associated Press Top 25 on Nov. 24th when the writers tabbed the Bluejays as the nation's 23rd-best team.\n\nCreighton is 86-33 as a ranked team in the AP poll, with a 52-21 mark under Greg McDermott (28-4 at home; 12-10 road; 12-7 neutral).\n\nPoll Position\n\nCreighton is one of 20 teams that have been ranked in the Top 25 in each of the last four seasons.\n\nThat select group features Arizona, Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisville, Michigan, Michigan State, North Carolina, Notre Dame, Ohio State, San Diego State, Syracuse, UCLA, UConn, Wichita State and Wisconsin.\n\nIncluding this week's poll result, Creighton has been ranked 40 times in 84 weeks of AP polls under Greg McDermott, and ranked between 26th-to-28th in nine other AP polls. The 40 weeks in the top-25 under McDermott is more than all other coaches in Bluejay history combined.\n\nMost Weeks in AP Top 25 at CU, By Coach\n\nGreg McDermott, 2010-Pres. 40 (of 84)\n\nDana Altman, 1994-2010 18\n\nTom Apke, 1974-81 5\n\nEddie Sutton, 1969-74 5\n\nGive Me Five\n\nA win over Eastern Illinois on Nov. 25 was Creighton's fifth straight victory this season. The Bluejays have now had at least one five-game win streak in 17 of the last 18 seasons.\n\nSince 1988-89, the Bluejays have made the NCAA's, NIT or CBI all 19 previous times they've had a five-game winning streak in a season, but missed the NCAA/NIT/CBI all seven times they haven't.\n\nIncluding this year, Creighton has started 5-0 or better in 10 of the last 17 years, including four straight campaigns. The only previous time CU started 5-0 in four straight seasons came during a five-year stretch from 1916-17 to 1920-21.\n\nHomestand To Start\n\nCreighton opened the 2014-15 season with a five-game homestand in the friendly confines of CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nThe homestand matched Creighton's longest to start a season since 1982-83, when CU opened with seven in a row at home. The 2003-04 team also opened with five straight home games.\n\nZierden Does It All From I to Z\n\nIsaiah Zierden scored in double-figures just three times in 28 games as a freshman, but he opened his sophomore season with four straight games (and 6-of-7) of 10 or more points.\n\nCreighton had just one player reach double-figures each of the first four games during the previous three seasons, Doug McDermott (2011-12 and 2013-14). McDermott would go on to earn First Team All-American accolades following each campaign.\n\nZierden is second on the Creighton team with 12.3 points per game and tops the BIG EAST with 2.75 three-pointers per contest.\n\nHanson Steps Up\n\nSophomore Zach Hanson had his best game as a Bluejay on Nov. 19 vs. Oklahoma, tying his career-high with nine points while sinking 4-of-4 shots from the floor and adding four rebounds and a steal in 18 minutes of work.\n\nHanson's basket with 51.4 seconds left and the score tied gave Creighton the lead for good.\n\nPlaying With The Lead\n\nCreighton has not trailed in four of its eight home games this season.\n\nIn 194 games at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time, Creighton has not trailed in 52 of those contests, a staggering 26.8 percent of the time, including seven wire-to-wire wins last season and four this year.\n\nDuring recently-ended Creighton's 24-game home winning streak, Creighton led wire-to-wire in 11 of those wins, and trailed for just 103:04 of 970 minutes of action. Only Oklahoma and South Dakota even led the Bluejays in the second half during that streak.\n\nWe Shall Overcome\n\nCreighton trailed by 11 points at halftime in its Nov. 19 comeback win over Oklahoma.\n\nIt was the first time Creighton trailed at halftime at home since Feb. 2, 2013 against Bradley. The Jays trailed 30-27 at the break but would go on to win, 75-58.\n\nThe 11 point halftime deficit was the largest in a home victory since trailing by 15 in the 2008 NIT against Rhode Island.\n\nCreighton improved to 7-3 all-time at CenturyLink Center Omaha in games in which it has TRAILED by 10 points or more at halftime.\n\nBackcourt Boarders\n\nSenior guard Austin Chatman had a career-high 11 rebounds in that Nov. 19 win over Oklahoma, three more than his previous career-high of eight.\n\nChatman became the first Bluejay player with a game of at least 17 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in the same game at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nLink Notes\n\nCreighton is 84-1 all-time at CenturyLink Center Omaha in games decided by 15 points or more.\n\nCreighton's 71-67 overtime loss to Saint Mary's on Dec. 13 dropped the Bluejays to 34-11 all-time at CenturyLink Center Omaha in games decided by five points or less.\n\nCreighton is also 14-2 in regular-season home games at CenturyLink Center Omaha decided by two points or less.\n\nWhat A Difference A Year Makes\n\nThe star of Creighton's team last year, Doug McDermott, scored 3,150 points as a Bluejay.\n\nThe players on the 2014-15 Creighton team have scored a total of 2,695 career points in a Bluejay uniform entering Sunday's game.\n\nLast year McDermott averaged 14.0 points in the first half of games. This year, the team's leading scorer (Austin Chatman) averages 14.3 points for an entire game.\n\nDouble-Double Opener\n\nCreighton has won either a conference regular-season title or conference Tournament each of its last seven seasons it has had a player with a double-double in the opener (2012-13, 2001-02, 1999-00, 1998-99, 1990-91, 1989-90, 1988-89).\n\nEach of Creighton's last two players to open the year with a double-double (Doug McDermott in 2012-13 and Kyle Korver in 2001-02) were named MVC Player of the Year and MVC Tournament MVP.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because Will Artino had 14 points and 10 rebounds vs. Central Arkansas in this year's opener.\n\nArtino, who played just 17 minutes vs. Central Arkansas, also became the only Bluejay in the last 25 years to have a double-double in 17 minutes or less.\n\nBig Margin Leads To Big Things\n\nThis year's Creighton team scored 104 points against Central Arkansas on Nov. 14, a good omen for things to come.\n\nNine of Creighton's 19 all-time NCAA Tournament teams have scored 90 or more points in their season-opener.\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's last seven teams to score 90 or more in a season-opener.\n\nFinal Post-\n\nScore Opponent Date W-L Season\n\n104-77 Central Arkansas 11/14/14 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n107-61 Alcorn State 11/08/13 27-8 NCAA\n\n97-65 N. Carolina A&T 11/11/11 29-6 NCAA\n\n106-50 Texas-Arlington 11/17/02 29-5 NCAA\n\n96-50 Western Illinois 11/20/00 24-8 NCAA\n\n93-48 Towson State 11/14/98 22-9 NCAA\n\n93-47 UT-San Antonio 11/30/90 24-8 NCAA\n\nCrowd Control\n\nCreighton's sellout crowd of 18,160 on Nov. 14 vs. Central Arkansas was its largest ever for a home-opener. It was also Creighton's largest home crowd for any November game, and the 12th-largest home crowd in program history at the time.\n\nCreighton has sold out 14 of its last 19 regular-season home games.\n\nWalk-On the Wild Side\n\nFor most programs, a walk-on might not see the court a whole lot. Creighton is not most programs.\n\nIn the season-opening win over Central Arkansas, Rick Kreklow led the Bluejays with 18 points.\n\nDating to last year, it marked the 17th straight game Creighton has been led in scoring by a walk-on.\n\nKreklow spurned several scholarship offers (including Butler, Nebraska and Missouri) to walk-on at Creighton this year.\n\nLast year Doug McDermott led Creighton in scoring during the final 16 games. He, too, was a walk-on as a senior.\n\nThe streak ended on Nov. 16 vs. Chicago State, but CU has still had a walk-on as a scoring leader for 17 of the past 28 games.\n\nWhose Line Is It Anyway?\n\nToby Hegner had 17 points, seven rebounds and two blocked shots on Nov. 16 in his second career game.\n\nHe's the first Bluejay with a 17-7-2 line since Gregory Echenique in the 2012 MVC Tournament vs. Evansville.\n\nHegner's predecessor at CU, National Player of the Year Doug McDermott, never had a game with 17-7-2 or better in his career.\n\nMilliken Joins Quad Squad\n\nJames Milliken's second career shot was a three-pointer from the corner in which he was also fouled. He would go on to successfully complete the rare four-point play.\n\nIsaiah Zierden became the second player this season to do it when he made a four-point play vs. Middle Tennessee on Nov. 29.\n\nIn Greg McDermott's five years at Creighton, the only six men to convert a four-point play have been Milliken, Zierden, Kaleb Korver, Ethan Wragge, Doug McDermott and Avery Dingman.\n\nOf that group, Zierden is the only one to do it twice.\n\nBluejay Debuts\n\nSenior transfer Rick Kreklow and redshirt freshman Toby Hegner both started on Nov. 14 in the season-opener vs. Central Arkansas. The last player to start their first game at Creighton had been Grant Gibbs, who started the 2011-12 opener. Gibbs was on his fourth year of college at that point, after spending two years at Gonzaga and redshirting one season at Creighton.\n\nHegner's start was especially historic, as he became just the third freshman to start since 1992-93, joining Bluejay legends Doug McDermott (2010-11) and Ryan Sears (1997-98).\n\nHegner became the first freshman in CU history to redshirt his first season, then start the season opener the following year, since freshmen became eligible until 1972-73. McDermott remains the last true freshman to start his first game.\n\nMcDermott Sweeps Player of the Year\n\nDoug McDermott swept all 14 National Player of the Year awards handed out by the media in 2013-14.\n\nHe was honored by the USBWA (Oscar Robertson Trophy), John R. Wooden Award, Naismith Trophy, Adolph F. Rupp Trophy, Associated Press, NABC, CollegeInsider.com Lute Olson Award, Sporting News, Basketball Times, NBCSports.com, CBSSports.com, BleacherReport.com, USA Today and Dick Vitale.\n\nIn addition, he was also honored with the Senior CLASS Award that took into account his off-court contributions.\n\nIt was McDermott's second year with such lofty honor. As a sophomore, he was named CollegeInsider.com's Lute Olson Player of the Year.\n\nMcDermott finished his career last March ranking fifth in NCAA history with 3,150 career points.\n\nNCAA Division I - Most Career Points All-Time\n\nRk.

Villanova was picked first with 81 points and nine first-place votes, while Georgetown (67, 1), St. John's (65), Xavier (52) and Providence (49) round out the top half. The predicted lower half was Seton Hall (43), Butler (28), Marquette (28), Creighton (25) and DePaul (12).\n\nThe ninth-place prognostication is the program's lowest mark since being tabbed 10th of 11 Missouri Valley Conference teams in 1995-96. That team tied for fifth in The Valley. It also snaps a streak of 14 straight years being picked fourth or higher in its preseason league poll.\n\nCreighton did not have any honorees on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Teams, which was led by Preseason Player of the Year D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera from Georgetown.\n\nThis marks the first time since 2009-10 that Creighton has not had the Preseason Conference Player of the Year. It's also just the sixth time in the last 20 years that Creighton did not have a first team all-conference honoree in the preseason.\n\nWho Are These Guys?\n\nCreighton returns just one regular starter (Austin Chatman) from last year's team that finished 27-8. Creighton's roster contains players who made 49 starts a year ago (also 7 by Will Artino and Avery Dingman last year), and entered the year owning a combined 85 career starts (Chatman 71, Artino 7, Dingman 7).\n\nThis year marks just the second time since 1986-87 that Creighton returns one starter or less (also 2007-08; Dane Watts).\n\nAdditionally, the 49 starts from a year ago ranks as the second-fewest in the same time span, as the 2007-08 team returned 44 starts prior to its 22-11 campaign.\n\nReturning Returning Starts Final\n\nYear Starters From Previous Year W-L\n\n2014-15 1 49 ? ? ?\n\n2013-14 4 144 27-8\n\n2012-13 4 140 28-8\n\n2011-12 3 101 29-6\n\n2010-11 4 123 23-16\n\n2009-10 3 106 18-16\n\n2008-09 3 83 27-8\n\n2007-08 1 44 22-11\n\n2006-07 4 120 22-11\n\n2005-06 4 134 20-10\n\n2004-05 2 58 23-11\n\n2003-04 3 101 20-9\n\n2002-03 5 159 29-5\n\n2001-02 2 65 23-9\n\n2000-01 3 90 24-8\n\n1999-00 3 84 23-10\n\n1998-99 3 84 22-9\n\n1997-98 4 72 18-10\n\n1996-97 4 126 15-15\n\n1995-96 4 100 14-15\n\n1994-95 2 52 7-19\n\n1993-94 3 73 7-22\n\n1992-93 2 64 8-18\n\n1991-92 2 51 9-19\n\n1990-91 4 132 24-8\n\n1989-90 4 127 21-12\n\n1988-89 4 123 20-11\n\n1987-88 3 83 16-16\n\n1986-87 2 65 9-19\n\n1985-86 1 48 12-16\n\n1984-85 4 124 20-12\n\n1983-84 3 72 17-14\n\n1982-83 3 77 8-19\n\n1981-82 2 78 7-20\n\n1980-81 4 112 21-9\n\nConsistent Challengers\n\nLast year's Creighton team finished second in the BIG EAST. Including last year, 12 of Creighton's last 17 teams have finished either first or second the regular-season race of league play. Two of the five that didn't won the MVC Tournament.\n\nThe Bluejays won the MVC in 2000-01 and 2012-13, tied for the title in 2001-02 and 2008-09. CU was second in the MVC in 1997-98 and 2006-07 and second last year in the BIG EAST, tied for second in the MVC in 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2005-06, and finished tied for third in 2004-05. The 1999-00 club was fourth in the MVC, but won the MVC Tournament, while the 2010-11 club tied for fourth place.\n\nCreighton's League Finishes, Previous 17 Years\n\n1st Place 2000-01, 2012-13 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\nTied for First 2001-02 (won MVC Tourn.), 2008-09\n\n2nd Place 1997-98, 2002-03 (won MVC Tourn.),\n\n2006-07 (won MVC Tourn.), 2011-12 (won MVC Tourn.), 2013-14\n\nTied for 2nd 1998-99 (won MVC Tourn.), 2003-04, 2005-06\n\nTied for 3rd Place 2004-05 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\n4th Place 1999-00 (won MVC Tourn.); 2007-08; 2009-10\n\nTied for 4th Place 2010-11\n\nNBA Representation\n\nThis year marks the first time since 1970 that Creighton has three NBA players at the same time, as Kyle Korver (Atlanta Hawks), Anthony Tolliver (Phoenix Suns) and Doug McDermott (Chicago Bulls) are all in the league.\n\nIncluding 2014-15, Creighton has now had an NBA player in 31 of the last 32 years.\n\nKorver ranks 15th in NBA history with 1,580 three-pointers and is also eighth in league history with 42.91 percent marksmanship from three-point range (through Dec. 19). Last year he set an NBA record with 127 straight games with a three-pointer, and in 2009-10 he set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range.\n\nTolliver ranked 15th in the NBA in three-point percentage with the Charlotte Bobcats (41.3 percent) last season.\n\nMcDermott is a rookie who was the 11th pick in the 2014 NBA Draft by the Denver Nuggets, then traded an hour later to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nKey Number From 3-Point Range\n\nCreighton's key number from three-point range seems to be 40 percent.\n\nIn the last four years under Greg McDermott, Creighton is 36-19 (.655) when shooting 40.00 percent or worse from three-point range. While respectable, that pales in comparison to CU's 57-6 (.905) mark the last four years when shooting better than 40.00 percent from downtown.\n\nLower the standards to 30%, and it's still impressive. Creighton is 82-12 in the past four years when shooting 30 percent or better from deep, compared to 11-13 when shooting 29.99 percent or less.\n\nLast season, Creighton led the nation with 41.4 percent shooting from deep, a figure that ranked ahead of 43 teams overall field goal percentage nationally.\n\nThree-Mendous Shooting\n\nCreighton owned 356 three-pointers last season, most in school history. The 2012-13 club set the previous school standard with 307 in 36 games.\n\nCreighton's 356 three-pointers ranked 11th-best in NCAA single-season history, and led the nation last year.\n\nIn addition, Creighton's 41.4 percent marksmanship from three-point range ranked tied for third-best in school history.\n\nLast year's Creighton team owned 173 three-pointers in BIG EAST play alone, breaking a conference record (in league play) of 155 first set by the 2004-05 Notre Dame team.\n\nNation's Best Offense?\n\nYou can make a case that Creighton boasted the nation's best offensive production last year.\n\nCreighton finished the 2013-14 season leading the nation with 41.4 percent marksmanship from three-point range, a 1.80 assist/turnover ratio and 356 three-point field goals.\n\nThe Bluejays were second in assists per game (17.5) and three-pointers per game (10.2), fourth in field goal percentage (.497) and total assists (614), 10th in fewest turnovers per game (9.8), 24th in both scoring average (78.7) and winning percentage and 29th in free throw percentage.\n\nBelow is where Creighton ranked nationally in the first four years of the Greg McDermott tenure:\n\nCategory Stat NCAA Rank\n\nFG Percentage .4897 1st\n\n3FG Percentage .4050 1st\n\nAssists 2,407 1st\n\nAssists/Game 16.60 2nd\n\n3FG Made 1,230 2nd\n\nAssist/Turnover Ratio 1.436 4th\n\n3FG Made/Game 8.483 5th\n\nFG Made 3,809 9th\n\nWins 107 15th\n\nWinning Pct. .7379 22nd\n\nGoing For 20, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 15 of the last 16 seasons, a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust five schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 16 years: Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas and Syracuse.\n\nAlong with Kentucky, Creighton is one of two schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 15 of the past 16 years.\n\nThat's better than traditional powers Arizona, Connecticut and Memphis (14 each) and also ahead of Michigan State, Pittsburgh and Wisconsin (13 each).\n\n10 Conference Wins x 18\n\nLast season's Creighton team won 10 or more league games for a 18th consecutive season.\n\nOn a national basis, the only other current school with at least 18 straight years of 10 or more league wins is Kansas (20).\n\nEach of the last 18 seasons has seen the team finish fourth place or better in the league standings as well, though all but one of those took place in the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\nPostseason x 17\n\nCreighton has made the postseason in 17 consecutive seasons. The only eight schools to make the postseason in each of the last 17 years are Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State and Syracuse.\n\nPostseason Win Streak\n\nThanks to an NCAA Tournament win over Louisiana last spring, the Creighton men's basketball team has now won a postseason game in a school-record seven straight seasons. The previous mark was three in a row from 1962-64.\n\nThe following four programs are the only ones that have won a postseason game in seven straight seasons, including 2013-14: Creighton, Kansas, North Carolina and Syracuse.\n\nEight Out Of 16 Tourney Titles\n\nCreighton owns eight league tournament titles in the last 16 years. On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this are Gonzaga (12), Duke (10), Winthrop (9) and Creighton (8).\n\nOn A Roll\n\nCreighton was a remarkable 84-22 during the previous three seasons. On a national basis, Creighton's 84 wins rank tied for 10th entering 2014-15, as seen below.\n\nMost Wins, Since 2011-12\n\nSchool '11-12 '12-13 '13-14 W-L\n\nLouisville 30-10 35-5 31-6 96-21\n\nWichita State 27-6 30-9 35-1 92-17\n\nSyracuse 34-3 30-10 28-6 92-19\n\nFlorida 26-11 29-8 36-3 91-22\n\nKansas 32-7 31-6 25-10 88-23\n\nKentucky 38-2 21-12 29-11 88-25\n\nGonzaga 26-7 32-3 29-7 87-17\n\nOhio State 31-8 29-8 25-10 85-26\n\nMichigan State 29-8 27-9 29-9 85-26\n\nCreighton 29-6 28-8 27-8 84-22\n\nNew Mexico 28-7 29-6 27-7 84-20\n\nFull House\n\nLast year's Creighton team averaged 17,896 in 16 home dates, good for fifth-nationally, and better than 16 NBA clubs.\n\nIt's the eighth straight season that CU has been among the nation's top 25 in average home attendance, and the third straight season in the top-six nationally in attendance, as well.\n\n2013-14 Attendance Leaders (Final)\n\nRk.

That streak dates to a Feb. 5, 1994 win against Wichita State.\n\nLong-Distance Streak Alive\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 692 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993.\n\nCreighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nStreak Week\n\nCreighton ranked fourth nationally in field goal percentage last season, making 49.7 percent of its shots from the floor.\n\nThe Bluejays have won 61 straight games when shooting 50.0 percent or better from the field since a loss to Wichita State in 2011.\n\nAll-time under Greg McDermott, Creighton is 59-1 when shooting 50.01 percent or better.\n\nSpecial Senior Class\n\nLast year's senior class featured four men who have graduated and moved on to the professional level; Grant Gibbs, Jahenns Manigat, Doug McDermott and Ethan Wragge.\n\nDuring the previous four years, the Jays went 107-38 while appearing in the postseason every season, claiming the 2012-13 MVC regular-season title, as well as the 2012 and 2013 MVC Tournament titles. The 29 wins in 2011-12 tied a school-record, as are the 57 wins from 2011-13 for a two-year span, the 84 wins from 2011-14 the mark for a three-year span and 107 wins are the most-ever in a four-year span at Creighton.\n\nIn those four years the team was 64-7 at home, including a 31-5 mark in league play at home, and that group was part of the first teams in school history to win NCAA Tournament games in consecutive seasons.\n\nThe quartet combined for 5,964 points, 2,250 rebounds and 1,062 assists while shooting a combined 872-2013 (43.3%) from three-point range at Creighton.\n\nMost Wins, 3-Year Stretch\n\nW-L Years\n\n84 2011-14\n\n80 2010-13\n\n76 2000-03\n\n72 2001-04\n\n72 2002-05\n\nMost Wins, 4-Year Stretch\n\nW-L Years\n\n107 2010-14\n\n99 1999-03\n\n98 2009-13\n\n97 2008-12\n\n96 2000-04\n\nClosing Strong\n\nCreighton has won 44 of its last 46 games when leading with 5:00 to play.\n\nOverall under Greg McDermott, Creighton is 107-6 when leading with 5:00 left. The Bluejays are also 3-0 under McDermott when tied with 5:00 to play.\n\nCU is 6-35 under McDermott when trailing with 5:00 left, with the last such rally coming on Nov. 19, 2014 vs. No. 18 Oklahoma.\n\nWinning Formulas\n\nBelow are the records for each current BIG EAST school over the previous four, eight and 14 (since 2000-01) seasons, ranked by overall wins, entering the 2014-15 season.\n\nThe three relative newcomers to the league, Butler, Creighton and Xavier, are at the top of nearly each category.\n\nMost Wins Since 2000-01\n\nTeam W L Pct.\n\nCreighton 335 136 .711\n\nButler 335 135 .713\n\nXavier 330 135 .710\n\nMarquette 314 151 .675\n\nVillanova 304 162 .652\n\nGeorgetown 303 153 .664\n\nProvidence 236 204 .536\n\nSeton Hall 228 209 .522\n\nSt. John's 213 221 .491\n\nDePaul 181 251 .419\n\nMost Wins - Last 8 Years\n\nTeam W L Pct.\n\nButler 209 73 .741\n\nCreighton 196 84 .700\n\nXavier 193 81 .704\n\nMarquette 188 89 .679\n\nGeorgetown 185 81 .695\n\nVillanova 182 90 .669\n\nProvidence 136 123 .525\n\nSeton Hall 132 125 .514\n\nSt. John's 131 128 .506\n\nDePaul 90 165 .353\n\nMost Wins - Last 4 Years\n\nTeam W L Pct.\n\nCreighton 107 38 .738\n\nMarquette 92 47 .662\n\nButler 91 51 .641\n\nGeorgetown 88 42 .677\n\nXavier 85 48 .639\n\nVillanova 83 50 .624\n\nProvidence 72 61 .541\n\nSt. John's 71 60 .542\n\nSeton Hall 66 66 .500\n\nDePaul 42 85 .331\n\nWhat A Start!\n\nGreg McDermott is 116-41 on the Creighton sideline in his fifth year at the helm. The 115 wins are easily the most in Creighton history in the first five seasons.\n\nHow good are McDermott's 116 wins after four seasons (plus 12 games)? The only coach to start his Creighton career with more than 108 wins after SIX seasons was Tom Apke (109). Apke also owned the best mark after five seasons, going 93-43 to open his career on the Bluejay sideline.\n\nMost Wins at CU, First Five Seasons\n\nCoach Years W-L After 5 Yrs\n\nGreg McDermott 2010-Pres. 116-41 so far\n\nTom Apke 1974-78 93-43\n\nEddie Sutton 1969-73 82-50\n\nTony Barone 1985-89 78-74\n\nRed McManus 1959-63 78-53\n\nPizza Pie, Piled High = Wins\n\nThanks to a promotion with Omaha-based Godfather's Pizza, Creighton season ticket-holders can get a free mini pizza any time the Jays score 75 points at home.\n\nHistory has proven that when the team earns the fans pizza, it often leads to a victory as well.\n\nThe first three years of CenturyLink Center Omaha (2003-06), Creighton needed 70 points to earn its fans free pizza, and the Jays went 27-3 when reaching that threshold, closing out that run with 12 straight wins.\n\nSince upping the standard to 75 points prior to the 2006-07 campaign, Creighton is a perfect 84-0 when scoring 75 points or more at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nIn other words, Creighton is a perfect 96-0 in CenturyLink Center Omaha since Feb. 6, 2005 when scoring enough points to earn its fans some free pizza.\n\nHome Run\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over five years ago, Creighton is averaging 78.41 points per home game (6,194 points in 79 home games).\n\nThat's a vital number since Creighton is 108-0 at home (79-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 78 points or more and 90-0 at home (63-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 80 points or more at home dating to a 92-83 loss to Southern Illinois on Feb. 19, 2000.\n\nFull House\n\nCreighton attracted eight of its 20 largest home crowds in program history last season.

Creighton was ranked in the Associated Press top-25 in 11-of-20 weeks and finished 16th in the year-end poll.\n\nDoug McDermott swept all 14 National Player of the Year awards after leading the team with 26.7 points per game and 7.0 rebounds per contest. He was also named BIG EAST Player of the Year and wrapped his career as the fifth-leading scorer in NCAA history with 3,150 points.\n\nEthan Wragge (10.4 ppg.) was named Honorable-Mention All-BIG EAST after finishing in the top-10 in both three-pointers made and three-point percentage.\n\nThe Bluejays led the nation in three-pointers made (356), three-point percentage (41.4) and assist/turnover ratio (1.80).\n\nAfter earning the program's first at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament since 2001, Creighton topped Louisiana before falling to No. 24 Baylor in the third round.\n\nShuttle Service Provided Again\n\nChief Bus will provide complimentary shuttle service from the Creighton University campus to CenturyLink Center Omaha for all men's basketball home games this season. The service is available to all fans, not just Creighton students.\n\nThe shuttle will start 75 minutes before tip-off and shuttles will continue to operate the route during the game.
