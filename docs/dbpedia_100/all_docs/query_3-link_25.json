        "text": "The Dallas Morning News’ high school sports reporter Greg Riddle compiled the top area volleyball players for the preseason all-area team and named a preseason player of the year. See which players made the cut below.\n\nPlayer of the year\n\nMacaria Spears, Plano Prestonwood Christian, outside hitter\n\nThe first-team All-American and MaxPreps national junior of the year is committed to Texas, which has won back-to-back national championships. Spears is rated the No. 1 player in Texas and the fifth-best player in America in the Class of 2025 by Prep Dig. She had 334 kills in 84 sets for a 36-4 team that won its second straight TAPPS 6A state championship and finished No. 4 in the MaxPreps national rankings. She was the 2022 Gatorade state player of the year and will be one of the top candidates for this year’s national player of the year award. She has 888 kills in her first two years at Prestonwood.\n\nRelated:2023 all-area volleyball: See individual awards, full first, second and third teams\n\nPreseason all-area team\n\nSuli Davis, Colleyville Heritage, outside hitter/setter\n\nThe BYU pledge is rated the second-best player in Texas in the Class of 2025 by Prep Dig, and this summer she was selected to train with the U.S. under-19 national team. Davis led the Texas Advantage Volleyball 18 Black club team to a national championship and was named the tournament MVP. She was a MaxPreps first-team All-American and an all-state pick as a junior after she had 793 kills, 528 assists, 484 digs, 93 blocks and a .455 hitting percentage for a 40-11 Colleyville Heritage team that reached the Class 5A state semifinals in its second straight trip to state.\n\nAlex Richter, Highland Park, outside hitter\n\nThe 6-2 Georgia pledge is one of the premier hitters in the state and had 716 kills as a junior last season for a 31-12 team. Highland Park is 112-22 over the last three years but will need another big season from Richter to win the newly aligned District 12-5A that includes regional finalist Frisco Reedy, regional semifinalist Frisco Wakeland and regional quarterfinalist Frisco Lone Star.\n\nGentry Barker, Lovejoy, outside hitter\n\nThe state’s No. 1 recruit in the Class of 2027 is coming off a remarkable freshman season in which she was an all-state honoree and led Lovejoy to its 10th state title in 17 seasons of varsity volleyball. Barker had a team-high 424 kills for a 34-10 team that won its fourth state title in five years and was No. 28 in the final MaxPreps national rankings. She was named the MVP of the Class 5A state final after recording a match-high 17 kills to go with 11 digs in a three-set sweep of Liberty Hill as Lovejoy won its eighth consecutive state tournament match. She helped the TAV 15 Black club team finish third at nationals and has had more than 30 Division I colleges reach out to her.\n\nRelated:Leopard legacy! See photos from Lovejoy volleyball's state title win\n\nDanielle Whitmire, Prosper Walnut Grove, setter/right-side hitter\n\nThe junior is ranked by Prep Dig as the third-best player in Texas in the Class of 2026. She is committed to NCAA powerhouse Penn State, winner of seven national titles. Whitmire was one of the most versatile players in the area last season, recording 382 kills, 450 assists and 335 digs in a two-setter offense.\n\nHannah Beauford, Prosper, setter/right-side hitter\n\nThe California pledge was sensational at the state tournament last year, recording 51 assists in a five-set semifinal loss to Class 6A state champion Conroe Grand Oaks — a match in which Prosper was one point away from beating the No. 2 team in the nation. Beauford was an all-state selection and averaged 29 assists per match in the playoffs as Prosper reached the state tournament for the first time since 2017. She will have to find a new go-to hitter to pass to after Prosper lost Gatorade National Player of the Year Ayden Ames, who has moved on to NCAA champion Texas.\n\nGillian Pitts, Plano Prestonwood Christian, libero\n\nThe Houston pledge was a first-team all-state and second-team all-area selection as Prestonwood won its second straight TAPPS 6A state championship. Pitts had 396 digs for the nation’s fourth-ranked team. She helped TAV 18 Black win an open division national championship in club volleyball.\n\nJulianna Hernandez, Frisco Memorial, libero\n\nThe Baylor pledge was one of the top liberos in the state last year, recording 640 digs. Hernandez is joined by Tulsa pledge Ava Steffe, who had 540 kills (4.6 per set) and 302 digs.\n\nKinsley Young, Southlake Carroll, middle blocker\n\nThe TCU pledge is the fifth-ranked recruit in Texas in the Class of 2026. She had 364 kills, 122 blocks and a .408 hitting percentage for a 31-win 6A Region I semifinalist team during an all-state sophomore season. Young will team up with San Diego State pledge Layla Austin to form one of the best duos in the Dallas area, as both had more than 300 kills last season.\n\nDe’Andrea McMillian, Mansfield Lake Ridge, middle blocker\n\nThe 6-3 Florida pledge transferred to Lake Ridge in the offseason after leading Wylie East to a 26-9 record and regional semifinal appearance as a junior last year. She had 113 blocks and 230 kills.\n\nFind more high school sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."
