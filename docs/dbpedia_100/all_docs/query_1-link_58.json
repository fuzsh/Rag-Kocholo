UNT is ranked 75th in the current NET rankings, as they are the second highest ranked team in the AAC behind 68th ECU. Before the season, the Mean Green were selected to finish 12th in the American, ahead of UAB and Florida Atlantic.\n\nThe Mean Green's scoring offense of 76.2 points per game leads the American, while being second in the NCAA in free throw attempts (28.4) and third in free throws made per game (19.0). While defensively, UNT ranks 26th nationally and first in the AAC in field goal percentage defense (35.1%).\n\nHEAD COACH\n\nJason Burton is in the middle of his first season with the Mean Green, the ninth head coach in program history. Burton recently concluded nine seasons at Texas A&M Commerce, where he was the all-time winningest coach and produced five All-Americans Under Burton's guidance, TAMUC entered their first season in Division I in 2022-23, reaching the semifinals of the Southland Conference Tournament following a 10-8 record in league play during the regular season.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nTommisha Lampkin posted 16 points and eight rebounds in the Mean Green's win over the Niners last season. In 2023-24, Lampkin is averaging 13.7 points per game on an efficient 61.9% shooting from the floor, which leads the American.

Within the conference, Kernal leads in free throws made and attempted per game, second in double doubles, fourth in steals, and sixth in points per game.\n\nRECAP OF NON-CONFERENCE\n\nCharlotte finished their non-conference slate with a 7-5 record, including going 4-1 inside Halton Arena while splitting their four away contests. Notable wins include a victory over ACC opponent Wake Forest, and a thrilling fourth quarter comeback on the road at Charleston Southern.
