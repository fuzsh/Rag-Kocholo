        "text": "College football is great. All the fanfare, all the action, the down-home style... nothing beats it! A lot of schools take part in college football and provide the same awesomeness it can provide as opposed to the pro football ranks.\n\nHowever, college basketball can be even more chaotic. Also, some schools don't have football at present, such as St. John's, Oakland, Marquette, Gonzaga, and many others. Nothing draws in more excitement than the National Championship tournament. If you make it that far and lose just one game- you're OUT, and the season is over. So college basketball is pretty awesome. If you agree, then this is your thread for discussion of the latest college basketball season and all of the news and notes of this season.\n\n2022-2023 Season Champions - Retrospect:\n\nNCAA D1 Men: Connecticut\n\nNCAA D1 Women: Louisiana State\n\nNCAA D2 Men: Nova Southeastern\n\nNCAA D2 Women: Ashland\n\nNCAA D3 Men: Christopher Newport\n\nNCAA D3 Women: Transylvania\n\nNIT Men: North Texas\n\nNIT Women: Kansas\n\nCBI: Charlotte\n\nNAIA Men: College of Idaho\n\nNAIA Women: Clarke (Iowa)\n\nNJCAA D1 Men: John A. Logan\n\nNJCAA D1 Women: Northwest Florida State\n\nNJCAA D2 Men: Milwaukee Area Tech\n\nNJCAA D2 Women: CCBC Essex\n\nNJCAA D3 Men: Brookdale\n\nNJCAA D3 Women: Rochester\n\nAs you can tell, this post is not intended for just NCAA Division 1 hoops. I invite ALL of you to discuss your beloved college basketball teams. Go ahead and discuss your NAIA college, your community college, even non-American college/university basketball. College basketball is college basketball regardless of it is NCAA Division 1 or not. So are you ready to tip off a new season of college hoops? Then let's get it! Chat away!\n\n... or my Houston Cougars' tournament run, Dolph Drago. The Men's Final Four was as \"Twilight Zone\" as you can get. I think not a single #1 seed was in the Elite Eight. Goes to show you the parity of college basketball and the brutality of the Transfer Protocol. Heck, even Omnis's Florida Atlantic Owls staged an improbable Final Four run before missing out on playing in the National Championship game.\n\nHere are the Top 25 Preseason standings heading into this season:\n\n--- NCAA Division 1 Men's Rankings (Preseason) ---\n\n01: Kansas\n\n02: Duke\n\n03: Purdue\n\n04: Michigan State\n\n05: Marquette\n\n06: Connecticut <- defending Champions\n\n07: Houston\n\n08: Creighton\n\n09: Tennessee\n\n10: Florida Atlantic\n\n11: Gonzaga\n\n12: Arizona\n\n13: Miami (FL)\n\n14: Arkansas\n\n15: Texas A&M\n\n16: Kentucky\n\n17: San Diego State\n\n18: Texas\n\n19: North Carolina\n\n20: Baylor\n\n21: USCal\n\n22: Villanova\n\n23: Saint Mary's\n\n24: Alabama\n\n25: Illinois\n\nAnd now, the women's ranks in NCAA Division 1...\n\n--- NCAA Division 1 Women's Rankings (Preseason) ---\n\n01: Louisiana State <- defending champions\n\n02: Connecticut\n\n03: Iowa\n\n04: UCLA\n\n05: Utah\n\n06: South Carolina\n\n07: Ohio State\n\n08: Virginia Tech\n\n09: Indiana\n\n10: Notre Dame\n\n11: Tennessee\n\n12: Ole Miss\n\n13: Texas\n\n14: Maryland\n\n15: Stanford\n\n16: North Carolina\n\n17: Louisville\n\n18: Florida State\n\n19: Baylor\n\n20: Colorado\n\n21: USCal\n\n22: Creighton\n\n23: Illinois\n\n24: Washington State\n\n25: Mississippi State\n\nAs for my Houston Cougars, it's already tough for my Coogs in Big XII football. I think Houston will stumble a lot in the Big XII in basketball. One big reason why? That school in Lawrence, Kansas. You know- Kansas University. The University of Houston will have to show they can hang with the better Big XII basketball schools. They got the right coach for the job, but do they have the talent to make themselves a viable threat this season? Can Houston possibly make the tournament and go further than in their previous appearance?\n\nFinally... October Madness? When I was looking at my YouTube home page, the University of Louisville supposedly lost at home in an exhibition to NCAA Division 2 school, Kentucky Wesleyan. Relax, Louisville Cardinals fans... it's just an EXHIBITION. It doesn't mean Louisville is going to go 0-30+ and miss the NCAA Tournament.\n\nAny other thoughts about the upcoming season are welcome.\n\nI didn't see all of it, but the University of Houston handed Xavier its first loss in the Big East-Big XII challenge (previously 4-0 in this challenge). We won 66-60. The Univeristy of Houston did good, however...\n\nDOWN GOES PURDUE!\n\nNorthwestern took down the top-ranked Purdue Boilermakers 92-88 in Overtime in Evanston, IL. So Purdue begins the 2023-2024 B1G campaign on the losing side. Rankings don't really mean much in college basketball. It isn't like college football or anything in regards to rankings. No. 1 just means you have a target on your back the size of Russia. Now it could help if you're doing at-large tournament berths, but I'm sure Purdue will be okay.\n\nBoth Houston and Purdue were top seeds in last season's Men's March Madness. Both doing well so far, also.\n\nNow for some extra musings...\n\nI got to give a shout out to Omnis' Florida Atlantic Owls. They made the Final Four last season and are currently 13th in the nation on the NCAA Division 1 Men's basketball side with a 5-1 record. You know who else is 5-1? Jordan's 12th-ranked Kentucky Wildcats.\n\nCurrent Top 25 undefeated teams as of the time of this post (December 2, 2023): Arizona, Houston, Baylor, BYU, Colorado State, James Madison, and Oklahoma.\n\nI hope you all are enjoying the latest season of college basketball for men and women. And don't worry- it's tough to go undefeated in men's NCAA college basketball.\n\n[UPDATE] UConn knocked off by Kansas, took them out of undefeated list.\n\nDOWN GOES PURDUE!\n\nNorthwestern took down the top-ranked Purdue Boilermakers 92-88 in Overtime in Evanston, IL. So Purdue begins the 2023-2024 B1G campaign on the losing side. Rankings don't really mean much in college basketball. It isn't like college football or anything in regards to rankings. No. 1 just means you have a target on your back the size of Russia. Now it could help if you're doing at-large tournament berths, but I'm sure Purdue will be okay.\n\nWhat is it about Northwestern? They took down Purdue when they were #1 last year, too.\n\nTurnovers, turnovers, turnovers. Purdue has to get that cleaned up. Northwestern had multiple guys in foul trouble a good portion of the game but kept themselves in it to win thanks to mistakes by Purdue. And missed layups. Edey had several that are normally automatic that didn't fall. Hopefully they rebound (no pun intended) and get back on the winning side. Non-conference games at the beginning of the season are one thing, but B1G play is always tough.\n\nLet's look at teams currently undefeated as of the time of this post...\n\n(all as of: January 2, 2024)\n\nUndefeated in Men's Hoops:\n\n#3 Houston (13-0)\n\n#19 James Madison (13-0)\n\n#22 Ole Miss (13-0)\n\nUndefeated in Women's Hoops:\n\n#1 South Carolina (12-0)\n\n#2 UCLA (12-0)\n\n#3 North Carolina State (13-0)\n\n#6 Baylor (12-0)\n\n#23 Texas Christian (14-0)\n\n#24 West Virginia (12-0)\n\nOregon State (12-0)\n\nBeing undefeated doesn't mean anything, but it does mean you're pretty good, especially if undefeated up to this point. It seems pretty cool the amount of depth in the Big XII for women's basketball. I am obviously proud of my U. of Houston Cougars. However, they're stepping into that mine field known as the Big XII. They'll have to deal with Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and others. Houston's first Big XII conference game is home against West Virginia this Saturday.\n\nStill a lot of basketball to go, but we are about to find out what teams will make their best claim to make the tournament and play for a National Championship. Get ready for this wild ride...\n\nHere are some musings in college hoops.\n\nMeet the University of Memphis. No. 10 in the nation heading into yesterday. They were 15-2 heading into last night. They hosted the University of South Florida Bulls, and what did Memphis do? Well, the Tigers led by at least 20... all to lose 74-73 to the South Florida Bulls. Some think if this Memphis Tigers make the Tournament, they could be one-and-done. They are now 3rd in the American Athletic Conference behind North Texas and Charlotte.\n\nHow are my University of Houston Cougars doing meanwhile? Well, we're in the teeth of Big XII play. They were bested in back-to-back games at Iowa State and at TCU. Even though we're currently 5th in the nation in men's hoops, we are 10th in the Big XII. Ouch. The Coogs recently defeated Texas Tech at home 77-54. Up next for UH is the team that stunned the Texas Longhorns recently- the UCF Golden Knights.\n\nGo B1G or go home. What's up with Purdue? @Dolph Drago 's Boilermakers will head into Saturday with a 16-2 record, 2nd ranked in the nation and 2nd in the Big Ten behind Wisconsin. Opposing them next go-round will be at the Iowa Hawkeyes on FOX Sports 1. The only two fails this season so far have been at Northwestern in Overtime and at Nebraska. Purdue is still projected as a possible No. 1 seed come tournament time.\n\nUp next... them Wildcats from the University of Kentucky by our illustrious leader, @Jordan . The 'Cats are 13-3 on the season and 8th in the Nation. They are also 4th in the SEC. Their losses so far have been to Kansas, UNC-Wilmington, and at Texas A&M. Some 'Dogs are coming to Rupp Arena for a cat and dog battle. It's Kentucky hosting the Georgia Bulldogs.\n\nFrom one pack of Wildcats to another. I don't know if @Yard_Sale follows basketball, but the Arizona Wildcats are 12th in the Nation and have a 13-4 record so far. They are 2nd in the Pac-12. They've lost to Purdue, Florida Atlantic, at Stanford, and at Washington State. Next for the Arizona Wildcats is hosting the UCLA Bruins.\n\nThe 23rd-ranked Florida Atlantic Owls have a 14-4 record and are 4th in the American Atheltic Conference. Their losses were to Bryant, Illinois, at Florida Gulf Coast, and at UNC-Charlotte (or just Charlotte these days). The Owls' next game is at the Roadrunners of the University of Texas-San Antonio.\n\nWhat's Oakland been up to lately? Well, the Golden Grizzlies are 12-8 on the season and lead the Horizon League. Their next game is at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay (or just Green Bay) Phoenix.\n\nThe New Jersey Institute of Technology, or NJIT, is 4-12 on the season and dead last in the America East. They will host the Maine Black Bears next.\n\nThe only women's college hoops musing for this post is that the Iowa Hawkeyes' Caitlin Clark is showing up and showing out. So much so, that she's helping drive viewers to watch women's college basketball. Caitlin Clark recently surpassed Britney Griner for 4th on the all-time scoring list. If/When Caitlin Clark joins the WNBA, she is going to be dangerous on the pro level.\n\nI hope you all are enjoying college hoops in 2023-2024. Keep on hoopin'!\n\nYou know, GTPlaneteers... check your calendars. Isn't it... February? That can only mean we are one month closer to the maddest month all year. You would think that some 330 or 340 schools all made the NCAA Tournament during the long history of March Madness. However, you'd be wrong considering some schools never made it to \"The Big Dance.\" Maybe some of these schools can get in for the first time in men's college basketball:\n\n--- Teams to Never Play in NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament (as of: February 2, 2024) ---\n\nArmy\n\nBethune-Cookman\n\nCentral Arkansas\n\nChicago State\n\nThe Citadel\n\nDenver\n\nElon\n\nGrambling State\n\nHigh Point\n\nU. of the Incarnate Word\n\nMissouri-Kansas City\n\nMaine\n\nMaryland-Eastern Shore\n\nMassachusetts-Lowell\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Alabama\n\nNew Jersey Institute of Technology\n\nNebraska-Omaha\n\nPresbyterian\n\nIndiana-Purdue-Fort Wayne\n\nQuinnipiac\n\nSacramento State\n\nSacred Heart\n\nSt. Francis College <<< recently retired athletics\n\nSouthern Illinois U.-Edwardsville\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nStetson\n\nCalifornia-Riverside\n\nUSC Upstate\n\nTennessee-Martin\n\nUT-Rio Grande Valley\n\nUtah Valley\n\nWestern Illinois\n\nWilliam and Mary\n\nYoungstown State\n\nSOURCE: @ncaasports on X/Twitter\n\nMaybe one or more of these teams get their first March Madness action in school history based on this list. Stay tuned to see if any of these teams make the NCAA Tournament next month.\n\nAlso, we got some powerful matchups coming up tomorrow. We got Houston at Kansas, the big one- Duke at North Carolina, and Tennessee at Kentucky. Enjoy this weekend's college hoops!\n\nHave you checked the men's AP Top 25 lately? There is a team there that hasn't been ranked in the NCAA Division 1 men's college basketball AP Top 25 since about 1978-1979. That school has a 22-3 record right now. That team? Indiana State University. The Sycamores are 23rd ranked in the nation. They're one ranking ahead of even Omnis' 24th-ranked Florida Atlantic Owls. Talk about coming out of nowhere!\n\nThe following teams also have 20+ wins on the season so far in the AP Top 25 besides Indiana State:\n\nConnecticut (22-3)\n\nPurdue (22-3)\n\nHouston (21-3)\n\nSouth Carolina (21-3)\n\nSaint Mary's (20-6)\n\nMaybe Indiana State can be a threat in March. I'm sure Larry Bird would approve. The Indiana State Sycamores made it all the way to being tops in the nation back in the 1978-1979 season. That season was with Larry Bird.\n\nThis is a cool story, honestly. You love it when a once powerful team gets \"on the come up\" and has one of their best performing seasons in a long while. That basically describes my U. of Houston Cougars. We had \"Phi Slamma Jamma\" back in the 1980s. We ended up returning to the Final Four after a long while a few years ago. Maybe Indiana State could get in as an at-large team, if they don't win the Missouri Valley Championship. Indiana State's next game is against the Illinois State Redbirds.\n\nBy the way, women's 2nd-ranked team, Iowa, lost at Nebraska; but Caitlin Clark is now only eight points away from surpassing the NCAA scoring record. She was 39 points away heading into the game at Nebraska. I do think she may become the next best women's star since Sabrina Ionescu if and when Caitlin Clark gets into the WNBA."
