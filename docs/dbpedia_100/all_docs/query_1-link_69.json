        "text": "PDF of UNA All-Decade Teams\n\nFLORENCE, Ala. -- The University of North Alabama completed its seventh decade of collegiate football competition in 2018 and the school's 2009-2018 Football Team of the Decade has been selected to celebrate that chapter in Lion football history.\n\nThere were 40 former Lions selected for the squad with 18 on offense, 20 on defense and two on special teams. All 40 players selected earned all-conference honors during the decade and 21 were All-American selections, including seven of the eight defensive backs selected.\n\nThe all-decade team was selected by a ten-member panel of media members,UNA athletic staff members and coaches.\n\nThe football program at UNA was reinstated in 1949 and all-decade teams have been selected for each of the seven decades since its return.\n\nNorth Alabama had a combined 85-32 record during the decade that included five Gulf South Conference Championships and seven trips to the NCAA Division II Playoffs. The Lions advanced to the 2016 Division II National Championship Game and also posted a 7-3 record in 2018 in their first season of NCAA Division I FCS competition.\n\nDuring the decade, UNA also produced 21 All-Americans, four finalists for the Harlon Hill Trophy as Division II National Player of the Year, three national finalists for the Upshaw Award as Division II Lineman of the Year and two National Defensive Players of the Year.\n\nLinebacker Michael Johnson, defensive lineman Montrell Craft and punter Will Batson were also previously named to the UNA Team of the Decade for 1999-2008. All three enjoyed stellar senior seasons in 2009 to earn a spot on the 2009-18 team as well.\n\nThe 2009-18 UNA Football All-Decade Team is led by quarterbacks Luke Wingo of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Jacob Tucker of Linden, Tenn., who tied in the voting. Both were finalists for the Harlon Hill Trophy during their respective senior seasons at UNA.\n\nThe offensive backfield includes running backs Chris Coffey of Decatur, Ala., and Lamonte Thompson of Florence.\n\nThe receiving corp is led by UNA's all-time leading receiver Dre Hall of Columbia, Tenn. He is joined by Lee Mayhall of Jackson, Tenn., Mico McSwain of Richton, Miss., Preston Parker of Delray Beach, Fla., T.J. Porter of Pahokee, Fla., and Jason Smith of Gurlery, Ala.\n\nThe All-Decade offensive line is led by All-Americans Stephen Evans of Boston, Mass., Tyler Sizemore of Apalachicola, Fla., Kyle Thornton of Dallas, Texas and Calvin Wilson of Hattiesburg, Miss. Other selections include Jamie Dixon of Muscle Shoals, Ala., Will Furlong of DeLand, Fla., Keith Jones of Birmingham, Ala., and David Lundberg of Winfield, Ala.\n\nFourteen players selected for the all-decade defensive team were All-Americans at UNA.\n\nOn the defensive line, All-Americans and Gene Upshaw Trophy national finalists Montrell Craft of Memphis, Tenn., and Courtney Harris of Jupiter, Fla., lead a group of six selections that also includes All-American Taylor Carney of Killen, Ala., Freddie Reed of West Point, Miss., Shaquille Smith of Jacksoin, Miss., and Steve Wesley of Bartow, Fla.\n\nThe linebacking corp includes two National Defensive Players of the Year in Michael Johnson of Panama City, Beach, Fla., and Tavarius Wilson of Jackson, Miss. They are joined by All-Americans Marcus Dowtin of Upper Marlboro, Mary., and Steven Rich of Savannah, Tenn., as well as Gabe Poe of Pheba, Miss., and Brion James of Hahnville, La.\n\nThe four cornerbacks selected include All-Americans Chad Daniel of Sipsey, Ala., Janoris Jenkins of Pahokee, Fla., and Philbert Martial of Mobile, Ala., along with three-time All-GSC selection Levi Fell of Muscle Shoals, Ala.\n\nAll four safeties named to the squad earned All-American honors during their careers with the Lions. That group includes Quinton Andrews of Miami, Fla., Chris Johnson of Gardendale, Ala., Floyd Jones of Town Creek, Ala., and Caleb Massey of Sulligent, Ala.\n\nAll-American Taylor Pontius of Biloxi, Miss., was selected as the kicker on the team of the decade, while two-time All-American Will Batson was named the punter.\n\nUNA FOOTBALL TEAM OF THE DECADE 2009-2018\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nJacob Tucker Linden, Tenn.
