        "text": "Redshirt Freshman Wide Receiver Noah Rogers met with the media after practice yesterday. He talked about his first year at Ohio State, how he’s adjusting in year 2, his relationship with Dave Doeren, and competition in the Wide Receiver Room.\n\nYou can watch the video ABOVE, or read the transcript BELOW.\n\nIn my one year at Ohio St., I learned how to grow faster. During that time, it just taught me to how to become a better man and player. I just learned different aspects about myself that I really wasn’t aware about.\n\nI learned a lot from Marvin Harrison Jr. On and off the field. Watching from afar, he’s a great player. Everything he does, I try to simulate, and see what I can do better.\n\n2nd College Fall Camp is a lot smoother. I feel like I know everything I’m doing now. Especially here, it’s clicking. I’ve just got to keep getting used to the pace of NC State’s offense.\n\nWhen I first met Coach Doeren, I was actually at Drake Thomas’ home visit. Lex and I were getting ready to go to a tournament in Florida. It’s pretty cool to see how far we’ve come in our relationship. Coach Doeren’s been great to me.\n\nIt’s always a competition with the Wide Receivers. Out on the field, in the weight room, shoot, probably in the meeting room, just knowing all your information. It makes it very competitive. Especially having great receivers like KC (Kevin Concepcion), Wesley (Grimes) and Dacari (Collins) beside me. We have competition every day. We actually got one right now. Whoever drops the most balls has to get dumped in the cold tub. We’ve all got one drop so far. It’s always a competition.\n\n_______\n\nRogers transferred to NC State this offseason from Ohio State. He ultimately chose the Buckeyes over the Wolfpack coming out of Rolesville High School (Rolesville, NC).\n\nON3 rated Rogers as a 5-Star prospect in the the 2023 class, and the #26 overall player nationally, the #3 Wide Receiver and the #1 player in the state of North Carolina.\n\nAs a Senior at Rolesville, Rogers had 39 receptions for 799 yards and 15 touchdowns. He also returned a Kickoff for a TD. As a Junior, he had 70 receptions for 1,432 yards and 22 touchdowns. He also returned a Punt for a TD.\n\nThis past season at Ohio State, Rogers played in 4 games (14 snaps), but didn’t record any stats.\n\n247Sports ranked him as the #39 overall player in the Transfer Portal this offseason, and the #6 Wide Receiver.\n\nESPN released their 2024 College Football Preseason Power Rankings today, and slotted NC State at #20.\n\nGeorgia\n\nOhio St.\n\nOregon\n\nTexas\n\nAlabama\n\nNotre Dame\n\nOle Miss\n\nPenn St.\n\nMichigan\n\nFSU\n\nMissouri\n\nUtah\n\nLSU\n\nTennessee\n\nClemson\n\nKansas St.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma St.\n\nMiami\n\nNC State\n\nArizona\n\nTexas A&M\n\nUSC\n\nKansas\n\nIowa\n\nHere’s what they had to say about the Wolfpack:\n\nNo. 20 NC State Wolfpack\n\nNC State has just one 10-win season in program history — all the way back in 2002 with Philip Rivers at QB — but there’s a strong case that this is as talent-rich an offensive unit as any the Wolfpack have had since that season. Along with rising sophomore KC Concepcion, coach Dave Doeren added a host of impact players in the portal this offseason, including center Zeke Correll, tailbacks Jordan Waters and Hollywood Smothers, receiver Noah Rogers, tight end Justin Joly and QB Grayson McCall. NC State is 17-9 over the past two seasons despite myriad QB issues and an offense that has averaged just 25 points per game (85th in FBS) over that span. Instead, the questions might be on defense — a unit that must replace All-American Payton Wilson. The job likely falls to converted safety Sean Brown, but he’ll be flanked by a solid secondary led by Aydan White and a veteran front. NC State’s schedule is another reason for optimism, but the Wolfpack will need to survive an arduous start with Tennessee in Week 2 and Clemson in Week 4 before enjoying the softer slate in October and November. — Hale\n\nWeek 1 matchup: vs. Western Carolina on Aug. 29 (7 p.m., ACC Network)\n\n(ESPN)"
