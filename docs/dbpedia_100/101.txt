The Coaches

Renowned for her top-notch recruiting classes, Marsha Frese enters her second season as head women's basketball coach at UMKC. Named as the Kangaroo head coach on April 25, 2012, Frese brings 16 seasons of experience as a Division-I player and coach to the UMKC campus.

Head coach Mike Petersen enters his second season in command of the Mean Green women's basketball program. In his first year, Petersen won 10 conference games in the team's final year of play in the Sun Belt Conference, marking only the third time the Mean Green has reached the 10-win plateau in SBC play and the first time since 2001-02.

The Venue

The North Texas Coliseum, better known as The Super Pit, is home to Mean Green men's and women's basketball and to a long and colorful history.

The nickname Super Pit derives from the Coliseum's predecessor, the Men's Gym, which was known as the Snake Pit, a moniker allegedly stemming from stories of the gym flooding in heavy rain which occasionally drove local snakes from their homes and into the building.
