She thanks Larry for his help in getting her the new job, just as her boss Bart, a producer, greets Larry and confirms they're on for lunch with the wives. Cha Cha keeps chatting but Larry manages to duck into the bathroom. When he exits, she comments: &quot;That was quick.&quot;</p><p>Before lunch, Jeff stops by and Larry complains that Cha Cha is like a bathroom monitor (1). When Jeff asks why Larry doesn't just go at home, he explains that Cheryl uses environmental toilet paper and he can't abide it. At the end of lunch with Larry, Cheryl, Jeff, Susie, Bart and his wife Barbara, Larry jokes with Bart that he can fire Cha Cha, it would be fine with him. Cheryl changes the subject, praising Barbara for attending lunch when they have nine children. Everyone is impressed except Larry, who finds it a little egotistical (2). Bart mentions his father has opened a retro barber shop and Larry and Jeff vow to try it. When the officious waiter Daviday comes to ask how everything was, Susie announces she'd like a doggie bag. When Daviday discerns that she is going to feed the food to her dog, he informs her that it is not the restaurant's policy (3) to allow that. As their argument escalates, Larry intervenes by asking to take the food home himself. Daviday demands to know if Larry intends to eat the leftover steak himself. When Larry promises he will, Daviday intones, &quot;We shall see.&quot;</p><p>Richard stops by to see Larry and suggests a double date with Cheryl and Cha Cha to see a movie. Larry says he'll have to check with Cheryl and confesses to Richard that Cha Cha isn't really working out, she's too chatty. Richard notes that she's told him Larry goes to the bathroom 10-14 times/day and they are both concerned. Larry loses his temper, accusing her of having bowel concern (4). Defending his bathroom habits, Larry challenges Richard to a colon contest (5). Fleeing their argument, Larry retreats to the bathroom. When he flushes, the sound -- like a sonic boom -- sends him reeling, and to the doctor for his ear.</p><p>During his exam, the doctor asks Larry a series of questions and when he gets to the question of whether he's urinating a lot, Larry gets defensive (6). He resists answering. Exasperated, the doctor recommends that Larry &quot;stay off the right ear&quot; (7) and talk to a therapist about his bathroom issues. Larry demands to see another physician but is told he'll have to make another appointment to see someone else: &quot;This isn't McDonalds,&quot; the doctor informs him.</p><p>As Larry leaves, a skinhead in the waiting room growls at him: &quot;What the f**k you looking at Jew boy?&quot; and calls him a &quot;f**king faggot.&quot; Shocked, Larry slunks out (8).</p><p>When Larry gets home, he is greeted by the Blacks who are upset about the toilet paper situation being like Port Authority toilet paper (9). Larry offers to get them soft toilet paper if they allow him access to their bathroom, and swears them to secrecy. He then pulls Leon aside and tells him about the skinhead incident. Leon tells him in those situations he needs to &quot;get in that ass.&quot; (10).</p><p>Larry calls Richard to confirm their double date and Cha Cha answers. She suggests they go to a fancy restaurant and he agrees to tell Cheryl. Struggling to talk lefty (11), Larry has to keep pulling the phone away from his ear. He asks Cha Cha what she's wearing. Confused, she asks if he means right now. But Larry has pulled the phone away from his ear and doesn't hear her. He starts to breathe heavily with the frustration of talking lefty and asks again what she's wearing. Disgusted, Cha Cha hangs up.</p><p>Larry is enjoying his old-fashioned haircut at the barber shop and chats with Bart's father. When the barber asks if everything seemed OK with Bart, because Barbara just had a miscarriage, Larry brushes it off: &quot;They already have nine kids.&quot; Upset, the barber tells Larry he's done and whips him mercilessly with his towel, sending Larry and Jeff running.</p><p>When Larry drops Jeff at home, Susie yells that the dog has been shitting all day after being fed the food from the restaurant. She's certain Daviday must have tainted it and demands that Jeff confront him. But Larry reminds them he promised he'd eat the food. Even better, according to Susie. Larry has to tell Daviday he's been sick as a dog since eating the food. When Larry confronts Daviday for tampering with the food, the waiter is skeptical of Larry's claim he ate it and they stare each other down.</p><p>Larry returns home to use the bathroom in the Black's guest room. When he emerges, Cheryl is there and discovers the soft toilet paper (12). The Blacks immediately blame Larry but he is saved by the doorbell. Richard lets himself in and accuses Larry of being a perv for hitting on Cha Cha on the phone. And now she's been fired because Bart heard about Larry's insensitive miscarriage remark and doesn't want anything to do with anyone who knows Larry. Larry insists &quot;Nine's enough (13).&quot; Promising to get Cha Cha's job back, Larry reaches for the phone to call Barbara to apologize. Richard won't accept a lefty call, however, he insists on a righty call. When Barbara answers she screams at Larry.</p><p>Leon rushes Larry to the doctor for his re-injured right ear. In the waiting room, Larry spots a bald man emerging and jumps up to get in his ass. But as he starts yelling, the nurse rushes out, informing Larry that the man is not a skinhead, but a chemo patient. Larry apologizes but moments later, has to race to the man's rescue again when he hears Leon in the hallway, also getting in that ass.</p><p>Keywords:</p><p>(1) Traditionally, a person assigned to watch a school bathroom to make sure no one does anything against school policy. e.g. smokes cigarettes or marijuana.</p><p>(2) Having nine children is like having &quot;Nine of you,&quot; Larry tells Bart.</p><p>(3) According to Daviday, the restaurant doesn't provide doggie bags for dogs, allowing no food prepared for people to be fed to dogs. He suggests Susie buy kibble instead.</p><p>(4) Larry finds Cha Cha's interest in his bathroom habits to be obsessive and intrusive. Richard insists he has the same concern, and it's concern for Larry's health.</p><p>(5) Richard brags that he could pit the VHS of his colon against Larry's any time.</p><p>(6) Larry finds a question about urination frequency irrelevant to his ear problem. He views it as a private thing, not to be discussed with strangers. &quot;We're not on a bus. I'm a doctor,&quot; the doctor points out.</p><p>(7) &quot;You want me to talk lefty?&quot; Larry asks. Yes, that is what the doctor means.</p><p>(8) The phrase Larry later uses to describe to Leon his reaction to the skinhead. e.g. &quot;I slunk out.&quot; Leon points out he &quot;punked out.&quot;</p><p>(9) Cheryl is an environmentalist and stocks the house with post-consumer toilet paper. Larry and the Blacks agree it is rough and unpleasant.</p><p>(10) According to Leon, Larry must: Pull the asshole open. Step into their asshole. Close the door behind you. Take a spray paint can &quot;Larry was here.&quot; Eat snickers, leave wrappers and garbage, f**k his whole asshole up. Open it up and step out again.&quot;</p><p>(11) See #7.</p><p>(12) Cheryl explains that soft toilet paper takes millions of virgin trees to make, which leads to global warming, which leads to hurricanes like the one that displaced the Blacks.</p><p>(13) To back up his argument, Larry tells Richard how things are in China, where you are only allowed two kids. If you have three, they execute. &quot;Kill the baby?&quot; Richard asks. &quot;Not the baby, idiot. They kill the parents.&quot; When Richard doubts this Larry backs down: &quot;Maybe they don't execute but they give you a good dressing down.&quot;</p></div>\n\nThe Freak Book\n\nA book about freaks, coupled with a chauffeur's incapacity, sets Larry up for a string of ejections.\n\nThe Rat Dog\n\nLarry tests the limits of sick sex, and Loretta and Leon's job prospects are burned by a slow toaster.\n\nThe TiVo Guy\n\nA malfunctioning TV device puts Larry's marriage with Cheryl into a crisis mode.\n\nThe N Word\n\nLarry tries to do Auntie Rae a favor, but ends up offending her.

Having recently returned to acting, she encourages Larry to do the reunion suggesting he write a part for her. Realizing this is his way to win Cheryl back, Larry goes about convincing Jerry, Jason, Julia and Michael to do a reunion show. But along the way, Larry alienates NBC prexy Sandy Goodman when he's insulted by the nosebleed seats Goodman gives him to the Lakers game. Ultimately, Larry smoothes things over by saving Goodman's life with a Lyme disease diagnosis. But Larry's not out of hot water yet - he's promised the role of George's ex-wife to Cheryl, but Jerry's offered it to Meg Ryan.</p></div>\n\nThe Hot Towel\n\nLarry rats out Christian Slater at Ted and Mary's anniversary party, but later gets his payback at a restaurant rendezvous.\n\nDenise Handicap\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by</b> David Mandel</p><p><b>Written by</b> Larry David</p><p>Larry learns the ups and downs of dating the disabled when he picks up Denise, prior to realizing she is wheelchair-bound. While sex and stairs pose a challenge, handicapped parking, special treatment at restaurants and being reconsidered by friends and acquaintances in a more positive light strike Larry as a plus. Meanwhile, a run-in with Rosie O'Donnell over a lunch tab and an unfortunate chain of events with his Blackberry converge to bring an end to Larry's handicapped dating.</p></div>\n\nThe Bare Midriff\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by</b> Larry Charles</p><p><b>Written by</b> Larry David</p><p>Larry loses out to Jerry and has to talk to their assistant Maureen about her belly-baring attire. Insulted, she quits but Julia (who got her the job) demands Larry make things right, so as not to upset Maureen's mentally unstable mother. Meanwhile, Larry's new pill has increased his flow so much it is causing him to splatter, which leads to a misunderstanding about a miraculously weeping Jesus in Maureen and her mother's bathroom. The mother is stunned at how much Larry reminds her of her husband (who was murdered on their honeymoon in a road rage incident) and has a traumatic flashback when she's driving with Larry that causes her to injure Richard Lewis. Everything culminates with Larry's dangerous rescue of the mother from a suicidal roof jump in which Larry's life is saved by the offending midriff.</p></div>\n\nThe Black Swan\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by</b> Bryan Gordon</p><p><b>Written by </b>Larry David</p><p>Larry makes a few big gestures, including insisting on re-doing his mother's headstone when he sees his father saved money on the per-letter charge, and offering to pay for his cousin's child's college education. Unfortunately, these are outweighed by some bad luck and bad behavior on the golf course that result in Larry being blamed when Norm has a heart attack and dies on the course, and Larry killing Mr. Takahashi's beloved black swan.</p></div>\n\nOfficer Krupke\n\nJeff's indiscretion forces Larry to embrace his feminine side, and one of Jeff's clients competes with Cheryl for a \"Seinfeld\" role.\n\nThe Table Read\n\nLarry gets frustrated by a nine-year-old's emails, Leon poses as a dead man and Jerry befriends Funkhauser.\n\nSeinfeld\n\nIn the Season Seven finale, a returned favor costs Larry quality time with Cheryl.\n\nThe Divorce\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by </b>David Steinberg</p><p><b>Written by</b> Larry David, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer<br></p><p>Larry and Cheryl's reunion is short-lived, as Larry discovers that Cheryl does not respect wood. When he presses her on it, she storms out of the house. A year later, Larry meets with his divorce lawyer, Randy Berg, and is confident about the deal he's getting. At lunch, Larry orders the buffet, and shares some of his plate with Jeff. When restaurant management asks him not to share, another lawyer, Hiram Katz, steps in to successfully argue Larry's case.</p><p>Larry agrees to buy Girl Scout cookies from the daughter of the owner of the Dodgers, who'd asked Larry if he was interested in going to a game in his box. The cookie purchase is interrupted by the arrival of the girl's first menstrual period. Larry does his best to help, reading the instructions off of one of Cheryl's tampon boxes. The Dodgers' owner is furious, and rescinds his offer to Larry. When the Girl Scouts come back to collect, Larry rescinds his order.</p><p>Larry finds out that his lawyer is not Jewish and fires him, saying &quot;You Sweded me!&quot; He hires Hiram Katz as his lawyer, and recommends him to the owner of the Dodgers. A month later, the Dodgers owner loses his team to his ex-wife<a></a>, and Larry loses his house to Cheryl.

He goes to use the bathroom in the coach section, and when he exits, trips over his extra-long shoelaces. He falls right on top of a drunk man, who had been acting abusive toward a stewardess, and tackles him to the floor. The stewardess and the plane's other passengers give Larry a round of applause for his heroism, and as he returns to his seat, the woman, who introduces herself as Donna, shows a much greater interest in him.</p><p>Jeff and Larry go to lunch, where they spot Ricky Gervais, whom Jeff would like to sign as a client. Larry offers to get him a bottle of wine, and Ricky orders the most expensive one in the house. Larry and Jeff's waiter is attentive to their conversation, but not to their food, so Larry gets up and gets the food himself.</p><p>Larry brings Donna and a stick of French bread to dinner at Jeff and Susie's apartment. Susie rebuffs his contribution-&quot;Don't impose your desires on my cuisine&quot;-and separates the couples in her seating arrangement. She then accidentally reveals in front of Donna that it was Larry's long-shoelaces that made him tackle the man on the plane.</p><p>At Ricky's play, Larry and Susie argue the entire time, throwing off Ricky's performance-he gives himself his lowest mark yet, a nine out of ten, though he can't identify the offenders. Backstage, Larry and Ricky exchange tense verbal jabs about paying for the tickets to the show, Ricky's ability to cry onstage, and the artistic merits of Rodgers and Hammerstein's &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;<i> </i>At lunch the next day, the same eavesdropping waiter from earlier reveals to Ricky that it was Larry talking in the audience the night before.</p><p>Larry spots Ricky and Donna entering the subway, and follows them with his baguette in hand. He sees them being robbed and intervenes, bashing the offender with his hard stick of bread. A heroic Larry walks off, but his laces are stuck in the closing subway doors.</p></div>\n\nThe Bi-Sexual\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by </b>David Manel</p><p><b>Written by</b> Larry David, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer</p><p>At an art gallery opening, Larry hits it off with a woman and gets her number. He recounts the encounter to Rosie O'Donnell, who's just met someone herself. They piece together it's the same woman, Jane, and she's bisexual. &quot;What is this?&quot; Larry says. &quot;She has to sleep with everyone?&quot; Neither Rosie nor Larry will back down though, and the competition is on.</p><p>Larry goes back to the apartment and finds Leon waiting for him outside. His first date with Jane gets off to a rocky start, when the Japanese food Larry brought for dinner spills in the bag. The next day, he returns to the restaurant, tells the maitre d' to secure his food better in the future, and asks for an apology. The maitre d' not only apologizes, he bows. Larry is impressed.</p><p>Larry shows up to a softball game with Rosie. Things have been going well for her and Jane-Rosie's taking her to the Tony Awards that week. Larry goes home and bemoans Rosie's lesbian advantage to Leon. Leon refuses to let Larry back down, offering him a pep talk and a little blue pill. Larry's reluctant to start juicing, but desperate to win Jane's affections.</p><p>After her next night with Larry, Jane is so content she cancels her trip to the Tony's with Rosie. At softball, Rosie is perplexed. She's known Larry for four decades and Jane is the first woman to rave about him in bed. Something isn't adding up. Larry credits his improved performance to diet and exercise, but she's not buying it. He hits a home run and Rosie looks on incredulous as he circles the bases.</p><p>In Central Park, Larry sees a Japanese tourist give a full bow after a minor incident. He asks if the 90-degree bow is standard, and the man tells him anything less would be seen as dismissive. He calls the maitre d's effort-head and neck only-- &quot;a shit bow.&quot; Larry returns to the restaurant to let the maitre d' know.</p><p>Before his next date with Jane, a trip to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, Larry needs more pills. Leon is out of them, so Larry secures two pills from an older-looking man in Washington Square Park. In Cooperstown, Larry bumps into Jane on the steps of the Baseball Hall of Fame, and she jokingly demands a full bow apology. Larry obliges, and a pill falls out of his shirt pocket. Larry makes excuses-he was leveling the playing field, it was for recovery, everyone's doing it-but Jane withholds his ticket. Larry's not getting into the Hall of Fame.</p></div>\n\nCar Periscope\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by</b> David Mandel</p><p><b>Written by </b>Larry David, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer<br></p><p>Waiting for a cab on a New York City corner, Larry gets upstreamed, as a woman walks up the block and takes the cab in front of him.</p><p>Jeff takes Larry to meet Ira, an inventor. Ira shows them his latest invention, a car periscope. They like the idea, though they're hesitant to invest money with a total stranger. But when they meet Ira's homely wife, Gabby, they're convinced he must be a man of character. They agree to test drive a prototype and love the invention.</p><p>Larry, Jeff and Susie go to a party thrown by their friend Henry, and run into Wanda and Larry tells her about the trainer he's been working out with. Feeling he should for once act on his benevolent impulses, Larry visits Henry's father, the former television judge Carter Horn. Larry fills in for a one-armed man playing Scrabble with the old judge and realizes the judge is suffering from dementia and prone to racist outbreaks. Henry comes in and thinks that Larry has run up the score against his father and demands he leave. Larry maintains that a one-armed man did it.</p><p>In the park, Larry once again plays Scrabble with the old man and sees Wanda running with his trainer during what used to be his time. He confronts them, and Larry and Wanda set about resolving the situation. Larry suggests Judge Horn be the arbiter, knowing his racist tendencies.</p><p>Larry leaves his business manager after meeting his too-attractive wife. He moves his business elsewhere, to a man who is much better looking than his wife of 20 years.</p><p>Larry and Jeff agree to invest with Ira. At a movie with Ira and Gabby, Larry accidentally reveals that he considers Ira to be a man of character because of his ugly wife. Gabby goes after him, and Larry winds up with his arm in a sling.</p><p>The next day, Larry sees the one-armed man who'd ditched him with the judge. They upstream each other up the block, looking for a taxi. The one-armed man runs into and knocks over the judge and hops into a cab. Henry sees his father on the floor and asks who did this to him. He says it was a one-armed man - as Henry eyes Larry with his arm in a sling.</p></div>\n\nMister Softee\n\nAn ice-cream truck triggers a painful childhood memory for Larry that has a huge impact.\n\nLarry vs. Michael J.
