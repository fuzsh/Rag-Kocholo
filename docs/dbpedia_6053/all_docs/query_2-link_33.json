        "text": "No festive season would be complete without a traditional viewing of all your\n\nfavorite holiday films, be it a beloved comedy like Elf, an animated special like A Charlie Brown Christmas, or a nostalgic gem like Miracle on 34th Street. But for many people, the one movie that truly makes it feel like Christmas is the beloved silver screen classic, It's a Wonderful Life.\n\nFor the uninitiated, It's a Wonderful Life tells the story of dejected and desperate George Bailey, who's spent his whole life in the small town of Bedford Falls, but longs to explore the world. As he reaches rock bottom, George starts to believe that everyone in his life would be better off if he had never been born. An angel named Clarence arrives to show George how horrible life would be without him, teaching him just how important a role he's had in the lives of his friends and family. The heartwarming lesson is fully realized as George happily returns home to his family with an entirely new appreciation for his life.\n\nThe timeless film was originally released in 1946, and has aired as a holiday special for many years since. And there are plenty of ways to make sure you get a viewing in this year.\n\nNBC has confirmed that it will air It's A Wonderful Life on Saturday, December 24th at 8 p.m. ET, continuing a long and proud Christmas Eve tradition.\n\nIf that timing doesn't suit you, It's A Wonderful Life is also available to stream on many platforms, including , and Google Play. And for true die-hard fans, there are actually two different versions available on Prime: the familiar , and . The choice is yours.\n\nThe anniversary edition of the movie . The movie stars Jimmy Stewart as George, Henry Travers as Clarence, and Donna Reed as George's wife, Mary."
