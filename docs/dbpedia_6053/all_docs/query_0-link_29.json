        "text": "HBO's acclaimed drama ''The Sopranos'' today became the first cable-network series to be nominated for an Emmy Award for best drama, and also earned more Emmy nominations -- 16 -- than any show, broadcast or cable.\n\nThree shows received 13 nominations, two regular series created by David E. Kelley -- ''The Practice'' (ABC) and ''Ally McBeal'' (Fox) -- and the CBS mini-series ''Joan of Arc.''\n\nHBO placed second to NBC in total nominations, with 74 to NBC's 82, while ABC had 58, CBS 46 and Fox 33.\n\nAlthough ''The Sopranos'' was widely praised by critics and, for an HBO show, widely watched, nonetheless HBO reaches only about 25 million homes (broadcasters reach 99.4 million), and the show made its debut only in January. For both reasons, many in the television industry were surprised that the tradition-minded Television Academy of Arts and Sciences, which awards the Emmys, gave it so many nominations.\n\nJames Gandolfini, who plays Tony Soprano, the head of a turbulent household and an organized-crime family in northern New Jersey, earned a nomination, his first, as best actor in a drama, and all three female leads earned nominations. Edie Falco, who plays Tony's wife, Carmela, and Lorraine Bracco, who plays his psychiatrist, were nominated for best actress in a drama, and Nancy Marchand was nominated for best supporting actress for her portrayal of Tony's scheming mother, Livia.\n\nFour of the five nominees for best writing for a drama were ''Sopranos'' episodes, including the pilot, written by the series' creator, David Chase.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
