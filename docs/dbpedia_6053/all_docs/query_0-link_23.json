In this role, Stillerman will oversee all aspects of content creation across all platforms. Most recently, Stillerman was founder and chairman of Yolo Films, where he produced content for HBO Films, MTV and VH1. In his new post, he will report to Charlie Collier, Executive Vice President and General Manager of AMC.\n\n\"Joel is a dynamic and seasoned content executive,\" said Collier. \"His leadership and expertise in both film and television will play an instrumental role in furthering AMC's industry-leading programming momentum. Joel will be a key contributor to the network's overall content strategy and I am confident in his ability to take AMC's development, creation, and management of content to the next level. His creativity, energy and broad management skills will be a tremendous addition to our business.\"\n\n\"I am thrilled to be joining AMC at such an exciting time,\" said Stillerman. \"I get to go from being a serious fan of the network to being a part of the team, which is a rare opportunity in this business. AMC has done a remarkable job creating some of the best original series and movies out there, and I look forward to helping continue to build this incredible brand.\"\n\nStillerman has over 20 years of broad experience developing, producing, and writing for film and television, with major credits including the features Blow and Rounders, television franchises MTV Unplugged, MTV's Video Music Awards, HBO's A Lesson Before Dying and Sometimes in April, and a number of heralded sports, music and comedy programs. In 2003, he founded Yolo Films, an independent film and television production company that produces content for HBO, MTV and VH1, among other networks. Prior to starting his own company, Stillerman was the top content executive at Walden Media where he served as executive vice president of development and production. During his time at Walden, he spearheaded the company's mission to build a brand around young adult literature, supervising the acquisition and development of the The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and Holes, and helped establish Walden as a credible brand in the family entertainment space. In 1995, Stillerman co-founded Spanky Pictures with Ted Demme and, as co-chairs, he and Demme oversaw all aspects of the company's operations, specifically finding, developing and producing film and television projects. Earlier in his career, he served as vice president of production and executive producer at MTV Networks, where he oversaw the majority of original production for the channel.\n\nStillerman is the recipient of a Primetime Emmy Award for Best Made-for-TV Movie (Lesson Before Dying,, 1999); a Peabody Award; a Humanitas Prize; and a number of Cable Ace Awards. His film, Sometimes in April, was named a \"Top 10 TV Program of 2005\" by the American Film Institute. Stillerman holds a bachelor of arts in mass communication and television from Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe past year has brought AMC critical acclaim, record ratings, and broad recognition from the industry, firmly establishing it as a top destination for high-quality, distinctive television. AMC's original programming successes include the Emmy Award-winning Broken Trail; Golden Globe and Peabody Award-winning Mad Men (Season Two debuts in summer '08); and this year's Breaking Bad, which the Associated Press said \"…dares to be bleak, heartbreaking, shocking and bitterly funny…\".
