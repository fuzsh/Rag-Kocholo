It's the story of a 12-year-old girl who bounces around the foster care system all her life until she meets a former art teacher who understands her and gives her unconditional love.\n\nAbandoned as a baby, Hollis Woods (Jodelle Ferland, \"The Secret of Hidden Lake\") has been in more foster homes than she can count. Edna (Woodard), her more than patient social worker, is at her wits end when she places Hollis in the home of Josie (Spacek), a retired teacher whose house and yard are filled with her own artistic creations. Josie immediately takes to Hollis, understands the troubled youngster, and is delighted to discover that Hollis is an artist herself.\n\nHollis responds to Josie's warmth and openness, and begins to feel like she's found a place to call home. But, Hollis becomes alarmed when she realizes that Josie is growing increasingly forgetful and confused by routine tasks. Hollis is afraid that when Edna becomes aware of the problem, Hollis will be forced to move again.\n\nIn an attempt to stay together, Hollis plans a bold escape and takes Josie to the vacant summer home of the Regan family, the foster family with whom Hollis spent the previous summer. The Regans wanted to adopt Hollis ... and the skeptical young girl had gradually come to believe that might be possible. But, when the Regans' teenaged son (Ridge Canipe) was seriously injured in an accident, things fell apart for Hollis again. Returning to the Regan home is bittersweet for her.\n\nOn the run, their plight becomes more desperate as Josie's forgetfulness grows worse and 12-year-old Hollis must now take care of Josie ... instead of the other way around.\n\nTupper plays John Regan, Stephen's father, who really wants Hollis to join their family.\n\nSissy Spacek won both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the feature film \"Coal Miner's Daughter.\" She was nominated for Academy Awards for \"Missing,\" \"The River,\" \"Crimes of the Heart\" and, most recently \"In the Bedroom,\" for which she won a Golden Globe Award. Her other feature film credits include \"Badlands,\" \"Carrie,\" \"'Night Mother,\" \"The Grass Harp\" and \"A Home at the End of the World.\" Her television credits include the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation \"A Place for Annie\" and the mini-series \"Larry McMurtry's Streets of Laredo.\"\n\nAlfre Woodard was nominated for an Academy Award for the feature film \"Cross Creek.\" Her other feature film credits include \"Passion Fish,\" \"Bopha!,\" \"Rich in Love,\" \"Heart and Souls,\" \"Grand Canyon\" and \"Health.\" She was nominated for an Emmy Award for the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation \"The Piano Lesson.\" Her other television credits include the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation \"The Water Is Wide\" and the series \"Desperate Housewives.\"\n\nJames Tupper currently stars as Jack Slattery in the television series \"Men in Trees.\" His other television appearances include the series \"How I Met Your Mother\" and \"CSI: NY,\" on the Network, and the Hallmark Channel television movies \"Love's Long Journey\" and \"Love's Abiding Joy.\"\n\nJodelle Ferland was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for the television movie \"Mermaid,\" at 4 years old, making her the youngest nominee in history. Her other television credits include the series \"Smallville,\" \"Dark Angel\" and \"The Collector.\" Her feature film credits include \"Tideland,\" \"They,\" \"The Messengers\" and \"Good Luck Chuck.\"\n\nPICTURES OF HOLLIS WOODS was produced by Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions. Brent Shields (\"The Valley of Light\") is the executive producer; Dan Paulson (\"Full Court Miracle\") is the producer. Tony Bill (\"Flyboys\") directed from a script by Emmy Award winner Ann Peacock (\"A Lesson Before Dying\") from the book by Patricia Reilly Giff.\n\nRATING: To Be Announced"
