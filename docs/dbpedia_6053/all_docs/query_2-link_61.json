        "text": "The end of 2023 and the dawn of 2024 will bring holidays, cold weather, and quite a few new reality TV show seasons, from The Traitors to The Bachelor.\n\nThe new year will also give us gifts such as 90-minute episodes of Survivor and The Amazing Race, plus new competitions (such as Deal or No Deal Island) and plenty of drama (Vanderpump Rules).\n\nThis guide includes premiere dates for all reality show and documentary series premieres on broadcast, streaming, and cable TV in the United States this spring and beyond. Times listed are in ET/PT.\n\nFor any reality shows that premiered before Dec. 1, 2023, and are continuing to air this winterâsuch as Squid Game: The Challenge, High on the Hog, The Great Christmas Light Fight, or Life Below Zeroârefer to the fall 2023 reality TV schedule.\n\nI also maintain a separate guide for feature documentaries and one-off reality TV specials: the winter 2024 documentary premiere guide.\n\nProgram descriptions in quotation marks indicate that the text has come from network press releases, the show’s website, or other official materials. Other summaries are from me, and may include snark.\n\nI frequently update this list throughout the quarter, and work hard to ensure this a comprehensive list of reality TV and documentary series premieres. That’s increasingly challenging now as schedules change frequently and some networks have stopped publicly announcing returning seasons.\n\nSo if you have any updates, additions, or corrections, please send them to me.
