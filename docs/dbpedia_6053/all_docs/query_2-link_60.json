        "text": "The highly anticipated adaptation of Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus is here. The Apple TV+ drama, starring Brie Larson as Elizabeth Zott and Lewis Pullman as Calvin Evans, debuted earlier this month with two episodes.\n\nThe fact her novel is now a major television show, Garmus said, is “surreal.” She explained, “It’s less surreal in one important way, which is that because it’s not the novel, it’s an adaptation, I can look at it as a completely new thing. And that is so much better than saying 'no, no, it has to be exactly like the book.'”\n\nGarmus adds, “Brie Larson really immersed herself in this role. And I really appreciate all the work that she put into that because when she walks out on that stage, when she’s just Elizabeth Zott at work, that’s who I saw. And it was really amazing for me to see that on the screen. It was like, 'Wow, there she is.' It’s a different animal. And so I would say to any viewer, this is their rendition. It’s different from my vision, but it doesn’t mean that it’s not as good at all.”\n\nPullman, Larson, and their canine co-star Gus, a goldendoodle dog who plays Six-Thirty.\n\nShowrunner Lee Eisnenberg told Town & Country that the opportunity to adapt Garmus's bestselling novel, and to tell a story that was “so heartwarming and heartwrenching” was “the opportunity of a lifetime.” Apple TV+ typically releases new episodes at midnight eastern time. Here's the schedule for Lessons in Chemistry for the rest of the season:"
