        "text": "64 Things / 64 Things : Eleanor Haley\n\nLast week Litsa wrote this post about how grief is often (not always) unrealistically portrayed in the movies. This post sparked a conversation in our Facebook community about what movies (if any) resonate with our readers and their grief experience. We got a ton of response and the movies were so different and diverse, which of course is no surprise because grief is so unique from person to person.\n\nSo, get out your Blockbuster cards log onto Netflix because, together with our readers, we've compiled a list of 64 movies about grief and loss. Technically, not all these movies are about grief and loss, but they all depict elements of the emotional struggles around death, dying, grief, and bereavement. I have lovingly linked each one of these to their profile on the Internet Movie Database because I am a glutton for punishment.\n\nI would suggest you get all your friends together for a movie marathon, but next thing I know you'll be blaming me because no one wants to come to your depressing parties.\n\nSteel Magnolias\n\nBeaches\n\nTender Mercies\n\nBonneville\n\nTerms of Endearment\n\nTruly Madly Deeply\n\nPS I love you\n\nThe Notebook\n\nOne True Thing\n\nThe Bucket List\n\nRabbit Hole\n\nGhost\n\nThe Other Woman\n\nMy Life\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nWhat Dreams May Come\n\nPonette\n\nDelores Claiborne\n\nWuthering Heights\n\nOrdinary People\n\nOut of Africa\n\nExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close\n\nStep Mom\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nMystic River\n\nThe Descendants\n\nTwo Weeks\n\nMiss Potter\n\nThe Lovely Bones\n\nThe Doctor\n\nAlex, the Life of a Child\n\nLove Story\n\nPatch Adams\n\nUp\n\nBurning Man\n\nThe Sweet Hereafter\n\nLast Tango in Paris\n\nSeven Pounds\n\nDear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father\n\nMy Sister's Keeper\n\nSophie's Choice\n\nCatch and Release\n\nMoonlight Mile\n\nWhite Oleander\n\nMonster's Ball\n\nThings We Lost In the Fire\n\nReign Over Me\n\nIn the Bedroom\n\nTo Gillian on Her 37th Birthday\n\nThe Big Chill\n\nAbout Schmidt\n\nNights in Rodanthe\n\nTaking Chance\n\nIn the Gloaming\n\nWit\n\nMessage in a Bottle\n\nLorenzo's Oil\n\nWe Bought a Zoo\n\nBeautiful Boy\n\nThe Laramie Project\n\nMarley and Me\n\nThe Broken Circle Breakdown\n\nAugust: Osage County\n\nThe Family Stone\n\nWe could have gone on for several more, but 64 is our magic number. Let us know which movies we missed in the comments below or on Facebook.\n\nHey do you like subscribing to things? Me either, but if I were you I'd still subscribe to 'What's Your Grief'.\n\nJanuary 24, 2014"
