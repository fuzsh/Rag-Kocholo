        "text": "The Crown's Jared Harris plays impassioned scientist Valery Legasov. He became a key member of the government commission created to investigate the causes of Chernobyl and to plan the mitigation of its consequences.\n\nHe saved countless lives by ordering the immediate evacuation of the entire population of the city of Pripyat nearby.\n\nWe learn of his bleak fate in Chernobyl's devastating opening episode, and on April 27, 1988, one day after the second anniversary of the accident - and one day before he was due to announce his results of the investigation into the causes of the disaster - Legasov took his own life.\n\nAdam Nagaitis plays firefighter Vasil Ihnacienka, who was just 25 when he died of radiation poisoning after being one of the first to respond to the fire at the Chernobyl plant on April 26.\n\nWithin a few hours, he and his fellow group of courageous firefighters managed to extinguish most of the on-site fires except for the nuclear graphite fire in the reactor.\n\nTaboo's Jessie Buckley plays Lyudmila Ignatenko, who was expecting her first child with husband Vasil at the time of the nuclear power plant disaster. Her story is as harrowing as the series depicts.\n\nLyudmila, who was then just 23, watched as her husband died an agonising death from radiation poisoning following his hospitalisation in Moscow.\n\nUnaware that she and her unborn baby could be contaminated by the levels of radiation Vasil had been exposed to, Lyudmila had physical contact with her husband while he lay on his death bed.\n\nTheir baby died hours after being born, being diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and congenital heart disease.\n\nLyudmila spoke about her experience with author Svetlana Alexievich for her Nobel prize-winning 2015 book Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster.\n\n\"The burns started to come to the surface. In his mouth, on his tongue, his cheeks - at first there were little lesions, and then they grew. It came off in layers - as white film ... the colour of his face ... his body ... blue, red , grey-brown,\" she said in a extract from the book published by The Guardian.\n\n\"The only thing that saved me was it happened so fast; there wasn't any time to think, there wasn't any time to cry. It was a hospital for people with serious radiation poisoning. Fourteen days. In 14 days a person dies.\"\n\nSam Troughton plays Aleksandr Akimov. Aleksandr was the shift supervisor of the night crew at the Chernobyl power plant, and was supervising the night of the disaster.\n\nHe refused to believe that the reactor in the plant had exploded, and relayed inaccurate information to higher powers. When he finally acknowledged the full extent of the accident, he worked with his crew until early morning, trying to pump water into the exposed reactor.\n\nAleksandr died two weeks later due to acute radiation syndrome, at the age of 33 (via The New York Times).\n\nPaul Ritter plays deputy chief-engineer of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Anatoly Dyatlov.\n\nDyatlov was supervisor of the safety test which resulted in the disaster. Despite absorbing a near-deadly dose of radiation - which causes death in 50% of affected persons after 30 days - he survived.\n\nAnatoly attributed the disaster to plant's poor design, rather than human error, although it was later reported that he bullied some of the power plant workers with job terminations if they did not carry out the test that night.\n\nEpisode 4 of Chernobyl gave a grim glimpse into the men known as 'liquidators' whose job it was to kill the dogs and cats left behind in the exclusion site surrounding the power plant to prevent the spread of radiation contamination.\n\n\"I know that was hard. Just so there's no confusion— the story of the liquidators is real. It happened. And we actually toned it down from the full story,\" writer and executive producer Craig Mazin tweeted. \"War leaves all kinds of scars. These were the things men were ordered to do.\"\n\nOn a more positive note, SPCA International - an organisation which advances the safety and well-being of animals globally - partnered with Clean Futures Fund to care for the modern day line of dogs and cats which survived Chernobyl. They have been able to provide food, medical care, vaccines, and sterilizations to over 800 of the dogs and cats living in Chernobyl.\n\nCon O'Neill plays Viktor Bryukhanov. Viktor was Chernobyl's former director, and in charge of the reactor which exploded on the night of the disaster 33 years ago. Along with Anatoly Dyatlov, he was sentenced to ten years in prison for negligence. He served half of his sentence before being granted amnesty.\n\nMost scientists now accept that the accident was caused by a fatal combination of flaws in the reactor's design and a failure by the staff on duty to follow safety procedures (via The New Zealand Herald).\n\nViktor currently lives in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.\n\nRalph Ineson plays General Nikolai Tarakanov. General Tarakanov was chief supervisor of the removal of highly-radioactive elements from the site of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the accident in '86.\n\nHe organised and led the helicopter group tasked with the perilous job of dropping sand onto the crater of the reactor inside the plant - without getting too near to the radioactive fire.\n\nAdrian Rawlins plays Chief engineer Nikolai Fomin.\n\nFollowing the disaster, Nikolai tried to take his own life, which delayed his trial for negligence (via American Scientist).\n\nHe was found guilty of gross violation of safety regulations, creating conditions that led to an explosion, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nAfter his attempted suicides - he also tried to slit his wrists with the shards of his broken glasses - and nervous breakdown, Nikolai was released from prison early."
