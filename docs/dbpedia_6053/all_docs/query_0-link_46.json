        "text": "01 of 20\n\nA Very English Scandal (2018)\n\nThis three-episode miniseries follows the publicized trial of British Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe (Hugh Grant) who is charged with conspiracy to commit murder against his ex-lover (Ben Whishaw). A Very English Scandal is, as the name suggests, very English, teetering between comedy and drama, according to Whishaw. What makes the series special beyond recounting Britain's \"trial of the century\" is its ability to go deeper with the source material with hefty themes for modern audiences. A Very English Scandal then, according to EW's Maureen Lee Lenker, is \"a moving examination of sexuality, identity, and repression, set against the struggle to decriminalize homosexuality in Great Britain.\"\n\nWhere to watch A Very English Scandal: Amazon Prime Video\n\nCast: Hugh Grant, Ben Whishaw, Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge, Monica Dolan\n\nRelated content: Ben Whishaw explains what's so very English about A Very English Scandal\n\n02 of 20\n\nAlias Grace (2017)\n\nFrom the mind of author Margaret Atwood, Alias Grace dramatizes the grisly homicide of Thomas Kinnear and his lover, Nancy Montgomery, in 1843 Toronto. Sarah Polley (the Oscar-winning writer of Women Talking) wrote the six-part series for Netflix that's in the same vein as Atwood's most famous work, The Handmaid's Tale. Our story follows Grace, one of the two murderers serving her time in prison, played by the \"magnetically interesting\" Sarah Gadon, who draws us in \"without losing sight of her unreliability,\" says EW's critic. While The Handmaid's Tale relies on a dystopian future to reflect current anxieties and social injustices, Alias Grace uses the past to enhance an \"unflinching look at the horrors of being a woman.\"\n\nWhere to watch Alias Grace: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A- (read the review)\n\nCast: Sarah Gadon, Edward Holcroft, Rebecca Liddiard, Zachary Levi, David Cronenberg, Anna Paquin, Paul Gross\n\nRelated content: Zachary Levi mastered an old-timey accent for Alias Grace\n\n03 of 20\n\nAmerican Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson (2016)\n\nWinning nine Emmys and shocking audiences in spite of its well-known source material, the first season of American Crime Story focuses on the biggest pre-internet event of the 1990s: the trial of O.J. Simpson. Over the course of 10 episodes, The People v. O.J. Simpson is a captivating retelling of the scandal that took the world by storm, providing intricate details and regurgitating conversations surrounding the case. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a career-best turn as Simpson in this \"meticulously crafted, powerfully resonant docudrama\" that, as EW's critic writes, \"crackles with timely issues — race, sexism, privilege, celebrity, broken justice, media manipulation, and more.\"\n\nWhere to watch American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson: Hulu\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Cuba Gooding Jr., Sarah Paulson, Sterling K. Brown, Courtney B. Vance, David Schwimmer, Nathan Lane, Bruce Greenwood, John Travolta\n\nRelated content: American Crime Story: How accurate is it compared to the real O.J. Simpson trial?\n\n04 of 20\n\nBand of Brothers (2001)\n\nBased on the book of the same name by Stephen E. Ambrose, Band of Brothers is a 10-episode miniseries about the \"Easy Company,\" a.k.a. the 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division of the United States during World War II. Coming off the success of Saving Private Ryan (1998), Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks served as creators and executive producers of this finely crafted, historically-moving tribute to the men who fought in the war. Band of Brothers mixes intense realism in its documentary-style cinematography with empathetic characters (some of which get their own personal episode), but it's the interviews with real-life members of Easy Company that remind viewers of the true sacrifice. As EW's writer put it, \"If it doesn't put a lump in your throat, you need to have your throat checked.\"\n\nWhere to watch Band of Brothers: Max\n\nCast: Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Neal McDonough, David Schwimmer, Donnie Wahlberg, Colin Hanks, Michael Fassbender, Jimmy Fallon, Andrew Scott, Tom Hardy, James McAvoy, Simon Pegg\n\nRelated content: Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks talk war games\n\n05 of 20\n\nBoardwalk Empire (2010–2014)\n\nBased on Nelson Johnson's 2002 non-fiction book about crime lord Enoch L. Johnson, Boardwalk Empire was an HBO powerhouse of programming in the early 2010s from Terence Winter, a writer and executive producer of The Sopranos. Drawing on Johnson's nearly 30 years of prominence as the crime boss controlling Atlantic City, Winter created the fictional character Nucky Thompson — played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi — to dramatize the events of the prohibition era in New Jersey. The pilot was directed by Martin Scorsese, setting the tone and visual style for a series that would run for five critically-acclaimed seasons and draw millions of viewers.\n\nWhere to watch Boardwalk Empire: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nCast: Steve Buscemi, Michael Shannon, Kelly Macdonald, Shea Whigham, Stephen Graham, Michael Kenneth Williams, Vincent Piazza\n\nRelated content: Boardwalk Empire post-mortem: Jeffrey Wright on season 5 finale\n\n06 of 20\n\nChernobyl (2019)\n\nCreated by Craig Mazin (showrunner of The Last of Us), this Max miniseries is \"a vivid and detailed retelling\" of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in the Soviet Union. The series delicately packs the crisis into five episodes, with the pilot being a tense recreation of the calamity itself, while the following four installments cover the fallout and investigation into the government's failure to respond. Each moment is expertly (and uncomfortably) crafted to reflect the crumbling world. As EW's critic writes, \"the dense realism of Chernobyl gives the show a freakish close-up terror.\" And a limited series feels like just the right amount of space to flesh out the incident succinctly, honing in on small moments to give the story the power it deserves — while garnering 10 Emmy wins along the way.\n\nWhere to watch Chernobyl: Max\n\nEW grade: A- (read the review)\n\nCast: Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgård, Emily Watson, Barry Keoghan, Jessie Buckley, Adam Nagaitis\n\nRelated content: Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin reflects on the powerful finale and 'the cost of lies'\n\n07 of 20\n\nThe Crown (2016–present)\n\nOne of the most talked about shows in recent years is The Crown, a multi-generational drama that spans the 20th century leading up to and following Queen Elizabeth II's reign. Starting in 1947 at the wedding of the soon-to-be Queen (Claire Foy) to Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (Matt Smith), the Netflix series takes viewers into the world of royalty while sparing no visuals or details. Though the showrunners have received backlash for some creative liberties — some even stretching so far as to call it false history — The Crown still manages to tell a pompous story of royalty, intricately bringing viewers back to a time and place that still continues to awe audiences with each new season.\n\nWhere to watch The Crown: Netflix\n\nCast: Claire Foy, Matt Smith, Olivia Colman, Imedla Staunton, Tobias Menzies, Jonathan Pryce, Vanessa Kirby, Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Dalton, Emma Corrin, Elizabeth Debicki, Gillian Anderson\n\nRelated content: Battle royal: The Crown's Dominic West and Elizabeth Debicki on portraying Charles and Diana's bitter divorce\n\n08 of 20\n\nDopesick (2021)\n\nWith a narrative web spun across the country, Dopesick tells the story of America's opioid crisis from many angles. Channeling real-life figures and composite characters, the miniseries' ensemble format \"deftly corrals the vast addiction epidemic through intimate, deeply engrossing stories of human devastation,\" EW's Kristen Baldwin writes. From Richard Sackler and Purdue Pharma first pushing OxyContin in the late '90s to the doctors prescribing it and the feds seeking justice years later, Dopesick's impact is \"even more terrifying, because the monster at the heart of this story is real.\"\n\nWhere to watch Dopestick: Hulu\n\nEW grade: A- (read the review)\n\nCast: Michael Stuhlbarg, Will Poulter, Michael Keaton, Kaitlyn Dever, Rosario Dawson, Peter Sarsgaard, John Hoogenakker\n\nRelated content: Kaitlyn Dever says Dopesick was 'the hardest thing I've shot'\n\n09 of 20\n\nFive Days at Memorial (2022)\n\nFive Days at Memorial presents hard-to-watch history in a way that helps us understand the mistakes of the not-so-distant past. Based on the meticulously crafted book of the same name by Sheri Fink, Five Days at Memorial traces the fallout and fraut decision to euthanize patients at Memorial Hospital in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, presenting \"an agonizing, brutally vivid retelling of a natural disaster that begat a national disgrace,\" says EW's critic. As it recreates the onset of Katrina through archival footage and set pieces that remind us of the devastation, the eight-episode series is just as much of a historical document as it is a warning for a future ravaged by climate change.\n\nWhere to watch Five Days at Memorial: Apple TV+\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Vera Farmiga, Cherry Jones,\n\nCornelius Smith Jr., Robert Pine, Adepero Oduye, Julie Ann Emery\n\n10 of 20\n\nGeneration Kill (2008)\n\nAmerican journalist Evan Wright was a reporter embedded with the U.S. Marines during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The following year, he published the book Generation Kill about his experiences with the 1st Reconnaissance Marines, and later adapted it into a show that captivated audiences in 2008. The collaboration between Wright and writers David Simon and Ed Burns resulted in a beautifully-worked depiction of war that goes beyond cliches and into a finely detailed historical document. As EW's critic notes, \"You can tell that the writers responded to Wright's clear-eyed reporting with all the precise details that accumulate to create a nuanced look at young men thrown into circumstances way beyond their control.\"\n\nWhere to watch Generation Kill: Max\n\nEW grade: A- (read the review)\n\nCast: Alexander Skarsgård, James Ransone, Lee Tergesen\n\nRelated content: Alexander Skarsgård on Tarzan, True Blood, and the roles that shaped him\n\n11 of 20\n\nI Am the Night (2019)\n\nA disgraced journalist (Chris Pine) and a young girl looking for her father (India Eisley) team up in this six-episode series about L.A.'s most infamous cold case: the Black Dahlia murder. Based on the memoir by Fauna Hodel, I Am the Night is a worthwhile entry into the true crime zeitgeist, anchored by the performances of Pine and Eisley as Fauna. The directors, which includes Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman), handle the visual style of the show with a keen eye for the mid-century period, steeping the era in what EW's critic calls \"magic-hour noir, shot on painterly film under sunlight as golden-glorious as Chris Pine's hair.\" Impressive visuals and carefully-crafted characters help propel this part biopic, part murder mystery into new forays.\n\nWhere to watch I Am the Night: Hulu\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Chris Pine, India Eisley, Jefferson Mays, Connie Nielsen\n\nRelated content: A brief history of every Black Dahlia adaptation (and some conspiracy theories)\n\n12 of 20\n\nJohn Adams (2008)\n\nPaul Giamatti stars as the titular president in this series about the first 50 years of the United States. Directed by Tom Hooper (Les Misérables), John Adams is a well-produced dramatization of American history that comes alive thanks to its incredible cast of characters. Joining Giamatti is Laura Linney as the \"iron-willed\" Abigail Adams, Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson, David Morse as George Washington, Tom Wilkinson as Benjamin Franklin, Rufus Sewell as Alexander Hamilton, Justin Theroux as John Hancock, Danny Huston as Samuel Adams, Sarah Polley as Abigail Adams Smith, and Tom Hollander as King George III. It's a wonderfully-acted miniseries that dramatizes the past succinctly and creatively in the same vein as works like Lincoln and Selma. To quote EW's critic, \"Who says TV doesn't make history thought-provokingly exciting?\"\n\nWhere to watch John Adams: Max\n\nEW grade: A- (read the review)\n\nCast: Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, Stephen Dillane, David Morse, Tom Wilkinson, Rufus Sewell, Justin Theroux, Sarah Polley, Tom Hollander\n\nRelated content: How John Adams set the stage for Hamilton\n\n13 of 20\n\nMaid (2021)\n\nBased on the memoir by Stephanie Land, Maid is an earnest limited series about Alex (Margaret Qualley), a young mother who escapes an abusive relationship and survives by cleaning houses. Alex has to deal with her violent ex Sean (Nick Robinson), her bipolar mother (Qualley's real mom, Andie MacDowell), and government red tape that thwarts her attempts at financial assistance in this adaptation that reflects the book's harsh realities. Qualley is the shining star of Maid, with EW's writer declaring that her performance \"hits each beat with an authenticity that will leave you thinking about the protagonist's plight long after the credits roll.\"\n\nWhere to watch Maid: Netflix\n\nCast: Margaret Qualley, Nick Robinson, Anika Noni Rose, Tracy Vilar, Billy Burke\n\nRelated content: Andie MacDowell to star alongside daughter Margaret Qualley in Netflix's Maid\n\n14 of 20\n\nManhunt (2019)\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton (Martin Clunes) leads an investigation and subsequent race to track down a serial killer in Manhunt, based on the 2004 murder of French student Amélie Delagrange. When The acclaimed series broke viewership records when it premiered on ITV in Britain in 2019, garnering an international audience. Its brilliance comes from the way the showrunners expertly adapt Sutton's memoirs to retell the story without delving into clichés, instead relying on a tightly woven script, excellent acting, and fine details to give proper space to this true crime program.\n\nWhere to watch Manhunt: Acorn TV\n\nCast: Martin Clunes, Claudie Blakley, Stephen Wight, Katie Lyons, Steffan Rhodri\n\n15 of 20\n\nMindhunter (2017–2019)\n\nSet in the '70s and '80s, Mindhunter follows two FBI agents (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) who are tasked with interviewing serial killers to solve open cases, pioneering the bureau's practice of criminal profiling and the Behavioral Science Unit. In a media landscape where true crime shows are often exploitative, Mindhunter stands out for its cerebral and focused atmosphere, curious nature, and historical significance. The series is at its best during the interviews, with Cameron Britton's being the standout (he earned an Emmy nomination for portraying notorious killer Ed Kemper). Fans were recently disappointed when showrunner David Fincher confirmed that there would be no season 3 — but the first two installments are still absolutely worth your time.\n\nWhere to watch Mindhunter: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nCast: Jonathan Groff, Holt McCallany, Anna Torv, Hannah Gross, Cotter Smith, Cameron Britton\n\nRelated content: The true connection between Mindhunter and The Exorcist\n\n16 of 20\n\nNarcos (2015–2017)\n\nThe hit Netflix series Narcos dramatizes the story of Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug kingpin who made billions from the 1970s to the 1990s. Played brilliantly by Wagner Moura, Escobar is beautifully complex, and \"striking for his profound decency,\" says EW's critic. Rounding out the main cast are two DEA agents, played by Pedro Pascal and Boyd Holbrook. Pascal stands out as Javier Peña, \"deeply and effortlessly\" connecting with his character and becoming the glue that held all three seasons of the original series together. Narcos spawned a spin-off, Narcos: Mexico, that continued the terrifying bloodshed and action for audiences. But it's the story of Escobar, bolstered by Moura's charismatic performance, that remains the most remarkable retelling of this corner of history.\n\nWhere to watch Narcos: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Wagner Moura, Pedro Pascal, Boyd Holbrook, Joanna Christie, Maurice Compte\n\nRelated content: The return of Pablo: Original Narcos star Wagner Moura on helping bring Mexico to a close\n\n17 of 20\n\nUnbelievable (2019)\n\nTold over the course of several years, Unbelievable is the story of Marie Adler (Kaitlyn Dever), whose life is turned upside down when she is charged with lying about rape. Years later, two detectives — the foul-mouthed, cynical Grace Rasmussen (Toni Collette) and soft-spoken Karen Duvall (Merritt Wever) — work to reveal the truth of her assault. Each actress is given the space to shine in this \"deeply and unapologetically female\" story that avoids cliches and delicately weaves a narrative with urgency. The show was nominated for four Emmy awards, including Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for Collette. As EW's Kristen Baldwin writes, \"watching Unbelievable is an extremely satisfying experience — not just for its storytelling, but for its depiction of women who confront their reality rather than succumbing to it.\"\n\nWhere to watch Unbelievable: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Kaitlyn Dever, Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, Eric Lange, Bill Fagerbakke\n\nRelated content: Real-life inspiration for Netflix's Unbelievable praises series: 'That was closure for me'\n\n18 of 20\n\nUnder the Banner of Heaven (2022)\n\nOne of the newest titles on this list, Under the Banner of Heaven stars Andrew Garfield as a devout Mormon detective investigating a murder of a Latter-day Saint mother and her baby daughter. The series owes much of its success to Garfield's dramatic performance and the 2003 source material, Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith by Jon Krakauer. Creator Dustin Lance Black worked for 10 years to adapt Krakauer's story for the screen, a lengthy process that was successfully honors rather than exploits the families affected. \"I want people to be able to make comparisons between what the Laffertys were going through in Utah in the '80s and what so many people in the world are going through right now,\" Black told EW. \"That's the lesson of this true-crime thriller.\"\n\nWhere to watch Under the Banner of Heaven: Hulu\n\nCast: Andrew Garfield, Gil Birmingham, Adelaide Clemens, Sandra Seacat, Daisy Edgar-Jones\n\nRelated content: Under the Banner of Heaven's Andrew Garfield on what sets his character apart from other true-crime detectives\n\n19 of 20\n\nWe Own This City (2022)\n\nA show that has flown under the radar since it premiered on HBO in April 2022, We Own This City is an unflinching, true-to-life drama about corrupt cops and a broken system. Jon Bernthal stars as Sgt. Wayne Jenkins, a Baltimore police officer and member of the Gun Trace Task Force that was at the center of 2017's corruption charges. What makes this miniseries a rough \"six fleet hours of simmering rage\" is its well-written, non-chronological script that pulls no punches in its bleak depiction of reality. From George Pelecanos and David Simon, the producer team on The Wire, this drama miniseries is, according to EW's critic, \"a blistering and brilliant cop show about the corrosion of American law enforcement and America itself.\"\n\nWhere to watch We Own This City: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Jon Bernthal, Wunmi Mosaku, Jamie Hector, Josh Charles, McKinley Belcher III, Darrell Britt-Gibson\n\nRelated content: Oughta Get a Nod: We Own This City and its dynamic star Jon Bernthal\n\n20 of 20\n\nWhen They See Us (2019)\n\nAva DuVernay directed this tough to watch but utterly essential dramatic series about the Central Park Five, a.k.a. the group of Black and Latino teens who were unjustly accused of the rape and assault of a white woman in Central Park in 1989. Told over the course of four episodes, When They See Us takes viewers behind the scenes of the police pressure to find a suspect that led to real-life consequences for five innocent children. As time progresses and the boys turn into men whose lives are upended by a crime they didn't commit, the series draws on their experience to paint a detailed portrait of race, incarceration, and injustice. Jharrel Jerome is notably outstanding as both young and adult Korey — and his speech during his trial was one of the most remarkable scenes to hit screens in 2019.\n\nWhere to watch When They See Us: Netflix\n\nCast: Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Jharrel Jerome, Marquis Rodriguez, Justin Cunningham, Jovan Adepo, Chris Chalk, Freddy Miyares, Vera Farmiga, Felicity Huffman\n\nRelated content: Ava DuVernay goes deep on her new Netflix series When They See Us"
