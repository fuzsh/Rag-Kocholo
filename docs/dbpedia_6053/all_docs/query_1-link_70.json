        "text": "African American author (1933–2019)\n\nErnest James Gaines (January 15, 1933 – November 5, 2019) was an American author whose works have been taught in college classrooms and translated into many languages, including French, Spanish, German, Russian and Chinese. Four of his works were made into television movies.[2]\n\nHis 1993 novel, A Lesson Before Dying, won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. Gaines was a MacArthur Foundation fellow, was awarded the National Humanities Medal, and was inducted into the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and Letters) as a Chevalier.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nGaines was among the fifth generation of his sharecropper family to be born on the Riverlake Plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana. That became the setting and premise for many of his later works. He was the eldest of 12 children, raised by his aunt, who was disabled and had to crawl to get around the house. Although born generations after the end of slavery, Gaines grew up impoverished, living in the old slave quarters on the plantation.[3]\n\nGaines' first years of school took place in the plantation church. When the children were not picking cotton in the fields, a visiting teacher came for five to six months of the year to provide basic education. Gaines then spent three years at St. Augustine School, a Catholic school for African Americans in New Roads, Louisiana. Schooling for African-American children did not continue beyond the eighth grade during this time in Pointe Coupee Parish.[4]\n\nWhen he was 15 years old, Gaines moved to Vallejo, California, to join his mother and stepfather, who had left Louisiana during World War II. He wrote his first novel at 17 while he was babysitting his youngest brother Michael. According to one account, he wrapped it in brown paper, tied it with string, and sent it to a New York publisher, who rejected it. Gaines burned the manuscript, but later rewrote it to become his first published novel, Catherine Carmier.\n\nIn 1956, Gaines published his first short story, The Turtles, in a college magazine at San Francisco State University (SFSU). The next year he earned a degree in literature from SFSU. After spending two years in the Army, he won a writing fellowship to Stanford University.\n\nFrom 1981 until retiring in 2004, Gaines was a Writer-in-Residence at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. In 1996, Gaines spent a full semester as a visiting professor at the University of Rennes in France, where he taught the first creative writing class ever offered in the French university system.[5]\n\nIn the final years of his life, Gaines lived on Louisiana Highway 1 in Oscar, Louisiana, where he and his wife, Dianne Gaines, built a home on part of the old plantation where he grew up.[1][6] He had the building where he attended church and school moved to his property.[1][7]\n\nGaines died from natural causes at his home on November 5, 2019. He was 86 years old.[4][8]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks\n\nCatherine Carmier (1964)\n\nOf Love and Dust (1967)[9]\n\nBloodline (1968)\n\nThe Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1971)\n\nA Long Day in November (1971)\n\nIn My Father's House (1978)\n\nA Gathering of Old Men (1983)\n\nA Lesson Before Dying (1993) – nominated for Pulitzer Prize, National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction (1993); Oprah's Book Club (1997)\n\nMozart and Leadbelly: Stories and Essays (2005)\n\nThe Tragedy of Brady Sims (2017)\n\nShort stories\n\n\"The Turtles\" (1956)\n\n\"Boy in the Double-Breasted Suit\" (1957)\n\n\"Mary Louise\" (1960)\n\n\"Just Like a Tree\" (1963)\n\n\"The Sky Is Gray\" (1963)\n\n\"A Long Day in November\" (1964)\n\n\"My Grandpa and the Haint\" (1966)\n\n\"Christ Walked Down Market Street\" (1984 - publish 2004) [10]\n\nFilmography\n\nThe Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, CBS Television (1974) – Directors Guild of America Award, eight Emmy Awards, nominated for a BAFTA award[11]\n\nThe Sky Is Gray, American Short Story Series, PBS (1980)\n\nA Gathering of Old Men, CBS Television (1987)\n\nA Lesson Before Dying, HBO (1999); winner, Emmy Award for Outstanding Made For Television Movie\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Medal of Arts 2012\n\nSidney Lanier Prize for Southern Literature (2012)\n\nAmerican Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award (2001)[12]\n\nThe F.
