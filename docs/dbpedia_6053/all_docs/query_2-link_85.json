        "text": "(Photo by Starz, Peacock, Netflix, Apple TV+, AMC, Hulu, FX, Paramount+, Disney+)\n\nAfter a few years of COVID-19 throwing a wrench into Hollywood’s production schedule, TV’s soothing, luminescent glow was shining as bright as ever in 2022. An estimated 599 scripted TV shows premiered that year, according to FX Research. And, provided that the writers and actors’ strikes or merger-related cancellations don’t derail things too much, 2023 may not be far behind.\n\nTo give you a heads up on what’s coming, we scoured the upcoming releases of new and returning shows on streamers, cable, and good old-fashioned broadcast TV to make a list of programs we’re eager to watch in 2023.\n\nSome of these shows include spin-offs of known franchises like the premiere of Disney+’s Star Wars series Ahsoka, starring Rosario Dawson and the second season of Marvel series Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston. Some are prequels, reboots, or continuations of old shows like The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon and limited series Justified: City Primeval. Some are book adaptations, like Netflix’s The Witcher and season 12 of American Horror Story. And some, like HBO’s Succession and Netflix’s The Crown, are joining us for the last time.\n\nSome of the “to be announced” titles are not confirmed for 2023, but we’re crossing fingers for them until we hear otherwise. Some may have aimed for 2023, but may have been pushed back by the strikes, as is the expectation on The Penguin, starring Colin Farrell.\n\nWe’ll update this list as more TV and streaming shows are confirmed for 2023 and trailers are released, so bookmark this page and check back often!\n\nSummer TV | Fall TV | To Be Announced | Previous\n\nSUMMER TV\n\nThe shows that should keep you glued to your screens while outside the sun melts the sidewalk.\n\n96% Only Murders in the Building: Season 3 (2023) (Hulu)\n\nPremiere Date: Tuesday, August 8\n\nDescription: Season 3 finds Charles, Oliver, and Mabel (played by Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez) investigating a murder behind the scenes of a Broadway show. Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd) is a Hollywood action star whose Broadway debut is cut short by his untimely death. Aided by co-star Loretta Durkin (Meryl Streep), our trio embarks on their toughest case yet, all while director Oliver desperately attempts to put his show back together.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Season 1, which is Certified Fresh at 100%, won two 2021 Golden Tomato Awards for Best New Series and Best Comedy Series, introducing us to the magic of acting trio of Martin, Short, and Gomez. The following year saw the inclusion of a new Golden Tomato genre, Best Mystery & Thriller Series, which the series won for its 98% Certified Fresh season 2. Season 3 adds Oscar winner Meryl Streep. There is no downside here. –DD\n\nRead Also: Summer Movie Calendar 2023\n\n86% Star Wars: Ahsoka: Season 1 (2023) (Disney+)\n\nPremiere Date: Wednesday, August 23\n\nDescription: Jedi exile Ahsoka Tano’s (Rosario Dawson) mission — teased in the second season of The Mandalorian — finally comes to fruition as she reunites with old allies from Star Wars Rebels to find a missing friend and face off against Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen), the heir to the Empire.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: For fans Rebels, the chance to see its last dangling plot point resolved is thrilling. Also, seeing returning Rebels characters Sabine Wren (now played by Natasha Liu Bordizzo), Hera Syndulla (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Chopper (voiced by Rebels’ Dave Filoni) in live-action further cements that animated series’ importance to the overall Star Wars saga. –EA\n\nRead Also: Everything We Know About Star Wars Series Ahsoka\n\nFALL TV\n\nShows to take the edge off of back to school and the end of beach days and summer vacation.\n\n86% The Wheel of Time: Season 2 (2023) (Prime Video)\n\nPremiere Date: Friday, September 1\n\nDescription: Based on the best-selling Robert Jordan fantasy series The Wheel of Time, Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski) learns he is The Dragon Reborn — a dangerous figure from history destined to save the world … or break it. Desperate to protect him from the Dark One, an army of powerful women must reckon with his burgeoning power and encroaching madness. The Wheel of Time turns, and the Last Battle approaches. Though Rand thought he destroyed the Dark One, evil is not gone from the world. In season 2, threats new and very old seek out the young friends from the Two Rivers, now scattered over the world. Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike), the woman who found and guided them, is now powerless to help, and so they must find other sources of strength. In each other, or themselves. In the Light … or the Dark.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: It feels like a right of passage for every new fantasy series to be compared to Game of Thrones, but The Wheel of Time feels more akin to its Prime Video streaming-mate The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The production quality and deep well of subject matter to pull from (14 novels, a prequel, and two companion books) positions The Wheel of Time as perhaps the more reliable genre epic. –AP\n\nStar Trek: Lower Decks: Season 4 (2023) (Paramount+)\n\n(Photo by Paramount+)\n\nPremiere Date: Thursday, September 7\n\nDescription: In this tongue-in-cheek animated series, the crew of the U.S.S. Cerritos convenes for more missions of second contact, extreme Star Trek in jokes, and whatever trouble Beckett Mariner (Tawny Newsome) can find. In the fourth season, the ship will visit planet Orion, deal with a wedding, and confront at least one other romantic entanglement.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Equal parts irreverent and heartfelt, Lower Decks scratches a specific itch for those who grew up with Star Trek: The Next Generation. But the show works because the characters continue to develop into real people, both on an emotional level and as an act of physical embodiment (there’s a planned crossover episode with the live-action Strange New Worlds). –EA\n\nRecommended: The Most Anticipated Movies of 2023\n\n70% The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon: Season 1 (2023) (AMC)\n\nPremiere Date: Sunday, September 10\n\nDescription: In The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, Norman Reedus’ motorcycle-loving hero washes ashore in France and struggles to piece together how (and why) he got there. The series tracks his journey across the broken but resilient, country as he hopes to find a way back home. But the connections he forms complicate his ultimate plan.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: While TWD we may not be getting the originally announced spin-off that would have focused on Daryl and Melissa McBride’s Carol, it will be magnifique to watch this fan-favorite navigate a post-apocalyptic France. We can only hope they’ve taken some of the country’s most famous places (like the palace of Versailles) and packed them with zombies. –JL\n\nAmerican Horror Story : Season 12 (FX on Hulu)\n\nPremiere Date: September 20 (Part 1)\n\nDescription: For its 12th installment, Ryan Murphy’s hit anthology is adapting Danielle Valentine’s upcoming book Delicate Condition. Set to publish the same month the new season drops, Delicate is being described as a modern-day feminist take on Rosemary’s Baby. The story follows Anna Alcott, a woman who is convinced that a sinister figure is doing whatever to stop her pregnancy from going full term. And, as you’d probably guess, none of the men in her life believe her.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: With body autonomy and women’s rights being a hot topic in recent years, it sounds like AHS: Delicate will be exploring that and more. It’s the first time the series has adapted pre-written work, which may be a plus for the franchise. Sure, Kim Kardashian is one of the stars this time around, but the return of Emma Roberts to the franchise and inclusion of newcomers Cara Delevingne and Emmy-winner MJ Rodriguez has definitely sparked our interest. –AP\n\n63% The Continental: From the World of John Wick: Limited Series (2023) (Peacock)\n\nPremiere Date: Friday, September 22\n\nDescription: Spinning off from the John Wick movie franchise, The Continental follows a young Winston Scott — Colin Woodell on the show; Ian McShane in the movies — as he navigates the criminal underworld of 1970s New York. Winston will face off with demons from his past as he pursues control of the Continental hotel, which — as we’ve seen in the films — serves as a neutral meeting place for the world’s most dangerous assassins. Mel Gibson also stars.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: So what you’re saying is we’ve got a new John Wick TV series that follows a bunch of assassins coming together in the grimy and seedy madness of 1970s New York? Sign us up. –AP\n\nRead Also: Everything We Know About John Wick TV Series The Continental\n\n97% Gen V: Season 1 (2023) (Prime Video)\n\nPremiere Date: Friday, September 29\n\nDescription: Gen V is the first official spin-off of Prime Video’s hit series The Boys. It shifts focus to the young Supes-in-training who attend Godolkin College. Here, they push their boundaries — physical, emotional, sexual, and otherwise — to compete for superhero greatness. The series’ cast includes Jaz Sinclair, Chance Perdomo, Lizze Broadway, Shelley Conn, Maddie Phillips, London Thor, Derek Luh, Asa Germann, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sean Patrick Thomas, and Marco Pigossi.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: If Gen V delivers even a quarter of the jaw-dropping satire that the flagship series it’s based on does, then we have a winner on our hands. –AP\n\n82% Loki: Season 2 (2023) (Disney+)\n\n(Photo by Marvel Studios)\n\nPremiere Date: Friday, October 6\n\nDescription: Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of the shocking season finale when Loki (Tom Hiddleston) finds himself in a battle for the soul of the Time Variance Authority. Along with Mobius (Owen Wilson), Hunter B-15 (Wunmi Mosaku), and a team of new and returning characters, Loki navigates an ever-expanding and increasingly dangerous multiverse in search of Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino), Judge Renslayer (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), Miss Minutes (voiced by Tara Strong), and the truth of what it means to possess free will and glorious purpose. Season 2’s cast also includes Eugene Cordero (Casey), Rafael Casal, Kate Dickie, Liz Carr, and Neil Ellice (Hunter D-90) with Jonathan Majors (Kang the Conqueror/Victor Timely) and Ke Huy Quan.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Hiddleston’s Loki remains one of the strongest elements of Marvel’s ongoing story machine. His bond with Mobius proved to be one of the highlights of this program’s first season. Even though things ended with Mobius seemingly not remembering Loki, we expect their double-act will continue as they unravel the new TVA mystery. –EA\n\n90% The Fall of the House of Usher: Limited Series (2023) (Netflix)\n\nPremiere Date: Thursday, October 12\n\nDescription: Ruthless siblings Roderick and Madeline Usher have built Fortunato Pharmaceuticals into an empire of wealth, privilege and power. But past secrets come to light when the heirs to the Usher dynasty start dying at the hands of a mysterious woman from their youth.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: The Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass creator Mike Flanagan returns to Netflix again this fall with this eight-episode limited series. Creator and executive producer Flanagan also directs four episodes with Doctor Sleep cinematographer Michael Fimognari directing the other four. The horror series is based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe and stars Bruce Greenwood, Carla Gugino, Mary McDonnell, Carl Lumbly, Mark Hamill, T’Nia Miller, Henry Thomas, Kate Siegel, Zach Gilford, Annabeth Gish, and more. –DD\n\n86% Lessons in Chemistry: Season 1 (2023) (Apple TV+)\n\nPremiere Date: Friday, October 13\n\nDescription: Set in the early 1950s, Lessons in Chemistry follows Elizabeth Zott (played by Brie Larson), whose dream of being a scientist is put on hold in a patriarchal society. When Elizabeth finds herself fired from her lab, she accepts a job as a host on a TV cooking show and sets out to teach a nation of overlooked housewives — and the men who are suddenly listening — a lot more than recipes.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Academy Award winner Larson (Room) takes the lead on an Apple Studios adaptation of Bonnie Garmus’ bestselling novel Lessons in Chemistry. What’s not to love? The ensemble cast includes Lewis Pullman, Aja Naomi King, Stephanie Koenig, Kevin Sussman, Patrick Walker, and Thomas Mann. –DD\n\nFellow Travelers: Limited Series (Showtime)\n\nPremiere Date: October 27\n\nDescription: Both an epic love story and a political thriller, this miniseries chronicles the volatile romance of two men who meet in the shadow of McCarthy-era Washington. One is the handsome and charismatic Hawkins Fuller (Matt Bomer), who avoids emotional entanglements. That is, until he meets Tim Laughlin (Jonathan Bailey), a younger man brimming with idealism and religious faith. They begin a romance just as Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn declare war on “subversives and sexual deviants.” Over the following decades, Hawk and Tim continue to cross paths — through the Vietnam War protests of the 1960s, the drug-fueled disco hedonism of the 1970s and the AIDS crisis of the 1980s — while facing obstacles in the world and in themselves.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Bailey made this show his first television project after his success in Bridgerton Season 2 and as he began to speak more about being a gay man in the public light. We can’t wait to see him join fellow star and LGBTQ+ activist Bomer in dramatizing America’s era of the Lavender Scare. –JL\n\n27% All the Light We Cannot See: Limited Series (2023) (Netflix)\n\nPremiere Date: Thursday, November 2\n\nDescription: Based on Anthony Doerr’s Pulitzer-winning, World War II–era novel, this limited series stars Aria Mia Loberti as Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French teen, and Mark Ruffalo as Daniel LeBlanc, her father and a locksmith at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. Together, they flee German-occupied Paris with a legendary diamond to save it (and themselves) from the Nazis. While on the lam, she connects with Louis Hofmann’s Werner, another teen who happens to be affiliated with the Nazi movement. It also stars Hugh Laurie as Uncle Etienne, a reclusive relative with World War I PTSD who helps keep Marie-Laure and Daniel safe while transmitting clandestine radio broadcasts as part of the resistance.\n\nWhy We’re Looking Forward to It: With a fall release (and subject matter) that’s more indicative of a movie meant for awards season bait, the promotional teaser for the four-part series showcases soaring direction from producer-helmer Shawn Levy. It’s also written by Peaky Blinders’ Steven Knight, which might suggest some edge to the dialogue. That Loberti actually is blind also helps move the inclusion needle in Hollywood. –WF\n\nInvincible: Season 2 (2023) 100%(Prime Video) [/tv_season_link_apple]\n\nPremiere Date: Friday, November 3\n\nDescription: After a long absence from our screens, (the animated series premiered in 2021) audiences will finally see Steven Yeun’s teen ‘supe Mark Grayson deal with the fallout of his father’s betrayal — not just to him, but to the human race. He’ll also have to learn what it means to be a superhero after that bloody and terrible confrontation.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Beyond the graphic violence, which is somehow quite beautiful despite the brutality, Invincible strikes a relevant chord with its use of super-heroics as metaphors for the macro (government overreach) and micro (discovering your parents are just as screwed-up as you). Although it remixes story beats from the comic that series creator Robert Kirkman developed with Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, expect Mark’s journey on the show to include taking point as a defender of the Earth. The all-star cast already includes Seth Rogen as Allen the Alien and Gillian Jacobs as the super-powered Samantha Eve Wilkins / Atom Eve. This season, Jeffrey Dean Morgan joins the cast — although his part is still unknown. –EA\n\nEcho: Season 1 (2024) (Disney+)\n\n(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel Studios)\n\nPremiere Date: Wednesday, November 29\n\nDescription: Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox) — aka Echo — heads home to Oklahoma in search of some peace following the events she experienced in the TV series Hawkeye and to reconnect with her extended Native American family. But her adoptive Manhattanite uncle, Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio), will not let her go without a few words — if not a full-on fight.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: The character and actor made a great debut in Hawkeye. But, for most Marvel fans, a key part of the draw is the promise of the characters Fisk and Daredevil (Charlie Cox) bringing their long feud to the doorstep of Maya’s family. Additionally, rumors persist that Daredevil is there to find another member of the Defenders (the characters who were first explored when MCU TV was primarily found on Netflix). –EA\n\nTO BE ANNOUNCED\n\nHere are some standout titles we had expected this year, but whose dates are not yet announced. The strikes have made the debut of several increasingly unlikely.\n\nArmy of the Dead: Lost Vegas (Netflix)\n\n(Photo by Clay Enos/Netflix)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: An animated series that serves as a prequel to the events in the Army of the Dead franchise, it’s set at the beginning of the zombie outbreak. There, Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) leads a rescue crew to protect the city of Las Vegas. That crew includes Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro) — whom fans saw with her helicopter in the 2021 movie — as well as characters played by Monica Barbaro, Christian Slater, Vanessa Hudgens, Jena Malone and Joe Manganiello.\n\nWhy We’re Looking Forward to It: Notaro famously replaced Chris D’Elia in the film in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against the comedian. This series will give her an even fuller, more substantial, role. –FT\n\nBig Mouth : Season 7 (Netflix)\n\n(Photo by Netflix)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: The edgy half-hour adult animated comedy from real-life best friends Nick Kroll and Andrew Goldberg is about the nightmare that is teenage puberty. Kroll, John Mulaney, Maya Rudolph, Jason Mantzoukas, Jordan Peele, Fred Armisen, Jenny Slate, and Jessi Klein lend their voices to the series.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Big Mouth began simply poking fun at topics like puberty, and the trials and tribulations kids go through in those awkward teenage years. Yet, each season has found the show maturing, with issues like sexual identity, race, and depression showing up in recurring plotlines. Is it deep? Absolutely. It’s also downright dirty fun. Don’t believe us? Just ask your local Hormone Monster. –AP\n\nThe Boys : Season 4 (Prime Video)\n\n(Photo by Prime Video)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: In the fourth season of the superhero show that also makes fun of superhero shows, Erin Moriarty’s supe Annie January (aka Stargirl) joins rebel alliance The Boys full-time to take down the nefarious Vought International corporation. Meanwhile, the group’s leader, Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), seems more unhinged and Vought golden boy Homelander (Antony Starr) sets his sights on larger aspirations than being adored.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Since its debut, The Boys has been utterly grotesque, wicked smart, and stunningly heartwarming. We look forward to more time with that unique recipe even if it feels as though the show is closing in on its endgame. Also, it’ll be nice to have a season in which Annie and her boyfriend Hughie (Jack Quaid) get to share their love in the open instead of sneaking around so she can follow Vought’s carefully constructed PR narrative. –EA\n\nThe Crown : Season 6 (Netflix)\n\n(Photo by Netflix)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: A decades-spanning saga explores Queen Elizabeth II’s legacy, the extended Windsor family, and the complex drama that has colored their royal reign.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: The sixth and final season of The Crown brings the tale into the 21st century and will introduce new components to the history-inspired drama, including the tragic death of Princess Diana and the early romance of Prince William and Kate Middleton. We’re hopeful the final season will feel less soap-y than season 5 and serve as a satisfying conclusion to Peter Morgan’s award-winning series. –AP\n\nFrasier Reboot (Paramount+)\n\n(Photo by Gale Adler/Paramount)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: Nearly 20 years after radio therapist Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) signed off, we’ve learned that he’s left Seattle. As to where he is in his life and what hilarity will ensue? They might be tossed salad and scrambled eggs.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: After the success of other sitcom revivals, Paramount+ made a deal with Grammer. They’ve been taking their time developing a new take on the show and character. But we just want to see Dr. Crane again and (hopefully) Roz (Peri Gilpin) too. Sadly, John Mahoney is no longer with us and David Hyde Pierce opted not to return as Frasier’s brother Niles. So that probably means no Jane Leeves either, as she played Niles’ wife Daphne. –FT\n\nGenius: MLK/X (Disney+/National Geographic)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: The fourth installment of the biographical miniseries shows the early years of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Jalyn Hall) and Malcolm X (Joshua Caleb Johnson). Their lives will intersect as adults when they both take different strategies to lead Civil Rights efforts; King promoting nonviolence and Malcolm X using “any means necessary.”\n\nWhy We’re Looking Forward to It: Genius has profiled scientist Albert Einstein, artist Pablo Picasso and singer Aretha Franklin. This is franchise’s first double-bill. It’s also about two people who are frequently associated together even their philosophies were at odds. This miniseries is the highest profile project in recent memory that would compare and contrast them. –FT\n\nThe Gilded Age : Season 2 (HBO)\n\n(Photo by HBO)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: Julian Fellowes, the creator of Downton Abbey, tackles 1882 America. Pennsylvania farmer Marian (Louisa Jacobson) experiences New York high society when she moves in with her aunts after her father dies. She also knows what a weekend is.\n\nWhy We’re Looking Forward to It: Fellowes’ brand of upstairs/downstairs intrigue gets multi-layered when it crosses the Atlantic. This story deals with the nouveau riche (Morgan Spector’s robber baron George Russell and his ladder-climbing wife, Carrie Coon’s Bertha) and the struggles to break into high society as well as similar struggles forming in the Black community. Last season saw that Bertha’s extravagant ball was a success. So will season 2 see her accepted in elite society and all that entails? Or, will the elite be their flaky old selves? –FT\n\nHacks : Season 3 (Max)\n\n(Photo by Max)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: After their marriage of convenience delivered a hit stand-up special, seasoned performer Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) fired TV writer Ava (Hannah Einbinder) at the end of the Emmy-winning comedy’s second season. Was she setting a little bird free or creating an enemy?\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: The writing and acting is top-notch so the third season could be about Deborah and Ava reading the phone book and we’re there. But the second season saw Ava and Deborah going off on their own. Hopefully, that doesn’t last long and they reunite for an even bigger project. –FT\n\nJulia : Season 2 (Max)\n\n(Photo by Seacia Pavao / HBO Max)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: With a bestselling cookbook and a hit television show under her belt, Julia navigates success with her singular joie de vivre, in a society that is changing rapidly. The second season of Julia explores the second season of making The French Chef, as Julia, in her singular way, wrestles with her success — what that means for herself, her marriage, her colleagues, and her friends — and how best to use the power she finds herself having.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Sarah Lancashire of Happy Valley fame makes her second appearance on the list with the return of Julia, whose first season was Certified Fresh at 93%. The cupboard is still bare when it comes to details for this season, but we can only assume it will take us to France as Julia prepares for a second season of her cooking series. –JL\n\nOrphan Black: Echoes: Season 1 (BBC America)\n\n(Photo by Sophie Giraud/AMC)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: A story set after the events in Orphan Black that ricocheted from Tatiana Maslany’s Sarah’s surprise encounter with one her (turns out) many clones at a train station, Orphan Black: Echoes takes a deep dive into the exploration of the scientific manipulation of human existence. It stars Krysten Ritter as Lucy, a woman with an unimaginable origin story who is trying to find her place in the world. But is also follows a group of women as they weave their way into each other’s lives and embark on a thrilling journey, unravelling the mystery of their identity and uncovering a wrenching story of love and betrayal.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: The first Orphan Black was a brilliant mix of sci-fi, feminism and Maslany’s knack for accent work. While this show isn’t an exact clone of that story, it does promise a chance to answer other questions about that complex universe. –WF\n\nOur Flag Means Death : Season 2 (Max)\n\n(Photo by Aaron Epstein/Max)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: Based on a true story, an 18th century aristocrat (Rhys Darby) leaves his wife and kids to become a pirate. There, he leads his crew into comic misadventure on the high seas and becomes an unlikely acquaintance of the infamous pirate Blackbeard (Taika Waititi).\n\nWhy We’re Looking Forward to It: Our Flags Means Death’s gentle sensibility doesn’t quite strike comedic gold, but its bemusing band of buccaneers is endearing enough that viewers seeking a comforting watch will find bountiful booty. Waititi executive produces the series with creator David Jenkins, mixing no-way-that’s-true historical facts in with some things that … may not be so accurate. Returning cast members also include Leslie Jones as the charismatic-as-long-as-you-don’t-cross-her pirate Spanish Jackie. –FT\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew (Disney+)\n\n(Photo by Kate Green/Getty Images for Disney)\n\nPremiere Date: 2023\n\nDescription: A group of youngsters end up in control of a starship. They must make their way home even as various powers attempt to catch up to them and as a Force-wielder (played by Jude Law) attempts to take them under his wing.\n\nWhy We’re Looking Forward to It: With its “Amblin movie but Star Wars” elevator pitch, this has the potential to be a very different Star Wars series. Additionally, it comes from the minds of Spider-Man: No Way Home’s Jon Watts and Robot & Frank’s Chris Ford, a duo with an interesting track record. Beyond that, directors like The Daniels (Everything Everywhere All At Once) leant their time to the project. –EA\n\nTokyo Vice : Season 2 (Max)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: Presented in a crime noir aesthetic, Tokyo Vice is a period drama (it takes place in the ‘90s) that follows American crime reporter Jake Adelstein’s (Ansel Elgort) time working for a Japanese newspaper. A clash of cultures and growing Yakuza threat are just a couple of the challenges Jake faces as he works to make a name for himself as a journalist in Japan.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Elgort, Ken Watanabe, and Rachel Keller delivered riveting performances throughout the show’s first run. Thanks to the oversight of Michael Mann, who directed the first two episodes, and a tight narrative that explores the insular world of 1990s Japan, Tokyo Vice left quite the impression when it first hit Max. We can’t wait to see where the story goes next. –AP\n\nNO LONGER EXPECTED IN 2023\n\nSome shows’ prospects for debut this year have dimmed due to the writers’ and actors’ strikes.\n\nIronheart (Disney+)\n\n(Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Disney)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: Following the events of the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Riri Williams’ (Dominique Thorne) technological prowess makes her a target. But now The Hood (Anthony Ramos) is looking for her. Is he an enemy? Or an unexpected ally?\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Thorne was a welcome presence in Wakanda Forever and we look forward to seeing her replicate her armored suit without Wakandan resources. Additionally, we wonder if the CIA will leave her alone despite knowing she can create a vibranium detector. –EA\n\nThe Penguin: Limited Series (Max)\n\nPremiere Date: TBA\n\nDescription: Noted Batman villain Oswald Cobblepot (Colin Farrell) continues his ascendency in the Gotham City underworld, adopting the affection of the Penguin along the way.\n\nWhy We Are Looking Forward To It: Although it’s fair to joke that Farrell’s Penguin get-up makes him look like actor Richard Kind, the actor’s performance as “Ozzie” was one of the highlights of the 2022 movie The Batman. Getting to spend six (or more?) hours with him as he figures out how to be the Penguin should be a delight. Additionally, Cristin Milioti signed on to be Sofia Falcone, daughter of the late crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). We imagine she will not be pleased by Cobblepot’s attempt to take over his empire. –EA"
