        "text": "A scene of one student innocently building the Twin Towers with blocks two years before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and knocking them down was quickly edited out of the show.\n\nThey were about to become tiny TV stars.\n\nBut they had little idea what was happening.\n\nThey were simply in kindergarten, releasing butterflies and losing teeth and learning about letters and kindness. Their focus was on Miss Johnson, all smiles and long hair and warmth, their teacher.\n\n\"I don't even remember cameras being there,\" said William Smith.\n\nOh, there were cameras.\n\nOn the first day of school in September 1999, when Jennifer Johnson welcomed little William and his 22 classmates to her morning kindergarten class at Upper Nyack Elementary School, three camera operators were waiting. So were producers and directors.\n\nThe making of a reality TV show about the magical first year of school was underway.\n\nVaccine mandate: Thousands of home health workers may lose jobs\n\nGang violence: A growing concern across the Lower Hudson Valley\n\nBread is back: Where to find Rockland, Westchester's best loaves (for subscribers)\n\nThe 13-part show, called simply \"Kindergarten,\" premiered on HBO Family 20 years ago this fall. It has been in reruns on HBO ever since, serving as a realistic and yet comforting introduction to kindergarten for countless tots and their nervous parents.\n\nThe star of the show remains Johnson, who was a 27-year-old, fourth-year teacher when she opened her kindergarten class to the world.\n\n\"I had a job to do, I had lessons to execute, so that was the goal every day, to give them a normal kindergarten experience,\" she said. \"The cameras and the extra bodies in the room kind of faded into the background pretty quickly.\"\n\nOf the students in that class, she said: \"They are sort of imprinted on my brain and in my heart as 5-year-olds. But clearly they are no longer 5-year-olds.\"\n\nToday, Johnson's forever-kindergartners are, in fact, 26 or 27. They are social workers, nurses, law school students, advertising directors and more. Some still live in Nyack, a suburban village overlooking the Hudson River, but most are scattered across New York state and the country.\n\nAnd last Sunday, about half the class had their first reunion outside the Nyack school where they became stars. There was lots of laughter and shrieks and \"Oh my gods,\" like at any reunion. But this group has a special bond, knowing that a vast audience continues to watch them cry over the death of a butterfly, trade hugs and awkward kisses for Valentine's Day, and burp and pick their noses.\n\n\"People will message me: Are you that girl from the show? Still!\" said Karimah White, who teaches finance and business at a high school, as her classmates giggled and nodded in affirmation.\n\nChoosing Nyack and a 'star'\n\nBetween the first day of school and the last in June 2000, a crew spent 55 days filming Johnson's morning class. Sometimes a lesson would have to be reshot, so Johnson would have to wear the same outfit two days in a row.\n\nThe crew spent parts of other days filming the students up close, one at a time, talking about their lessons and experiences. These clips helped ground each episode, as the series had no adult narration.\n\n\"I remember being interviewed, and I think I remember Miss Johnson having to re-read a story,\" said Anna Belle Newport, now a second-year student at Columbia Law School. \"But I've watched it since, so it's hard to know if they are my actual memories or what I remember from watching on the show.\"\n\nHBO had wanted a series about kindergarten, and turned to award-winning documentarians Karen Goodman and Kirk Simon as producers. They scouted dozens of schools in the New York metro area, looking for a diverse community that felt like it could be anywhere.\n\nThen they returned to the very first teacher they had met.\n\n\"Jennifer was the one to be our star,\" Goodman said.\n\nJohnson said she was reluctant to participate because of the obvious challenges she would face. This was before full-day kindergarten was common, so she would still have to teach a separate class of kindergartners in the afternoon. But friends and family, including her dad, nudged her to do the show.\n\nAt the reunion, White was still surprised that her former teacher had agreed to do it: \"We got thrown into it, but you said ‘I’m going to do this.’ As a adult!\"\n\nThe class was created like any other. But parents were allowed to choose a different kindergarten class for their child, and a few did.\n\nThen the HBO crew got to work, painting Johnson's classroom, adding special blinds, renovating a playground. The crew became part of the family at Upper Nyack Elementary, said Barnett \"Buzz\" Ostrowsky, who was then principal of the school and known to students as Mr. O.\n\n\"It was not a set-up; they didn't script anything,\" he said. \"They filmed everything that was going on, but were not terribly intrusive. The only thing was that we didn't do a kindergarten graduation because we thought it was a little over the top. But at the end of the year, they asked us to do one and we did. For the last episode.\"\n\nAt some point, the producers decided not to create the show chronologically, but to give each episode its own theme: the first day, the lifecycle of a caterpillar, the start of autumn, learning the letter F, the holiday season, how to behave in class, and more.\n\n\"Those themes are evergreen,\" Goodman said. \"We couldn’t have a found a more wonderful, charming, diverse group of kids to portray that experience. I don’t know if it was luck of the draw. Jennifer was key; people fell instantly in love with her.\"\n\nThe class sure did. In the opening episode, Jillian Gallo, who is now finishing a master's degree in social work, said of her teacher: \"I love her. Because she's so happy all the time.\" Classmate Lara Cordaro, now a nanny, raised her hand to tell Johnson: \"I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you!\"\n\n'Oh my God, you're adults'\n\nIt took Goodman, Simon and their team a full school year to turn their their footage into \"Kindergarten.\"\n\nThe series rolled out on HBO Family one episode a day between Aug. 26 and Sept. 7, 2001, its bouncy theme music performed by Bobby McFerrin and Yo-Yo Ma.\n\nBy the time the series premiered, its stars were in second grade. One day, a bus picked them and their parents and siblings up at Upper Nyack Elementary and took them to New York City for the official opening.\n\nBut it's now mostly a blur.\n\nA few vaguely recalled that only a few days after the show premiered, everyone's world was upended by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A scene of one student innocently building the Twin Towers with blocks two years before and knocking them down was quickly edited out of the show. \"What a crazy, terrible time,\" Ostrowsky said.\n\nDuring the first few years after the series aired, when the students still looked somewhat like their kindergarten selves, they would occasionally get recognized in random places. \"Are you that kid from the kindergarten show?\" But then they graduated to middle school, grew up and went their separate ways.\n\n\"Kindergarten\" has continued year after year in reruns — now easily accessible on HBO Max and on demand to HBO subscribers. The show's always expanding fan base has long taken to social media to wonder what came of the kindergarten kids.\n\nThen came last Sunday.\n\nThe Journal News/lohud had contacted Johnson, who still teaches in the Nyack school district, about looking back at the show on its 20th anniversary. She reached out to her former students about participating, and 11 wound up joining her at Upper Nyack. Mr. O and Goodman also joined the reunion.\n\n\"How is everyone? It's been so long!\" said Carly Dalton, who came up from Brooklyn and now works in advertising for national retail brands.\n\n\"I haven't seen you in like forever,\" Lourde-Quincy Vasser, a former football player at the University of Texas, now becoming a realtor in Austin, told Dalton.\n\nThen Johnson shimmied up the walk, wearing a black t-shirt with \"Kindergarten\" spelled out in gold glitter. \"Oh my God, you're adults!\" she cried. She gasped and squealed as she hugged each of her former students, and they did the same.\n\nThe former classmates shared their hazy memories of favorite scenes. They opened old photos on Johnson's phone and laughed. They took selfies and recreated a moment from the show by getting on the playground swings.\n\n\"I have to push Karimah and Will!\" Johnson laughed.\n\nArticle continues below gallery.\n\nHearing from fans\n\nOne experience they shared was of being contacted through the years by fans of the show — right up until recently.\n\n\"It was cute when I was in high school and I was contacted by a mom, like 'My third-grader loves the show,' or when I get a friend request from a child or someone who grew up watching us,\" Cordaro said. \"But someone called my parents' home a few months ago, in February. That's creepy. Then they called me like two days later and texted me, like 'I'm a big fan.'\"\n\nJohnson continues to get questions and comments from viewers, including from \"people who were inspired to start teaching because of something that they saw, or career-changers who decided to go into education. A lot of that. Or parents whose fears subsided a little bit. Because they saw a kindergarten experience, they were more comfortable with their own children heading off to this milestone experience.\"\n\nIn addition to teaching English in middle school, Johnson is writing a book about both her experience teaching kindergarten, which she did for nine years, and her father's influence on her life as an educator.\n\nAway from school, she's busy with two sons who are past kindergarten age, Carter, 12, and Cameron, 9\n\nFrom all signs last week, Johnson still has the zeal and good vibes that viewers of \"Kindergarten\" have admired for 20 years. When someone brought up a former classmate who couldn't make the reunion, Johnson urged a FaceTime call.\n\nThen she grabbed the phone: \"Hi Christopher! Come play with us! We’re at the playground!\""
