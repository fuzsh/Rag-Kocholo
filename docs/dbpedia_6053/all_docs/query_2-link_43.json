The trailer will also air simultaneously on Disney Channel, and on four channels across the Starz Entertainment Group network. Verizon Wireless customers will also be able to access the trailer through the company’s V CAST wireless multimedia service.\n\nWithin a 48-hour period surrounding this domestic launch, the international “roadblock” (dubbed in over 11 languages) will similarly introduce the trailer around the world, with simulcasts on popular programs in such countries as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Korea, and Latin America. In addition to the broadcast launches, each territory will partner with print and online outlets to maximize exposure.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures/Walden Media’s “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,” opens in theatres everywhere on December 9, 2005. Directed by Andrew Adamson (“Shrek,” “Shrek 2”) and produced by Mark Johnson (“The Rookie,” “Rain Man”), the film stars Tilda Swinton, James McAvoy, Rupert Everett, Jim Broadbent, Ray Winstone, Dawn French, Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Mosely and Anna Popplewell.\n\nCommenting on the announcement, Aviv said, “With all the interest and great anticipation that we’ve had for this epic big screen adaptation of the C.S. Lewis classic, we thought this was a great way to allow viewers and fans around the world to see the first images of the film at virtually the same time. We’ve lined up an extraordinary group of broadcast outlets around the world, and the AOL network will make the trailer available to online viewers everywhere. This first theatrical trailer for ‘The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe’ will give moviegoers a tremendous sense of the great adventure that awaits them in theatres this December.”\n\nCrawley added, “‘The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe’ is generating incredible interest all over the world, and we are thrilled to be introducing the movie trailer to a global audience through this broadcast and online ‘roadblock.’ With its universal themes, great characters, and fantastic adventure elements, we believe that this film is going to be a huge hit in the international marketplace. Television audiences and online participants are going to have a unique opportunity to see this first look at the film.”\n\nBased on C. S. Lewis’ timeless adventure, “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,” follows the exploits of the four Pevensie siblings — Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter — in World War II England who enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of ‘hide-and-seek’ in the rural country home of an elderly professor. Once there, the children discover an incredible new world inhabited by talking beasts, dwarfs, fauns, centaurs and giants that has become cursed to eternal winter by the evil White Witch, Jadis. Under the guidance of a noble and mystical ruler, the lion Aslan, the children fight to overcome the White Witch’s powerful hold over Narnia in a spectacular, climactic battle that will free Narnia from Jadis’ icy spell forever.\n\nThe film marks the first live-action directorial effort for New Zealander Andrew Adamson (the Oscar®-winning “Shrek,” “Shrek 2”), who also co-wrote the screenplay adaptation with Emmy Award-winner Ann Peacock (HBO’s “A Lesson Before Dying”) and scribes Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. The film is produced by Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Mark Johnson.\n\nTo bring his dazzling vision to the screen, Adamson has secured the talents of Oscar®-nominated cinematographer Donald M. McAlpine, ASC, ACS, Oscar®-nominated production designer Roger Ford, seasoned costume designer Isis Mussenden, film editors Sim Evan-Jones and Jim May and composer Harry Gregson-Williams."
