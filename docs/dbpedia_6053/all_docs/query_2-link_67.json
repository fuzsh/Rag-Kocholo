        "text": "It’s only August, but it’s not too early to get excited about the new season of TV! We’re dipping our toes into it with this Fall Sneak Peek issue and our cover story about Fox’s upcoming lifeguard drama Rescue: HI-Surf. It may look like another Baywatch—which in 1996 was the most watched TV show in the world (over a billion viewers per week!)—but these next-gen first responders will be doing a little less slo-mo beach running and a little more life-saving. They’re also on the shores of Oahu in surf that’s more dangerous than the waters off the beaches of Los Angeles County. Another new fall show we’re covering: Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage, a spinoff of the just-concluded Young Sheldon, last season’s most popular comedy. Look for Rescue in September…\n\nSource: Nielsen Media Research, week of July 8–14, 2024, in millions. Sly Fox Paramount+ is hoping that airing Season 1 of its hit crime drama starring Sylvester Stallone on sister network CBS this summer brings in new viewers for the show’s upcoming second season. It’s the streamer’s second-most-watched series (behind 1923), and the early results are promising. Making a Match With single lady Jenn Tran as the show’s first Asian American Bachelorette, viewership for the reality series’ Season 21 premiere jumped 46 percent over the previous year’s debut episode. Hot Messi In what could be soccer superstar Lionel Messi’s (below) last appearance with his national team, Argentina’s 1–0 win over Colombia was the week’s No. 1 program in both total viewers and the 18–49 demo. And the Winner Is… The starry athletics awards show, hosted by Serena Williams…\n\nThis Christmas, the March family is getting a fresh story—A Little Women’s Christmas— courtesy of Great American Family, which recently announced that the network’s first ensemble holiday film would be a contemporary retelling of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel. Jillian Murray (Code Black), Jen Lilley (Days of Our Lives), Julia Reilly (County Rescue) and Tony Award nominee Laura Osnes will take up the mantles of the four sisters (Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth, respectively) when the movie premieres during the network’s fourth annual “Great American Christmas,” and Gladys Knight will perform an original song. This might be the most wholesome version of the story yet.…\n\nDURING THE RUN of the classic The Bob Newhart Show (1972–78), a producer pulled the unassuming star aside and asked if he could reduce his stammering because the episodes were running long. Newhart said no. “That stammer bought me a house in Beverly Hills,” he wryly recalled in his 2006 memoir, I Shouldn’t Even Be Doing This! and Other Things That Strike Me as Funny. That stammer also helped put the former Chicago accountant on the map. Newhart, who died July 18 at 94, shot to fame as an unusually cerebral stand-up performer with pitch-perfect timing. His routines, often involving one-sided conversations featuring his halting reactions to absurd situations, were captured on the 1960 comedy album The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart. The first of its type to top the Billboard…\n\n@TVGMMattRoush Hollywood Black SERIES PREMIERE Sunday, Aug. 11, 10/9c, MGM+ FROM THE INDIGNITY of blackface minstrelsy in the silent era to the blockbuster heroism of Black Panther in the Marvel era, Hollywood Black (inspired by cinema historian Donald Bogle’s book) is a fascinating cultural critique. “I want us to get excited about reclaiming our land in the so-called entertainment industry,” says host-director Justin Simien (Dear White People). He doubles as professor and superfan over four jam-packed episodes of scholarship and opinion. We see Simien screen clips with filmmakers including Panther’s Ryan Coogler and Selma’s Ava DuVernay as they celebrate breakthroughs and lament the challenges of follow-throughs. (Example: Halle Berry’s career after her historic Oscar win for Monster’s Ball.) No icon is ignored, with special attention paid to Sidney Poitier. “He won an Oscar. He should have…\n\nTHE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS The Young and the Restless stars Lauralee Bell (Christine Blair) and Michael Damian (Danny Romalotti) will cross over in character to The Bold and the Beautiful in scenes airing August 13 and 14. Their appearance came about after Lauralee’s brother, Bradley Bell, B&B’s executive producer and head writer, saw an episode of Y&R where Christine had joined rock star Danny on a world tour. “It’s like Travis [Kelce] and Taylor [Swift],” quips Damian. Bradley then scripted the duo stopping in Los Angeles and visiting B&B’s Forrester family at their home during a party. “Brad sends me an email and says, ‘You’re going to sing “Rock On” on Bold and Beautiful,’” relays Damian of his No. 1 hit from 1989. “And what’s really crazy is that I was working…"
