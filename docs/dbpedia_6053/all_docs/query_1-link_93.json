        "text": "The title implies an ambitious project: \"Dynamite and Roses.\"\n\nAnd taking on broad, important themes is entirely in character for UNLV associate professor of theater Bob Benedetti, who this week closed a deal to write and produce his third movie for HBO. \"Dynamite and Roses\" is a working title , but is nonetheless true to its subject matter. The script will bring to life \"the story of an improbable love that changed the world,\" to use Benedetti's description.\n\nThe story centers on crusading leaders of the late-1800s American labor movement, Lucy and Albert Parsons. At the time of their marriage, Albert was a former Confederate Army scout and Lucy had just been released from slavery.\n\nTheirs was one of the first highly visible interracial marriages in U.S. history, joining two of the most powerful and feared figures in the labor movement. In 1886, they led a march of 80,000 workers down Chicago's Michigan Avenue, demanding an eight-hour workday. During an infamous nighttime rally at Haymarket Square, protesters committed the first recorded domestic bombing in the United States (the \"dynamite\" of the working title). Several protesters and police officers were killed, and though the Parsons were not present at the bombing, they were arrested and tried for inciting a riot.\n\nDuring a recent phone interview from his home in Santa Monica, Calif., Benedetti said the story tells the Parsons' tale in great detail, focusing on their love for each other while intertwining the obstacles they faced while fighting for workers' rights.\n\n\"I'm going to use the love story to convey a statement: that a Hispanic, American Indian and African-American woman met and fell in love with a Confederate Army scout,\" Benedetti said. \"It was a radical relationship in a very, very hard time.\"\n\nHe's working on the script now, but HBO is far from setting an air date.\n\nBenedetti, who has been with the UNLV faculty for about a year, has written and produced several films and TV movies and has done some acting (including guest spots on \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"L.A. Law\" and \"Cheers\"). His previous HBO projects were \"The Canterville Ghost\" (starring Patrick Stewart and Neve Campbell), \"Miss Evers' Boys\" (starring Alfie Woodard and Laurence Fishburne) and \"A Lesson Before Dying\" (with Don Cheadle, a former student of Benedetti's at the School of Theatre at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia). \"Miss Evers' Boys\" and \"A Lesson Before Dying\" each won Emmys for Best Television Movie, and \"Lesson\" also won a Peabody Award.\n\nBenedetti has also written a novel, \"The Long Italian Goodbye\" (Durban House), which was published in 2005.\n\nNoteMart\n\nThe long-expected closing of Ra at the Luxor was made official Wednesday. The space will be occupied by three venues from Pure Management Group: Nightclubs LAX and the Roxy (two famed Los Angeles hot spots) will be joined by a third yet-to-be-announced restaurant. Ra closes for good Saturday night; it was the standard for Vegas ultralounges when it opened on New Year's Eve 1997 Bow-tied meteorologist Nate Tannenbaum has always carried himself with an air of public TV decorum. On Friday he begins a new venture as host of KLVX Channel 10's \"Community Billboard.\" Tannenbaum will appear in minutelong segments between programs to inform viewers about the latest happenings with Southern Nevada's nonprofit organizations\n\nExtroverted and opinionated Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman has taken umbrage (Umbrage, we tell you!) at the new video game \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas,\" due later this year from Ubisoft. The game depicts a military squad fighting terrorists who have taken hostages on the Strip (forcing them to play \"Beverly Hillbillies\" slot machines, we guess). \"It's based on a false premise,\" Goodman told the Associated Press. The mayor also said Las Vegas is \"the safest place imaginable\" and would try to halt the game's production Gerry McCambridge could probably see this coming, but his \"Mentalist\" show at the Stardust has not yet even moved to evenings and has already dropped its ticket prices. The new prices (unless they change again tonight, when it debuts at the Stardust Theatre) are $27.95; VIP seats are $32.95\n\nMark Gray, who has handled his duties at KirvinDoak Communications with Joe Montana-like precision, is making a move to People magazine (which is fitting, as he is a person). Gray will serve as the magazine's Las Vegas correspondent. He leaves KDC at the end of the month and starts at People in mid-August A slice of life unfolded at Caesars Palace late Tuesday night as I walked behind a fairly large, younger guy carrying a piece of pizza in an open cardboard box. We headed to the elevators and toward two nightlife-lovin' ladies, and one snapped the pizza out of the box and continued to saunter into the casino (to the nightclub Pure, we surmised). \"She needed it more than me, I guess,\" was the nonplussed guy's comment\n\nA cabby friend reports the vanity plate DV8FRME on a gold Infinity. Deviate from me? Deviate for me? The V8 for me? The mind boggles.\n\narchive"
