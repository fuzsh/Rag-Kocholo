        "text": "Carrier\n\nNCIS Special Agent Tony DiNozzo assists the New Orleans team when a Navy lieutenant on liberty dies of the bubonic plague. The team races to locate all additional sailors on liberty, control a potential outbreak and determine the source of the highly infectious disease. NCIS stars Michael Weatherly, Rocky Carroll and Pauley Perrette guest star.\n\nMe Donkey Want Water\n\nJanette, Aunt Mimi and Annie commit to new deals, with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Toni may have found the killer she seeks; Terry is still looking for his; L.P. Everett meets his victim's family; Batiste plays his bone in Texas; Sonny plays his music closer to home.\n\nThe Silence of the Cicadas\n\nJackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta fly to Japan to recover the rest of Oz's father's research involving animals. Also, Jamie convinces Mitch to accompany her on a trip to her hometown in Louisiana to show a senator their findings on the abnormal behavior of the zoo lions. In Paris, Chloe is the first to be recruited by a shadowy intelligence agent, Gaspard Alves (Henri Lubatti), who is looking for the cause of the strange animal behavior, and a death row inmate escapes from a Mississippi prison after a vicious wolf invasion sets the prison ablaze.\n\nPack Mentality\n\nJackson, Abraham, Mitch, Jamie and Chloe are tasked by a top intelligence agent to find the cause of the strange animal behavior around the world. When the team travels to Mississippi to investigate the wolf attack on the prison, Mitch and Abraham break off to catch one of the wolves, and Chloe, Jackson and Jamie discover that death row inmate escapee Evan Lee Hartley (Marcus Hester) might somehow be involved in the attack. Also, the team meets FBI Agent Ben Shafer (Geoff Stults), who may know more about the prison fire than he's saying."
