        "text": "In the weeks since a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, sparking protests nationwide against police brutality and systematic racism, the HBO series Watchmen has often been cited as a predictive text for the current moment. Now, those who were not able to watch the Damon Lindelof series when it debuted last year will get the chance for free.\n\nHBO has announced all nine episodes of Watchmen will stream at no cost beginning on Friday (the holiday Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States) through Sunday. Watchmen joins a number of other free content offerings “highlighting Black experiences, voices and storytellers” available via HBO, including Being Serena, Bessie, Say Her Name: The Life & Death of Sandra Bland, and the Spike Lee documentary 4 Little Girls, among many others.\n\nBased on the influential graphic novel written by Alan Moore, Watchmen imagined an alternate history of America where the United States won the Vietnam War and Robert Redford served multiple terms as president. But the show began with a lengthy recreation of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where white residents attacked the predominantly black community of Greenwood in what has been called the deadliest incident of racial violence in U.S. history. (More than 300 people died in the Tulsa attack.) As its season moved on, Watchmen revealed itself to be about deep-rooted white supremacy throughout government and law enforcement. The acclaimed sixth episode, “This Extraordinary Being,” co-written by Lindelof and Cord Jefferson, focused on the first superhero in its universe, a black police officer and survivor of the Tulsa massacre fighting white supremacy from inside the police force.\n\n“I have to say that it’s a lesson that I was hearing for a very long time and selectively ignoring,” Lindelof said in an interview with Little Gold Men about his role in elevating the voices of his black collaborators on Watchmen. “And so it became impossible to ignore when I became compelled to tell a story inside the Watchmen canon that was predominantly about race, versus that race was a component to it.\"\n\nIn addition to streaming for free, HBO will air a marathon of Watchmen episodes starting at 1 p.m. ET/PT on Friday via both HBO and HBO Latino.\n\nWhere to Watch Watchmen:\n\nAll products featured on Vanity Fair are independently selected by our editors.
