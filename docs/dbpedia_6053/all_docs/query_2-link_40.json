Essay on The Concept and Formation of the Term Hispanic Over the course of history, the term Hispanic has been used to categorize a certain portion of the world s population without knowing the true meaning behind the term. By definition, the term Hispanic refers to of or relating to the people, speech, or culture of Spain or of Spain and Portugal (Webster, 2014). Another definition of this term is of, relating to, or being a person of Latin American descent living in the United States; especially one of Cuban, Mexican, or Puerto Rican origin (Webster, 2014). Before one can assume that they fully understand this controversial term, they must remember how the term came to be.

Moreover, the lasting consequences left by the introduction of the conquistadors to the New World, can still be seen today. The conquistadors created an entire racial mixture between the native Spaniards, the indigenous inhabitants and the native Africans that were introduced to slavery by the Portuguese colonists (Fox, 2010). When the conquistadors first arrived to the New World, they were introduced to what some referred to as exotic women which was a term often used to describe the indigenous women. Due to this introduction, both races created what today is known as criollos mestizos , mulatos , etc. The term criollo refers to the whites that were born in in latinoamerica. Whereas, the term mestizos refers to those who had a mix of European and indigenous blood. However, the social cultural status became stricter for those that fit under the mulatos description, those who had a white and African blood mix (Fox, 2010). These terms were often used to discriminate against the general population and keep control over said population by setting regulation on activities that they were allowed to participate in and those that they were not. Among other things, these social statuses dictated the jobs that were appropriate for them and those that were not. Even though times have changed one can see that the social regulations that were set during the XV century are still being applied today. In the XV, the parentage of an ...

It isn t uncommon for you to see numerous homeless, and needy people on the side of the street. They range from sitting out playing a guitar to raise money, selling homemade crafts for money, or simply some just begging for your kindness in lending them all that you are willing. How do some end up living day to day with what they have, and another s having enough money to where they don t know what to do with it? Countless families struggle, while others have no care in the world financially. Economic inequality (always known as the gap between the rich and poor) consists of the distribution of wealth and the income. (Reich) In the Jacobus text Robert...

In this specific writing, Robert explores why the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer, he examines the difference between the rich and the poor, and if the process is going to change in the future or not. One main reason as the why the richer are getting richer and the poor poorer is because of the machinery. Machinery is being put in and wiping out lower class jobs for Americans. (Lichter) The rich are getting richer because they come up with ideas that they sell to other countries and make money off of. Robert then describes the differences. Noting on that one difference would be the level of education a successful, wealthy person received compared to a poor, struggling individual. Then lastly, it tells about if their shall be a change in the future or not. In the last decades the problem has been getting worse and will continue to be an issue if we don t make it change.

The Great Reset By Richard Florida The Great Reset by Richard Florida discusses the many issues that have occurred due to various recessions and depressions. The book provides an outlook and realistic perspective on how he perceives the current crisis will play out. Florida states that the new normal will not be as focused on cars, houses, and suburbs. We will not be as centered on the ownership society which George W. Bush discussed. This is an upsetting realization. Owning a house is not what it used to be. Growing up, owning a house was a big dream of mine. With a new economy like we are in, owning a house tends to be more of a hindrance. I can understand where his point of view is coming from. In today s society you have to be able to have a flexibility, which sometimes involves moving to a new place. Renting houses or apartments is going to become the greater choice. Many of the resets in the past have recovered and actually brought about some good aspects. For instance, the first reset gave us a technological revolution where energy systems were created and many crucial inventions were made. This reset also helped in terms of transportation. Transit systems became an important mode of transportation and they have become such an important mode of transportation in big cities. Through these times of reset, there has been a large increase in immigration. Although many people viewed this as another way for jobs to be taken away, it has had beneficial aspects.

The Cover All Together Now was created after watching his daughters school play and praising Steve Jobs for his creation of the IPhone (Cover Story: All Together Now). Chris Ware wrote, Sometimes, I ve noticed with horror that the memories I have of things like my daughter s birthday parties or the trips we ve taken together are actually memories of the photographs I took. The January 2014 New Yorker cover depicts a school play with an audience full of adults watching; however, the play is taking place in the twenty first century. Smart phones dominate how people view a show or concert. The phones become the new eyes of the audience. The play is separated. Each child is the one focus of each smart phone, instead of watching the play as a whole. While the children are suppose to be the center of focus, the smart phones take up the majority of the cover to emphasize how dependent and needed the adults are to the phones. Also the colors on the cover are very bright; however, the colorful parts of the cover are very small in comparison the dominant black smart phones. The adults in the cover are there to experience a school play; instead they are experiencing a small screen with their child s face on it. The idea of living in the moment is gone; they are focused on the future and to preserve the present by recording. It is important do to the example given to children, who already are attached to ...

The Historical Landmarks Of Jerusalem While the present day Jerusalem flourishes with the pilgrims attracted by the city s religious significance and the tourists intrigued by its historical landmarks, it was merely a minor city state in the ancient times. However, rather than a miracle that had occurred overnight, the social and economic status of Jerusalemwas obtained through a process of evolution, the early parts of which were recorded in the Hebrew Bible, which is a collection of narratives based on genuine historical events while centering its stories on divine power. In the case of Jerusalem, the Bible provides intricate accounts of religiously significant events that were in sync with the stages of Jerusalem s development, starting with King Davids choice to designate the city as the capital of the United Monarchy, and culminating around the time of Solomon s construction of the First Temple, as well as the fall of the city to the Babylonians. Through these references to the Bible, which centralize early events of the Israelite religious history in the city of Jerusalem, it is unequivocal that not only has Jerusalem affected the religious society of the Israelites, but the evolution of the city into a political and spiritual capital is also related to the religious events that took place in the city. To examine the connection between religion and space, Thomas Tweed introduces a model in his short essay Space , which defines the characteristics of religious spaces like Jerusalem interrelated, ...

Effects of Plyometric Exercises on Power Production Introduction In a number of sports, the ability to produce a high muscular power output is required. Power is critical for the performance of sports that require quick changes in directions, jumping, and sprinting.1 To increase power production a number of plyometric exercises and programs can be performed. The theory of specificity plays a large role in deciding what plyometric exercises should be performed to improve power output.2 The theory states that the exercises should replicate the movement as closely as possible for the best results.1,3 Plyometrics are used to increase muscular power output and is accomplished by training the muscles to do more work in a shorter amount of time.1,4 The purpose of this report is to review the literature on the effects of plyometric exercises on power production. Mechanical Model of Polymeric Exercise The mechanical model has three critical components to explain how force production occurs in skeletal muscle. The three components of the mechanical model (Figure 1.) are the contractile component (CC), the parallel elastic component (PEC) and the series elastic component (SEC).5,6 The (CC) are made up of actin, myosin, and cross bridges that produce the primary force during a muscle contraction.6,7 The PEC is made up of the epimysium, perimysium, endomysium and the muscle fiber.6,8,9 This formation of connective tissue exerts a passive resistive force when stretched.

America As A Melting Pot As soon as someone calls the United States a melting pot, I immediately picture the School House Rock music video in which hundreds of happy immigrants dive into the pot to swim together in harmony. The idea of America as a melting pot is, on the surface, a good intentioned metaphor that carries with it the implication of our unity within one, uniquely American culture. Unfortunately, this metaphor carries negative connotations as well, including forced assimilation into the majority as you melt away into the mix. Imagine five pieces of chocolate, one white, added to a heated saucepan; eventually, it all turns brown. Despite the multiplicity of cultures added to this melting pot, something is lost in the final product: diversity. In a melting pot, it is suggested that we blend together; we are indistinct; we are Americans united in one culture, one language, one creed. Simply stated, this is not an accurate representation of our country s culture or its citizens. I find the stew to be a much more appropriate metaphor. Even when heated and stirred, a stew maintains its individual elements (potatoes, beef, onions, carrots, celery, etc.), but also allows for some transfer of flavors. The beef flavor is infused with notes of carrot and onion; the carrots have the added flavors of the broth and beef. The stew continues to have unique, individual elements, but it tastes better in tangent with other flavors. This is a more fitting description of America, as citizens ...

It was the highest point of Roman civilization, greater than any prior empires and towers over even the empires after it; it triumphed over the world . The Roman Republic was what built up the foundation for the Roman Empire. During the Republic, a small group of people started from scratch and developed their own systems, which later develops into the Roman Empire. The strong leaders of the Republic had conquered much land and people for Rome. The Roman Republic thus ignites Roman civilization, which leads on to the second step the Roman Empire.

Because Augustus encouraged trade, many roads and highways were built for convenient traveling. Trading made easier increased trade, which boosted Roman economy even more. The Greek Empire occurred before the Romans and when compared to the Roman Empire, seems to be modest, not as great. The Greeks did not have as much conquered lands, which lessens their power. What they did have conquered was divided into parts amongst different rulers, who were constantly at war with each other, lacking the peace that Pax Romana had. The conquered Greek lands did not have a chance to civilize as one great empire as the Romans had. The Byzantine Empire followed the Roman Empire, and it, also, seems meager in comparison. It had evolved from the Roman Empire, and because it was in the late stage that it was in, land had been lost, so in terms of size, the Roman Empire was superior to the Byzantine. The empire wasn t strong, either. At the start, the first ruler, Justinian, attempted to reconquer Roman lands, but in doing so, left his own land in ruins, and his conquests were lost right after his death. The Empire faced many enemies and was threatened constantly by them. Eventually, all land was lost except for the Constantinople, the rich and powerful capital city, and the land surrounding it. As can be seen, the Roman Empire was great for its time in more ways that one, with its undefeatable strength and size . It was greater than the empires before it ...

His method is rather subtle and might not initially be recognized as satire without some knowledge of both the author and Russia at the time of the novel s creation. Zamyatin starts the book with D 503 excitedly explaining his current project, the INTEGRAL, and why exactly it and his records are so important.

The stories have their individual differences, but in the end they both argue that while trauma can crack people s foundations, with the strength of will and love, people can endure. In The Mother, the narrator and her familyhave fled their home country, the Dominican Republic, because of the country s dictatorship. The narrator, Laura, describes those years as a series of disappearing friends, sleepless nights, house arrest and only after a narrow escape did they escape from that world to America (2758). Their new worry is that immigration will send them back to that traumatic life. The last bit of action in the short storyis Laura s meeting with the social worker, Sally O Brien. The main setting is America, and vignettes of Laura s memories from her life in the Dominican Republic are distant memories. In Woman Hollering Creek, the focus is on CleГіfilas s wedding and marriage the stage of her trauma. Unlike The Mother, Woman Hollering Escape shows the fear within the trauma and not what came after escape.

It is almost exclusively played in the United States, at least thats where the most religious fans live. There are roughly 17 million people who tune in to watch an average football game every weekend, and each stadium holds roughly 100,000 people which is regularly filled with fans. So what is it that fans of football love so much about the sport, is it the connection to a cities team, the lovableness of the teams mascot, the fact that football is one of the last true contact sports, or the attractive cheerleaders. While I might argue that it s hard to complain while watching the cheerleaders, when most people are asked what aspect of football keeps them coming back, they often answer that they love the physicality of the sport. While football has always been a sport of contact, physicality, and force, over the years they have gone to great lengths to add rules in order to help protect the players from devastating injuries. Some of the measures that have been taken include face mask penalties, horse collar penalties, and a relatively new penalty for targeting. While football leagues such as the National Football Leaguehave taken great strides to help prevent devastating injuries in the game the Americans hold so dear to their hearts, I would argue that rather than decrease injuries, football has actually seen a significant increase in serious injuries due to the fact that players feel the need to overexert ...

The other, sad, closed off, creepy, and not surprising, does not have a knack for snacks or sweets. Two opposites, the story not complete without the other. Now the story would not be complete without one becoming completely jealous and despising the other. Commonly this leads to several things such as arguing, fighting, or to better put it, leads to betrayal. Betrayal, a common theme among siblings, say one thing do another, it s inevitable.

This is traditionally accomplished through a monetary incentive that is a result of the exclusivity granted by a copyright or patent. The potential of being granted the exclusive rights for the creation and distribution of a potentially new and useful idea or technology is what drives people to create new ideas in a capitalist society. [4] By copyrighting software, software developers are encouraged to create new and exciting software because they have, at the very least, a monetary incentive to benefit from their work. Finally, copywriting software allows the creator to determine how his software is to be used. For example, software copyright has enabled licenses like the General Public License, which allows anyone to use the software without restriction, but requires that any modification of the software be shared openly like the original.

Shaming is a deliberate effort to attach a negative meaning to a behavior. Deterrence is a measure that prevents a person from doing something because of fear of the consequences. Shaming will help establish a norm for a small group of people, but for most people who feel the need to break norms of society shaming will not be very effective. Deterrence will be much more effective in preventing people from committing crimes. There are two types of deterrence: general deterrence and specific deterrence. General deterrence applies to the general population that helps ensure that they will not commit crimes in the future. It is the fear of experiencing consequences that have been applied to others who have committed the crime. This is the primary method of preventing crime in the world to create a fear of having negative sanctions brought onto a person if they fail to follow the norms set out by society. Specific deterrence on the other hand is the changing of the attitude of individuals who have been or are still being punished by the law, to deter them from committing crime again. Specific deterrence is effective, but still flawed as evident by the high recidivist rate. One of the most important sociological topics is the differential association theory. This theory was created by Edwin Sutherland and he states that criminal behavior that violates society s norms is learned. A person learns to commit deviant behavior through his or her environment, primarily through communication. A person learns not only how to commit the crime, but also the mindset of how to commit the crime. The learning process that comes with crime is the same as any other learned idea, it is usually developed through small intimate groups of people that help shape one s perception of the world.

This can be seen in the way Branagh retells his turmoil out loud... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... What this means is he has decided to focus on Hamlet s grief of his father s death unlike Branagh who instead gives more focus on Hamlet s disdain in his mother remarrying. While speaking Oliver enunciates each word, How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable. (l, ii, l. 135) so that you actually feel his misery, he talks softly and slowly to convey he is tired of the world. His entire posture is given the look of someone through with life. While walking he takes each step deliberately, heavy and lost in his thoughts. He stands before the chair that could have possibly been his father s as if he might be standing before him with his arms crossed at his back. All these various acting techniques display how a person might act while mourning. Branagh on the other hand builds to a momentum; as he talks the angrier he gets. The way he emphasizes, within a month , (l, ii, l. 145 and 149) again and again allows the audience to know just what he thinks of the wedding. She married. O most wicked speed, to post , (l, ii, l. 156) is an important part because of the way Branagh decided to stress certain words, as if he is so disgusted he cannot even talk. It can be said he is so angry that he cannot contain it within himself that he has to use his body to express himself. Each time he points Branagh tends to point in the same direction, which could indicate ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n35. Who Was Responsible For The Destruction Of Julius Caesar... Julius Caesar and the Destruction of the Roman Republic Many people over time have debated whether or not Julius Caesar was responsible for the destruction of the Roman Republic. (3) Strangely, Julius Caesar was a favorite to many in Rome, even though he was a complicated man; this made it difficult for people to truly decide whether or not his actions were the cause (Bedoyere 260). (5) Although this mystery of whose fault it truly was, many have come to the same conclusion, it was Caesar, who was completely responsible. (2) Because of Julius Caesars conflict with Pompey, his emergence into dictatorship, and his assassination, one could believe that Julius was responsible for the destruction of the Roman Republic.

Caesar worked hard to give the people jobs, and came up with countless ideas to help Rome. Caesar had other ideas, and with the army behind him... took over jobs of consuls, and power as a tribune. His actions went down badly with traditionalists, who thought he was trampling on Republican Systems, (Moody 260). While Caesar did reject the crown three times, he even once said The Republic is nothing, a mere name without body or form, (Duncan 245). But he still accepted to be a dictator for at least ten years, and by 44 B.C. it was extended for life, which was much worse, (Lee 100) He used his military strength and popularity to gain this control in 44 B.C....Caesar s reign marked the end of the Roman Republic.

Especially in nursing field where working as a team is highly emphasized, every member of the team collaborate together in order to meet patient needs and improve patient outcomes. That being said, nurses have to collaborate with coworkers that have different social groups, ethnic, and educational backgrounds.

The issue was approach from a criticizing angle that immediately lead to a defensive response by the LPN. The RN did not asked the reason why this LPN was not able to help the patient but she jumped in the conclusion that the LPN was not helping her in purpose. Furthermore, in this tensioned situation it seems like there is process conflict between two of the nurses. Huber, 2015 defines process conflict as a conflict pertains to issues of duty and resource delegation, such as who should what and how much responsibility different people should have (p. 172). This confusion between the team members it is revealed sentences when the RN tells the LPN that it was your job, you are assigned to Mrs. J. And the LPN responds to here that I do my own work and part of yours. To better assist patient in medical field, nurses might collaborate and work in team. The RN is fully competent in delegating the appropriate tasks to LPN or UAP, yet she has to make sure to transmit her tasks by using clear communication, being concise on what she wants to be completed, and within what time frame the task has to be completed. She can delegate certain tasks to other staff members such as LPN or UAP; however, she is accountable for what happens to the patient. Both the nurse delegator and the delegate must agree in the task and report back the completion ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n37.

As indicated by 71% of the United States there is no harsher discipline than death itself. 58 nations hone capital punishment. The United States of America, is one of the 58. Starting at 2015 the United States will just utilize capital punishment if indicted first degree kill. Some trust that death penalty will prevent killers. I will be contending that capital punishmentdoes not stop lawbreakers and that the United Statesought to cancel this ihumane type of discipline. Before I make my side of the contention, Here is some foundation data on the death penalty. The death penalty was brought over from Britain, when the establishing fathers pronounced autonomy. Europeans gave capital punishment for different violations. The primary recorded execution in America happened in Jamestown, 1608. A man named George Kendall was executed for conspiracy. In the prior provincial days, laws with respect to the death penalty differed relying upon the district and the idea of the wrongdoing. Amid the nineteen century, capital punishment changed drastically. Around this time capital punishment began to lose prevalence. Expresses never again dedicated open executions. All executions were done in private. Pennsylvania was the principal state to receive this pattern. Inevitably a few states abrogated capital punishment all together. In current circumstances, fourteen out of fifty expresses never again complete capital ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n39. Abiotic Factors Affecting Natural Resources Production...

The presence of these factors could provide for a peaceful and healthy environment and the disappearance of these factors could wreak havoc on an environment. Abiotic factors focus more on the physical aspects of an environment and biotic focuses more on biological.

Abiotic factors can determine which species of organisms will survive in any given environment. This factor is important because they affect how organisms survive. The abiotic factor can be placed into categories of meteorology, soil, air pollution, micro topographic features, water availability, and water quality. Chemical and geological factors, such as rocks and minerals, and physical factors, such as temperature, weather, and lay of the land, are also referred to as abiotic components. Biotic factors are the living parts of an ecosystem, such as the animals, plants, and microorganisms. A factor created by a living thing or any living ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n40. Teaching As A Brilliant Lesson Essay In the past I thought that teaching a brilliant lesson would help students to learn, but I have gradually realised that didactic teaching has little or no impact on the majority of our students. It is a sad truism that a significant number of our students are uninterested and resistant to learning, possibly due to their own previous experiences, peer pressure and the nature of influences outside of the classroom. My concern as a teacher of these students has been to identify strategies that can be used to facilitate their learning, improve their self confidence and persuade them that learning is something worthwhile for them. One of the implicit aims of our school is to increase the aspirations of our students; to help them obtain the qualifications they need to achieve their life goals and so help them and their families improve their life chances (see appendix 1). So given that our aim is to increase the aspirations of our students; to help them obtain the qualifications they need to achieve their life goals ; the question we must ask is how can we do this ? I am increasing drawn to the ideas of Vygotsky (Fisher, 2005: 210; Minton, 2012: 15 17) who in the 1960s, along with others, challenged the notion of inborn intelligence prevalent up to the 1950s, leading to the still evolving idea that we all can grow in intelligence by improving our cognitive and meta cognitive skills, learning how to learn (Fisher, 2005: 210).

In the second episode of the documentary we hear Raquel Moore say that she will not wear tea towels (Go Back To Where You Came From, 2011, Raquel Moore, Season 1, Ep.2) I feel that this displays a complete and utter lack of respect for the Muslim religion by not even having the decency to call the Tea towels by there proper name of Saris. I found this scene very woeful and bordering on the annoyance. The fact that Raquel doesn t even know the name of the Saris and refers to them as tea towels is disgusting to me. My attitude towards religion is that everyone is entitled to believe what they want and we should have the decency to understand why someone believes what they do and not segregate them from society just because we don t believe in the same ...
