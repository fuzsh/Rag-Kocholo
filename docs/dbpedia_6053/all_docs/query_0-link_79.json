        "text": "ABC is ready to tell best-selling author Ken Follett‘s Century Trilogy.\n\nThe network is developing Fall of Giants, a sweeping 10-hour limited series based on the trilogy comprising New York Times best-sellers Fall of Giants, Winter of the World and Edge of Eternity, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nAnn Peacock (The Dovekeepers, Chronicles of Narnia) is on board to pen the script and exec produce the project from Sony Pictures Television. Should Giants perform well, the second and third books in the trilogy could be the basis for two more 10-hour event series or a continuing hourlong scripted series.\n\nRead more Hollywood’s 25 Most Powerful Authors\n\nGiants is a dramatic tale of love and war told through the lives of five families that become entangled by the first World War. An earl falls for a coal miner’s daughter, a British heiress for a German spy and a young American on the fast track to the White House falls for a Russian bootleggers’s daughter. Set against the backdrop of a catastrophic war, Follett’s characters rise to the challenge of new realities of social class, gender equality and economic collapse — and every one of them is irrevocably changed by it.\n\nMichael De Luca (Fifty Shades of Grey, The Social Network) is on board to executive produce Giants alongside Stephanie Germain (The Day After Tomorrow, Lifetime’s Nora Roberts movies).\n\nPeacock recently wrapped production on CBS’ forthcoming adaptation of Alice Hoffman‘s The Dovekeepers, which she wrote for Mark Burnett and Roma Downey. That miniseries marked Peacock’s return to her TV roots after she penned HBO’s adaptation of A Lesson Before Dying, which won a miniseries or movie writing Emmy. She is repped by CAA, Principato-Young and attorney Don Steele.\n\nFor Follett, the Century Trilogy started in 2010 with Giants, followed by World in 2012 and Eternity in September 2014. The first two installments have sold more than 12 million copies worldwide. His previous works, The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, were adapted at Starz and Reelz, respectively. His novels have sold more than 150 million copies worldwide. He’s repped by CAA.\n\nGermain and De Luca are also repped by CAA."
