        "text": "The Logica Hamburgensis (1638) of Joachim Jung (also called Jungius or Junge) was one replacement for the “Protestant” logic of Melanchthon. Its chief virtue was the care with which late medieval theories and techniques were gathered and presented. Jung devoted considerable attention to valid arguments that do not fit into simpler, standard conceptions of the syllogism and immediate inference. Of special interest is his treatment of quantified relational arguments, then called “oblique” syllogisms because of the oblique (non-nominative) case that is used to express them in Latin. An example is: “The square of an even number is even; 6 is even; therefore, the square of 6 is even.” The technique of dealing with such inferences involved rewriting a premise so that the term in the oblique case (for example, “of an even number”) would occur in the subject position and thus be amenable to standard syllogistic manipulation. Such arguments had in fact been noticed by Aristotle and were also treated in late medieval logic.\n\nAn especially widely used text of the 17th century is usually termed simply the Port-Royal Logic after the seat of the anticlerical Jansenist movement outside Paris. It was written by Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, possibly with others, and was published in French in 1662 with the title La Logique ou l’art de penser “Logic or the Art of Thinking”. It was promptly translated into Latin and English and underwent many reprintings in the late 17th and 18th centuries. In its outline, it followed Ramus’ outline of concept, judgment, argument, and method; it also briefly mentioned oblique syllogisms. The Port-Royal Logic followed the general Reform program of simplifying syllogistic theory, reducing the number of syllogistic figures from four, and minimizing distinctions thought to be useless. In addition, the work contained an important contribution to semantics in the form of the distinction between comprehension and extension. Although medieval semantic theory had used similar notions, the Port-Royal notions found their way into numerous 18th- and 19th-century discussions of the meanings and reference of terms; they appeared, for example, in John Stuart Mill’s influential text A System of Logic (1843). The “comprehension” of a term consisted of all the essential attributes in it (those that cannot be removed without “destroying” the concept), and the extension consisted of all those objects to which the concept applies. Thus the comprehension of the term “triangle” might include the attributes of being a polygon, three-sided, three-angled, and so on. Its extension would include all kinds of triangles. The Port-Royal Logic also contained an influential discussion of definitions that was inspired by the work of the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal. According to this discussion, some terms could not be defined (“primitive” terms), and definitions were divided between nominal and real ones. Real definitions were descriptive and stated the essential properties in a concept, while nominal definitions were creative and stipulated the conventions by which a linguistic term was to be used.\n\nDiscussions of “nominal” and “real” definitions go back at least to the nominalist/realist debates of the 14th century; Pascal’s application of the distinction is interesting for the emphasis that it laid on mathematical definitions being nominal and on the usefulness of nominal definitions. Although the Port-Royal logic itself contained no symbolism, the philosophical foundation for using symbols by nominal definitions was nevertheless laid.\n\nOne intriguing 17th-century treatment of logic in terms of demonstrations, postulates, and definitions in a Euclidean fashion occurs in the otherwise quite traditional Logica Demonstrativa (1697; “Demonstrative Logic”) of the Italian Jesuit Gerolamo Saccheri. Saccheri is better known for his suggestion of the possibility of a non-Euclidean geometry in Euclides ab Omni Naevo Vindicatus (1733; “Euclid Cleared of Every Flaw”). Another incisive traditional logic was that of the Dutch philosopher Arnold Geulincx, Logica fundamentis suis restituta (1662; “Logic Restored to its Fundamentals”). This work attempted to resurrect the rich detail of scholastic logic, including the theory of suppositio and issues of existential import.\n\nLeibniz\n\nWith the logical work of the German mathematician, philosopher, and diplomat Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, we encounter one of the great triumphs, and tragedies, in the history of logic. He created in the 1680s a symbolic logic (see illustration) that is remarkably similar to George Boole’s system of 1847—and Boole is widely regarded as the initiator of mathematical or symbolic logic. But nothing other than vague generalities about Leibniz’ goals for logic was published until 1903—well after symbolic logic was in full blossom. Thus one could say that, great though Leibniz’ discoveries were, they were virtually without influence in the history of logic. (There remains some slight possibility that Lambert or Boole may have been directly or indirectly influenced by Leibniz’ logical system.)\n\nLeibniz’ logical research was not entirely symbolic, however, nor was he without influence in the history of (nonsymbolic) logic. Early in his life, Leibniz was strongly interested in the program of Lull, and he wrote the De arte combinatoria (1666); this work followed the general Lullian goal of discovering truths by combining concepts into judgments in exhaustive ways and then methodically assessing their truth. Leibniz later developed a goal of devising what he called a “universally characteristic language” (lingua characteristica universalis) that would, first, notationally represent concepts by displaying the more basic concepts of which they were composed, and second, naturally represent (in the manner of graphs or pictures, “iconically”) the concept in a way that could be easily grasped by readers, no matter what their native tongue. Leibniz studied and was impressed by the method of the Egyptians and Chinese in using picturelike expressions for concepts. The goal of a universal language had already been suggested by Descartes for mathematics as a “universal mathematics”; it had also been discussed extensively by the English philologist George Dalgarno (c. 1626–87) and, for mathematical language and communication, by the French algebraist François Viète (1540–1603). The search for a universal language to replace Latin was seriously taken up again in the late 19th century, first by Giuseppe Peano—whose work on Interlingua, an uninflected form of Latin, was directly inspired by Leibniz’ conception—and then with Esperanto. The goal of a logical language also inspired Gottlob Frege, and in the 20th century it prompted the development of the logical language LOGLAN and the computer language PROLOG.\n\nAnother and distinct goal Leibniz proposed for logic was a “calculus of reason” (calculus ratiocinator). This would naturally first require a symbolism but would then involve explicit manipulations of the symbols according to established rules by which either new truths could be discovered or proposed conclusions could be checked to see if they could indeed be derived from the premises. Reasoning could then take place in the way large sums are done—that is, mechanically or algorithmically—and thus not be subject to individual mistakes and failures of ingenuity. Such derivations could be checked by others or performed by machines, a possibility that Leibniz seriously contemplated. Leibniz’ suggestion that machines could be constructed to draw valid inferences or to check the deductions of others was followed up by Charles Babbage, William Stanley Jevons, and Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Allan Marquand in the 19th century, and with wide success on modern computers after World War II.\n\nThe symbolic calculus that Leibniz devised seems to have been more of a calculus of reason than a “characteristic” language. It was motivated by his view that most concepts were “composite”: they were collections or conjunctions of other more basic concepts. Symbols (letters, lines, or circles) were then used to stand for concepts and their relationships. This resulted in what is called an “intensional” rather than an “extensional” logic—one whose terms stand for properties or concepts rather than for the things having these properties. Leibniz’ basic notion of the truth of a judgment was that the concepts making up the predicate were “included in” the concept of the subject. What Leibniz symbolized as “A ∞ Β,” or what we might write as “A = B” was that all the concepts making up concept A also are contained in concept B, and vice versa.\n\nLeibniz used two further notions to expand the basic logical calculus. In his notation, “A ⊕ B ∞ C” indicates that the concepts in A and those in B wholly constitute those in C. We might write this as “A + B = C” or “A ∪ B = C”—if we keep in mind that A, B, and C stand for concepts or properties, not for individual things. Leibniz also used the juxtaposition of terms in the following way: “AB ∞ C,” which we might write as “A × B = C” or “A ∩ B = C,” signifies in his system that all the concepts in both A and B wholly constitute the concept C.\n\nA universal affirmative judgment, such as “All A’s are B’s,” becomes in Leibniz’ notation “A ∞ AB.” This equation states that the concepts included in the concepts of both A and B are the same as those in A. A syllogism, “All A’s are B’s; all B’s are C’s; therefore all A’s are C’s,” becomes the sequence of equations “A = AB; B =BC; therefore A =AC.” This conclusion can be derived from the premises by two simple algebraic substitutions and the associativity of logical multiplication. Leibniz’ interpretation of particular and negative statements was more problematic. Although he later seemed to prefer an algebraic, equational symbolic logic, he experimented with many alternative techniques, including graphs.\n\nAs with many early symbolic logics, including many developed in the 19th century, Leibniz’ system had difficulties with particular and negative statements, and it included little discussion of propositional logic and no formal treatment of quantified relational statements. (Leibniz later became keenly aware of the importance of relations and relational inferences.) Although Leibniz might seem to deserve to be credited with great originality in his symbolic logic—especially in his equational, algebraic logic—it turns out that such insights were relatively common to mathematicians of the 17th and 18th centuries who had a knowledge of traditional syllogistic logic. In 1685 Jakob Bernoulli published a pamphlet on the parallels of logic and algebra and gave some algebraic renderings of categorical statements. Later the symbolic work of Lambert, Ploucquet, Euler, and even Boole—all apparently uninfluenced by Leibniz’ or even Bernoulli’s work—seems to show the extent to which these ideas were apparent to the best mathematical minds of the day."
