        "text": "A conjecture is an opinion or conclusion on the basis of incomplete information, for which no proof has been found yet. Let’s begin with the conjecture that God does exist. Blaise Pascal, 17th century French mathematician and inventor had an argument in apologetic philosophy called Pascal’s Wager. The argument basically states that it is in one’s own best interest to behave as if God exists, since the possibility of eternal punishment in hell outweighs any advantage in believing otherwise. Let me illustrate what he meant:\n\nfig 1. Pascal's Wager\n\nOf course, this doesn’t prove anything but any smart person who knows how to bet, would place his bet on God’s existence because it certainly improves his odds in afterlife if such a thing were to exist. Much like God’s existence, afterlife is also a very debatable topic.\n\nAlmost every religion has its own version of ethics or codes to govern life of its followers but afterlife/reincarnation appears to be a common theme among them and the belief that one’s status in afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life. Blaise Pascal it would seem was a religious man who at least did not question afterlife as anyone else who doesn’t question the existence of soul.\n\nMost of us imbibe culture and religion and other ideas associated with them because we are born into it and our parents, as did their parents, induct us into the fold. It is hard to question such beliefs when they are at the very core of our identity. God and religion have played pivotal role throughout history across civilizations in fact, there is hardly any evidence of an atheist civilization. I am of the opinion that with the advent of civilization and most of basic needs being met; the void of self-actualization needs was aptly filled by the theory of God, religion and soul.\n\nfig 2. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\n\nOntological arguments are arguments from nothing but analytic, a priori and necessary premises to the conclusion that God exists. The first, and best-known, ontological argument was proposed by St. Anselm of Canterbury in the 11th century followed by many thought leaders but the most notable among them are René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Kurt Gödel. There is an equally reputable and formidable side comprised of David Hume, Immanuel Kant and David Lewis who object and refute the ontological arguments.\n\nfig 3. Kurt Gödel\n\nKurt Gödel, renowned Austrian mathematician has a tantalizing theory based on principles of modal logic that a higher being must exist. Although the mathematics involved is quite complicated and couldn’t be proved when it was proposed but recent technological advancements have indeed proved the theory to be correct in 2013. The theory essentially proves that, God is that for which no greater can be conceived. And while God exists in the understanding of the concept, we could conceive of him as greater if he existed in reality. Therefore, he must exist.\n\nGödel’s ontological argument is a Gödelian knot! It is equivalent of saying that Vampire is that for which no greater blood sucking undead can be conceived. And while Vampire exists in the understanding of the concept, we could conceive of him as greater if he existed in reality. Therefore, he must exist.\n\nNeurotheology, also known as spiritual neuroscience, attempts to explain religious experience and behaviour in neuroscientific terms. Julius Caesar, a Roman statesman and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, a Russian novelist, the only commonality between these two great historical figures is that they suffered from fits. Many in ancient Rome believed the seizures and fits caused by epilepsy to be a sign of divine possession, and it was often associated with the powerful. Julius Caesar had a flair for theatricality and used the rabbles gullibility, to enhance his power and influence by using the fits to his advantage. Fyodor Dostoyevsky on the other hand staunchly believed that his experience during his temporal lobe epileptic seizures was a metanoia and a transcendental experience. I would like to quote one of his experiences as described by him:\n\n“The air was filled with a big noise and I tried to move. I felt the heaven was going down upon the earth and that it engulfed me. I have really touched God. He came into me myself, yes God exists, I cried, and I don’t remember anything else. You all, healthy people … can’t imagine the happiness which we epileptics feel during the second before our fit. … I don’t know if this felicity lasts for seconds, hours or months, but believe me, for all the joys that life may bring, I would not exchange this one.”\n\nfig 4. Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\nOliver Sacks, a professor of neurology at NYU school of medicine published an article in The Atlantic. I quote him here:\n\n“Ecstatic seizures are rare — they only occur in something like 1 or 2 percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. But the last half century has seen an enormous increase in the prevalence of other states sometimes permeated by religious joy and awe, “heavenly” visions and voices, and, not infrequently, religious conversion or metanoia. Among these are out-of-body experiences (OBEs), which are more common now that more patients can be brought back to life from serious cardiac arrests and the like — and much more elaborate and numinous experiences called near-death experiences (NDEs).”\n\nfig 5. Out of Body Experience\n\n“Both OBEs and NDEs, which occur in waking but often profoundly altered states of consciousness, cause hallucinations so vivid and compelling that those who experience them may deny the term hallucination, and insist on their reality. And the fact that there are marked similarities in individual descriptions is taken by some to indicate their objective “reality”.”\n\nfig 6. Near Death Experience - Tunnel Vision\n\nWhen logic, reason, mathematics, science and neurology fail to prove God’s existence and yet we have the overwhelming feeling, yearning, and innate desire to believe in someone or something greater than us. May be we could go with the feeling and not deny ourselves the experiences, which can make us stronger. Or May be we can stop to question ourselves that just like we have gone on believing others ideas, concepts, beliefs and hell even facts, and led ourselves on the path to emulation of others dreams, goals, and aspirations, could it be that we have stopped choosing ourselves. Why do we need god, religion, afterlife or soul? Choose Yourself, Choose this life! Exist here, Exist Now! Don’t look beyond, look within, be your own god!"
