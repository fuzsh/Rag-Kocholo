        "text": "Blaise Pascal’s Pensées is a book like many others from the Western canon: many of us are aware of its existence, roughly in the same way as we are aware of the existence of Tolstoy’s War and Peace, and yet almost none of us have read the Pensées — though we might have a sense that it is the kind of book that ought to be read, if only we had the time. After all, Pascal is also the author of the Provincial Letters (another book few of us have read), a satirical attack on the Jesuits and, so we have been told, a celebrated landmark in French prose.\n\nSome of us may also know that Pascal intended the Pensées to initiate a transformation in the lives of his readers, and that he urges us to recover the dignity of our being, rejecting whatever diverts us from our self-cultivation. It is a book, by all accounts, of immense affective power. Why would one not read such a book?\n\nThis sense of the potency of the Pensées is correct, as far as it goes, but it is for just this reason that you should consider carefully whether you should read Pascal’s book in the first place. Of Montaigne’s Essais, for instance, Pascal wrote: “It is not in Montaigne but in myself that I find everything I see there.” This must be taken as a warning. Pascal would have the Pensées be for us what Montaigne’s Essais were for Pascal himself: a lens through which to see ourselves with shocking clarity.\n\nThe transformation Pascal intends is indeed a positive one, so far as Pascal is concerned, but it is to be achieved — or at least begun — by confronting us with the problem of our existence. We are to see ourselves in all our indigence, gaining a lucid awareness of the nature of our predicament. “Imagine a number of men in chains”, he writes, “all sentenced to death, some of whom are each day butchered in the sight of the others. Those remaining see their own condition in that of their fellows, and looking at each other with grief and without hope, await their turn.”\n\nThese condemned men cannot look away from the horror of their predicament. They are forced to see, and this unbroken and unmitigated awareness drives them to despair. Yet it is these very conditions that Pascal insists his reader must have the courage to confront — and a central theme of the Pensées is Pascal’s revulsion at the fact that so few people ever do so. “I do not know who put me into the world”, he writes, assuming for dramatic effect the voice of such an individual:\n\nnor what the world is, nor what I am myself. I am terribly ignorant about everything. I do not know what my body is, or my senses, or my soul, or even that part of me which thinks what I am saying, which reflects about everything and about itself, and does not know itself any better than it knows anything else. I see the terrifying spaces of the universe hemming me in, and I find myself attached to one corner of this vast expanse without knowing why I have been put in this place rather than that, or why the brief span of life allotted to me should be assigned to one moment rather than another of all the eternity which went before me and all that which will come after me. I see only infinity on every side, hemming me in like an atom or like the shadow of a fleeting instant. All I know is that I must soon die, but what I know least about is this very death which I cannot evade.\n\nTo Pascal’s astonishment, this individual responds to his situation with indifference:\n\nSuch is my state, full of weakness and uncertainty. And my conclusion from all this is that I must pass my days without a thought of seeking what is to happen to me. Perhaps I might find some enlightenment in my doubts, but I do not want to take the trouble.\n\nDropping the persona, Pascal remarks: “Who would wish to have as his friend a man who argued like that? Who would resort to him in adversity? To what use in life could he possibly be turned?” Indeed. Still, the question remains: what possible benefit could be had from dwelling on the painful conditions of our existence? If Pascal’s image of despairing, condemned men is to be taken seriously, urging us to cultivate a similar kind of existential insomnia seems almost malicious.\n\nThis view would be understandable, but it rests on a misread. While a brutal honesty animates the Pensées, there is no malice here. To the contrary, what their reader encounters is a deep truth about the profit to be found in suffering — albeit, a truth that is framed according to Pascal’s particular religious commitments. At bottom, he believes we each must confront the problem of our existence in order to discover the Fall as the reason for our suffering, and Christ as the only solution to our woe.\n\nYet it is for just this reason that the Pensées are not aimed at Christians at all, but at the non-religious among us who are hungry for meaning and purpose in a world that seems to offer no acceptable form of either. Pascal is convinced that our everyday practice of being human is simultaneously an expression of the universal crisis of our being and the principal way in which we remain imprisoned within the problem of ourselves. We compound our difficulties through our conduct.\n\nIn this condition we are blind not only to our strengths but also, importantly, to the essential relation between pain and greatness. Pascal insists that to know this aspect of ourselves, Christ is not required. The agenda is bleakly severe, but also philanthropic: while the majority of his readers will remain forever beyond the reach of grace, nonetheless we can all be more noble, dignified, self-respecting beings, and we can achieve this without God. “One must know oneself”, Pascal writes. “If that does not help in finding truth, at least it helps in ordering one’s life. Nothing is more proper.”\n\nOne thing is certain, however: this new practice of living will hurt. Such an alteration of our knowledge of ourselves, and how we live, is only possible on the basis of a new relationship to suffering.\n\nSuffering, endurance, existence: Pascal and Nietzsche\n\nThis relationship to suffering is illuminated with a particular force and relevance by the work of Friedrich Nietzsche. This may come as a surprise; after all, isn’t Nietzsche the mocking, self-styled “anti-Christian” — arguably the most potent adversary of Christianity ever to have lived? Again, this is true, but superficial. Nietzsche loved Pascal. He read and reflected on him throughout his intellectual career; references to Pascal in his notebooks far outnumber those which appear in his published works. In his final books, Nietzsche attacked Pascal with the complex ferocity and passion of a lover.\n\nIn fact, Nietzsche’s relationship to Christianity is far more intimate, subtle, and indeed dependant, than almost all casual readers of his works ever appreciate. And when it comes to Pascal — himself a difficult kind of Christian — Nietzsche is as illuminating in his agreement with the Frenchman as he is in his uncompromising divergence from him. Nietzsche’s view of the value of our experience of suffering is a clear demonstration of his complex relation to Pascal. Certain excerpts from his writings are instructive in this regard.\n\nConsider, first, section 338 of The Gay Science, in which Nietzsche questions the value of compassion. Is it good for those who suffer, he asks, always to receive compassion from others? That such a question is striking only confirms our culture’s strong positive valuation of sympathy. Nietzsche knew very well, from personal experience, that through the multiple ways it afflicts us, life continually presents us with opportunities to indulge ourselves with the compassion of others. Yet to do so, he maintains, is both objectionable and dangerous.\n\nIt is objectionable in many ways. The compassionate person has the temerity to believe he knows from what I suffer, as if the deepest things which pain me, of which I myself am barely aware, were in fact transparent to him and so generic as to be immediately explicable. To this arrogant and offensive assumption must be added the implication, contained in the compassionate person’s rush to console me, that I need and want such consolation, that I am so cowed by my suffering, and weak in my will, that above all I wish for help from others in taking away my pain. “Our ‘benefactors’”, Nietzsche cautions, “diminish our worth and our will more than our enemies do.” All of which leads to the danger of the surrender to compassion — doing so allows us to escape the difficult personal profit to be drawn from the endurance of suffering:\n\nThe entire economy of my soul and the balance effected by “misfortune,” the breaking open of new springs and needs, the healing of old wounds, the shedding of entire periods of the past — all such things that can be involved in misfortune do not concern the dear compassionate one: they want to ‘help’ and have no thought that there is a personal necessity of misfortune; that terrors, deprivations, impoverishments, midnights, adventures, risks, and blunders are as necessary for me and you as their opposites; indeed, to express myself mystically, that the path to one’s own heaven always leads through the voluptuousness of one’s own hell.\n\nWhereas our everyday understanding of happiness is an ornamental and insipid conception, for which pain is something objectionable and inconvenient, to be gotten rid of as swiftly as possible, for both Nietzsche and Pascal a life without suffering would be a benighted form of existence.\n\nWhile it is a difficult truth, both men understand suffering to disclose the deep nature of existence, and the joyousness each nests at the centre of his thought is bound up with the exploration of this depth. In Pascal’s case, no document is more revealing of this relation than his Prayer to ask of God the proper use of illnesses, in which Pascal offers Christ his own terribly disabled body as a site for His on-going, salvific Passion (“Enter into my heart and soul, to bear in them my sufferings, and to continue to endure in me what remains to You to suffer of Your passion …”). The same idea appears in another text, usually included in the Pensées, known as “The Mystery of Jesus”: “I must add my wounds to his, and join myself to him, and he will save me in saving himself.” In each case, the point is clear: feelings of happiness are only of relevance when they lead up to and away from such moments of joy.\n\nThe obvious problem with this view is that most people would rather feel happiness without pain. Most of us have no interest in deriving profit from our misery; we simply want suffering to stop. At the start of his career, for example, Nietzsche notes both the disclosive capacity of pain and the reflex to turn away from what pain makes visible:\n\nEvery moment of life wants to tell us something, but we do not want to hear what it has to say … The human being evades suffering as best he can, but even more so he evades the meaning of endured suffering … he is evading the profound eye that looks at him questioningly from amid his suffering, as if it wanted to say: “Hasn’t it been made easier for you to comprehend existence?”\n\nWith some justification, those who flee from a clear-sighted endurance of their suffering are evading the insight into what Nietzsche calls “the natural, evil character of things” that endurance brings. Yet, however understandable such evasion is, our existence remains inescapably problematic, making any insight into the nature of that problem advantageous — at least in principle. Both men agree that we would have the opportunity to reap the benefits of what these experiences show us, if only we have the courage to approach them in this way.\n\nTransfiguring suffering\n\nThese observations must be considered alongside some key moments from elsewhere in Nietzsche’s writings. These moments concern the role of the human will in the task of the transfiguration of pain into joy. They thereby provide an instructive contrast with Pascal and the project of the Pensées.\n\nThe first such moment appears in a letter from 1882, in which Nietzsche details his misery to his close friend Franz Overbeck. That summer, after years of self-imposed solitude, Nietzsche had fallen in love with Lou von Salomé, a brilliant young Russian woman, whose remarkable life would, in later years, see her train as a psychoanalyst under Sigmund Freud, and be the muse and lover of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Nietzsche met Salomé first in Rome, in Spring of 1882, having been summoned to the city by their mutual friend, Paul Rée, himself smitten. Nietzsche quickly became infatuated.\n\nRefusing to engage in anything but an intellectual intimacy, Salomé enthusiastically agreed to an idea that, for the time, was outrageous: she would be part of an intimate, cohabiting, intellectual study group, a “Trinity” comprising herself, Rée and Nietzsche. The idea burned bright for a time, but by the close of the year all was lost: the plan was abandoned, the friendships disintegrated, and Nietzsche’s hopes lay in ruins. He fell into despair. “This last morsel of life was the hardest I have yet had to chew”, he wrote in his letter of 25 December 1882, “and it is still possible that I shall choke on it.”\n\nNietzsche’s correspondence from this period contains a number of references to his being overwhelmed by suffering, and this letter is no exception. “I have suffered from the humiliating and tormenting memories of this summer as from a bout of madness.” He was, he said, attempting to manage the tension:\n\nbetween opposing passions which I cannot cope with. I am exerting every ounce of my self-mastery, but I have lived in solitude too long and fed too long off my own fat, so that I am now being broken, as no other man could be, on the wheel of my own passions. If only I could sleep! But the strongest doses of my sedative help me as little as my six to eight hours of daily walking.\n\nThen, the crucial sentence: “Unless I discover the alchemical trick of turning this filth into gold, I am lost.”\n\nThe “alchemy” to which Nietzsche refers is one of the most valuable and mysterious aspects of human life. It is the essential activity of philosophy — on Nietzsche’s formulation — and its value for human existence generally is immeasurable. “There is a need for those who will sanctify all activities”, he notes to himself, “not only eating and drinking: and not merely in remembrance of them and to become one with them, but this world must be transfigured ever anew and in new ways.”\n\nWhile Nietzsche here places emphasis on the transfiguring activity of individuals, this activity should be set within the context of that scale of experiences in life which, in their own way, and not always due to the intentional activity of the individual, serve to rescue us from the slide that ends in despair. In fact, it tends to be the small, fleeting moments that do so most often: lunch by the water; music in the street; brake lights in the rain.\n\nBut to return to Nietzsche’s focus, at its furthest reach this scale sees a few of us fulfil the role of alchemist, transforming the basest elements of our experiences into “gold”, transfiguring our deepest pain into a peculiar joyousness. That this joy may be soaked with tears is, to be clear, no argument against it. The “alchemical tricks” to which Nietzsche refers reveal the inseparable intermarriage between our affirmation of, and despair at, our existence. And it is precisely here, in terms of this strange, alchemical aspect of existence — the nature of the affirmation and transfiguration of our experience of life — that we reach the deepest point at which Nietzsche and Pascal both meet and diverge from one another.\n\nWhen it comes to an understanding of transfiguration, however, language and reality tend to miss each other. Although “transfiguration” names the primary means by which life may be experienced as worthwhile — and despite such experiences including both an infinite number of everyday events, as well as remarkable, life reorienting ones — the word feels awkward and obscure. Outside of artistic and religious circles, it is rarely used at all. In part, this is likely a consequence of its most prominent example: the Transfiguration of Christ.\n\nThis event is one the strangest in the New Testament. Immediately prior to His down-going into betrayal, torture and execution, Christ ascends a mountain with three disciples. At the summit, while praying, he is transfigured, erupting into supernatural, dazzling light (see Matthew 17:2, Mark 9:3, Luke 9:29). While interpretations of this event vary, a common view is that this is a theophany, a scintillating manifestation of divinity, with the three disciples being allowed to glimpse that Glory which was both eternally Christ’s, and his to enter into by his Passion. Accordingly, the Transfiguration heralds both the horror of Christ’s torture and execution, the cry of desolation from the Cross, and the festive joy of the good news, his redemptive suffering and victory over death.\n\nIn short, this strange episode encapsulates and presents the triumphant alchemical labour of Christ — he who, in his coming, living, suffering, dying, and rising, supplies the chief negatives of human life with what is supposed to be their ultimate and eternal positive meaning and purpose. The light which emanates from him unveils both the life-long work of the transformation of believers (for whom pain and joy are very much interwoven experiences), and the heavenly result of such work, glimpsed on the mountain in his body of glory.\n\nThe broader point is that this activity — by which, according to Christians, the problem of existence is transfigured into eternal praise and thanksgiving — is not exclusively Christian at all. In fact, while their interpretations of it differ according to their points of view, neither Pascal nor Nietzsche say anything truly new when they each write of experiences of transfiguration. What both men know is a deep, species-wide secret, a secret that allows human life to be beautiful and not merely ornamental. It is an open secret among artists, and a secret the religious often burn to bring others into communion with. It is a secret most of us know, yet usually do not know that we know.\n\nFirst, in suffering — in all periods lost to blacknesses of depression, in despair, in grief, in periods of illness — there is opened to the sufferer a knowledge of self and world that is invisible and inaccessible to the “healthy”. These insights are the richest curricula available to the human race. The depth of existence exposed by suffering may prove to be intensely positively meaningful; at any event, eventually positive or not, through them we learn, and not only “negative” things. For example (as I shall come to later on), it is only by means of his reorientation to the problem of existence that Pascal’s reader can discover the nobility and strength of endurance that was always already his to live and wield.\n\nSecond, experiences of suffering assail the will, beat it back; at times, we can be reduced to an overwhelmed immobility by our experiences. Of course, some experiences simply go too far, breaking something in us too deep and too vital to repair. Sooner or later, these wounds are fatal. Yet, if we are not broken in this way — and usually, we are not — then our suffering calls forth, or at the very least, cries out for, a response from the will.\n\nAnd this is the nub. For both Pascal and Nietzsche, the transfiguration and affirmation of life sits within a constellation of other cardinal human experiences, such as pain, despair, endurance and a sense of one’s dignity. The difference between the two is that, for Nietzsche, however hard it is to achieve, the transfiguration of suffering into joy is, in principle, a fundamental human possibility. We are capable of it. For Pascal, such transfiguration is possible for us only with God’s assistance — and in practice, according to Pascal, almost no one is gifted by God in this way.\n\nFor all Pascal’s insight into human conduct, and despite his genuinely philanthropic motives, it is in the light of this difference that all potential readers of the Pensées must make their decision.\n\nLove’s enthusiasm\n\nA year or so ago, I awoke with the tip of my tongue clenched between my teeth. As I moved to full wakefulness, I recall experiencing a feeling of sympathy that such a thing could have happened, as if those teeth and that tongue, that queer, intimate pinioning, a tell for emotions of great sadness, were not mine at all. And then, of course, I knew they were mine. And it felt like a betrayal.\n\nMany of us are lonely, even in company. Our awareness of our predicament is sharp and almost constant. Often, as we push our children on swings or watch them in swimming pools, we look about at our fellows and wonder whether they, like us, ever feel helpless before the conditions of their lives. We wonder whether they, too, feel oppressed by biology and history, circumscribed like an animal in a cage. We wonder what we would do, were we ever to find someone whose feelings matched our own. How it might feel, no longer to have to carry our pain as an unrecognised burden. What life might be like, if we could but find, in the brutal ordinariness of things, someone to see us, regardless of whether or not we had the courage to speak.\n\nThe world is devoid of magical breaches. Water always suffocates. The dead do not rise. The moon cannot be split. Claims to the contrary do not survive long against the weight of the everyday. Yet once or twice in a lifetime, the ordinary gifts us someone to fall in love with. Perhaps it is for this reason that we cannot but feel reverence when such people sit quietly beside us. Our loved ones break the regularity of the world. They are special. They do not belong to the ordinary, and we are desperate to protect them from it. When we are with them, we too may break free. With them, we feel alive. If we find they love us back, we are transformed.\n\nLove is the principal transfiguration of human existence, a fact which explains the despair we feel when love dies, or fails to arrive. Or leaves. Love is also an enthusiasm, taking that word in its ancient sense — namely, as an en-theos, as the presence of the god inside. We revere our lovers because they bring on the god, that deep, universal, radically non-denominational deity, the god who re-weaves the world so its pieces rapture us even as they cut. Those who find laughable, or inexplicable, the belief in the Word made flesh, the idea that divinity occupied the human fabric, dwelling among us as a fellow, should recall, or seek, the entheos of love. One should do so, not to become a Christian, but to come alive through contact with the god — and perhaps thereafter, to appreciate with greater care the passion of the Christian.\n\nLate in November 1654, Pascal finally found his someone, the one to see him, in and with whom he could be consoled, refreshed, and joyously transformed. His someone was God, in Christ Jesus.\n\nPascal was born in 1623, in Clermont-Ferrand, France. He died in Paris, in 1662, aged 39. His luminous intelligence was clear from an early age. In his twenties he developed into one of Europe’s finest intellectuals. His mathematical work influenced the development of infinitesimal calculus; his study of fluids, vacuum and pressure, was ground-breaking; he made his major contribution to geometry, known today as Pascal’s theorem, at age 16.\n\nYet by 1654, he was struggling with a deep and growing disillusionment. To him, his work seemed trivial when compared to the problem of the tragic conditions of human existence, conditions which his chronic ill-health forced him to experience with a dreadful persistence and acuity. He became increasingly occupied, indeed obsessed, by the weight of life’s pain, brevity, and confusion. His loneliness was existential and pervasive.\n\nHis younger sister, Jacqueline, had allied herself with the so-called Jansenist group of Christians, a small but intellectually and spiritually forbidding sect. Their moniker was a reference to the theologian Cornelius Jansen, whose frighteningly severe Augustinianism was their main theological inspiration. For the Jansenists, our total depravity merited only damnation; a tiny minority of us were predestined to salvation, albeit by means of a gift of grace which, quite justly, could be withdrawn at any moment. It was to this worldview that Pascal himself would become attached.\n\nAt first, and as far as it was possible for him to do so, Pascal began to reveal his misery to Jacqueline. He met others in the sect. Eventually, the dam broke. For two hours, on the evening of 23 November 1654, he underwent an experience whose detail is lost to history, but whose scribbled outline, a text known today as the Mémorial, he would carry on his person for the rest of his life. He had found a way to feel thanksgiving in pain. The discovery demolished the man he had been; in its place, something new began to grow. “Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy”, he wrote.\n\nTears indeed, for such is the nature of transfiguration: joy, alloyed with grief; grief, tempered with gold. Eucharistic screams. Sadly, such a thing is not always possible; that it is possible at all is — together with the everyday distraction that is its deformed sibling — the chief salvation of our species. “I have cut myself off from him. Let me never be cut off from him!” Pascal’s life was transfigured, a reorientation that would last until his death. God was with him, in him. He had found “Him”, and had awoken to the astonishing knowledge that he had always seen, and waited, on him. The presence of divine love eclipsed all else: that such a love might be bestowed upon so sinful a creature as he! From now on, he would never be entirely his own burden; there would always be God. The following month, Jacqueline wrote to their eldest sibling, Gilberte, describing the transformation at work in Pascal. “It seems clear”, she wrote, “that it is no longer his natural spirit that acts in him.”\n\nFrom this point, Pascal would repeat the standard Christian advice that one should take great pains to love only the “proper” object of human love — namely, God alone. It is his tragedy, however, that he was as much a victim of his chosen object of love as are the rest of us. I shall return to this.\n\nThe human monster: Pascal’s anthropology\n\nFor years, Pascal’s health had been precarious at best. Begun in this post-conversion phase, eventually illness would force a stop to work on the Pensées, leaving them forever fragmentary. Yet he knew the excellence of which we are capable, and the violence of his condemnation of human indolence and existential indifference is a measure of his frustration at our self-neglect.\n\nMore, and importantly, while his experience of social life in Paris as a young man of means had left him nauseated, he had watched his fellows very closely. “One must have deeper motives and judge everything accordingly”, he wrote, “yet go on talking like everyone else.” He had learned.\n\nIt is the anthropology of the Pensées that is so disturbing; Pascal’s depiction of what it is to be human connects us to him with shocking immediacy. At times, his reader experiences a strange intimacy with the voice of the text, a kind of co-presence with Pascal’s secret, recessed, clinical, penetrating psychological vision. In these moments, we are inside with him. We look out with him through his surface, to see the surfaces he sees. He saw a lifelong emergency perpetually at work inside each human being, emergencies each person studiously refuses to acknowledge, however much their behaviour discloses their pain.\n\nWhat, then, do we see? We see a monster, against whom Pascal launches one of the fiercest attacks in the Western canon. It is an attack designed to force us to do what we least wish to do. “If he exalts himself, I humble him. If he humbles himself, I exalt him. And I continue to contradict him”, he writes, “until he comprehends that he is an incomprehensible monster.” The French word for monster, monstre, is etymologically related to the French verb montrer, which means “to show”. Not only would Pascal show us to ourselves, but, if we learn to look closely, we too can come to see others, and ourselves, as Pascal does: as a living mass of tells.\n\nHe wrote of metropolitan, mid-seventeenth century Paris, yet Pascal’s observations are as relevant to us as anything written today. He notes the “excellent order” of the communities we build, the “admirable rules of policy, morality and justice” that, again and again, enable vast numbers of humans to live in settled proximity to one another. Everything seems to be both in order and part of an order. This is a feat all the more impressive, given the native volatility of the human material marshalled by society.\n\nToday, the energy that pours daily through, beneath and above the streets of every major city is the same energy that drives the tumult of activity, the endless preoccupation with making one’s way, found throughout the Pensées. Pascal writes of dancing, singing, verse and music, theatre and sports, gambling and hunting, of the young with their obsessive thoughts of the future, and the constant thrust of ambition. Today’s global telecommunications systems and transportation routes, the vast sprawl of our cities, and our capacity to entertain ourselves in a seemingly endless number of ways, can be read as merely the contemporary versions of the same remarkable achievement of order and function Pascal saw.\n\nYet these surface things are tells — and as such they disclose. The activity of business is a frenzy, not a hum. The noise of our entertainment is but a means of drowning something in light and sound. We may be charitable and helpful, yet we also serve ourselves by doing so, and behind the smiles and handshakes is a sneer of loathing:\n\nAll men naturally hate one another. We have used concupiscence as best we could to serve the public good. But this is only a pretence and a false image of charity. For at bottom it is only hate.\n\nFor modern readers, Pascal’s depiction of the tragedy of our existence has few more relevant moments than the following:\n\nWe are not satisfied with the life we have in ourselves and our own being. We want to lead an imaginary life in the eyes of others, and so we try to make an impression. We strive constantly to embellish and preserve our imaginary being, and neglect the real one. And if we are calm, or generous, or faithful, we are anxious to have it known so that we can attach these virtues to our other existence; we prefer to detach them from our real self so as to unite them with the other. We would cheerfully be cowards if that would acquire us a reputation for bravery. How clear a sign of the nullity of our own being that we are not satisfied with one without the other, and often exchange one for the other. For anyone who would not die to save his honour would be infamous.\n\nThe content of the Internet shows us an image of ourselves. At the heart of this image are our social media platforms. We are not satisfied with the life we have in ourselves and our own being. We want to lead an imaginary life in the eyes of others, and so we try to make an impression.\n\nFrom the point of view of the Pensées, sites such as Instagram and Facebook emit one long, low, billion-strong moan of pain — a moan that is also a plea: Don’t I matter? Social media, and the multiple structures of media and entertainment which abut and support them, offer small and apparently insignificant beings the opportunity to feel they are the opposite. Beneath the connection and communication done by such sites is a panicked agitation.\n\nOne of the most devastating sentences in all philosophy appears in the Pensées: “I have often said that man’s unhappiness arises from one thing alone: that he cannot remain quietly in his room.” We do not like ourselves. We are allergic to our own presence. We cannot remain quietly in our own rooms. We must get away, go anywhere, do anything, in order not to have to dwell with ourselves, not to see ourselves, not to be caught, to be nailed to the reality of our being.\n\nOne strategy to achieve this is the frenzy of work. Another is the pathetic validation we receive from retweets, comments, shares. The Internet has enabled us as never before to project for ourselves a life beyond ourselves, according to our chosen fabrication; it is part of and augments the wider crafting of our public selves that includes gait, posture, turns of phrase, apparel, accessories. Together, these things allow us both to look away from and palliate ourselves with the idea that we matter. Clearly I do matter. Look at my number of likes. We are so alone. The plea coursing through social media has always existed. It is the human plea. The Internet merely allows for its global publication and, in some cases, also its monetisation.\n\nOur entrenched reflex of psychological evasion, our avoidance of the problem of ourselves, is the principal way in which we remain ignorant of the true dignity and greatness of our being. Whatever your final response to Pascal, there is undeniable truth to this claim. While it is natural to shy away from painful things, to allow oneself continually to have only “positive” experiences keeps one shallow and naïve. To do so chronically leads one into the realm of fantasy. Such evasion is a dangerous temptation: “The only thing that consoles us for our miseries is diversion, and yet it is the greatest of our miseries.”\n\nThere is nothing more understandable than the urge to flee from the difficulty of life, and yet there are few things more contemptuous than the sight of a person, now retired, who has spent their life suffering with their eyes resolutely closed. Such people combine the haplessness of the teenager with the bitterness of the aged dilettante. Such people are only adult in an amateur sense; they are the dabblers of existence, and they are far more numerous in the world than it is comfortable to consider.\n\nDespite all our efforts, there are times when the world hands us back to ourselves. For this, all that is required is an absence of the means of distraction. To be alone in a hotel room, in an unfamiliar city. To have no alcohol, no companion, no Internet connection, a broken television. That is enough:\n\nMan finds nothing so intolerable as to be in a state of complete rest, without passions, without occupation, without diversion, without effort. Then he faces his nullity, isolation, inadequacy, dependence, helplessness, emptiness. And at once there wells up from the depths of his soul boredom, gloom, sadness, grief, spite, despair.\n\nUnder these conditions we become partly revealed to ourselves, in our squalid, pleading, posturing nullity, and the effect is devastating. If your life feels empty, like a part-spiteful dream, the Pensées provide an interpretation of this feeling, and a response. You feel empty because you are. There is an abyss at the heart of each of us. A terrible absence. The absence of God. This absence is so painful we spend our lives trying to avoid confronting it, despite the tragic fact that we will only ever properly understand our desire for love by doing just that. Instead, we blunder through life, seeking relief from our pain but compounding it further. We push food, things, ideas, experiences and people into ourselves, hoping for a definitive satiety, and nothing works. We hold on to an obscure idea of our coming finally to a restful stop in life, yet are unable ever to reach it. “All our life passes in this way”, Pascal writes:\n\nWe seek rest in a struggle against some obstacles. And when we have overcome these, rest proves unbearable because of the boredom it produces. We have to escape from it and beg for excitement.\n\nIt is this perverse emotional-existential wheel of Ixion that Pascal hopes to draw our attention to, and free us from. To follow him here, however, requires not simply an acknowledgement of the portion of life we have hitherto wasted on self-evasion, and not only the courage to discover, on Pascal’s view, the true nature of the nothingness inside ourselves. It requires, further, that we resolve no more to surrender to and act upon the spite that forces its way to the surface of ourselves, once the downward pressure of everyday conformity and evasion is removed. Shut up alone in our rooms, millions of us all too often choose to roam online as a response to the emotional silt kicked up by our isolation. While such roaming is a form of self-evasion, the anonymity of the Internet also ensures that we can interact with our fellows with no need to employ our usual methods of editorial self-control.\n\nWe can revenge our emptiness on others. Again and again, the result is a range of behaviour that extends from acts of casual, cowardly nastiness to the most brutal of physical abuses. “Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks” (Luke 6:45). As true for hate as it is for love.\n\nTransformation without transfiguration?\n\nThe most accurate and profitable way to view Pascal’s Pensées is as a handbook of spiritual exercises. With the term “spiritual” understood broadly, to encompass the totality of the person, such exercises are one of the perennial features of human culture, and their aim is the transformation of those who practice them.\n\nThe work of apology Pascal began but died before he could complete — known today as his Pensées — was intended to penetrate the lives of his readers as thoroughly as Loyola’s Exercitia spiritualia, or Arrian’s Enchiridion of the teachings of Epictetus. The force of Pascal’s text is applied continually to this aim. Just as it points out the power of soiling habits in human life, he would have his text become the focal point of a new set of habits: cleaner, more edifying habits, habits devoted to the reformation of your life, work done in the light of the problem of your existence and your rediscovery of the strength you possess to bear it.\n\nAnd yet, choosing to read Pascal — to read him seriously, in the manner he wishes to be read, to engage with his text as a handbook of spiritual exercises, to allow them to work at your life as intended — to read Pascal in this way, is something far from unproblematic. In the end, there are perhaps two reasons to read him, both of which end in a negative, but valuable, kind of profit. The first reason has already been alluded to: Pascal’s view of our dignity in the absence of God teaches us the value of suffering the problem of our existence with courage and lucidity. Yet it is also this vision of ourselves that exposes the unsurmountable limitation of the Pensées precisely as a set of transformative practices. The second reason we starving ones may have to read the Pensées, therefore, is not to be nourished by them in any satisfactory manner, but to come to know more deeply the nature of our malnourishment.\n\nHe is, then, as much a victim of his object of love as the rest of us. Pascal was in love with the Jansenist version of the Christian God. This commitment required him to observe a fundamental division between the human activity of self-transformation and the divine work of transfiguration. This division, and the view of salvation to which it is tied, is brutal in its simplicity. Nothing solely human leads to salvation; only grace saves, and the list of those to whom grace shall be given is already decided. Only through grace, which brings the one true and abiding transfiguration of life, can the ultimate meaning and purpose of the problem of our existence be reached, yet it is just this transfiguration that is closed off to the merely human work of the Pensées, and their reader.\n\nWhile the aim of Pascal’s text is transformation, it is impossible for transformation to translate, unaided, into transfiguration. God alone transfigures us; any other experience of “transfiguration” is a delusion that must inevitably lead to sin. Perversely then, the one thing Pascal knows his reader needs, which is the very thing he hopes to lead his reader to crave, is the one thing neither party can attain through their own efforts. The final twist to this state of affairs is that, as Pascal sees it, however transformed one may become, still transfiguration may never arrive. Our name may not be on the list of the saved.\n\nThese views result in the bleak, beautiful and hopelessly limited depiction of human nobility in the Pensées. They ensure that Pascal’s efforts ultimately amount to a case study in the bitterest kind of irony.\n\nFirst, his reader’s complacency must be removed: the existential insulation that kept the individual from seeing himself must be torn off. The result is one of the most affecting images in all Western thought:\n\nMan is only a reed, the weakest thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed. The whole universe does not need to take up arms to crush him: a vapour, a drop of water, is enough to kill him. But if the universe were to crush him, man would still be nobler than what killed him, because he knows he is dying and the advantage the universe has over him. The universe knows nothing of this.\n\nAll our dignity consists, then, in thought. Let us labour, then, to think well.\n\nYet the calamity here is that, having stripped his reader of his previous means of coping with life — the distractions of everyday living — Pascal has almost nothing to offer his newly lucid, reed-like human, to protect him from despair. Honesty is dangerous. We need protection from its effects. Pascal’s image of condemned men unable to look away from their fate underlined the hopelessness that awaits all who cannot mitigate their exposure to the horrific nature of our conditions of existence.\n\nThe only insulation Pascal can offer his reader is a vision of himself as a dignified being. We are great not only because we are aware of our indigence, but because we can reason about it. We are thinking reeds. Recovering our greatness demands that we encounter ourselves in this way:\n\nMan’s greatness comes from knowing he is wretched: a tree does not know it is wretched. Thus it is wretched to know that one is wretched, but there is greatness in knowing one is wretched.\n\nYet, this solves almost nothing at all, a failure seen most clearly and pathetically in the practice Pascal calls the “machine.” The machine is the apex exercise of the Pensées. Its activity is simple: the individual who wishes for faith commits to act as if he already possesses it, attending church, reading scripture and so on. This is regarded as more than mere mimicry; the intention is to immerse the individual in practices capable of affecting him below the level of rationality, attuning him to the “Truth” Pascal believes is broadcast to one from every aspect of the life of faith. “The heart has its reasons”, he says famously, “which reason does not know.”\n\nThe problem here is that, presumably, many readers of the Pensées will arrive at the machine having first sought an answer to the problem of their existence outside of Christianity. Terrified by Pascal’s account of our finitude and ignorance, but not immediately convinced that Christ alone is the answer to our plight, the reader is encouraged to seek answers elsewhere.\n\nThis is a gamble: Pascal seems to presume that not only will his particular account of our state hold true through our examination of “philosophers, sceptics and dogmatists”, but that, precisely by “thinking well”, the range of all possible candidates to explain that state will be rejected, driving us, exhausted, back to Christianity: “It is good to be tired and weary from fruitlessly seeking the true good, so that one can stretch out one’s arms to the Redeemer.”\n\nBut Pascal overlooks what must surely be the transformative effect of living as a “seeker”, in the manner he outlines. The machine can only operate if its practitioner agrees to bracket or suspend his reason during his immersion, yet until he arrives at this point, and perhaps for years on end, the seeker has for existential insulation only his sense of innate nobility, derived entirely from his experience of himself as an intellectual — indeed, as a critic. After all, how else will the seeker come to see through every other explanation for our condition, eventually to fetch up at the machine? By criticism. And yet, to live in this way is surely simultaneously to hone a critical weapon which is also not merely the essence, but the totality, of the individual’s self-esteem.\n\nIn short, Pascal’s seeker may in fact become, not more, but less inclined to bracket off his reason, in favour of whatever effect the “machine” may have on him. And of course, even if the individual manages to maintain his immersion long enough to feel its transformative effect, even if he comes to feel in himself the presence of an activity too deep for words, he still must wait. Wait for a grace that may never come, a transfiguration whose activity depends on nothing human. Whether the merely ambient heat of participation in the machine would ever be enough to sustain such waiting is an open question. What seems plain, however, is that transfiguration is the one thing held infinitely far from Pascal’s reader. Those who take his book seriously can only ever exchange one form of endurance for another.\n\nPascal’s reed-figure can, I think, illuminate our own state of malnourishment — that is, those of us who are cut off from the entheos of Christian love, and too rational to be easily invaded by another.\n\nThe transfigurations of life\n\nAt this point, it is fitting to close by returning to Nietzsche, Pascal’s most important admirer, a thinker rendered both kindred and forever estranged from the Frenchman by his understanding of transfiguration.\n\nNietzsche considered acts of transfiguration to be a fundamental possibility of the human will, albeit one difficult and rare. Indeed, not only does he characterise philosophy itself as the “art of transfiguration”, but within a few weeks of his letter to Overbeck, in which he described his desperate need to perform the “alchemical trick” of turning his personal suffering into a kind of “gold”, Nietzsche was working at a furious pace on what would become the first part of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, a work he regarded as the apex of the “life-affirming” aspect of his philosophical task. He performed the trick.\n\nIt is section 107 of The Gay Science, however, that supplies some of the clearest evidence of the gulf that ultimately separates Nietzsche and Pascal. Here, against Pascal’s view that life contains only one legitimate kind of transfiguration, Nietzsche asserts the possibility of numberless transfigurations of life, of various magnitudes, occurring within an endless number of possible situations. He understands these experiences to insulate us, to a greater or lesser extent, against the worst effects of our exposure to the problem of existence. As with Pascal, honesty is a cardinal concern of Nietzsche’s, although his response to it is very different:\n\nOur ultimate gratitude to art. — If we had not welcomed the arts and invented this kind of cult of the untrue, then the realization of general untruth and mendaciousness that now comes to us through science — the realization that delusion and error are conditions of human knowledge and sensation — would be utterly unbearable. Honesty would lead to nausea and suicide. But now there is a counterforce against our honesty that helps us to avoid such consequences: art as the good will to appearance. We do not always keep our eyes from rounding off something and, as it were, finishing the poem; and then it is no longer eternal imperfection that we carry across the river of becoming — then we have the sense of carrying a goddess, and feel proud and childlike as we perform this service. As an artistic phenomenon existence is still bearable for us, and art furnishes us with eyes and hands and above all the good conscience to be able to turn ourselves into such a phenomenon. At times we need a rest from ourselves by looking upon, by looking down upon, ourselves and, from an artistic distance, laughing over ourselves or weeping over ourselves.\n\nThis is a remarkable vision of our relation to the problem of existence — one possible only on the basis of an understanding of ourselves and our relation to the world that, in crucial ways, deviates sharply from that of Pascal. For Nietzsche, the human will is granted the ability not only to insulate, but also to rescue itself, from despair. Like Pascal, he urges a courageous intellectual lucidity before the horror of our predicament; for him, a “passion of knowledge” has emerged in certain contemporary individuals, a passion he not only considers fatal to the Christian faith, but which he also argues, audaciously, may be discerned within the Pensées themselves.\n\nYet, in contrast to Pascal’s woeful reed, Nietzsche believes the thinker’s forays of existential-intellectual investigation must be tempered by a joyous engagement with experiences of blissful, knowing self-delusion. This is delusion construed not as a scornful distraction, but as providing moments of transfiguration — moments in which, as long as they last, the sacred might be experienced as immanent to, as arising from within, the everyday.\n\nThere are moments, beautiful and tragic moments, when we allow ourselves to indulge in the poetry of things, including the poetry of persons. There are moments when, however ruthlessly we may otherwise pursue the “passion of knowledge” regarding the nature of our predicament, we pause. In these moments we resist the intellectual urge to avoid illusion, and instead let it hold sway. Our intensity relaxes and thereby becomes not only more intense, but beautiful.\n\nThen we give way to the presence of the goddess, however, wherever, in whomever, she chooses to appear. Then, we deem it a signal honour to cherish her above the flux of the moment. To hold hands by the river. To watch the toss of the trees. To allow the busker his few minutes, in which he will weave together the chaos of the evening street with melody and rhythm. It is precisely due to the extent that such moments are so often steeped in tears that they are also characterised by festive outbreaks of thanksgiving and laughter.\n\nThese are events of deep and genuine mystery, events in which life itself is affirmed in all its painfulness, in which the comedy of existence is called out and temporarily disarmed, events in the face of which the dreary facticity of our suffering proves to be no argument at all. These are brief transfigurations of agony into joy. They are of that scale mentioned above, at the highest and most difficult pitch of which is not merely our blissful indulgence in the contingent alchemy of this or that moment, but intentional, sustained, affirmative acts of human creativity — the forging of a Zarathustra, for example.\n\nAnd, found somewhere on the way to such singular activities, is the wistful imagining of situations in which the strange magic of transfiguration might be at work. In his notes, for example, Nietzsche sketches a figure that he knew very well did not, could not, exist: a laughing Pascal.\n\nOf course, Nietzsche divides opinion; perhaps too much that is unacceptable is found in him. Perhaps we feel too strongly that the entheos of “God” must remain forever singular, capitalised, and Christian. In any case, in an article exploring why one might read Pascal, it is only proper that the Frenchman has the final word. For him, in the end there are only three sorts of people: “Those who have found God and serve him; those who are busy seeking him and have not found him; those who live without seeking or finding him.” To this he adds: “The first are reasonable and happy, the last are foolish and unhappy, those in the middle are unhappy and reasonable.”\n\nWhich are you?"
