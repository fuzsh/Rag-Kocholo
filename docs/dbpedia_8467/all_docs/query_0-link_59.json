        "text": "1. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz [Mathematician] Name : Omer Shaikh Group : MPC -1B Roll No : 7066\n\n2. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz [German Mathematician] Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz [1646- 1716] (also known as von Leibniz) was a prominent German mathematician, philosopher, physicist and statesman. Noted for his independent invention of the differential and integral calculus, Gottfried Leibniz remains one of the greatest and most influential metaphysicians, thinkers and logicians in history. He also invented the Leibniz wheel and suggested important theories about force, energy and time. 2\n\n3. Birth 3. ‘ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig, Germany in 1646. His father died when he was just five years old. He was raised by his mother, whose religious and moral beliefs fostered his interest in philosophy. He taught himself to read Latin by age twelve and started studying Greek. In grade school, he learned about Aristotle’s logic and theory of categorizing knowledge, but he was dissatisfied with what he was learning and began working on his own ideas for ordering logical truths. This would later develop into his ability to perform difficult mathematical proof he developed the law of continuity and transcendental law of Leipzig\n\n4. Early life and Education 4 Gottfried Leibniz was born on 1st July 1646 in Leipzig, Saxony, Germany to influential parents. His father, a professor of moral philosophy at the city’s university, died when Leibniz was only six. His mother was the daughter of a rich local lawyer. Leibniz was a childhood prodigy. He became fluent in Latin and studied works of Greeks scholars when he was only twelve. He entered the University of Leipzig when he was fourteen, where he took philosophy, mathematics and law. . University of Leipzig . . . .\n\n5. Books . Leibniz's voluminous writings include the Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas; the Discourse on Metaphysics; the Correspondence with Arnauld; New Essays on Human Understanding; the Theodicy; the Monadology; the Correspondence with Clarke; and numerous works in mathematics, science, history, and jurisprudence. 5\n\n6. Discoveries 6  Gottfried Leibniz discovered infinitesimal calculus, a distinction he shared with Sir Isaac Newton. However; each one made this discovery alone, not while working together. Infinitesimal calculus is the branch of mathematics that is concerned with differentiation, integrations, and limits of functions.  Gottfried Leibniz's major contribution to mathematics was his discovery of the binary numeral system, or the base-2 system, which we find today in computers and related devices. The binary numeral system is a way of writing numbers using only two digits: 0 and 1.\n\n7. Facts  Leibniz was given access to his deceased father’s library at the tender age of six because he had shown a strong desire for philosophical learning. He had attempted to read Livy’s History of Rome, despite his limited understanding of Latin.  Although Leibniz is known as the father of German philosophy, most of his work is in French.  Leibniz invented a calculator that could multiply, divide and extract roots during a time when the calculator of Blaise Pascal (1642) could only accommodate addition and subtraction. 7\n\n8. Award  The Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize (DFG) is the most important research award in Germany. The Leibniz Programme, established in 1985, aims to improve the working conditions of outstanding researchers, expand their research opportunities, relieve them of administrative tasks, and help them employ particularly well- qualified young researchers. The prize is endowed with up to 2.5 million euros. There are currently five winners of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize working as researchers and lecturers at FAU. . . . 8 . . Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\n\n9. Legacy 9 the great German polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716). Leibniz made significant contributions to many areas, including philosophy, mathematics, political and social theory, theology, and various sciences. The essays in this volume explores the effects of Leibniz's profound insights on subsequent generations of thinkers by tracing the ways in which his ideas have been defended and developed in the three centuries since his death. he shaped the various domains to which he contributed, and in some cases continues to shape them today. . ."
