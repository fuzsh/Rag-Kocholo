Other Notes:

Large hole in centre. Black labels. Has UPC printed right on the label of the vinyl, and sent out in a generic white sleeve to shops as a low price single. Different label than other USA pressing.

Other Notes:

Commercial release in a regular jewel case. The first pressing of this CD did not contain the Capitol Records logo on the back cover in the lower left hand corner, although Capitol is mentioned in the credit fine print. Later pressings would add this logo.

Other Notes:

This was a later pressing of “Stay” for the US market. Initial pressings did not contain the Capitol Records logo on the back sleeve, but did mention it in the fine print. Later pressings would add the logo in the bottom left corner on the back. The matrix number changed with these pressings as well.
