        "text": "This soundtrack was the second of many collaborations between U2 and film director Wim Wenders. U2 has contributed many songs to Wenders' soundtracks, and Wenders even directed the Bono penned Million Dollar Hotel film.\n\nThis soundtrack features alternate versions of two tracks from Zooropa. Both Stay and The Wanderer are longer versions. The Wanderer includes additional vocals by Johnny Cash which were not included on U2's album, the soundtrack version was 30 seconds longer. Stay features a slightly different musical track and is a minute longer than the album version. There are no additional lyrics included in Stay, but Bono does sing more \"do do do do's\" throughout the song. For any fan of these songs this is a great CD to pick up if you can find it. Unfortunately it is out of print at this time."
