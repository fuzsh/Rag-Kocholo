        "text": "In 1976, a student named Larry Mullen Jr. put up a notice at Mount Temple Comprehensive School: “Drummer seeks musicians to form band.” This is how the members of U2 met, a moment specifically commemorated in Bono’s new memoir, Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story (out November 1).\n\nU2 are, at this point, the only rock band of their stature that still has the original lineup: No one’s overdosed, no one’s been fired, no one’s left the group in pursuit of a solo career. Yes, they own houses in the south of France and show up in the occasional gossip column and Bono jets off to Davos every year, but they are still very much a band, and there’s something remarkable in the fact that they continue to remain a going concern.\n\nThe traditional path to success in the music industry pretty much no longer exists, and if it did, a band like U2 never would have gotten the creative control they asked for — and received. No record label still in business today would have let them release a third album after the battles around the second one. And even after achieving international fame and fortune with The Joshua Tree, their fifth album, back in 1987, they came crashing back to earth with its follow-up, Rattle and Hum, which every rock critic in the world interpreted as U2 trying to teach America about American music.\n\nBy the end of the ’80s, U2 could have just kept moving forward with their existing formula and maybe eked out another few years with that pattern. Record companies certainly want bands to keep doing the thing, over and over again, that made them all that money. It took tremendous foresight for U2 to take a break and a fair amount of fortitude to stand onstage and inform your audience that “… this is the end of something for U2 … We have to go away and … and dream it all up again.”\n\nIn the search for that dream, Bono decided that if U2 decamped to Berlin with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, something had to happen. And it did. But for a while there, it almost didn’t. Every single member of U2 was convinced at one moment or another in the early days at Hansa Studios — the same place that David Bowie, Iggy Pop and others had gone to find magic, or at least inspiration — that this was the end of U2. And then, one day, Lanois suggested to the Edge that he combine two separate guitar parts. Those guitar melodies became the start of “One” and the beginning of what would become Achtung Baby — what Bono called “the sound of four men cutting down the Joshua Tree.”\n\nU2 would come roaring back at the turn of the millennium with All That You Can’t Leave Behind just at the moment when no one would’ve blamed any of them for sitting back on their piles of money, pursuing “side projects,” and touring every couple of years behind their catalogue. Realizing that record sales were, at some point, going to stop being a primary means of income, the band struck highly profitable deals with companies like BlackBerry and Apple. That has given them the luxury to write and record at their leisure, which is what happened with Songs of Experience. The band assured everyone it would be out not long after the end of the Songs of Innocence tour at the end of 2015, but we didn’t see it until two years later, and they toured The Joshua Tree again before touring Experience.\n\nIn honor of the publication of Bono’s memoir, we’ve updated our original list to include Songs of Experience as well as a handful of other official U2 releases. What follows is a rundown of every song* U2 has released, ranked in order from worst to best.\n\n*The ground rules: This list consists of officially released U2 songs only. This excludes covers, Bono-Edge or Larry Mullen Jr.–Adam Clayton outings (so no Spider-Man and no “Mission: Impossible,” which is a cover anyway). Passengers is excluded except for “Miss Sarajevo” and “Your Blue Room.” Live versions and remixes are treated as the same song and covered in that song’s entry if it’s relevant to its position on the list.\n\nThanks to/sources: U2 by U2, Niall Stokes’s U2: The Stories Behind Every U2 Song, and atu2.com’s lyrics and tour sections.\n\n234. “Boomerang II,” B-side to “Pride (In the Name of Love)”\n\nNot every experimental thought needs to be recorded and released, especially if you’re considering it to be part two to another throwaway.\n\n233. “Boomerang I,” B-side to “Pride (In the Name of Love)”\n\nI like the idea of U2 trying to be the Talking Heads, but not all of these experimentations needed to be recorded or released. (It is fun to sing the chorus of “Psycho Killer” to it, though.)\n\n232. “Get Out of Your Own Way,” Songs of Experience\n\nThe mechanics of “GOOYOW” have some of those absolute genius moments in the melody, but I am not ever going to forgive Bono for the misuse of the phrase promised land and for that entire verse about slavery, in which he throws in the ghost of Abraham Lincoln. He even drags poor Kendrick Lamar into this mess. It would be super-great if we could just forget this song exists.\n\n231. “Always”\n\nAnother non-LP B-side the fans continually rally for. This is quite possibly the most overrated track in the entire U2 repertoire. I get it; it’s the jam that the “Beautiful Day” riff originated from. But so what? It is otherwise flat and featureless, and nowhere near adjacent to its final form. It’s a bedroom demo, a napkin sketch at best. Demoted.\n\n230. “Your Song Saved My Life,” Sing 2 soundtrack\n\nThis is the kind of song you write for a children’s animated movie in which you’re playing a lion who is a retired rock star making a comeback — something you can do when you already literally wrote songs that saved people’s lives, like “Out of Control” or “Where the Streets Have No Name” or “Running to Stand Still.”\n\n229. “J. Swallow”\n\nThey needed a B-side for “Fire.” “It was done in a mad panic,” the Edge notes. “It was a case of two hours to go, let’s do it.” It sounds like that.\n\n228. “Big Girls Are Best”\n\nThis is so bad it’s embarrassing, an attempt to work something out in the studio that should have been erased by the tape op. Reasonable beat, but stupid lyrics and inane title.\n\n227. “American Soul,” Songs of Experience\n\nWhen U2 are a rock band, they are at their most believable, because that is who they are. It’s a skin they slide into with comfort and skill. When you get a loud, crunchy squaller like this song, you want it to give you both physical and emotional catharsis. Musically it does that, but then Bono just decides to be as vague as possible lyrically. Yes, we know, America is an idea — you’ve been telling us this for decades — but at the time you wrote it, that idea was fraying at the seams, and this vague, declamatory word salad that just recycled one of your favorite taglines was your response? For good measure, he makes up the word refu-Jesus, which was completely unnecessary and, frankly, lazy. Drag out a megaphone and an American-flag backdrop live and maybe the people in the audience who voted Republican will forget that you’re trying to make a point about refugees and the world’s responsibility to them.\n\n226. “Yahweh,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\nThe title to this song is meant to be the unspoken name of God, so of course Bono wanted to have it in the chorus. The tune is vague and unsatisfying, and the lyrics are stuck in that no-man’s-land between Bongolese and the actual finished lyrics. It is a terrible way to end an album.\n\n225. “The Refugee,” War\n\nThey sound like some third-rate New Wave band trying to be relevant. This track is awful, made worse by opening side two after the graceful end on side one with “Drowning Man.” Bono would comment later, “I think it’s probably in the wrong key and is trying to be exciting and not quite pulling it off.”\n\n224. “Flower Child,” Unreleased & Rare\n\nAn acoustic, Beatles-esque leftover from All That You Can’t Leave Behind. “Wild Honey” occupied the same general theme, although the Edge said that “Flower Child” is a song he feels is waiting for a rewrite.\n\n223. “Saturday Night,” Boy (2008 deluxe edition)\n\nIf it sounds familiar, it’s because it was another basic demo that got dismembered: The guitar solo is the fade-out at the end of Boy, and the rest of it got reworked into “Fire” from October. The Edge is right on with his observation that “listening back now I can’t help feeling that we lost some of the power and directness of the original.”\n\n222. “Ahimsa”\n\nU2 took the Songs of Experience tour to India in 2019, their first time appearing in that country, and collaborated with A.R. Rahman, a musician who (among other things) likes to work in the space between eastern and western music. Ahimsa is the Sanskrit word for “nonviolence.” It’s a fine song and a polite gesture.\n\n221. “Bass Trap,” B-side to “The Unforgettable Fire”\n\nIt’s a pretty instrumental that originated from a bass line from Adam Clayton that Eno fed through some kind of processor. Perfectly acceptable as a B-side.\n\n220. “Red Flag Day”\n\nThere are interesting elements in this one — bands would kill for that last minute, the Sturm und Drang, the power and lift of the melody, and the muscularity of the entire band pulling together — but it’s ultimately forgettable. The best interpretation I can see is that this is a summary of what it’s like to be married to Bono, and given how many songs on this and the previous record are about his wife either obliquely or blatantly (he mentions love 34 times), it’s not a huge stretch. “Baby, it’s a red-flag day / but baby, let’s get in the water” is the kind of direct challenge to fate that you can easily imagine Paul David Hewson issuing at multiple points in his life. This could be a fascinating topic (and has been in other songs on other albums), but you are not ever going to remember this one exists unless it comes up on shuffle during a road trip.\n\n219. “Down All the Days,” Achtung Baby (20th Anniversary “Super Deluxe” and “Uber Deluxe” editions)\n\nA proto-version of Zooropa’s “Numb,” with familiar instrumentation, but much more traditional lyrics. “It’s this quite unhinged electronic backing track with a very traditional melody and lyrics,” the Edge told Rolling Stone in 2011. “It almost worked.”\n\n218. “Native Son,” Unreleased & Rare\n\nProto-“Vertigo,” with different lyrics about jailed Native American activist Leonard Peltier. “The lyrics were about something I care deeply about,” Bono told Rolling Stone in 2004, “but the song didn’t vibrate. It didn’t change the room temperature.”\n\n217. “Another Day”\n\nThe second single released by the band, this stands head-and-shoulders above other early material because of its consistent focus, its authoritative execution. If they weren’t the next big thing they were going to try their hardest to sound like it. Fake it till you make it. It worked.\n\n216. “Disappearing Act,” The Unforgettable Fire (2009 deluxe edition)\n\nIt’s a rough sketch from early in the recording process for the album, which the band reworked in 2009 for the record’s reissue, although it is very difficult to understand why.\n\n215. “Soon,” Fan Club release/U2 360° Live From the Rose Bowl\n\nThis outtake from No Line on the Horizon was used as the intro music for the 360° tour, and was released with the deluxe edition of Live From the Rose Bowl DVD and was made available as a stream on u2.com for about five minutes.\n\n214. “Oh Berlin,” Achtung Baby (20th Anniversary “Super Deluxe” and “Uber Deluxe” editions)\n\nBono wrote a tribute song to Berlin before he realized the entire Achtung Baby album was a tribute. The lyrics are wince-inducing, but the melody has a monochrome intensity, thanks to Edge’s precise, choppy hooks that make it feel like Berlin traffic back in the day.\n\n213. “Summer of Love,” Songs of Experience\n\nThis is a quiet and tasteful interlude you may think is about California — because of the title and because the phrase West Coast is in the chorus and because it sounds like a beach song. Which it is, except that the beach is in the south of France, where U2 maintain houses. Also, the “West Coast” is meant to be the west coast of Syria, since “Summer of Love” is actually about refugees in the Mediterranean Sea, a thing Bono thought about a lot when he and the band were sitting on the beach. He was irked that people assumed the song was about California since he mentions Aleppo by name once. (I wouldn’t even know any of the above if I hadn’t read an interview with Jann Wenner in which he complained that people didn’t understand the song.) There’s nothing poignant or haunting or foreboding in this one — Bono gets close to going there and then backs out.\n\n212. “Is That All?,” October\n\n“Scarlet,” the track that precedes “Is That All?” on October was a light send-off that echoed the theme of the album and closed the door on that particular period of U2. For some reason, the band decided they needed to add one more song, and one that they wrote in the studio. The lyrics are so empty they’re not even worth discussing.\n\n211. “Love Comes Tumbling,” Wide Awake in America\n\nFrom the outtake pile for The Unforgettable Fire, resurrected for various B-sides and the EP. It’s certainly atmospheric, and an interesting waypost on the upcoming journey to Death Valley.\n\n210. “Sixty Seconds in Kingdom Come,” B-side to “The Unforgettable Fire” single\n\nMore outtakes dug out of of the pile in service of filling 12-inch singles.\n\n209. “Deep in the Heart,” B-side to “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” single\n\nAnother one of the missives to love and lust resulting from missing wives during the Joshua Tree sessions, it’s a remembrance of youthful indiscretions in Bono’s childhood home. Note the “You can’t return to the place you never left” line, which would get borrowed later for “Cedarwood Road” in 2015.\n\n208. “Endless Deep,” B-side to “Two Hearts Beat As One”\n\nAn atmospheric, almost tribal instrumental that’s basically a bass solo. Adam also sings lead vocals, such as they are.\n\n207. “Cartoon World,” Boy (2008 deluxe edition)\n\nIt’s U2’s version of a Ramones song, performed live in Dublin in 1980. Succinct and delightful.\n\n206. “Rise Up,” The Joshua Tree (20th Anniversary deluxe edition)\n\nEdge characterizes this track from an early recording session for the album as, “It was a contender for a while, but never had the substance.” Indeed.\n\n205. “Angels Too Tied to the Ground,” War (2008 deluxe edition)\n\nOuttake from the War sessions, but the reissue states that it was originally recorded in 1982, with additional nonspecific recording in 2008. If that additional recording was meant to improve or finish the outtake … let’s just say it did not help much.\n\n204. “Race Against Time,” B-side to “Where the Streets Have No Name” single\n\nDuring the recording of The Unforgettable Fire, the Edge discovered King Sunny Ade and juju music, a cross between Western pop and African rhythms. Juju is, at its core, a bouncy, highly danceable music form, and it definitely influenced this polished outtake from the TJT sessions. It would not have fit anywhere on the record, but it’s at least a complete thought.\n\n203. “One Step Closer,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\nAs you get older and start to lose relatives, and then parents, it tilts your perspective of life and how to live it in a way that you don’t appreciate until you’re there. The loss of Bono’s father is all over HTDAAB, and here specifically. Bono was talking to Noel Gallagher, who asked if Bob Hewson believed in God. Bono said, “I don’t think he knows.” Noel responded, “Well, he’s one step closer to knowing now.” Bono: “I’m going to write that song.” “It started out kind of Velvet Underground and headed off into the country,” Edge said about this track, which is right, except that Bono channeled Lou Reed and not, say, Gram Parsons.\n\n202. “Speed of Life,” Boy (2008 deluxe edition)\n\nAn early instrumental that sounds like it could be a coda to the Who’s “Amazing Journey.” Part of the set in the early (1979-80) years of the band.\n\n201. “Near the Island,” Achtung Baby (20th Anniversary “Super Deluxe” and “Uber Deluxe” editions)\n\nThis Achtung Baby outtake is a soft, delicate instrumental on piano and acoustic guitar. You can just imagine this coming together under the chandeliers in Hansa Studios’ Meistersaal.\n\n200. “Heaven and Hell,” Achtung Baby (20th Anniversary “Super Deluxe” and “Uber Deluxe” editions)\n\nIt’s impossible to listen to this outtake and not envision it as U2’s affectionate remake of Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day.” The cadence of the vocals and the ennui in the inflection, the languid pace of the instrumentation are wonderful, but the lyrics on this officially released version, while improved from the (bootleg) studio outtake, are still not strong enough, which is unfortunate.\n\n199. “You’re the Best Thing About Me,” Songs of Experience\n\nThe best thing about this song is how the rhythm section is right up front, with the kind of rib-shaking Clayton bass line he doesn’t get to play much these days. There is so much U2-ness in this track, with bright Edge-ian arpeggios rippling through and a generally poppy, bubbling ambiance. It’s all perfectly within their sweet spot (instead of some kind of outer influence foisting modernity upon them). That said, it doesn’t break any new ground and, despite being the third song on Songs of Experience, is mostly forgettable.\n\n198. “Are You Gonna Wait Forever?,” B-side to “Vertigo”\n\nLoud, noisy guitar, another song channeling the Who (this is not a bad thing). Not strong enough to make the album.\n\n197. “The Playboy Mansion,” Pop\n\n“The original lyric was much more emotional. I am not sure the best version ended up on the album,” Bono said. You can see glimpses of what he’s talking about in the lyrics, but otherwise, it’s convoluted and ham-fisted, and the vocal delivery lacks emotion.\n\n196. “Window in the Skies,” U218 Singles\n\nIf your first thought when you hear this is, “Sounds like a Sgt. Pepper outtake,” wait until you see the video.\n\n195. “Mercy,” Wide Awake in Europe\n\nProbably the most popular outtake among the U2 fan base. From the How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sessions, it was played less than a dozen times on the back half of the 360° tour. It’s difficult to comprehend the rabid reaction to this particular track, except for its relative rarity. (It was leaked on the internet, probably when a CD of rough mixes was stolen from a photo shoot in France.) It is much better live, but honestly would still need a lot of work lyrically before it would be worthy of all the hype.\n\n194. “Love Is All We Have Left,” Songs of Experience\n\nThis track feels more like a prelude to the album than a full song; in concert (at least on the U.S. leg of the Songs of Experience tour), it was an introduction and a benediction. Bono wasn’t specific about his critical health issues that became the center of Songs of Experience, but the CAT scans and other medical sounds and artifacts that became part of the live performance — and thus part of the story — made it clear that it was a life-altering event. “This is no time not to be alive” is a line that will grip you around the heart.\n\n193. “Rejoice,” October\n\n“I can’t change the world / but I can change the world in me” is a reasonable observation, but the rest of the lyrics feel unformed; Bono has said it’s meant to be the same story as “I Will Follow” with a house falling down. The title isn’t accidental and also ties into the religious revival 75 percent of the band was going through at the time the album was recorded. There are graceful sweeps and arpeggios of Edge-ness from end to end, but it’s not enough to give this song legs.\n\n192. “Babyface,” Zooropa\n\nAn ode to the many supermodels who began keeping company with U2 in the ’90s. It’s a sweet little love song.\n\n191. “The Blackout,” Songs of Experience\n\nThe hook and bridge of “The Blackout” were some of the best moments of the Songs of Experience live show: “When the lights go out / and you throw yourself about,” Bono sings as the band kicks into full tilt. Lyrically, the track is about both his brush with death as well as America’s terminal condition — Bono categorizes both under “an extinction event” (which is why the opening line is about how dinosaurs are still walking the earth). Thematically, the story is just trying too hard to fit into his intention. Plus the line “Statues fall / Democracy is flat on its back, Jack / We had it all / And what we had is not coming back, Zac” is literally unforgivable for a lyricist of his caliber. That chorus, though, will have you dancing in the living room.\n\n190. “Elvis Presley and America,” The Unforgettable Fire\n\nIf U2 had given this song any other title, it would have saved them from so much abuse. It’s easier to forgive this song as part of the experience of listening to the album in order. There, this fits into the abstract expressionism, the watercolors and charcoal sketches that coast you up to “Bad” and out to “MLK.” But the title gives the track airs it does not possess. “A jazzman could understand that piece,” Bono told Rolling Stone in 1987. No, a jazzman would ask how the hell they thought this should go on the record.\n\n189. “13 (There Is a Light),” Songs of Experience\n\nIt’s tricky to write popular music, especially rock and roll, that’s self-referential. But when you do it right, it can work both for people who understand the connection from a previous record and for the listeners who don’t know it in the moment. “13 (There Is a Light)” refers back to 2014’s Songs of Innocence’s “Song for Someone,” and they used it to close the show every night on the tour, just like they used it to close the album. It could be overwrought, but it isn’t. For U2, it’s a gentle touch.\n\n188. “Beautiful Ghost/Introduction to Songs of Experience,” The Joshua Tree 20th Anniversary edition\n\nAn early Joshua Tree demo that illuminates much about the band’s creative process. The lyrics are literally the Introduction to William Blake’s Songs of Experience.\n\n187. “With a Shout,” October\n\n“We don’t want to be the band that talks about God,” Bono said in 1980, before joining a Christian revivalist movement and writing an album with undertones of the New and Old Testaments threaded throughout the lyrics. “With a Shout” is a reasonably powerful song from an instrumental perspective, but starts to feel like Bono is yelling about glory and righteousness yet again, with really nothing new to add. “If we’d been with a different label I think they might very well have decided to drop us,” manager Paul McGuinness said at the time.\n\n186. “Miami,” Pop\n\nIf there’s a less interesting premise for a song than “bored millionaires who can’t finish their album go take a vacation at a luxury destination,” not sure what it is.\n\n185. “Book of Your Heart,” Songs of Experience\n\nThe bonus song on the special edition of Songs of Experience should have made the cut because it is refreshingly devoid of the emotional no-man’s-land it felt like some of the songs got pushed into. (That might be why.) Or maybe Bono had already expressed the same thoughts elsewhere. But it’s too bad, because Mr. Hewson’s voice is warm and seductive, which is a thing he doesn’t often engage in.\n\n184. “Original of the Species,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\nIt was originally about Bono’s goddaughter (Edge’s daughter), then Bono changed it up so it wasn’t a song for a child, and there are some vague mumblings about maintaining innocence. It has an engaging, expansive melody, but the lyrics just do not hold up to scrutiny, and the synthetic strings are cringeworthy.\n\n183. “4th of July,” The Unforgettable Fire\n\nAnother Adam Clayton in-studio improvisation that the Edge joined in on, except this time Brian Eno had tape rolling, so what you hear is what they did in the studio, no overdubs, no multiple takes. It fits, slightly eerie and plaintive, and provides a necessary pause for the listener before the next track, back when records had deliberate sequences that informed most people’s experience of the album.\n\n182. “The Hands That Built America,” Gangs of New York soundtrack\n\nThis song was “written to order for Martin Scorsese,” Bono said. So it’s surprising that what U2 delivered for this film in particular was a bland, uninspiring soundscape.\n\n181. “Landlady,” Songs of Experience\n\nThis is the best of classic, grown-up Bono being honest with himself — a little sarcastic, talking about married life and married love. It’s one of the rare times U2 lets themselves be local (the term landlady in the U.K. isn’t simply about owning land; it’s also the term used for a woman who runs a public house — less owner than proprietor). “When the doorbell rings / you tell me I have a key” echoes back to the stories Bono has told over the years of coming home after a tour and being sent away because he hasn’t come down from all of it yet. The landlady is Ali; the landlady is the divine feminine; the landlady is God.\n\n180. “God Part II,” Rattle and Hum\n\n“God Part II” is meant as a direct a response to the 1988 Albert Goldman bio of John Lennon, following his then-shocking Elvis biography in the early ’80s. Not all windmills need to be tilted at, and a line like: “I don’t believe that rock’n’roll / Can really change the world” seemed pretty misplaced.\n\n179. “Alex Descends Into Hell for a Bottle of Milk/Korova 1”\n\nWritten upon request for a theatrical production of A Clockwork Orange, the director was advised by Edge that while he might want a hit musical, “We warned him we weren’t very good with hits.” On the other hand, if you view this Berlin gothic-pop instrumental through the lens it was created for, it fits pretty damn well. It ended up as the B-side to “The Fly,” a good home for it.\n\n178. “White As Snow,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nThe melody is ancient; Daniel Lanois was digging into 12th- and 15th-century hymns — as one does, if you’re Daniel Lanois — but when it came time for lyrics, Bono and the band were able to craft a story that could be modern or extremely old. The concept revolved around a soldier in Afghanistan, but the lyrics could have come from one of those hymns. There are also some uncharacteristic ’60s-influenced harmonies.\n\n177. “The Showman (Little More Better),” Songs of Experience\n\nMelodically and structurally, this is a fantastic song; it’s Bono riffing on “Bono,” his image and persona, and his particularly chaotic and occasionally ham-fisted approach to being the lead singer of a rock-and-roll band. It’s almost a little too self-deprecating: “Singers cry about everything.” YES, WE KNOW.\n\n176. “Street Mission,” Early Demos\n\nThis outtake, released on the Early Demos project, has had a legendary reputation among fans as one of the holy-grail outtakes — one of those should’ve-been-released-whatever-were-they-thinking kind of things. The truth is that “Street Mission” is absolutely vital and important to the band’s history, but that doesn’t mean it is a very good song. It is loud and brash and shouty and ever so earnest, and you just want to pinch its freshly scrubbed, rosy-pink, punk-rock cheeks.\n\n175. “This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now,” Songs of Innocence\n\nU2 does not need to write a song in tribute to Joe Strummer; they already did that, with “Out of Control” or “11 O’Clock Tick Tock,” or even “Street Mission.” “This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now” is well-intentioned but completely devoid of the impact and excitement of hearing the Clash for the first time. (No one can write a good song about the Clash, to be fair.)\n\n174. “The Ground Beneath Her Feet,” The Million Dollar Hotel soundtrack\n\nThis is haunting and evocative, and the Edge’s solo will break your heart in two. Definitely one of their best songs of the last 20 years. Salman Rushdie gets a co-writing credit because Bono copped a line straight from Rushdie’s novel of the same name (he was very chuffed about it).\n\n173. “The Troubles,” Songs of Innocence\n\nIt would be a reasonable assumption to think that a song called “The Troubles” on a U2 record would be about the conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century, except that it is not. It’s an interesting sonic experiment with Lykke Li on guest vocals, but oddly dispassionate.\n\n172. “Wild Honey,” All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\nThis is a perfectly serviceable pop tune, but you kind of have to side with Larry Mullen, who said, “It’s a playful side to U2 you rarely get to see. But it wasn’t one of my favorites.”\n\n171. “Yoshino Blossom,” The Unforgettable Fire (2009 deluxe edition)\n\nAnother demo that didn’t make the album. In the liner notes, Edge writes, “It seemed at the time to be a color already well-represented, so we never got around to developing it beyond this point.”\n\n170. “Winter,” Brothers soundtrack\n\nA reject from No Line on the Horizon that was reworked to play over the closing credits of a friend’s film. Eno was not pleased. “Tell them they’re being stupid cunts,” he joked to a journalist after playing him the song. It’s ambient and delicate, the kind of thing that you want playing as people are walking out of the movie theater.\n\n169. “Things to Make and Do,” B-side of “A Day Without Me” single\n\nIt’s a sweet, little, surf-guitar-flavored instrumental, which showed up as the B-side of the “A Day Without Me” single.\n\n168. “Levitate,” Unreleased & Rare\n\nMore detritus from All That You Can’t Leave Behind, with bits that ended up over in “Miracle Drug.” In the liner notes, the Edge writes that “Levitate” is one of the songs that “just don’t fit in.”\n\n167. “Smile,” Unreleased & Rare\n\nThe Edge described “Smile” as one of those songs that “just arrived too late.” It’s definitely not finished in this state, but it probably should be. There are elements of love and faith, and the music is compelling.\n\n166. “Treasure (Whatever Happened to Pete the Chop)”\n\nBouncy, joyous, full of vim and vigor. It’s not going to burn the world down, but the tune is memorable, and the melody line is bulletproof. Manager Paul McGuinness was so fond of it that he wanted to release it as a single; the Edge offers, “It was very melodic, but not really very good.” It is definitely an antidote to the A-side, “New Years Day.”\n\n165. “Stateless,” The Million Dollar Hotel soundtrack\n\n“There were a couple of U2 songs there, and a couple that might have become U2 songs, but they were the kind of atmospheric, mid-tempo pieces that we come up with quite easily,” said Adam Clayton, which exactly characterizes this track.\n\n164. “Sleep Like a Baby Tonight,” Songs of Innocence\n\nAn oblique, yet direct condemnation of the various abuses committed by the Church in Ireland over the years. “Secrets can make you sick,” Bono writes in the liner notes. The melody here is controlled but unsettling, with a guitar solo that sounds like an SOS.\n\n163. “A Man and a Woman,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\n“That’s really the wild card on the album,” the Edge said in 2006. He’s not wrong, and it’s not a bad song — it is actually a fascinating, unexpected melody, but it’s kind of an abrupt pause on this particular record.\n\n162. “When I Look at the World,” All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\nBono sort of vaguely says, “Yeah, maybe it’s about my wife,” but there’s no overarching theme or melody here to make this one memorable.\n\n161. “The Little Things That Give You Away,” Songs of Experience\n\nThis is the sleeper on Songs of Experience, the one they never quite figured out what its ultimate form should be. It came out a handful of times on the Joshua Tree 2017 tour as an acoustic final encore out on the B-stage; even in its broken-down, embryonic form, people did not run for the exits. The song’s production on the album does its best to obscure its good bones, but Bono stretches his voice to the melodic edges, where it sounds its best, and the Edge keeps swooping in with the kinds of ascending and descending lines that are pretty much trademark — especially in the last minute, when the melody and emotion key right in alongside Bono. But I’d still rather have the broke-down version, because that’s where the interesting things happen.\n\n160. “Red Light,” War\n\nThe most believable account of what this song is actually about is Bono mentioning something about Amsterdam and the red-light district, which would be understandably mind-blowing to a bunch of kids from still-sexually-conservative Ireland. The trumpet is courtesy of Kenny Fradley of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, who just happened to be in town. It’s not a terrible song, but it’s not a great one either. Points for trying to do something different with it.\n\n159. “Love Is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way,” Songs of Experience\n\nYou know how in How the Grinch Stole Christmas there’s that scene in which you see an X-ray of the Grinch’s heart and it grows so large it breaks the frame? This is what this song will do to you. It is a full-scale European-football-stadium-size anthem, and it will echo in your head for days. And while it’s kind of dumb to think, I wish the Edge played piano more — because, you know, he’s a uniquely singular rock guitar genius — his keyboard work on “Love Is Bigger” may make you say just that.\n\n158. “Where Did It All Go Wrong”\n\nRescued from the cutting floor at Hansa Studios, this unnecessarily elevated demo somehow made it to the B-side of the “Even Better Than the Real Thing” single instead of any of the many far-superior tracks that didn’t make the final cut for Achtung Baby. There’s a nice, crunchy guitar break at the end and a vague Beatles-esque flavor, but it’s ultimately forgettable.\n\n157. “Grace,” All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\n“Hey, how about we end the record with another hymn, like we always do?”\n\n156. “Lights of Home,” Songs of Experience\n\nLights of home: thinking about what it must have felt like to drive back into Dublin in the early days of being on the road. Lights of home: thinking about how it felt to see the lights of Ireland flying back into the country. Lights of home: what it’s like to wake up in the hospital after being unconscious — which Bono makes clear with his choice of opening line, “I shouldn’t be here ’cause I should be dead.” It’s a tribute to U2’s songwriting skills that this song feels like all of the above: like absence and longing and missing something you didn’t know you missed until you got it back and your heart is whole again. Also, dude can write a chorus — a loud and irresistibly singable one that’s meant for a stadium full of people to shout at the top of their lungs. Combine all of that with a heart-stabbingly plaintive guitar solo from the Edge on the bridge and you’ll pull your phone out and turn on the flash and wave it above your head even if you’re just sitting at home.\n\n155. “Volcano,” Songs of Innocence\n\n“After grief comes rage,” Bono writes in the album liner notes for this track. But there’s a reasonable amount of self-deprecation in the lyrics — ”Do you live here or is this a vacation?” — and the melody is more upbeat than you’d expect for this subject matter.\n\n154. “A Day Without Me,” Boy\n\nWhen Boy came out, this was the track where you thought, “Hey, someone has been listening to Tom Verlaine.” That’s hardly a diss — it’s not like bands doing that were exactly thick on the ground — and the Edge’s ability to translate what he heard and make it his own is one of the hallmarks of U2. Bono deserves some credit for the purchase of the Memory Man echo unit that creates the soaring arpeggios on this track and “11 O’Clock Tick Tock.”\n\n153. “Stranger in a Strange Land,” October\n\nA Mr. David Bowie would like a word, gentlemen. That said, the song is actually about traveling to Berlin on tour, and is one of the album’s more genuinely interesting and engaging compositions.\n\n152. “Indian Summer Sky,” The Unforgettable Fire\n\nYou can hear the rumblings of The Joshua Tree in the urgency and vibrancy of this track; Bono states that it’s about New York City, and far be it for me to tell him otherwise, but this song sounds like the elements invoked: light, wind, earth, air. It’s a good transition after “Bad,” but otherwise sounds more like a demo than a finished track.\n\n151. “Shadows and Tall Trees,” Boy\n\nThe last track on Boy, this was a parting gesture — a multi-textured, harmonic send-off meant to depict the band’s suburban Dublin stomping grounds: The “shadows and tall trees” are meant to be the electric poles strung throughout the streets, the lyrics a reference to Lord of the Flies.\n\n150. “Wire,” The Unforgettable Fire\n\nOne of several songs Bono would end up writing about heroin, and specifically, the heroin problem in Dublin, as well as his own guilt — or rather, what’s always seemed like a cautious acknowledgment that if he had not been the person he was, he might have gone down that path, out of curiosity or boredom or comradeship. The music doesn’t quite match the lyrics, which are abstract and vague with a type of casualness that might be unforgivable, except this is the record that “Bad” appears on, so “Wire” gets a pass. Extra credit to Larry Mullen Jr., who is practically playing in the pocket here, and the rest of the band for a churning, frenetic background which could have been great with different lyrics.\n\n149. “Tomorrow,” October\n\nThe first time U2 played “Tomorrow” live, they were in the support slot for Thin Lizzy at Slane Castle — you literally cannot get a more Irish rock-and-roll pedigree than that — and they started their set with this song. “We were shite,” Bono said. “We failed spectacularly.”\n\nThere’s a lot about “Tomorrow” that’s unnecessarily overwrought; Bono described the lyrics as “unconscious rambling.” The lead instruments are uilleann pipes — the Irish version of bagpipes — and some very low-on-the-register bass rumblings. “Tomorrow” is one of those moments that make you grateful the band managed to finish this record and that the record company didn’t immediately show them the door.\n\n148. “Touch,” “11 O’Clock Tick Tock” single\n\nA perfectly acceptable B-side to “11 O’clock Tick Tock,” brisk and peppy, very much in tune with where U2 had decided they were going. But it’s simply not very memorable lyrically or instrumentally, Bono scatting about “touching you,” and the Edge trying to see how few notes he could play and, you know, still call it a song.\n\n147. “Boy/Girl” Three\n\nThe third song on U2’s debut Ireland-only release, “Boy/Girl” is overwrought and vibrates so much from nervous excitement that it’s like listening to nails on a chalkboard. But if you listen to a live version (the one from the Marquee Club on the deluxe edition of Boy, for example) it sounds like a completely different band, capable and self-assured.\n\n146. “The Fool,” Early Demos\n\nFrom U2’s second demo session in 1978. This is a group of 17- and 18-year-old kids, and this track is absolutely as valid as as anything else coming out at the time. They instinctively understood what punk rock was meant to be; the Edge talks about seeing the Jam on Top of The Pops and “realizing that actually not knowing how to play was not a problem.” It’s a delightful mix of the Jam and the Undertones, with a little bit of Keith Moon flourish on the drums.\n\n145. “If God Will Send His Angels,” Pop\n\nWait, was this supposed to be a dance record? “If we could sing and play like Prince, that would have been Top 10,” Bono said. Except that the lyrics are overwrought, even for Bono. The Edge blames the chorus: “It is a nice tune, but the chorus doesn’t connect.”\n\n144. “Get on Your Boots,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nThere are fun bits and interesting sequences, but just because you compare something to “Subterranean Homesick Blues” does not make it so. There was an interesting sonic dynamic in the studio version — the compression on Bono’s voice — that you could not duplicate in a stadium. Every other member of the band was in lockstep, but there was no room to breathe for the lead singer. Clearly, someone felt like they needed a big noisy rocker à la “Vertigo” or “Elevation,” but there is a reason “Boots” hasn’t been heard from since the 360° tour, while the others are constants in the set list.\n\n143. “Crumbs From Your Table,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\nPeople like to give Bono a really hard time for his political involvement, but his advocacy for AIDS patients in Africa is above reproach. He was willing to talk to anyone from any side of the political spectrum in any country if he thought they could contribute money, or help him contribute money. “Crumbs From Your Table” is a fairly angry song about that experience. It is, let’s just say, oddly prescient.\n\n142. “I’m Not Your Baby,” The End of Violence soundtrack\n\nA surprisingly compelling duet between Sinead O’Connor and Bono, with lyrics by Mr. B and U2 as backing band, this track was another collaboration between U2 and director Wim Wenders. It walks a line between Zooropa and Pop, but is polished, sharp, and evocative.\n\n141. “Drunk Chicken/America,” The Joshua Tree (20th Anniversary deluxe edition)\n\nIt’s an improvisation that was one of the first things U2 recorded when they began the process of putting together The Joshua Tree, and that’s Allen Ginsberg reciting his poem “America” over it. It’s one of the perks of being a rock star: that you can call anyone you want to show up on your records or at your concerts, and sometimes you call one of America’s greatest poets. Why wouldn’t you?\n\n140. “Love You Like Mad,” Unreleased & Rare\n\nAnother outtake from All That You Can’t Leave Behind that sounds like a dead ringer for Tommy-era Who. Unlike a lot of these leftovers, this is an actual, realized song and would have fit very well on How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\n\n139. “Seconds,” War\n\nLead vocals and excellent guitar work from the Edge are the highlights here. There’s a lot to like about this one; tight, compact, evocative, it almost unintentionally contextualizes the record by coming in after “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” in that it’s another current commentary. If anything, it almost foreshadows what the band would do later on the Zoo TV tour, with the sample from a documentary about female soldiers in the middle.\n\n138. “The Three Sunrises,” Wide Awake In America\n\nThe same bass figure that opens “4th of July” opens this outtake, which, unlike most of the other rejected tracks for the album, morphs into a mostly complete thought, jangly and Beatles-esque. It allegedly almost made the record but was rejected because it didn’t fit, which is definitely true.\n\n137. “Scarlet,” October\n\nIf this mostly instrumental track reminds you of “40” on War, you’re not imagining things. The strength of the musical composition on “Scarlet” is the only thing that keeps the listener from thinking, “Great, another song with Bono yelping about rejoicing again.” The bass line holds the melody, interspersed with warm, round guitar and piano chords from the Edge, with Larry holding down a quasi-martial drumbeat. It would have been a perfect ending to the record … except it wasn’t.\n\n136. “Promenade,” The Unforgettable Fire\n\nAt the time, Bono was living with his wife Ali in a Martello Tower — basically a tiny castle near the ocean, renovated to include a glass roof at the top of the tower where they slept. You can hear all of this: the spiral staircase and the dizziness of young love (the two had only been married for two years, though they were teenage sweethearts); the two of them sitting at the top of their tower, watching the sun set over the seaside town. The song has the marks of loose improvisation, of ’70s-era Van Morrison — the kind of experimentation that Eno embraced strongly, paired with the kind of rhythm that Lanois loved.\n\n135. “Fire,” October\n\n“Fire” got U2 their first U.K. chart success, but it’s hard to understand how. The track has some solid moments, mostly thanks to the Edge pulling a sinuous guitar line out of the mess of a song. It sounds like U2 trying too hard to to do U2-type things in a U2-type song. Bono himself later said, “‘Fire’ was not a good song. I always had the faith that we could make it up as we went along, but sometimes we couldn’t, and that was a case in point.”\n\n134. “Love and Peace or Else,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\nBig, loud, and very satisfying, Edge’s guitar is piped through what feels like the world’s biggest fuzz effect, before switching to slide at the end. It falls apart a little with the bridge because it takes you out of the giant rumbling noise. Still, very fun.\n\n133. “Peace on Earth,” All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\nOriginally written about the Omagh, Ireland, bombings in 1998, the song took on a new meaning when it was joined to “Walk On” for A Tribute to Heroes, and stayed there through the end of the Elevation tour.\n\n132. “A Celebration,” single\n\nThis was recorded and released between October and War as an attempt at a stopgap filler, and it definitely feels that ephemeral. “At that point we needed a hit. ‘A Celebration’ wasn’t one of those,” the Edge said. The video is the very definition of ’80s video-making, with every possible cliché present and accounted for. (Nice red pants, Bono.)\n\n131. “Every Breaking Wave,” Songs of Innocence\n\nBono has often said that while he might not understand certain things in the world, he understands relationships, and writes about them with empathy and nuance. He’s also drawn to using the sea as metaphor, which works here. The choruses are bright and impassioned.\n\n130. “Song for Someone,” Songs of Innocence\n\nAnother song for the young Alison Stewart, aka Ali Hewson. In the introductions to the song on the Innocence and Experience tour, Bono would often speak about her encouragement to the young Paul Hewson and his music career — that his songs didn’t need to be perfect, but they needed to be. Bono’s voice starts out quietly, but quickly becomes impassioned at the chorus. It feels like you’ve walked into the middle of a conversation.\n\n129. “Stories for Boys,” Boy\n\nOne of the band’s earliest songs, it was plucked from the live show and chosen for U2 3, the band’s first release. But the version on Boy is almost unrecognizable from the original — the latter being almost pop-punk parody, while the album rendition is larger and more interesting. The rhythm section shines here: Adam’s bass runs are plump and melodic, and Larry offers large, booming flourishes that are the perfect adornment.\n\n128. “Stand Up Comedy,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nAccording to Daniel Lanois, this was six different songs until it settled into this soul-shoegaze-electronica groove about love, with a side trip for Bono to take the piss out of himself: “Stand up to rock stars / Napoleon is in high heels / Josephine, be careful / Of small men with big ideas.” Indeed.\n\n127. “Invisible,” single release\n\n“Invisible” is slick, but almost too slick — like they set out to write an Apple commercial. There’s no doubt that U2 can consistently play this tight, but they’ve squeezed the life out of the track. There needs to be some grit and space, or U2 is not interesting.\n\n126. “Some Days Are Better Than Others,” Zooropa\n\nA tongue-in-cheek litany of the trials and tribulations of being a rock star.\n\n125. “Like a Song,” War\n\nThis feels like U2 trying to offer commentary on the state of the music business at the time — “And in leather, lace, and chains / We stake our claim / Revolution once again” — but it’s all kind of wince-inducing and unnecessarily dramatic, even for someone who was on their side. The bridge is kind of interesting, and after basically not being able to hear Larry Mullen Jr. on the previous track (“New Year’s Day”), it’s good to hear him shine here. Mostly forgettable, though.\n\n124. “The Miracle (of Joey Ramone),” Songs of Innocence\n\nU2 didn’t want to write a song that sounded like the Ramones, so they went in the opposite direction. But a song about the Ramones should be something you can dance to, and you cannot dance to “The Miracle (of Joey Ramone).” The lyrics are tight, the message could not possibly be more sincere, but there’s something awkward with the cadence of the lyrics which overcomplicates it unnecessarily. Also, while it’s understandable that they wanted to namecheck Joey in the title, it just comes off as trying too hard, which this band does not need to do. You’re not fronting, guys; you legitimately loved and had your life changed by punk rock — just write about it. The fans who care will figure it out, and it won’t matter to the fans that don’t.\n\n123. “Surrender,” War\n\nAs a story, “Surrender” is more linear than anything else on War; it was a song Bono had actually written, as opposed to improvised in the studio. It is particularly sympathetic to its protagonist, and was a definite counterpoint to how women appeared in other songs of the time. The band contributes a solidly constructed soundtrack that feels like the hustle and bustle of a big city, and the tension of one person trying to find or fight their way through. The Edge’s chromatic chords are just lovely.\n\n122. “Lucifer’s Hands,” Songs of Innocence\n\nWhen U2’s 360° tour reached South America and Europe, the shows opened with this utterly unhinged zombie-rock instrumental called “Return of the Stingray Guitar,” which promptly fell off the face of the earth once the tour was over. It would reappear in 2015 as the rather subdued backbone of “Lucifer’s Hands,” which, out of all the odes to the spirit of punk rock on this record, is the most enjoyable and successful: It’s loud; it’s straightforward; the rhythm section finds the room to add color and shadow; Bono’s vocal delivery is loose, sly, and mysterious; and you just want to drown in that guitar line. It feels just a tiny bit dangerous, which is a pretty great thing coming from some fiftysomething former punk rockers.\n\n121. “California (There Is No End to Love),” Songs of Innocence\n\nThe melody is irresistible and Bono’s voice slides over the vocals. But lyrically, “California” is all over the place. Bono said in the liner notes that this is meant to be about the first time U2 went to L.A., but there is none of that in the song, even emotionally. There’s what feels like a story line about what it’s like to grow old in Los Angeles: “Everyone’s a star in our town / It’s just your light gets dimmer / If you have to stay.” But the choruses are in a completely different mode, echoing the overarching theme of the record: “There is no end to love,” which is balanced by “There is no end to grief.” The instrumentation is almost too bland; you can barely hear the guitar and bass. One suspects U2 realized the limitations of the track, because it was pretty much AWOL during the Innocence and Experience tour.\n\n120. “Do You Feel Loved,” Pop\n\nThe way for U2 to write a sexy song is to not try to write one. When they try too hard, they end up with “Do You Feel Loved,” which feels 50 percent finished. Then again, that is the entire story of Pop, depending on who you talk to: not enough time and not the right people. The vibe is decent but it doesn’t go much further than that. “[It] was a great thought that never really became a great song,” the Edge said.\n\n119. “October,” October\n\nIf you didn’t know the backstory of how hard it was for U2 to write and record their second album, you just had to wait until you got to the title track. It is gray and brittle, the sound of frozen tree branches and faded autumn leaves trapped in the first layer of ice on a pond. Bono’s vocals are achingly bleak, and the Edge comes in with that delicate yet assertive piano line. He hadn’t played piano since he was a child. “I really don’t know where that ‘October’ piece came from,” he said in 2006, “other than just sitting at a piano and that’s where it brought me: into this quite stark, quite gray, but beautiful European place.”\n\n118. “Miracle Drug,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\nThe one thing that stops this song from being great is the chorus: “Freedom has a scent / Like the top of a newborn baby’s head,” which is of course Bono’s favorite line in the song. Also: Sometimes there can be too much backstory to a song, no matter how inspirational it might be.\n\n117. “Cedars of Lebanon,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nAs much as U2 tried to avoid bringing the war into this record, it was unavoidable, and it definitely creeped into “Cedars of Lebanon,” the thoughts of a war correspondent in the field. It’s an interesting close to this record — not a hymn or any kind of uplifting thought, but instead a reminder of the outside world, which everyone on the record is running from in some fashion. It’s a series of images narrated against a low-key, ambient background.\n\n116. “The Ocean,” Boy\n\nIt’s not hard to make a guitar sound like ocean waves, but it is an art to make them sound like a particular kind of ocean waves: the dark rolling whitecap kind, the kind you’d see in the Irish Sea. And the Edge does so with aplomb. “The Ocean” is a little blip, 1 minute and 35 seconds of atmosphere. Bono has been hard on himself for the self-indulgence present in the opening lines (“A picture in gray, Dorian Gray / just me by the sea / And I felt like a star”), both back when it happened and then later on — but out of the long list of egotistical sins he’s actually guilty of, his vehemence in this particular case is interesting. He apologizes for it by saying, “It is the thought of everybody in a band who thinks he can change the world,” except that he wouldn’t have become Bono had Larry Mullen Jr. not thought the same way and put a note reading “Drummer seeks musicians to form band” on the bulletin board at Mount Temple Comprehensive.\n\n115. “Into the Heart,” Boy\n\nThe segue from “An Cat Dubh” into “Into the Heart” originated from the band’s live show, so they kept it in place for the album. It is a piece of sorrow and hope: Adam’s bass line pulses like a heartbeat, while the Edge strums this gorgeous melody that feels like the end of heartbreak. Both the lyrics and the energy of Bono’s vocals carry this balloon of emotion to the end.\n\n114. “An Cat Dubh,” Boy\n\nThink about the 1-2-3 opening of Boy and the widely varying ranges of emotional tone from “I Will Follow,” “Twilight,” and now, “An Cat Dubh,” the black cat. We’re around the corner from the scene in “Twilight,” but we’ve now focused dead in on the tension of the scene, manifested by the sonics of Edge’s drone, the slight dread in Bono’s voice, and the story of a cat killing a bird and then sleeping next to it, waking up and playing with it again. There’s a riff at 2:44 from the Edge that is exactly that feeling, discordant and evil, shadowed by Bono’s howls. The xylophone that rings in the background adds both tension and fragility. This is how U2 were going to write about sex.\n\n113. “New York,” All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\nNew Yorkers can’t be unbiased about songs about New York, especially ones written by people who have gigantic crushes on the city. “I just got a place in New York” sounds like every college grad arriving here from Ohio with a gleam in their eye, and that loud, dirty guitar on the chorus sounds like gridlock on a holiday weekend. It’s also an alternate reality: what Bono could have ended up like, had his life gone another way.\n\n112. “So Cruel,” Achtung Baby\n\nOur hero has lost his campaign to win back his sweetheart, and now he is left to face his desolation. It’s time to descend into bitterness: “I gave you everything you ever wanted / It wasn’t what you wanted.” The theme of betrayal loomed large over Achtung Baby with the end of the Edge’s marriage, the alienation of Berlin in the winter, and the band uncertain this wasn’t going to be the end of U2. “Between the horses of love and lust / We are trampled underfoot,” Bono sings. The question, then, is whether you get up from the ground or surrender.\n\n111. “Slow Dancing,” B-side to “Stay (Faraway, So Close!)” single\n\nU2 wrote this for Willie Nelson and sent it off. When they got no response, they recorded it themselves — only for Willie to ring them up the next time he was in Dublin. They recorded a lovely version with him on lead vocals and released it on another single later.\n\n110. “Please,” Pop\n\nThe genius of “Please” is in the last two verses, where the beats pause and the vocals gently layer — like a friend putting a hand on your shoulder and looking you in the eye in an attempt to get you to be honest with yourself. The remainder of the song feels light years away from the first half, and maybe that’s meant to be intentional. The cool detachment of the early verses open up to an impassioned pleading. It’s going to sound like a broken record to state that, like almost everything on Pop, no one in U2 thinks this track was finished.\n\n109. “I’ll Go Crazy If I Don’t Go Crazy Tonight,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nFrom the sacred to the mundane, with the classic line, “The right to appear ridiculous is something I hold dear.”\n\n108. “Staring at the Sun,” Pop\n\nOn the record, the song isn’t that impactful, but on tour, they stripped it down to Bono and the Edge on acoustic out on the catwalk, and it was breathtaking.\n\n107. “FEZ — Being Born,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nThis is a tale of escape and, ultimately, freedom. “The real important thing to know about this song is the sense of speed and this kind of primeval drive to get back to your essence,” Bono said in the album liner notes. You get all of that, for sure, but if you have the slightest bit of imagination, you can see the scenes in your head, and you suddenly have the urge to visit Morocco.\n\n106. “Daddy’s Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car,” Zooropa\n\nAnother song that liberally borrowed elements or influences from the Zoo TV production: the fanfare sample in the intro and the images of Berlin after reunification, when Germans from the East were heading to Berlin in their Trabants — some of which barely made it into the city before breaking down on the side of the road. It’s impressionistic, futuristic, fun.\n\n105. “Electrical Storm,” The Best of 1990–2000\n\nThis song came out of sessions earmarked to generate bonus content for the upcoming greatest-hits records. Larry Mullen called this track “an incomplete idea.” Unsurprisingly, Bono is more generous, calling it “a post-9/11 song, but it is not an overtly political song.” There’s a definite feeling of unease, conveyed through the tension in a relationship, and, if nothing else, it’s a lovely, atmospheric meandering that kind of grows on you. The video is fantastic.\n\n104. “Last Night on Earth,” Pop\n\nIt’s a song you want to like. The off-kilter intro is so promising, there are a handful of vivid images (“She’s at the bus stop with the News of the World and The Sun,” you can just see a club kid stuck waiting for the first bus in the morning), the chorus is solid, and the concept of the story line is interesting, but it just does not connect. It probably doesn’t help that Bono came up with the chorus at 4 a.m. on their last night in the studio. (Sound familiar?) “It was a good tune,” the Edge said. “But is it up there with ‘New Year’s Day’ or ‘Sunday Bloody Sunday’? Obviously not, or we would still be playing it live.”\n\n103. “Tryin’ to Throw Your Arms Around the World,” Achtung Baby\n\nAt this point in the record, there had to be some respite, or listeners wouldn’t have kept going. It’s a light and fluffy composition that belies its origins, though; it was about U2’s own “lost weekend” in Los Angeles, where some of the band let loose in a manner they hadn’t been able to in their youth, when they were trying to get the band off the ground, get out of Ireland, and get a record contract. U2 have also characterized it as a drinking song, and made that point most definitively on the Zoo TV tour, where the Fly would go out on the catwalk, find an attractive young woman, spray Champagne around, and serenade the lucky lady on Handicam.\n\n102. “I Fall Down,” October\n\nBy the time the band needed to be working on the follow-up to their debut, three-fourths of them were deeply enmeshed in a Christian fellowship group called Shalom. They were attending regular meetings of the group while trying to put together the album, which was causing Bono, Edge, and Larry to question everything, including their membership in the band. The Edge actually quit U2 at that time, but didn’t tell anyone except Bono. Some of this, or all of this, is inside “I Fall Down,” which is accompanied by a surprisingly sophisticated arrangement around delicate piano work from the Edge, and a gorgeous vocal from Bono. The whole thing shimmers with gold.\n\n101. “North and South of the River,” B-side to “Staring at the Sun”\n\nThis track, written with the Irish folk singer Christy Moore, addresses the conflict in Northern Ireland around the time of the Good Friday Agreement. It’s a protest song, it’s Bono trying to write a gospel song and sing it like Al Green, and it’s wonderful. The band only performed it live once, on an Irish TV benefit for the victims of the Omagh bombing in 1998, where they deconstructed the song and made it more U2, and, understandably, more personal.\n\n100. “Desert of Our Love,” The Joshua Tree (20th Anniversary deluxe edition)\n\nAn outtake particularly beloved among U2 fans, it’s more of what the Edge termed “the U2 sketchbook,” as this track sounds absolutely nothing like anything on The Joshua Tree. But it was the first moment in the recording sessions where things started to gel — which you can absolutely hear — and it’s a combination of reggae and juju and a few gospel-tinged chords from the Edge on the piano. There are no real lyrics yet, and Bono is just vocalizing, as he often does in the early phases of a U2 recording session — it’s known as “Bongolese” — but the overall combination is delightful. “Desert of Our Love” became another outtake called “Weather Girls,” and then they got rid of the vocal melody and the piano and kept the drums and bass, and it turned into “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For.” It is rare that an outtake is simultaneously enjoyable and illuminating, and something you’d listen to more than once.\n\n99. “Fast Cars,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (U.K. and Japan release)/“Xanax and Wine,” Unreleased & Rare\n\nThe band had been in the studio for a year and a half, and true to form, it all came down to the wire on the second-to-last night when Bono decides he needs there to be a song on the record that has the title of the album in the lyric. “Xanax and Wine” met the criteria, but didn’t quite come together. So U2 tore the thing apart and refashioned it into “Fast Cars,” which is basically the same lyrics with a slightly retro guitar line that owes a few beers to Link Wray. (This is not a bad thing.) The lyric delivery on both of them sound like “Get Out of Denver” by Bob Seger, but “Fast Cars” has by far the more interesting melody, so it wins.\n\n98. “If You Wear That Velvet Dress,” Pop\n\nOne of the more successful numbers on Pop, it’s full of simple but interesting textures; but like most of the songs on the album, it occupies a middle ground that’s vague and tentative. “It wanted to be a lounge classic,” Bono said. He finally got his wish when he recorded it with Jools Holland in 2007. Yes, Holland is a skilled bandleader, but the vocals are Bono in full torch-singer mode.\n\n97. “Twilight,” Boy\n\nThe road from the B-side of “Another Day,” the first U2 single, to track two on Boy, is astonishing. The single had that kernel of something else that the band themselves probably weren’t aware of, but they were able to hone and polish it from breathless clamor into this tale of darkness and light and the shadows in between. It’s a respite from “I Will Follow,” but not by much, as the last chorus winds up dramatic tension vocally from Bono before he passes it over to Edge for a taut, compact refrain.\n\n96. “Two Shots of Happy, One Shot of Sad”\n\nIf you think this sounds like Bono trying to do his best Frank Sinatra, well, that’s exactly what this tune is. But they never heard back from Frank, so Bono recorded it himself. To be honest, this would have been perfect as a background scene in Oceans 11, Bono dressed as an aging version of the Fly in one of the casinos up on Fremont Street.\n\n95. “The Unforgettable Fire,” The Unforgettable Fire\n\nU2’s fourth record was recorded in a round gothic ballroom at Slane Castle, where the band had rehearsed and fell in love with the acoustics. (“The sound is magnificent,” Bono said of the space in 2006. “If Phil Spector was going to lie in state, it would be here.”) When you listen to the album’s title track, you can feel all of this, as well as the influence of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who took over the board this time out. It is a vast, expressive piece that bears no resemblance to traditional verse-chorus-verse rock or pop songwriting from a vocal melody standpoint. It’s one of those songs that you can absolutely feel, heart in your throat or in the pit of your stomach, but have no idea what it’s actually about. Bono himself admits that the lyrics are a sketch, but there is a strong sense of love lost and love longed for: “Stay this time,” “Come and take me away,” “Save your love / don’t push me too far.” It is an astonishing composition.\n\n94. “Salomé,” B-side to “Even Better Than the Real Thing”\n\nRecorded in Dublin, but definitely pointing toward Berlin, “Salomé” leaked in the early ’90s and either thrilled or horrified U2 fans about the future direction of the band. There’s a lot to like about the rhythms and textures (and there’s an awesome extended remix), but it wasn’t quite where U2 wanted to end up, given that it didn’t make Achtung Baby.\n\n93. “Walk to the Water,” B-side to “With or Without You” single\n\nAn improvisational sketch, with moderately successful pretentions toward Beat poetry. The soft melody would have fit into The Unforgettable Fire. (Watch Bono whisper it into the end of “All I Want Is You,” recorded for an upcoming BBC special.)\n\n92. “Summer Rain,” B-side of “Beautiful Day” single\n\nA poppy, atmospheric, quasi-acoustic number that feels tinged with nostalgia in a good way; it sounds familiar, but it’s brand-new, and would have been great on the radio. Alas, it did not make the cut for All That You Can’t Leave Behind.\n\n91. “Two Hearts Beat As One,” War\n\nAnother tour de force for Mr. Adam Clayton, the bass on this created the deepest, most unexpectedly danceable rhythm. As a pop song, it’s well-constructed, and did admirable duty as the record’s second single. But where this song excels is in the dance remix by Steve Lillywhite, which pulls out the bass line and keyboards and digs a solid groove.\n\n90. “In a Little While,” All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\nBono sings this in a desperate, tattered voice. The term “whiskey-soaked” is such a cliché, except in this case it happens to be 100 percent accurate: He had been drinking all night, got two hours of sleep, and came in and improvised the lyrics and the melody. He even works in a Van Morrison reference, to boot.\n\n89. “Red Hill Mining Town,” The Joshua Tree\n\nThroughout their history, U2 have been criticized for being political, as well as for not being political enough. “Red Hill Mining Town” is one of those moments. A commentary on the 1984–85 U.K. miners’ strike, the song focuses on the social impact of the strike, not the political or economic impact. “I feel more qualified to write about relationships because I understand them more than what it’s like to work in a pit,” Bono told Niall Stokes. The song is a masterful composition of despair and helplessness; the anguish in the vocals in that last bridge is truly heartrending. It’s worth noting that this song came into being from Bono’s first encounter with Bob Dylan, which took him in the direction of folk music, to this unbelievable version of Peggy Seeger’s “Springhill Mining Disaster.”\n\n88. “Cedarwood Road,” Songs of Innocence\n\nBono grew up at 10 Cedarwood Road, and although he’s referenced his neighborhood plenty of times throughout U2’s history, this is the first time he brings us inside the house with teenage Bono. “You can’t return to where you’ve never left.”\n\n87. “Another Time, Another Place,” Boy\n\nOne of the undersung numbers from Boy, this track is a complete thought, a fully formed composition, with all four band members performing at an equal level: Bono’s voice soars, full of promise, while Edge, Larry, and Adam mesh together like puzzle pieces. It’s wistful and innocent, earnest and heartfelt. In later interviews, Bono kind of shrugs this one off, but it’s a perfect tale of youthful lust and longing to be alone together.\n\n86. “Blow Your House Down,” Achtung Baby (20th Anniversary “Super Deluxe” and “Uber Deluxe” editions)\n\nOne of the best and most legendary of the Berlin outtakes, this barn burner has its roots in the ’60s with the harmonies and overall flavor, but enough edge (sorry) to make it feel fully modern. “Blow Your House Down” came into existence in the Rattle and Hum days, and there’s a fascinating outtake from the film showing Edge, Bono, and Jimmy Iovine working on the song while sitting on a beach on Long Island, Iovine enthusiastic about the song’s potential. It’s not hard to hear this fitting into Achtung Baby; it would have skewed the story slightly, but would still have fit in thematically, in a sort of “dancing while the world around you ends,” postapocalyptic mood. On the other hand, Island would have pushed hard for it to have been a single, and that would have been difficult to walk back from, taking away from the mood set by the actual singles.\n\n85. “Kite,” All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\nAnother heartbreaker, this one is subconsciously about Bono’s father (who would pass away in 2001), but is also just another missive of remembrance and loss. Bono’s voice soars, climbing from the end of the first verse until he goes full throttle into the chorus, with the Edge behind him echoing the melody.\n\n84. “Breathe,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nOn an album full of ambitious and complex songs, “Breathe” is surprising and absolutely fascinating. In this rolling, surging melody, with Bono half-singing, half-speaking, his delivery is a mixture of Nick Cave, Michael Stipe, and maybe a little Allen Ginsberg. The breathless, conversational style is matched by an equally urgent melody behind it. There’s an element of paranoia with a touch of euphoria. It could just be stream of consciousness or it could be some biblical parallel; that early morning visitor could be God, or Satan: “Man at the door says if I want to stay alive a bit longer / There’s a few things I need you to know.” But more likely it ties into the “let me in the sound” theme Bono threaded through the record — this idea that we are all people of sound, because he gets to the point where he states, “We are people born of sound / The songs are in our eyes / Gonna wear them like a crown,” and also “I’ve found grace inside a sound / And I can breathe now.”\n\n83. “Dirty Day,” Zooropa\n\n“Dirty Day” is a mix of contrasts: the low-key intro; Bono’s voice unadorned and raw, even when the falsetto comes in; the teasing hint of guitar notes under the vocal, until the song opens up at the chorus. It’s another song about fathers and sons, but this time the father walks out and meets his son years later. The outro name-checks Charles Bukowski, who (of course) the band had come to know: “Hank says, the days run like horses over the hill” references the title of one of Bukowski’s books.\n\n82. “Wave of Sorrow (Birdland),” The Joshua Tree (20th Anniversary deluxe edition)\n\nThis song began its life as “Birdland,” and was part of the batch of leftovers from the TJT sessions. When the band finished the record and went back over the outtakes to cull material for B-sides, they decided this track was too strong, so they put it aside. Edge has said that he tried going back to the song, but “could never get back inside.” It didn’t get pulled out of the pile until 2007, when U2 decided to revisit it for the 20th-anniversary edition. Bono pulled together a lyric and rerecorded the vocal. The origin of the lyrics came from Bono’s experience volunteering in Ethiopia after Live Aid, and the lovely, minimalist piano and percussion-heavy arrangement owes enough to the Patti Smith Group that U2 added the “(Birdland)” coda to the title as a nod of thanks. It’s only ever been performed once, at a charity gig in 2007.\n\n81. “Van Diemen’s Land,” Rattle and Hum\n\nThe Edge was inspired by the story of a man who left the British army to join the Irish nationalists and write poetry, and it was that poetry that got him deported to Tasmania, known in Irish folk culture as Van Diemen’s Land. It is not a bad song, just a curiously sequenced one, and did not help U2 in service to the story they were trying to tell with the album (and, later, movie). Anywhere else, it would have made sense, but at the top it was just too precious. Sorry, Edge.\n\n80. “In God’s Country,” The Joshua Tree\n\nA dream of America, one beyond cities and tour-bus windows, the music is as expansive as the sun rising over the horizon. And yet, there’s possibly unintentional commentary that’s almost hidden: “Sad eyes, crooked crosses / In God’s country.” It’s not accidental that a record inspired by America would end up being a fantastic road-trip record. Time this one right and you’ll think you’re flying.\n\n79. “Raised by Wolves,” Songs of Innocence\n\nA story of the Dublin and Monaghan car bombings in 1974, “Raised by Wolves” is a collection of sharp, cinematic scenes, every word carefully chosen, yet offering a wealth of astonishing, heartbreaking detail; the specificity brings you into the scene so that you’re looking at it from the same perspective as Bono. You won’t realize that, until the chorus arrives and you are there with him in his sorrow and rage: “Raised by wolves / Stronger than fear” is the anguished cry. It was a phenomenal piece of stagecraft on the Innocence and Experience tour, segueing in from “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” which wasn’t so much obvious as necessary.\n\n78. “Vertigo,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\nIf this song hadn’t been in an Apple ad, everyone would have loved it. It’s not serious, but it is interesting. Bono describes it as being trapped in a nightclub (and there is definitely some crappy nightclub named “Vertigo” out there) that you do not want to be at. Through that lens, even the botched count-off at the beginning makes sense; there’s always some slob who thinks they speak the local language when they do not. There are good lines, there are great images — it’s really just a rock-and-roll song. There was, however, no need to play it twice during a show, which U2 were entirely too fond of doing.\n\n77. “Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses,” Achtung Baby\n\nThis is not the strongest track on the album, but it is sonically resonant, and coming after the betrayal in “Until the End of the World,” one could view this as the flip side: the guilty party having to deal with the aftermath of their perfidy when their beloved decides to go elsewhere, and the jealousy that ensues. There is blame and pleading and confessions and insistence and obsession and regret. Sonically, it’s as gigantic as new love or a broken heart, and it all builds up to the two lines at the end of the bridge — “Come on now love / Don’t you look back” — sung with tremendous pain and passion.\n\n76. “Lady With the Spinning Head,” B-side to “One”\n\nThis early track was another useful exercise in the process toward Achtung Baby, but ended up being a parts car, with different elements stolen to be part of “The Fly,” “Ultraviolet,” and “Zoo Station.” The art of the B-side is lost in the days of streaming, but in this context, a B-side was a perfect place for this particular track, as it gave the fans a piece of the puzzle to figure out for themselves.\n\n75. “Ordinary Love,” Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom soundtrack\n\nWritten specifically for Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, it’s the classic Bono approach to interpret an event in the most micro way, through its impact on a relationship. It’s a lovely, evocative song — “Your heart is on my sleeve / Did you put it there with a magic marker?” — and the instrumentation and vocals definitely evoke the fragility of love falling apart. The problem with it is that there isn’t enough here to connect the listener to Nelson Mandela unless you knew that was what the song was supposed to be about: If you have to give a half-dozen interviews to explain the song, it might be a sign that it needs some help. Otherwise it fits beautifully into the Songs of Innocence and Experience cycle.\n\n74. “Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me,” Batman Forever soundtrack\n\n“I figured it’d be good for us to be involved in something that’s basically throwaway and light-hearted,” the Edge said about this Zooropa leftover that was transformed into something that sounds exactly like the soundtrack for a comic-book hero. It soars and zooms and creates a mood.\n\n73. “Stuck in a Moment You Can’t Get Out Of,” All That You Can’t Leave Behind\n\nBrian Eno can throw everything into a blender that he wants, but this is still a gospel song at its heart — a tribute to Michael Hutchence, the late INXS singer who was a friend of the band and whose suicide weighed heavily on Bono and Edge particularly. Bono told Rolling Stone, “[I]t’s a row I didn’t have while he was alive.” The last three stanzas of the song are heart-wrenching.\n\n72. “Lemon,” Zooropa\n\nAnother song delivered in the “Fat Lady” voice that Bono developed during Achtung Baby, and that, combined with the light, lilting melody, hides the fact that this is about Bono’s mother, who died when he was very young.\n\n71. “Magnificent,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nThe key line to this song is in the second verse, where Bono sings about his first cry being a joyful noise. U2 aren’t working Bible references into their songs accidentally, and if you circle up to the top of the verse: “I was born to sing with you.” Extend that further to the first verse: “I was born to be with you.” Bono could be talking about a lover or he could be talking about the audience — or both.\n\n70. “Drowning Man,” War\n\nIt’s not the best song on the record — to be fair, there is a fair amount of competition — but it is both ambitious and fully realized. Every single member of the band turns in a stunning performance, the instrumentation providing both delicate shade and solid counterpoint, the vocals raw and impassioned, and the lyrics grounded in adoration of both spiritual and physical. Extra credit to Steve Wickham’s violin and Edge’s almost Spanish-guitar flourishes toward the end of the song. Ethereal.\n\n69. “MLK,” The Unforgettable Fire\n\nLike “40” on War, U2 closed this record with another hymn-cum-lullaby. The impact of a visit to the Chicago Peace Museum, transitioning “Pride” from a song about Ronald Reagan into a song about the civil rights movement and the sense of self-respect it inspired in African-Americans, mixed with the story of Bono meeting Bob Dylan for the first time, and talking about Memphis with him — all of these things created “MLK.” It’s an uplifting piece of music and a genuine tribute, even if it might have felt a bit ham-fisted back in the day. It would grow to fit its boots in the live show, most notably during the Joshua Tree tour in 1987, where the theme of the song made so much more sense.\n\n68. “Trip Through Your Wires,” The Joshua Tree\n\n“‘Trip Through Your Wires’ has that lovely loose, sloppy, throwaway side of the band that we can sometimes capture,” Adam Clayton said, and he speaks the truth. It has a groove; it genuinely swings; it feels organic and fun. The lyrics pull from that drowsy, lustful space that many of the B-sides (“Spanish Eyes,” “Luminous Times”) come from, and on the original Joshua Tree tour, it often found that rhythm. It ended up being one of the disappointments of the 2017 tour, feeling a tad plodding, and you can’t even blame the theory that an album track list (thank you, Kirsty MacColl) does not have the same concerns as a live one.\n\n67. “The Fly,” Achtung Baby\n\nEverything on “The Fly” is U2 Mark II: that gigantic industrial guitar loop, the deep bass, the offbeat percussion, and, of course, the Fly himself. The now-infamous retro sunglasses were the key to Bono finding the voice, both lyrically and vocally, giving him a freedom to not be “Bono” and to reach out for a different dynamic and temperament, to not have to be so earnest and heroic, but rather to slip into another persona. “The way I saw ‘The Fly’ was like a crank call from hell … but the guy likes it there,” Bono said. “Look, I gotta go,” the Fly says. “I’m running outta change.”\n\n66. “Hallelujah, Here She Comes,” B-side to “Desire” / Best of 1980–1990\n\nA little bit of Irish gospel that didn’t make the cut, but it has bones! The organ in the background, courtesy of none other than Billy Preston, should have elevated this track off of the cutting-room floor, but, alas. “Born and raised on the wrong side of town / You get so high you can’t come down,” Bono sings. It is evocative and memorable.\n\n65. “Iris (Hold Me Close),” Songs of Innocence\n\nBono has written about his mother since the very early days of U2 — “I Will Follow” is directly about her death and its impact on him at the age of 14 — and by extension, Bono becoming Bono is directly a result of the impact of that loss on him. “Iris” is, however, a song from today, the grown-up Bono reflecting back. It is almost a frayed nerve end, and will make anyone who’s lost a parent at any age get a bit misty.\n\n64. “Heartland,” Rattle and Hum\n\n“Heartland” is the soundtrack to hundreds of miles of America, as seen through a tour-bus window for the first time, or through renting a car and driving through the Southwest and trying to understand this impossible, incredible place. It was written during the Joshua Tree sessions, but shelved in place of “Trip Through Your Wires,” which makes sense — but it absolutely fits here, another piece of the story of figuring out America between what you think you know and what the reality is. It is a gorgeous ode to the concept that Bono would later articulate as “America is not just a country, but an idea.” It is sweet and wistful and sounds like how it feels to drive your car on a forgotten interstate. It is not an accident that it’s the song playing in the background when U2 make their way down to the Mississippi in Rattle and Hum.\n\n63. “Discothèque,” Pop\n\nIs this “Where the Streets Have No Name” or “New Year’s Day”? No, but it has a good beat and you can dance to it, and the video is hilarious: pouting Larry, Adam with a giant disco ball over his crotch, and major homoeroticism between Edge and Bono. A lengthy book could be written about the disaster that was Pop and the subsequent tour, but this track, at least, is a good bit of fun.\n\n62. “Your Blue Room,” Passengers — Original Soundtracks I\n\nGorgeously twisted, it’s a mix of “Space Oddity” and Blue Velvet. They actually tried playing it in stadiums a half-dozen or so times on the 360° tour, which is insane to even consider.\n\n61. “No Line on the Horizon,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nThis record expanded the songwriting cadre to include Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, and you can definitely feel their involvement stretching the edges of U2. The delicate impressionism of the title track is about dreams and escape, and you can hear it.\n\nThere was an early alternate version of the track that came out on the B-side of “Get on Your Boots” that is vastly different, heavier, more rhythmic, and in many ways better. But it clearly didn’t fit the vibe the band was going for.\n\n60. “Love Rescue Me,” Rattle and Hum\n\nThe song’s backstory is how it earned its place on the album: Bono woke up one morning with a song in his head, but he wasn’t sure if it was one of his songs, or one of Bob Dylan’s songs. So he calls Bob and goes to his house in Malibu, where he sings the song to Dylan. Dylan says, “No, it’s not one of mine — but it could be,” and the two of them collaborate to finish the lyrics. One of the five songs recorded in five hours at Sun Studios, the Memphis Horns are the best part of the song, transforming it into countrified soul; Dylan is singing background vocals somewhere in the mix, and there’s allegedly a version with lead vocals that wasn’t used, so there was no conflict with the Traveling Wilburys. It’s the flip side, really, of “Hawkmoon 269,” the dressed-up-for-church version. It’s not a bad song by any means, but there were stronger contenders that ended up as B-sides. You can’t put a co-write with Bob Dylan on a B-side.\n\n59. “Gone,” Pop\n\nIt’s hard to be a rock band and write a song about what it’s like to be in a rock band without sounding either ungrateful or oblivious. “Gone” comes really close to the mark, and although the band are hard on this particular number, it’s presented with enough honesty and lack of coyness to make it worthwhile. “Then you discover what you thought was freedom is just greed,” Bono sings at the end, as the band are about to go off on a tour they’re not ready for to support an album they all believe is not finished, with one of the most elaborate stage sets of all time. Maybe someone should have paid attention to the lyrics. The song came back during the Elevation tour, usually dedicated to the late Michael Hutchence, and in an arena, the song has an intimacy it couldn’t possibly achieve in the colossus of PopMart.\n\n58. “I Threw a Brick Through a Window,” October\n\nThe difference between the album version and the live version of this track is dramatic. On record, it’s interesting rhythmically, but feels lugubrious and stiff. This isn’t surprising when you learn that Larry Mullen could not get through the tempo and came back one day to find that the Edge had overdubbed the drums. But live, this track is electric and cathartic, U2 building a sonic space that others would later try to duplicate but never succeed in doing. And, more importantly, the freedom of the expanded space makes it easier to instinctively understand what story Bono was trying to tell — because that’s exactly what the song is about, an action that creates space where there was none before. It’s the story of punk rock. “I THREW A BRICK! I THREW A BRICK!” Bono would cry out back in the day, and the hair would stand up on the back of your neck.\n\n57. “All Because of You,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\n“A love song to the Who” is how Bono introduced this the day U2 played underneath the Brooklyn Bridge. It’s also a song about origins, and mothers, and the divine female — and sure, fine, good. But listen to the Edge peeling Townshend-ian riffs off of his guitar, Larry hitting the drums with crisp precision, Adam playing a secondary melody, and it can just be a love song to rock and roll.\n\n56. “Zoo Station,” Achtung Baby\n\nThe sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree, the sound of the Berlin Wall coming down, the sound of a train coming out of a tunnel into the sunlight of another country — “Zoo Station” is all of those things. It is U2 inviting you to get on that train with them and run away. Inside the train is the Berlin of Bowie and Iggy, the Berlin of Isherwood, the Berlin split in two and reunited again. “When people put on the record, we wanted their first reaction to be either ‘This record is broken,’ or, ‘This can’t be the new U2 record, there’s been a mistake,’” Adam Clayton said. “Zoo Station” is astonishing, jaw-dropping, and ecstatic.\n\n55. “When Love Comes to Town,” Rattle and Hum\n\nB. B. King: “I’m no good with chords, so what we do is get somebody else to play that.”\n\nBono: “Well, Edge will do that; there’s not that many chords in the song, there’s only two.”\n\nThe presence of this song — that U2 would dare to want to collaborate with B. B. King! — upset so much of the Establishment. But it sure seems like everyone involved in the song was having a good ol’ time here.\n\n54. “Sweetest Thing,” 1980–1990\n\nIt’s a compact little love ditty, written because Bono missed his wife’s birthday while working on The Joshua Tree. “Sweetest Thing” didn’t fit the record (it ended up as the B-side to “Where the Streets Have No Name”), and then was dusted off and rerecorded in 1998 for the leadoff single on the greatest-hits compilation The Best, 1980–1990. It’s innocuous enough, but what bumps it up a bracket is the video made to promote it, featuring Bono and what seems like half of Dublin coming out to support him in currying favor with a lady, played by Ali Hewson herself (in exchange for the single’s royalties being donated to her favorite charity, the Chernobyl Children’s Project). The video features: Irish boy band Boyzone, male strippers dressed as firefighters, a boys’ marching band, a string quartet, an elephant, a chef (played by Bono’s brother Norman), skywriting, street banners, and the remaining members of U2. Watch for the moment when Bono removes his glasses for extra emphasis at the “A blue-eyed boy / Meets a brown-eyed girl” line.\n\n53. “Numb,” Zooropa\n\nThe Edge gets another solo outing, writing and performing it, with visits from Bono singing in his “Fat Lady” falsetto. He called it “the sound of the inside of somebody’s head,” an accurate characterization of this almost Kraftwerk-ian composition, which also contains a healthy dose of humor — all of which can be seen in the hilarious video for the song.\n\n52. “Exit,” The Joshua Tree\n\nSometimes the muses lead you in a direction you don’t expect, or anticipate: the darkness and evil in works by authors such as Flannery O’Connor, Truman Capote, and of course, Norman Mailer, whose The Executioner’s Song was the nominal influence for “Exit.” The song isn’t a retelling of any one story, but rather an examination of the forces that drove the people or characters those authors wrote about. “Exit” is a roller coaster of emotions, pinned down by Adam Clayton’s heartbeat bass in formation with Mullen’s drumming picking up the pulse — there is so much masterful precision going on — and then Edge’s guitar slipping by like wisps of fog until it explodes in violent intensity, Bono’s vocals walking a line between observer and participant.\n\nBut when you invoke the muses, there is sometimes a cost. “Exit” would let the band exorcise their demons, but then Bono slipped and fell early on during a performance of the song, badly damaging his shoulder and causing him to perform the rest of the tour in a sling (you can see it in the video of “Trip Through Your Wires”). Later, the man who murdered actress Rebecca Schaeffer in 1989 would claim that he was inspired by the song. All of the above likely contributed to the disappearance of the track in the band’s live set once the Joshua Tree tour was over, until the announcement in 2017 of the 40th-anniversary tour. This time out, Bono took off his glasses, donned some eyeliner and a costume change, and created a character he referred to as “Shadow Man” for the performances of the song, which was both masterful and breathtaking. But the real hero of the track in 2017 was the Edge, whose fury on guitar went above and beyond.\n\n51. “Holy Joe,” B-side of “Discothèque”\n\nIn the oddest, most perverse product placement, this was the song chosen to debut Pop to the media at a press event held inside a Kmart in New York City. It would end up as the B-side to “Discothèque,” but otherwise never show its face again, for reasons only known to the band. This sly, incisive scorcher should’ve found its place on Pop.\n\n50. “Silver and Gold,” Rattle and Hum\n\nWhen Keith Richards somehow refrains from planting his boot up your ass for confessing that you not only don’t know the blues, you “object to it,” you go home and write this in penance. And then, somehow, Bono managed to charm Ricahrds and Ron Wood into recording the track with him, which appeared on the Sun City album in all its overwrought vocal glory.\n\nU2 recorded it during The Joshua Tree sessions, where it ended up in the outtake pile, even though in many ways it is better than the version that appeared on Sun City. The Sun City version absolutely has its moments (with Keith Richards hitting some very Keith Richards chords), but it is mostly a mess in a “Dylan shows up to Live Aid with Ron Wood and Keith and the three of them make damn fools of themselves” kind of way. The studio version, on the other hand, is compact, taut, focused, and takes no prisoners. The moment when both Larry and Edge explode after the second chorus is priceless, and Bono’s vocals are far more believable now that he’s not trying to imitate a 70-year-old black sharecropper.\n\nFinally, there’s the explosive live version that showed up on Rattle and Hum — except Bono had to offer that sarcastic, “Okay, Edge, play the blues,” which was just fuel to the fire for the critics who didn’t pick up on the sarcasm and thought the band were too full of themselves.\n\n49. “The Wanderer,” Zooropa\n\nIt’s like Johnny Cash showed up at the Star Wars cantina as himself. Adam’s bass sounds like the music in a bad video game. That might sound like a bad thing, but it works: This ancient bard showing up at the end of the world to tell the tales of his travels, in the deepest world-weary, gravelly voice.\n\n48. “She’s a Mystery to Me,” B-side to “All Because of You” single\n\nWritten by Bono and Edge for none other than Roy Orbison, it fits him so well that it’s as though it was written for him by request, except it wasn’t. Like many of Bono’s song ideas, this is another one that came in a dream. He had fallen asleep listening to the soundtrack to the film Blue Velvet, and when he woke up, was sure the song in his head was from the CD. When he discovered that it wasn’t, he wrote it down and played it later that day during sound check. After the show, guess who arrived backstage unannounced?\n\n47. “The Crystal Ballroom,” Songs of Innocence (vinyl only)\n\nThe most important song on the album … gets left off the album, is only available as a bonus track on the vinyl release, and is only played three times on tour. “The Crystal Ballroom” is about the place where Bono’s parents met and used to go dancing, and where, later, U2 played as a young band. The song is written from the perspective of that young Bono imagining his parents, specifically his mother, dancing together and watching him play. “Everyone’s here with me tonight / Everyone but you” is heartbreaking.\n\n46. “Unknown Caller,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nYou hear the sounds of birds, recorded in Morocco? It’s the morning after “Moment of Surrender,” our hero hanging onto the universe by his fingernails (to paraphrase Bono), when he starts to get messages from his phone. “Are they a conscience, is it a crank, or is it God?” Bono wrote in the album’s liner notes. He knows the answer, because of the 3:33 reference; on the cover of All That You Can’t Leave Behind, the clock reads J3:33, and Bono explained, “That’s Jeremiah 3:33. The Scripture is ‘Call unto me and I will answer you.’ It’s celestial telephony.” The last minute-and-a-half of the song is a glorious instrumental interlude between organ, French horn, and a moving, lyrical solo from the Edge. Like “Moment of Surrender,” there is a serendipitous manifestation of energy between band and audience when it’s performed live. You don’t write lines like, “Go, shout it out, rise up,” if you don’t want to hear them sung in unison by a large group of people.\n\n45. “A Room at the Heartbreak Hotel,” B-side to “Angel in Harlem” / Best of 1980–1990\n\nThe Edge called it “gospel meets Suicide,” which pretty much sums it up: It is both uplifting and terrifying. One of the better Elvis-themed U2 songs, it still doesn’t quite meet the mark, despite the backing vocals, horn refrain, and Link Wray-esque reverberating guitar, all in service of name-checking the mystery train. You have to wonder what this could have been had they tried to take it up a notch.\n\n44. “The First Time,” Zooropa\n\nJust when you think the record is going to be enjoyable, but not classic, “The First Time” shows up. Bono said he had been listening to a lot of Al Green, and wanted to write a song about faith, or rather, the loss of faith, or the struggle not to lose it. The prodigal son returns home, but it’s not a happy ending. Bono invokes John 14:2 — ”In my father’s house, there are many mansions” — but then says, “But I left by the back door / And I threw away the key.” It’s a quiet but intense song.\n\n43. “Mothers of the Disappeared,” The Joshua Tree\n\nBono wrote this song inspired by the movement of Argentinian mothers demanding justice for their missing children. It is not a rock song; it is almost proto-electronic in feel, anchored by a drum loop Eno put through a processor, with a Spanish guitar line along the top. The drum loop, despite the processing, feels organic when it ties into the lyrics: “We hear their heartbeat,” and it feels like one, albeit in the distance. Bono doesn’t sing so much as chant, and then he veers into keening, as though he is giving voice to the mothers’ grief. It is a very nonlinear song, but in the progression of side two of the album, the steps from “One Tree Hill” to “Exit” to “Mothers of the Disappeared” are not that far removed. It is a difficult song to get right in a live setting, which is why it did not appear on set lists with any great regularity until 2017, where it became both respite after the emotional crescendo of the record and a highlight of the tour.\n\n42. “Wake Up Dead Man,” Pop\n\nInstead of ending this record with a hymn, U2 ends it with a prayer. Contextually, if you follow the arc of the album, this is literally the only place they could have arrived at, praying for guidance in the blackness and desperation. The key to the song are the two ringing guitar chords in the chorus, which are a reveille calling out to God and to the disciple who’s lost faith.\n\n41. “Luminous Times (Hold Onto Love),” B-side to “With or Without You” single\n\nDominated by piano and percussion, it’s another one of the ecstatic odes to one’s beloved that was the undercurrent during the Joshua Tree studio sessions. It feels improvisational, but that’s more due to the stream-of-consciousness vocal style Bono adopts in the service of mirroring the breathlessness of the lyrics. It’s a moment.\n\n40. “Until the End of the World,” Achtung Baby\n\nWritten for the most underrated Wim Wenders film, “Until the End of the World” is the sound of the snake slithering up the tree in the Garden of Eden after getting Eve to take a bite of the apple. It is a conversation between Jesus and Judas. It is about the sharpest, deepest betrayal, but the twist comes at the end: “I reached out for the one I tried to destroy / You, you said you’d wait / Till the end of the world.” Ultimately, forgiveness triumphs. The noise behind the lyrics is enormous and overpowering, embodying the pain of disloyalty, both for the person committing the bad act and the one suffering from it.\n\n39. “Sometimes You Can’t Make It on Your Own,” How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\n\nThere is so much love, regret, and gratitude in this song, written about Bono’s father. In the last verse, Bono’s voice soars with just the tiniest crack of sadness: “Can you hear me when I sing / You’re the reason I sing / You’re the reason why the opera is in me.”\n\n38. “Stay (Faraway, So Close),” Zooropa\n\nThis song began its life as something Bono and Edge were working on for Frank Sinatra, and you can envision that in the lyrics of the first verse. The second verse feels like Berlin, and the third verse links to Zoo TV — “With satellite television you can go anywhere.” During the Zooropa sessions, Wim Wenders came to the band, needing a song for a new movie about angels who want to become mortal and live on Earth. “Just the bang and the clatter as an angel runs to ground,” and Larry Mullen hits the edge of the snare drum. Boom. It sounds disjointed, but it works together, and is perfect for the movie. It almost doesn’t fit on the album.\n\n37. “Moment of Surrender,” No Line on the Horizon\n\nBono creates this vast and vivid landscape in “Moment of Surrender” laden with multiple layers "
