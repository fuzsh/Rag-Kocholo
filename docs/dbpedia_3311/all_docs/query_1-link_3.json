'They have made brilliant music and they possess a unique kind of integrity and social conscience. I'm delighted that they are being so cooperative, and I think this exhibit will be a special treat for their fans.'\n\nExploring U2's journey from formation at school in Dublin the exhibit will include the first U2 T-shirt (made in a school art class), a bio of the Hype (one of the band's early names), rejection letters from two record companies, a trophy from a 1978 battle of the bands, Bono's first guitar, and posters from early club shows in Dublin.\n\nAs well as two dozen pieces of clothing, going back to outfits from the 1983 War tour to costumes from U2's most recent tours and videos, the exhibit will include instruments from all band members, stage set designs, personal correspondence and video and animation cells. The Museum also has a large collection of artifacts from the band that have been on loan to the Museum since it opened in 1995, as well as costumes from Bono featured in the Rock Style exhibit in 2000.\n\nFrom February until May the fourth floor will feature an exhibit of U2 photographs by Anton Corbijn taken between the early 1980s and today. From June through September, the fourth floor will house an exhibit dedicated to the 'look' of U2 over the years, including artwork from longtime designer Steve Averill.\n\nMuch more here\n\nwww.rockhall.com"
