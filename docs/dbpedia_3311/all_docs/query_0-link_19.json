The Freedom of Zooropa is awarded to Willie Mannion and Rob Kirwan. Special thanks to Ellen Darst and Gavin Friday.\n\nZooropa was U2's 9th album. The album was started in March 1993 as an EP. U2 were on a break in between legs of the worldwide Zoo TV tour, and they wanted to release a short collection of new songs, having mined Achtung Baby of singles. Recording went well, and before they knew it they had a collection of 10 songs which made up the album. Even more suprising was the start they had on several other songs which would not appear until 1997's Pop Album. You can see evidence of these in the cover of Zooropa, where the words, \"Wake Up De\", \"ET Dress\", and \"Iss Me Kill M\" speak of three songs worked on during these sessions that would appear later, \"Wake Up Dead Man\", \"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\" and \"Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me\".\n\nThe covers for the album were designed by Works Associates. Recording in the middle of the tour, the sleeve of the album was left in the hands of the desgin team, and was going for a feeling of saturation and hyper reality. They were given an early track listing so that they could play with computerized treatments of the lettering for the cover. Alternate ttitles worked on for cover designs included \"Dog\" and \"God U2 Dog\".\n\nThe album, a suprise for a band in the midst of a world tour, went on to be quite sucessful. It spawned three commercial singles, and remains an album that is spoken highly of by many U2 fans."
