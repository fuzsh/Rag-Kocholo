        "text": "Zooropa.\n\nIt's not just my favourite U2 album, it's one of my favourite albums by anyone ever. I understand why its divisive and some people hate U2. This decade of the 90's was the one where U2 were brave, bold, unafraid to do something stupid, and followed their muse. They had more money than God*, and could be anything they wanted creatively. Why, in a world where you can be anything would you want to be boring? U2 certainly weren't at this point. But it's a long long way from The Electric Co., and The Joshua Tree.\n\nAs already mentioned, this was meant to be an EP, but became an album. At the tine the tour was announced Zooropa was just the outdoor leg of Zoo TV Europe.. anyway, with The Edge now separated from his wife and with some spare time, he burrowed himself into work and started assembling new songs which became an album. U2 had one album left on their new contract with Island signed in around 1986, and Island weren't expecting a new record until 1995 or so.. however, McGuiness announced a new U2 album to Island, midtour, with the unexpected news that the contract was now up and the band could solicit new offers from new labels. A very clever move, and U2 re-signed to Island mid Zoo tour at their peak with a very beneficial deal financially. Though that wasn't the motive for the album - I think amongst other things its that the band had started to tire of the same setlist and wanted to introduce new songs into the set.\n\nZooropa is, for me, their best work. Free of commercial considerations, and making the decisions to avoid the treadmill of single, the album has three singles but only one that was available worldwide. \"Numb\" was a preview for the album and only commercially released on VHS. \"Lemon\" was a remix single only released commercially in a small number of countries, and \"Stay\" was the only single which saw a widespread release. With this in mind, U2 wrote whatever they felt like rather than feeling the pressure to generate hits, and this album was the last time the band operated quickly and instinctively. Everything after this the band operated thoughtfully, slowly, carefully, and overthought everything. This was the last time U2 felt their art, and opposed to thought.\n\nThe whole album is also very loose in theme and ideas. Though lyrically the whole album is almost post-sexual, with ideas like love, lust, desire, and so on are almost redundant at this point for the band, so they're able to explore other ideas rather than romance and companionship without the need to write a love song. And I know \"The First Time\" is a love song, but it's more of a biblical ode to a deity than a song about a woman.\n\nThe band never nailed a live version of \"Zooropa\" in 1993 - they tended to play only the last parts of the song. The last part of the title track (\"And I have no compass...\") does feel like a slight shift of gear and style, and was recorded at a soundcheck in an early part of the 1993 tour. \"Babyface\" was another song they struggled to play live, with Bono never able to find the right level to sing - alternating between the high and low registers in a way that was somewhat painful.\n\n\"Numb\" is a great, weird song about information overload and repression. There's a Bono vocal version, called \"Down All The Days\" that was on the Achtung Baby 10 disc mega box set in 2011.\n\n\"Lemon\" is my favourite single U2 song. The lyric is based around the only surviving film footage of Bono's mother (later used on screen in \"Iris\" on the 2015-18 tour) where she is seen wearing a lemon dress. I always thought these lyrics were about growing into adulthood and responsibility, the desire to crawl back to childhood, and the need for a belief structure :\n\n\"I feel like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under / I feel like I'm holding onto nothing\"\n\n\"And I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore / And it feels like I'm swimming out to her\"\n\n\"These are the days when our work comes asunder / these are the days when we look to something other\"\n\nThere's also \"Stay\" which was originally called \"Sinatra.\" The band had reservations around it because it was so conventional in structure and lyric.\n\nSide two is straight up weird. The band hadn't managed to finalise live arrangements of these songs until the final Aus/Nz/Japan dates in Nov-Dec 1993, so most of the Zooropa songs have not been played live much, and most of them apart from \"Numb\" and \"Stay\" less than 20 times overall. \"Zooropa\" and \"Dirty Day\" were brought back this decade for some shows, but generally Zooropa is the album that has been played the least live.\n\nThe whole album creates a weird atmosphere of disconnection from reality, where nothing is quite as it seems, and the whole thing is somehow like watching the Earth from space - like the innocent baby in the astronaut helmet on the album cover. At the time it came out I very very much felt that I didn't belong in the world I lived in in any way, and this album touched that sense effortlessly.\n\nSeveral songs that later appeared on Pop were also started in the same period (\"Wake Up Dead Man\", \"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\". \"Hold Me Thrill Me\", \"If God Will Send His Angels\", \"North And South Of The River\" etc.)\n\nFinally, this album has had a lot of remixes of it used as b-sides of other singles. Of particular mention is the somewhat groundbreaking Perfecto mix of \"Lemon.\" Which was later pitchshifted and reissued in its own right as the single \"Grace\" by Perfecto. Here's a mix I made that mashed up some of the remixes of \"Lemon\" and some of the remixes of \"Grace\"\n\nU2, Lemon In Orange (Final Mix)\n\nI bought Zooropa, when I was 17, about two days after it was released (the first time I'd done that with a U2 album). I'd been aware of them since I was a kid and had been a big fan for about two or three years by then, but this is the first one I bought in real time (I had Joshua Tree on cassette when I was 10 or something).\n\nSince I bought it under those conditions, and since I was 17, every moment of this record is etched in my brain. Back in 1993-94, I thought the record was great... I still really like it, but I don't think it has held up as well as it sounded in its day.\n\nIt's certainly a unique U2 album in many ways:\n\n-- started with Bono and Edge working from pre-prepared loops from soundchecks (resulting in 'looser', more rhythmic songs)\n\n-- recorded on free days in the middle of the ZooTV tour in Europe, giving a casualness that no U2 album would ever have again\n\n-- spontaneous decision to make it into a full-length LP instead of original EP\n\n-- lyrical themes all over the place from silly ('Some Days...') to dark-relationship drama ('Stay'; 'The First Time') to Biblical-Apocalyptic ('The Wanderer') to WTF? ('Daddy's Gonna Pay'...)\n\n-- 20% of the album doesn't have Bono lead vocals, including the lead-off single (one track has lead vocals by a non-member of U2!)\n\n-- has no guitar-driven anthems or inspirational choruses that could work in stadiums\n\nFor these reasons, Zooropa is the U2 album that people who hate U2 often say they like. We should give the band enormous credit for pushing themselves to put out something new and different -- again! -- after seemingly re-inventing themselves only a year and a half earlier. And they pulled it off, as Zooropa sold multi-millions and got great reviews. It also benefited (again, in a way no subsequent U2 album has ever been able to) from being seen as a \"minor\" album that was more like a tour-addendum than a major release, so the weight of expectation was nothing (indeed, as I remember, Zooropa's existence as an album was only announced a few weeks before it was released). Although the lyrical content is all over the place, the music on the album really hangs together, for me, and it all seems to fit seamlessly (unlike the album to follow in 1997). Also, nothing on this record sounds \"forced\", like they worked it to death (unlike... nearly every album to follow).\n\nIn short, a minor triumph for our favorite Dubliners, even if it's a \"smaller\" album than the three ginormous ones that preceded it.\n\nSongs:\n\nZooropa\n\nWow, almost a 2-minute non-song intro! I love that intro. The proper song itself (which is two distinct 2-minute parts, the latter of which is much better) is just 'very good', not great, but some U2 fanatics seem to think it's the second coming of the messiah, for reasons I don't hear. A solid composition that's probably the closest U2 will ever get to prog-rock, albeit of an electronic nature. A cool opener, for sure, and a respectably unusual one.\n\nBabyface\n\nI dig the digital keyboard (or sequencer, or whatever it is) introduction, and the melody/vocal in the verse. However, the chorus is rather pedestrian, and its bridge back to the verse (\"How can beauty be so kind / to an ordinary guy?\") is one of the weaker/cheesier musical moments in U2 songs of this otherwise strong period. Lyrically, this song just seems really throwaway, which is either fine or an abomination, depending on what kind of U2 fan you are.\n\nNumb\n\nI love this track! It's all Edge: cool riff, vocals, lyrics. The counter melody in \"I feel numb!\" and then Bono's falsetto is thrilling. But the lyrics and deadpan delivery are the vocal highlight. Edge was amazing in this period. I love how this tracks builds in intensity and surface-noise. Listening to it tonight, it does sound kind of dated to 1993... but in a good way. 1993 was a good year\n\nLemon\n\nAgain, a lot of U2 fans (esp. from the nineties) seem to think this is a masterpiece. I don't really hear it. It's certainly interesting, in that it's basically an indie-disco song, but as a composition I find it average. Bono's falsetto refrain (\"She wore lemon!\" -- referring to his mother, of course) is good, but the changes following it are kind of melodically dull. The only part of this song that really grabs me is the Edge vocal (\"a man builds a city...\"; \"midnight is where the day begins\", etc.) and piano parts. Edge to the rescue again. The song really should end at 4:30 or 5:00, but they drag it out way too long, which does try my patience a bit.\n\nStay (Faraway, So Close)\n\nThe 5-star classic. Just an absolutely perfect song. This recording is perfection -- big melody, awesome vocals, perfect production. When they played it live with the full-band, it was amazing. When they played it stripped-down (like in 2001) with just Bono and Edge on acoustic guitar, it was amazing. It's such a strong composition that it can't go wrong. One thing I want to highlight about this track: The lyrics are INCREDIBLE. Actually, this is my choice as the single greatest U2 lyric piece ever, in their entire canon. It's probably the only U2 song that works perfectly as a poem on the printed page, regardless of music or melody. It's a very poignant lyric. (The Wim Wenders movie is great, too.)\n\nDaddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\n\nThe odd one. As with \"Lemon\", I respect that they were pushing themselves to play some looser, baggier, more rhythmic 'rock-band' songs. It's a very admirable thing, but I just don't think U2 is particularly good at it. The groove here is kind of ordinary, and as a composition it's also rather average (not to say it's bad) by U2's high standards. And what is with the lyrics? Can anyone interpret this for me...? There must be a metaphor here I'm not getting. Passable track, which does get better in its latter parts.\n\nSome Days Are Better Than Others\n\nThe second cute, funny lyric in a row. (\"Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy.\" Wow, is this really U2??) Also has a similar light, loose touch to the previous track, but with a much more pop-friendly chorus. That chorus, fortunately, is really good -- bright and catchy. I love this track! That said, as the lyric is silly and the general vibe rather lightweight, I can see why some people don't. (At least there's one \"Jesus\" reference near the end to remind us this is still U2!)\n\nThe First Time\n\nGood song. It's simple, but powerful. Any number of artists could sing this, and it'd be great. Just a very nice song. More understated than usual for U2.\n\nDirty Day\n\nFantastic composition, perhaps the 2nd best on the album. As to the track on the album, however, it can pass you by quickly without grabbing your attention. Needless to say, it rewards repeated listening. This song came to life in a big way played live, fortunately, and there's a superb rendition on the Sydney, Australia show on DVD. I think maybe U2 realized, after the fact, that this was a really good song, and if they'd recognized it sooner they'd have worked this up into something more dynamic for the record.\n\nThe Wanderer (starring Johnny Cash)\n\nAnother great composition. Johnny Cash's career had been in the toilet for several years by the time this came around, and this track marked the beginning of his resurgence into prominence. Fabulous lyrics, very evocative song. The marriage of Cash's 50s' baritone with synthesizer riffs is an odd one, but once you get past that, it's great.\n\nThey finally got around to releasing \"Slow Dancing\" on the \"Stay (Faraway So Close)\" EP, and my only complaint is that they should've put it onto Zooropa. I know it might seem discordant with disco-digital stuff, but hey they've got Johnny Cash on the album already, as well as ballads like \"The First Time\". They could have pulled it off, and then maybe dropped \"Babyface\" or whatever.\n\nSo, this is a great album -- not a classic like three of the four preceding it, but a very, very worthy release that achieved everything it set out to.\n\nThat said, U2 are generally a \"song\"-based band, and I'm very much a song-based listener, and on that rating this album is notably weaker than many others. It simply doesn't have as many strong compositions as usual. But, what I think is interesting is that if I compare this one to other U2 records that are a weaker in terms of songs (say, October and No Line on the Horizon), this one is WAY, WAY better. And the album that came next, Pop, also has individually stronger songs than this one... but, again, is somehow not as good as this one.\n\nWhy? I think this album has a playful, fun, \"light\" feeling about it that distinguishes it from other U2 albums. Musically, it seems really cohesive, probably because it was recorded quickly and without much second-guessing. It is more than the sum of its parts (while Pop, somehow, is less than the sum of them)."
