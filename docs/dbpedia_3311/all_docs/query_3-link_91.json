Someone on our team will reach out to you shortly.\n\nGeneral Questions\n\nCan I change my order?\n\nUnfortunately, we can’t change any information on an existing order once it has already been processed for shipment, including details like your shipping address, billing information, item, size, or quantity. We also cannot cancel orders after they’ve been processed.\n\nIf you haven’t yet received shipping confirmation, we may be able to process an address change or cancellation. Please reach out to us at the email listed above, select the appropriate category, and we’ll make every effort to accommodate your request!\n\nAll orders are subject to our return and exchange policies. Please note an address change or cancellation request is not guaranteed until one of our team members has confirmed your request has been processed.\n\nOnce I place an order, when will my account be charged?\n\nIf you place an order on our store, you will be charged for the full cost of your order immediately. If you see any additional pending charges on your account, please allow up to 3 business days for them to reverse.

If you’re having trouble accessing the site for any reason, please reach out to us at the email listed above and we’ll do our best to help.\n\nCan I get a different size or color than what is offered through the store?\n\nNo. If a size, color, or other variant doesn’t appear online, it is not currently available.\n\nWhat happens if you run out of stock of an item I’ve already ordered?\n\nIn rare cases when an item runs out of stock after your order is placed, we’ll contact you ASAP to exchange the affected item for another of equal value. We make every effort to ensure inventory is accurate to avoid this happening. Note that if we don’t get a response from you within 5 business days, we reserve the right to refund your order in full.\n\nIf I purchased a bundle am I able to remove an item or items from it for a refund?\n\nNo. If you order a bundle and later decide that you do not want everything included in it, you must cancel the full order for the bundle and purchase the items you do want individually.\n\nWhat is the sales tax on my order?\n\nSales tax is applied to all domestic orders. The tax is calculated based on applicable sales tax and use tax laws within each state.\n\nHow do discounts and special offers work?\n\nAnd now for some legal language: Unless otherwise specified, product prices already reflect discounts. All offers are limited to stock on hand; no rain checks or vouchers are available unless otherwise noted. Not valid after purchase, on prior purchases, gift cards, gift certificates, taxes, shipping, or handling and processing charges. Purchaser must pay applicable sales tax.

Shipping timelines on pre-orders are detailed in the product description, as well as in your confirmation email. Note that unless otherwise noted, any order that includes a pre-order item will not ship until all items are available.\n\nPlease check your confirmation email for details on when pre-order items will ship. Shipping and delivery dates on these items are not guaranteed, unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhile we make every effort to communicate accurate delivery estimates around your orders, unanticipated production delays for pre-order and limited edition items do happen. If an item in your order has been affected by a production delay, we will notify you via email as soon as possible.\n\nAnything else I should know about pre-orders?\n\nYes! If you do place a pre-order from our store, please note the following:\n\nPayment is charged immediately at checkout.\n\nIf you are ordering a pre-order item with an in-stock item, unless otherwise noted, your order will ship when the pre-order item becomes available.\n\nPre-order timelines vary based on product. Please refer to the product description for estimates on when the item you’re ordering is intended to ship.\n\nThe date listed on the product page is an estimation based on details from the merchandise provider and can vary depending upon demand.\n\nDetails regarding delays are communicated when information is provided by the vendor. If an update has not been provided, we don’t have the information readily available yet.\n\nShipping\n\nWhen will my order ship?\n\nIn most cases, excluding pre-orders, orders ship within 2-3 business days. Shipping and delivery dates aren’t guaranteed unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhen will I get tracking information?\n\nYou’ll receive tracking info as soon as your package ships, via the email you placed your order with. Make sure to check all inboxes, including your spam folder, if you can’t find your shipping confirmation. Please note it can sometimes take up to 3 days for your tracking link to update.\n\nHow long will it take for my order to arrive, once it ships?\n\nDomestic orders normally arrive within 3-7 days of shipping, unless otherwise noted. International orders normally arrive within 2-4 weeks of shipping. Please note that these orders need to pass through the customs office in your country before it will be released for final delivery, which can occasionally cause additional delays.\n\nOnce an order leaves our warehouse, carrier shipping delays may occur due to factors outside our control. We unfortunately can’t control how quickly an order arrives once it has left our warehouse. Contacting the carrier is the best way to get more insight into your package’s location and estimated delivery date.\n\nPlease note that shipping delays will occur if you provide an incorrect address at checkout.\n\nIf your package is returned to our facility due to a shipping error, we’ll reach out to you via the email address provided with your shipping information.

Shipping delays will occur if you provide an incorrect address at checkout.\n\nMy tracking says my order was delivered, but I haven’t gotten it yet. Where is it?\n\nSome carriers will mark a package as delivered before they actually deliver it. Though unusual, this can happen up to 5 days before an item is actually delivered. You can try contacting the carrier to get better insight into the delay. If you still haven’t received your package after 5 days, and you’ve checked with your neighbors and still don’t have it, please reach out to us at the email listed above and we’ll do our best to help!\n\nMy order is shipping to a country outside of the United States. Will I have to pay customs/import fees to receive my order?\n\nDepending on your country, you may be charged customs/import fees. Customs charges and fees are the sole responsibility of the purchaser; we are not responsible for any additional customs charges or fees once your package has left our facility.\n\nCustoms fees are calculated based on the contents of each package. If an order arrives via multiple packages, customs fees will not increase but rather be collected upon import of each parcel.\n\nIf customs fees and charges are refused at the time of delivery, your order will be returned to us. Once we receive your package, we can refund you for your purchase. If you are unfamiliar with customs fees and charges, please contact your local postal or customs office for more information.\n\nReturns & Exchanges\n\nHow do I begin the process of returning my order for a refund or an exchange?\n\nPlease contact our team by emailing us at the email listed above before shipping your package to us.

Partial refunds will not be provided for items within a bundle unless there is verified damage to that item.\n\nWho pays for my return?\n\nYou will cover the cost of return shipping, except in any case where we are responsible for the cause of the return or exchange (see “Damaged, Incorrect, or Incomplete Orders”).\n\nHow long will it take for me to get a refund on my returned item?\n\nPlease allow 3-5 business days for your item to be processed. Refunds typically take 2-3 business days to appear in your account once they’ve been processed, but can occasionally take up to 10 business days.\n\nDamaged, Incorrect, or Incomplete Orders\n\nWhat do I do if my order arrived damaged, incorrect, or incomplete?\n\nIf your item arrived damaged, or you received an incorrect item, we’ll need photos to verify the damage and/or to confirm which incorrect item was shipped.

This will typically vary once the product is created and shipped out.\n\nFeel free to reach out to our team if you feel that the product you received differs greatly from the digital mock-up on the store. Be sure to send a photo or two so our team can see the difference to better help you.\n\nDigital Downloads\n\nHow do I access my digital album?\n\nTo access your files on an iOS device, you’ll need to first download to a desktop computer and then transfer the files to your device.

Pre-sale codes have no cash value and are non-transferable, case-sensitive, and good for one-time use only.\n\nHow do I get a pre-sale access code?\n\nGetting ticket pre-sale access through the store is typically limited to fans who buy a particular product, or who place an order at a certain time.

If it still does not work, please contact us ASAP and we’ll do our best to help!\n\nWhat is the refund policy for orders containing pre-sale ticket access?\n\nAll pre-sale access sales are final. There will be no refunds, exchanges, or name transfers under any circumstances.
