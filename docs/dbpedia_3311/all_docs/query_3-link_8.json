        "text": "Label Guide: Island\n\nIsland Records was founded by Chris Blackwell and Graeme Goodall in 1959 in Jamaica. The company relocated to the UK in 1962 and its early focus was on Jamaican reggae music before the label became a major player in the progressive rock scene of the late 1960s.\n\nWhen Chris Blackwell decided in 1967 to diversify the label into new British rock music, he scored an immediate success by signing Art (later Spooky Tooth) and Traffic. Soon the label was the home for some of the best-selling British progressive acts as Jethro Tull, Emerson Lake & Palmer, King Crimson, and Free. This highly influential and successful era culmitates in the 'pink Island' years from 1967 to 1975.\n\nIsland also did groundbreaking work with psychedelic folk-rock acts like Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, spearheaded by Chris Blackwell's personal friendship with American producer Joe Boyd. Singer-Songwriters as Cat Stevens and John Martyn added to the label's success in the acoustic field.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Island became the world's top reggae label with artists like Bob Marley, Steel Pulse and Toots & The Maytals on its roster. Bob Marley became the label's best-selling act.\n\nIn July 1989, Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram and Island was no longer an independent company. In 1998 all of the Polygram and associated labels were purchased by Seagrams, and Island Records is now a subsidiary of Universal Music Group."
