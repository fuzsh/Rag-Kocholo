        "text": "Island Records is a frontline record label owned by Universal Music Group, currently led out of New York by President Darcus Beese.\n\nIsland was founded in July, 1959 by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall, and Leslie Kong in Jamaica, with a particular focus on music and artists emerging in the Caribbean.\n\nThe label’s first big success story was the track My Boy Lollipop, recorded by Jamaican teenager Millie Small, which became a No.2 hit for Island in the UK in 1964, and a No.1 in the Republic Of Ireland. (Small’s My Boy Lollipop also reached No.2 on the Billboard Hot 100, via Smash Records.)\n\nIn 1962, London-born Blackwell moved back to the UK, and began building Island into a label famed for importing Jamaican music into the market.\n\nFrom there, Blackwell began signing local acts in Britain in the sixties, including the likes of John Martyn, Fairport Convention and Free, and later, Roxy Music, King Crimson, Sparks, Traffic, Cat Stevens and Steve Winwood.\n\nIsland kept up its close association with Jamaican reggae music through signings such as Toots & The Maytals, Jimmy Cliff and, perhaps the quintessential Island Records act, Bob Marley.\n\nMarley initially signed to Island as part of The Wailers, whose first album for the label, Catch a Fire, was released in April 1973.\n\nAfter The Wailers disbanded in 1974, Marley recorded a string of classic records for Island as ‘Bob Marley & The Wailers’, including 1977’s Exodus, 1978’s Kaya and 1980’s Uprising.\n\nAfter Marley’s death in 1981, some thought the label would flounder, but Island’s next huge global act was already in its ranks: U2, who signed to Island in March 1980, went on to help define the next few decades of the company.\n\nChris Blackwell sold Island Records (alongside publishing company Island Music) in July 1989 to the UK-based PolyGram Group, which paid Â£180 million (US$300 million) for the firms.\n\nPolyGram would later become merged into Universal Music Group, after Seagram acquired the UK-based company for $10.6bn in 1998.\n\nToday, Island Records artists include the likes of Demi Lovato, Shawn Mendes, Mike Posner, Jessie Reyez and Sigrid."
