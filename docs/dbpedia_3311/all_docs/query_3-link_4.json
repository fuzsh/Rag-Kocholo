        "text": "For the last two months we haven't been able to escape music journalists genuflecting before Chris Blackwell's marvellous label. But aside from newspaper features toasting Island's 50th birthday, what is most irksome about this dewy-eyed fawning is the misleading nature of the anniversary. Island has simply not been Island for at least the last 20 years. It has been like any other major label.\n\nOK, before you rush to stone me, let me first say how much I love the classic period of Island. As a former A&R man, how could I not admire Chris Blackwell's original recognition that performers need time to become good. \"Artist development\" is now pretty much an exhausted cliche used by all record companies, but Island pioneered it and were often proven right: Free's first hit did not come until their third album, Bob Marley didn't cross over until his sixth album and U2's October sold so badly that any other label would have dropped them.\n\nIsland's golden age, as anyone who watched this weekend's BBC4 documentary, Keep On Running, will know, was roughly the 20 years from Traffic's debut single in 1967 to U2's Joshua Tree in 1987. After that, and particularly because of the massive success of Bono and co, Island became pretty much like any other major label, with sales targets, big overheads and corporate responsibility to a large staff. If artists weren't having hits, what was the point of keeping them? They were dead weight.\n\nAs with all corporate creative businesses that need constant success to survive, this brutal approach became short-termist. Instead of the pioneering signings of the 60s and 70s like Dr Strangely Strange, the Slits or Grace Jones, there were And Why Not?, Claytown Troupe, Top, Nomad Soul, Dead Dog Inc, Hinda Hicks and a host of others it would be too depressing to list. Even the acts you might have heard of like Sheep On Drugs, Tripping Daisy or In Tua Nua are notable by their absence from the £30 hardback tome celebrating Island's 50 years.\n\nOf course, it's unfair to start listing failures when there is so much to admire about Island. OK, it did have some critical and commercial success in the 90s like PJ Harvey, the Cranberries, Tricky and Pulp, and it would be a sorry label indeed that did not produce at least a few victories in 10 years.\n\nThese signings had at least been made under Blackwell's watchful eye despite having sold the label to PolyGram in 1989. But when he finally relinquished his board directorship in 1997, any trace of the maverick spirit departed. Even the otherwise hagiographic documentary mentions the dark period after he left. But to claim that Island's mojo is now back is presumptuous in the extreme – what have Sugababes, Keane and the Feeling got to do with artist development? They were all successful from the start.\n\nAmy Winehouse does at least display some of the ska-loving unpredictable spirit of old Island but tellingly, unlike the queue of dewy-eyed interviewees in the documentary, she shares no sentimentality about the label and jokes about her confusion in thinking the A&R man who signed her came from Ireland.\n\nWhat perhaps best demonstrates why Island is now merely an imprint of Universal (which PolyGram became a part of in 1999) is what U2 have done on their current album. Discovering that their trusted marketing man had been promoted within Universal to Mercury, U2 demanded that he be kept on their team. So the band who were once so loyal to Island that they refused to take royalties knowing it would bankrupt the label are now happy flying the Mercury Records flag on No Line On the Horizon."
