        "text": "Well. U2 have finally unveiled the preliminary details for the Achtung Baby box set, and it's particularly insane.\n\nOf the five formats available for this set, most of them could be predicted. You have your single-disc remaster, a two-disc edition featuring B-sides and remixes and a quadruple-vinyl set featuring Achtung Baby and its remixes and B-sides. Fine enough.\n\nThen we have the big box set. Well, two versions of the big box set. At the heart of each is 10 discs - six CDs and four DVDs - that include Achtung Baby, its 1993 follow-up Zooropa, B-sides, remixes and outtakes from each record and what appears to be some sort of an alternate version of Achtung Baby on the sixth CD, plus music videos, a new documentary on Achtung (From the Sky Down), the Zoo TV concert from Sydney and more. That 10-disc set is available in two versions: one in a box with a 84-page hardback book and 16 art prints, and one that includes all that plus stickers, badges, a copy of the band's official magazine, Propaganda, the Achtung Baby album and selected singles on vinyl and - the piece du insane resistance - a pair of Bono's trademark \"The Fly\" sunglasses. All of that comes in a \"magnetic, puzzle-tiled box\" and can be yours for the spine-shattering price of $447 and change (per Universal's U.K. page).\n\nI can't wait to read everyone's two cents on this one.
