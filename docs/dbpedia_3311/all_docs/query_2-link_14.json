        "text": "U2‘s 1993 8th studio album ‘ZOOROPA’ just turned 30 years old.\n\nU2 is celebrating the 30th anniversary of their Grammy-winning album Zooropa with a special release of a limited edition transparent yellow vinyl pressing. The album was originally released in July 1993. The new vinyl pressing will be out in October.\n\nTo promote the release, U2 will be hosting a special global livestream next week on July 12 and 13. It will be on ZOO TV, live from Sydney on July 12th at 12pm Pacific time. The countdown to the stream is here. You can preorder the vinyl here.\n\nOn September 29, U2 will kick off their long-awaited live show, titled U2:UV Achtung Baby Live At The Sphere. The tour will start with a run of shows in Las Vegas. You can purchase tickets here if you want to go.\n\nJuly 5, 2023, Official Release Date\n\nJuly 5, 2023, is the official date of the 30th anniversary of the release of U2’s eighth studio album, Zooropa. The album, produced by Brian Eno, Flood & The Edge, was a continuation of the band’s previous work incorporating electronica and dance music influences into their sound.\n\nThey recorded the follow-up to Achtung Baby during a break in the band’s Zoo TV Tour. The band’s experiences on tour provided the inspiration.\n\nUpon its release, Zooropa was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one in the United States and the United Kingdom. It spawned the singles: “Numb”, “Lemon”, “Stay (Faraway, So Close!)”, and “The Wanderer” starring Johnny Cash. In 1994 the album won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\nFirst Single – “Numb”\n\nThe first single from the album was The Edge-led, monotone & mostly spoken word “Numb”. The song, originally recorded during the Achtung Baby sessions, initially, was not a band favorite. The music video for the song was a fan favorite and a staple on MTV. It featured The Edge staring straight into the camera sitting under a dripping tap, while strange things happened to him. He had cigarette smoke blown in his face, feet shoved all over his face, and kids slapping him. (video below)\n\nIn the years since its release, critics have praised Zooropa for its innovative sound and its exploration of themes of media saturation, globalization, and the future of the world. It has also been cited as one of U2’s best albums and has been included on numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time. Although the record was one of the band’s most creative works, the band themselves regard it with mixed feelings.\n\nSince its release 30 years ago, Zooropa has sold over 7 million albums worldwide.\n\n[Source Pulse.com, shopu2.com, themusic.com.au]\n\nU2: Their 50 Best Songs, Ranked\n\nU2 has been one of the biggest bands of the past 50 years and for good reason: Their catalog is a prime example of a band evolving and growing up before the eyes of the world.\n\nSo far, U2 has released 14 studio albums. Their catalog also features live releases, box sets, compilations and more. In total, they have sold over 175 million records worldwide.\n\nThe legend of U2 had humble beginnings. Its four members — Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. — were all students at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin.\n\nOne day in 1976, Mullen Jr. put a flyer on the school’s bulletin board searching for musicians to start a band. He was only 14 at the time. Among the people who responded were Bono (16), The Edge (15) and Clayton (16). The band’s first practice was on September 25, 1976 in the kitchen of Mullen Jr.’s childhood home.\n\nRELATED: The Edge: 'Of Course Bono Gets Too Much For Me Sometimes!'\n\nWho would’ve thought all of this success started with a just simple post on a bulletin board and a practice in a kitchen?!\n\nU2’s list of accolades is nothing short of insane. They’ve won 22 Grammy Awards out of 46 nominations. In 2005, they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The band received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2022.\n\nIn addition to those awards, they’ve been a massive tour draw. Per Pollstar, U2 has sold over 26 million tickets since 1980. Their tours have grossed a staggering $2.12 million. The only other act to make more money on the road is the Rolling Stones with $2.16 million.\n\nWith all of this mind, we thought we’d take on the daunting task of ranking U2’s best song. Scroll through the list below to see which songs from their vast catalog we think are their 50 best!\n\nCatch Brent Porche on-air and online weekdays between 3PM – 7PM on WMMR.
