        "text": "We are five sisters from Northern California. We grew up in a Catholic, homeschooled family of eleven kids (yes, we have 5 brothers and another sister!) in a small town with zero connections to the music industry. Our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing and play the piano when we were really young.\n\nWe started our band in 2007 when we were teenagers and preteens. We played small shows around our town outside of Sacramento- harvest festivals, church events, coffee shops. Our biggest gig was the California State Fair!\n\nOur dream was always to move down to Los Angeles and get a record deal. In 2009, we uploaded a video of us singing Party in The USA to our YouTube channel. It blew up and ended up getting millions of views! From there, we kept uploading new covers every week.\n\nWe were discovered by a major record label (Island Records UK, which is part of Universal Music Group) and signed with them in 2010. We moved to Los Angeles and basically felt like our dreams came true! We spent 5 years in L.A. chasing that dream, writing songs with some of the biggest names, going to red carpet events and premieres, and doing professional photo shoots and big budget music videos. At first it seemed like our dreams had come true, but by the end of those five years we found ourselves exhausted and depressed. We felt empty. We were pretty much on the verge of quitting music.\n\nIn 2015 we decided to leave our record label and move to Nashville and become independent artists. It was around this time that we also discovered that we wanted our music to have depth and a strong message. This was inspired by the thousands of messages we were receiving from our fans about their personal lives, heartache and hardships. We released several songs about family struggles, self-worth, anti-suicide and positive body image. As we saw our fans react very strongly to the messages, it ignited a fire in us to spread even more messages that would create a positive influence in people’s lives.\n\nSince we moved to Nashville in 2015, we have written and released 5 albums and many EPs, toured all over Europe, South America and the US, and even written a book!\n\nWe are now young women in our 20s and we run everything ourselves. It’s a business as well as an art, and we are still learning what works best with our very different personalities, shortcomings and unique gifts. We are most passionate about sharing our message of hope, connection and celebrating and embracing who God called us to be. Our Catholic Faith is extremely important to us and is the driving force behind everything we do.\n\nThese days you can find us creating music and videos for our YouTube channel and Spotify/iTunes, touring, making podcast episodes for The Cimorelli Podcast, designing new merch for our store, and creating whatever else our minds dream up!\n\nHey! I’m Katherine, but that’s a relative term. My sisters, friends, and a lot of the Cim Fam call me Kath. Also, for some reason, pretty much anyone over the age of 60 calls me Kate, Katie or Kathleen. Even though I don’t go by any of those, I don’t really mind it. But really, I prefer Katherine or Kath.\n\nI’m the second oldest in the band. I’m known for being soft, sappy and sensitive, and I also have a very bizarre, goofy side that especially comes out when I’m sick or tired (loss of inhibitions.) I love to write poetry, read books, bake treats for people, host dinner parties, go on long walks, and have deep talks with my friends. My passions in life- people, music, and art, and especially above all else, God. I am a proud Catholic and love my faith. My dream is to be a successful author! I have always loved writing and I want to publish my poetry as well as stories about life and the things I’ve learned. I love playing the bass and singing in the band, and I especially love meeting the Cim Fam on tour and traveling to new places in the world!\n\nInstagram- @katherinecimorelli\n\nTwitter- @kathcim"
