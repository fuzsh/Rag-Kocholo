        "text": "Sleeping In My Home Bed Tonight (White Flag WF 8/9)\n\nR.D.S. Arena, Dublin, Ireland – August 28th, 1993\n\nDisc 1 (63:59): Intro / Drummer Boys, Zoo Station, The Fly, Even Better Than The Real Thing, Mysterious Ways, One / Unchained Melody, Until The End Of The World, New Year’s Day, Numb, Tryin’ To Throw Your Arms Around The World, Angel Of Harlem, When Love Comes To Town, Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\n\nDisc 2 (64:17): Satellite Of Love, Bad / Candle In The Wind / Fool To Cry / The First Time, Bullet The Blue Sky, Running To Stand Still / The End, Where The Streets Have No Name, Pride (In The Name Of Love), Desire / You Make Me Feel So Young, Help / Ultra Violet (Light My Way), With Or Without You, Love Is Blindness, Can’t Help Falling In Love\n\nThe relatively new White Flag label has reissued the famous U2 bootlegs from Dublin on August 28th, 1993. Taken from a Westwood One radio broadcast, this tape is the source for several well known releases including Live From Dublin, RDS Zooropa 93 and Dublin 1993 (Live Storm LSCD 52280). White Flag have essentially remastered the best sounding of the silver releases of this show found on Zoo Europa.\n\nAccording to one site, “This is considered by many collectors to be the best U2 bootleg ever. The sound, performance and remastering are exceptional. The source is a professionally produced soundboard recording, remastered. If you’ve seen the video for U2 in Sydney, you know what this recording will sound like. It’s nearly identical, except without some of the second-tier Zooropa songs, like Dirty Day, that U2 played in Australia. I would rank Zoo Europa among U2’s best recordings, including officially released studio albums. It’s a “must have” recording that every collector should have.”\n\nWhite Flag have remastered the recording to sound more clear and lively and is clear of intrusive radio DJ chatter and presents the pristine sound of the recording with excellent balance between the music and audience noise.\n\nThe first leg of the European Zooropa tour ended with two nights in Royal Dublin Society Showgrounds in U2’s hometown of Dublin, Ireland. August 28th is the second of the two, played before a sellout of 36,000 and with support from Scary Eire and Stereo MC’s. In “The Fly” Bono sings the final chorus like in Verigo. Afterwards he comments while channel surfing, “that’s the thing about TV. When something’s serious comes on, you just change the channel.”\n\n“One” contains a snippet of “Unchained Melody,” and “Sweet Dreams,” and the wedding march are included in “Angel Of Harlem.” “When Loves Comes To Town” is brilliant. It’s a song that sounds much more like a throwback than the rest of their new songs and this is unfortunately the final time they play it live. Afterwards Bono says: “It’s a fine thing writing some songs and putting out a record while still on tour, but it’s another thing trying to play the fukcing thing ” refering to “Stay” which some collectors claim is the best version played by the band."
