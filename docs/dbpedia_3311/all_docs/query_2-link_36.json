        "text": "1.\n\nErvelet 01:45\n\n2.\n\nwhat you see as a wave i see it as a flood what you see as rain i see it as a storm what you call home i call it world what you feel right i feel wrong it is all different and it's all the same you say ok and i say no way we're walking the same road but we're so close & yet so far away we're singing the same song but we're so close & yet so far away when you shout your thoughts i don't even make a sound what you think about me i think about you now who am i? Who are you? What is new and what is old? What's the difference between the devil and the god? it is all different and it's all the same you say welcome and i say goodbye we're walking the same road but we're so close & yet so far away we're singing the same song but we're so close & yet so far away\n\n3.\n\nDancing Generation 05:26\n\nwe're once again surrounded by too many smiling people but when we close our eyes we feel so empty and alone we're like strangers , like actors... we're dancers! And we're dancing all night...alone passion , confidence , style , beauty , erotism , alcohol , drugs , money let the dance begin !! “stay with me my love , hold my hand forever whisper in my ear the words i want to hear dance with me my love , offer me another drink we're strangers in love for one night but this night will be long... i hope it will be long...” you're once again surrounded by the blinding lights of glory you are the very important person of the night and you're shining , you're flying , you're dreaming and you're thinking “oh! my god , what a delight!!” ...but you're crying 'cause you know that you're dead inside “dance with me my child , housewife , killer , lawyer touch my body lover , i am out of my mind tell me jokes and laugh! Laugh as much as you like! We're the dancing generation but we don't know why we dance please tell me why we dance? Please tell me why we dance?” ...and as the night slowly slips away , the first rays of light appear in the sky , reveiling the samefulness of your naked bodies dance now!! you fools...\n\n4.\n\nLullaby 07:54\n\ngo to sleep my baby.the night is falling down i will lay my hands as a pillow , my breath as a fire , to keep you warm all night i'll stretch my body around you - a sheild. So no one can ever get inside i will tell you stories about kings and queens tonight fairy tales with happy end. I'll pretend that everything's alright don't listen to the screams from outside don't notice the dead around please pretend 'cause the night is falling down please pretend 'cause the night is falling down we're swimming in blood my baby this night will never end we're riding on a butterfly wings into the inevitable end we are dying out in this rotten place were no one can ever get outside let our screams be a lullaby...\n\n5.\n\nThey 03:14\n\nthey're all around they're everywhere they're coming at night they're closing the light they watch us all... they're in the car they're in the bar they're into the streets they're coming for you they're coming for me there is nothing you can do but wait until they'll come for you and there is nowhere a safe quiet place were your thoughts can hide and rest they know... time's up.\n\n6.\n\nErased 05:14\n\ni got nothing more to say all my memories are erased locked inside a golden cage to the back side of my mind it seems like i've forgotten what i've always fought for everything's rolled up with something cold and faceless the purpose is lost , my feelings are dimmed , uncoloured and faded indeterminated...as the days are passing by... the hours are passing by so slowly without reason anymore i don't know what i'm searching for and the words just won't come out and my pen is standing still on the paper and then is falling down to the ground everything's rolled up with something cold and faceless the purpose is lost , my feelings are dimmed , uncoloured and faded indeterminated. ...as the days... ...as the years... are passing by...\n\n7.\n\nTime 05:09\n\ndecomposing cells in ignition mood only time will show...and time is what we don't know unnoticed thoughts into a desperate mind only time can tell...and time is what we don't understand the payback of time will come sooner or later for everyone everything in its right place everyone will get what he deserves time is your heaven time is your hell time is a wheel spinning so fast time is your saviour time is your god time's what you fear begging to stop... abandoned , shipwrecked , words are not enough only time heals...and time is always too far tangent corners of encountered fates only time knows...and time hides its secrets from us the payback of time will come sooner or later for everyone everything in its right place everyone will get what he deserves time is your heaven time is your hell time is a wheel spinning so fast time is your saviour time is your god time's what you fear begging to stop...\n\n8.\n\nThe Scene Remains 05:58\n\n...and you've tried so hard to get on to the top to see that no one's there ...and all those sleeples nights now have passed away with no trace of pain the scene remains the same a wrong move – a bleeding heart a distance in between us an absent face – the love outside the emptiness inside... so what is left for you? For what was it worth? You tore down a wall just to find another one behind nothing changes at all the scene remains the same a wrong move – a bleeding heart a distance in between us an absent face – the love outside the emptiness inside...\n\n9.\n\nO.K 06:48\n\ni see the world from a different view today coz' they've been given me my medicine and i feel that everything's alright and i hope that i'm ok i will get out of this place one day , i'll become a businessman i will get my own wife kids and dogs and they told me that's ok they are crazy motherfuckers , they are dirty bastard sons they have fucked out our brains , i hate this fucked up world... i will fly higher than the moon with my cigarettes (you know...) i will confess to a priest and god will be clement to me i will meet my lover in the night and i know that it's ok coz' i got my wife tied on the bed and my feast is always right they are crazy motherfuckers , they are dirty bastard sons they have fucked out our brains , i hate this fucked up world... i will kill my mother just for fan coz' i saw it to a movie i will beg the cops down on my knees , i will claim that it was not me i will fuck and i'll be fucked with everyone , i will get a nervous breakdown then all my records will swim in gold and i'll be the reachiest person they are crazy motherfuckers , they are dirty bastard sons they have fucked out our brains , i hate this fucked up world...\n\n10.\n\nReprise 04:12"
