This year, they followed up with the eXPERIENCE + iNNOCENCE tour.\n\nThe band played their 1991 song “Acrobat” for the first time ever at the opening show in Tulsa. Guests of last night’s show at Copenhagen’s Royal Arena were treated to a similar surprise when U2 performed “Stay (Faraway, So Close!)” with a full band for the first time in 25 years."
