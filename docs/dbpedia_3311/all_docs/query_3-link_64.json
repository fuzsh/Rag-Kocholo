Leon, who has been managed by Jorge Juárez since December 2022, has agreements with Universal Music Publishing and AEG Live.\n\nPlans\n\nLeon’s Boca Chueca Tour 2024 starts from Paso Robles on July 22 and travels to important locations, such as Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is Carin Leon known for?\n\nCarin Leon is renowned for his soulful voice and success as a regional Mexican musician, ranking high on Billboard's touring earnings.\n\nWhat is Carin Leon's new music deal about?\n\nCarin Leon partnered Socios Music with Virgin Music Group and Island Records to distribute and promote his music globally and in the U.S.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
