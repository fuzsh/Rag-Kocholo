        "text": "Other Notes:\n\nLarge hole in centre. Black labels. Has UPC printed right on the label of the vinyl, and sent out in a generic white sleeve to shops as a low price single. Different label than other USA pressing.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nCommercial release in a regular jewel case. The first pressing of this CD did not contain the Capitol Records logo on the back cover in the lower left hand corner, although Capitol is mentioned in the credit fine print. Later pressings would add this logo.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nThis was a later pressing of “Stay” for the US market. Initial pressings did not contain the Capitol Records logo on the back sleeve, but did mention it in the fine print. Later pressings would add the logo in the bottom left corner on the back. The matrix number changed with these pressings as well.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nReleased as part of the iTunes ‘digital box set’ on November 23, 2004 – “Stay (Faraway, So Close!)” was labeled as “The Complete U2 – 37 – Stay (Faraway, So Close)” in the set. The files were initially released at 128kbps, but were later eligible for an upgrade to iTunes plus at 256kbps. It was only available in the set, and this item was not made available for individual purchase except for a limited time mistake in the Canadian iTunes store. The set was removed from sale from iTunes in December 2007.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nReleased digitally on May 8, 2020, this single was issued as Bono was using one of the tracks from the single in his “60 Songs That Saved My Life” list for his 60th birthday, and the song was not available on digital services. The single was released to streaming services and digital storefronts with the catalog number 00602507231309. The iTunes ID number for this release was 1512593451.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nThis new digital remastered single was released on August 11, 2023. The single at CD-Quality or below all carried the same catalog number. The covers pictured include those from iTunes (Australia), Spotify (Canada) and Qobuz (France)."
