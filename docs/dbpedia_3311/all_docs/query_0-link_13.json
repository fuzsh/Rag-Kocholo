        "text": "Artist: U2\n\nRelease Date: Jul 1993\n\nFormat: CD\n\nRecord Label: Island Records\n\nGenre: Alternative, Rock & Pop\n\nUPC: 731451804724\n\nZOOROPA truly gets going with the fascinatingly droning \"Numb,\" which features the Edge on lead vocals and stands as the most adventurous single that the Irish quartet has ever released. From here the album hits a stride, careening through the giddy Euro-disco of \"Lemon,\" the aforementioned \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!),\" the heavily percussive \"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car,\" and the funky, chiming \"Some Days Are Better Than Others.\" Wrapping up the quirkiest outing in U2's discography is an appropriately strange, yet inspired song--\"The Wanderer,\" where Kraftwerk-like synths and dreamy backing vocals support the unmistakable voice of the legendary Johnny Cash. Although, ZOOROPA is often overlooked, it's an ambitious record that marks a crucial point in U2's evolution.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. Zooropa\n\n2. Babyface\n\n3. Numb\n\n4. Lemon\n\n5.
