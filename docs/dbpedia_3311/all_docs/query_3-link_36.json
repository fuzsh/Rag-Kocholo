        "text": "Record labels play a huge role in the music industry. They not only produce the songs they also discover new talents keeping the industry running.\n\nAfter they sign a deal with a musician, they take care of all the aspects of their music like, production, record manufacturing, distributing, marketing, enforcing copyright, and all.\n\nThe origin of record labels\n\nRecord labels are in existence for a very long time. It all started with records. In old days, people had no access to music at home. They could only enjoy live performances. After the invention of record players people could listen to their favorite music anytime they want at home.\n\nIn 1904, Victor Talking-Machine Company made a deal with an artist, and thus the first record deal was made. The artist was paid $4000 per song and $0.40 for every sale. Soon many record labels were established the music industry flourished along with them.\n\nAs the companies wanted to display their names alongside the artists on the records, they are known literally as record labels since then.\n\nThe big record labels:\n\nThe biggest record labels in the world are mostly owned by big companies with different other businesses. Some companies truly focus on music and make immense progress in the music biz. But many times, the companies cannot carry on with the music aspect of their business due to other engagements and sell off the label and everything that comes with it. That is why you may see a lot of changes in the name and their business styles among record labels.\n\nCurrently, there are only three big record labels in the United States. The number is so low due to various mergers of companies over the years.\n\nThe big 3s\n\nThe three big companies are Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment. These three controls most of the music market in the States right now.\n\nUniversal Music Group\n\nUniversal Music Group or UMG Recordings Inc is an American company with most of the shares now owned by French media corporation Vivendi.

The most popular record labels in the country come under their umbrella. They are:\n\nDef Jam Recordings\n\nInterscope Geffen A&M\n\nRepublic Records\n\nUniversal Music Group Nashville\n\nUniversal Music Publishing Group\n\nUniversal Music Enterprises\n\nUniversal Music Latin Entertainment\n\nSpinefarm Records\n\nCapitol Music Group\n\nVerve Label Group\n\nIsland Records\n\nPolygram Entertainment\n\nFame House\n\nUniversal Music Group is the biggest music company in the world.

Japanese company Matsushita Electric bought MCA in 1990. In just five years most of the shares were bought by Seagram and they renamed the label Universal Studios, Inc. the music section of the company was named Universal Music Group.\n\nWarner Music Group\n\nWarner Music Group is also a big music company with many successful labels under its brand. The most popular ones are:\n\nWarner Records\n\nElectra Records\n\nAtlantic Records\n\nThe company has headquarters in New York City. They were available for trading on the New York Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2011. Access Industries purchased the company in 2020 and it became a public company again.\n\nWarner Brothers film studio established Warner Music Group when one of their actors, Tab Hunter reached number one spot with his song. He was signed with Warner Brothers for his acting but for his music, he was signed with Dot Records, owned by their rival studio Paramount Pictures.\n\nWarner Brothers then decided to open a record label as well to keep Hunter solely under their roof. They bought Frank Sinatra’s Reprise Records and stepped into the music biz. The label has gone through many ownership changes like others and secured its place in the big 3 with successful deals.\n\nSony Music Entertainment\n\nThe record label is a part of Sony Music Group with many successful and well-known labels under it. These labels are:\n\nColumbia\n\nEpic\n\nArista Nashville\n\nArista\n\nRCA\n\nRCA Records Label Nashville\n\nSony Music Group comes under Sony Corporation of America that is in partnership with Sony Music Holdings, Inc. and Sony Entertainment, owned by the Japanese giant Sony.\n\nIt was founded as American Record Corporation in 1929.

After 1991, it was renamed Sony BMG and it finally became Sony Music after Sony purchased Bertelsmann Music Group.\n\nOther significant record labels\n\nThere are many successful and popular record labels operating in the country and most of them are owned by the big 3.
