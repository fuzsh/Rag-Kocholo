        "text": "Not surprised itâ€™s not a full show. Oddly for such a renowned live band, there is no officially released (excluding fan club releases) live albums. There is no equivalent of Live n Dangerous or Too Late to Stop Now or Stop Making Sense. I donâ€™t see that changing anytime soon.\n\nThis is such an odd release. The cover is utterly predictable, the tracks uninspiring and the timing baffling.\n\nPerhaps the new management demands product?\n\nCooler for me would have been an echo of Under a Blood Red Sky, an 8 track mini album to mark Zoo TV. The timing still makes no sense.\n\nSide 1\n\nZoo Station\n\nUntil the End of The World\n\nStay (Faraway So Close)\n\nMysterious Ways\n\nSide 2\n\nThe Fly\n\nRunning to Stand Still\n\nWith or Without You\n\nLove is Blindness\n\nOk, nice to hear MW but it's not the Bootleg-Version with falsetto vocals at the end (what i really loved during MW in 1993). Is it reworked? Can't understand why they not release the great version of WOWY with the extra guitar solo at the end from the 1992 shows. Unfortunately overpriced for an EP but bought the Vinyl & CD anyway to have it in my collection. ðŸ™ˆ\n\nOriginally posted by cmaly:Grifting the \"buy all the formats\" completists. Drips and drabs. U2 is trolling its fans with this one.\n\nHow is this doing that exactly?\n\nThey haven't released this material before. And they announced all of the formats all on one day.\n\nCD. 12-Inch yellow vinyl. Digital, including an Atmos version. Reasonable amount of formats for something like this. U2 fans have been crying for CD releases for some time, having not made the switch to vinyl.\n\nIm really surprised that some people dare complaining that WE have unreleased material instead of a 40th remaster of the 28/8 show !!\n\nThis \" bootleg\" IS perfect, the best, and has already been remastered by brillant people here. No there IS not the fabulous falsetto, but listen to the bootleg and you'll hear it !!! And now WE have a New soundboard version of a MW unreleased date in an official release. This IS a great great news, Hope the 5 titles are from the 27th !!\n\nOriginally posted by u2wanderer1:[..]\n\nHow is this doing that exactly?\n\nThey haven't released this material before.

Between him and U2, seems to me heâ€™s the one trolling trying to stir the pot and ruffle the feathers."
