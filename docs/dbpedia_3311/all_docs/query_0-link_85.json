        "text": "EMMA WARREN\n\nSo, you all know Canary Islander Pablo Diaz-Reixa from his debut album Alegranza, which is jammed full of steel pan loops, tropicÃ¡lia, all sorts of stuff with a little bit of help from an MPC and a Roland SP-404. More of that later. So welcome El Guincho. [applause]\n\nSo you grew up on the Canary Islands, and I thought it might be interesting to talk a little bit about where you come from because whilst lots of people will know where it is and what kind of place it is, some of the people sitting here from, say Russia or Kazakhstan or China or some of the more far-flung parts of the globe â at least far-flung from here â might not know very much about it. So whatâs life on the Canary Islands like?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\n[to audience] Have you ever been to the Canary Islands? Itâs seven small islands near Morocco, near the Sahara, actually. For example, I have family, my grandfather for example is from Cuba. I have family in France and roots in Africa. How do you say? The aboriginals, the native people were from Africa who were originally here. You have a lot of weird influences there. And we also want to be Spanish, and European, but we are so far away from Europe, sometimes it doesnât make a lot of sense. It's really interesting being born there. It was really hard for me to find records and get into music on the Canary Islands because we only have mainstream record shops, so a lot of beach and sports.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWe hear a bit of sunshine and beach in your music. So how different is growing up in the Canaries than it would growing up in mainland Spain? You live here in Barcelona now, donât you?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nItâs really different. The Canary Islands is really familiar and you have the beach all the time. I studied in France, and for me, it was really shocking going from the Canary Islands to France. Maybe itâs not the place but the people, the way they think. When youâre on an island you think the world ends at the sea. When you live in Europe, you can travel and meet people from other countries. Basically in the Canary Islands you have a lot of people from the Canary Islands. When you live in Barcelona, you meet people from other parts of the world.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWhen did you go to France?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nIâm really bad with ages. I think it was aged 14.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nAnd how long did you stay there?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nA year and a half.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nNow weâve got the dates in place. As much as some artists who come from towns or cities with a strong musical tradition donât necessarily want to be associated with where they come from, some places have a strong local tradition [that canât be ignored]. So if you think about Berlin, for example, you might think of techno, hardcore, punk, whatever. In LA, maybe itâs hip-hop, psychedelia, funk. What would be the local music at home for you in the Canaries?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nThere is no local music but all the folk, which is like South American music. As a kid, you wish to be European, so in my case, I was excited first by techno first, then hip-hop records. But there are a lot of Spanish rock bands, really awful-sounding bands. Itâs a lot of people wishing to be other than what they are. But I think what we should do in the Canaries is look inside ourselves and find the roots of our sound and work from there to make something interesting.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nBut if youâre at home walking down the street, what are you hearing? Are you hearing more European music or more African music?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYou hear the FM radio. I was very lucky because my dad was really, really into music, and he used to travel to London and buy a lot of amazing records that as a kid I never realized. My dad was really into Fania Records, salsa things and African stuff and tropicalia, Brazilian music. He was really into Caetano, all these guys. I used my dadâs record collection for my records.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo your dad traveled to London to buy records. Heâs just like a super fan. These dads with good record collections can be a useful starting point for a life in music. You just said that people in the Canary Islands need to look inside themselves and see the roots of what their music is, and to me, thatâs what your record sounds like. What is the local folk music?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nWe have Spanish guitars actually, a small guitar called timple. In Brazil, for example, you have the cavaquinho or in South America, you have the charango or stuff like that, so itâs kind of like our charango. In terms of rhythm, the African roots are definitely there. But in terms of harmony, you have South American harmonies like bolero and stuff, we have Spanish roots and Spanish guitars. Itâs sung in Spanish as well.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nI was looking to see if your folk music is local like the way fado is in Portugal, a folk music with a specific tradition, and you were telling me about two different types of songs.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nWe donât have a specific style. We have songs that are isas and the folias and then there are the malagueÃ±as, which comes from Malaga, a place in Spain. It used to be three-bar kind of thing. Slow. Whatâs interesting to me about Canary Island music is when a big group of people, like 20 or 30 people, just comes together to sing, but itâs very natural, very easy.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nAre these songs that everyone knows or are they songs people make up, almost like a competition?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYou learn them naturally, three or four songs that everyone knows. You donât know how. Itâs just part of the tradition, I guess.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nAnd whatâs the difference between the two types of songs?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nFor example, the folia is more like upbeat, while the isas is more slow, more sad. While the folias is more like party music. Isas are for when you all come together. Basically the difference is where they dance too.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo all the songs have dances as well, like the Catalan slow-fast thing?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYes. [laughs]\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nMy apologies for not knowing what itâs called.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nThe sardana. Itâs quite different.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo how does the dance go? Iâm not expecting you to do it necessarily.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nIt goes [holds arms in the air]. And the girls are in front of the guys, and they all go together [wiggles hips].\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWow, that kind of dancing. [laughs] Some of this stuff has found its way directly into your album, hasnât it?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nTotally. I really like Los Gofiones, which is a band who worked a lot trying to find all kinds of rhythms in Canary Island standards. If you like, I can play you one song if youâre into it.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo this is recorded by whom?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nLos Gofiones.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nAnd this is a traditional Canary Island thing which found its way onto your Record?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYes.\n\n(music: El Guincho â âCuando Maravilla Fuiâ)\n\nSo thatâs an isa.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThatâs an isa, El Guincho style. Thank you. One of the things I think about when I listen to your album is that lots of the bits of it get really stuck in your head. How do you make it so sticky? Is it all to do with the looping sounds?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, I think thatâs what happens with hip-hop, I guess, or techno stuff; when you take a little piece of sound and keep repeating and repeating it, itâs tugging your head. I donât know if youâre familiar with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, but I was really into them, Delia Derbyshire, all that kind of stuff. This really old-fashioned looping. I think itâs really interesting. Iâm going to play you some if I can find it.\n\n(music: BBC Radiophonic Workshop â unknown)\n\nYou know that? Itâs like from the old BBC pioneers. I took, I stole that again for my record too. If you keep repeating that thing, it gets stuck in your head.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThere are quite a few samples in your record.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, thereâs like 20 samples in every song, itâs crazy.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nDid that have any bearing on how long it took to come out?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, we released it in an illegal way in Spain, without clearing the samples. We sold quite a lot, about 10,000 copies in Spain and Australia, so the record went really good. But when I signed to XL Recordings, for an international release we needed to clear all the samples. Thatâs why the record wonât be out until October now because itâs so, so hard to clear all the stuff.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWhat do you look for? What makes you want to sample something?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nThatâs a really hard question. I sample in a naÃ¯ve way, when I really get excited by a part and want it to happen again and again in the song. Thatâs when I take it for me, you know?\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nAnd talking about the samples you cleared on the album, what kind of things are included in that list?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nThe main loops. We cleared like two main loops in every song, so the more you can recognize. The little stuff, we just...\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThe little stuff, shh! If you can just give us a list of a few things you did clear â where did they come from?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nFor example, the single for my album, itâs called âPalmitos Park,â is made from a little bit of Los Zafiros. Do you know them? Itâs like a doo-wop band from the â60s from Cuba. Theyâre my favorite band ever. If you want, I can play you one of their tracks.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nYes, they sound fascinating. Letâs get this list together, then we can listen to a few of them.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nSo you want me to name more? I have Pete Rodriguez, âEl Conde,â which is a boogaloo guy. Then the second song on my album, which is âAntillas,â which was African stuff that I found on some tapes. You can find it on the Internet, actually. But in the Canaries, we have this huge black market of tapes because there are are a lot of guys coming there. Thereâs this band called Super Mazembe, an African orchestra. The third song on the album was the trickiest one to clear because there were a lot of recognizable samples. Esquivel, who is an exotica producer. Then the Trinidad Steel Drum Band from Trinidad and Tobago. Yeah, itâs lots of stuff.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nYou just mentioned âAntillas,â and it would be really good to come back to Mexico and hear the band you were talking about, but can we have a little blast of âAntillasâ?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nSure.\n\n(music: El Guincho â âAntillasâ)\n\nI think a lot of you went out last night or something, so itâs not a good song to listen to if youâre...\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nItâs a good sound to listen to at any time, even if youâre at your most hungover because thereâs something very happy and strongly positive about the music you make. It sounds like you had a lot of fun making it.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nIâm actually not a very optimistic person, but I think it sounds so uplifting because I use a lot of major scales. When I was taking all these samples from all over the world because of the pitch, Iâd listen to all this stuff in a very naÃ¯ve way. As you can see, the songwriting is really, really simple. Itâs just like three or four loops to come in together and working because the pitch is the same. The melodies sound really uplifting but just because of the samples actually.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo what else is it that makes a piece of music sound positive? Itâs major scales, itâs samples.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nTempo.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWhat else? How do you make them sound so âTechnicolorâ?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nThe samples come from lots of different places, and sometimes when you sample you tend to forget that a sample means that there was a lot of guys playing this song in a room. So you can take these rooms and youâd got a lot of people coming together in this song. Thatâs why itâs this big-sounding thing because there are a lot of people actually playing there.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nI like that idea a lot, the idea of capturing the moment of a room full of people. Aots of different rooms with lots of different people and throwing them all together in a new room. A new room called Alegranza.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nWhat I think is interesting about the album in terms of production is, when I got all the samples, I recorded everything in the same room, and I had six little amps in the same room in a circle, so I just put in this omnidirectional mic and I EQed all the different amps until I was happy with the sound, and then I just placed the drums in the middle of these amps, and I placed six mics behind the amps, so you could get this sensation of exotica stereo kind of thing. Then I sang in the middle too, so you get this âroomâ sensation.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nAs you just mentioned, you sang all the way through. Have you always sung?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, Iâm not a good singer but I love to sing. I should not sing that much on my records. But it comes out really naturally. When Iâm recording I really want to sing over it.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nIt sounds from your description that you like trying different things in terms of the way you record stuff, the way you put it together. Are there any other things you did that differs from just sitting in front of your computer and doing it normally?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nFor example, what I did was I had this old recorder, and I used to live in El Born, which is near the sea in Barcelona, so I used to go there and make field recordings from the beach and the people talking. Thatâs why the album sounded really messy, kind of [makes sea noise] because I used a lot of sounds from the beach and people walking in Barcelona.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nDo you have an interest in kind of field recordings generally?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, Iâm really into it. When I go those places I really like to record sounds from those places.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nLater youâll have to have a chat with El Santo, whoâs doing exactly the same thing here with everything thatâs happening at the Academy. So what other kind of things do you record when youâre out and about?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nLately, Iâm working on the new set for the tour that Iâm starting in three weeks, more of an electronic thing. Iâm really getting into that Basic Channel, Iâm getting into that thing again. I'm really listening to a lot of that and old French hip-hop that Iâm really into. When I was making this album, I was really obsessed with mixing samples with live live things again. I actually played drums in a band.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWhatâs your band?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nCoconot.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThatâs the other thing, OK. So we get the sense of some of the more exotic things youâre influenced by, but you also just mentioned Basic Channel and French hip-hop. Which are the other kind of bands or artists in the more dance-related field that youâre interested in?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI donât know. The first music that got me really excited was when my friend recorded me a tape â¦ I studied at a French school, which is why I was into French hip-hop and stuff â but a techno or Frankie Knuckles sort of thing. That was the first thing that got me really into dance music. Then I was a huge fan of the Prodigy. For me living in the Canary Islands, they would come and play when I was 13 or something. And for me to see this band coming to where I was born, I was really influenced by that moment.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo Prodigy played the Canary Islands?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYep, Tenerife, big festival kind of thing. Fat of the Land era. It really shocked me.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWhat are you like live?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI wasnât happy at all with the way I played live. I made this album not thinking about playing it live. It was more as a bedroom thing, so I used to play the sampler with my left hand. But I needed something else, so I had a floor-tom with my right hand and a piece of wood, and I had a sound module connected to it with little triggers. So, I used to play the percussion with my right hand and the samplers with my left hand. It was kind of freaky, like that [mimes playing both simultaneously] and singing at the same time. But I wasnât happy with the sound. I had this SP4, I donât know if you know it. Iâm sorry if any of you work at Roland, but itâs kind of this shitty piece of equipment, itâs like a toy that never sounded good. But it was really easy for me to play with my left hand, but I wasnât happy with the sound so Iâm changing everything and bringing in rhythm machines and synthesizers and stuff.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nA hard record to play live.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, if youâre just one guy, itâs really hard.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nYour artist name comes from a bird that flies alone. How important was it for you to do all this stuff by yourself rather than in a band?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nFor me, it was kinda like, I did it by myself. I really like playing with human beings, not only just machines. So it was hard for me trying to find someone here in Barcelona I could share this sound with. I was thinking about playing a lot of the songs with my band, but it was frustrating that I couldnât find a sound I was happy with. So I ended up doing it by myself somehow.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThe album just kind of happened, didnât it? Or, perhaps I should ask you that: Did you sit down and plan this record or did it happen in a more natural fashion?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI never planned it âcause I used to work in a film studio writing film scores and commentary scores and music for ads. That was kind of my soundscape or something. I would go home and collect all these little samples and play with them, you know, in a really naÃ¯ve way. Thatâs why I sing so bad on the album. I wasnât making this to take to a record company, I was just playing to relax from my other work.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo this other work working in the studios and writing these film scores, how did you end up there?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nMy friend James had this studio in Ingrazia, which is a nice part of Barcelona, and I wanted to record my first album as Coconut, so I went there and he was the main guy at the studio. We got along really well and we were both into this free-jazz stuff, Ornette Coleman, Archie Shepp and John Coltrane. So I started playing drums and he played sax, and after that, weâd just get into each otherâs stuff.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nBefore that, what got you into being in and making music in the first place? Did you grow up playing a lot of instruments?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nIn the Canary Islands, I studied classical music for years because my grandmother was an opera singer and a music teacher. So, yeah, all the nietos â I donât know the word in English â all the grandchildren, we went to the music school as a natural thing. So I started like that.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nItâs funny because youâve been talking quite a lot about making music in a very naÃ¯ve way. Youâve used the word a few times. But at the same time as that, it sounds like youâve got an in-deep schooling in classical music and how you do things âproperly.â\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nThatâs why I think itâs important that I donât think about things too much because I tend to do that a lot. For my own music, I wanted it to be as a fresh as they can be.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nI read an interview where you talked about growing up in a house with salsa, tropicalia and African and Cuban records. You mentioned about how your dad was a collector and you have ancestors from all those places. How usual was this in the Canaries? Does every kid growing up in the Canaries have this music around them?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI donât think so. My dad was really into records and my uncle was really into records. When I grew up, I hated all these records my dad played at home. For example, Caetano Veloso, whoâs a huge inspiration for me. As a kid, I thought it was just fun music that my dad used to play. Or when my dad played the African orchestras in the house, I got sick of all the repetition. But then it is something that I kept, and itâs in my music.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nAnd what was it that attracted you particularly to tropicÃ¡lia?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nHere, thereâs a lot of techno artists and DJs, but I was really into pop. Thatâs how I am, I guess, and tropicÃ¡lia had this really experimental way of writing â playing with structures and the way they placed sounds in the stereo helped me get into tropicÃ¡lia. TropicÃ¡lia had all this feeling, and I felt inspired by what they did with stealing a lot of stuff from American music, or rock. Like Caetano stole a lot from the Beatles, but it was still their own thing. You can take things from here and there and it will still be your own thing. It was really inspiring for me, like you can take ideas from all that but still be your own thing.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWere you at all interested in the political context of tropicÃ¡lia, that music which sounds one way but is actually doing another job?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nLater on, I was. I started listening to like Caetano and Gilberto at like 16 years old, so I wasnât aware of the whole situation back in the â70s. Later on, I read a lot.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThere were some things you wanted to play that influenced you from that area.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI wanted to play Los Zafiros, a Cuban doo-wop band from the â60s. Theyâre really great. Then Iâm going to show you how I stole it.\n\n(music: Esquivel â âLatin-Esqueâ)\n\nWhat is fun for me is music like Martin Denny or Esquivel, taking like lounge music, all this relaxing chill-out stuff, which in terms of production, is really avant-garde.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nPersonally, I really love music which appears to be simple and perhaps even like below simple but is actually really mad and clever.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nLike punk, for example. Like the Ramones, itâs so simple that itâs a great idea.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nShall we have a tiny bit more of this?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah. [turns up volume]\n\n(music: Esquivel â âLatin-Esqueâ continues)\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nYou mentioned exotica as well and that very specific 1950s way of seeing the future. Which of the artists in that area really spoke to you?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI really like a guy called Attilio Mineo. Maybe I have some of his tracks. [looks at computer] Sorry, no, I donât have it. But Jimmy Haskell, Sid Bass, all these guys. The way they played with the stereo hugely influenced me. I havenât read much about them, so itâs hard to know their thoughts. But I know they were conscious of placing things in the stereo that way just to experiment. I know Esquivel did it becuse he was really into it. But also Jimmy Haskell, who was more orchestral, but still sounds weird, for example the way he plays all the strings. I donât know if they were aware of their futuristic way of thinking, or if it was just natural.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nObviously, thereâs a whole load of artists from this particular period or time whoâve been influential for you. But if we move forward a couple of decades. Which other artists, particularly in the way they captured their sound, have been a big influence on you?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI think what was really big in the â90s, maybe at home â grunge or punk â influenced me in that I knew it was what I didnât want to do. The way they did all these big productions here [gestures hand in face] â drums and guitars and bass and vocals â super-compressed kind of thing, I knew that was something I didnât want to do. But I didnât know how to make the stuff sound different.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo how did you make it sound the way you wanted?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nJust listening to a lot of exotica records and playing around with mics and doing a lot of field recording and stuff.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nIn terms of what you did technically, was it buying particular bits of kit or was it just trying different things allowed you to find yourself?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nWhen I started working in that studio, I donât know that much about mics. But I spent a lot of time placing them while the other guys were asleep, trying to record guitars and drums to see how they sounded, opening the doors and closing them because I noticed that when you open the door or close it, that changed the sound while youâre recording.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo did you record with the doors open or closed?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nDepends. If you want a huge drum sound, you open the door.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nOpening the door makes the drums sound bigger?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, totally. In the studio, that used to work, totally.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSitting here in the last 10, 11, 12 days, weâve talked to a lot of people, and one thing I find myself asking almost everyone is this idea of how you listen to music and how, as a musician or an artist, you train your ear to do a certain job. How do you like to listen to music?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nIâm really like a headphones guy. When Iâve finished a record or a mix, I listen with headphones. Sometimes itâs not a good idea in terms of mix, because you never get distance. Itâs good to go in your friendâs car and play the music there, and get in the studio and try to find some good speakers. But Iâm really a headphones guy, trying to see all the details.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nHow much alteration would you make to a finished track after the listening process?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nThatâs a problem I have, I always want to change. Thatâs something that happens to all of us. You always think, âOh, I couldâve done this better.â I always mix my stuff like 20 or 25 times. My ProTools is always full of mix 17, mix 18, and then you listen to all this stuff and itâs ridiculous. Itâs almost the same mix.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nI suppose the other useful question then is, how do you know when somethingâs finished?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI donât know, I play it to my friends andâ¦ I donât know, Iâm really bad, I have no perspective with my music. For me, itâs really shocking that people are into my music because itâs hard for me to face it. I really need to work with a producer â or not a producer because I like the production part, but an engineer or a friend who will say, âOK, Pablo, thatâs done.â\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo is it just the deadline that lets you know itâs finished? Is it only finished because it has to go the record company?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nNo, also because it feels good. Now I have a new law that I have to finish a track in one day. If I donât finish it, then I donât use it. Because if not then I get really baroque and start adding stuff and stuff.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo does this mean youâve got the basis for a lot of other records in the future, like lots of tracks you didnât manage to finish in one day?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah totally. A bit.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo whatâs the new music you are working on?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nFor the live set, because now Iâm bringing this other guy whoâs going to play the bass through a part. I donât know if you know the SPD-S parts by Roland. Itâs like a sampler you can play with drum sticks. I really like the idea of playing the bass with drumsticks, the way it hits you. We really compressed the bass so it can be like big sub-bass, which my record actually doesnât have at all. And Iâm bringing this Juno thing, a typical synthesizer and some parts connected to the module. So itâs more like remixes of the songs on the album. Kind of like a stripped, colder sound.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nOne of the things that struck me about your record was that while the bands who came out of the baile funk thing, all those CSS, Buraka whatever, theyâve made it more acceptable to have international sounds. Local sounds that are not basically English or American. What am I trying to say?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nBut they still have this hip-hop thing.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThey still have this hip-hop undercarriage â big basslines and things that sound like they come from England and America but with the rest being their own local stuff on top of it. And your record seems to be your sound, but without that big obvious European or American signature sound to it. Do you think maybe as a global listening community, weâve got to the point where we donât need all that other stuff underneath it?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, totally. Thatâs why I keep talking about Caetano Veloso, but thatâs why heâs this big figure because he really stole from North American music, obviously. American standards, Gershwin, whatever. Cool jazz, stuff like that. Or Milton Nascimento, who was really into The Beatles, but when you listen to this records, theyâre just his own. I like North American music, English and UK stuff. I was really into grime, for example. When Dizzee came out, I was excited about that. But if you just look around you, you can find interesting stuff without going so far away.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nDid you feel any pressure to make it sound more normal?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nNo, I was used to working in this studio where the movie director would come in and want you to write something particular. A lot of music that Iâd write for ads, theyâd come in, âHey, can you make this sound like Pascal Comelade or Tom Waits.â So I just wanted to forget about that and go home to try doing my thing without thinking about anything else.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nIt seems like an exciting time really, and Iâm excited about the fact peopleâs ears are changing a bit and theyâre more open to different things. That maybe over the next six months, three years or whatever, people will have the confidence to come as themselves.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nWhen I was in the UK to do all this press stuff, all the questions were, âDo you think people are opening their ears?â I think peopleâs ears have been always open, but the thing is now you can get to music easily. There are a lot of people getting into different stuff, not just the 10 or 12 mainstream artists. But peopleâs ears have always been open because we live in an environment full of different sounds, you just walk in the street, and there are all these different sounds.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nPossibly, itâs just English ears that werenât so open because youâre used to pop music being propelled from England from the Beatles onwards.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nThatâs a thing with the production. The production is like, âOK, the drums have to sound like that, the guitars have to sound like that.â When you have all these standards, itâs hard to go far. But peopleâs ears are always open.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nAbsolutely. It would be really nice to hear a couple of things, either new stuff youâre doing or other music of yours, or maybe something else that really means something to you.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nDo you know this guy Souley KantÃ©? I donât know how to explain his music. Itâs dance music, I guess.\n\n(music: Indian Ocean â âSchool Bell / Treehouse (Walter Gibbons Remix)â)\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nPeople find music in lots of different ways, but how do you tend to find music?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI find it through the internet, and calling my dad. [laughs] My parents are divorced, so a lot of my record collection is at my dadâs house. He lives on another island in Tenerife, so sometimes I call him to send me stuff. And yeah, I go record shopping.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWhatâs your recommendation for record shopping in Barcelona?\n\nEL GUINCHE\n\nThere was a huge place called Discos Balala, but they closed, so you should go to Wah Wah maybe.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThere have been a few visits down to Wah Wah already. What about out of town? Do you have secret spots outside of the city?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nOutside of Barcelona? No, because this year Iâve been touring a lot, so when Iâm in Barcelona, Iâm in Grazia all the time. I like going to restaurants and drinking coffee and being with my friends, disconnect a little from music.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nI think weâll put it out to all of you guys. Does anyone have a question right now?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER\n\nYou were talking about exploring space using panning. I was talking to El Santo this morning about 5.1 surround sound. Have you thought about doing a mix in surround sound and incorporating it into your live performances? I think that would be very exciting, letting the sound wash from back to front.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nYeah, that would be interesting. Iâm writing new stuff. I want to be close and in your face. But with this record, it would be really interesting because it has a cinematic feeling.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER\n\nSo this album will be released in 5.1 as well?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nIt would be interesting to rework it.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nThank you. Who else?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER\n\nYouâve been living in Barcelona for a while. How would you describe whatâs happening in the musical scene here?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nIt depends which musical scene you mean.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHow would you see it?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nIn terms of pop music here in Barcelona, some interesting bands happening now. What I like is in my small circle of friends, weâre all setting up parties and nights, trying to build something. Not thinking about the scene, but just letting stuff happen so people can listen to each other more. In terms of dance music, we have some clubs, but there are always people from outside coming here.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nSo are these parties like? Whatâs typical?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI have these friends who write for a magazine, they have a party called Our Favorite Club. Itâs a secret party. Thereâs a band playing, some DJs. But in Barcelona, what you have to do is do your own thing, set up your own party. If you want to hear interesting sounds, you need to do it yourself.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nThatâs pretty standard in any city. If youâre really interested in music and youâve got your own sound, youâve got to do your own thing. That whole thing about doing parties is good because lots of people have started by realizing thereâs nowhere for them where they want to hear and so theyâve set up their own. That way you grow a culture, a whole thing, a house with many rooms.\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nWe had this huge band in Spain in the â90s called Siete Notas Siete Colores. But Iâm missing some one-step-forward hip-hop thinking in Spain, in terms of production, because we have some good MCs.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWho has the mic? OK then itâs up to me because Iâve got one more question before we wrap up. And thatâs about getting signed, really. As an artist coming from a non-English speaking country â at least not as its first language. How easy is it to get an international record deal when you donât come from those traditional places?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nItâs obviously harder if you live in Spain rather than when youâre living in the States or London. But now, you have a lot of social networks and blogs and Myspace. A&Rs are dying to find the next thing or whatever, so theyâre looking outside their countries to find them. For me, whatâs weird about working in London with English-thinking and -speaking people, itâs really hard to match the way I think and see music with the way a big label like a big record label like XL sees things. It will be interesting to see how they work the album.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nWith the Internet, there are always new things like SendSpace and MegaUpload and SoundCloud. Are there any of these new things that you like?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI like guys like Lil Wayne, when he was releasing his album he was working a lot of mixtapes. Every week there was a new one. I like the way itâs really easy to find things because it trains peopleâs ears and makes them try to go further.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nUnless anyone else who suddenly realized they have a burning desire to ask something, or perhaps if youâre too shy, youâre going to be around wonât you?\n\nEL GUINCHO\n\nI really need to go to the toilet, but Iâll be around, yeah.\n\nEMMA WARREN\n\nOn that note I think we should let you go and say, give it up, please. El Guincho. Thank you very much.\n\n[applause]"
