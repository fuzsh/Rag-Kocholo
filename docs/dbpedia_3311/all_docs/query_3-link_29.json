        "text": "That’s a great site. A few comments on their presentation of U.S. Island labels, pertaining to the ‘80s:\n\n--The site shows the changeover from the purple skyscraper label to the blue label in 1984. I’m under the impression that it was actually in late 1983.\n\n--The site shows a white version of the skyscraper label, which is indicated for “occasional” use between 1982 and 1988. The photo is a copy of the jukebox version of U2’s 1987 single “With Or Without You” on Island 7-99453 (with a B-side with one song playing at 45 rpm, instead of two songs playing at 33 1/3 rpm as on normal 7-99469 retail copies). To my knowledge, that is the only commercially released 45 that ever used this label; does anyone know of any others? This label is simply Island’s then-current promo 45 label with the promo disclaimer removed. It is based on the purple skyscraper label; for some reason, Island continued using promo 45 labels based on the skyscraper design for several years after it had been discontinued for commercial releases.\n\n--The site shows an alternate version of the black label under Warner distribution, used from 1986 to 1989. The photo is a copy of “Higher Love” by Steve Winwood. When Island switched U.S. distributors from Warner Bros. to Atlantic/Atco in 1982, for reasons that I have never understood, Steve Winwood’s material remained under Warner Bros. distribution. His new releases continued under Warner distribution until he left Island and signed with Virgin (his last “new” releases on Island were the Chronicles compilation album and its attendant singles, in late 1987/early 1988). I’m not sure if there are Warner versions of any of the earlier post-1982 Island labels. Winwood’s last album before Back In The High Life was 1982’s Talking Back To the Night; I don’t know what labels its 45s used, or when it was released in relation to the distribution change.\n\nI also have two 1980s U.S. Island 45s with labels that don’t fit the chronology presented on that site, or those that I have seen elsewhere. I have long wondered about these:\n\n--I have a copy of Joe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes’ “Up Where We Belong” with a very plain, olive green/tan-colored label (I don’t have it in front of me, but my recollection is that it’s a nondescript color that’s difficult to describe). I have never seen another Island 45 with this label; I bought it specifically for that reason. It is a U.S. pressing, and it is not a “Revival of the Fittest” reissue. Could this have been a short-lived transitional label around the time Island’s distribution switched from Warner Bros. to Atlantic/Atco? Most copies of “Up Where We Belong” that I come across seem to have the purple skyscraper label. I think I’ve also seen it on the later blue label.\n\n--I have a copy of Frankie Goes To Hollywood’s “Welcome To the Pleasuredome” on the purple skyscraper label. Based on when it was released, in early 1985, I would have expected this to have the blue label, or possibly the black label. I’ve also seen references to copies of FGTH’s “Relax” which have the shorter 1985 U.S. hit mix but use the purple skyscraper label more typically associated with the earlier, less successful U.S. release of the song (the 1985 U.S. hit release is most commonly found on the blue label). This makes me think that Island may have brought the purple skyscraper label back for a short time in the spring of 1985, in between the blue label and the black label, around the time “Relax” was falling off the U.S. charts and “Welcome To The Pleasuredome” was being released."
