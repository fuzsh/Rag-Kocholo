        "text": "Dominican rapper and songwriter Tokischa has inked her first global publishing deal with Warner Chappell. This follows the news of Tokischa’s new label, SOL, with Warner Music Latina, and the release of her new single, “Sol.”\n\nTokischa has collaborated with Latin music champions from J Balvin, Rosalía and Ozuna, to icons like Madonna. This year, she released “Ride or Die, Pt. 2” with Sevdaliza and WCM’s Villano Antillano and “Chulo pt.2” with WCM’s Bad Gyal featuring Young Miko, among other collaborations. Most recently, she also performed at multiple LGBTQ+ Pride festivals, including Toronto Pride, Brooklyn Pride, and LA Pride.\n\nTokischa’s manager Angelica Piche said: “The best results are accomplished by teams, and it’s a pleasure to unite with Warner Chappell. Tokischa and I are excited about this collaboration and the synergy that this alliance will bring.”\n\nGustavo Menéndez, president of U.S. Latin and Latin America for WCM, added: “We take a lot of pride in who we pair with and sign. We’re always looking to work with those who are relevant and possess true artistry. Tokischa is the perfect example of that: her music speaks to her completely original creative side and integrity, and the best is yet to come.”\n\n+ HYBE continues its Latin American expansion with the launch of new offices in Mexico City, Miami and Los Angeles. This comes as HYBE launches a new label, DOCEMIL MUSIC, as well as the rebranding of Exile Music to ZARPAZO and Exile Podcasts to Ajá Podcasts.\n\nCEO Jonghyun ‘JH’ Kah will work closely with General Manager Fernando Grediaga and COO Jeremy Norkin to build HYBE Latin America. Kah brings over decades of global management expertise including YG Entertainment and HYBE-Geffen. Grediaga brings over 23 years of industry experience, having held pivotal roles at EMI Music and Universal Music, championing artists like Molotov, Belanova, Café Tacvba, and RBD.\n\nNorkin, with over twenty years of experience, has held roles at agencies including William Morris and United Talent Agency. Twice named a “Billboard Latin Power Player” and elected to Billboard’s “30 Under 30,” Jeremy co-founded Exile Music, which was acquired by HYBE in 2023. He opened UTA’s Miami office in 2014, building UTA’s strength in the LATAM space and representing a diverse list of artists such as Post Malone, Muse, and Ms. Lauryn Hill.\n\n“With Spanish-language talent dominating the charts and expanding worldwide market share, now is the ideal time for a global powerhouse like HYBE to enter the Latin space. Combining HYBE’s resources with specialized Ibero-Americas knowhow is a failsafe formula to nurture tomorrow’s superstars,” said Norkin.\n\n+ Capitol Christian Music Group (CCMG) has announced the promotion of Walter Thomas to VP of artist development at Motown Gospel and TAMLA Records. Additionally, Alexandria “Dria” Dollar has joined CCMG in the role of senior director of A&R at TAMLA and Motown Gospel.\n\nThe new position takes Thomas from director of artist development for CCMG in 2023 to his new role which comes with expanded responsibilities including overseeing the growth and nurturing of the company’s artist roster and development initiatives along with facilitating its marketing initiatives. Thomas formerly served as CEO of Agency 22 Music and Entertainment, managing artists such as DOE, JJ Hairston, Jonathan McReynolds, Maverick City Music, Smokie Norful and more.\n\nDollar, a two-time Grammy Award winner and recipient of Stellar and Dove Awards, will work closely with Thomas and spearhead efforts to discover, develop and sign new talent. Prior to joining CCMG, Dollar served as director of A&R at Reach Records in Atlanta, GA.\n\n+ Communications and public relations specialist Melissa Nathan has launched The Agency Group.\n\nThe Agency Group team specializes in communications, crisis, reputation management, personal publicity and digital team services across entertainment, innovation, corporate and litigation clients. The firm’s current client roster includes HYBE America, Drake, Johnny Depp, the Chainsmokers, Logan Paul, DreamCrew, PRIME, Rostrum Records, Cedar Park Entertainment and Platoon, among others.\n\nThe executive team includes Breanna Butler as executive VP, Carolina Hurley as senior VP, Katie Case as VP, and Alyx Sealy as senior director. Rylie Long and Dervla McNeice round out the team.\n\n+ UK artist Jordan Adetunji has signed to 300 Entertainment in North America and Warner Records UK as his global label partner. The 24-year-old talent recently unveiled the music video for his breakout track “Kehlani.”\n\n“Partnering with 300 was a decision on people and actions for me,” said Jordan. “When meeting Kevin we talked a lot about the meaning of artist development and it felt a great home to continue our global journey!”\n\nKevin Liles, CEO of 300 Entertainment, said: “Jordan is a generational talent whose music transcends genres. 300 is built on recognizing an artist’s authentic self and empowering them to share their gifts with the world. We are proud to partner with Jordan’s management team and our incredible UK Warner Records family in this artistic journey.”\n\n+ UTA has signed Brazilian electronic artist and DJ Victor Lou for worldwide representation, excluding Brazil, in all areas.\n\nThe Brazilian-born artist began his career in 2015, creating his own sound and visual style that connects his roots in the Brazilian “desande” dance music movement with techno and other club music elements. His hits include “Diu Diu Lai” (with Mochakk), “Laurinha,” “Untitled,” “Remote Control” and most recently, “Silverstone.”\n\n+ Dylan Brewer has launched a new creative and experiential music marketing company called FRAUDULENT. Based in Los Angeles, FRAUDULENT has already launched campaigns with Jessie Reyez.\n\nBrewer was formally VP of marketing and head of experiential at Epic Records. He is also a two-time Clio award-winning executive with over 10 years of experience at companies including Epic Records, Def Jam Recordings and Google. He also led experiential campaigns for artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Judas Priest, Modest Mouse, Bakar and Madison Beer.\n\n+ Boston Red Sox player Kenley Jansen has launched KJ74 Entertainment, a record label that aims to introduce the sounds of the Carribean island Curaçao.\n\nJansen’s deep-rooted connection to his homeland has inspired him to create KJ74 Entertainment. In a statement, he said, “I have been running a music label in Curaçao for the past four years, and I see the incredible potential in the cultural fusion and distinct sounds of our region. It is my passion to showcase the talent from my home country and our neighboring sister islands to the world.”\n\nOne of the first artists to join forces with KJ74 Entertainment is RAFIK, a talented musician of Lebanese and Colombian descent who hails from Curaçao. RAFIK released his debut single, “TUKUN,” under the KJ74 Entertainment banner on June 21.\n\nTuesday, June 25\n\nSeventeen-year-old country singer-songwriter Ty Myers has signed with Records Nashville/ Columbia Records and will release his new song “Let ‘Em Talk” via the label “very soon,” according to the announcement. Myers is managed by Blake Shelton manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Entertainment. He has enjoyed hits with his songs “Tie That Binds” and “Drinkin’ Alone” (which may be written from experience as he is not yet of drinking age). Following a date supporting Willie Nelson, the Texas native will be on the road all summer, playing headlining dates as well as hows with Wade Bowen and Randy Rogers Band, Cody Johnson, and Josh Meloy.\n\n“It’s not often you meet a proper singer/songwriter at the tender age of 17 who writes, sings, plays guitar and performs like Ty Myers,” says Records CEO and co-founder Barry Weiss. “Simply put, this is what the music business is all about. We’re wildly excited at RECORDS Nashville to have signed him with our colleagues at Columbia Records.”\n\n(Pictured above, L-R: Records’ Andrew Saltman, Records Nashville’s Josh Easler and Joe Fisher; Columbia Records’ Jenifer Mallory; Ty Myers; Columbia Records’ Julian Swirsky and Joe Gallo; Records’ Barry Weiss; Starstruck Entertainment’s Narvel Blackstock; Records’ David Enriquez)\n\n+ Kelly Bolton has joined Warner Records as VP of A&R. Working out of Nashville, she will collaborate closely with co-chairman & CEO Aaron Bay-Schuck on signing, developing, and cultivating country artists for the Los Angeles-based label.

At the company she built out a roster of 15 songwriters. Previously, she was with Big Deal Music and launched her career at Black River Entertainment, where she worked closely with a young Kelsea Ballerini.\n\nBay-Schuck said: “I’ve known Kelly for years, and her ear for talent is impeccable. She’s widely admired not only in the Nashville artist and songwriter community, but throughout the industry. Her addition to the team enables us to have boots on the ground in Music City with the advantage to actively engage, sign, and develop new artists hands-on. The potential to make a major impact is limitless.”\n\n+ Rostrum Pacific has announced the appointment of Chris Atlas as president of Fat Beats, the long-running distributor and retail brand, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.

He began his career promoting shows in college and in 1992, along with a few partners, opened the Fox Theatre in Boulder, Co., a venue with which he remains active. He joined forces with Chuck Morris and Brent Fedrizzi to launch Bill Graham Presents/Chuck Morris Presents in 1998. Through a series of acquisitions including SFX and Clear Channel Entertainment, that company would eventually become part of Live Nation in 2005.
