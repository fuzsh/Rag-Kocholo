        "text": "Hecticrecs and Lay Bare Recordings releases King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard’s ‘Infest The Rats’ Nest Live’ | Interview with label’s owners\n\nKing Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard made five live albums available to release for anyone. Hecticrecs and Lay Bare Recordings joined their forces to do something special about it. ‘Infest The Rats’ Nest Live’ is a compilation of the finest songs recorded at their world tour.\n\n“As we wanted to do something creative and special with it we took the best of all the different artworks and made it into one cover and inside cover artwork. Musically we took all the ‘Infest The Rats’ Nest’ tracks and compiled these on LP record and added the ripping thrash demo version of ‘Automation’ as a bonus.”\n\nIn the following interview we also discuss the story behind Hecticrecs and Lay Bare Recordings.\n\n“King Gizz’s song-themes deal with climate change impacts, destruction of the environment and human resettlement to other planets”\n\nBefore we start discussing the very exciting release, I would like to discuss your background. How did you first get interested in music?\n\nDésirée Hanssen: From early childhood on music was a big part of my life, as I grew up living right next to my grandparents who ran a pub. Of course there was music playing non-stop. Their jukebox was filled with 7-inches. And to stay update with the latest music we went to a record store in the city to get the latest hits. From that time on not only my interest in music was born but also my passion for vinyl. And well, as you know, that resulted in the foundation of a record label; Lay Bare Recordings. A small DIY boutique record label based in The Netherlands with 34 vinyl releases and still counting.\n\nJorrit Hompe: I started the label the label in the late 90’s. Friends of mine were playing in a band and released two demo’s already and were looking to get their new album released on a label. I made the suggestion to do it for them and start my own label. Everything was very DIY. We did everything ourselves. My interest in music is of course a bit older than that. At home the radio was always on. After my dad explained me how to tape music from the radio I started to think about what interested me and what not. But really hearing something I liked took a few years more. The first thing I heard on the radio and really liked was ‘She’s on It’ by The Beastie Boys. Eventually their approach of music / DIY culture was a big inspiration for the label as well.\n\n“To capture the music that I like and release it on vinyl for more fans to hear”\n\nWhat was the original concept behind Lay Bare Recordings and Hectic Recs?\n\nDésirée Hanssen: It was always my main idea to capture the music that I like and release it on vinyl for more fans to hear. Lay Bare wants to unveil talented bands, in the unconventional music scene that is, to many music lovers as possible, so they can discover them and enjoy their music. The whole concept is focused on vinyl.\n\nJorrit Hompe: Well I started to do the label and release music from friends and then from friends of friends. It took many years before I released stuff from other groups I wasn’t directly related to. I wanted to make the label grow so I decided to put everything back in that came out of it financially. Getting music out and releasing what I like myself is important. As my taste is diverse I release all kinds of stuff on my label… that doesn’t make it easier as you have to start from scratch promotionally almost every time I release something new.\n\nYou’re covering a wide variety of releases. How do you select your artists?\n\nDésirée Hanssen: Lately I get a lot of new music in. Since the COVID-19 pandemic there was a significant increase in emails I got. I am really impressed how many bands know how to find my label. Alas I simply cannot give them all a proper listen. Now my first “check” is the way bands represent themselves and their story behind their music and projects. Secondly, why they reach out to Lay Bare. If I can find myself in the motivation I am going to listen to the music. I must be under the impact of the music. I need to be moved by it. So, my emotions are involved for sure. Next to my feelings there is the DIY attitude of a band. Keeping up the hard works to get that music out! The pandemic showed me how bands took the opportunity, not be able to tour, to stay creative in many ways. Being in contact about this process and talking with musicians about being “affected” got me some interesting new insights and ideas.\n\nJorrit Hompe: If I like it and the artists are open for a collaboration then there is a possibility. I only once have released something from a demo that got sent to me. I usually approach artists myself. I need to see something in it that sparks my interest. And I prefer to work with artist who have a DIY approach themselves too. Musical style is less important for me. It has to be good of course. But after all these things I have put out, somebody who looks closely, will probably see some sort of concept in it maybe. As for the King Gizzard release I always hope some big band would pull something like this… to let anyone release it. I’m very glad they did. It’s a good move.\n\nWhat are some of the latest releases that you would recommend to our readers?\n\nDésirée Hanssen: That is always a tough question and not easy to answer. Because music is very personal as well. My latest releases are genre wise totally different. There is the beautiful apocalyptic dark Americana blues debut album from Soothsayer Orchestra, the dark psychedelic melancholic rock debut EP from the incredibly talented band Severant and the instrumental psychedelic, improvisation free jazz music from Atlanta. I would say, give ear to all of them. And if you are more into hefty riffing and hauntingly hooky vocals listen to the gothic doom from Frayle. And do not forget to check out the high energetic riot grrrl with classic post-grunge influences work from Rosy Finch.\n\nJorrit Hompe: All of it, haha… well the last few releases. For people interested in King Gizzard I also have released ‘Demo’s Vol. 1 + Vol. 2’ on double cassette.\n\n“RSD releases have a huge impact in a negative way for the underground / DIY scene when it comes to vinyl releases”\n\nHow are you coping with the current world situation and how do you think artists and labels will survive?\n\nDésirée Hanssen: As for now, I am juggling with the long turnaround times, missing the momentum, postponing release shows. It is taking its toll. Like RSD releases for instance. Those releases have a huge impact in a negative way for the underground / DIY scene when it comes to vinyl releases. Also, no touring means less growth in fanbase. Especially for debut releases, new bands. They lose momentum. However, on the other hand, the underground scene has one big driven force and that’s “community”. Music tends to unite people all over the world. So smaller (DIY) record labels, musicians, record studios, shipping companies, booking and pr agencies reach out to each other and unite in some way. You see a lot of collaboration arise. It triggers me to think about new ways to bring music in an innovative and passionate way. All of this in the right atmosphere, helping to build a bigger reputation for those bands who needs to be heard!\n\nJorrit Hompe: Well as I work as a music programmer for a mid sized concert venue (Willemeen in Arnhem) a lot changed. Everything got closed then there were a few moments when some stuff was possible again but later the plug got pulled again. Lots of cancellations and rescheduling of concerts and again and again. So for artist especially in the semi pro situation it is difficult. On the other hand a lot of music is being made and put out. And there is some time to focus on other things and contemplate stuff. Happy to still have my job myself on the other hand where will this go? I don’t believe a virus will go away, it will only mutate as a civilization we have brought this upon ourselves with monoculture and how we treat the earth. The King Gizzard album Désirée and I put out has this theme as well. Concerning artist and labels surviving,… well some people do it because they want or have to do it others have an important financial aspect to their output. If you are in the second group you are more vulnerable if you make the wrong choices or the world is upside down. For example if you have to pay peoples wages you might go bankrupt. For me, if I don’t sell any records from release X that won’t mean I can’t go on with the label.\n\nJorrit, what’s the story behind King Gizz ‘Demo’s Vol. 1 + Vol. 2’ recordings that you recently issued on tape.\n\nJorrit Hompe: Same thing! King Gizzard also put this up for people to release if they want to. I already did a King Gizzard release before on LP and Cassette. The ‘Polygondwanaland’ album. I wanted to do something like that again and this time do the whole packaging design myself. Mieze from Bullebak BV helped me to upgrade the images as they where of poor quality. I am pleased with the outcome. It was challenging as I am not anything close to a designer and have limited knowledge of how design programs work.\n\n“The artwork is also taken from all 5 live albums and re-arranged on our release”\n\nOkay, and now let’s talk about the ‘Infest The Rats’ Nest Live’. What’s special about it?\n\nDésirée Hanssen: As you know it’s the live version of their well-received album ‘Infest The Rats’ Nest’. All tracks are recorded on their tour around the world in the UK, Belgium, Australia, USA, and France. King Gizz made 5 live albums available to release for anyone who might be interested in doing this. We took this invite as an opportunity and wanted to do something creative and special. So, we chose the best parts from these 5-album sleeve-designs and assembled it to a burst of colors on the cover and inner bag. Further we compiled the ‘Infest The Rats’ Nest’ live tracks to one magnificent and dynamic album. The thrash demo version ‘Automation’ was added as a bonus on top! King Gizz’s song-themes deal with climate change impacts, destruction of the environment and human resettlement to other planets. This is King Gizz on their rawest! We participated in this release not only because we love the music but to praise and express admiration for the spirit in which this music is being released.\n\nJorrit Hompe: Somebody who bought my earlier ‘Polygondwanaland’ tipped me that ‘King Gizz’ was doing this again and that he liked what I did with it earlier. He asked if I was planning to participate in it again. So I was checking it out but one of 5 live albums didn’t feel as a good idea for me and all 5 neither… then I checked if all live albums together had all tracks from the ‘Infest The Rats’ Nest Live’ album and they did. With this in mind I connected Désirée if she was interested in doing this together. And so we did. The artwork is also taken from all 5 live albums and re-arranged on our release plus we included a thrash demo version of the song ‘Automation’ on it too. The effectuation of the end result will be very lavish with extra heavy everything and neon green vinyl, lyrics and a full color printed inner sleeve. We are expecting the records here every moment now!\n\nInfest The Rats’ Nest Live by King Gizzard and the Wizard Lizard\n\nI love the cover artwork. It suits the music perfectly…\n\nDésirée Hanssen: Yeah, it is a real color feast for the eyes! Actually, the sleeve and compilation as it is, was Jorrit’s idea. He came up with that vivid bright-colored artwork. I immediately liked being color splashed. At least it gave me this big grin on my face, haha! It was fun to be part of finetuning the whole artwork. We were mailing back and forth all those brightly colored pieces and I am very happy with the result. And those labels are just perfect!\n\nJorrit Hompe: Cool! the artwork is some sort of collage of all the live records King Gizzard put online to release and where we took the songs from. Well. hope you’ll see the end product as well Klemen! I am looking forward to have it in my hands myself very soon.\n\nTell us more about the different editions available… There will also be a tape version.\n\nDésirée Hanssen: There is only one limited edition and that is a low run of 300 heavy weight fluor green vinyl. But you are right on the tape version. It is a special bundle that Jorrit releases with Hecticrecs. Two times 25 double cassettes; body printed transparent pink or frosty white tapes with rad special made packaging artwork!\n\nJorrit Hompe: No, just the record 300 pieces I think it will stay that way… we haven’t discussed it though… Lets see if we can sell these but 1/3 has already been pre-ordered and we are sending a bunch to the band of course so I think it will do well and sell out at some point in the not so far away future.\n\nAnd what led you to connect and co-release it?\n\nDésirée Hanssen: Jorrit and I know each other from way back. Jorrit is music programmer at this cool subcultural concert place Willemeen in Arnhem. In the past we touched base on several music related concepts and besides this, he knows my partner very well. In a way we are like minded when it comes to releasing music. Recently he reached out to me to collaborate on the KGATWL live album. As a fan of live releases and I saw King Gizzard Live at Freak Valley, I knew the vibe of this album would be awesome and worth to release despite the many other editions from other labels who jumped on the wagon as well. Jorrit’s idea on the artwork and adding that bonus track on top was simply perfect. And like I said before, the influence of this pandemic, got me into thinking of collaboration even more. Quite honored to be involved in this co-release with Hecticrecs.\n\nJorrit Hompe: A friend is a partner of Désirée. I don’t have that many people I see every once in awhile who has the same disorder, releasing music that is. Previously we organized an event together with record labels from this province to exchange ideas, and meet et cetera. We worked a bit together previously which was a good base for this record.\n\nCan you tell us a bit more in-depth what the releasing process is like?\n\nDésirée Hanssen: It is a lot of talking with the band about introducing ourselves, ideas, and the concept of working together. Then it’s time to get a certain pace in planning. Asking for quotes, uploading the art and music, pushing the turnaround times from the test pressings and the final release to a certain release date that corresponds with a release party, a tour or lately an online show. Also, a lot of talking with bookers and / or managers when they are involved. In between keeping a good eye on the timeline. Talking a lot with the vinyl factory, like the art-department. There are always minor details that need to be corrected. It is all about timing and focus on getting that test-pressing as soon as possible. Listening to the test pressings, getting an agreement between the label and bandmembers to give a go and starting the noise around the pre-order and final release. It is exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time. Especially when you got more projects running and lately it’s even crazy what is going on, on those turnaround times… Also, in times like these it’s uttermost challenging, especially financially. Releasing records becomes a big part of your life, especially when you got bands overseas, working and contact hours are different then in your daily life planning. A new release is never the same. Bands and artists divert from approach, from working with deadlines, touring or not, easy in communication. Stick to an open mind and stay in contact with the band and the community around them. Dare to enjoy the moment you finally hold that hard copy with the finest music in your hand! It will not last long as you know as DIY label, the shipping and handling part is about to get started…. Hooray!\n\nJorrit Hompe: For this one I arranged a big part of all the things that needed to be done beforehand so getting the music edited well, getting vinyl masters, getting the idea across to the guy who rearranged the artwork, lyrics / credits / details / connecting with the pressing plant. After discussing lots of details we decided to print it. Désirée has much better connections with distro’s and distributors et cetera so she has been busy with that part. Now the promotional part will be important.\n\nThank you. Last word is yours.\n\nDésirée Hanssen: Klemen, it is an honor to get the opportunity via your amazing magazine ‘It’s Psychedelic Baby! Magazine’ to tell about how Lay Bare Recordings intents to be a part of spreading great music. Bands and smaller record-labels need like-minded people like you who find it important to share unconventional music to the community. Keep up the great works!\n\nJorrit Hompe: Well thank you very much for shining a light on this release and our labels. It’s very appreciated. And if anyone reading want to start a label or anything else just go and do it, don’t kill your idea by overthinking it too much. Allow yourself to mess it up and try again you’ll get something out of it anyways!\n\nKlemen Breznikar"
