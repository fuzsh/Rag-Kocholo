        "text": "As we have now completed the music video, it’s time that we start to complete both the magazine advert and the digipak. When it comes to creating the other products, we have to think about who our record label would be and which one our star would be signed to. I carried out a search into independent record labels as I feel our star would be targeting a niche audience, so wouldn’t be signed to one of the big name labels that are targeted towards a mainstream audience. Labels which we’d not be interested in are largest American record label company Universal Music Group, a subsidiary of French multimedia company Vivendi. The music giant is known for parenting labels such as Polydor Records (Eminem, Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding), Island Records (Bombay Bicycle Club, Of Monsters and Men, Mumford & Sons), and Mercury Records (Jake Bugg, Noah and The Whale). There’s a pattern amongst each smaller label owned by UMG, with that most of the bands that are signed to each of the labels having a particular style and belonging to a particular genre. Polydor are known for the more mainstream and popular artists such as the ones above, who each have their own distinct star persona and hype about them, whereas Island Records are home to more indie acts such as the ones mentioned and many more indie bands similar, who all generally focus on music opposed to the actual star status. If our star was to be signed to any labels owned by UMG, it would be one of the ones which is more appropriate to our specific style and genre, so perhaps Mercury or Island Records, definitely not Polydor, as they typically focus a lot on the star’s image. We’re targeting our star to an audience of indie girls, who typically are more concerned about the actual music opposed to the star herself, so we want a label that will channel the music and not the look. Ideally, we would go for an independent music label, so the artist has fewer constraints and can be more experimental with both music and style, as they do not have to conform to what the audience want, like a lot of bigger more mainstream record labels.\n\nOne independent record label we would consider our star to be signed by would be Rough Trade, which was set up in 1978 by Geoff Travis who had opened a record store off Ladbroke Grove in London. He managed to successfully sell and promote records from a whole host of punk and indie bands such as Buzzcocks and The Smiths. Travis then began to manage a series of bands, which began the label. The record label was solely independent as it also distributed the music via a network known as Cartel. The record label is home to some of the most prolific well-known artists such as Arcade Fire, Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros, The Strokes, The Mystery Jets, and Palma Violets. Despite the fact the record label is solely independent and has no links to the bigger well known record labels, proving that artists signed to independent labels can generate a fan base and succeed just as much as mainstream pop artists.\n\nXL Recordings is also a British independent record label designed to produce dance and rave music in the late 80’s. Since then, the label has spread to produce and release more alternative music, from artists ranging from Vampire Weekend, to Friendly Fires. All of the artists associated and signed to this label have their own particular style, which is why I’d be interested in signing our star to this label as she’d be able to work with her own style and use that in her work. Having the diverse range of music also means that fans of the record label will be open to all kinds of music, meaning that our star may generate quite a big fan base, like the artists already signed to the record label.\n\nOne independent record label situated in North Carolina, USA, is indie record label Merge Records. It was created so that the two founders could release their own music from the band they were in at the time and also music from their friend’s bands, however it has grown to produce music managing to attract large amount of fans, ensuring success for both the record label and the artist themselves. Artists working under this label at the moment include indie band Telekinesis from Seattle, Indie rock band Arcade Fire from Canada, but also bands from across the pond such as The Shout Out Louds, an indie pop band from Sweden, and Camera Obscura, indie pop band from Glasgow, Scotland. Having a range of artists from all over the world just proves how successful independent record labels can be, and shows that success is based on the actual artists and music, not just necessarily being signed to a big name record label.\n\nUpon further research, I have found that big name bands can be successful despite being signed to an independent record label. Canadian band Arcade Fire, signed to Merge and Rough Trade, won Album of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards in February 2011 for their album The Suburbs. They won against artists including Lady Gaga and Eminem, both signed to Polydor Records, owned by corporate giant Universal.\n\nBased upon this research, I have found that our star would definitely be more suited to an independent record label, as she would be able to produce the music she wanted as they have fewer constraints, and are not focused on pleasing the masses, so her sound would not be adapted to do so, but would rather focus on making music that is good. This would equally appeal to our target audience, as they generally go for the music opposed to the actual star. My research also shows that even independent record labels can produce stars that are just as or even more successful that the big name stars generated by the likes of Universal and Warner. So we will use an independent record label if not create our own, but ensure that this would be independent so the artist would have more of their own say on their music and focus solely on that rather than their image."
