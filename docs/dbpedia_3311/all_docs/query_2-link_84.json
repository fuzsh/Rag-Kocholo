        "text": "Limited edition blue 180-gram 2LP vinyl!\n\nZooropa is the eighth studio album by U2. Produced by Flood, Brian Eno, and The Edge, it was released on July 5, 1993 on Island Records. Inspired by the band's experiences on the Zoo TV Tour, Zooropa expanded on many of the tour's themes of technology and media oversaturation. The record was a continuation of the group's experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, Achtung Baby, in 1991.\n\nAudio source: 2017 anniversary reissue.\n\nOnly available in the USA."
