        "text": "U2 is one of the rare bands in rock history that have maintained the same lineup for their existence with neither member “going solo.” But if that were to happen, perhaps with Bono, the band would be okay with it.\n\nBassist Adam Clayton said in an appearance on the Rockenteours podcast (as transcribed by ContactMusic.com), “If Bono wanted to go off and do a solo record, I would encourage him and certainly everyone else would.”\n\nWhile he hasn’t recorded a solo record, Bono has embarked on some ventures without U2 throughout their career. His latest venture is his appearance in Sing 2, the sequel to the hit 2016 animated film Sing.\n\nThe U2 frontman has a significant role in the film, which will hit theaters on Christmas Day 2021. As previously reported, Bono voices Clay Calloway, a reclusive rock star who Buster (voiced by Matthew McConaughey) must convince to return to the stage for a new production he’s organizing.\n\n“Clay Calloway is quite the character,” Bono told Rolling Stone. “I like to think I was part of his construction. [‘Sing 2’ writer/director] Garth Jennings asked me about singing and where it came from. I surprised myself and him by answering with a line that would make it into the film: ‘Some people sing for a living, some people sing to survive.'”\n\nBono added, “Clay Calloway is a lion who lost his roar. A singer who lost his reason to sing when he lost his muse. A retired, reclusive rockstar with a big shaggy mane and low-frequency rumble of a grumble. He’s also got guns on his property…paintball guns…and a mixed relationship with his fans.”\n\nAlong with Bono, other new additions to Sing 2 include Pharrell Williams, Halsey, Letitia Wright, Eric Andre, Chelsea Peretti and Bobby Cannavale. In addition to McConaughey, other Sing actors returning for the sequel include Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, Taron Egerton, Nick Kroll, and Tori Kelly.\n\nU2: Their 50 Best Songs, Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
