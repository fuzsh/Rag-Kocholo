Walmart commercial ​ created a mini reunion of Mean Girls cast members. It aired early November as it featured Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert. Absence in the commercial was Rachel McAdams. Here is her statement on why she wasn't able to participate in the commercial:\n\nSimilar Topic: A Mini- Mean Girls Reunion For A Walmart Commercial\n\n\"To be honest, I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about doing a commercial. I have always been interested in movies, not commercials, so it didn't appeal to me. Additionally, I was not aware that everyone else was participating. Of course, I would always love to be part of a 'Mean Girls' reunion and spend time with my Plastics, but I learned about it later on.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount Pictures will be releasing a musical adaptation of Mean Girls in January 2024, with writer Tina Fey returning. McAdams will not be appear in the adaptation, although Tina Fey and Tim Meadows will be reprising their roles. However, there's a chance Regina might make a cameo. Here is McAdams' statement about that:\n\n\"Tina and I explored a few ideas, but ultimately it was challenging to make everything work out. I was open to whatever she wanted to do. I believe the direction they took will be fantastic, and I am eager to see it.\"\n\nSource: Variety"
