        "text": "I've got a new film coming out and there will be some selling involved. It’'s always a strange part of the process. Love Actually was the strangest, rolling through Europe with the huge cast, different ones differently famous and differently popular in different countries.\n\nThe bit I remember most clearly was a big press conference in Rome. There were about 10 of us on a little podium, and around 150 journalists. The first eight questions were for Hugh Grant. After the ninth question, asking Hugh what his favourite perfume was, I thought it was my job as director to speak up.\n\n‘It would be great if anyone had any questions for any other members of the cast,’ I pleaded. ‘For instance, Emma Thompson here has won two Oscars. Alan Rickman is one of Britain’s finest actors, Colin Firth has played Mark Darcy twice to high acclaim and Keira Knightley seems to be a very promising young actress. Any questions for any of them, maybe?’\n\nThere was a long, puzzled pause, and then, to my huge relief, a hand went up. ‘Yes!’ I said, pointing. The smartly dressed journalist stood up: ‘Emma’, she said, the audience applauded.– ‘Tell us, what was it like working with Hugh Grant?’\n\nHugh was very much in his prime. We were put in pairs for interviews because there were a lot of us, and I was teamed with Hugh. I remember one long afternoon when we were interviewed by about 10 German TV crews, including one particularly long one with the major news network. I felt I gave as good as I got, probably answering more than Hugh because I knew all about the other parts of the film, not only his bits. Afterwards, I went to change for dinner and happened to switch on the major network that had been so thorough. And there it was: my left ear. Just my left ear, on the very right of frame, and Hugh Grant, in a huge single shot. And Hugh answering every question. You know when you'’re beaten.\n\nThe basic set-up is called a junket, when you gather and lots of people come asking questions very fast. It’'s not unlike the scene with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill when Hugh pretends to be from Horse & Hound. The days are long and the fear is repetition. By the time you’'ve been asked the same questions 10 times and tried to squeeze in the same three slightly amusing replies, you start to forget whether you’'ve said that thing to that person already. You live in constant terror that the report won'’t say, ‘Director tells mildly amusing stories about his new film,’ but, ‘Director has Alzheimer’s and tells the same story three times in two minutes.’\n\nThe new film is called About Time, it stars Rachel McAdams, Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson, and I’'m guessing it’'ll be quite a gentle publicity experience. Rachel will be asked why she keeps falling in love with time travellers, Bill will be asked how it feels to be the best-dressed man in Europe. And Domhnall will be asked how to pronounce his name. He’'ll tell them, and then they'’ll instantly forget and still be too scared to say it. People say to me, ‘And I thought that...’ and I know what they want to say is, ‘I thought that Domhnall was wonderful,’ but they'’re too scared and end up saying, ‘I thought that... Cornwall looked lovely.’ Just in case you see it and want to be nice about him, it’s Don like in ‘doughnut’, but Don-all, spelled Domhnall.\n\nI hope you’ll enjoy the film if you see it; it’s a part anti-time-travel time-travel movie, big part romantic comedy, and small part advertisement for the Cornwall Tourist Board. It may be the last film I ever direct and, if it is, it'’s quite a suitable one, as it pretty well reflects how I feel about life at the moment.\n\nAnd it has absolutely no Hugh Grant in it at all, so I’'m bracing myself for Italy. ‘Rachel, would you like to be in a film with Hugh Grant?’ / ‘Richard,– do you regret not having Hugh Grant in the film?’ / ‘Don, Dun,– Domh, er, –Bill – how do you pronounce the name of the actor playing your son? And can you ask him what perfume Hugh Grant is using these days?’"
