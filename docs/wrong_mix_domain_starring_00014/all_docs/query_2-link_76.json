        "text": "Jonathan believes that it's inconceivable\n\nthat he will go to prison.\n\nHe's been a star all his life.\n\nIt is inconceivable that this great man\n\ncould in fact be found guilty.\n\n[laughs] He's Epstein. Yeah.\n\nWe were shooting in New York\n\nwhen the Epstein case was at the most,\n\nand I kept thinking, This is Epstein in a different shape,\n\nbut this is who he is.\n\nMy name is Susanne Bier, and I'm the director\n\nand executive producer of The Undoing.\n\nAnd I'm Hugh Grant, and I play Jonathan.\n\nThis is Vanity Fair Notes on a Scene for The Undoing.\n\nCome here. Come here.\n\n[muffled chatter]\n\n[Guard] Hey, no touching. Let's go.\n\n[hand pats back]\n\nIt's okay.\n\nAll right.\n\nWhen I used to watch Hugh Grant\n\nwith all the romantic comedies,\n\nI always thought there was a certain sadness\n\nto his light, charming performance.\n\nI always thought there was a dark side to that performance.\n\nAnd I thought that that dark depth\n\nwould lend itself very, very well\n\nto playing Jonathan Fraser.\n\nI probably think he was perfect for a whole lot of things,\n\nmost things I would say.\n\n[muffled chatter]\n\nWell, another fine mess I've gotten you into.\n\nI begged him, and then I engaged everybody else,\n\nincluding Nicole and David Kelley\n\nand everybody else to keep paying him\n\nbecause he's quite difficult to convince about anything.\n\nI don't think he wants to work ever.\n\nWith Susanne, whose Danish films I love,\n\nand David Kelley and Nicole, and it all seemed very classy.\n\nAnd although Susanne's right that I shy away from work,\n\nI couldn't resist it,\n\nbut especially if the guy was the murderer.\n\n[muffled chatter]\n\nWell, this is real.\n\nThis is how those visiting spaces\n\nin certain prisons actually operate.\n\nSo the visitors will be in one side,\n\nand the inmates will be in the other side.\n\nAnd then the prison guards are being quite observant.\n\nAnd of course, that tension plays into the scene.\n\nI was mainly just trying to keep the boy's spirits up\n\nand for very, very complex reasons\n\nbecause Jonathan is a sociopath.\n\nHe doesn't really feel proper things,\n\nbut he does feel that his job in this scene,\n\nJonathan's job is to be marvelous\n\nand to be great with the boy and the wonderful dad\n\nand healer that he always was.\n\nSo it's actually partly ego that makes him nice\n\nto the boy rather than love.\n\nBut you hopefully wouldn't be able to tell the difference.\n\nLook, I do think he loves him. I do think he loves Grace.\n\nI just think he is so messed up\n\nthat he is actually capable of loving someone\n\nand yet be 100% dishonest with them.\n\nWhy did you lie? If you're innocent-\n\nWell, I ran because I'm scared.\n\nI knew how it looked, and I was selfish.\n\nEvery time I do something,\n\nI make up specific rules that I adhere to.\n\nSometimes I don't tell anybody else about them,\n\nbut [laughs] it's almost like on a borderline OCD rules\n\nbecause they have to be kept.\n\nWhat rules did you have on there?\n\nNot to cross that border where you actually tell a lie.\n\nPush it right to the border,\n\npush it right there where it can't go any further,\n\nbut not never cross the line.\n\nIt's quite heavy duty or difficult acting,\n\nat least for me.\n\nDid you kill her? No.\n\n[muffled chatter] [baby cries in background]\n\nThere I was in New York shooting this series,\n\nwhich I partly did to get away from my small children\n\nbut actually really, really missing them.\n\nSo I was drawing on all that,\n\nand what I recall is sitting down on tape\n\nwhile on my side of this and bursting into tears,\n\nand I'm sure early takes were like that.\n\nAnd then you quite rightly [laughs] told me to man up\n\nand said, I think he might be trying\n\nto help his son a bit more by being a bit stronger.\n\n[muffled chatter]\n\nHow's school? Fine.\n\nViolin? Rosenbaum?\n\nWhat's the latest on him?\n\nMy note to Nicole was, Do not give in, do not give in.\n\nAnd with Henry, it was, You are so angry with your dad.\n\nYou are so angry with him, but you really love him.\n\nIt's actually fun doing a scene like that in a prison,\n\nand it's fun being restrained by the environment\n\nbecause you can't do any sudden movements.\n\nYou can't do anything which isn't,\n\nin terms of physicality, very controlled\n\nif you're a visitor in a prison like that.\n\nSo whatever Henry might be feeling,\n\nhe would have to sit completely still.\n\nI knew I was guilty, but part of my job in this series\n\nwas to convince my wife and my son\n\nand a worldwide TV audience that I'm innocent,\n\nand the only way to really do that was to believe it.\n\nSo I decided Jonathan was one\n\nof those sociopaths who believes his own lies.\n\nAllowed myself to be persuaded\n\nthat a person desperately needed me.\n\nSo when I'm saying, I didn't do it, I didn't do it,\n\nI did have an affair, but I do it, I mean it.\n\nIn that moment, I think he really believes is he's innocent.\n\nI fucked up. I made a terrible, terrible mistake.\n\nI allowed myself to be persuaded\n\nthat a person desperately needed me\n\nbecause her child was very sick,\n\nand I could help him recover,\n\nand I let that be a reason to lose my strength of character.\n\n[soft dramatic music]\n\nDigging into that notion of a psychopath,\n\nI would claim it's a really interesting place\n\nto go for an actor, and it certainly is for a director\n\nbecause the one thing that\n\nwould have made this whole show a complete failure\n\nwould have been to actually lie with it as storytellers.\n\nThat's why after we finished shooting,\n\nI went on murdering people for a few weeks,\n\nand I blame Susanne.\n\n[Susanne laughs]\n\nAnd then after everything, instead of being grateful\n\nfor everything I'd done for her and for her son,\n\nshe became unsound, threatening.\n\nGot to the point where I felt she wanted\n\nto destroy us as a family,\n\nso I went to confront her about that, and that's it.\n\nThat's all I did.\n\nYou're right.\n\n[laughs] Equally, I couldn't do anything too fake because,\n\nalthough I wanted to fool everyone all the way through,\n\nmy dream was that if anyone ever watched the series twice,\n\nthey'd think watching it the second time,\n\nYeah, well, of course he's guilty.\n\nYou can see that. It would make sense.\n\nQuite a difficult balancing act.\n\nWhy did you lie? If you're innocent-\n\nWell, I ran, because I'm scared.\n\nI knew how it looked, and I was selfish.\n\nIn that moment, I was completely selfish.\n\nI thought only about myself and what might happen to me.\n\nOther interesting thing I've learned\n\nabout the way you directed this\n\nfrom just doing these interviews together\n\nis that thing you said last time\n\nabout making this a kind fairytale.\n\nLike, is that right? Yeah, yeah.\n\nThe halo behind him, which is the very wide windows,\n\nwhich are in this huge, big space\n\nand all the wide shots as well is a weird attempt\n\nto make this space magical even if it's horrible.\n\nIt has this soft, yes, and almost divine-like lightning,\n\nwhich, in a weird way, doesn't take away the brutality\n\nof the space but just reminds us that,\n\noutside the walls of this space,\n\nthere is actually an amazing world.\n\nAlso, it's just very boring to shoot\n\nagainst a blank wall, isn't it?\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nBut you can make different choices with the room like that,\n\nand you can do things which would look different\n\nand which wouldn't be a drab wall.\n\nThis was reminding the audience\n\nthat the world outside has a magic presence\n\nwhich is gonna make Jonathan's loss even deeper.\n\n[muffled chatter]\n\nDid you kill her? No.\n\n[baby cries in background]\n\nYou were fucking her.\n\n[exhales loudly and scoffs] Okay.\n\nWell, it's straight to the net with that one.\n\n[Henry] Were you?\n\nYeah, we were romantically involved. Yeah.\n\nI think weirdly that this scene\n\nis where Grace decides to be supportive of Jonathan,\n\nand it's because of Henry.\n\nIt's because she sees Henry and Jonathan together,\n\nand she realizes the strong bond between them,\n\nand she realizes that she's gotta have to help him.\n\nHow's school? Fine.\n\nViolin? Rosenbaum?\n\nWhat's the latest on him?\n\nDid you kill her? No.\n\nI was trying to play the scene with two people\n\nwho were in a very different state.\n\nGrace is in a very different state to the boy.\n\nIt's also edited very much between you and Henry\n\nYeah. for that very reason.\n\nThis is the moment where we realize the tightness\n\nbetween the two of them and that being a monumental reason\n\nfor Grace to have to be supportive of Jonathan.\n\n[muffled chatter]\n\nWell, another fine mess I've gotten you into.\n\nThat right there is an example of me being the kind\n\nof actor I was always told not to be.\n\nThe first job I ever did in the 80s,\n\nthe operator said, Don't turn into one of those old actors\n\nwho knows exactly where the camera is.\n\nAnd I realize I have\n\nbecause I actually pause my line slightly\n\n'cause I'm aware of the camera is behind Noah's head,\n\nand I wait until it emerges again\n\nbefore I say the next word.\n\nWell, another fine mess I've gotten you into.\n\nI'm quite in the mood here. I'm quite in the moment.\n\nThe last thing you want is for someone to say afterwards,\n\nCan we just go again because we lost half your line\n\nbehind the boy's head?\n\nSo you just don't want to lose a good take\n\nfor some stupid technical reason.\n\nBut you don't do that thing\n\nbecause it's very, very visible.\n\nWhen actors are playing to the camera,\n\nYou go, Ah, let me get out of here. [laughs]\n\nAnd you haven't done that once, even, not remotely.\n\nDid you kill her? No.\n\n[baby cries in background]\n\nThis would be a terrible conversation\n\nto have with your son, nevermind having it in a prison,\n\nand Hugh plays this with such a depth and such a rawness.\n\nI thought about you, Mom,\n\n[soft tense music]\n\nso I came back, which may have been selfish again,\n\nbut, you see, I wanted my family back.\n\nWe're never gonna be a family again.\n\nWell, I desperately hope we will be.\n\nCome here, come here.\n\nAt this point, Henry has found the hammer.\n\nWe just don't know he's found it.\n\nThe whole thing of this whole series\n\nis that nothing is what it seems.\n\nAt that point, Henry know his dad has done it\n\nbut still love his dad.\n\nJonathan believes that it's inconceivable\n\nthat he will go to prison.\n\nHe's too great. He's a star doctor, star healer.\n\nHe's been a star all his life.\n\nAll right. Come on, Henry.\n\n[footsteps thud]\n\n[Henry sobs]\n\nThere's so many things right now where you go,\n\nWhat is definition of truth?\n\nHow do we relate to it?\n\nAnd that is the subtext of this whole series.\n\nIt's right in front of Grace all the time,\n\nand she refuses to see it, as does the audience.\n\nAnd everybody seem to be wanting Jonathan not\n\nto be the killer in spite of it being blatantly clear\n\nthat he was and he always was."
