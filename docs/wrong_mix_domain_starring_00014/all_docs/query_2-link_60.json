        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Freddy in the freezer\n\nThe first episode kicks off with a nod to the film, while also establishing some key details about Eddie's brother, Freddy Horniman (Daniel Ings). Viewers learn he's a gambling addict who owes a Liverpudlian firm of gangsters £4 million, plus interest.\n\nTo make it clear that they mean business when it comes to getting their money back, they lock him inside a walk-in freezer for long enough for him to look like an icicle, before telling him he has a week to get them their money.\n\nAt the end of the 2019 film, Mickey forces Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) into a freezer and tells him that he'll freeze to death unless he transfers him £270 million for trying to take over his business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. The Glass family works out of a gym\n\nOnce Eddie establishes a working relationship with Susie Glass (Kaya Scodelario), the drug dealer managing all the weed farms, he meets her and her brother Jack (Harry Goodwins) at a gym where the pair work out of. This is mainly because Jack is training as a boxer.\n\nIt's a similar setup to what Coach (Colin Farrell) and his crew, called the Toddlers, had in the film. Coach keeps the gang in check by making them box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. White Widow Super Cheese\n\nThe weed being grown under the Halstead estate is managed by Jimmy (Michael Vu) an eccentric botanist with a taste for his own product. All the strains have different names, but the show name-drops one in particular: White Widow Super Cheese.\n\nIt's the same strain of weed that Pearson sells in the movie, which raises the question of whether his organization is involved with the Glass family.\n\nBut the Netflix show never provides an answer, maybe Ritchie will reveal more if Netflix gives the go-ahead for season two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Freddy's humiliation\n\nIn the first episode, Eddie and Susie pay off Freddy's debts to Tommy Dixon (Peter Serafinowicz), one of the deputies in the Liverpudlian gang.\n\nBut their agreement involves Tommy forcing Freddy to dress up in a chicken costume on camera and pretend to be a chicken. It's all about embarrassing the aristocrat so that he'll never get in debt with the gang again.\n\nThe film also used a similar method of humiliation with newspaper editor, Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), who attempts to blackmail Pearson and ruin his business. As a way of quashing the potential threat, Coach and his gang kidnap and drug Dave, before forcing him to film a compromising video with a pig.\n\nIt's never revealed what actually happened between Dave and the pig, but the squeals coming from the video paint a pretty horrifying mental picture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Stanley Johnston's meth business\n\nEddie is determined to get his family out of the weed business throughout the whole series. In the first episode, he even flirts with the idea of selling his entire estate to a mysterious businessman, Stanley Johnston (Giancarlo Esposito), who is desperate to get his hands on the land.\n\nThe sharp-suited Johnson wants to buy the estate because to get a slice of the Glass' business to grow his own lucrative empire. His organization sells meth, which is a clear nod to Esposito's infamous role as Gus Fring in \"Breaking Bad,\" and \"Better Call Saul.\"\n\nThe ruthless drug kingpin in the AMC series makes Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) work for him from season 2, until his death at the end of season four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The barbecue and steak\n\nSusie might be the face of the weed business but it's her dad, Bobby Glass (Ray Winston), who's pulling the strings from his conveniently lenient prison. He might be locked up, but he's still living a good life, with access to a cosy outdoor veranda, complete with its own high-end barbecue.\n\nAt the end of the second episode, Bobby hosts Eddie and Susie at the prison and cooks them some wagyu steak during their meeting.\n\nThat veranda barbecue set up is similar to the one in Raymond Smith's (Charlie Hunnam) garden in the film. He even cooks wagyu steaks for a sleazy journalist, Fletcher (Hugh Grant).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Mercy the car dealer has a similar job to Rosalind Pearson\n\nAs Eddie gets pulled further into the underworld by Susie and her gang, he gets roped into carrying out a few criminal operations to help the business run like clockwork.\n\nThat includes stealing a very expensive Lamborghini in episode three to smooth things over with an Albanian gang whose weed supply has been disrupted.\n\nThe car in question is owned by Mercy (Martha Millman), a vicious car dealer who runs her own garage and dealership. It's a similar parallel to the women-only garage, run by Rosaline Pearson (Michelle Dockery) in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Another blackmailing journalist\n\nSure, Hugh Grant might be best known for playing charming English men in beloved romcoms including \"Bridget Jones' Diary,\" \"Love Actually,\" \"Notting Hill,\" and \"About a Boy.\"\n\nBut in \"The Gentlemen,\" he played sordid reporter Fletcher, who threatens to reveal the details of the weed operation unless he pays him £20 million.\n\nIn the fourth episode of the series, another blackmailing journalist becomes a key part of the story. Frank (John Thomas) tries to squeeze money from Max Bessington (Freddie Fox) for his large collection of Nazi memorabilia — which includes Hitler's testicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Caravan negotiations\n\nEpisode five features a nod to one of Guy Ritchie's most famous movies, \"Snatch,\" when Susie and Eddie try to negotiate with a group of travelers to help them ship some of the weed from the Halstead estate.\n\nAs the travelers confer with each other in hushed tones, it's noticeably similar to the moment in \"Snatch\" where bare-knuckle boxer Mickey (Brad Pitt) tries to haggle with Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) for a caravan in \"periwinkle blue.\"\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
