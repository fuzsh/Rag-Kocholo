        "text": "Hugh Grant may have been cast in a film about a chocolate factory, but according to its director, it was not for his sweet nature.\n\nGrant was chosen to play a surly Oompa Loompa because “he can be a real s---”, Paul King, the director of the new Willy Wonka film, has revealed.\n\nRoald Dahl’s fictional chocolate maker is given a new backstory in a prequel, titled Wonka, with Timothée Chalamet in the lead role.\n\nGrant was right for the part of Oompa Loompa because it was felt that “as a real s---” he could properly deliver the diminutive creature’s often cutting remarks, King said.\n\nA trailer for the film shows Grant’s face grafted onto the CGI-generated body of an orange Oompa Loompa with its distinctive green hair.\n\nThe actor’s tiny character is seen performing a dance in a nod to the musical numbers performed by Wonka’s assistants in the original 1971 adaptation of Dahl’s novel.\n\nThese insulting Oompa Loompa songs, directed at the overly rotund or irritating children visiting the Wonka factory, have been described as “incredibly sarcastic and judgmental and cruel” by King.\n\nHe wanted a star capable of matching the meanness of the original Oompa Loompas, and so turned to Grant.\n\nHe explained to the Hollywood Reporter: “I was really just thinking about that character; somebody who could be a real s---.\n\n“And then ‘ah, Hugh’. Because he’s the funniest, most sarcastic s--- I’ve ever met.”\n\nThe director previously worked with Grant on Paddington 2 in which the actor played the villain.\n\nKing’s new film tells the story of eccentric chocolatier Wonka attempting to establish his business in a closed-shop market, where his unorthodox ways are not welcome.\n\nIn a trailer for the film, the character of Wonka, played by Chalamet, is seen talking to Grant’s Oompa Loompa, who appears to be contained in a glass jar.\n\nWonka asks “So you’re the funny little man who’s been following me?” to which the creature responds: “I will have you know that I am a perfectly respectful size for an Oompa Loompa.”\n\nThe small captive then begins performing a dance to the rhythm of the Oompa Loompa song in the 1971 film, which starred Gene Wilder as Wonka.\n\nIn these original musical numbers, the Oompa Loompas critique the children visiting the chocolate factory for eating, getting “terribly fat” or “chewing all day long” like a cow.\n\nThe cutting nature of the lyrics was retained from Dahl’s original 1964 book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but other aspects of the Oompa Loompa characters have been altered since then over concerns about racism.\n\nIn the original novel, the creatures “imported” to staff Wonka’s factory were effectively slaves from Africa who were black, wore animal skins, and were paid in cacao beans.\n\nDuring Dahl’s own lifetime, he agreed to soften their image and make them lighter-skinned “little fantasy creatures”.\n\nIn the 1971 film version, they were said to be “transported” from Loompaland in Africa, rather than “imported”.\n\nThe trailer for the new prequel suggests that the Oompa Loompas’ acquaintance with Wonka is voluntary rather than one related to the unpaid labour of the original book, with Grant’s character said to have “followed” the chocolate maker.\n\nThe film is set to be released on December 15."
