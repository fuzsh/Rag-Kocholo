        "text": "“Every good thing in this world started with a dream.”\n\nThese are the wise words Willy Wonka’s mother imparts to him in the new fantasy film Wonka. The movie is a Willy Wonka origin story, following the future business magnate as he attempts to build his chocolate and candy-making factory while fighting off competitors, greedy landladies, and a certain Oompa-Loompa who secretly steals candy at night (looking at you, Hugh Grant). The movie musical, directed by Paddington director Paul King, is magical in every sense of the word — the set design pops off the screen, the songs are rich and plentiful, the humor is lighthearted and sharp, and the costumes are vibrant and colorful. But it is the movie’s messaging that really gives Wonka its charm.\n\nAn ode to celebrating your inner child, Wonka encourages the audience to think about their childhood fantasies and all the amazing things that can grow from a simple dream. The film casts Timothée Chalamet as a young Willy Wonka, while Olivia Colman, Keegan-Michael Key, Natasha Rothwell, Hugh Grant, and newcomer Calah Lane round out the cast. On the eve of the film’s premiere, Shondaland got a chance to interview the all-star actors and director about what dreams they may still want to pursue and how they’re making space for their own inner child, both in their careers and in their personal lives. From writing a novel to wanting to fly, the Wonka cast are ready for their dream-filled destinies.\n\nMARIEL TURNER: This film is all about dreams and celebrating your inner child. What’s one dream that you would still like to fulfill?\n\nTIMOTHÉE CHALAMET: I would like to keep working on movies with Keegan and people I look up to. And then, continued good health for my family. That’s always No. 1. Nothing is luckier than when people are in good health. … Somewhere within me, I do have that relentless spirit of optimism and positivity [that we see in the film]. And then, we try to tap into that. [Willy Wonka] never takes no for an answer.\n\nCALAH LANE: I want to make a movie. Like my own — not me acting in it. I want to make a movie, like, behind the scenes. I want to direct it, and I want to write it just like [director] Paul [King] did. I want to do something like that. I want to try behind the scenes.\n\nTimothee Chalamet attends the Warner Bros. Pictures world premiere of Wonka at The Royal Festival Hall on November 28, 2023 in London.\n\nNATASHA ROTHWELL: I want to write a book. Yeah, I think I want to write a book. I feel like I’m never accused of not talking too much — usually, it’s the opposite. So, I have lots of thoughts and ideas, and I would love to sort of … I want to help people. I think that’s just my personality generally. So, just to say something that would be helpful to people in a book. I feel like being in this industry, you hit all of these walls and moments where you do feel boxed in or pigeonholed. And especially as women of color, I think being able to understand that there’s a way through — and it has to be creative sometimes given our experiences — but I think for me, what I love about the character of Piper is she doesn’t go straight into helping herself. She goes into helping Willy, and there’s a selflessness that we see. And because of that, she also finds a way to find happiness. And so, it’s about collaboration and seeing the value of the people around you even in the hardest circumstances. [The movie] shows the power of people and how we can help each other and inspire hope.\n\nKEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY: I think I am passionate about my [personal] life. My life with my wife, Elle [Key]. I want that to be the best it can possibly be. And so, I put a lot of effort into that, you know. I think it’s a healthy obsession [laughs].\n\nPAUL KING: I’ve been so incredibly fortunate. And, you know, it’d be nice to fly [laughs]. But I’m not sure that it’s gonna come true any time soon. I think what’s nice about the way we look at this subject — we’re always telling young people, “Work hard, and your dreams will come true.” And that’s a wonderful message. But I guess what seems fun to me in this movie is that Willy is this very naive, wide-eyed person going out into the world. He’s got that message, and he’s taking it to heart. And he realizes that the world isn’t always the kind, welcoming, supportive place that it should be. There’s this line in [the song] “Pure Imagination” that always really spoke to me: “Want to change the world; there’s nothing to it.” And I thought, “Oh, this comes from somebody who’s realized that sometimes you have to drive the change that you need to let yourself become the best possible version of yourself.”\n\nI think the film is really about the joy of families [too]. And not just of the families that we’re born into and the sort of lasting impression they leave, but the families that come together. The found families, and at its best, making a film is like that. You come together with this cast and crew of incredibly talented people, and you’re able to work together just for a short time before you inevitably go your own ways. It’s such an honor and a delight, and it’s a pleasure.\n\nMariel Turner is the Senior Culture Editor at Shondaland. Follow her on Twitter at @mariel_turner."
