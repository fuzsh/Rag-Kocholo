        "text": "Hi I'm Mary Jane Ford and I was the costume designer\n\non the original 2004 movie, Mean Girls.\n\nI'm going to break down\n\nCady's transformation through her costumes.\n\n♪ Jingle bell jingle bell ♪\n\n♪ Jingle bell rock ♪\n\n♪ Jingle bells swing ♪\n\n♪ And jingle bells ring ♪\n\n♪ Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun ♪\n\n[smacking]\n\n♪ Now the jingle hop has begun ♪\n\nWhat I love about film is it's a puzzle\n\nand every little piece is really important\n\nand so what a costume designer does is works\n\nvery closely with the actors\n\nto help them become the character.\n\nWell the process for putting together the costumes\n\nfor Mean Girls was take what is real.\n\nSo we started with looking at yearbooks\n\nand looking at what children and girls in schools\n\nactually did wear and there's a tremendous amount\n\nof research and we sort of allowed ourselves\n\nto go into the version of a candy store.\n\nEverything bright and shiny and sweet and delightful\n\nis what we chose to illustrate plastics with.\n\nAt the time it was like Paris Hilton\n\nand that genre of young women that were you know,\n\nsophisticated and spent a lot of money on clothes\n\nand thought a lot about what they would wear.\n\nCady comes into this American high school world\n\nand so if you'll look at what she actually wears\n\nthrough, in her transformation,\n\nyou know she's a simply dressed teenager\n\nand then she lands in this place that's very foreign\n\nto her with these girls and these personalities\n\nand these cliques that are very foreign\n\nto her and so she gradually changes.\n\nIt was such a great script and the dialogue is so amazing\n\nthat we all would pretty much follow through\n\nwith the guidance of what was written,\n\nand I don't really recall anything drastically changing.\n\nShe gets invited to sit down with these girls\n\nand she doesn't really know what she's been invited to do.\n\nSo you've actually never been to a real school before?\n\n[bouncy music]\n\nShut up!\n\nRegina has on her power suit.\n\n[thudding] She has on her high boots\n\nand she's got her collar turned up\n\nand her dark sweater that makes her look\n\nlike she's the boss and the one in charge.\n\nGretchen has her sweater on but it's, you know,\n\na little softer with the pattern and she forgoes the shirt\n\nbecause she doesn't wanna be exactly like Regina.\n\nKaren just tries to be a little bit somewhere in between\n\nand she's got her sweater on.\n\nSo if you'll look at the two of them, definitely you see\n\nthat Regina's got the major costume\n\nand they both just balance her out.\n\nWe wanna invite you to have lunch with us\n\nevery day for the rest of the week.\n\n[bouncy music]\n\nOh, it's--\n\nCoolness, so we'll see you tomorrow.\n\nOn Wednesdays we wear pink.\n\nWhat we really wanted to do in this is have her costume\n\nbe completely different from what they would wear.\n\nShe has on no earrings, no necklace,\n\nher shirt is a little bit, if you'll look,\n\nit's not pressed and it's not pristine, if she was plastic\n\nshe would have on a blouse more like that.\n\nCady has on jeans which is not allowed.\n\nHer shirt is not tucked in,\n\nwhich again, is not allowed.\n\nAnd it's just not as form fitting as the other girls.\n\nOh my god I love your bracelet,\n\nwhere did you get it?\n\nOh my mom made it for me.\n\nThe bracelet is an African tribal bracelet.\n\nShe's using what she has, so that's her jewelry.\n\nSomething that's very authentic and wonderful\n\nthat she had from her former life.\n\nIt's so fetch.\n\nCady's breaking all sorts of rules\n\nbut she doesn't even know it.\n\nYou can't wear a tank top two days in a row,\n\nand you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week.\n\nSo I guess you picked today.\n\nIn this particular scene she has tried to wear pink\n\non Wednesday and she borrows the shirt from Damian.\n\nDo you have anything pink?\n\nNo.\n\n[laughs] Yes.\n\nHugely oversized as he is a much bigger person\n\nbut here would be Cady if she wore something\n\nthat actually fit her.\n\nAnd she's still got the jeans because again\n\nthis is sort of all she has.\n\n120 calories and 48 calories from fat,\n\nwhat percent is that?\n\nSo a little bit dramatic.\n\nWithin the realm of the time that this was made,\n\ngraphic tee shirts were quite the thing\n\nand so we wanted to use them where we could,\n\nand so we were trying to come up with different things\n\nthat different girl's shirts could say\n\nand a little bit dramatic just seemed\n\nto fit perfectly for Regina George.\n\n[ominous hip music]\n\n[Cady Voiceover] Unfortunately, no one told\n\nme about the slut rule.\n\nSo I showed up like this. [upbeat hip music]\n\nAt this point in the story,\n\nCady's been invited to the Halloween party\n\nand she's really excited.\n\nSo she's starting to feel like that they're really\n\nall gonna be great friends. Hey!\n\n♪ Faces in the mirror ♪\n\nSo in this particular dress,\n\nactually came from a thrift store\n\nbecause that's where Cady would get a Halloween costume\n\nand so her mom took it in for her,\n\nso she's, things are fitting her a little bit better now.\n\nStill when you see the other ones completely not there yet\n\nand then she added the blood herself\n\nand did her teeth herself, and you know,\n\nshe put her own veil on and I wanted it to look\n\nas different from the others as it possibly could look.\n\nSo in Gretchen's costume she's completely covered up\n\nbecause that is her conservative way\n\nbut you finally see her form fitting shape.\n\nThis is literally made out of a heavy duty stretch plastic\n\nwhich gives her that reflection and that shine\n\nand then her tiny little reference\n\nto being a cat are the ears.\n\nAnd it's the same with Karen as a mouse.\n\nHer only reference to being a mouse\n\nare the mouse ears.\n\nThe colors and the textures\n\nwith all the different reflections,\n\nthey really are utilizing their plastic style.\n\n♪ Jingle bell jingle bell ♪\n\nAt this point in the story Cady's there.\n\nShe's in the fold and she is dressing like them,\n\nwants to become one of them,\n\nand you can see clearly that her parents\n\nare horrified by the thought.\n\nBoth she and Regina have done\n\nthe showing the little bit of tummy.\n\nSo she's copying.\n\nI really wanted to use plastic.\n\nSo again, their skirts are made out of plastic.\n\nSanta Claus would never get away with this.\n\nAlso, I wanted it to look like something that they,\n\nin theory, could've put together for themselves.\n\nThe top was a tank top, that fringe was added,\n\nand then the skirts we had made.\n\nI have a feeling that the boots and probably the gloves\n\ncame from you know, a lot of stuff\n\ncomes from stripper stores.\n\nAnd then the hats I really think\n\nI probably got them at Party City.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Cady Voiceover] Because being with the plastics\n\nwas like being famous.\n\nThis is Cady's presenting herself as a plastic,\n\nand she's got the shoes, she's got the walk,\n\nshe's got the short skirt and she's done it.\n\nCady is now wearing high heeled patent leather shoes\n\nto look just like all the other girls.\n\nShe's not wearing tennis shoes\n\nlike the non-plastics.\n\n♪ Pop that, pop that ♪\n\n♪ Jiggle that fat ♪\n\n♪ Don't stop, get it till ya clothes ♪\n\nYou know she falls in the trash can.\n\n[yelling]\n\nAnd so, one of the things always when there's a stunt\n\ninvolved is how can it look and be the way\n\nthat the costume and the character would want it to be,\n\nand then how can it work for the stunt.\n\nSo I needed and wanted something\n\nthat when she's sticking out of the trash can\n\nalmost like tissue paper coming out of a paper bag.\n\nSo that's what I was thinking\n\nof when I designed this costume.\n\nWe needed layers so that she would be protected.\n\nSo you have the underneath layer and then adding the tight\n\nfitting hoodie on top of it and then the skirt\n\nfor when it sticks out of the trash can.\n\nIt's got this ruffly layer.\n\nI'm sorry, I can explain.\n\n[scoffs] Explain how you forgot\n\nto invite us to your party?\n\nWell she has dissed her real friends\n\nto have this party and she's trying to get Aaron Samuels\n\nand she doesn't go to Janice's art opening\n\nand chooses to do this instead\n\nand she bought this dress on her own.\n\nIt was a strapless dress and we decided together,\n\nLindsay and I that she wanted something more\n\nand so we decided to add the bra.\n\nAs, at that point in time it was a fashion statement\n\nand so then we decided to pick up on that to make it look\n\nlike Cady's really tried.\n\nYou know, she picked up on the earrings\n\nwhich are the same color as the bra strap.\n\nOh and the choker.\n\nYeah, she wanted a necklace, Cady did,\n\nand didn't really have anything\n\nso that's something she had leftover.\n\nIt's a leather strap that she pulled off\n\nof one of her bracelets.\n\nShe took something from her past life\n\nand adapted it from her African days.\n\nHere, you can have this.\n\nIt won a prize.\n\n[dark brooding music]\n\n[car humming]\n\nShe's beginning to feel regret\n\nand she's realizing that these were really,\n\n[sighs] these are really her friends.\n\n[gentle happy music]\n\n[Cady Voiceover] I had gone from homeschool jungle freak\n\nto shiny plastic to most hated person in the world\n\nto actual human being.\n\nThis is at the end.\n\nSo it's the next school year and so she's learned a lot.\n\nWell and for this particular scene she's back into jeans\n\nwhich were you know, sort of taboo.\n\nJust wanted her in a simple, simple white light,\n\nnot patterned, not anything distracting,\n\njust almost a teenage version of ethereal\n\nin jeans and a tee shirt.\n\nAnd with these jeans, I mean what she wore in the beginning\n\nwith her plaid shirt were just basic\n\nand so now she's, she did learn from the plastics\n\nto go shopping and get a few things\n\nand so she's into her form fitting,\n\nslightly flared jeans and she's got boots on.\n\nNot tennis shoes, not flip flops.\n\nShe learned and modified them.\n\nThis is the real Cady because it shows\n\nwhat has happened to her in the past year.\n\nIt shows her transformation washed away\n\nand she's come back and she's you know,\n\nshe's genuine but she has picked up\n\non a bit and I think she had to learn that to come back\n\nto who she really is.\n\nI'm happy to have contributed to something\n\nthat people like to see and I think it was also\n\nAriana Grande who used the costumes from Mean Girls\n\nand I think we are all delighted that what we contribute\n\nto a story stays and that people still like to see it.\n\nThat was notes on the scene from Mean Girls.\n\nThanks so much for watching.\n\n[audience cheering]"
