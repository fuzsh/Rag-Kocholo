        "text": "1\n\nHaley Lu Richardson:\n\nDani, Midsommar\n\nFlorence Pugh has played a lot of iconic characters, but what really put her on the map was her leading role in 2019’s thriller, Midsommar. As it turns out, the part of Dani — a psychology student who ends up in a cult-like Swedish community — could have gone to another young Hollywood favourite. In a new interview with Backstage, The White Lotus’ Haley Lu Richardson revealed that she was sent the script for the project. However, she turned it down as it was too “disturbing.”\n\n“They wanted to meet me. I had actually done Split, I think, a year or two before. And I was like, ‘I don’t want to do another disturbing movie right now. I just don’t have it in me, going around and crying at these disturbing things. It wasn’t something that I wanted, and I felt really strongly about that. So I didn’t even take the meeting.”\n\n2\n\nRachel McAdams:\n\nAndy Sachs, The Devil Wears Prada\n\nWhile Anne Hathaway has played plenty of iconic characters in her career, Andy Sachs is one of her most famous. Perhaps, surprising then that the role was actually first offered to Rachel McAdams. The actor recently revealed to Bustle that she was requested on three occasions to play Andy in The Devil Wears Prada, following her success in Mean Girls and The Notebook. However, instead of taking the role of the fringed fashion magazine assistant, McAdams left for her native Canada for a two-year mental health break from Hollywood.\n\n“I felt guilty for not capitalising on the opportunity that I was being given, because I knew I was in such a lucky spot,” McAdams told Bustle. “But I also knew it wasn’t quite jiving with my personality and what I needed to stay sane.” While the role eventually went to Hathaway, McAdams did end up playing a somewhat similar character as television producer Becky in 2010 rom-com Morning Glory.\n\n3\n\nNicole Kidman:\n\nAnna Scott, Notting Hill\n\nIt’s a romcom favourite and one of Julia Roberts most iconic film role’s — which Nicole Kidman was dying play. Notting Hill (1999) follows the cynical and glamorous Hollywood movie-star Anna Scott, who during a press tour in London, falls for a bookshop owner William Thacker (Hugh Grant).\n\nWhile promoting their psych-thriller series The Undoing (2020), Kidman revealed to co-star Grant she could have starred alongside him years ago. “I think there was something where I think I really wanted a role … maybe I was gonna do a small role in Love, Actually at one point,” Kidman said during a Marie Claire feature. “Yeah. Yes.” Grant asked, “Were you? Which part?” asked Grant, to which Kidman replied, “I can’t remember. It was not a big role. And I really wanted the role that Julia Roberts played in Notting Hill.” Kidman continued and said, “Yeah, I did. But I wasn’t well known enough, and I wasn’t talented enough.”\n\n4\n\nChristina Applegate:\n\nElle Woods, Legally Blonde\n\nCould you imagine anyone else originating the “bend and snap?” Well, turns out Christina Applegate could have played our favourite law student in pink. Applegate revealed to ET Online in July, 2015 that the Legally Blonde script initially came her way — however she was hesitant to take on another “dumb blonde” role since her series Married … with Children had just concluded.\n\n“I got scared of kind of repeating myself,” she began. “What a stupid move that was, right?” Despite this, Applegate is happy Reese Witherspoon scored the 2001 role. “Reese deserved that. She did a much better job than I ever could, and so that’s her life. That’s her path.”\n\n5\n\nAnne Hathaway:\n\nTiffany, Silver Linings Playbook\n\nIt’s the role which saw Jennifer Lawrence win a Best Actress Oscar at just 22 years old — which makes it a little tricky to consider anyone else playing Tiffany. But Anne Hathaway was actually disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s first choice for the part in Silver Linings Playbook. However, Hathaway reportedly turned down the part due to “creative differences” with director David O. Russell. She still had her moment though, also winning an Oscar that year, for Best Supporting Actress in Les Misérables.\n\n6\n\nMolly Ringwald:\n\nVivienne, Pretty Woman\n\nAnother iconic Julia Roberts film, which could have been played by a then bigger star. Molly Ringwald, notable for her hit coming-of-age ’80s films such as The Breakfast Club and 16 Candles, was offered the part of Vivian in a bid to break the high school mould. “I don’t specifically remember turning it down,” she began, before acknowledging that Pretty Woman was made for Roberts. “The script was okay but I gotta say, Julia Roberts is what makes that movie. It was her part. Every actor hopes for a part that lets them shine like that.”\n\n8\n\nEmma Watson:\n\nMia, La La Land\n\nMia from the critically-acclaimed La La Land (2016) could have been played by another Emma. Director Damien Chazelle, who has since created Babylon, previously revealed to Uproxx that Emma Watson was meant to play the lead female role. “The casting of this movie during the six years it took to get made went through lots of permutations, and it’s true there was a moment where Emma Watson and Miles Teller were doing it.” But perhaps it was all for the best as Watson took on the lead role in Disney’s live-action film adaptation of Beauty and the Beast and Emma Stone won the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal."
