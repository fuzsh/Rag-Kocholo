        "text": "‚ÄúI live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name. ‚Äú William Thacker (Hugh Grant)\n\nRomantic comedies, or films in general, don‚Äôt get much better than this! Thoroughly delightful, this 25-year-old British film gets better with each viewing. Part of that is the charm of Hugh Grant at his zenith here, the loveliness of a radiant Julia Roberts, and a script that is witty and insightful.\n\nAnother part of that is the shallow competition that has replaced romantic comedies with vulgar and crass American gross out films like American Pie (premiering the same year, 1999), The Hangover (2009), and Bridesmaids (2011), to name a few. No wonder the English think all Americans are crass fools, and no wonder again that Notting Hill became the highest-grossing (not gross out) British film of all time.\n\nMaybe a little like what Anthony Burgess once said about curry, ‚ÄúLike a performance of Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony. It stunned, it made one fear great art.‚Äù\n\nIn fact, Notting Hill reminds Different Drummer of some other wonderful quotes about food:\n\n‚ÄúCooking is like love. It should be entered into with abandon or not at all.‚Äù ‚ÄìHarriet Van Horne\n\n‚ÄúI raised to my lips a spoonful of the cake. A shudder ran through my body.‚Äù ‚ÄìMarcel Proust\n\nA dessert, the light poetry of the kitchen.‚Äù ‚ÄìGeorge Ellwange\n\n‚ÄúCrepes: One taste would reform a cannibal into a civilized gentleman.‚Äù ‚ÄìEdward Prince of Wales\n\nWhich is, of course, ironic since many of the running gags in the film are about food atrocities, food faddists, and some of the truly horrible things that people eat.\n\nThe section with Hugh Grant‚Äôs William and the fruitarian is among the best:\n\nWilliam Thacker: What exactly is a fruitarian?\n\nKeziah: We believe that fruits and vegetables have feelings, so we think cooking is cruel. We only eat things that have already fallen off a tree or bush, that are, in fact, dead already.\n\nWilliam Thacker: Oh, all right. Interesting stuff. So, these carrots...\n\nKeziah: ‚Ä¶have been murdered, yes.\n\nBut more of that in our Film-Loving Foodie section below.\n\nAnother thing that makes this film a classic and one that towers over Love Actually (2003) ‚Äì where England four years later seems to be aping American vulgarity ‚Äì is the innocence. Yes, William‚Äôs roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans) is completely outrageous but harmless, even if he is talking while strutting around in his underwear or flaunting said image to the paparazzi. Spike is the exceptional freak, more or less, and we actually find him a romantic at heart and the only one who actually has sense when William must make the most important decision of his life.\n\nScene about going out with her.\n\nNotting Hill edges out another Hugh Grant film, Two Weeks Notice (2002), as well. Although that is a fun romp, Sandra Bullock‚Äôs awkward unknown nerd here playing against Grant‚Äôs stylish, womanizing playboy, lacks the chemistry of his awkward and thoroughly dreamy romance with Julia Roberts.\n\nAdditionally, the ensemble acting in Notting Hill is superb as well, especially at the birthday dinner for William‚Äôs sister, where part of the fun is that no one except the birthday girl herself (Emma Chambers as the star struck Honey) even realizes that Anna Scott is famous. They are all about as unworldly, na√Øve, and outwardly unsuccessful as William himself.\n\nAn astonishingly young Hugh Bonneville of Downtown Abbey fame playing William‚Äôs friend Bernie is hardly recognizable, and his conversation with Anna is hilarious in an understated English sort of way. When Anna tells him she is an actress, he assumes she is of the struggling variety.\n\nNot the biggest star in the universe:\n\nBernie: So tell me Anna -- what do you do?\n\nAnna: I'm an actress.\n\nBernie: Splendid. I'm actually in the stock market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that. 'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.' Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?\n\nAnna: Well, they can be.\n\nBernie: I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life. What sort of acting do you do?\n\nAnna: Films mainly.\n\nBernie: Oh splendid. Well done. How's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?\n\nAnna: Fifteen million dollars.\n\nBernie: Right. Right. So that's... fairly good. On the high side... have you tried the nuts?\n\n***\n\nUnlike the nihilistic films today, Notting Hill teases us with a sorbet of cynicism like a palate cleanser to give the next course a fresh perspective.\n\nHow about Julia Roberts as Anna shedding the truth about fame?\n\nI‚Äôve been on a diet every day since I was nineteen, which basically means I‚Äôve been hungry for a decade. I‚Äôve had a series of not-nice boyfriends, one of whom hit me. Ah, and every time I get my heart broken, the newspapers splash it about as though it‚Äôs entertainment.\n\nOr maybe her anecdote about Rita Hayworth and Williams‚Äôs na√Øve reaction to it, which amplifies its meaning:\n\nAnna Scott: Rita Hayworth used to say, \"They go to bed with Gilda; they wake up with me\".\n\nWilliam Thacker: Who's Gilda?\n\nAnna Scott: Her most famous part. Men went to bed with the dream; they didn't like it when they would wake up with the reality.\n\nAnd finally the most famous line in the film:\n\n‚ÄúI'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.‚Äù\n\n***\n\nHugh Grant‚Äôs William tells it like it is, too:\n\nAnna Scott: Probably best not tell anyone about this.\n\nWilliam Thacker: Right, no one. I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes, but don't worry. I won't believe it.\n\nOr his unadorned, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if I‚Äôve taken love heroin, and now I can‚Äôt ever have it again.‚Äù\n\nNot to be missed. Certainly to be enjoyed all over again. The intervening years and the ensuing film flotsam make this classic even better.\n\n‚ÄìKathy Borich\n\nü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Å1/2\n\nTrailer"
