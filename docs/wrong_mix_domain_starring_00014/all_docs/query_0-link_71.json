        "text": "THE 2003 chick flick Mean Girls starring Lindsay Lohan is arguably one of the most iconic teen movies of all time.\n\nAnd with quotes like this \"Nice wig Janis, what's it made out of?\" \"Your mom's chest hair!\" it's not surprising it's so memorable.\n\nWhat are the best quotes?\n\nThe film sees Cady Heron join a new school, finding herself in a clique called \"the Plastics\".\n\nThis elite group consists of Cady Heron, Gretchen Wieners, Karen Smith, and Regina George.\n\nThe awesome foursome came up with some great lines... as did the rest of he cast.\n\nTake a look at the best here...\n\nCady Heron\n\nThe main character Cady is played by Lindsay Lohan.\n\nHer quotes might not be the most notable, but she definitely has a few you'll remember.\n\n\"On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.\"\n\n\"It's not my fault you're like, in love with me, or something!\"\n\n\"I don't know, I mean, she's so weird, she just, you know, came up to me and started talking to me about crack.\"\n\n\"Grool. I meant to say great but then I started to say cool.\"\n\n\"How can Janis hate her? She's such a good... SL*T!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I like math. And food\"\n\nRegina George\n\nQuite possibly the queen bee of iconic quotes as well as being the queen bee of North Shore High, Rachel McAdams' character Regina delivered some standout lines.\n\n\"That's the ugliest effing skirt I've ever seen\"\n\n\"I gave him everything! I was half a virgin when I met him\"\n\n\"Boo, you w***e!\"\n\n\"I love her, she's like a martian!\"\n\n\"You can take that fake apology, and shove it right up your hairy- [gets hit by a bus]\"\n\n\"So you've never been to a real school before? Shut up. Shut up!\"\n\n\"I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend… so, just promise me you won't make fun of her.\"\n\n\"Jason, you do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later...so you can go shave your back now.\"\n\n\"Whatever, I'm getting cheese fries.\"\n\n\"Why do you wear your hair like that? Your hair looks so sexy pushed back. Cady, will you please tell him his hair looks sexy pushed back\"\n\n\"Get in, loser, we're going shopping.\"\n\n\"Is butter a carb?\"\n\n\"This is Susan from Planned Parenthood, I have her test results. If you could have her call me as soon as she can. It's urgent, thank you.\"\n\nGretchen Weiners\n\nGretchen is played by Lacey Chabert and is obsessed with making \"fetch\" a common slang term... but fails.\n\n\"Oh my god, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me. But I can't help it that I'm popular.\"\n\n\"You let it out, honey.. put it in the book.\"\n\n\"If only you knew how mean she really is... You'd know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right? Yeah! Two years ago she told me hoops earrings were *her* thing and I wasn't allowed to wear them any more. And then for Hanukkah my parents got this pair of really expensive white gold hoops and I had to pretend like I didn't even like them and... it was so sad. And you know she cheats on Aaron? Yes, every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep but really she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium! I never told anybody that because I am *such* a good friend!\"\n\n\"That's so fetch.\"\n\n\"I mean, no offence, but why would she send you a candy cane? She doesn't even like you that much.\"\n\n\"Irregardless! Ex-boyfriends are just off limits to friends. I mean, that's just like, the rules of feminism!\"\n\n\"Why should Caesar just get to stomp around like a giant while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet? Brutus is just as cute as Caesar, right? Brutus is just as smart as Caesar, people totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar, and when did it become okay for one person to be the boss of everybody because that's not what Rome is about! We should totally just STAB CAESAR!\"\n\n\"Trang Pak is a grotsky, little byotch.\"\n\n\"Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin.\"\n\n\"Make sure you check out her mom's boob job. They're hard as rocks.\"\n\nKaren Smith\n\nBefore Mamma Mia! Amanda Seyfried found fame as Karen Smith in Mean Girls.\n\n\"So that's against the rules, and you can't sit with us.\"\n\n\"So if you're from Africa, why are you white?\"\n\n\"Do you wanna do something fun? Do you wanna go to Taco Bell?\"\n\n\"I can't go out. *cough, cough* I'm sick.\"\n\n\"I'm a mouse, duh.\"\n\n\"I can put my whole fist in my mouth! Wanna see?\"\n\n\"It's like I have ESPN or something.\"\n\n\"Gretchen, I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhoea at Barnes & Noble.\"\n\n\"On Wednesdays, we wear pink.\"\n\n\"My breasts can always tell when it's going to rain.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but he's my first cousin.\"\n\nMs Norbury\n\nPlayed by Tina Fey, the woman behind ALL of the quotes, Ms Norbury is a hilarious teacher who gets falsely accused of being a drug dealer.\n\n\"Raise your hand if you have ever been personally victimised by Regina George?\"\n\n\"Oh, hi. Did you wanna buy some drugs?\"\n\n\"Ok, so we're all here 'cause of this book, right? Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sl*ts and w***es. It just makes it OK for guys to call you sl*ts and w***es. Who here has ever been called a sl*t?\"\n\nDamian: \"My nana takes her wig off when she is drunk.\" Ms Norbury: \"Your nanna and I have that in common.\"\n\nDamian Leigh\n\nPlayed by Daniel Franzese, he's too gay to function apparently, but as we all know, that's only OK when Janis says it.\n\n\"I WANT MY PINK SHIRT BACK! I WANT MY PINK SHIRT BACK!\"\n\n\"She doesn't even go here!\"\n\n\"FOUR for you Glen Coco! You GO Glen Coco.\"\n\n\"And none for Gretchen Wieners. Bye.\"\n\n\"She asked me how to spell orange.\"\n\n\"That's why her hair is so big. It's full of secrets\"\n\n\"Don't look at me.\"\n\nMORE MOVIE NEWs\n\nJanis Ian\n\nJanis, portrayed by Lizzy Caplan, is best pals with \"too gay\" Damien.\n\n\"God! I am so sorry Regina. Really, I don't know why I did this. I guess it's probably because I've got a big *lesbian* crush on you! Suck on *that*! AY-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI!\"\n\n\"Regina George... How do I begin to explain Regina George?\"\n\n\"You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, J.V. jocks, Asian nerds, cool Asians, varsity jocks unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don't eat anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually active band geeks, the greatest people you will ever meet, and the worst. Beware of plastics.\"\n\n\"That one there, that's Karen Smith. She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet.\"\n\n\"Evil takes a human form in Regina George. Don't be fooled because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing sl*t faced ho-bag, but in reality, she's so much more than that.\"\n\n\"Regina George is not sweet! She's a scum-sucking road w***e, she ruined my life!\"\n\n\"Wow, Damian, you've truly out-gayed yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I love seeing teachers outside of school. It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.\"\n\n\"There are two kinds of evil people in this world. Those who do evil stuff and those who see evil stuff being done and don't try to stop it\""
