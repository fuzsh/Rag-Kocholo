        "text": "Mean Girls is 16 years old, but a four-way phone call still sends shivers down our spines.\n\nAnd the original stars of the classic teen movie have proved they are just as savage nearly two decades on.\n\nLindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert have reunited to recreate one of Mean Girls’ most iconic scenes, and it is soooo fetch.\n\nIn an outtake from their reunion earlier this week, the actresses y played out their characters’ vicious four-way phone call in the movie over Zoom.\n\nIn the scene, Regina George (McAdams) badmouths Gretchen Wieners (Chabert) and Karen Smith (Seyfried) while on the phone to new friend Cady Heron (Lohan), saying that Gretchen isn’t pretty and that people forget about Karen because she’s ‘such a slut’.\n\nRegina then hangs up, to reveal that Gretchen was actually on the line – with Gretchen then calling in Karen to tell her what Regina said.\n\nHowever, things get even messier when Regina calls Karen to get her to go out – with the phone call ending with the iconic line: ‘Boo, you w***e.’\n\nThe clip was shared by Katie Couric in her newsletter after she gathered the cast of Mean Girls for a special reunion in an effort to get more people to vote in the presidential election.\n\nLindsay, 34, also shared the clip to Instagram, writing: ‘Mean Girls Phone Call! reunited.’\n\nCady and the Plastics – minus Rachel, who was out of town at the time – were joined by co-stars Tina Fey (the film’s creator and Mrs Norbury), Ana Gasteyer (Cady’s mum), Lizzy Caplan (Janis Ian), Daniel Franzese (Damian), Jonathan Bennett (Aaron Samuels), Tim Meadows (Principal Duvall) and Rajiv Surendra (Kevin G) as they raised awareness for HeadCount with Katie Couric.\n\nOn the reunion Zoom call, the cast discussed their favourite lines and scenes, with Tina Fey revealing that Amy Poehler had cocktail sausages stuffed in her bra for the scene where a dog chews on Mrs George’s breast implants.\n\nThis is the trivia we live for.\n\nMean Girls, released in 2004, follows Cady Heron as she moves to the US from Africa, only to find herself masquerading as one of the popular girls in a revenge plot.\n\nWhile we’re still waiting on a sequel (no, that Mean Girls 2 with a different cast doesn’t count), we will be getting some form of new Mean Girls big screen content, as a movie adaptation of the Mean Girls musical – itself based on the original movie, which is based on a book – is in the works.\n\nOur heads hurt.\n\nMORE : Drag Race Holland’s eliminated queen Madame Madness on failing to impress judges after shaving off iconic beard"
