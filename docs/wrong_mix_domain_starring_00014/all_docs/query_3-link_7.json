        "text": "I hate Hugh Grant ... with a passion ... he's so drole ....\n\nI also cant stand yer wan from Sex and the City .... the main one .....\n\nLukily, last weekend I got to watch a film with him and her in it ... Somethin about the Morgans .... Oh such tripe !!!!!!\n\n0\n\nLike Jennifer Aniston he always seems to play the same type of character in pretty much everything he does. I think Bridget Jones was his one time he stepped out his safety net.\n\nAny1 agree?\n\nI could not agree more with you on both actors and actresses mentioned. Hugh Grant did do Extreme Measures with Gene Hackman which was a thriller but it was poor. Jennifer Aniston also did a thriller but I do not know the name of it and I do not think it was particularly successful because she is stronger at romantic comedies.\n\n0\n\nI never think you get your moneys worth from his movies\n\nHe always looks so bored and it's like he's just going through the motions whilst wanting to be somewhere else.\n\nI just don't understand the appeal.\n\n0\n\nYep. He is a boring, type-caste, samey actor.\n\nBut i have respect for him as a person. He was talking about it on the Jonathan Ross show and he was like \"I'm a very limited actor, theres only so much i can do, it's a job you know\"\n\nSo he knows he's nothing special. He seemed quite level headed and likeable in that interview.\n\nbut yeah as far as acting goes...he's nothing above average.\n\n0\n\nActually, as much as I'll get flamed for saying this, I'd say you're pretty much stating fact there... he is the same character in everything, but when he's so charmingly beffudled with everything, who can resist? :rolleyes:\n\n0\n\nI quite liked him in Sense and Sensibility and thought he was brilliant in About a Boy although he was probably just playing himself in that!\n\n0"
