        "text": "“Are you interested in learning more about the church of Jesus Christ?”\n\nTwo young missionaries knock on the wrong door to talk about God, only to find they might have just met the devil!\n\nA24 unveiled the trailer for its upcoming horror movie “Heretic,” directed by Scott Beck and Ryan Woods and starring Hugh Grant, Sophie Thatcher, and Chloe East. The 2-minute 23-second teaser opens with Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East’s characters walking through a neighborhood, trying to get people to listen to them talk about their church. Unfortunately for them, it starts to rain, but this doesn’t deter them from going door-to-door. They are eventually welcomed by a genial old man (Hugh Grant) who offers them pie. However, as he heads to the kitchen, the girls realize something is amiss, and to their horror, they find themselves trapped in the house.\n\nThe girls become pawns in a twisted challenge set forth by the man in his maze-like home. He gives them two doors to exit, but neither might lead them to the outside world. “Do not be afraid. You will witness a miracle,” the old man tells the girls. After playing Oompa Loompa in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and Thurl Ravenscroft in “Unfrosted,” fans are looking forward to seeing Hugh Grant as a psychotic villain in “Heretic.”\n\nWill the girls survive the old man’s trap? The trailer sets an intriguing tone for this faith-themed horror thriller. Watch the trailer on YouTube, it’s also embedded below."
