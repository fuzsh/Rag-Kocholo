        "text": "He played Aaron Samuels in Mean Girls\n\nWhen Ariana Grande recently dropped the music video for 'thank u, next' there was much excitement as it clearly had a number of Noughties film influences throughout it including, Bring it on, Legally Blonde and the 2004 hit teen comedy, Mean Girls.\n\nNow, Jonathan Bennett, who starred as Aaron Samuels in the popular film, has revealed how he ended up in Ariana Grande's music video saying, \"It’s why I love Ariana Grande, because she gives her fans what they want\".\n\nThe actor spoke to Buzzfeed about his involvement in the video saying, “With all the craziness going on in the world right now, to just put this video out…you just smile when you watch it ’cause it’s just fun.”\n\nJonathan explained what it was like to reprise his character from 14 years ago saying, “After every take, everyone would just applaud and laugh and be so excited. With all the c--p that’s happened to her in the past year, to be around all these things that make her happy, you can totally see that shining through.\"\n\nThe Mean Girls actor went on to say how he hadn't had his hair straightened, a signature characteristic of Aaron Samuels, for a LONG time explaining, \"I hadn’t had that done in 14 or 15 years, so to have that done and then look in the mirror for the first time with the blue sweatshirt on, it definitely gave me chills.\"\n\nAriana dropped her new music video late last week after teasing fans for a while with clips, clearly taking inspiration from a number of early 00s films. Starting with Twitter, she posted a black and white photo of herself wearing a cheerleading outfit.\n\nThen, taking to her Instagram Stories she posted a number of photos and videos from both the upcoming music video and the original film. One post included a colour photo of Ariana with the song name written across it.\n\nNow take a look at the biggest films from 2017 according to Empire magazine:\n\n'thank u, next' is a song about Ariana's past relationships and the lyrics mention a number of her ex-boyfriends including, Big Sean, Mac Miller and her ex-fiancé Pete Davidson. Here are some of the lyrics:\n\n'Thought I’d end up with Sean\n\nBut he wasn’t a match\n\nWrote some songs about Ricky\n\nNow I listen and laugh\n\nEven almost got married\n\nAnd for Pete I’m so thankful\n\nWish I could say thank you to Malcolm Miller\n\nCause he was an angel'\n\nNow take a look at Ariana's transformation from teenage TV star to worldwide pop sensation:\n\nYou can hear songs from Ariana Grande on Hits Radio."
