        "text": "Knives Out, aka our favourite murder mystery franchise, is set to return for a third installation, with a stellar cast in tow.\n\nEarlier this week, writer and director, Rian Johnson, took to Twitter to confirm the film, titled Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, was officially in the works.\n\n“The next Benoit Blanc mystery, the follow-up to Knives Out and Glass Onion, is called Wake Up Dead Man,” he wrote.\n\nAt the same time, Netflix also shared that Daniel Craig will be reprising his role as Benoit Blanc, writing, “That’s right, Daniel Craig is back as the suave Southern investigator in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, a new instalment of the whodunnit franchise written and directed by Rian Johnson. Blanc will be unravelling a brand-new murder mystery in an as-yet-undisclosed setting, surrounded by a new colourful cast of suspects.”\n\nOf course, there’s since been plenty of speculation around who will be cast alongside Craig — particularly as the first two films drew an A-list lineup, including Ana de Armas, Toni Collette, Madelyn Cline, Kate Hudson, and Hugh Grant.\n\nNow, it looks like we might have some answers – and it’s everything we’d hoped for and more. Read on for more details.\n\nWho Is Cast In Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery?\n\nThe latest big names to round out the star studded cast of Knives Out 3 are Mila Kunis and Glenn Close. They’re set to be joined by Andrew Scott, aka the Hot Priest, Challengers star Josh O’Connor, and Cailee Spaeny, who starred in Priscilla.\n\nAnd months earlier, Instagram gossip page Deux Moi reported that Lohan and Hardy were being eyed for roles in the upcoming film. If the rumours are true, it would be Lohan’s biggest movie since her return to acting, having starred in the Netflix rom-com Irish Wish earlier this year, and making a small cameo in the Mean Girls reboot. It would also be Hardy’s first film in four years, having most recently portrayed Al Capone in Capone, back in 2020.\n\nWhat Will Knives Out 3 Be About?\n\nWith the film only just confirmed, details around the plot are still scarce. For now, we’re just absorbing the magic of this title reveal video – and trying to spot any Easter eggs in the process."
