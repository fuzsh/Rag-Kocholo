        "text": "For those wondering what a McDLT was…\n\nThe point of this piece is about separating ideas… or having more than one idea at the same time.\n\nThis is an issue for the nation, no matter what the motivations of the wannabe assassin yesterday are found out to be. There are the facts - of which we still have few - and the postures, which are endless, heightened by the events of the day.\n\nBut let’s not forget that the hysteria of the last 2 weeks that was overwhelming the nation - Biden’s age - was also caused by one brief event… and a lot of attached and intense feelings.\n\nBefore you get to claiming that I am comparing the 2 events as to their severity, I am not. A gun shot can be less powerful than a microphone… but the threat of murder is of a higher order by any measure. My point is, the obsessive focus of the nation can turn on a dime.\n\nThe illusion of permanence is comforting. But it is not real. Things change in a way that is not in our control. (And not to make light, but movie fans, if you have never seen Mamet’s Things Change, go out of your way to find it and watch it.)\n\nBut this piece is about Hollywood and mostly, box office… so that is yet another demand for perspective.\n\nI wrote Thursday’s piece on Longlegs and its potential box office because a friend was waving a big flag in my face for a week and then Neon fed Deadline a $3 million estimate for Thursday previews in the morning and I decided to try to build some perspective before the events of the still-unfinished weekend happened.\n\nThere are now 26 Summer Horror movies (feel free to quibble with some of the included or not included) that have opened to more than $20 million in the history of cinema.\n\nAnd if you look at this list by date, you will see one of the more interesting things… that unlike most of the movie business, Horror’s most successful summer movies have rolled out pretty consistently over the last 25 years.\n\nWant to leave off The X-Files in 1998? Ok. Hard to say DreamWorks’ release The Haunting doesn’t count in 1999. A week later in 1999, The Blair Witch Project.\n\nI don’t want to get into a lesson on how the frontloading of the box office revved up in the late 90s because the distributors wanted it and major exhibitors came out of mid-90s bankruptcies and restructured the exhibition business anew into an almost exclusively multiplexed world that allowed for adding screens for big or unexpected openings. You’ll just have to take my word for that today. But like all movie genres, horror openings benefited.\n\nBut the most compelling thing about the chart above is that Neon has done what very few, if any, true independents has done… cracked that $20 million Summer Horror mark. Artisan caught magic in a bottle with Blair Witch in 1999. Dimension split off from Disney in 2005 and had MGM release Halloween in 2007, while MGM was still considered a major. Rogue had distribution through Universal in 2008. And Lionsgate, the major-esque indie, released The Last Exorcism in 2010 and Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark in 2019.\n\nSo I think it is completely fair to say that this is the most impressive Summer Horror opening for a true indie since Blair Witch.\n\nSo what does it mean for Neon?\n\nIt means they have now accomplished what any true indie since the heyday of Orion and October and USA and Gramercy, etc, in the late 80s has accomplished. That standout true indie of this era would be A24, really. Both have Oscar winning and multiple Oscar-nominated titles. Each distributor now has one $20 million-plus opening. And both are highly respected for their taste and ability to push movies into the marketplace that rise above expectations.\n\nTo put in in political parlance, this opening places the 2 true indie theatrical companies from Lean A24 to Toss-Up. (Searchlight still holds a slightly different place.)\n\nIt’s a great moment of Neon.\n\nBoth Neon and A24 have more in the tank for this year. Neon pushes out Cuckoo (which I actually think is a better film than Longlegs) next month. A24 has Hugh Grant creeping it up in Heretic in November. Neon has the Cannes Palme d’or winner, Anora, landing in October. A24 has the romance We Live in Time in October and the Nicole Kidman thriller Babygirl in December.\n\nWe should all be celebrating these indies becoming more and more muscular and seemingly capable of anything they aspire to… which is not to suggest they always win… but that they offer the endless possibility of surprise.\n\nBut as we celebrate Neon’s moment - and they deserve fruit baskets from everyone - let’s remember that the hot should stay hot and the cool should stay cool.\n\nNeon and A24 alone cannot solve what ails indie cinema. Nor can Searchlight and Focus and Sony Classics. Or whatever still exists at Amazon… if anything does. (I like the team that has been UAR and Orion… I breathe a sigh of relief every time I see them working a new movie. Amazon still confuses me so much.)\n\nAs I read Anthony D'Alessandro’s coverage yesterday, I saw this and almost swallowed my (imaginary) gum.\n\nAnthony talks to a lot of smart and powerful people. He is a smart and capable guy. But they keep steering him down these terrible paths.\n\nHere are the last 5 functional years on this weekend in July…\n\n$128 million is nothing to cheer for… “the industry will take it.” That would make the industry a self-destructive fool.\n\nCelebrate your wins! I support that 100%! I am not trying to be a killjoy. But damn it… the rest of us who aren’t celebrating a great success - 80% of the business minimum every weekend - need to keep perspective on what is really happening and not just turning to Anthony to turn the volume up so no one can think.\n\nThis is the 3rd good month out of the first 7 of this year. January, February, April, and May all sucked.\n\nThis is the 6th straight $100 million overall weekend… and there were 4 out of 5 weekends in March… and just barely, Memorial Day’s 3-day.\n\nThat’s 11 weekends over $100 million. By Weekend 28 last year, there were 21.\n\nAnd blaming the strikes… kinda bullshit.\n\nYes, there were a few movies moved out of the first 6 months of the year because of the strikes. Not a lot. Out obsessive compulsive friends at Wikipedia list a total of 36 theatrical titles that moved in the wake of the strikes. But only 14 that were originally scheduled for release in the first 28 weekends of 2024.\n\n3 of those 14 have already been released this year. 6 more are still due to be released this year, led by Deadpool & Wolverine. 4 of the newly 2025 releases are from Disney… which restructured everything on their release schedule, so blaming the strikes seems iffy.\n\nAnd finally, Mission: Impossible 8… which after M:I7 having 7 different release dates before coming out, one must wonder if they will make the May 23 date next year, regardless of the strike. Would they have made May 28 this summer without the strikes? Are you kidding?\n\nWho knows what might have happened had the 2023 titles that moved into the first 28 weekends of 2024 had not moved? Only 8 total movies made that move… and of those, only Dune II, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and Challengers, all March releases, were major releases. What would March have looked like without them?\n\nThe Fall Guy and A Quiet Place: Day One slot into March. Disney’s Elio and Snow White would both have moved regardless of the strike. Mickey 17 was not moved because of the strikes. So March would have been weaker.\n\nThe only April release that moved was the Lord of the Rings cartoon… which is better dated at Christmas and what was the delay because of the strikes… for a cartoon?\n\nNo doubt, May would have gone better with Deadpool and Wolverine launching it. But that opens up the July questions… would Disney’s 2 movies really have opened on their July dates? How well would have Venom 3 done?\n\nYes… the disruption was real. And as I must keep pointing out, chosen by the studios that refused to negotiate for months and then settled both strikes in less than a month at the table with serious negotiations. (Again… the semantics matter. AMPTP didn’t meet with SAG for more than 2 straight months, literally. Zero talks. WGA broke it up more, but add up weeks without meets and it is also months of time wasted by AMPTP.)\n\nBut what 2024 is suffering is a lack of titles - high, low, and in the middle from the studios whose releases generally have historically had a bottom of $20 million and the ability to make surprise hits with great marketing - and not The Strikes.\n\nWant to blame The Strikes? Let’s talk in August, September, October, November and December. Here are all the scheduled releases from the majors…\n\nAUGUST\n\nTrap\n\nHarold & The Purple Crayon\n\nAlien: Romulus\n\nThe Crow\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nSpeak No Evil*\n\nTransformers One\n\nWolfs\n\nThe Wild Robot\n\nOCTOBER\n\nJoker 2\n\nSmile 2\n\nVenom 3*\n\nNOVEMBER\n\nHere\n\nGladiator II\n\nWicked\n\nMoana II\n\nRed One\n\nDECEMBER\n\nKraven*\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\n\nSonic 3*\n\nMustafa*\n\nThere are a lot of big swings there… and bless them, one and all.\n\nAm I rooting for Alien: Romulus and Trap to keep August from falling into a hole when D&W falls under $50 million a weekend? You’re damn right I am! And I hope Dick Jokes & Mutton Chops goes over $50m every weekend for the entire month!\n\nBut then comes September and we’re all praying for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice having enough muscle to carry an entire entire month. Then Joker & Harley… then please be the biggest Broadway conversion of all time being seen by every girl at least 3 times... and pray that Disney can make their islander D+ scraps into a home run feature… then it’s all about Disney sucking more billions out of The Lion King.\n\nThat’s a lot of “better work out”-ing.\n\nWhat is missing is all the filler. Some of it would surely have showed up if it wasn’t for the 6 down months of The Strikes last year. I won’t be surprised if a couple more titles show up in the next few weeks. But how can you have any pudding if you don’t distribute your meat? To a high degree, this is a choice, not a result of The Strikes.\n\nThe Top 5 movies did (by estimate) $109.8 million this weekend. The same weekend last year, $116.3 million. Okay. Happens. Can’t control the top of the charts.\n\nBut the rest of the titles on the weekend chart? We are down another $6 million from last summer on that side too. There were 9 movies this weekend grossing over $1 million… 12 last summer on this weekend. There are just 2 titles in the market grossing over $1 million for this weekend in their 5th weekend or later… there were 5 of those at this time last year.\n\nThe audience is out there. But they are being cock-blocked by the studios both in the big releases and the small.\n\nStill, we have allegedly smart people writing about CinemaScore numbers and the number of seats sold, in some kind of delusion that forces them to look for anything but what is right in front of them.\n\nAnd it can all be fixed. It’s not complicated. Or all that expensive… certainly compared to Streaming shows. Make a bunch of minor, entertaining, audience movies! Some will be crap. A few might be stardust. You can make 8 movies for $200 million and if 1 hits big, it’s all paid for. You can make 20 Longlegs… though you can’t always find the right talent (you can always hire Cage) or take the care with the release that Neon did… or, going back, Paramount did with Paranormal Activities or, for that matter, what Universal and Blumhouse did for M3GAN and Cocaine Bear.\n\nOf course, just yesterday, I was pointing out that we have a buttload of horror/thriller movies already coming. So make some damned comedies. Make some dramas. Get aggressive about making smaller budget titles that could break out… or not and not cost you a fortune. We are in the era of Streaming content budgets of $8 billion to $15 billion a year… spend some damned money… the little bills… the ones you light your cigars with.\n\nYou know damned well that all this, “You used to need good movies… now you need great movies” is utter bullshit. It’s rarely been about the product. Yeah, it’s great to have great product and long legs. But you set up this system that is obsessed with opening weekend… so go get your opening weekends before anyone knows it’s great or crap. That is the business. (This is when I go nuts about all the films that have been released with incredibly uncommitted campaigns this year. I’ll restrain myself.)\n\nMaybe David Ellison and Jeff Shell will be the ones to send up fireworks and rethink - or retro-think - the whole thing and save the industry that we have known for decades, but which is always in need of fresh paint. At this juncture, we need some new ideas. I am amused and am comfortable mocking the media boot licking of last year… but I am rooting for you. Go get Illumination… and Blumhouse… and make Comedy Central into the comedy place that tops Netflix, you crazy kids!\n\nMaybe Shell will take the post-theatrical windowing formula that he helped create at Universal and look around and move it another 2 or 3 weeks back, which is really what is needed in the post-COVID industry. Maybe not.\n\nBut I am happy for Neon today. And for all the others, from A24 to Searchlight to Sony Classics, etc, who live in this part of the movie exhibition space that needs a lot more loving care these days.\n\nAnd I continue to SCREAM… we need to do better… we need to aim higher… the audience is not your problem… your best financial position is diversified… but you have to do it instead of undermining and then just blithely telling the media, “Well, you know… the strikes… COVID… kids today… the streaming…” It’s lazy. And it’s wrongheaded. And it’s destructive of your industry, even if you figure you will be retired when the 15,000 and 1st movie theater shutters for lack of consistent product.\n\nBest to everyone of all beliefs on a scary weekend. (And yes, I mean the assassination attempt, not Fly Me To The Moon.)\n\nUntil tomorrow…\n\nShare"
