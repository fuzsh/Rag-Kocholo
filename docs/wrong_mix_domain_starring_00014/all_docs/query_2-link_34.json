Their best-known tunes, which also include \"I Need You,\" \"Ventura Highway,\" \"Don't Cross The River,\" \"Tin Man,\" \"Lonely People,\" and \"Sister Golden Hair\" were cornerstones of 1970's Top 40 and FM rock radio. Yet beyond their impressive catalog of hits, listeners would discover there was always much more to AMERICA than surface perceptions. The combination of melodic pop rock and folk-jazz elements, slinky Latin-leaning rhythms and impressionistic lyric imagery contrasted well with other more traditional country-rock leanings and highly personal lyrics.\n\nAMERICA's albums--six certified gold and/or platinum, with their first greatest hits collection, History, hitting four plus million in sales--displayed a fuller range of the trio's talents than did their singles. Their material encompassed an ambitious artistic swath; from effects-laden rockers to oddball medleys to soul-bearing ballads, AMERICA displayed a flawless blend of disparate genres and styles as wide-open as the great American plains.\n\nEnjoying massive success early in their career, AMERICA earned their stripes as musical soldiers on the battlefield amidst the excess, craziness, and chaos of the 70's. The trio won the Grammy for Best New Artist in 1972 and began working with George Martin and Geoff Emerick in 1974. This successful team went on to record seven albums and several Top Ten hits, including \"Tin Man,\" \"Sister Golden Hair\" and \"Lonely People.\"\n\nTheir growth as singers, songwriters and musicians has continued into the present day as illustrated by landmark releases such as 2000's Highway 3-disc box set, 2002's Holiday Harmony, an album comprised of seasonal classics and live showcases, 2007's Here & Now, 2009's Live In Concert: Wildwood Springs, 2011's Back Pages, and 2015's Lost And Found and America: Archives Vol. 1.\n\nIn 2020, the band released their ultimate 8-disc anniversary box set, Half Century (America Records), and streamed their concert special America--Live at the London Palladium for the very first time (it is commercially available as a DVD and CD). 2020 also saw the release of the book “America, the Band, An Authorized Biography” by journalist Jude Warne. She weaves original interviews with the band and many others into a dynamic cultural history of AMERICA, the band, and America, the nation. Billy Bob Thornton wrote the foreword.\n\nAs further testament to the band’s staying power and influence, AMERICA’s recordings have been licensed for a multitude of placements in films (including American Hustle, The Nice Guys, The Last Unicorn and Girl Most Likely), television shows (among them The Sopranos, Friends, Breaking Bad and Saturday Night Live) and video games (including Grand Theft Auto). See their Soundtrack credits on IMDB here: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2085638/\n\nFrom their formative years, AMERICA has been a band capable of transcending borders with its uplifting music and positive message. Embracing a rainbow of divergent cultures, America's audiences continue to grow, comprising a loyal legion of first, second and third generation fans, all bearing testament to the group's enduring appeal.\n\nFor more information on AMERICA, visit:\n\nWEBSITE | FACEBOOK | TWITTER | INSTAGRAM\n\nPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n\nBERGLUND SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER\n\nTickets: $20 in advance\n\nParking: $5\n\nBUY WEEKEND PASS BUY SATURDAY PASS BUY SUNDAY PASS\n\nBUY WEEKEND PARKING BUY SATURDAY PARKING BUY SUNDAY PARKING\n\nBig Lick Comic Con – Roanoke returns August 3-4th to the Berglund Center in Roanoke, VA\n\n$35.00 EARLY BIRD WEEKEND CELEBRATOR PACKAGE INCLUDES:\n\n-Entry to Saturday & Sunday of Big Lick Comic Con – Roanoke\n\n-Hologram Laminate Pass & Lanyard\n\n-20% off any official merchandise at Big Lick Comic Con\n\n-Entry to Celebrator Pre-Party on Saturday, July 13th with giveaways, entertainment, food & more – location to be announced\n\n-Early Entry at 10am on Saturday, August 3rd\n\n-Dedicated Entry Line on Saturday, August 3rd\n\nSingle Day Passes:\n\nSaturday, August 3rd – 11am Entry – Single Day Pass – $17.00 Early Bird Special (3/15/2024-6/5/2024), $19.00 Individual (6/6/2024 – 8/2/2024), $20 Day Of\n\nSunday, August 4th – Single Day Pass – $16.00 Early Bird Special (03/15/2024- 6/5/2024), $17 after 6/5/2024 and day of\n\nVenue Parking:\n\nSold by Berglund Center – due to increased attendance this guarantees your parking at the venue – $5 per day or $8 for weekend parking – on sale Friday, March 15th at 10am through venue website and box office.

They eventually found themselves in Boone, North Carolina where they caught the attention of folk icon Doc Watson while playing in front of a pharmacy. He invited the band to play at his festival, MerleFest, and the rest is history. It’s been over twenty years since these humble beginnings. The band has gone on to receive the honor of being inducted as members of the Grand Ole Opry and have won two Grammy Awards: “Best Folk Album” for Remedy (2014) and “Best Long Form Music Video” for Big Easy Express (2013). Additionally, their classic single, “Wagon Wheel”, received the RIAA’s Double-Platinum certification in 2019 for selling over 2,000,000 copies while the band’s debut album O.C.M.S. has been certified Gold (500,000 copies). The band’s latest release is ‘Jubilee’ (Aug 2023) released via ATO Records.\n\nWith Support From:\n\nAt a time when most people feel constantly distracted by technology and barraged by the news, authenticity and straightforward honesty are paramount. There’s something about the music of The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys that cuts right through the noise of the world and speaks plainly to the soul. Formed ten years ago in the Smoky Mountains in 2014, The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys are at once exactly what you would expect and not at all what you would expect from a tattooed East Tennessee Bluegrass outfit. But they take pride in being ambassadors of their genre, and the group has brought their music from rural bluegrass festival stages to the rock clubs of Europe, with stunning results.\n\nInstagram @poramblinboys\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/poramblinboys\n\nWebsite: theporamblinboys.com\n\nFull 2023 IBMA Red Hat set on NPR Live Sessions: https://livesessions.npr.org/videos/the-po-ramblin-boys-live-from-ibma\n\nPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n\nBerglund Center Coliseum\n\nDOUBLE HEADER\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nMore information to come!\n\nPolicies and Procedures\n\nBERGLUND SPECIAL EVENTS CENTER\n\nTickets: $35 plus processing for 18+ and $25 plus processing for under 17 as well as $75 plus processing for VIP\n\nBUY WEEKEND PASS BUY DAILY PARKING SATURDAY BUY DAILY PARKING SUNDAY BUY WEEKEND PARKING\n\n08/23/24 - Friday – 4PM - Midnight\n\n08/24/24 – Saturday - 9AM – Midnight\n\n08/25/24 – Sunday - 9AM – 8PM\n\nWelcome to Roanoke’s Premiere Gaming and Fan Convention!

Proudly hailing from Northeast Texas, he has quietly asserted himself as the ultimate country rockstar, bulldozing the boundaries between Nashville songcraft, rowdy Texas spirit, and rainswept Seattle hard rock. After moving 1 million units under the radar and popping off as one of the hottest live performers in the game, he welcomes everyone to the party on his 2022 full-length offering, Hell Paso [Columbia Records].\n\n“I did what I wanted to do,” he exclaims. “This was straight up me. Nobody told me to do this record. We pulled in every genre we were feeling at the time. We spent the last ten years trying to make this sound —Hell Paso is it.”\n\nNever compromising, Koe might just be the last real rebel out there. The Gold-selling singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer shakes up the status quo, shatters expectations, and sticks to his guns with a sound steeped in country storytelling, yet spiked with grunge grit. He’s unapologetic, undeniable, and unlike anyone else you’ve ever heard. Without anything to prove and nothing to lose, he continues to kick ass on his own terms. Breaking through with a series of independent releases and tallying over 1.3 billion streams to date, he has impressively notched three RIAA Gold-certified singles, including “February 28, 2016,” “Something To Talk About,” and “Drunk Driving.” The latter adorned his 2020 Columbia Records debut, Sellout, which arrived to widespread critical acclaim from American Songwriter, Billboard, The Boot, Rolling Stone, and more. At the same time, he has quietly emerged as a powerhouse performer. He graced Pollstar’s “Top Worldwide Tours” back-to-back in 2020 and 2021, moving hundreds of thousands of tickets in the process. In addition to headlining his own Koe Wetzel’s Incredible Music Festival, he has packed arenas, amphitheaters, and ballparks across North America, attracting a devout audience.\n\nFor more on Koe, visit Koe Wetzel: About (koewetzelmusic.com)\n\nPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n\nBerglund Center Coliseum\n\nTicket Prices: $149.75, $99.75, $79.75, $59.75, $39.75\n\nParking: $10.00\n\nShow Start time: 7:00pm\n\nSEATING CHART BUY TICKETS PARKING PASS\n\nJim Gaffigan is a seven-time Grammy nominated comedian, actor, writer, producer, two-time New York Times best-selling author, three-time Emmy winning top touring performer, and multi-platinum-selling recording artist.
