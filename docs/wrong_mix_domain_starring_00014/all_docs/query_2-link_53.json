        "text": "MORE than 20 years after the original premiered, the cast of Freaky Friday has returned to reprise their roles.\n\nOn August 3, 2003, Jamie Lee Curtis, 65, and Lindsay Lohan's, 37, lives turned upside down and backward in the comedy film.\n\nFreaky Friday was a reboot of the 1976 film starring Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster and based on the book by Mary Rodgers.\n\nTess (Jamie Lee) and Anna (Lindsay) have completely different personalities and have trouble getting along.\n\nHowever, things completely change for them after they both read a fortune given at a Chinese restaurant by an employee that causes them to switch bodies.\n\nThe mother-daughter duo have to work together to figure out how to change back while also gaining respect and perspective from each other.\n\nEarlier this week, it was revealed that Freaky Friday 2 was officially in production after the two stars shared photos on social media.\n\nHowever, the movie was revealed to be happening months earlier.\n\nTake a look at what the original cast looks like now, 21 years after the movie was released.\n\nCHAD MICHAEL MURRAY\n\nChad Michael Murray, 42, was known as a teenage heartthrob in the early 2000s.\n\nAfter playing Anna's (Lindsay's character) love interest in Freaky Friday, Chad went on to play the lead role of Lucas Scott in One Tree Hill.\n\nIn 2004, Chad appeared alongside Hilary Duff in the comedy A Cinderella Story.\n\nOther movies and shows Chad appeared in include House of Wax (2005), Scream Queens (2015), Agent Carter (2015-2016), and Riverdale (2019).\n\nChad has also been in many Hallmark Channel Christmas movies.\n\nThe Gilmore Girls actor recently appeared in the Netflix film Mother of the Bride with Brooke Shields, which premiered in May.\n\nLINDSAY LOHAN\n\nLindsay was a household name during the early 2000s while appearing in hit movies like Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and Mean Girls.\n\nDue to this, she gained tons of media and paparazzi attention, and her public and personal life was talked about heavily in magazines - which caused major setbacks.\n\nLindsay dealt with substance abuse and found herself in trouble with the law where she spent some time in jail and rehab.\n\nIn 2016, she moved to Dubai, where she currently resides.\n\nShe returned to acting in 2021 where she starred in Netflix's Falling For Christmas a year later.\n\nIn 2021, she revealed she was engaged to financier Bader Shammas.\n\nTwo years later in 2023, they welcomed their first child, a son named Luai.\n\nIn March, she appeared in the Netflix film, Irish Wish.\n\nJAMIE LEE CURTIS\n\nSince appearing in Freaky Friday, Jamie Lee went on to star in huge films including Christmas With The Kranks, and The Kid & I.\n\nIn 2006, Jamie revealed she would put a pause on her acting career to focus on her family.\n\nShe has two children: Ruby, 25, and Annie, 34.\n\nHowever, the pause didn't last long as she starred in Beverly Hills Chihuahua in 2007.\n\nOver the years, Jamie Lee has appeared in movies and TV shows such as You Again (2010), Scream Queens (2015-2016), Knives Out (2019), The Haunted Mansion (2023), and The Bear (2023).\n\nJamie returned to her iconic role as Laurie Strode in Halloween (2018), Halloween Kills (2021), and Halloween Ends (2022).\n\nIn 2023, she won her first Academy Award for Everything Everywhere All At Once.\n\nMARK HARMON\n\nActor Mark Harmon, 72, played the fiance of Jamie Lee's character Tess.\n\nThe same year Freaky Friday was released, Mark appeared on the drama NCIS as Leroy Jethro Gibbs.\n\nIn 2008, the star became an executive producer of the crime series - where he remains to this day.\n\nIn 2012, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHe retired his NCIS character in 2021.\n\nIn 2023, Mark wrote a book about World War II with Leon Carroll Jr. called Ghosts of Honolulu."
