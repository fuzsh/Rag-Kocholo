        "text": "It may be Sleep Week here at Reviewed, but really there's no time for sleeping—not when so many new films and series are dropping on streaming services this March.\n\nWhether you're like me and looking to catch up on Oscar winners you missed, or looking for a new, highly watchable series to keep your attention, here are a few streamable options we have our eye on this month.\n\nWhat are we watching in March?\n\n'Napoleon' on Apple TV+ (March 1)\n\nThis March, you can catch Joaquin Phoenix's riveting turn as Napoleon Bonaparte in \"Napoleon,\" directed by Ridley Scott and starring Vanessa Kirby as Napoleon's wife, Joséphine. The film had its theatrical debut last year, and as of March 1, 2024 is available to stream on AppleTV+.\n\n'Mean Girls' on Paramount+ (March 5)\n\nTina Fey's \"Mean Girls,\" a remake of the Broadway musical of the same name (which is based on the 2004 original \"Mean Girls\" film) debuted earlier this year, and now you can stream the film on Paramount+. Reneé Rapp stars as Regina George, alongside Angourie Rice as Cady Heron, Auli'i Cravalho as Janis I'imi'ike, Jacquel Spivey as Damian Hubbard, Avantika as Karen Shetty, and Bebe Wood as Gretchen Weiners. Fey and Tim Meadows reprise their roles from the 2004 film.\n\n'Poor Things' on Hulu (March 7)\n\nWe're keeping an eye out for Oscar winners as they land on streaming services, and Yorgos Lanthimos' \"Poor Things\" starring Best Actress winner Emma Stone alongside Mark Ruffalo, Ramy Youssef, Willem Dafoe, and more is available on Hulu. The film garnered a wide array of accolades at the Academy Awards, including Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling and Best Production Design.\n\nYou can also stream the film if you have a Disney+ subscription, thanks to the recent combined platform streaming offered on the Disney+ app.\n\n'Wonka' on Max (March 8)\n\nTimothée Chalamet stars as the iconic chocolatier and inventor Willy Wonka in a new prequel to the events of Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.\" \"Wonka\" also stars Hugh Grant, Olivia Colman, Calah Lane, and Rowan Atkinson.\n\nThe film debuted in theaters in late 2023, and as of March 8 you can catch the film on Max.\n\n'Shogun' on Hulu (new episodes Wednesdays in March)\n\n\"Shogun\" is one of the best shows streaming right now, and although the series kicked off on February 27, it gets a nod here since new episodes will air all throughout March, on Hulu at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesdays for subscribers and then on FX at 10 p.m. on Tuesdays.\n\nThe series stars Hiroyuki Sanada as Lord Yoshii Toranaga, Cosmo Jarvis as Pilot-Major John Blackthorne, and Anna Sawai as Lady Mariko in an adaptation of James Clavell's eponymous novel about the beginning of civil war in 1600s Japan.\n\n'Dream Scenario' on Paramount+ (March 15)\n\nNicolas Cage fans, rejoice. \"Dream Scenario,\" an A24 film directed and written by Kristoffer Borgli starring Cage as a professor who begins appearing in people's dreams, is making its way to streaming. The film debuted in November of last year, and Cage's performance as Paul Matthews earned him a Golden Globes nomination. If you missed the film's premiere, you can catch it this month on Paramount+.\n\n'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version)' on Disney+ (March 15)\n\nIf you thought the Eras Tour was done, think again. The filmed version of Taylor Swift's massive concert is making its way to Disney+ in the form of \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version),\" which will feature four brand new acoustic songs as well as a fuller version of the song \"cardigan.\"\n\n'Road House' on Prime Video (March 21)\n\n\"Road House\" serves as a remake of the 80s film, with Jake Gyllenhaal starring alongside real-life boxer Conor McGregor. Gyllenhaal plays Dalton, an ex-fighter whose new job at a Florida Keys roadhouse throws him into a web of chaos. The film will premiere on Prime Video, and will be available to stream on March 21.\n\n'3 Body Problem' on Netflix (March 21)\n\nBased on Liu Cixin's sci-fi epic \"The Three-Body Problem\" comes a brand new series from Benioff and Weiss starring Benedict Wong, John Bradley, Jess Hong, Eiza González, Jovan Adepo, Jonathan Pryce, and more. The series explores, among other things, consciousness, connection, and legacy, expanding as ripples from an event in 1960s China. You can start streaming \"3 Body Problem\" on Netflix on March 21.\n\n'Anatomy of a Fall' on Hulu (March 22)\n\nOscar-winning French film \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" written by Justine Triet and starring Sandra Hüeller, Swann Arlaud, and more, is making its way to streaming later this month. The film, which follows the story of a woman working to prove her innocence in her husband's death, snagged the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay this year, and is soon to be available on Hulu starting on March 22, 2024."
