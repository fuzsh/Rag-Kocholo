        "text": "Hugh Grant has said that he dislikes the majority of the films he has appeared in.\n\nThe actor, who plays the lead in upcoming romantic comedy The Rewrite, told The Mirror that he turns down the majority of work he is offered now.\n\nHugh Grant: Nobody wanted me in Four Weddings\n\nGrant, who has had roles in films including Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary, said: \"I have pretty much hated any other film I've ever been in. But I liked this one.\n\n\"Nowadays I pretty much turn everything down anyway, because I just feel too old. Certainly for romantic comedy and certainly for showbusiness in general. Occasionally, they wheel me out.\"\n\nThe actor, who was speaking at the world premiere of The Rewrite, added that he does not consider his new film to be strictly a romantic comedy.\n\n''I know it's being billed as a romantic comedy and I see what they're trying to do, but it's really only partly a romantic comedy,\" he explained.\n\n\"It's also about a man who's sort of lost in life rediscovering himself and finding new things that he actually loves in life.''\n\nGrant also said that his next project will be a \"classy\" film, which he will begin working on next spring.\n\nThe Rewrite stars Grant as a struggling screenwriter who takes on a teaching role as a temporary means of paying the bills after a string of failures. Despite his reluctance, he soon begins to build relationships with his students."
