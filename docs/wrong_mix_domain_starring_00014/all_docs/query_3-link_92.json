        "text": "The audience fondly remembers the 2003 romantic Christmas classic \"Love Actually\" as a film worthy of several rewatches even 20 years after its release. However, some folks surprisingly don't share the same sentiments about the film and actor Hugh Grant happens to be one of them. In a viral TikTok clip from an interview with @moviemaniacs, Grant recalls his memories of filming \"Love Actually.\"\n\nWhile promoting his latest film \"Wonka\" along with his co-star Timothee Chalamet, Grant was questioned about the fan-favorite Christmas hit that follows several stories from the lives of individuals who experience love, loss, friendship and many more emotions during the holiday season. There are loyal fans who still adore the film and continue to rewatch it. However, when Chalamet quipped that \"Love Actually\" is one of the \"best Christmas movies of all time\" the 63-year-old Grant had a polarizing reaction to it.\n\n“If it comes on in your house, what is your reaction to it?” the interviewer asks Grant. He took a moment to ponder about the question and then answered. “Well, I like Colin's bits. Colin Firth's story,” he admits, jokingly. “I've skipped through the rest of it. This is weird because I hate Colin and want nothing but bad for his career. But I do think that's the best part of that film.\" While Firth plays a struggling novelist who finds love in a Portuguese housekeeper after a heartbreak, Grant plays a newly elected Prime Minister of the U.K.\n\nThe audience on TikTok had a lot to say about their memories attached to the \"Love Actually\" as well. @zs109926 wrote, \"I love Hugh Grant & Colin they’re our romcom icons and he gave us the Bridget Jones diary franchise too.\" @molshelena quipped, \"Love Actually is honestly a classic Christmas film! Watch it every single year without fail!' @justus10s commented, \"Apparently everyone hates it in the comments but I think it's still an amazing watch today, I agree with Timothée but it's not my favorite Xmas movie.\" @jussinboston joked, \"Hugh hates being asked about this movie you can tell.\"\n\nAccording to The Guardian, \"Love Actually\" director and screenwriter, Richard Curtis spoke to the outlet in 2013 for the film's 10th anniversary. “This film is my Pulp Fiction. I love multiple storylines, but I soon realized how tricky they are,” Curtis said back then. “At first, we had 14 different love stories, but the result was too long, so four ended up going, including two we'd shot.” Curtis initially began writing with two distinct films in mind. The first featured Hugh Grant and the other featured Colin Firth.\n\nThe films featured expanded versions of what would become actual storylines in Love Actually, so when Curtis became frustrated with both projects, he meshed the storylines into one cohesive film, per Salon. For the 20th anniversary of the film, Grant appeared in ABC’s retrospective special 'The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later' and admitted he hates the scene in which his Prime Minister character, David, dances down the halls of his office to The Pointer Sisters’ song.\n\n“I saw it in the script and thought, ‘Well, I’ll hate doing that’. I didn’t fancy dancing at all, let alone rehearsing it,” Grant admitted. “To this day, there are many people, and I agree with them, who think it’s the most excruciating scene ever committed to celluloid. Then some people like it. But I will give myself this credit and it was my idea to have that secretary lady catch me. Genius.” Well, Grant might hate the sequence by heart but his fans continue to love it."
