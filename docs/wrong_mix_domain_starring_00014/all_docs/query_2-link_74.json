        "text": "Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant have spoken about how they got into character for new HBO drama The Undoing.\n\nSpeaking at a Sky VIP Q&A, ahead of the UK premiere of the brand new series last night, the famous pair – whose characters' lives begin to unravel after a mother of a child at their son’s school is murdered – revealed how they each get into the right frame of mind before filming, with Hugh revealing the rather unusual technique he uses before a tricky scene.\n\nWhile Nicole – who plays psychologist Grace Fraser in the six-part series from Big Little Lies writer David. E. Kelley – explained that she 'absorbs' the character and tries to stay 'very present, open and pliable,' ready to be steered by the director, Hugh – who plays successful oncologist Jonathan Fraser – employs an altogether different approach.\n\nReferencing his time spent filming Florence Foster Jenkins with Meryl Streep, Grant said Streep is 'really vigilant' about working herself into the right emotion before a scene, which has inspired him to do the same.\n\nMeryl Streep with Hugh Grant in Florence Foster Jenkins\n\n'I'm not quite sure how she does it. She just disappears and comes back in the right mood,' he said, explaining to Q&A host Edith Bowman that he now has certain tools that he uses to get him in the right frame of mind.\n\n'I have music. For a sad scene I've got a little playlist called Sad,' he said, revealing that his sad playlist of choice is, in fact, the Military Wives Choir. 'For some reason they make me howl.'\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR THE UNDOING NOW:\n\nKidman has previously worked with Kelley on HBO hit Big Little Lies, but this is the first time Grant has worked with the 'king of American TV' (as he describes him). And we're loving the result so far.\n\nSomething that probably won't surprise Grant. Despite his self-declared preference for not working, he simply couldn't refuse the script for The Undoing, which he described as 'dripping with class'.\n\nThe Undoing is on Sky and NOW TV every Monday at 9pm, or you can watch the whole series on catch up now.\n\nnow to get the magazine delivered to your door."
