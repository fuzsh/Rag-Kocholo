        "text": "Imagine a world where Julia Roberts' Notting Hill character, Anna Scott doesn't exist. Seems practically impossible, right? Well, according to the 56-year-old star, it almost happened.\n\nTo recap, Julia starred in the classic 1999 rom-com as Anna, the famous American actor who falls in love with travel bookstore owner, William Thacker, played by Hugh Grant.\n\nBut while being interviewed by Notting Hill's writer, Richard Curtis for , the Oscar-winning actor revealed how she nearly turned down the part altogether.\n\nTo unpack, Julia explained that playing the role of Anna and taking part in the film was \"one of the hardest things\" she's ever had to do. Simply because she found the idea of \"playing a movie actress\" to be \"so uncomfortable.\"\n\nGranted, during the late 90s, Julia was one of the most famous actors on the planet. The decade had seen her star in a slew of mega-successful (and now iconic) films, including Pretty Woman, My Best Friend's Wedding, Hook and Sleeping With the Enemy. So we can only imagine playing a role semi-similar to her reality felt somewhat strange.\n\nFurther on in the conversation, Julia shared that she and Richard have \"talked about [the film] so many times.\" But that she \"almost didn't take the part because it just seemed so awkward.\"\n\n\"I didn't even know how to play that person,\" she admitted.\n\nNow, 25 years later, we all know she eventually said yes to the role, and being Julia Roberts, of course she played it to perfection. And honestly, we thank our lucky stars every day that she did üôè"
