        "text": "\"The Crown\" doesn't always paint a rosy picture of the royals. So what do Brits think of it?\n\n\"Well, to some of us, it's treason,\" said Hugh Grant, dryly, as the other five actors gathered remotely for The Envelope's annual Drama Roundtable conversation laughed. One of those was Emma Corrin, who plays Princess Diana in the Netflix show's fourth season. \"I adore 'The Crown,'\" Grant said to her during the chat. \"I did think this last one was probably the most controversial. I have a question for you.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she said, with a touch of hesitation.\n\n\"I genuinely adored it,\" \"The Undoing\" actor reassured her. \"I hope you can tell from my tone. And you were sensational.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said graciously, waiting for that other shoe to drop.\n\n\"And I know (showrunner) Peter Morgan; I used to play golf with him — a very bad-tempered golfer,\" Grant continued. \"But I thought, when you go to Balmoral and then (the royal family is) horrible to you, that was the first time ever in the series I thought, 'I don't think they would have been that horrible, they wouldn't have been that rude.'\"\n\n\"You mean when I walk in and am standing in a circle (of family members)?\"\n\n\"Yeah, particularly that scene. And then they won't help you with 'Who do you bow to first.' And then Princess Margaret's horrible to you and all that. Is that all accurate? I felt they just would have been too English to be that nasty.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I'm not sure. I know that there are certain things that the research team know happened. And I think Peter elaborates on it for the purposes of the story,\" Corrin explained. \"I think that what he wants to get out of that scene was that Diana walked in expecting a family, and what she got was The Firm.\"\n\nGrant said, \"But I thought all the way through the series that (Morgan) basically liked them. And then suddenly I thought, 'Oh, Christ, he hates these people.'\"\n\n\"If I may say, I've had a lot of British people be absolutely nasty and horrible to me, Hugh, so I believe it,\" chimed in Ethan Hawke, who stars as abolitionist John Brown in Showtime's \"The Good Lord Bird.\"\n\n\"We do hate you,\" said Grant, to laughter.\n\nDid we mention this was a drama panel?\n\nThe group that also included Anthony Mackie (Disney+'s \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\"), Elisabeth Moss (Hulu's \"The Handmaid's Tale\") and Jurnee Smollett (HBO's \"Lovecraft Country\") undeniably found some moments to have fun in the conversation that covered finding the keys to their characters, stories that couldn't have been told a few years ago and how much Grant likes killing.\n\nThese excerpts of their conversation have been edited for length and clarity. And there are spoilers ahead.\n\nQ: Hugh, I heard an interview where you refused to call HBO's \"The Undoing\" \"television.\" TV used to be considered the impoverished cousin to film, but does it still have that feeling for you?\n\nHugh Grant: Only for me. Everyone else has moved on.\n\nQ: So what lured you into \"The Undoing?\"\n\nGrant: Well, it seemed like a very classy project. I don't get offered that many classy projects. It was Susanne Bier, very distinguished Danish director. It was David Kelley, who's the king of television in America, apparently, and Nicole (Kidman), with all her Oscars. So I felt I couldn't possibly say no, although I did try, because I hate working.\n\nQ: Ethan, do you think it was easier to get \"Good Lord Bird\" made now than it would have been, say, 10 or 15 years ago?\n\nEthan Hawke: I don't know. Yes. I mean, to speak to the question that you asked Hugh, I feel like the landscape of what we do is changing. The industry is always changing how we tell stories. I felt very much like \"The Good Lord Bird\" was just a six-, seven-hour movie.\n\nWhen I was a kid, television just entertained you for as long as they could. The stories didn't have a beginning, middle and an end. They didn't have a theme, they didn't have a thesis, they didn't have metaphor. They were generally a smaller budget. Now, we had one of the hugest budgets I've had on \"The Good Lord Bird.\" And so that was exciting to me to work on a much bigger canvas and to have more time with the character but to not feel like I was pouring water in my beer. There's a political atmosphere to our show. I think had Showtime foreseen how volatile this year would be, they might not have made the show. I never understand why people greenlight what they do and why they don't.\n\nQ: Elisabeth, I wonder if \"Handmaid's\" is one of those shows that a few years ago would have been hard to get made?\n\nElisabeth Moss: Oh, I think it was definitely helped by the era of streaming, because it can be a pretty tough show to watch. With the limitations of network television, obviously we wouldn't have been able to make it. But I echo what Ethan said where I don't quite understand, even as a producer, why things get greenlit and why some things don't. I do think that our show in 2016 obviously came along at a time that people were really looking at certain things that were paralleled on our show. But also, that book is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book and has been resonant over the years.\n\nQ: This streaming thirst for content seems to have knocked down some genre barriers. Horror and sci-fi, and even superhero fare, traditionally have been the province of white men as creators and characters, but your shows don't follow that mold.\n\nJurnee Smollett: I say all the time how I'm not the only one who feels like as a Black artist you can be a fan of horror but horror hasn't always been a fan of us. There was a time in which I just told my agents, \"Do not send me a horror film, because I know I'm just going to be the Black chick that dies on page 37.\" With \"Lovecraft Country,\" it was so exciting for me to be a part of a counter-narrative to such a dominant narrative.\n\nQ: Anthony, your Sam Wilson is a world-famous Avenger yet can't get a bank loan. He gets racially profiled. There's a subplot about Isaiah Bradley, the Black super-soldier, that has very strong resonances from the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n\nAnthony Mackie: (Marvel exec) Kevin Feige called me and told me that they were going to introduce Isaiah Bradley and the arc of the character and the story and what they were going to do with it. I was blown away that Marvel, to speak frankly, would have the (guts) to do that.\n\nThe relationship between Black men and America is one of abuse, betrayal, disheartened love and no appreciation. It's (Sam) having to come to grips with the abusive relationship that he has with the country that he lives in and then having to stand up and fight for that country. That was something that as a Black man with my four Black sons, with my Black dad and two Black brothers, we've always had that conversation.\n\nQ: Emma, when I saw the scene of you dancing alone as Princess Diana, I thought, \"This is like a window into who this person really is.\" Is there a moment that reveals who you think Diana is?\n\nCorrin: It was that episode \"Fairytale.\" You experience Diana's intense isolation. That dancing scene was such a joy to do. I remember Ben Caron, the director, saying, \"Oh, we've got a choreographer who will choreograph something for the dance scene tomorrow where you lose yourself.\" And I remember saying — I mean, I'm not a dancer at all, in fact, like, notoriously bad — but I remember that I just had this weird gut instinct, and I was like, \"Do you mind if we don't choreograph it? I'd really just like to feel it. And is it OK also if I pick the music?\"\n\nSo I came in the next day, and everyone was quite nervous about what I was about to do. And I danced to Cher, \"Do You Believe?\" They set up one camera, and I just danced for three minutes. And it was euphoric, and it was incredible. I just loved it. And I think for me that got to the crux of Diana, the child within her who just needed to be seen and to be held. I think that's really all she wanted the entire time. And it got her spirit of this energy she had that was infectious. And I think people felt that, this spirit that you couldn't dampen.\n\nQ: Hugh, about what you've called Innocent Jonathan/Guilty Jonathan: Do you feel there were moments in the show that revealed him?\n\nGrant: I think he would have a tough time answering your question, because 99.9% of the series is Innocent Jonathan — who, of course, is a lie. But it's a lie that he absolutely believed, in the way that real sociopaths, they do believe their own lies. For him, it's impossible that he could have committed this appalling act.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is, the real Jonathan, the Guilty Jonathan, is only exposed once in a scene that actually was never in the script. It was put in by me having a little tantrum. And Susanne Bier agreeing with me, because I felt it wasn't really clear in the scripted version of Episode 6 who really had done it. And I thought, \"Is this just them leaving the door open for a subsequent series?\" And I'd really signed up on the basis of being a killer. I wanted to kill. So I was cross. So then Susanne said, \"So we'll shoot the murder, and then there won't be any debate about it.\" So in that scene, the beast Jonathan has sex with that poor girl, that poor actress — Christ, quarter of my age, awful for her — and then I smash her against the wall, and then I kill her. Obviously, that's the only real Jonathan."
