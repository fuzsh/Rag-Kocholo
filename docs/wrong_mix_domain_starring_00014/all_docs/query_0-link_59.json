        "text": "Notting Hill may be our go-to romcom on a rainy - or, let's face it, sunny - Sunday afternoon, but star Gina McKee has admitted that she's only seen it once, and that was two decades ago.\n\nThe Line of Duty star played the endearing yet indomitable Bella, who was worshipped by her lovely husband Tim McInnerny's Max, and made light of being in a wheelchair, particularly during that famous chocolate brownie scene.\n\n\"I have only seen it once and that was at the premiere so I ought to watch it again really.\" the actress told Red magazine. \"But people often talk to me about it, and really love it and get a lot of pleasure from it, and that's a really nice thing. I'm pleased that it has longevity. Bella was memorable.\"\n\nOn what it was like working with co-star Hugh Grant, who played the dashing yet hapless Will, McKee recalled: \"Hugh has a wit which is whip-smart, quick and he really is entertaining. I liked him. He made me laugh a lot on set.\"\n\nLast year, McKee reunited with Jed Mercurio to star in one of BBC's biggest hit dramas Bodyguard with Richard Madden and Keeley Hawes. She played Anne Sampson, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism command. Creator Jed Mercurio tricked audiences into believing that she was crooked - although we're still not sure if she was as squeaky clean as she maintained.\n\nGina Mckee in Bodyguard\n\nLine of Duty's Mercurio has previously revealed he's had talks with the BBC about a possible second series, although McKee says she hasn't heard anything about it.\n\n\"I know nothing!\" she laughed. \"If there is going to be another season 2, you'd have to talk to Jed, I genuinely have no clue if it will come back, or if Anne Sampson will come back.\n\n\"But yes, I would return because I think Jed is fantastic. I really like him and working with him.\"\n\nHelen Mirren and Gina Mckee in Catherine the Great\n\nMcKee will appear on our TV screens next as the formidable Countess Bruce in HBO's Catherine the Great, with Dame Helen Mirren taking the lead as the great Russian ruler.\n\n\"Countess Bruce was very powerful, and there's not a lot we know about her in reality, and what we do is a bit sensationalist,\" McKee explained. \"Bu we know she was around the same age as Catherine, and she joined court at 15 or 16 and survived at court for a long time which is unique for anybody.\n\n\"How she managed to do that, we can only assume ,but that gives us a nice liberty int terms of drama and interpreting the story. She understood the currency of sex.\""
