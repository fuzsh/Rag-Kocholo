        "text": "Summer blockbusters, action-packed thrillers, sweet rom-coms, and much-anticipated sequels are all on the movie slate for 2024. The upcoming year for movies promises to be one for the books, especially with the long-awaited releases of films that were delayed as a result of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. From dramatic biopics like Bob Marley: One Love and the Amy Winehouse film Back to Black to epic sequels like Dune: Part Two and Beetlejuice 2, here are 38 films to look forward to in the new year.\n\nThe Book of Clarence (Jan. 12)\n\nJeymes Samuel’s (The Harder They Fall) dark comedy leans on Biblical inspiration for some decidedly irreverent humor. For Clarence (LaKeith Stanfield), staying on the path of righteousness is a challenge, but he’s inspired to emulate Jesus Christ, especially after he sees the fame and accolades the latter gets from doing his good deeds. Eyeing an opportunity to capitalize on the star power of Jesus, Clarence begins faking miracles, a lucrative hustle that goes well until the Roman empire comes calling.\n\nMean Girls: The Musical (Jan. 12)\n\nMean Girls will be back on the big screen with the film adaptation of the 2018 hit Broadway musical based on Tina Fey’s 2004 cult classic movie.

As Cassie reckons with dark secrets from her past and her newfound psychic abilities, she assumes responsibility for ensuring that a trio of young girls, who will be profoundly influential in the future, survive a deadly adversary.\n\nBob Marley: One Love (Feb. 14)\n\nThe life and legacy of Jamaican singer and songwriter Bob Marley is the subject of this new biopic starring Kingsley Ben-Adir as the iconic reggae artist.

Elodie must brave steep cliffs, harsh weather, and a fire-breathing dragon if she wants to escape this fate.\n\nThe American Society of Magical Negroes (March 22)\n\nWriter and director Kobi Libii turns the racist trope of the “Magical Negro” on its head with The American Society of Magical Negroes. In the satirical film, Justice Smith stars as Aren, a young Black man who is recruited to be a part of a secret society of magical Black people who derive their power from the act of making white people’s lives easier.\n\nMickey 17 (March 29)\n\nBong Joon-ho’s much-anticipated film adaptation of Edward Ashton’s science fiction thriller, Mickey 17 stars Robert Pattinson as the titular Mickey 17, an “expendable” space traveler sent on a deadly mission to colonize Niflheim.
