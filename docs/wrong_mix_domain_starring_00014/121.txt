Hugh Grant may now be starring in some pretty meaty roles, but for most of us, he'll always be known as the king of '90s rom-coms, including cult fan-favourite Notting Hill.

60 year-old Grant, who starred in the Richard Curtis film alongside Hollywood megastar Julia Roberts, recently revealed while promoting The Undoing — his latest TV venture with Nicole Kidman — that he'd be open to filming a sequel, but only under one condition, that's not likely to go down too well with fans of the 1999 film.

In a move that many are dubbing the 'Hugh-naissance,' the floppy-haired romantic lead of our dreams has seemingly been making a concerted effort in recent years to widen his acting horizons; from playing the comedically evil villain in Paddington 2 to portraying disgraced former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe in TV mini-series A Very English Scandal. And perhaps his recent, more experimental roles have seen his capacity for storybook romantic endings reduced, for he joked at a press conference this week, that he'd like to do a sequel to one of his romantic comedies, which showed what really happens after the 'happy ending,' to prove the 'terrible lie' they all were.

According to Digital Spy, he then specifically referenced Notting Hill, saying: 'I’d like to do me and Julia [Roberts] and the hideous divorce that’s ensued, with really expensive lawyers, children involved in tug of love, floods of tears, psychologically scarred forever. I’d love to do that film.'

Whilst this may sound pretty bleak for fans of rom-coms, we'd probably still devour any sequel that gives us more a glimpse into Hollywood starlet Anna and divorced bookshop owner Will's lives after we last saw them sitting on a park bench with Will reading a book and Anna patting her baby bump happily.
