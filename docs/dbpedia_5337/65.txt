WAGA-TV (FOX 5) is the Fox television station in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. WAGA's transmitter is co-located at its studios on Briarcliff Road Northeast in Atlanta. Its former studios and transmission facilities at 1018 West Peachtree Street NW later became home to WTBS.

History

It began in 1949 as a CBS station and remained this way for forty-five years. The station's newscasts were called "5 News Scene", which then changed to "Eyewitness News". Then, in late 1994, after being purchased by Rupert Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting Company, the station switched its affiliation from CBS to Fox, and CBS was moved to Channel 46 (WGCL). The following year, the station changed its newscast to "Fox 5 News".
