        "text": "FOX is an American broadcast television network under the ownership of Fox Corporation. It was founded on October 9, 1986, and is the fifth of the nation-wide terrestrial networks, alongside NBC, CBS and ABC, and succeeding the defunct DuMont network.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 In-Depth\n\n3 Primetime Shows (2023-2024 Season)\n\n3.1 Primetime\n\n3.2 Non-Primetime\n\n4 Current Primetime Schedule\n\n5 Current Non-Primetime Schedule\n\n5.1 Morning\n\n5.2 Afternoon and Evening\n\n5.3 Late Night\n\n6 FOX owned-and-operated stations\n\n7 Fox owned MyNetworkTV and independent stations\n\n8 Previous Logos\n\n9 External Sites\n\nHistory\n\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company (regularly shortened to just FOX) is a national television network in the United States owned by the Fox Entertainment Company and, by proxy, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The network spent twenty years building a reputation to rival the big three (ABC, NBC and CBS) national networks, beginning in March 1985 when Murdoch purchased half of 20th Century Fox studios only to buy the rest of the studio six months later. However, although the groundwork for the network began 1985, FOX wasn't officially launched until October 9, 1986 when the network began broadcast to 96 stations nationwide (comparatively, the big three had between 210 and 215 broadcast stations). Although the network was available in 80% of all homes, the only series broadcast in the beginning was The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers.\n\nFOX became the iconoclast in comparison to its competition, preferring to target young, hip audiences rather than the older demographic which the big three had appealed to because of familiarity. On April 5, 1987 the network premiered its first primetime shows: Married... with Children and The Tracey Ullman Show. By 1993, FOX expanded into a full week schedule of primetime shows. But, their mark wasn't made on the industry until the early 1990s when Murdoch's News Corporation (later 21st Century Fox) bought up more television station groups and outbid CBS for the rights to show National Football Conference games from the NFL. As the years went on, the network created more and more original programming targeted towards younger audiences, expanding into drama (The X-Files, Beverly Hills 90210, The O.C.), animation (The Simpsons, Futurama, Family Guy, King of the Hill), sketch comedy (In Living Color, The Ben Stiller Show, MADtv) and sitcoms (Malcolm in the Middle, That 70's Show, Arrested Development). Currently, the network can be seen in approximately 96.18% of all U.S. households.\n\nSince its foundation, FOX has run an owned-and-operated station division, Fox Television Stations, which was formed in 1986 from six independent stations formerly owned by Metromedia. FTS also oversees operations of the syndication service MyNetworkTV.\n\nIn-Depth\n\nProgram Listing: A complete listing of shows aired on FOX.\n\nPrimetime Shows (2023-2024 Season)\n\nPrimetime\n\nNew and returing series\n\nBob's Burgers (Season 14)\n\nFamily Guy (Season 22)\n\nKitchen Nightmares (Season 1)\n\nKrapopolis (Season 1)\n\nHell's Kitchen (Season 22)\n\nLEGO Masters (Season 4)\n\nThe Masked Singer (Season 10)\n\nCelebrity Name That Tune (Season 3)\n\nThe Simpsons (Season 35)\n\nSnake Oil (Season 1)\n\nSpecial Forces: World's Toughest Test (Season 2)\n\nMidseason series\n\n9-1-1: Lone Star (Season 5)\n\nAccused (Season 2)\n\nAlert: Missing Persons Unit (Season 2)\n\nAnimal Control (Season 2)\n\nThe Cleaning Lady (Season 3)\n\nDoc (Season 1)\n\nFarmer Wants a Wife (Season 2)\n\nThe Great North (Season 4)\n\nGrimsburg (Season 1)\n\nNext Level Chef (Season 3)\n\nRescue: HI-Surf (Season 1)\n\nWe Are Family (Season 1)\n\nSummer series (2024)\n\nTBA\n\nSports coverage\n\nCFB on Fox\n\nNFL on Fox\n\nThe OT\n\nWWE Friday Night Smackdown\n\nCanceled/ended in 2022-23\n\n9-1-1 (Season 6)\n\nCall Me Kat (Season 3)\n\nFantasy Island (Season 2)\n\nMonarch (Season 1)\n\nThe Resident (Season 6)\n\nNon-Primetime\n\nNon-primetime news\n\nFOX News Sunday\n\nCurrent Primetime Schedule\n\nDay 7:00 7:30 8:00 8:30 9:00 9:30 Monday America's Most Wanted TMZ Investigates Tuesday Name That Tune The Floor Wednesday I Can See Your Voice We Are Family Thursday Next Level Chef Farmer Wants a Wife Friday WWE SmackDown Saturday College basketball Sunday Next Level Chef The Simpsons Krapopolis The Great North Grimsburg\n\nCurrent Non-Primetime Schedule\n\nMorning\n\nDay 9:00 9:30 10:00 10:30 11:00 11:30 Saturday Weekend Marketplace Sunday FOX News Sunday\n\nAfternoon and Evening\n\nFOX airs various sports on Saturday and Sunday afternoon throughout the year including MLB on FOX, NFL on FOX, and NASCAR on FOX.
