        "text": "The Milwaukee man accused of killing and dismembering 19-year-old Sade Robinson planned to do so weeks before her death, according to a statement from a \"confidential informant\" noted in court filings FOX6 News obtained.\n\nMaxwell Anderson, 33, is scheduled to go to trial later this year. He pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse and arson of property other than a building in April.\n\nInformant's statement\n\nCourt filings indicate police met with the information on April 15 – thirteen days after Robinson's leg was found at Warnimont Park in Cudahy, and three days after Anderson was charged in the case.\n\nSIGN UP TODAY: Get daily headlines, breaking news emails from FOX6 News\n\nThe informant told police they were at Anderson's home on March 5, according to court filings. Anderson showed the informant his basement, the informant said, including a plastic tarp that covered a sanitation sink, ceiling, floor and walls.\n\nAccording to the informant's statement in the court filings, Anderson told the informant he \"intended to kill Sade Robinson\" – using a gun to get her down into the basement. The informant said Anderson then said he \"planned on shooting Robinson and then dismember her body in the room\" before \"disposing Robinson's body throughout the city.\"\n\nThe information told police they saw three saws in the basement and believed those were the saws Anderson intended to use, per the court filings.\n\nThe court records obtained Wednesday also indicate another woman went on a date with Anderson in February. That woman said Anderson asked her back to his home and believed he drugged her drink.\n\nFOX6 made multiple attempts to reach Anderson's attorney for comment Wednesday, but did not hear back by the deadline for this story.\n\nFamily responds\n\nSade Robinson's family members said the documents make them see the case in a new way.\n\n\"After the fact doesn't do me any justice, because it doesn't bring my daughter back,\" said Carlos Robinson, Sade's father. \"Why would this guy feel comfortable to tell you his plans in the first place?\n\nFREE DOWNLOAD: Get breaking news alerts in the FOX6 News app for iOS or Android.\n\n\"This fuels my rage knowing that somebody else could have stopped this, and they didn't.\"\n\nTo date, not all of Sade Robinson's body has been found. Her remains have been found as far as Waukegan, Illinois.\n\nAdditional remains \"believed to be\" Robinson's were found along the Lake Michigan shore in South Milwaukee on April 18. Searches in and around Milwaukee County have yielded no discoveries since then, and the discovery in Waukegan followed. The first body part found was a human leg, later determined to be Robinson's, near the lake in Cudahy. Additional remains turned up in three separate Milwaukee locations as well.\n\n\"You have to be a very demonic individual to do something like this,\" Robinson said.\n\nAttorney Vernoa Swanigan, who represents Sade's mother, Sheena Scarbrough, said Scarbrough found out about the newly obtained court filings through news coverage."
