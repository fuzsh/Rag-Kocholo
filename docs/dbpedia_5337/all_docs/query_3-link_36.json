        "text": "Forrest Sawyer, who ricochets across the globe as a correspondent for ABC's \"Nightline,\" with time out to serve as substitute inquisitor for Ted Koppel and anchor of the network's \"World News Sunday,\" describes himself as a \"utility infielder.\"\n\nAnd until slightly over a year ago, he was just that: one of ABC's intrepid, interchangeable players who beamed back the news from the hot spot of the week. But the Persian Gulf War took Mr. Sawyer, who is 43 years old, from pinch-hitter to power slugger. Never mind that NBC's Arthur Kent, a k a the Satellite Dish, reaped publicity and amorous fan letters for his leather-jacketed updates from the roof of his Dhahran hotel. It was Mr. Sawyer, puffy-eyed with fatigue and in rumpled khakis, who broke away from the press pool to link up with the Saudi and Egyptian forces, filing the first footage of deserters and the first live report from the front.\n\n\"He hit one home run after another,\" says Richard Kaplan, the executive producer of the ABC newsmagazine program \"Prime Time Live,\" who worked with Mr. Sawyer in the gulf. \"He earned his stripes and deserves all the privileges that go with them.\"\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Sawyer continued his streak by reporting on the plight of Kurdish refugees, prying open the K.G.B. files on Lee Harvey Oswald and sparring with Bernard Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, on \"Nightline.\""
