Look for\n\nthem on during the news on TV!\n\nBadgerette ,\n\nWeather app yes\n\nI liked Fox during very severe weather over quite a few years. But recently I sought a Fox Weather app for Atlanta, only found the Fox News app and thought this was the only access. For reasons not pertinent to weather, this was a deal breaker. A friend showed me the separate app, so here I am. I like it. Focuses on local, easy to navigate, so far continues to be accurate and although drama and hooks are not absent, youâve kept it pretty darn clean.\n\nNOAA is my gold standard but since they âimprovedâ their app, itâs not as helpful as it used to be. Please continue to stick to the weather and donât let anything else smear into your part of the network."
