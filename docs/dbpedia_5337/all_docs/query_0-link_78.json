        "text": "1968 Atlanta Radio Time Warp\n\nThe year 1968 was an important one in Atlanta radio because it marked the beginning of the end of AM domination in the market. NBC radio affiliate and 50 kW clear channel WSB-AM \"Wis-Bee\" was the market leader. The former Atlanta Journal station had a middle of the road format and tried hard to be everything to everybody. Judging from the number of listeners, it succeeded royally. WSB carried University of Georgia football, the Braves, the Hawks, NBC news on the hour, NBC Monitor on the weekends, and a cornucopia of music, news, and information programs. It was much more involved in the community than any other station in the market. When news broke out, Atlantans turned to WSB.\n\nWGST \"your guest, WGST 92, very Atlanta\" tried mightily to compete with WSB, but it really never succeeded. At that time, WGST was owned by Georgia Tech and the studios were on the campus. Petula Clark's \"Downtown\" was typical of the musical sound of the station which was the flagship for Georgia Tech sports. But most college graduates who lived in Atlanta went to the University of Georgia and listened to their team on WSB. The only Top 40 station was WQXI where the mighty \"Quixie in Dixie\" Tigers spun the latest 45s. It was the only Atlanta station with reverb in the background. A new talk station WRNG \"Ring Radio\" had just gone on the air at the beginning of 1968. It was an instant success as Atlanta's first talk station. Its format would be duplicated by other stations in the ensuing years.\n\nThe FM band was occupied mostly by automated, easy listening stations that had few commercial sponsors. One format exception was WKXI which featured an instrumental upbeat \"now sound\" with continuous coverage of the stock market and financial news from Reynolds Co. It was the only FM signal with aggressive audio processing. WKXI would literally jump from the loudspeaker when tuning to it from another station. Another exception was classical WGKA-AM-FM. With new studios and FM transmitter atop Peachtree Center in downtown, the stations were the class act of Atlanta broadcasting. WGKA was sold in 1968 and Atlanta lost its commercial classical stations. There was a groundswell of opposition, primarily to the change in format on the AM station, which resulted in a then record number of complaints to the FCC in opposition to the sale.\n\nAtlanta was on the verge of being a boomtown in 1968. Residents and visitors flocked to the new Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown to ride the bubble shaped elevators up into the canopy of the atrium lobby. The rotating floor of the Polaris Lounge on top of the Regency gave a panoramic view of the city through the transparent blue dome over the lounge. The Braves on WSB-AM and the Falcons on WQXI-AM were new teams in town and the Hawks were on their way with WSB-AM to be their home. Atlanta had just discovered live theater and theater reviews were becoming common on the radio. The now defunct Theater Atlanta was a ground breaking class act which went to Broadway and performed a play that spoofed then Governor Lester Maddox who, in the early '60s, gave out pick ax handles at his Pickrick fried chicken restaurant as a symbol of resistance to integration.\n\nThe Vietnam war was raging and tearing the country apart in 1968. Atlanta was a magnet in the south for hippies and youthful war protesters. The sidewalks in the \"Tight Squeeze\" area around 10th and Peachtree Streets were packed with so many hippies that pedestrians literally had to walk in the streets. People driving through the area stopped to stare, creating massive traffic jams that snaked for blocks around the area. The alternative newspaper The Great Speckled Bird was hawked by vendors wearing tie-dyed T-shirts from street corners for 15 cents a copy. As a sign of the changes that were to come, Plough's WPLO-FM would soon convert to an automated underground rock format.\n\nMilitary service was mandatory in 1968. The young men who were drafted that year who were fortunate to make it back to Atlanta would find a big change in the radio scene. When they left, people were listening to AM. When they returned, people were listening to FM. As an example of how little broadcast professionals would anticipate the changes to come, see the November quote above from Elmo Ellis, former general manager of WSB-AM-FM, when he was asked his opinion on the future of FM broadcasting. In 1968, Ellis was certainly \"Mr. Broadcasting\" in Atlanta. He probably had more power in the industry than all others in the market combined.\n\nIn January of 1968, there were 19 AM stations and 9 FM stations listed in the Atlanta newspapers. These are listed below.\n\nThe AM Dial 590 WPLO Country 680 WRNG Talk 750 WSB Popular 790 WQXI Top 40 860 WERD Rhythm/Blues, Jazz 920 WGST Popular 970 WIIN Popular 1010 WGUN Country/Gospel 1080 WBIE Standards 1190 WGKA Classical 1230 WFOM Top 40 1260 WTJH Country 1310 WOMN Popular 1340 WIGO Rhythm/Blues 1380 WAOK Rhythm/Blues 1420 WAVO Religious 1480 WYZE Town/Country 1550 WYNX Town/Country 1570 WBAD Popular\n\nThe FM Dial 90.1 WABE Educational (S) 92.9 WGKA Classical 94.1 WKXI Popular/Finance 94.9 WAVO Religious 96.1 WKLS Standards (S) 98.5 WSB-FM Popular (S) 99.7 WLTA Standards (S) 101.5 WBIE Standards 103.3 WPLO-FM Top 40\n\nSample Program Notes from 1968\n\nJanuary\n\nWQXI-AM - The new show \"Center Stage\" is hosted on Fridays by station drama critic Maureen Roberts.
