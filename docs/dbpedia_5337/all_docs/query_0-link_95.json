        "text": "​\n\nWhat do you consider an important event in media history? Maybe The Beatles performing on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, the release of Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, Cinderella coming out in 1950 or maybe something more obscure? No matter what it is, if you truly think it is an important event in media history, if it fits the guidelines, it will be added. Well, as long as it's not completely stupid. No Rebecca Black recommendations, please. Sorry!\n\nThis timeline will be a collection of what we, as members of the community, deem important. So, choose an event. Say, for example, the release of Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. You have your event, now add why it's important. Something like \"The release of Breakfast at Tiffany's would define the career of Audrey Hepburn and forever immortalize her in film history.\" would be just fine. Maybe a little more descriptive than that, but, something like that would get through with no problems.\n\nSo just follow the nice little guidelines set below and you'll be on your way to making your mark on the timeline! Please, if you have any problems/questions/recommendations relating to this thread, just drop me a message and I'll be glad to hear you out.\n\nJust to clarify, the media you can recommend falls under these categories:\n\nAlbums/Songs\n\n[*]Films\n\n[*]Books/Literature\n\n[*]Art (as in paintings, photos)\n\n[*]Television\n\n[*]Events in pop culture\n\n[*]Anything, really. As long as it's related to media, it should be fine. It's not likely a recommendation won't be accepted, but I'll just have to make sure it's ok.\n\nHow to recommend\n\nWhen you are recommending something for the timeline, please follow the recommendation forms set out below. Also, list them in order of year from earliest to most recent, please. It makes it much easier to add your suggestions to the timeline if they're in order. Plus, state at the beginning of the recommendation if your suggestion is a piece of music, a film, etc\n\nRecommendation forms:\n\nSpoiler:\n\nCode:\n\n[I][SIZE=\"4\"]Music[/SIZE][/I] [B]Music:[/b] (Year song/album released) - [b]Song/Album[/b] - Why it's important [I][SIZE=\"4\"]Films[/SIZE][/I] [B]Film:[/b] (Year movie released) -[b]Film[/b] - Why it's important [I][SIZE=\"4\"]Books[/SIZE][/I] [B]Literature:[/B] (Year book/literature published) - [B]Literature[/B] - Why it's important [I][SIZE=\"4\"]Photography[/SIZE][/I] [B]Art:[/b] (Year photo taken/painting finished) - [b]Photo/Art[/b] - Why it's important [I][SIZE=\"4\"]Television[/SIZE][/I] [B]Television:[/b] (Date episode aired) - [b]Television show[/b] - Why it's important [I][SIZE=\"4\"]Events in pop culture[/SIZE][/I] [B]Pop Culture:[/b] (Date/Length of P.C event) - [b]Event in Pop Culture[/b] - Why it's important\n\nAlthough there is no limit as to how many suggestions you can make period, please limit your suggestions to only five per post. But, unless you can find any problems with the way I've set things up, you are now ready to add to the timeline!\n\nThe Timeline\n\n​\n\nNote that the starting date is Pre-1900, but if you have a suggestion the predates that time, a new period of time will be created for that suggestion. This would be most likely to happen with pieces of artwork and whatnot.\n\nPre-1900:\n\n1900 - 1910\n\n1911 - 1920\n\n1921 - 1930\n\nSteamboat Willie (1928) - Film - This entry is important in that this was the first animated cartoon to be released by Walt Disney, his first to have synchronized sound (although other cartoons were produced with sound earlier), and marks Mickey Mouse's official debut. It was released on November 18, 1928 by Celebrity Pictures, and its soundtrack was recorded on the Powers Cinephone system (a clone of Lee DeForest's Phonofilm system, both Cinephone and Celebrity Pictures were owned by businessman Pat Powers). Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\n1931 - 1940\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) - Film - This is important in that it marked the first feature length cel-animated film, the first feature-length animated film in color (3 strip Technicolor), and the first in Walt Disney's animated features canon. Premiered at the Cartway Circle Theatere December 21, 1937, and given a nationwide release February 4, 1938 by RKO Radio Pictures. This film was added as \"significant\" to the United States National Film Registry in 1989. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\nPuss Gets the Boot (1940) - Film - This is important in that this animated short was the first to feature what is now the famous cat-and-mouse duo known as Tom and Jerry (although they were named Jasper and Jinx in this short), created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (of Hanna-Barbera fame) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and released February 20, 1940. This marked the beginning of the Hanna-Barbera partnership, which would last for over 60 years. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\n1941 - 1950\n\nUnited States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. (Hollywood Antitrust Case) (1948) - Film industry event - The US Federal Trade Commission had been investigating Hollywood's major movie studios for antitrust (competition law) violations, particularly the studios' ownership of theater chains (vertical integration of production, distribution, and exhibition). The federal government's case against the studios was initially filed in 1938, settled with a consent decree in 1940, which was not satisfied, reinstating the suit in 1943, made it to the U.S. Supreme Court, who decided the case May 3, 1948. The ruling required the studios to divest of their theater chains and abandon block-booking of films, it affected not just Paramount, but also Warner Bros., RKO Radio Pictures, Universal, 20th Century Fox, Loew's Incorporated (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), Columbia Pictures, American Theaters Association, and W.C. Allred (all named as additional defendants in this case). This is important as this case changed the direction of Hollywood (namely forcing the studios to sell their theaters), ending the vertical integration of the \"Studio System\", and also resulted in some of the studios selling (portions of) their film libraries to others. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\n1951 - 1960\n\nAn Evening with Fred Astaire (October 17, 1958) - Television - Sponsored by Chrysler Corporation and originally broadcast on NBC on October 17, 1958; this is important for a variety of reasons, including that it was Fred Astaire's first starring role on television, one of the first television programs to be recorded on color videotape, used innovative production techniques that are now commonplace (such as chroma key and dissolves), and subsequent reruns of this show (January 26, 1959, and then on CBS on December 20, 1964) used color videotape, in an era when color broadcasts were transferred to black-and-white kinescopes. It also won numerous Emmys. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\n1961 - 1970\n\nDeath of Marilyn Monroe (August 5, 1962) - Event in Pop Culture - Marilyn Monroe, died at the age of 36. Despite, being judged her whole life, she was one of the most iconic woman of her time, and still today. An amazing actress, starring in over 30 films (considering her age, an achievement for sure), singer, model and showgirl who became a major sex symbol. Certainly known for her intelligence and quotes. In the years and decades following her death, Monroe has often been cited as both a pop and a cultural icon. Contribution by Mew~\n\nJeopardy! premieres (March 30, 1964) - Television show - Merv Griffin created this game show, with the idea coming from his then-wife Julann, where the contestants are given the answer, but they have to come up with the correct question. Until this point, there had not been a successful Q&A game show on the air since the 1950s quiz show rigging scandals. The original version of this show (mentioned here) was hosted by Art Fleming, and ran on NBC until January 3, 1975. A revival ran from 1978 to 1979 (again hosted by Fleming), and another revival (hosted by Alex Trebek) entered nightly syndication on September 10, 1984, which continues to this day. This entry is important as the concept has been adapted by many countries worldwide, and the American syndicated version is one of the top-rated syndicated shows on American television. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\nWalt Disney's Death (December 15, 1966) - Event in Pop Culture - He was the world's uncle and the world mourned. He was an entertainer, visionary, and innovator who brought joy and magic to many and changed the world. He died of lung cancer at the age of 65 in the midst of conceptualizing a \"community of the future\". His influence and legacy on the entertainment industry is long-lasting. From TV to movies to music... live action or animation or a combination of both... he had his fingers in everything.\n\nRelevant image\n\nContribution by TRIFORCE89\n\n1971 - 1980\n\nWheel of Fortune premieres (January 6, 1975) - Television Show - Merv Griffin created this game show for NBC, with initial development beginning in 1973 (as Shopper's Bazaar), which NBC picked up for their daytime schedule to compensate Merv for canceling his other game show, Jeopardy!. Initially hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford, this series ran in daytime until September 20, 1991. A nighttime syndicated version premiered September 19, 1983, hosted by Pat Sajak (joined the original version December 28, 1981, replacing Woolery, and continuing on daytime until January 1989, when he was replaced by Rolf Benirschke, who was then replaced by Bob Goen a few months later) and Vanna White (joined the original version December 13, 1982, replacing Susan Stafford), which continues to this day. This is important as the concept has been adapted by many countries worldwide, and the show has been ranked as one of the top syndicated shows on American television for most of its life. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\nStar Wars (1977) - Film - This is important in that it marked the beginning of George Lucas' Star Wars saga. Released by 20th Century Fox May 25, 1977, and added \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" to its title in 1981. A total of six films comprise the Star Wars canon. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\n1981 - 1990\n\nJim Henson's Death (May 16, 1990) - Event in Pop Culture - Creator of The Muppets and helped to develop Sesame Street. Beyond the comical puppets he's most known for, he also founded the Creature Shop which continues to assist in the design and creation of creatures in other films. He died of organ failure due to Streptococcus pyogenes. Much like Walt, his death resulted in a public outpouring of emotion and affection.\n\nRelevant image\n\nContribution by TRIFORCE89\n\nThe Death of Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street (December 7, 1982) - Television Event\n\nA famous episode and deemed one of the most influential moments of daytime television history. A beloved character died, and being a show for very young children it was touchy subject matter to handle. But, they did it wonderfully. They taught children about death (literally, they didn't use euphemisms) and grief and how it's a natural part of life and how to deal with it. Unprecedented.\n\nContribution by TRIFORCE89\n\n1991 - 2000\n\nFox affiliate switches of 1994 (May 23, 1994-June 3, 1996) - Television - On May 23, 1994, Fox agreed to purchase a stake in television station group New World Communications. As part of this deal, most of New World's stations (many affiliated with CBS), would switch their affiliations to Fox. These included stations in Atlanta (WAGA-TV 5), Cleveland (WJW-TV 8), Detroit (WJBK-TV 2), and Milwaukee (WITI-TV 6) (all long-time CBS affiliates), among others. The switchover of the New World stations to Fox took place towards the end of 1994. Other station groups, such as Meredith Corporation, Scripps Howard, and Westinghouse Broadcasting/Group W, signed affiliation deals with other networks (CBS for Meredith and Group W, ABC for Scripps). This is important in that it resulted in repercussions for each of the long-established Big Three networks (especially CBS, who had trouble finding replacement affiliates in Atlanta, Detroit, and Milwaukee.), as well as confusion and frustration among viewers across the United States, who had to get used to the new channel positions of the networks they watched. The repercussions even extended into Canada, where regulatory changes took place regarding cable carriage of American stations, particularly those in markets bordering Canada (including Detroit). Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\nO.J. Simpson murder case (June 12, 1994-October 3, 1995) - Pop Culture event - Former American football star and actor O.J. Simpson was tried for murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in June 1994, with the trial held from January 29 to October 3, 1995. O.J. was found not guilty on October 3, 1995, albeit to much controversy. This is important in that this case received extensive media coverage, although it was eclipsed for a period of time by the Oklahoma City Bombing in April 1995. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\n1994 World Series canceled (September 14, 1994) - Sports - Due to an ongoing strike by the Major League Baseball Players Association (ran from August 12 of that year to April 2, 1995), the entire Major League Baseball postseason was canceled. This is important as this was not only the first year in 90 years that the World Series was not played (last time was in 1904), but several teams were poised to break long-standing postseason droughts that year. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\nToy Story (1995) - Film - This film is important because it was the first feature-length film that was entirely made in CGI and Pixar's first feature-length film. Contribution by cacturne4512\n\nTheatrical Edition Pocket Monsters: Mewtwo's Counterattack (1998) - Film - This is important in that it was the first feature film in the Pokémon franchise. Originally released in Japan on July 18, 1998, it received a US dub release (4Kids Productions) under the title 'Pokémon, The First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back', released November 10, 1999 by Warner Bros., where it briefly held the record for highest-grossing animated film, only to be succeeded two weeks later by Disney/Pixar's Toy Story 2, during the height of the Pokémon craze. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\n2001- 2010\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) - Film - It's important because it was the beginning of the film franchise phenomenon that will forever remain unmatched. It catapulted the book series from incredibly popular to worldwide fever. Contribution by Shining Raichu\n\nMartha Stewart insider trading scandal (December 27, 2001-July 16, 2004) - Pop Culture event - Celebrity business and media magnate Martha Stewart sold all of her shares (3,928) in ImClone Systems on December 27, 2001, a day before the US Food and Drug Administration announced it would not approve of the company's monoclonal antibody, Erbitux. Martha Stewart was tried and found guilty of securities fraud, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice, and was sentenced on July 16, 2004 to five months in prison, five months of home confinement, and two years probation. ImClone CEO Sam Waksal and Martha Stewart's broker Peter Bacanovic were also sent to prison for their roles in this scandal. This event is important as Stewart was a very popular and well-known homemaking magnate before the scandal broke out. This scandal ran concurrently with other high-profile corporate scandals of the era (e.g. Enron and WorldCom). Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\nThe death of John Ritter (September 11, 2003) - Event in Pop Culture - This is actually important for a few reasons. John Ritter was a very well respected comedic actor in America, and his death at such a young age (just 54) of a heart attack was utterly shocking. It is also important because he helmed an incredibly popular sitcom at the time of his death, and writing the death of his character into the show led to one of the saddest hours of television I have ever seen. Finally, it is important because of the ripple effect it had on the landscape of the sitcom world. His death led to the decline in popularity and eventual cancellation of his show, 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter, which made it so that Kaley Cuoco was available in 2007 when they cast The Big Bang Theory, which is now arguably the most-watched sitcom on Earth (and may not have been had her role been given to somebody else - a TV show formula is so tenuous that even the slightest change can dramatically affect how the show is received).\n\nContribution by Shining Raichu\n\nFebruary 14th, 2005 - The domain YouTube.com came into existence - YouTube has altered the face of music permanently, as it has now become a venue where not only established artists can interact personally with fans through videos, but brand new artists can put their work out there and possibly be discovered. It has opened a window into the media world that allows creators at any level share their creations with the world. Contributed by Toujours\n\nUPN and WB Networks close, CW and MyNetworkTV start (January 24-September 18, 2006) - Television - On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced they were shutting down their UPN and WB networks (respectively), and starting a new joint venture network, The CW. Both UPN and WB had been in operation since January 1995. In response to some stations being unable to join The CW, News Corporation (parent company of Fox), started a new network, MyNetworkTV. MyNetworkTV began operations September 5, 2006, while The CW launched September 18 of that year. This is important as this event represented the first major shakeup in American television since the 1994 Fox/New World Communications alliance, and WB and UPN were the first major commercial television networks to close since 1955 when DuMont folded. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\nThe release of the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (July 21, 2007) - Event in Pop Culture - This marked the end of the literary saga that will remain unparallelled for generations to come. There were news reports devoted entirely to what the last word of the book would be. That's how big this was. Contribution by Shining Raichu\n\nThe death of Heath Ledger (January 22, 2008) - Event in Pop Culture - While it is always tragic for a young actor to die in his prime, to die right after giving the performance of his career just makes it that much more of a shame. It's important because the world media exploded, and with good reason. Contribution by Shining Raichu\n\nDeath of Michael Jackson (June 25, 2009) - Pop Culture Event - The \"King of Pop\" died of an overdose of drugs administered by personal physician Dr. Conrad Murray. This is important in that this event triggered grief around the world, and later controversy on the part of Dr. Murray, who was tried and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter on November 7, 2011. This event has also been noted has having similarities to Elvis Presley's death in 1977. Contribution by Otter Mii-Kun\n\n2011 - 2012\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II (2011) - Film - This is important because it marked the end of the decade-long film franchise, and the end of childhoods the world over.
