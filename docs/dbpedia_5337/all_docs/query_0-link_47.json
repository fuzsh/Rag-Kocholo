        "text": "The Super Bowl is the premier American television broadcast each year. Watched by roughly 100 million households (and even more total viewers, according to the league's estimations), the entire event is a spectacle made for television.\n\nLIVE: Follow Eagles vs. Chiefs updates from Super Bowl 57\n\nDespite being such a staple in American culture, the Super Bowl never finds itself on the same channel in back-to-back years. The broadcast rights are rotated between NBC, CBS, and Fox, with ABC soon joining the group.\n\nSuper Bowl 57 is set to be a terrific game with the Lombardi Trophy and football immortality on the line. Beyond the game itself, the halftime show and brand new commercials are a draw for anyone.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about who is broadcasting Super Bowl 57.\n\nWho is broadcasting the Super Bowl in 2023?\n\nFox is broadcasting Super Bowl 57 on Feb. 12, 2023, taking its turn in a rotation of three networks that will soon become four. NBC, CBS, and Fox alternate Super Bowl broadcasts, and ABC will join the rotation with Super Bowl 61 in February 2021.\n\nDespite being such a hot commodity, Super Bowl broadcasting rights are actually set all the way through the 2033 season. CBS will broadcast Super Bowl 58 next year, followed by Fox again for Super Bowl 59.\n\nMORE: Live stream Super Bowl 57 on fuboTV (free trial)\n\nBelow is the list of Super Bowls that have been broadcast with the rotation set by the current TV agreement.\n\nSuper Bowl Broadcast network NFL season Super Bowl 57 Fox 2022 Super Bowl 56 (Rams vs. Bengals) NBC 2021 Super Bowl 55 (Buccaneers vs. Chiefs) CBS 2020 Super Bowl 54 (49ers vs. Chiefs) Fox 2019 Super Bowl 53 (Rams vs. Patriots) CBS 2018 Super Bowl 52 (Eagles vs. Patriots) NBC 2017 Super Bowl 51 (Falcons vs. Patriots) Fox 2016 Super Bowl 50 (Panthers vs. Broncos) CBS 2015 Super Bowl 49 (Seahawks vs. Patriots) NBC 2014 Super Bowl 48 (Seahawks vs. Broncos) Fox 2013 Super Bowl 47 (49ers vs. Ravens) CBS 2012 Super Bowl 46 (Giants vs. Patriots) NBC 2011 Super Bowl 45 (Packers vs. Steelers) Fox 2010 Super Bowl 44 (Saints vs. Colts) CBS 2009 Super Bowl 43 (Cardinals vs. Steelers) NBC 2008 Super Bowl 42 (Giants vs. Patriots) Fox 2007 Super Bowl 41 (Bears vs. Colts) CBS 2006\n\nHow much does it cost to broadcast the Super Bowl?\n\nThe NFL does not sell the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl individually, so the cost is covered under what each of the networks pay for general NFL broadcasting rights.\n\nCBS, Fox and NBC all pay an excess of $2 billion to broadcast the NFL under the league's new broadcast deal. Fox ($2.2 billion) is the biggest spender, NBC ($2 billion) spends the least and CBS ($2.1 billion) ranks right in the middle. These numbers are more than double what each side paid under the previous deal. The current deal was agreed upon in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon Prime pays $1 billion just for the \"Thursday Night Football\" window alone.\n\nMORE: When is Super Bowl 2023? Date, location, odds, halftime show for Super Bowl 57\n\nAll of these agreements mean the NFL is making billions of dollars from its television partners, but the hefty price these networks pay - aside from Amazon Prime - comes with the benefit of being part of the coveted Super Bowl rotation.\n\nSuper Bowl announcers: Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen\n\nJust when you think you have everything figured out about the Super Bowl broadcast, there is a major twist this year.\n\nFor the first time in more than two decades, Fox will broadcast the Super Bowl without Joe Buck and Troy Aikman in the booth. Since Buck and Aikman left the network to join ESPN last spring, Kevin Burkhardt (play-by-play) and Greg Olsen (color analyst) have taken over as Fox's top NFL broadcast team and will both be calling their first Super Bowl.\n\nMORE: Why Joe Buck and Troy Aikman left Fox to join ESPN's 'Monday Night Football' booth\n\nIn fact, Olsen was still a player last time Fox broadcasted a Super Bowl. A longtime NFL tight end who wen to Super Bowl 50 with the Panthers, Olsen has quickly ascended to this role as Fox's top color analyst but, despite solid reviews, could be demoted when Tom Brady retires and joins the network.\n\nBurkhardt has been an NFL play-by-play broadcaster for Fox since 2013 and has risen through the ranks to become the new No. 1 with Buck out of the picture. He has also served as Fox's Major League Baseball studio host.\n\nBurkhardt will be only the sixth different play-by-play man for the Super Bowl since the start of the century, joining Buck, Al Michaels, Jim Nantz, Greg Gumbel, and Pat Summerall. Mike Tirico is expected to join the ranks when NBC hosts Super Bowl 60.\n\nSuper Bowl sideline reporters: Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi\n\nErin Andrews is the familiar face of this Super Bowl, as she has been on the sideline for three different Super Bowls already and is a veteran sideline reporter for Fox.\n\nTom Rinaldi, on the other hand, is a new addition. He left ESPN for Fox in late 2020, so while he is a veteran sideline reporter himself, this will be his first Super Bowl for the network. Chris Myers previously served as Fox's other Super Bowl sideline reporter opposite Andrews.\n\nOne of Andrews and Rinaldi will be assigned to the AFC team, while the other will be assigned to the NFC side.\n\nWhat channel is the Super Bowl on?\n\nSuper Bowl 57 will be broadcast nationally on Fox.\n\nBelow are the top 25 TV markets in the United States and the local Fox affiliate for each."
