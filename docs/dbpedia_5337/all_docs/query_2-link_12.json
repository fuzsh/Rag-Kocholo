        "text": "Atlanta’s WAGA-AM signed on in 1937. The station’s owner, Storer Broadcasting, started a sister FM station (today’s WVEE-FM) in the 1940s.\n\nWAGA-TV signed on in 1949, seven months after WSB-TV launched. WAGA-TV was a CBS affiliate primarily, but also carried DuMont Television Network programs and shared a secondary ABC affiliation with WSB-TV until WLWA-TV (today’s WXIA-TV) signed on in 1951.\n\nIn the 1960s, the station moved to an Antebellum-style mansion, typical for Storer’s broadcast facilities.\n\nNew World Communications acquired WAGA-TV in 1993. After decades as a CBS affiliate, WAGA switched to Fox in 1994 as part of series of affiliation swaps in major U.S. cities.\n\nOver its history, WAGA-TV’s news operation generally has been a solid second-place in ratings, behind dominant WSB-TV.\n\nYou can find lots of vintage WAGA-TV clips on YouTube. In 1991, the station put together a funny (one-minute) look at it’s history:\n\nHere’s a look at a 1975 “5 News Scene” air check:\n\nThis is a 1979 air check of a “TV5 News Scene” broadcast:\n\nHere’s a complete 1981 “5 News Scene”:\n\nBy 1984, WAGA adopted the “Eyewitness News” brand. Here’s a collection of promos from that year:"
