The station bought Norelcos in 1966 or so.\n\nLike WSB, there are virtually no photo archives left, but here’s all that I know of. The station is now a FOX affiliate and was part of the mass change that came to Atlanta 20 or so years ago when all the stations switched networks. WXIA was ABC; now it’s NBC. WSB was NBC; now it’s ABC. WAGA was CBS; now it’s FOX. A station that was an independent became the CBS affiliate.\n\nHere are more photos of TK30s at work at WAGA-TV. Photos are from the Special Collections Department, Pullen Library, Georgia State University.\n\nBob Hope being interviewed at WAGA’s Atlanta studio\n\nU.S. Senator (and former Governor of Georgia) Herman Talmadge being interviewed."
