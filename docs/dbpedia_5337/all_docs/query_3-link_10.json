        "text": "WAGA investigative reporter Randy Travis and veteran medical reporter Beth Galvin have taken buyout offers to leave the Atlanta Fox-owned station.\n\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution media writer Rodney Ho said WAGA reduced staffing yesterday “amid broad financial challenges to the TV news business as more viewers gravitate to streaming services.”\n\nTravis joined WAGA when it was a CBS affiliate in 1990. Galvin joined the station in 1996.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHo said Galvin was the last local on-air TV reporter whose beat was exclusively health.\n\n“What a privilege it has been to get to tell your medical stories for the last 24 years,” Galvin wrote on Facebook. “What I saw and soaked in every day was the incredible courage and grace of people facing challenges they did not choose. I am so proud of the stories we covered, and I hope you found them helpful and inspired as I was by the people who shared their stories. What a beautiful amazing ride it has been.”\n\nWAGA svp and gm Bill Schneider sent a note to staff regarding Randy’s retirement, saying in part, “This announcement is bittersweet for me and will be for many of you. I wanted to let you know that Randy Travis has retired from FOX 5,” wrote Schneider. “Sweet, because I know that Randy will treat his retirement like he has treated his work here at WAGA. No half measures. He will run more marathons, read more articles and books, write more, and continue to live life with full gusto. Bitter, because we will miss him, his passion, and all of the amazing work he has done for our community and the station for the nearly 35 years he has been at FOX 5.”"
