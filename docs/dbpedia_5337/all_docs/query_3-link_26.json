A few weeks ago I hosted the Red Cross Life Board Luncheon which recognizes companies that go above and beyond to collect blood donations‚Ä¶and this year they put a spotlight on Sickle Cell Warriors. If you don‚Äôt know, blood transfusions are so vital to helping people with Sickle Cell. Some warriors need 100 units of blood per year. I‚Äôm so honored American Red Cross of Georgia gave me the opportunity to host this event and share my own story. At the beginning of the year one of my goals was to bring more awareness for my fellow Sickle Cell Warriors. The Creator is really doing his big one with me in this arena. I can‚Äôt help but think of my fellow Warrior and Morehouse brother Elijah. The first person to ask me to share my story. The first person to call me ‚Äúwarrior‚Äù. Despite his own health struggles he always took time to reach out and check on me. To ask how I was doing. To make sure I was taking care of myself. Every time I speak about Sickle Cell, I think of him. And I hope by doing this work I‚Äôm making him proud. 11Alive #SickleCell #RedCross #sicklecellwarrior #scawareness ü©∏"
