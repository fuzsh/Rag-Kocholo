        "text": "Beneath its sculpted exterior, the 2024 Grand Wagoneer harnesses elemental power. With raw strength and reliable capability, the Hurricane Twin-Turbo 510 engine lets you meet whatever lies ahead of you. Premium fuel is required to help maintain the longevity of the engine over extended use and provide optimum engine performance. Engine statistics rated with premium fuel.\n\nLet your smartphone charge. The Class-Exclusive available 10.25-inch Passenger Interactive Display lets your copilot update GPS coordinates, look through vehicle cameras and control audio settings. They can also connect their smartphone via an HDMI cable and watch their favorite entertainment on a beautiful touchscreen just above the glove compartment.\n\nAdvanced security measures help guard the 2024 Grand Wagoneer and everyone inside it against the unexpected. An array of cameras and sensors enable safety and security measures like our available Night Vision Camera with Pedestrian and Animal Detection to prepare for nearly any obstacle in your path.\n\nSome of the brightest visionaries walk the darkest paths. And with its black exterior badging, black accents and 22-inch tinted polished wheels with black inserts, the 2024 Grand Wagoneer with the available Obsidian Package brings a menacing level of blackness that’s as stylish as it is ominous."
