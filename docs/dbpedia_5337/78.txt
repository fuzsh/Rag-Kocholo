Atlanta’s WAGA-AM signed on in 1937. The station’s owner, Storer Broadcasting, started a sister FM station (today’s WVEE-FM) in the 1940s.

WAGA-TV signed on in 1949, seven months after WSB-TV launched. WAGA-TV was a CBS affiliate primarily, but also carried DuMont Television Network programs and shared a secondary ABC affiliation with WSB-TV until WLWA-TV (today’s WXIA-TV) signed on in 1951.

In the 1960s, the station moved to an Antebellum-style mansion, typical for Storer’s broadcast facilities.

New World Communications acquired WAGA-TV in 1993. After decades as a CBS affiliate, WAGA switched to Fox in 1994 as part of series of affiliation swaps in major U.S. cities.

Over its history, WAGA-TV’s news operation generally has been a solid second-place in ratings, behind dominant WSB-TV.

You can find lots of vintage WAGA-TV clips on YouTube. In 1991, the station put together a funny (one-minute) look at it’s history:
