        "text": "William Jefferson Blythe III was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas. His father died in an automobile accident before Bill was born. His mother, Virginia Dell Blythe, later married Roger Clinton, and Bill took his stepfather’s name.\n\nClinton graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1968. He then attended Oxford University in England. In 1973 he earned a law degree from Yale University. In 1975 Clinton married Hillary Rodham, a fellow graduate of Yale Law School. They had one daughter.\n\nClinton became the Democratic candidate for president in 1992. He chose Senator Al Gore as his vice presidential running mate. Clinton defeated his Republican opponent, President George Bush, with 43 percent of the popular vote.\n\nClinton’s first term had many successes. He appointed women and minorities to important posts. He oversaw a major trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. He attended peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in the Middle East. In 1994 he helped return ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.\n\nHowever, Clinton’s plan for a health care system failed. He and his wife also became linked to a business scandal known as the Whitewater affair. Nevertheless, Clinton defeated Republican Bob Dole in the 1996 election. Many people were happy with Clinton because the economy was doing very well.\n\nIn 1998 the public learned that Clinton had had an improper relationship with a young worker at the White House. The U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach the president, or charge him with crimes. The House charged the president with lying under oath and trying to stop the investigation of the affair. In 1999 the Senate found Clinton not guilty.\n\nDespite his impeachment, Clinton remained popular. He spent his last year as president working for peace agreements in the Middle East and in Northern Ireland. Clinton’s vice president, Gore, lost the 2000 election to the Republican candidate, George W. Bush."
