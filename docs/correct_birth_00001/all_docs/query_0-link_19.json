        "text": "RBH produced a 26-minute documentary about Bill Clintonâs childhood in Hope, Arkansas. The video is featured at this National Park site which is the home where President Clinton spent the first four years of his life. Archival images and film intercut with on-camera interviews with Clinton, life-long friends, and colleagues paint a rich portrait of the 42nd President. Translated into five languages, the film welcomes and informs both national and international guests in the Visitor Center adjacent to the homesite.\n\nWinner of a 2020 Telly Gold award for non-broadcast Biography Program.\n\nClients\n\nPresident William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site\n\nProject elements"
