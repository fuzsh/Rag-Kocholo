Bush, son of the man he had defeated for the presidency in 1992.\n\nBill Clinton is known for being the governor of Arkansas, being the third-youngest president to serve, and for an infamous sexual scandal involving a White House intern.\n\nAlthough his second term became embroiled in scandal, Clinton’s ratings as president still managed to remain high and he went on to be involved in various humanitarian activities, much like his presidential predecessor, George H.W. Bush.\n\nEarly Political Aspirations\n\nClinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III, but at 15, he legally adopted his stepfather’s surname and became William Jefferson Clinton. According to Clinton, his stepfather regularly abused his mother, and at times he and his brother had to step in to protect her.\n\nFrom around age 16, Clinton made the decision to be involved in politics. While in high school, he also became interested in law and later attended and graduated from Yale Law School.\n\nDuring his time at Yale, Clinton met his future wife, Hillary Rodham. The couple married in 1975 and had one daughter, Chelsea. Hillary Clinton served as senator and as secretary of state after her husband retired from the presidency.\n\nA Scandal, Impeachment, and Acquittal\n\nClinton began his political career in Arkansas when he was elected as Arkansas attorney general in 1976 and in 1978 as governor. He served again in 1982 and remained as governor until 1992, when he entered the presidential race as the Democratic nominee against George H.W. Bush and third-party candidate Ross Perot.\n\nClinton’s presidential career was defined by polarizing opposites. During his presidency, Americans enjoyed economic expansion. He instituted changes to social welfare and State Children’s Health Insurance programs.\n\nHowever, in his second term, he was impeached by the House of Representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice — but acquitted by the Senate — because of a sexual scandal involving an intern, which took place at the White House.\n\nHe served the rest of his second term and was succeeded by George W. Bush.\n\nDid You Know…?"
