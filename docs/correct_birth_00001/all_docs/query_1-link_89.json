Clinton would later earn a law degree from Yale in 1973. Clinton continued to build his political career through local government, and then set his eye for presidency in 1992. Like many presidents, Clinton's presidency had its ups and downs, such as, achieving a budget surplus and his issue with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nTo find out more about Bill Clinton follow these links:\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/william-j-cl...\n\nhttps://millercenter.org/president/clinton/life-before-the-presidency"
