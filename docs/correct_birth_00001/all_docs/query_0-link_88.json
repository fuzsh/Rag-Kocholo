        "text": "HOPE — The home in Hope where former President Bill Clinton spent the first four years of his life is set to reopen after a Christmas Day fire.\n\nNational Parks Service officials told reporters that volunteers and employees are unpacking boxes in an effort to have the home ready for visitors on Saturday.\n\nThe Christmas Day fire that was called arson damaged the exterior and some of the interior of the home and graffiti was found on a sidewalk and on a door of the home. Authorities did not immediately return phone calls Thursday for comment on whether any arrests had been made.\n\nThe President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site was owned by Clinton's maternal grandparents and he lived there with his mother following his birth in Hope.\n\nRead Friday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details."
