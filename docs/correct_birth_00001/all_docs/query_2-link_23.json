        "text": "Entrance fee is $0.00.\n\nThere is no entry fee for the Visitor Center or Birthplace Home tour. However, we do sell the Annual and Senior passes and issue the Access passes.\n\nPresident William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home NHS is located in Hope, Arkansas - approx. 30 miles from Texarkana (Texas/Arkansas), 114 miles from Little Rock, Arkansas & 209 miles from Dallas, Texas. From I-30, use Exit 30 and travel south on Hwy 278 (Hervey Street) for approximately 2 miles. The Birthplace Home is on your left at the corner of 2nd Street and S Hervey Street; the Visitor Center is located on Division Street (immediately northeast of the Birthplace Home).\n\nAverage temperatures in Hope can range from 30ºF to 60ºF in winter, 40ºF to 80ºF in the spring, 65ºF to 95ºF in summer, and 50ºF to 75ºF in the fall. Humidity in late spring, summer and early fall can make temperatures feel hotter and lead to dehydration or heatstroke. We recommend that visitors in these seasons dress comfortably and drink plenty of water to beat the heat. Inclement weather (tornadoes, thunderstorms) are possible at times, so check local weather conditions before your visit to Arkansas."
