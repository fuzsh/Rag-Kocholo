        "text": "President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site\n\nPresident William Jefferson Clinton's birthplace home in Hope, Arkansas, was officially recognized as a National Park Service site in December 2010. The 42nd U.S. President, born in August 1946, lived in this comfortable frame house with his widowed mother and her parents for four years. Here he learned many of the life lessons that later defined his presidency and his emergence as a global statesman. Today he says, \"I still believe in a place called Hope.\"\n\nThe 2Â½-story home was built in 1917, and was preserved by The Clinton Birthplace Foundation, Inc. It has deep projecting eaves and a broad, one-story hipped roof porch on the front. Its style is \"American foursquare,\" so called because of its square floor plan. The restored interior has much of its original detail, including the staircase in the living room, with its turned balusters and massive, paneled newel post. A small pantry features built-in cupboards. Virtually all of the second floor finishes are original, including the flooring and the beaded board in the hallway and nursery.\n\nThe National Park Service operates a Visitor Center next door to the home, where visitors can tour interpretive exhibits focusing on the life of the 42nd President. Park Rangers offer tours of the Clinton home upon request.\n\nWhat JNPA Does Here\n\nJNPA operates a store at the park's Visitor Center. Proceeds from the sale of the store's products benefit the educational programs of the park. In addition to books and interpretive products that interpret the life of William Jefferson Clinton and his family, the store also offers fair-trade craft products from around the world, upon the request of the former President."
