        "meta_description": "Bill Clinton, who would become the 42nd president of the USA, was born in Hope, Arkansas. His father died in a car accident before he was born, so his mother lived with his maternal grandparents in this house, which is where Clinton spent the first four years of his life, starting in 1946. After Clinton became president in 1993, money was raised to purchase and restore the house. It opened to the public in 1997 as the President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site. The house was transferred from the nonprofit Clinton Birthplace Foundation to the National Park Service in 2010, making it the seventh presidential birthplace/first home that is protected as a National Historic Site.",
