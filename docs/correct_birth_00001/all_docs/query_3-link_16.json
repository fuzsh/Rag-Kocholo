        "text": "Bill Clinton is our 42nd President. He was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas, and served as the governor of Arkansas for twelve years before becoming President. His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is the First Lady of the United States. They have a daughter named Chelsea.\n\nThe President has always loved to read. In fact, with the help of his grandfather, he learned how to read by the time he was three years old! When he was in elementary school, he enjoyed reading Dick and Jane; later his favorite books included Black Beauty and The Last of the Mohicans.\n\nWhen he was in high school in Arkansas, Bill Clinton was chosen to represent his state in a mock government called Boys Nation. He came to Washington, D.C., with other young boys from all across the country. When the group was invited to tour the White House, young Bill was the first in line to shake President John F. Kennedy's hand. It was then that he knew he wanted a career in public service and that he wanted to eventually run for an office.\n\nFor exercise, the President jogs almost every day and plays golf whenever he can. He knows that fitness is a very important part of staying healthy. His favorite color is blue, and his favorite foods are chicken enchiladas, bananas, apples, and vegetable beef soup.\n\nThe White House has its very own movie theater, and President Clinton and his family love to watch movies. The President's favorite movie is \"High Noon.\" He also loves listening to music and playing his saxophone.\n\nAs President, Bill Clinton is working hard to make the United States a better place for all Americans. He wants to provide health care to everyone, to make our streets safe from crime and violence, and to protect our environment. He is working to ensure a brighter future for everyone.\n\nYou can help the President improve our country. You can volunteer in your community, help clean up litter, start recycling programs in your home and school, and help others who are less fortunate than you. Most important, you can work hard in school and prepare yourself for a time when your generation will be leading America.\n\nThe President's job requires him to travel all over the world. He listens to people and gives speeches. One of his greatest joys is meeting young people. Just as President John F. Kennedy inspired him, President Clinton one day may motivate a young person to strive to become President. Maybe that person will be you!\n\nPresident and First Lady | Vice President and Mrs. Gore\n\nRecord of Progress | The Briefing Room\n\nGateway to Government | Contacting the White House\n\nWhite House for Kids | White House History\n\nWhite House Tours | Help | Text Only"
