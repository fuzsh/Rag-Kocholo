The Clinton Homes that are in Arkansas are in my hometown (Fayetteville, AR) and near my family’s hometown (my family is from Nashville, AR, Bill’s is from Hope, AR). But…\n\nUp until recently, I had never explored either. And I’m a historic architecture groupie! What is wrong with me? Luckily the beaux insisted (He loves Hillary. Bill too, but mostly Hillary lol) that we visit the President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site. We’ll just call it “Bill’s birthplace” for short.\n\nBill’s a pretty cool dude. He was the president for most of my childhood (the early years), and just like that one person in every Arkansan family will tell you, my momma once met Bill. His hometown is right down the road from my parent’s hometown. He later lived in a house that is right beside my high school in Fayetteville. He taught at the university I attended. If I go on, heck I might be able to show y’all how we are related, haha! If you have a southern Granny, you know she can tell you how you’re related or almost related to everyone in y’alls neck of the woods. If you want to get technical he is my brother, because he is an honorary member of my brother fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, Incorporated. I learned well from my grandmothers =)\n\nAnywho, to the house. I want it. Can I live there? Or maybe in something very similar – equally as old, but with a few modern updates? Y’all just don’t even know, I would spin in circles of pure joy and happiness in a room like the one Bill’s mother had in this house! Check it all out.\n\nBesides experiencing a historically important and beautiful home, I have one more great takeaway. I purchased this book, “Houses of the Presidents ” (find it here) at the visitor’s center, which is a house next door to the Clinton house.\n\nThis book will make a great coffee table reading piece, and it is full of gorgeous and historically-rich homes that our past presidents have lived it. History and architecture make me giddy and happy and fuzzy inside. Like a unicorn to Agnes =)\n\nNow go forth, and be explorers of your local attractions. If you already have explored close to home, tell me what your favorite local treasure is in the comments below!\n\nUntil next time, Ci Vediamo!!!\n\nOWNG\n\nFind Me!"
