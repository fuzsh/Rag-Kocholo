        "text": "From these humble beginnings came the 42nd President of the United Statesâ€”William Jefferson Clinton. The boyhood home of former President Clinton has been restored as a museum and is open for guided tours. The wood frame house is a two and one-half story American Foursquare design built in 1917 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. For his first four years, Bill Clinton lived here with his maternal grandparents, Eldridge and Edith Grisham Cassidy, at 117 South Hervey in Hope. It was in this house that Clinton spent his formative years.\n\nSelf-guided tours of the exhibits in the reception center/museum are also available. A highlight here is a replica of the Oval Office rug designed by Little Rock designer Kaki Hockersmith. The thirteen yarn colors used in the magnificent rug symbolize the original thirteen colonies of this nation. Also of interest is the \"From Hope to the White House\" exhibit that chronicles highlights of Clinton's life. The gift shop, with posters, architectural drawings of the home, T-shirts, greeting cards, cookbooks and muscadine jelly, is also worth a visit.\n\nRelated El Dorado Photos"
