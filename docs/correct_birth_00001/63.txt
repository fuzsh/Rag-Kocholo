I still believe in a place called Hope.

President Bill Clinton

A Firm Foundation in Hope

On August 19, l946, Virginia Cassidy Blythe gave birth to her son, William Jefferson Blythe III, named for his father who was killed in a car accident three months before he was born. Young Billy Blythe grew up to become William Jefferson Clintonthe 42nd president of the United States.

He and his mother lived with her parents in this house in Hope, Arkansas, where the future president spent the first four years of his life. Growing up in Hope, he embraced the values of this small town.

Here he learned early lessons in the importance of family, education, and racial equality-lessons that served him well in his public life and led him on a path to the nation's highest office.

Our house was just a block away from a railroad underpass, which then was made of rough, tar-coated timbers. I liked to climb the timbers, listen to the trains rattle overhead, and wonder where they were going and whether I would ever go there.

President Bill Clinton

Family and Community

Clinton's mother decided to remain in Hope with her parents, James Eldridge Cassidy and Edith Grisham Cassidy. Although still grieving, she knew she needed to create a new life for herself and her son and decided to further her education. Clinton's grandparents took care of him while his mother completed her training as a nurse anesthetist in New Orleans.

Clinton's grandmother stressed the importance of education for her grandson and taught him to read before he started kindergarten. She also worked as a private duty nurse and provided in-home care for seriously ill patients. His grandmother inspired him to dedicate his life's work to helping others.

Clinton spent much of his time in Hope at his grandfather's store. He saw his grandfather treat all customers with respect, regardless of the color of their skin. Clinton also remembered his grandparents supporting school desegregation in the mid-1950s. These experiences helped shape Clinton's views on race relations and social justice.

... my grandparents and my mother always made me feel I was the most important person in the world to them. Most children will make it if they have just one person who makes them feel that way. I had three.>

President Bill Clinton

When his mother married Roger Clinton in 1950, the young family moved across town to a house on 13th Street. In 1953, they moved to Roger Clinton's hometown, Hot Springs, Arkansas90 miles away. Clinton often returned to Hope to visit his grandparents for holidays and summer vacation.

Although Bill went by the name of Clinton from the time his mother remarried, Roger Clinton never formally adopted him. When his younger brother, Roger Cassidy Clinton, started school, Bill legally changed his name to Clinton.

My grandfather just had a grade-school education. But in that country store he taught me more about equality in the eyes of the Lord than all my professors at Georgetown, more about the intrinsic worth of every individual than all the philosophers at Oxford; and he taught me more about the need for equal justice than all the jurists at Yale Law School.

President Bill Clinton

Public Service

As a student at Hot Springs High School, Clinton excelled in academics and band. Near the end of high school, Clinton set his eyes on public service. He attended Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and was a Rhodes Scholar before starting Yale Law School.

In 1973, Clinton returned to Arkansas to enter politics. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1974, but was elected Attorney General of Arkansas in 1977. In 1979, he was elected Governor of Arkansas. He was defeated for re-election in 198l, but was re-elected in 1983 and served four more terms.

Becoming President

On November 3, 1992, Clinton was elected the 42nd President of the United States. He was re-elected in 1996. During his administration, the nation experienced the longest economic expansion in US history. President Clinton's core values included building community, creating opportunity, and demanding responsibility. He repeatedly stressed the importance of work and family-all lessons he learned in Hope.

During his second term, President Clinton established the William J. Clinton Foundation whose mission is to improve global health, strengthen economies, promote healthier childhoods, and protect the environment by fostering special partnerships among governments, non-governmental organizations, and private citizens to turn good intentions into measurable results. The Foundation's work is based on the belief that people have the capacity to build a better world for themselves and for their children, they just need the opportunity to do so. Through business-oriented solutions that can be implemented locally and replicated globally, the Foundation has built lasting systems that have improved millions of lives and that ensure people and communities can ultimately take control of their own futures.

I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts, and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged only by their worst or weakest moments...Perhaps most important, I learned that everyone has a story....All my life I've been interested in other people's stories. I've wanted to know them, understand them, and feel them. When I grew up and got into politics, I always felt the main point of my work was to give people a chance to have better stories.
