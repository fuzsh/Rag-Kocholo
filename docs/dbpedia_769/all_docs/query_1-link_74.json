Carding forums, in particular, are known for being focused on trading financial information. However, little evidence exists about the sellers that are present on active carding forums, the precise types of products they advertise, and the prices that buyers pay. Existing literature focuses mainly on the organisation and structure of the forums. Furthermore, studies on carding forums are usually based on literature review, expert interviews, or data from forums that have already been shut down. This paper provides first-of-its-kind empirical evidence on active forums where stolen financial data is traded. We monitored five out of 25 discovered forums, collected posts from the forums over a three-month period, and analysed them quantitatively and qualitatively. We focused our analyses on products, prices, seller prolificacy, seller specialisation, and seller reputation, and present a detailed discussion on our findings.\n\nKeywords—Carding forums · Underground forums · eCrime\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\n£479 million of fraud losses on UK issued credit and debit cards were recorded in 2014 [1]. Almost 70% of these losses originate from “remote purchase fraud.” This category of fraud denotes that card details obtained through illicit methods such as phishing, skimming, or hacking are used for fraudulent online transactions. Since consumers have mostly shifted from cash to transactions via payment cards and have become accustomed to online payments, opportunities for theft of payment card details have soared and they have attracted the attention of cybercriminals.\n\nTheft of card information is usually the first step in the chain of credit card fraud. Further stages are resale, validation and monetization of the stolen data. These deals and activities take place in a massive underground economy, usually aided by underground online forums. These forums are popular platforms where card details are traded, thus generating huge revenues for cybercriminals. On forums, fraudsters typically create a thread and write an advertisement for their products as a first posting. Potential buyers either reply within that thread asking to contact them or they contact the seller themselves using private message services or instant messaging services like ICQ.\n\nThe sales volumes thus generated appear to be substantial. It is estimated, for example, that the closure of several credit card related forums in 2012 prevented international fraud to the tune of £500 million [2]. It is therefore important to understand the characteristics of these online forums and the activity of cybercriminals using them.\n\nThe body of research into underground forums is growing but still limited. In particular, there are only a few studies avail- able about credit card related forums. These studies mainly focus on the organisation and the structure of the forums but less on the content itself, that is, the products traded and the activity of the traders on these forums [3]–[5]. In addition, existing studies are usually based on either expert interviews or examinations of forums that have been shut down by law enforcement agents. Active forums are rarely analysed. The examination of closed forums may be problematic since they may differ from those still existing, especially when this difference is the reason why they are closed. Moreover, cybercrime evolves rapidly and tackling this type of crime requires an understanding of the current situation.\n\nIn this paper, we collected data directly from the dis- cussions on the underground forums that we studied, with emphasis on product offers and advertisements posted by potential sellers on the forums. Since sellers come earlier in the fraud chain than the other actors, it might be more efficient to tackle credit card fraud by stopping sellers than buyers, for example. As a result, we excluded buyers and money mules from this study (we will study them in future work).\n\nResearch question. In order to overcome the literature gaps and methodological concerns that we highlighted earlier, this paper aims to shed light on the current situation of underground online forums by analysing real data collected from active forums. We set out to answer the following research question: What does the current situation of underground credit card forums look like? That is, what are the typical features of the forums, what products are sold, and how can the activity of the traders be characterised? After studying existing research literature, we defined the following hypotheses to guide our analyses.\n\nH 1 : Hypothesis 1. Prices of credit card numbers combined with additional information about the cardholder are higher than prices of credit card numbers alone.\n\nH 2 : Hypothesis 2. On active carding forums, a small number of traders are responsible for a large proportion of traffic.\n\n978-1-5386-2701-3/17/$31 ©c2017 IEEE\n\nparticipants on the forums is likely to rise. The increasing spread of different marketplaces and forums would facilitate access to one of them. At least from a historic perspec- tive, Christin [16] confirmed this growth of participants on underground platforms as he observed a linear increase of sellers during his half-year analysis of Silk Road, a large underground marketplace. In the aftermath of Silk Road’s takedown in 2013, the number of sellers on competitor- and newcomer-marketplaces has substantially increased, surpassing the original number of sellers on Silk Road [17].\n\nIn terms of geographic location, forum users come from all over the world. Regarding the sellers, De Carbonnel [18] claims that Russian participants deliver the best quality, while participants from China, Latin America, and Eastern Europe are the leaders with respect to quantity. These geographic patterns, however, vary depending on the types of forums and the services provided. An analysis of a marketplace offering SEO services locates the sellers mainly in India, Bangladesh, and the USA [19].\n\nExaminations in relation to sales quantity reveal substantial differences in seller prolificacy. Farooqi et al. [19] identified an “insider ring” composed of several top sellers. This means that a small number of traders account for a large proportion of traffic on the marketplace. One common characteristic is that they joined the community very early and are frequent visitors to the pages. Christin [16] agrees on the existence of several long-time sellers but also reports on a continual “come and go” of sellers. It is unclear, however, whether they leave the community after making sales or due to unsuccessful attempts.\n\nIn terms of seller prolificacy, Motoyama et al. [7] analysed the records of 6 closed forums and concluded that 10% of the sellers are responsible for 40%–50% of the goods traded. More generally expressed, D ́ecary-H ́etu and Lepp ̈anen [20] reason that some sellers are more effective than others. Their conclusion is based on counting of advertisements of sellers on one underground forum. However, it is doubtful that counting ads is the right approach of quantifying success. Moreover, the analysis of several forums instead of one might have produced more reliable results.\n\nIt is common ground among crime scientists that crime is distributed neither randomly nor evenly [21]. This implies that a small group accounts for more offences than its expected share would be. As earlier stated, studies on marketplaces sug- gest the presence of some highly prolific users. We hypothesise (H 2 ) that on active carding forums, a small number of traders are responsible for a large proportion of traffic.\n\nC. Seller specialisation\n\nLooking at the products sold per seller, several studies found evidence of specialisation amongst sellers. Derived from literature review and expert interviews, Kraemer-Mbula et al. [22], for example, promote an ecosystem perspective to understand the actions of underground traders. Comparable to the legitimate business community, underground ecosystems includes actors that compete against each other, targeting competitive advantage. They try to reach this advantage by specialising in a particular type of product [22].\n\nBy applying a framework of social organisation, Holt [23] identified specialisation on underground forums too. While one\n\nthird of sellers offered various products, two thirds focused on only one product category. As a Symantec report [13] illustrates, there are perpetrators specialising in writing viruses, distributing malware, or monetising credit cards, for exam- ple. In recent years, Symantec has observed an increasing professionalism in all aspects of the underground economy. Their findings are supported by research literature. Sood and Enbody [14] also identified specialisation as a trend in under- ground markets. They argue that these markets are increasingly accessible to people with various technical skills. Hence, there is some division of labour due to differing skills. While analysing seller characteristics on black marketplaces, Soska and Christin [17] discovered numerous specialised sellers, though there was a notable number of vendors selling different products as well. These findings indicate that specialisation is present in the underground ecosystem as in the legitimate business world. Hence, we hypothesise (H 3 ) that specialisation is also discernible on carding forums, that is, most of the traders sell only one product type.\n\nWhat does that mean in terms of product prices? We did not find any association between specialisation and product prices in existing literature. Resorting to economic theories [24], there are long-established economic “laws” that basically state that concentrating on one production task leads to higher efficiency at that particular task. This efficiency enables an increase in production compared to unspecialised suppliers. Due to such economies of scale, products and services can be offered at significantly lower costs and prices can be cut. Applying this to traders on carding forums, we expect cost- and price-reducing effects when sellers specialise in trading of a single product category (due to the economies of scale). Thus, we hypothesise (H 4 ) that specialised traders sell their products at lower prices than unspecialised traders.\n\nD. Seller reputation\n\nOne key aspect in the underground economy is repu- tation [6], [7], [20]. A reputable seller is more likely to be trusted and thus more likely to engage in trades and to complete transactions. On forums, reputation is usually established by positive customer feedback. Buyers may rate their sellers by giving positive ratings if the ordered products have been successfully delivered, and negative ratings if the seller has not delivered and was rather a ripper. Consequently, a seller’s positive reputation score presents their threads in a more credible light, and these sellers have a higher chance of acquiring multiple customers [23].\n\nHowever, the effort to establish baseline reputation appears to be laborious. Before half of traders receive their first positive feedback, for example, they write approximately sixty posts [7]. In this case, the reputation process is intrinsically peer-driven. Sellers are dependent on recommendations by buyers. Sometimes, forum administrators provide a vetting process, often in addition to the peer-driven process and often with intransparent criteria. In those cases, entry costs are relatively high and access to higher tiers is tight [6].\n\nThe emphasis on reputation and trust means that it is in- dispensable for competitive forums to have a well-functioning reputation system. Again, since the above-mentioned findings are widely based on expert interviews and therefore remain\n\nrelatively vague, the actual status regarding currently running carding forums is not known. Since trades on carding forums depend on relationships between mutually distrustful parties, we argue that trust is more important than in legitimate trades. In the event of an unsuccessful deal, the parties hardly have any legal remedies and countermeasures available, except for a negative reputation rating. We thus hypothesise (H 5 ) that the carding forums to be analysed have working reputation systems that are at least as sophisticated as those of legal marketplaces, for instance eBay.\n\nAs discussed, the effort needed to gain trust is extensive. A consequence might be that sellers concentrate on establishing reputation on one specific forum instead of several forums. It is therefore not expected that sellers are present on multiple forums. By assuming this, we support Motoyama’s et al. [7] expectation of non-existing multiple accounts. In contrast, we disagree with Ablon et al. [6], who argue without providing any reasons, that sellers would advertise on multiple marketplaces. We hypothesise (H 6 ), therefore, that the vast majority of actors are not operating on more than one forum.\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n\nIn this section, we describe our data collection approach. We collected the names of underground forums from various sources and selected 5 forums that matched our selection criteria for examination. Data spanning a period of three months was collected from the forums and we tested our hypotheses on the data.\n\nA. Forum search\n\nWe took the following steps to find carding forums. First, we collected names of forums that were mentioned in research literature. Second, we carried out searches via Google. Third, we used other search engines and informa- tion pages, namely Onion search via Tor network, webstatsdomain, and “The Hidden Wiki.” Finally, we searched forums that we already found for references to other forums. In the latter case, we adopted the method of snowball sampling [25]. The only selection criterion at this point was that, due to the authors’ language abilities, the forums had to be at least partly in English or German.\n\nBy this means, we found 25 forums, 15 of them via Google. The 25 forums are listed in Table I. The forum names mentioned in existing literature were of little use since all the mentioned forums had been shut down. We found five forums through other forums, and five from listings and other search pages. Although numerous forums were listed, most of them did not exist any more. Two of the forums discovered during the first search in February 2015 were shut down at the beginning of the analysis in June 2015. Notwithstanding, the carding underworld seems to be dynamic. We found one active forum containing posts dating back to 2008.\n\nBesides forums, we discovered more than two dozen stores (e. Globalcards and Dexter, offering mainly credit card numbers). We did not include these single-vendor marketplaces in our analysis since they differ significantly from forums. They do not gather multiple sellers, they have no reputation systems, and users normally do not communicate with each\n\nForum name Forum address (http://...)

The ones we focused on are highlighted in boldface text.\n\nother. Hence, they do not meet our interest in interactions between forum members.\n\nTo narrow down the analyses, we chose five of the 25 forums (see Table II) for detailed examination: Altenen, Crd- pro, Crimenetwork, Bpcsquad, and Tuxedocrew. The first three are the largest forums we found (measured by the number of posts) and should thus be the most fruitful ones. We excluded Agoraforum despite possessing the greatest number of posts, because 99% of its posts are requests for referral links for registration on Agora Marketplace. Tuxedocrew is included as it is one of the smallest forums and has existed for around two years. Thus, it is not entirely new and it might provide interesting insights when its content is compared to that of larger forums. Finally, we chose Bpcsquad since it is a medium-sized forum. It is remarkable to note that it is the largest one of the very new forums. To sum up, our selection criteria are forum size, founding date, and, to a lesser degree, content. These criteria should ensure a good mix. Altenen, Bpcsquad, and Tuxedocrew are mainly or exclusively in English, Crimenetwork in German, and Crdpro part-English, part-Russian.\n\nB. Temporal sampling\n\nIn order to have a comparable time-coverage of all five forums, we monitored activity on them over a period of three months, specifically from April to June 2015. This means that a snapshot was made by the end of June and data of the previous three months was collected. This three-month period was determined by the largest forum, Altenen. This limitation to three months meant that no full activity-record could be recorded. Furthermore, it introduced the risk of catching three “special” months instead of a whole year’s coverage. However, we argue that the current situation is of interest and not the past, and that three months are still more advantageous than shorter periods. Moreover, the collected data showed that a\n\nwas coded according to product category, country, and product type (e., CVV, UK, Gold). VISA and Mastercard details were not explicitly differentiated since they are usually treated interchangeably by the traders.\n\nNext, we imported the data into SPSS software for statis- tical analyses. At first, we ran general frequency calculations. In order to test Hypothesis 2, the number of traders in relation to the generated traffic was quantitatively computed in the shape of a Lorenz curve. For H 3 , the frequencies of the specialised users were compared to the unspecialised ones. H 1 and H 4 required the application of inference statistics. Since their price distributions resembled Poisson rather than a normal distribution, we performed Mann-Whitney-U tests to determine if there were significant differences between the values. Regarding H 5 , the reputation systems of the forums were evaluated qualitatively. To assess the degree of sophistica- tion in relation to legitimate marketplaces, we compared them to eBay’s reputation system. Strictly speaking, eBay is not a forum and thus not fully comparable. However, we found no suitable legitimate large-scale forum set up to enable trading. Furthermore, eBay comes close to the system of advertising, trading, and buying exercised on forums. Finally, to examine whether sellers operated on more than one forum or not (H 6 ), we reproduced and interpreted the proportions of multiple representations across all forums.\n\nWe carried out these calculations for the entirety of the threads and for each forum separately. Therefore, the results (Section IV) are reported in aggregated form, and where appli- cable, and if enough cases are available, for every individual forum.\n\nIV. DATA ANALYSIS\n\nIn this section, we describe our analyses of the five selected forums and our findings.\n\nA. Overview\n\nWe discovered 25 forums, out of which we selected five forums for analyses. In this section, we describe general attributes of the 25 discovered forums. The attributes are name, members, total posts, accessibility, languages, and founding date.\n\nName. The names and full website addresses of the discovered forums are listed in Table I. They have a wide array of top-level domains, for example .com, .ws (Samoa), and .so (Somalia). The locations that the forums really operate from are usually unclear, and apart from two German-speaking platforms, cannot be derived from the forum content.\n\nMembers. As of June 2015, the smallest forum had 1, members, while the largest had 148,800 members. A com- parison between the first search in February 2015 and the second in June 2015 revealed some substantial increases in members. Cardersforum, for example, grew from 44,200 to 45,700 members (3% increment), and Cardingmafia grew from 98,700 to 121,500 members (23% increment). Altenen, already a large forum in February, was more than twice as large four months later (from 60,700 to 148,800 members, 145% increment).\n\nIt is not clear how many of the members on each forum were actually contributing. Two forums indicated in their forum statistics that only a fraction of members were really active. On Altenen, these were 38,300 of its 148,800 members (25%); on Carder, these were 1,500 of 10,200 (14%). Nei- ther forum disclosed what “active members” actually meant.\n\nTotal posts. The number of posts varied between 150 and 15,778,599. Besides advertisements, the posts comprised mainly answers to advertisements or contributions to discus- sions. Typical answers to offers for sale are “interested please contact me” or “made deal and worked.” In line with the increase in number of members, the number of posts also increased between the two searches (e., Cardingmafia from 31,900 to 37,600 posts, 17% increment). On Altenen, the number of posts doubled (from 607,100 to 1,265,500 posts, 108% increment).\n\nAccessibility. Nine forums were completely open. This means that everybody could access them for free or even without registration. More than half of the forums had private VIP areas that required special registration to join. Access to these areas usually required a recommendation or an invitation by other members. Three forums charged registration fees, $50 in the case of Lampeduza and $100 in the cases of Infraud and Omerta respectively.\n\nLanguages. The forums were mostly in English and Russian, with two in German. Some forums contained international sections in various languages. However, the number of posts in such sections were consistently small.\n\nFounding date. We estimated the founding dates of the forums from the oldest posts found on them, mostly in the introduc- tion or announcement sections. These are not necessarily the founding dates as older posts might have been deleted in the meantime. In addition, forums might have been shut down and reopened under another name (e., Crdpro was formerly Carderpro). We estimated founding dates between 2008 and 2014. A large number of the forums were launched in 2013.\n\nIn terms of size, the median number of members was 28,850, while the median number of posts was 58,150. Ex- cluding the special case of Agoraforum, the number of posts per member varied between 0 (Privatemarket) and 18. (Crimenetwork). Thus, there are forums where only a fraction of the members post messages and there are some where members post numerous messages on average. However, these results have to be treated with caution as posts or members might have been deleted during the existence of the forums.\n\nB. Detailed analysis\n\nIn this section, we present the results of hypotheses testing on the five selected forums.\n\nProducts and prices. Table III presents the numbers, pro- portions (in %), and prices (in US$) per product category. CVVs are further divided by product type. Credit card numbers cost $10 on average, dumps and fullz more than $30. PayPal credentials are advertised for $3. Western Union payments of $100 are sold for $15. As hypothesised (H 1 ), prices for fullz are higher than those for credit card numbers (CVV: mean = 10, median = 10; fullz: mean = 31, median = 30).\n\nThe difference is statistically significant (Mann-Whitney-U = 4011, z = -12, p < 0).\n\nProducts Number Proportion (%) Price ($) CVVs 465 47 10. Classic 98 9 9. Gold 14 1 16. Amex 66 6 12. Others 16 1 13. Unspecified 271 27 9. Dumps 234 23 34. Fullz 140 14 31. PayPal 133 13 3. WU ($100) 15 1 15. Total 987 100.\n\nTABLE III: Products and prices (mean) in total.\n\nExamined per individual forum, prices of CVVs do not vary substantially while those for the other products show considerable variation. Besides price differences, product pro- portions also vary per forum. On Altenen, for example, dumps have a share of 8% of the products analysed. On Crdpro, their proportion is 52%. Yet the absolute numbers are partly very low and the values may thus lack reliability.\n\nPrices per product category depend widely on the effective composition of these categories, that is, on the relative frequen- cies per product type and country of origin. Since the absolute numbers are too low to display these values for each forum, Table IV shows them summarised across all forums. Only product types consisting of at least 10 cases are considered. There is indeed substantial variation between different product types and countries. Amex and Gold cards are consistently more expensive than classic VISA or Mastercard cards. US products are the cheapest, while European products tend to be more expensive.\n\nSeller prolificacy. The products are not sold evenly throughout all sellers on the forums. The Lorenz curve in Figure 1a shows that around 70% do not generate any obvious traffic as sellers, whereas a single user generates 44% of all traffic. This user joined Altenen in summer 2014 and sells CVVs of various countries. Disentangling the individual forums results in similar observations (see Figures 1b, 2a, and 2b). Altenen has the most unequal distribution. Crimenetwork’s distribution is not as extreme but still far from being equal. Bpcsquad and Tuxedocrew have too few vouchings to calculate a Lorenz curve. However, Tuxedocrew has posts dating back to 2013\n\nNumber Price ($) CVV Australia Classic 12 12. Canada Amex 10 14. Classic 14 10. UK Amex 10 15. Classic 17 11. USA Amex 25 7. Classic 31 5.

Gold 27 30.\n\nTABLE IV: Products and prices (mean) per product type with at least 10 cases.\n\nthat still receive vouchings but only in small numbers. Crdpro does not diverge from these distributions.\n\nConsidering the total amount of traffic, however, it is striking that the figures are low, both in the English and in the Russian speaking part. Although Crdpro has 17 times as many users as Bpcsquad, for example, it produced only twice as many advertising threads during the time of observation. Detailed analysis revealed that a substantial number of these threads contain links to shops. Furthermore, there have been no new entries in the two VIP areas since 2013 and the forum appears to have been disconnected during some summer months in 2013.\n\nIn terms of products, the top three sellers on Altenen sell CVVs and WU payments, on Crdpro they sell dumps, and on Crimenetwork, CVVs. As far as reputation is concerned, the high-profile sellers have usually high reputation ratings. To conclude this section, the hypothesis (H 2 ) that a small number of traders are responsible for a large proportion of traffic is accepted. However, we could not confirm the presence of an insider ring, as proposed by Farooqi et al. [19]. Overall, only five of the twenty most prolific users registered in the founding year of the corresponding forum. The others joined later. However, it is possible that some sellers have more than one account and thus have several “joining dates.” This possibility does not seem to be very likely, mainly due to the effort needed to establish reputation for each account.\n\nSeller specialisation. In total, the majority of the users on the forums are not specialised (see Table V), that is, most users sell more than one type of product and Hypothesis 3 has to be rejected. Regarding Crdpro, Bpcsquad, and Tuxedocrew, the hypothesis would be true. However, a closer look at Crdpro reveals that its users generally sell a large variety of the same product category, for instance, credit cards from many different countries. This pattern is exactly the opposite of Crimenetwork’s. Users on Crimenetwork usually sell different product categories but not various types within the same product category, for example, only CVVs from Germany.\n\nThe results for H 3 raise the question about differences be- tween specialised and unspecialised sellers. Building upon H 2 and taking into account the number of vouchings these users receive, no major differences are discernible. Regarding Alte- nen, for example, seven of the twenty users with the most vouchings are specialised. Overall on Altenen, we found a specialisation rate of 31%.\n\nIn terms of prices per product, there are some differ- ences. CVVs, dumps, and PayPal-credentials advertised by specialised users are cheaper than those of unspecialised users; fullz are more expensive (see Table VI). However, only the price difference for dumps is statistically significant at 95% confidence level (Mann-Whitney-U = 1643, z = -4, p < 0). Thus, Hypothesis 4 has to be partially rejected.\n\nThat said, it is delicate to summarise product types be- cause every type and country has its own price. A careful comparison would only contain a single product type. Hence, we made such a price comparison for US Classic CVVs, the most prevalent product type. The result shows no significant difference (Mann-Whitney-U = 54, z = -0, n.).\n\nSpecialised users Unspecialised users Number Proportion (%) Number Proportion (%) Altenen 64 31 142 68.

Total 425 100 547 100.\n\nTABLE VI: Number, proportion, and price of product categories per specialised and unspecialised users.\n\nSeller reputation: Crimenetwork. Crimenetwork’s reputation system was based on “likes,” similar to Facebook. Members may “like” other members. Like scores between 0 and 857 were recorded with a median of 36 likes. Crimenetwork’s escrow service is comparable to Altenen’s. A fee of 4% of the purchase price is charged for successful transactions.\n\nSeller reputation: Bpcsquad. As seen with Altenen and Crdpro, members may rate other members on Bpcsquad by giving positive, neutral, or negative feedback. The scores range from 0 to 80, with a median of 0. Furthermore, there is a thread rating possibility. Bpcsquad also activated an escrow service but did not provide information on transaction fees.\n\nSeller reputation: Tuxedocrew. Tuxedocrew’s reputation sys- tem differed from those seen so far. Users could only rate threads but could not give any feedback on other users. Instead, the forum administrator could award special titles to users. The criteria that had to be met to receive these titles were not published on the forum. Tuxedocrew also offered an escrow service and charged a 15% fee.\n\nOverall, only Altenen’s system appeared to be similarly elaborated as eBay’s. However, it had an amateurish touch, especially the $50 buyer protection reserve which is not able to cover substantial amounts. The other forums had fewer features than eBay and even those were not always working. H 5 is thus rejected.\n\nPresence of sellers on multiple forums. Finally, we examined whether users were present on several forums or not. This was done for all types of sellers including high- and low-profile traders. In total, only six sellers were found trading on more than one forum, namely two on Altenen and Crdpro, two on Altenen and Bpcsquad, and two on Bpcsquad and Crdpro. A detailed analysis of these sellers showed that they were not high-profile but rather low-profile unsuccessful traders trying their luck on several platforms. Hypothesis 6 is thus confirmed; concentration on a single forum was expected.\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section, we summarise our findings on the carding forums that we studied. The apparent lack of specialisation of\n\nforum users is also described. Finally, we highlight limitations of the study.\n\nSummary of our findings. The prices sought for the products offered on the forums lie within the range specified in existing literature. Dumps and fullz are relatively expensive; they are more than three times as expensive as credit card numbers (CVVs). This may be due to the effort needed to gain or monetise the data, the amount of information available, the higher reward potential, and differing demand and supply. Brison [30] argues, for example, that dumps generally promise a higher payoff than CVVs. In contrast, CVVs are well- represented on the forums and thus seem to be available in abundance, which might push prices downwards. However, contrary to Shulman’s assumption [12], the prices of CVVs are still solid. Taking into account the large proportion of CVVs on the investigated forums, trading credit card numbers is presumably still a lucrative business. PayPal-credentials are well-represented on some forums as well, but so far do not seem to replace credit cards as the most attractive trading goods. Western Union money transfer services play only a marginal role on most of the forums.\n\nThe products are advertised by sellers with varied success. Even though some users complete hundreds of transactions, most users do not sell anything at all. This means that the trading sections of the forums are profitable distribution channels for high-profile actors. This domination by a few traders implies that the forums are not typical forums char- acterised by mutual exchanging and participating users. In the carding world, there is somewhat a clash of prolificacy and professionalism. Referring back to the methodology part, that is, the counting of vouchings instead of ads, the latter [20] was probably more suitable to determine criminal performance. Some prolific sellers had only one ad but received dozens of vouchings. Counting of ads would have overlooked that.\n\nSpecialisation is not a key characteristic of sellers, not even of high-profile traders. Specialisation was observed mostly on Crdpro. This might be due to the high proportion of dumps sold on this forum. Dumps constitute almost half of the products sold by specialised users on Crdpro. Dealing with dumps ap- pears to demand a higher degree of specialisation than dealing with only electronically obtainable products. Unlike CVVs or\n\ncredentials, the acquisition of dumps requires a connection to the physical world. Therefore, perpetrators cannot stay in the underground cyberworld only. As a result, it might be costlier for unspecialised users to acquire dumps, thus forcing them to sell dumps at higher prices, which would confirm Smith’s economic theory [24]. Yet the majority of sellers are not specialised. It could be argued that if they are apt or have valuable data sources, they know and distribute other types of illicit products and services. On the contrary, unsuccessful sellers try their luck with another product if it does not work with the first. These users might as well be rippers. Advertising a large array of products might be done to give the impression of a prosperous seller, or they just try various products in the hope that somebody would engage in a trade eventually.\n\nOverall, it is possible that the scope of analysis regarding specialisation is too narrow. There may be some specialisation in the underground world in larger terms where carding itself is already a specialisation. Another reason might be that carding is not as complicated as other cybercrimes like DDoS attacks or large-scale spam campaigns. Regarding DDoS attacks, for example, taking advantage of security vulnerabilities and manipulating compromised machines to send huge amounts of data may require more time and skills than stealing and trading credit card data. Therefore, it makes more sense to be specialised in those domains.\n\nAt least on the investigated forums, and given the available details, users are not present on more than one forum. Thus, it might be true that the effort needed to reach a certain reputation level deters users from establishing themselves on multiple forums, as Motoyama et al. [7] proposed. This effort could also be the reason why most users do not have any ratings at all, as the analysis showed. Another reason for this, however, might be the presence of rippers. Regarding users with high reputation and many vouchings, it is highly unlikely to find any rippers among them. Among users without any reputation scores and vouchings, the proportion of rippers could be large. It is interesting to note that an expert interviewed by Ablon et al. [6] estimates that around 30% of all sellers are rippers.\n\nIn general, and if not stated otherwise, all our findings apply to all five examined forums. However, there are some differences. Sales on Crimenetwork are not distributed as extremely unevenly as on other forums, neither are numerous specialised users present. Various people sell various goods. Crimenetwork is thus more forum-like in terms of mutual ex- change and participation than the other forums. The high num- ber of posts per member confirms this perception. In addition, the forum gives the impression of being well-maintained. It has a myriad of banned users and the administrators comment rigorously if users do not stick to the rules (e., in case a post does not fit into a thread).\n\nCrdpro is the obvious opposite. Its best times were probably in the past. It appears to be in decline. It does not seem to be monitored by the administrators, there is no escrow service, its reputation system does not work, and there is not much traffic. It might be a question of time until the entire forum will be closed.\n\nOn Tuxedocrew (the smallest forum), there are only four recorded threads receiving any vouching. However, the number of vouchings are low and it is thus questionable how fruitful the\n\nbusiness really is. It is possible that some recurring customers buy a lot and do not always vouch. A reason for the small size of this forum might be the high charges for the escrow service or, even more likely, the lack of a user-based reputation system. Only the administrator is able to assess other users, based on intransparent criteria. This might be too little to build trust among the users and to boost trade. Bpcsquad and Altenen do not particularly diverge from the general findings. Bpcsquad is relatively small and the low number of ratings may denote unsuccessful deals. It is thus uncertain how strong this forum will grow in the future. In contrast, the enormous increase in members on Altenen is impressive. Apparently, it is attractive to be a part of this large community. Forums with numerous users usually have diverse products and a multitude of potential buyers, that is, high supply and demand. Both platforms have reasonable and working basic reputation systems. Altenen provides an additional pseudo-protection measure to “protect” buyers from non-delivery and sellers from non-payment. Limitations. We encountered a number of limitations during the study and they are mentioned in this section. First, the three-month period does not allow long-term conclusions. After all, due to the technique of considering the vouchings of this time period, older and very profitable ads were included in the analysis. Second, the examination was carried out from a user’s perspective. That is, no private messages could be studied. In addition, VIP sections on the forums had to be ignored. Thus, the findings of this study do not give a complete picture of the forums. Nevertheless, we gathered substantial amounts of data that allowed some analyses and conclusions. The third limitation concerns the internal validity of the data. It cannot be excluded that other investigators, for instance, law enforcement agents engage in trades on the forums for research and investigative purposes. This might bias the data. However, we do not consider this possibility a substantial threat. Another threat to internal validity is the recorded product prices. The prices advertised are not necessarily the prices that buyers eventually paid. No post was found where the possibility of price negotiations was mentioned. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that users pay other (probably lower) prices than those advertised. Finally, given that the examined forums feature different goods or attract certain types of users, the findings are an artefact of the forums in question and do not represent the entire carding underworld. The results are only valid for the five forums we analysed. The selection of the forums is thus a threat to external validity. This limitation concerns all hypotheses but especially H 6 where an explicit cross-forum comparison was executed. In principle, this limi- tation was overcome by selecting five different forums based on various selection criteria.\n\nFuture work. Sellers are the focus of this study. Future studies should also consider their counterparts, the buyers. The reviewed literature did not cover buyers and they were also neglected in this paper. It might be useful to examine whether there are high-profile buyers and observe what they buy, and whether they resell the products, and to whom, if they resell. Regarding research design and methodology, a long- term or follow-up study might be able to identify trends or confirm the patterns found in this study. Researchers could also consider engaging in trades and getting in touch with the"
