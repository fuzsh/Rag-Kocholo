This increase was powered epigenetically by wild foods which must have included the aquatic food web as the brain evolved in the sea 500 m.y.a. using marine substrates which it still requires today. Deficiency studies have described volumetric deficits, cognitive, learning, behavioural, motor and visual losses. These studies have been complemented by a study of 14,000 pregnancies There was a straight-line relationship between maternal fish and sea food eaten and cognitive, motor and social scores of the children at 8 years of age. Although we and other scientists have been actively concerned about the neglect of the brain since 1971, no government nor any UN agency includes the brain in food and agricultural policies. Average cranial capacity today is about 1,336cc. We have lost a chunk of the brain about the size we started with as a chimpanzee. IQ has been shrinking and the prevalence of mental ill-health has been escalating globally. If these trends continue, humanity will be lost. Action to arrest the decline and continue the upward thrust is urgently needed, 195 words.\n\nBrian, reverse-evolution, mental ill-health, extinction.\n\nSue Whiting BSc, MSc, DPhil, ACA, CTA, GMM\n\nBiographical sketch\n\nSue Whiting is a Grand Master of Memory, was the Women’s World Memory Champion in five consecutive championships (1994-1998) and the 1995 Random Images World Record holder. Her first two degrees were Maths & Physics at Nottingham University (Frank Farmer Hind prize) and DPhil in Astrophysics at Oxford University (Johnson Memorial essay prize). She became a chartered accountant and chartered tax adviser and wrote the CCH Corporation tax guide for five consecutive years (2001/02 – 2005/06). Sue became fascinated by memory techniques when taking a career break to look after her young family. She was acknowledged by Tony Buzan as a special consultant for both his Master Your Memory book (1998 edition) and The Memory Book and was the founder of the inaugural UK school memory championships in 2008 (The Junior Memory Challenge for Year 4 pupils). She has published three books for young children. Following her MSc in Educational Neuroscience (2017, London University) she has continued her research into Stress and Learning (paper published in 2021) and language learning (paper in press). She is also a Heartmath (stress transformation technique) group trainer and 1:1 coach. In her spare time she plays keyboard in an award winning amateur big band.\n\nTitle of presentation\n\nStress and learning in children: Neuroscience evidence and its relevance for teachers\n\nAbstract\n\nEveryone has experienced common symptoms of stress: raised heart rate, excessive sweating or a dry mouth. But not everyone appreciates these are part of the body's ‘fight or flight response’ –evolved to optimise our body's responses to actual physical danger. In addition to bodily changes, stress promotes other, more subtle mental changes – it influences, for example, how we decide what to pay attention to in our environment. In educational settings, an individual's level of stress response in a given situation influences their learning capacities in complex ways. Some stress, manifested in changes to arousal and attention, is required for learning. Too much stress, or stress at the wrong time, may inhibit learning. This complex relationship between stress and learning is highly individual across pupils, depending on multiple long- and short-term factors, as well as the child’s appraisal of the situation and their available coping strategies. A classroom challenge providing optimal learning outcomes for one pupil may provide too much, or too little, arousal for another. Raising teachers’ awareness of the inter-individual differences in their pupils’ stress responses will be an important step in accommodating the differing needs of individual children, enabling more children to achieve their full potential.\n\nKeywords\n\nStress, physiological stress, learning, children, inter-individual variability\n\n•Dr. Jorge Castaneda, CEO of the Buzan Group (United Kingdom)\n\n•Dr. Oscar Yecid Aparicio Gomez, Former Dean of the Faculty of Education of the University of Cundinamarca\n\nDr. Gonzalo Wandosell Fernandez de Bobadilla, Dean of the Faculty of Business Administration and Juridical Sciences, and Mr. Jose Luis Mendoza Garcia, Director General of Institutional Relations of the Catholic University of San Antonio of Murcia (Spain)\n\nTitle: UCAM's internationalization and multiculturalism strategy\n\nVirtual Presentations:\n\n•Dr. Hernan Alejandro Olano Garcia, Rector of UNICOC, Bogota, Colombia\n\noTitle: The University and the thought of Benedict XVI\n\nMr. Miguel Falconi, MS, Director of the Instituto de la Experiencia Exponencial, Ecuador\n\nMr. Fernando Moran, MS, President of Action Growth, Ecuador\n\nHonorable Daniel del Valle Blanco, Member of the Academic Council, Observatorio MAPFRE de Finanzas Sostenibles, Spain\n\nDr. Deepak Paliwal, Associate Professor of Sociology, Indira Ghandhi National Open University, India\n\nMiguel Angel Alava, MEd, Instructor, Liceo Panamericano, Ecuador\n\nCarla Lozano, Adjunct Lecturer, Universidad Estatal de Milagro, Ecuador\n\nJose Luis Alava, Adjunct Lecturer, Universidad de Guayaquil, Ecuador\n\nHector Yepez martinez, Director of the Mediation and Arbitration Centre, School of Government, Universidad Espiritu Santo -UESS, Ecuador\n\nScientific Committee:\n\nProfessor Michael Crawford, Imperial College of London\n\nDr. Oscar Yecid Aparicio Gomez, Dean of the Faculty of Education of the University of Cundinamarca\n\nProfessor Javier Aranceta Bartrina, President of the Royal Academy of Medicine of the Basque Country (Spain)\n\nDr. Ricardo Martins, President of the Pedago Education Group, Portugal\n\nDr. Gonzalo Wandosell Fernández de Bobadilla, Dean of the Faculty of Business Administration and Law of the Catholic University of San Antonio of Murcia (Spain)\n\nProfessor Malcolm Cooper, Emeritus Professor, Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (Beppu, Japan)\n\nProfessor Hernan Alejandro Olano Garcia, Rector of UNICOC Colombia\n\nDr. Guido Poveda Burgos, Universidad de Guayaquil, Ecuador\n\nDr. Martha Fabiola Rizzo Gonzales, director of the Casa de la Cultura, Núcleo Guayas, Ecuador\n\nProfessor Jesús Estupiñán Ricardo, Vice President of the Latin American Association of Neutrosophic Sciences and professor, UNIANDES, Ecuador\n\nProfessor Dean Pardo, Professor Emeritus, Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, Japan\n\nProfessor Olga Lucía Ostos Ortiz, National Director of Research and Innovation, Universidad Santo Tomas, Colombia\n\nDr. Eduardo Diaz Ocampo, Rector of the Universidad Técnica Estatal de Quevedo, Ecuador\n\nDr. Byron Oviedo Bayas, Universidad Técnica Estatal de Quevedo, Ecuador\n\nDr. Deepak Paliwal, Associate Professor of Sociology, Indira Ghandhi National Open University, India\n\nProfessor Magid Shihade, PhD, Vice President for Academic Affairs at Dar Al-Kalima University, Palestinian Authority\n\nProfessor Maria de Jeuss Araiza Vazquez, PhD, Department Chair, Faculty of Accounting and Management, Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, Mexico"
