        "text": "Anthony Cognato’s Holistic Insect Systematics Laboratory has built significant collaborations and training for identifying new species in Ecuador. In May, the lab travelled to Ecuador to meet with collaborators and students from the Universidad Técnica Estatal de Quevedo (UTEQ) for two weeks. Nine students were trained in bark and ambrosia (scolytine) beetle biology, taxonomy, identification and collecting techniques. Collecting expeditions were taken to remote forested sites in the mountains of western Ecuador to assess local beetle and ambrosia fungal diversity. Over 100 scolytine species were collected, many representing new species. Students were also able to field-culture ambrosia fungus necessary for Rachel Osborn’s PhD dissertation. Funding for Rachel Osborn was awarded from the Coleopterists Society Graduate Student Research Enhancement Award and the Department of Entomology’s Hutson Award.\n\nIn previous work, the Cognato group helped identify an undescribed species of xyleborine ambrosia beetle, which was likely contributing to the death of balsa through transmission of a pathogen fungus. Balsa (Ochroma pyramidale) is used widely in industry where lightweight and strong wood is needed such as for wind turbine blades. It constitutes a multi-million dollar international commodity and a major source of revenue for a developing nation, Ecuador. Together with Ecuadorian colleagues, they analyzed bionomic data for the new species, Coptoborus ochromactonus, and reported recommendations for its control. That work laid the foundation to ultimately protecting one of Ecuador’s important commodities and a global industrial resource."
