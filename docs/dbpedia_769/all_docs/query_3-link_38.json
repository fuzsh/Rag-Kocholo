        "text": "This research is based on the need to implement process management with the support of ICT's as an instrument for the determination of strategies that help the realization of continuous improvement; for this, the objective is to determine a procedure to determine the processes for the good management of the Decentralized Autonomous Government of the canton of Quevedo and that with the support of ICT's guarantees an improvement in its management system. We began by designing a procedure according to the characteristics of the cantonal GAD, applied sequentially and with the support of technological tools that facilitated the exchange of information and thus determine the processes. This study involved a literature review, then contrasted with information from experts and the application in the GAD of Quevedo based on scientific research techniques which led us to successfully conclude the work.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nLicensing Agreement\n\nThis journal provides free access to its content through its website following the principle that making research available free of charge to the public supports a larger exchange of global knowledge.\n\nWeb content of the journal is distributed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\n\nAmozarrain, M.
