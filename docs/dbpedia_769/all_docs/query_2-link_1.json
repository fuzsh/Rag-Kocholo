        "text": "The Universidad Técnica Estatal de Quevedo in Ecuador was established in 1976 as an extension to the Luis Vargas Torres University. The extension was in response to the growing popularity in the faculty of agricultural sciences and this addition specialised in forestry and animal husbandry engineering.\n\nThe institution was awarded university status in 1984.\n\nThere are eight faculties at the university including engineering sciences, agriculture and forestry, educational sciences, industry and production, business sciences, economics and finances, health and livestock and biology.\n\nThe university also has a distance learning unit which enables students to study remotely."
