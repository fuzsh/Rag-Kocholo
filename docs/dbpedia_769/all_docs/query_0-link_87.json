They are considered as a good option for the power supply of remote areas. In these systems an energy storage is a vital necessity and very often this storage will consist of batteries which are generally connected in series and parallel arrays, or both. In Mexico as in other countries, the most extensively use batteries used for this application are the stationary and electric car type deep cycle batteries. However the experience with them in these systems is generally not very good. One way to overcome this problem is to maintain a regular monitoring of installing monitoring equipment, in order to make preventive actions before a developing fault can have serious consequences and in this manner increase the practical lifetime of the batteries. Unfortunately, battery monitoring is not easy task because most of the hybrid power systems are installed in remote areas which makes it difficult and expensive. In Mexico it has been not possible to maintain a regular monitoring of all hybrid power systems installed, due to the high cost of this work and the lack of founds.

These transformers will be configured to transfer their stored energy sequentially to an electro-magnetic launcher and form a three-stage power supply. The pulse transformers will act as two winding energy storage solenoids which provide a high current and energy pulse compression by transforming a 50 kA power supply into a megamp level power supply more appropriate for the electromagnetic launcher duty. This system differs from more traditional transformer applications in that significant current levels do not exists simultaneously in the two windings of the pulse transformer.

This issue also has social and environmental aspects. As a promising solution one can examine the direct distribution from the medium voltage power network using new equipment based on the use of power electronics. The aim of the paper is to propose and argue an innovative technical solution for the realization of the Solid State Transformer (SST in order to decrease the number of energy transformation stages compared to the known solutions, simplifying the topology of the functional scheme with the reduction of production costs and the loss of energy in transformers used in electrical distribution networks. It is proposed the solution of simplifying the topology of the AC/AC electronic transformer by reducing the number of passive electronic components (resistors, inductors, capacitors and active (transistors. The inverter of the SST transformer ensures the switching mode of the transistors, using for this purpose the inductance of the magnetic leakage flux of the high frequency transformer. The robustness of the laboratory sample of the SST 10 / 0.22 kV transformer with the power of 20 kW was manufactured and tested. Testing of the laboratory sample confirmed the functionality of the proposed scheme and the possibility of switching of the transistors to at zero current (ZCS mode with the reduction of the energy losses. In the proposed converter a single high-frequency transformer with a simplified construction with two windings is used, which reduces its mass and the cost of making the transformer. The reduction in the manufacturing cost of the converter is also due to the decrease in the number of links between the functional elements.\n\nMicroprocessor Protection of Power Reducing Transformers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nF.

The\n\nOptimization Criteria of Power Transformer Operation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. A. Gonchar\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available It has been shown that minimum losses in active power of a power transformer do not correspond to its maximum efficiency. For a transformer being operated there are no so called Â«zones of its economical operationÂ». In this case strictly specified value of active power losses corresponds to a particular current of the winding.\n\nOn-line Monitoring System for Power Transformers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexandru HOTEA\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Power transformers are the most important and expensive equipment from the electricity transmission system, so it is very important to know the real state of health of such equipment in every moment. De-energizing the power transformer accidentally due to internal defects can generate high costs. Annual maintenance proved to be ineffective in many cases to determine the internal condition of the equipment degradation due to faults rapidly evolving. An On-line Monitoring System for Power Transformers help real-time condition assessment and to detect errors early enough to take action to eliminate or minimize them. After abnormality detected, it is still important to perform full diagnostic tests to determine the exact condition of the equipment. On-line monitoring systems can help increase the level of availability and reliability of power transformers and lower costs of accidental interruption. This paper presents cases studies on several power transformers equipped with on-line monitoring systems from Transelectrica substation.\n\nÃreas protegidas prioritarias para la investigaciÃ³n y el monitoreo de la biodiversidad en Nicaragua\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAntonio Mijail PÃ©rez\n\n2007-02-01\n\nFull Text Available LA PRIORIZACIÃN DE ÃREAS PROTEGIDAS PARA LA INVESTIGACIÃN Y EL MONITOREO de la biodiversidad es una necesidad de la mayorÃ­a de los paÃ­ses, incluyendo los mÃ¡s desarrollados, ya que la disponibilidad de recursos financieros para estos efectos es siempre limitada.

The difficulties to construct new transmission power lines and the continuous increase in the electricity consumption are forcing more and more to operate the electric power systems every time nearer their safety limits. Nevertheless, to assure the system reliability without mattering what so plaintiff is the operating condition is a requirement that the electrical companies must satisfy. This panorama has motivated and impelled the use of new technologies for the critical indicators the monitoring that allow the electrical companies to guarantee the system safe operation. In this paper a methodology for the location of Fasorial Measurement Units, better known as FMU for the monitoring of the critical oscillation modes in the electric power systems is presented.

En Cuba, se aplican cuatro enfoques diferentes: monitoreo sistemÃ¡tico nocturno y diurno (MSN, y monitoreo esporÃ¡dico con o sin comprobaciÃ³n de nidos (MECC. La cantidad y exactitud de los datos tomados y la calidad de la informaciÃ³n derivada de ellos difieren. Por esta razÃ³n, en el presente trabajo se evalÃºa la efectividad de cada enfoque para determinar el Ã©xito reproductivo de tortugas marinas en Cuba. El MSN sÃ³lo se realiza en las playas de anidaciÃ³n de la PenÃ­nsula de Guanahacabibes, mientras que el MECC es el mÃ¡s extendido en el paÃ­s.

Se detectaron diferencias entre el monitoreo sistemÃ¡tico y esporÃ¡dico, por tanto, la capacidad de detectar rastros falsos y verdaderos depende esencialmente de la frecuencia de monitoreo. Esto afecta la capacidad para evaluar el Ã©xito de la anidaciÃ³n por playas. A pesar del incremento en los esfuerzos realizados en Cuba para el seguimiento de las principales colonias de anidaciÃ³n, se deben identificar nuevas estrategias para garantizar la correcta toma de informaciÃ³n, y una mayor eficiencia del programa de monitoreo para obtener la mayor informaciÃ³n posible de cada una de las especies con un adecuado balance de costo-beneficio.\n\nEfectividad del monitoreo de la anidaciÃ³n de tortugas marinas para determinar el Ã©xito reproductivo en playas del sur de Cuba\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJulia Azanza-Ricardo; JosÃ© Luis Gerhartz-Muro; Yanet Forneiro MartÃ­n-ViaÃ±a; FÃ©lix Moncada-GavilÃ¡n\n\n2015-01-01\n\nEl monitoreo de las anidaciones es muy Ãºtil como herramienta para la conservaciÃ³n pero el esfuerzo de trabajo en diferentes Ã¡reas puede variar grandemente.

The appropriateness of different procedures for estimating the transformation parameters is also considered. Standard maximum likelihood (ml) estimation is shown not to be feasible for the joint estimation of the power-shift parameters. However, it is possible to compute local ml estimates for some problems, but special estimation methods may be necessary. An alternative weighted order statistic (wos) estimator is shown to be useful in some situations. Characteristics of ml and wos estimation for the power-shift transformation are examined by a Monte Carlo experiment.

However, the maximum power capacity of piezoelectric transformers is not as large as electromagnetic transformers in practice, especially in the case of high output current. The theoretical power density of piezoelectric transformers calculated by stress boundary can reach 330 W/cm(3), but no piezoelectric transformer has ever reached such a high power density in practice. The power density of piezoelectric transformers is limited to 33 W/cm(3) in practical applications. The underlying reason is that the maximum passing current of the piezoelectric material (mechanical current) is limited by the temperature rise caused by heat generation. To increase this current and the power capacity, we proposed to add a thermal pad to the piezoelectric transformer to dissipate heat. The experimental results showed that the proposed techniques can increase by 3 times the output current of the piezoelectric transformer. A theoretical-phenomenological model which explains the relationship between vibration velocity and generated heat is also established to verify the experimental results.\n\nDYNAMICS MODEL OF MOISTURE IN PAPER INSULATION-TRANSFORMER OIL SYSTEM IN NON-STATIONARY THERMAL MODES OF THE POWER TRANSFORMER\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nV.V.

[and others\n\n1996-03-01\n\nDevelopment of the superconducting transformer is arguably the most difficult of the ac power applications of superconductivity - this is because of the need for very low ac losses, adequate fault and surge performance, and the rigors of the application environment. This paper briefly summarizes the history of superconducting transformer projects, reviews the key issues for superconducting transformers, and examines the status of HTS transformer development. Both 630-kVA, three-phase and 1-MVA single phase demonstration units are expected to operate in late 1996. Both efforts will further progress toward the development of economical and performance competitive superconducting transformers.\n\nANALYSIS OF OPTIMUM OPERATING MODES OF POWER TRANSFORMERS UNDER OPERATING CONDITIONS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nI.

The study of parallel operation optimal modes of transformer equipment for a variety of operating conditions: same or different types of transformers, with or without reactive power flows. Methodology. Losses of energy in transformers make 30 % of all losses. Therefore the choice of the economically justified parallel operation of transformers is effective action to reduce losses. Typically, in the calculations of reactive power flows in the transformers are not taken into account. It is interesting to analyze the optimal operating conditions of transformers with and without reactive power flows. Results.

In recent years, remarkable improvements in the performance of YBaCuO (YBCO) tape wire have been seen. This kind of tape wire has the property that its critical current is large in a highly magnetic field; and, its use is expected to reduce AC loss by applying slit processing on the tape wire, contributing to future cost reductions. In addition, the development of efficient, economical cryogenic units is also expected. The authors have developed a conceptual design for a 66 kV/20 MVA power transformer using YBCO tape wires, or an YBCO power transformer. As a result, we were able to identify the transformer's optimal system structure including coil winding comprised of coils and tape wires; and, we confirmed that the devised transformer can made to be both compact and highly efficient\n\nMonitoring systems online of oil for transformers of nuclear power plants\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSarandeses, S.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe nuclear power plants are showing their concern due to the existence of recent failures related to the bulky transformers of power.

Traditionally, power has referred to authority, influence, control. The research of literary works, however, has led me to the realization that the notion of power is understood in different terms in literature in comparison to how it is explained in philosophy and the social sciences. In order to contribute to the broader understanding of power from a literary point of view, this essay examines many questions concerning this phenomenon, such as: how does the past understanding of power determine how it is accepted and interpreted in the present? How are the success of the present efforts and initiatives affected by the memory of power? The essay attempts to show that the memory of the notion of power is not and cannot be fixed and given once and for all. Therefore, the literary examples provided demonstrate how the definitions of power given in the past are transformed and transfigured by present literary works, which show how we may âforgetâ what we know about this phenomenon, and define it from a new perspective.\n\nPCB transformer fires: the risk in nuclear power plants\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBlackmon, K.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nIt is estimated that 1/2 of the present nuclear power plants operate with PCB-filled transformer equipment. In an attempt to obtain better estimates of clean-up costs in a nuclear power plant under reasonable-loss scenarios, a study was commissioned. This study was a joint venture between Blackmon-Mooring Steamatic Technologies, Inc., (BMS-TECH) and M and M Protection Consultants. This joint study was conducted at a typical pressurized-water reactor plant consisting of two 1000-MW units. Three specific scenarios were selected and analyzed for this typical power plant. These scenarios were: (1) an electrical failure of a transformer in an isolated switch gear room; (2) a transformer exposed to a 55-gallon transient combustion oil fire in the auxiliary building; and (3) a PCB transformer involved in a major turbine lube fire in the turbine building. Based on results of this study, the insurance carriers for this industry implemented an adjustment in their rate structures for nuclear power plants that have PCB equipment\n\nTransforming Power Systems Through Global Collaboration\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAmbitious and integrated policy and regulatory frameworks are crucial to achieve power system transformation.

This paper presents a novel kernel density estimator for probabilistic wind power forecasting, addressing two characteristics of wind power which have adverse impacts on the forecast accuracy, namely, the heavily skewed and double-bounded nature of wind power density. Logarithmic transformation is used to reduce the skewness of wind power density, which improves the effectiveness of the kernel density estimator in a transformed scale. Transformations partially relieve the boundary effect problem of the kernel density estimator caused by the double-bounded nature of wind power density. However, the case study shows that there are still some serious problems of density leakage after the transformation. In order to solve this problem in the transformed scale, a boundary kernel method is employed to eliminate the density leak at the bounds of wind power distribution. The improvement of the proposed method over the standard kernel density estimator is demonstrated by short-term probabilistic forecasting results based on the data from an actual wind farm. Then, a detailed comparison is carried out of the proposed method and some existing probabilistic forecasting methods\n\nOptimal Operation of Distribution Electronic Power Transformer Using Linear Quadratic Regulator Method\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohammad Hosein Rezaei\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Transformers perform many functions such as voltage transformation, isolation and noise decoupling. They are indispensable components in electric power distribution system. However, at low frequencies (50 Hz, they are one of the heaviest and the most expensive equipment in an electrical distribution system. Nowadays, electronic power transformers are used instead of conventional power transformers that do voltage transformation and power delivery in power system by power electronic converter. In this paper, the structure of distribution electronic power transformer (DEPT are analized and then paid attention on the design of a linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR with integral action to improve dynamic performance of DEPT with voltage unbalance, voltage sags, voltage harmonics and voltage ï¬icker. The presentation control strategy is simulated by MATLAB/SIMULINK. In addition, the results that are in terms of dc-link reference voltage, input and output voltages clearly show that a better dynamic performance can be achieved by using the LQR method when compared to other techniques.\n\nA study on the diagnosis for power transformer by ultrasonic wave detection(2)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLee, Sang Guk; Gil Doo Song\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe objectives of this study is to develop a device which could diagnose periodically the degradation of power transformer using ultrasonic signal through ultrasonic transducer attached surface of power transformer.

Failures in transformers can affect the quality and cause interruptions in the power supply. Partial discharges are a phenomenon that can cause failures in the transformers if not properly monitored. Typically, the monitoring requires high-cost corrective maintenance or even interruptions of the power system. Therefore, the development of online non-invasive monitoring systems to detect partial discharges in power transformers has great relevance since it can reduce significant maintenance costs. Although commercial acoustic emission sensors have been used to monitor partial discharges in power transformers, they still represent a significant cost. In order to overcome this drawback, this paper presents a study of the feasibility of low-cost piezoelectric sensors to identify partial discharges in mineral insulating oil of power transformers. The analysis of the feasibility of the proposed low-cost sensor is performed by its comparison with a commercial acoustic emission sensor commonly used to detect partial discharges. The comparison between the responses in the time and frequency domain of both sensors was carried out and the experimental results indicate that the proposed piezoelectric sensors have great potential in the detection of acoustic waves generated by partial discharges in insulation oil, contributing for the popularization of this noninvasive technique.\n\nPartial Discharge Monitoring in Power Transformers Using Low-Cost Piezoelectric Sensors\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBruno Castro\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Power transformers are crucial in an electric power system.

Power transformers are a most vital component in the complicated smart grid network. Any transformer failure can cause damage of the whole power system, within which the failures caused by overloading cannot be ignored. This research gives a new insight into overload capability assessment of transformers. The hot-spot temperature of the winding is the most critical factor in measuring the overload capacity of power transformers. Thus, the hot-spot temperature is calculated to obtain the duration running time of the power transformers under overloading conditions. Then the overloading probability is fitted with the mature and widely accepted Weibull probability density function. To guarantee the accuracy of this fitting, a new objective function is proposed to obtain the desired parameters in the Weibull distributions. In addition, ten different mutation scenarios are adopted in the differential evolutionary algorithm to optimize the parameter in the Weibull distribution. The final comprehensive overload capability of the power transformer is assessed by the duration running time as well as the overloading probability. Compared with the previous studies that take no account of the overloading probability, the assessment results obtained in this research are much more reliable.\n\nA Poisson-Fault Model for Testing Power Transformers in Service\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDengfu Zhao\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a method for assessing the instant failure rate of a power transformer under different working conditions. The method can be applied to a dataset of a power transformer under periodic inspections and maintenance. We use a Poisson-fault model to describe failures of a power transformer. When investigating a Bayes estimate of the instant failure rate under the model, we find that complexities of a classical method and a Monte Carlo simulation are unacceptable. Through establishing a new filtered estimate of Poisson process observations, we propose a quick algorithm of the Bayes estimate of the instant failure rate. The proposed algorithm is tested by simulation datasets of a power transformer. For these datasets, the proposed estimators of parameters of the model have better performance than other estimators. The simulation results reveal the suggested algorithms are quickest among three candidates.\n\nSafety of power transformers, power supplies, reactors and similar products - Part 1: General requirements and tests\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission.

It is one of the largest and most expensive component in most of the high voltage and high power systems. Its size is inversely proportional to the operating frequency. The central idea behind a power electronic transformer (PET) also known as solid state transformer is to reduce the size of the transformer by increasing the frequency. Power electronic converters are used to change the frequency of operation. Steady reduction in the cost of the semiconductor switches and the advent of advanced magnetic materials with very low loss density and high saturation flux density implies economic viability and feasibility of a design with high power density. Application of PET is in generation of power from renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar. Other important application include grid tied inverters, UPS e.t.c. In this thesis non-resonant, single stage, bi-directional PET is considered. The main objective of this converter is to generate adjustable speed and magnitude pulse width modulated (PWM) ac waveforms from an ac or dc grid with a high frequency ac link. The windings of a high frequency transformer contains leakage inductance. Any switching transition of the power electronic converter connecting the inductive load and the transformer requires commutation of leakage energy. Commutation by passive means results in power loss, decrease in the frequency of operation, distortion in the output voltage waveform, reduction in reliability and power density. In this work a source based partially loss-less commutation of leakage energy has been proposed. This technique also results in partial soft-switching. A series of converters with novel PWM strategies have been proposed to minimize the frequency of leakage inductance commutation. These PETs achieve most of the important features of modern PWM ac drives including 1) Input power factor correction, 2) Common\n\nRotary Power Transformer and Inverter Circuit\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMclyman, C.

The most widely used technique in signal analysis applications is the Fourier transform in the frequency domain to generate power spectral densities (PSD). However, the Fourier transform is global in nature and will obscure any non-stationary signal feature. Lately, a powerful technique called the Wavelet Transform, has been developed. This transform uses certain basis functions for representing the data in an effective manner, with capability for sub-band analysis and providing time-frequency localization as needed. This paper presents a brief overview of wavelets applied to the nuclear industry for signal processing and plant monitoring. The basic theory of Wavelets is also summarized. In order to illustrate the application of wavelet transforms data were acquired from the operating nuclear power plant Borssele in the Netherlands. The experimental data consist of various signals in the power plant and are selected from a stationary power operation. Their frequency characteristics and the mutual relations were investigated using MATLAB signal processing and wavelet toolbox for computing their PSDs and coherence functions by multi-resolution analysis. The results indicate that the sub-band PSD matches with the original signal PSD and enhances the estimation of coherence functions. The Wavelet analysis demonstrates the feasibility of application to stationary signals to provide better estimates in the frequency band of interest as compared to the classical FFT approach.
