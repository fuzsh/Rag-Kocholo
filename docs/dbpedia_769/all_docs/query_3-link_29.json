The username will be the same as the one used in the UTEQ application system and the password will have the following format (cedula*year of birth). They will have to register a socio-economic survey, update their personal data and upload their baccalaureate data, after which they will be able to access the \"Enrolment\" module and accept their enrolment.\n\nApplicants who will be studying for the second time must select the subject(s), in which case a fee will be charged for the loss of free tuition, which must be paid by 5 December 2023. If payment is not made on time, the enrolment will be cancelled.\n\nLink to the Banco del Pacífico payment tutorial to facilitate the process.\n\nIt is important that you comply with the established requirements to legalise your studies at the Universidad Técnica Estatal de Quevedo and not lose your enrolment!\n\nCheck the important dates in the Academic Calendar of Nivelación 2023-2024 SPA."
