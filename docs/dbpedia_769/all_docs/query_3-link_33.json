        "text": "What is Open Access?\n\nOpen Access is an initiative that aims to make scientific research freely available to all. To date our community has made over 100 million downloads. It’s based on principles of collaboration, unobstructed discovery, and, most importantly, scientific progression. As PhD students, we found it difficult to access the research we needed, so we decided to create a new Open Access publisher that levels the playing field for scientists across the world. How? By making research easy to access, and puts the academic needs of the researchers before the business interests of publishers.\n\nOur Authors and Editors\n\nWe are a community of more than 103,000 authors and editors from 3,291 institutions spanning 160 countries, including Nobel Prize winners and some of the world’s most-cited researchers. Publishing on IntechOpen allows authors to earn citations and find new collaborators, meaning more people see your work not only from your own field of study, but from other related fields too.\n\nContent Alerts\n\nBrief introduction to this section that descibes Open Access especially from an IntechOpen perspective\n\nHow it Works Manage preferences\n\nContact\n\nWant to get in touch? Contact our London head office or media team here\n\nCareers\n\nOur team is growing all the time, so we’re always on the lookout for smart people who want to help us reshape the world of scientific publishing.\n\nAquacultural Homoeopathy: A Focus on Marine Species\n\nBy Mazón-Suástegui José Manuel, Tovar-Ramírez Dariel, Salas-Leiva Joan Sebastian, Arcos-Ortega Guadalupe Fabiola, García-Bernal Milagro, Avilés-Quevedo María Araceli, López-Carvallo Jesús Antonio, García-Corona José Luis, Ibarra-García Laura Elizabeth, Ortíz-Cornejo Nadia Livia, Teles Andressa, Rosero-García Antonia, Abasolo-Pacheco Fernando, Campa-Córdova Ángel Isidro, Saucedo Pedro, Barajas-Frías José Delfino, Ormart-Castro Pablo, Rodríguez- Jaramillo Carmen, González-González Reinaldo, Barajas-Ponce Ulysses, Tordecillas-Guillén Jorge Luis, Álvarez-Gil Francisco Antonio, Pineda-Mahr Gustavo, Peiro-López Jesús and Robles- Mungaray Miguel\n\nHomoeopathy is an alternative medical system proposed by Samuel Hahnemann in the eighteenth century. It uses highly diluted and agitated substances that derived from plants, minerals or animals, which have shown to be effective in human medicine, agronomy, veterinary, and as a novelty, in marine aquaculture. Aquacultural homoeopathy has developed rapidly in recent years, partially motivated by the misuse of powerful drugs (hormones, antibiotics, disinfectants) that when solving a problem generate undesirable side effects. In the last 10 years, scientific articles have been published on its application in freshwater fish native to Brazil, obtaining beneficial effects on growth, survival, hepatosomatic index, development of muscle fibres and lipid content in muscle. At Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR, Mexico: www.cibnor.mx), we have studied the effects of homoeopathy to improve the culture of economically important marine species of molluscs, fish and shrimp. In this chapter, we show a selection of different research with preliminary or advanced results, related to the use of homoeopathy and its impact on zootechnic, biochemical, genomic and transcriptomic parameters in marine molluscs, fish and crustaceans. The results obtained suggest that homoeopathy is an eco-friendly alternative applicable in aquaculture industry to improve various productive and health aspects.\n\nPart of the book: Aquaculture\n\nAgricultural Homoeopathy: A New Insight into Organics\n\nBy Mazón-Suástegui José Manuel, Ojeda-Silvera Carlos Michel, García-Bernal Milagro, Avilés-Quevedo María Araceli, Abasolo-Pacheco Fernando, Batista-Sánchez Daulemys, Tovar-Ramírez Dariel, Arcos-Ortega Fabiola, Murillo-Amador Bernardo, Nieto-Garibay Alejandra, Ferrer-Sánchez Yarelys, Morelos-Castro Rosa María, Alvarado-Mendoza Alex, Díaz-Díaz Miriam and Bonilla-Montalvan Boris\n\nAt present, agricultural homoeopathy is being increasingly implemented worldwide to mitigate the negative effects caused by the indiscriminate use of chemical products in conventional agricultural practices. It is a viable alternative to improve organic agriculture, since homoeopathic medicines are innocuous substances with a capability to activate measurable response mechanisms when used in plants, animals and humans. Experimental research results allow us to conclude in this chapter that agricultural homoeopathy is able to stimulate favourable biological and even genetic responses in plants (basil Ocimum basilicum L., bean Phaseolus vulgaris L., cucumber Cucumis sativus L., tomato Solanum lycopersicum L.), which shows a novelty insight for organic agriculture.\n\nPart of the book: Multifunctionality and Impacts of Organic and Conventional Agriculture"
