        "text": "CONTENT WARNING: NUDITY AND DEPICTIONS OF SEX\n\nBounce\n\nDIRECTOR: Elizabeth Hicks • NL • 10 minutes\n\nDarcy is a fifteen-year-old mix of energy, perfectionism, and insecurity. When an ultra-cute boy from her cadet corps insists that she attend that night’s Trampoline Social, Darcy raids her sister’s drawers and sets off for a dramatic evening of self-acceptance and sweet backflips.\n\nBoy Toy\n\nDIRECTOR: Sherri Levesque • NL • 5 minutes\n\nIn this quirky love story, Jane falls for a sketchy hand puppet named Jerome. Her delusion deepens when she feels betrayed by her inanimate partner. This off-beat romantic comedy is as delightful as it is absurd.\n\nGhost Roommate\n\nDIRECTOR: Veronica Dymond • NL • 10 minutes\n\nDesperate for an apartment, George finally lands a great spot - only to discover her new roommate is less corporeal than expected. Ghost Roommate is a funny and heartfelt film about first impressions, new friendships, and the ghastly state of the rental market\n\nJill and Lill Do Knick Knacks\n\nDIRECTOR: Keith Jordan • Ireland • 14 minutes\n\nTwo teenage girls find themselves in deep water after a seemingly innocuous prank ends in manslaughter. Jill and Lill is laugh-out-loud funny, with an absurd series of events paired with perfectly delivered dialogue that is equal parts hilarious and poetic.\n\nLate Summer\n\nDIRECTOR: Ryan Steel • Manitoba • 11 minutes\n\nA mute loner encounters ambivalent feelings, first loves, and the heart break of pre-adolescence at a haunted summer camp. Late Summer brings the retro camp aesthetic to life with fantastic use of practical and visual effects paired with sets and costumes that bring this charming film to life.\n\nPeter the Grave\n\nDIRECTOR: Matthieu Moerlen • France • 12 minutes\n\nMatthias & Victoria wander through the labyrinthine Saint-Ouen Cemetery in search of a grave. With no help from the groundskeeper the search seems hopeless but this young couple will find something else they were looking for on this adventure. Romantic, charming, and humorous, Peter the Grave brings a love story to an unlikely setting.\n\nThe Odds of That\n\nDIRECTOR: Michelle T Clemens • NL • 6 minutes\n\nTwo sisters who had given birth to sons just before the COVID pandemic commiserate about the trials and tribulations of motherhood over drinks, but while catching up they make a shocking discovery that may tear their family apart.\n\nMe No Pause\n\nDIRECTOR: Kelly Meadus • NL • 5 minutes\n\nMenopause will impact every woman. It will change relationships, the way women feel about themselves, how they interact with others, and their perception of the world. In this experimental short comedy, \"Me No Pause,\" we see the struggles of this midlife biological shift in a dark but playful light."
