        "text": "Married to Laughter: A Love Story Featuring Anne Mora\n\nJerry Stiller. Random House Audio Publishing Group, $25.95 (0pp) ISBN 978-0-553-52759-9\n\nSeinfeld fans who pick up this audio expecting inside dish on the show will be disappointed. This is not Stiller comedy, but the real stuff about his real life and his longtime love and comedy partner, Anne Meara, as well as a personal history of Stiller's long career, including details of nearly every production he performed in, from local community theaters to Broadway to film to Stiller and Meara's frequent spot on The Ed Sullivan Show. Stiller's familiar, gritty, New York voice is fun to listen to as he offers colorful anecdotes: co-starring with a mangy, flea-bitten dog in Two Gentleman of Verona (the dog ended up making headlines and appearing on TV talk shows); playing opposite Divine in the cult film Hairspray; and creating the abrasive, louder-than-life character of Frank Costanza (Stiller was originally directed to play the role in a subdued monotone, but when the scene didn't gel in rehearsal, Stiller asked if he could try something different and proceeded to scream his way through the scene, reducing everyone to hysterics). Frank Costanza notwithstanding, Stiller turns noticeably tender as he speaks of his 40-year relationship with his wife, the supportive letters of his late acting teacher and mentor and a poignant visit with his dying father. Simultaneous release with the Random House hardcover (Forecasts, July 24).
