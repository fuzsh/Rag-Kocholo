        "text": "Filmed live from The Old Vic in London during a sold out run in 2019, Matthew Warchus’s multi award-winning production of Noël Coward’s provocative comedy, starring Andrew Scott, is a giddy and surprisingly modern reflection on fame, desire and loneliness. As he prepares to embark on an overseas tour, star actor Garry Essendine’s colourful life is in danger of spiralling out of control. Engulfed by an escalating identity crisis as his many and various relationships compete for his attention, Garry’s few remaining days at home are a chaotic whirlwind of love, sex, panic and soul-searching."
