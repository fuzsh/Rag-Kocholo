        "text": "April 1st, 2023 was a big day and I don’t say that because it was April Fool’s Day. It was a big day because one of the best romantic comedies (if not the best), “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days”, was finally available to stream on Netflix. Tell me I wasn’t the only one that screamed out of excitement when they opened their Netflix and saw that gem of a movie on their home feed.\n\nIf you are a romantic at heart but also love a good pee-in-your-pants laugh then there is nothing quite like a romantic comedy. With their witty banter, charming characters, and over-the-top situations that probably would never happen in real life, romantic comedies have been a staple in our house as our go-to movie type to watch on a date night “in”. It’s the only type of movie I don’t fall asleep watching if I am being honest here.\n\nGrab some popcorn or make yourself a cute movie night charcuterie board, get cozy under a blanket, and enjoy some love, laughter, and happily ever after as I share the 20 best romantic comedies. From classics to recent gems, I am sure you will find something everyone will enjoy watching.\n\n20 Best Romantic Comedies\n\n1.
