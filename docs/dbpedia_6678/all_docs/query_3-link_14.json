        "text": "Beloved by the British public for her string of hit pre-war films, Gracie Fields's Lancastrian earthiness, impish humour and memorable songs have endeared her to many generations of fans. Love, Life & Laughter sees Gracie starring opposite '30s leading man John Loder in this decidedly working class spin on a Ruritanian romance. It is presented here as a brand-new high definition transfer from original film elements in its original theatrical aspect ratio.\n\nPublican's daughter Nellie catches a handsome stranger's eye whilst impersonating Nell Gwyn at a charity pageant. This is no ordinary admirer, however, but the Crown Prince of Granau - who is so enamoured with Nellie's charms that he's compelled to break off his engagement and desert his fianc√©e.\n\nFirst released: Monday 23rd March 2020\n\nExtra features\n\nImage gallery\n\nFear not! Many items can still be ordered. Amazon in the UK delivers to many international territories, whilst their Australia, USA and Canada stores also supply many equivalent or imported items.\n\nIf you are in the North America, look out for US/Canadian flag icons on popular product listings for direct links.\n\nIf you order from a UK store, please note that the UK is in Region 2 and B, respectively, for DVDs and Blu-rays - check your player's compatibility, or look for multi-region products if you are located in another region.\n\nIf you are in Australia or New Zealand (DVD Region 4), note that almost all DVDs distributed in the UK by the BBC and 2entertain are encoded for both Region 2 and Region 4. The UK and Australasia are in the same Blu-ray region (B).\n\nFurther information & advice on importing"
