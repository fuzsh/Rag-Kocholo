Your home and neighborhood is the backdrop to your life as a family and my preferred location but we can venture other places too! I take video clips in and around your home and incorporate these little vignettes in your film.\n\nMy goal is to weave your video clips into a\n\nthat takes you back to a specific time and place and reminds you of the countless little details your heart clings to today. Photos are included in every film package!\n\nA time capsule of a day in your life together as a family. Intended to capture the connections and details that comprise your family and make a house a home. My goal isn't to just document what an everyday kind of day looked like for your family in this season...I want to capture what it felt like for you. This is a gift to your kids...a chance for them to relive a day from their childhood.\n\nI have admired Amy's family photos for years, and was incredibly excited to hear of her new found love of videography!\n\nWhat a gift it will be to hear our kids laugh, see how they looked at us and how we interacted as a family...we will treasure our video for the rest of our lives.\n\nI would HIGHLY highly recommend Amy's family films to anyone and everyone!\n\nThis was our first time doing a family video and we loved it. The process was stress free, as the kids had freedom to move around and be themselves. They enjoyed having quality time with my husband and me and as a family. We played in a beautiful setting while Amy quietly captured family memories. Amy's video captured the essence of our family and the interactions between us. Amy used her talents to tell a beautiful story with her video and we're so thankful for her bringing the beautiful parts of our family into the light.\n\nI have admired Amy's family photos for years, and was incredibly excited to hear of her new found love of videography! I wasn't sure what to expect after scheduling an at-home video session. Soon after she arrived, she began shooting and at times our family actually forgot she was there! Her kind spirit and passion for capturing the in-between moments put us completely at ease. She encouraged us to just be ourselves and let the time unfold naturally. It was a really special time together as a family.\n\nA couple of weeks later (on Mother's Day no less!), I awoke to an email with a link to our video. To say that we were overwhelmed with emotion is an understatement! We watched the video through teary eyes, and could not believe how beautifully she captured our family. She truly captured our children's personalities. I can't even imagine looking at this video 10, 20, 30 years from now. What a gift it will be to hear our kids laugh, see how they looked at us and how we interacted as a family...we will treasure our video for the rest of our lives.\n\nI would HIGHLY highly recommend Amy's family films to anyone and everyone!\n\nWe had the pleasure of working with Amy to create a beautiful family film. For us, a film was the best way to capture our toddlers and all of the special little details we are at risk of forgetting. As we played at a local farm, Amy made it so easy to be ourselves as she blended in the background. We were amazed at the way Amy captured everything: their little hands in motion, the giggles when we tossed them in the air, and the way they smiled when they saw a bunny or a flower. Most importantly, the final film showed us - us together having fun on a warm summer night...and that moved us to tears. While we cannot freeze time, we are thankful every time we watch the film and remember some of our most precious moments together. We know the kids will love looking back at our family as they grow older and we canâ€™t wait to make another film next year!"
