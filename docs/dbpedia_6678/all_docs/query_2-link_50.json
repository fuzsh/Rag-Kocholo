        "text": "Humor is one of the 24 character strengths one can possess. Even more so, this positive trait can also impact our health. Laughing regularly helps us feel better physically and mentally, even offering social benefits.\n\nRecognizing the many health benefits of laughter can help us understand the importance of adding more humor into our lives. We also share a few things you can do to laugh more often, enabling you to maximize humor's benefits.\n\nPhysical Health Benefits of Laughter\n\nYou may have heard the saying, \"Laughter is the best medicine.\" This phrase sums up how taking the time to laugh can boost our physical health. Here are a few ways it does this.\n\nBoosts Immunity\n\nLaughter can help strengthen our immune system by increasing antibody-producing cells and enhancing T-cell effectiveness. Stronger immunity means that we're better able to fight off the latest cold or flu bug, also reducing our risk of major disease.\n\nImproves Heart Health\n\nStudies have associated laughter with a lower prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. In one particular study, researchers noted that people who laughed daily had a reduced prevalence of conditions affecting the cardiovascular system. This makes regular laughing good for the heart,\n\nReduces Metabolic Syndrome Risk\n\nAnother study links laughter with a reduction in metabolic syndrome risk factors. In this study, subjects who engaged in laughter yoga (a form of yoga that utilizes simulated laughter) for 12 weeks significantly reduced their body weight, body mass index (BMI), and stress—all of which can increase one's risk of developing metabolic syndrome.\n\nIncreases Longevity\n\nAnother piece of research adds that, in addition to being associated with reduced cardiovascular disease incidences, regular laughing is also connected with reduced all-cause mortality. This suggests that laughter can enhance longevity.\n\nEases Pain\n\nThe ability of laughter to ease pain was first described in 1979 by Norman Cousins in his book As Anatomy of an Illness. Cousins developed ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory disease characterized by chronic back pain that left him confined to bed. As his condition continued to deteriorate, he decided to take his health into his own hands, in part, by using laughter, which is when he began to improve.\n\nMore recent research confirms laughter's positive effects on pain. For instance, in a study involving 40 subjects, researchers found that their pain tolerance was favorably influenced after watching a comedy for 30 minutes, while pain tolerance decreased after viewing a documentary for the same length of time.\n\nProtects Physical Function\n\nIf our physical functionality declines, we can find it harder to do everyday activities such as dressing or bathing ourselves. Laughter appears to reduce the risk of developing functional disabilities, particularly when we laugh regularly and with others (more so than when laughing alone).\n\nStrengthens the Core\n\nA good belly laugh is good for building strength in the trunk, particularly the abdominal muscles, even working the internal obliques more than traditional exercises. Laughing also engages muscles in the diaphragm and shoulders, giving you a good non-exercise workout.\n\nMental Health Benefits of Laughter\n\nLaughter doesn't only benefit us physically but mentally too. Here's how.\n\nLowers Stress\n\nThe American Psychological Association's 2022 Stress in America report reveals that, on a scale of one to 10, most Americans place their stress levels at a five, with more than one in four indicating that their stress is so bad they can't function most days. Laughter helps by decreasing the stress hormone cortisol and reversing the stress response.\n\nImproves Depression\n\nLaughing can also alter levels of neurotransmitters in the body, namely dopamine and serotonin, also increasing the release of endorphins. Together, this help improve depression symptoms.\n\nServes as a Distraction\n\nWhat happens when you laugh? You tend to forget about things that are bothering you. This makes laughter a good way to take the focus off of the challenges you face. It helps distract you, even if just for a moment, giving you a much-needed mental health break.\n\nChanges Our Perspective\n\nWhen we face major tragedies or trauma in our lives, it can affect how we view the world. According to research, humor can make severe events funnier over time. This helps us keep these incidents in perspective while reducing their negative impact on our mental health.\n\nSocial Benefits of Laughter\n\nLaughter also helps us connect with others. Think of times when you've been with friends and laughed so hard that tears rolled down your face. Did this make you feel more connected with your friends? It's likely that your answer is yes.\n\nJust as with smiling and kindness, most people also find that laughter is contagious. So, if you work on laughing more, you can help others laugh more and realize these benefits as well.\n\nHow to Get More Laughter In Your Life\n\nLaughter is a great stress management strategy because it's free, convenient, and beneficial in so many ways. If you want more laughter in your life, these strategies can help.\n\nLaugh With Friends\n\nGoing to a movie or a comedy club with friends is a great way to get more laughter in your life. The contagious effects of laughter may mean you'll laugh more than you otherwise would have during the show. Plus, you'll have jokes to reference at later times.\n\nHaving friends over for a party or game night is also a great setup for laughter and other good feelings. Making time for this kind of fun is as important as any other habit you keep in your life to support your health.\n\nFind Humor in Things\n\nWhen facing life's frustrations, try to laugh about them. If something is so frustrating or depressing it's ridiculous, realize that you could look back on it and laugh later. Think of how it will sound like a story you could tell your friends, and then see if you can laugh about it now.\n\nWith this attitude, you may also find yourself being more lighthearted and silly, giving yourself and those around you more to laugh about. Approach life in a more mirthful way to reduce your stress toward negative events.\n\nFake It Until You Make It\n\nJust as positive effects of smiling occur whether the smile is fake or real, simulated laughter also provides benefits. The body can't tell the difference. Plus, simulated or self-initiated laughter turns into genuine laughter over time.\n\nSo, smile more and fake laughter if you need to at the beginning. You'll still achieve positive effects, and the fake merriment may lead to real smiles and laughter.\n\nEnjoy Humorous Media\n\nThere's no shortage of laughter opportunities from entertainment. You can find humorous media at the theater, as well as at home with movies and comedy sitcoms.\n\nWatching funny movies and TV shows is an easy way to get laughter into your life whenever you need it. Share your favorites with friends and you'll have something to reference and laugh about together.\n\nTakeaways"
