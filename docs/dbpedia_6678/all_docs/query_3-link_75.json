        "text": "Beyond Laughter & Tears is the first-ever documentary to take an in-depth look at the challenges and stories of hope of people living with PseudoBulbar Affect (PBA). PBA, estimated to impact approximately 2 million Americans, is characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing that is often contrary or exaggerated to the patient's inner mood state.\n\nWhile PBA is not a new condition, national awareness is low, with many patients unaware that they suffer from a treatable condition. The film features real-life stories of people coping with PBA, including patients, families and caregivers. Audiences follow their journey as they triumph and live life to its fullest despite the obstacles of the condition. Beyond Laughter & Tears aims to shine a spotlight on PBA and the vast community it impacts, creating a greater awareness of PBA and inspire people who suffer from this condition and their loved ones to seek help."
