        "text": "GagaOOLala will release Taiwanese-Thai musical First Note of Love on August 12.\n\nThe LGBTQ+- and Boys’ Love (BL)-focused streamer collaborated with Warner Music Taiwan and Star Hunter Entertainment on the series, which stars Charles Tu and Michael Chang. Tu starred in HIStory4: Close to You, In My Heart and Love Beside Me, while Chang appeared in My Tooth Your Love and HBO’s Who’s By Your Side.\n\nFirst Note of Love follows Neil (played by Tu), the frontman of the band ‘Magnet,’ who withdraws from the spotlight upon the tragic death of his brother, who also played in the band. This leaves the band’s fans devastated, including a young boy named Sea (played by Chang). Six years later, Sea, who is now a music professional, is unexpectedly invited to work with his childhood idol, who remains haunted by his brother’s death and is struggling with anxiety and stage fright. Together, the two embark on a journey of music and healing.\n\nThe cast also includes Thai actor ‘Jame’ Kasama Kranjanawattana (Gen Y, My Mate Match, Big Dragon) as Orca, an indie Thai musician and a close friend of Neil’s, as well as Taiwanese actor Tim Liu (Guardian, The Lion’s Secret) as Reese, who is Neil’s agent. Most of the 12-episode series were shot in the port city of Kaohsiung, in Taiwan.\n\nThrough GagaOOLala’s partnership with Warner Music Taiwan, the series features an eight-track original album performed by artists under Warner Music Taiwan and Warner Music Thailand, including lead actor Charles Tu.\n\n“We are pleased to partner with GagaOOLala on this exciting project, as it aligns with our commitment to fostering diverse perspectives and artistic expression,” said Mr. Kok-Siew Yeo, Managing Director of Warner Music Taiwan. “We are confident that the series’ timeless narratives, brought to life through compelling storytelling and curated music, will resonate strongly with audiences worldwide. This partnership also reflects our ambition to showcase our artists and music to global communities.”\n\nThe series received funding from the Kaohsiung Film Fund, Video Market and Rakuten TV Japan, Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA), as well as support from the Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development, which is part of Taiwan’s Ministry of Culture.\n\nJay Lin, founder and CEO of GagaOOLala and Portico Media, said: “At GagaOOLala, we are committed to producing high-quality, big-budget Originals like First Note of Love. To achieve this, we need local and global co-production partners to share the risks and rewards of these creative projects. These strategic partnerships are also essential for expanding our distribution beyond GagaOOLala, widening our audience reach, and exploring new opportunities for fan engagement through regional and international BL fan meets that we have in plan for First Note of Love.”\n\nTu said: “Playing Neil has been both an honor and a blessing, allowing me to take on a role where I could truly express my love for music and my passion for the guitar. Through First Note of Love, Michael and I formed a deep bond, helping each other heal and finding the strength to move forward. I hope the audience can appreciate and resonate with the story we’ve brought to life.”\n\nFirst Note of Love director Chien Hung Lin, added: “The filming experience for this BL series has been nothing short of fantastic. With the support from the cast, the production team, the musicians, GagaOOLala and Warner Music Taiwan, I was able to fully convey a story of stunning beauty, tear-jerking laughter and heartwarming love without limits.”\n\nThe first episode of First Note of Love will be available to stream globally on GagaOOLala (excluding Japan), Video Market and Rakuten TV in Japan, LINE TV and FriDAY in Taiwan, Heavenly in South Korea and Rakuten Viki in multiple territories on August 12. A new episode will then be released every week. The first episode of the series will be made available for free on GagaOOLala with English, Mandarin, Thai, Spanish and Bahasa subtitles."
