        "text": "Present Laughter by Noël Coward\n\nThe multi award-winning production of Noël Coward’s provocative comedy featuring Andrew Scott (Vanya, Fleabag) returns to the big screen.\n\nAs he prepares to embark on an overseas tour, star actor Garry Essendine’s colourful life is in danger of spiralling out of control. Engulfed by an escalating identity crisis as his many and various relationships compete for his attention, Garry’s few remaining days at home are a chaotic whirlwind of love, sex, panic and soul-searching.\n\nFilmed live from The Old Vic in London during a sold out run in 2019, Matthew Warchus (Matilda The Musical) directs this giddy and surprisingly modern reflection on fame, desire and loneliness.\n\nThis film has an interval.\n\nFriday 26th July, 7.00pm\n\nTickets: £10.50/£11.00/£12.00\n\nA £1 Poly Fund payment is added to each ticket sold.\n\nPlease note this is a live show that has been recorded and will be shown as a film."
