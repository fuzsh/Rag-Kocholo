        "text": "COVINGTON, Ky. – This weekend there’s an anniversary to celebrate, fresh flowers to arrange, cats to paint, a musical opening, a meteor shower, a family-fun festival, live music, yoga, and more.\n\nLion’s Gate Portal, Perseids … & a flick\n\nWe can only imagine the cool energy that will be looming in the night sky Friday when Covington Parks & Rec hosts its Astronomy Night and Movie Night at Austinburg Park.\n\nFirst of all, today heralds the opening of the Lion’s Gate Portal – that annual astrological event that peaks on Aug. 8 and features the star Sirius, the Orion constellation, and Earth, forming a distinct energetic gateway that is considered a sterling time for manifestation and spiritual growth.\n\nAnd second of all, the Perseids Meteor Shower (aka “shooting stars”) happens this weekend.\n\nMeaning, in addition to catching the flick “Ruby Gillman Teenage Kraken” on the screen, you may well be in for quite a show.\n\nThe annual Perseids meteor shower occurs each year when our home orb plows through a bunch of space rubble left behind by a big ol’ comet called Swift-Tuttle. Some of that debris will be traveling at more than 100,000 miles an hour as it strikes Earth’s atmosphere, creating streaks of light and fireballs.\n\nThere’s a chance that meteors could flash across all parts of the sky at a rate of about one every minute or two, so sit back and let the great universe entertain.\n\nHappy ‘handful’ to The Roost\n\nIt’s been five wonderful years (aka, a “handful”) since The Roost Latonia opened its doors to invite folks in to enjoy fine coffee, gracious hospitality, vintage goods, all kinds of fabulous quirk, tasty cocktails, and an unrivaled community spirit.\n\nWe’re Officially a Handful – The Roost Latonia Celebrates 5 happens Friday and Saturday, because just like you have a birthday weekend or week (maybe a month), The Roost gets to extend its special day too. Go let ‘em know how much you appreciate them.\n\nZinnias, dahlias, tabbies, and torties\n\nCreate your own keepsake of freshly cut, Kentucky-grown florals in an arrangement of your creation, then cuddle with irresistible rescue kittens.\n\nFresh Floral Design Class Plus Kittens at Purrfect Day Cat Café on Saturday features fresh blooms from Laughing Earth Flower Farm in Independence and floral arrangement guidance by Katie.\n\nClass includes complimentary coffee, tea, or soda … flowers for your bouquet … and jars, ribbons, and more to enhance your arrangement.\n\nMake a cat masterpiece\n\nHas there ever been a better time to celebrate felines? Today is International Cat Day, and this weekend you can honor the coolest cats by creating a cat portrait and giving it wall status in your home (or wherever).\n\nArtist Tim Gold will guide you through the process of creating your own Kool Kat masterpiece on Saturday at the Exclusive Kool Kat Art Class at Purple Paisley, Local Artisan Shop.\n\nThe class is suitable for all skill levels – from beginners to seasoned artists – and all necessary materials will be provided for a small fee. Space is limited so be swift like a cat and don’t miss out.\n\nA ‘Beautiful’ musical\n\nCarole King’s 1971 album “Tapestry” was a chart-topping, multiplatinum classic that solidified King as an iconic artist and songwriter, and its timeless tracks put King as the first woman to win multiple Grammy awards in the General Field music category, winning Album of The Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female, as well as Song of the Year and Record of the Year.\n\nThe Brooklyn-born daughter of a piano teacher mother, King was a music prodigy by the time she was 15 years old, and by the time she was 17 she’d penned the music group the Shirelles’ “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,” the first No. 1 song by a Black girl group.\n\nWe could tell you so much more about King, but you’d be better served (and certainly more entertained) by watching her story play out at The Carnegie on Saturday when “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” begins. It runs through Aug. 25.\n\nSunset celebration\n\nSaturday’s Summer Sunset Celebration at Pioneer Park features family-friendly fun by way of a community art project with Art Equals (be sure to bring a 100-percent-cotton tee-shirt), live performances by Legacy Tae Kwon Do and the Twi-Lites, inflatables to play on, a Kenton County Public Library Bookmobile to peruse, food trucks, and free Kona Ice.\n\nBe sure to bring lawn chairs, blankets, and water bottles.\n\nLive music\n\nTonight: Music@BCM Presents Hippie House at Behringer-Crawford Museum … Flaw at Madison Live … Sonny Moorman at Smoke Justis … The Missy Werner Band at Molly Malones Irish Pub & Restaurant … Amy Don’t Mind at Juniper’s.\n\nFriday: Zao at Madison Live … Zoe & The Porktown Hustlers at Juniper’s.\n\nSaturday: Millie Oliver & The Missing Pieces at Madison Live … Lances Boyd & The Last Knights at Juniper’s.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nTonight: Suspended Between Forms Exhibit at The Carnegie … Thirsty Thursday Bingo at Frosthaus … Wine Tasting at Crafts & Vines.\n\nFriday: Suspended Between Forms Exhibit at The Carnegie … Feud at Frosthaus … Karaoke at Frosthaus.\n\nSaturday: Covington Farmers Market at 425 Madison Ave. Parking Lot … MainStrasse Village Food and Culture Tour … Zumba Gold: Dancing to the Oldies at Kenton County Public Library … Suspended Between Forms Exhibit at The Carnegie.\n\nSunday: Yoga + Brunch at Juniper’s … Salsa Sunday in the Taproom at Braxton Brewing Co. … Kitten Yoga with Damon at Purrfect Day Cat Café … Beautiful: The Carole King Musical at The Carnegie\n\n###"
