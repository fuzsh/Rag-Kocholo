Beloved by the British public for her string of hit pre-war films, Gracie Fields's Lancastrian earthiness, impish humour and memorable songs have endeared her to many generations of fans. Love, Life & Laughter sees Gracie starring opposite '30s leading man John Loder in this decidedly working class spin on a Ruritanian romance. It is presented here as a brand-new high definition transfer from original film elements in its original theatrical aspect ratio.

Publican's daughter Nellie catches a handsome stranger's eye whilst impersonating Nell Gwyn at a charity pageant. This is no ordinary admirer, however, but the Crown Prince of Granau - who is so enamoured with Nellie's charms that he's compelled to break off his engagement and desert his fianc√©e.

First released: Monday 23rd March 2020
