September 2024, we will be recording every step of endurance and determination along this 42.195-kilometer adventure in Berlin, with SCC EVENTS GmbH. We are beyond honored to partner up with this iconic event that embodies the values of perseverance, determination, and the pursuit of excellence, which are at the core of NORQAIN‚Äôs DNA. Celebrating the 50th year anniversary of the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON, NORQAIN will be unveiling a limited edition timepiece... Stay tuned. üëÄüî• #NORQAIN #BMWBERLINMARATHON\n\nA few weeks ago, our team travelled to Nepal to visit a project very close to our hearts - the Butterfly Help Project founded by Andrea-Sherpa-Zimmermann and Norbu Sherpa. This non-profit organisation aims to help the children of sherpas who have lost their lives in the Himalayan mountains, providing them with education and shelter. In the village of Lungthung, they witnessed the impact of their collective efforts and projects. üèîÔ∏è 10% of proceeds from all NEVEREST watch sales are donated to the Butterfly Help Project, supporting children‚Äôs qualitative education. With donations from NEVEREST sales, we have been able to help Andrea and Norbu provide quality education to 50 children and built a hostel to accommodate the students close to their school. And the next project is already in the works! ü¶ã #NORQAIN #Adventure #Neverest #ButterflyHelpProject\n\nWe are proud to announce a new strategic partnership with the prestigious BMW BERLIN-MARATHON.
