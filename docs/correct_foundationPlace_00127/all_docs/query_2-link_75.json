        "text": "Message from the Associate Director\n\nIt is my privilege and honor to serve as the first permanent Associate Director of the Healthcare Delivery Research Program within NCI's Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences. I join the program with great enthusiasm for continuing to enhance our data resources, measures, and grant portfolio and for strengthening our relationships with other agencies, organizations, and partners. I am committed to building on the excellent foundation created since the program's 2015 beginnings and I am enormously grateful to my colleague, Ann Geiger, who has served so effectively as HDRP's Acting Associate Director for nearly two years.\n\nBy way of introduction, I joined NCI from Moffitt Cancer Center where I served as Associate Center Director for Population Science, Over the past 30 years, my research has largely focused on patient-centered health outcomes, behavioral aspects of cancer prevention and detection, and supportive care medicine. I have worked closely with the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and other organizations that influence how cancer care is delivered.\n\nI am excited about the opportunity to work at the national level to better understand and improve cancer care delivery. I see this as a rapidly growing field of research and expect HDRP to play a major role in moving the science forward and generating evidence to inform policy.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul Jacobsen\n\nAssociate Director, HDRP\n\nLeadership Changes\n\nAnn Geiger has left her position as Chief of the Healthcare Assessment Research Branch (HARB) and has filled the key leadership position of HDRP Deputy Associate Director (DAD). In this role, Ann will focus on grants and administrative issues across the program, continue to oversee NCORP cancer care delivery research activities, and lead the development of new scientific initiatives.\n\nPaul Doria-Rose has been named the Acting Branch Chief of HARB, succeeding Ann in this role. Paul will join the HDRP Leadership Team and provide scientific direction and administrative oversight for the branch. He will also continue to be the scientific lead of the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) and Cancer Research Network (CRN) initiatives.\n\nSpotlight on… Symptom Management\n\nThe Cancer Moonshot's Blue Ribbon Panel, comprised of scientific experts, cancer leaders, and patient advocates, released a report (PDF) this fall that identified a set of 10 research recommendations poised for a decade's worth of progress in just 5 short years. One of the recommendations in which HDRP staff are taking a lead role to develop a response is Recommendation F: Symptom Management Research (PDF) . The recommendation aims to:\n\nAccelerate adoption of technology-aided systems that monitor patient-reported symptoms and provide actionable decision support approaches utilizing evidence-based cancer guidelines to treat symptoms throughout the cancer continuum.\n\nHDRP will be coordinating a response to this recommendation that will focus on symptom management in the context of cancer care. Dr. Paul Jacobsen, HDRP Associate Director, will be leading this effort in collaboration with the Division of Cancer Prevention, which will be focusing on a parallel effort to assess the mechanisms of symptom management.\n\nAs a first step, we are interested in hearing from the extramural research community and others regarding knowledge gaps and priorities for symptom management research. To do so, we will be holding webinars in late January and early February to obtain input. Comments from these webinars will help to inform planning and directions for future funding announcements. A separate webinar is being scheduled to obtain input from the patient advocacy community.\n\nHDRP staff are also collaborating on responses to Blue Ribbon Panel recommendations on colorectal cancer screening and Lynch syndrome. More information about new initiatives that stem from these recommendations will be shared when available.\n\nWorking for You…\n\nProviding New Data: SEER-CAHPS Linkage\n\nSEER-CAHPS, a unique, patient-centered health services and quality care data resource is now available. SEER-CAHPS links data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries with data from the Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS®) patient surveys. The data resource includes:\n\nMedicare CAHPS data from surveys collected in 1998-2013 to assess patient experiences of multiple aspects of their care (e.g. access to needed and timely care, doctor communication, global ratings of doctors, specialists, overall care and health/prescription drug plan).\n\nSEER registry data (1973-2011 diagnosis) on cancer site, stage, treatment, death, sociodemographics.\n\nLongitudinal Medicare claims data (2002-2013) on utilization and costs of care for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nMore information about the linkage, including in-depth descriptions of the data and data files, the process for obtaining the data, privacy and confidentiality considerations, SAS programs, and frequently asked questions, can be found on the SEER-CAHPS website.\n\nUpdating Existing Data: SEER-Medicare\n\nSEER-Medicare reflects the linkage of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program of cancer registries, which collects clinical, demographic and cause of death information for persons with cancer, and the Medicare claims for covered health care services from the time of a person's Medicare eligibility until death. In early December, the updates to the SEER-Medicare data were completed. The data now include cancer cases diagnosed from 1991-2013 and their associated claims from 1991-2014, reflecting over 2 million patients. A more detailed breakdown of patients by cancer site and diagnosis year is provided on the SEER-Medicare website. Requests to use the new data are being accepted.\n\nFostering Emerging Areas of Research: Employment Outcomes among Cancer Survivors\n\nHDRP is conducting a number of activities in service of building a research program in informal cancer caregiving. Two notice of funding opportunities (NOFOs) were released in 2016 and can be found on our cancer caregiving web page along with several reports that explore experiences of informal cancer caregivers in providing care or assistance to family members or friends with cancer. HDRP's work in this area aims to improve the characterization of informal caregivers and the care they manage; accelerate the development and standardization of measures and metrics for cancer caregiving; promote development and testing of interventions aimed at improving outcomes for patients and caregivers; and facilitate the creation of tools to better integrate cancer caregivers into healthcare delivery.\n\nFostering Emerging Areas of Research: Human System Integration in Cancer Care\n\nOn October 20-21, 2016, HDRP and the Behavioral Research Program co-hosted a workshop, Human System Integration in Cancer Care. The goal of this meeting was to create a research agenda focused on leveraging the enhanced capacities of an informatics-infused healthcare delivery system to create better cognitive and systemic support for care teams and their patients. Participants reviewed a set of preliminary materials ahead of the meeting, which were then synthesized and used to discuss possible strategies forward and ideas for a research agenda. One outcome of the meeting was a recognition that a Human Systems Integration approach should be woven into the design of both the technologies and health services that must be synchronized to improve patient outcomes. As a next step, the organizing committee will be meeting with selected leaders from both the private and public spheres on March 28, 2017 in San Diego, CA to investigate the feasibility of enabling a public-private partnership focused on addressing critical issues of oncology care as identified by the President's Cancer Panel report on \"Improving Cancer-Related Outcomes with Connected Health\" .\n\nPublishing Research: JOP Special Series on NCI-ASCO Teams\n\nThe November Issue of the Journal of Oncology Practice features 19 original manuscripts and four editorials that address ways to enhance team-based oncology care. The series is the culmination of a project launched in 2014 by the National Cancer Institute and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) . Manuscripts were written by interdisciplinary groups of authors that included clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates. The manuscripts discuss both real and hypothetical case studies, models of care, and the value of teams in care. For more information, visit our healthcare teams web page.\n\nEnhancing Training in Healthcare Delivery: Improving Investigator Capacity Workshop\n\nThe Improving Investigator Capacity to Conduct Research in Healthcare Delivery Settings Workshop was held on December 14-15, 2016 and focused on exploring the knowledge, skills, and behaviors for scientists to successfully conduct practice-integrated research. Attendees collaborated to discuss formal and informal approaches to prepare scientists at all career stages to conduct research grounded in the reality of care delivery. Information provided from this workshop will guide next steps in establishing the need for training activities, define approaches likely to meet these needs, articulating NCI's role and establishing partnerships for training efforts.\n\nLooking Ahead…\n\nForging New Collaborations: NCI and Genentech Collaborate on PRO-CTCAE Translations\n\nHDRP has led a trans-NCI effort to develop a patient-reported measurement system to assess symptomatic toxicity in cancer patients enrolled in cancer clinical trials, the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE™). Access to the instrument and related information is available on the PRO-CTCAE web page.\n\nAdditionally, NCI and Genentech have reached an agreement to make more language translations of PRO-CTCAE publicly available by December 2017. This agreement represents a substantial financial investment by Genentech, and the partnership between NCI and Genentech will further accelerate the implementation of PRO-CTCAE in both industry-sponsored and NCI-sponsored cancer clinical trials. New languages being produced and linguistically validated include Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Czech, French and Chinese. The scope of the collaborative work will also allow us to confirm the universality of the English, Spanish, Italian, and German language versions (and some of the newly developed languages such as French) in countries where a sample of the population speaks that language (e.g., Italian language in Switzerland, French language in Canada). By early 2018 it is anticipated that PRO-CTCAE will be available in more than 20 languages.\n\nBuilding Partnerships: NCI - AcademyHealth Healthcare Delivery Research Scholar Program\n\nHDRP is working with AcademyHealth to develop an opportunity for two mid-career scientists to spend a portion of their time conducing care delivery research within HDRP using NCI resources and collaborating with staff scientists. More information about this program, including the application process, will be available in January.\n\nRedesigning Data Collection: National Health Interview Survey Cancer Control Supplement\n\nThe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Cancer Control Supplement (CCS) is used to track cancer screening and prevention behaviors such as tobacco use, diet, physical activity, and genetic counseling. HDRP, in collaboration with colleagues across DCCPS and CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, has historically fielded a 20-minute CCS every five years and 5-minute survey at midpoint years. Starting in 2018, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) will unveil and filed a newly redesigned NHIS. Based on this redesign, the CCS will be modified to an annual 5-minute supplement with rotating content. The first 5-minute CCS will be fielded in 2018 and will focus on cancer screening. More information about the NCHS redesign can be found here .\n\nNew Funding Opportunities\n\nSeveral new notice of funding opportunities (NOFOs) with relevance to healthcare delivery research are mentioned below. For a full list of open announcements across the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, please visit the DCCPS Funding Opportunities page . Be sure to also look for funding opportunities available across NCI that may be applicable to your areas of research.\n\nPopulation-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process (PROSPR) Research Centers (UM1 )\n\nThe overall goal for PROSPR Research Centers is to enhance understanding of the implementation and effects of screening as practiced in multiple, heterogeneous healthcare environments in the U.S. This NOFO will support one PROSPR Research Center for each of the three cancer types: cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer.\n\nCoordinating Center for Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process (PROSPR) (U24 )\n\nThis NOFO will fund a single Coordinating Center that will support a network of three PROSPR Research Centers. The Coordinating Center will facilitate the development of common measures across cancer types for (1) system-level factors that may impact the cancer screening process, and (2) quality of screening. It will also coordinate PROSPR network research projects that include more than one cancer type and will develop and implement a process for data access and sharing.\n\nOral Anticancer Agents: Utilization, Adherence, and Health Care Delivery (R01 /R21 )\n\nThe purpose of this NOFO is to encourage research grant applications to: (1) assess and describe the current state of oral anticancer medication utilization, delivery, and adherence; (2) identify structural, systemic, and psychosocial barriers to adherence; and (3) develop models and strategies to improve safe and effective delivery of these agents so that clinical outcomes are optimized.\n\nPalliative Care Needs of Individuals with Rare Advanced Diseases and Their Family Caregivers (R01 /R21 )\n\nThis NOFO seeks to expand knowledge and increase the evidence base for palliative care in advanced rare diseases, including rare cancers, and to improve physical and psychosocial well-being and quality of life among seriously ill individuals and their family caregivers.\n\nReducing Overscreening for Breast, Cervical, and Colorectal Cancers among Older Adults (R01 /R21 )\n\nThe purpose of this NOFO is to promote research on interventions, based in healthcare settings, designed to reduce overscreening for breast, cervical, or colorectal cancers among average-risk older adults.\n\nCurrent Openings\n\nScientific Lead, NCI Community Oncology Research Program - Cancer Care Delivery Research\n\nHDRP is conducting a national search for a Scientific Lead to direct Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) within the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). The CCDR Scientific Lead will facilitate a new and innovative program of research by prioritizing and guiding all scientific CCDR activities within NCORP.\n\nNew Staff\n\nMelanie Baker\n\nMelanie is a Cancer Research Training Award (CRTA) fellow in the Healthcare Assessment Research Branch. Melanie will be working on several activities within the branch, including projects related to patterns of care. Prior to joining HARB, Melanie was a summer intern in the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch and worked on tracking, analyzing and summarizing NOFOs.\n\nRiante Jones\n\nRiante is a Program Support Assistant in HDRP and provides administrative support to the Office of the Associate Director. Before joining HDRP, Riante worked in the Behavioral Research Program within DCCPS and in the Division of Cancer Prevention. Riante has a bachelor's degree in communication and a master's degree in integrated marketing communication.\n\nMichelle Mollica\n\nMichelle is a Program Director in the Outcomes Research Branch or HDRP. Prior to joining HDRP, she was a Cancer Prevention Fellow and worked on a number of projects with the SEER-CAHPS linked data resource and the Cancer Care Outcomes Research & Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) Caregivers Study. Michelle is interested in issues related to cancer survivorship and explores the intersection of survivorship and healthcare delivery, including patient experiences, quality of care, informal cancer caregiving, and follow-up care. Her research interests also include the transition into post-treatment survivorship, spirituality, and quality of life. Michell has a background in mixed methods research and community-engaged research, and has extensive experience conducting qualitative research and intervention development in underserved populations.\n\nMaria Rincon, MPH\n\nMaria is a Health Communication intern working under the mentorship of Dr. Erin Kent.
