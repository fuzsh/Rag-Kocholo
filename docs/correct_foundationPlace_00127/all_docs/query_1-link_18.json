        "text": "In this paper I should like to offer a new reading of OK private scenes of funeral processions, as well as a new understanding of the introduction of Isis and Nephthys into Ancient Egyptian religious thought. It appears that scenes of funeral processions in private tombs emerged simultaneously with Osiris’ first appearances in private burials. Moreover, it seems that detailed descriptions of the private funerals are an expression of covert identification of the non-royal dead with Osiris. ‘The Two Kites’ were part of the official personnel in private funerals. Through an analysis of funeral scenes on the one hand, and the appearance of Isis and Nephthys as ‘The Two Kites’ in PT on the other hand, I shall delineate the ways in which the religion, that evolved around the figure of Osiris, appropriated old features of non-royal religious practices, in order to secure the implementation of its new ideas. The identification of Isis and Nephthys with ‘The Two Kites’ reflects a process that took place at the end of the 5th Dynasty and through the 6th Dynasty. Their role of ‘The Two Kites’ or ‘The Kite’ and ‘The Screecher’ in the PT, was therefore closely related to the ceremonial funerary role of mourning women, which was embedded in OK non-royal funerary traditions, and echoed in OK funerary art.\n\nThe paper discusses a recently discovered painting from the rock cut tomb of Perseneb at Giza (GE 20-22). Described by Lepsius (LG 78) and Mariette, the tomb has been sporadically referred to in Egyptological publications mainly because of an unusual number of rock cut statues prepared for the owner. A routine architectural and epigraphic survey of the tomb brought to light a new important feature of its decoration – fragments of a polychrome painting over a thin layer of white plaster covered with a thick layer of the 19th century soot. The remaining colors made it possible to reconstruct the original composition of the painting characterized by a rare combination of standard scenes (a marsh scene, agricultural scenes, a naval scene, figures of the owner and his wife). A careful study of the remaining iconographic features made it possible to date the painting to the second half of the Fifth Dynasty. The tomb of Perseneb presents a rare example of a painted rock cut chapel for almost all other paintings on plaster known from Giza chapels, except for those in the tomb of Mersyankh III, come from contemporary mastabas.\n\nMiddle Kingdom royal statues frequently exhibit physical evidence that attests to their renewed integration into later contexts within the two millennia of pharaonic culture that followed their creation. Reuse is a pervasive phenomenon in ancient Egypt, and the particular character of any reuse is certainly inflected by both period attitudes and locale— that is, by what is available for a given location. From a modern vantage point, the two are difficult to disentangle. The site of Tanis in the Nile Delta offers something of an exception: an opportunity to take an unusually clear sounding of many of the circumstances around reuse in its region through at least the Third Intermediate Period."
