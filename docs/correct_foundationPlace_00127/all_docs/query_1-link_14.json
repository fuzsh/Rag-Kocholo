The materials examined there are mainly the literary sources: state documents, travel books, missionary letters and reports, histories, memoirs, and maps. In addition to an analysis of the written records, Volume I also contains an account of spices and other Asian commodities sent to Europe. I purposely did not attempt in Volume I a systematic study of the responses within _ Europe to the vast new body of information about Asia, a massive and complicated undertaking in itself. That task with all its complexities was left for this\n\nvolume. |\n\nThe present volume, A Century of Wonder, refers to the most general response of sixteenth-century Europe to the revelation of the East. This particular book,\n\nThe Visual Arts, is a study of the impact of what I have termed the “‘silent sources” —art objects, artifacts, flora, fauna, and crafts—upon the arts of Europe\n\nfrom the period of the High Renaissance to the Baroque. This book helps to fill the gap that exists between the Middle Ages and the seventeenth century in our understanding of the influences exerted by Asia upon European art. But the topics included here constitute only one aspect of Asia’s total influence upon Europe. In the second book of this volume, I will discuss the impact of Asia upon the letters, ideas, and institutions of sixteenth-century Europe. As readers will see in the details set forth in the following chapters, it is possible to assert that Asia had distinct appeal and influence despite Europe's traditional hostility to alien infiltration. Artists experimented with Asian products and design ideas quite deliberately and incorporated them into their own works. The ways in which the Europeans of the sixteenth century used Asia\n\n[xi\n\nPreface\n\nartistically are not always obvious at first glance, probably because we do not see with the eyes of contemporaries. What looked like a symbol of Asia to the sixteenth-century connoisseur might well look to us like a meaningless portrait or even a decadent Manneristic aberration. That we have continued to believe for a long time that Asia exercised no noteworthy influence on modern European art until the eighteenth century is attributable, in my estimation, to a lack of serious research on earlier periods and to our inability to comprehend what it was about Asia that appealed to European artists and craftsmen of the late\n\nRenaissance. It is hoped that this book will, among other things, stimulate specialists in the visual arts to examine more closely the interchanges between Europe and Asia and will encourage general students of diffusion to look for concrete evidence of influence instead of relying exclusively upon stylistic similarities or making unsubstantiated assertions about common attributes and spiritual affinities. In undertaking the preparation of this book on the visual arts, I was well aware that I would be engaging in an enterprise that had never before been investigated thoroughly. I also knew that my own background and credentials for embarking on such a pioneering effort were hardly adequate to the task. As a consequence,\n\nI set out blithely, as amateurs incline to do, to prepare myself as best I could to undertake this study. In the process, I have received such warm and hearty support from others that I finally became pleased with my own brashness. I have received unstinting cooperation from the art historians of the Uni-\n\nversity of Chicago. On the street, at lunch, and in the corridors they have patiently answered my naive questions. They have even shared my excitement of discovery. Reverend Harrie van der Stappen, S.V.D., a specialist in East Asian art, was particularly helpful in aiding me to identify Philips van Winghe’s drawings of Azuchi Castle. Edward A. Maser, who has been working for a number of years on the Habsburg art collections, lent me every possible aid, including a reading of my chapter on collections. Bertha H. Wiles, now retired, gave me the benefit of her vast knowledge in the graphic arts. Pramod Chandra\n\nkindly talked with me about Indian art, informed me about the history of Kutiihala (composite paintings), and obtained a copy of one of them for me from the National Museum of India in New Delhi. Herbert L. Kessler, who has one\n\nfoot in Byzantium and the other in sixteenth-century Europe, read the entire manuscript and gave me hours of informal instruction in art history. Francis H. Dowley, who has unselfishly shared my enthusiasms for more.years than we both like to think about, also read and improved the manuscript. As if this were not enough, I received helpful tips from Professors Phyllis Bober of New York University and Charles Mitchell of Bryn Mawr. My education was also advanced significantly by the Rockefeller Foundation. In the academic year 1967-68 its officers presented me with an opportunity to\n\nteach at the University of Delhi. Their generosity in permitting me, in the course of performing this assignment, to travel in India from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, to visit Ceylon, and to make a leisurely trip around the world\n\n[xiv]\n\nPreface\n\ngave me the opportunity to renew my acquaintance with both Asia and Europe\n\nand to become deeply involved for the first time in the rich and puzzling civilization of India.\n\nWhen I decided to publish a section from this book as a “trial balloon,” Professor Denis Sinor of the University of Indiana freely opened to me the pages\n\nof the Journal of Asian History, which he edits. Consequently, the section of chapter iii dealing with the elephant first appeared in the JAH in 1967 (Vol. I, No. 2, pp. 133-76) under the title “Asian Elephants in Renaissance Europe.” Because Professor Sinor generously published sixteen plates along with my article, I have been able to omit some from the collection published in this work.\n\nBy substituting others, I have had the opportunity to extend my pictorial documentation of the elephant. Nor can I forgo mentioning that Mrs. Irene Sinor shared her husband’s enthusiasm for my elephants, tracked down a rhinoceros for me in Naples, and drew to my attention the charming story of Wenzel Hollar and his elephant by Johannes Urzidel. Librarians and museum experts likewise lightened my task. Always at hand were the vast resources of the University of Chicago libraries, the Art Institute\n\nof Chicago, and the Newberry Library. Robert Rosenthal, chief of the University of Chicago’s Department of Special Collections, regularly called to my attention items from his rare books. Helen Smith, as she has for many years, assiduously filled my orders for interlibrary exchange requests. Mrs Emma B. Pitcher helped me to identify birds and other fauna in my illustrations. From research funds granted me by the Social Science Research Committee, the Committee on Far Eastern Studies, and the Committee on South Asia (all of the University of Chicago) I was able to hire graduate students in history\n\nto assist me. Amy Gordon, Kathleen Stark, Eric Stevens, and Sara Bobroft helped me during the stages of research and writing. Sister Michaela Zahner, C.S.J., labored long and hard as we saw the book through the press together. For the past five years my wife has acted as my personal photographer. Our joint venture in scholarship began in 1965 on a three-month tour of Italy where we hunted artistic elephants and other exotica with her cameras. In India, and in all the other countries we visited on our world tour, she had more enthusiasm for shooting pictures for my project than I did myself. At home she spent countless hours taking and retaking the photographs which illustrate this book. While her photographic skills made this extensive illustration program possible, it was her verve and devotion which made the preparation of the book a delight. Admittedly my venture into what might be called art history is a tour de force. For mistakes of fact and interpretation I take personal responsibility. But I do ask forbearance and compassion from those whose professional competence far exceeds my slight attainments in this complicated field.\n\n[xv]\n\nBLANK PAGE ,\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nPermissions to reproduce photographs were courteously granted to us by the following copyright holders: Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 38, 135, 137); Editions Gallimard, Paris (47); André de Rache, Brussels (11, 40); Alfieri, Edizione d’arte, Venice (34, 100); Gabinetto disegni e stampe degli Uffizi, Florence (36); R.

Writers of the sixteenth century described the curiosities and singularities of the\n\noutside world as beguiling, perplexing, and stupefying. Artists as well as collectors of oddities were awestruck by the alien works of nature and man that\n\nappeared to be fearfully and wonderfully made. Fear, strange as it now seems, | struggled with admiration and curiosity in the perception and comprehension of marvels that were inexplicable in traditional European terms. Only the boldest spirits were prepared to admit their own perplexity and uncertainty about the meaning of the revelation of America and the East for European civilization. Others who were inclined to look to the supernatural for the explanation of baffling problems surely sighed with the Psalmist: “Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people” (Psalm 77:14). Stupefaction, bewilderment, and anxiety arrested reactions for a time. A pause was required for a more complete assessment of the revelations and for contemplation of their ultimate implications. But while wonder mixed with fear produced hesitation, it did not beget apathy or inertia. Men in all walks of life from the humble potter to eminent divines and philosophers were inspired with a desire to learn in more detail about the high civilizations of Asia and their spiritual and material works. Those aspects which could be comprehended most readily by Europeans both in Asia and Europe were naturally the surface and concrete manifestations of Asian civilization. The doctrines of Asia’s great religious and philosophical systems were obviously beyond the abilities of the merchant in the field to understand. The missionaries with their strong Christian bias were initially determined to dismiss Asian beliefs and material works as heathen superstitions and vanities. In Europe the Humanists were inclined to\n\n, [3]\n\nIntroduction\n\nregard as barbarous all that was not classical and European. Some artists of the Renaissance were likewise disposed to belittle what they saw of Asian arts by categorizing them as works of talented craftsmen. But, despite the convinced ethnocentrism of Europe’s artists and intellectuals, the reality of Asia could not forever be ignored or dismissed disparagingly. In the course of the sixteenth century, artists, writers, and scholars were required to make room in their works and thoughts for the encroaching civilizations of the East. The accommodation of Europe to the actuality and permanence of Asia as a part of its own world came slowly and falteringly. Asia, unlike America, had had interchanges with Europe that stretched back in time before the beginnings of recorded history. In Antiquity and the Middle Ages, flora, fauna, and portable goods from Asia were brought into Europe at irregular intervals. Such imports were generally associated with a vague outer world of barbarians and enemies of civilization. Periodic invasions of the Christian West by infidel Muslims, pagan Mongols, and terrible Turks contributed to Europe’s fear of and antipathy to the East. Alexandria, known in the eighth and ninth centuries as “the market of the two worlds,” was the place where most of the business of Eurasia was\n\ntransacted in the Middle Ages. But even here there was no firm knowledge about the exact places from which the products of Asia came, for pepper and other spices were vaguely called “grains of paradisé” until the sixteenth century. The Crusades had the effect of opening the Near East to Europeans, as, in its commercial relations with the Levant, Europe moved from a debtor to a cred-\n\nitor status during the twelfth century. The returning Crusaders also brought goods and stories from Asia to the hinterlands of Europe where such things had only rarely been known before. In the era of the Mongol peace (1240-1350) relations between Europe and China by the overland route were closer than they had ever been. China was brought psychologically nearer than India, which remained fabulous to Europe until the era of the great discoveries. From the middle of the fourteenth century to about 1500 the European view of Asia was again cut off by lack of intercourse, and just at a time when Europe itself was recovering its own classical past and becoming more convinced than ever before of the supreme value of Western civilization. Europe's preoccupation with itself continued well into the sixteenth century,\n\nits energies consumed by international wars, the development of national states, and religious divisions. The discovery of America also diverted Europe’s\n\nattention from Asia, for the New World had been totally unknown and its products were initially of greater novelty. In contrast to Asia, America was easily\n\npenetrated by European arms, religion, and civilization. America posed no threat, real or imaginary, as Asia did to Europe. So, at first, there was greater receptivity to and interest in America, perhaps promoted by the fact that Charles\n\nV, who ruled the Spanish conquests in the New World, was also the Holy Roman Emperor, the most powerful of Europe’s kings and its protector against the Turkish incursions from the east. The “policy of secrecy” (see Vol. I, pp. 151-54) followed by Portugal about its progress in the East also had the\n\n[4]\n\nIntroduction\n\neffect until the middle of the sixteenth century of keeping solid information about Asia from circulating freely in Europe. But despite all such obstacles, knowledge of the discoveries in the East increased and the boundaries of European civilization had periodically to be stretched and adjusted to make room for Asia’s products, arts, and ideas.\n\nNot all the information about Asia was to be found in official declarations, travel accounts, or missionary letters and histories. The steady influx into sixteenth-century Europe of the spices, flora, fauna, and portable arts and crafts of Asia brought concrete examples, in quantities and varieties not known before, to the attention of Europeans in all walks of life. Even in the Middle Ages, the\n\nChinese had been recognized as gifted craftsmen. With the opening of direct maritime access to India, its artisans and artists were likewise acknowledged ever more frequently to be skilled, versatile, and sophisticated. The Europeans who lived and worked in the East reported admiringly on the architectural and sculptural monuments of tropical Asia, esteemed its cities to be greater and wealthier than many of Europe’s proudest urban centers, and relayed to the folks back home, either orally or in writing, a few of the traditions and legends they heard in the Orient. The Jesuits in the field were to conclude by the last generation of the sixteenth century that Europe had much to learn from the high civilizations of Asia. Since the publication of Volume I of Asia in the Making of Europe (1965), I\n\nhave been struggling with the methodological problem of how best to study and present the impact of Asia upon Europe in the sixteenth century. Some of the reviewers of Volume I rightly predicted that I would have difficulty in showing concretely how the revelation of the East moved Westerners to begin “self-consciously to question their own cultural premises... and to initiate fundamental revisions in their own views of the world, man, and the future” (p. 835). In what follows I shall try to relate how I am attacking, for this volume, what is admittedly a complex and crucial problem. Tracers of influence must carefully judge and determine which paths to follow to their goals. Pioneers in this kind of intellectual exploration find that certain trails are cold, that others are overly circuitous or complex, and that but few give direct and easy access. In most instances some false starts may be made before\n\nthe explorer finds marks or remains which encourage him to take one path rather than the other or to follow a trail that others have assured him leads nowhere. Even after the searcher surveys a few vistas of the past which others have not seen from his peculiar angle, he must contemplate the entire perspective to determine whether his own view is a mirage, distortion, or delusion. Once satisfied about the reality of his perception, the observer.of influence must rule out other possible sources, evaluate his own perspective in relation to others, and ask himself whether a causal relationship is possible on the basis of the known facts. And, even after exercising all such precautions, he and his reader must fully realize that the vision is partial, the inferences biased, and the demon-\n\nstrations hazardous. But the undertaking is justified even though it provides\n\nLs]\n\nIntroduction\n\nnothing more than a new angle from which to look upon an old scene or a new series of partial explanations of what spurred men on to do what they did. In choosing trails I started, somewhat naively perhaps, to follow one that was most obvious and clearly marked. Of the many strange products, objects, and devices imported into Europe from Asia, I asked myself: What were they? Who received them? What questions did they provoke? How did artisans and artists in Europe see them? Were the more numerous objects of greater influence than those which were known only. as samples? It was through asking myself such a series of simple questions that I decided to commence my study of the impact of Asia upon Europe with the visual arts. Other considerations also entered into this decision. First, I suffered from a sense of guilt that, in Volume I, I had relied, as conventional historians usually do, too heavily on literary sources. From references in the literary sources I was\n\ncertain that oral reports had constituted a vital source of information and inspiration. I was likewise convinced that objects imported from Asia had made a significant impression upon Europeans. These “silent sources’ —art objects, artifacts, flora, fauna, and crafts—obviously needed investigation. Although they were much harder to exploit and control than the literary sources, they might\n\nprovide answers to a number of vital questions not dealt with in the literary sources. It is perfectly clear that literary luminaries such as Rabelais, Montaigne,\n\nand Bodin were moved intellectually by the import and meaning of the discoveries. Natural scientists, geographers, and churchmen were likewise forced to respond, either negatively or positively, to the revelation of Eastern products, places, peoples, and religions. But what evidence, for example, was there of how\n\nthe populace at large reacted to the strange new items from Asia? And what about their influence, if any, on artists and artisans? In this context, sixteenthcentury European art works were clearly an unknown quantity to me and to others. The adoption of motifs from Asia by European craftsmen has a long and re-\n\nvered history. Medieval architects and illuminators of manuscript books had been influenced in their designs by the exotic flora and fauna of the East. Later artists, especially in the eighteenth century, were fascinated by China and produced a vast number of chinoiseries in all facets of art. But what about the great artistic masters of the late Renaissance? Were they so imbued with the artistic prototypes of Antiquity and their own spectacular achievements that they were totally oblivious to the opening of the overseas world? I was seriously assured by many whom I talked to, or whose books I read, that this was indeed true of the\n\nartists. Rationally I found this conclusion hard to accept and so I began a few preliminary investigations. At first there were many false starts and the path was rocky and the trail unclear. But gradually as I pushed aside the tangled underbrush I began to see a clearing in the distance. Whether the clearing that I found\n\nis a mirage, distortion, or delusion will be decided by others. |\n\n[6]\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nCollections of Curiosities In the long centuries before the opening of the direct passage to India, learned men certainly looked studiously and wonderingly at the isolated specimens of Asia’s arts and crafts which found their way to Europe. And they were generally left to infer for themselves whatever they could about the peoples and civilizations which produced these strange items. During the sixteenth century the steady influx in quantity of exotica from Asia stimulated a more generalized and deeper curiosity about what were indiscriminately called “Indian products.” No longer\n\ncontent merely to observe in puzzlement what came to them from afar, European intellectuals and creative artists began self-consciously and systematically to seek solid information about the East and its products. At first the insights to be obtained through men who had been in the field\n\nwere disappointingly few and generally unsatisfying to trained and inquisitive , minds. Humanists, scientists, and artists often reproached the itinerant merchant or returned navigator with having failed to make the most of an opportunity to\n\nobserve the strange physical and cultural features of the Asian scene. Pierre Belon (1517-64), the French naturalist, specifically complained: Those persons who undertake a distant voyage in foreign parts for a particular purpose are usually inclined to seek out those things necessary to bring about a resolution of their own affairs, rather than to use their time making other observations for which they have no understanding: as so clearly appears in the dealings of a merchant who, no matter how often he has traveled to India and the newly found lands, has nonetheless no other object than to get his money’s worth by buying goods and is not concerned to become acquainted with the countless singularities that a curious man [un homme curieux|] would readily be able to observe.! 1 Les observations de plusieurs singularitez et choses mémorables, trouvées en Gréce, Asie, Indée, Egypte,\n\nArabie et autres pays estrangés (Paris, 1554), p. iv. For a detailed survey of the word “curiosity’”’ in various European languages see D. Murray, Museums: Their History and Their Use (Glasgow, 1904), I, 187, n. I.\n\n[7]\n\nCollections of Curiosities\n\nMen of curiosity in all walks of life, as they became increasingly impatient with and distrustful of the superficial observations of travelers and merchants, urged the people in the field to send back specimens of the things that were to be found in Asia. Even though every fleet that returned to Lisbon carried new items to stimulate the imagination of the learned and artistic, the demand for more “curiosities” intensified as the century wore on. Along with requests for\n\nrare objects there went entreaties for more acute observation of the Asian environment itself and of the way life was lived there. To help provide the curious with reliable information, amateur artists sent back drawings or paintings of what they saw on their daily rounds of the marts of Asia.3 Learned Jesuits wrote about and speculated on the meaning and symbolism of the religious statues and temples of Hinduism and Buddhism. Cartographers in Asia and Europe prepared routiers, artistic maps, and terrestrial globes which helped both amateurs and scholars to associate products with places, to gain a sense of the magnitude of Asia, and to acquire an elementary appreciation of the great diversity of its peoples and their achievements. Cosmographers and travel writers gathered details about the jewels, textiles, flora, and fauna of the East which opened new business and intellectual vistas. And, even as the hunger of the curious was being appeased by new products and information, the appetite for collecting the wonders of the outside world constantly grew. Royal connoisseurs, wealthy merchant princes, bourgeois businessmen, and eminent scholars competed to acquire samples of Eastern natural products, arts, and crafts. Agents were hired and friends badgered as the collectors began to acquire a taste for assembling cabinets or chambers of curiosities. The representatives of the great commercial houses sent curiosities as gifts to their employers, friends, business acquaintances, and rulers with a passion for collecting. Gerhard Mercator (1512-94) and Abraham Ortelius (1529-98), the cartographers, exchanged geographical information and books. Charles de L’écluse (1526-\n\n1609) the famous botanist, received botanical specimens from his Spanish colleague, Benito Arias Montano (1527-98). The rulers of Europe, like Oriental potentates, sent gifts of exotic animals, jewels, porcelains, and trinkets to one another. Collectors frequently complained that the Portuguese insisted upon keeping information on Asia to themselves and were sometimes deliberately misleading in what they did report.5 The collectors’ spirit was not born in the sixteenth century, but it did receive a new stimulus and a change of emphasis as a result of the overseas discoveries.® 2 F, de Sousa Viterbo, “O orientalismo portugues no século XVI,” Boletim da Sociedade de geographia de Lisboa, XII (1892-93), Nos. 7-8, p. 317.\n\n3 See below, pp. 64-67 and pls. 24-28. .\n\n4 On the collection and interest in globes as concrete models of the earth see F. de Dainville, “Les amateurs de globes,” Gazette des Beaux-Arts, LX XI (1968), 51-64. 5 For example, see the letter of Guillaume Postel to Abraham Ortelius (April 9, 1567) as reproduced in J.

Taylor, The Taste of Angels: A History of Art Collecting from Rameses to Napoleon (Boston, 1948).\n\n[8]\n\nCollections of Curiosities King Solomon and the rulers of ancient Babylon had collected precious objects\n\nfrom Asia for their treasure houses. The patricians of Greece, Rome, and Byzantium prided themselves on their collections of animals and objets d’art from distant places. In medieval Europe the treasury of the cathedral and the strong room of the castle housed precious and curious objects ranging from Chinese textiles to ostrich eggs. Oddities were stored in medieval treasuries for their material and talismanic values and were not ordinarily on display.7 The doges of Venice were among the first to exhibit in public the exotic objects which they received as gifts from the princes of the Levant or acquired by pillage or purchase in the Near East. Beginning in the middle of the fifteenth\n\ncentury a “fever” broke out in Rome and its environs for uncovering and collecting ancient works of art, inscriptions, cameos, and coins.? Finally, the sixteenth century saw the appearance of the cabinet or chamber of wonders (Wunderkammer) in which collections of ethnographical specimens, minerals, flora, and fauna were placed on display side by side with some of the best examples of cinquecento European painting or artistic craftsmanship. What made the collections of the Wunderkammer distinctive was the emphasis they placed upon the systematic assembling of contemporary rather than ancient arts and crafts, of unusual specimens from the world of natural history, and of curiosities from the newly found lands.1° But what do we know about the availability in Europe of Asian items that were potentially of interest to artists, scientists, and collectors? Even a cursory survey of the cargoes, custom records, ambassadorial reports, company papers, diaries, and personal correspondence of those involved in overseas trade with Asia readily yields information about the many kinds of Asian imports which actually found their way through Lisbon and Venice to the other marts of Europe (see Appendix, p. 55). But not all the imports can be found listed in the extant\n\ncargo tallies or in the reports of the customhouses, It must be assumed that many items, particularly small and valuable commodities like jewels and personal curios, were brought or sent back by individual sailors as part of their own share\n\nof the cargo or were smuggled into the country. Other items were sent as gifts to the rulers of Europe by native kings in the east or by Portuguese officials in the field who were trying to keep their fences mended at home. Individuals also brought home gifts for families and friends, as well as souvenirs for themselves and the collectors of curiosa. 7 A.

Gifts of porcelains and textiles were brought back to King Manuel I and other highly placed persons in Lisbon by the leaders of the first expeditions.!! The king of Melinde on Africa’s east coast presented Vasco da Gama on his second\n\nvoyage in 1502 with “a bedstead of Cambay [India] wrought with gold and mother of pearl.” !2 Albuquerque and his aides in India had brocaded coats and a sedan chair made for the king as tokens of native craftsmanship. A sword and a crown of gold, armor, wrought arm bands and bracelets, and jewels were sent to Lisbon in 1512 as tokens of Siam’s friendship and as examples of its industry. Silks, pearls, and porcelains were collected in Asia as gifts for the queen and the ladies of the court. Albuquerque sent jewels to the official chronicler, Ruy de Pina, to assure himself a favored place in the history of Portugal’s endeavor in the East.!3 Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, following Albuquerque’s example, sent gifts of two gold necklaces to Dom Manuel. Occasionally the king even paid for Oriental ceramics and textiles out of his own pocket.!4 Indian elephants and a rhinoceros from Cambay were on display in Lisbon by 1513-15. The Zamorin of Calicut sent a dispatch to Lisbon in 1513 engraved on a sheet of gold. Fernio Peres d’ Andrade, who was in China in 1516-17, returned to Portugal and showed King Manuel “several of their [Chinese] paintings and figures. 15 The emissaries from Ceylon in 1541 brought documents and presents to Lisbon in two ivory caskets (see pl. 13). One of the caskets contained gems\n\nand a golden statue of the prospective king of Cotta (Kotte), and a jeweled crown.!6 King John III of Portugal crowned the effigy of the prince ina symbolic\n\ninvestiture by which the Sinhalese tacitly acknowledged the suzerainty of Portugal. In the meantime Joao de Barros, according to numerous references in his Décadas da Asia, was collecting through the men in the East the Oriental books and manuscripts which he used in writing his history.?7 I Sousa Viterbo, loc. cit.

As early as 1503, a French merchant wrote of Lisbon as the place where one can “view beautiful riches and other rarities brought... by Portuguese vessels plying to the East Indies.” 18 Only the spices were held as a monopoly of the Portuguese crown; consequently the Rua Nova dos Mercadores, the artery on which luxury wares from abroad\n\nwere sold, had become by midcentury one of the most elegant mercantile streets of Europe.!9 Under its covered galleries the prospective buyer could shop in all kinds of weather for porcelains, jewels, gold and silverware, exotic woods, and textiles from the East.2° By 1580 six shops in this street specialized in selling fine porcelains of various types,?! for the king had declared in 1522 that ships returning from India might carry porcelain as one-third of their total cargo.??\n\nPorcelain was but one of the items sold commercially on the Rua Nova. Eight hundred cases of Asiatic goods passed through the Casa da India in 1552, and these did not include the precious stones, porcelains, high quality amber,\n\nand bedspreads also imported.?3 Each year about two thousand ordinary gems and stones were imported, many of which were sold in the city.24 The cloth merchants of the Rua Nova stocked silks, velvets, damasks, and taffetas of\n\nvarious kinds and prices,25 and every week they held a fair on the Rossio of Lisbon at which they sold remnants, including Indian textiles, at bargain prices.*° Iberian merchants also dealt in Eastern commodities that were thought to be more useful than decorative. Aside from the spices which were often employed as medicaments and incense, the pharmacists of Lisbon kept on their shelves jars of dried rhubarb, root of China,27 myrobalans, tamarinds, benzoin and camphor 18 As quoted in H. Belevitch-Stankevitch, Le gout chinois en France au temps de Louis XIV (Paris, 1910), p. XXX.\n\n19 A painting of this bustling thoroughfare was made for King Manuel’s Book of Hours. 20 Jodo Brandao (d. 1562) gives the best contemporary description in his Estastica de Lisboa de 1552 as reproduced in Tratado da majestade, grandeza e abastanca da cidade de Lisboa na 2.* metade do século XVI (Lisbon, 1923), pp. 79-80; also see Damiao de Gois, Lisboa de quinhentos (Lisbon, 1937), p. 48.

Itis possibly for this reason that Nicholas Monardes, the eminent pharmacist of Seville, believes that the roots brought from America were fresher and better than those from Asia. See. N. Monardes, Joyfull News out of the Newe Founde Worlde (New York, 1925), I, 34-35.\n\n[1]\n\nCollections of Curiosities crystals for the treatment of common ailments. Bezoar stones, concretions found\n\nin the intestines of some Asian animals, were highly prized in India as antidotes against poison; in Portugal the bezoar was imported for both its medicinal and its amulet qualities and was sought after by many of the crowned heads of Europe. The king of Cochin sent a bezoar stone as a gift to Dom Manuel shortly\n\nafter he first engaged in business with the Portuguese. Opium and bhang (Indian hemp or hashish), famed for their aphrodisiac, stimulatory, narcotic, and hallucinatory attributes, could be found in the apothecary shops of Seville.?8 Datura (thorn apple or strammony), a powerful intoxicant, entered the European pharmacopoeia in the sixteenth century and was a subject of serious interest to\n\nbotanists and to illustrators of botanical books (pl. 36). Both scientists and amateur collectors competed to obtain samples of the exotic drugs for their collections of curiosities. Bezoar stones and rhinoceros horns were frequently set in silver or gold mountings by European craftsmen and were highly prized as showpieces and as antidotes against poison (pl. 8).\n\nIt was not only the royal family of Portugal that collected mementos of Lusitania’s great exploits in the East. Vasco da Gama, who spent his last years in\n\nEvora, had pictures of the trees and animals of India painted on his house.?9 Afonso de Albuquerque, the son of the conqueror, bought a country house at Bacalhoa near Setubal where he built a pavilion called Casa da India that was richly decorated with Indian hangings.3° Juan Sebastian del Cano, who brought Magellan’s ship back to Spain with a large cargo of spices, petitioned Charles V to allow him to have a coat of arms of two crossed sticks of cinnamon with three\n\nnutmegs and two cloves rampant.3! Dom Joao de Castro, after his tenure as viceroy of India (1545-48), built an estate near Sintra where the royal menagerie\n\nwas located, which he called Pinha Verde. On the hill above his garden he planted an arboretum of rare trees and bushes brought back from India.32 One of those he reputedly brought was the Chinese orange, the first sweet orange tree in Europe.33 And though this is not certain, he may have had a stela in his garden with an Indian inscription carved on it.34 In the latter half of the sixteenth century other Portuguese noblemen stocked their parks with exotic animals and plants. In Spain a most extensive menagerie was maintained by Don Hurtado de Mendoza.35 In an inventory of a Spanish nobleman dated 1560, it is thought worthwhile to notice that his wife possessed a headdress of Indian silk with edgings of linen. The residence of Simon Ruiz, merchant of Medina del Campo, 28 Monardes (op. cit. [n. 27], 1, 89-90) tells of seeing Indian dockworkers buying opium in Seville (ca. 1560). Also see L.

The great Charles V, even though he was not especially interested in the arts himself, possessed porcelains, golden items, and featherworks from the East.38 Philip II was much more of a collector and connoisseur of the arts than his father. Early in his career he bought Western books on Asia for the library at the Escorial, and later a number of Chinese books sent from the Philippines were added to this collection.39 In 1566 Queen Catharine of Portugal\n\nsent presents from India to her daughter-in-law, a Spanish princess, which included a selection of the finest porcelains. Other relatives and friends at the\n\ncourt of Lisbon likewise sent gifts of porcelain to Spain.4° Many of these porcelains were so highly prized that they were kept in the jewel room and treasury of Madrid. Portugal’s vital interest in Asian trade was vividly portrayed in the triumphal arches and pedestals erected in Lisbon when Philip of Spain made his formal entry there in 1581.4! Every major Portuguese conquest in the East was depicted as a statue presenting its products symbolically to the new king. Goa, represented as “Queen of the East,’ was given the central position in the display of cooperation erected by the merchants of Lisbon before the Ribeira Palace. The king responded positively to this overture of the merchants. He immediately ordered his servitors in the East to be on the watch in Asia for new items which might be of profit to the kingdom. The French ambassador wrote to his government on September 20, 1581, that the king himself had passed the previous day in\n\nfront of a window watching with great pleasure the unloading of the ships from India.4?

But perhaps most revealing of Philip’s self-conscious interest is a letter of October 25, 1582, in which he wrote to his daughters: Iam concerned to find other objects to carry back to Madrid with me; but it is difficult to find them, although they do say that they have many things on board one of their ships. Iam sending you some chunks of the wax that they have brought, because they [the chunks of wax] are not of the ordinary sort, as well as some pieces of white wax, a thing that Ihave never before seen. Seal some of your letters to me with this wax, so that I can see how it\n\nworks, although I guess that it will not be suitable.46 _ | Philip's curiosity about the East was titillated again when he was visited at Madrid in November, 1584, by the young emissaries from Japan (pl. 35). Among the gifts presented to the king on this occasion were folding screens (bydbus), two suits of Japanese armor, a bamboo desk with drawers in it given to the Jesuit Alessandro Valignano by Oda Nobunaga, a varnished wooden basin decorated with a gold border, a fancy basket crammed with trinkets, and a small lacquered pipe.47 In the Armeria of Madrid the legates themselves were shown many jewels from Asia and three Indian desks that belonged to the king.*8 Captured weapons, as well as those acquired by other means, were also sent to the king by his men in the field to acquaint him with Asian armaments and craftsmanship.+9 The Spanish governors and missionaries in the Philippines regularly sent books, maps, and other sources of information about China for the king to see. Archbishop Vicente de Fonseca, Philip’s appointee at Goa, sent his royal master a huge ivory crucifix that was so artistically carved in Ceylon that the figure of Christ “seemed to be alive.” 5° The king also displayed Asian animals in Madrid and added trees and shrubs from the Orient to his arboretum at Aranjuez. As a measure of the king’s interest in the Oriental trade there is the story\n\nof how in 1585 he ordered that the keel of a huge carrack, built at Goa of\n\n44 Ibid., p. 124. | | | 43 Ibid., pp. 205-6. 45 Ibid., p. 130.\n\n46 Ibid., p. 186. . 47}.

The inventory of Philip’s collection, prepared a number of years after his death for a sale of his belongings, lists around twenty thousand articles, including his porcelain collection of over three thousand pieces.5? It also includes paintings,\n\nmusical instruments, and lacquered boxes from China. For example, one entry reads: “Three canvases painted in distemper over a very fine canvas placed upon paper, of birds native to China.’ 53 Daggers, cutlasses, and knives of China and India also appear in the inventory.54 In a medal struck in Philip’s honor, the reverse bears the enigmatic inscription: “Reliquum. Datura. India.” 55 This is\n\nprobably a reference to the offerings of India to the king and his country. Philip’s personal involvement in collecting, which continued strong into the final year of his life, can be observed in a letter he wrote on May 10, 1598, to the viceroy of India, Dom Francisco da Gama. He ordered that there should be sent to himself “a good quantity of amber and chosen work [probably textiles], carpets, and a very few porcelains.”” And, commanded the king, “Whatever you do or send you will inform Miguel de Maura so that I may be apprised.’’5® Even though the precious metals of America and the products of the East flowed into (and through) Spain for most of the sixteenth century, the sumptuary laws imposed by the crown helped to prevent the subjects of Philip from indulging in ostentatious personal display or from spending large sums for collections of curiosa. A law of 1494, for example, prohibiting the importation and sale of textiles (except those for religious use) using gold or silver threads was reaffirmed and revised in 1534 by Charles V. While such restrictions were\n\ngenerally relaxed under Philip, many prohibitions remained. A decree of 1563 permitted women to wear precious stones, pearls, and gold and silver jewelry but only on the condition that they be used on the head, bust, and sleeves and never on the skirt!57 Nonetheless, by the end of the century, the jewelry shops of Spain were selling gold jewelry, porcelains, silk fabrics, fancy headdresses, and gloves for milady’s hands.58 But a decree of 1593 sternly 51C, R.

Information on the Iberian collections is limited and sketchy, perhaps because so many literary and artistic sources were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. A better estimate of the numbers and types of imports from Asia can be obtained from studying the reports of foreigners and the lists of gifts sent by the rulers of Portugal to the prelates and crowned heads of Europe.®! King Manuel sent to the pope many items which splendidly displayed the superb craftsmanship of Oriental artisans and artists. Gold and silver works, embroideries, brocaded clerical vestments, and rugs appear in the lists of his gifts, along with exotic animals and substantial quantities of spices and drugs.® Pius IV also received porcelain vessels and plates as gifts from Portugal.’ Throughout the century, the agents of the great commercial companies and the representatives of foreign governments kept their employers informed of arrivals at Lisbon and of the prices of Oriental jewels and pearls. Johann von Schuren, a Fugger factor, bought diamonds at midcentury in Lisbon for his friends in Augsburg and for the daughters of Anton Fugger.®+ Portuguese commercial agents in France and the\n\nLow Countries, as well as students and priests in Paris and Rome, acted as informants and even agents for the collectors of curiosa in Italy and northern Europe. Through such devious routes much additional information might easily be obtained about the products of Asian provenance which arrived in Portugal, and something more could certainly be learned about the distribution of Asian curiosa among interested parties in the commercial centers outside of Iberia. 2\n\nANTWERP AND THE LOW COUNTRIES\n\nFrom 1503 to 1553 the Portuguese and their agents in Antwerp delivered and sold almost everything that the buyer could find in Lisbon itself.65 But after the 59 Ibid., p. 122. 60 See E.

Philip II’s efforts to force the Hispanicization of the Netherlands from 1567 to 1580 resulted in a series of wars\n\nby which Antwerp lost whatever remained of its earlier status as the commercial heart of northwestern Europe. The emigration of the merchants to other cities brought a new order to affairs in the Netherlands by which Amster-\n\ndam and other Dutch port cities quickly replaced Antwerp in international trade. The rapid rise of the Dutch state in the last two decades of the sixteenth century culminated in the first Dutch voyages to the East and the establishment of a direct and regular trade with its marts. Antwerp’s rise and decline as a commercial center and its replacement by the Dutch formed a pattern followed in many artistic, intellectual, and publishing activities as well. Albrecht Diirer, the great German artist, was one of Antwerp’s most eminent\n\nvisitors in the years of its greatest glory. He traveled in the Low Countries during 1520-21; his diary contains numerous references to his activities there and imparts a genuine sense of the personal exultation he felt in being a part of Antwerp’s rich and bustling life. Diirer met the Portuguese factors and became so friendly with them that he did a portrait drawing of Fernandez d’ Almada and gave him as a gift the famous painting called “‘St. Jerome in Meditation.” He also sold, bartered, and gave as presents an almost incredible number of woodcuts and engravings by himself and his fellow German artists. From his Portuguese and Flemish friends and acquaintances, Direr, fascinated as he always was with new ideas and objects, acquired a collection of curios. His diary, used as an inventory to his collection, reveals that he acquired more than\n\none dozen Indian coconuts, musk balls, Calicut cloths, a green jug filled with myrobalans, “two ivory saltcellars from Calicut ... and a very pretty piece of porcelain,” several pieces of sandalwood, “Calicut feathers,” several green parrots, and a wooden weapon and a fish-skin shield from Calicut, and “two gloves with which the natives there fight.’’67 Almost anything of exotic interest stimulated Diirer to engage in reflection.\n\nOn a visit to Brussels in the summer of 1520, he saw the royal collection of oddities from the New World which were on display for the imperial\n\nto his diary: |\n\ncoronation. After viewing the gifts of Montezuma to Cortes, Diirer confided I saw the things which have been brought to the king [Charles V] from the new land of gold [Mexico], a sun all of gold a whole fathom broad, and a moon all of silver of the same size, also two rooms full of the armour of the people there, and all manner of wonderous weapons of theirs, harness and darts, very strange clothing, beds and all kinds of wonderful objects of human use much better worth seeing than prodigies. ... all the days of my life I have seen nothing that rejoiced my heart so much as these 66 BE. Panofsky, The Life and Art of Albrecht Diirer (Princeton, 1955), I, 206.\n\n67 Compiled from W. M. Conway (trans.), The Writings of Albrecht Diirer (London, 1911), pp. 98, 100, 103, 104, 10S, 109, III, 113, I14, 115, 116, 123.\n\n[17]\n\nCollections of Curiosities things, for I saw among them wonderful works of art, and I marvelled at the subtle ingenia of people in distant lands. Indeed, I cannot express all that I thought there.6*\n\nOthers were likewise to marvel at the “subtle ingenia,” but few were to leave their reactions so sharply and clearly expressed. The feather headdresses which Diirer saw on display in Brussels were certainly products of Mexico, and consequently the featherworks known in Europe are often associated in the minds of modern students exclusively with America.® While feather creations were regularly imported from America, it should be recalled that even at this early date Diirer bought “‘Calicut feathers” in Antwerp.\n\nHans Burgkmair in his woodcut gave feather skirts and headdresses to the “people of Calicut” (pl. 44). The feather pictures listed in the collections are also often associated with Asia,7° and in numerous tapestries and paintings the\n\nnatives of Asia are shown in feather dress. Such an association is warranted inasmuch as feathers were used in China and Japan as early as the eighth century for decorating clothes. Feathers were also appliquéd on screens in the Far East to make colorful designs, portraits, and calligraphic inscriptions. Head ornaments\n\nof feathers were as common in the islands of tropical Asia as they were in America. The sale of feathers from the kingfisher (Halcyon chloris) and from varicolored pheasants was a profitable export business in Cambodia, Borneo, and Japan.7! In 1585 the Japanese legates presented featherworks to Francesco Calceolari (Calzolari), apothecary of Verona, for his collection. And it should be remembered that plumages of the bird of paradise were brought back from the Moluccas, and from the marts of Asia where they were on sale, by many of the voyagers to the East.72 Their contemporaries in Europe, like Diirer himself, correctly associated colorful feathers, exotic plumages, featherworks, and feather headdresses with Asia as well as America. Shortly after Diirer returned to Augsburg, the Portuguese Humanist Damiao 68 Tbid., pp. 101-2. Also see Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Sonderausstellung Karl V (Vienna, 19$8), pp. 101-2. While he was in Brussels in 1520, Diirer also did a pen drawing of the royal gardens of Brussels with its plants and beasts from different places (reproduced in Panofsky, op. cit. [n. 66], II, no. 1409). He also did a pen drawing of Antwerp’s harbor in 1520 with its ships from far-off shores. Reproduced in ibid., no. 1408. 69 For example, see S.

He wasalso a regular visitor at the court of Archduchess Margaret, daughter of Emperor Maxmilian I and ruler of Flanders froni 1524 to her death in 1530. Margaret, one of the earliest royal collectors of Indian wares, probably knew the leading Portuguese merchants of Antwerp as well as Gois, as indicated by the fact that she had portraits of some of them among her possessions when she died.74 It was probably through them and Gois that she began, within the short span of her reign, to add to Charles’s collections of Americana and to begin serious collection of Asiatica in the Low\n\nCountries. While she acquired a number of oddities and textiles from Asia, Margaret was evidently partial to Chinese porcelain. According to the inventory of her possessions she assembled for the period a sizable collection of porcelain\n\nbowls, saltcellars, ewers, and plates. On her death in 1530 her collection was divided between Emperor Charles V and his brother Ferdinand.75 The “‘sinjoren,” as the men of wealth and position in Antwerp were called, competed with one another and with the leaders of the foreign merchant communities in constructing, decorating, and furnishing ostentatious dwellings. The patrician interiors of their showplace homes often boasted collections of statuary, tapestries, gems, coins, and exotic curiosities. Diego Duarte, a Portuguese jewel merchant, had a town house at the Place de Meu in which he brought together a beautiful collection of paintings, tapestries, and miscellaneous objects.7® Scholars like Abraham Ortelius and his publisher-friend, Christopher Plantin,\n\nwere part of this bourgeois society and shared its enthusiasm for collecting (pl. 16). As early as 1561 Ortelius wrote a note to remind himself to ascertain, presumably from his Portuguese correspondents, whether anything strange and\n\nnew from India had come to their attention.77 For his geographical work, Ortelius also searched far and wide in his personal travels and through his numerous correspondents in all parts of Europe for more and better books about and maps of Asia. Others wrote to Ortelius for the latest information on the East or asked his criticisms of their works on Asia.78 Merchants who traveled\n\n73 M.

(n. 5), p. 24. 78 For example, the Louvanian Jesuit Jacobus Nearchus wrote to Ortelius in 1570 asking his opinion\n\nabout a Jesuit letterbook and his own work on the Tartars. See ibid., p. 69; or see the letter of Gerhard Mercator from Duisburg of 1580, ibid., pp. 238-40.\n\n[19 ]\n\nCollections of Curiosities\n\nregularly between Lisbon and Madrid were commissioned to acquire coins for his collection.79 From the botanists Joachim Camerarius in Germany and Benito Arias Montano in Spain, Ortelius got information about and samples of exotic plants and seeds for his own garden and for Charles de L’écluse (pl. 15), as well as drugs and books on drugs.8° Arias Montano also sent Ortelius a bezoar stone\n\nand other gems from his own collection.8! Ortelius, meanwhile, helped Archduke Ernest at Brussels to augment his collections of jewelry and armor from all over the world.82\n\nA younger contemporary of Ortelius, Bernard ten Broecke (1550-1633) (usually called “Paludanus’’), a learned physician of Enkhuizen, was simultaneously building a collection of curiosities. Enkhuizen was also the home of Jan Huygen van Linschoten, the famed traveler who worked for the Portuguese in India from 1583 to 1588, and of Dirck Gerritsz (called ““China”) who had spent many years in the East as a gunner with the Portuguese fleets.83 While Paludanus had never traveled to India and points east himself, he had made a journey to Italy and the Levant, where he acquired many curios for his collection. In Italy\n\nhe knew Damiiio de Gois and probably learned from him something of the distant East as the Portuguese knew it.84 At any rate, by the time Linschoten returned to Enkhuizen in 1592, the fame of Paludanus as a scholarly collector had been well established.\n\nOrtelius did not yet know his neighbor Paludanus in 1592,85 but Duke Frederick I (ruled 1593-1608) of Wiirttemberg, having heard of the physician’s renowned Waunderkammer, made a special visit to Enkhuizen on September 17 of that year to see it.86 The Duke’s secretary, Jakob Rathgeb, took careful notes on the visit and eventually published an inventory of the collection in which he explained its organization and itemized its contents,87 sometimes rather roughly. It consisted of eighty-seven numbered cabinets and chests of marked and identified exhibits of earths, clays, sands, crystals, potteries, salts, nitrates, metals, jaspers, agates and carnelians, and precious stones; exotic woods, fruits, plants, roots, seeds, flowers, cereals, gums, and resins; strange animals or parts of animals, foreign birds (including three plumages of the bird of paradise), 79 Ibid., pp. 320-21. 80 Ibid., pp. 374-75, 429, 498-99.\n\n81 Ibid., pp. 429, 684-85.

Among the other Eastern commodities identified by Rathgeb were clay from which porcelain is made, jaspers and rubies, carnelians from India, and various samples of clothing from both Indies.\n\nWith the return of Linschoten in 1592, Paludanus helped to prepare the Itinerario of his compatriot for publication. He undoubtedly also added to his own collection the souvenirs of Eastern provenance brought back for him in Linschoten’s sea chest. We learn from Linschoten’s own testimony that he gave the doctor a penis bell, reeds and canes, palm-leaf paper, and samples of Chinese writing and paper.88 By 1596 Ortelius and Paludanus had come to know each other and were corresponding about the possibilities of a northern passage to China.89 Linschoten, who was privy to this correspondence, sent the geographer a parcel of pictures, probably prepared for the Itinerario, and sketches of the fruits\n\nand trees that grow in India.9° In his covering letter, Paludanus volunteered to send Ortelius curious natural items from his own cabinet. With the death of Ortelius in 1598, Paludanus’ collection stood in a class by itself as a private collection of natural curiosities. Its fame spread far and wide and in the seventeenth century an English traveler on viewing the collection composed, allegedly extempore, the following epigram: In the old world or new, what wondrous thing Did art to light or nature lately bring, This Paludanus house doth show a rare Proof of the Owners sovereign wit and care.9!\n\nBefore his death in 1633, Paludanus gave a few objects from his collections to the museum of natural history that was then being assembled in “the Publick Theater and Anatomie Hall of the University of Leyden.”’92 But the bulk of his collection remained at Enkhuizen until it was sold in 1651 to Duke Frederick Il of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. Frederick’s agent was Adam Olearius, a celebrated Eastern traveler; in 1666 Olearius published a catalogue of the collection at Gottorp (pl. 11). In the eighteenth century most of Paludanus’ collection went to Tsar Peter III, a descendant of the duke of Gottorp, and was incorporated into the Russian imperial collection at St. Petersburg. The remainder of it was acquired for the royal cabinet of curiosities in Copenhagen.% 88 Burnell and Tiele, op. cit. (n. 37), I, $0, 96-97, 99-100, 142. 89 Hessels, op. cit.

Agents of the Fuggers, Welsers, Prauns, and Herwarts kept information and products flowing into Augsburg and Nuremberg, two of the great artistic and printing centers of sixteenth-century Germany. Vienna and Prague, previously oriented commercially and intellectually toward Venice and Italy, came increasingly to feel the mercantile and artistic influence of the Low Countries during the sixteenth century, sometimes directly and sometimes through the mediation of the merchants and princes. Because of the widespread ramifications of their interests, the Habsburgs, the other German princes, and the great merchants were in a position to keep abreast of the latest developments in European and overseas commerce and to make artistic and scientific collections which were far richer and more comprehensive than those of their contemporaries in other\n\ncountries. The earliest German collectors, whether princes or commoners, tended, like Albrecht Diirer, to concentrate on natural curiosities from overseas and on Roman statuary, bronzes, coins, and inscriptions. Lucas Rem, a commercial agent of the Welsers assigned to Lisbon in the years between 1503 and 1506, bought “strange, new parrots, long-tailed monkeys, and other curious and delightful things.”°5 Konrad Peutinger and Willibald Pirckheimer, the Augsburg\n\nHumanists, eagerly sought books and information on the East.9° In 1507 Peutinger, who kept in close touch with the Welsers, acquired a parrot, exotic\n\nwoods, a bow, seashells, and other things from India through the German merchants.97 Pirckheimer commissioned Diirer to buy pearls and precious stones for him in Venice. He was, however, informed by the artist that prices were so high at Venice that one could do better at Frankfurt, where the goods from Antwerp were merchandised.°8 Georg Agricola (1490?-1555), who needed fossils and minerals for his scientific studies, was anxious to get specimens from Africa and Asia to strengthen his collection.99 Albrecht Diirer, as we have 94 Taylor, op. cit.

The Habsburgs of the prediscovery era were more interested in collecting native historical mementos than foreign curiosa or the antiquities of Greece and Rome. Each royal establishment in the first half or the sixteenth century had its own treasury. Maximilian I, the earliest Habsburg patron of the arts, had a stronger interest than his predecessors in the collection of curiosa and contem-\n\nporary art. But his collecting activities remained essentially medieval and dynastic in their aims. He kept treasuries in most of his castles, concentrated on German and family interests, and used contemporary art for political propaganda (pl. 10). Upon his death Maximilian divided his treasuries among his grandsons, Charles V and Ferdinand I. The great Charles, even with his vast imperial interests, was interested in overseas arts only as they served the Catholic faith and the dynasty.!© So, strange as it seems in light of his interests in Iberia, Charles’s collections, like those of his grandfather, contained only miscellaneous curiosities from the East: bezoar stones, roots of China, and a double coconut\n\nfrom the Seychelles Islands that was gilded and set in a silver mounting.!° Ferdinand I, who was king of Bohemia and Hungary and regent of Austria in the time of Charles V’s imperial reign, was much more intellectually curious than his older brother. He had been educated in the Netherlands, was tutored by Erasmus for a time, and was fascinated by Humanism and the contemporary\n\narts. One of the Venetian ambassadors described him as “‘a most searching investigator of nature, of the countries of this earth, and of animals.’’!? At Vienna he collected antiquities, books, armor, and contemporary paintings. Maximilian II, the eldest son of Ferdinand, inherited his father’s enthusiasm for art, science, collecting, and the patronizing of scholars and artists. He used his diplomatic emissaries, including those whom he sent to the Porte, to help in collecting oddities for his chamber of curiosities. He himself brought an Asian elephant from Iberia to Austria !°3 and was instrumental in founding the animal park at Ebersdorf. When he became emperor in 1564, Maximilian II set out to make Vienna the artistic as well as the administrative capital of the empire. He sponsored artists, botanists, and astronomers and brought to central Europe a more profound concern for contemporary intellectual and artistic affairs.1% Collections also began to be assembled in the middle and latter half of the\n\nsixteenth century by the lesser princes and wealthy merchants of south and central Germany. The two great ministers of the Habsburgs, Nicholas Perrenot de Granvelle and his son Cardinal Antoine de Granvelle, brought together at 100 Lhotsky, op. cit.

From the inventory of 1587 prepared by his son and successor, Elector Christian I (ruled 1586-91), it becomes clear that Augustus had a genuine predilection for Asian curiosities, a preoccupation that was certainly connected with his interest in the spice trade and with his ill-fated efforts to make Leipzig the staple of northern Europe.1° Aside from an assortment of seashells, strange plants and animals (for example, one griffon’s tongue), and Indian textiles, the list includes routiers and maps of India. Of particular interest are two pieces of “Indian” lacquered furniture presented to Elector Christian of Saxony (probably around 1586) by the grand duke of Tuscany, Francesco I (ruled 1574-87).1°7 The first piece was a desk with two small drawers that was covered with leather on which golden heathen pictures were painted. The other piece was a folding “Indian” table overlaid with black\n\nleather decorated with paintings of assorted birds and animals.!°8 In 1591 another grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand I (ruled 1587-1609), sent to the Saxon Elector John George I (ruled 1591-1656) an “Indian” strongbox decorated with gold and fabulous work, as well as a porcelain cup.!°9 From these descriptions it seems clear that some of these pieces were lacquerware from China or Japan. The Saxons in their turn probably gave Oriental rarities to Christian IV (ruled 1588-1648) of Denmark for his cabinet of curiosities.1!° While the Lutheran Saxons learned of Asia primarily through the spice traders, the Catholic Bavarians maintained ties through the Jesuits as well as the merchants. And like the Saxons, the Bavarian Dukes Albert V (ruled 1552-79) and William V (ruled 1579-97) also had numerous contacts with the grand dukes of\n\nFlorence and other patrons of the arts and sciences. Albert, who was a great patron of letters as well as arts, encouraged the Jesuits to move into the university\n\nof Ingolstadt to help in halting the spread of Protestantism in his dominions. In 1559 the first Jesuits settled at Munich and soon won for themselves an 105 Taylor, op. cit.

It is probable that these pieces were sent to Europe by Filippo Sassetti, the Rovellasca factor at Cochin. In 1629, the Augsburg collector Philip Hainhofer visited Dresden and described the tables and desks he saw there as being of “‘Indianischem lakwerk.” See O.

He reported seeing Japanese swords, knives, paintings, and pictures in the king’s chamber. He also commented on an “Indian carrier . . . built like a bed in which they carry their queen about.” See G. Krause, Tagebuch Christians des Jiingeren, Fiirst zu Anhalt\n\n...

Though the Jesuits clearly stimulated an interest at Munich in their Asian missions, they were more important as purveyors of news and information than of Asian arts and products. Indeed, it is striking that in the first inventory of Albert’s treasures made in 1565, only one art object, an ivory elephant with a tower on its back set with rubies, diamonds, and pearls,t!! can\n\nbe clearly distinguished as of Indian provenance. In Samuel Quickeberg’s description of the Bavarian art treasures in his Inscriptiones ... (1565), he lists only garments of the Indians, Arabs, and Turks made of parrot feathers and strange fabrics and tissues.1!2 The Jesuits, it may be assumed, were much more concerned to funnel whatever Bavarian money they could into the support of the Society and its activities than they were to help the duke squander his funds on “heathen vanities.” Such a conclusion is supported by the fact that the Jesuits dedicated one of their letterbooks published at Munich in 1570 to young Duke William as part of their propaganda campaign.'!3 In the final analysis the Wittelsbach dukes had to obtain their ethnographical and artistic curiosa from the East through their commercial agents in Iberia and the agents they employed in Italy. In 1555, for example, the agents of Mark Fugger in Lisbon obtained two ivory caskets for Duke Albert, several ivory combs, and a collection of jewelry (pls. 12 and 13). The caskets and combs were of Sinhalese origin and the caskets were possibly those which the Cotta emissaries\n\nbrought to Lisbon in 1541 with the golden effigy of their prince.!!4 That these caskets ultimately arrived safely in Munich is attested by the fact that they are described in the manuscript inventory of the Wittelsbach treasures prepared in 1598 by J. B. Fickler (1533-1610), the scholarly curator of the Bavarian collections.1!5 He also indicates that on a table in the Kunstkammer reposed a display of Indian ceramics, crystals, textiles, coconuts in their natural and embellished states, costumes, and weapons. Oriental coins, exotic chests (see pl. 78), seashells, and textiles also appeared within other parts of the Bavarian collection. Charles of Spain, the son of Philip II, presented Duke Albert with a rectangular table covered with mother-of-pearl inlaid with roses and foliages.!1 The enthusiasm of the Habsburgs for collecting became a mania in the latter\n\nhalf of the sixteenth century.

According to the inventory of 1590 the archduke left no fewer than 127\n\ntapestries as well as a collection of Tartar and Indian weapons.1!8 Archduke\n\nErnst, the contemporary regent of the Netherlands, owned exotic Asian weapons, pearls, and a cross of Oriental ebony.1!9 Emperor Maximilian’s younger brother, Archduke Ferdinand (1520-95), was the most systematic of the Habsburg collectors (pls. 2 and 3).12° While acting as regent in Prague from 1547 to 1563, he began to put together what came to be the nucleus of his great collection. It was also during his Prague days that he married Philippine Welser, of the great German commercial family. Ferdinand’s commoner wife continued her family’s interest in overseas activities by collecting books and other materials on the discoveries,!2! When Ferdinand was trans-\n\nferred to Innsbruck, he bestowed the nearby castle of Ambras upon his wife. After Philippine died in 1580, Ferdinand removed to Ambras his extensive collections of armor, portraits of great men, and ethnographic and artistic rarities. Here he organized his heterogeneous collection into logical divisions and\n\nsubdivisions, and took great personal interest and pride in studying and displaying it. Ferdinand’s collection was particularly rich in examples of the arts and crafts\n\nof Asia. The Innsbruck inventory of 1596, prepared shortly after the great collector’s death, is a document of first importance for the history of collecting.\n\nFrom it one gains a sense of the number and variety of Asian objects it was possible for an alert, wealthy, and conscientious collector to acquire in Europe before 1600. In the large Kunstkammer at Ambras, eighteen huge, tall cabinets\n\nhoused the items most precious to Ferdinand. Cabinet no. 14 contained the porcelain and the pearl ornaments. On the first shelf stood forty-two small but deep porcelain bowls, all of one size and decorated with blue foliage; on the next shelf were sixty-six porcelain vases, a few of which were glazed with gold, all the rest being plain blue and white; on the third, thirty-eight flatter porcelain bowls; on the fourth, thirty-eight larger porcelain bowls; on the fifth, thirtyeight pieces in all, of which thirty were medium-deep bowls and eight were flat plates; on the sixth stood seven bowls of blue-and-white porcelain, one of which was decorated with strange animals; on the seventh stood six large, flat bowls, 117 Lhotsky, op. cit.
