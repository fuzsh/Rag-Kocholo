        "text": "The novel SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in major health consequences across the globe. In addition to the over 1 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States (Johns Hopkins Univerity & Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center, 2022), the pandemic has also contributed to steep declines in cancer screening, most notably in the early phases of the pandemic due to government-mandated shutdowns of non-emergency medical services (Gupta et al., 2020). It is estimated that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decreased by 85% in the United States during the early phase of the pandemic, from March through April 2020 (London et al., 2022). The pandemic continues to affect CRC screening and diagnosis through staff shortages that reduce capacity at gastroenterology clinics and patient hesitancy to seek care (Wilensky, 2022; Del Vecchio Blanco et al., 2020). Despite cancer screening reopening efforts, CRC screening has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels (Ong, 2021).\n\nCRC remains the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with approximately 153,020 new cases and 52,550 deaths estimated in the year 2023 (Siegel et al., 2023). There is clear evidence that screening has a major impact on reducing the burden of CRC (Edwards et al., 2010; Zauber et al., 2012) and that it is cost-effective (Knudsen et al., 2021; Lansdorp-Vogelaar et al., 2011). The current United States Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) report recommends multiple screening options, including annual fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) and colonoscopy every 10 years for average-risk individuals (Davidson et al., 2021). However, CRC screening uptake was of concern even before the pandemic, with CRC screening rates well below the goal of 70.5% for Healthy People 2020 and the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable goal of 80% by 2018 (Shapiro et al., 2021). Low rates of CRC screening have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and delays in screening will result in delays in diagnosis, stage progression, and increased CRC mortality.\n\nThe pandemic may also further exacerbate existing disparities related to screening. The burden of unemployment and associated loss of access to healthcare varies across different racial and ethnic groups (Marcondes et al., 2021). Because of this, the pandemic may contribute to widening disparities in cancer outcomes. A recent analysis using National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data postulated that unemployment was adversely associated with being up-to-date with screening, with only 16.7% of unemployed individuals participating in recent CRC screenings, only 48.5% of whom were up-to-date with CRC screening (Fedewa et al., 2022).\n\nThe objective of this study is to estimate the impact of ongoing screening and treatment disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term CRC outcomes. We examine 25 scenarios that reflect different levels of pre-pandemic adherence to colonoscopy and FIT screening to assess how unequal recovery in screening may contribute to widening disparities in CRC lifetime outcomes.\n\nLoss of life due to screening disruptions was the largest for cohorts with severe disruptions after the pandemic (Figure 1). Aside from not receiving any screening, the worst-case scenario for the 50-year-old cohort was to postpone screening until age 65 when they become Medicare eligible. This cohort (scenario U50 | C@65) is expected to lose 104–127 LY per 1000 individuals – a 38–42% loss in LYG compared to a no-disruption scenario where they start screening at age 50 (Table 4). This cohort would be 1.3–1.9 times more likely to have CRC over their lifetime (Supplementary file 2) and 1.6–2.0 times more likely to die with CRC (Supplementary file 3) compared to a cohort that started screening at age 50. Other disruption scenarios are predicted to have minor effects on this cohort. For example, 50-year-olds with colonoscopy screening delayed by 18 months (scenario U50 | C18m) are expected to experience a loss of 6–7 LY per 1000 individuals, and a 2% loss in LYG from screening compared to a no-disruption scenario.\n\nTable 4\n\nSimilarly, 60-year-olds are expected to incur a substantial reduction in the benefit of screening if screening is discontinued after the pandemic. Those who started screening at age 50 and stopped after the pandemic are expected to lose 106–124 or 92–111 LY per 1000 individuals if pursuing a colonoscopy (C60 | U) or a FIT (F60 | U) screening regimen, respectively. Those who were semi-adherent to FIT screening before the pandemic and discontinued screening (f60 | U) lose even more LY – from 143 to 149 LY per 1000 individuals, or 58–69% of the benefit of screening. Similarly, unscreened 60-year-olds who start screening at age 65 (scenario U60 | C@65) are predicted to lose 42–45 LY per 1000 individuals compared to a scenario where they would have begun screening at age 60 – a 20–22% loss in LYG from screening due to this disruption.\n\nSwitching the screening regimen from colonoscopy to FIT and short-term delays will cause only a modest reduction in the benefit of screening. For the 60-year-old cohort, switching from colonoscopy to annual FIT after the pandemic with an 18-month delay is expected to result in a loss of 9–11 LY per 1000 individuals, a 3–4% loss relative to a scenario with no change in screening regimen and no delays. Similarly, short-term delays are predicted to cause minimal decreases in the benefits of the screening program. A 3-month delay in colonoscopy screening results in a loss of 0–2 LY per 1000 individuals for the 60-year cohort (scenarios C60 | C3m), whereas a 9- or 18-month delay (C60 | C9m and C60 | C18m) is expected to result in a loss of 0–2 or 0–3 LY per 1000 individuals, respectively. The worst-case scenario of an 18-month pause starting in March 2020 (scenario C60 | C18m) resulted in a 0–1% loss of the benefit of screening.\n\nSeventy-year-olds lose fewer LY due to screening disruptions but can still be affected by the pandemic as they are at greater risk for CRC than younger age groups. When discontinuing screening after the pandemic, 70-year-olds are expected to lose 38–87 or 29–33 LY per 1000 individuals due to the pandemic if pursuing a colonoscopy (C70 | U) or FIT (F70 | U) screening regimen, respectively. Unscreened 70-year-olds who only come back to screening at age 75 (scenario U70 | C@75) are expected to lose 49–50 LY per 1000 individuals, a 39–43% reduction in LYG relative to a scenario where they would have received colonoscopy screening at age 70.\n\nSeventy-year-olds who were up-to-date with their screening and experienced short-term delays of up to 18 months can expect minimal loss of LY due to pandemic-induced CRC screening disruptions, even if they switch to FIT after the pandemic. Those who transitioned from colonoscopy to FIT screening at age 70 can expect a reduction of 5–7 LY per 1000 individuals even if a return to FIT screening was delayed by 18 months (scenario C70 | F18m). This reduction in benefit represents a 2–3% reduction in LYG of colonoscopy-only screening.\n\nLow-sensitivity scenarios\n\nWhile colonoscopy sensitivity affects the overall benefit of screening, conditional on colonoscopy sensitivity, the loss of LY due to pandemic-induced scenarios is similar across sensitivity levels. Figure 2 compares LYG and LYL for high- and low-sensitivity scenarios. High-sensitivity scenarios are expected to yield higher LYG benefits than low-sensitivity scenarios, and the magnitude of this difference is higher for more intensive screening regimens. For 60-year-olds with a prior colonoscopy at age 50 who experience an 18-month delay during the pandemic (scenario C60 | C 18m), the benefit of screening is 240–297 LYG per 1000 individuals under a high colonoscopy sensitivity scenario, whereas it is 217–272 under a low colonoscopy sensitivity scenario.\n\nNevertheless, conditional on the sensitivity scenario, the effect of pandemic disruptions on LY lost is expected to be very similar for low-sensitivity scenarios. An 18-month delay in colonoscopy screening is expected to result in a loss of 0–3 LY per 1000 individuals for 60-year-olds assuming high sensitivity, whereas it is expected to result in a loss of 0–4 LY per 1000 individuals assuming low sensitivity.\n\nModel-based screening cost-effectiveness analyses present estimates under guideline-concordant scenarios, but there are many reasons why real-world screening will not follow guidelines. Chief among them in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted screening. Under those conditions, disparities in health outcomes can arise if disruptions are unevenly distributed in the population.\n\nOur results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic will have an uneven effect on CRC outcomes depending on whether and how fast screening is resumed after the pandemic onset. Consider three cohorts with the same pre-pandemic screening regimen and behavior: 60-year-olds with a prior colonoscopy at age 50. Cohorts that experience short-term disruptions (e.g. 3–18 months) only experience a small loss of life due to short-term delays – up to 3 LY per 1000 individuals. Those who switch from colonoscopy to FIT screening are projected to experience a greater loss of life – from 9 to 11 to LY per 1000 individuals. If screening is only resumed at age 65 (e.g. age at Medicare enrollment) or abandoned, the loss of benefits from screening could be 3–11 LY per 1000 individuals (scenario C60 | C@65). Lastly, discontinuing screening after the pandemic is projected to cause a loss of 106–124 LY per 1000 individuals, a decrease of 36–51% in the benefit of screening (scenario C60 | U). These results imply that the pandemic will become a disparity-widening mechanism if it differentially affects screening access and/or behavior across different population groups. These results also show that the pandemic is unlikely to substantially affect those whose screening is only interrupted momentarily.\n\nThese results highlight the potential implications of disruptions to preventative care due to loss of insurance following the pandemic. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, more dramatic declines in the number employed during the COVID-19 pandemic were seen in Black, Asian American, and Hispanic groups (Gemelas et al., 2022). Moreover, data from the US Census Household Pulse Survey suggests that Black and Hispanic workers were not only more likely to be unemployed but were also more likely to be without unemployment insurance (Mar et al., 2022). These results provide important clinical insight on the projected impact of these populations which may guide future policy on the aftereffects of the pandemic. Those who were previously uninsured for long periods of time throughout the pandemic should resume CRC screening to mitigate the long-term effects projected in these simulations.\n\nThese results also add to the growing evidence of the implications of delayed CRC care following the COVID-19 pandemic. A microsimulation study based on a Canadian population explored scenarios of differing screening delays and transition periods due to attenuated screening volumes and found that a 6-month delay in primary screening could increase CRC incidence by 2200 cases and 960 more cancer deaths over a lifetime (Yong et al., 2021). A microsimulation paper based on a Chilean population illustrated similar results with respect to CRC incidence and mortality due to the screening backlog and strained patient care during the pandemic (Ward et al., 2021). Our results mirror these conclusions and provide new scenarios which consider the aftereffects of loss of healthcare insurance due to disparities magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLimitations\n\nThis analysis presents a series of limitations. First, we do not present population-level estimates of reductions in benefits. While doing so could prove helpful, one would have to estimate how many people will be screened following each scenario we modeled. That would require individual-level data describing the distribution of delays and screening regimen switching in the population after the pandemic, which will not be available for many years. Instead of pursuing a population-level study, we conditioned our estimates on a discrete set of pre-specified disruption scenarios. This approach makes our study feasible but prevents us from making population-level predictions. Moreover, our approach does not account for potential correlation between risk factors and disruptions – we only provide estimates using models calibrated to represent cohorts with average risk.\n\nSecond, the scenarios presented in this analysis represent only a subset of the real-world changes in screening due to the pandemic. Even in the absence of a pandemic, individuals may switch from colonoscopy to FIT, and return to colonoscopy screening. To keep this analysis tractable, we restrict the variations considered in this paper to one switch from colonoscopy to FIT. Further, we only consider changes in screening regimens immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, this analysis only considers uncertainty stemming from structural differences between models and two scenarios of test characteristics and does not evaluate parameter or sampling uncertainty. Our estimates represent the expected value of estimates conditional on scenarios across an average-risk cohort drawn from the general US population.\n\nFinally, this paper identifies the effect of disruptions on the effectiveness of screening interventions but does not explicitly identify policy interventions or prioritization rules to amend those inequities. Future research could use extended cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate CRC screening interventions in the context of healthcare disparities (Asaria et al., 2016; Richard et al., 2020).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study quantified the potential effect of disruptions to colonoscopy screening and demonstrated that unequal recovery of CRC screening following the pandemic will predictably widen disparities in CRC outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic will severely reduce the benefits of CRC screening if it causes screening discontinuation or long-term (e.g. 5 year) delays. Short-term delays of 3–18 months and regime switching from colonoscopy to FIT are not expected to have significant consequences.\n\nBackground: Few national-level studies have evaluated the impact of 'hybrid' immunity (vaccination coupled with recovery from infection) from the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethods: From May 2020 to December 2022, we conducted serial assessments (each of ~4000-9000 adults) examining SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within a mostly representative Canadian cohort drawn from a national online polling platform. Adults, most of whom were vaccinated, reported viral test-confirmed infections and mailed self-collected dried blood spots to a central lab. Samples underwent highly sensitive and specific antibody assays to spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens, the latter triggered only by infection. We estimated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence prior to the Omicron period and during the BA.1/1.1 and BA.2/5 waves. We assessed changes in antibody levels and in age-specific active immunity levels.\n\nResults: Spike levels were higher in infected than in uninfected adults, regardless of vaccination doses. Among adults vaccinated at least thrice and infected more than six months earlier, spike levels fell notably and continuously for the nine months post-vaccination. By contrast, among adults infected within six months, spike levels declined gradually. Declines were similar by sex, age group, and ethnicity. Recent vaccination attenuated declines in spike levels from older infections. In a convenience sample, spike antibody and cellular responses were correlated. Near the end of 2022, about 35% of adults above age 60 had their last vaccine dose more than six months ago, and about 25% remained uninfected. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rose from 13% (95% CI 11-14%) before omicron to 78% (76-80%) by December 2022, equating to 25 million infected adults cumulatively. However, the COVID-19 weekly death rate during the BA.2/5 waves was less than half of that during the BA.1/1.1 wave, implying a protective role for hybrid immunity.\n\nConclusions: Strategies to maintain population-level hybrid immunity require up-to-date vaccination coverage, including among those recovering from infection. Population-based, self-collected dried blood spots are a practicable biological surveillance platform.\n\nFunding: Funding was provided by the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Pfizer Global Medical Grants, and St. Michael's Hospital Foundation.
