Conclusions

In conclusion, our data indicate that colorectal cancer from very elderly patients 90 years and older differ from those cancers from younger patients in several respects. The cancers are more frequently right-sided and more likely to demonstrate microsatellite instability. If the cancers contain a KRAS mutation, it is less likely to be in the second codon position. Finally, KRAS 61 may be more frequent in the very elderly. Overall, the colorectal cancers from our very elderly patients, 90 years and older, have at least as many, if not more, molecular genetic changes than the cancers from younger aged patients.
