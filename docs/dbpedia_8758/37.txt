Our local MP endorsed it

Nusrat Ghani, MP for Wealden, has visited Horam recreational ground to meet with Horam Village Hall Trustees and see the progress of the construction of the Get Active Pathway (GAP) project.

The GAP project is a 1km long all-weather exercise path around the perimeter of the recreation ground, which can be used by local residents all year round for exercising. Over the past two years, Nusrat has been extensively involved in supporting Horam Village Hall Trustees in raising funds for the construction and has previously convened several meetings with then Wealden District Council councillors for Horam Susan Stedman and Bob Bowdler to secure the go ahead for the project.

Having secured sufficient funds via several bids, the first phase of the construction of the pathway has begun this summer and is expected to be completed in the autumn.

Nusrat Ghani said: “I’m pleased that the project has finally reached its construction stage and it was great to return to Horam to see the progress. Health, leisure and sport facilities play a key role in building resilience and wellbeing in our communities and this new pathway will be a great enhancement of the recreational facilities available in Wealden. Similar projects in other areas in East Sussex including Hailsham have proven to be of great benefit to walkers, runners and mobility scooter users who struggle with the uneven and often muddy terrain of our countryside paths, and I am looking forward to joining Horam residents in celebrating the completion of the project in the autumn.”
