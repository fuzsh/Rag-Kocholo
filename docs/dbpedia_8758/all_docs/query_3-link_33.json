And Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of the rule of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; because he had no son.\n\n2-Kings 3:1\n\nAnd Jehoram, the son of Ahab, became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; and he was king for twelve years.\n\n2-Kings 3:6\n\nAt that time, King Jehoram went out from Samaria and got all Israel together in fighting order.\n\n2-Kings 8:16\n\nIn the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became king.\n\n2-Kings 8:25\n\nIn the twelfth year that Joram, the son of Ahab, was king of Israel, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, became king;\n\n2-Kings 8:29\n\nSo King Joram went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which the bowmen had given him at Ramah, when he was fighting against Hazael, king of Aram. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram, the son of Ahab, in Jezreel, because he was ill.\n\n2-Kings 12:18\n\nThen Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the holy things which Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had given to the Lord, together with the things he himself had given, and all the gold in the temple store and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael, king of Aram; and he went away from Jerusalem.\n\n2-Chronicles 17:8\n\nAnd with them, shemaiah and Nethaniah and Zebadiah and Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan and Adonijah and Tobijah and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and elishama and Jehoram the priests.\n\n2-Chronicles 21:1\n\nAnd Jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers, and his body was put into the earth in the town of David. And Jehoram his son became king in his place.\n\n2-Chronicles 21:3\n\nAnd their father gave them much silver and gold and things of great value, as well as walled towns in Judah; but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, because he was the oldest.\n\n2-Chronicles 21:4\n\nNow when Jehoram had taken his place over his father's kingdom, and had made his position safe, he put all his brothers to death with the sword, as well as some of the princes of Israel.\n\n2-Chronicles 21:5\n\nJehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years.\n\n2-Chronicles 21:9\n\nThen Jehoram went over with his captains and all his war-carriages ... made an attack by night on the Edomites, whose forces were all round him ... on the captains of the war-carriages.\n\n2-Chronicles 21:16\n\nThen the philistines and the Arabians, who are by Ethiopia, were moved by the Lord to make war on Jehoram;\n\n2-Chronicles 22:1\n\nAnd the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the army had put all the older sons to death. So Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, became king.\n\n2-Chronicles 22:5\n\nActing on their suggestion, he went with Jehoram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, to make war on Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead: and Joram was wounded by the bowmen.\n\n2-Chronicles 22:6\n\nAnd he went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which they had given him at ramah when he was fighting against Hazael, king of Aram.
