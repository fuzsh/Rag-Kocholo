        "text": "The population passed 160,000\n\nBetween the last two censuses (held in 2011 and 2021), the population of Wealden increased by 7.5%, from around 148,900 in 2011 to around 160,200 in 2021.\n\nThe population here increased at a similar rate to the overall population of the South East (7.5%), but by a greater percentage than the overall population of England (up 6.6% since the 2011 Census).\n\nIn 2021, Wealden was home to around 1.4 people per football pitch-sized piece of land, compared with 1.3 in 2011. This area was among the lowest 25% for population density across English local authority areas at the last census.\n\nThis article generally uses percentages to enable comparisons over time and between areas. The percentage point change is also used to show the difference between the 2011 and 2021 percentages.\n\nPopulation growth was similar in Wealden to the South East as a whole\n\nPercentage population change, Wealden and surrounding areas, 2011 Census to Census 2021\n\nEngland ▲6.6% South East ▲7.5% Wealden ▲7.5% Source: Office for National Statistics – 2011 Census and Census 2021\n\nSave as image (PNG <200KB) | Download the data (CSV <100KB) |\n\nAn older Wealden\n\nBetween the last two censuses, the average (median) age of Wealden increased by three years, from 46 to 49 years of age.\n\nThis area had a higher average (median) age than the South East as a whole in 2021 (41 years) and a higher average (median) age than England (40 years).\n\nThe median age is the age of the person in the middle of the group, meaning that one half of the group is younger than that person and the other half is older.\n\nThe number of people aged 65 to 74 years rose by just over 4,300 (an increase of 24.6%), while the number of residents between 35 and 49 years fell by around 4,200 (13.7% decrease).\n\nThe share of residents aged between 65 and 74 years increased by 1.9 percentage points between 2011 and 2021\n\nWealden stood out from other areas for housing\n\nThe percentage of households in the social rented sector increased in Wealden, but fell across England.\n\nIn Wealden, the percentage of households in the social rented sector rose from 7.7% in 2011 to 8.4% in 2021, while across England it fell from 17.7% to 17.1%. During the same period, the regional percentage fell from 13.7% to 13.6%.\n\nPrivate renting in Wealden increased from 11.1% to 13.5%, while the rate of home ownership decreased from 78.7% to 77.0%.\n\nThe rate of social renting in Wealden increased by 0.7 percentage points\n\nChanging relationships in Wealden\n\nWealden saw the South East's joint largest percentage-point rise in the proportion of people aged 16 years and over who had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership (from 9.4% in 2011 to 10.1% in 2021).\n\nAcross the South East, the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership increased from 9.1% to 9.3%, while the percentage in nearby Rother increased from 10.3% to 11.1%.\n\nThese figures include same-sex marriages and opposite-sex civil partnerships in 2021, neither of which were legally recognised in England and Wales in 2011. Same-sex marriages have been legally recognised in England and Wales since 2014 and opposite-sex civil partnerships have been recognised since 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership in Wealden increased by 0.8 percentage points\n\nWealden residents' country of birth\n\nIn the latest census, around 144,400 Wealden residents said they were born in England. This represented 90.2% of the local population. The figure has risen from just over 135,100 in 2011, which at the time represented 90.7% of Wealden's population.\n\nScotland was the next most represented, with just over 1,800 Wealden residents reporting this country of birth (1.1%). This figure was down from around 1,900 in 2011, which at the time represented 1.3% of the population of Wealden.\n\nThe number of Wealden residents born in Wales remained close to 1,300 between the last two census (from 0.9% of the local population in 2011 to 0.8% in 2021)\n\nIn 2021, 90.2% of Wealden residents reported their country of birth as England\n\nUnpaid care in Wealden\n\nIn 2021, 4.9% of Wealden residents (aged five years and over) reported providing up to 19 hours of unpaid care each week. This figure decreased from 8.0% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, 1.6% of residents (aged five years and over) reported providing between 20 and 49 hours of unpaid care each week, compared with 1.2% in 2011. The proportion of Wealden residents (aged five years and over) that provided at least 50 hours of weekly unpaid care increased from 2.0% to 2.3%.\n\nThe decrease in the proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care was greater in Wealden (3.1 percentage points) than across the South East (2.8 percentage points, from 7.3% to 4.5%). Across England, the proportion fell by 2.8 percentage points, from 7.2% to 4.4%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and managed their provision of unpaid care, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in Wealden decreased by 3.1 percentage points\n\nReligion in Wealden\n\nIn 2021, 42.1% of Wealden residents reported having \"No religion\", up from 26.3% in 2011. The rise of 15.8 percentage points was the largest increase of all broad religious groups in Wealden. Because the census question about religious affiliation is voluntary and has varying response rates, caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses.\n\nAcross the South East, the percentage of residents who described themselves as having \"No religion\" increased from 27.7% to 40.2%, while across England the percentage increased from 24.8% to 36.7%.\n\nIn 2021, 49.5% of people in Wealden described themselves as Christian (down from 64.0%), while 6.3% did not state their religion (down from 7.9% the decade before).\n\nThere are many factors that can cause changes to the religious profile of an area, such as a changing age structure or residents relocating for work or education. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses. Religious affiliation is the religion with which someone connects or identifies, rather than their beliefs or religious practice.\n\nRead the bulletin Religion, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 42.1% of usual residents in Wealden reported having \"No religion\"\n\nNational identity in Wealden\n\nIn 2021, 3.6% of Wealden residents did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK. This figure increased from 3.3% in 2011.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK was greater across the South East (1.6 percentage points, from 7.1% to 8.7%) than in Wealden (0.4 percentage points). Across England, the percentage increased by 1.7 percentage points, from 8.2% to 10.0%.\n\nIn Census 2021, “British” was moved to the top response option and this may have influenced how people described their national identity. For further information, please see our quality report.\n\nThe percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity in Wealden increased by 0.4 percentage points\n\nFamily in Wealden\n\nOf Wealden households, 18.9% included a couple but no children in 2021, down from 20.0% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just under one in five households (18.5%) included a couple with dependent children, compared with 20.2% in 2011. The percentage of single family households including a couple living with only non-dependent children increased from 6.4% to 7.0%.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of households including a couple but no children in Wealden (1.1 percentage points) was similar to the decrease across the South East (1.4 percentage points, from 18.7% to 17.4%). Across England, the percentage fell by 0.9 percentage points, from 17.6% to 16.8%.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple without children in Wealden decreased by 1.1 percentage points\n\nChange in employment\n\nOf Wealden residents aged 16 years and over, 54.7% said they were employed (excluding full-time students) in 2021, down from 56.7% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just under 1 in 50 people (1.9%) said they were unemployed, compared with 2.2% in 2011. The percentage of retired Wealden residents increased from 28.1% to 29.5%.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed was greater in Wealden (2.0 percentage points) than across the South East (1.3 percentage points, from 59.0% to 57.6%). Across England, the percentage fell by 0.8 percentage points, from 56.5% to 55.7%.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of rapid and unparalleled change; the national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market and our ability to measure it.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were employed (excluding full-time students) in Wealden decreased by 2.0 percentage points\n\nFewer adults working long hours\n\nIn 2021, 12.9% of Wealden residents aged 16 years and over and in employment said they worked over 49 hours per week. This figure decreased from 16.3% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, just under one in seven people (13.4%) said they worked 15 hours or less per week, compared with 12.3% in 2011. The percentage of adults in employment working 31 to 48 hours per week increased from 51.1% to 53.0%.\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week was greater in Wealden (3.4 percentage points) than across the South East (2.7 percentage points, from 14.6% to 11.9%). Across England, the percentage fell by 2.2 percentage points, from 13.3% to 11.1%.\n\nWorking hours may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe percentage of adults in employment who worked 49 hours or more in Wealden decreased by 3.4 percentage points\n\nDisability in Wealden\n\nIn 2021, 5.8% of Wealden residents were identified as being disabled and limited a lot. This figure decreased from 6.5% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, just under 1 in 10 people (9.9%) were identified as being disabled and limited a little, compared with 9.2% in 2011. The proportion of Wealden residents who were not disabled decreased from 84.4% to 84.3%.\n\nThe decrease in the proportion of residents who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot was greater across the South East (1.0 percentage points, from 7.2% to 6.2%) than in Wealden (0.7 percentage points). Across England, the proportion fell by 1.6 percentage points, from 9.1% to 7.5%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived their health status and activity limitations, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot in Wealden decreased by 0.7 percentage points\n\nHealth in Wealden\n\nIn 2021, 51.4% of Wealden residents described their health as \"very good\", increasing from 49.6% in 2011. Those describing their health as \"good\" fell from 34.6% to 33.8%. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe proportion of Wealden residents describing their health as \"very bad\" was 0.8% (similar to 2011), while those describing their health as \"bad\" was 3.0% (similar to 2011).\n\nThese data reflect people’s own opinions in describing their overall health on a five point scale, from very good to very bad.\n\nCensus 2021 was conducted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and rated their health, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nThe percentage of people in very good health in Wealden increased by 1.8 percentage points\n\nEthnic groups in Wealden\n\nIn 2021, 1.7% of Wealden residents identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category, up from 1.0% in 2011. The 0.7 percentage-point change was the largest increase among high-level ethnic groups in this area.\n\nAcross the South East, the percentage of people from \"Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups\" increased from 1.9% to 2.8%, while across England the percentage increased from 2.3% to 3.0%.\n\nIn 2021, 96.0% of people in Wealden identified their ethnic group within the \"White\" category (compared with 97.5% in 2011), while 1.4% identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category (compared with 1.2% the previous decade).\n\nThe percentage of people who identified their ethnic group within the \"Other\" category (\"Arab\" or \"Any other ethnic group\") increased from 0.2% in 2011 to 0.5% in 2021.\n\nThere are many factors that may be contributing to the changing ethnic composition of England and Wales, such as differing patterns of ageing, fertility, mortality, and migration. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses.\n\nRead the bulletin Ethnic group, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 1.7% of usual residents in Wealden identified their ethnic group within the \"Mixed or Multiple\" category\n\nAbout the data\n\nCensus data are adjusted to reflect estimated non-response so that the published results relate to the entire usually resident population as it was on Census Day (21 March 2021).\n\nThose respondents who were on furlough because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were asked to classify themselves as \"temporarily away from work\" to ensure they remained in the economically active population.\n\nStudents are counted as usually resident at their term-time address even if they were not physically present there on Census Day.\n\nThe questions relating to disability differed slightly between 2011 and 2021 to ensure that data were more closely aligned with the definition of disability in the Equality Act (2010). There was also a change to question wording for unpaid care, for more information read the health, disability and unpaid care quality information.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout the health, disability and unpaid care sections. They allow for fairer comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.\n\nPercentages and percentage point changes have been individually rounded to one decimal place. This means they may not sum exactly.\n\nTell us what you think about this publication by answering a few questions.\n\nDownload the data used in this article\n\nxlsx (1.5 MB)\n\nAbout these articles\n\nThere is an article like this for every local authority district in England and Wales.
