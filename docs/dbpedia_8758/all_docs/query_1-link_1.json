        "text": "District in East Sussex, England\n\nNon-metropolitan district in England\n\nWealden is a local government district in East Sussex, England. Its council is based in Hailsham, the district's second largest town. The district also includes the towns of Crowborough, Polegate and Uckfield, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The district's name comes from the Weald, the landscape and ancient woodland which occupies much of the centre and north of the area.\n\nMuch of the district's landscape is recognised for its beauty; the south of the district includes part of the South Downs National Park, and the north of the district includes part of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The district has two sections of coastline, lying east and west of the neighbouring authority of Eastbourne, with the western section of coastline including the cliffs known as the Seven Sisters.\n\nThe neighbouring districts are Eastbourne, Lewes, Mid Sussex, Tandridge, Sevenoaks, Tunbridge Wells and Rother.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:[2]\n\nHailsham Rural District\n\nUckfield Rural District\n\nThe new district was named Wealden after the landscape and woodland.[3]\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nWealden District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by East Sussex County Council.[6] The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.[7]\n\nIn the parts of the district within the South Downs National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the South Downs National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 27-person National Park Authority.[8]\n\nPolitical control\n\n[edit]\n\nThe council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats and Greens.[9]\n\nThe first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:[10][11]\n\nParty in control Years Conservative 1974–1995 No overall control 1995–1997 Conservative 1997–2023 No overall control 2023–present\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nThe leaders of the council since 2001 have been:[12]\n\nCouncillor Party From To Rupert Thornely-Taylor Conservative 18 Jul 2001 4 May 2003 Nigel Coltman Conservative 21 May 2003 6 May 2007 Pam Doodes Conservative 23 May 2007 19 May 2010 Bob Standley Conservative 19 May 2010 18 May 2022 Ann Newton Conservative 18 May 2022 18 May 2023 James Partridge Liberal Democrats 18 May 2023 15 May 2024 Rachel Millward Green 15 May 2024\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the 2023 election and subsequent changes of allegiance up to June 2024, the composition of the council was:[13][14]\n\nParty Councillors Green 11 Liberal Democrats 11 Independent 11 Conservative 10 Labour 2 Total 45\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Greens sit together as the \"Alliance for Wealden\" group, which forms the council's administration. Of the independent councillors, five sit as the \"Independent Group\", four form the \"Independent Democrats\" and two do not belong to a group.[15] The next election is due in 2027.\n\nPremises\n\n[edit]\n\nThe council is based at the Council Offices on Vicarage Lane in Hailsham. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1982.[16]\n\nWhen created in 1974 the council inherited two main offices from its predecessors:\n\nCortlandt, 18 George Street, Hailsham, an eighteenth century house which had been bought by Hailsham Rural District Council in 1932.[17][18]\n\nStarfield, Beacon Road, Crowborough, formerly the home and observatory of astronomer Isaac Roberts, which had been bought by Uckfield Rural District Council in 1928.[19]\n\nThe council's staff were initially divided between the two buildings.[20] The council moved its Hailsham office from Cortlandt to the new Council Offices on Vicarage Lane in 1982.[21] The Crowborough office moved to a new building on Pine Grove in 1988, with Starfield subsequently being redeveloped for housing.[22]\n\nThe council subsequently consolidated its offices at the Hailsham building and sold the Crowborough building to Crowborough Town Council in 2016.[23]\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Wealden District Council elections\n\nSince the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 45 councillors representing 41 wards, with each ward electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.[24]\n\nWard Population\n\n(2021 Census) Arlington 2,963 Buxted 3,892 Chiddingly, East Hoathly and Waldron 3,309 Crowborough Central 4,125 Crowborough Jarvis Brook 4,305 Crowborough North 3,286 Crowborough South East 3,804 Crowborough South West 3,237 Crowborough St. Johns 2,935 Danehill & Fletching 3,886 Forest Row 4,135 Framfield & Cross-in-Hand 3,243 Frant & Wadhurst (2 seats) 6,941 Hadlow Down & Rotherfield 3,257 Hailsham Central 3,545 Hailsham East 4,785 Hailsham East 4,785 Hailsham North 2,914 Hailsham North West 3,738 Hailsham South 3,327 Hailsham West 4,232 Hartfield 3,284 Heathfield North 3,913 Heathfield South 4,163 Hellingly 5,011 Herstmonceux & Pevensey Levels (2 seats) 6,931 Horam & Punnetts Town (2 seats) 6,902 Lower Willingdon 3,314 Maresfield 3,659 Mayfield & Five Ashes 3,654 Pevensey Bay 2,890 Polegate Central 5,107 Polegate North 3,868 Polegate South & Willingdon Watermill 3,450 South Downs 2,977 Stone Cross 3,685 Uckfield East 3,225 Uckfield New Town (2 seats) 5,744 Uckfield North 3,131 Uckfield Ridgewood & Little Horsted 3,152 Upper Willingdon 3,266 Withyham 2,956 Total Wealden 160,151\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nWealden District covers two main upland areas: the section of the High Weald within East Sussex; and the eastern end of the South Downs, between which lies the Vale of Sussex, the lowlands of which are named the Pevensey Levels. The River Ouse, some of the tributaries of which originate in the district, is the border with the Lewes District; and the River Cuckmere is wholly in Wealden. The district's coastline to the English Channel to the south is interrupted by Eastbourne. The River Rother rises on the Weald and flows easterly to the east of Rye Bay.\n\nThe Wealden basin contains significant reserves of shale oil, totalling 4.4 billion barrels of oil in Wealden and surrounding areas according to a 2014 study, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said \"will bring jobs and business opportunities\" and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area is required to achieve these objectives, which has been opposed by environmental groups.[25]\n\nAt the 2011 census the district had the highest proportion of home ownership of the 37 local authorities in Surrey, Sussex and Kent.[26]\n\nTowns and parishes\n\n[edit]\n\nThis district is entirely divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Crowborough, Hailsham, Polegate and Uckfield take the style \"town council\". Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.[27][28][29]\n\nParish Type Area\n\n(sq mi) Population\n\n(2007) Pop. density\n\n(/sq mi) Alciston Parish Meeting 2.7 146 53.7 Alfriston Parish Council 3.6 774 214.2 Arlington Parish Council 7.1 490 69.2 Berwick Parish Council 1.9 289 149.4 Buxted Parish Council 8.4 3145 376.4 Chalvington with Ripe Parish Council 4.3 1082 252.0 Chiddingly Parish Council 6.8 1006 147.9 Crowborough Town Council 5.2 19988 3812.1 Cuckmere Valley Parish Council 6.8 197 28.9 Danehill Parish Council 8.7 1927 220.3 East Dean and Friston Parish Council 3.3 1577 474.9 East Hoathly with Halland Parish Council 5.8 1343 229.9 Fletching Parish Council 9.9 1041 104.7 Forest Row Parish Council 12.6 5054 402.4 Framfield Parish Council 7.6 1855 243.3 Frant Parish Council 12.3 1367 110.9 Hadlow Down Parish Council 6.6 715 109.1 Hailsham Town Council 7.5 19836 2652.3 Hartfield Parish Council 16.2 2157 132.9 Heathfield and Waldron Parish Council 20.4 11514 564.5 Hellingly Parish Council 7.6 1552 205.1 Herstmonceux Parish Council 9.5 2598 272.8 Hooe Parish Council 3.9 446 115.4 Horam Parish Council 4.0 2583 643.3 Isfield Parish Council 3.0 564 190.7 Laughton Parish Council 7.3 585 79.7 Little Horsted Parish Meeting 4.1 168 40.8 Long Man Parish Council 6.2 412 66.2 Maresfield Parish Council 10.1 3246 319.9 Mayfield and Five Ashes Parish Council 16.4 3562 217.6 Ninfield Parish Council 4.1 1520 371.7 Pevensey Parish Council 6.8 3152 463.8 Polegate Town Council 2.8 8021 2853.6 Rotherfield Parish Council 17.8 3151 177.0 Selmeston Parish Meeting 2.6 190 73.1 Uckfield Town Council 2.9 13873 4810.0 Wadhurst Parish Council 15.5 4818 311.0 Warbleton Parish Council 11.2 1262 112.3 Wartling Parish Council 4.3 396 92.7 Westham Parish Council 5.5 5829 1066.9 Willingdon and Jevington Parish Council 4.1 6156 1511.3 Withyham Parish Council 14.2 2651 186.7 Total Wealden 321.7 142238 442.2\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe major trunk road is the A22, London to Eastbourne; it is crossed by the A26 Maidstone–Lewes road at Uckfield; and the A267 Tunbridge Wells to Eastbourne road. There are also three west–east roads: the A259 coastal route; next inland is the A27 Pevensey–Brighton trunk road; and further to the north the A272 cross-country route to Winchester.\n\nThe East Coastway Line, serving Eastbourne and Hastings, uses the Vale of Sussex and has two station serving different sides of Pevensey in the district, which forms a generally suburban conurbation with Westham and a largely rural holiday and visitor coastline, Pevensey Bay. The other railway line is the Uckfield Branch Line from London Bridge.\n\nWealden is crossed by a number of National Cycle Network routes:\n\nRoute 2 (South Coast Cycle Route) https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/route-2/\n\nRoute 21 (London to Eastbourne) which makes use of the Forest Way and Cuckoo Trail paths along disused railway lines https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/route-21/\n\nLong-distance footpaths include the:\n\nSouth Downs Way\n\nMonarch's Way\n\nSussex Border Path\n\nWealdway.\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nWealden is served by BBC South East and ITV Meridian broadcasting from the Heathfield TV transmitter which is situated near Heathfield. [30]\n\nRadio stations for the area are:\n\nBBC Radio Sussex\n\nHeart South\n\nAshdown Radio (serving Uckfield and Crowborough)\n\nSeahaven FM (covering Polegate)\n\nMore Radio Eastbourne (covering Hailsham)\n\nLandmarks\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor landmarks include the Seven Sisters and Cuckmere Haven along the coast; and the Long Man of Wilmington together with all of the paths over the South Downs National Park. Roman fortified hills can be found in the north of the area and Uckfield has a large architectural conservation area.\n\nSheffield Park Garden is an informal landscape garden now owned by the National Trust but laid out by Capability Brown. Near to this is the terminus of the Bluebell Railway, a heritage, steam railway line.\n\nA late medieval castle construction, moated Herstmonceux Castle, was begun in 1440. It is open to visitors and there are organised tours on a few summer days.[31]\n\nThe north of the district includes Ashdown Forest, which provided the inspiration for the Hundred Acre Wood in the Winnie the Pooh stories by A. A. Milne, who lived in Hartfield.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of current places of worship in Wealden\n\nList of former places of worship in Wealden"
