        "text": "PITTSBURGH, Pa. - After deliberating for three hours, a federal jury late on the afternoon of March 8, 2024, found Paris Carter guilty of conspiracy to distribute 400 grams or more of fentanyl and 100 grams or more of acetyl fentanyl and conspiracy to commit money laundering, United States Attorney Eric G. Olshan announced today.\n\nCarter, 34, formerly of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was tried before United States District Judge Marilyn J. Horan in Pittsburgh.\n\nEvidence introduced during the five-day trial established that, between January 2017 and February 2018, Carter arranged for the illegal importation of multiple kilograms of fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl directly from China and then distributed those drugs throughout the Pittsburgh region. Using the proceeds of his drug trafficking, Carter moved to Beverly Hills, California, where he rented two separate homes at costs of $10,000 and $14,500 per month and also leased three vehicles—two Bentleys and a Mercedes Benz. As part of his money laundering activity, Carter used other individuals to initiate financial transactions in their names to pay for the drugs obtained from China. He also provided drug proceeds to approximately seven other individuals who used these illicit funds to purchase cashier checks that Carter then used as downpayments on his vehicles, which he arranged to lease in the name of his aunt and co-defendant, Tamara Carter, whom the jury acquitted at trial.\n\n“Paris Carter flooded the Pittsburgh area with substantial quantities of fentanyl from China and lived large on the proceeds, moving to Beverly Hills and driving multiple Bentleys,” said U.S. Attorney Olshan. “Now, he faces a minimum sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment. We thank our law enforcement partners at the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Pennsylvania State Police for their critical partnership in holding one of our region’s most significant fentanyl distributors accountable for his crimes.”\n\n“The guilty verdict of Paris Carter was the culmination of years of tireless efforts by all of our law enforcement partners involved,” said Lesley Allison, Inspector in Charge of the Pittsburgh Division of the United States Postal Inspection Service. “Carter purchased kilos of fentanyl from China during the height of the opioid epidemic and used the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle with no regard to the health or safety of the American public. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service takes great pride in upholding our commitment to rid the U.S. Mail of these illicit and dangerous substances.”\n\nDuring trial, the Court also was informed that Carter had previously been convicted in the Western District of Pennsylvania of a serious drug felony—namely, possession with the intent to distribute heroin, for which he was sentenced to 37 months of imprisonment in 2011.\n\nJudge Horan scheduled sentencing for June 28, 2024. The law provides for a maximum total sentence of at least 15 years and up to life in prison, a fine of $20.5 million, or both. Under the federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed is based on the seriousness of the offenses and the prior criminal history of the defendant.\n\nAssistant United States Attorneys Brendan T. Conway and Brendan J. McKenna prosecuted this case on behalf of the United States. The United States Postal Inspection Service and Pennsylvania State Police conducted the investigation of Carter.\n\nThis prosecution is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) investigation. OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs, and transnational criminal organizations that threaten the United States by using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies against criminal networks."
