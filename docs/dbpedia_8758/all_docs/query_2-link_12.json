Grants of up to £25,000 are available to those in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors.

Business rates for many Wealden businesses have already been suspended for the 2020-21 tax year, and we hope that this additional support will go some way to help prevent closures and redundancies. We urge as many eligible businesses as possible to apply for this one-off grant funding to help support and secure their future in the aftermath of Coronavirus.”\n\nMore information on advice and support for businesses during the pandemic is available on the COVID-19 section of our website: https://www.wealden.gov.uk/news-and-events/coronavirus-covid-19-latest/advice-support-and-information-for-businesses/\n\nResidents of Wealden’s Retirement Living Courts\n\nTo help with any concerns you may have, Wealden District Council have produced these questions & answers.\n\nUseful Links from the Wealden District Council Website\n\nStaying in, happy and healthy\n\nVoucher scheme to help residents with fuel costs\n\nFriends Against Scams has some helpful advice\n\nCommunity Support"
