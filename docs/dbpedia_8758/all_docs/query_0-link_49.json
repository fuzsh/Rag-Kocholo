        "text": "​​​​​​​An eight-week public consultation will start in March 2024 regarding the recently agreed Wealden Draft Local Plan.\n\nThe Draft Local Plan Regulation 18 document was agreed at a Full Council meeting and will be consulted on alongside its supporting Sustainability Appraisal.\n\nThe consultation dates are now confirmed, meaning the consultation period will run from 5pm, Friday 15 March to 5pm, Friday 10 May 2024.\n\nAlongside the face-to-face exhibitions, Wealden District Council will launch a virtual exhibition accessed via the council’s website so that residents who cannot or do not want to visit the face-to-face exhibitions can still partake in the consultation. Interested parties wishing to be notified when the consultation commences can register using the consultation portal at https://consult.wealden.gov.uk/kse\n\nCouncillor Ian Tysh, Alliance for Wealden (Green Party), and lead councillor for Planning and Environment, said, “It is important that everyone has their say on the Local Plan as it affects everyone living in Wealden. There is an online consultation which can be accessed by residents at the comfort of their own home, as well as face-to-face consultations which are spread across various venues in the district.\n\n“I would like to encourage residents, businesses, and communities to give their views as this will help shape the final version of the Local Plan.”\n\nThe locations of the face-to-face consultations are confirmed below."
