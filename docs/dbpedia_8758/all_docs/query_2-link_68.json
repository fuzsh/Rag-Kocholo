        "text": "The records of the district councils formed under the 1894 Act which were deposited by Hailsham and Uckfield RDCs or by Wealden District Council down to about 1977 were initially organised in the Record Office in collections for each of 1894 councils (including they records they inherited from rural sanitary authorities and other predecessors). Later deposits by Wealden District Council were placed in a collection for that authority. In 2003 the collections for the 1894 councils were assimilated into the collection for Wealden District Council and assigned new references. The former references are generally given at file level, but occasionally at series level\n\nConcordance of old and new references for records relisted in 2003 and, in a few cases, at earlier
