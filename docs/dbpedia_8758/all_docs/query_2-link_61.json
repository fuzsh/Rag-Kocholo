His knowledge, good humour and boundless enthusiasm was clear for all to see and he counted many of the walkers among his friends.\n\nPlease bear with us while we look at the future schedule of walks and check this page regularly for updates.\n\nGraham’s family have invited those who knew and worked with Graham to attend his funeral, which will be held on Tuesday 27 August 2024 at 3pm at the Wealden Crematorium."
