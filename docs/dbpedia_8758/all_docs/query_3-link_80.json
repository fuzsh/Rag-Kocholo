        "text": "Plans for a 46-home development in East Sussex have been rejected due to the \"unacceptable impact\" it would have on the area. Wealden District Council's planning committee concluded that building the proposed homes at Rosemead Farm in Horam would damage the village's character and appearance.\n\nThis decision came despite the scheme being recommended for approval by planning officers. Stacey Robbins, the council's head of planning, had said developers Welbeck Strategic Land had done \"just about enough\" to make the scheme acceptable.\n\nUltimately, however, committee members felt this balance fell differently, concluding that the development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\n\nREAD MORE: The best beer garden in Sussex as voted for by SussexLive readers revealed\n\nThe site is adjacent to land which is already under development as part of a previously approved scheme. That scheme, known as the Rosemead Farm development, was first approved in 2016 with 123 houses expected to be built on site.\n\nFirst submitted in June last year, the plans stated 16 of the 46 properties would be affordable homes. Dozens of objections to the proposals from Horam residents can be seen on Wealden council's planning portal.\n\nBianca Wilson, of Cornflower Avenue, claimed Horam does not have the infrastructure to deal with another 46 homes as its schools and GP surgeries are \"already saturated\". She said: \"The village home that everyone loves will be lost. Access to these houses will need to go through Rosemead view causing disruption and pollution.\"\n\nSally Eves-Dann, of Poppy Drive, said increased traffic through the Rosemead estate could result in more accidents as children enjoy playing in the area. \"The increase in traffic will involve going down the road and past the park where a large amount of vulnerable individuals will be using this area, further increasing the likelihood of injury,\" her objection in July last year reads.\n\n\"In additional [sic] to this the infrastructure already in place is struggling to meet the demands of village and this will only place more demands on the already stretched services.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:"
