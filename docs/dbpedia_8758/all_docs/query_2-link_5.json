        "text": "Parliamentary constituency, 1983–2024\n\nWealden was a constituency[n 1] in East Sussex in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. It was represented by members of the Conservative Party since its creation in 1983. Its final MP from 2015 to 2024, Nus Ghani, is the first Muslim woman to be elected as a Conservative member of Parliament.\n\nFurther to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished. Subject to boundary changes - including losing the town of Uckfield to the newly created constituency of East Grinstead and Uckfield, and gaining the smaller town of Heathfield in part compensation - it will be reformed as Sussex Weald, to be first contested at the 2024 general election.\n\nThis seat was created in the third periodic review of constituencies in 1983, from a mixture of the previous Mid and Northern divisions of East Sussex (also known as Lewes and East Grinstead).\n\nPolitical history\n\nThe seat's history is that of a safe Conservative seat. Before the 2015 election, the Liberal Democrats, including their two predecessor parties, were represented by the main opposition candidate, but they then fell to fourth place. The best result for the Labour Party was in 2017, though it was 39% below the winning vote share.\n\nProminent frontbenchers\n\nLocally born Charles Hendry served as a Minister of State in the Department of Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2012 following two years in the shadow role in opposition.\n\n1983–1997: The District of Wealden wards of Buxted, Chiddingly and East Hoathly, Crowborough East, Crowborough North, Crowborough West, Danehill, Fletching, Forest Row, Framfield, Frant, Hailsham Central and North, Hailsham East, Hailsham South and West, Hartfield, Heathfield, Hellingly, Horam, Maresfield, Mayfield, Rotherfield, Uckfield, Wadhurst, Waldron, and Withyam.\n\n1997–2010: The District of Wealden wards of Buxted, Chiddingly and East Hoathly, Crowborough East, Crowborough North, Crowborough St John's, Crowborough West, Danehill, Fletching, Forest Row, Framfield, Frant, Hailsham Central and North, Hailsham East, Hailsham South and West, Hartfield, Heathfield, Hellingly, Horam, Maresfield, Mayfield, Rotherfield, Uckfield, Wadhurst, Waldron, and Withyam.\n\n2010–2024: The District of Wealden wards of Buxted and Maresfield, Chiddingly and East Hoathly, Crowborough East, Crowborough Jarvis Brook, Crowborough North, Crowborough St John's, Crowborough West, Danehill/Fletching/Nutley, Forest Row, Framfield, Frant/Withyham, Hailsham Central and North, Hailsham East, Hailsham South and West, Hartfield, Hellingly, Horam, Mayfield, Rotherfield, Uckfield Central, Uckfield New Town, Uckfield North, Uckfield Ridgewood, and Wadhurst.\n\nThe constituency covered much of the Wealden district of East Sussex. However, some of the district in the south fell into the constituencies of Lewes, Bexhill and Battle and Eastbourne.\n\nApproximately half of the population in the constituency lived in the area's three main towns: Crowborough, Hailsham and Uckfield. The rest of the seat was predominantly rural and has many small towns, villages and hamlets. The Wealden landscape is varied, ranging from the Ashdown Forest in the north to the South Downs and the coastal part is included in seats to the south.\n\nA considerable portion of the population is retired or work in London, Brighton or other regional employment bases at a managerial or advanced professional level. Electoral Calculus describes the seat as \"Strong Right\" characterised by retired, socially conservative voters who strongly supported Brexit.[3]\n\nElection Member[4] Party 1983 Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith Conservative 2001 Charles Hendry Conservative 2015 Nus Ghani Conservative\n\nGeneral election 2019: Wealden[5] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 25,655 42.1 +3.1 Turnout 60,907 73.3 −1.0 Conservative hold Swing -4.4\n\nGeneral election 2017: Wealden[6] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 23,628 39.0 −1.3 Turnout 60,464 74.3 +3.3 Conservative hold Swing -3.6\n\nGeneral election 2015: Wealden[7] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 22,967 40.3 +9.0 Turnout 57,017 71.0 −0.8 Conservative hold Swing −5.8\n\nGeneral election 2010: Wealden[11] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 17,179 31.3 +2.7 Turnout 54,969 71.8 +5.5 Conservative hold Swing +2.8\n\nGeneral election 2005: Wealden Party Candidate Votes % Majority 15,921 28.6 +2.5 Turnout 55,653 67.7 +4.2 Conservative hold Swing +1.3\n\nGeneral election 2001: Wealden Party Candidate Votes % Majority 13,772 26.1 +2.0 Turnout 52,756 63.5 −10.2 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1997: Wealden Party Candidate Votes % Majority 14,204 24.1 −10.5 Turnout 59,099 73.7 −7.3 Conservative hold Swing\n\nThis constituency underwent boundary changes between the 1992 and 1997 general elections and thus change in share of vote is based on a notional calculation.\n\nGeneral election 1992: Wealden[12] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 20,931 34.6 −2.1 Turnout 60,358 81.0 +6.0 Conservative hold Swing −1.1\n\nGeneral election 1987: Wealden Party Candidate Votes % Majority 20,110 36.7 +2.1 Turnout 54,761 75.0 +3.2 Conservative hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1983: Wealden Party Candidate Votes % Majority 17,185 34.6 Turnout 49,727 71.8 Conservative win (new seat)\n\nList of parliamentary constituencies in East Sussex\n\nElection result, 2017 (BBC)\n\nElection result, 2010 (BBC)\n\nElection result, 2005 (BBC)\n\nElection results, 1997 - 2001 (BBC)\n\nElection results, 1997 - 2001 (Election Demon)\n\nElection results, 1983 - 1992 (Election Demon)\n\nElection results, 1992 - 2005 (Guardian)"
