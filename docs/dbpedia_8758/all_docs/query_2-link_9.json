Around 58% of the district is classed as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) The Pevensey levels and the Ashdown forest are internationally important and protected landscapes containing rare species. The beautiful and tranquil countryside within the south of the District is scattered with Ancient Woodland and is home to the River Cuckmere and tributaries that helps create the internationally important tourist attraction of the Seven Sisters Country Park in the South Downs National Park.\n\nThe CPRE group in Wealden works to protect these unique natural features and also promote the wellbeing of local communities.
