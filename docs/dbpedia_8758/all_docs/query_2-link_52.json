We’re pleased to say that we’ve been able to use the directional drilling method on these sections of work, which is a more efficient way to install the new pipeline.\n\nIn Middle Lane, we have installed the remaining section of pipework. This is currently being tested before we can connect customer services to the new main. We will also continue transferring customer services on sections of new main which have already passed testing.\n\nIn Cade Street/Battle Road, the latest section of installed main is currently being tested and once it has passed, we’ll be connecting the customer services on this section. Our working area here is currently just west of Chapel Lane.\n\nWe would also like to inform you that Liz Faulkner is no longer our Customer Liaison Officer, having had to leave suddenly and unexpectedly. We are, however, pleased to introduce Helen Tucker, who will be taking on the role. Helen has previously filled this position and so is experienced in providing support to customers during our engineering schemes.\n\nShould any customers in your community require any support or have any questions about the works, Helen can be reached on 07866 126589.\n\nWealden Volunteering at the Parish Council offices\n\nPop in to see Wealden Volunteering at the Parish Council office every Thursday from 9.45 to 12.45\n\nWealden Local Plan Response\n\nClick here to view Heathfield and Waldron Parish Council's response\n\nMinerals and Waste Policy Consultation\n\nEast Sussex County Council, the South Downs National Park Authority and Brighton & Hove City Council work jointly to prepare Minerals and Waste Local Plan for East Sussex, Brighton & Hove and the South Downs National Park within those areas. This plan is used when deciding whether to grant or refuse planning permission, and guides where development happens. The Authorities are in the process of reviewing the Minerals and Waste Local Plan and this involves a series of consultation. This is the website where you will find those consultations: https://eastsussex-consult.objective.co.uk/\n\nPublic Spaces Protection Order\n\nHeathfield and Waldron Parish Council supports Wealden District Council's renewal of their Public Spaces Protection Order which applies to any person in control of a dog and their failure to remove the faeces from restricted land, unless the person in control of the dog has a reasonable excuse for failing to do so.\n\nThe restricted land includes:-\n\nAny highway, footway, footpaths, twittens, promenades, steps and towpaths within the area of Wealden District Council and any adjoining verges or ornamental areas, which are maintained at the public expense.\n\nAll pedestrianised areas within the Wealden District Council area\n\nAll parks, gardens, recreation and sports grounds, commons, amenity areas and other open spaces owned, occupied or maintained by or on behalf of any of: Wealden District Council, East Sussex County Council, a registered social landlord/housing association, any town or parish council within the Wealden area, any other public authority or charity.\n\nAny cemetery, crematorium, burial ground or churchyard.\n\nAny public car-park or parking space.\n\nAll dog faeces must be picked up immediately and deposited in a suitable receptacle.\n\nBarclays Banking Hub\n\nBarclays Bank will be in the Parish Council offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 930-1300 and 1330-1500 and the facility will be available by appointment only. Banking facilities will however not be available. The contact details for arranging an appointment are 03457 345 345.\n\nPriority Services Register - free support service to help people in vulnerable situations\n\nPlease click here for more information.\n\nJunction of A267 and B2102\n\nEast Sussex County Council Highways department’s response to the public petition which asked for improved safety measures in the area of the junction of the A267 and B2102 at Cross in Hand acknowledged that work was needed. However, based on scoring criteria the location was ranked 53rd in priority by comparison to other sites in East Sussex. The Highways department informed the Parish Council that there are insufficient funds available to do anything at this location. In response the Parish Council submitted a request for a speed reduction in the vicinity of the junction to 30 mph and the introduction of vehicle activated signage.\n\nThe Highways department subsequently concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a change to the existing speed limit or such signage. The Parish Council has asked for that decision to be revisited for reasons set out in its letter sent to the Highways department and awaits a reply."
