The lakeside cafe is lovely and well worth a visit. The Cukkoo trail nearby is a brilliant walk or bike ride venue and the village cafe is a great place to stop for refreshments.\n\nDisliked: The bathroom block is looking a little tired and as it was a busy weekend was in need of an extra clean and toilet roll re stock as it had run out on two occasions.\n\nRecommend to friends Visit again\n\nLiked: Helpful staff. Clean toilet Fridge is available on a first come, first serve basis. Quiet camp. Few minutes drive to the Eastbourne beaches.\n\nDisliked: Some campers were using a campfire but stopped by the park rangers. We went out for a day and came back with cars park3d in our pitches near to our tents. Spoken to the owners but are not happy with us. Please be strict in implementing the parking of cars next to your tent/pitch only.\n\nRecommend to friends Visit again\n\nLiked: We stayed at the campsite for four nights. The caretakers are a married couple who are so friendly and welcoming. Both work hard to keep the camp, toilets and shower block clean which at times I can see is a challenge due to selfish people not clearing up after themselves. I really recommend staying here as it is in a beautiful part of the country and the fishing lakes attached to the campsite are amazing. We saw a herd of deer drinking from a lake. Dogs are very welcome. Our children loved staying here and as long as the weather looks good my husband and I will return on our own next month. Thank you for having us and for your warm welcome\n\nDisliked: Nothing\n\nRecommend to friends Visit again\n\nLiked: A lovely site, the facilities are kept clean, at every point throughout our stay. As the week went on and more people arrived, the standards never dropped. Nice large family room for those with younger children. As well as a freezer to refreeze blocks as needed. Quiet times where adhered to, which made it easy to settle down in the evening. The staff are lovely, and happy to answer any questions, as well as securing peoples belongings when the wind picked up during the day. Will definitely be back.\n\nRecommend to friends Visit again\n\nLiked: Plaats was ruim op gras. Mensen vriendelijk. Sanitair eenvoudig, schoon op de vloer na.\n\nRecommend to friends Visit again\n\nLiked: Magnificent place to stay would recommend; Its the 2nd time we stayed here in our motorhome ; we always stop here because it is close to the Ferry ports ; after touring for 6 weeks it’s the perfect place to relax ; it’s in a beautiful location; the hosts who manage this place are very welcoming and give you all information map on site and places you can eat ; the pitches are a very good size electric and water and waste disposal; the toilets are always clean ; the site is very presentable ; there’s lots of walks fishing and golf nearby and a short walk the bistro next to the fishing lake very nice place\n\nRecommend to friends Visit again"
