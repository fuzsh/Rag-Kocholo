        "text": "Councillor Nikos Mikelis said housing projections were based on Office for National Statistics (ONS) data from 2014 - not lower figures from 2018.\n\nHe said a target of 1,221 new homes per year in Wealden was \"unrealistic\".\n\nThe government said the old data gives \"stability\", but it was up to councils to set their own housing targets.\n\nMr Mikelis, from Chiddingly, said villages are being expanded into towns without the necessary infrastructure, and 24 parishes agreed.\n\nDavid Dyke lives close to a new development of 123 houses in Horam.\n\nHe said: \"We're just about saturated. They talk about availability of school places, which there aren't. The doctors' surgery is swamped, of course. And the roads aren't coping.\"\n\nAnn Newton, cabinet member for planning at Wealden District Council, said: \"The district is one of the biggest in the country in geographical miles, but pushing 60% of it is protected, an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\n\"That leaves only about 40% of developable land. To squash 1,200 houses a year into that is just wrong.\"\n\nBexhill and Battle MP, Huw Merriman, said the whole the system is broken and \"not working for anyone\".\n\nHe said: \"We don't have enough homes, particularly for young people to get on the housing ladder. Wages are low here. The house prices are really expensive.\n\n\"But what's really important is that we don't just build them hotchpotch in the green fields.\"\n\nThe Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities said in a statement: \"The standard method for assessing local housing need is only the starting point in the process of planning for new homes.\n\n\"Councils, not central government, set their own housing targets in their local plan."
