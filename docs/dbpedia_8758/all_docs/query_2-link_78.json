        "text": "Wealden District Council’s Housing Service has chosen TPTracker as its preferred solution for a Tenant/Resident Participation IT system, enabling them to contact, manage and record participation with their tenants and other residents in the district.\n\nWDC owns and manages its own stock of around 3,000 homes in East Sussex and also manages some housing association properties, leasehold flats, retirement homes and shared ownership properties.\n\nWDC particularly liked the way TPTracker is easy to use, with information entered and extracted in just a few easy clicks.\n\nProfiling and lookups\n\nIn addition to a wide and flexible range of personal profiling fields, they will use TPTracker to store information on what activities people want to get involved in (e.g. rents, repairs, allocations), how they want to get involved (e.g. attend a focus group, attend meetings) and how they want WDC to contact them (e.g. letter, text).\n\nCommunicating with tenants\n\nTPTracker will also provide a range of multi-channel communication tools for producing merged letters, texting or emailing the people directly from the software without the need to extract data and in just a few clicks. The software will then identify people if a response is required or if they have not responded so that communications can be followed up. TPTracker will automatically collate replies and analyse them to produce reports, breaking down the information collected as required.\n\nManaging and evaluating participation\n\nFor participation activities, TPTracker will collect, store, analyse and report on a whole range of activities (e.g. estate walkabouts, meetings, fund raising activities) including profiling the participants. This will include information on costs, staff time, other inputs and outcomes. From these records TPTracker will automatically evidence the impact/value of an activity or group of activities.\n\nLinked to core database\n\nWDC uses Orchard as its main housing management system and TPTracker will accept regular automated data uploads from Orchard to maintain the core database of tenants, leaseholders and service users. Records relating to non-tenants can also be added directly into the TPTracker database.\n\nWDC’s use of TPTracker is covered by a single annual license for the council as a whole, with unlimited users and including support."
