        "text": "Our Blackboys Habitat Bank lies across more than 16 hectares of land in rural East Sussex where we are transforming the existing sheep-grazed pasture fields into a stunning mosaic of species-rich grassland, lowland meadows, mixed scrub, woodland, and ponds.\n\nThe site will provide habitats for a range of notable and declining species, including hedgehogs, serotine bats, great crested newts, and hazel dormice.\n\nFollowing a thorough assessment of the site's vegetation, wildlife, geology, hydrology, soil chemistry, management history, and landscape connectivity, we determined the best possible habitats to establish and made sure these enhancements would be deliverable. We established an ecological baseline for the site using Defra’s biodiversity metric, so we can clearly demonstrate biodiversity gains over time.\n\nThis assessment enables us to generate a range of high-integrity Biodiversity Unit habitat types that will ensure robust ecological outcomes. We also offer planning support to make sure our Biodiversity Units provide an effective local BNG delivery solution for developers within the Wealden District Council LPA area or High Weald NCA. Our Units are ready to purchase now, subject to availability.\n\nThe Habitat Bank is strategically located so we can connect existing parcels of ancient woodland within the surrounding area. Woodland creation is one of the key opportunities identified in the High Weald National Character Area in which the Habitat Bank resides.\n\nBy connecting these ancient woodland parcels located at Browning Wood – an area listed within the Ancient Woodland Inventory – we’re creating better ecological connectivity on a broader scale, providing natural stepping stones for key species to travel and build in abundance.\n\nThe site has multiple public access points and rights of way (PRoW). We’re really excited for the local community to be able to visit, to witness the habitats develop over the coming decade, and to observe many notable and protected species of wildlife as they grow in abundance. It is hoped that sightings of species such as white admiral, grass snake, and bullfinch will become commonplace."
