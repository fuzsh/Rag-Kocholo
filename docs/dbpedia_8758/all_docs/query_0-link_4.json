        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis profile should be used to inform decisions and plans and to identify priorities to improve local people’s health and reduce health inequalities in Wealden.\n\nThe profile identifies needs (which may also be referred to or seen as deficits) as well as assets (which may also be referred to or seen as strengths) from key indicators that have been bench marked against the England average.\n\nCauses of premature mortality and inequalities in life expectancy are also presented.\n\nThis profile forms part of the East Sussex Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) and draws together data and analysis from East Sussex public health reports and various health profiles produced by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. It brings together existing data and analysis, from a variety of sources, at Primary Care Networks (PCNs), district/borough councils and East Sussex levels.\n\nDisease & poor health\n\nDisability\n\nIn the 2021 Census Wealden had 27,629 people with a Limited long-term illness. This is projected to increase to 41,598 an increase of 51% by 2035. The highest in East Sussex.\n\nThe projected overall disability in 2020 was 24,881. This is projected to increase to 34,330 by 2035.\n\nPlease note: Disability living allowance (DLA) & Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - all claimants, May 2021.\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures. Limited Long-Term illness – 2011 ; Projected LLTI ; Projected overall disability ; Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Personal Independence Payments (PIP)\n\nQuality & Outcomes framework\n\nTable 8 shows extracts from the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) for 2022/23.\n\nData within the QOF is not aged standardised and so some areas of high or low prevalence may in some part be a result of the age demographics of the area. It is important to understand more about the demography when interpreting this data. Office for Health Improvement and Disparities have produced some National General Practice area profiles for PCNs, which include a “Data View” of the population.\n\nTable 8 GP reported disease prevalence for each Primary Care Network in East Sussex, 2022/23\n\nView table 8 as a larger table pdf 106kb\n\nTo see what geographical footprints the Primary Care Networks cover see Map 4 in the “Primary Care Network” section of this document.\n\nHealth related behaviours\n\nSmoking\n\nWealden has significantly better smoking prevalence compared to England.\n\nTable 11 Smoking prevalence and quit rates between 2019 and 2021\n\nAlcohol\n\nWealden has significantly better rates of alcohol-related admissions apart from females which is similar to England, and rates of alcohol-specific mortality compared to England.\n\nTable 12 Alcohol between 2017 and 2022\n\nPhysical activity & healthy eating\n\nWealden is significantly better than England for the percentage of physically inactive adults and the proportion of the population meeting the recommended \"5 a day\".\n\nFor all other indicators Wealden is similar when compared to England.\n\nTable 13 Physical activity and healthy eating between 2019 and 2022\n\nSexual health\n\nCompared to England, new STI diagnoses (which exclude chlamydia in under 25 year olds) are significantly lower in Wealden.\n\nCompared to England, the chlamydia detection rates in people aged 15 to 24 years is significantly worse in Wealden.\n\nTable 14 Sexual health between 2020 and 2022\n\nDrug & Alcohol treatment\n\nWealden has significantly lower rates of adults in drug and/or alcohol treatment and for young people in drug or alcohol treatment.\n\nTable 15 Drug and alcohol treatment between 2020 and 2022\n\nScreening & immunisation\n\nData for immunisation is only presented at East Sussex County level. For all childhood immunisations East Sussex is below the 95% goal for vaccination and significantly below the goal for DTaP and IPV booster in 5 year olds.\n\nA significantly higher percentage of 65+ year olds received their seasonal flu vaccination in East Sussex compared to the 75% goal for vaccination cover.\n\nTable 16a Immunisations between 2019 and 2022\n\nTable 16b Screening between 2021 and 2022\n\nView table 16b as a larger table\n\nGreater Wealden, High Weald, Eastbourne East, and Victoria Eastbourne all have a significantly higher percentage of eligible 60-74 year olds screened for bowel cancer. High Weald, Greater Wealden and Eastbourne East also have a significantly higher percentage of 25-49 year olds screened for cervical cancer compared to England.\n\nHealth & social care services\n\nMaternity\n\nWealden has a better percentage of mothers breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks, compared to England.\n\nDeliveries to teenage mothers are better for Wealden compared to England.\n\nTable 17 Pregnancy and birth between 2017 and 2021\n\nHospital attendance\n\nResidents in Wealden use East Sussex Healthcare Trust (ESHT) the most, but also are more likely than the rest of East Sussex to use Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust as well as elsewhere.\n\nHospital activity\n\nWealden has the highest level of hospital activity compared to the other districts and boroughs in East Sussex because it has the largest population.\n\nNumbers of A&E attendances (which includes attendances at Urgent Treatment Centres and Minor Injury Units) are highest in Wealden.\n\nChart 26 Number of emergency admissions, 12-year trends, for East Sussex districts/boroughs, 2011/12 to 2022/23\n\nChart 27 Number of elective admissions, 12-year trend for East Sussex districts/boroughs, 2011/12 to 2022/23\n\nChart 28 Number of first outpatient attendances, 12-year trend for East Sussex districts/boroughs, 2011/12 to 2022/23\n\nChart 29 Number of A&E attendances, East Sussex districts/boroughs, 2018/19 to 2022/23\n\nHospital activity - age specific rates & by deprivation\n\nIn terms of children and young people, rates of emergency admissions and outpatient and A&E attendances are highest in the under 5s and then drop for 5-9 years olds who tend to have the lowest rates across all age bands.\n\nRates are highest across all activity types in older people. For electives and outpatient attendances rates begin to decrease round the age of 80 years, which is generally not the case for urgent care.\n\nChart 30 Age-specific rates of emergency admissions, 2022/23\n\nChart 31 Age-specific rates of elective admissions, 2022/23\n\nChart 32 Age-specific rates of first outpatient attendances, 2022/23\n\nChart 33 Age-specific rates of A&E attendances, 2022/23\n\nThere is a clear association of higher emergency admissions with increasing levels of deprivation and a widening of the gap in admission rates between the most and least deprived areas. Historically this was the case with elective admissions and outpatient attendances, although in more recent years this has not necessarily been the case and in 2022/23 all areas experienced similar rates.\n\nA&E attendance rates are highest in the most derived quintile followed by the second most deprived quintile, with the rest of East Sussex experiencing similar rates.\n\nChart 34 Age-standardised rates of emergency admissions by deprivation, 2011/12 to 2022/23\n\nChart 35 Age-standardised rates of elective admissions by deprivation, 2011/12 to 2022/23\n\nChart 36 Age-standardised rates of 1st outpatient attendances by deprivation, 2012/13 to 2022/23\n\nChart 37 Age-standardised rates of A&E attendances by deprivation, 2018/19 to 2022/23\n\nLeading cause of admissions\n\nThere are differences in the main causes of emergency admissions by age group.\n\nRespiratory conditions are the leading cause of emergency admissions in under 5s followed by infectious and parasitic diseases.\n\nIn children and young people aged 5-19 years the leading cause of emergency admissions is signs, symptoms and abnormal clinical/laboratory findings (very closely followed by injuries due to unintentional or deliberate harm).\n\nIn adults the leading cause of emergency admissions is signs, symptoms and abnormal clinical/laboratory findings.\n\nAdult social care caseload\n\nWealden has the lowest rate of new contacts with Adult Social Care for both adults (18-64) and older people (65+) age groups.\n\nChart 38 - Total number of new contacts as a rate per 100,000 population, 2021/22\n\nWealden has a similar percentage for older people (65+) and adults (18-64) for 'new care' contacts progressing to a Social Care Assessment.\n\nChart 39 - 'New care' contacts from the community that have progressed to a Social Care Assessment, 2021/22\n\nWealden has a similar percentage of Social Care Assessment that resulted in Support Plans.\n\nChart 40 - Social Care Assessment that resulted in Support Plans, 2021/22\n\nWealden has the lowest rate of adults (16-64) and older people (65+) with at least one activity in a 12-month period.\n\nChart 41 – Number of people with at least one activity in a 12-month period as a rate per 100,000 population, 2021/22\n\nActivity relates to contacts, assessments, reviews, appearance of needs tools, other statutory work, and safeguarding episodes.\n\nNote: East Sussex data also includes clients that were unable to be allocated to a specific district/borough.\n\nWealden has a lower rate than East Sussex for persons receiving Long Term Support during 2021/22 for both adults and older people.\n\nChart 42 – Persons receiving Long Term Support per 1,000 population, 2021/22\n\nCSC caseload / Looked after children\n\nWealden has the lowest rates for child protection plans."
