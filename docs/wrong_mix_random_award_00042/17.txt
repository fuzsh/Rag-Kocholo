Loyola launched a new medical humanities minor, entitled Health and Human Experience, this fall. It was created to complement students’ pre-health studies in natural sciences or work as a meaningful unit own its own, relevant to all who are interested in topics such as history of medicine, bioethics, and global health. Health and Human Experience is an interdisciplinary humanities and social sciences minor that prepares students to understand cultural factors in health and delivery of care.
