        "text": "Alex Averbuch\n\nOleksandr (Alex) Averbuch, a native of Novoaidar, Luhans’k region, Ukraine (b. 1985), is a literary historian, poet, and translator. He is the author of three books of poetry and an array of literary translations between Hebrew, Ukrainian, English, and Russian. His poetry deals with the issues of ethnic fragmentation and in-betweenness, multiple identities, queerness, cross- and multilingualism, documentalist writing, and memory.
