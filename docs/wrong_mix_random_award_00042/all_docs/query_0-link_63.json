        "text": "Box Office Round Up - 04-01-2019\n\nBox Office Round Up - 04-01-2019 Us's top spot at the marquee was short lived, as Tim Burton's Dumbo emerged victorious in its debut weekend. A star-studded live action remake of the original 1941 animated classic, this is the first of a whopping four separate remakes Disney is planning to release this year, which includes Aladdin and The Lion King. Is it too late to put Danny DeVito in every single one of them? Dumbo may have taken the top spot, but it's still an underwhelming debut for such a big-budget affair. The film's middling reviews certainly won't have much of a positive word of mouth effect going forward, either. Hey, at least Tim Burton finally made a movie without Johnny Depp. Also debuting in a surprising fifth is the Christian drama Unplanned, based on the memoir of the same name by Abby Johnson. Marketing of the film has been extremely limited due to most TV channels refusing to air promotional material as a result of the film's explicit anti-abortion message. Furthermore, the filmmakers themselves wanted to keep most details secret to prevent protests. None of that prevented people from showing their support at the box office, with the movie already making back its budget and then some on its opening weekend. Regardless of where you stand on the issues, it's an impressive debut. See you next week! 1.

At CAA: Irish actor Andrew Scott, whose arc on Fleabag season 2 kicked his already acclaimed career into overdrive, has signed with a team that includes Ben Dey and Zach Kaplan. Other new signs for the agency include Black-ish standout Miles Brown, fashion designer Prabal Gurung, and YouTube sensation Game Grumps. At WME: Model, designer, entrepreneur and once-again Spice Girl Victoria Beckham has followed her husband David to WME, where she will be represented by Jon Rosen. Speaking of ahtletes who married supermodels (just go with it), Tom Brady has signed with WME for off-field representation, and will be handled by Jason Hodes. Music producer and DJ Marshmello is a new sign for the agency's music division. At UTA: The one and only Kathie Lee Gifford is a new sign for UTA, where she'll be repped by Theresa Peters. At ICM Partners: Actress Lara Pulver (Sherlock, Underworld: Blood Wars) has signed with Brian Mann and Chris Horsman. Elsewhere around town: Buchwald has signed past Oscar nominee Virginia Madsen, who will be represented by Ryan Martin. Actress and musician Torrey DeVitto has signed with Abrams Artists, and will be repped by Dan Moresco. We would be remiss not to point out that Coolio has signed with Stewart Talent for his theatrical work. Management and PR: Major news in the PR world: Rogers and Cowan and PMK*BNC are merging to form a single mega-agency handling all types of PR, from celebrity to film campaigns to brand management. While this development will reverberate throughout Hollywood, the companies were already both under the umbrella of parent company Interpublic Group, meaning the upheaval may not be as significant as in other mergers of this scope. Another intriguing development: Imagine Entertainment, the Hollywood stalwart founded by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, has added a talent management division. Imagine Artist Management will be run by former Jax Media exec Tony Hernandez, and has already recruited veteran managers Kara Welker and Dave Rath, as well as talent agents Raj Raghavan and D.C. Wade. In other news, former WME agent Adam Gelvan has joined Rain Management Group, actress Kelli Garner has signed with More/Medavoy, and Mischa Barton, now a castmember on the rebooted The Hills, is with Untitled. Other PR signings include actors Maxwell Jenkins, Taylour Paige, Tyler Barnhardt, Nicholas and Cameron Crovetti and Travis Coles with Platform PR, and sisters Oona, Aimée and Jeté Laurence with Jill Fritzo PR.

At WME: WME certainly won the traditionally sleepy month of August in Hollywood. The agency announced the signings of no fewer than three major stars: Matthew McConaughey, Kristen Stewart and Ben Mendelsohn. Of the three, McConaughey may have the edge for household name, but Stewart is not far behind, and Mendelsohn has become one of the most in-demand supporting actors in Hollywood. McConaughey's new team includes Patrick Whitesell and Brent Morley, while Stewart is now repped by Elyse Sherz and Jessica Kovacevic. We're still waiting to confirm Mendelsohn's reps. Kristen Stewart is a particularly interesting sign, as she had spent her career to this point at Gersh, a much smaller agency by comparison. Many stars would have looked for representation at the big four immediately after landing a global phenomenon like Twilight, but Stewart stuck it out with Gersh as she pursued increasingly serious work. Now perhaps with Charlie's Angels on the horizon, she's ready to just be a big ol' movie star. At UTA: Producers, entrepreneurs, hosts and home improvement experts Chip and Joanna Gaines have brought their business to UTA, including their busy brand/production entity, Magnolia. They will be represented by a team that includes UTA head of alternative TV, Brett Hansen. BrookeAB is one of many signings UTA has made of late in the gaming/game-streaming arena. That division is spearheaded by Hana Tjia. At CAA: GMA co-host Sara Haines is a new sign for Kevin Huvane. At ICM Partners: Actress/musician/fashion icon Charlotte Gainsbourg has signed with a team that includes Carter Cohn, Craig Shapiro and Nathalie Didier.

Management and PR: Authentic Talent and Literary Management, a company that has been growing over the past several years, has added six new managers to its fold. Among them are ex-Untitled heavyweights Beth Holden-Garland and Michael Lazo, as well as former UTA agent Gennifer Lieber, former Generate manager Adam P. Segal, Avi Lipski (late of Brookside and Cinetic in New York), and Allie Veneris, who comes from Management 360. In addition, the company has made veteran managers Jane Berliner and Anne Woodward heads of the New York and LA offices, respectively. Woodward will share her duties with fellow manager Sean Elliott.
