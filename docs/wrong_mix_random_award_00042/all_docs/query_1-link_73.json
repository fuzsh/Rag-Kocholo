        "text": "For a while now—nearly three years, in fact—I’ve been meaning to log a small note about the movie “Nomadland” (2020). When it came out, and went on to win best picture at the Oscars, much was made, and rightly so, of what it said about the economics of life in the US today. Yet Frances McDormand’s character, Fern, is not destitute. She knows how to get work, and takes pride in doing it. She has a family that lives a “normal” life and could even settle down with David Strathairn’s character, Dave, if she wanted to. But something always draws her away from these things.\n\nIt’s been noted that the closing of the film contains an homage, and I would say a worthy one, to the end of “The Searchers” (1956), which depicts John Wayne’s character, Ethan Edwards, one of the great restless souls in American cinema, casting himself out from the settled home to “wander forever between the winds.” Yet Ethan is troubled and tortured—gutted by violence and hatred—in a way that doesn’t entirely suit Fern. And in pondering her character more I was reminded of this passage from Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book “Into the Wild” (p. 66), the true story of a young man, Chris McCandless, who would die in Alaska while following his own nomadic journey:\n\nMcCandless’s apparent sexual innocence . . . is a corollary of a personality type that our culture purports to admire, at least in the case of its more famous adherents. His ambivalence toward sex echoes that of celebrated others who embraced wilderness with singled-minded passion—Thoreau (who was a lifelong virgin) and the naturalist John Muir, most prominently—to say nothing of countless lesser-known pilgrims, seekers, misfits, and adventurers. Like not a few of those seduced by the wild, McCandless seems to have been driven by a variety of lust that supplanted sexual desire. His yearning, in a sense, was too powerful to be quenched by human contact. McCandless may have been tempted by the succor offered by women, but it paled beside the prospect of rough congress with nature, with the cosmos itself. . . .\n\nThis is all, of course, speculation on Krakauer’s part. So I wouldn’t want to endorse it entirely—much less apply it to Fern’s story—as if it’s simply a fact of life. But I do think he says something honest here about the desire for solitude—healthy or not—and the role that nature often plays when we act on those urges. There can be great peace in that “rough congress,” even if it passeth the understanding of other humans.\n\nPosted by Andrew Ivers\n\nSo a few months back (as I mentioned at the time) I rewatched “Breach,” the 2007 movie about the infamous FBI double agent Robert Hanssen. It’s the kind of story—and Hanssen, played by Chris Cooper, is the kind of character—filled with little details that stick in your brain. And being something of a stationery connoisseur, one that lingered with me was Hanssen’s love for the Pilot Dr. Grip pen. He doesn’t mention it by name, he just holds one up and declares: “These are the greatest pens in the world. I would never write with anything else.” At the time I couldn’t identify it myself, but leave it to the internet to be discussing this minuscule moment in multiple places. Naturally, I ordered two for myself—a blue ballpoint and a black gel (according to this post, Hanssen seems to have favored the Ice Blue gel)—and I’m delighted to report that they are, in fact, excellent pens. I particularly like how precise, smooth, and reliable the ballpoint (medium tip) has been so far. Having enjoyed Pilot products before, this was not a total surprise. But I still never expected to get such a stellar recommendation from an espionage movie. It has even inspired me to revisit another (rather cold) case of cinema stationery: for years I’ve been trying to get any info I can about the drafting paper used by Washington Post reporters in the 1970s. You can see it in both “All the President’s Men” (1976), which was famously rigorous about newsroom details, and “The Post” (2017). It features thick red stripes down the margins, with white page numbers set in them. I don’t expect to ever lay my hands on any of it personally, but I’m always intrigued by an interesting design with a specialized function.\n\nUpdate. Sep 15th — I didn’t have time to dig one up the other day, but here now is a nice clear shot of that elusive copy paper, as seen in “The Post”:\n\nPosted by Andrew Ivers\n\nConsider these lines from Book VI of “Paradise Lost” (662–671):\n\nThe rest in imitation to like arms\n\nBetook them and the neighboring hills uptore:\n\nSo hills amid the air encountered hills\n\nHurled to and fro with jaculation dire\n\nThat under ground they fought in dismal shade,\n\nInfernal noise. War seemed a civil game\n\nTo this uproar. Horrid confusion heaped\n\nUpon confusion rose and now all Heav’n\n\nHad gone to wrack with ruin overspread\n\nHad not th’ Almighty Father . . .\n\nThis is, in part, Milton’s telling of the battle for Heaven between Satan’s rebel forces and those still loyal to God. But doesn’t it also sound like a nightmare from more recent times, when everyone feared the possibility of nuclear war between the superpowers—often referred to euphemistically, and quite un-poetically, as an “exchange”? One sees the rockets passing each other overhead; the warriors driven beneath the earth; the utter destruction making all other combat seem quaint. Milton even tells us that this super-fighting threatens to lay waste the world of Heaven itself—until God intervenes. But of course that is not how our version would have ended.\n\nPosted by Andrew Ivers\n\nIt’s only taken about fifteen years, but I’ve finally figured out why I recognize the actor (Mark Moses) who plays Duck Phillips in “Mad Men”: he’s also the inept lieutenant in “Platoon.” I feel like I’m either the first or the absolute last moviegoer to put this together. Oddly, Moses is also in one of my favorite little moments from that film. The hick grunt played by Kevin Dillon tries to impress/intimidate him by ripping a bite from an empty beer can and handing it to him. Bemused, he politely says, “Terrific—I’ll send it home…” Like it’s a trophy of war or something. It’s just such a funny response to a ridiculous gesture. And, to be honest, very satisfying to quote from time to time.\n\nPosted by Andrew Ivers\n\nThe famed FBI double-crosser Robert Hanssen died in prison earlier this week, which seemed like a good excuse to revisit “Breach,” the 2007 movie about his downfall. I hadn’t seen it since it came out and I’m pleased to report it still holds up. The cast is small but strong—led by Chris Cooper, Ryan Phillippe, and Laura Linney—and the story is tight and compelling. There’s also some great DC location shooting, if you’re into that kind of thing. (I wasn’t surprised to learn that writer/director Billy Ray was behind “Shattered Glass,” too—another fun movie about real-life Washington intrigue from a few years earlier.) Apparently CBS made a TV movie about Hanssen as well: “Master Spy,” which aired in November 2002. According to IMDB, it’s over three hours long (or at least Lawrence Schiller’s director’s cut is?), features a screenplay by Norman Mailer (yes, that Norman Mailer), and stars William Hurt, Mary-Louise Parker, Ron Silver, David Strathairn, Peter Boyle, and Wayne Knight. There seem to be a couple different versions on YouTube right now. Could make for an interesting weekend project.\n\nPosted by Andrew Ivers\n\n* * *\n\nAs some of you have heard, my father died in February at the age of seventy-eight. Today, after much dithering and distraction on my part, his newspaper obituary finally ran in the Post-Dispatch. The text is below, and an image of the print edition is above. Given his longstanding affection for the English, I think he would have appreciated being accompanied by the coronation news out of London. Also: as I prepared this post, I just happened to find “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” on TV—maybe his all-time favorite movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon. He would have appreciated that, too. Finally, one omission needs amending here: Mom and Dad were married for forty-one years, since December 1981. I forgot to include that detail in the final text we submitted. –AI\n\n* * *\n\nIvers, Anthony Elliott\n\nTony Ivers died Feb. 18, 2023, beloved husband of Mary Julia (née Holloran), father of James Andrew and Robert Patrick (Mary), and brother-in-law of Eileen Heidenheimer (Arnold, 1929-2001). Preceded in death by his brother Deane Niven, 1956-2018. Born in St. Louis on Christmas Day 1944, he was a lifelong South Sider and proud member of the “Fairview Five.” After taking degrees (BS, Math, SEMO, 1966; MS, Computer Science, MU Rolla, 1967; MA, Prob/Stats, Mizzou, 1969), he spent over 30 years as a systems programmer and analyst at McDonnell Douglas, later Boeing. A natural puzzle-solver, he loved stamp-collecting, Legos, Sudoku, and board games with friends. In youth, and later on family trips, he relished hiking and touring the West, especially Colorado. Fascinated by art, he painted, enjoyed movies, attended the symphony, and perfected a library of classical and rock vinyl. He rarely missed a Cardinals game, and cherished memories of their old football counterparts. And for years he always had a Springer Spaniel by his side. He’s now part of the cosmos about which he loved to ask questions. Memorial gathering T.B.A.\n\nPosted by Andrew Ivers"
