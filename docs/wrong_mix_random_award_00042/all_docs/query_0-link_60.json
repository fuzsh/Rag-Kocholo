        "text": "If you haven't checked out \"Reacher,\" stop what you're doing, head over to Prime Video, and stream every episode pronto. Seriously, this action-packed mystery thriller series checks all the right boxes for modern-day entertainment. Action? Check. Drama? Check. Romance? Check. A charismatic lead character? Double check. Carefully constructed narrative with shocking revelations around every corner? Check. \"Reacher\" has it all.\n\nAside from a few missteps, the series expertly captures the tone and feel of Lee Child's violent, muscular hero who always wins thanks to his imposing stature, impeccable fighting abilities, and sharp investigative instincts. Starring Alan Ritchson as Jack Reacher, an ex-Army investigator who spends his days wandering the Earth, dishing out justice for those in need, \"Reacher\" finds our hero tasked with taking down various evil plots and conspiracies, first using his brain, and then his fists.\n\nViolent, bold, but always fun, \"Reacher\" pulls no punches. But if you've already binged the series, just know that there's more where that came from. These shows also provide violent, addictive thrills — and will keep you occupied until the Prime Video series returns with more episodes.\n\nThose looking for more kick-a** military action in the vein of \"Reacher\" should check out Amazon's other flagship series, \"Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan.\" John Krasinski stars as Clancy's iconic hero (previously played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck, and Chris Pine), who zips all over the globe in a bid to stop terrorists from committing atrocities on innocent civilians. Like Reacher, Ryan's brains match his brawn. The first three seasons continually pit him against dangerous enemies immune to reason. Lucky for us, that results in hard-hitting action sequences peppered with enough intelligence to make the endless explosions seem pertinent.\n\nUnlike \"Reacher,\" \"Jack Ryan\" regrettably deviates from Clancy's novels, choosing instead to chart its own course. Too often, Ryan runs rampant in the field like a character ripped straight from the \"Call of Duty\" video game franchise, a far cry from the desk-riding analyst found in the novels. While purists may balk, \"Jack Ryan\" still offers high-quality entertainment and gives Krasinski plenty of room to flash his natural charisma. Don't think about it too much; you'll have a blast.\n\nNobody beats Jack Bauer. For eight seasons, Kiefer Sutherland's gritty, hard-nosed patriot won us over with his no-holds-barred approach to stopping enemies (foreign and domestic) in Fox's \"24.\" Sure, the twists became more ludicrous with every episode, but \"24\" practically wrote the book on binge-watching.\n\nDespite the silly plot beats (everyone, at some point, turns out to be a mole), Sutherland's character is always watchable. Bauer's violent tendencies mirror Reacher's. Indeed, it's not hard to imagine the pair working side-by-side to take down corrupt government officials or seedy criminals with nothing to lose. The deeper Bauer digs into the vast conspiracies around him, the more dangers he uncovers, with numerous enemies sitting atop the political battlefield.\n\nComparatively, where Reacher's adventures are smaller in scale, Bauer rubs shoulders with the President of the United States and other government officials. He often goes rogue and must contend with powerful villains like Nina Myers, Habib Marwan, Charles Logan, and Cheng Zi, each with an eye on global chaos. It's all silly fun, and Sutherland's incredible award-winning performance grounds the insanity, even when the plot completely rolls off the tracks.\n\n\"24\" is far from an artistic masterpiece, but it satisfies as easily digestible, incredibly addictive fast-food entertainment.\n\nSpeaking of \"24,\" the creators of that popular series, Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon, reteamed for Showtime's \"Homeland\" with equally impressive results. Starring Claire Danes, Damian Lewis, Mandy Patinkin, and Rupert Friend, this action-packed series chronicles the exploits of Carrie Mathison (Danes), a brilliant but troubled CIA agent, as she thwarts terrorists and other threats to global peace.\n\nIn Season 1, Carrie believes that recently returned Marine Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Lewis) has switched sides and plans to attack the U.S. Unfortunately, her bipolar condition and inability to control her emotional outbursts make the other agents, including her mentor, Saul (Patinkin), frequently question her conclusions. It's fascinating stuff, and it only gets better. People are tortured and executed gruesomely, bombs go off daily, characters fall in love, then break up dramatically, and Claire Danes cries — a lot. Like \"Reacher,\" \"Homeland\" doesn't play nice and isn't afraid to toss its audience about on a wild rollercoaster of emotions. Sure, there are a few bumps along the way, but the strong performances, shocking twists, and carefully constructed characters ensure hours of thrilling entertainment.\n\nWarning: Don't start \"Homeland\" unless you're ready to binge all eight seasons. Once you start, it's really hard to stop. Trust me.\n\nOn the surface, \"Bosch\" looks like any other procedural cop drama. Look closer, and you'll find a complex character study of LAPD detective Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver) and his attempts to circumvent the law to bring criminals to justice. Featuring a stellar cast that includes the late, great Lance Reddick, Jamie Hector, Madison Lintz, Amy Aquino, and Mimi Rogers, along with intense shootouts and thrilling fights scenes, \"Bosch\" has everything fans of \"Reacher\" could ask for.\n\nThat said, \"Bosch\" requires patience to appreciate fully. Each season sets up a captivating mystery and a handful of sprawling storylines that may be difficult to follow. Stick with it because the payoff is always worth it. Since \"Bosch\" is based on a popular book series written by Michael Connelly, you can head into the various seasons knowing the writers have a guideline to work from and aren't making up plot points on the spot (as was often the case with \"24\" and \"Homeland\"), leading to plenty of bizarre creative decisions. That's not to say \"Bosch\" sidesteps plot holes or contrivances. Sometimes, the show veers towards unbelievability, but that's part of the fun.\n\nUltimately, \"Bosch\" gives viewers an old-school detective thriller featuring a character who, like Reacher, seems to have magically appeared out of a bygone era.\n\nAt its core, \"Reacher\" is, ostensibly, a Western. A drifter wanders into a small town run by corrupt people, bringing with him swift justice. As such, it makes sense to include \"Longmire\" on this list, as it follows the same plot beats. Still, it sets its tale in the fictional town of Absaroka County, Wyoming. \"Longmire\" is very much a Western in the traditional sense. Our hero, the grizzled but honorable Sheriff Walt Longmire (Robert Taylor), wanders about solving mysteries alongside the locals. He runs into problems regarding the local casino, Native Americans, and the government. He struggles to maintain the peace while adhering to his moral code.\n\nLike \"Reacher,\" \"Longmire\" doesn't break new ground in the mystery department. You've seen much of this show before. Yet, where the series succeeds is in the handling of its central star. Longmire is a good man who values honor. Still, he's also flawed, particularly in how he consistently attacks his rival, Jacob Nighthorse (A Martinez). That means everyone, including Walt, Nighthorse, Victoria Moretti (Katie Sackhoff), and Henry Standing Bear (Lou Diamond Phillips), goes through complex psychological character arcs and arrives at a better point than when we first met them.\n\nEndearing, gritty, but full of heart, \"Longmire\" is terrific television that will dazzle viewers the cows come home.\n\nRemember when Marvel dominated Netflix with shows like \"Daredevil,\" \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Iron Fist,\" and \"Luke Cage?\" While the MCU continues to show its dominance on Disney+, none of its recent offerings match the grittiness of these initial efforts. That's too bad because Marvel tapped into something unique with these entries, which functioned as comic books for grownups.\n\nOf course, the most prominent example remains \"The Punisher,\" which didn't shy away from bloody violence or hard-hitting chaos. Our hero revels in bloodshed, blasting enemies to bits with his guns or beating them to a pulp with his fists. Here is a man with zero tolerance for tomfoolery who would rather go out in a blaze of glory than see a criminal saved by the law. Star Jon Bernthal infuses the iconic comic book anti-hero with ferocity. Like Reacher, the Punisher yearns for peace and solidarity but knows that our world doesn't provide such gifts without a fight.\n\nSadly, \"The Punisher\" lasted just two seasons, but there are rumors of a revival on Disney+. Fingers crossed because we all need a little more Frank Castle mayhem in our lives.\n\nBefore he was Homelander on \"The Boys,\" Antony Starr was racking up kills as Lucas Hood in \"Banshee,\" perhaps the most extreme entry on this list. When I say extreme, I mean extreme. Brace yourselves for gruesome action during which people get their windpipes pulled from their throats, shotguns blow holes through bodies, and heads explode like watermelons. If that weren't enough, \"Banshee\" features sex scenes shocking enough to ensure your viewing experience rises to optimum levels of awkwardness.\n\nThat said, \"Banshee\" works even without the needless excess. \"Banshee\" is about a man with no name who assumes the identity of the recently deceased town sheriff, a title that allows him to use his unethical practices to keep the town of Banshee, Pennsylvania, at bay. From the brilliant cast to the multilayered storylines and eye-popping action, \"Banshee\" sticks with you long after the credits roll.\n\nBe forewarned. This show is not for the faint of heart. Characters die in creative, always disgusting ways, while the humor is often pitch black. Yet, you come to care about these people and cheer when they win and mourn when they die. Honestly, the best advice I can give anyone who sets out to watch \"Banshee\" is to buckle up because you're in for a ride! Think of it as \"Reacher\" multiplied by about 50, and you might know what to expect.\n\nAre you noticing a pattern here? The shows on this list feature compelling heroes who operate within that thin gray line between right and wrong and are often forced to make difficult choices to stop evil people from achieving their goals. \"Justified,\" the brilliant series based on stories written by Elmore Leonard that ran for six seasons on FX, is no exception.\n\n\"Justified\" follows Timothy Olyphant as Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, a man who lives by his own ethical code and is quick to draw his gun to protect the innocent. Naturally, his actions draw the attention of local bad guys, notably crime families, drug traders, corrupt cops, and the like, resulting in showdowns ripped straight from the legendary films of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood.\n\nOlyphant slips into Givens' trademark cowboy hat with aplomb, delivering a show-stopping performance that rivals his best work on \"Deadwood.\" Couple that with a delectable cast of memorable side characters, witty dialogue, and some fairly shocking violence, and you have a perfect dish to feast on over a week or two while you wait for Reacher's return.\n\nCount me among those who believe Chris Pratt is a legit superstar. Whether on the big or small screen, the actor has charisma to spare and enough presence to turn even the blandest material into something worth watching. That's essentially the case with \"The Terminal List,\" a dour, bleak, moody affair full of bone-crunching action, sweat-inducing suspense, muscle-bound heroes, and not much else. The plot concerns Pratt's attempts to clear his name for the murder of his wife and daughter, a mission that requires putting together a team consisting of Taylor Kitsch, Constance Wu, and Jai Courtney. Plot twists abound, as are the customary fight sequences, explosions, and do-or-die missions.\n\nWhile the middling material doesn't offer anything new, Pratt's star power shines through. You like the guy and cheer the moment he slowly removes a bad guy's intestines. This ain't your typical action series. \"The Terminal List\" wants you to feel every gunshot and think about the lives lost during this operation. To a certain extent, it works, but mostly, this is just another revenge story touched up with a new coat of paint.\n\nSo why place it on this list? While a far cry from the more laid-back tone of \"Reacher,\" \"The Terminal List\" still hits the same notes, albeit with more dramatic force. If you're looking for a revenge series that takes its storyline a little more seriously — almost to a fault — you might wanna give \"The Terminal List\" a whirl.\n\nWe take Maggie Q for granted. The talented actor from such films as \"Mission: Impossible III\" and \"Live Free or Die Hard\" makes for a credible action star, which is probably why the producers at the CW decided to give her a run with the short-lived but very entertaining \"Nikita.\" Based on the French film \"La Femme Nikita,\" directed by Luc Besson, and the memorable late '90s TV show \"Nikita,\" follows a spy named Nikita Mears (Q) whose objective is to bring down Division, a powerful agency she escaped from that recruits and trains assassins.\n\nLasting only four seasons, \"Nikita\" nonetheless tells a gripping tale that should delight fans of the original material. Maggie Q is cool and sexy as the lead, kicking the snot out of hundreds of faceless baddies without breaking a sweat. Also in tow are Shane West and Lyndsy Fonseca as Nikita's closest acquaintances and Xander Berkeley as the show's token villain.\n\nSleek, stylish, and fun to watch, \"Nikita\" is an entertaining distraction for those needing a little more vengeance-fueled madness.\n\n\"Luther\" takes place on the other side of the pond from \"Reacher\" but carries the same DNA. Admittedly, I found the series only recently, so I had plenty of catching up to do — five seasons and a film! So let me say, whatever you've heard about \"Luther,\" it's even better.\n\nIdris Elba stars as the titular Detective Chief Inspector Luther, who spends his days solving crimes and evading/pursuing the criminal mastermind Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson). Yeah, it's complicated — like, \"Hannibal\" levels of complicated — but that's part and parcel of Luther's fascinating story. Here is a man with an incredible gift for detective work, prone to violence and obsessed with his cases to an unhealthy degree. How ironic that his one chance at happiness lies in the hands of a criminal who is very much his opposite in every way imaginable.\n\nMore psychological than action-packed, \"Luther\" still lets Elba flex his stuff against the scum of society. When tasked with acquiring DNA from a police officer, Luther puts on a hat, sunglasses, and plastic gloves, walks up to the man, and punches him square in the nose. Blood oozes all over Luther's plastic gloves. Unorthodox, sure, but hey, he gets the job done.\n\nOkay, before you judge, let me explain. \"Shooter,\" the 2007 film starring Mark Wahlberg as a former sniper who goes on the run after being framed for murder, sucks. However, the short-lived television series starring Ryan Phillippe is actually pretty great. Both film and series utilize elements of Stephen Hunter's novels, but where the movie seemed more like a dumbed-down remake of \"The Fugitive,\" the small-screen adaptation has plenty to offer those searching for a quick thrill.\n\nDon't misunderstand. This isn't benchmark TV. In fact, its unwillingness to venture into uncharted territory keeps \"Shooter\" from ascending to even greater heights and probably led to its abrupt cancellation after just three seasons. Regardless, the star-studded affair, featuring Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, and Beverly D'Angelo, among others, brings the heat and carries itself well despite fairly rudimentary production standards.\n\nPhillippe's red-blooded assassin matches Reacher in terms of combat skills. He's a man unafraid to get his hands dirty, though he mainly demonstrates his prowess by looking through a scope miles away from harm. Regardless, \"Shooter\" satisfied my action lust for a spell and is a worthy follow-up for those needing more blood-soaked carnage in their lives."
