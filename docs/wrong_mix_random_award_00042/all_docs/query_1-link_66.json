        "text": "Reese Witherspoon's daughter Ava Phillippe is taking a stand against \"toxic\" body-shamers who've commented on her body online.\n\nIn a new TikTok video, Phillippe jams to \"Just A Girl\" from the Clueless soundtrack, as the words, \"NBD but I just achieved a major milestone as a woman online...\" appear on the screen.\n\nShe continues, \"I saw 2 different strangers commenting on my body. The first said I should get on Oz*mpic because I'm too fat... The second accused me of starving myself because I'm too thin...\"\n\nAt this point, Phillippe picks up a red lipstick and begins applying it. Her words read, \"My weight did not change in the time period between their comments (& it wouldn't be any of their business if it did!)\"\n\nShe then dragged the lipstick across her cheek, Joker-style, as the words on screen read, \"It's such bullsh*t.\"\n\nWith the UC Berkeley grad off screen, her words read, \"No one deserves to be picked apart for what they look like. You don't always know what someone's gone through or what they struggle with.\n\n\"But no matter who you are... Your beauty exceeds such superficial measures.\"\n\n@avaephillippe â™¬ Just A Girl (From \"Clueless\") - Soundtrack Wonder Band\n\nPhillippe captioned her video, \"Pretty is as pretty does, babes...& bodyshaming is simply toxic behavior. #loveyouasyouare\n\n\"(P.S. I put 'woman' because I see this type of thing happening disproportionately to young girls & women, but let me be clear; bodyshaming is toxic no matter who the subject is. We all deserve to feel safe & at peace in the vessel we live in.)\"\n\nThe 24-year-old's famous mom commented, \"Yes to all of this\""
