Set amidst the unparalleled wealth and glamor of Palm Beach, Jason Statham and Jennifer Lopez team up to get their cut in the crime thriller PARKER based on the crime novel Flashfire by Richard Stark (Richard Stark was one of the many pseudonyms of Donald E. Westlake, 1933–2008, a prolific author of crime fictio. Watch a clip.\n\nABOUT THE PRODUCTION\n\nNovelist and screenwriter Donald E. Westlake’s iconic anti-hero, Parker, debuted in 1962 in the best-selling crime thriller, The Hunter, the story of a brutal professional thief who operates under his own stringent code. Over the next 46 years, Westlake went on to publish two dozen popular thrillers featuring the character, developing a worldwide following for the hardboiled noir series.\n\nWhen he first conceived the character, Westlake figured Parker was doomed by the literary conventions of the time to become a one-hit wonder—a charismatic bad boy who would get his just desserts in the first novel’s final pages. But after reading the finished manuscript, Westlake’s editor came back to him with an unusual request: Allow Parker, a ruthless criminal with a passion for revenge, to escape justice in the first book, leaving the door open for a sequel or two.\n\n“In those days, a criminal had to die at the end of the book,” recalls Abby Westlake, the writer’s widow. “Donald had followed tradition and killed off the character, but he was convinced to keep him alive for another book.”\n\nLes Alexander, producer of the movie Parker and long-time member of Donald and Abby Westlake’s inner circle, remembers the shock of the first book’s ending. “Back then the bad guy had to die,” he recalls. “But the truth was, readers found themselves rooting for Parker even after he killed people, because he’s smarter than most of the people around him and he has a code of honor that is impeccable.\n\n“Not killing the guy off at the end of the first book was a brilliant stroke,” he adds. “It was pure serendipity, which is often how the best things happen.”\n\nAnd so began an almost five-decade run for the mysterious “heister,” as Parker refers to himself and his colleagues in the books. Westlake, a prolific writer who published more than 100 novels and non-fiction books under his own name and a number of pseudonyms, eventually authored 24 books about the career criminal using the nom de plume Richard Stark. Readers were enthralled by Westlake’s minutely detailed capers involving ultra-high-stakes robberies, as well as by Parker’s personal code: never steal from those in need, kill only if you have to, and always get even with your enemies.\n\n“He wrote about 17 books and then took a break between 1974 and 1997,” says Abby. “He always said the character just went away. He just didn’t have access to that character anymore, so he moved on. But one day, Parker came back. The seven books that followed were very rich, and Donald was proud of all of them.”\n\nThe character had already built a huge international following through the first books, but something essential seemed to have shifted in him that made the new Parker even more intriguing, according to Alexander. “Parker had changed during the hiatus,” he says. “The later books have more richness, warmth and humanity to them, while the early novels are more cold, classic noir.”\n\nParker is adapted from Flashfire, the first book Westlake published after his 23-year break from the character. While several earlier films, including Payback (with Mel Gibson) have borrowed story lines and ideas from the series, Parker marks the first time that the Westlake estate has allowed filmmakers to use the character’s name in a movie.\n\nThe producer says that the Westlake estate selected Flashfire to be the first movie to put the Parker character on screen because it includes all of the most important elements. “We chose to start here because this story has everything,” explains Alexander. “It has Parker’s unrelenting quest for vengeance when he is wronged, as well as his devotion to his girlfriend Claire even when tempted by another woman, which humanizes him. I really think it is the best Parker story.”\n\nThe script, written by John McLaughlin (who also penned the screenplay for Black Swan and Hitchcock), stays true to the essence of Westlake’s honor-bound criminal while updating and expanding the story. “John McLaughlin did a brilliant job on the script,” says Alexander. “There’s a big difference between a translation and an adaptation. A translation means to just copy the book down. John really adapted it. He found the character’s spirit and captured what is magical about him.”\n\nMcLaughlin’s script attracted the attention of one of Hollywood’s top producer-directors: Oscar winner Taylor Hackford, who has helmed such acclaimed films as Ray and An Officer and a Gentleman. “There’s only one thing that attracts me to a project and that’s the script,” he says. “I read this and I was sold. It is an intelligent action picture, full of intrigue, and strong characterizations, which are important to me.”\n\nLike so many readers before him, Hackford found himself unexpectedly charmed by the character’s peculiar psychology. “The wonderful thing about Parker is that he has an unshakable code of ethics,” the director says. “He is completely unapologetic about what he does. He’s a thief, he is capable of extreme violence, but he’s not a psychopath. In fact, he lets people know right off the bat that if they do what he says, they won’t get hurt. He only steals from people who can afford the loss. He is somebody with integrity who has chosen a criminal path. And if he’s going to do something with an accomplice, there is a bond. If he’s crossed, as he is in this movie, he’ll go to the ends of the earth to get even.”\n\nBut Hackford resists the temptation to compare him to other charming rogues made famous by films. “I would never call him a gentleman,” Hackford says. “He’s not debonair like Cary Grant in To Catch a Thief. He is a realistically tough professional who believes in honor among thieves. Without that, there’s only chaos. And as he says very clearly in the script, no one likes chaos.”\n\nHackford added his own personal touches to McLaughlin’s screenplay, finding dialogue that helped further define the players. “He gave each character some gems that condensed their essence,” says Alexander. “It’s a much richer script for having him involved with it. You need characters with clear motivations to allow the audience to see the spider weave the web.”\n\nFilm noir is one of the few genres Hackford has never tackled in his decades-long career. “Taylor embraces challenges with great enthusiasm,” says Alexander. “He said he was going to make the best genre film he could. Taylor knows his film history better than anybody and he knows what the rules are. He made an even better film than we had hoped.”\n\nWith scores of Parker fans around the world awaiting the character’s big-screen debut, the filmmakers took their responsibility to stay true to Westlake’s creation very seriously. “We are basically following in Donald Westlake’s footsteps,” says Hackford. “He created the characters and we have to deliver based on that. All we could do, because Donald’s no longer with us, was read the material, try to stay true to it and, and pay it respect. I wish he were here to see it. It will be up to all those millions of fans out there to tell us if we have or we haven’t done him justice.\n\n“There is a good reason that this is the first adaptation that’s ever received permission from the estate to use that character’s name,” he adds. “Donald Westlake received the ultimate compliment when he was called the modern inheritor of Raymond Chandler, and John McLaughlin fit right into Westlake’s style. He utilized the most important elements and then built on others in a wonderful way that maintains the integrity of Donald Westlake and, at the same time, made it more of a film project. He has wit and added a little piquancy of his own. It was sanctioned by Abby, so you know it’s true to the original author.”\n\nTHE PERFECT PARKER\n\nWith Taylor Hackford at the helm, the filmmakers began casting and found themselves with a wealth of talent that was ready and willing to join the production. “Obviously, Taylor made huge contributions to this movie,” says Alexander. “One of the most significant was his ability to attract a world-class cast. He then got performances out of them that are nothing short of amazing. Jason Statham, who plays Parker, shows a completely new side of himself that will shock and please his fans.”\n\nStatham’s impressive combination of physical prowess and fierce intelligence fitted the character to a T, according to Hackford. “I first saw Jason in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,” the director says. “The surprising thing about him is that he’s got so much humor. When he became a real action star, it would have been easy for him to fall into the stereotype of the strong silent man. He is perfect as Parker because he combines the qualities of an Everyman with authentic physicality. Jason doesn’t have 14 stuntmen jumping in for him. He was an Olympic-level diver and he knows how use his body in the most artful way.”\n\nStatham was drawn to Parker’s unusual, black-and-white moral code. “Westlake gives this thief an unusual sense of sanity and thoughtfulness,” says the actor. “It’s a great character with a lot of layers and he’s got a sense of humor that appeals to me. He’s a man who does anything to put things right. Sometimes he steps over the law, but I think he sees all business as corrupt, so what he’s doing is just taking his piece of the pie. While he could bulldoze his way through most situations, he prefers to do things in a mild-mannered way. But if you cross the line, he’s capable of doing something quite horrific.”\n\nThe actor and the director found working together a satisfying experience. “Jason approached the role quite seriously,” says Hackford. “He collaborated every step of the way and never said no to anything, because he saw the potential in this role. With Parker, he’s taken a real step up as an actor. Of course, he’s already a star, but here he is pushing himself to grow, which is deserving of enormous respect. People who love Jason Statham movies are going to see just how much more this guy is capable of.”\n\n“Taylor is a true filmmaker,” says Statham. “We had hours and hours of conversations about Parker. He was brimming with details and left no stone unturned. He had backstories for all the relationships. I think because of that it has a bit more heart than a typical film noir. And it’s quite funny at times.\n\n“It was a big privilege to work with someone who is so detail oriented and cares so much about what he’s putting on screen,” he adds. “The pressure was on Taylor to get this right for Westlake. He was a real talented chap with a following and his own Academy Award for the screenplay of The Grifters. We had to respect that pedigree.”\n\nThe movie’s story hopscotches through Memphis, Houston and New Orleans, before settling in for a huge caper in Palm Beach, Florida. “Parker butts up against another fantastic character when he gets to Palm Beach, a woman named Leslie,” says Hackford. “She’s not a professional like he is. She’s a real-estate agent, but her life is in ruins, she’s reached the end of her line, and suddenly she finds that a little larceny may be the solution to her problems.”\n\nPlayed by Jennifer Lopez, the Leslie character is divorced, pushing 40 and trapped in a no-win situation. She has had to move back to West Palm Beach with her mother, a retired Cuban hairdresser played by legendary Broadway diva Patti LuPone, and the two are at odds as Leslie tries to rebuild her life.\n\n“She’s selling real estate in Palm Beach, one of the wealthiest enclaves in the United States,” says Hackford. “So every day she drives across the bridge from West Palm, which is a nice, normal kind of town, to sell real estate that she will never be able to live in. She’s not a glamour queen or a diva. Leslie’s real and Jennifer is real in the role. She’s a fantastic actress, and not since Out of Sight has she played a character this down to earth.”\n\nLeslie meets Parker when he comes to town posing as wealthy Texas oilman looking for a house on the island. She pins her hopes on him, first as a client who can help her make a big score, and then as a possible white knight who can save her from the life she’s living.\n\n“I thought the relationship between Leslie and Parker was complicated and quite realistic, which made this more interesting than just another action movie,” says Lopez. “In our first meeting, I asked Taylor why he wanted me to play this character. She’s not exactly like people think of me. And he told me that was exactly why he wanted me. The image that people have of me from my music or ‘American Idol’ or the romantic comedies I’ve done is very different.”\n\nHackford wanted to tap into Lopez’s considerable determination and spunk. “Leslie is a person who seems like she has reached the end of the road but she still refuses to give up,” he says. “I think that is very definitely Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer comes from the Bronx, she has had highs and lows, but she has moxie. She will survive. That’s why I chose her for the role.”\n\nWhen Parker’s secretive demeanor raises Leslie’s suspicions, she senses an opportunity and wants in on whatever he has going. But she quickly realizes she’s out of her depth. “Leslie is not a criminal,” says Hackford. “She’s just desperate. She’s looking for a way out, but she’s not aware of how serious this is. This isn’t a love story—they become partners. A hardened professional and a novice, both with strong personalities, come together and it’s a fascinating character study. Jennifer and Jason create true interest and electricity together.”\n\nStatham gives his co-star high marks for her work. “Jennifer is so normal and accessible, but she is also stunning,” says Statham. “People across the board can relate to her and she can stop traffic. It’s rare find those things together. Taylor was looking for someone that had all that and is a great actress to boot.”\n\nWorking with Statham was equally satisfying for Lopez. “It was a lot of fun,” she says. “He’s both a super-badass, action guy and a really good actor. We had a great time pushing each other acting-wise. I don’t think even he and I realized how much of a journey these two characters were going to go on together until we went through it. They learn to really trust each other and to care about each other.”\n\nHackford sought out legendary actor Nick Nolte for the role of Hurley, Parker’s best friend and mentor. “I’ve always liked Nick,” he says. “I had wanted to work with him for years. His presence now is very different than when he was a young hunk. He’s become an old bear. His voice is amazing; it’s a distinctive kind of croak. You feel the experience when you hear him speak. You can feel the miles on him.\n\n“He’s a wonderful actor,” the director adds. “When he came on the set, there was a feeling of ‘what is this guy going to be like?’ And everybody loved him, the crew and the cast. He added immeasurably to this.”\n\nHurley understands Parker in ways that no one else in the world can. “He humanizes Parker,” says the director. “He’s the only person Parker completely lets his guard down with. And Hurley embraces Parker like a son.”\n\nThe two share an ex-military background and discipline that they have adapted perfectly for a life of crime. “Hurley is pretty much retired, but he helps guide Parker to jobs,” explains Nolte. “They have specialized knowledge and experience that they use in their work. Hurley sets Parker up for the State Fair job, and when it goes wrong, he feels like he has to straighten things out.”\n\nThe actor found that he and Hackford were very much on the same page about the character and the story. “Taylor guided me right down the same track I was heading,” he says. “I have been involved in pieces like this in the past and I thought this was done really well. And I like what Jason has done with Parker. It reminds me of some of Steve McQueen’s best work in the way it combines action, comedy and character.”\n\nThe Melander gang, the crew that Hurley sets Parker up with for the daring Ohio State Fair heist in the film’s opening sequence, is a crew of career criminals with ties to the Chicago Mob. Each member of this quartet of miscreants has specific and well-defined place in the job. “It’s a caper movie, an action movie and a film noir,” says Hackford. “You have to have some bad guys. To me, those characters are always some of the most interesting. They don’t have to be nice, but I like them to be intelligent. Parker cannot live up to his potential unless he comes up against someone forceful and strong, so it was my job to make sure that the four characters in the Melander gang were worthy opponents. I was lucky enough to have some terrific actors to work with.”\n\nMelander, the team’s leader, is played by Michael Chiklis, an actor who won critical acclaim for his work as the pragmatic Detective Vic McKay in the television series, “The Shield.” “I have great respect for Michael Chiklis,” says the director. “He is an extremely intelligent and dynamic actor. You know you’re up against somebody substantial and dangerous and smart when you see Michael.”\n\nWendell Pierce, who has worked with Hackford on three previous films, including Ray, plays Carlson, the group’s most vigilant and forward-thinking member. “Wendell is a fabulous actor who also appeared in ‘The Wire’ and ‘Treme’ on HBO,” says the director. “He carries a certain presence, so you know he is not just an everyday criminal. He’s somebody who has thought everything out in detail.”\n\nAs Ross, Clifton Collins, Jr. gives the team’s muscle quiet intensity and a hair trigger. “I love Clifton’s work,” Hackford says. “He blew me away as Perry Smith in Capote. Without saying a word, he brings danger into the room with him. He has a way of carrying himself, he’s an expert with weapons and woe be to the person that tries to stand up against him.”\n\nThe fourth member of the gang is Hardwicke, played by Micah Hauptman. “He’s not really part of this gang,” according to Hackford. “He’s the guy who is going to make the deal happen. He is the nephew of a big mafia don and can use his family connections to fence the loot, but he’s not a made man. Even though he’s very intelligent and very ambitious, he’s a bit of a screw up. From the get-go you know that he is the weak link in the chain. Parker recognizes that immediately.”\n\nFor the crucial role of Claire, Parker’s live-in love, the filmmakers launched an extensive search. “She is vital to the story,” says Hackford. “She’s the person that Parker has chosen to be with, although he does not share much of his past or professional life with her. He knows that if she knows too much, it will hurt her. They had to be able to communicate a lot in very few words.”\n\nActress Emma Booth, an Australian native, plays Claire. “She has a perfect American accent and fantastic talent. She doesn’t gush or need to go for glamor,” says Hackford. “She just has something real. And all of us, including Jason, immediately knew she was the one.”\n\nParker is Booth’s first foray into the action-film world. “I was really excited by that prospect, especially with Taylor directing,” she says. “Then, of course, Jason was starring in it, so the combination of cast, director and the script itself was great.”\n\nStatham says that having someone like Hackford in the lead was crucial to putting together a cast capable of working at this level. “Taylor has an ability as a filmmaker to put great people in movies and everyone wants to work with someone like that. People are interested in working with talented filmmakers and they just turn up when Taylor picks up the phone.”\n\nIN THE REAL WORLD\n\nParker follows its protagonist’s quest for revenge from the sunny optimism of the Ohio State Fair to the honky-tonk bars of Bourbon Street to the opulent allure of Palm Beach, with stops in between in the violent neighborhoods and industrial wastelands where the character learned his trade. “In this film, the locations are also characters,” says Hackford. “It’s mostly exterior shooting and we have some sensational settings that aren’t often seen in movies.”\n\nMuch of the action was shot in and around New Orleans, even the scenes set elsewhere. “We used it as Kentucky, as Tennessee, as Texas,” Hackford says. “There’s one Bourbon Street location, but aside from that, Louisiana and especially New Orleans stand in for all these other places. The city has fantastic locations besides the ones we are used to seeing in films. It is an amazing backdrop for the movie and you’re not going to believe how much of it was shot in New Orleans.”\n\nThe action starts at the Ohio State Fair, which is the largest state fair in the United States with close to a million attendees during its 12-day run in 2012. “It’s where the common man goes to have a good time,” says Hackford. “The fact that we were able to shoot there was incredible. The people were so gracious. We have 40,000 or 50,000 extras in the scene. We couldn’t stop the fair, so it continued on around us. We could never have paid for that kind of production value. It’s fantastic.”\n\nFor the actors, the real-life action of the fair made shooting those scenes especially intense, according to Micah Hauptman. “Everything was on the fly,” he says. “When you’re shooting in the midst of all these real people, you never know what’s going to happen, which was a lot of fun.”\n\nBut the bulk of the film’s action takes place in what may be the richest place in the United States. “The Melander gang’s big caper is planned for Palm Beach,” says Hackford. “It’s a community that has been legendary since its first days. The richest of the rich in the East went down early in the last century and built a Xanadu for themselves on what is essentially a tropical island. It reeks of wealth. There are more mansions and clipped ficus in Palm Beach then you have ever seen in your life and it gives the film incredible style.”\n\nGetting the permits and permissions they needed to shoot in Palm Beach was not easy, however. The city put a moratorium on filming there in the 1990s in order to preserve the privacy of its elite residents. But Hackford was determined to shoot the film in the location intended by the Parker author. “Donald Westlake set his story in Palm Beach for a reason. It was essential to the movie. Where else would you have an auction of $50-$75 million of jewelry? There, it happens all the time.”\n\nThe production eventually got unprecedented cooperation from both West Palm and Palm Beach. “The Palm Beach County Film Commission was fantastic, as was the Town Council,” says Hackford. “Did they give me permission to do everything I wanted? No. But I did get what I needed of Palm Beach in this film. You see the main roads, the neighborhoods, the famous bridges, which are integral to the story.”\n\nThe climactic robbery takes place in a magnificent mansion overlooking the water. “Many people are going to think we shot at Mar-A-Lago, which is the most famous estate in Palm Beach,” says Hackford. “In fact, the big mansion where the culmination of this heist takes place is clear across Florida in Sarasota.”\n\nThat scene takes place at the John Ringling Museum of Art. “At the turn of the century, the Ringling Brothers were gigantic,” Hackford explains. “Forget all the Broadway impresarios and the Hollywood moguls—they were real entertainment. John Ringling was one of the richest men in America and he built this incredible terracotta mansion on the water in Sarasota and we used that as the site of this auction.”\n\nHackford replicates the gritty realism of Westlake’s novel with the film’s utterly believable action, stunts and fights. “I wanted the action and the violence to be very real,” Hackford says. “I did not want a kind of fantasy element to that part of the film. I appreciate that kind of movie, but that’s not what we went after in Parker. I want audiences to look at him and say, this guy is the real thing. When he gets hit, he feels it. When he’s put in grave danger, we know it. At the end of the film, he’s debilitated. He’s hurt. At the same time, that refusal to give up comes through. I wanted to deliver a film so real that it’s on the knife’s edge.”\n\nIn Statham, Hackford had a consummate, physical actor, with extensive experience in creating the kind of explosive action he was looking for. “He wants to do all his own stunt work, which was a gift to me as a director. He’s very smart, so he doesn’t risk things unnecessarily, but when he knows things are right, he does them. There’s a sequence early in this film where there’s a shootout in a car. When Parker jumps out of that car, Jason is doing it. He jumps out at full speed. It was a very tough stunt.”\n\nStatham says it may not have been the most dangerous stunt he ever did, but it was up there. “Parker was in the back of an SUV with the motley crew of robbers and they’re all armed to the teeth,” he explains. “He has to get out of the car and stay alive. It was very tricky. I had to get out of a moving vehicle through the window. The many years I spent as a diver came in handy. I was able to slot myself right out of the window hole.”\n\nThe actor says he finds a great deal of fulfillment in doing his own stunts. “I don’t think that will ever leave me. I always want to do what I think I’m capable of doing. But it’s difficult to create sequences we haven’t seen before and keep the action centered on the character, so it doesn’t become like a video game. It takes a great deal of preparation and a good team of people to keep it safe. I have an outstanding stunt team that I like to work with. We’ve had some good results and developed a shorthand.”\n\nThat team includes stunt coordinator Mike Massa, who worked with Statham on The Expendables and second-unit director David Leitch from The Mechanic. “It was my first time working with Mike and Dave and they were absolutely terrific,” says Hackford. “They are both incredibly accomplished people in their field and great collaborators. We took every precaution and then we went for it.”\n\nIn a stunning scene set on the 26th floor of a high-rise hotel, Parker has to fend off a vicious assassin sent by the Melander gang’s Chicago connections. “The actor had to be somebody of substance to keep it real,” Hackford says. “Daniel Bernhardt is a terrific actor who has headlined some pretty terrific action films himself. He’s very serious about his work. Both he and Jason are doing their own stunts in this scene and let me tell you, that fight is brutal. They take the blows. By the end of the fight, it is clear that Parker is truly hurt. He’s like a wounded lion as he heads off for the final confrontation. Having collaborators like Mike and Dave was vital because it gave the actors the confidence to go all the way.”\n\nAdds Statham: “Taylor was fixated on not doing anything that wasn’t driven by the character. That made for a great fight. The heroic characters I have played in the past have been super efficient in hand-to-hand fights and you never see them really get hurt. Taylor insisted on having us take a realistic beating. He wanted Parker to barely survive to add to the tension and the drama. Will he make it to the end? Can he really succeed in what he wants to do? The stakes are that much higher because of that.”\n\nABOUT THE CAST\n\nJASON STATHAM (Parker) is an international film star best known for a string of successful, hard-hitting action thrillers. Most recently he was seen in The Expendables 2 alongside Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In 1993 the Mystery Writers of America named Westlake a Grand Master, the highest honor bestowed by the society. Under the pseudonym Richard Stark, Westlake wrote 16 novels about the relentless and remorseless professional thief Parker. Published between 1962 and 1974, the novels depicted Parker as a ruthless career criminal with almost no traditional redeeming qualities aside from efficiency and professionalism. His first name is never mentioned in the novels, and there are many details about the character that remain unknown. Several Parker novels have been adapted for the screen, though each of them changed the protagonist’s name: 1967’s Point Blank (based on The Hunter), starring Lee Marvin as Parker (character name changed to Walker); 1968’s The Split (from The Seventh), with Jim Brown as Parker (changed to McClain); 1973’s The Outfit, with Robert Duvall as Parker (changed to Macklin); and 1999’s Payback, a second film adaptation of The Hunter, with Mel Gibson as Parker (changed to Porter). The author was born Donald Edwin Westlake on July 12, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York. He attended three colleges, all in the state of New York, while serving two and a half years in the United States Air Force. He once said that he knew he was a writer when he was 11 but that it took the rest of the world about 10 years to begin to agree. Until then his audience was mainly limited to his father, who was encouraging and influential. LES ALEXANDER (Producer) has served as executive producer on more than 50 television movies, miniseries, pilots and series.
