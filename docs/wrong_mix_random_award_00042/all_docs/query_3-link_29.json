        "text": "&#151; -- It's been nearly a decade since Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe's split, but the former couple have learned how to co-parent during the holidays peacefully.\n\nPhillippe opened up to \"Entertainment Tonight\" about taking turns with his ex-wife to spend Thanksgiving with their kids.\n\n\"As a divorced dad, we trade off so last year, my kids and I went to my parents' in Delaware,\" he said. \"This year, they will be with their mom and I am shooting a movie up in Toronto. I'm going to fly down to Philly and just have a Thanksgiving with my parents and the kids get to be with Reese.\"\n\nWitherspoon and Phillippe are parents to 17-year-old Ava and 12-year-old Deacon.\n\nThey fell in love on the set of the movie, \"Cruel Intentions\" and wed in 1999.\n\nWitherspoon and Phillippe were married for eight years before calling it quits in 2007.\n\nIn 2011, Witherspoon told ABC News that the kids are surrounded by love.\n\n\"I always tell my kids, 'You're so lucky cause it's not just your mom and dad who love you. You have grandparents that love you, a stepdad that loves you and it's always such a great opportunity to have as many people in your life nurturing you and carrying you and guiding you in this life.\"\n\nDespite their divorce, Witherspoon and Phillippe have been able to successfully co-parent.\n\n\"You have to get to that point as a divorced parent, as any parent, where youâ€™re not putting yourself first,\" Phillippe told \"Entertainment Tonight.\""
