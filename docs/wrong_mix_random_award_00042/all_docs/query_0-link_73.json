        "text": "Publish date: 2024-05-17\n\nQuick Links\n\n10. Pee Wee Herman\n\n9. Jon Stewart\n\n8. Betty White\n\n7. The Three Stooges\n\n6. Snooki\n\n5. The Muppets\n\n4. Jon Lovitz\n\n3. The cast of MacGruber\n\n2. Buzz Aldrin\n\n1. Grumpy Cat\n\nThe goal of the WWE is to entertain its millions of fans, so naturally the best way to do that is to put on an exciting show with the most successful and popular wrestlers. However, itâs not just wrestlers that draw in the crowds.\n\nThe WWE is famous for being an advertising and marketing juggernaut, so of course there have been many Hollywood celebrities woven into storylines. These guest stars have shown up to taunt wrestlers in the ring and even acted as referees on occasion. Some of these famous guest stars would seem quite at home as wrestlers themselves thanks to their muscular appearance, but others wouldn't be able to cut it if they actually had to fight.\n\nSome guest stars seem like natural choices to have walk-on appearances during a wrestling event. Jerry Springer was known for trying to bring the peace on his own talk show when fights broke out, so he was a natural fit to moderate WWE Divas during RAW. He fit in so well that he is soon going to have his own show on the WWE network. The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger himself, has made many appearances on WWE. Just last year he joined fellow buff actor and his Sabotage costar Joe Manganiello in the ring along with Hulk Hogan to host Monday Night Raw.\n\nBut hereâs a look at ten of the strangest WWE guest stars of all time. Which one is your favorite?\n\n10. Pee Wee Herman\n\nvia eonline.com\n\nPaul Reubens, in character as Pee Wee Herman, made his first WWE guest appearance in 2010 during an episode of WWE Raw. The guest spot was to promote his then upcoming Broadway show. Pee Wee entered the arena and taunted Alex Riley and the Miz.\n\nThe bizarre showdown included Pee Weeâs classic secret word bit. Whenever the Miz uttered the word âringâ the crowd erupted, as it was the 'secret word'. At first Pee Wee seemed physically outmatched, but then he called out his cousin and wrestling partner the Big Show.\n\nPee Wee Hermanâs guest appearance was so successful that he won a Slammy Award later in the year for Guest Star Shining Moment of the Year. Pee Wee made another WWE appearance the following year during WrestleMania XXVII where he got some pointers from the Rock himself, who taught Pee Wee how to properly utter his catch phrase. Of course, Pee Wee gave it a twist of his own.\n\n9. Jon Stewart\n\nwwe.com\n\nThe crossover between the Daily Show and WWE Raw earlier this year was one for the record books. First Seth Rollins hijacked Stewartâs moment of zen at the end of the Daily Show. Seth Rollins then sneaked up behind Stewart and called him out right in front of Stewartâs audience.\n\nThe Daily Show host was surprised that Rollins was right behind him, but Stewart accepted the challenged and later showed up on WWE Raw. Rollins set up his own Daily Show desk in the middle of the ring, and Stewart hurled tons of insults Rollinsâ way. Stewart even said that Rollins looked like a SWAT team stripper with Lady Gagaâs hair! Seth Rollins was angered beyond belief.\n\nIt really looked like Stewart was done for. Randy Orton entered the arena just when it looked like Rollins was going to lay a whooping on Stewart. Ortonâs entrance distracted Rollins just long enough for Stewart to kick Rollins right in the groin. Then Stewart made his escape while Rollins was hunched over in pain.\n\n8. Betty White\n\nvia youtube\n\nBetty Whiteâs return to the spotlight in the last five years has been so impressive and monumental that she has even guest starred on WWE Raw. In fact, she hosted an episode of Raw last year to promote the third season of her prank show Betty Whiteâs Off Their Rockers and the fifth season of her sitcom Hot In Cleveland.\n\nShe entered the Staples Center in Los Angeles escorted by the Big Show and received a very warm welcome from the crowd. When the Big Show asked her what she was going to do tonight. She said she was going to kick some ass! Later in the show she joined some WWE Divas to introduce some clips from her show, and then she joined the New Age Outlaws for a nice cup of tea. She was quite taken by the New Age Outlaws but was impressed by their title belt.\n\n7. The Three Stooges\n\nvia reelz.com\n\nWith their wild antics and slapstick gags the Three Stooges are a welcome addition to any WWE ring. After all, who better to teach the Three Stooges a thing or two about inflicting pain to each other than some of the best WWE superstars? To promote the Farrelly brothersâ Three Stooges movie, Will Sasso, Chris Diamantopoulos and Sean Hayes guest starred on Raw as Curly, Moe and Larry, respectively.\n\nLarry and Moe entered the ring, but at first Curly was nowhere to be found. Curly ended up making his entrance dressed as none other than WWE superstar Hulk Hogan. Moe said Curly looked the part, but sounded nothing like the Hulkster. When Moe yanked on Curlyâs tongue his voiced suddenly dropped multiple octaves. This was not good news for Curly as Kane mistook him for the real Hulk Hogan and choke slammed curly to the mat.\n\n6. Snooki\n\nvia sportskeeda.com\n\nUnfortunately, at the height of the popularity of the Jersey Shore phenomenon, you simply couldn't escape Snooki as part of the pop culture zeitgeist no matter how hard you tried. Even if you wanted to sit back, relax and watch an entertaining episode of WWE Raw.\n\nSnookiâs appearance on Raw proved to be shocking and hilarious. She might have even made a fine WWE Diva herself. When Snooki guest starred on Raw in March of 2011 she was looking to start a catfight. First she slapped Vickie Guerrero backstage, and when Guerrero got in the ring with Diva tag team duo LayCool things got even more heated.\n\nSnooki took on both Michelle McCool and Layla El of LayCool. Then Trish Stratus rushed into the ring to lend a hand to Snooki. Snookiâs guest spot on Raw proved she is not to be messed with. Snooki showed the crowed just how ferocious she could be. She then teamed up with Trish Stratus once more to take on LayCool at WrestleMania later that year, and she won again.\n\n5. The Muppets\n\nvia muppet.wikia.com\n\nWhen the Muppets showed up on WWE Raw it was an overload of nostalgia for many fans. Kermit and Miss Piggy began the show as hosts, but Vickie Guerrero and Jack Swagger soon interrupted them. Guerrero said that the Muppets were just livestock, and Swagger threatened to turn Kermit into a plate of frog legs.\n\nLuckily, Santino came in to break up the ruckus and challenge Swagger to a match. Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog werenât the only Muppets to guest star on Raw. Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his partner Beaker also made an appearance.\n\nThe pair had concocted a special drink that would allow Santino to win his match, but Beaker was interrupted by Christian, who poured out the concoction. Luckily, Sheamus came to Beakerâs rescue, and it turns out that Sheamus and Beaker are actually cousins. They certainly look alike. Gonzo, Fozzie Bear, Animal, and Statler and Waldorf also showed up on Raw to help promote the Muppet Movie.\n\n4. Jon Lovitz\n\nvia wwe.com\n\nJon Lovitz on Raw definitely does not stink. Lovitz was on Raw to promote his Comedy Club at Universal Studios, and at the beginning of the show he was enamored by WWE Diva Maryse.\n\nLovitz mentioned that he was working on a wrestling move of his own which he called the fast freak fiber twitch jugular pinch. He said he was teaching it to Santino and that the move was so powerful that it would allow any wrestler to win any match.\n\nIt seemed like Lovitz would be able to seduce Maryse after he whispered sweet nothings into her ear in French and casually mentioned he was super rich, but when she finally fell for him he pulled the old switcheroo and told her he wasn't interested after all.\n\nâThereâs nothing more exciting than live television,â said Lovitz of his appearance on Raw. âI absolutely think the WWE is a unique form of entertainment.â\n\n3. The cast of MacGruber\n\nvia pl.wwe.com\n\nMacGruber is comedy movie that quickly became a cult classic but before the movie opened in theatres, the stars of the SNL-based comedy appeared on WWE as guest celebrities. It was quite fitting considering how many WWE superstars cameoed in the film.\n\nThe actors including Will Forte, Kristen Wiig and Ryan Phillippe guest starred on WWE Raw in 2010. Will Forte, as MacGruber, got some wrestling tips from his MacGruber co star Chris Jericho before his match with Vladimir Kozlov. It didn't go well as MacGruber was getting badly beaten, but then Ryan Phillippe came to the rescue with Khaluber â a.k.a the Great Khali disguised as MacGruberâs half brother. Will Forte compared his guest spot on WWE to his days on Saturday Night Live, observing that there were a lot of parallels.\n\n2. Buzz Aldrin\n\nvia wwe.com\n\nEven the second man on the moon made an appearance on WWE. The legendary Apollo 11 astronaut hosted WWE Raw in 2010 in Toronto. Aldrinâs guest hosting duty on Raw was just one of many strange endeavors the American hero has undertaken in the last few years.\n\nHe recorded a rap single with Snoop Dogg and even starred on Dancing with the Stars. Aldrin entered the ring and got the crowd revved up by touting NASA and its achievements. However, he was soon rudely interrupted by Zack Ryder who implied that the moon landing was fake!\n\nAldrin didnât take too kindly to that and threatened to beat Ryder up. In fact, Aldrin did actually punch someone who said the moon landing was fake â it happened in real life and it wasnât a WWE act.\n\n1. Grumpy Cat\n\nvia ooyala.com\n\nYou donât even have to be a human celebrity to get a guest spot on WWE Raw. It seems that if you're an extremely popular Internet meme that'll suffice. Late last year the frowning feline known as Grumpy Cat guest starred on Raw, and the Miz attempted to recruit Grumpy Cat to be part of his nefarious plans.\n\nOf course, Grumpy Cat was not impressed or even amused by this plot. Then the Miz suggested the pair team up for a buddy cop movie instead. There was absolutely no way Grumpy Cat was going to have any part of that either.\n\nSources: wwe, wikia, hollywoodreporter, ew\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e9OhnGZpYGK6sL%2FTZpmispGnv6Z5xq6crKxdqMGivtJmoKdlp6yybrTIrKuoqqlk"
