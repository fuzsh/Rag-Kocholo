        "text": "She’s calling out their cruel intentions.\n\nReese Witherspoon’s daughter, Ava Phillippe, 24, is slamming keyboard warriors who have made comments about her looks.\n\nAva — who is one of two children that Witherspoon, 48, had with her ex-husband and “Cruel Intentions” co-star Ryan Phillippe, 49 — posted a viral TikTok on May 4.\n\nIn the video, Witherspoon’s look-alike daughter said, “NBD but I just achieved a major milestone as a woman online.”\n\nWhile putting on red lipstick and blasting Wonder Band’s cover of No Doubt’s “Just a Girl,” Ava continued, “I saw 2 different strangers commenting on my body.\n\n“The first said I should get on Oz*mpic because I’m too fat,” she said, referencing the diabetes drug that has become a weight loss trend.\n\nBarbra Streisand recently came under fire for asking Melissa McCarthy if she used it.\n\nAva added, “The second [person] accused me of starving myself because I’m too thin.”\n\nShe explained that her weight “did not change” during the time period between the different comments and that it “wouldn’t be any of their business” if she had gained or lost weight.\n\nThe “Legally Blonde” star’s daughter wrote, “It’s such bulls–t. No one deserves to be picked apart for what they look like.”\n\nWitherspoon had Ava and son Deacon, 20, with Phillippe. The ex couple was married from 1999 to 2007.\n\nIn addition to Deacon, Ava also has half-brother Tennessee, 11, who Witherspoon had with her second husband, Jim Toth, whom she divorced last summer after 12 years of marriage.\n\nIn her post, Ava added that the public has no idea what a person is going through or “what they struggle with.”\n\n“But no matter who you are … Your beauty exceeds superficial measures,” she wrote.\n\nAva captioned her video by referring to body shaming comments as “simply toxic behavior.”\n\n“Pretty is as pretty does, babes,” she wrote, referring to a quote.\n\nIn an April interview with People magazine, she said, “A big saying in the South, especially amongst women is ‘Pretty is as pretty does.’”\n\nShe added: “Every time that comes up in my brain or I see people being critical of others online for their appearance, I just always think, you’re only as beautiful as you treat other people.”\n\nAva said that her post was directed toward women because she sees body shaming happening “disproportionately to young girls & women.”\n\n“But let me be clear; bodyshaming is toxic no matter who the subject is. We all deserve to feel safe & at peace in the vessel we live in.”\n\nThe Oscar winner cheered on her daughter in the comments.\n\n“Yes to all of this,” she wrote, with a kiss emoji."
