        "text": "From Black Narcissus to His Dark Materials and the return of The Crown, Eddie Mullan picks the programmes worth seeing this month.\n\nBlack Narcissus\n\nIn 1934, young nun Sister Clodagh (Gemma Arterton) travels to Nepal to establish a branch of her order in the remote Himalayas. Loosely based on Rumer Godden’s 1939 novel of the same name, the series is set in the clifftop palace of Mopu, once known as the ‘House of Women’. General Toda Rai (Kulvinder Ghir) donates the palace to the nuns of St Faiths in the hope they can rid the place of unhappy memories connected to his late sister, Srimati.\n\nAlthough Clodagh ignores the warnings of the General’s arrogant land agent Mr Dean (Alessandro Nivola), isolation and illness soon take their toll, with the haunting atmosphere of the palace particularly affecting Sister Ruth (Aisling Franciosi). This BBC and FX co-production also stars Jim Broadbent, and marks one of the final performances by Dame Diana Rigg, who became a Game of Thrones fan favourite for her role as matriarch Olenna Tyrell. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 23 November on FX.\n\nThe Crown\n\nSeason four of the royal drama starts in the late 1970s and runs right through the 1980s, as Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) clashes with Britain’s first female Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson), and Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor) embarks on a tumultuous marriage with Lady Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin).\n\nAs the nation begins to feel the impact of divisive policies introduced by Thatcher, tensions arise between the prime minister and the Queen, which only worsens as the country is led into a war in the Falklands, generating conflict within the Commonwealth. While Charles’s romance with a young Diana provides a much-needed fairy tale to unite the British people, behind closed doors the Royal Family is becoming increasingly divided. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 15 November on Netflix.\n\nIndustry\n\n“Wolf of Wall Street meets Melrose Place” is how Girls creator Lena Dunham describes her latest project, an eight-part BBC and HBO series set in London, which explores the cut-throat world of international finance. We get an insight into this high-pressure environment through the eyes of Harper Stern (Myha’la Herrold), a talented young woman from upstate New York, competing with a group of twenty-something graduates to secure a permanent position in a top investment bank.\n\nAs members of the group rise and fall under the intimidating conditions, personal and work lives begin to blur, and they must decide whether life is about more than the bottom line. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 9 November on HBO in the US and 10 November on BBC Two in the UK.\n\nHis Dark Materials\n\nThe first series of this Philip Pullman adaptation saw Lyra (Dafne Keen) – a brave young woman from another world – embark on a search for a kidnapped friend, uncover a sinister plot involving stolen children, and explore a strange phenomenon called Dust. Although a planned standalone episode could not be filmed due to Covid-19, the star-studded second series will see Fleabag stars Andrew Scott and Phoebe Waller-Bridge reunited.\n\nThis series, which adapts the novel The Subtle Knife, sees Lord Asriel (James McAvoy) open a bridge to a new world, and Lyra follows him into the unknown. In the mysterious city of Cittàgazze, Lyra meets Will (Amir Wilson), a boy who is also running from a troubled past. Meanwhile, Mrs Coulter (Ruth Wilson) searches for Lyra, determined to bring her home. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 8 November on BBC One and 16 November on HBO.\n\nThe Minions of Midas\n\nThis Spanish-language Netflix series about a life-or-death blackmail situation was inspired by a Jack London short story and transported to modern-day Madrid. If influential publisher Victor Genovés (Luis Tosar) doesn't agree to pay a large sum of money, the self-styled Midas favourites will kill a person at random.\n\nNot only that, but the killing will be at a designated place and time, and a new victim will be added periodically until the mysterious organisation achieves their goal. How many deaths will Victor be able to carry on his shoulders? Watch the trailer here. Premieres 13 November on Netflix.\n\nFear by the Lake\n\nFilmed in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic struck, the final instalment in the By the Lake trilogy after Vanished by the Lake and Killer by the Lake takes on a new resonance in 2020, as detectives Lise (Julie De Bona) and Clovis (Lannick Gautry) return to face the threat of a deadly virus.\n\nAn out-of-control boat comes to dock at Annecy in France, and a man covered in blood and black blisters stumbles onto the platform. According to the initial report, the man died from a rare internal haemorrhage, but when another body turns up having suffered the same fate, it’s clear that a virus is spreading. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 6 November on Walter Presents/All4 and 8 November on Channel 4.\n\nLove & Anarchy\n\nFollowing crime drama Quicksand, Netflix’s second Swedish-language TV series tells the story of Sofie (Ida Engvoll), an ambitious consultant and married mother with two kids. Sofie takes on the modernisation of an old publishing house, where she meets young computer technician Max (Björn Mosten), and the two form an unlikely bond.\n\nSofie and Max become involved in a flirtatious game of secret challenges that start innocently enough – but as the stakes get higher, the consequences grow out of proportion, leading them to re-evaluate their entire lives. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 4 November on Netflix.\n\nBig Sky\n\nBased on the series of books by CJ Box, screenwriter David E Kelley’s new project sees private detectives Cassie Dewell (Kylie Bunbury) and Cody Hoyt (Ryan Phillippe) join forces with Cody’s estranged wife and ex-cop, Jenny Hoyt (Katheryn Winnick), to search for two sisters who have been kidnapped by a truck driver on a remote highway in Montana.\n\nWhen they discover that these are not the only girls who have disappeared in the area, they must race against the clock to stop the killer before another woman is taken. Watch the trailer here. Premieres 17 November on ABC.\n\nFacebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
