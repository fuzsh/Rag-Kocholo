        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Prime Video has ordered the coming-of-age ensemble drama Motorheads, from writer/showrunner John A. Norris (All American) and executive producer Jason Seagraves (Hacksaw Ridge), to series.\n\nRyan Phillippe (Shooter), Nathalie Kelley (The Baker and the Beauty), Michael Cimino (Never Have I Ever) and Melissa Collazo (One Of Us Is Lying) have been set as series regulars.\n\nMotorheads is about first love, first heartbreak, and turning the key in your very first car. Set in a once-thriving rust-belt town that’s now searching for a glimmer of hope, the series is the adrenaline-filled story of a group of outsiders who form an unlikely friendship over a mutual love of automobiles. And while some characters will be navigating the hierarchy and rules of high school, others will be racing from a dark past.\n\nPhillippe will portray Logan, a former NASCAR mechanic who now owns an auto body shop in his hometown of Ironwood, Pennsylvania. Logan is having trouble keeping his shop afloat and lives in the shadow of his infamous brother, Christian Maddox.\n\nKelley has been cast as Samantha, an ER nurse who’s just left her job in New York City to move back with her kids to her rust-belt hometown.\n\nCimino stars as Zac, who knows his dad was a street racing legend in Ironwood, and is desperately trying to live up to his father’s reputation as the best there ever was.\n\nCollazo will bring Caitlyn to life. She is Zac’s sister and a mechanical wiz who’s passionate about cars and knows how to fix them. Caitlyn hopes that moving to her parents’ hometown will help her get a clue into the disappearance of their father.\n\n“Motorheads is a gripping story, anchored around the series of ‘firsts’ that accompany young adulthood. We have an incredible group of actors bringing John’s (out)cast of characters to life and we are excited to share this wistful, nostalgic journey with our global, Prime Video customers,” Lauren Anderson, head of AVOD originals, unscripted and targeted programming at Amazon MGM Studios, tells Deadline in an exclusive statement.\n\n“From the very beginning, Amazon has been so supportive of the vision of the series. And the cast and crew we’ve assembled is beyond my wildest dreams,” shared executive producer Norris.\n\nMotorheads is written and executive produced by John A. Norris, who will serve as showrunner. The series is also executive produced by Jason Seagraves, Jake Fuller on behalf of Jax Media, Dana Brunetti, and Keegan Rosenberger. Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) is attached to direct the pilot and Ryan Zaragoza will serve as co-executive producer. The series is produced by Jax Media and Amazon MGM Studios."
