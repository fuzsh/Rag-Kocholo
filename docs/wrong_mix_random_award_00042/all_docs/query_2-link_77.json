        "text": "Iowa’s top academic students have been chosen by their member schools for the 2024 Governor’s Scholar Program. The Governor’s Office, the Iowa High School Athletic Association, and its title sponsor, the Iowa Farm Bureau, are presenting this recognition which began in 2003.\n\nThe seniors being honored have been selected by their high schools as the highest academic achievers. Students receive a photo plaque from the ceremony and certificate to commemorate their achievement.\n\nThe largest 64 schools in Iowa, according to the Iowa Department of Education BEDS document, were invited to select two seniors who are the highest academic achievers for their first seven semesters. All other schools were invited to select one senior who was the highest academic achiever for their first seven semesters.\n\nCeremony Instructions\n\nArrival\n\nWhen you arrive at the Iowa Events Center, 730 3rd Street, Des Moines, please go to the Grand Ballroom on the 4th Floor. Once inside, please follow the signs to the registration area.\n\nAttire\n\nThis is a semiformal event. The norm for honorees is a range of business casual to business formal. Graphic tees and other promotional attire are not suitable for the photo.\n\nRegistration\n\nRegistration begins at 11:30 a.m. and doors open at 12 p.m. Only the students being honored need to register. There will be registration tables in the lobby of the Grand Ballroom for students to stop and pick up a packet that will contain all materials needed for the ceremony. Only the honorees need to register.\n\nCeremony\n\nThe ceremony begins at 1:00 p.m. Students will be seated together in a section near the front. Guests may seat themselves anywhere in the surrounding sections. The program should be completed by around 3:00 p.m.\n\nPhotography\n\nThe official event photographer is the only photographer allowed to be in front of the stage. Family members and guests are encouraged to take pictures from their seats and may purchase as many pictures as they would like from the professional photographer. Information on purchasing additional photos will be in the registration packet. Each student having their picture taken with the Governor will receive a picture plaque as a keepsake sent to their school compliments of the Iowa High School Athletic Association and its title sponsor Iowa Farm Bureau. Each school will receive a picture and nameplate identifying the student compliments of the Iowa High School Athletic Association and Iowa Farm Bureau. Please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery of the plaques, pictures, and nameplates.\n\nAccommodations\n\nStudents or their guests with special physical needs should contact the IHSAA in advance of the ceremony so that we may accommodate those needs.
