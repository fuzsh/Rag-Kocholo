        "text": "Even before galleys were available, New York Times bestselling author Kristan Higgins’most personal novel to date, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, caused a stir, challenging readers to think about their views on weight and body image. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, a story of three lifelong friends who battle their own, very different issues with weight and body image and eventually learn to be kinder to themselves, went on sale from Berkley on August 7 and is already a hit with audiences and the media. Early this summer, the trade reviews said it all, praising Higgins for her “trademark heart, humor, and emotion, addressing the serious and somber subject of body image and how weight loss has become the obsession of many women and how all too often judgment reigns supreme.” (Library Journal *Starred Review) and recognizing that her “astute, perceptive eye to the best and worst of human nature enhances the poignancy of a sensitive topic, which she navigates with humor and grace” (Kirkus). Booklist called GOOD LUCK WITH THAT “[A] heartbreakingly gorgeous story of female friendship and what it takes to feel comfortable in one’s own skin.”\n\nIn preparation for the publication of GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, Berkley did something it has never done before, sending the author out on a pre-publication book tour in April 2018 to visit real readers at bookstores in four separate markets: Alexandria, VA (Hooray for Books!), Dallas, TX (Fresh Fiction), Chicago, IL (The Book Cellar) and Brooklyn, NY (The BookMark Shoppe). Readers were hand-selected by booksellers to become “ambassadors” of GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, tasked with reading early galleys of the book and committing to come to an event with Kristan prepared to discuss how they felt about the novel’s messages of self-love and body positivity. In each group, everyone laughed, cried, shared their experiences, and walked away feeling a little less alone. On Monday August 6, Kristan spoke to a sold-out luncheon crowd at An Unlikely Story in Plainville, MA followed by an evening event at the Medfield Public Library in Medfield, MA (fellow author and local NBC investigative reporter Hank Phillippe Ryan was in attendance!) On Tuesday, August 7, Kristan was interviewed on stage in front of a 100-person crowd by comedian Lisa Lampanelli, whose current work and writing also deals with weight and body image issues. Lisa and Kristan will be doing similar events in Brooklyn, NY on August 21 at the BookMark Shoppe and on August 23 at R.J. Julia in Madison, CT. Lisa will interview Kristan live on August 21 for AOL Build. Kristan finished out the week with a 150+ person crowd at Litchfield Books on Pawley’s Island, SC on Friday afternoon and is headed further south before heading to the Midwest and the West Coast. On her month-long national tour, Kristan will visit over 15 markets across the country. Kristan is also in the midst of doing a mix of nationally syndicated, NPR affiliate, and regional radio interviews across the country throughout August."
