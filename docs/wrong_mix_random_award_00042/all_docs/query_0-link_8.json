        "text": "When Philadelphia Daily News columnist Pete Dexter's released his novel Brotherly Love in 1991, he was already a National Book Award winner for Paris Trout, and rising the ranks of gritty American authors. His intergenerational tale of corruption, grift, and violence in Philly built on the union hall blues of his debut, God's Pocket, with an insider's view of violence. (Dexter himself famously took up fiction after getting into a brawl: When he got his ass kicked by a bar full of guys mad about a column he wrote, he came back with his friend, boxer Randall \"Tex\" Cobb, and they both ended up in the hospital.) The book was critically lauded, fitting neatly alongside crime classics of the era like Richard Price's Clockers and James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet. In no small part that was because, like those books, it was of its time and place. There was something specific about it. So what happens when you update it 25 years, with inserted references to the 2016 election to give it a sense of timeliness?\n\nSadly, you get Brothers by Blood, a hoary rerun of the classic story of a gangster family divided. The collision is inevitable. Over here, Michael (Kinnaman) under thick, winter-defying layers but with his head exposed like a tough guy, making money off extorted roofing contracts but with aspirations to be more, and worse. By his side is cousin Peter (Schoenaerts), a bulldozer under his worn-out longshoreman's cap. He's Michael's consigliere, but don't use that term around him. That's an Italian term, and good Irish-American businessmen like Michael and Peter would hand down a beating for far less. But for all their connections, and the ease with which they can throw around money, there's a self-destructiveness that wears both men down. Peter, at least, can see that. \"There's no sense hurting yourself on purpose,\" his uncle (Scott) tells his younger self in one of the multitude of flashbacks showing how he took Peter in after the boy's father (Phillippe, in a blink-and-you-will-miss-it cameo) committed one transgression too many. Such moments are intended to weave the twisting threads of tragedy that draw the family bloodily together: unfortunately, they mostly just leave the audience hanging."
