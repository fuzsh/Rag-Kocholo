        "text": "Universal Pictures Russell Crowe plays John\n\nForbes Nash in \"A Beautiful Mind\" with Jennifer\n\nConnelly.\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nStarring Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly\n\nDirected by Ron Howard\n\nRussell Crowe is delusional and insane.\n\nBut never mind his personal life. This describes him in \"A\n\nBeautiful Mind,\" the latest offering from director Ron Howard,\n\nbased on a true story.\n\nCrowe plays John Nash, a mathematical genius who looks at the\n\nworld from a purely logical standpoint, which results in a visible\n\nlack of sociability with both his Princeton colleagues and\n\nunsuspecting coeds.\n\nAccompanying Nash is his roommate Charles, charmingly played by\n\nBritish actor Paul Bettany, who tries to break him out of his\n\nshell.\n\nNash spends most of his time ditching class and pursuing an\n\noriginal idea that would change the course of mathematics forever\n\nand later earn him the Nobel Prize. His relentless pursuit leads\n\nhim to a position as a code cracker for the Pentagon while he\n\nteaches college math.\n\nInterrupting his class is the heart-stopping Jennifer Connelly,\n\ncoming off a performance in the critically acclaimed \"Requiem for a\n\nDream.\" As Nash’s love interest, her Alicia brings a refreshing\n\nchange of pace for a film dominated by male characters for most of\n\nits beginning.\n\nCrowe is fairly convincing as the introverted Nash, occasionally\n\ninjecting the character with flashes of humor and humanity.\n\nEd Harris shows up in the film as William Parcher, a hard-nosed\n\nU.S. secret agent charged with the task of protecting Nash when his\n\ncode cracking attracts the attention of Russian intelligence during\n\nCold War America. At this point, the film gives the audience a hint\n\nof Nash’s paranoia.\n\nHoward does a good job of chronicling Nash’s mental progress,\n\nwhich steadily declines as he becomes more and more immersed in his\n\nwork with Parcher.\n\nThe other progressively worsening situation is Nash’s\n\nrelationship with his wife Alicia. Connelly steals the movie in its\n\nsecond half when her character must cope with Nash’s paranoia and\n\ninability to function.\n\nConnelly is the stabilizing force in a film whose pace is\n\nsomewhat disjointed and slow at points, but to Crowe’s credit the\n\ncharacter of Nash is eccentric enough to keep your attention, even\n\nas the less attractive 65 year old who continues to battle\n\ninsanity.\n\nRobert Salonga\n\nÂ\n\nRevolution Pictures Ty Burrell and\n\nJeremy Piven star in \"Black Hawk Down.\"\n\n\"Black Hawk Down\" Starring Josh Hartnett and Ewan\n\nMcGregor Directed by Ridley Scott\n\nWar is brutal, dirty, ugly and painful, and \"Black Hawk Down\"\n\ndoesn’t let you forget it, even for a minute.\n\nThe two hour barrage of battle sequences hardly gives the viewer\n\ntime to breathe, as 100 American soldiers battle thousands of\n\nSomalian militia in the dusty, war-ravaged city of Mogadishu.\n\nThe movie, based on a real military action in 1993, is a\n\ndisturbingly realistic look at a mission gone wrong that doesn’t\n\nhold anything back.\n\nOf course, war realism in itself isn’t enough reason to see a\n\nmovie, especially after the success in this field of \"Saving\n\nPrivate Ryan.\" Fortunately \"Black Hawk Down\" has a solid story of\n\nreal-life bravery behind it, which helps it hold its own against\n\npredecessors.\n\nEven the participation of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the king\n\nof big, dumb explosion movies, couldn’t do to \"Black Hawk Down\"\n\nwhat he did to his last would-be war epic, \"Pearl Harbor.\" The\n\nmovie doesn’t shy away from the topics of local and world politics,\n\nand whether the presence of U.S. and U.N. forces was\n\nappropriate.\n\nThe team of Bruckheimer and director Ridley Scott (\"Gladiator\")\n\ndoes ensure, however, that the story was told in as visually big\n\nand expensive a way as possible. In a way the explosions and\n\ndeafening, never-ending gunshots and helicopters are distracting\n\nfrom the real issues at hand, but they serve the purpose of\n\ndepicting the harsh reality of modern warfare.\n\nThe acting, on the whole, is excellent, although there are so\n\nmany characters in so many different parts of the city that they\n\nblur together after a while.\n\n\"Black Hawk Down\" is worth watching, especially since it will\n\nlikely be nominated for some Academy Awards.\n\nMary Williams\n\nÂ\n\nUSA Films Ryan Phillippe and Kristin\n\nScott Thomas star in Robert Altman’s \"Gosford Park.\"\n\n\"Gosford Park\"\n\nStarring Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Ryan Phillippe, Kristen\n\nScott Thomas, Emily Watson\n\nDirected by Robert Altman\n\nAnyone thirsty for class, sex, and/or nationality conflict\n\nshould be satisfied by the beautifully well-crafted \"Gosford\n\nPark.\"\n\nSet in a post-WWI English country home, Robert Altman’s new\n\ndramedy enlists a fantastic ensemble cast in a fragile murder\n\nmystery more compelled by characters than plot points.\n\nMaggie Smith is hilariously long-suffering.\n\nShe plays an elderly gentlewoman living only off an allowance\n\nfrom an obligated family member and her well-bred notions of what\n\nis proper. Her deadpan delivery and constant snobbery are the most\n\nhumorous aspect of the film.\n\nIn her role as a frustrated gold-digger in a joyless marriage to\n\na man mostly interested in guns and house maids, Kristen Scott\n\nThomas demonstrates the ultimate in British aristocratic\n\nmalaise.\n\nRyan Phillippe is surprisingly good and devastatingly attractive\n\nas a Hollywood up-and-comer researching a role by pretending to be\n\nhis producer’s servant.\n\nClive Owen’s performance smoothly alternates between darkly\n\nalluring and more darkly volatile.\n\nEmily Watson furthers her reputation as an excellent actress as\n\nshe plays a too-wise and world-weary housemaid letting the guest’s\n\nservants in on the gossipy underbelly of the household.\n\nThe rest of the characters are similarly quirky and well-acted,\n\nmaking the film as a whole a lush cross section of rich and poor,\n\ngood and bad.\n\nAs the guests discuss and rediscuss who has what – money,\n\nposition, affair – the maids, valets and cooks prove to be more\n\nwise than their employers.\n\nAnd, in the end, it is the Americans who are endearingly and\n\nsingularly impervious to classism.\n\n\"Gosford Park\" is smart, funny and poignant. The solid and\n\nintriguing characters coupled with the lovely place and myriad\n\n\"-isms,\" culminate in a very good movie."
