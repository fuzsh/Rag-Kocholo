        "text": "“After crashing their aircraft, they must battle man and beast for their lives,” a synopsis of the film posted to IMDb reads.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News, Phillippe spoke about his experience after the filming of “Prey” was completed.\n\n“It’s interesting because I was kind of in a darker place when we filmed this, and it was right after filming it where I went on this spiritual journey where I started going really deep inside,” Phillippe said.\n\n“I got back into reading the Bible and various other religious tomes, but I found myself drawn to this notion of spirituality,” he continued. “You get to a point in life, a certain age, and the things that you thought would bring you pleasure or make you feel satisfied — these would be success or money — and it doesn’t.”\n\n“I’m so thankful for what I’ve been given and for the experiences that I’ve had and for my children and everything else,” the actor said. “But I wanted to have a relationship and understanding with God, and I was craving that.”\n\nDuring the interview with Fox News, Phillippe also shared how that spiritual journey has transformed his life.\n\n“And I’ve got to tell you, since I started that journey, I have not been more at peace. My depression is gone. I shedded addictions, so I’m a big proponent for people going inward and trying to understand those aspects of life,” he said.\n\nA trailer for the movie “Pray” can be watched here.\n\nImage Credit: ©Getty Images/Kevin Winter / Staff"
