        "text": "Who is Reese Witherspoon?\n\nShe is an American actress with many iconic roles and multiple awards. She is one of the highest-paid actresses in the world.\n\nBirthday\n\n22 March 1976\n\nBirth Place\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, the United States of America\n\nZodiac Sign\n\nAries\n\nPersonal Life\n\nLaura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon was married to Ryan Phillippe between 1999 and 2007. She married Jim Toth in 2011. She has three kids.\n\nProfessional Life\n\nReese Witherspoon debuted in 1991 when she was still a teenager in The Man in the Moon. In 1996, she had a leading role in Fear, but she had a true breakthrough in Cruel Intentions in 1999 and the black comedy Election, where she portrayed Tracy Flick, showcasing her dramatic skills. In 2001, she was cast as Elle Woods in Legally Blonde. She reprised the role in 2003. The film was a big hit and gave Witherspoon a lot more recognition. In 2002, she was in Sweet Home Alabama, a romantic comedy that helped establish herself as a leading actress in comedies. In 2005, she portrayed June Cash in Walk the Line, earning her a Best Actress Academy Award.\n\nAfter this, Witherspoon hit a streak of less successful films, except for 2011 Water for Elephants that was better received. These films reflected Rendition, Four Christmases, Monsters vs. Aliens, and a string of romantic comedies that mostly flopped. She explained the period as a time when she was also struggling personally after her divorce. Finally, she produced and starred in Wild in 2014, which was seen as a comeback, as it was a critical and commercial hit and earned her another Best Actress nomination.\n\nIn 2017, Witherspoon starred in and produced the HBO drama Big Little Lies, followed by the drama The Morning Show from 2019 for Apple TV+, and the Hulu miniseries Little Fires Everywhere in 2020. The shows were critically acclaimed and popular with the viewers.\n\nWitherspoon also owns a clothing company, Draper James, and a production company, Type A Films, that merged with Hello Sunshine in 2016. It focuses on female-led stories, both movies and shows.\n\nThe actress is set to reprise the role of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde 3. The film will involve a collaboration with Mindy Kalling to produce the script.\n\nTrivia\n\nWitherspoon has an Academy Award, two Golden Globes, a British Academy Film Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award.\n\nThe actress is dedicated to various causes, including serving on the board of the Children’s Defense Fund.\n\nWitherspoon hosts the Hello Sunshine book club, a program where she recommends books, mostly female-led stories. The actress describes her love for reading that has been present since childhood.\n\nThere are two Barbie dolls inspired by Reese Whitherspoon, specifically by her roles in Legally Blonde 2 and in A Wrinkle in Time. In addition, the actress is signed to play Barbie in an upcoming live-action film.\n\nThe actress describes her upbringing as Southern and uses it as inspiration for her clothing lines."
