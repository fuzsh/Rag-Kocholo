        "text": "He had cute intentions.\n\nRyan Phillippe went full “dad” mode this Thanksgiving and has the pics to prove it.\n\nThe “Cruel Intentions” star posted a rare photo of his nieces daughter Kai, 12, with whom he shares with “Pitch Perfect” alum Alexis Knapp.\n\n“Had the BEST Thanksgiving wknd w these lil beauties, Sawyer, Ever, Kai & Isla,” Phillippe, 49, wrote on Instagram giving a rundown of what the quintet did over the holiday weekend.\n\n“Pizza was had, ‘Elf’ was watched, ‘Young Sheldon’ was binged (along w teen romance anime),” Phillippe continued. “Boba was had, boardwalk shopping, cooking of pancakes was attempted, and we found some fake snow. + the Eagles beat Buffalo in OT and moved to 10-1, but I think that only mattered to me.”\n\nThe “I Know What You Did Last Summer” actor has primarily kept his youngest daughter off of his social media since she was born in July 2011.\n\nKnapp, 34, and the “Shooter” star dated briefly in 2010 before calling it quits four months later.\n\nFollowing her ex-boyfriend’s lead, Knapp has also kept Kai’s image off Instagram though the “Project X” actress did showcase the duo’s Fourth of July celebration this year.\n\n“4th of July for the 12th time w/ my Kai” the actress gushed adding that it was their “favorite yet.”\n\n“Our favorite yet…Same beaches my father took me at her age & younger, precious memories flooding in,” Knapp continued after posting a video of her and her daughter watching fireworks. “Heart. So at peace… My shmoo shmoo is truly everything.”\n\nKnapp concluded the post saying that she was “thankful.”\n\nWhile Kai is his only child with Knapp, Phillippe also shares daughter Ava, 24 and son Deacon, 20, with Reese Witherspoon, with whom he was married from 1999 to 2008.\n\nSince finalizing their divorce, both Phillippe and Witherspoon, 47, have reportedly presented a united front when it comes to their children.\n\nIn April, the “Big Little Lies” actress and Phillippe were both spotted at the release party for their son’s album “A New Earth.”\n\n“Awesome night w family & friends celebrating the release of, ‘A New Earth’ by @deaconphillippe,” wrote the actor on Instagram asking users to “stream, download, and listen to the album.”\n\nWitherspoon, who separated from her second husband Jim Toth this year, later posted a picture of Spotify’s “New Pop Picks” which featured one of her son’s songs.\n\n“Let’s goooo @deaconphillippe,” the “Legally Blonde” actress said in her Instagram story.\n\nEven though both Deacon and Ava have been seen along with Toth’s 11-year-old son Tennessee on Instagram, it is currently unknown if the duo has any relationship with Kai."
