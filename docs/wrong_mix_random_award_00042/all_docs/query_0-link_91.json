        "text": "Inspired by the recent Christopher Pike thread, anyone else here a fan of her books growing up?\n\nRansom, daughters of eve, stranger with my face, the third eye, a gift of magic, locked in time, down a dark hall and of course the ones which were turned into movies: I know what you did last summer, summer of fear (starring Linda blairs terrible perm) and killing mr griffin. I loved them all. Lois Duncan and VC Andrews were my favorite authors in my childhood after I outgrew Judy Blume and the Babysitters Club.\n\nWhich were your favorites?\n\nOh, man, R2, I imagine she was destroyed. Did you know her daughter?\n\nI absolutely loved her books, even though they mostly had female characters. There was one called \"Down A Dark Hall Way\" that I loved, where the girls in a boarding school were forced to channel great composers/painters/geniuses to create \"new\" Master works. The \"Daughters of Eve\" freaked me out, and I was convinced some girls at my high school were into something like that. \"Locked in Time\"- I've always been a sucker for a time-travel/time overlap love story (Somewhere in Time, Age of Adeline), and, of course, \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\".\n\nI only read Summer of Fear and Killing Mr. Griffin. I remember them both vividly, including when I read them and how I got them. I checked Summer of Fear out of the library and I bought Killing Mr. Griffin in one of those quarterly Scholastic Book ordering things where they passed out these little booklets and you could order books for (I'm assuming) a lower price. I used to order books all the time and I would get so excited when they would be delivered to the classroom. There was nothing like the smell and feel of a crisp new book.\n\nI read a lot of Richard Peck (Secrets of the Shopping Mall was a favorite) and of course Judy Blume. But I graduated pretty early into full on adult books and left YA behind by 7th grade.\n\nRead Killing Mr. Griffin, Stranger with my Face, and IKWYDLS. I remember being shocked at how different that last one was to the movie, but to be fair, a totally faithful adaptation would have been extremely difficult to pull off given the killer, whose identity is revealed until the end, is involved in a major subplot. I enjoy the movie version mostly for the act that it helped restart the renaissance in teen slashers while not being too comedic like the Scream films. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Ryan Phillipe were also at the prime of their careers and made for some good eye candy.\n\nI still collect YA thrillers (most of the ones I grew up can be hard to find these days) and even as an adult have the urge to read them from time to time when I'm nostalgic or just looking for a quick read.\n\nOP, it's a very strange coincidence (to me) that you posted this topic.\n\nI'd read Down a Dark Hall in high school while volunteering at the library. I didn't remember the name or author but over the last couple of weeks the plot themes (possession by some genius artist) became a recurring thought, and I knew I'd read a book about something like that but it was so long ago I'd no idea how to find out the specific book. Now I know, so thank you!"
