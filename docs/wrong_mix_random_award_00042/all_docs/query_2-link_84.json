        "text": "While analyzing 30 years of acceptance speeches, THR found truth to the theory of an “Oscar love curse” — which suggests that women who win best actress typically go on to break up with their partner.\n\nWhen looking at every acting award given from 1986 to 2015, 120 in all (90 of which were in confirmed relationships at the time of their win), more women than men ended up splitting after their Oscar win. Out of 24 best actress winners, 15 of them broke up with a partner, making for a break-up rate of nearly 63 percent.\n\nThe overall findings said that winners were more likely to break up if they did not thank their significant other during the acceptance speech, but when it comes to the \"Oscar love curse,\" it doesn't seem to matter: The majority of best actresses who ended relationships after winning did give thanks, from 2000 and on, especially — including Halle Berry, Reese Witherspoon and Kate Winslet.\n\nMen who won best actor had a lower break-up rate of 44 percent. But in the same time-frame — from 2000 and on — only four of 13 winners ended their relationships post-Oscar.\n\nHere are some of the heartfelt speeches of 13 best actresses and best actors who did express their thanks, but still ended up splitting down the line."
