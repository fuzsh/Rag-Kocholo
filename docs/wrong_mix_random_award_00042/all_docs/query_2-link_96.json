        "text": "Far from Phillippe-ing out, a stunning Reese Witherspoon is thrilled with the single life.\n\nIn October’s Elle magazine (below), the 31-year-old Southern belle and mother of two cracks wry jokes about pet frogs and prostitutes – and makes it clear she’s over her soon-to-be ex Ryan Phillippe.\n\nIn her newest movie, “Rendition,” out next month, Witherspoon stars as a woman whose Egyptian husband is accused of being a terrorist.\n\nAn Oscar-winner for 2005’s “Walk the Line,” Witherspoon is a former cheerleader, debutante and Nashville girls-school grad.\n\n“I wouldn’t be able to do what I do,” she says, of her many movie roles, “if I weren’t all those things. I wouldn’t be able to have the empathy or the capacity to understand different lives.”\n\nShe also takes a slug at the tabloids and a subtle jab at other, less discreet blondes.\n\n“It’s one thing if you’re up for it and you want it, and you go out without your panties on,” she says. “But if you’re wearing panties – gosh darn it, leave me alone!”"
