        "text": "Alabama: Channing Tatum\n\nWith 53 credits on IMDb, 17.2 million followers on Instagram and 21 awards under his belt, Channing Tatum is not only one of Hollywoods biggest heartthrobs, he's also definitely the most famous celebrity who hails from Alabama. After shooting to fame after filming Magic Mike, this former exotic dancer and recent bachelor has a ton of exciting upcoming projects we can't wait for, including Smallfoot (2018), The Lego Movie 2 (2019) and Gambit (2019). To think that it all started in the tiny town of Cullman, Alabama.\n\nRunners-up: Courteney Cox, Octavia Spencer\n\nArizona: Emma Stone\n\nEmma Stone was born in Scottsdale, Arizona, before she relocated to LA with her mom to seek fame while she was still a teen. The actor is known for hits like Easy A, Birdman and La La Land, and over her still-blooming career, she's snagged 114 award nominations, 55 wins and one precious Oscar. Upcoming projects we're looking forward to include The Favourite (2018), Maniac (TV Series, 2018), The Croods 2 (2020) and Cruella (playing Cruella de Vil).\n\nRunners-up: Hailey Baldwin, Joe Jonas, Danielle Fishel, Jordin Sparks, Michelle Branch, Stevie Nicks\n\nArkansas: Mary Steenburgen\n\nWith 103 IMDb movie credits under her belt, actor Mary Steenburgen is known for a slew of hit movies and other projects, including Cross Creek, Parenthood, Back to the Future Part III, Philadelphia, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Elf, The Brave One, Step Brothers, The Proposal and The Help. Steenburgen, who was born in Newport, Arkansas, also won an Oscar in 1980 (though you might not know it) and is working on her next film, Antiquities, due out later this year.\n\nRunner-up: Billy Bob Thornton\n\nCalifornia: Leonardo DiCaprio\n\nThere is a lot of competition for the biggest celebrity who was born and raised in California, but we have to give it to Leonardo DiCaprio. With almost 24 million Instagram followers, 42 movie credits, over 200 award nominations and an Oscar statue, who else could it be? We loved him in The Wolf of Wall Street, Titanic, The Departed, Great Gatsby, Django Unchained and The Revenant (just to name a few), and we can't wait to see his upcoming projects, which include Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), The Black Hand, Killers of the Flower Moon and Roosevelt (yep, he's playing Theodore Roosevelt).\n\nRunners-up: Ben Affleck, Dwayne Johnson, Jessica Alba, Christina Applegate, Paula Abdul, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, George Lucas, Tom Hanks, Clint Eastwood\n\nColorado: Tim Allen\n\nTim Allen was born as Timothy Dick in Denver, Colorado, in 1953. Although he moved away from the state when he was a teenager following the tragic death of his father, he still manages to stay the biggest celebrity Colorado has today. Best known for his role on Home Improvement as well as movies like The Santa Clause, he's racked up 48 credits on IMDb, 22 awards (including a Golden Globe) and 337,000 Twitter followers.\n\nRunners-up: Zachery Ty Bryan\n\nConnecticut: Paul Giamatti\n\nKnown for classics like Sideways, Cinderella Man, 12 Years a Slave and Billions, actor Paul Giamatti was born in New Haven, Connecticut (his father was a professor at Yale). In his 20-year Hollywood career, he's racked up 105 IMDb credits, 59 nominations and 45 awards, including the all-important Oscar. We're looking forward to two of his upcoming flicks: Jungle Cruise and San Andreas 2 (their release dates have not yet been announced).\n\nRunners-up: Meg Ryan, Seth MacFarlane, Glenn Close, Justin Long, Jenna Dewan, Allison Williams\n\nFlorida: Sarah Paulson\n\nSarah Paulson spent her first five years living in Tampa, Florida, until her mother divorced and eventually moved the family to Queens, New York. The most famous celeb to come out of Florida has 1.6 million Instagram followers, 871,000 Twitter followers and 20 awards under her belt, including a Golden Globe for her work on American Crime Story. We also love her in Carol, 12 Years a Slave and Ocean's 8, and we'll probably love her in the upcoming Bird Box (2018), Ratched (2018), Glass (2019) and The Goldfinch (2019).\n\nRunners-up: Ariana Grande, Jason Derulo, Maya Rudolph, Wilmer Valderrama, Chrissy Metz, Eva Mendes, Norman Reedus, Bella Thorne\n\nGeorgia: Julia Roberts\n\nJulia Roberts is one of the most famous celebrities in the whole world, so it's no surprise she's also by far the most famous celebrity to come out of Georgia. The prolific and well-loved actor has 61 credits to her name, 58 awards that we're sure aren't all on display at her house and one Oscar, which we are guessing is somewhere special. When we think of her, we think of Pretty Woman, Erin Brockovich, My Best Friend's Wedding and August: Osage County — and she is still at work, currently filming Ben Is Back (2018) and Little Bee (release date not announced).\n\nRunners-up: Kelly Rowland, Dakota and Elle Fanning, Ed Helms, Chloë Grace Moretz, Raven-Symoné, Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, Kanye West\n\nHawaii: Barack Obama\n\nOK, so he's not your typical celebrity, but he's been on television a lot, and he's written a bunch of books, and he has won the hearts of millions (to the tune of 103 million Twitter followers). He ran the country for eight years, he changed a lot about the field of politics, and people have strong feelings about him, good and bad. Hell, he even has 261 IMDb credits to his name (all for playing himself).\n\nRunners-up: Jason Momoa, Jack Johnson, Bette Midler, Bruno Mars\n\nIdaho: Aaron Paul\n\nAaron Paul is best known for playing lovable meth dealer Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad, although he's currently also a recurring character in two other series that we love: BoJack Horseman and The Path. He's received 19 awards for his acting chops, has millions of social media followers and keeps busy — his upcoming projects include Welcome Home (2018), The Parts You Lose (2019), The Burning Woman (not announced) and Apple's new drama, Are You Sleeping? (not announced)\n\nRunner-up: Sarah Palin\n\nIllinois: Harrison Ford\n\nBorn to two former actors living in Chicago, Harrison Ford is more at the level of icon than celebrity at this point. Known for his career-defining roles in Indiana Jones and Star Wars, the leading man has 76 credits on IMDb and 39 awards to his name — even if he's never received an Oscar for his work. At 75, he's still hard at work — first as the voice on The Secret Life of Pets 2 and then as Indiana Jones one more time for the next movie in the popular Steven Spielberg franchise.\n\nRunners-up: Gillian Anderson, Cindy Crawford, Bill Murray\n\nIndiana: Janet Jackson\n\nAll the Jackson kids were born in Gary, Indiana, and there's a whole lot of talent just under that one rooftop alone. While Michael Jackson met a tragic end, his sister, Janet Jackson, is still hitting way more notes than we even knew existed with a huge fan following (to the tune of 3.45 million Twitter followers alone). She's won five Grammys, dabbled in television and tours stadiums. For all this, she's the biggest celebrity from Indiana, and we salute her.\n\nRunners-up: Greg Kinnear, David Letterman, Adam Lambert, John Mellencamp, Jim Gaffigan, Brendan Fraser, Axl Rose\n\nIowa: Ashton Kutcher\n\nThis superstar had humble beginnings: the son of a factory worker in the small city of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Soon, though, he got his big break on That '70s Show and went on to star in dozens of productions over the next two decades as he quickly shot to fame. He might not have an Oscar (yet) but he does have over 19 million followers on Twitter.\n\nRunners-up: Elijah Wood\n\nKentucky: George Clooney\n\nOh, George — you narrowly beat out Jennifer Lawrence to claim the state of Kentucky, where you were born in the bustling city of Lexington in 1961 (but you already knew that, didn't you?).\n\nThat's right, readers. Long considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors, George Clooney settled down and has kids now, but we still love him just the same, both for movies like Up in the Air, Ocean's Eleven and Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? and for your unstoppable good looks. We also can't wait to see the upcoming miniseries adaptation of Catch-22 (2019).\n\nRunners-up: Jennifer Lawrence, Diane Sawyer, Wynonna Judd, Billy Ray Cyrus, Johnny Depp\n\nLouisiana: Ellen DeGeneres\n\nEllen DeGeneres has 78 million followers on Twitter, and you can see why. This funny lady has been making us laugh and tugging our heart strings since her 1994 sitcom Ellen hit our screens over 20 years ago. Aside from hosting her syndicated TV show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, she's also an actor and activist — and easily the most famous person born and raised in Louisiana.\n\nRunners-up: Jared Leto, DJ Khaled, Reese Witherspoon, Lil Wayne, Tyler Perry, Peyton and Eli Manning, Tim McGraw\n\nMaine: Anna Kendrick\n\nBorn in Portland, Maine, Anna Kendrick has established herself as one of the leading actors in Hollywood, with 49 projects under her belt, including Pitch Perfect, Trolls and the Twilight series. She even got an Oscar nod for her role in Up in the Air with Kentucky's most famous celebrity, George Clooney — and that's on top of her over 7 million Twitter buddies. We (and our kids) can't wait for Trolls World Tour (2020).\n\nRunners-up: Patrick Dempsey, Judd Nelson, Stephen King\n\nMaryland: Michael Phelps\n\nHe's the only Olympian to make our list: Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian in history, with 28 medals to his name, including a staggering 23 gold medals. He's retired as of 2016, but he still gets out and about, tweeting to his 2.23 million followers and doing good through the Michael Phelps Foundation and Michael Phelps Swim School.\n\nRunners-up: Toni Braxton, Tori Amos, Joan Jett, Lisa Loeb, Anna Faris, Goldie Hawn, William H. Macy, Ira Glass, Edward Norton, Jada Pinkett-Smith\n\nMassachusetts: Mark Wahlberg\n\nHe's one of the very few celebrities who have successfully made the move from music to the silver screen, and that amazing crossover appeal is what cinches his win as biggest celebrity from the great state of Massachusetts. He does comedy, he does drama, and he can turn his Boston accent on and off at will. We loved him in The Departed, The Perfect Storm and Ted, and we really wish he could have won at least one of his Oscar nominations. We (and his 3.85 million Twitter followers) are definitely here for his new movie, Mile 22 (2018).\n\nRunners-up: Donnie Wahlberg, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Steve Carell, Matt Damon, Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, Amy Poehler, Barbara Walters, James Taylor\n\nMichigan: Diana Ross\n\nWell, there are famous celebrities, and then there are living legends. Diana Ross fits into that second category, and she scores the win for Michigan even though other huge stars also hail from that state, including Madonna and Stevie Wonder. Ross, who was born and raised in Detroit, started her career with one of the most successful girl groups of all time, The Supremes, and then launched an unparalleled solo career that continues today.\n\nRunners-up: Kristen Bell, Elizabeth Berkley, Dax Shepard, Lily Tomlin, Kid Rock, Iggy Pop, Madonna, Stevie Wonder\n\nMinnesota: Bob Dylan\n\nHere's another living legend: Bob Dylan, who has written some of the best songs and albums we have, got a medal from the president and won a Nobel Prize to boot. Yep, we think he's even more famous than Josh Hartnett and Jessica Biel, even though he doesn't even tweet.\n\nRunners-up: Josh Hartnett, Jessica Biel, Vince Vaughn, Jessica Lange\n\nMississippi: Oprah Winfrey\n\nShe might well be the most famous living celebrity we have as a country, and she's surely the biggest to come out of Mississippi, even though it's the home of Britney Spears. What can we possibly say about the retired talk show host and household name other than that she has won almost every award under the sun (Oscar, Tony, Emmy, Golden Globe, Presidential Medal of Freedom) and that she has 42.7 million Twitter followers? Oprah Winfrey for president? Who knows!? Either way, she's producing The Water Man now and is getting ready to play Aurora Greenway in Terms of Endearment (no release dates have been announced for either project).\n\nRunners-up: Britney Spears, James Earl Jones, Rick Ross, Tig Notaro\n\nMissouri: Brad Pitt\n\nOK, so he was technically born in Oklahoma, but he was no more than a babe when he moved to Springfield, Missouri, and went to public school in the state until he moved to LA just weeks before earning his degree at the University of Missouri. Also, we'd be wrong not to note that back when he was dating Gwyneth Paltrow he threatened to give Harvey Weinstein a \"Missouri whooping\" after the latter tried to give Paltrow an inappropriate massage.\n\nIn any case, this leading Hollywood star is easily the biggest celeb from Missouri since Mark Twain, and with 81 credits to his name, including 12 Monkeys, Moneyball and Fight Club, his career is still going strong. His films Ad Astra and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood are both being released in 2019, and it's been announced that he will star in World War Z 2.\n\nRunners-up: John Goodman, Sheryl Crow, Ellie Kemper, Evan Peters, Eminem, Matt Bomer, Kevin Nealon\n\nMontana: Michelle Williams\n\nActor Michelle Williams spent her first nine years growing up in Kalispell, Montana, where she has fond memories of the vast landscape. All that changed when her family relocated to San Diego, but Big Sky Country can still claim her as theirs.\n\nWilliams is best known for her blockbusters like Brokeback Mountain, Blue Valentine and Manchester by the Sea, but we're also looking forward to the star's upcoming roles in movies like Venom and After the Wedding. And — whoa — she's supposed to play the titular role in the upcoming Janis Joplin biopic (no release date), and we are here for that. She also has six – six – other films currently in the works.\n\nRunners-up: Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Dana Carvey, J.K Simmons\n\nNebraska: Warren Buffett\n\nThis is certainly the only investor who made our list — but you've got to admit that Warren Buffett is more famous than other Cornhuskers on the list, even reality star Farrah Abraham and director Alexander Payne. Besides being one of the richest people in the world and an all-'round nice, down-to-earth guy, this Omaha native also has 1.41 million Twitter followers as well as three IMDb credits, including Entourage, The Office and his own documentary.\n\nRunners-up: Alexander Payne, Nicholas Sparks, Gabrielle Union\n\nNevada: Jena Malone\n\nActor Jena Malone was born in the small city of Sparks, Nevada, and has been giving us some of our favorite characters in amazing mainstream and indie favorites for years, including but not limited to Ellen Foster, Contact, Stepmom, Donnie Darko, Pride & Prejudice, Into the Wild and Sucker Punch. You can check her out on the new Amazon Prime TV series Too Old To Die Young in 2019.\n\nRunners-up: Andre Agassi, Rutina Wesley, Charisma Carpenter\n\nNew Hampshire: Sarah Silverman\n\nThe queen of deadpan comedy, Sarah Silverman was born in Bedford, New Hampshire, and grew up in Manchester. Silverman has been making us laugh since she started her stand-up career in 1992 — and since then, she's had a slew of specials and her own hilarious television program, not to mention some acting spots in movies like Wreck-It Ralph (the sequel comes out in 2018) and School of Rock. Almost 13 million people follower her every update on Twitter.\n\nRunners-up: Mandy Moore, John Irving, Dan Brown, Sam Huntington\n\nNew Jersey: Bruce Springsteen\n\nThere are tons and tons of huge stars who hail from New Jersey, including two formidable Bruces. But only one of them truly embodies the state and sings about it with all he's worth, and that's Bruce Springsteen. He's been making music about his home state for over four decades, and he's still pretty hot to boot. The Boss and his band have sold a staggering 135 million records worldwide, and his albums, from Born to Run to Nebraska to Born in the U.S.A. have major staying power. Also, his fans are rabid.\n\nRunners-up: Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep, John Travolta, Michael Douglas, Tara Reid, Paul Rudd, Danny DeVito, Derek Jeter, Chelsea Handler\n\nNew Mexico: Neil Patrick Harris\n\nNeil Patrick Harris grew up in the itty-bitty village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, after being born in Albuquerque. After becoming a child star, he managed to keep his career afloat his whole life, doing everything to acting to writing to singing to producing to doing magic tricks. With 27.6 million Twitter followers, he's still growing his fan base, though most people still remember him for playing the lead role in Doogie Howser, M.D. Now, you can check him out in A Series of Unfortunate Events on Netflix.\n\nRunners-up: Demi Moore, Adrian Grenier\n\nNew York: Jennifer Lopez\n\nWell, picking the most famous living celebrity from New York was an extremely difficult if not impossible choice. But we decided to go with someone who straddles music and movies, someone who is dating a sports icon and someone who wows the fashion world. Yep, we're talking about Jenny from the Block. You can argue with us, but you won't win: She's got nine albums, 101 IMDb credits, 28 awards and 74 million followers on Instagram. Whew.\n\nRunners-up: Denzel Washington, Jerry Seinfeld, Robert Downey Jr., Amy Schumer, Tom Cruise, Jay-Z, Billy Joel, Robert De Niro, Mariah Carey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Kerry Washington\n\nNorth Carolina: Julianne Moore\n\nJulianne Moore's father was a military judge, and she attended nine different schools across the country during her childhood — but she was born in North Carolina, and they get to claim her! The popular actor is known for Still Alice, The Kids Are Alright, Boogie Nights and The Hours, and we're looking forward to her upcoming flicks as well, which include Gloria (2018), Bel Canto (2018), After the Wedding (not announced) and My Life on the Road (2018).\n\nRunners-up: Vince McMahon, Jaime Pressly, Zach Galifianakis, Michael C. Hall, George Clinton, Edward Snowden\n\nNorth Dakota: Josh Duhamel\n\nNorth Dakota's biggest heartthrob is known for his many roles across television and the silver screen, including All My Children, Love, Simon, Transformers, Safe Haven and When in Rome — and it all started in the little town of Minot, North Dakota, where the star was born in 1972. The actor, who has 2 million Instagram followers and 18 award nominations, actually attended Minot State University and has a dental degree.\n\nRunners-up: Wiz Khalifa, Kellan Lutz\n\nOhio: John Legend\n\nIt's not just a name; John Legend is just that in his hometown of Springfield, Ohio. His mother homeschooled him until he was 12, then he attended a public high school and graduated at 16. Since then, it's been a pretty clear trajectory toward fame, starting when Lauryn Hill hired him to play piano on one of her songs on The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Today, he has five solo albums, 114 soundtrack credits, 40 acting credits, 20 producer credits and an Oscar to boot, not to mention 12.5 million Twitter followers.\n\nRunners-up: Lebron James, Sarah Jessica Parker, Steven Spielberg, Drew Carey, Kid Cudi\n\nOklahoma: Carrie Underwood\n\nIt's fitting that our pick for Oklahoma is a country singer and one with huge crossover success. This past winner of American Idol has won six Grammys and a Golden Globe, plus tons of nominations and has 8.63 million followers on Twitter alone. After selling 65 million records worldwide, she's considered by many to be one of if not the greatest universally successful country singer of all time in terms of hits, which is exactly why we picked her to win over fellow Oklahoma natives Garth Brooks and Toby Keith.\n\nRunners-up: Kristin Chenoweth, Olivia Munn, Bill Hader, Ron Howard, James Marsden, Garth Brooks, Toby Keith\n\nOregon: Ty Burrell\n\nBorn in the little town of Grants Pass, Oregon, Ty Burrell is best known for playing wonder dad Phil Dunphy on the hit ABC sitcom Modern Family. But the native Oregonian has also been in Penguins of Madagascar, Out of Practice, and Back to You, which have all collectively earned him 2 Primetime Emmys as well as 16 other award wins and 45 other nominations.\n\nRunners-up: Kaitlin Olson, Beverly Cleary, Matt Groening, Tonya Harding\n\nPennsylvania: Taylor Swift\n\nBefore she moved to Nashville at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music, pop queen Taylor Swift was born and raised in Pennsylvania: first Reading, then Wyomissing. Although it was a tiny town, the future star was able to travel to New York City easily for singing lessons, and today, she is one of the best-selling artists of all time. Her awards are too many to name, but include 10 Grammys, an Emmy and six Guinness World Records. How much do we love her? She has almost 86 million followers on Twitter.\n\nRunners-up: Will Smith, Kevin Bacon, Joe Biden, Tina Fey, Bradley Cooper, Joe Manganiello, Bob Saget, Lee Daniels, Miles Teller, Krysten Ritter\n\nRhode Island: Damien Chazelle\n\nDamien Chazelle might not be a household name, but we think he's the biggest living celebrity who was born and raised in the tiny state of Rhode Island. The writer, director and producer is best known for his films La La Land, Whiplash and 10 Cloverfield Lane, which have garnered him an Oscar, 68 other award wins and 117 nominations. He's got an upcoming project with Apple TV, and yep, we're going to watch it.\n\nRunners-up: Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Cormac McCarthy, Wylie Dufresne\n\nSouth Carolina: Viola Davis\n\nShe might have grown up in Rhode Island (and many Rhode Islanders claim her as theirs), but this Oscar-winning actor was born in St. Matthews, South Carolina, in 1965. She then rose up from abject poverty to be a Triple Crown actor: holding an Oscar as well as an Emmy and Tony. She's best known for the acting clinics she's put on in The Help, Fences and How to Get Away With Murder, and we (and her 2.6 million Instagram followers) are excited to see what the future will bring with her upcoming projects Widows (2018) and Troupe Zero (not announced). Davis is also gearing up to star in an untitled project in which she'll be portraying Harriet Tubman.\n\nRunners-up: Chris Rock, Anna Camp, Andy Dick, Mary-Louise Parker, Andie MacDowell\n\nSouth Dakota: January Jones\n\nSparsely settled South Dakota has not produced a huge number of stars, but it can claim at least one mega-celebrity: January Jones. Best known for her performance as Betty Draper on AMC's hit show Mad Men, Jones has 29 other acting credits to her name, including her recent role on The Last Man on Earth. With 600,000 Instagram followers and two Golden Globes to her name, she's far from done showing us her talent.\n\nRunners-up: Tom Brokaw, Mary Hart\n\nTennessee: Justin Timberlake\n\nAll hail one of the most successful crossover artists we have ever seen: the multitalented Justin Timberlake. He's not bad-looking either. This singer and actor has won 10 Grammy Awards, four Emmy Awards, seven American Music Awards, three Brit Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards and 11 MTV Video Music Awards — and for that, he has 66 million Twitter followers. We love all his singles, but we're probably most looking forward to two of his upcoming film projects: Trolls World Tour (2020) and Spinning Gold (not announced).\n\nRunners-up: Morgan Freeman, Miley Cyrus, Megan Fox, Kenny Chesney, Kathy Bates, Christina Hendricks\n\nTexas: Beyoncé\n\nThere have been a lot of people born in Texas. Like, millions. But there has only ever been one Beyoncé, and she was born in Houston in 1981. All six of her full-length albums have debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts (no other artist can say that), and honestly, we just want to know basically everything that she does at every moment because she is so cool. Maybe that's why she has 115 million Instagram followers.\n\nRunners-up: Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Alexis Bledel, Carol Burnett, Hilary Duff\n\nUtah: Julianne Hough\n\nRoseanne Barr is more of a household name, but you know what? We're going to give the crown to ABC's Dancing with the Stars darling Julianne Hough, who was born in Orem, Utah, in 1988 along with her also-talented brother Derek. One thing we love about Hough is her versatility: Not only does she dance, she also acts, sings and is an award-winning choreographer. Hough has two new movies coming out, Bigger and TV movie One Hit Wendy and frequently keeps her 4.2 million Instagram followers and 1.29 Twitter followers up to date. Sounds way better than what Roseanne's been up to.\n\nRunners-up: Roseanne Barr, Derek Hough, Donny Osmond, Steve Young\n\nVermont: Melissa Leo\n\nThis was even tougher than Alaska. Vermont is so small and sparsely populated that it hasn't produced a huge number of stars. But the wonderful actor Melissa Leo did spend a good deal of her childhood growing up on a commune in Putney, Vermont, after her parents divorced. This lifelong actor has been in well over 100 productions, though she's best known for All My Children, Homicide: Life on the Streets, The Fighter and Frozen River. Look for her soon in The Equalizer 2 (2018), Run With the Hunted (2019) and Always on My Mind (not announced).\n\nRunners-up: Daphne Zuniga, Joe Perry, Miranda July\n\nVirginia: Sandra Bullock\n\nSuperstar actor Sandra Bullock was born in Arlington, Virginia, and was raised between Virginia and Germany, where her mom, an opera singer and voice teacher, was from. We love this timeless actor and producer for her contributions to classics like Speed, Miss Congeniality and While You Were Sleeping, and we couldn't be happier that she's won an Oscar along with 75 other notable awards throughout her career.\n\nLook for her later this year in the movie Bird Box.\n\nRunners-up: David Arquette, Penn Badgley, Leslie Bibb, Lauren Graham\n\nWashington: Chris Pratt\n\nOK, so technically Chris Pratt was born in Virginia, Minnesota, but at the tender age of 3, he moved to Lake Stevens, Washington, where he was raised (and even competed on the high school wrestling team). He's been in everything from Everwood, Parks and Recreation and The OC to Moneyball, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Lego Movie and Jurassic World, which probably has something, but not everything, to do with why he has 5.85 million Twitter followers.\n\nWe don't know what 2019's Cowboy Ninja Viking flick is all about, but yes, we want to see it badly.\n\nRunners-up: Anna Faris, Kyle MacLachlan, Craig T. Nelson, Constance Zimmer, Rose McGowan, Rainn Wilson, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Bill Gates, Macklemore, Hope Solo\n\nWisconsin: Heather Graham\n\nActor Heather Graham was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1970 and lived there until she was 9 years old and her family relocated to California. With 96 credits to her name, she is known for productions like Austin Powers, Swingers, Boogie Nights and Bowfinger. Most recently, she wrote and directed (and starred in) the movie Half Magic. We love her just as much as her 70,000 Twitter followers.\n\nRunners-up: Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Tony Shalhoub\n\nWyoming: Jim Beaver\n\nHe might not be a household name, but you probably recognize him from the A+ work he's done on Supernatural, Deadwood and Justified. And he's a working actor who has 141 credits under his belt. He's starring in the upcoming film Hospitality as 'The Boss' later this year alongside Emmanuelle Chriqui and Sam Trammell.\n\nRunners-up: Scott Avett, Dick Cheney, Pete Williams"
