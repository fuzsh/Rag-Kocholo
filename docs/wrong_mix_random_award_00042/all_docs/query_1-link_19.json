        "text": "Ryan Phillippe was on dad duty this Thanksgiving ‚Äî and he shared sweet snaps with his daughter Kai to prove it.\n\nThe actor posted a rare selfie with the 12-year-old and his nieces in an Instagram slideshow Monday.\n\n‚ÄúHad the BEST Thanksgiving wknd w these lil beauties. Sawyer, Ever, Kai & Isla,‚Äù he gushed.\n\n‚ÄúPizza was had, Elf was watched, Young Sheldon was binged(along w teen romance anime). Boba was had, boardwalk shopping, cooking of pancakes was attempted, and we found some fake snow.‚Äù\n\nPhillippe, 49, also gave a glimpse of their fun-filled Delaware holiday in the social media upload.\n\nThe ‚ÄúShooter‚Äù star has mostly kept Kai off Instagram since he and Alexis Knapp welcomed their baby girl in July 2011.\n\nThe former couple were already broken up at the time.\n\nWhile Knapp, 34, tends to keep Kai‚Äôs life out of the spotlight as well, she did highlight their Fourth of July fun this summer.\n\nFor more Page Six you love‚Ä¶\n\nListen to our weekly ‚ÄúWe Hear‚Äù podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n‚ÄúOur favorite yet,‚Äù the actress gushed at the time. ‚ÄúSame beaches my father took me at her age & younger, precious memories flooding in. Heart. So at peace‚Ä¶ My shmoo shmoo is truly everything üíúüíúü•πüß¨üß¨üíóüôèüèºthankful.‚Äù\n\nKai is Knapp‚Äôs only child. Phillippe, for his part, is also the father of daughter Ava, 24, and son Deacon, 20, with Reese Witherspoon.\n\nThe ‚ÄúCruel Intentions‚Äù co-stars have put on a united front while co-parenting their kids since finalizing their divorce in October 2007 after eight years of marriage.\n\nMost recently, the duo showed support for Deacon at his ‚ÄúA New Earth‚Äù album release party in April.\n\nWhile Ava and Deacon often appear in photos with Witherspoon and her second husband Jim Toth‚Äôs 11-year-old son, Tennessee, it is unclear whether they have a relationship with Kai."
