        "text": "A Note From\n\nFounder Senator Elizabeth Dole\n\n“When my husband Bob Dole was admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for an extended period of time in 2011, my eyes were opened to the tremendous challenges facing the loved ones caring for our wounded, ill and injured warriors. Following Bob’s hospitalization, I established the Elizabeth Dole Foundation to help raise awareness and seek solutions for our military caregivers.\n\nWe commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct the first national comprehensive evidence-based study of military and veteran caregivers. The research revealed a societal crisis requiring a holistic national response. There are more than 5.5 million military and veteran caregivers in the United States. Countless spouses, parents and other loved ones transform their lives and set aside their own careers to care for those who cared for us. In most cases the caregivers begin this journey in total isolation, without any support.\n\nHidden Heroes is our way of providing these selfless men and women serving in the shadows with the help and recognition they deserve.”\n\n– Senator Elizabeth Dole, @DoleFoundation\n\nCampaign Chair\n\nTom Hanks\n\nHidden Heroes Campaign Chair, Tom Hanks, uses his voice to bring attention to our nation’s military caregiving crisis. With his dedication to the campaign, we are breaking down barriers and providing military caregivers with the help they so desperately need.\n\n“Unseen and undefined, there are millions of heroes who are caring for our wounded veterans each day. I join with Senator Dole in this important national campaign to make us all aware of these hidden heroes – to acknowledge what they do … to connect them to valuable resources. Military caregivers rarely ask for help, but they deserve our support.”\n\nFollow Tom Hanks on Twitter.\n\nCampaign Vice Chair\n\nJennifer Pritzker\n\nJennifer N.
