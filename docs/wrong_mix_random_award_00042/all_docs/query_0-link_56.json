Immediately following the viewing of the tape, the phone rings, and the voice on the other end gives the victim one week to live. A young reporter named Rachel is investigating these events, but after she and her small son watch the tape, it becomes a race against time to find out why the tape is killing people and how it can be stopped. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, disturbing images, language and some drug references. Bowling for Columbine (2002) (R) 119 minutes\n\nFriday February 07, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday February 09, 7pm in 26-100\n\nMichael Moore (Roger and Me) delivers a hilarious, caustic documentary about gun control in the United States. A gun-toting member of the NRA, Michael is nevertheless inclined to ask why guns are so often used by one American to kill another. Is the media to blame? Is American history? Is it the lack of gun control? In his search for answers, Mr. Moore interviews such notables as Dick Clark, Marilyn Manson, Charlton Heston, and Matt Stone, as well as some of the victims of the Columbine shooting. This is interspersed with a ruthless review of American History, in cartoon and documentary format, and revealing footage from speeches by everyone from Dylan Klebold to President George W. Bush. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune writes that Bowling for Columbine is \"unnerving, stimulating, likely to provoke anger and sorrow on both political sides -- and, above all...extremely funny.\" Rated R for some violent images and language. Punch-Drunk Love (2002) (R) 94 minutes\n\nSaturday February 08, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday February 09, 10pm in 26-100\n\nIn this off-beat romantic comedy, Adam Sandler plays a small-business owner who, in the same day, finds a harmonium on the street, discovers a scheme to get unlimited frequent flyer miles by buying pudding, and meets the girl of his dreams. He embarks on a romantic journey unlike any other, but not before becoming entangled in a phone-sex scandal attempting to steal his money. Watch as he attempts to defeat four blonde brothers and his own repressed violent nature, collect his miles, and find love. Michael Rechtshaffen of the Hollywood Reporter calls Punch-Drunk Love \"a delightfully idiosyncratic romantic comedy that manages to give convention a swift jab in the gut while still pushing all of the genre's requisite buttons.\" Rated R for strong language including a scene of sexual dialogue. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) (Unrated) 91 minutes\n\nFriday February 14, 7:30 and 10:30 in 10-250\n\nCelebrate Valentine's Day with one of the most romantic and heartfelt films ever made. A film that Siskel & Ebert gave \"Two big thumbs up! If you don't have a theatre in your town playing it... BUILD ONE!\"\n\nAcclaimed French actress Catherine Deneuve, in her first on-screen role, plays Genevi√®ve Emery, an assistant in her mother's umbrella shop. In love with an auto mechanic named Guy (Nino Castelnuevo) who is drafted to fight in Algeria, she finds herself pregnant. Subsequent events and the too-emotional-for-words conclusion are guaranteed to leave every viewer misty-eyed.\n\nAn international sensation -- nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. A bold and innovative experiment in filmmaking, director Jacques Demy had every line of dialogue sung to Michel Legrand's masterful score.\n\nLSC will be showing the 1993 restoration of this film, which brought back the bright and vivid colors of the original film and features a Dolby Stereo mix. In (sung) French with English subtitles.\n\nSecretary (2002) (R) 104 minutes\n\nFriday February 14, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday February 16, 7pm in 26-100\n\nValentine's Day special: you've seen the straight, now see the kinky.\n\nCelebrate Valentine's Day in style by experiencing the unexpected chemistry between a young woman who likes to cut herself and the sadomasochistic lawyer who abuses her. Recently released from a mental institution, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) seeks employment at the office of Mr. Grey (James Spader). \"It's very dull,\" he warns. \"I like dull work,\" she asserts. Is it just a bad job, or is it a match made in heaven? Rated R for strong sexuality, some nudity, depiction of behavioral disorders, and language.\n\nDiscount offer for MIT secretaries: Bring your boss* and you can both get in for $5.\n\n*: Offer only valid for those listed as Administrative Assistants in the MIT Directory. LSC does not condone improper relationships between workers and their supervisors; for the purposes of this offer, \"boss\" is hereby defined as \"whomever you choose.\" Offer cannot be combined with the Multipass offer, but Moviecards will be stamped.\n\nSpirited Away (2001) (PG) 124 minutes\n\nSaturday February 15, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday February 16, 10pm in 26-100\n\nLSC presents the subtitled (not dubbed) version of this new animated classic. Critically acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke) presents the story of a young girl, Chihiro, who has become lost in the spirit world with her parents. Upon encountering an empty restaurant, Mom and Dad don't hesitate to sit down and dig in, but Chihiro senses danger and refuses. As night falls, she is terrified to see the area fill with faceless spirits, and when she runs to her parents, she discovers that they have been turned into pigs. A mysterious boy named Haku comes to her aid. In exchange for her name, he finds her employment in a nearby bath-house which caters to thousands of Japan's gods and spirits. The work is hard and the people strange, but Chihiro succeeds through effort and perseverence. However, her parents are still waiting in the bath-house's stockyard, and Chihiro must find a way to break the spell on them before they end up as the main course of some guest's dinner. Rated PG for some scary moments. In Japanese with English subtitles. President's Day, MIT Student Holiday\n\nMonday February 17 LSC Classics presents... Dersu Uzala (1974) (G) 137 minutes\n\nFriday February 21, 7pm and 10:30pm in 26-100\n\nSunday February 23, 7pm in 26-100\n\nA seldom-seen masterpiece from legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Based on the memoirs of 19-century Russian Army officer Vladimir Arseniev, the film chronicles his explorations in Siberia, where he meets an Asiatic hunter, the film's namesake. At first looking on him as an uncivilized and comic character, Arseniev grows to respect him for his skills in the wilderness. The bonds of friendship and loyalty deepen, but Dersu finds his skills useless when Arseniev takes him back to the city.\n\nThis is the first film made by Kurosawa after his suicide attempt. Spurned by Japanese funding sources, who considered his films too \"western,\" he finally directed this film using Soviet funding. Photographed in 70mm Super Sovscope, this is his ONLY large-format film, showing off his masterful cinematography to even greater effect.\n\nLSC will be showing a BEAUTIFUL NEW PRINT of this 30-year old film. Not to be missed on the big screen! In Russian with English subtitles.\n\nIgby Goes Down (2002) (R) 97 minutes\n\nSaturday February 22, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday February 23, 10:30pm in 26-100\n\nCombine a rebellious teenager named Igby (Kieran Culkin) with his obsessive-compulsive mother (Susan Sarandon), his pompous older brother (Ryan Phillippe), his mother's lovers (Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum), and some gorgeous but troubled ladies (Claire Danes, Amanda Peet), and what do you get? Igby Goes Down, a comedy with superb acting and perfect timing. Part coming-of-age story, part romance, and part delicious satire, this film will have you laughing out loud during the movie, and thinking hard about human nature afterwards. Rated R for language, sexuality and drug content. Standing in the Shadows of Motown (2002) (PG) 116 minutes\n\nFriday February 28, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday March 02, 7pm in 26-100\n\nIn 1959, Berry Gordy Jr. gathered the best musicians from Detroit's thriving jazz and blues scene to begin cutting songs for his new record company. Over a fourteen year period, they were the heartbeat on every hit from Motown's Detroit era. By the end of their phenomenal run, this unheralded group of musicians had played on more number one hits than the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, Elvis, and the Beatles combined -- which makes them the greatest hit machine in the history of popular music. They called themselves the Funk Brothers. Forty-one years after they played their first note on a Motown record and three decades since they last appeared together, the Funk Brothers reunite back in Detroit to play their music and tell their unforgettable story, with the help of archival footage, still photos, narration, interviews, re-creation scenes, 20 Motown master tracks, and twelve new live performances of Motown classics with the Brothers backing up contemporary performers. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine writes, \"It's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more.\" Rated PG for language and thematic elements. Solaris (2002) (PG-13) 99 minutes\n\nSaturday March 01, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday March 02, 10pm in 26-100\n\nSteven Soderbergh (Erin Brokovich, Ocean's Eleven) directs this remake of the 1972 Russian Science Fiction classic. Years of grieving for his dead wife have worn Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) down to his core. A psychologist by profession, Chris is summoned by the government to a remote space station in the far reaches of the universe. The station is orbiting a mysterious planet called Solaris, and the crew aboard is experiencing strange dream-like manifestations that have led one crew member to suicide. Upon arrival, Chris soon begins to experience the power of Solaris as his long dead wife (Natascha McElhone) suddenly appears and attempts to rekindle their romance. Apprehensive at first, Chris soon realizes that this bizarre alien occurrence just might be his coveted second chance to live happily with his wife, even when all the signs point to insanity and ultimately death. Rated PG-13 on appeal for sexuality/nudity, brief language and thematic elements. Global Environmental Issues: Effects on the Atmosphere and the Biosphere\n\nThursday March 06, 7pm in 10-250\n\nFord/MIT Nobel Laureate Lecture series presents: Eric Chivian and Mario J. Molina. Steamboat Bill, Jr (1928) (Unrated) 71 minutes (silent with live piano accompaniment)\n\nFriday March 07, 9pm in 10-250\n\nReturn to the heydays of cinema and Hollywood with this well-known silent film. One of Buster Keaton's many comedies, replete with sight gags and clever on-screen imagery that only works in a silent film. See an entire house fall on Buster, then watch amazedly as he walks away unscathed! Made in the days when talking about digital effects would have gotten you laughed at, this film will have you marveling with the \"How did they do that?\" wonder that's missing from the cinema today.\n\nThe difference between canned music and live accompaniment is like night and day. LSC is pleased to announce that this film will feature live piano accompaniment by Prof. Martin Marks, who has contributed his talents to the musical accompaniment of many silent film restoration projects. We would like to express our appreciation for his time and help.\n\nShort preceding movie: Steamboat Bill, Jr (1922), (the original movie) also B&W and silent with live accompaniment.\n\nLSC Classics presents... Le Placard a.k.a. The Closet (2001) (R) 84 minutes\n\nFriday March 07, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100 (Add Date)\n\nSunday March 09, 7pm in 26-100\n\nA hilarious film that will have you falling out of your seat with laughter, The Closet plays subtle twists on the politics of homosexuality. A worker in a condom factory pretends to be gay so that his boss can't fire him, causing a bigoted coworker (renowned French actor Gerard Depardieu) to befriend him so that he can look gay too. As Stephen Holden writes in The New York Times, this film has \"more delicious, chortling fun ... than any movie I've seen in ages.\"In French with English subtitles.\n\nThis program was made possible with the support of the Cultural Services of the French Embassy and the French Ministry of Culture (CNC).\n\nDas Experiment (2001) (R) 120 minutes\n\nSaturday March 08, 5pm and 8pm in 26-100\n\nSunday March 09, 10pm in 26-100\n\nTarek Fahd (Moritz Bleibtreu, Run Lola Run) is a young, fit, unemployed journalist who answers an advertisement for subjects for a psychological study. He and the other volunteers are to be divided into prisoners and guards for a period of two weeks. Tarek plans to surreptitiously photograph the experiment for a newspaper. He is assigned the role of prisoner, and to make his article more interesting, begins to challenge authority. Predictably, the guards begin to escalate, and what began as a mild role-playing game quickly turns to violence. Soon, Tarek's journalistic goal is replaced by the necessity simply to survive.\n\nThe premise of this film is based on the famous Stanford Prison Experiment, but this is no dry psychology lecture. The film extends the experiment to its logical conclusion, and the ending will leave you shocked. After the release of the film, the Stanford experimenters insisted that a disclaimer be added to distinguish the film from the actual experiment. Come see what the fuss is all about! In German with English subtitles\n\nWater Drops on Burning Rocks (2000) (Unrated) 90 minutes\n\nFriday March 14, 7:30 and 10:30 in 10-250\n\n...The newest film from Francois Ozon (See the Sea, Sitcom, Criminal Lovers, and Under the Sand). Adapted from an unproduced play written by the great Rainer Werner Fassbinder at the age of 19, it is set in Germany in the 1970s. Leopold, a smug, still-hunky 50-year-old businessman, picks up and seduces fresh-faced, carrot-topped 19-year-old Franz who swiftly moves into his bachelor pad. Their cozy relationship soon sours as Leopold, a kind of gone-to-seed Dirk Bogarde, turns cranky and argumentative. When Franz's buxom blond girlfriend surfaces, and then Leopold's elegant and enigmatic ex, things get funnier, steamier and a lot more complicated.\n\nThis program was made possible with the support of the Cultural Services of the French Embassy and the French Ministry of Culture (CNC).\n\nReal Women Have Curves (2002) (PG-13) 90 minutes\n\nFriday March 14, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday March 16, 7pm in 26-100\n\nThis is the story of Ana, a first generation Mexican-American teenager on the verge of becoming a woman. Freshly graduated from high school, Ana receives a full scholarship to Columbia University. However, her very traditional old-world parents feel that now is the time for Ana to help provide for the family, not the time for college. Torn between her mainstream ambitions and her cultural heritage, she agrees to work with her mother at her sister's downtown LA sewing factory. Over the summer she learns to admire the hardworking group of women who teach her solidarity and teamwork. Still at odds with what her mother expects of her, Ana realizes that leaving home to continue her education is essential to finding her place in the world as a proud American and Chicana. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times calls this film \"effervescent and satisfying, a crowd pleaser that does not condescend,\" while Roger Ebert says Real Women Have Curves is \"enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age.\" Rated PG-13 for sexual content and some language. Star Trek X: Nemesis (2002) (PG-13) 116 minutes\n\nSaturday March 15, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday March 16, 10pm in 26-100\n\nThe crew of the Enterprise NCC-1701E reunite for one final journey as crew...and family. This story begins with the wedding of two beloved characters, and ends with an epic space battle. In between, we are introduced to a new Data-like android and a villian who is as familiar as he is sinister. Along the way, we see tragedy, heroism, a search for humanity's defining traits, and of course, the Earth saved from destruction. Return to a treasured world where people...and aliens...are good at heart, and evil can always be defeated. And yes, this is an even one, so it's good! Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and peril and a scene of sexual content. Frida (2002) (R) 118 minutes\n\nThursday March 20, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nFriday March 21, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100 (Last Day Before Break)\n\nNominated for two Golden Globes, and the winner for Best Original Score, Frida chronicles the life artist Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) shared unflinchingly and openly with Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) as the young couple took the art world by storm. From her complex and enduring relationship with her mentor and husband to her illicit and controversial affair with Leon Trotsky, to her provocative and romantic entanglements with women, Frida Kahlo lived a bold and uncompromising life as a political, artistic, and sexual revolutionary. Richard Roeper of Ebert & Roeper writes that \"Frida is a film that celebrates but never sugarcoats the hard but exciting life of a brave artist.\" Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune says this movie \"seizes you up, catches fire, and dances.\" Rated R for sexuality/nudity and language. Spring Break\n\nSaturday March 22\n\nSunday March 30 FREE SNEAK PREVIEW\n\nWhat a Girl Wants (2003) (PG)\n\nTuesday April 01, 8pm in 26-100\n\nDaphne, a free-spirited 19-year-old New Yorker (Amanda Bynes) raised by her equally free-spirited mother (Kelly Preston) goes to England to establish a relationship with her father (Colin Firth), who doesn't know that she exists. He turns out to be a prominent political figure heavily involved in social customs.

FREE SNEAK PREVIEW\n\nA Man Apart (2003) (R)\n\nThursday April 03, 8pm in 26-100\n\nA Man Apart features Vin Diesel (Xander Cage from XXX) in a compelling role as tough DEA agent Sean Vetter, who sets out to avenge the brutal murder of his wife in a botched hit. As the drug wars rage along the US/Mexican border, a major player from the Baja Cartel is imprisoned and a mysterious figure known as Diablo wrests control over the entire operation. Vetter, consumed by his desire for revenge, and his partner Demetrius Hicks (Larenz Tate) must join forces with the jailed Cartel boss to hunt down this dangerous and elusive new player. Tickets available at 6pm in lobby 16. MIT ID required. LSC Classics presents... Spartacus (1960) 198 minutes\n\nFriday April 04, 6pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday April 06, 6pm in 26-100 (Daylight Savings Time Begins)\n\nAn epic in every sense of the word, Spartacus will show you just what was missing from Gladiator. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey) spares no effort (or expense) to bring to the screen a story of love, privilege, turmoil, and the birth of freedom.\n\nKirk Douglas (Michael Douglas' father), stars as Spartacus, a Thracian slave purchased by Lentulus Batiatus (comic actor Peter Ustinov), owner of a gladiatorial school. The ever-present specter of death comes to a head when Spartacus barely escapes death in a gladiatorial joust for the amusement of Marcus Licinius Crassus (the legendary Laurence Olivier). The slaves break out in revolt, and the subsequent challenge to Republican Rome brings in such characters as Lucullus, Pompey, and, of course, Julius Caesar.\n\nMore true to history than most other sword-and-sandal epics, this film features a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten blacklisted during the McCarthyist days for suspected Communist affiliation. A vast drama, filmed in the sprawling canvas of large-format Super Technirama 70, Spartacus combines vast battles with moments of quiet contemplation, and features literate and intellectual dialogue that Hollywood gave up decades ago.\n\nLSC will be showing the uncut 1991 restoration of this film, which includes the (in)famous \"oysters and snails\" homosexual scene (with Anthony \"Hannibal Lecter\" Hopkins dubbing for the late Olivier).\n\nDue to the length of this feature, there will be an intermission.\n\nThe Trials of Henry Kissinger (2002) (Unrated) 80 minutes\n\nSaturday April 05, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday April 06, 10pm in 26-100 (Daylight Savings Time Begins)\n\nPart contemporary investigation and part historical inquiry, this documentary follows the quest of one journalist in search of justice. The film focuses on Christopher Hitchens' charges against Henry Kissinger as a war criminal -- allegations documented in Hitchens' book of the same title -- based on his role in countries such as Cambodia, Chile, and Indonesia. Kissinger's story raises profound questions about American foreign policy and highlights a new era of human rights. Increasing evidence about one man's role in a long history of human rights abuses leads to a critical examination of American diplomacy through the lens of international standards of justice. Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe calls The Trials of Henry Kissinger \"a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for Kissinger as a calculating war criminal,\" and Michael Rechtshaffen of the Hollywood Reporter exclaims, \"both damning and damned compelling.\" Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) (PG) 161 minutes\n\nFriday April 11, 7pm and 10:30pm in 26-100\n\nSunday April 13, 7pm in 26-100\n\nIn this second installment of the cinematographic version of the literary phenomenon known as Harry Potter, the boy wizard is about to enter his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is visited by a mischievous and self-effacing house-elf named Dobby and warned not to go back to Hogwarts. However, desperate to escape the abuses of his muggle family and return to his friends in the magic world, Harry ignores this warning. At school, strange things start to happen. People are becoming petrified, and noone knows who -- or what -- is responsible. Harry repeatedly hears a voice -- a voice which seems to be coming from within the walls. He fears that a mythical and dangerous room called the Chamber of Secrets has been opened, but legend dictates that only Salazar Slytherin's true descendent can open it. When the students realize that Harry has many of the qualities attributed to the Slytherin heir, he is immediately suspect. Harry must fight bolder challenges and more dangerous threats than last year's in order to prove his innocence and rescue the students from a sinister and powerful villain. Rated PG for scary moments, some creature violence and mild language. About Schmidt (2002) (R) 125 minutes\n\nSaturday April 12, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday April 13, 10:30pm in 26-100\n\nWarren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson, Golden Globe 2003 Best Actor in a Drama) is dealing with several life-changing events, including his retirement, his wife's death, and his daughter's marriage, and is feeling utterly adrift. He sets out on a journey of self-discovery, exploring his roots across Nebraska in the 35-foot motor home in which he had planned to drive around the country with his late wife. His ultimate destination is Denver, where he plans to make peace with his estranged daughter by helping with the wedding preparations. However, he detests the groom-to-be, and doesn't feel much more kindly towards his soon-to-be in-laws. He begins to contemplate halting the marriage altogether. Meanwhile, he finds an unexpected new friend and confessor -- a six-year-old Tanzanian orphan whom he sponsors through an organization he saw advertised on television. While writing long letters to the young boy, Warren begins for the first time to glimpse himself and the life he has lived. Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times writes, \"Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy, hope and despair, About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way most of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorbtion and insistently demanding otherness.\" Rated R for some language and brief nudity. The Lady and the Duke (2001) (PG-13) 125 minutes\n\nFriday April 18, 7:30 and 10:30 in 10-250\n\nA stunning use of digital technology, The Lady and the Duke takes the viewer back two hundred years with meticulously recreated French Revolution backdrops framing the digitally-\"filmed\" actors.\n\nBased on the autobiography of Englishwoman Grace Elliot (Lucy Russell), the film follows her adventures in France with her lover Philippe, the Duke of Orl√©ans. As the clouds of Revolution approach, she clings to her aristocratic upbringing, while the Duke aligns himself with Revolutionary politics. When the Terror arrives, the pair faces a stark moral choice between giving in to the mob and dying for their principles.\n\nHistorically accurate, and replete with links to royalty (Elliot was a onetime lover of the Prince of Wales, future King George IV of England, and the Duke is the father of future King Louis Philippe of France), The Lady and the Duke is for everyone who wants to be educated, entertained, and challenged. In French and German with English subtitles.\n\nThis program was made possible with the support of the Cultural Services of the French Embassy and the French Ministry of Culture (CNC).\n\nDie Another Day (2002) (PG-13) 132 minutes\n\nFriday April 18, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday April 20, 7pm in 26-100\n\nJames Bond returns in this latest franchise installment, starring Pierce Brosnan and Oscar winner Halle Berry, with Golden Globe nominated musical theme by Madonna. Bond is captured during a failed assassination attempt on Colonel Moon, a North Korean army officer and arms dealer, after someone alerts Moon's hitman Zao to the plot. Released several years later in a prisoner exchange, Bond sets out to discover the traitor and kill Zao. The trail leads him to evil genius Gustav Graves.

Rather than be discouraged, Frank Jr. embraced these lessons and adopted deceit as his career, assuming the guise of doctor, lawyer, and pilot (among others). Not content to look like a jet setter, Frank embarked on a global cheque bouncing spree to the tune of $2.5 million that earned him a spot on the FBI's Most Wanted List -- quite a feat for a 17-year-old high school dropout.

In the 1950's, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), reads the book. In 2001, Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep, Golden Globe Best Supporting Actress 2003), lives the story. A tapestry of events unfolds, and as the camera switches between the women and their eras, we see the connections that unite them...and us.\n\nThe Tech calls The Hours \"a fantastic film with outstanding acting and an incredibly human theme.\" Steven Holden of The New York Times raves, \"Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain.\" Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements, some disturbing images and brief language.\n\n25th Hour (2002) (R) 135 minutes\n\nFriday May 09, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday May 11, 7pm in 26-100\n\nAcclaimed director Spike Lee (Malcolm X, Summer of Sam) delivers the film Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle labels \"the first great 21st century movie about a 21st century subject.\"\n\nMontgomery Brogan (Edward Norton)'s life is nearly perfect.

Unfortunately, he's also got an imperfect past, which, when the police receive an anonymous tip, returns full-force to haunt him. Monty has just 24 hours as a free man to figure out who turned him in, and why.\n\nSet against the backdrop of post-September 11 New York, the story reflects the setting, providing no easy answers or clear morals, and plenty of complex characters with whom we can all identify. Rated R for strong language and some violence.\n\nRabbit-Proof Fence (2002) (PG) 94 minutes\n\nSaturday May 10, 7pm and 10pm in 26-100\n\nSunday May 11, 10pm in 26-100\n\nFrom the director of The Quiet American comes a unique tale of courage in the picturesque Australian outback. Roger Ebert writes, \"this journey...is beautiful, harrowing, and sometimes heartbreaking\" while Richard Roeper calls it \"one of the best movies of the year.\"\n\nIn 1931 Australia, all \"half-castes,\" a derogatory term for those with mixed European and aboriginal blood, were, by law, under the jurisdiction of a government official named Mr. Neville (Kenneth Branaugh). It was believed that the aborigines were an inferior race who were not capable of functioning within the European-Australian society. By taking the mixed children away from their aboriginal families, Mr. Neville sought to educate them, and gradually, through generations of marriages only to people of European descent, \"breed out\" the inferior blood and allow their descendents to become full members of society. However, when he ordered the removal of two sisters and their cousin from their homes, three incredible young women made a decision to walk home, 1500 miles with a government-hired aboriginal tracker on their trail, and only a rabbit-proof fence to guide their way. This is a true story. This is their story.

Rex Reed of The New York Observer calls The Pianist \"a great film of integrity and unforgettable power that leaves you breathless with gratitude.\"\n\nThis is the harrowing story of a real-life Jewish pianist who miraculously survived through World War II in Poland. Through his eyes, we see an incredible transformation of his country, which, if it were not absolutely true, we could not believe. First, there is vague anti-Semitism, which is quickly fueled by increasing restrictions on the Jewish people's lives. Then, the torture and slaughter begins. Some risk their lives to help, others stand idly by in an attempt to secure their own survival. Still others take advantage of the situation, or worse, unleash an inner cruelty most of us hope we do not possess.\n\nThis story is told without sentimentality or exaggeration; this is the tragedy of human evil which can come to pass.
