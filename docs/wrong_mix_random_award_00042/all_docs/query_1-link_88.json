        "text": "As a cinematographer, John R. Leonetti has earned a great deal of respect for his work on movies like The Mask, Mortal Kombat, and The Conjuring. As a director, however, often on sequels to projects he lensed, his projects have been less illustrious, from the mess that was Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (a franchise-killing $35 million domestic grosser) to the direct-to-video The Butterfly Effect 2 and Wolves at the Door. Given enough chances, however, he did finally hit box-office paydirt with Annabelle, the spinoff of The Conjuring that made over $84 million on a $6.5 million budget, and has already spawned a sequel that's coming out next month (when your star is a doll, she won't demand a pay raise). His latest, Wish Upon, is still a bargain by studio horror standards at $12 million, though it opens with a lot less hype than the creepy doll, who was also a pre-established \"star,\" so to speak; the biggest name in Wish Upon is Ryan Phillippe, best known currently for the TV version of Shooter, with cameos from Sherilyn Fenn and Stranger Things' Barb, Shannon Purser.\n\nWhile Annabelle was a mess, a weird rip-off homage to Rosemary's Baby with elements of The Room, Wish Upon is just inert. In a sense it's better than Annabelle just by never being laughable, but it never really scores because it never truly swings. Like the Wishmaster series, which started strong and then slowly, painfully self-destructed, it's a would-be tale of terror that advises you to be careful what you wish for, but it replaces a smart-aleck, devious Djinn with...a music box. Said container gives as dynamic a performance as you could possibly expect from a box, what with its magically opening lid and spinning gears, but in the end it is just a box. Fortunately, the human performers manage to pull off slightly less wooden appearances.\n\nFargo's Joey King stars as Clare, a traumatized teen who's constantly picked on at school and embarrassed by her trash-picker father (Phillippe, now old enough for drunk dad parts). Conveniently, she's at a high school where they teach Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese? Not specified) - a good long-term strategy for her to one day get the best revenge with a successful business career, but never mind that right now - so when dad brings back a magic Chinese box from the trash cans outside the spooky house with demon gargoyles and upside-down Batarang symbols, she can read some of it. The part that says \"seven wishes,\" anyway. The part about the necessary blood sacrifice is written in \"ancient\" Chinese, so that doesn't get translated for her until long after the audience has figured it out first.\n\nPart of the problem with the script by Barbara Marshall (Terra Nova) is that it's hard to build tension when the unintended consequences of the wishes are totally random. This isn't \"The Monkey's Paw,\" in which one's choices have an ironic component you didn't think of at first, but a variant of Final Destination, where a strange chain of consequences will suddenly kill somebody (it doesn't have to even be a human somebody) in your circle of acquaintances at whatever random time after your wish-making the music box suddenly decides to open and play a tune. Also, the characters are given the precise information they need to undo everything about halfway through the story...and they choose to ignore it. Like with Sauron's ring, we're shown that this is because there's an addictive component to it. But even addicts can make a hard push to quit once they've hit rock bottom.\n\nThe story gets close to really building some momentum when Clare wishes for a hot boy to fall for her, and he starts to become dangerously obsessive, but even that subplot gets nipped in the bud too soon; had she been forced to use another wish to actually save her own life, for example, the stakes and the tension could have been raised. And maybe, if other, nastier people were seeking the box, there could have been some reason to be afraid in between wishes. That the premise is so ripe with possibility makes it all the more unfortunate that what we see is so downright ordinary. At one point, Clare's friends ask why she doesn't just wish for world peace; while we might assume that the budget doesn't allow for this movie to show us the unintended results of that, a few bigger-picture wishes like that could have made things exciting.\n\nLeonetti's direction is pretty straightforward, though some of the deaths are staged a bit clumsily - the world's most poorly planned sink garbage disposal is, we are supposed to believe, capable of snapping a neck. And the cast are all fine: mean girl Josephine Langford, in particular, is a gloriously hissable villain whose comeuppance is genuinely cathartic. More of her, perhaps armed with wishes of her own, might have upped the ante in a fun way. Instead, we're stuck with a mostly inanimate object as the main antagonist...and at the risk of supernatural consequences for my saying this, I wish we had better."
