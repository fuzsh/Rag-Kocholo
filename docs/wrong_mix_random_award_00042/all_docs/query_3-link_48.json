Our students from Dubai participated in the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh’s Award expedition and learned new skills! They learned how to overcome obstacles, and build confidence and resilience. The expeditions were a perfect mix of challenge and learning. The residential program really boosted their leadership, confidence, and teamwork skills. A huge thank you to the fantastic Les Elfes team for their support and guidance. We highly recommend Les Elfes for an incredible DofE experience!”\n\nDubai\n\n“Dear Phillippe, We have now returned back to Singapore after another superb week with Les Elfes at La Tsoumaz. I just wanted to take this opportunity to inform you how exceptional the staff was. We have come to expect this, but it always impresses me just how good they are. Particular thanks go to Nuno who has always dealt with any question or problem in his usual unflappable way, but also to Devon, Zoran, and Ryan who made sure we were supported throughout the week. The instructors too were highly impressive and our students’ skills improved significantly throughout the week. Overall, I had a party of students who had a fantastic week. We look forward very much to joining Les Elfes next year. Kind regards,”\n\nSchool from Singapore\n\n“Hello Sandy, I would like to say thank you to you and all your staff who made our trip so enjoyable. The students have come back from the trip absolutely buzzing and keep asking about next year already. I thought every member of staff was fantastic, the ski instructors helped to challenge and push our students, whilst Iggy and the animation team were brilliant at keeping students entertained in the evenings. We were really impressed by you guys and how you managed to run everything so smoothly. We thought the staff was very professional at all times, being really caring and supportive to our students. It was also nice to see staff encouraging students to mix. Our students defiantly made some new friends and had lots of fun. We would like to say how grateful we are to have come to Les Elfes and had such a wonderful time and how patient you were with us being our first time. Thank you for always being about and answering all of our questions. Thank you,”\n\nSchool from Malaysia"
