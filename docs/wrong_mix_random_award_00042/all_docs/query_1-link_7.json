        "text": "Ryan Phillippe broke social media hearts and TV fans when they realized he would not be returning for the second season of ABC drama “Secrets and Lies.”\n\nPhillippe cleared the air on Twitter saying his work — hailed as some of his best in a career that spans three decades — was always intended to be a limited tale about a murder investigation, and that the show will focus on a new crime come fall.\n\nLet us be grateful for the Phillippe screen time we had, not the Phillippe screen time we lost.\n\nAnd while we’re at it, TheWrap has compiled a list of similar heartthrobs who like Phillippe, have also matured like a fine wine.\n\nAlso Read: Ryan Phillippe Is Not Returning for 'Secrets and Lies' Season 2 Contrary to Reports, Social Media\n\nA group of actors of the Phillippe ilk — former TV and film idols — could carry a dramatic storyline with a believable word-weariness while still serving up some sex appeal.\n\nSee our 11 actors who should carry Phillippe’s torch for Season 2 of “Secrets and Lies”:\n\nBrian Austin Green\n\nMr. Megan Fox is the perfect example of overwhelming TV stardom, as everyone’s favorite high scho0l nerd turned dream boyfriend as David Green on “Beverly Hills 90210.” While he’s enjoyed network guest appearances on comedies like “Happy Endings,” Green is ripe for a meaty drama, not unlike the resurgence of Joshua Jackson on Showtime’s “The Affair.”\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr.\n\nWho owned the early 2000s harder than Phillippe — his “I Know What You Did Last Summer” c0-star Freddie, of course. Prinze Jr. wife Sarah Michelle Gellar were royalty to the teen set before he pursued other passions like culinary school and serving as staff writer for WWE. Would he ever deign to return to the craft, we’re certain a network would happily plant him on the schedule.\n\nAndrew Keegan\n\nStar of seminal teen classics like “10 Things I Hate About You” and The WB’s “7th Heaven,” Keegan has busied himself lately by starting his own religion. We’d rather seem him playing a sultry pastor on TV.\n\nBalthazar Getty\n\nThe bad boy of “Brothers & Sisters” has always intrigued us, not just because of his good looks and pedigree. The ABC family drama never gave him enough material to showcase his natural gifts — a vulnerable-yet-stubborn sensibility that’s in many of cable’s leading man antiheroes.\n\nIan Ziering\n\nThe Aaron Spelling legacy actor has been languishing in hunk stunts like a guest stint at Chippendales Las Vegas, and absurd cultural fare like Syfy’s “Sharknado.” We think Ziering would impress and surprise with something higher brow.\n\nIvan Sergei\n\nAnother alumni of TheWB, the irresistible Ivan played opposite Amanda Peet in the short-lived but long-remembered “Jack & Jill.” He most recently had appeared on ABC Family’s “Twisted” so he’s already part of the Disney-Owned ABC family. Sort of.\n\nCasper Van Dien\n\nAgain, Casper is a prime example of an able-bodied guy who has classically been targeted for silly or sexy fare. “Super Troopers” and TV’s “Titans” were profile raisers years ago, but it’s time to take this stallion out of the stable.\n\nBarry Watson\n\nFair is fair: if Jessica Biel gets to live in a state of perpetual audition, her “7th Heaven” co-star Barry Watson deserves the same chance — and he’s quite happy on TV.\n\nMario Lopez\n\nLopez is gainfully employed as the host of “Extra” and an author of fitness books (obviously), but remember the sweet days he graced school halls on “Saved By The Bell”? He’s had enough modern experience (FX’s “Nip/Tuck”) to merit a more serious turn.\n\nDevon Sawa\n\nSawa burned hot and faded fast with scene-stealing roles in “Casper” and “Now And Then.” He also deserves special consideration as the only blonde on our highly scientific list.\n\nThe post Ryan Phillippe Effect: 11 Former Teen Heartthrobs to Carry ‘Secrets and Lies’ Season 2 Torch appeared first on TheWrap.\n\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n\nRyan Phillippe Is Not Returning for 'Secrets and Lies' Season 2 Contrary to Reports, Social Media"
