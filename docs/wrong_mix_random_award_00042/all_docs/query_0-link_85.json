        "text": "NEW FILMS FRIDAY\n\nTHE CAT'S MEOW — Based on the award-winning stage play, this fictional piece from director Peter Bogdonavich examines the relationship between tycoon William Randolph Hearst (Edward Herrmann) and actress Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst). Reviewed in this section. PG-13 (sex, brief violence, brief drug use). (Exclusive, Megaplex 12.)\n\nITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS — The latest no-frills \"Dogme\" film is a comedy about six singles who discover love and more when they decide to sign up for Italian lessons. In Danish and Italian, with English subtitles. Reviewed in this section. R (profanity, sex, vulgarity). (Exclusive, Tower.)\n\nJASON X — The 10th of the \"Friday the 13th\" movies finds the hockey-masked killer aboard a futuristic spacecraft after the crew of the ship digs up and then thaws the hibernating psychopath. Reviewed in this section. R (violence, gore, profanity, sex, vulgarity, brief nudity, brief drug use). (Broadway; Carmike 12; Century; Jordan Landing; Redwood, with \"All About the Benjamins\"; Ritz.)\n\nLIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT — Angelina Jolie stars in this fantasy/comedy as a superficial TV reporter who begins reassessing her life after receiving a premonition that she's going to die. Edward Burns co-stars. Reviewed in this section. PG-13 (profanity, vulgarity, brief gore, brief sex, brief violence). (Carmike 12, Century, 5-Star, Gateway, Holladay, Jordan Commons, Jordan Landing, Megaplex 12, Ritz.)\n\nRE-RELEASES\n\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST — **** — Disney's wondrous, Oscar-nominated 1991 animated musical has been remastered (both the picture and color) and \"blown up\" for the large-format screen for this 10th anniversary re-release. The new musical number, \"Human Again,\" only adds to the splendor of one of the studio's all-time classics. G (violence). (Exclusive, Jordan Commons.)\n\nE.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL — **** — Steven Spielberg's beloved 1981 science-fiction tale — about the friendship between a young boy (Henry Thomas) and the title character, an alien visitor being hunted by the authorities — has been spruced up and augmented for this 20th anniversary re-release. Despite some questionable edits, it's still a thing of wonder, with a message about acceptance of different cultures that couldn't be better timed. Running time: 120 minutes. PG (profanity, vulgarity). (Jordan Landing, Megaplex 12.)\n\nA HARD DAY'S NIGHT — **** — Re-issue of director Richard Lester's frenetic but hilarious \"day-in-the-life\" musical comedy starring the Beatles. The four Brits seem perfectly at ease in front of the camera, resulting in charming performances, and the remastered soundtrack features several of their biggest hits (including the title track). In black and white. G (slapstick violence). (Jordan Commons.)\n\nMIDNIGHT MOVIES\n\nPINK FLOYD: THE WALL —** 1/2 — Director Alan Parker's visually stunning 1982 film, essentially an extended music video for the best-selling psychedelic pop album, becomes somewhat wearisome after an hour. Still, there's no denying the power of some of the musical sequences (particularly during \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\"). R (violence, profanity). (Tower, Friday and Saturday.)\n\nSPECIAL SCREENINGS\n\nTHE CEMENT BALL OF EARTH, HEAVEN AND HELL —*** 1/2 — Local filmmaker Trent Harris's feature-length, video profile of a former Khmer Rouge soldier is surprisingly straightforward and features several stark images that will haunt you for days. Shown on video. Not rated, probable PG-13 (violence, vulgarity). (Friday: Salt Lake Art Center, 8 p.m.; Saturday: Utah Museum of Fine Arts, University of Utah, 7:30 p.m.)\n\nROOZI KHE ZAN SHODAM (THE DAY I BECAME A WOMAN) — The University of Utah's Film Front group presents a free screening of director Marzieh Meshkini's 2000 drama about the treatment of women in Iran. In Farsi, with English subtitles. Not rated, probable PG (violence). (OSH Auditorium, University of Utah, Sunday, 7 p.m.)\n\nFOOTLOOSE —** 1/2 — Remembered nowadays more for its soundtrack and for spawning a Broadway musical version, this 1984 song-and-dance drama seems ridiculously antiquated today. The Utah scenery (the film was shot entirely in the state) outshines most of the performances as well, although John Lithgow is good as the local fire-and-brimstone minister. PG (profanity, nudity, violence). (Jordan Commons.)\n\nSHACKLETON'S ANTARCTIC ADVENTURE —*** 1/2 — This exploration of Ernest Shackleton's treacherous expedition into the Antarctic wilds is akin to interplanetary travel, with its vistas of the unearthly land- and seascapes surrounding the South Pole. Narrated by Kevin Spacey. In black and white and color. Shown in the large-screen format. Not rated, probable G. (Jordan Commons.) (Aug. 26, 2001) — Diane Urbani\n\nSOLARMAX — *** — This short documentary, examining scientific efforts to understand the sun, including unusually heavy solar activity, provides both thrilling escapism and astonishing views of reality. Shown in the large-screen format. Not rated, probable G. (Jordan Commons.) (Sept. 21, 2001) — Diane Urbani\n\nPOP GOES THE COMIC — The Organ Loft presents a special program comprising three shorts by silent comic Max Linder, including 1921's \"Seven Years Bad Luck\" and \"Be My Wife,\" as well as \"The Three Must-Get-Theirs,\" a 1922 parody of \"The Three Musketeers.\" Featuring musical accompaniment. In black and white. Made before ratings, probable G (slapstick violence). (Organ Loft, Friday, 7:30 p.m.)\n\nCONTINUING FILMS\n\nALEXANDRE DUMAS' THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO — ** — Jim Caviezel is too bland as the title character of this swashbuckling revenge tale, a sailor who seeks vengeance on his former best friend (Guy Pearce), and there are too many anachronistic touches. Running time: 131 minutes. PG-13 (violence, gore, torture, brief sex, brief veiled nudity). (Sandy, Showcase, Sugar House, Valley Fair.) (Jan. 25, 2002)\n\nALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS — * 1/2 — Ice Cube and his \"Next Friday\" co-star Mike Epps try to out-\"Rush Hour\" those action-comedies. But this is astonishingly mean-spirited and unpleasant stuff. Running time: 98 minutes. R (profanity, violence, gore, torture, racial epithets, vulgarity, nude artwork, brief sex). (Redwood, with \"Jason X.\") (March 8, 2002)\n\nAMELIE — **** — Sure it's a bit off-beat (there are some unfortunate R-rated moments as well), but French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's comedy/fantasy is also clearly the best foreign film released this year. It's a delightful whimsy about a young woman (star-in-the-making Audrey Tatou) who meddles in the lives of others while neglecting her own personal affairs. In French, with English subtitles. Running time: 120 minutes. R (nudity, sex, profanity, brief violence). (Broadway.) (Nov. 9, 2001)\n\nA BEAUTIFUL MIND — ** — An intellectually dishonest and highly fictionalized biography of troubled, Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. Even the talented cast (which includes Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly) can't save this one. Winner of four Academy Awards. Running time: 129 minutes. PG-13 (violence, profanity, vulgarity, brief sex, racial epithets). (Century, Jordan Commons, Jordan Landing, Megaplex 12, Trolley North.) (Dec. 25, 2001)\n\nBIG FAT LIAR — ** — \"Malcolm in the Middle's\" Frankie Muniz deserves a better starring vehicle than this lame \"Home Alone\"-style comedy about a schoolboy taking his revenge on a sleazy Hollywood producer (Paul Giamatti). Running time: 88 minutes. PG (slapstick violence, mild vulgarity, mild profanity). (Sandy, Showcase, Sugar House, Valley Fair.) (Feb. 8. 2002)\n\nBLACK HAWK DOWN — *** — A cast of up-and-coming actors (including Josh Hartnett and Eric Bana) heads up director Ridley Scott's exciting but extremely gory military thriller (a Best Picture Oscar nominee), based on a real-life incident in which U.S. soldiers were stuck in the middle of a Somalian war zone. Running time: 143 minutes. R (violence, gore, profanity, vulgarity, racial epithets.) (Kaysville, Sandy, Sugar House.) (Jan. 18, 2002)\n\nBLADE II — *** — This sequel to the surprising 1998 horror hit, one in which the title character (Wesley Snipes) must team up with his undead foes to stop an even more terrifying threat, is more exciting but even gorier. Running time: 110 minutes. R (violence, gore, profanity, drug use, vulgarity, torture, nude photos). (Jordan Landing; Redwood, with \"The Scorpion King\"; Ritz.) (March 22, 2002)\n\nCHANGING LANES — *** — This thriller has some unbelievable moments, but it's surprisingly effective, thanks to the performances by Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson as men playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game after a hit-and-run incident. Running time: 99 minutes. R (profanity, violence). (Carmike 12; Century; Gateway; Holladay; Jordan Commons; Jordan Landing; Megaplex 12; Redwood with \"High Crimes\"; Ritz.) (April 12, 2002)\n\nCLOCKSTOPPERS — ** — Lackluster science-fiction adventure about a teen (Jesse Bradford) who discovers one of his father's devices can make time nearly come to a stop. Some nifty effects, but the story's a snore. Running time: 94 minutes. PG (violence, mild vulgarity). (Carmike 12; Century; Gateway; Jordan Commons; Jordan Landing; Redwood, with \"Ice Age\"; Ritz.) (March 29, 2002)\n\nCOLLATERAL DAMAGE — ** — It may have been made before Sept. 11, but this latest Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle — a ho-hum thriller about a firefighter seeking vengeance on terrorists — still seems exploitative. Running time: 115 minutes. R (violence, profanity, gore, torture, drugs, vulgarity, racial epithets). (Valley Fair.) (Feb. 8, 2002)\n\nCROSSROADS —* 1/2 — She's not the worst actress in the world, but pop singer Britney Spears's feature-film starring debut is a painfully clichd, exploitative drama that will appeal to only her most loyal fans. Running time: 94 minutes. PG-13 (sex, vulgarity, profanity). (Sandy, Sugar House.) (Feb. 15, 2002)\n\nDEATH TO SMOOCHY — *** — Danny DeVito's latest is definitely not for everyone. It's a dark, dark comedy about the nearly murderous rivalry between a children's show host (Robin Williams) and the man who replaced him (Edward Norton). Running time: 104 minutes. R (profanity, violence, vulgarity, brief torture, brief sex). (Broadway, Valley Fair.) (March 29, 2002)\n\nFRAILTY — ** 1/2 — Actor Bill Paxton's directorial debut, about a family of serial killers, is dripping with mood and suspense. But it would have been so much better if the movie's big twist worked. Running time: 100 minutes. R (profanity, violence, gore). (Jordan Landing.) (April 12, 2002) — Christy Lemire, Associated Press\n\nGOSFORD PARK — **** — Director Robert Altman's best film in many years is a scathing class comedy/mystery/drama about a murder that occurs during a party at a guest house in London. The first-rate cast includes Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ryan Phillippe and Maggie Smith, who's hilarious in a supporting turn. Running time: 137 minutes. R (violence, profanity, brief gore, brief sex, vulgarity). (Brewvies, must be 21 or older.) (Jan. 4, 2002)\n\nHARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE — *** — This big-budgeted adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's best-selling children's novels is perfectly cast — especially with newcomer Daniel Radcliffe starring as the young wizard-in-training. But some of the magic is missing, and it's too long for neophytes. Still, Potter-philes will be pleased. Running time: 153 minutes. PG (violence, mild profanity, mild vulgarity). (Avalon, Kaysville, Sandy, Showcase, Sugar House, Valley Fair.) (Nov. 16, 2001)\n\nHIGH CRIMES — ** — Yet another by-the-numbers Ashley Judd thriller, which only comes to life when co-star Morgan Freeman is on-screen. Running time: 115 minutes. PG-13 (violence, profanity, vulgarity, brief gore, brief sex, brief partial nudity, brief drugs, racial epithets). (Carmike 12; Century; Gateway; Holladay; Jordan Commons; Jordan Landing; Redwood, with \"Changing Lanes\"; Ritz; Trolley Corners.) (April 5, 2002)\n\nICE AGE — *** — The first digitally created cartoon from Fox Animation is a familiar, but still fun comedy about prehistoric animals trying to reunite a human child with its parents. The voice cast (which includes Ray Romano and John Leguizamo) has a ball, and so will most audiences. Running time: 81 minutes. PG (animated violence, vulgarity). (Carmike 12; Century; 5-Star; Gateway; Holladay; Jordan Commons; Jordan Landing; Megaplex 12; Redwood, with \"Clockstoppers\"; Ritz.) (March 15, 2002)\n\nIN THE BEDROOM — *** — Great lead performances by Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson highlight this tense little drama about a couple grieving over the death of their college-age son. The turn towards revenge thriller at the end is a little off-putting, but the acting is terrific. Running time: 130 minutes. R (profanity, brief violence, brief gore, vulgarity). (Brewvies, must be 21 or older; Valley Fair.) (Jan. 4, 2002)\n\nJIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS —** 1/2 — An animated feature starring the kid with big hair who's been playing havoc with Nickelodeon's programming. Frankly, the concept works better on television. Running time: 84 minutes. G (slapstick violence, mild vulgarity). (Valley Fair.) (Dec. 21, 2001) — Bob Strauss, Los Angeles Daily News\n\nKISSING JESSICA STEIN — ** 1/2 — Co-screenwriter Jennifer Westfeldt is a little cold as the title character, a New Yorker who gets cold feet when she begins dating another woman (a terrific Heather Juergensen, who also co-scripted). Running time: 96 minutes. R (vulgarity, profanity, sex, brief drugs). (Exclusive, Tower.) (April 5, 2002)\n\nTHE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING — **** — New Zealand director Peter Jackson's big-budgeted adaptation of the first of the much-read fantasy trilogy is also the year's best, an awe-inspiring, thrilling adventure with plenty of \"wow!\" moments. Also, the all-star cast (which includes Elijah Wood, Sir Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler and Christopher Lee) is top to bottom excellent. Winner of four Academy Awards. Running time: 178 minutes. PG-13 (violence, gore). (Century, Gateway, Jordan Commons, Jordan Landing, Ritz, Trolley Corners, Villa.) (Dec. 19, 2001)\n\nMONSTER'S BALL —** 1/2 — The performances by Billy Bob Thornton and, especially, Oscar winner Halle Berry barely save this ludicrous drama about a penitentiary guard who becomes involved with the widow of an executed prisoner. Running time: 108 minutes. R (profanity, sex, nudity, violence, gore, vulgarity, racial epithets). (Broadway.) (Feb. 8, 2002)\n\nMURDER BY NUMBERS — ** — This dull thriller attempts features two story lines, the less interesting one starring Sandra Bullock as a homicide detective investigating a murder committed by manipulative teens. Running time: 118 minutes. R (violence, profanity, sex, gore, vulgarity, drugs, nude artwork). (Carmike 12; Century; 5-Star; Gateway; Holladay; Jordan Commons; Jordan Landing; Megaplex 12; Redwood, with \"Resident Evil\"; Ritz.) (April 19, 2002)\n\nNATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER — ** — The latest from National Lampoon is not nearly as atrocious as the ads would suggest, though it doesn't come close to the hilarity of their best movies. Running time: 95 minutes. R (vulgarity, profanity, drug use, slapstick violence). (Brewvies, must be 21 or older; Ritz.) (April 5, 2002) — Christy Lemire, Associated Press\n\nOCEAN'S ELEVEN — *** — Director Steven Soderberg's all-star remake of the 1960 Rat Pack heist picture is a little shaky, but it is fun to see George Clooney interacting with Brad Pitt and the others. Running time: 116 minutes. PG-13 (profanity, violence, vulgarity, racial epithets, nude artwork). (Kaysville, Sandy, Showcase, Sugar House.) (Dec. 7, 2001)\n\nTHE OTHER SIDE OF HEAVEN — ** 1/2 — Handsome-looking but too superficial drama, based on the harrowing real-life experiences of an LDS general authority when he was a teenager serving a mission to the Kingdom of Tonga. A good cast, including Anne Hathaway (\"The Princess Diaries\"), helps, but it's a little too squeaky-clean for its own good. Running time: 113 minutes. PG (violence, vulgarity, brief gore). (Gateway, Jordan Landing, Trolley Corners.) (Dec. 14, 2001)\n\nTHE OTHERS — *** 1/2 — Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar's English-language filmmaking debut is a chilling, suspenseful horror movie about a woman (a believable Nicole Kidman) who believes her mansion may be haunted. Subtle, with terrific performances by the entire cast. Running time: 101 minutes. PG-13 (brief violence, brief drug use). (Kaysville, Sandy, Sugar House.) (Aug. 10, 2001)\n\nPANIC ROOM — *** — This thriller, about a woman (Jodie Foster) hiding from a group of robbers who have invaded her home, has some extremely tense moments . . . just enough to make up for the flat ending. Running time: 108 minutes. R (violence, profanity, gore, vulgarity, drugs, brief torture). (Carmike 12; Century; Jordan Commons; Jordan Landing; Megaplex 12; Redwood, with \"The Sweetest Thing\"; Ritz.) (March 29, 2002)\n\nQUEEN OF THE DAMNED — ** — It's got some stylish moments, but this ludicrous horror movie, based on the Anne Rice best-seller, is a sad farewell for late R&B singer Aaliyah, who plays the title character. Running time: 101 minutes. R (violence, gore, nude artwork, profanity, vulgarity, brief drugs). (Sugar House.) (Feb. 22, 2002)\n\nRESIDENT EVIL — * — Yawn! Another plot-thin movie adapted from a hit videogame — this one a gory horror/thriller about soldiers who must stop an outbreak of a virus that turns its victims into undead flesh-eaters. Running time: 100 minutes. R (violence, gore, profanity, sex, nudity, vulgarity). (Redwood, with \"Murder by Numbers.\") (March 15, 2002)\n\nRETURN TO NEVER LAND — ** — Devoid of the charm and originality of its predecessor, Disney's classic 1953 adaptation of \"Peter Pan,\" this animated sequel about the adventures of Wendy's daughter probably should have gone straight to video. Running time: 79 minutes. G (animated violence, mild vulgarity). (Sandy, Showcase, Sugar House, Valley Fair.) (Feb. 15, 2002)\n\nTHE ROOKIE — *** 1/2 — A warm and wonderfully low-key family drama, based on the true story of a once-promising baseball prospect (Dennis Quaid) who decides to give the big leagues one more try as he hits middle age. Refreshingly old-fashioned, with some well-placed humor and sentiment. Running time: 129 minutes. G (mild profanity, mild vulgarity). (Carmike 12, Century, Holladay, Jordan Commons, Jordan Landing, Megaplex 12, Ritz, Trolley North.)\n\nTHE ROYAL TENENBAUMS — **** — Sure it's quirky, but director Wes Anderson's third film is also his richest and funniest. It's a comedy a family patriarch (a never-better Gene Hackman) striving to reconnect with his estranged children (including Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller). Running time: 108 minutes. R (profanity, violence, drugs, brief sex, vulgarity, brief nudity, brief gore, racial epithets). (Broadway.) (Jan. 4, 2002)\n\nTHE SCORPION KING — ** — WWF wrestler The Rock is laughably bad as he reprises his role as an ancient Egyptian assassin. The action's OK, but the dialogue and acting make it a chore to sit through. Running time: 94 minutes. PG-13 (violence, vulgarity, brief gore). (Carmike 12; Century; 5-Star; Holladay; Jordan Commons; Jordan Landing; Megaplex 12; Redwood, with \"Blade II\"; Ritz; Trolley North.) (April 19, 2002)\n\nTHE SINGLES WARD — ** — Essentially a filmed road show, this locally produced romantic comedy relies too heavily on cameos by such local celebrities as Steve Young, Richard Dutcher and Danny Ainge and \"inside\" humor, though leads Will Swenson and Connie Young do have a certain charm. Running time: 102 minutes. PG (slapstick violence). (Carmike 12, 5-Star, Jordan Commons, Jordan Landing, Megaplex 12.) (Feb. 1, 2002)\n\nSNOW DOGS — ** — This comedy, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. as a dentist who inherits a team of sled dogs, is lightweight and predictable. And the animatronic dogs are so expressive they're spooky. Running time: 99 minutes. PG (mild vulgarity, slapstick violence). (Kaysville, Sugar House, Valley Fair.) (Jan. 18, 2002) — Christy Lemire, Associate Press\n\nTHE SON'S ROOM — *** 1/2 — This well-acted, achingly sad Italian drama does bear some superficial resemblances to the acclaimed \"In the Bedroom,\" though this one features a much more satisfying and coherent ending. In Italian, with English subtitles. Running time: 99 minutes. R (profanity, violence, vulgarity, brief sex, brief nudity). (Exclusive, Broadway.) (April 19, 2002)\n\nTHE SWEETEST THING — * 1/2 — Cameron Diaz takes a definite career step backward with this surprisingly crude and painfully unfunny comedy about a woman who meets and loses Mr. Perfect (Thomas Jane). Running time: 84 minutes. R (vulgarity, sex, profanity, slapstick violence, brief nudity). (Carmike 12; Century; Jordan Commons; Jordan Landing; Megaplex 12; Redwood, with \"Panic Room\"; Ritz.) (April 12, 2002)\n\nTHE TIME MACHINE — ** — An effects-heavy but character-deficient adaptation of H.G. Wells' short novel about a scientist (Guy Pearce) who journeys into the future with the title invention. Pretty uninvolving and even a bit dull. Running time: 96 minutes. PG-13 (violence, gore). (Sandy, Showcase, Sugar House, Valley Fair.) (March 8, 2002)\n\nA WALK TO REMEMBER — ** — It's sort of refreshing to watch this cornball romance — at least until the third act, which has the kids facing death, albeit with all the consternation of teens spending an entire Saturday with their parents. Running time: 100 minutes. PG (sex, brief violence). (Kaysville, Sandy.) (Jan. 25, 2002) — Glenn Whipp, Los Angeles Daily News\n\nY TU MAMA TAMBIEN — ** 1/2 — Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's coming-of-age road picture is unflinchingly graphic and sexual. But his insights into the culture are no more profound or surprising than the central narrative. In Spanish, with English subtitles. Running time: 105 minutes. Not rated, probable NC-17 (sex, nudity, profanity, vulgarity, violence, drug use). (Exclusive, Century.) (April 19, 2002) — Hap Erstein, Cox News Service\n\nPast movie reviews and capsules by Jeff Vice and Chris Hicks are available online; search for MOVIES at www. deseretnews.com"
