        "text": "It’s a rare cinematic moment, but one of the most exciting big screen experiences is when an actor absolutely shatters the perception you have of them and expectations you have for them. This is exactly what Ryan Phillippe does about halfway through “The Lincoln Lawyer,” his new courtroom thriller that casts the always desirable actor as the kind of guy you would never want to come across in a dark alley.\n\nBut in retrospect, this is just the latest in a string of impression altering performances Ryan has delivered over the last eight years that reposition him as an incredibly capable dramatic actor, not just the one you want to start disrobing. Although we’ll never complain.\n\nI recently had the chance to chat with Ryan about his dark performance in the twisty thriller when I also learned that we share an affinity for the same character off his resume and that he doesn’t mind having one of the most doffed wardrobes in Hollywood.\n\nPopWrap: Louis is a really unexpected character from you — was that part of the attraction?\n\nRyan Phillippe: The fact that I’ve never played a character like this before really was appealing. Louis is definitely the most overtly dark and evil character I’ve ever done. And I don’t think that’s a spoiler for anyone whose seen the commercials – but the movie still has so many other surprises in store for fans. It was so well-written, and as an actor in this day and age, for whatever reason, the stuff that comes across my desk seems to be so thin and retreaded. I feel like this movie is a palate cleanser amidst the 3D, sequelized stuff. This is a throwback in a lot of ways.\n\nPW: Was this a role you had to fight for?\n\nRyan: It was actually. Because of the complicated nature of the character it was important to everyone they see what an actor could do with the part — I mean, it’s pretty crucial to the function of the movie. In this case, I felt like I had a good grasp of who Louis was, of what would make this character work. But I had to fight something like like 200 other guys for it.\n\nPW: When you find out the competition is 200 other guys, does that make you want the role even more?\n\nRyan: I don’t know if it makes me want it more. I’ve gotten very good over the years at letting go. This business is wrought with constant disappointment, from a movie not performing the way you’d hoped to losing a role you’d like – after so many years in this business, I’ve made peace with however things turn out. Being an actor is a very singular existence when you chase a role because you can’t judge yourself against what anyone else brings to the table.\n\nPW: You have no problem of letting go of the roles you’ve lost, but what about the ones you’ve gotten — can you easily move past a character when filming wraps?\n\nRyan: Absolutely. And much more so now then when I was younger. I used to really take the work home with me in a way that wasn’t healthy – especially heated or emotional material like “Little Boy Blue” [a 1997 indie] . That one really affected me. But having been in the business for almost 20 years and having kids makes you realize that as passionate as you are, it’s a job. Going home and cooking dinner for my kids gives me great perspective. Having things in your life outside the business definitely helps.\n\nPW: Given your popularity in the late 90’s, I feel like I’ve grown up with you in a lot of ways, so the fact you keep saying “when I was younger” is really hurting my feelings Ryan.\n\nRyan: I know, it hurts my feelings too [laughs]! I’ve been in this business for over half my life – I’m 37 now, but I’ve had almost two decades of experience, it’s quite rare.\n\nPW: A lot of the movies from that time are constantly on TV — have you gotten enough distance to where you can watch them now?\n\nRyan: Yea, definitely. The more recent ones I have difficulty with – whether it’s the physical way I look or the way I performed a scene. But the ones from the 90’s are like a photo album of my life. I haven’t done too many movies that my kids can see [laughs] but I did show them “White Squall” recently because that’s a sweet movie and I look like such a baby in that one. They loved seeing me at that age.\n\nPW: Is there one role that you’d love the chance to revisit in a pseudo-sequel?\n\nRyan: Probably Sebastian. There’s a big place in my heart for “Cruel Intentions.” I just had so much fun with that guy. There was so much license with him as a character because he was so unpredictable. I’d be curious to see where he ended up later in life.\n\nPW: What about a character that you’d love to play for the first time?\n\nRyan: I’ve always had dreams of playing Charles Lindbergh, but a lot of the choices and what I respond to comes down to script. You could have a great character in a crappy movie and then it’s meaningless, so it’s more about the totality of the project than it is the potential selfish gain of playing a specific character.\n\nPW: Comparing the two phases of your career, what’s better about the place you’re in today?\n\nRyan: I like the potential that comes with maturity. The focus becomes more about your capabilities than what you look like. There’s still that onus that’s placed on taking care of yourself and aging well if you’re in the public eye. But I made peace with that a long time ago since women are so objectified and so much of this business is predicated on sexuality or people’s fantasies. I think it should go both ways.\n\nPW: In that case, thank you for “54.”\n\nRyan: [laughs] Exactly. And you’re welcome.\n\n“The Lincoln Lawyer” hits theaters tomorrow\n\nPhoto: WireImage; Lionsgate"
