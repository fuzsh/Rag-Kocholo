        "text": "The King James Version is considered one of the most accurate English translations in existence. A skilled committee of 54 translators worked for 7 years to carefully complete the King James translation project.\n\n409 years ago!! Many things have changed in four centuries, including the English language. The language of the KJV was standard fare for a society that thought/spoke/wrote very differently than how we speak/think/write today. I have never seen a single post on any forum or heard anyone speak in the antiquated English of the early 17th Century. The translators wrote in their lengthy preface that previous translations were the Word of God and that they expected their version to be changed over time.\n\nWhen you say, \"The King James Version is considered one of the most accurate English translations in existence\", what are your criteria? Also, what do you mean by accurate? A direct word-for-word translation from ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek is impossible -- words have shades of meaning, verb tenses are different, and idioms are very different. The King James was created by order of -- believe it or not -- King James. He wanted Christianity to be exactly what he said it should be to legitimize his authority. Many, including earlier translators and the Pilgrims, fled religious persecution and took their earlier Bibles with them.\n\n1) The King James has been revised several times. Why would revisions be necessary if the 1611 translation was error-free?\n\n2) Read my \"signature\" below this post for further information about the KJV.\n\n409 years ago!!

Is it your position that fallible people can't be expert theologians? Both these men were highly respected scholars regardless of their alleged personal behavior.\n\nRemember that Peter (whom Catholics claim as the first Pope) was called \"Satan\" by Jesus and Peter denied Him three times.\n\nMy feeling is that you have a predetermined slander of these Catholic men; my question is why??\n\nP.S. I'm not your pal and probably, judging by your slander, wouldn't be if I met you.\n\nNo slander whatsoever, Kurt Aland divorced his wife Ingeborg and three children, to run off with the college girl (Barbara Nee Ehlers) and marry her being 22 years younger (Adultery) simple.\n\nYes Kurt Aland was in charge of the Nestle/Aland Greek text (Novum Testamentum Graece) 1993 also known as the (UBS5) 2014 that supports all new Bible versions.\n\nYes Kurt Aland's adulterous wife Barbara and the homosexual union supporter, Roman Catholic cardinal, and Jesuit priest (Carlo Maria Martini) was on this committee of translators also.\n\nThe Truth, No slander, just \"FACT\"!\n\n1) What is your source of this slander?\n\n2) Why do you find it necessary to slander these people?\n\nIf you want to find somebody to slander, start with Peter, whom Jesus called Satan and who denied Jesus three times. How about those Popes who started the Inquistion? or sold indulgences for money? How about those priests that had/have sexual relations with children? Your slander of scholars who weren't perfect men means nothing. It just demonstrates your bigotry.\n\nJesus, being God, was perfect. No other human being was, is, or will be perfect. As long as we are living \"in the flesh\" there will never be a perfect person.\n\nI like and only recommend literal Bibles based on Textus Receptus or Majoritarian Text.\n\nLSV (Literal Standard Version) is a Bible based on YLT (Young's Literal Translation), LSV was published in 2020, as an update to YLT that is from 1898, LSV is extremely literal, the order of the words in the verses are based on the order of the words in Hebrew and Greek, but it is an excellent Bible for you to study. (LSV is my favorite)\n\nMEV (Modern English Version) is practically an updated KJV, MEV was published in 2015, it is a little more literal than KJV, but in certain points it tries to \"fix\" the Bible as using terms according to modern logic and not the point of view of the ancient world (use of the term \"epileptics\" instead of \"lunatick\", \"lunatick\" is more similar to the original Greek \"seleniazomai\", etc.), MEV is an excellent alternative to KJV, in fact I believe that KJV should be replaced by MEV, because MEV is better, more literal, and in today English.\n\nI do not recommend paraphrase or Critical Text based bibles.\n\nI also recommend that you have a paper bible, because nowadays, we don't know what can happen, Christians can be tracked by governaments, and, electronic devices can fail, break, need battery charge, etc.\n\nYou will need to have a paper Bible, its more secure.\n\nI agree with you that paper Bibles are better than electronic ones -- for reference. Bibles in electronic format are easier to transport and generally easier to read. I'm not worried in the least about being tracked by the government because I have Bibles in digital form.\n\nRegarding translations, I prefer functional translations as I am far more interested in the meaning of the texts as expressed in modern English -- my native language -- than in formal translations while, although \"literal\" are, of course, not an exact translation of the word meanings, verb tenses, idioms, etc.\n\nSince very few people are expert career translators I find there is room for considerable error when non-professionals attempt to convert ancient languages into accurate => and clear <= renditions of the texts. Here is an example, all done by professionals: luke 14:10...\n\n\"But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.\" KJV\n\n\" But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee.\" ASV\n\n\"But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest seat, so that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, go up higher.’ Then you will have respect in the presence of those who sit at dinner with you.\" MEV\n\n\"But when you are invited, go and take the least important place, so that when your host approaches he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up here to a better place. Then you will be honored in the presence of all who share the meal with you.\" NET (my favorite translation)\n\nClearly, the farther one goes down this short list, the clearer the language and therefore the meaning. I find that untrained people derive all kinds of erroneous doctrines by misinterpreting the more obscure translations, meaning those that are different than the language one normally uses daily to think, read, and write."
