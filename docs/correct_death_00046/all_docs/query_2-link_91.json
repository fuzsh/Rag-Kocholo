        "text": "Yes, having the ability to export the library contents in bibliography format would be a huge help. May I also suggest that rather than program an export to .csv you consider something more established for this sort of data (.csv is not detailed enough). Every reference manager I've examined and used (Zotero, Sente, Bookends, and Endnote) can import BibTex structure with no problems. N.B.: Bookends even permits one to change the import tags which is handy for adding notes. This opens the question: what should happen to user notes in Accordance in connection to each respective tool? Easy. Accordance should give the option to the user so that s/he can export notes along with the reference. I would much rather you spend time on something like this rather than having the ability to change the folder icon! Cute—but let's make some forward progress on functionality, yes?\n\nEdited January 8, 2016 by Michael P Finkelstein\n\nHi Mark,\n\nYes, we support export to .RIS. From the Library, select the resources you want to export (shift/cmd-click for multiple), then click the gear icon in the bottom of the Library, and select \"export selected data…\". A dialogue will open allowing you to choose a name and location of where to save the .RIS file. This is only supported in Tools, not Texts by design.\n\nLet us know if you need any further assistance.\n\nThanks. I'm wondering, though, why bibliographic info for Texts cannot be exported. Students will need to cite which version (date) they are citing, and it would help if it could be imported into Zotero and pulled from there.\n\nI do see that if I highlight biblical text, I do have the option to copy as a \"Citation\" which is supposed to copy text plus create a footnote when I paste into Word. (I'm still evaluating with Accordance Lite, and this option doesn't seem to work.) If the bibliographic info were in Zotero, though, I'd be able to generate my paper's bibliography much more easily.\n\nSo, I'm w/ Fabian in thinking Export all Bibliographic Data would be helpful. Zotero makes it very easy to insert footnotes and generate bibliographies if all that info were there.\n\nThanks again.\n\nThanks.

A short response this evening, which I would be glad to discuss more via Skype, etc.\n\nThere are 2 features at work here: 1. Exporting bibliographic data for use in a third-party Citation Management apps. 2. Support for inserting citations automatically in Word processors utilizing our implementation of Turabian and SBL.\n\nYes, I think we could look into the option to export all data. But that's an app development item that I cannot comment on with direct insight. That said, this feature is designed so that users have the ability to control the method in which our resources are cited and managed. This seems what you are primarily interested in, so I won't comment further on 2nd feature in detail.\n\nAs I'm sure you are well aware, citing resources is somewhat murky water. Primary texts are not cited in the same fashion as secondary sources. Typically when you cite a text you simply use the text abbreviation and location reference (which we also support in some fashion within our Copy As Citation feature that is customizable in General Prefs). However, if you are citing statistical research generated from Accordance, then yes you would want to indicate that. But, none of the primary research style guides have a specified format for doing this. We leave it to users to decide how best to cite this (and if you have perused various publications that rely on our app you will see that they typically, although sometimes not at all, indicate this information in a preface or a single footnote that is then assumed for all other statistical data). Until the style guides specify a format to use, our implementation of such information within an SBL or Turabian format would be conjectural at best. If we include it within the RIS export, I do not believe this would import into any standard fields either (though I have not researched that fully).\n\nWe're certainly open to feedback here. And I am happy to discuss this further with you as well.\n\n@Rick Bennett: Thanks once more!\n\nYou are correct that I usually cite my usual English version and Greek/Hebrew text I'm using up front either in introductory material or in one of the first footnotes.\n\nI realize that I can get the bibliographic info of the texts by clickin on the title in the library and then clicking the info icon and then clicking the copy button. I thus get:\n\n>>>>>>>\n\nGreek NT (tagged)\n\nNovum Testamentum Graece (New Testament in Greek) (GNT-T)\n\nNestle-Aland, 27th Edition, prepared by Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung Münster/Westfalen, Barbara and Kurt Aland (Editors).

BibleWorks. v.8.\n\nThe NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (NET). n.p.: Biblical Studies Press, LLC, 1996. BibleWorks, v.8.\n\n>>>>>\n\nThat's the kind of entry I think would be helpful for everyone, and it would not only indicate the book information but also that I'm using Accordance to access it.\n\nAgain, I appreciate your position on this and am grateful for your help.\n\nMark\n\nI realize I'm reviving an old thread, but now that I'm using Accordance almost exclusively for my work, I need to address this again.\n\nI did export all the resources that I could to RIS files and import them and organize them in Zotero. Now I can use Zotero to reference them from Word.\n\nBUT\n\nIt is still not possible to export any biblical texts copyright information to a RIS file. I'm not eager to individually look up copyright info for all my Greek, Hebrew, and English texts and translations and manually and individually enter them into Zotero.\n\nCan Accordance help us out? Thanks.\n\n>>>\n\nAccordance is my main program, so I'm not trying to start a who's-better-match, but what I would really like is what I can do in Logos. If I copy a biblical text, I can choose to include a footnote automatically that looks like this:\n\n[1] Kurt Aland et al., Novum Testamentum Graece, 28th Edition. (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2012), Mk 6:34.\n\nJust refreshing this hoping to get a response...\n\nEdited March 31, 2020 by mgvh"
