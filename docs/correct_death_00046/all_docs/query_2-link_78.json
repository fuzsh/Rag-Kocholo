        "text": "Under the direction of Professor Kurt Aland, the Institute of NT Textual Research developed a system for classifying Greek manuscripts without having to do a full collation.On the basis of 98 selected test passages, all extant manuscripts for the Catholic Epistles were classified. In order to determine the accuracy of the test passages for classification purposes, 112 fully collated manuscripts of 1 John from the files of Andrews University were used to compare classifications based on test passages and full collations. Classifications based on full collations of 1 John confirmed 83 per cent. of the Institute's classifications for the Catholic Epistles.\n\n2 Volume 1, which came out in 1963, has proven to be an invaluable source for textual critics for over three decades: Kurzegefasste Liste, updated in 1994. Volume 25 was published in 1995: Marcion und sein Apostolos, by Ulrich Schmid. The volumes we are specifically interested in are Text und Textwert der Griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments. 1: Die Katholischen Briefe (3 vols.; ANTF 9–11Google Scholar; Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 1987). (Not all of the 25 volumes are on the Greek text, but all of the studies are geared toward it.)\n\n10 Echoes of Westcott and Hort (their Syrian text). As early as 1965 Aland expressed this viewpoint in a paper he read for the 100th Annual Meeting of the SBL, ‘The Significance of the Papyri for New Testament Research’. This paper was published in The Bible in Modern Scholarship (ed. J. Philip Hyatt; New York: Abingdon, 1965) 325–40.Google Scholar More recently, the Aland view was expressed in several places: Text und Textwert 2.vii, viii (the Byzantine text stands outside the goal of this work), and xiii, and Text, 106, 142 and 321. This view was clarified somewhat in Barbara Aland's statement in Text (331) when she indicated that the Byzantine text ‘should not be totally eliminated from editorial considerations, but only to the extent that its manuscripts are merely reproductions of an identical text.’\n\n17 Ibid. Originally the number of test passages for the Catholic Epistles was 103 (see ‘Significance’, 343). As early as 1972, most of the readings probably were fairly well established. While I was collating manuscripts at the Institute in 1972, Klaus Junack, knowing that I was working on the Johannine Epistles, told me that they had thirty-five test passages for those three epistles. That is precisely the number of readings for 1–3 John that were published fifteen years later in Text und Textwert (1.125–199). In response to my request to know what those thirty-five readings were, Junack stated that he did not feel comfortable sharing the information with me at that time.\n\n19 Text, 318 and 321. These test passages (short units) have been ‘carefully selected and are spread over the complete range of a book (or corpus) of scripture like a net’ (Text, 318).Google Scholar ‘Can we actually evaluate the textual quality of manuscripts on the basis of these test passages? Are they actually significant and is their number sufficient? In brief, the answer is: yes. This answer is based on our practical experience with them in the Institute at Münster. These test passages have consistently produced remarkably accurate evaluations when used in a variety of different projects, and they amply suffice for the three main tasks outlined above’ (321–2).\n\n23 ‘Test Passages or Profiles: A Comparison of Two Text-Critical Methods’, JBL 115 (1996) 253–71.Google Scholar It should be pointed out, however, that the Teststellen provide more information about a manuscript than deciding whether it is Byzantine or non-Byzantine. My study was done in view of one of the Institute's major goals: eliminating the Byzantine manuscripts with the use of the Teststellen. The study showed that it is possible by using the profile method to classify a previously unclassified manuscript as Byzantine or non-Byzantine in 1 John with just three readings– a reduction of 765 per cent. over the twenty-three Teststellen found in 1 John. In the course of the research, the first sign that there might be some disagreement in the classifications based on Teststellen and those based on full collations showed up in one of the manuscripts being used for my comparison. According to my study, MS 104 in 1 John, based on a full collation, is a solid representative of the Byzantine text, agreeing over 90 per cent. of the time with the Byzantine text. According to the classification in Text, MS 104 is listed as a Category III manuscript for the Catholic Epistles. We look at MS 104 below.\n\n34 We did make one complete cross-examination to see if any clues were evident to account for the differences. A comparison of the differing counts between Text and Text und Textwer for MS 01 is as follows: for each of the four categories of readings we give two numbers. The first number is the count given in Text, and the second number following the slash mark is the count found in Text und Textwert: number ‘1’ readings: 23/18; numbers ‘1/2’ readings: 6/5; number ‘2’ readings: 63/61; and special readings: 16/14, for totals of 108/98.\n\n37 The table of Handschriftenprofile is found in Text und Textwert 9.232–392. The percentages used to make the ‘probable’ classification were arrived at by calculating the percentages of agreement from the numbers given in Text, 107–42.Google Scholar These newly calculated percentages were then listed for each manuscript within a given category. In this way we were able to determine the lowest and highest levels of agreement a manuscript had within the range for those manuscripts already classified by the Alands. The range of percentages of agreement with the Majority text for the manuscripts within each category were: Category I ranged from 1 per cent. agreement to 29 per cent.; Category II ranged from 28 per cent, to 45 per cent, (overlapping percentages unaccounted for); Category III ranged from 46 to 80 per cent.; and the range for Category V was from 84 to 100. After we calculated the percentages for each of the twenty–seven (using the Handschriftenprofile), we simply compared the percentages with the ranges for the various categories, and plotted the unclassified manuscript accordingly."
