Now I see that it appears to be called \"NA28 Greek NT\" and underneath that is the short name GNT28-T, at least in the library. It just seems a bit confusing with the NA28-T itself. But then that module probably has a new name also.\n\nIn any case I'm just wondering if this known/expected or if I might have done something.\n\nthx\n\nD\n\nHi Dan,\n\nYour post made me look because I had gotten surprised by a name change when 11 came out.\n\nI just looked and now I am confused. Probably a smarter person will understand this exactly but I don't.\n\nI seem to have two GNT 28s, version 1.3 and 1.5 and 1.3 seems to be tagged \"sigla\".\n\nNot sure why I have two versions, maybe they just let me keep the prior one?\n\nHere is my info from the lib.\n\nNA28 Greek NT\n\nNovum Testamentum Graece (New Testament in Greek) (GNT28-T)\n\nNestle-Aland, 28th Revised Edition, Edited by Institut für Neutestamentliche Textforschung Münster/Westfalen, Edited by Barbara and Kurt Aland, Johannes Karavidopoulos, Carlo M.

And you have the Nestled-Aland edition with it's full apparatus used for text critical work. In any case it seems to confirm the name change but I'm a little puzzled when it happened. I must have missed a second name change or somehow I blanked on the exact nature of the first, when 11 came out.\n\nThx\n\nD\n\nDaniel,\n\nYes, we've changed the Library name with the most recent updates to GNT28-T and NA28-T. Because Accordance 11 uses the Library name rather than the module name in menus, pane labels, etc., we're trying to come up with a more consistent and concise way to distinguish similarly named modules. The Library name for GNT28-T is now \"NA28 Greek NT\", while NA28-T is \"NA28 Greek NT (Sigla)\".\n\nAs other modules (and Accordance itself) get updated, it should become easier to distinguish similar modules. I'm afraid we're still in the transition right now."
