        "text": "In my last article, Where are Manuscripts Found?, I briefly mentioned scholars use published lists to keep track of the New Testament manuscripts which have been cataloged. The list used by most New Testament manuscript scholars is Kurzgefasste Liste der griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments (Short List of Greek Manuscripts of the New Testament), produced by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research, University of Munster, Germany. Fortunately for those people who don’t speak German, it’s also known as the K-Liste or just Liste. Since this is a list of Greek New Testament manuscripts, I’m a bit surprised the whole book isn’t Greek.\n\nFor each manuscript in the K-Liste, a basic profile is offered including information such as :\n\na Gregory-Aland number\n\nthe New Testament contents\n\nthe manuscript’s date\n\nthe material the manuscript is written on\n\nthe number of pages\n\nthe number of columns per page\n\nthe number of lines of text per page\n\nthe physical dimensions of the manuscript\n\nits current location along with an identification number at its current location\n\nThe first known attempt to create a comprehensive list of Greek New Testament manuscripts occurred in 1751-1752 by Protestant theologian J.J. Wettstein, and other attempts at lists followed. The K-Liste is considered the direct descendent of the book Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments, published by Caspar René Gregory in 1908; the modern K-Liste was first published in 1963 by Kurt Aland.\n\nThe last printed edition of the K-Lists was published in 1994, so it’s currently 25 years out-of-date. It’s not surprising the K-Liste is available online, at the New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room (NT.VMR), where it’s easy to make updates. A revised edition of the K-Liste is expected to be printed in 2020, with 207 additions since the 1994 edition. The K-Liste now includes a few manuscripts in other languages, and currently has 6174 manuscripts total .\n\nThe online K-List has a shorter description than the printed book, but for some manuscripts there are photos and a transcription available. The online version has been a great benefit for researchers, as many manuscripts have been made available to people who would not have been able to view them previously. Even amateurs can view these manuscripts and marvel how God has preserved His word through the millennia.\n\nTry finding a manuscript on the New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room web site.

Unfortunately, many images are restricted to authorized researchers, so finding something interesting (to a non-Greek speaker) can be a matter of trial-and-error.
