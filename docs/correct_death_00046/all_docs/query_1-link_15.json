        "text": "But for those who do not want to wait until each book of the New Testament has had an ECM, it is possible to see manuscript collations for other books of the New Testament, which leads to the final part of my discussion: a walkthrough of digital editing on the NTVMR.\n\nIII. Digital Editing on the NTVMR: Unedited Realtime Collation [25]\n\nTaking digital editions to the next step would mean allowing users to become editors and enable them to ask their own questions of the source material. What if they want a collation compared to a different base text than the ECM or NA28? Users can, for example, take all the manuscripts in the NA and compare them against a late Byzantine manuscript. Or if they want to see where the NA manuscripts disagree where there is no apparatus unit in the edition itself, the collation results in the NTVMR offer a full listing of differences, not limited to only the variation units in the NA or ECM. If users want to see an apparatus with manuscripts other than what is already in these editions, they can, for example, make their own selection of three, or five, or hundreds of manuscripts and see how just these differ from each other. If they want to jettison the ECM and NA altogether and make a baseless collation, they can compare just the manuscripts they want without a base text. All of this is now possible through an open edition of the Greek New Testament on the NTVMR. This can be turned into an edition of the NA or whatever your project calls for.\n\n1. Witness list\n\nCreate your own witness list in Manuscript Workspace by clicking on Active List and then + Add New List (Figure 17). [32]\n\n2. Base text\n\nYou can use anything that has a transcription in the NTVMR for a base text.\n\n3. Regularization Rules\n\nRegularization Rules are any customizations you have made to orthography or other spellings, as well as adjustments to collations (the latter is explained below in Show Alignment Table). After you make your own rules, the setting should be changed to Personal; otherwise your rules will not appear.\n\n4. Ignore Options\n\nYou also have the option to include or exclude punctuation, brackets, underdots, and accents in the transcriptions.\n\n5. Which Transcriptions\n\nA benefit of using the NTVMR is the availability of many transcriptions. The option “Always Use Published” will give you what was used for the ECM volumes. Every manuscript used for the ECM of Acts has transcriptions available, as well as some of the well-known manuscripts such as Codex Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Bezae, and some papyri which have transcriptions available for the whole New Testament (where they are extant). Another advantage of using the NTVMR is that if you disagree with a transcription it is possible to change it yourself and then select “Prefer mine if present.” With this setting, any transcription you have done will be present (as long as you have selected this manuscript in your witness list, see step 1 above). Thus, this can enable you to conduct fresh research based on your own work.\n\n6. Include Extra Verses\n\nSometimes sense units or variants span more than one verse. With the option to include extra verses, one to four verses can be added to the beginning and end of a given verse for collation.\n\n7. Show Alignment Table\n\nThe alignment table is where fine-tuning of the automatic collation takes place. The collation will not automatically resemble the variant units in the NA. As a default, the collations are divided into one-word units. By selecting a beginning and end of a unit in the alignment table, a “parallel segmentation rule” can be set that will now combine these words into one unit (this can be thought of as a variation unit). [34] If you wanted, you can set the words together to resemble the variation units in the NA.\n\n8. Show Variant Graph\n\nThis was briefly mentioned as it pertains to the Collation page, but in the Unedited Realtime Collation page, the Variant Graph is not editable. It offers a static visual diagram of the flow of segmentation units for each manuscript.\n\n9. Download CSV\n\nFinally, the Alignment Table can be downloaded.\n\nAnd that is the basics of building and customizing an edition.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while some options are currently available for the NA as a digital edition, a full, open digital edition of the entire New Testament will not exist until every volume of the ECM has been adopted by the NA. I have discussed how the NA29 will be able to be viewed through the dECM for the book of Acts, how various tools can be utilized to access the NA28 for the Catholic Letters, and how to create your own edition of the Greek New Testament using the editing software in the NTVMR so that you do not have to wait until the ECM is finished for all books of the New Testament.\n\nOne final observation about the NTVMR is that none of this would be possible without international collaboration. Editing tools have been integrated from various developers, such as the collation editing program from ITSEE in Birmingham and the CollateX program from the international team headed by Ronald Haentjens Dekker and Gregor Middell. Not only are many of the transcriptions done by volunteers around the world, but the software and databases represent work done in Germany, England, Netherlands, and America, among other places. At the INTF, we are very grateful for the hard work and diligence of these scholars and students who continue to help make the vision of an open digital edition a reality.\n\nBibliography\n\nFootnotes"
