(Studiorum Nwi Testamenti Societas) was held from August 20 through August 24 in Basel, Switzerland, at the Universi- ty. It began with a business meeting on the first evening and continued for the next three days with a series of full-length main papers (the first being the presidential address of the newly inducted president, Dom J. Dupont), short main papers, and (simultaneous) short papers. In addition, each full day saw a two hour meeting of 14 seminars, with each pa&5pant choosihg one seminar for the duration of the met- inn. from offerinns such as \"Paul and Israel.\" \"Inhalte und Probleme einer neu- L e n t l i c h e n Tblogie:' \"The Johannine writings:' \"The Pseudepigraphaand the New 'Itstarmt:' '\"ktual Criticism,\" and the gnn~p I attended, \"Symbols, Metaphors and Models in the N.T.:' which dealt with ~huchlklism and ~eader-~esponse criti- cism. Included on the first full evening was a gala reception in the Base1 Munster (Cathedral) by city and university dignitaries, and the four days concluded with an afternoon trip to a Roman site near Basel comprising Augst-a former colony of Roman veterans which flourished from 15 B.C. to 260 A.D.--and Kaiser Augst-a fortress on the Rhein which served as a bridge defense from 300 to 400 A.D. All pmceeded unbelievably smoothly, and, it should be said without hesitation, this was due principally to the hard work and fine organization of Prof. Dr. and Mrs. Boe Reicke. The highlights of the four days are almost too numerous to recount, but the fol- lowing stand out: the main paper by Hans Wder (Zurich), \"Gesetz und Sunde: Gedanken zu einem qualitativen Sprung im Denken des Padus,\" an imaginative, illustrated-by-overhead-projector [sic!] treatment of Paul and the Law in Romans 512-20, which none in our circles would have disputed; the short main paper by Barbara Aland, \"Die neutestamentlichen Funde auf dem Sinai:' a first-hand analy- sis of recently discuvered Biblical and lectionary manuscripts in the St. Catharine's Monastery in the Sinai (with information on new uncials 0285 and 0289); the short (simultaneous) paper by Jack Kingsbury, 'The Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen in Matthew: Some Literary-Critical Observations:' a sound-indeed, rather tame- narratological enquiry which elicited many heated responses, d i n g that most N.T. scholars are incapable of taking the text of a Synoptic Gospel seriously as it stands, without raising questions about brlagen, Synoptic interrelationships, etc.; a display, not only of the first and second editions of Erasmus' Greek N.T., but also and especially of the Greek manuscripts which were used both in its compilation and in its corrections, along with the main short paper of H.J. de Jonge (Leiden), which argued persuasively that in 1516 Erasmus intended to produce, not a Greek edition of the N.T., but a new Latin edition, with the Greek text added to demon- strate his translation's accuracy; the short (simultaneous) paper of P. l? Beatrice (Padua), \"Apollos of Alexandria and the Origins of Jewish-Christian Baptism En- cratism:' which argued, bizarrely, that Apollos was W s main opponent at Corinth, his \"thorn in the flesh\" in 2 Corinthi i 12, and the original source of second cen- tury encratism; meeting and speakmg personally with scholars who were hitherto merely names or bibliographical entries (especially rewarding was participation in a conversation between Peter Stuhlmacher and Joseph Fitzmyer on justification and the Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue). Mention must also be made of a significant event which took place on the last evening of the General Meeting at the Gemindehaus of the local Lutheran congre- 30 CONCORDIA THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY gation in Basel. At a small reception, the outstanding Fi.sfschr$editedby w r w n William C. Winrich was presented by William Farmer (who was instrumental in facilitating the final stages of publication) to Rof. Dr. Bo k i c k upon his retire- ment from his professorial chair at the University of Basel. In attendance were (in addition to Frau Reicke, family members and Pfatnr and Frau wn Schroeder) B. Mazger, J. Carmignac, F. F. Bruee,.W. Rordarf, J, G. D. Dunn, R OrChad, J. Kings- bury, 0. N. Stanton, R. Puller, and adKr scholars coo numems to mention. Dr. Winrich was unable to be present and was represented, however inadequately, by this author. The next general meeting ofthe Society will be in Troodheim, Norway, in August of 1985. Society of Biblical Literature The 1984 Intenytional Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature was held in Strasbourg, France, August 16 and 17, several days prior to the General Meeting of the S.N.T.S., which began on August 20 in Basel. This was the second interna- tional meeting of the society, an American-based organization, the first having been held in Salamanca, Spain, in 1983. In general, the meeting was of good qurlhy and worthy of attendance. Fine papers were pmnted, and an opportunity was giv- en to meet scholars known heretofore by name only. Notable kchlres were: George Beasley-Murray, \"John 3:3,5: Baptism, Spirit and the Kingdom of God in the Fourth Gospel:' an outstanding piece of exegesis by an important participant in the Lutheran- Baptist dialogue (the paper pmvided a foundation d sorts for a Baptist acceptance of infant baptism); Charles Homer Giblin. \"Until Times for Nationsare Fulfilled (Luke 21:24c):' a sound literary analysis by a Roman Catholic thoqlogian of Luke's version of Jesus' \"1;ittle Apocalypse\" (cf. Mark U); Joseph Blenkinsopp, \"The Place ofP in the Generation of the Flood Narrative,\" a fresh and lively presentation which d e d how standard critical theories ofthe Pentateuch are cumntly being revised; Eduard Schweizer, \"Christologies after Rudolf Bultmann,\" a fine synthetic survey of the current theological scene. It must be said, hawever, that the SBL International Meeting was not up to stan- dards set by theGeneral Meeting of the S.N.T.S. On the one hand, almost all papers were \"simultaneous\" (presented concurrently with other papers), with the result that all too Frequently unpleasant choices had to be made. On the other hand, no name- tags were used, and no social activities, except for a very basic, final banquet, were arranged, so that it was quite a bit more difficult to meet the people and to discuss ideas than it was in Basel. It was also a disappointment that Kurt Aland, who was scheduled to lead the afternoon N.T. session on August 16, did not appear. No doubt, -4 improvements will be made, m n at the next meeting, which is sched- uled, tentatively at this time, for Amsterdam in 1985. James W. Voelz Homiletical Studies June 2, 1985 John alone of the Scripture authors mentions Nicodemus, and then three times: our text, 750-51, and 19:39. Out ofthe \"many other signs . . . these have been writ- ten that you may believe\" (20:30-31). The question before us then is: How do the Nicodemus accounts point us to Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, and, through Him, to life? The \"eternal lib\" of 3:16 does not mean \"everlasting 'this l i f e but rather \"a new quality of life.\" Note that the three \"How can this be?'questions of Nicodemus bve much the same sense as Luther's \"What does this mean?\" After all the commentary on 3:3, two points stand out. First, both translations, \"born again\" and \"born from abave,\" should be acknowledged. Rrhaps \"born anew\" comes close. Compan the Greek of 3:3 with 3:31, 19:11, 2 Cor. 517; Ga. 4:9; Tt. 3:s; 1 Pe. 1:23. Second, there is nxnn to read this rebirth as God's onetime activity in Christ repeatedly brought to the individual Christian life. Note the pneutna-pneumatos in verse 8, and consider On 2% 7;. 379-10, Jn 20:22; 2 'h 3:16 John picks up Marte- via (vll) in 3:31-36; 5:31-47; 8:12-20. The judgment-redemption theme of this text is also t&tcd in 5:22; 8:15; 9:39; 1247. Jesus could assume (3:U) that Nicodemus was familiar with Nu 215-9. 1Way's preacher cannot make the same assumption of his wngrcgation. Introducrion.The odds in this life an long. Then is little chance the boy starting in flag football will ever play in the NFL.. The man starting a small business is glad to survive without much hope of becoming another IBM. The mortician expects our business sooner or later. The odds against man by himself in his spiritual life are even worse. It is very good news, then, that GOD CHANGES THE ODDS IN OUR FAVOR I. Natural man is doomed (v 6a, l3a). A. Nicodemus perfectly represents the aristocratic, well-intentioned but unen- lightened Judaism of his day, and the best of men in our time. The best Nicodemus could do was to move 1. From the darkness of night (v 2), 2. Through the intrigue of politics (750-51) 3. To the gloom (half-light, mostly-dark) of the grave (19:39). B. Our best effprts also are doomed (Is 64:6). 1. We neither understand nor can control earthly things (v 8). 2. Even less do we, on our own, believe heavenly things (vv 9-12, Is 6Q:6b). 11. Jesus came to change the odds for us (v 13). A. God the Father did not want us to perish (v 16). B. Jesus did not come to condemn us (v 1%). C. Jesus came to bring eternal life (vv 15-17). 1. \"Eternal life\" is not just everlasting \"thislife\". 2. Those \"born anew\" in Christ have a new quality of life (v 3b, 5b, 6b). In. Jesus' method was to absorb the consequences of our former odds. A. Jesus did His work in the light (Jn 18:20). B. He came into our darkness (v 2a, Jn l3:30b). C. He even went to the darkness of the cross (v 14). 1. Where snakebite would have killed us (Nu 2159). 2. Jesus absorbed the venom, even died dit for us (On 3:ISb and 2 Cor 5:Z). Conclusion: When all odds were against us, Jesus came from the life of heaven into our darkness that we might be born anew into His light. Warren E. Messman Rushville, Indiana SECOND SUNlMV AFI'ER In nine instances in Mk 1:21 though 3:l2, Jesus not only claims deity, but shws the pawer of deity. He demonstnrtar His paver ps Semnt ova a demon, dkyc , leprosy, paralysis, a publican, the old religion, the Sabbath (our text), defomty, and demons. Jesus accepts implicit mponsibility for His disciples' behavior. Our behavior when we claim discipleship still refiats on Jesus. But mom, Jesus take? this opportunity to teach what had been b m about W s mt. Meditate on On 2:2-3; HO 6:6; Mt 12:ll-12; and Dt 5:l2-15. The Srbboth is &Wed fw physical and spiritual bkssing.

See Lenski for help with the Abiathar-Ahimelech \"contamrsy.\" Intduction: What are we doing hen this morning? DO WE KEEP THE SABBATH OR DOES TIfE SABBATH KEEP Us? I. We enslave ourselves to the Sabbath when we regard the letter of the Law as inviolable at the expense of God's intention. A. The Pharisees tried to hold Jesus' disciples to an interpretation of the Law that went beyond God's intent, v 24. B. Sometimes we concern ourselves mon: with \"nght\" doctrine or \"right\" litur- gy than with true worship, Ho 6 6 C. W can misuse the Sabbath on weekdays too. 1. A people more concerned with its own congregation than the communi- ty or the hurting in our world denies Christ. 2. When we insist on out rights but neglect our responsibilities, we deny Christ. 3. When we are more interested in being lwad than in loving, we deny Christ. 11. God intends the Sabbath to keep us. A. Jesus reaffirmed that the Sabbath was made for man, v 27a. 1. Jesus sewed His disciples by defending them. 2. Jesus used David ( w 25-26) to demonstrate two points: a. Tbe!bbbathismadctosemman. b. CertrinwakismoreimportPMthnnguPltion.

'Ib what extent tbe c h q c oftbe scribes agb t Jewur influenced His relatives to restrain Him is difficult to say. In sny case, when Jesus is infwmed of His relatives' desire to speak to Him, He utilhs the umimly intMTuption to teach an important truth. Je- sus is not ashamed of His earthly rtlationahips, but He emphasizes that there is a higher relationship which hhgm on doing God's will, that is, God's gracious will, 34 CONCORDIA THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY which is that we repent and believe the Gospel. The central thought of the text is that we do God's'will when, by the working of the Holy Spirit, we belim in Jesus as the conqueror of Satan for us. Intduction: Ties of flesh and blood bind family members. Lave and companion- ship bind husbands and wives. Common ink- and like-miadedness bind friends. In every relationship there are bonds that hold people together. It is so also in our relationship with Christ. FAITH IS THE TIE THAT BINDS US TO CHRIST I. Faith in Christ as the conqueror of Satan. A. Jesus demonstrated His power aver Satan. 1. He d m out evil spirits (Mk 3:ll). 2. When He died and rose from the grave (v D, Col2:lS; 1 Jn 3:8), Jesus delivered us from Satan's p e r and opened the way to a faith relation- ship with Himself as the conqueror of Satan, B. Satan still tries to bind us. 1. By leading us to think, along with Christ's relatives, that too much zeal in religion may be an indication of mental instability. 2. By leading us to misj-, along with the scribes, the'cunning and stm@ of Satan. C. Yet because Christ plundered Satan's house, we can now be brothers and sisters of Jesus. 1. Jesus leads us who were bound by Satan to repentance and faith. 2. Satan is marking time until his final judgment on the Last Day. He can- not talce from us our faith in Christ. 11. Faith worked in us by the Holy Spirit. A. By the power of the Spirit we daily do God's will (v 35). 1. The will of God is that we believe in Jesus as our brother and the con- queror of Samn (v 34; 1 Tm 2:4). 2. We do God's will when we let our faith be nurtured by the Spirit through God's M r d and the Sacraments. B. We guard against blaspheming the Holy Spirit (vv 28-30). 1. Blasphemy of the Spirit takes place if we reject what we know to be true, namely, the Spirit's testimony to Christ in the Scriptures. 2. It is the unforgivable sin to reject against our better knowledge the Spirit who alone can work faith. Conclusion: By Spirit-wrought faith we have come into a relationship that is h@er and nobler than any earthly relationship. We are brothers and sisters, not of Satan (God forbid!), but of Jesus Christ, the Lord! Gerhard Ah0 Homiletical Studies 35 The parable in verse 26-29 emphasizes that the seed (God's Mrd) produces fruit byitscrwnpmrandinitsowntime.~cantrusttheseedtoworkandaotwo~ about it. W cannot malre the Wrd more dFraive than it is. Luther says, \"The King- dom of God comes indeed of itself without our prayer.'' Where the Word has been sown, there will be a harvest. The harvest is at our death or at Christ's final wming, whichever occurs first. W cad patiently trust the seed to do its work and bide God's time for the harvest. The accood parable (~30-32) stmses the contrast between the insignificant be- ginning of the kingdom of God and its surprising ending. Rome was oblivious to the kingdom Christ brought, and the Jewish leaders were blind to it. The religious leeders could not conceive of God's kingdom in the person of a child born in a sta- bte who later as a man associated with public sianem.

Even after physical growth stops human b&tgs need to keep on gmwing intellectually and in other ways. Gmwth is aaxssary to experience life at its fullest. Growth is a featun also of God's kingdom specifidy of the W of that kingdom.-The parables in the fourth chapter of hfark's -pel, beginning with the parable of the sower, focus on God's Word. Tbe text points out that THE W R D OF GOD GROWS I. TheWrdgmws@ually. A. As the seed is sown (v 26). 1. Psstors and also lay-Christians sow the seed of the Word. 2. The sawing goes on whatever God's Wmi is proclaimed and taught. Gradual sowing is necessary for gradual growth. B. As the plant develops. 1. Nk can pnpare the ground and nurture the plant, but the seed grows of itself, mysteriously (v Zm). 2. Wmaysometimesgadiswuragedbecausethegrawthissogradual, but growth there will be (Is 55:ll). Therefore, we can relax (v 27a) and let the Word work acwrding to its own schedule. While learning to be patient with gmwth that is gradual, we must also face up to thefactthat 11. The Wmi grows inconspicuously. A. The Word is as inconspicuous as a mustard seed in the beginning stages of its growth (v 31). 1. The great and the powerful in Christ's day gave little notice to the Word growing in their midst. 2. Those who wield power and influence in the world today are indifferent for the most part to the growth of the Word. WIIOTmNISTMsl I. HeistheIndofnuure. A. He cmted nature. 1.

I confess His Lodship through the Holy Spirit (1 Cor l2:3). Conclusion: The goal of this sermon is to elicit the confession, \"Lord Jesus!\" I can confess this only with a S p i r i t e t faith. Hence, \"M, increase my fnith!\" G. Wdemar Degner The last of this text (Mk 5:43) poses two problems. The first portion states: \"And He chaqpd them much that no one should know this.\" This is the socalled \"Me88ianic Secllet:' which coafronts us throughout this Gospel beginning with k44. For a derailed review of alternative answers to this problem see Jack Dean Kiagsbu- ry, lltK Christology gfhfonk's Gospel (Philadelphia: Fortrws Pnss, 1983). In sum- mary, Jesus did not want the \"pearls\" of the Gospel to be cast to the swine (Mt 7:6); He wanted the Good Nms proclaimed only to those readied by repentance. The \"key\" to the secret is in Mk 8:31ff, where first the sutkings and death of Christ are mentioned, and then the individual cross-bearing of the follower is stmsscd.

In the midst of the tumult of the noise-makers and pmfkasional w#pers faith latches on to the W of life (w 38-40). 4. Faith reasoas this way: Where sin abounds, grace abounds mn more; where condemnation convicts, God's righteausn#ls acquits; wbm death reigns, life superabounds (Ro 5:lS-17; Is 40:2). B. Faith-lilk attains the restoration that Christ came to bring. 1. Jairus' daughter is raised by the divine command (v 41). 2. Red life now begins. Conclusion: God give us such a radical faith! Homiletical Studies 39 SEVENTH SUNIMY AETER PENTECm July 14,19115 Introduction: Sometimes we envision the ministry of Jesus in terms of strong responses of faith and crowds of people follawing Him. Indeed, at times He took special note of a strong faith. Not long before the events mentioned in our text Jesus spoke to the woman healed of an issue of blood saying, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well\" (Mk 5:34; see also Mt 8:lO). In contrast to such beautiful responses we need to be a w m also of the negative responses to Jesus' ministry. The text re- lates such a response in Christ's home town of Nazareth. UNBELIEF IN THE WAY OF JESUS' BLESSING I. Unbelief has its roots in envy and pride (vv 1-3). A. The question, \"Where did this man get all this?\" betrays an envy which will not admit that Jesus had a greater depth of knowledge than they who had the same education and environment. B. The pride of many would not allow them to believe that one who had g m n up among them could be more important than they. 1. Because we are instructad and confirmed in the Lutheran Church are we sometimes offended because someone implies that we should grow in knowledge and in faith and in ability to serve? 2. )ire we jealous or envious of those in teaching and leadership positions? Do we forget that God speaks to us through sinful people? C. In their unbelief many could not acccpt Jesus as the embodiment of the true God (v 3). Haw could Mary's son be the Son of God? (cf. Luther's explana- tion of the Third Article). Zkansition: These thoughts and attitudes caused many to \"take offense at Him\" and robbed them of the blessings Jesus meant to bestow. 11. Unbelief has sad results (v 5). A. Among the many who were offended a few did believe and were healed. However, the general unbelief of His hometown people pmented Him from bestowing more such blessings. B. The even greater work Jesus wished to do among them was to draw them into His kingdom. For them He was living. For them He would die. For them He would empty the tomb on Easter morning. The saddest result of their rejection of Him was not their lack of physical healing, but their lack of spiritual healing in their relationship to their God. Their sins separated them. Jesus wanted to heal them of this separation, but was prevented by their unbelief. C. So He went to other towns and villages and later sent His disciples to these towns. Conclusion: As we take our place in the ministry of our Lord under His chosen ministers, we are warned against pride and envy and the awful consequences of un- belief. Yet rejection is not a signal for us to stop our ministry but an inducement to bring the Gospel to others. Rudolph A. Haak Montevideo, Minnesota I. 'Ikavcl light (w 8-9). A.

MinaesoEa Homiletical Studies 41 NINTH SUNMY AFTEll IWTMSST \"Compassion\" (splandinitmncu', v 34) is one of those words on which an entire sermon could be prrrched and atill wt have iu full mePning exhausted. This verb occurs I2 times in the N.T., all in the Synoptics and all having Christ as the subject. Thewwdcamofimmthenaur~whichoriginally meant 'Yheiarmrdp~W, or entrails, cspe&lly the heart, lungs and liver,'' considered the site of man's deepest passions. The mmhg of \"compsssioll, mmy, k l pity\" is tound only in the writings of Judaism a d the N.T. @NW. The compassion of Christ exerts itself as the controlling theme of this text. The twelve disciples had come bsck from their mission (w 7-13) exhausted, yet excited. Using good psychology, Jesus hurs them out. He senses their need for the rest and He takes them away to a quiet place. But a gnater oeed soon presents itself to which Jesus responds with ccmpassim. The cranrds that hounded Him wew spiritually destitute, \"like sheep without a shcphmd.\" Jesus selflessly gives Himself to the needs ofHisdisciplesontheoaehndandtotheaeedsofthecmwdontheother. People dben picture Jesus the w q m ~ a y see a pastor, as w n e too busy to be bothered. \"He's got so muy otber things to do, so mq other people to help, He certainly couldn't be concerned about my problem.\" But Jesus is concerned. We have a com- passionate Loml who knoum our needs, f#ls for us, and does something to help. Zntroduaion: It b been quipped that m of lik's major mistakes is being the last mmber of the funily to gc.$ the flu-after all the compassion has run out. It is often true of us that a lot of our compassion is wasted on ourselns, or we are compassionate as long as it toe$ us nothing.

The crrnlrds were unnnran of their spiritual pcnrerty. They wanted a miracle-worker and a kbg @z 34; Llc 15:4-7). 3. What about our selfish motives for wanting Jesus and our casual attach- ments to Him? C. Jesus is compassionate, not wanting any to be loat. 1. These were Hi sheep (Ez 34; U 15:4-7). 2. His attachment to us is one of laving ownership (Jn H):14, 15). 11. His compassion m s Him to Action. A. He shepherds. 1. By going out of His rmy and even intempting His plans. 2.

That description of Himself was absurd, thy thought, because they knew His parents. But J&us was undeterred. Whether or not His audience believed it, He continued to exmad on the theme of heavenly bread as a self-characterization. He provided the kiciob of life that even the heavenly bread of the Old 'Mamcnt days of wilderness wandering could not provide. The people who ate the manna had long since died. But those who \"eat\" of the Bread of Life have a permanent life, an eternal life (v SO), which begins the moment that Godbringsthemtofaith. C l d y in this text Jesus is making the very most of the bread image suggested by the f#ding ofthe 5000. The main point ofthe text is that Jesus is the Source of dl life and provides by grace thmugh faith an everlasting life which begins right now. The goal ofthe sermon is to emphasize that those who cling to Jesus can have the absolute confidence that their eternal life has already begun. The pFob1em is thatthereanmanywhothiaktheycanfindtheirawnwaytolifeandthateventrue . . Chns&ans can fwset that their life in Christ never has to end, from this moment on to eternity. The means to the god is the Savior's gracious gift of His awn life (the \"bread\") which He makes d a b l e for the eternal life of everyone. Inhoductm: Life after life always has been an amactive concept for man. Fnnn the ancient Egyptians who outfitted the pyramids with lavish treasures for the use of their rulers in the w e d after-life to the recent fascination with \"after-death\" e x p e r i e ~ ~ l of people k l a d clinically dead, man has wanted to believe that he could live in happiness emn after physical death. The message of Jesus is that he can, but only through a relationship of $ith with the true \"Bmd of Life.\" Whst is more, this life can begin right nowcontinuing into eternity even as physical life ceases. It is a thoroughly Christian and completely heartening truth to announce that ETERNAL LIFE IS A PRESENT TENSE I. Jesus provides more than physical life. A. Bread for the body is necessary. 1.

Our need is for Bread to nourish our souls (Jn 62427). Jesus alone is this B d (v 51). W arc nourished by the sacrifice of His flesh and the shedding of His blood (w 51b, 53; He 9:l2). B.

Although God's manna fed the Israelites, they all died (v 58b). 2. In Jesus there is life that death does not destrq (w 51, 54, 57, 58; Re 1:17b, 18). B. God's promise is for tJme who pemrlre. 1. This Bread is not to be admired as a centerpiece on a table. 2. This Breed is to be eaten. a. By faith (Jn 6:29, 47, 48). b. In the Sacraments (Mt 26:26-28). C. W s promise is for all. 1. No one is denied this Bread (Jn 6:37b, 51). 2. God's grace is all-inclusive (Is 55:1, 2). Conclusim: May God grant that we partake of His Living Bread from Heaven with the same eagerness that we feed on the bread He pmvides from the fields. Lawnnce W. Mitchell Bloomington, Indiana Some of the 5000 Jesus fed expected to hear how Jesus would keep them in bread (Jn 614,15,33,34). It is a common misconception that Jesus speaks words that make us \"happy\" and that guarantee material success to every \"true\" believer. But Jesus says no such thing. The disappointed hearers responded: \"This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?\" The problem is that people do understand and do not like what they hear ( w 61.66). His words are unique. They bring eternal life to all who share the confession of Peter: \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life; and we have believed, and have come to k m , that you are the Holy One of God\" ( w 68.69). The central thought is that only Jesus has words of eternal life. The goal of the ser- mon is that the hearer not try to force his own words into the mouth of Jesus, but rather accept and believe the wrds of Jesus Himself. Inhoduaion: ?he stmy of Mary and Martha is familiar to most of us (Lk 10:38-42). While Martha was \"distracted with much serving:' Mary \"sat at the Lord's k t and listened to his teaching.\" Why?

He asked why Pilate questioned H i about his kinghip. Behind this question lay Jesus' concern for the truth, and His desire fw Pilate to h e that truth as well. B . ~ a r e ~ b y t h e K i D g o f t h e k i n g d o m o f a u t h . 1. 'I& offea we wwld hide behind the half-truth of our outward piety.

Kiagdams that seek ow devotion are obviously powerful, visible, and with gnat h m g s of followers. Fslse Christ-denying cults attract many bllawcts. Ramrful npecial h m t groups seek ow support. Highly visi- ble e m p b want our Sveatments oftime a d money to aid their building. 3. But whether in the nume of religion, special inbrest, or financial secu- rity, all such ldngdoms are doomed to ultimate failure. These are not of the essence of Jesus' true kingdom. B.

Jesus ssys, \"If mine wm an earlhly kingdom the visible trappings would 3 present.\" Servants wwld fight, power wwld be obvious to all. 2. t, Jesus has a grater paver-rmth. He has greater loyalty-the lovers of truth are His subjects. C.Jmus~ustobepartofHiskingdomoftruth. 1. This means more than allowing Jesus to be true. It means recognizing the truth of His mission: to testify of the auth of God's love for all. The greatest testimony of that truth is fuund in the cross of Calvary. 2. This also calls b r us to lay aside worldly definitions of glory and power. ' h e power, lasting and benefiial power, is founded in Jesus' kingdom of truth alone. Conclusion: Jesus coRfronts us with truth's claim on us-the truth concerning our need of Fepentance, and the truth of Christ's cms-earned forgiveness. May we re- joice as subjects of the King of the kingdom of-, ever l b n h g to the King Himself. David L.

Scaer 66 CONCORDIA THEOUXiICAL QUAKI'ERLY not all Reformed are of Dutch background and are not committed to a particular polity are so harmless that they could have been excluded without a gnat loss. He- link bends aver backwards to diminish the importance of creeds in his tradition and mentions that all Lutherans, except for the M i h r i Synod, have taken the same mute. (At the turn of the century Pieper said just about the same thing about the Reformed.) The chapter on the liturgical character of the Refwmed selfdemucrs when it is men- tioned that the Lord's Supper is celebrated fDur times a year. While Lutheranism is Christocentric, Calvinism's stress is on the sovereignty of God. We are warned by the author of \"an unbiblical Chriswntrism:' The Reformed faith is still the religion of the Holy Spirit who. works in a parallel action alongside of the Word. For Lutherans the Holy Spirit works only in the Gospel, i.e., the message about Christ. Heaselink is honest and to the point. He has perfwmed a great service. No other conclusion is possible than that Lutheranism and the Reformed faith are two difkrent religions, beginniog with their difkring concepts of God, Christ, and reve- lation. That is only the start. The problem on the Lord's Supper is only a sympto- matic blemish of the d fundamental problems. A book lib this is always of great value as it shows where some characteristically Reformed thoughts have been panned off as Lutheran. David P. Scaer THE POWER OF THE POWERLESS: The Word of Liberation for i'oday. By Juergen Moltmann. San Francisco: Harper and Row, Publishers, 1983. 166 pages. Cloth, n.p. About twenty years ago Moltmann's theology of hope placed him in a posi- tion of piomhence in the theological world from which he has not fallen. His other books, never matching the first in depth and scholarship, are variations on the theme adopted from the philosopher Ernst Bloch that disappointment provides the future with the foundation of hope. In Power of the Powerless the eighteen chapters are sermons centering on this theme with special atten- tion to man's participation in the social order to bring about a better world ex- istence. With the American background of the Social Gospel, Moltmann's message has found even a more fertile soil on this side of the Atlantic than in its Ger- man homeland. Each chapter is supplied with a Biblical text and many provide a concluding prayer. This is usable material. Attractive in Moltmann's ap- proach is a deliberate attempt to be Biblical both in themes and language, very much like Karl Barth. Of course, this can be its greatest danger. A sermon on Noah becomes a plea for conserving natural resources. One on the peacemakers pushes pacificism. A final sermon urges Christian responsibility for Third World countries. Moltmann is Reformed, but with his concept of God's involvement in the suffering world he is more like Luther in content and language than Calvin with his idea of God's transcendence. Thus the sermon Book Reviews 67 for Good Friday bristles with phrases (of course, abstracted from the totality of Moltmann's theology) that emphasize a suffering Christ, too often forgot- ten. If the suffering theme of Moltmann is a corrective for a Christology which sees humiliation as an embarrassing interlude in the divine plan, it would have no meaning without the \"who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven.\" Since this is missing, Moltmann's Christ is hardly more than the man who in disappointment continues to hope. David P. Scaer MELANCHTHONS BRIEFWECHSEL. Band 4. Rcgesten 3421-4528 (1544-1546). Barbeitet von Heinz Scheible unter Mitwirkung von Walther Thuringer. Frommann-Holzboog, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstaat, 1983. Cloth. 477 pages. CoUected here are one thousand one hundred and seven letters from the year 1544 to 1546 of the German reformer, Phillip Melanchthon. The letters are not transcribed word for word, but the editors have organized the original material into straightforward sentences. In the more extensive letters, the sentences are numbered for more efficient reference. Some of the letters are authored by Melanchthon along with Luther and Bugenhagen and others are those received by him. % As these lettys come from the period just around Luther's death, some of them can be mentioned briefly.On February 17,lM,Brenz wrote to Melanch- thon complaining about participating in the Regensburg colloquy with the- Catholics as they had not changed their position on justifikation. On the next day, Melanchthon wrote Luther wishing him a safe journey home, thanking him for informing him about the death of Pope Paul 111, and saying that his wife had sent him the requested medicine. On February 21, the elector sent Melanchthon a letter telling him to make funeral preparations for Luther. Other letters speak about the emperor's mobilizing of the troops to move against the Lutherans. Reformation research will benefit greatly from the publishing of these edited letters. David P.

MARTIN UlTHER'S DEUTSCHE BIBEL. By Hans Wlz. Herausgegeben wn Heb ning Wimdhd. Friedrich Wittig Whg, Hamberg, G e m , 1977.253 p a p . 98 marks. Although this d e n t work wee published in 1977, it might be looked upon as preparcltion for the 450th annivcmary (1984) of the traa9lrtion and publidion of Luther's Old and New 'Mamem as the aetman Bible in 1534. The publication of Luther's German BiMehas ken labelled as the greatest bookcvent ofthe six- teenth century. Dr. Hans k l z (1904-1978), an authority on the Luther Bible and also a contributor on Ludrer's Oerman Bible to the Wimar edition of Luther's wwks, intended this wlume as a publication on the origin and publication of the German Bible, especially for the general public. U n h ~ t e l y , he was n6t able to see the pmjh through, a task d e d out by Henning Wendland. The wlum has ten chapters, plus a time table, a bibliograpiy and a listbg of allpersonsandcvcnts~tointhebook.
