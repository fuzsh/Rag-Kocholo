        "text": "German theologian and biblical scholar\n\nKurt Aland (28 March 1915 – 13 April 1994) was a German theologian and biblical scholar who specialized in New Testament textual criticism. He founded the Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung (Institute for New Testament Textual Research) in Münster and served as its first director from 1959 to 1983. He was one of the principal editors of Nestle–Aland – Novum Testamentum Graece for the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft and The Greek New Testament for the United Bible Societies.\n\nAland was born in Berlin-Steglitz. He started studying theology in 1933 at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin (he also studied philology, archaeology, and history). On 23 March that year, he was examined before the Bruderrat (council of brothers) in the Bekennende Kirche (Confessing Church). During his studies, he worked for the journal of the Confessing Church, Junge Kirche (Young Church). In an ideological brochure, Wer fälscht? (Who is lying?), written against Mathilde Ludendorff, he confirmed the position of the Confessing Church and identified with them. In 1939, he studied for his bachelor's degree under the guidance of Hans Lietzmann. In 1940, he was released from military service; and, in 1941, after Lietzmann's death, he took over the responsibilities of editing the Theologische Literaturzeitung (the only German theological magazine at that time). He graduated that same year, and in 1944 was ordained as minister of the parish of Berlin-Steglitz.\n\nAfter World War II, Aland became a lecturer on the theological faculty of the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1947, he was appointed professor ordinarius in Halle (Saale).\n\nAland disapproved of the Marxist government of East Germany, and was persecuted as a result. In 1953, he was accused of smuggling watches to West Berlin and was kept under arrest for three months. Aland frequently spoke out against various forms of state oppression directed at churches and also demanded freedom of speech in East Germany. In July 1958, he lost his job at the University. However, in September of that year, he successfully escaped to West Berlin. His 8000-volume library was incorporated into the University Library.\n\nIn 1958, he became a professor at the University of Münster, Germany. Aland declined the offer for a professorship at the University of Chicago in 1960.[1][2] In Münster he founded the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (\"Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung\") in 1959, which he directed until 1983. Furthermore, he founded the world's first \"Bible Museum\" in 1979, which was unique in the world for many years. His institute achieved worldwide recognition by publishing the Nestle–Aland – Novum Testamentum Graece and The Greek New Testament for the United Bible Societies.\n\nAland was married twice. His first marriage was to Ingeborg Aland (they had three children together). In 1972, he married Barbara Aland. He died in Münster, Germany, in 1994.\n\nKurt Aland was representative of increasing specialism within theological-historical studies.[3] In the field of New Testament research, his work (and also the work that he did together with his wife Barbara Aland in the Institute for New Testament Textual Research in Münster) is internationally acclaimed.\n\nThe focus of his work began as an intense and adventurous search for old manuscripts on several expeditions to abbeys in Russia and Greece (amongst others). He discovered numerous manuscripts of the New Testament, whose evaluation is still in progress.[4] Most notable among his work was the newly arranged edition of Novum Testamentum Graece (Greek New Testament) in 1979 (also called Nestle–Aland).[3] This textual foundation for the New Testament exemplifies a scholarly mentality aimed at achieving the highest possible convergence with the \"original text.\"\n\nFurthermore, he acted in the Hermann-Kunst-Stiftung, which was founded in 1964 by Hermann Kunst, a good friend of Aland. Many important figures within politics and economics participated in the sponsorship of the Institute for New Testament Textual Research.\n\nAnother priority in his life was church history, being concerned with the early church, the Reformation, and movements such as pietism and revivalism.\n\nAland received critical acclaim for his profundity and comprehensive knowledge of the textual sources for the New Testament. His contemporary presence is relevant, having contributed to modern scientific methodology.[3] Aland was of the opinion that every work within historical research stands on its adherence to reliability and accessibility.\n\nThe archives (Nachlass) of Kurt Aland are provided in the University Archives of the University of Münster, Germany.[5]\n\nKurt Aland achieved the following honorary doctorates:\n\n1950: \"Dr. (h.c.)\", from University of Göttingen (Germany)\n\n1957: \"Doctor of Divinity\", from University of St Andrews (Scotland)\n\n1971: \"Doctor of Literature\", from Wartburg College (Iowa)\n\nHe received the following awards:\n\n1963: Golden \"Cross of Athos\" of the patriarchate of Alexandria[6]\n\n1975: \"Burkitt Medal\" for Biblical Studies by the British Academy[6]\n\n1976: Grant Cross of Merit, neck cross (Großes Verdienstkreuz)[6]\n\n1983: Grant Cross of Merit with star (Großes Verdienstkreuz mit Stern)[7]\n\n1985: \"Luther-Medal\" from the University of Halle-Wittenberg[8]\n\n1985: \"Canstein-Medal\" from the German Bible Society[9]\n\n1994: \"St. Paul's Biglerville Prize\" from the Lutheran Historical Society of the Mid-Atlantic[10][11]\n\nKurt Aland was a member of the following academies:\n\nsince 1955: Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (Germany)\n\nsince 1969: British Academy\n\nsince 1975: Academy of Science of Göttingen (Germany)\n\nsince 1976: Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences[12]\n\nFestschriften:\n\nText – Wort – Glaube in Honour of Kurt Aland, ed.
