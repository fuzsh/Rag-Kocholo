        "text": "Following its publication in March 1516, Erasmus’s Novum Instrumentum became one of the most significant texts for the Reformation. A less explored element of the development of this first published Greek New Testament is the role of the Old Testament editor, Johannes Oecolampadius (1482–1531). This study focuses on the contributions of Oecolampadius with particular attention given to the Annotations on Romans. By looking through the lens of the remarks in the Novum Instrumentum regarding the Hebrew language and the Old Testament, and comparing them with the lectures by Martin Luther on Romans that he finished with the use of this newly available resource, the influence Oecolampadius had on Luther before his famous action in October 1517 becomes more apparent. Notably, then we can see the resulting influence of Luther on Oecolampadius to embrace the newly forming evangelical teaching and eventually become the leading reformer in Basel.\n\nDesiderius Erasmus was the first to make the Greek New Testament available in printed form. By doing so he established the form the Greek New Testament would take for almost four hundred years. Consequently, vernacular translations based on the Greek reflected that form. In the English-speaking world, where the King James Version dominated until the 1980s, his influence persisted for over 450 years. Some aspects of it persist in the majority of English versions in use today.\n\nThe famous Codex Vaticanus (Vat. gr. 1209 in the Vatican Library) is currently regarded as one of the most essential sources for reconstructing the Greek text of the New Testament. Although it had already been used by textual critics from the sixteenth century onward, the manuscript only rose to the prominent status it now holds in the course of the nineteenth century. This PhD thesis writes the scholarly history of Codex Vaticanus, beginning from Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536) and his Greek New Testament editions until the editio princeps of this manuscript prepared by Cardinal Angelus Maius (1782–1854). In this time-period that spans 350 years, perceptions of this manuscript changed profoundly. For a long time it had been seen as an inferior witness, useless for making the Greek New Testament edition. However, scholars gradually discovered its value and importance, and their appreciation eventually led to the consensus that considers its text as foundational for the Modern Critical Text, the basis for many contemporary vernacular translations of the New Testament. By examining critical editions, analysing monographs and articles, considering book reviews and pamphlets, and delving into archive collections, the present study delineates the stages of the manuscript’s progression from an ancient manuscript held at the Vatican Library to its designation as the ‘Codex Vaticanus’. It is a study of the many individuals and their stories surrounding this very manuscript, stories about accessibility and the dissemination of knowledge, authority and head-on collisions between the most learned critics, and of continuity and changing paradigms in scholarship. All in all, this thesis sets out how Codex Vaticanus became the manuscript par excellence in the history of New Testament textual scholarship.\n\nAlthough often eclipsed by the giants of the Reformation, Desiderius Erasmus had a notable influence on the Reformation and the world that followed. Responsible for five editions of the Greek New Testament, his contributions include a renewed emphasis on the Greek over against the Latin of the day, as well as influence on subsequent Greek New Testaments and many translations, including Luther’s German Bible and the English King James Version. In God’s providence, Erasmus provided kindling for the fire of the Reformation."
