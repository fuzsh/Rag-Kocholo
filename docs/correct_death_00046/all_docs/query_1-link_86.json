        "text": "Textual Reliability / Accuracy Of The New Testament\n\nIslamic Awareness\n\n© Islamic Awareness, All Rights Reserved.\n\nFirst Composed: 20th May 1999\n\nLast Modified: 23rd May 2007\n\nTweet\n\nAssalamu ʿalaykum wa rahamatullahi wa barakatuhu:\n\n1. Introduction\n\nHow reliable or accurate is the New Testament text? If this question is posed to the Christian apologists or evangelists, the answer obtained varies depending upon who they quote and what they quote. But they all have a common line of argument; invariably they will all appeal to the numerical superiority of the manuscripts of the New Testament. They also point to the overwhelming evidence for the reliability of the New Testament manuscripts over other books from the ancient world such as Homer's Iliad, Hindus' Mahabharata, Tacitus' Annals, Pliny's Natural History, etc.\n\nThe Christian apologists' second line of defence is abundance of Patristic citations and how these citations can supposedly completely reconstruct the New Testament without any recourse to the New Testament manuscript evidence.\n\nIn this paper, we will examine the claim, firstly, whether numerical supremacy directly translates into textual reliability; secondly, if Patristic citations can completely reconstruct the New Testament text; thirdly, the magnificent numbers for textual accuracy that are quoted are correct and fourthly, the claim of very early manuscript evidence for the New Testament text.\n\n2. Evidence Or An Apology? Or Worse?\n\nPerhaps it would be a better idea to see what kind of statements are made by the Christian apologists to support their point of view. This will enable us to gain a better insight into whether their claims rest on solid grounds or whether they are just offering an apology for their belief, or worse.\n\nTHE ABUNDANCE OF GREEK NEW TESTAMENT MANUSCRIPTS\n\nThe chief line of defence of the Christian apologists for the textual accuracy and reliability of the New Testament is their subscription to the abundance of Greek New Testament manuscripts and how they inspire confidence in the current New Testament text. The apologists point toward the textual abundance of the New Testament manuscripts (5400+) as opposed to, for example, ancient classics like Homer's Iliad (643 manuscripts). This view was first popularized, perhaps, by F. F. Bruce and later on it was propagated by others. Bruce says:\n\nThe evidence for our New Testament writings is ever so much greater than the evidence for many writings of classical authors, the authenticity of which none dreams of questioning. And if the New Testament were a collection of secular writings, their authenticity would generally be regarded as beyond all doubt. It is a curious fact that historians have often been much readier to trust the New Testament records than have many theologians. Somehow or other, there are people who regard a 'sacred book' as ipso facto under suspicion, and demand much more corroborative evidence for such a work than they would for an ordinary secular or pagan writing. From the viewpoint of the historian, the same standards must be applied to both. But we do not quarrel with those who want more evidence for the New Testament than for other writings; firstly, because the universal claims which the New Testament makes upon mankind are so absolute, and the character and works of its chief Figure so unparalleled, that we want to be as sure of its truth as we possibly can; and secondly, because in point of fact there is much more evidence for the New Testament than for other ancient writings of comparable date.[1]\n\nOne of the most oft-quoted works is that of Norman Geisler. His argument regarding the textual reliability of the New Testament is based on the numerical strength of the New Testament manuscripts, something that is not available for many ancient classics. Almost all the Christian apologetical literature, especially on the internet, relies on his material.\n\nGeisler and Abdul Saleeb have claimed that the well-known New Testament scholar Bruce Metzger in his book Chapters In The History Of New Testament Textual Criticism[2] estimated the textual accuracy of the New Testament to be 99.5%. They say:\n\nBy comparison with the New Testament, most other books from the ancient world are not nearly so well authenticated. The well-known New Testament scholar Bruce Metzger estimated that the Mahabharata of Hinduism is copied with only about 90 percent accuracy and Homer's Iliad with about 95 percent. By comparison, he estimated the New Testament is about 99.5 percent accurate. So the New Testament text can be reconstructed with over 99 percent accuracy. And, what is more, 100 percent of the message of the New Testament has been preserved in its manuscripts![3]\n\nUsing the services of Metzger, a similar statement is repeated almost verbatim by Geisler in his Baker Encyclopedia Of Christian Apologetics.\n\nMost other ancient books are not nearly so well authenticated. New Testament scholar Bruce Metzger estimated that the Mahabharata of Hinduism is copied with only about 90 percent accuracy and Homer's Iliad with about 95 percent. By comparison, he estimated the New Testament is about 99.5 percent accurate.[4]\n\nUsing the abundance of New Testament manuscripts to prove their reliability is almost universal in the Christian apologetical literature.[5] As for the internet, there is no dearth of such claims. For example, it has been claimed by the Christian missionary Jochen Katz that:\n\nAnd I believe that with the basis of many thousands of manuscripts for comparison we can be very confident that the text is today faithfully restored and the researchers in textual criticism assert that the actual literal text is restored to 99.8% leaving only a very few uncertainties.\n\nLet us now examine the claims of these Christian apologists starting with the works of Geisler. Geisler has claimed that Metzger in his book Chapters In The History Of New Testament Textual Criticism estimated the New Testament to be 99.5% accurate as opposed to the 95% accuracy of Homer's Iliad and the 90% accuracy of the Mahabharata. The relevant article mentioned in this book is \"Recent Trends In The Textual Criticism Of The Iliad And The Mahabharata\".\n\nSomeone who is reasonably well-acquainted with the scholarship of Metzger would immediately like to check how he arrived at such a fantastic accuracy. Our suspicions were aroused when we noticed that Geisler quotes Metzger's book claiming that he estimated the New Testament text to be 99.5% accurate without mentioning any particular page numbers. What now becomes unbelievable is that nowhere in this article does Metzger estimate the New Testament accuracy to be 99.5%. As expected, there is no mention of the New Testament having 20,000 lines of which only 40 lines are in doubt. Therefore, it is purely an invention of Geisler which he put in the mouth of Metzger. Metzger's article - on the other hand - is about how the trends in the textual criticism from the Iliad and the Mahabharata would benefit the New Testament studies in evaluating the text-types. With Geisler's fraudulent claims now exposed, let us now move over to the issue of 'numerical supremacy' and how this allegedly authenticates the reliability of the New Testament.\n\nTable I gives a listing of the New Testament manuscripts for various years.\n\nManuscript Type\n\nYear\n\n1962\n\n1980\n\n1989\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\nPapyri\n\n76 86 96 116 118 Uncials 297 274 299 310 317 Minuscules 2674 2795 2812 2877 2877 Lectionaries 1997 2209 2281 2432 2433\n\nTotal\n\n5044\n\n5364\n\n5488\n\n5735\n\n5745\n\nTable I: Number of New Testament manuscripts as listed for various years.[6]\n\nThe Greek New Testaments used by the Christians are based on these \"eclectic\" editions which aim for the earliest attainable form of the Hebrew and Greek texts that can be discerned on the basis of the surviving manuscript evidence. Are these eclectic editions based on the numerical superiority of the manuscript evidence or are they based on the quality of available New Testament witnesses (utilising factors such as age, text-type, geographical distribution, etc.)?\n\nThe New Testament manuscripts are classified as Alexandrian (\"Neutral\" or \"Egyptian\"), Western, Caesarean and Byzantine (\"Majority\" or \"Syrian\") according to their text-form. With regard to the Greek New Testament manuscripts that are available, some 80% to 90% represent the Byzantine or the \"Majority\" text.[7] The Byzantine text-type, almost universally considered to be the worst text-type in relation to preserving the \"earliest attainable text\" of the New Testament, is characterised by smoothing, conflation, harmonisation and outright fabrication.[8] Therefore, using the numerical superiority of the New Testament manuscripts means acknowledging that a very large proportion of the witnesses are of the worst kind. No Christian apologist would dare to tread this line as it would destroy the very fundamental basis of his argument.\n\nIt is ironic that the advocates of the \"Majority\" text use its (numerically) superior number of manuscripts to defend the Byzantine text. It is not our wish to enter into this much-discredited line of anti-intellectual fundamentalism by the purveyors of the \"Majority\" text;[9] but it is worthwhile pointing out that the Christians offering an apology for textual accuracy and reliability of the New Testament and the defenders of the \"Majority\" text use numerical superiority as one of the fundamental principles to defend their points of view, albeit for different reasons.\n\nTheoretically, in accordance with the genealogical principle, number means nothing. It is no wonder that Hort, and many textual critics since, have rejected this \"Majority\" or the Byzantine text in favour of the Alexandrian text type, even although the Byzantine text-type is 'numerically superior' representing between 80% to 90% of the available manuscripts. In fact, it is not surprising that Metzger mentions the importance of genealogical principle in his interview with Lee Strobel.[10] As Colwell observed:\n\nSuppose that there are only ten copies of a document and that nine are all copied from one; then the majority can be safely rejected. Or suppose that the nine are copied from a lost manuscript and that this lost manuscript and the other one were both copied from the original; then the vote of the majority would not outweigh that of minority.... a majority of manuscripts is not necessarily to be preferred as correct.[11]\n\nIt was by means of this a priori possibility that Westcott and Hort rejected the argument based on the numerical superiority of the Byzantine text. An old maxim about textual criticism is that manuscripts are weighed not counted.[12] It means, as we have seen, that not every manuscript or version is of equal value and that ten copies of a bad manuscript do not make it original. Universal suffrage has no place in textual criticism. That the textual critics have chosen only a selected few manuscripts rather than appealing to numerical superiority for preparing the critical editions of the Greek New Testament is rather well known. Table II depicts the number of manuscripts used in the preparation of the eight critical editions of the Greek New Testament.\n\nTable II: Number of New Testament manuscripts used in the editions of the Greek New Testament. Nestle-Aland 26 = Novum Testamentum Graece (Stuttgart, 1979); Bover-O'Callaghan = Nuevo Testamento Trilingüe (Madrid, 1977); UBS GNT-3 = The Greek New Testament (United Bible Societies, 1975); Metzger's = A Textual Commentary On The Greek New Testament (United Bible Societies, 1971); Merk = Novum Testamentum Graece et Latine (Rome, 9th Edition, 1964); Vogels = Novum Testamentum Graece et Latine (Freiburg and Barcelona, 4th Edition, 1955); BFBS-2 = H KAINH DIAqHKH (British and Foreign Bible Society, 2nd Edition, 1958); Souter = Novum Testamentum Graece (Oxford, 2nd Edition, 1947). Number of manuscripts used to compute the percentage = 5000.[13]\n\nThe percentages were calculated by assuming 5000 New Testament manuscripts. What is seen is that the maximum number of manuscripts that were used were in the preparation of the UBS' Greek New Testament (3rd Edition), i.e., about 18%. The Nestle Aland's Novum Testamentum Graece (26th Edition) uses just about 10% of the available manuscripts. This is consistent with the fact that the superiority of the early text-type in the New Testament manuscripts outweighs the numerical superiority of manuscripts. Moreover, the percentage of manuscripts (between 10% and 18%) used in the preparation of modern critical texts of the New Testament closely tallies with the rejection of the \"Majority\" or the Byzantine text-type that constitutes between 80% to 90% of the available manuscripts. Furthermore, we should add that no matter how many manuscripts the evangelicals and the apologists claim to have for their scripture, it is of little or no use as long as the manuscript tradition of the New Testament is non-uniform down to a sentence. No two manuscripts of the New Testament anywhere in existence are alike.[14] Perhaps it is simplest to express the figure in comparative terms: there are more differences among the manuscripts than there are words in the New Testament.[15]\n\nTextual critics have cautioned against the wrong impression given by the numerical superiority of the Greek New Testament manuscripts. For example, Metzger says:\n\nLest, however, the wrong impression be conveyed from the statistics given above regarding the total number of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, it should be pointed out that most of the papyri are relatively fragmentary and that only about fifty manuscripts (of which the Codex Sinaiticus is the only Uncial manuscript) contain the entire New Testament.[16]\n\nEhrman reminds the reader that the reasoning behind using the numerical superiority of the manuscripts is faulty. This is because the earliest manuscripts are not only fragmentary, but also because most are centuries removed from the originals; none of these manuscripts being error-free.\n\nAt one time or another, you may have heard someone claim that the New Testament can be trusted because it is the best attested book from the ancient world, that because there are more manuscripts of the New Testament than of any other book, we should have no doubt concerning the truth of its message. Given what we have seen..., it should be clear why this line of reasoning is faulty. It is true, of course, that the New Testament is abundantly attested in the manuscripts produced through the ages, but most of these manuscripts are many centuries removed from the originals, and none of them perfectly accurate. They all contain mistakes - altogether many thousands of mistakes. It is not an easy task to reconstruct the original words of the New Testament.\n\nMoreover even if scholars have by and large succeeded in reconstructing the New Testament, this, in itself, has no bearing on the truthfulness of the message. It simply means that we can be reasonably certain of what the New Testament authors actually said, just as we can be reasonably certain what Plato and Euripides and Josephus and Suetonius all said. Whether or not any of these ancient authors said anything that was true is another question, one we cannot answer simply by appealing to the number of surviving manuscripts that preserve their writings.[17]\n\nAs for the abundance of New Testament manuscripts as opposed to the works of Homer, Euripides and Tacitus, this is something that is to be expected when Christianity grew and occupied the greater part of Europe, parts of North Africa and the Middle East. Obviously its religious needs also grew which resulted in the production of more manuscripts than the works of Homer, Euripides and Tacitus. Ehrman again points out:\n\n... the New Testament is preserved in far more manuscripts than any other book from antiquity. There are for example, fewer than 700 copies of Homer's Iliad, fewer than 350 copies of the plays of Euripides, and only one copy of the first six books of the Annals of Tacitus... Of course, we would expect the New Testament to be copied in the Middle Ages more frequently than Homer or Euripides or Tacitus; the trained copyists throughout the Western world at the time were Christian scribes, frequently monks, who for the most part were preparing copies of texts for religious purposes. Still, the fact that we have thousands of New Testament manuscripts that were made during the Middle Ages, many of them nearly a thousand years after Paul and his companions had passed off the face of the earth, does not mean that we can rest assured that we know what the original text said. For if we have very few early copies, in fact, scarcely any, how can we know that the text was not changed significantly before it began to be reproduced in such large quantities?[18]\n\nPerhaps a brash dictum from G. A. Wells in this regard makes sense of the whole situation. He says:\n\nI have noted elsewhere that, if there had been a Tacitus club in every European town for 1,000 or more years with as much influence as the local Christian clergy, sections of the Annals would not have been lost. And if, instead of copying orthodox literature repeatedly, Christian scribes had copied works regarded as heretical or even downright hostile to Christianity, we should have a much clearer picture of what underlay the church's struggle against opposing forces.[19]\n\nWe can conclude this section by saying that it is not the numerical superiority of the manuscripts that matters for numbers mean nothing. What matters is the quality of the manuscripts, their age, text-type, etc. Most contemporary New Testament textual scholars contend that a minority of manuscripts - primarily the earliest ones - preserve the earliest, most authentic wording of the text.[20] This is also reflected in the number of manuscripts used in the modern day critical editions. If numerical superiority was indeed what matters most for authenticity then the advocates of the \"Majority\" text would have won their case hands down.\n\nPATRISTIC CITATIONS CAN RECONSTRUCT THE ENTIRE NEW TESTAMENT\n\nThe claims that the numerical strength of the New Testament manuscripts give it textual reliability and that the Patristic citations can reconstruct the New Testament makes good sound-bites for Christian apologists. As for the latter claim, this is something that is oversold by Christian apologists. It is true that New Testament scholars and apologists have made this claim but a few of them have added caveat about the problems concerning constructing the text of Patristic citations. For example, Metzger says about the Patristic citations:\n\nIndeed so extensive are these citations that if all the sources for our knowledge of the text of the New Testament were destroyed, they would be sufficient alone for the reconstruction of practically the entire New Testament.[21]\n\nIf this is indeed true then what is stopping the textual critics to go ahead and reconstruct the text of the New Testament on the basis of Patristic citations? This brings us to the caveat where Metzger and others have cautioned against over-enthusiasm. The caveat comes in the form of three problems one encounters when dealing with the Patristic citations.\n\nThe first problem in dealing with the Patristic citations is the order of the quotation of scriptures. The Fathers do not quote the New Testament chapter by chapter and verse by verse except in a few commentaries. They quote passages as they are useful in whatever argument they are making. So, the first step is to sort out their citations into an orderly fashion. This requires the production of critical texts of the citations which are now slowly in the process of getting published.[22]\n\nThe second problem is regarding the accuracy of the citation. Most fathers did not refer to manuscripts when they quoted scripture. They just used the wording they remembered. It goes without saying that reminiscences and allusions are of less value to the textual critic than specific citations of the very words of the scriptural passage.[23]\n\nThe third and the last problem is that of transmission. Just like we do not have the original autographs of the New Testaments, we no more have the original manuscript of Irenaeus, Clement, Tertullian or Jerome. Ehrman says:\n\nThe other set of problems unique to Patristic sources concerns the history of their own transmission. The MS traditions of virtually all the church fathers show that later copyists tend to \"correct\" quotations of the Bible to the form of text prevalent in their own day... Biblical citations in such sources do not necessarily represent the text of the Father, but often only known to his later copyists.[24]\n\nSimilarly, the Alands observe that:\n\nIt is as true of the New Testament quotations in the Church Fathers as it is of the versions that they are often misjudged and consequently misused. The route from a modern edition of a Church Father's works back to the text which he read in his New Testament may be long and tortuous... But even when a modern critical edition is available there is no certainty that it preserves the New Testament quotations of a work as they occurred in its original form.[25]\n\nSince these writings have their own history, before we can treat these citations as reliable and trustworthy, they must be subjected to textual criticism. As R. M. Grant a few decades ago said, \"patristic citations are not citations unless they have been adequately analyzed.\"[26] Such an analysis should attempt at least two things; firstly, to gather all the data from the literary remains of each Father and, as much as possible, reconstruct his biblical text and secondly to evaluate the Father's citing habits in various kinds of works for accuracy of quotation. And this should be done before the evidence of the Father is brought to court.[27]\n\nGiven these problems, the Patristic citations are nevertheless quite useful, unlike manuscripts, in determining both where and when a particular author wrote. Many of the Fathers are early. Their texts predate many of the early manuscript witnesses. Thus their testimony can enable us to localize particular readings and text-types.\n\nAs one can now judge, the popular statement that the New Testament can be reconstructed solely from the citations of the early Church Fathers is rather far-fetched. Given these problems, what role do the Church Fathers' citations actually play in modern critical editions of the New Testament? They play no more than a 'supplementary and corroborative function' according to the Alands and others. The Alands say:\n\n5. The primary authority for a critical textual decision lies with the Greek manuscript tradition, with the versions and Fathers serving no more than a supplementary and corroborative function, particularly in passages where their underlying Greek text cannot be reconstructed with absolute certainty.[28]\n\nIn other words, the Patristic citations can't overrule the readings present in the manuscripts except where there is an uncertainty. Readings with exclusively Patristic support struggle to make it into the critical apparatus of a critical edition of the Greek New Testament, let alone ever being considered as an actual verse of the New Testament! So, the claim that the Patristic citations can completely reconstruct the New Testament, without reference or recall to any other form of evidence, is overstated and far-fetched and constitutes more wishful thinking on the part of the missionaries and apologists.\n\nFor instance, let us examine the selection procedure behind the recently released Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior (1997  initial volume), a critical edition of the New Testament under the supervision of the Barbara Aland at the Institut für Neutestamentliche Textforschung at Münster, Germany. What makes this critical edition of the New Testament particularly distinctive are the comparatively vast number of witnesses cited. With regard to the Patristic quotations, Barbara Aland states:\n\nIn addition to these primary witnesses, the edition includes all the Greek patristic quotations to the time of John of Damascus (7th/8th century) plus some important later authors. The difficult task of distinguishing between quotations and allusions is somewhat alleviated by the fact that the edition contains all the textual variants found in the manuscript tradition of the first millennium. The text of the Letter of James preserved in the writings of the Fathers corresponds in most instances to variants known in the manuscript tradition; in other New Testament writings the situation may differ. Readings with exclusively patristic support are cited only rarely, and usually then only if they are attributed to manuscripts which no longer survive. (Allusions have been considered only if they clearly reflect a known reading).\n\nAttempts have been made in the past to reconstruct parts of New Testament text using the Patristic citations. For example, D. Mollat used the views and the resultant reconstruction of the Gospel of John by of M. -E. Boismard for his translation in the Jerusalem Bible. Boismard's views lead to the acceptance of the shorter version of the text of John in almost every case, even when the Patristic sources stand alone in the attestation of this text. Subsequently, articles by Fee and Metzger have been directed against Mollat's overly zealous appropriation of the Patristic evidence for his translation.[29]\n\nWe conclude with Ehrman's terse statement that elegantly sums up both the strengths and weaknesses of patristic evidence.\n\nPatristic sources provide primary evidence for the history of the text but only secondary evidence for the original text itself.[30]\n\nAH! THOSE FANTASTIC PERCENTAGES\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Christian apologetical literature is an assignment of accuracy to the New Testament in the form of percentages. These percentages are almost always guesses and quoted from scholarship that is more than a century old. Geisler quotes Schaff, Warfield, Westcott and Hort and Robertson to \"show\" that the thousands of textual variants do not really matter.[31] According to Philip Schaff (in 1883):\n\nOnly about 400 of the 100,000 or 150,000 variations materially affect the sense. Of these, again, not more than about fifty are really important for some reason or other; and even of these fifty not one affects an article of faith...[32]\n\nWestcott and Hort (in 1885), on the other hand, guess that:\n\nIf comparative trivialities, such as changes of order, the insertion or omission of the article with proper names, and the like, are set aside, the words in our opinion still subject to doubt can hardly amount to more than a thousandth part of the whole New Testament.[33]\n\nRev. Benjamin Warfield (in 1886), mentioning the Unitarian Ezra Abbot, says concerning the variant readings:\n\nDr. Ezra Abbot was accustomed to say that about nineteen-twentieths of them have so little support that, although they are various readings, no one would think of them as rival readings; and nineteen-twentieths of the remainder are of so little importance that their adoption or rejection would cause no appreciable difference in the sense of the passages where they occur.[34]\n\nArchibald Robertson (in 1929) estimated that:\n\nThe real conflict in the textual criticism of the New Testament is concerning this \"thousandth part of the entire text.\"[35]\n\nWestcott and Hort's services once again come to the fore as the apologist Doug Smith seeks to put a precise figure on the number of errors in the entire New Testament, even down to the specific number of errors in the Gospel(s). We are told:\n\nWestcott and Hort showed in 1881 that most of the \"errors\" in the Gospel were nothing more than misspellings or variants; only 60 legitimate, and of those 60, only 7 were found to be \"primitive errors.\" This means that the Gospels would be 98.33 percent pure.[36]\n\nWe are informed that most of the \"errors\" in the Gospel are nothing more than misspellings and variants; only sixty are \"legitimate\" and of those, \"only seven\" are found to be \"primitive errors\". Examining the references used to provide the numbers quoted by the apologist, leads back to William Campbell and his book The Qur'an And The Bible In The Light Of History & Science; immediately we can observe that Campbell seeks to add legitimacy to his exposition by appealing to Metzger, stating that he,\n\n... has written the textbook called The Text of the New Testament, from which much of this chapter is adapted,...\n\nIf this is indeed the case then it is prudent to ask did Metzger say anywhere in his book The Text Of The New Testament that there are only \"60 legitimate\" errors in the Gospel(s). No. Did Metzger say anywhere only \"7 were found to be \"primitive errors\"?\" No. So we can understand that this part of Doug Smith's analysis has certainly not been adapted from Metzger's The Text Of The New Testament. A quick comparison of the apologist's quote and the statements of Campbell, shows the apologist was unable to even quote Campbell properly. Campbell says (quoting Metzger, who, in turn, is discussing specific methodological considerations of Westcott and Hort),\n\nabout sixty passages (only seven of which are from the four Gospels) which they (or one of them) suspected involved a 'primitive error'.\n\nIt is clear that the apologist Doug Smith is mistaken when he states that \"and of those 60, only 7 were found to be \"primitive errors\"\". All 60 passages were found to be primitive errors, not \"only 7\". Now that we have established the incorrect figures contained in the apologist's quote, and Campbell, in this particular instance, not adapting his conclusions from what Metzger himself said in The Text Of The New Testament, let us examine what is meant by a 'primitive error' according to Westcott and Hort in their Introduction To The New Testament In The Original Greek, and, whether the subsequent analysis by the apologist in which he states, \"This means that the Gospels would be 98.33 percent pure\" is correct, either on methodological or mathematical grounds. Turning to Section VI. Criticism As Dealing With Errors Antecedent To Existing Texts, in the very first paragraph relating to primitive errors, Westcott and Hort say,\n\nThe preceding pages have dealt exclusively with the task of discriminating between existing various readings, one variant in each case being adopted and the rest discarded. The utmost result that can be obtained under this condition is the discovery of what is relatively original: whether the readings thus relatively original were also the readings of the autograph is another question, which can never be answered in the affirmative with absolute decision except where the autograph itself is extant, but which admits of approximative answers varying enormously in certainty according to the nature of the documentary evidence for the text generally...[37]\n\nPrimitive errors are thus a specific category of error according to Westcott and Hort's reconstructive methodology - as the section title indicates \"... errors antecedent to existing texts\". What Metzger does do in The Text Of The New Testament is to list the sixty-three passages suspected by Westcott and Hort to contain primitive errors,[38] of which seven relate to the Gospels, and discuss how this relates to the use of conjectural emendation which Metzger describes as,\n\nIf the only reading, or each of several variant readings, which the documents of a text supply is impossible or incomprehensible, the editor's only remaining resource is to conjecture what the original reading must have been.[39]\n\nWhat we can understand from this is that Westcott and Hort's categorisation of primitive errors relates to their practice of conjectural emendation and has absolutely nothing at all to do with the total number of errors in the Gospels, or anywhere else. Thus, nowhere do Westcott and Hort say there are only 60 \"legitimate errors\" in the Gospel(s) or that, \"and of those 60, only 7 were found to be \"primitive errors\"\". The apologist Doug Smith, misquoting another missionary William Campbell, has inserted his own words into the mouths of Westcott and Hort's in order to make his argument sound more credible. Quite how one is able to conclude, \"This means that the Gospels would be 98.33 percent pure\" when the basic analysis is not even correct is one thing; how, mathematically, this figure was arrived at is quite another.\n\nIn another category are speculative estimates from the modern day missionaries that seem to emanate from their own creative imagination which cannot be traced to any reliable biblical scholarship. On occasion, these claims also have the attribute of contradicting elementary school mathematics. On Friday 8th May, 1998 at Leicester University, United Kingdom, in his debate with Shabbir Ally, the Christian missionary Joseph Smith said [his statement is at time slice 1:54:14-1:54:32]:\n\nThere are really only 40 verses that are in doubt in the New Testament, it only comes up to around 40 verses; that means that 99.9% of the New Testament is been verified, has been clarified, using manuscript evidence.\n\nFirst of all, at the most basic level, the missionaries own mathematics do not add up. There are 7,947 verses in the New Testament (Table III). If 40 verses are in doubt then the percentage of the New Testament that is \"verified\" comes to: [100-40/7947*100] = 99.5%. In fact for the missionary's mathematics to be correct, we would have to inflate the number of verses of the New Testament from 7,947 to nearly 40,000. Moreover, the inaccuracy of the missionary's claim can be fully understood when we realise that the missionary has underestimated the number doubtful verses in his version of the Bible by more than 3000%. Taking the Greek text that is used to construct the NIV version of the Bible (UBS GNT-3corr) as a baseline, the number of doubtful verses according to the biblical textual critics are 1,318.\n\nThe reader can see that the percentage of accuracy can fall anywhere between 95% and 99.9% depending upon who is quoted and/or the ability (or lack thereof) to compute simple mathematical calculations. As for Geisler's use of Bruce Metzger, we have already seen that Metzger never estimated in the quoted reference that the New Testament is 99.5% accurate. Geisler put his own words into the mouth of Metzger to make the whole argument look more credible. What is most surprising is that apologists like Geisler, in almost all cases, use scholarship that is more than 100 years old to get amazing percentages of accuracies. It appears that for these apologists, textual criticism had stopped after Westcott and Hort. When Westcott and Hort developed their theory of textual criticism, only one papyrus manuscript was known to them. Since that time more than 100 papyri have been discovered. More than fifty of these came from before the middle of the fourth century.[40] Westcott and Hort, on the other hand, relied quite heavily on Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus (both from 4th century) and used them as their text base. The discovery of such early papyri, albeit that all of them are quite fragmented, has moved the textual criticism of the New Testament. That the \"Word of God\" in the form of Nestle-Aland's Novum Testamentum Graece is running in its 27th edition is an ample evidence of how far the science of textual criticism has moved since the times of Westcott and Hort (and others!). We will look at Nestle-Aland's Novum Testamentum Graece in a moment but first let us see what some of the modern authors are saying about the accuracy of the New Testament.\n\nWe have Moir (in 1995) who gives an estimate of the accuracy of the New Testament. He says:\n\nMost modern textual critics can agree on the bulk of the text of (some 95 per cent of it, perhaps). It is the remaining 5 per cent or so where disputes occur and differing conclusions may be found.[41]\n\nRalph Earle (in 1991) writing in \"The Rational For An Eclectic New Testament Text\" in The NIV: The Making Of A Contemporary Translation says:\n\n... with thousands of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament at our disposal, we can reach a higher degree of certainty with regard to the probability of the best text. It should be added that comparative statistical studies indicate that all Greek manuscripts are in essential agreement on at least 95 percent of the New Testament text. Significant differences exist, then, in less than 5 percent of the total text. And it must be said emphatically that none of these variant readings pose any problem as to basic doctrines of the Bible. They are intact! We should like to add that all the members of the Committee on the Bible translation are devout Evangelicals, believing in the infallibility of the Bible as God's Word. We have all sought earnestly to represent as accurately as possible what seems to be, as nearly as we can determine, the original text of the New Testament.[42]\n\nApart from a leap in the logic of almost equating the \"best\" text with the elusive and non-existent \"original\" text, Earle claims that all Greek manuscripts are in essential agreement on at least 95% of the New Testament text. It does not take a seasoned papyrologist to figure out that only a few Greek manuscripts contain the entire New Testament text! Only about 8% of the manuscripts cover most of the New Testament.[43] The vast majority of the manuscripts contain only a portion of the New Testament text or exist in fragmentary form.\n\nThe common thread which binds the older and the modern scholars is their use of guesstimate. Everyone has a fraction or a percentage to quote but none of them have ever done a proper calculation. The modern day textual critics, on the other hand, give a completely different picture of the accuracy of the New Testament. Kurt Aland and Barbara Aland in their book The Text Of The New Testament present a table which compares the total number of variant free verses in Nestle-Aland edition with the other critical editions such as that of Tischendorf, Westcott-Hort, von Soden, Vogels, Merk, and Bover. This comparison does not take into account the orthographical differences in the variant free verses. The table below:\n\n...gives the count of the verses in which there is complete agreement among the six editions of Tischendorf, Westcott-Hort, von Soden, Vogels, Merk, and Bover with the text of Nestle-Aland (apart from orthographical differences).[44]\n\nBook\n\nTotal Number Of Verses\n\nVariant Free Verses-Total\n\nPercentage\n\nMatthew\n\n1071\n\n642\n\n59.9 %\n\nMark\n\n678\n\n306\n\n45.1 %\n\nLuke\n\n1151\n\n658\n\n57.2 %\n\nJohn\n\n869\n\n450\n\n51.8 %\n\nActs\n\n1006\n\n677\n\n67.3 %\n\nRomans\n\n433\n\n327\n\n75.5 %\n\n1 Corinthians\n\n437\n\n331\n\n75.7 %\n\n2 Corinthians\n\n256\n\n200\n\n78.1 %\n\nGalatians\n\n149\n\n114\n\n76.5 %\n\nEphesians\n\n155\n\n118\n\n76.1 %\n\nPhilippians\n\n104\n\n73\n\n70.2 %\n\nColossians\n\n95\n\n69\n\n72.6 %\n\n1 Thessalonians\n\n89\n\n61\n\n68.5 %\n\n2 Thessalonians\n\n47\n\n34\n\n72.3 %\n\n1 Timothy\n\n113\n\n92\n\n81.4 %\n\n2 Timothy\n\n83\n\n66\n\n79.5 %\n\nTitus\n\n46\n\n33\n\n71.7 %\n\nPhilemon\n\n25\n\n19\n\n76.0 %\n\nHebrews\n\n303\n\n234\n\n77.2 %\n\nJames\n\n108\n\n66\n\n61.1 %\n\n1 Peter\n\n105\n\n70\n\n66.6 %\n\n2 Peter\n\n61\n\n32\n\n52.5 %\n\n1 John\n\n105\n\n76\n\n72.4 %\n\n2 John\n\n13\n\n8\n\n61.5 %\n\n3 John\n\n15\n\n11\n\n73.3 %\n\nJude\n\n25\n\n18\n\n72.0 %\n\nRevelation\n\n405\n\n214\n\n52.8 %\n\nTotal\n\n7947\n\n4999\n\n62.9 %\n\nTable III: Table showing the total number of variant free verses in the books of the New Testament when Nestle-Aland edition is compared with the other critical editions such as that of Tischendorf, Westcott-Hort, von Soden, Vogels, Merk, and Bover.\n\nIt is seen that nearly two-thirds of New Testament text in the seven editions of the Greek New Testament reviewed by Aland and Aland is in agreement with no differences other than in orthographic details. Further, verses in which any one of the seven editions differs by a single word are not counted.[45]\n\nComparing the above-named seven major critical editions, from Tischendorf to Nestle-Aland26, we can observe an agreement in wording of only 62.9% of the verses of the New Testament. The proportion ranges from 45.1% in Mark to 81.4% in 2 Timothy. Let us take a statistical examination of the four Gospels. The table below gives the agreement of the verses in the four Gospels taken from the above.\n\nBook\n\nTotal Number Of Verses\n\nVariant Free Verses-Total\n\nPercentage\n\nMatthew\n\n1071\n\n642\n\n59.9 %\n\nMark\n\n678\n\n306\n\n45.1 %\n\nLuke\n\n1151\n\n658\n\n57.2 %\n\nJohn\n\n869\n\n450\n\n51.8 %\n\nTotal\n\n3769\n\n2056\n\n54.5 %\n\nTable IV: Table showing the total number of variant free verses in the four Gospels when Nestle-Aland edition is compared with the other critical editions such as that of Tischendorf, Westcott-Hort, von Soden, Vogels, Merk, and Bover.\n\nThe percentage agreement of the verses when all the four Gospels are considered is 54.5%. This is very close to the probability that a tail (or head) appears when a coin is tossed once (i.e., the probability that a tail or head appears when a coin is tossed is 50%!). It is still a mystery to us from where exactly the evangelicals pick-up such fantastic \"agreements\" between the Greek manuscripts of the New Testament.\n\nIf we look at the textual \"certainty\" of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament, the results are not too encouraging either. This edition is used in the translations and is similar to the Nestle-Aland's critical edition except that it has more details on the textual variants and their relative degree of certainty.[46] The committee of textual critics has sought to indicate the relative degree of certainty by means of the letters A, B, C, and D, enclosed within \"braces\" { } at the beginning of each set of textual variants. Their decisions were arrived at the basis of internal considerations as well as of external evidence. \"{A}\" signifies that the text is virtually certain, while \"{B}\" indicates that there is some degree of doubt. The letter \"{C}\" means that there is a considerable degree of doubt whether the text or the apparatus contains the superior reading, while \"{D}\" shows that there is a very high degree of doubt concerning the reading. These ratings are tabulated below for each editions of The Greek New Testament.[47]\n\nRatings / Editions\n\nUBS GNT-1\n\nUBS GNT-2\n\nUBS GNT-3\n\nUBS GNT-3corr\n\n{A} Ratings\n\n136\n\n9.4 %\n\n130\n\n8.9 %\n\n126\n\n8.7 %\n\n126\n\n8.7 %\n\n{B} Ratings\n\n486\n\n33.6 %\n\n490\n\n33.8 %\n\n475\n\n32.8 %\n\n475\n\n32.9 %\n\n{C} Ratings\n\n702\n\n48.5 %\n\n701\n\n48.4 %\n\n700\n\n48.4 %\n\n699\n\n48.4 %\n\n{D} Ratings\n\n122\n\n8.4 %\n\n125\n\n8.6 %\n\n144\n\n9.9 %\n\n144\n\n9.9 %\n\nTotal (Verses)\n\n1446\n\n1446\n\n1445\n\n1444\n\nTable V: Table showing the distribution of ratings of verses by editions of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament. The UBS GNT-1 represents the 1st edition of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament. On the other hand, the UBS GNT-3corr represents the corrected 3rd edition of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament.\n\nIf we remove the text that is virtually certain, rated as {A}, and take the percentage of the New Testament text (total verses = 7947) that is in doubt, we see that the doubtful text is close to 16.5% in all the three editions of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament. That brings textual \"certainty\" to about 83.5% as suggested by the efforts of the committee of textual critics. Again, this is way off from \"at least 95%\" agreement between the New Testament text in the manuscripts.\n\nRegarding the textual certainty of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament, the apologist Robert Turkel comments:\n\n... they are only able to punch that 95% down to a mere (!) 83.5%, with still no effort to show that any of the remaining 16.5% relates to anything we ought to care about. In other words, even of their \"16.5%\" is right, it doesn't make a heck of a lot of difference if that 16.5% is filled with things like, did Paul say \"I wish you well in the future\" versus \"I hope you had a good time at summer camp.\" Or, if it means stuff like the comma of 1 John, which we don't need because the doctrine it (supposedly) espouses is verified by a non-disputed text.\n\nAlso known as J. P. Holding, Turkel doubts that this \"... 16.5% relates to anything we ought to care about.\" If this is indeed the case then we would expect to see the same sentiment shared by the editors of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament, who are the very same people who assign the 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' grades and calculate their respective numerical totals as reported above. Discussing the history of various editions of the Greek New Testament in the modern critical period, Metzger and Ehrman state:\n\nIn 1966, after a decade of work by an international committee, five bible societies published an edition of the Greek New Testament designed for the use of Bible translators and students. The textual apparatus, which provided a relatively full citation of manuscript evidence, included about 1,440 sets of variant readings, chosen especially for their exegetical significance... Meanwhile, plans had already been made for the fourth edition of the United Bible Societies Greek New Testament. In 1981, at a meeting of the five members of the editorial committee (the places left vacant by the retirement of Matthew Black and Allen Wikgren were filled by Barbara Aland and John Karavidopoulos of Salonica), decisions were made to introduce into the apparatus 284 additional sets of variant readings for passages of exegetical importance. Furthermore, though no change was voted to alter the wording of the scriptural text, it was agreed that in some cases a modification needed to be made in the assignment of the categories of A, B, C and D relating to the certainty of readings adopted in the text...[48]\n\nPut simply, do Bruce Metzger, Kurt Aland, Allen Wikgren, Matthew Black, Arthur Vööbus, Carlo Maria Martini, Barbara Aland and John Karavidopoulos, all on the international editorial committee as official editors on successive editions of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament, think that this \"... 16.5% relates to anything we ought to care about\"? Examining the principles laid out by the above textual critics, contrary to the proclamation of the apologist, the answer is evidently yes.\n\nBUT THE GREEK MANUSCRIPTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT ARE VERY OLD!\n\nPerhaps the most quoted material in this regard by Christian apologists is that of Sir Frederic Kenyon. The following quote from his book is used to show that the manuscripts of the Greek New Testament are indeed very close to the time when they written. According to Kenyon:\n\nThe interval between the dates of the original composition and the earliest extant evidence becomes so small as to be negligible, and the last foundation for any doubt that the scriptures have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed. Both the authenticity and general integrity of the books of the New Testament may be regarded as finally established.[49]\n\nIn other words, what Kenyon is claiming is that the dates of the \"original\" composition and the earliest extant evidence is very small; so small that it is negligible. This, in turn, establishes the authenticity and general integrity of the New Testament. This hypothesis can be tested by simply going through the book by Kurt and Barbara Aland which lists all kinds of available manuscript evidence for various books of the New Testament.[50] We have tabulated the earliest available manuscript for the books of the New Testament in the Table VI below.\n\nBook\n\nEarliest Manuscript\n\nDate (CE)\n\nCondition\n\nMatthew\n\nP64, P67, P104\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\nMark\n\nP45\n\n3rd century\n\nLarge Fragments\n\nLuke\n\nP4\n\nc. 200\n\nFragment\n\nJohn\n\nP52\n\nc. 125-150\n\nFragment\n\nActs\n\nP38\n\n3rd century\n\nFragment\n\nRomans\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\n1 Corinthians\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\n2 Corinthians\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\nGalatians\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\nEphesians\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\nPhilippians\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\nColossians\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\n1 Thessalonians\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\n2 Thessalonians\n\nP92\n\n3rd / 4th century\n\nFragment\n\n1 Timothy\n\n4th century\n\nComplete\n\n2 Timothy\n\n4th century\n\nComplete\n\nTitus\n\nP32\n\nc. 200\n\nFragment\n\nPhilemon\n\nP87\n\n3rd century\n\nFragment\n\nHebrews\n\nP46\n\nc. 200\n\nFragments\n\nJames\n\nP23, P20\n\n3rd century\n\nFragment\n\n1 Peter\n\nP72\n\n3rd / 4th century\n\nFragments\n\n2 Peter\n\nP72\n\n3rd / 4th century\n\nFragments\n\n1 John\n\nP9\n\n3rd century\n\nFragment\n\n2 John\n\n0232\n\n3rd / 4th century\n\nFragment\n\n3 John\n\n4th century\n\nComplete\n\nJude\n\nP72\n\n3rd / 4th century\n\nFragments\n\nRevelation\n\nP98\n\n2nd century\n\nFragment\n\nTable VI: A complete listing of the first appearance of New Testament books in manuscripts, along with their condition and dates.\n\nA quick glance at the data shows that the Gospel of John has the earliest manuscript evidence (P52, c. 125-150 CE) whereas the books 1,2 Timothy and 3 John have very late manuscript witnesses ( , 4th century CE). Most of the earliest manuscript witnesses of the books of the New Testament are quite fragmentary, at times containing no more than a couple of verses or even less. The majority of the manuscripts date between 200-300 CE. Given the data, it is hard to imagine how the dates of the \"original\" composition and the earliest extant evidence are so small as to be negligible.\n\nNow let us turn our attention to the entire lot of Greek New Testament manuscripts and see how ancient these manuscripts really are, and contrast these findings to the fantastic claims made by the missionaries and apologists about their \"ancientness\". By collating the number of New Testament text manuscripts and New Testament lectionaries by century, we can observe the abundance of Greek New Testament manuscripts increasing with time. Table VII gives the distribution of Greek New Testament manuscripts by century (as of May 1988).[51]\n\nCentury New Testament Manuscripts Lectionaries Cumulative Total Cumulative Percent Papyri Uncials Minuscules Uncials Minuscules 2nd 2 - - - - 2 0.03 % c. 200 4 - - - - 6 0.11 % 2nd / 3rd 1 1 - - - 8 0.15 % 3rd 28 2 - - - 38 0.73 % 3rd / 4th 8 2 - - - 48 0.92 % 4th 14 14 - 1 - 77 1.48 % 4th / 5th 8 8 - - - 93 1.78 % 5th 2 36 - 1 - 132 2.5 % 5th / 6th 4 10 - - - 146 2.8 % 6th 7 51 - 3 - 207 3.98 % 6th / 7th 5 5 - 1 - 218 4.19 % 7th 8 28 - 4 - 258 4.96 % 7th / 8th 3 4 - - - 265 5.09 % 8th 2 29 - 22 - 318 6.11 % 8th / 9th - 4 - 5 - 327 6.29 % 9th - 53 13 113 5 511 9.83 % 9th / 10th - 1 4 - 1 517 9.94 % 10th - 17 124 108 38 804 15.47 % 10th / 11th - 3 8 3 4 822 15.81 % 11th - 1 429 15 227 1494 28.74 % 11th / 12th - - 33 - 13 1540 29.63 % 12th - - 555 6 486 2587 49.77 % 12th / 13th - - 26 - 17 2630 50.60 % 13th - - 547 4 394 3575 68.78 % 13th / 14th - - 28 - 17 3620 69.65 % 14th - - 511 - 308 4439 85.41 % 14th / 15th - - 8 - 2 4449 85.60 % 15th - - 241 - 171 4861 93.53 % 15th / 16th - - 4 - 2 4867 93.65 % 16th - - 136 - 194 5197 100 % Total 96 269 2667 286 1879 5197\n\nTable VII: Distribution of Greek New Testament manuscripts by century (as of May 1988). The Alands give a slightly different number of manuscripts when compared with those of Metzger. The difference could be due to the total number of catalogued manuscripts and the actual number of surviving manuscripts; the latter is usually somewhat less. The total number of manuscripts as of 2005 are 5745, however, many of the newer additions are again very late. The change to the cumulative percentage for the manuscripts would be less than half a percent in certain cases.\n\nWe find the total number of Greek manuscripts from before the 9th century to be 327. Some may question why it is that the 9th century has been used as a marker to delineate the turning point (numerically) for the Greek New Testament manuscripts. This can be explained by focussing on the method of writing the Greek New Testament text. Commonly termed as minuscule, this method of writing started to take a grip in the 9th century and became widespread by the 11th century, in contrast to the previous style of writing, termed majuscule, where all the Greek letters were written as capitals. Consequently, all of the New Testament minuscule manuscripts and the vast majority of lectionaries, both of which represent the overwhelming bulk of all Greek New Testament manuscripts, utilise this method of handwriting. Another important turning point for the manuscripts is the use of paper; about 1,300 Greek New Testament manuscripts are written on paper, which, started to replace vellum beginning around the 13th century.[52]\n\nFigure 2: A summary of the significant palaeographical features of the Greek New Testament manuscripts from the first century down to the age of printing.[53]\n\nTherefore, the fantastic claims found in the missionary and apologetical literature are dealt a heavy blow when we understand that slightly over 6% of the more than 5,000 Greek New Testament manuscripts hail from before the 9th century! With no shortage of claims ascribing 'ancientness' to the manuscripts, given that around 94% of the Greek manuscripts (Greek being the \"original\" language of the New Testament) can be dated in excess of 800 years or so after the birth of Jesus, shows the sheer desperation of the missionaries. It is well known amongst the textual critics that the great majority of the primary witnesses to the text of the New Testament, (i.e., Greek manuscripts) are overwhelmingly from the medieval and late medieval periods. Dr. Klaus Junack, a researcher at the Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung, Universität Münster, Germany, considered one of the leading experts connected with the UBS Greek New Testament project, stated:\n\nToday more than 5,000 manuscripts are known: the overwhelming majority of these are from the medieval and late medieval periods, but on occasion they also preserve readings from the early period.[54]\n\nLet us now examine some 'ancient' figures which are conspicuous in their absence from the mass of missionary and apologetical literature. Concentrating on the search for an \"Athanasian Codex\" (i.e., a Greek New Testament adhering to the specifications of Athanasius) we have to wait until 1116 CE (over a millennia after the birth of Jesus) before a complete, non-composite Greek New Testament with an Athanasian arrangement appears. Indeed, based on surviving manuscript evidence, Athanasius's list (as a 'table of contents') never became widespread until the 13th century, and even then, the Christians had not fixed the Athanasian sequence. In fact, the twenty-seven books that became the \"canonical\" and thus the \"complete\" Greek New Testament did not even exist in codex format until c. 800  c. 900 CE![55] To this very day there are only around fifty complete Greek codices of the New Testament in existence; this leads Metzger to conclude that, \"... it suddenly becomes clear that only a very small proportion of Christians could have owned, or even seen, a copy of the complete canon of the New Testament before the invention of printing.\"[56] A bad situation gets worse when we realise that of these fifty or so codices of the New Testament, almost half are categorised by the textual critics as being of the inferior, secondary Byzantine text-type  the poorest text-type in relation to preserving the \"earliest attainable text\" of the New Testament.[57]\n\nWith the sobering reality revealed behind the 'ancientness' of the Greek New Testament manuscripts as opposed to the claims made by the missionaries and apologists, and, the number of actual complete, non-composite Greek New Testaments in existence before the advent of the printing press, let us now turn our attention to the issues surrounding the early socio-historic context in which the scribes of the New Testament penned their texts.\n\nAs for the issue of the early manuscripts establishing the \"authenticity\" and \"general integrity\" of the New Testament, one has to look at the controversies that engulfed early Christianity and how that was reflected in the early manuscripts of the New Testament. In the earliest Christian periods, the professed followers of Jesus were engaged in intense polemics against each other. In this highly charged atmosphere, accusations of moral, ethical and theological corruption rifled back and forth, with various parties accusing the other of corrupting and fabricating 'scripture'. The secular polemist Celsus (lived during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, 161180 CE) accuses the early Christians of changing their scriptures simply to improve their arguments against their opponents, \"Some of the believers ... have changed the original text of the Gospels three or four times or even more, with the intention of thus being able to destroy the arguments of their critics.\"[58] Origen (c. 185  c. 254 CE) does not dispute the existence of such changes, but counters Celsus argument seeking to soothe the importance of these changes by stating that such changes to the text were initiated by 'heretics' such as Marcion, Valentinus and Lucanus. Without any recourse to the original autographs, Origen aptly observes, \"It is an obvious fact today that there is much diversity among the manuscripts, due either to the carelessness of the scribes, or to the perverse audacity of some people in correcting the text, or again to the fact that there are those who add or delete as they please, setting themselves up as correctors.\"[59] Origen is known to have sought out information regarding the variant readings in the Greek New Testament. In fact, in some passages that presented specific exegetical problems, Origen suggested that perhaps all of the manuscripts that were available may have been corrupted! Certainly not the first to display puzzlement over the text of the New Testament, Origen is followed by a host of other prominent Church fathers who grappled with the differences in the biblical text. For example, Jerome (c. 347420 CE) and Augustine (354430 CE) were known to have practiced textual criticism due to the fluidity of the biblical text.[60]\n\nBut were the accusations of corrupting and fabricating 'scripture' limited to pagan philosophers such as Celsus? Although widely and strongly condemned, forgery was also a frequent occurrence in early Christendom; notably, the practice of forgery was not limited to the \"heretics\". For example, an \"orthodox\" presbyter of Asia Minor owned up to forging the Apostolic Constitutions and III Corinthians. In his defence the deposed presbyter claimed that he did it \"out of love for Paul.\"[61] In fact, the textual history of the first three hundred years of the New Testament is described by the textual critics as \"the period of relative freedom\" or \"the period of relative creativity.\" During this period the majority of changes to the text of the New Testament, both accidental and intentional, originated:\n\nThe majority of textual variants that are preserved in the surviving documents, even the documents produced in a later age, originated during the first three Christian centuries.\n\nThis conviction is not based on idle speculation. In contrast to the relative stability of the New Testament text in later times, our oldest witnesses display a remarkable degree of variation. The evidence suggests that during the earliest period of its transmission the New Testament text was in a state of flux, that it became standardized in some regions by the fourth century, and subject to fairly rigid control (by comparison) only in the Byzantine period.[62]\n\nBoth \"orthodox\" and \"heterodox\" scribes, who were intent on stamping their mark on the biblical text to bolster their arguments pertaining to the theological position they advocated, used their skills. The texts were not inviolable and hence subjected to changes.\n\nWhile these christological issues were under debate, before any one group had established itself as dominant and before the proto-orthodox party had refined its christological views with the nuance that would obtain in the fourth century, the books of the emerging Christian Scriptures were circulating in manuscript form. The texts of these books were by no means inviolable; to the contrary, they were altered with relative ease and alarming frequency. Most of the changes were accidental, the result of scribal ineptitude, carelessness, or fatigue. Others were intentional, and reflect the controversial milieux within which they were produced.[63]\n\nSimilar observations are made by Harry Gamble. He says:\n\nComplaints about the adulteration of texts are fairly frequent in early Christian literature. Christian texts, scriptural and nonscriptural, were no more immune than others from vicissitudes of unregulated transmission in handwritten copies. In some respects they were more vulnerable than ordinary texts, and not merely because Christian communities could not always command the most competent scribes. Although Christian writings generally aimed to express not individual viewpoints but the shared convictions and values of a group, members of the group who acted as editors and copyists must often have revised texts in accordance with their own perceptions. This temptation was stronger in connection with religious or philosophical texts than with others simply because more was at stake. A great deal of early Christian literature was composed for the purpose of advancing a particular viewpoint amid the conflicts of ideas and practices that repeatedly arose within and between Christian communities, and even documents that were not polemically conceived might nevertheless be polemically used. Any text was liable to emendation in the interest of making it more pointedly serviceable in a situation of theological controversy.[64]\n\nConsequently, it is not surprising that the studies on New Testament papyri indicate that the text was much more fluid during the first two hundred years of transmission than originally thought.[65] A wide range of textual critics affirm the fluidity of the New Testament text in the first two hundred years. This has been confirmed by research, which has demonstrated that both \"orthodox\" and \"heretical\" scribes were indulging in deliberate theological changes to their biblical text.[66]\n\nContrary to the confident claims of Christian apologists, the early manuscript witnesses do not establish the \"authenticity\" and \"general integrity\" of the New Testament. Rather they show the fluidity and deliberate changes in the early New Testament text.\n\nNo discussion about the early dating of the New Testament manuscripts is complete without mentioning the works of José O'Callaghan and Carsten Thiede; for these two scholars are mentioned with great reverence in Christian apologetic literature.\n\nJosé O'Callaghan's work was related to identification of very small fragments found in Cave VII in Qumran. These fragments were published by Baillet, Milik and de Vaux. Since they were unsure, they classified them as \"Biblical Texts?\".[67]\n\nFigure 1: Fragments of the papyri found in Cave VII in Qumran. The sizes of 7Q6,1, 7Q6,2, 7Q9, 7Q10 and 7Q15 are even smaller than that of 7Q8 as shown above.\n\nO'Callaghan identified them as having being written around 50 CE and containing a portion of Mark 6:52-53 (MSS. 7Q5), Mark 4:28 (MSS. 7Q6,1), I Timothy 3:16, 4:1-3 (MSS. 7Q4), James 1:23, 24 (MSS. 7Q8), Acts 27:38 (MSS. 7Q6,2), Romans 5:11-12 (MSS. 7Q9), II Peter 1:15 (MSS. 7Q10), Mark 12:17 (MSS. 7Q7) and Mark 6:48 (MSS. 7Q15).[68] This identification was given popularity in the news media for the consumption of general public. However, the scholarly community rejected the identification. A series of critiques by M. Baillet,[69] P. Benoit,[70] Gordon Fee,[71] Colin Hemer,[72] Colin Roberts[73] and Kurt Aland[74] appeared in journals. As Metzger puts it:\n\nMost of the popular articles accepted O'Callaghan's opinion; almost all the scholarly articles rejected it.[75]\n\nIn 1988, G. -Wilhelm Nebe proposed that fragment 7Q4,1 was part of I Enoch 103:3-4, while 7Q4,2 was part of I Enoch 98:11.[76] He also suggested that 7Q8 was part of I Enoch 103:7-8; but with much reservation, since this fragment could easily be identified with several Old Testament passages.[77] Nebe identification of 7Q4,1-2 was challenged by Thiede who supported O'Callaghan's identification. In 1996 Puech defended Nebe's identification of fragment 7Q4,1 as being part of I Enoch 103:3-4; while suggesting that 7Q4,2 is part of I Enoch 105:1.[78] Recent textual reconstruction by Muro[79] and Puech[80] has convincingly shown that 7Q4,1 (= I Enoch 103:3-4), 7Q8 (= I Enoch 103:7-8) and 7Q12 (= I Enoch 103:4) are part of the same ensemble. This definitely excludes the identification of them as a part of the epistles of the New Testament, I Timothy 3:16, 4:1-3 and James 1:23-24.\n\nIt is not surprising that the Christian missionary and apologetical literature, that thrives on cashing in on human gullibility, still clings to the identification of O'Callaghan that has been rejected in scholarly circles.[81] This is also true for Carsten Thiede's work.[82]\n\nO'Callaghan's discredited identification of the Qumran fragments was given a new lease of life by Carsten Thiede in his book The Earliest Gospel Manuscript? The Qumran Papyrus 7Q5 And Its Significance For New Testament Studies (1992, Paternoster: Exeter). In this book Thiede tried to argue for the existence of a Christian text in Qumran on the basis of an unlikely identification of the papyrus fragment 7Q5 as part of Mark's Gospel. But it is his later work co-authored with Matthew d'Ancona The Jesus Papyrus that attracted the biggest attention which we will now turn to.\n\nMatthew d'Ancona, a reporter with The Times on the 24th December 1994, just a day before Christmas, reported a claim that certain fragments of Matthew are even older than P52, attributing its dating to Thiede:\n\nA papyrus believed to the oldest extant fragment of the New Testament has been found in an Oxford library. It provides the first material evidence that the Gospel according to St. Matthew is an eyewitness account written by contemporaries of Christ.\n\nIn a paper to be published next month, Carsten Thiede, a German papyrologist, will claim that three scraps of Matthew belonging to Magdalen College date from the mid-first century A.D. The fragments, which have been kept at the college since 1901, were thought originally to have been written in the late second century.\n\nThis refers to three fragments of Matthew of the Magdalen papyrus P64. In 1953, the papyrologist Colin Roberts found that the hand used on them closely paralleled the fragments of the Oxyrhynchus papyri from Egypt which had been dated around 200 CE.[83] Roberts showed the photograph of this manuscript to three of his fellow papyrologists Bell, Skeat and Turner, who \"independently without hesitation pronounced in favor of a date in the later second century.\" He then concludes that \"their verdict can be accepted with confidence.\"[84]\n\nThiede's paper disputing and overturning the findings of Roberts was published in 1995 in Zeitschrift Für Papyrologie Und Epigraphik.[85] A slightly revised version appeared in Tyndale Bulletin later that year.[86] The paper, contrary to the extravagant claims made in The Times, sounds more cautious:\n\n... with all due caution, the possibility of redating the fragments from Oxford and Barcelona - which are, after all, definitely Matthean - to a period somewhat earlier than the second century previously assigned to them. Certainty will remain elusive, of course.[87]\n\nThis \"somewhat earlier\" date is specified as a date in the \"late first century sometime after the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem.\"[88] Unlike the newspaper article, there is no suggestion that Matthew is an eyewitness report. Since the academic journals are carefully refereed by peers, the authors do not find it easy to use these journals for their extravagant claims. However, when it comes to statements made in media what matters are the sound-bites and newsworthiness. Caution is dumped.\n\nSince there is a consensus among the scholars that the \"author\" of the Gospel according to Matthew wrote it in the late first century,[89] a late first century dating would not cause much of an alarm. But The Times reported a mid-first century date that contradicts Thiede's own assessment of a late first century dating of the Matthean fragments at Oxford as mentioned in the journal. In his book The Jesus Papyrus co-authored with the journalist Matthew d'Ancona, Thiede has completely abandoned the caution he had expressed in Zeitschrift Für Papyrologie Und Epigraphik. What one reads in the book is that the Magdalen papyri:\n\n... were of astonishingly early origin, dating from the mid-first century AD. He was shortly to publish his claims in the specialist journal Zeitschrift für Papyrologie.[90]\n\nAs we have seen earlier, Thiede never made any such claim in the specialist journal. The issue does not stop at discrepancies in assigning a date to the Magdalen fragments. The authors describe P64 as a manuscript on paper! A cursive manuscript is called a \"minuscle\".[91] In fact, there are many such howlers to discredit the authors' competence in the field of palaeography. Such carelessness is surely unwarranted in a book that aims to impress the readers with Thiede's \"dispassionate rigour\". Not surprisingly the carelessness is also reflected in the dating and analysis of P64 and the Qumran manuscript 7Q5. Thiede's material has been handed a devastating refutation by Klaus Wachtel,[92] Peter Head,[93] David Parker,[94] Keith Elliott,[95] Philip Comfort,[96] Graham Stanton[97] among others. As for the identification of the fragment 7Q5 as verses from the Gospel of Mark, Daniel B. Wallace wrote a critique of both O'Callaghan and Thiede. The popular Christian magazine Christianity Today also critiqued the work of Thiede in the article Indiana Jones and the Gospel Parchments.\n\nThiede attributes the widespread rejection of his proposals to the bias of academic scholars afraid of losing their chances of moving up the academic ladder, should they endorse conservative views. \"There are\", he declares, \"virtually no limits to the scholarly acrobatics which some academics will perform to dismiss a thesis that does not fit their intellectual paradigm.\"[98] It is strange that a man who has constructed such a large glasshouse of his own should throw a stone of this size.[99]\n\nThiede claims to have answered all those who are critical of his dating of P64 and the Qumran manuscript 7Q5. Yet his \"answers\" can't persuade the scholars to accept his criticism. It is not surprising to see that the Institut für Neutestamentliche Textforschung, Münster, Germany has not been spared, no doubt, due to its implacable resistance to register 7Q5 in its list of officially recognized New Testament manuscripts. Klaus Wachtel from this institute in Münster, who demolished Thiede's claims, is depicted in derogatory terms. Thiede's feelings are obvious when he addresses the critical text of the Greek New Testament (one of the products of the Münster institute) as \"the so-called 'Nestle-Aland' Novum Testamentum Graece\".[100] Shall we say sour grapes? As to how sour the grapes have become, it can be discerned in a recent article by the well-known palaeographer T. C. Skeat on the papyrus P64 who does not even mention the redating by Thiede! He dates it firmly to c. 200 CE.[101]\n\nFinally we should also mention the redating of papyrus fragment P46 by Young Kyu Kim. He suggested that P46 should be dated to the first century.[102] Although his article provoked a widespread interest, it has failed to receive any sustained attention in the literature except for an endorsement by O'Callaghan[103] and a cautious review by Daniel Wallace.[104] The lack of sustained attention is quite likely due to the fact that Kim's viewpoint is far from compelling as well as the fact that his evidence is quite disorganized. Recently Pickering produced a detailed refutation of Kim's dating and he dates P46 back to c. 200 CE.[105] Other palaeographers do not seem to be persuaded by Kim's methodology of an early dating of P46 either.[106]\n\nLet us now summarize the discussion on the early dating of fragments with a quote by Holmes:\n\nClaims that portions of Mark have been identified among the manuscript fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran are quite unconvincing (see Graham Stanton, Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels [Valley Forge, Pa.: Trinity Press International, 1995], 20-32; Metzger, Text, 264-65). The proposal by Y. K. Kim ... that P46 (widely dated to ca. 200) should be dated prior to the end of the first century has not proven to be persuasive (see Metzger, Text, 265-66). The claim by C. P. Thiede that fragments of Matthew should be dated to \"c. A.D. 66\" is based on a rat's nest of fanciful hypotheses and unsubstantiated assertions (for a brief overview and response, see Stanton, Gospel Truth? 11-19).[107]\n\nSimilarly, Burton Mack says:\n\nThiede's Dead Sea Scrolls scenario is preposterous; his theory about the Markan fragment among the Dead Sea Scrolls has been discredited; and the mass of detailed scholarship on the origins and history of early Christian movements and their writings has simply been swept aside in the eager pursuit of a chimera. From a critical scholar's point of view, Thiede's proposal is an example of just how desperate the Christian imagination can become in the quest to argue for the literal facticity of the Christian gospels.[108]\n\n3. Conclusions\n\nWhen discussing the numerical superiority and ancientness of the New Testament manuscripts, the missionaries' blunders become apparent when their conclusions are evaluated by examining the various methodologies for reconstructing the Greek New Testament and how these competing methodologies understand and use external (i.e., manuscript) evidence. Contrary to missionary and apologetical claims, nowhere in these reconstructive methodologies can we observe an axiomatic principle whereby the numerical amount of Greek manuscripts function in a manner that automatically allows us to have a greater degree of confidence in the reliability or trustworthiness of the resultant New Testament text. In fact, the claims made by the missionaries show similarity with the reconstructive methodology with a preference for the Byzantine text-form. These advocates of the \"Majority\" text appeal to the numerical superiority of the Byzantine text-form among the Greek manuscripts whilst simultaneously claiming this text-type represents more closely the \"original\" text. Unfortunately for the missionaries and apologists, this form of scholarship has been rejected by the vast majority of textual critics who as early as the 1880's in the form of the two Cambridge scholars Westcott and Hort, recognised the corrupt, secondary nature of these texts.[109]\n\nWe have seen misquoted claims, misrepresented claims, incorrect claims, fraudulent claims and even claims that are mathematically impossible. None of these fantastic claims (normally in the form of percentages) show the procedure utilised to arrive at such magnificent figures. We can see that the modern day textual critics portray a very different set of statistics quite contrary to the over-hyped claims of the missionaries and apologists. The Alands, discussing the differences between seven popular critical editions of the New Testament, excluding orthographic differences and differences of only one word, calculate that 62.9% of the verses of the entire New Testament are in agreement with each other. Similarly, if we look at the statistics for the gospels, we find that there is a 54.5% agreement. If we look at the textual \"certainty\" of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament, a text which is based on the decisions of a committee, the result is close to 83.5%. There is no mention of 99.5%, 99.8% or 99.9% agreement here. In a twist of irony further compounding the foolishness of the missionaries' and apologists' position, the Bibles they use (normally the NIV version) are based on the very same critical editions of the New Testament by the very same people who have calculated the above percentages!\n\nThe final call of the missionaries and apologists, when their attempts to over-hype the Greek manuscripts bear no fruit, is to appeal to the fact that the entire Greek New Testament can be reconstructed using only the Patristic quotations, without recourse to any other additional manuscript evidence. While it is certainly true that some modern day textual critics, including Metzger mention that such a circumstance is theoretically possible, we rarely find the missionaries and apologists discussing the numerous problems associated with this statement.[110] In any case, what role do the Patristic citations play in today's critical editions of the New Testament? They play no more than a 'supplementary and corroborative' role, particularly in passages where the primary evidence (i.e., Greek manuscripts) is insufficient to reconstruct the text with absolute certainty. Indeed, if we examine the evidential selection principles behind the recently released Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior, it becomes apparent that readings with exclusively Patristic support struggle to make it into the critical apparatus, let alone ever being considered as an actual verse of the Greek New Testament.\n\nGoing hand in hand with the claims of numerical superiority are those claims of 'ancientness'. The manuscripts are \"very old\" we are told. The missionaries and apologists point towards numerous 1st century Dead Sea Scroll manuscripts for several books of the New Testament including Mark, I Timothy, James, Acts, Romans and II Peter. Also, fragments according to the Gospel of Matthew can be redated to \"c. A.D. 66\". Certainly one could arrive at these conclusions if the relevant newspaper articles and soundbites are collated. However, one can arrive at quite different conclusions if the opinions of New Testament textual scholars, including Baillet, Benoit, Fee, Hemer, Roberts, Aland and others are taken into consideration, as they conclusively refute these grossly inaccurate and yet popular claims. Indeed, when we compare the earliest known manuscript evidence for the twenty-seven books of the New Testament to their respective estimated dates of composition, we do not find the difference so small as to be \"negligible\". In fact, we can observe that several books of the New Testament find no manuscript support until the 4th century CE! Also, when we examine the palaeographic features of the entire spectrum of Greek New Testament manuscripts, the overwhelming majority utilise a form of handwriting termed minuscule. This form of handwriting started to be used in the 9th century and became widespread by the 11th century. How one can make claims of 'ancientness' when only 6% of the more than 5,000 or so Greek New Testament manuscripts date from before the 9th century, some 800 years after the birth of Jesus, points towards a desperate state of affairs.\n\nAmphoux and Vaganay, referring to the \"eternal, inerrant, infallible, unchangeable word of God\" as represented by the 26th edition of Nestle-Aland's Novum Testamentum Graece, aptly summarise the textual evidence:\n\nThe concern not to trouble simple minds with an uncertain or reworked text is no doubt a laudable one, but is it right to alter history? For what is implied to be the original text is in fact probably a text established in Egypt around the year AD 200, doubtless with some earlier readings but also some innovations,...[111]\n\nAnd Allah knows best!\n\nReferences & Notes\n\n[1] F.

He says:\n\nIn all, something over five thousand witnesses to the Greek New Testament are extant today. Many (if not most) of these, it should be noted, are fragmentary or incomplete. Only 3 majuscules (א/01, A/02 and C/04) and fifty-six minuscules contain the entire New Testament; another 2 majuscules and 147 minuscules lack only Revelation. As for content, the Gospels are found in just over 2,300 MSS, the Acts and Catholic letters in about 655, and the Pauline letters in about 780, and Revelation in about 290. With regard to date, over 65 percent are from the eleventh through the fourteenth centuries, while less than 2.5 percent are from the first five centuries.\n\n[17] B. D.

This edition is similar to the Nestle-Aland's critical edition except that it has more details on the textual variants and their relative degree of certainty.\n\nBy means of the letters A, B, C, and D, enclosed within \"braces\" { } at the beginning of each set of textual variants the Committee has sought to indicate the relative degree of certainty, arrived at the basis of internal considerations as well as of external evidence, for the reading adopted as the text. The letter A signifies that the text is virtually certain, while B indicates that there is some degree of doubt. The letter C means that there is a considerable degree of doubt whether the text or the apparatus contains the superior reading, while D shows that there is a very high degree of doubt concerning the reading selected for the text.\n\n[47] The table is taken from K. D. Clarke's \"Textual Certainty In The United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament\", Novum Testamentum, 2002, Volume XLIV (No. 2), p. 116. We have slightly modified it for our argument. The 4th edition of The Greek New Testament is not included here because of its unfounded letter rating and has received scathing criticism from fellow textual critics. See Clarke's article and also L. M. McDonald and S. E. Porter's Early Christianity And Its Sacred Literature, 2000, op. cit., p. 581. McDonald and Porter say that the\n\n... first to third (corrected) editions of the UBS text were fairly consistent in their rating criteria and their distributions of ratings, but UBS-4 has experienced severe \"grade inflation,\" with a disproportionately high number of elevated ratings. For this reason, many scholars appear to be continuing use of the third (corrected) edition , since the text is the same, and to be consulting the fourth edition for the updating of the witnesses to various readings, although these are minimal.\n\n[48] B.
