        "text": "[2] Five/Six years of assisting Reuben and his work; the ups and downs (1997 - 2003)\n\nAfter one phone call and a letter, I journeyed down to Camarillo to visit Reuben. I was not sure of what to expect. It was late 1997 or very early in 1998. Reuben lived in a trailer park, a nice quiet one. After the introductions (meeting Mirian) we went out to his study. This was a converted garage, it now housed his library and desk and work area. I stood for a moment and surveyed the area. He had about 500 or so volumes, most on religion, less than a half dozen on Textual Criticism or on Greek manuscripts. In fact it was not the library of a textual critic, but rather one of a philosopher, or of a liberal pastor.\n\nReproduced elsewhere on this site is the image below, it shows a portion of this work area of Reuben's, and the image below, brings to mind the very situation while he was on the phone. He was calling in to a secretary at William Carey Publishers, and he was giving over the phone last minute corrections to Galatians just before it was to be published. While he was talking I was looking over the proof-galleys of Galatians, and I began casually noticing various errors. I perceived Reuben was about to hang up when I asked:\n\n\"Reuben did you mention this error?\" Reuben looked at the error I was indicating, and sputtered to the secretary on the phone:\n\n\"Oh! just a minute I have another correction\". He then gave her the page number. I again pointed out several more, and Reuben continued to recite to her over the phone the errors I was indicating. After which Reuben hung up.\n\nI sat there numb, shocked and slowly feeling depressed. I said, \"Reuben, we need to spend a weeek or two correcting these galley proofs.\" His response was similar to his early responses when I implored about proof-reading, he said: \"We will let the next generation correct them in future editions\". Again Reuben's lack of concern for quality, or a low view of the sacredness of his work prevailed. So the work was printed, as are all of his works, with NO THIRD PARTY proof-reading! This was not an accident, it is/was willful intent, a total lack of respect for the final version of his work. Such concern speaks volumes.\n\nexhibit #6\n\nThis photo was taken on my 2nd or 3rd visit to Reuben's. It is a very telling image. Note especially the film reader behind Reuben, see the falling ribbon of film. It is a film of an actual Biblical manuscript. Reuben had no spool holders on his reader, so the film hung down to the garage floor. This produced scratches over time. Not to mention the fact the the films were constantly exposed to the changing temperatures and humidity in the garage, where they were kept - the garage was not heated or air conditioned! When I first noticed these things, I was at first shocked. But as time passed, I realized that these matters were not important to Reuben.\n\nReuben was desperately seeking someone to carry on his labors. He was shocked when he learned that I had no degrees. He excluded me from consideration as an assistant. If it were not for the fact that I possessed many manuscript films which he desired, he probably would have had little interest in me. He wanted a PhD bearing person, to train to replace him. Nothing less. I suddenly became aware of the psychological state of affairs and of the man Reuben Swanson. [more on this below].\n\nReuben had very little training as a textual critic. True, one of his instructors at Yale was Millar Burrows, but if he was taught any relevant palaeographical or codicological methods and observations, they were long forgotten. Reuben had no way to determine the date of any manuscripts, he had no Kurzgefasste Liste, he had no texts on textual criticism, no works on palaeography. He did have a copy of some collations of codex 02, he had several Greek NT editions. No Greek concordance no Greek dictionaries were seen. (However he may have had a Greek dictionary somewhere!).\n\nReuben could collate. He could recognize many ligatures. But he was astonishingly naive as concerns the science or art of textual criticism, and of basic palaeography. I realized that it was by accident that he was even doing this work on the Greek manuscripts.\n\nFortuantely, for us, Reuben did not need extensive knowledge about textual criticism, nor of codicology nor of palaeography. He needed to see clearly, to accurately record data, to read minuscule and uncial scripts. Thats it! Well, he also became good at imputing data into the computer. (Though he was very ignorant as concerns any other aspects of a computer)! It was merely his collation ability which the volumes in his Greek New Testament manuscripts needed. His persistence is also a plus. I suppose that this is also the place to list some other problems with the/his process.\n\nIn the early days of his education and teaching career, Reuben, for some reason took offense to the work of the Germans in Münster. Who knows why, something in his childhood, or Germanic-Swedish relations? I have no idea, but he was and is like a man possessed to expose the errors in the editions of the Nestle/Aland Greek New Testaments.\n\nReuben's earlier works on the gospels are kind of a patch-work. Pieces joined from earlier efforts. The earlier efforts were not corrected, and he added to them more recent collations and ended up with his present 4 volumes on the gospels. So the 4 volumes are a combination of earlier and newer works, now joined. Here is a sample page from his 1982 work on Matthew:\n\nexhibit # 7 sample from Matthew 28:15-19\n\nIn the above he uses about 20 manuscripts, the one papyrus is P45. He does show parallel readings in the other gospel accounts. Herein we see the earlier form of Reuben's work method. The parallel lines are an excellent means by which to compare the manuscript readings.\n\nIn this next image we compare a portion from his 1982 publication on Matthew with his current edition of Matthew, the current publication is the lower portion of the image below the line: [the sample passage is from Matthew 4:1]\n\nexhibit #8 - sample passage from Matthew 4:1\n\nUse of the computer has greatly improved the appearance of his work. But we also see that he has utilized new witnesses. He has combined MSS 1, 118 and 1582 (when they agree) into the single sigla 1. Near the bottom of his newer edition, we see minuscule 1346. A now famous error. Reuben thought this was MS 1346. He had absolutely NO IDEA that it was really MS 346, he simply saw a shelf number on the outside of the ABMC filmbox, and thought that that was the Gregory/Aland number. He now uses about 42 MSS for the newer text of Matthew.\n\nWhile at Western Carolina University, the university gave to him (or loaned to him) about 50 films of NT manuscripts. This became the nucleus of his collection. Most of the materials then were of the gospels. Years later, while in California, he was able to acquire more films from the ABMC. In fact nearly all of his new gospel material was from the ABMC. For some reason, his earlier collations, and some of his newer ones on the minuscules were not very accurate, but I clarify this and illustrate some possible reasons below.\n\nAfter the gospel editions were finished, Reuben faced a major change. Acts typically required him to utilize a new set of praxapostolos type manuscripts. So he set out to procure these from the ABMC. We see what he acquired in his ACTS edition; below is a copy of the MSS used in his work on ACTS:\n\nexhibit #9 - MSS for ACTS\n\nAlas, Reuben is now working in a new environment! He is viewing MSS he is not familiar with. And throughout most of ACTS, one notes a large amount of collation/reading errors. It is at this junction that I meet Reuben. I upbraid him for his errors. I scold him. I told him that such a rate of errors is unacceptable. Though he does not publicly admit it, I motivated him to excell. His later works (from Galatians onward) are much more accurate. Perhaps he was upset that a person who is self-taught could so correct him.\n\nNote too in the list above many MSS not available from the ABMC- Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center. Manuscripts such as: 614, P53, and 1175 and others. They came from his gopher, Mr. Dykes. For I provided him with these MSS. If I did not possess the needed film, I went to the trouble to write to the holding facility and to order it for Reuben. I then made a copy, and sent him the copy, I kept the original film sent from the library or monastery. I gave him for free some of my copies, but later began charging him for films from overseas. I was surprised that Reuben had not first done this necessary work to acquire the needed films BEFORE beginning such a serious project. I suspect that he was going to carry on in such a haphazard willy-nilly manner! That is beginning a work without the needed resources, or proposing a work which was intentionally deficient!\n\nAs he began his work on Galatians, I began to get more films for him. I do not know the exact number, but I shared and sent to him about 30-35 films. I also shared with him some transcriptions of papyri which I had carefully made in my preparations for my own work. Some of the films I acquired for Reuben, were not then in America, and I use almost all of my films for my work on First Corinthians. So when it came to the Pauline Epistles, I was prepared, but Reuben was not. I had spent years preparing for my work on Corinthians, and I believe this is the case for most scholars as they prepare to do a major project.\n\nA sponsor, a rancher in Colorado (as I recall, a Richard Mott, to whom the Acts volume is co-dedicated to) sends a donation to Dr. Winter's organization, this money serves as a small salary to pay Reuben for his efforts. Mr. Mott is either of the Quaker persuasion or is a Christian Scientist (my memory fails me here). At any rate, Reuben receives monetary compensation for the work, and he has received some basic equipment (computer et al).\n\nOne occasion which shocked me was a phone call from Reuben one evening. He said that the folks in Münster needed to correct their manuscript listings (he did eventually acquire some manuscript content listings from Mr. Dykes). According to Reuben, MSS 1342 contained the Pauline Epistles, and NOT as Münster claimed the gospels only. Did Münster make such a gross error? I checked the Kurzgefasste, and indeed 1342 contained only the gospels, but Reuben said it contained the Pauline epistles as well. So I asked Reuben to send me a copy.\n\nAfter receiving the film copy, I immediately recognized the manuscript, as it was a manuscript I use in my work! But it was NOT MS 1342. It was MS 2492. The shelf number at Mt. Sinai was 1342; Reuben used this number as the manuscript number (an error he has committed several other times!). So Reuben had to go through his nearly finished work on Galatians and correct this mysterious 1342 reading! I am glad that he sent me a copy before the work was printed!\n\nI offered to proof-read Reuben's work. I even bought software so that I could read his Mac files on my PC computer. But Reuben never shared his files with me. This goes back to an earlier observation: Reuben was not very (is not) secure in his ability as a textual critic. He is insecure, and having associations with a lowly person such as myself with no degrees, was more than Reuben could bear. He could not psychologically allow me to participate in the work. Sad. So I functioned as a servant, working in the background to get him needed materials. But I did much more.\n\nMuch more.\n\nBelow is a copy of information which Reuben wanted from me, he wanted my opinion as to the value of the following manuscripts. He wanted to know which ones he should or should not use:\n\nexhibit #10 - letter from Reuben, dated August 8, 2000\n\nSo I marked the above list with numbers from 1 thru 10 indicating which MS was important and which ones he should or should not use. Reuben shows 6 manuscripts still on order from me. Besides these 6, I note that MSS 424, 1837, 1734, 1175, 1245, 910, 2464 and others were also from me. In addition to advising him as to which MSS to use, he needed codicological information, such as the canon order of certain MSS, where the MSS were now located, and the dates of their creation. In fact I revised his error-filled MSS list as seen above in Acts (exhibit #9). I have copies of canon orders for MSS 910, 1982, 2815, and 2464, which he needed, and I sent them to him. I also demonstrated for him the folio order for reading MSS which were filmed from the rear-to-front.\n\nBelow is a copy of some of the foliations of MS 365, by doing this for Reuben I saved him several hours of trying to locate the connected texts in Galatians. It was sent along with the film of MS 365 which I ordered for him. Below the chart is a copy (exhibit #12) of the receipt/amount Reuben sent to me for a copy of MS 365. I received a number of checks from Reuben for film copies and other data.\n\nexhibit #11 - chart of MS 365 foliation\n\nexhibit #12 - receipt for payment for MS 365 film\n\nAmazingly Reuben actually thought that the Library in Florence would photograph MS 365 just for Reuben's order. When in actuality, they sent a copy of a previous film. Again some of Reuben's naiveness is apparent.\n\nBelow is a copy of another letter from Reuben:\n\nexhibit #13 - letter from Reuben, Sept. 1999\n\nIn the above he mentions other MSS which I provided for him. He really needed help with the \"fragmentary\" MSS, the papyri. In fact he was not keen on using them. Consequently, I did not send him much material on the papyri. I also sent him a copy of my copy of Tischendorf's transcription of codex 06.\n\nReuben asked me about the abbreviations for the names of God and Christ, whether or not should he show them as abbreviations or what, and where he should place the data. I advised him to show the abbreviations. I advised him to show all itacisms and other minor orthographic errors or variations, I patiently explained to him why he needed to show such itacisms and variations as it aided the textual critic as to provenance and dialectical indications! Not to mention identifying various scriptoriums, scribes and styles! This greatly increased his work, but adds to the depth. Reuben, in his work on Galatians, took my advice and placed the orthographical variants in the main apparatus. However as seen below, he did not refer the reader to me as the source for the change, but rather to Moulton and Metzger.\n\nexhibit #14 - from Galatians, Introduction\n\nOf course I can understand why Reuben did not give me credit, Moulton and Metzger's names bolster his credibility, as I (Gary Dykes) am not one who is recognized, however it is on/in THE RECORD that I did first advise him as to the placement of orthographical readings and the need to show the names of God (as abbrerviations) in the main apparatus.\n\nI sent him a copy of Aland's TEXT UND TEXTWERT DER GRIECHISCHEN HANDSCHRIFTEN DES NEUEN TESTAMENTS. II. DIE PAULINISCHEN BRIEFE. Reuben had never seen such a work. It amazed him, and he immediately attacked it and set out to correct it. His corrections to it first appear in his work on Galatians, beginning on page 93. He referred to the work (T and T) as a \"joke\".\n\nHis late wife Mirian, bought Reuben a copy of Tischendorf's 8th, in about the year 2000. He immediately set out to correct Tischendorf, never realizing that Tischendorf was working from the original manuscript, and he Reuben from films of varying quality. His \"corrections\" to Tischendorf begin to appear in his work on I Corinthians. Which brings up another topic.\n\nAbout 1999, Reuben and I exchanged some films of manuscripts. I wanted copies of 8 of his films. I paid $10.00 for each copy, a total of $80.00. I gave to Reuben copies of excellent and easy to read films (as I always did - I made sure the films I sent to him were easy to read). I was amazed at the copies from his films. I could not read 4 of them, and one other was barely legible. I had to throw them away. One which I recall was codex 010. It became obvious how Reuben made so many errors, he was using very old and very degraded films! And he did not want any proof-readers interfering with HIS work. Nor was he interested in upgrading any of his films, nor for learning how to care for and store such valuable materials.\n\nHis films were not of great value to Reuben. He was not interested in upgrading them! Which brings up another issue, his feelings and views about the Word of God, the Scriptures. We spent some time arguing over theological issues, which are important issues to me. Fortunately his work on the Manuscripts is fairly objective, his odd theology had little impact upon his collations. But they do reveal some clues as to the person - Reuben Swanson the theologian. And his theological views assisted with perverting his growth in the area of textual-criticism.\n\nPerhaps because Reuben did not perceive God's Word as unique and God-breathed is why he was not too concerned about his rate of errors, or concerned about proof-reading, or not concerned about revising and correcting his earlier works on the gospels. One may be justified in wondering just WHY Reuben is doing this work? I suspect his ego has a large stake in his motivations, as well as the fame he is already acquiring. Reuben is a gentleman, and has lived a much nobler life than I, but I detest some of his views about God's Word, and religion in general. Note these comments from Reuben:\n\nexhibit #15 - part of letter from Reuben, dated Jan. 1998\n\nUnlike Luther, Reuben does not recognize the unique Inspiration of God's Word. Reuben's penchant for philosophy has often corrupted his Biblical views. Like the Gnostics, he constantly welds human rationale with Divine revelation. Unlike Luther, Reuben believes we can never recreate the orginal text of God's Word, that it is lost, and that we must be satisfied with error-filled copies which contain some of God's Word.\n\nNote below, this copy from his introduction to I Corinthians , page xxxi:\n\nexhibit #16 - quote from I Cor.\n\nThis is a sad admission (above) from Reuben, obviously he does not understand I Corinthians 2:16! He proposes that critics, instead, try to reconstruct later texts which are recensions appearing during various periods in church history. I wrote a response to these ludicrous remarks, I never sent the file to him, but it exposes many of Reuben's lack of textual acumen(s). Click on the PDF image, below, to download the brief paper:\n\nLinks to PDF file, \"Some Comments Upon Reuben Swanson's Proposal...\"\n\nAgain, it is fortunate that Reuben's forte is not textual criticism, but rather his ability to present collated data. Hence, his comments on textual criticism can be ignored. It is his presentation of the data which is all important and useful.\n\nWhat I am thankful for is that I was able to impact Reuben's work. I demanded that he reduce his number of errors! I insisted that he show all minor orthographical variants in the main apparatus. I sent him good copies of useful manuscripts, and I assisted him with codicological issues. I also answered innumerable questions for him over the phone. I did some proof-reading, and corrected his work in many places for him. He gives me a line of acknowledgement in his \"Acknowledgements\" and this is reward enough. In some of his earlier works, I did not want my name associated.\n\nI quit assisting Reuben in 2003, as I could not go along with his somewhat popular views of the text and its inspiration. Reuben believed that the reader of God's Word is the object of inspiration, whereas I believe that the original written Words and thoughts are the object of inspiration. Here is one portion of a letter in which he speaks of Inspiration; though confusing, Reuben did not consider God's Word (the NT) to be Divinely Inspired, inerrant and infallible or complete.\n\nexhibit #17- from letter from Reuben, dated Jan. 19, 1998\n\nVia such a warped view, Reuben can declare that what he now writes is as equally Inspired as are the documents of the New Testament. It is apparent that to him the canon is not closed!! This borders upon blasphemy in my mind. Because of such beliefs, I found it impossible to continue to support Reuben.\n\nI trust that his volumes will enlighten all as to the actual text and readings of the Pauline Epistles. I pray that he finishes his final volume on the Pauline Epistles. Again, his work on the Pauline epistles is the best we have today for examining the variants in these portions of the Pauline Epistles. The volumes cannot be recommended enough! They are not perfect, but their error rates are much lower than his previous attempts, and I claim some credit for this improvement.\n\nBelow a closing shot of a most unlikely pair! By the way, I have gotten married since the picture was taken, and I look much more presentable. Reuben is on the right, we are in front of the converted garage in Camarillo.\n\nexhibit #18 - 2 real characters"
