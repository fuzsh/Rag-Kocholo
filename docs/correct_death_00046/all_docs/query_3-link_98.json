        "text": "Caspar Ren√© Gregory published a cataloging system for the Greek New Testament manuscripts in 1908. In 1963, Kurt Aland expanded Gregory's work, and the Gregory-Aland (GA) numbers became the industry standard for referencing Greek New Testament manuscripts.\n\nNew Testament textual criticism goes back to Origen (185-254), in the third century of our common era. The historical roots of textual scholarship actually go back to the 3rd-century B.C.E. in the Library of Alexandria. We are going to the 18th-19th centuries for the purposes of this article."
