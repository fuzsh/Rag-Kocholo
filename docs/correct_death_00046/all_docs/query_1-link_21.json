        "text": "John 6:4 is usually held to be something like\n\n\"Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near.\" (Berean Study Bible)\n\nThe reason to be skeptical of John 6:4 is it seems to 1. not fit with the context of John as well as linguistically being odd, as Revelation Lad notes in his answer.\n\n\"If it were the Passover, the Jews and Jesus should be in Jerusalem, not Capernaum. If it were the Passover, it would be before the barley harvest, and barley bread would not be available (cf. John 6:9). If it were the Passover, the Jews would not be eating leavened bread, like barley bread. If it were the Passover, it should not be called the Passover of the Jews as it was the Passover of the LORD.\"\n\nAnd 2., it seems to make John not fit with the synoptic Gospels.\n\nThis motivates a skeptical eye towards the text. We have 3 options if there is indeed something wrong here, and we want to see if 6:4 can fit better with both the immediate context and the synoptics.\n\nEither a) one's understanding of what's happening in the text is wrong, or b) there's a corruption, or, c) if one doesn't hold to inerrancy, the text is just wrong.\n\nSo if one does hold to inerrancy, either there's a misunderstanding of the line itself, or manuscript corruption.\n\nIf we look for historical evidence that this was not understood to be the Passover, we find it with the early Church Fathers, some specifics of which are found in John 6:4 - He Walks With Us.\n\nIt cites Clement of Alexandria's Stromata, I, 21, 145.\n\n\"And Jesus was coming to His baptism, being about thirty years old,” and so on. And that it was necessary for Him to preach only a year, this also is written: “He hath sent Me to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.” This both the prophet spake, and the Gospel.\"\n\nIt also cites Irenaeus of Lyon's lack of quoting John 6:4 when making an argument for 3 Passovers, when it's an obviously relevant verse to quote.\n\nIt cites Origen's First Principles (as well as Homilies on Luke and Commentary on John).\n\n\"[Jesus] taught only during a year and some months\"\n\nas well as Tyconius.\n\nFurthermore, there are some manuscripts that omit the verse, apparently 472 (perhaps with a few others) and 1634 (see Should John 6:4 Be Considered a Spurious Insertion into John’s Gospel?).\n\n\"Next comes the number of the manuscript in which the verse is omitted (472), with “pc” following, which stands for Latin pauci, meaning “a few,” and indicating that there are a few other very minor manuscripts which lack the verse but none earlier than the one listed and significant enough to list. [...] in the final update of NA27, the apparatus has #1634 for the minuscule that lacks the verse, and this is likewise what is found in the electronic editions of the NA27 (e.g., in Accordance Bible Software and Logos Bible Software). More than likely, the final update of NA27 reflects the editors’ opinion that minuscule 1634 was a better representation of the few, late manuscripts that lacked the verse.\"\n\nFrom the REV commentary here:\n\n\"There is also some manuscript and evidence from the Church Fathers that “Passover” was added. There are a few manuscripts that omit the whole verse of John 6:4 (see Nestle and Aland; Novum Testamentum Graece, 26th edition, 1979, apparatus on John 6:4). That is entirely possible because the verse does not fit in the context. However, there is also evidence that the word “Passover” was not in the early manuscripts, which would mean that the original text read “Now the feast of the Jews was near.” Statements made by Origen, Cyril of Alexandria, and Irenaeus are consistent with the fact that they had manuscripts that did not have the Passover in John 6:4 (W. Cummins, The Acceptable Year of the Lord, Scripture Consulting, 2005, p. 66). If John 6:4 is just saying that “a feast of the Jews was near,” there were a number of smaller feasts in the Jewish calendar, and the Law did not require Jews to go to Jerusalem during those feasts.\n\nThere are a couple of different ways that the word “Passover” could have been added to the text. One is quite accidental. If the original text just said, “a feast of the Jews was near,” it would be entirely possible that a scribe who thought that feast was Passover wrote “Passover” in the margin of his manuscript. Scribes wrote notes in the margin of their manuscripts just as Christians today write in the margins of their Bibles. If that happened, then another scribe could have thought “Passover” was left out of the last copy, and so copied it into his next manuscript.\n\nAnother reason, less likely and less innocent, that John 6:4, or the word “Passover” might have been added was in the early centuries after Christ there were debates about the length of Jesus’ ministry. Anyone who studies the manuscripts knows that there were a number of topics that were hotly debated by the early Church, and it was not uncommon for one side to alter a manuscript to support their argument (cp. Bart Ehrman, The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture). Thankfully, today, especially with the help of computers that help textual critics to compare the over 5700 Greek manuscripts, it is usually easy to spot those intentional changes and expunge them from the modern Greek text, but a few manuscript discrepancies are still the subject of debate. The length of Jesus’ ministry was a topic of debate in the centuries after Christ, and John 6:4 could be one of the verses that was altered to support a position.\"\n\nThere are 2 problems with the manuscript evidence, though. First, one has to hold the earlier manuscripts which do have 6:4 were done after the change, and that puts the change very early on, and that the ones without 6:4 are descended from manuscripts that didn't have this corruption. To be compelling, then, this would require a further argument about the family of manuscripts those are descended from, and why we are to think they are significant.\n\nAlso, the evidence cited by the early Church Fathers could fit both different manuscripts or a different understanding of the line by the early commentators.\n\nTo decide which of these is more plausible, you need to have some alternate interpretation of John 6:4 which keeps the wording, such as Revelation Lad outlines in his answer (tl ; dr the Passover being referenced is the Pesach Sheni, which was for those who could not celebrate the normal Passover).\n\nConclusion: yes, it's possible either the word 'Passover' or the entire line was added at some point, and there is some evidence to support it. As the other answers point out, however, this does not mean it is conclusive, nor even probable, and the strongest evidence for this view ('Passover' doesn't seem to fit internally or with the synoptics, and some writings from early Church Fathers) also supports the idea that the Passover being referenced was the Pesach Sheni.\n\nBackground\n\nAs noted in Dottard's and Robert's answers, the manuscript evidence supports πάσχα ἡ ἑορτὴ τῶν Ἰουδαίων pascha a feast of the Jews as present in the original text. If this is the case manuscripts which lack the phrase have had it removed.\n\nThe reason a scribe would remove it is it leads to many difficulties. If it were the Passover, Jesus should be in Jerusalem, not Capernaum; if it were the Passover, it would be before the barley harvest, and barley bread would not be available (cf. John 6:9); if it were the Passover, Jesus would not be multiplying barley bread, which is leavened to feed the 5,000; if it were the Passover, it should be called Passover of the Lord not Passover of the Jews.\n\nThose like Michael Rood who claim the correct length of Jesus ministry was 70-weeks2dispute the authenticity on the basis of the difficulties. They claim the passage was added to lengthen the time of Jesus' ministry to fit Eusebius' proposed three-and-one-half years.\n\nPesach Sheni\n\nI believe the answer all the conceptual difficulties is found in the Old Testament:\n\n6 Now there were certain men who were defiled by a human corpse, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron that day. 7 And those men said to him, “We became defiled by a human corpse. Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the children of Israel?” 8 And Moses said to them, “Stand still, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.” 9 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 10 “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If anyone of you or your posterity is unclean because of a corpse, or is far away on a journey, he may still keep the LORD’s Passover. 11 On the fourteenth day of the second month, at twilight, they may keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 12 They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break one of its bones. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it. 13 But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and ceases to keep the Passover, that same person shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of the LORD at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin. 14 ‘And if a stranger dwells among you, and would keep the LORD’s Passover, he must do so according to the rite of the Passover and according to its ceremony; you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger and the native of the land.’ (Numbers 9 NKJV)\n\nThe concern brought to Moses was being defiled by a dead body. The answer authorizing a Passover on the 14th of the second month (Pesach Sheni) added a provision for someone who is unable to observe the Passover in Israel as required in the Law (cf. Deuteronomy 16:1-8).\n\nThe solution to Passover of the Jews which was near is to recognize it is referring to Pesach Sheni, which comes after the barley harvest; does not include avoiding unleavened bread; would not be observed by anyone who had observed the Passover in Jerusalem. Thus, all of the difficulties are removed. In essence, John's Gospel is stating Jews who cannot observe the Passover in Jerusalem should eat the Passover in the second month of the year.\n\nConclusion\n\nA time of Pesach Sheni also fits the timing of the Bread of Life Discourse which John states took place in the synagogue (cf. John 6:59). In other words, if the feeding of the 5,000 took place on Pesach Sheni, the 14th day of the second month, the Bread of Life Discourse was given on the 15th day of the second month:\n\n1 And they journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of Egypt. 2 Then the whole congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. 3 And the children of Israel said to them, “Oh, that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.” 4 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not. 5 And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”\n\n(Exodus 16)\n\nAs can be seen from the manna, the 15th would have been a Sabbath, had the people been observing the Sabbath. Therefore, John's point is the Bread of Life Discourse was given on the same day of the year the LORD promised to feed the people with manna. Moreover, since Jesus' sermon took place in the synagogue, it very likely was the Sabbath.\n\nFinally, the prophetic aspect of Pesach Sheni is that it was preparation for the burial of Jesus. By preparing the body and burying Jesus, Nicodemus and Joseph were defiled, but they would be able to eat the Passover on Pesach Sheni.\n\n1. Michael Rood, The Chronological Gospels: The Acceptable Year of the LORD, The Life and Seventy Week Ministry of the Messiah, Aviv Moon Publishing, 2013, p. 4\n\n2. Ibid.\n\nThere is no valid reason to question the authenticity of John 6:4. The verse appears in all reliable texts. To my knowledge, it has never been found to be omitted from any original texts, unlike John 5:4, for example (I hope you're not confusing these two!), which is not found in the earliest versions of the text and so is believed not to have been written by John and would appear to have been added later.\n\nThe verse you ask about, John 6:4, doesn't teach anything doctrinal, so one might wonder why anyone would even suggest it isn't authentic. However, it does tell us when the events of the chapter occurred - shortly before Passover. The chapter covers Jesus' miracle at Bethsaida, feeding the 5000. This is one miracle that is recorded in all the gospels. Perhaps the reason your friend thinks the verse should not be there is because the gospels record the events of Jesus' life in differing orders, and so John 6:4 placing this miracle at a particular time could be seen as contradicting the other accounts. However, it is understood that the gospels are not meant to be chronological accounts (See Luke 1:3, where the writer points out that he had to research events in order to place them in order). Verses like John 6:4, which appear throughout all the gospels, help us to collate all the events covered by the different writers and place them in a logical, and mostly chronological order. In fact, the verse agrees with Mark's coverage of the same miracle, as Mark 6:39 mentions that the grass was green, indicating that it happened in springtime. If anything, this adds weight to the verse's authenticity, even though it should not have been in question.\n\nThe Gospel of John is the only Gospel that records the major Judean feasts that indicate the times and seasons of the year which transpired during Jesus Christ’s ministry in Palestine. The erroneous interpretation of these feasts has expanded the time of Jesus Christ’s ministry to the traditionally accepted three-and ­one-half years.\n\nJohn 2:13:\n\nAnd the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\n\nIn the first feast (John 2:13—3:21) Jesus is at Jerusalem during the Passover, Nisan 14 (April 10), 27 A.D. This is about two months after his baptism. The next feast (John 5:1-47) shows Jesus at Jerusalem again.\n\nJohn 5:1:\n\nAfter this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\n\nThis feast is not named. Many have guessed that it was Passover. But it could not have been another Passover if the course of Jesus Christ’s ministry covered only a year. In the course of a year, the next major feast following Passover is Pentecost. It is more reasonable to assume that it was Pentecost.\n\nIn John 6:4, the Passover is again mentioned.\n\nAnd the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.\n\nThe surrounding context says nothing about Jesus’ going to Jerusalem for this feast. Yet, every male in Israel was required to go to Jerusalem for Passover in order to fulfill the law. Since Jesus went to all the other feasts as required by law, this inconsistency points to a textual forgery here in verse 4. Greek manuscript 472 and others do not have the verse. Origen, a third-century theologian, omits the word “Passover” when alluding to this verse. Omitting the words “the passover,” as Origen does, the verse reads, “And a feast of the Jews was nigh.”\n\nThe only Judean feast in the late summer for which Jesus would not have to go to Jerusalem was a feast called the Feast of Wood Offering, which was not mentioned in the Old Testament law. This feast occurred yearly on Ab 15 during which the people gathered wood and brought it to the Temple. The origin of the feast is obscure, but it was popular in the first century. In 27 A.D. Ab 15 corresponded with August 7. This was not a major Judean feast, but it was observed by many.\n\nThe absence of a name for the feast in John 6:4 evidently prompted scribes to insert a name later, such as “the Passover,” or the verse was never in the original and was deliberately added by someone wanting to substantiate another Passover during Jesus’ ministry. Its occurrence during the time of Jesus’ feeding the “about five thousand” fits chronologically with the details of his summer ministry in Galilee as recorded in the other Gospels.\n\nThe next major Judean feast that follows the Feast of Wood Offering is the Feast of Tabernacles, which occurred on Tishri 15-22 or October 4-11 in 27 A.D. The events which occurred at the Feast of Tabernacles in 27 A.D. are recorded in John 7:2—10:21.\n\nJohn 7:2 and 10:\n\n2 Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand. . .10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.\n\nThe next feast recorded in John is the Feast of Dedication, Kislev 25 (December 13), 27 A.D.\n\nJohn 10:22:\n\nAnd it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.\n\nThe events at this feast are recorded in John 10:22-39. This feast commemorated the cleansing of the Temple in 164 B.C. during the time of the Maccabees.\n\nThe final feast during Jesus Christ’s ministry was the Passover in 28 A.D., which is recorded in John 12 and following.\n\nJohn 12:1:\n\nThen Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.\n\nThis was the Passover at which Jesus Christ was the Passover lamb. The feasts recorded in the Gospel of John corroborate the one-year ministry of Jesus Christ, the lamb of God.\n\nApproximately two months after Jesus’ baptism, he arrived in Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover, the first feast in the Gospel of John. At this feast, the Judeans told Jesus that the Temple had been under construction for forty-six years. By Judean reckoning on their sacred calendar, this Passover occurred on Nisan 14 (April 10), in 27 A.D. This Passover was also during the year in which Jesus was “about thirty” years old and during the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius.\n\nThe next feast Jesus attended at Jerusalem that year was Pentecost on June 1, after which he began to proclaim the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus was not required by the law to go to Jerusalem for the Feast of Wood Offering, so he stayed in Galilee and continued to minister there. In the fall he went to Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles, so he kept the law by attending each of the three major feasts.\n\nThen he returned to Jerusalem for the Feast of Dedication in December, and finally, once again in Jerusalem for the Passover at which he was crucified. This final Passover began on Wednesday, Nisan 14 (April 28) in 28 A.D. So Jesus Christ fulfilled the law, offering himself without spot or blemish as a lamb of the first year."
