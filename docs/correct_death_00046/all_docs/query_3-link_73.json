Hıristiyanlığın reform dönemi tarihin en ilginç olaylarına tanıklık etmiştir, eşi benzeri olmayan bir hareketliliktir. Reform dönemindeki tartışmalar sadece Hıristiyanlığın değil, seküler dünyanın birçok değer ve hükümleri üzerinde de etkili olmuştur. İç içe geçmiş olan, birbirleriyle çelişkili birçok fikir kimileyin benimsenmiş, kimileyin reddedilmiştir. Kalvin örneğinde olduğu gibi, Luther örneğinde de Hıristiyan bireyin özgürlüğü ilkelere dönmekle kalmıyor, insan doğasının kaçınılmaz bir niteliği olarak özgürlük esarete dönüşüyor. İkisi birbirinin doğal sonucudur.\n\nDoksan Beş Tez'i okuyup değerlendirirken, Katolisizmin konformizmine dikkat edilmesini öneririm. Benim naçizane fikrim, insanlık tarihi konformizm tarihidir, her şey gibi dinleri de daha konforlu hale getirmeye çalışmışız ve çalışıyoruz, reform sürecinde de bunu görüyoruz, Katolisizmin temel ilkelerle çelişen endüljans gibi sonradan Kilise iktidarını perçinleyen uygulamalarına karşı çıkıp sadece Kutsal Kitap ve Tanrı'ya dönmeyi önermek başta batılı alt etmek anlamında mantıklı gelir, ancak ölüm gerçeğiyle yüzleşmekte zorluk çeken insanların terapi ihtiyacını karşılayan uygulamalarla dinin dinamizm kazandığını ve tarih boyunca dinsel dönüşümlerin bu şekilde gerçekleştiğini düşününce batıl ile temel ilkeler arasında tercih yapmanın zorluğu ortaya çıkar. Mühim bir açmaz. Ben çeviriyi yaparken, öncesinde ve sonrasında bu konuya odaklandım. Paylaşayım dedim.\n\nİyi okumalar\n\nMarch 16, 2018\n\nReformu başlatarak dünya tarihine yön veren Martin Luther’in \"Doksan Beş Tez\"ini okuyucuya sunması sebebiyle lütuf olarak tanımlayacağım eser kesinlikle okunması gereken yapıtlardan biri. Yozlaşan kiliselerin endüljans yani bağışlama yetkisiyle para kazanmaya başladığı bu dönemde defalarca susturulmaya çalışan Keşiş Luther’in düşüncelerini ortaya koyuş biçimine hayran kalmamak elde değil. Din adamı olmasına rağmen yapılan yanlışın önünde durarak kiliselerin geri adım atmasını sağlayan Luther’in yazdıkları 1500’lü yıllarda neler yaşandığına ışık tutarken günümüzde de aynı şeyleri yaşıyor olmamız sebebiyle okuyucu da şaşkınlık yaratıyor. Her edebiyat ve sanat severin mutlaka kitaplığında bulunması gereken eserlerden.\n\n07.03.2018\n\nİstanbul, Türkiye\n\nAlp Turgut\n\nhttp://www.filmdoktoru.com/kitap-labo...\n\nAugust 15, 2016\n\nMartin Luther's 95 thesis was an outspoken opposition against the immoral activities of the Catholic Church. These were times when the Church was steeped in corruption and when innocent people's faith was exploited for money hoarding, all in the name of religion.The corruption of the Church merits a book of itself and I suggest you do some research of your own on the subject and my recommendation would be the 'Vicar Of Christ' by Walter F. Murphy, which is an amazing work on the history of the Catholic Church and the papacy.\n\nIn Luther's time salvation was promised to, not the penitent and devout, but to the rich and corrupt who could buy their way to heaven.The pope was the head of the canon law and exerted his dominion, not only on the living, but also reserved penitence to the dead and it was truly believed that getting pardon from the church could ensure one's salvation. Martin Luther opposes this view by stating that the dead are freed from all canonical laws and no one can enter heaven by letters of pardon, but rather, by belief in god and practicing good deeds.He urges the people to come back to the Gospels, the true word of god,and put their faith in Jesus Christ and not on the blessings and hollow pardons of the church.He cautions the people to be wary of the many corrupt practices and of the people who spread such talk and to find their strength in the word of God.\n\nIt is amazing to wonder what courage it took for Martin Luther to write these thesis in times when, even a single word against the pope or the Orthodox Church was considered blasphemous and punishable by death.This work sent shock-waves through the Church and posed a real threat to their core beliefs and practices.The Church knew that if people started following Luther, then their unquestionable belief in the Church would be challenged and this would put the Catholic Church in a very precarious position.It was to mark the beginning of a long ensuing battle between the Catholics and the Protestants.\n\nMarch 12, 2018\n\n\"86. Yine, 'Niçin serveti, zengin Crassus'un servetinden daha büyük olan Papa, biricik Aziz Petrus Bazilikası'nı kendi parasıyla değil de, inançlı fakirlerin parasıyla inşa ediyor?' \"(s.23)\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nDin adamlarının içinde, din adı altında yapılan kokuşmuşlukları ilk çıkaranlardan birinin tezleri. Elbet okunması gereken çalışmalardan. Ne o zamanlarda ne de şimdi işe yarayacak ya da birilerinin bu kokuşmuş sistemi yıkmasına sebebiyet vermeyecek elbet. Fakat yine de bir ümit tadında, bazılarının bir şeyler için uğraştığını görmek adına eşsiz bir başlangıç.\n\nSeptember 11, 2013\n\nReading the statements that Martin included in his 95 affirmations puts it all in perspective; it is unbelievable the state of degradation in which the Catholic Church had fallen during those years. Clearly, from the statements that Martin wrote on his theses, the Catholic Church had become a business where salvation was a matter of money and power, and the Pope along with the entire clergy were corrupted. In fact, the C. Church, by playing on the ignorance of people, started requesting “gifts” for the remission of sins and for salvation, and of course, as one can imagine; the bigger the gift, the greater the pardon. - Completely the opposite of Jesus' teachings; salvation is free and gift from God (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nI could go on all day talking about how the Catholic Church was corrupted, anti-biblical and anathema to the Truth. But, instead, I will leave it to other readers to form their own opinions regarding the Church at that time. However, I will say that having had the chance to study this historical period of time in depth from the European perspective, reading Martin’s words gave me a more complete picture of this Christian man who became a revolutionary for standing up for the truth.\n\nHistory teaches us that many times corruption, hegemony and evil, continue to get worse until someone takes a stand against what is wrong. Martin did just that; he did not succumb to the corruption and power of the Church, but took a stand. I am sure that it would have been easier to comply with the Churches’ rules and be like everyone else. What a man of integrity!\n\nIt is thanks to individuals like Martin, and Rose Parks (1955) that we have certain freedoms in thought, speech, belief, and existence today, and we should not forget how blessed we are for that.\n\nI would encourage all Christians to read these theses.\n\nJune 29, 2016\n\nMartin Luther's 95 Theses was a hydrogen bomb hurled straight at the Papacy. Written right at the time that the Gutenberg printing press was enabling the massive dissemination of dangerous ideas, this short but incendiary argument against the abuses of the Church and its cynical hucksterism turned a minor theologian that Pope Leo once casually dismissed as a drunken German into a lightning rod revolutionary whose excommunication was guaranteed.\n\nWhen Luther wrote it, the Church was spending the money of its parishioners on lavishness with the gusto of the later robber barons and Hollywood hedonists. The popes were sexing it up with similar elan. Church-sanctioned salesmen were rolling wagons from town to town hawking indulgences promising absolution as casually as selling ice cream.\n\nLuther knew all this was a sham, and his 95 theses point-by-point laid out why. I'm not a fan of religion -- Christian Catholicism, Protestantism or otherwise -- or even a fan of Luther, per se, but the man was brave and his argument provocative, and its place in history is important enough to at least give a quick read.\n\n(KevinR@Ky 2016)\n\nDecember 30, 2017\n\nThis was not at all what I was expecting. These thesis caused a schism in the church. They caused an ongoing bloodbath that went on for decades. This was huge! The nailing of these thesis were one of the monumental moments of civilization. I had pictured Martin Luther shouting and waving his hammer about as he nailed them to the door. I had pictured the thesis as:\n\n1) Pope is a liar!\n\nI expected each thesis to show biblically that the Catholic church was not based on the Bible.\n\nbut they were nothing like that. Not at all. I had to read them 4 times to be sure I was understanding what Luther was trying to say. I was shocked.\n\nLuther's only beef was with the sale of indulgences. That's it. His arguments were common sense and not antagonistic towards the pope or the church. He seemed rather polite in his arguments. Such as how the pope would surely prefer you to do good works instead of buying indulgences. Give your money to the poor rather than to the pope, who is already rich. The pope would rather have your prayers than your money.\n\nI was disappointed that Luther didn't really sock it to the corrupt church, but considering the after effects of these polite thesis, he was wise to keep it toned down.\n\nWhat is scary/sad/ confusing is the great Sir Thomas More wrote a scathing rebuttal to these thesis. How is it possible to refute arguments like these?\n\nRead\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nIn all my years as a follower of Christ going to both Catholic mass and Protestant services, it’s high time i finally read this in its entirety\n\n“The Reformation wasn’t exactly a success in the fact that we haven’t had a unified church since then” -Pastor Thomas Nelson, like four hours ago\n\nis what spurred the read, and he’s the first pastor that i’ve heard openly say that sentiment\n\nFebruary 7, 2019\n\nDoksan Beş Tez, aslında bir kitap değil. Doksan beş cümle ya da paragraftan oluşan, birkaç sayfalık, çok kısa bir metin. Aynı yayınevinin başka eserleri için de belirttiğim üzere, kitap boyutuna eriştirmek için yapılan (Latince tam metin dahil) eklemelerle bir kitaba dönüştürülmüş. Google'dan aratarak bu yazıyı çok rahatlıkla bulup okuyabilirsiniz, ille de kitabı satın almanıza gerek yok.\n\nDoksan beş tezin her biri, esasen her iki tarafça tartışmaya açılması istenen görüşlerden oluşuyor. Bir başka deyişle içinde bu tartışmalar yok, sadece tartışılacak konular var. Hal böyleyken bu kitabı okumak başlı başına bir anlam ifade etmiyor. Kaldı ki, temel bir kural olarak, eleştiriyi anlamak için eleştirilenin ne olduğunu önceden bilmek gerekiyor. Katolik uygulaması hakkında bilginiz yoksa bu kitap da size bir şey öğretmeyecektir. Çok çok \"evet, endüljans dağıtmak akla aykırı bir şey zaten\" diyebilirsiniz. Çevirmenin Martin Luther hakkında yazdığı önsöz, doksan beş tezin kendisinden daha öğretici. Sanırım bunu söylemem kafi gelecektir içerik hakkında.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 16, 2012\n\nLuther’s initial theses cut at an important tool of papal power—the papal indulgences. The church had the monopoly on the commodity of forgiveness, and its sale via indulgences was a significant source of revenue for the papacy. Luther marshals reasons against the legitimacy of indulgences by stressing the exclusivity of God’s ability to forgive (Theses 5, 6). The pope is not only powerless to forgive, Luther argued, but he is also powerless to grant assurance via letters of pardon, even though he were to “stake his soul upon it” (Thesis 52). Luther also argues that, in the case of indulgences purchased on behalf of souls already in purgatory, it cannot be known for certain whether they are actually penitent (Theses 10-20). Some, in fact might not want to be released from purgatory (Thesis 29)! People who assume they are forgiven because they have purchased indulgences, Luther asserts, are “condemned eternally, together with their teachers” (Thesis 32).\n\nAnother way in which Luther challenges papal power is by (rightly) attributing the sale of papal indulgences to the greed of the clerics, rather than to their genuine desire for souls to be forgiven of their sins (Thesis 27). Instead of receiving money to forgive people, the pope should instead intercede on their behalf (Theses 26, 48).\n\nLuther further attacks papal power by setting up ethical expectations for him—expectations which he obviously did not fulfill. He stated that if the pope knew what the pardon-preachers were charging, he would sooner let St. Peter’s church burn to the ground then let this practice continue. It was clear to most that the pope’s priorities were not thus ordered. Perhaps most scathing is Luther’s question, “Why does not the pope empty purgatory, for the sake of holy love?”\n\nLuther does not question the belief in purgatory (Thesis 10, et al). He also takes for granted official positions of priesthood as men who are God’s vicars. Further, even at the height of his denunciation of the sale of indulgences, he inserts a concession that the “remission and participation which are granted by the pope are in no way to be despised,” thereby granting legitimacy to these offices and their functions (Thesis 38). Luther’s reference to Mary as “the Mother of God” also smells strongly of Roman Catholicism.\n\nThe Theses were revolutionary in their day primarily because they directly and reasonably challenged the greatest religious force in the world. During a time in which tradition was elevated above the word of God, Luther heightens the importance of Scripture by railing against the practice of spending more sermon time on pardons than on actually preaching the Word (Thesis ). It is also likely that no one before had spoken so boldly about the rank materialism of the church, which valued money above the Gospel (Thesis 62-65).\n\nThe Theses were sufficient to spark the Protestant Reformation because they provided a publicly written rallying point for those who already felt the moral disgust and doctrinal disagreement with the Roman Catholic Church. It was a manifesto of sorts, providing a series of statements concerning how true Christians should believe and behave. The currents of history were already swirling toward this revolution; by publishing the points of difference, this document became the clear voice for the ideas and sentiments of the reformers.\n\nMarch 25, 2009\n\nMany know of Luther's 95 Theses, but few have read them. I decided to read them and I was shocked at how bold he was! Through this book, I learned about the history as to why Luther posted his theses and the impact that it made. He was remarkably bold.\n\nThese are some of my favorite: 3, 23, 24, 27, 28, 32, 43, 44, 45, 53, 54, 62, 86\n\nMy favorite:\n\nThesis 62\n\nThe true treasure of the Church is the Most Holy Gospel of the glory and the grace of God.\n\nNovember 25, 2017\n\nThis is a great resource for those wanting to gain a deeper understanding of the document and the ideas that set the Reformation in motion. I knew the basic facts: Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg, and he was protesting against certain practices and teachings that had arisen within the Catholic Church, such as indulgences and purgatory. This book has given me a greater understanding of the specifics, and in the words of Martin Luther himself, no less!\n\nHowever it’s not only useful for its historical insight. The Bible itself says there is nothing new under the sun, and as I read through this book I was struck by the fact that, although Luther was addressing specific practices of the time, many of his supporting arguments are just as relevant to us today as they were to the church 500 years ago. What is true penitence? In what (or whom) do we place our hope—works or faith? The excerpts here often highlighted to me that we still share the same weaknesses and tendencies as those Luther originally addressed, even if they manifest in different ways in our modern world.\n\nEach ‘chapter’ (one for each thesis point) is relatively short, so this is an ideal resource for those who are looking for something that can be taken in and digested in small bites. I actually think that is the more profitable way to read this as the translation, while eminently readable, is still scholarly in style, and the substance of Luther’s arguments is worth reflecting on.\n\nThe one thing I would say is that I would have preferred a more definite distinction between the words of each of Luther’s theses and the excerpts that followed. It took me a couple of chapters to realise that the first line in each chapter was actually the thesis point, and the text that followed was the excerpt taken from Luther’s other writings. However, that is a very minor detail. I have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone who would like to deepen their understanding of why Luther felt it necessary to stand up to the church leaders of his day.\n\nI received a copy of this book from the publisher. This has not influenced the content of my review, which is my honest and unbiased opinion.\n\nFebruary 15, 2019\n\n\"Enough has been said previously about cross and punishments. Rarely do you hear a sermon about it today.\"\n\n---\n\nWhen I first have read the \"95 Theses...\", which looked like a theological pamphlet, it reminded me of the glossed mottos of the early Iberic medieval literature. It seemed that at least some of those 95 mottos should, somehow, be developed (\"glossed\") in a more comprehensive and didact way. It must have also occurred to Luther, who, by the end of 1518 (just one year after the publication of the Theses), wrote these Explanations in answer to he being summoned to Rome.\n\nAlthough this book have intended to clarify his theological views, in any moment it appears to be an apology for his previously stated opinions. Luther makes sure that his point of view is well-fundamented, displaying his extensive knowledge about both the Holy Book and of the Church's canon and history. Sadly, his argumentative style is somewhat repetitive, exhaustive and it looks like, by the half of the book, that even him is tired of insisting in those few nevralgic points of the Indulgences.\n\nDecember 12, 2019\n\nMartin Luther'in Doksan Beş Tez'ini okudum. Reform Hareketi'nin nasıl doğduğunu ve Martin Luther'i uzun bir süredir merak ediyordum, Martin Luther'in tezlerinin yer aldığı bu kitabın dilimize çevrildiğini öğrenince merak ettiğim şeyleri öğrenmek için bundan daha iyi bir kaynak olmayacağını düşünerek bu kitabı okudum.\n\nKitabın başında aynı zamanda kitabın çevirmeni de olan Cengiz hocanın yazdığı bir önsöz yer alıyor. Bu önsözde Luther'in ve Reform Hareketi'nin geçmişi kısaca özetlenmiş, buradaki bilgiler bu konular hakkında hiçbir şey bilmeyen birisinin bile kitabı rahatça okuyup anlayabilmesi için hazırlandığından oldukça doyurucuydu.\n\nTezleri okuduktan sonra bu tezlerin halk tarafından okunması amacıyla kilise kapısına çivilendiği anlatısının ne kadar gerçekten uzak olduğu anlaşılıyor; çünkü tezler akademik bir dille ve Latince olarak yazılmış. Eğer Luther halkın okumasını isteseydi hem Almanca olarak kaleme alırdı hem de halkın anlayabileceği bir seviyede yazardı tezlerini. Buradan Luther'in ilk etapta bir devrim gibi bir şey yapmaya çalışmadığını ve kilisedeki sorunların kilise içinde çözülmesine inandığı sonucunu çıkarabiliriz.\n\nTezlerin halk tarafından anlaşılamayacağından bahsettim; ama bu kitapta anlaşılması güç kısımlar sonnotta açıklandığı için bizlerin tezleri anlamamak gibi bir sıkıntımız söz konusu değil.\n\nKitabın çevirisinde ve editörlüğünde herhangi bir sıkıntı yoktu. Ayrıca kitapta orjinal metne de yer verilmesi çok güzel olmuş.\n\nJanuary 19, 2010\n\nI suppose it was about time I finally read this. Short, interesting, and to the point. (It did have to fit on a door, after all.) I was surprised to find that, although Luther was concerned with indulgence dealers swindling people out of their money, he was even more concerned with ordinary Christians believing they could get off so easily: “True contrition seeks and loves penalties, but liberal pardons only relax penalties and cause them to be hated…Christians are to be exhorted that they be diligent in following Christ, their Head, through penalties, deaths, and hell; and thus be confident of entering into heaven rather through many tribulations, than through the assurance of peace.” It seems that the problem for Luther wasn’t so much that priests were benefitting financially from the common man’s fear of purgatory, as that they weren’t putting enough fear of purgatory into the common man.\n\nApril 25, 2013\n\nConcise little 12-page booklet containing Luther's 95 bullet-points preaching against particular facets of the catholic church. Namely, paying money to the church to not only absolve you of your sins, but also to give the pope certain powers such as the ability to reduce your time spent in purgatory.\n\nIt should be noted that the pope as well as the church used this scam as a fund-raiser to renovate St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nTruth be told, this read is only so-so for me, but I posthumously give Luther an extra star for publicly standing up to a bunch of scam artists.\n\nBy the way, I know during this era in history we were just getting of the middle ages, but still, how stupid could people have been to believe this?\n\nFebruary 7, 2017\n\nI was hoping for something that gave me insight into Lutheranism. What I have here is a rant. The rant may have valid reasoning, especially for the time, for the misuse of the church and specifically the actions of the Pope. Luther was an interesting man as far as I can see and believed adamantly in change.\n\nStill, I will have to read the Book of Concord to really get a better understanding of his version of the church.\n\nDecember 15, 2012\n\nQuite frankly, should be read to help form your own view on what you believe.\n\nIT's also an important historical piece.\n\nDecember 17, 2015\n\nMost of it is light-touch Popery, but it is still an interesting read. The editor provides a useful introduction and has some good explanatory notes.\n\nNovember 30, 2021\n\n31 October 1517. A man would use a hammer and nail to post a paper on the side door of the Castle Church of Wittenberg, to alert the parish.\n\nPenned in Latin as Disputatio pro declaratione virtutis indulgentiarum (‘95 Theses on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences’), his offering was intended to quick discussion within the Church.\n\nBut it struck a nerve.\n\nMartin Luther was the name ….\n\nWhen Luther nailed a sheet of paper to the church door of a small university town on 31 October 1517, he set off a progression that changed the Western world for ever.\n\nWhether Luther used a nail or a pot of glue will probably never be known for sure, but it is certain that he sent the theses to Archbishop Albrecht, the most important churchman in all Germany, on 31 October.\n\nThe supplementary letter had a tone of outstanding self-confidence, even of egotism.\n\nAfter an submissive opening, it utterly condemned the archbishop’s lack of care for his flock and threatened that if Albrecht did not take action, then ‘someone may rise and, by means of publications, silence those preachers’ who were selling indulgences which promised the buyers time off Purgatory.\n\nLuther wrote a similar letter to his immediate superior, the bishop of Brandenburg, and, more than the posting of the theses in a backwater like Wittenberg, these letters were the provocation which ensured a response.\n\nOne of Luther’s talents, evident even then, was his ability to stage an event, to do something stunning that would get him noticed.\n\n‘Out of love for the truth and from desire to elucidate it,’ he began, ‘the Reverend Father Martin Luther, Master of Arts and Sacred Theology, and ordinary lecturer therein at Wittenberg, intends to defend the following statements and to dispute on them in that place. Therefore he asks that those who cannot be present and dispute with him orally shall do so in their absence by letter.’ Then Luther proceeded to list his 95 theses, one by one.\n\nWhen our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, “Repent” (Mt 4:17), he willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance…’\n\nHis ideas spread like wildfire.\n\nHis attack on the Church soon convulsed Germany, divided Europe and polarised people’s beliefs. His opinions triggered decades of religious persecution, social unrest and war. And in the long run, his ideas paradoxically helped break the grip of religion in every sphere of life.\n\nHis litany attacked officials at all levels of the Catholic Church, alleging a stew of clerical corruption and abuses that included nepotism, usury and the sale of indulgences (defined by the Church as ‘remissions of temporal punishment, especially purgatorial atonement, due for sins after absolution’).\n\nIt also questioned some core Catholic practices and beliefs.\n\nLuther sent copies of his thesis to his bishop and the archbishop who was in charge of the indulgence sales. The fact that many Church officials had resorted to selling indulgences as a means of obtaining financial support made it a touchy subject for anyone to raise, even indirectly.\n\nLuther brazenly alleged that the practice violated the original intention of confession and penance, and rattled off other embarrassing criticisms as well.\n\nWithin a few months his diatribe was being translated into a number of languages and circulated across Europe. Luther’s document sparked the schism within Western Christianity that became known as the Protestant Reformation\n\nBut the man who started the Reformation was deeply flawed. He was a religious fundamentalist, a Jew-hater and a political reactionary.\n\nHe was a fervent believer who was tormented by doubt, a brilliant writer who shaped the German language and a vicious and foul-mouthed polemicist.\n\nHe was a married ex-monk who liberated sexuality from the disgrace of peccadillo, but also a man who insisted that women should know their place.\n\nFor him the Devil was not just a figure of speech but a very real and physical presence.\n\nFor Protestants this document is almost an article of faith that the Reformation began when Martin Luther, the shy monk, nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg on 31 October 1517, the eve of All Saints’ Day, and set in motion a religious revolution that shattered Western Christendom.\n\nFor Luther’s closest collaborator Philipp Melanchthon, to whom we owe the trenchant description of the event, the posting of the theses advanced the restoration of the ‘light of the gospel’. Luther himself liked to celebrate the moment as the beginning of the Reformation, and drank a toast to it with friends later in life.\n\nOne of the most important pieces of paper ever to be written by man!!\n\nNovember 10, 2019\n\nMartin Luther'den Endüljanslara Karşı Çıkış\n\n\"Aziz Petrus'un inşası için, sizin pek seçkin unvanınız altında Papalık endüljansları dağıtılıyor, bu konuda işitmediğim vaizleri bağırdıkları için suçlamıyorum, sadece halkın onlardan tümüyle yanlış anlayışlar edinmesine üzülüyorum, bu anlayışlar avamın her köşesine yayılıyor, örneğin bu zavallı zihinler endüljans belgeleri satın alırlarsa, kendi kurtuluşlarını güvenceye alacaklarına inanıyorlar.\n\nAynı zihinler, bağı sandığına katkı yaptıklarında, Araf'ı uçarak geçeceklerine inanıyorlar, yine endüljansların lütufları öyle büyükmüş ki, sonrasında insanda hiçbir büyük günah kalmıyormuş, hatta(dediklerine göre) hâşâ, biri Tanrı'nın annesinde tecavüz etse, o günah bile bağışlanabilirmiş, aynı şekilde bir kişi endüljanslar aracılığıyla her tür suç ve cezadan kurtulurmuş.\n\n[...]\n\nO halde endüljans vaizleri, uydurulmuş lütuf masalları ve vaatle, insanları nasıl güvence altına alabilir ve korkusuz kılabilir?

C. Cengiz Çevik), Türkiye İş Bankası Kültür Yayınları, s. 2-4.\n\n81. [...] Papa'nın itibarını hareketlere ve elbette laiklerin kesin sorularına karşı savunmasını güçleştirmektedir.\n\n82. Örneğin, \"Papa, bazilikanın inşası gibi oldukça önemsiz bir gerekçeyle, kirli bir para karşılığında sonsuz sayıda ruhun günahını bağışlayabiliyorsa, niçin oldukça haklı bir gerekçeyle, kutsal sevgi ve ruhların nihai ihtiyacını gidermek uğruna Araf'ı boşaltmıyor?\"\n\n[...]\n\n86.

Laiklerin hayli sert bu argümanlarını sadece güç kullanarak bastırmak ve akıl yoluyla çürütmemek, Kilise'yi ve Papa'yı düşmanlarının gözünde gülünç duruma düşürmek ve Hristiyanları mutsuz etmektedir.\n\nMartin Luther, Doksan Beş Tez, (Çev.

Martin Luther bu anlayışa karşı çıkmaktadır.\n\nDecember 1, 2017\n\nWith the recent 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's posting \"The 95 Theses\" on the Wittenberg Castle Church door, I have wanted to better understand how his ideas led to the Reformation. This brief book is a fascinating look at those claims and how Luther continued to flesh out his beliefs; each chapter is only a couple pages long, consisting of the individual statement and then a short excerpt from Luther's writings that help to explain why Luther felt as he did.\n\nI love that the editors use Martin Luther's own writings to explain the arguments he was making and help us better understand his objections to how the Catholic church was operating, giving us original source material. Sometimes it was a bit unclear to me how the argument was supported by the writings that followed it, but I am inclined to believe that the problem in understanding was my own.\n\nI did struggle with the older, more formal language at first, but once I became accustomed to it, it did get easier to process. And the short length of the chapters acts as built-in breaks for further study or reflection, which helped me sort out some of my thoughts too. It's strange how reading Luther's own words could be both a plus and a minus to the same reader, but 500 years later and processed through a translation, maybe that’s something to be expected.\n\nMy favorite portions of this book are Luther's often quoted assertions that salvation is through Christ alone, by believing in Him for the remission of sins, not by purchased indulgences or otherwise obtained papal forgiveness. I also appreciated the section (43) where he talks about the assurance we can have of our salvation; it is encouraging that the doubts we sometimes experience as believers today are nothing new within the scope of history and that God within us confirms that we belong to Him, giving us markers to look at along the way for further surety.\n\nThis is a great resource for anyone interested in the history of the church, specifically the Reformation. It requires thought and effort but was well worth the time I took to better understand why I believe as I do, and how those doctrines were shaped so long ago.\n\nI received a copy of this book from the publisher through Celebrate Lit. I was not required to post a positive review and the thoughts expressed are both honest and my own.\n\nJanuary 26, 2021\n\nYeah, I know, I know. The family in which I grew up viewed Luther as a damned massive hero with few equals or betters. That said, while I'm not Catholic, I've always viewed Luther as little more than an SOB with some potentially good intentions that got f*ckedup by others -- if I'm feeling generous toward him -- because without Luther, no protestantism and without that, no Calvin or Knox and without them, far fewer (maybe none!) so called \"evangelicals\" or fundies (which to me, after the past year plus, no longer has any meaning for me except for \"hypocritical white nationalist terrorist,\" ie., the American Taliban, and there is literally no difference between them and radical Muslims, they pose the greatest threat to the US and the world and they obviously sold their souls -- if they ever had any -- to back one of the world's worst humans EVER, making excuses all the time for which they would have fucking CRUCIFIED Obama or Clinton or hell, even Reagan these days. He DID raise taxes 8 times, after all. Not only are they evil, f*ckedup genocidal lying white nationalists intent on turning the US into an evangelical theocracy (like Iran, or in the past, Afghanistan, etc.), but they no longer even bother to make a pretense about giving a shit about their holy book, and that's even the few who have read it or know it or about it since most of them are brainwashed into AVOIDING the Bible and instead having lovely little daily devotionals with a positive verse or so in them, as well as a positive passage at church, and their leaders do this intentionally to keep the sheeple from reading about the fact that there are TWO creation stories in Genesis, so which to believe and why, or to see the absurdity of the 5th book of \"Moses\" or to read Joshua and of its 42++ literal genocides led by or commanded by their god or any number of things (like the fact that there are no recorded ANYTHING by or of Jesus by an eyewitness, so those red lines in the bibles are total horseshit cause the unknown educated GREEK writers who decades or more later allegedly wrote the four gospels (out of dozens) that church leaders decided 300 years later to include in the Bible had NOTHING to work with, had never met him or possibly anyone who had met him at all, stole so much from Mark, yet with so many unanswerable questions that scholars have resorted to a \"Q\" theory, in that so much is left out of the \"history,\" yet is allegedly known that there MUST have been another source (ah, the scientific method...) so they named him/her/it/? \"Q,\" which sounds rather disturbing in light of events of the past year, so putting aside all of the discrepancies, inconsistencies, at times total disagreement on their respective stories (resurrection story, ascension story, etc.), and outright lies (zombies walking about Jerusalem, massive earthquakes on the day of his death, neither of which have ANY independent or scientific evidence in which to support those assertions), and so on, that just like I've always viewed Paul as a power hungry deranged madman who, like LR Hubbard to some degree, decided to make up some religion about a dude he never met -- EXCEPT via an alleged vision which no one else could see, verify, etc., so we've all had to take his word on it for thousands of years, and visions DON'T COUNT! -- despite the fact that Jesus -- who he refers to almost NEVER in terms of his life and certainly his pre-crucifixion life, if at all, and whose alleged efforts to go to Jerusalem to actually win people like Peter and James over to his evangelical cause were met with total resistance until he basically told them to shove it, what did they know (aside from the notion they were the only people actually QUALIFIED to know what their messiah have actually have said, would have taught and wanted or not wanted and the fact is, to the best most can make out, Jesus NEVER wanted to create a new religion, certainly not named after him, and in point of fact, he was a Jew first and foremost, and he remained a Jew and toward the end of his career, he told his disciples to go out and (evangelize) to the JEWS ONLY and NOT the Gentiles, yet Paul -- who knew he knew best -- decided to ignore that, ignore the remaining disciples of Jesus, and tell everyone this Christ wanted Paul to take the \"good news\" to the Gentiles! Yay!\n\nHorseshit! Aside from getting off track there, Luther did one right in wanting average people to get actual exposure to the Bible in words they could understand, yet again because of him, owe have Calvinists like me and millions of others whose lives were fucked up from birth, who have had to get therapy for their entire lives -- if they didn't kill themselves first -- who have been among the most evil, hypocritical, etc., etc., in history, la, la, la. I could go on, but my hatred for Luther and all he wrought would keep me writing for days and none of us would benefit from that. For those who want to review a major historical event, grudgingly recommended. For those who do NOT want to support the evil, lying, killing, guilt-inducing, hellfire and damnation, etc., that this SOB is responsible for, NO book on him, including this, would EVER be recommended by me, and as far as I'm concerned you'd be better of reading de Sade, Crowley, whatever, cause at this point, I trust Lavay's stupid BS satantic bible more than anything any of these evil jokes ever put out!"
