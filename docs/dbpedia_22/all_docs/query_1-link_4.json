        "text": "The multituberculates are an extinct order of nontherian, mostly Mesozoic mammals, the largest order of the subclass Prototheria (which also includes triconodonts and monotremes). They were the longest lived mammalian order, originating in the Rhaetic (latest Triassic) and surviving into the early Oligocene, and were the ecological equivalents of modern small rodents, at least in the Cretaceous and Early Teritiary. For a review of the group, see Clemens and Kielan-Jaworowska (1979).\n\nThey are relatively common fossils, which is reasonable in view of their ecological role as small herbivores, and are taxonomically diverse. As a result of this diversity and their rapid evolution, they are stratigraphically useful. However, most species of multituberculates are generally recovered as loose teeth; preserved skulls and jaws are rare except in Mongolia. They are known from North America and Europe (which were a single continent until the early Eocene) in the uppermost Triassic to the lower...\n\nRights and permissions\n\nReprints and permissions\n\nCopyright information\n\nÂ© 1979 Dowden, Hutchinson & Ross, Inc.\n\nAbout this entry\n\nCite this entry\n\nSloan, R.E.
