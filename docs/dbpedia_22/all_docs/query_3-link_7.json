        "text": "Dromaeosauroides was a dromaeosaurid from the Early Cretaceous of Denmark.\n\nIt is one of the first known dinosaurs to be found in Denmark and currently only two teeth have been known of this animal, one found in 2000 and another tooth found much later in 2008 with the animal first been described as a new genus and species in 2003 by Christiansen and Bonde.\n\nSome bigger fossils of Nuthetes from the Lulworth Formation might belong to Dromaeosauroides, however the animal is unlikely to be related to Dromaeosaurus albertensis due to the fact that D. bornholmensis and D. albertensis live at separate times.\n\nTime Travel Bornholm (2005)[]\n\nHistory and Design\n\nBlue-gray scales with orange feathers (likely based off of a model found inside the museum where this documentary was shown)\n\nRole\n\nDromaeosauroides is first seen taking down a Sunnyodon. After killing the little mammal, the dromaeosaur picks it up before spotting another one of its kind. The other Dromaeosauroides looks and starts hissing at the camera before the scene changes to a segment in the Jurassic.\n\nInaccuracies\n\nThe feather covering on the model is far too minimal, resembling a covering of short fur. Despite only being known from teeth, it's possible to infer from relatives that the real animal would have had similar feathering to other dromaeosaurs, meaning that it would have been almost completely covered in feathers and would have possessed feathered wings and a tail fan. The model's arms are also pronated, a position which would have been impossible for the real animal to make.\n\nCultural Significance\n\nThis documentary was the first time that Dromaeosauroides had been featured in paleomedia.\n\nDinosaurs on Bornholm/Dinosaurer p√• Bornholm (2013)[]\n\nHistory and Design\n\nTan scales with brown feathers.\n\nRole\n\nA Dromaeosauroides is first seen stalking two people digging for fossils. After waiting for a few minutes, it charges towards them before the screen goes black.\n\nAlthough Dromeosauroides likely has more of a larger role in this documentary it is a DK exclusive, only airing on Danish TV on the program known as Viden on DR2, meaning that it has yet to be seen outside of Denmark. Thus, the rest of its role in the documentary is unclear for now.\n\nInaccuracies\n\nThe feathering does not not cover the head as it would on the real animal. In addition, the model's nostrils seem to be set far way too high up on the head.\n\nCultural Significance\n\nThis documentary served as the first depicition of Dromaeosauroides in a made-for-TV documentary.\n\nTrivia[]"
