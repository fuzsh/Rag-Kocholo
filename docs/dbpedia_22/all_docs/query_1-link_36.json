        "meta_description": "A cladistic analysis of relationships among forty-nine multituberculate taxa was conducted using dental and cranial characters, resulting in a strict consensus tree with a resolution of 66%. Despite the importance of multituberculates as major components of many Mesozoic and early Tertiary faunas, the evolutionary relationships among these mammals have remained poorly understood. To address this issue, a cladistic analysis of relationships among forty-nine multituberculate taxa was conducted using dental and cranial characters. This analysis resulted in a strict consensus tree with a resolution of 66%. The relatively low level of resolution in this tree seems largely to be a result of including incompletely known taxa in the analysis. Sequential addition analyses (in which taxa were added to the analysis in order of decreasing completeness) indicated that even the most incomplete taxa preserve information important for understanding multituberculate relationships. Sequentially deleting such taxa provided a method for testing the stability of observed clades.",

        "text": "The Importance of Fossils in Phylogeny Reconstruction\n\nM. DonoghueJ. DoyleJ. Gauthier\n\nBiology\n\nIt is widely believed that fossils are of fundamental importance in reconstructing phylogeny and \"fossils provide the soundest basis for evolutionary classification\", but it is often noted that conclusions are necessarily tenuous in their absence.\n\nAMNIOTE PHYLOGENY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF FOSSILS\n\nJ. GauthierA. KlugeT. Rowe\n\nBiology\n\nThe importance of the critical fossils seems to reside in their relative primitive‐ness, and the simplest explanation for their more conservative nature is that they have had less time to evolve.\n\nRedescription of Hypsidoris farsonensis (Teleostei: Siluriformes), with a reassessment of its phylogenetic relationships\n\nL. Grande\n\nBiology, Geology\n\nA redescribed Hypsidoris farsonensis from the Eocene Green River Formation of Wyoming is interpreted not to belong in Ictaluridae as originally proposed, and to be the sister group to all known catfish families other than Diplomystidae.\n\nPrismatic enamel in multituberculate mammals: tests of homology and polarity\n\nD. KrauseS. Carlson\n\nBiology\n\nIt is concluded that each prism type is homologous in all multituberculates in which it occurs because of its consistency with non-ultrastructural characters used to construct the cladogram, and the hypothesis that large, arc-shaped prisms represent the derived condition within multitubculates should be rejected.\n\nSkull morphology of Lambdopsalis bulla (Mammalia, Multituberculata) and its implications to mammalian evolution\n\nMiao DesuiD. W. BoydJ. Lillegraven\n\nBiology\n\nThe skull morphology of Lambdopsalis shows phylogenetic unity with taeniolabidids, and invalidates the hypothesis of fundamental nontherian/therian dichotomy, and cranial characters coupled with dental features document monophyly for nonharamiyid multituberculates.\n\nEnamel Ultrastructure of Multituberculate Mammals: An Investigation of Variability\n\nS. CarlsonD. Krause\n\nBiology\n\nA review of Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary multituberculates reveals remarkable consistency in ultrastructural type at the subordinal level and compares various modes of preparation used to reveal ultrastructureural patterns.\n\nToward a Phylogenetic Classification of the Mammalia\n\nM. Mckenna\n\nBiology\n\nThis short paper attempts to update certain aspects of my previous review by taking into account research published since 1969, as well as work being incorporated into a new classification of the Mammalia now being prepared which wall deal with all taxonomic levels down to the subgeneric level in essentially the same style as Simpson’s (1945) classification.\n\nEarly Cretaceous multituberculates from Mongolia and a comparison with Late Jurassic forms\n\nZ. Kielan‐JaworowskaD. DashzevegB. Trofimov\n\nGeology\n\nKIELAN-JAWOROWSKA, Z., DASHZEVEG, D. and TROFIMOV, B. A.: Early Cretaceous multituberculates from Mongolia and a comparison with Late Jurassic forms. Acta Palaeont. Polonica, 38, 1-2, 3-47, 19&7. A…\n\nPATTERNS OF VARIATION IN LEVELS OF HOMOPLASY\n\nM. SandersonM. Donoghue\n\nBiology\n\nEvolution; international journal of organic…\n\nThere is no significant difference between plant and animal data sets in the amount of homoplasy when the relationship between consistency index and number of taxa is taken into account, although there are still too few molecular studies to be confident of this result."
