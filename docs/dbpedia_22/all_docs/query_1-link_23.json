        "text": "We describe a Cretaceous ?cimolodontan multituberculate p4 from South America, for which we erect the new genus and species Argentodites coloniensis. This new taxon is represented by an isolated ?left p4, from the Upper Cretaceous (?Campanian or Maastrichtian) La Colonia Formation of Patagonia (Fig. 1). It has a strongly convex anterior margin and prismatic enamel, which attest to its cimolodontan nature, while the previously known p4 (MACN−RN 975), described by Kielan−Jaworowska and Bonaparte (1996) from the Late Cretaceous Los Alamitos Formation is roughly rectangular, sug− gesting \"plagiaulacidan\" affinity. The presence of normal prismatic enamel in Argentodites suggests similarities to Ptilodontoidea. However, it differs from the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene Laurasian cimolodontans (including Ptilodontoidea) in having a long, straight posterior margin, a nearly straight dorsal margin, characteristic of some \"Plagiaulacida\", and in having the lingual side close to the mirror image of the labial side, the character, which poses diffi− culties in establishing whether it is right or left. Because of these differences we assign Argentodites to ?Cimolodonta, tentatively only, superfamily and family incertae sedis.\n\n2009. An Australian multituberculate and its palaeobiogeo− graphic implications. Acta Palaeolontologica Polonica 54 (1): 1–6. A dentary fragment containing a tiny left plagiaulacoid fourth lower premolar from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) of Vic− toria provides the first evidence of the Multituberculata from Australia. This unique specimen represents a new genus and species, Corriebaatar marywaltersae, and is placed in a new family, Corriebaataridae. The Australian fossil, together with meagre records of multituberculates from South America, Africa, and Madagascar, reinforces the view that Multituberculata had a cosmopolitan distribution during the Mesozoic, with dispersal into eastern Gondwana probably occurring prior to enforcement of climatic barriers (indicated by marked differentiation in regional floras) in the Early Cretaceous.\n\nMultituberculates, though among the most commonly encountered mammalian fossils of the Mesozoic, are poorly known from the North American Early Cretaceous, with only one taxon named to date. Herein we describe Argillomys marylandensis , gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous of Maryland, based on an isolated M2. Argillomys represents the second mammal known from the Arundel Clay facies of the Patuxent Formation (Lower Cretaceous: Aptian). Though distinctive in its combination of characters (e.g., enamel ornamentation consisting of ribs and grooves only, cusp formula 2:4, presence of distinct cusp on anterobuccal ridge, enlargement of second cusp on buccal row, central position of ultimate cusp in lingual row, great relative length), the broader affinities of Argillomys cannot be established because of non-representation of the antemolar dentition. Based on lack of apomorphies commonly seen among Cimolodonta (e.g., three or more cusps present in buccal row, fusion of cusps in lingual row, cusps strongly pyramidal and separated by narrow grooves), we provisionally regard Argillomys as a multituberculate of “plagiaulacidan” grade. Intriguingly, it is comparable in certain respects to some unnamed Paulchoffatiidae, a family otherwise known from the Late Jurassic – Early Cretaceous of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe enamel microstructure of the molariform cheek teeth of Vintana sertichi (Gondwanatheria, Mammalia) from the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar retains many of the plesiomorphic characteristics of mammalian prismatic enamel (e.g., single-layered schmelzmuster; non-decussating, small prisms). However, V. sertichi exhibits a relatively derived condition and resembles Lavanify miolaka (Late Cretaceous, Madagascar), Bharattherium bonapartei (Late Cretaceous, India), and an indeterminate sudamericid (Late Cretaceous, Madagascar) in possessing modified radial enamel, consisting of prisms separated by prominent interrow sheets of interprismatic matrix. A second group of gondwanatherians (Ferugliotherium windhauseni, Gondwanatherium patagonicum, Sudamerica ameghinoi, Greniodon sylvaticus), all from the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene of Argentina, retains relatively primitive, ‘normal’ radial enamel, in which the interprismatic matrix anastomoses around the prisms and does not form interrow sheets. The prisms of gondwanatherian molariforms generally become wider from the enamel-dentine junction to the outer enamel surface, dramatically so in Gondwanatherium. Seams are very rare; tubules are more common. Prism decussation has not been found in any gondwanatherian enamel. Gondwanatherian molariforms lack or have only a thin layer of external prismless enamel, although it is thick in the incisors of Sudamerica. Despite their apparent utility in differentiating among gondwanatherian taxa, or gondwanatherians as a whole from other clades, many of the derived characteristics of gondwanatherian enamel microstructure are found in other mammalian groups and may reflect a high degree of homoplasy.\n\nIn addition to four isolated mammalian teeth from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Madagascar described previously and allocated to Gondwanatheria, Marsupialia, and Mammalia incertae sedis, here I put on record five more specimens. Four of these, a virtually complete lower molariform cheek tooth, two fragmentary cheek teeth, and a fragmentary lower incisor, are referred to the Sudamericidae (Gondwanatheria). The internal structure of the hypsodont cheek teeth, as revealed by micro-computed tomography scans to simulate different stages of wear, is highly variable. Limited knowledge of intra-individual morphological and size variability in the dentition of sudamericids, which are known almost exclusively from isolated teeth, precludes a conclusive assessment of whether some or all of the new specimens belong to Lavanify miolaka, the only previously described sudamericid from Madagascar, or to a new taxon. Conservatively, therefore, pending the recovery of better material, all four specimens are referred to Sudamericidae gen. et sp. indet. The fifth specimen, a molar fragment, is tentatively allocated to the Multituberculata, thereby adding to the controversial specimens that comprise the very sparse and questionable record of this clade on the southern supercontinent Gondwana. The new specimens do not provide any profound insight into the origins of the highly endemic and imbalanced extant mammalian fauna on Madagascar; rather, they provide only more negative evidence. Like those previously described, they do not represent the basal stocks of any of the five mammalian clades that live on the island today and therefore further support the growing consensus that representatives of the extant clades arrived in the Cenozoic."
