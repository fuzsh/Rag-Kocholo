We see them scampering through moonlit forests capturing insects, tearing apart fruits from early flowering plants, sometimes lapping nectar, and universally marking their territories with diverse body exudates. We think of them as denizens of a world much different from ours of today. The food chains of their generally warmer ecosystems are seen to be capped by dinosaurs, crocodiles, and birds, all of which were foraging within forests and shrub lands with wholly different floral compositions from ours, or across muddy and rocky landscapes devoid of grass. The Mesozoic continents themselves are observed to be markedly different in relative positions and shoreline configurations, and in the locations of plains and mountain belts. Usually we see much greater areas covered by shallow inland seas than exist today. We can picture broad diversification of reproductive modes among these mammals, with a range including egg-laying, marsupial-like patterns, and early permutations of prolonged internal development. We observe much more of a “sameness” among the mammals of the Mesozoic than today. For example, we miss great beasts having horns, tusks, fins, or bony armor. We also miss the almost ubiquitous modern diversity of rodents and bats. In our present view of all these general features of primary biological importance, little has been altered conceptually since the predecessor of this book was published in 1979. Imaginary, time-viewing machines are only coarsefocus devices.When we look broadly at the diversity of studies done since 1979 using the fossil record itself, we are struck by the magnitude of paleobiological progress in un-\n\nderstanding the roles of mammals in Mesozoic ecosystems. Particularly important has been extensive new documentation of evolutionary changes in macrofloras, insects, and other terrestrial invertebrates, which in turn have led to tests of hypotheses on their Mesozoic coevolution with mammals. Analyses of fossil plants also suggest greater degrees of climatic differentiation along latitudinal gradients during the age of reptiles than had been visualized before. Sophisticated analyses have documented changing compositions of total vertebrate faunas, especially for latest Cretaceous and earliest Cenozoic time in North America. Important, too, have been discoveries of a variety of mammals of moderate body size, members of a few species perhaps reaching masses of 20–30 kg; the earlier picture of almost universally minuscule mammals must be modified, at least a little, across the sweep of Mesozoic time. And, oh-my, have there ever been expansions in the taxonomic detail and biological complexities applied to understanding evolution of these little animals! As one would expect following a quarter-century of research, the alpha-level diversity of known kinds (especially at the generic level) of Mesozoic mammals has skyrocketed. There have also been some big surprises, such as the discovery of Cretaceous mammals in South America having dentitions that look like they belonged in the Miocene, tribosphenic molars from Malagasy Jurassic strata, and haramiyid teeth attached to jaws from Greenland. The listing of names applied to cladistically based higher categories sounds progressively more exotic, including such grand terms as mammaliamorphans, gondwanatheres, and australodelphians. Probably much more importantly, some of the geographic and temporal chasms that charac-\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nForeword terized the sampling of Mesozoic mammals, although still yawning, have been narrowed significantly. Especially important faunal components have been discovered on the southern continents, in several parts of Asia, at multiple pinpoints in the realm of the Arctic, and even in new areas of eastern and western North America. The high degree of isolation of Southern versus Northern Hemisphere mammalian faunas and the biogeographically complex subdivisions of these regions are starting to emerge. Despite the wealth of new taxonomic detail, however, we remain in a position analogous to that of explorers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries: Anywhere we do new fieldwork outside the realms of the “known paleontological world” we invariably discover new and wondrous fossils that serve mainly to show us how little we really know about the evolution of mammals during the Mesozoic Era. The study of Mesozoic mammals continues to be dominated by examination of dentitions. That bias is changing rapidly, however. More and more workers are honing their broader anatomical skills in the realization that greater progress in understanding adaptive radiations and relationships among early mammals will be gained using new details from cranial and postcranial skeletons. Despite our best efforts, however, discoveries of high-quality articulated skeletal remains of Mesozoic mammals continue to be extraordinarily rare. But once discovered, difficulties of their study related to anatomical complexity, small size, and hard rocks are being circumvented by spectacular advances in graphical technology. Key among these procedures is nondestructive study via high-resolution computerized tomographic imaging of fossils still encased in their original geologic vestments. To our personal delight, these forms of innovative technology are leading to a renaissance in anatomical expertise. Once again it is becoming essential for mammal-oriented paleontologists to really know skeletal anatomy—and its functional implications. Since 1979, enormous strides in developmental biology have been made in understanding how morphological change and evolutionary innovation comes to be. A quarter-century ago knowledge among paleontologists of homeobox genes, distribution of their highly conserved subsets among disparate lineages of multicellular animals, and relationships of epigenetic properties to morphogenesis was nonexistent. Moreover, much greater appreciation for the ubiquity of homoplasy among mammals has developed since 1979, as recognized from more detailed study of the fossil record itself. All that is good for the discipline of paleontology from an intellectual point of view. Now, however, the realization that macroevolutionary jumps in morphology can have simple genetic causes and that homoplasia has a very high probability of occurring, in combination with awareness of the persistence of mul-\n\ntitudinous gaps within the fossil record, is making the task of distinguishing phylogenetic relatedness from parallel evolution among early mammals all the more difficult. The quality of our cladograms can be only as good as our ability to recognize similarities derived from homoplasia. It is actually difficult for us to repress a real sense of pessimism at this point, despite the hugely enhanced appreciation for the diversity of Mesozoic mammals. To add to the difficulty just noted, we see other analytical problems emerging, which might be thought of as kinds of “Lagerstätte effects.” For example, since 1979 important phylogenetic analyses have been developed, but these were restricted to mammalian taxa known from more than dentitions. Most of these studies emphasized mammals known exclusively from brief intervals of Rhaeto-Liassic, Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous, and very Late Cretaceous time. Exclusion from such studies of taxa known only by dentitions has been excused through special pleading related to problems resulting from missing data in cladistic analyses. But the effects upon interpretations of these analyses resulting from loss of data through exclusion of “dental” taxa have not been clearly acknowledged. Another variety of “Lagerstätte effect” might be seen in recently completed statistical analyses of diversity based upon available samples in museum collections. These studies have tended to conclude that we already know about most of the taxonomic diversity that existed among Mesozoic mammals. We predict that another quartercentury of fieldwork will show that conclusion is far from the truth. The present book represents a greatly needed summary and updating of new knowledge about early mammalian history. Such a compendium can be especially useful in suggesting where the most glaring gaps remain within the story of Mesozoic mammals. For example, despite the wealth of newly discovered genera and their taxonomic interpretations, it is clear that the times and places of origin of almost all of the major groups remain unknown. Moreover, we are far from having achieved stable taxonomic schemes for mammals in general—or even for relationships within the major orders, Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The continuing uncertainty surrounding affinities of multituberculates is an especially telling example. Even the Mesozoic roots for almost any of the Cenozoic orders of mammals remain elements of uncertainty and lend continuing opportunity for productive discussion. Rather consistently, interpretations of the ages of known fossils suggest markedly younger origins of major groups than those estimated from molecular evidence drawn from living representatives. Why do these important discrepancies exist? Do they simply reflect artifacts caused by stratigraphic gaps and other weaknesses of the fossil record? Or could they\n\nForeword perhaps derive from flaws in assumptions underlying molecular-clock methodology? To this point, recent advances in knowledge of Mesozoic mammalian diversification have allowed better recognition of discrepancies between the two methods—but not confidence in understanding their origins. Where can paleontologists do the greatest good in strengthening the evidence upon which new analyses will depend? In two words, more fieldwork. There probably is more paleontological fieldwork being done per unit time now than in earlier days. But we also suggest that, relative to the comparatively huge number of active paleontologists, the proportion of effort being committed to hardcore field exploration for Mesozoic mammals is painfully small. As a first step, we need additional fossils, especially those including skeletons, from new places and from previously unsampled geologic intervals. We have to find more fossil localities kindred to the abundance of the Welsh fissures, Como Bluff, or Lance Creek, and at least some of them need to have the taphonomic excellence in preservation of skeletal remains of Guimarota, Liaoning, or many sites in Mongolia. Extraordinary localities must exist out there somewhere, just waiting for our enhanced efforts toward discovery. Perhaps of equal importance to the discovery of new mammalian fossils is the study of stratigraphic and tapho-\n\nnomic contexts in which the fossils are preserved. As has become almost commonplace within selected Tertiary strata, applications of a diversity of geochemical analyses involving stable isotopes hold great promise within terrestrial Mesozoic sequences for recognition of progressive and short-term paleoclimatic changes that result in new opportunities for chemostratigraphic correlation. The sampling of Mesozoic mammal-bearing strata for associated fossils of ancient plants remains another activity deserving of greater focus. But our main point is that future progress in genuinely understanding Mesozoic mammals depends upon studying the rocks and the fossils they entomb in new and innovative ways. That requires tedious, risky, energyconsuming field exploration followed by comparably difficult work in the laboratory—not the writing of additional reviews of evidence gathered from literature or existing contents of museum cases. So what of value is left for future generations to learn about Mesozoic mammals? Again in two words, almost everything. This book provides both a milestone marking current progress in our understanding of these wonderful beasts and a starting line of challenges for future research. Jason A. Lillegraven and William A. Clemens\n\nix\n\nPREFACE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe last (and only) general book on Mesozoic mammals, edited by Jason A. Lillegraven, Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, and William A. Clemens, appeared in 1979. The need for an updated compendium on the subject has been clear for some time. Our basic source of information—a fossil record comprised of unbelievably tiny, delicate, and elusive fossils—has expanded by orders of magnitude over the past quarter-century. New specimens, some of them breathtakingly complete, have poured in from almost all parts of the globe. These discoveries, together with the application of new scientific approaches and techniques, have led to profound changes in our interpretation of early mammalian history—changes that are coming about at a greater pace today than ever before. Primary interest in the subject itself has grown considerably. Perhaps more significantly, however, Mesozoic mammals have come into their own as an important, rich source of information for evolutionary biology in general. Their record of episodic, successive radiations speaks to the pace and mode of evolution. Early mammals were small, but they provide key information on the morphological transformations that led to modern mammals, including our own lineage of Placentalia. Early mammals were significant and often rapidly evolving elements of the terrestrial biota for much of the Mesozoic—biota that are playing an increasingly important role in studies of paleoecology, faunal turnover, and historical biogeography. Finally, of course, the record of early mammals occupies center stage when it comes to testing molecular evolutionary hypotheses on the timing and sequence of mammalian radiations.\n\nGiven this proliferation of new information and multidisciplinary interest in Mesozoic mammals, it is not surprising that compilation of this volume was both an exciting and a humbling experience for us. We quickly found that we had given ourselves far too much credit when it came to knowledge of the subject matter. Along the way, we encountered some critical topics where additional first-hand experience was needed; in other cases, we ran into unresolved problems that would have to be faced if the book was to be completed. This led us to undertake several collateral studies, the most important of which were published as Kielan-Jaworowska et al. (1998), KielanJaworowska and Hurum (2001), Luo, Cifelli, and KielanJaworowska (2001), Kielan-Jaworowska, Cifelli, and Luo (2002), and Luo et al. (2002). Work on these projects inevitably delayed completion of the book, as did the pace of discovery and conceptual change itself. No sooner had a chapter been drafted, for example, when a new discovery or phylogenetic analysis would require its complete revision. But change is a measure of vitality, and we are convinced that the study of mammalian evolution is not only vitally alive, but that it is poised at the edge of paradigm shift. This is, perhaps, the most exhilarating time in history for students of early mammals, and there is no doubt that monumental changes will await a future volume that succeeds this one. In the meantime, we hope that our book will stimulate and foster those changes and that it might ultimately help sow the seeds of its own obsolescence.\n\nB O O K C O N T E N T S A N D F O R M AT\n\nWe (see photo above) have endeavored to make this book as comprehensive as possible, within practical limitations.\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nPreface Of the 15 chapters that follow, four (chapters 1–3 and 15) are of a general nature and apply to the full spectrum of early mammals, whereas the remaining 11 chapters deal with the anatomy, paleobiology, and systematics of the particular groups of mammals known from the Mesozoic, extinct and extant. In chapter 1, we provide some general background on mammals within the context of nonmammalian synapsids; on the successive radiations, biology, and ecological roles of mammals during their tenure of 155 million years (Ma) in the Mesozoic; on the history of study, including a summary of major advances in the past two decades; and on major conceptual issues, past and present. Chapter 2,“Distribution,” presents an account of Mesozoic mammals in space and time, summarizing their geological and geographical occurrences worldwide. Localities (or, in the case of local faunas, core areas) are plotted on generalized maps, and brief descriptions cover fossil yield, preservation, and diversity for each locality. Faunal lists are summarized in tables that include each site, and synoptic charts show the distribution of sites in time through the Mesozoic, continent-by-continent. The nature and amount of contextual information for published occurrences of Mesozoic mammals is highly variable; where possible, we have tried to give a brief account of depositional context and possible paleoenvironment. Finally, we comment briefly on any patterns of distribution, in both space and time, and their potential implications. Chapter 3, “Origin of Mammals” provides an in-depth look at one of the fundamental aspects of mammalian evolution: their origin from among the nonmammalian synapsids. Using a phylogenetic and functional perspective, we treat each major anatomical system in the skull and postcranial skeleton, addressing the evolution of mammal-like characters among advanced cynodonts, appearance of mammalian characters at the cynodontmammal transition, and transformation of character complexes among the earliest mammals. Finally, chapter 15, “Interrelationships of Mesozoic Mammals,” gives a summary of the phylogenetic relationships among the individual groups of early mammals covered by the 11 systematic survey chapters. We discuss the often controversial relationships among the principal groups of mammals (illustrated by two alternative trees) and present a synthetic phylogeny that incorporates the full range of diversity among Mesozoic mammals, together with a sampling of the major living groups—monotremes, marsupials, and placentals. This chapter is based largely on the morphological data we have collected from all these Mesozoic mammal groups through our own observations and from the literature, as summarized in our recent study (Luo et\n\nal., 2002) and incorporates the results of a new parsimony analysis that includes additional taxa. Mammalian phylogeny is the principle we have abided by for the book’s organization. The sequence of the remaining 11 systematic survey chapters of major kinds of Mesozoic mammals follows the mammalian family tree presented in chapter 15. Each systematic survey chapter on a given group of Mesozoic mammals includes a brief characterization, an account of geologic and geographic distribution, comparative anatomy, paleobiology, and systematics. These chapters differ conspicuously in size, owing to the great variation in the number of described taxa and anatomical representation. The shortest of these, chapter 14, treats the poorly known, highly specialized Gondwanatheria, represented by only a few fossils and fewer described taxa. By far the longest chapter, “Allotherians” (chapter 8) includes the most diverse and incomparably best known of Mesozoic mammals—the multituberculates. Chapter length thus reflects, in part, limitation by chance representation in the fossil record, but probably, more importantly, it reflects real differences in the extent to which various groups flourished or floundered over the course of Mesozoic time. A few comments on the systematics of chapters 4–14 are in order. As noted in chapter 1, the book’s structure and the basic topology of the mammalian tree made it impractical to restrict the contents of chapters 4–14 to strictly monophyletic units; hence, some chapters deal with convenient sections of the tree, as delineated by the phylogeny of chapter 15. Chapter 4, “The Earliest-Known Stem Mammals,” for example, covers Sinoconodontidae, Morganucodonta, and some genera of early mammals that clearly do not belong to either of these groups, but nonetheless are most appropriately treated with them. To emphasize this point and to make clear what is included in a given chapter, a small logo with a simplified mammalian tree appears on the first page of each of these chapters. Branches or clades covered in a chapter are indicated by boldfacing the appropriate part(s) of the mammalian tree. The names of paraphyletic groups cited in the book are given in quotation marks, for example, “symmetrodontans” or “eupantotherians.” The “Systematics” sections of chapters 4–15 include either stem- or node-based definitions, together with diagnoses for all relevant higher-rank taxa, with diagnoses extending down to the genus level. Type and referred species (those of Mesozoic age) are listed for all genera, and the literature cited (at the end of the book) gives the primary reference for each taxonomic name, down to the species level. We have included all taxa that were published as of March 31, 2002. Although we were unable to include all\n\nPreface taxa published after that date, we have cited some papers published thereafter, in such cases as they were available to us while in press. New references published in the interval between April 1, 2002, and January 3, 2004, are listed as “Additional References” and follow the reference list. Excepting only a few poorly known genera of doubtful status, for which no intelligible published illustration exists, all genera of Mesozoic mammals are illustrated here. Chapters 4–14 all include a table presenting a classification of the taxa covered. Relationships within groups of Mesozoic mammals are reasonably well understood in only a few cases. In order to avoid the implication of some preferred, within-group phylogenetic arrangement, we adopted a neutral system of arrangement whereby subordinate taxa are listed alphabetically within groups (except for type genus and type species, which are listed first under family- and genus-level headings, respectively). If, however, the described group has been recently revised and a phylogeny proposed, we follow the recently published phylogenetic scheme (e.g., some groups discussed in chapters 8 and 10). For the same reason, most of these chapters do not contain cladograms of the groups treated therein. An exception to this is chapter 8, for which we were able to include a hypothesis of relationships among higher taxa of multituberculates on the basis of recent work by Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (2001). We call attention to the fact that some Mesozoic mammals are of uncertain or debatable affinities. Placing such forms among the chapters of this book called for arbitrary decisions, based on anatomical and historical considerations as well as varied opinions in the literature. “Obtuseangled symmetrodonts,” for example, could be variously placed: Kuehneotheriidae among stem mammals (chapter 4) or “symmetrodontans” (chapter 9), and Woutersiidae among stem mammals, “symmetrodontans,” or docodontans (chapter 5). In each case, we have attempted to crossreference among chapters and to point out alternative placements. It will come as no surprise that preparation of this volume involved consultation of many references. This necessitated the adoption of some conventions, mainly aimed at streamlining or clarifying in-text literature citations. Most multiple-authored papers are cited in the text using the convention “et al.” (e.g., Novacek et al., 1997). In the case of same-year, multiple-authored papers with the same first author, text citations list enough of the authors to distinguish the references (e.g., Cifelli, Gardner, et al., 1997 versus Cifelli, Kirkland, et al., 1997). There are a few cases of single- or first-authored works by different individuals bearing the same surname (e.g., Bonaparte, C. L., and Bonaparte, J. F.). In practically all cases, dates of pub-\n\nlication fortunately do not overlap (as in the example given, where more than a century separates the respective published works) and initials of given names are omitted from in-text citations (although initials are used when the author’s name is formally included as part of a taxonomic name). An exception to this occurs with E. F. Freeman and P. W. Freeman, both of whom are cited for works published in 1979; here we have included initials of given names in the in-text citations. We cite the published (Latinized) rather than the christened version of the name for the founder of modern systematic botany and zoology, Karl von Linné (e.g., Linnaeus, 1758, 1766). CONVENTIONS\n\nAs discussed in chapters 1 and 3, we have adopted a traditional, broad-based definition of Mammalia that includes some wholly extinct groups that lie outside the crown clade formed by the three major living groups—monotremes, marsupials, and placentals. Under an alternative definition that restricts Mammalia to the mammalian crown group (see Rowe, 1988; McKenna and Bell, 1997), several groups included in this book, such as sinoconodontids, morganucodontans, docodontans, and Hadrocodium, would be considered “nonmammalian” mammaliaforms. The difference between these definitions is, of course, arbitrary. Irrespective of the varying opinions as to where the line between mammals and nonmammalian synapsids should be drawn, students of early mammals unanimously agree on two fundamental premises: sinoconodontids, morganucodontans, and docodontans are exceptionally well known, and they are critical to interpreting the history of early mammals. Regardless of what we call them, they are an indispensable part of our understanding of early mammalian evolution and must be included in any book on the subject. With a few very minor exceptions, all data presented in this book are based on published references. We do not describe any new taxa, nor do we erect new higher systematic units. Along the same lines, we have adopted the traditional usage of Linnaean taxa, which we feel is more appropriate and accessible for present purposes (see discussions by Benton, 2000b; Dyke, 2002), in lieu of developing a new, Phylocode-based scheme. Linnaean classifications of the systematic chapters (4–14) list full taxon names (including author[s] and date) and taxa down to the species level. Chapters 1 (all mammals), 4, 9, and 10 each cover a nested hierarchy of several clades. For each of these chapters, we also provide a cladistic classification of the taxa covered in respective chapters, side-by-side with the traditional Linnaean classification table. The hier-\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nPreface archical scheme for the cladistic classifications given in chapters 1, 4, 9, and 10 is denoted by the established method of successive indentations; we refer readers to the description and example of McKenna and Bell (1997: 30) for an explanation of this procedure. For higher-rank taxa, we simply use the term “clade” with its attendant taxic definition, instead of the explicit ranks used by other authors, for example, Prothero (1981) and McKenna and Bell (1997). For lower taxonomic ranks, we use the traditionally accepted Linnaean units such as superorders, orders, families, and subfamilies. In a cladistic phylogeny it is also unavoidable that some taxa (often stem taxa) will cluster in polytomies in various types of consensus trees. These taxa are listed as sedis mutabilis, following the procedures recommended by Wiley et al. (1991). Collective taxa are referred to in the plural, following Mayr and Ashlock (1991: 394–395), for example, “Eutheria are.” In some cases the name for a higher taxonomic category, such as an order, bears the same root as a family and genus (e.g., Morganucodonta, Morganucodontidae, Morganucodon). In order to avoid confusion in vernacular usage (using the same example, “morganucodonts,” which could be interpreted in significantly different ways), we refer to the higher category by adding the suffix “ans” (“morganucodontans”). We made an attempt to follow the anatomical nomenclature of Schaller’s (1992) Illustrated Veterinary Anatomical Nomenclature (which is based on Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria, 1983) and Miller’s Anatomy of the Dog (Evans, 1995). However, in some cases strict adherence to the terminology of the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria proved to be impractical. Most problematic in this respect are the bones of the wrist (carpus) and ankle (tarsus). Pertinent literature, both paleontological and anatomical, almost universally employs the terminology of human anatomy with respect to these elements, and we have followed this custom. Unfortunately, there is an important exception to this rule as well: the medial bone of the proximal row in the ankle. Here we have followed the long-standing and widespread practice of referring to this element as the astragalus (e.g., Jollie, 1962; Romer and Parsons, 1977) rather than the talus, as used in both the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria and human anatomy. For structures that do not occur in domestic mammals, we follow the terminology of widely used paleontological and anatomical texts (Jollie, 1962; Romer, 1966; Romer and Parsons, 1986; Lillegraven et al., 1979; Kuhn-Schnyder and Rieber, 1986; Carroll, 1988), together with specialized monographs and articles, cited in particular chapters as appropriate. For the dentition, we use the standard abbreviations of I, C, P, and M for incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, respectively;\n\nupper and lower case letters designate the upper and lower dentitions, respectively. Where possible, dental formulae have been abbreviated by sequentially listing the number of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars in each quadrant, separated by periods; the formula for the upper dentition is given first and is separated from that of the lower dentition by a slash. Hence, the human dentition, which normally has two incisors, a canine, two premolars, and two to three molars in each upper and lower quadrant, would be abbreviated 2.1.2.2–3/2.1.2.2–3.

During this vast time span, mammals diversified into many lineages and underwent enormous anatomical evolution. Humans are primates; primates are placentals; placentals are eutherians; and stem eutherians have a long history, which extends well back into the Early Cretaceous. Mesozoic mammals include the trunk and a bewildering bush of basal branches for the entire mammalian family tree. Their fossil records are indispensable for our understanding of the deep history that gave rise to extant mammals, including our own lineage of placentals. Mammals have thrived in the world’s biota for 65 Ma, since the beginning of the Cenozoic, and they are represented today in a spectacular diversity of more than 4,600 modern species (Nowak, 1991; Wilson and Reeder, 1993; MacDonald, 2002). These diverse Cenozoic and modern mammals are descendants of three major evolutionary lineages: eutherians (including placentals), metatherians (including marsupials), and australosphenidans (including monotremes). The surviving members of these lineages, however, represent only a tiny fraction of a dazzling array of some 25 distinctive mammalian clades (at the order or family level of the traditional Linnaean taxonomy) that existed in the Mesozoic. Modern mammals represent merely the tips of three twigs of a vast evolutionary bush, most of which was pruned by extinction in the Mesozoic (Clemens et al., 1979; McKenna and Bell, 1997; Cifelli, 2001; Luo et al., 2002).\n\nT\n\nPREMAMMALIAN SYNAPSIDS\n\nThe synapsid lineage that includes mammals split from other amniote vertebrates over 300 Ma ago, during the Late\n\nCarboniferous (Pennsylvanian) in the Paleozoic. Synapsids are characterized by the presence of a lower temporal fenestra in the skull, among other apomorphies. Their stem taxa, or pelycosaurs, thrived in the Late Pennsylvanian through the Early Permian (Kemp, 1982; Carroll, 1988; Hopson, 1994). Therapsids, a derived subgroup of synapsids, are characterized by enlargement of the temporal fenestra to accommodate enlarged jaw muscles, a distinctive notch in the angular bone of the lower jaw, several derived features in the limb girdles, and a more anteroventral (near parasagittal) posture of the hind limbs than in the pretherapsid synapsids. Therapsids first appeared at the beginning of the Late Permian and promptly split into several stem groups, which dominated the terrestrial biota in the Late Permian. Cynodonts, a derived subgroup of therapsids, appeared in the Late Permian. Cynodonts are distinguished from precynodont therapsids in having a better-developed secondary bony palate, to separate the nasal passage for breathing from the mouth cavity for feeding, and a larger coronoid process on the dentary, with a definitive masseteric fossa for strengthened jaw adductor muscles, among many other derived features (Kemp, 1982; Hopson, 1994). The advanced cynodonts, such as probainognathids, tritylodontids, and tritheledontids, achieved many mammallike features in both the skull and postcranial skeleton (see chapter 3). Mammalia (see box, next page) are nested within the advanced cynodonts and are defined here as all descendants of the common ancestor of Sinoconodon and extant monotremes, marsupials, and placentals. Mammals so defined are diagnosed by the dentary condyle to the squamosal glenoid in the jaw hinge and the presence of the petrosal promontorium. The earliest-known and transitional taxa bearing these and other derived features appeared about 220 Ma ago, in the Norian age of the Triassic,\n\n1\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\npossibly as early as the Carnian (Fraser et al., 1985; Lucas and Luo, 1993; Sigogneau-Russell and Hahn, 1994; Datta and Das, 1996; Jenkins et al., 1997; see also figure 1.1). The poorly known Adelobasileus Lucas and Hunt, 1990, is also tentatively included within the Mammalia. A substantial body of evidence supports the hypothesis that therapsids achieved a higher level of overall activity and more elevated growth rates than pretherapsid synapsids. Brink (1956, 1980) speculated on the basis of\n\nMammalia are a clade defined by the shared common ancestor of Sinoconodon, morganucodontans, docodontans, Monotremata, Marsupialia, and Placentalia, plus any extinct taxa that are shown to be nested with this clade by parsimony analyses. This stem-based definition excludes from Mammalia such advanced cynodonts as chiniquodontids, probainognathids, tritylodontids, tritheledontids, or any taxa nested within a subset of the latter cynodont groups. The Mammalia concept here is equivalent to the Mammaliaformes of Rowe (1988: figure 4, but not that of Rowe,1993: figure 10.2). In their impressive book, Classification of Mammals above the Species Level, McKenna and Bell (1997) adopted a crown-based concept of Mammalia, originally proposed by Rowe (1988) and subsequently accepted by some other authors. Following the definition by Rowe (1988) and McKenna and Bell (1997), several groups regarded here to be mammals (e.g., Morganucodonta, Docodonta, Haramiyoidea) would be excluded from the Mammalia, instead being regarded as nonmammalian mammaliaforms. The status of several other groups—including the best known and most diverse of Mesozoic mammals, the Multituberculata—would be ambiguous under this definition, as their phylogenetic position relative to crown Mammalia has yet to be settled decisively (see chapter 15). There is a massive body of literature dealing with the merits and problems associated with crown-, stem-, or character-based definitions of Mammalia (see Lucas,1992; Rowe and Gauthier,1992; Bryant, 1994). The definition adopted by us is one of several alternatives. We prefer this inclusive definition of mammals because (1) it is consistent with widespread, traditional usage (e.g., Hopson, 1994); (2) it has the virtue of being relatively stable in its membership contents of both living and fossil taxa (Luo et al., 2002); and (3) it happens to be diagnosed by characters that we view as being biologically significant (see chapter 3). The first two of these criteria, at least, address a primary purpose of taxonomic nomenclature: to promote stability and commonality of usage.\n\nskeletal evidence that some of the nonmammalian cynodonts (advanced “mammal-like reptiles”) acquired hair and a diaphragm, which he suggested are indicative of an evolutionary trend toward endothermy. Bakker (1971, 1975) argued that predator-prey ratios of Late Permian– Early Triassic therapsid communities were closer to those of extant endothermic communities than to ectothermic communities. Based on a study of bone histology, Ricqlès (1974, 1976) concluded that therapsids had a high level of overall activity and high growth rates in comparison to pelycosaurs. He argued that nonmammalian therapsids probably had high metabolic rates and were likely to have achieved some kind of endothermy. In comparison to the pretherapsid pelycosaurs, advanced nonmammalian therapsids had a more upright posture, indicating a more active locomotory pattern (Kemp, 1982; Hopson, 1994). Several studies (e.g., Bennett and Ruben, 1986; Hillenius, 1992, 1994) have documented the presence of a maxillary ridge in the nasal cavity in nonmammalian therapsids. This provides indirect evidence for the development of maxillary turbinates, which in turn are related to thermoregulation in extant mammals (Moore, 1981). Hillenius (1994) proposed that thermoregulatory adaptation was developed among cynodonts and even in precynodont therapsids. Although there is broad consensus that therapsids had elevated levels of overall activity and growth rates, it remains unclear as to whether any nonmammalian therapsids (including cynodonts) developed the same homeothermic (constant body temperature) physiological functions as those seen in modern mammalian insectivores (Crompton et al., 1978). S U C C E S S I V E D I V E R S I F I C AT I O N S O F MESOZOIC MAMMALS\n\nMost Mesozoic mammal species are represented only by teeth and incomplete jaws. Inadequate as they are for a comprehensive understanding of whole organisms, teeth and jaws nonetheless provide useful information about the taxonomic richness and diverse feeding adaptations of early mammals. Their records show several major episodes of diversification (figure 1.1). The earliest diversification took place among stem mammals during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. From this initial burst of mammalian evolution arose several groups: haramiyidans with multirow, multicuspate,“multituberculate-like” molars; Sinoconodon and morganucodontans with “triconodont-like” molars showing three main cusps in alignment; and kuehneotheriids with triangulated, “symmetrodont-like” molars. All these mammals possessed the derived mammalian feature of the dentary\n\naustralosphenidans\n\nLate Jurassic Diversification\n\nLate Triassic–Early Jurassic Diversification\n\nF I G U R E 1 . 1 . Overview of the temporal distribution and relationships among Mesozoic mammal clades. The great evolutionary bush of diverse Mesozoic mammalian clades is the dominating feature in their taxic evolutionary pattern. The more recent cladistic analyses of dental, cranial, and skeletal characters of all phylogenetically relevant clades have revealed a far greater array of taxa and ranks of clades than could be accommodated by the traditional views of four “long-branch” lineages to the Early Triassic (e.g., Simpson 1928a; figure 1.2A) or two prototherian versus therian divisions extending to the Rhaeto-Liassic (figure 1.2B). The almost fully resolved cladogram of all Mesozoic mammal groups, together with their improved records of temporal distribution of fossils, suggests that mammalian diversifications occurred episodically during the entire span of Mesozoic mammalian history. The five episodes of diversifications are as follows: (1) The earliest-known episode of diversification occurred in the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic on a global scale, when haramiyidans, morganucodontans, kuehneotheriids, and docodontans (if including Woutersia) appeared. (2) The next episode occurred globally in the Middle Jurassic, characterized by the appearance of shuotheriids, the earliest australosphenidans, eutriconodontans, putative multituberculates, and amphitheriid “eupantotherians.” (3) The Late Jurassic diversification occurred primarily in Laurasia among eutriconodontans, spalacotheriids, dryolestoids, and peramurans. (4) The Early Cretaceous episode saw diversification within australosphenidans and toothed monotremes on the Gondwanan continents, and the basal splits of eutherians and metatherians and diversification of tricondontids on the Laurasian continents. (5) The Late Cretaceous episode witnessed diversification within metatherians, within eutherians, and within cimolodontan multituberculates on the northern continents and of gondwanatherians on the southern continents. The earliest diversifications of stem eutherians and stem metatherians, as documented here by the currently available fossil evidence, predate the likely time window estimated by molecular evolutionary studies, which indicates that some superordinal clades of placental mammals may extend back into the Cretaceous (e.g., split of the earliest placental superordinal clades around 108 ± 6 Ma ago; Murphy, Eizirik, Johnson, et al., 2001; Murphy, Eizirik, O’Brien, et al., 2001; and several other studies). Full test of the molecular estimates of the phylogenetic divergence would require a combined analysis of currently available molecular sequence data and morphological data of major extant clades, with the main characters for resolving Mesozoic mammalian relationships coded for modern clades. This has not been done and is beyond the scope of this book. Therefore, for the time being we believe that the issue of the timing of the origin of modern placental superordinal clades is still unresolved.

Although haramiyidans, Sinoconodon, morganucodontans, and kuehneotheriids have almost the same mandible design (notwithstanding variations in some individual characters), these groups developed astonishingly different molar structures for different feeding adaptations. Six more order- or family-level lineages evolved in the next episode of diversification, during the Middle Jurassic. Amphilestids, with triconodont-like molars; eleutherodontans, with multituberculate-like molars; and amphitheriids and peramurids, with a triangulate trigonid plus a talonid heel on lower molars were all present on the Laurasian continents. A major innovation of this time was that of grinding molar function, which evolved in at least three emergent lineages: docodontans, with complex shearing and grinding surfaces on the molars; shuotheriids, with an anterior pseudotalonid basin; and australosphenidans from Gondwanan continents, with a fully developed posterior talonid basin for grinding function, in addition to the plesiomorphic shearing features on the molars. It is obvious that the adaptive molar structures related to grinding functions are homoplastic among these groups. Consistent with this is the fact that, in juxtaposition with their derived, multifunctional molars, docodontans, shuotheriids, and at least some Middle Jurassic australosphenidans retained the primitive features of the postdentary trough on the mandible. Presence of these primitive mandibular features in the Jurassic southern mammals with multifunctional tribosphenic molars is strong evidence that they are not closely related to boreosphenidans, which evolved on the northern continents some 25 Ma later, in a separate lineage with far more derived mandibular features (Luo et al., 2002). The third episode of diversification among early mammals occurred in the Late Jurassic, with five newly emerged clades: Multituberculata (sensu stricto), triconodontids, spalacotheriids, dryolestoids (dryolestids and paurodontids), and tinodontids. The most significant apomorphic feature of these emergent clades of the Late Jurassic is the 1\n\nHaramiyavia is the best-represented member of haramiyidans (see chapter 8), and is known by the mandible and parts of the dentition.

(1997) inferred from the preserved posterior part of the mandible that this taxon had a dentary condyle. We follow their interpretation.\n\nabsence of the postdentary trough on the mandible (Rowe, 1993), a primitive feature retained by almost all Early and Middle Jurassic lineages (except for amphilestids and Hadrocodium). Another striking pattern concerns the structure of the dentary. Despite the fact that eutriconodontans, multituberculates, and spalacotheriids have very different dentitions, these three clades all have fairly similar characteristics in the posterior part of the mandible: a rounded “angular” region grades into the dentary condyle, and there is often a prominent medial pterygoid crest (“shelf ”) along the ventral border of the mandible. The last major episode of diversification occurred in the Early Cretaceous when the stem taxa of metatherians, eutherians, and basal boreosphenidans appeared in Laurasia, while toothed monotremes and some of their australosphenidan relatives appeared in Gondwana. The only new major lineage to appear in the Late Cretaceous was that of the gondwanatherians, a poorly known group occurring on several southern landmasses. The existing lineages of eutherians, metatherians, and multituberculates greatly increased in both generic diversity and numerical abundance through the Cretaceous and eventually survived (albeit with varied success) the mass extinction at the end of the period. However, spalacotheriids, eutriconodontans, and gondwanatherians had declined and went extinct. Dryolestoids (Peligrotherium) survived in South America into the Cenozoic (Gelfo and Pascual, 2001). Our overall view is that Mesozoic mammal evolution is a great evolutionary bush. The main feature of their taxic macroevolutionary pattern is successive episodes of diversification. This differs from the traditional views of four “long-branch” lineages to Early Triassic (e.g., Simpson, 1928a) (figure 1.2A) or two prototherian versus therian divisions extending to the Rhaeto-Liassic (figure 1.2B). EVOLUTION IN THE SHADOW OF DINOSAURS\n\nThe evolutionary fortune of mammals and the premammalian synapsids was quite different from those of other land vertebrates during the Mesozoic. Although phyletically diverse, Mesozoic mammals appear to have been relatively rare, even by comparison with other small, nondinosaurian vertebrates. During the Permian and most of the Triassic, premammalian synapsids thrived in terrestrial vertebrate faunas worldwide. By the Late Triassic, however, premammalian cynodonts were eclipsed by the rapidly rising dinosaurs. Throughout the rest of Mesozoic, nonavian dinosaurs completely dominated over mammals. Mesozoic mammals were small to extremely small animals. The Late Triassic and Early Jurassic mammals are, on average, much smaller than the premammalian cyn-\n\nIntroduction odonts. The cynodont-mammal transition involved a great decrease in body mass, which apparently took place in the Late Triassic. The smallest known Mesozoic mammal was Hadrocodium, which is estimated to have had a body mass of about 2 g (Luo, Crompton, and Sun, 2001). The largest of well-known Mesozoic mammals attained the size of a fox (e.g., Repenomamus, see Li et al., 2000) or a cat (e.g., the largest Sinoconodon specimens, Luo, Crompton, and Sun, 2001); isolated teeth suggest the presence of several kinds of mammals that were substantially larger (Clemens et al., 2003). The vast majority of early mammals, however, were shrew to mouse sized, a pattern that persisted through the entire 155-Ma history of mammals in the Mesozoic.\n\nDental structure and body size suggest that most Mesozoic mammals were insectivorous; some larger animals, such as Sinoconodon and gobiconodontid adults, were probably carnivorous, incorporating significant amounts of vertebrate prey (or carrion) in their diets; still others, such as multituberculates, were probably herbivorous to omnivorous. By analogy with modern placental insectivores, Crompton et al. (1978) hypothesized that small, insectivorous early mammals achieved homeothermy (although not necessarily high resting metabolic rates). Homeothermy would have allowed the earliest mammals to be active and forage nocturnally, in places and at times that would have\n\nChanging interpretations of Mesozoic mammal phylogeny and the timing of their patterns of diversifications. A, An historical (now abandoned) view of the polyphyletic origin of the Class Mammalia via several independent lineages from premammalian cynodont ancestry, as advocated by Simpson (e.g., 1928a, 1959) and accepted by others in the 1940s–1960s (e.g., Olson 1959). In this view of mammalian evolution, there were four independent origins of mammals (in the white bands) of monotremes, multituberculates, triconodonts (= eutriconodontans), and extant therians. Stratigraphic ranges of mammal lineages here reflect the available fossil record up to the 1940s. B, Single origin of Mammalia but a fundamental dichotomy within mammals (e.g., Hopson and Crompton, 1969; Crompton and Jenkins, 1979). This was a prevalent view from the mid-1960s to the 1980s that was generally accepted by many fossil mammal workers. While the monophyletic origin of Mammalia is supported by current evidence, the early division of the “prototherians” versus therians (two white bands) within the Mammalia has been abandoned. Stratigraphic ranges of major lineages here reflect the available fossil record up to the 1980s. The current view of interrelationships of Mesozoic mammals is shown in figure 1.1.

Coupled with their more sensitive hearing and olfaction, larger brains for better sensory and motor coordination, and feeding adaptations for insectivory, homeothermy enabled early mammals to successfully invade the nocturnal niches of terrestrial ecosystems of the Mesozoic. Early mammals survived and diversified in the nocturnal niches that had not been previously exploited by other kinds of small, insectivorous vertebrates. The fact that more than half of all modern mammals, and the vast majority of all small mammals, live nocturnal lives (Ryszkiewicz, 1989) is suggestive of a mammalian ancestral niche from their long sojourn with Mesozoic nights. The evolutionary causes by which mammals remained predominantly small throughout the rest of the Mesozoic are still not well understood. Several speculative scenarios have been developed to account for this phenomenon, including avoidance of predation by large nonmammalian vertebrates, as well as competitive ecological exclusion by small nondinosaur vertebrates and juvenile dinosaurs (critically reviewed by Lillegraven, 1979). Crompton (1968) suggested that whereas cynodonts acquired hair as insulation, they did not develop the cooling mechanisms characteristic of most modern mammals (but not monotremes). Faced with the increasing temperatures of the Triassic, they evolved smaller sizes to avoid overheating. Bakker speculated (1971: 655): “Small body size and high surface-area–volume ratios would have eased the difficulties of overheating. Nocturnality would also reduce the difficulties—the mammals could be active in ambient temperatures usually at least a few degrees below the body temperature during the Mesozoic nights and could avoid exposure to direct solar radiation.” The earliest known eutherians were very small, ranging from 5 g for Batodon tenuis, to 7 to 8 g for Prokennalestes and Montanalestes (Wood and Clemens, 2001), and to about 20 g for Eomaia scansoria (Ji et al., 2002). The majority of stem metatherians of Cretaceous age were in a similar size range (chapter 12), with the exception of Didelphodon (Clemens, 1966). Lillegraven et al. (1987) noted that small body mass played an important role in the origin of the earliest eutherians and marsupials during the Early Cretaceous in relation to metabolic and reproductive constraints of these mammals. In fact, it is a general pattern that the earliest members of the mammalian clade tended to be smaller than their later and more derived phylogenetic relatives, as documented by a theoretical study of Cenozoic mammals (Alroy, 1998) and a case study of Late Cretaceous mammals of Wyoming (Lillegraven and Eberle, 1999). It was only after the dinosaur extinction 65 Ma ago that mammals took off in a great evolutionary radiation, oc-\n\ncupying diverse ecological niches, with many feeding adaptations and a great range of body sizes. Whereas all but two of the well-known Mesozoic mammals are estimated to be much less than 500 g, by the end of Paleocene the body mass of many mammals had reached hundreds of kilograms and by the Eocene the mass of some mammals could be measured in tons. In a great adaptive radiation that gave rise to most of the modern mammalian orders, Eocene mammals invaded all niches accessible for vertebrates, with bats capable of powered flight, dermopterans capable of gliding, whales and sirenians adapted to the aquatic environment, and so on. M A J O R D I S C O V E R I E S O F T H E PA S T TWO DECADES\n\nThe first Mesozoic mammal was discovered in 1764, although its significance was not appreciated until almost a century later (Owen, 1871). The first scientifically documented Mesozoic mammal, now known as Phascolotherium bucklandi, was discovered in 1812 in a masonry quarry in the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield slates near Headington, England. The fossil was later deposited at Oxford University, where it was recognized by Baron Georges Cuvier to be mammalian in 1818, announced as such by William Buckland (1824), and formally described by Broderip (1828). However, prior to the appearance of the definitive study by Richard Owen (1842), it was generally believed that no mammals existed before the Tertiary (see historical reviews by Desmond, 1984 and Rowe, 1999). During the late nineteenth century, Mesozoic mammals were discovered in Europe, especially in England (Owen, 1871), and in North America (Marsh, 1879c, 1881, 1887, 1889a; Osborn, 1887a,b, 1888a,b). Knowledge of these fossils was summarized by George Gaylord Simpson in two of the most seminal paleontological monographs of the twentieth century: A Catalogue of the Mesozoic Mammalia in the Geological Department of the British Museum (1928a) and American Mesozoic Mammalia (1929a). In these monographs, Simpson collectively recognized 39 genera of Mesozoic mammals known from Europe and North America; of these, 12 “genera” are now regarded as junior synonyms or otherwise invalid. Fifty years later, Jason A. Lillegraven, Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, and William A. Clemens (1979) edited the book Mesozoic Mammals: The First Two-Thirds of Mammalian History, in which they listed 116 valid genera of Mesozoic mammals worldwide, with all but a few from Europe, Asia, and North America. The 23 years since publication of the Mesozoic mammal book by Lillegraven et al. (1979) have witnessed a truly phenomenal growth in knowledge of Mesozoic mammals. By our count, the number of known Mesozoic\n\nIntroduction genera increased to 283 by the year 2000 (chapter 2). New Mesozoic mammals discovered in the past 20 years are one and one-half times more than the total of those known to science from the previous 200 years combined (figure 1.3). Our knowledge of the earliest mammals has greatly improved in many ways apart from the total number of described taxa—notably anatomical information and geographic/temporal sampling. Many new Mesozoic mammals have been found in areas where the record was previously blank, or nearly so. Most intriguing of these discoveries are those from the Gondwanan continents. In 1979, the only evidence of Mesozoic mammals from the entire South American continent were the footprints designated Ameghinichnus patagonicus from the Callovian or Oxfordian of Santa Cruz Province, Argentina (Casamiquela, 1964), and some fragmentary fossils, which may be of Tertiary rather than Cretaceous age, from Laguna Umayo, Peru (chapter 2). Since that time, highly diverse Cretaceous and some Jurassic mammals have been discovered at several sites in Argentina, owing to the great enterprise of South American paleontologists, especially José F. Bonaparte, Rosendo Pascual, and their respective collaborators. Mesozoic mammals from South America now include purported Docodonta, australosphenidans, eutriconodontans, multituberculates, “symmetrodontans,” dryolestoid “eupantotherians,” prototribosphenidans, and enigmatic gondwanatherians (see Bonaparte and Rougier, 1987; Bonaparte, 1990, 1994; Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte, 1996; Pascual et al., 2000; Pascual and Goin, 2001; Rauhut et al., 2002; and chapters 5–11 for reviews). Pascual and co-workers also discovered a toothed monotreme from the Paleocene of Argentina (Pascual et al., 1992a, 2002). Other important discoveries have come from Australia, previously a totally blank region insofar as Mesozoic mammals were concerned. In 1985, Michael Archer and colleagues reported the discovery of the first toothed monotreme from the Cretaceous, Steropodon; two more Early Cretaceous monotremes (Kollikodon and Teinolophos) have since been described (Flannery et al., 1995; Rich, Vickers-Rich et al., 2001; see also chapter 6). Since 1997 the able team of Thomas Rich, Patricia Vickers-Rich, and their colleagues has been recovering an assemblage of tribosphenic mammals from the Lower Cretaceous of Australia. These authors have argued that these Australian tribosphenic mammals are placentals (Rich et al., 1997; see also Rich and Vickers-Rich, 1999 and references therein). Mammals with tribosphenic molars have also been reported from the Middle Jurassic of Madagascar by Flynn et al. (1999) and from the Middle or Late Jurassic of Argentina by Rauhut et al. (2002). Our team (Luo, KielanJaworowska, and Cifelli, 2001; Luo et al., 2002; see also\n\n1 . 3 . Number of Mesozoic mammal genera known through time. This graph shows the total number of described genera (line joined by diamonds) and the number described during each 10-year interval (line joined by squares) from 1830 to 2003. Three distinct episodes of intense scientific activity in this field can be recognized. The first, in the 1870s and 1880s, corresponds to Owen’s major study (1871) of British mammals from the Purbeck and Stonesfield slates, together with publication, largely by Marsh, of the first known Jurassic and Cretaceous mammals from North America (e.g., Marsh, 1879b, 1887, 1889a). The second took place in the 1920s, when Simpson (1928a, 1929a) reviewed all Mesozoic mammal fossils then known and added a number of new genera, mainly based on previously unstudied or understudied fossils from Como Quarry 9. The third, which continues unabated, began in the 1960s and early 1970s (see References). Source: original. FIGURE\n\nKielan-Jaworowska et al., 1998, 2002) challenged the placental affinities of southern Mesozoic mammals with tribosphenic dentitions. We argued that Gondwanan tribosphenidans are more closely related to toothed monotremes than to placentals and marsupials and that the functionally adaptive features on tribosphenic molars (a protocone on upper molars opposing a basined talonid on lowers) are homoplastic. According to this hypothesis, tribosphenic mammals have dual origins on the Laurasian and Gondwanan continents. The southern tribosphenic mammals belong to a clade in their own right, designated australosphenidans, as opposed to the northern Mesozoic mammals with tribosphenic molars, designated bore-\n\n7\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nosphenidans, and we follow this interpretation (see chapters 6, 11, and 15). Mesozoic mammals previously known from Africa include morganucodontans from the Liassic Stormberg Series of South Africa and a toothless dentary of Brancatherulum from the Upper Jurassic of Tendaguru in Tanzania. More recently Denise Sigogneau-Russell discovered and described an important collection of isolated teeth representing diverse Early Cretaceous mammals from Morocco (Sigogneau-Russell, 1989a,b, 1991c, 1992, 1995a,b, 1999; Sigogneau-Russell and Ensom, 1998 and references therein). Almost simultaneously, Louis Jacobs, Michel Brunet, and collaborators recovered mammalian fossils from the Early Cretaceous of Cameroon (Jacobs et al., 1989). In the 1990s and 2000s, David Krause and colleagues described several isolated teeth from the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar (Krause et al., 1997; Krause, 2001). Wolf-Dieter Heinrich (1998, 1999) recovered three specimens of mammals from the matrix associated with dinosaur bones (Upper Jurassic Middle Saurian Bed) obtained for the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin by the 1909–1913 German Expeditions to Tendaguru, Tanzania. The newly found Tendaguru mammals belong to eutriconodontans (Tendagurodon), peramurans (Tendagurutherium), and haramiyidans (Staffia). Finally, Christopher E. Gow (1986a) published on new materials of morganucodontans from South Africa. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mesozoic mammals were also found in the Late Triassic, Early Jurassic, and Late Cretaceous deposits of India, described by P.Yadagiri, D. P. Datta, G. V. R. Prasad, and their co-workers, adding significantly to the Mesozoic mammalian faunal lists of India (Yadagiri, 1985; Prasad and Sahni, 1988; Prasad et al., 1994; Datta and Das, 1996, 2001; Prasad and Manhas, 1997, 2002). New discoveries over the past quarter century on the Laurasian continents have been numerous and, in some cases, spectacular. The vast territory of China has provided very well-preserved fossils. The classic vertebrate sites in the Early Jurassic Lower Lufeng Formation, Yunnan Province, have long been important for our understanding of basal mammals (Young, 1947; Patterson and Olson, 1961). The late British paleontologist Kenneth A. Kermack (1919–2000) and his co-workers published an exhaustive description of the Chinese Early Jurassic mammal Morganucodon (Kermack et al., 1973, 1981). New field explorations in the 1980s and 1990s yielded important new specimens (Sun et al., 1985; Luo and Wu, 1994). Recent studies make it clear that Sinoconodon retains many “reptilian” characteristics in the dentition (Crompton and Sun, 1985; Crompton and Luo, 1993; Zhang et al., 1998). Even more astonishing was the discovery in the Early Jurassic Lufeng Formation of a tiny skull dubbed Hadro-\n\ncodium, described by Luo, Crompton, and Sun (2001). Hadrocodium has an enlarged brain cavity and no postdentary trough in the dentary, indicating separation of the middle ear bones from the mandible. In 1982, the late Chinese paleontologist Minchen Chow (1918–1996), in cooperation with Thomas Rich from Australia, described an entirely new kind of mammal from the Middle Jurassic of China: the enigmatic Shuotherium, which has “pseudotribosphenic” lower molars. Their largely hypothetic model of occlusion received welcome corroboration by subsequent discoveries of upper teeth belonging to Shuotherium (Sigogneau-Russell, 1998; Wang, Clemens et al., 1998). We now interpret shuotheriids as the sister taxon of Australosphenida (KielanJaworowska, Cifelli, and Luo, 2002; see chapter 6). The Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, China, has yielded a trove of new mammals. Most remarkable about the Yixian taxa is that most of the specimens are preserved as exceptionally complete skeletons, filling in many blank areas of the postcranial anatomy for some major clades of early mammals. Noteworthy discoveries include an almost complete skeleton of the “symmetrodont” Zhangheotherium, described by Chinese paleontologist Yao-Ming Hu and colleagues (Hu et al., 1997); a complete eutriconodontan skeleton designated Jeholodens and a nearly complete skeleton of an early eutherian known as Eomaia, described by Qiang Ji and colleagues (1999, 2002), and a new multituberculate named Sinobaatar (Hu and Wang, 2002a,b). The newly discovered gobiconodontid Repenomamus is represented by many skulls and skeletons (Li et al., 2000; Wang, Hu, Meng et al., 2001). In the 1980s and 1990s, the international teams of Zhi-Ming Dong, Philip Currie, and Pascual Godefroit collected well-preserved mammals from the Late Cretaceous Bayan Mandahu sites in Inner Mongolia (Dong, 1993; Smith et al., 2001). The Gobi Desert of Mongolia is renowned for its unusually well-preserved Cretaceous mammals. Collections of Mongolian Mesozoic mammals assembled by the PolishMongolian Expeditions between 1963 and 1971 were partly reported by Lillegraven et al. (1979). Zofia KielanJaworowska subsequently studied these materials, sometimes in cooperation with Boris A. Trofimov, Demberlyin Dashzeveg, Percy M. Butler, Alfred W. Crompton, Cecile Poplin,Robert Presley,P.P.Gambaryan,and Jørn H.Hurum. Russian-Mongolian Expeditions (1969–1996) also assembled an important collection of Cretaceous mammals, described mostly by B. A. Trofimov, often in cooperation with Z. Kielan-Jaworowska. A major contribution from the Russian-Mongolian Expeditions was a rich collection of Early Cretaceous (Aptian–Albian) mammals (see, e.g., Kielan-Jaworowska, Dashzeveg, and Trofimov, 1987). These expeditions also discovered the first marsupials from the\n\nIntroduction Late Cretaceous of Asia, described by B. A. Trofimov in cooperation with American paleontologist Frederick S. Szalay (Trofimov and Szalay, 1994; Szalay and Trofimov, 1996). The Mongolian paleontologist Demberlyin Dashzeveg, working by himself, assembled a notable collection of Early and Late Cretaceous mammals (e.g., Dashzeveg and KielanJaworowska, 1984; Kielan-Jaworowska and Dashzeveg, 1989; Sigogneau-Russell et al., 1992). In 1990, the American Museum of Natural History and the Institute of Geology of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences began to carry out expeditions in Mongolia, amassing spectacular collections (several hundred skulls and several dozen skeletons). Some of these have been prepared and studied by Demberlyin Dashzeveg, Inez Horovitz, Malcolm C. McKenna, Michael J. Novacek, Guillermo W. Rougier, John R. Wible, and others (see review by Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2000). The preliminary studies published thus far include the discovery of the marsupial (epipubic) bone in Late Cretaceous eutherian mammals (Novacek et al., 1997), a new eutherian (Ukhaatherium), and new materials of Deltatheridium that support the hypothesis of deltatheroidan-marsupial affinities (Rougier et al., 1998). Several papers on the cranial anatomy of multituberculates and the ankle of eutherian mammals have also been published (Horovitz, 2000; Wible and Rougier, 2000). Exercising remarkable enterprise and drive, the late Russian paleontologist Lev A. Nessov (1947–1995) organized a series of expeditions to Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tadzhikistan, Kirgizstan, and adjacent areas. Overcoming very harsh conditions, these expeditions amassed a significant collection of fossils, including a number of mammals from a hitherto almost unknown time interval, the early Late Cretaceous (see posthumously published review by Nessov, 1997; and Averianov, 2000). After Lev Nessov’s death, Alexander Averianov continued exploration in these areas, often in collaboration with J. David Archibald and other colleagues from both Russia and elsewhere. The mammalian faunas are dominated by ungulate-like “zhelestids,” and hence are quite different from the multituberculate-dominated assemblages of the Gobi Desert. Russian paleontologists have also discovered promising new Cretaceous mammal localities in Siberia (Maschenko and Lopatin, 1998; Averianov and Skutschas, 1999b, 2001; Averianov, 2000; Gambaryan and Averianov, 2001). The last quarter-century saw both new discoveries and publication of important, previously collected early mammals from Western Europe. Significant among the latter is a huge, Late Jurassic assemblage from the famous Guimarota coal mines in Portugal (see Martin and Krebs, 2000), discovered in 1961 by the legendary German fossil\n\nhunter Walter G. Kühne (1911–1991). Gerhard Hahn (often accompanied by his wife Renate Hahn) completed a long series of monographs and descriptive papers on the multituberculates from Guimarota, as well as other Jurassic and Early Cretaceous localities on the Iberian Peninsula. The late Bernard Krebs (1934–2001) worked on dryolestoids from Guimarota and elsewhere, a project that is now being continued by Thomas Martin and his students. The late Georg Krusat (1938–1998), accompanied by Jason A. Lillegraven, described the docodontans from Guimarota. William A. Clemens (1980a) published a review of existing collections of Late Triassic mammals from the Keuper of Switzerland and Germany. Most significant among newly collected fossils from the Keuper are those from Saint-Nicolas-de-Port, France, published in a series of contributions by Denise Sigogneau-Russell (e.g., 1983b, 1989b). Late Cretaceous mammals (multituberculates) were found in Romania (e.g., Ra˘dulescu and Samson, 1996; Csiki and Grigorescu, 2000), France, and Spain (Gheerbrant et al., 1997; Gheerbrant and Astibia, 1999). In 1986, Paul Ensom began assembling an impressively large, diverse collection of mammals from the Purbeck Limestone Group (now regarded as of Early Cretaceous age) near Dorset, England. Ensom studied the multituberculates with Z. Kielan-Jaworowska and worked on other mammals with D. Sigogneau-Russell. Among British paleontologists, Kenneth A. Kermack and coauthors continued their work on various Mesozoic mammals; the last paper by this team was published in 1998 (Kermack et al., 1998). An experienced researcher of early mammals, Percy M. Butler, continued to publish on the function of teeth in Mesozoic mammals and their relationships (e.g., Butler, 2000). Among the most important and exotic discoveries of early mammals in recent years was that made by Farish A. Jenkins, Jr., and colleagues in the Late Triassic of northwestern Greenland. Among others (Jenkins et al., 1994), they recovered associated dentary, cranial, and postcranial remains of a haramiyidan, a group represented until then only by isolated teeth (Jenkins et al., 1997). A virtual flood of new fossil mammals has poured in from the Mesozoic of North America, and space constraints permit us to mention only a small sample here (see chapter 2 for a fuller account). Some of these discoveries have helped to fill in knowledge for periods of geologic time that were hitherto not represented by the fossil record of this continent. Geologically oldest of these are Dinnetherium (a morganucodontan) and several other taxa recovered from the Early Jurassic of Arizona by Jenkins et al. (1983). Somewhat younger mammals, mainly\n\n9\n\n10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n?eutriconodontans, were discovered in the ?Middle Jurassic of Mexico by James M. Clark (see summary by Montellano et al., 1998). Significant inroads have been made into the record for the Early Cretaceous and early Late Cretaceous Aptian–Albian mammals, including a reasonably well-represented eutherian (Cifelli, 1999b), have been recovered from the Cloverly Formation by Richard L. Cifelli, W. Desmond Maxwell, and colleagues. Additional Early Cretaceous mammals have been collected in the Trinity Group, Texas and Oklahoma (Jacobs et al., 1989; Winkler et al., 1990; Cifelli, 1997a); and Thomas R. Lipka made the seemingly improbable discovery of relatively well-preserved Aptian mammals along the East Coast, in Maryland (Cifelli, Lipka, et al. 1999; Rose et al., 2001). Mammalian faunas, in some cases diverse and wellrepresented, have been recovered in southern and central Utah by Cifelli and Jeffrey G. Eaton in rocks spanning much of the first half of the Late Cretaceous (see Cifelli, Kirkland, et al., 1997; Eaton, Cifelli, et al., 1999). Finally, work in northwestern Colorado by J. David Archibald and his students has shed new light on the poorly understood “Edmontonian” (Diem, 1999). New discoveries have also significantly expanded geographic sampling of early mammals from North America. Several sites have yielded Late Cretaceous mammals from the Eastern Seaboard; of these, the Ellisdale locality, New Jersey, under investigation by Barbara Grandstaff and her colleagues, has shown most promise to date (e.g., Grandstaff et al., 1992). In the South and Southwest, Timothy B. Rowe, Anne Weil, Cifelli, and collaborators have recovered a diverse assemblage of Judithian age from the Aguja Formation, Texas (see Rowe et al., 1992); and Cifelli, Jeffrey G. Eaton and others have amassed significant Judithian- and Aquilan-aged faunas from southwestern Utah (Eaton, Cifelli et al., 1999). Without doubt, the greatest geographic range extension for North American Cretaceous mammals was made by William A. Clemens and his students, who collected a small faunule from the North Slope of Alaska (Clemens, 1995). Finally, the North American record of Mesozoic mammals has benefited from sampling (involving large numbers of specimens in some cases) new local faunas of similar age to those already known. Such additions to knowledge are important because they can be placed within the context of an enormous body of existing data. George Engelmann, Scott Madsen, and co-workers have collected significant new mammalian fossils from the Morrison Formation of Dinosaur National Monument, Utah (Engelmann and Callison, 1998). Important new local faunas from the Cretaceous include: Judith River and Hell Creek formations, Montana, collected by William A. Clemens and students (e.g., Archibald, 1982; Montellano,\n\n1992); “Mesaverde,” Lance, and Ferris formations, Wyoming, by Jason A. Lillegraven and students (e.g., Lillegraven and McKenna, 1986; Eberle and Lillegraven, 1998a,b; Webb, 2001); and Frenchman and/or Ravenscrag formations, Saskatchewan, by Richard C. Fox, John E. Storer, and associates (e.g., Johnston and Fox, 1984; Fox, 1989; Storer, 1991). NEW MORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES\n\nThe past two decades also witnessed the development of important new venues for interpreting mammalian evolution. Among these are significant advances in understanding of mammalian ontogenesis and morphogenesis, owing to a resurgence of interest in the 1980s and 1990s. The integration of descriptive embryology with interpretation of soft tissue anatomy of the skull and skeleton has produced many successful case studies that are instructive for understanding mechanisms underlying character transformation (MacPhee, 1981; Kuhn and Zeller, 1987a; Zeller, 1989a,b, 1993; Smith, 1996, 1997; Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2002; Sánchez-Villagra and Maier, 2002). Detailed studies on the ossification of the lateral wall from the embryonic precursor of the sphenoobturator membrane provided essential background for interpreting the homologies of the braincase wall in Mesozoic mammals (Presley, 1981; Kuhn and Zeller, 1987b; Maier, 1987; Hopson and Rougier, 1993). Observation on the relationships of soft tissues (such as vasculature and innervation) to skeletal features in extant mammals served as the basis for vascular reconstruction in stem taxa (Wible, 1984, 1987; Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 1986; Rougier et al., 1992; Wible and Hopson, 1993, 1995; Wible and Rougier, 2000). Studies on the development of Meckel’s cartilage and the middle ear bones have brought new perspective on the timing and possible epigenetic mechanism for development of the middle ear (Maier, 1990, 1993; Zeller, 1993; Rowe, 1996a,b; Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2002). Finally, studies of the pectoral girdles of monotremes and marsupials have contributed to the much-needed understanding of the ontogeny of some important mammalian features, such as the supraspinous fossa of the scapula (Klima, 1973, 1987; McKenna, 1996; Sánchez-Villagra and Maier, 2002). Kielan-Jaworowska and Peter P. Gambaryan provided muscular reconstruction for Cretaceous multituberculates and their masticatory and locomotory functions (Kielan-Jaworowska and Gambaryan, 1994; Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska, 1995, 1997). Techniques of serial sectioning and computer tomography have made it possible to study the internal structures of the skull of early mammals, which would otherwise be difficult or impractical to access (e.g., Kielan-Jaworowska et al.,\n\nIntroduction 1986; Graybeal et al., 1989; Luo and Ketten, 1991; Hurum, 1994, 1998a; Rowe et al., 1994, 1997; Luo et al., 1995; Cifelli et al., 1996; Rowe, 1996a,b; Luo, 2001). Studies of the enamel microstructure of Mesozoic mammals started in the late 1980s (e.g., Grine and Vrba, 1980; Carlson and Krause, 1985; Fosse et al., 1985) and have been continued by numerous researchers (see Koenigswald and Sander, 1997a; Wood et al., 1999, for reviews). IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY IN M O R P H O L O G I C A L D ATA\n\nBefore the 1970s, most studies of Mesozoic mammals concentrated on dental morphology, partly because teeth offer a surprisingly rich source of morphological information, but more importantly because little else was available for study. For nearly a century, it was generally held that the major features of early mammalian evolution were those documented by changes in molar pattern (Osborn, 1907; Patterson, 1956; Kermack, 1967b)—a perspective that was inevitable, given that the fossil record had yielded mainly teeth and tooth-bearing jaws. Recovery of Mesozoic mammals by screen washing, which blossomed in the 1950s and 1960s, greatly expanded our knowledge of taxonomic diversity and geographic distribution, but morphological data other than teeth and jaws remained stagnant. The late Alfred Sherwood Romer (1968) observed this problem with a sense of humor: “So great has been this concentration on dentitions that I often accuse my ‘mammalian’ colleagues, not without some degree of justice, of conceiving of mammals as consisting solely of molar teeth and of considering that mammalian evolution consisted of parent molar teeth giving birth to filial molar teeth and so on down through the ages.” Before the 1980s, there were few examples in which cranial data were used to infer phylogeny of Mesozoic mammals, except for the well-known case of the lateral wall of the braincase, which was used to support the grouping of “prototherians” (Kermack, 1963; Hopson, 1964). Remedy for this conspicuous paucity of cranial characteristics for phylogeny began in the 1980s, when skull anatomy became known for several key taxa of early mammals. By the early 1990s, enough basicranial features were known for major clades of Mesozoic mammals that it became possible for some workers to attempt phylogenetic analyses on the basis of this character complex alone (e.g., Wible and Hopson, 1993; Wible et al., 1995; Rougier, Wible, and Hopson, 1996). Embryological studies of cranial features have also provided important insight into how to interpret the orbitotemporal and rostral structures of stem mammals of the Mesozoic (e.g., Presley, 1981; Kuhn and Zeller, 1987b; Maier, 1987, 1989, 1999; Wible,\n\n1987; Zeller, 1989a, 1993; Wible et al., 1990; Hopson and Rougier, 1993; Hillenius, 2000). Although the skeletal anatomy of cynodonts and some stem mammals was well described in the 1970s (e.g., Jenkins, 1971b; Jenkins and Parrington, 1976), incorporation of skeletal characteristics into phylogenetic inference only began with two later studies by Kemp (1983) and Rowe (1988). These were followed by several rounds of reevaluation and further expansion of data based on skeletal characteristics, as more complete skeletons belonging to additional clades of Mesozoic mammals and relevant cynodonts were published (Sues, 1985b; Jenkins and Schaff, 1988; Kielan-Jaworowska and Gambaryan, 1994; Sereno and McKenna, 1995; Hu et al., 1997; Ji et al., 1999, 2002; Luo et al., 2002). By the late 1990s, comparative anatomical datasets for parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis of Mesozoic mammals had been expanded to include many informative features of the dentition, mandible, basicranium and other cranial structures, and postcranial skeleton. Inevitably, various discrepancies and inconsistencies have arisen among existing data matrices. We expect that these issues will be resolved, as explicitly coded characters can be reexamined and clarified, reinterpreted, or corrected as needed, and that the currently used character matrices (e.g., Rowe, 1988; Wible and Hopson, 1993; Rougier, Wible, and Hopson, 1996; Rougier et al., 1998; Hu et al., 1997; Ji et al. 1999, 2002; Luo, Kielan-Jaworowska, and Cifelli, 2001; Luo, Crompton, and Sun, 2001; Luo et al., 2002) will continue to be revised, improved, and replenished. Given the availability of such a wealth of data, it is no longer excusable to propose hypotheses of relationships among Mesozoic mammals on the basis of some single-character complexes: such issues must be framed and tested in the context of all available morphological evidence from all relevant taxa. I N T E G R AT I O N O F M O L E C U L A R A N D M O R P H O L O G I C A L D ATA F O R E X TA N T C L A D E S\n\nKnowledge of Mesozoic mammals has increased enormously since the publication of Lillegraven, KielanJaworowska, and Clemens’s book (1979), resulting in a wider range of taxonomic diversity, new records in previously blank geographic areas, and better documentation of anatomical characteristics. The morphological data for Mesozoic taxa are far more extensive than they were two decades ago, and recent studies have resulted in explicit, comprehensive hypotheses of relationships among most major groups of Mesozoic mammals. But new problems have arisen, especially in the area of molecular versus mor-\n\n11\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nphological estimates for the timing and sequence of origination for extant mammalian clades having their roots in the Mesozoic. Rapid recent advances in molecular evolutionary studies have made it possible to estimate the sequence and timing of the splits of major extant mammalian lineages, based on the assumption of a molecular clock. This has presented a welcome opportunity for molecular evolutionists to challenge the widely accepted outline for Mesozoic mammal evolution as established by paleontologists and morphologists (e.g., Kumar and Hedges, 1998; Murphy, Eizirik, Johnson et al., 2001; Murphy, Eizirik, O’Brien, et al., 2001). Conversely, improvements in the fossil record have allowed paleontologists to test molecular hypotheses on early mammalian evolution by reference to the fossil record of the Mesozoic (see, e.g., Benton, 1999; Foote et al., 1999; Novacek, 1999; and compare with Kumar and Hedges, 1998; Esteal, 1999; Gee, 1999). Morphologists have countered that assumption of constancy of rate in molecular evolution, on which the earlier time estimates for divergence were established, are not necessarily reliable. It is also possible that calculated rates are biased, owing to calibration on the basis of spurious evidence from the fossil record (e.g., Benton, 1999; Foote et al., 1999). There are great differences between the molecular trees of modern mammal orders and those based on morphological data. The latest molecular studies of placental mammals achieved a strong consensus on the phylogenies of superordinal clades of placentals. Of the four superordinal clades, Afrotheria (proboscideans, hyracoids, macroscelideans, and some others) represent the earliestdiverging clade, followed by Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria (artiodactyls, perissodactyls, carnivorans, lipotyphlans, and others), and Euarchonta (primates, chiropterans, dermopterans). The grouping of afrotheres and their placement as a basal clade among crown Placentalia by molecular evidence is contradicted by morphological phylogenies for these mammals (e.g., Novacek, 1992a; Fischer and Tassy, 1993; Prothero, 1993; Shoshani and McKenna, 1998; Allard et al. 1999; Asher, 1999). The case study of the ungulate-whale relationship represents another widely discussed example of incongruences in the morphological and molecular evidence. The paraphyly of artiodactyls suggested by molecular evidence has been criticized by morphologists (O’Leary and Geisler, 1999; Gatesy and O’Leary, 2001), although most recently, the finding from Pakistan in 2001 by two teams of paleontologists provided further evidence for the nesting of whales among artiodactyls (Gingerich et al., 2001; Thewissen et al., 2001), as suggested by molecular evolutionists. Moreover, recent molecular studies have postulated a much earlier diversification of the superordinal placental\n\nclades than predicted from fossil records. The current molecular dating suggests that ordinal diversification of living placental groups ranged from 104 to 60 Ma (e.g., Waddell et al., 1999; Eizirik et al., 2001; Madsen et al., 2001; Murphy, Eizirik, Johnson, et al., 2001; Murphy, Eizirik, O’Brien, et al., 2001; but see Kumar and Hedges, 1998), whereas recognizable members of most living orders do not appear until the late Paleocene or early Eocene. A thorough assessment as to whether any of the earliest fossils of eutherians can be placed in one of the superordinal placental groups on the basis of paleontological data is the key to resolving the conflict between molecules and fossils for the time estimate for the earliest placental diversification. There is no doubt that paleontologists will have to continue their difficult task of searching for ever earlier fossils of modern lineages. At the same time the molecular evolutionists might rethink the assumptions and their datasets for their time estimates, especially about the constancy and calibration of the molecular clock. Relatively speaking, there is less discordance between molecular-based time estimates of marsupial diversification and the appearance of relevant clades of crown Marsupialia in the fossil record. Springer (1997) estimated a divergence of “Ameridelphia” from various groups of Australidelphia between 78 and 70 Ma ago and, within “Ameridelphia,” a split of Paucituberculata from “Didelphimorphia” between 65 and 61 Ma ago. The earliest known fossil taxa (Stagodontidae) that can be placed within the “Ameridelphia” crown group are about 80 Ma old, and the earliest putative member of Paucituberculata (Glasbius) is about 70 Ma old (chapter 12). According to Christian de Muizon, the earliest known South American didelphimorphs are from the early Paleocene, about 63 Ma old (Marshall and Muizon, 1995; Muizon et al., 1997; Muizon, 1998; Muizon and Cifelli, 2001), although Rougier et al. (1998) placed these Late Cretaceous and Paleocene taxa outside the Marsupialia crown group. There is better concordance between molecules and fossils in the placement of monotremes within mammals and in the timing of the divergence of monotremes from crown therians. Molecular phylogenies of the relationship of monotremes to other mammals differ depending on the types of molecules and genes examined. Although the debate is ongoing, the balance of evidence clearly favors the traditional hypothesis of a monophyletic therian group to the exclusion of monotremes. Studies of DNA-DNA hybridization and mitochondrial genomes suggest that monotremes may be the sister taxon to marsupials, to the exclusion of placental mammals—a relationship advocated by Janke, Kirsch, and their colleagues. This led some molecular evolutionists to argue for the resurrection of Gregory’s (1947) classic “Marsupi-\n\nIntroduction onta” hypothesis (Janke et al., 1996, 1997, 2002; Penny and Hasegawa, 1997; Kirsch et al., 1997). From a morphological point of view, this hypothesis was too poorly supported to be taken seriously (see discussions by Zeller, 1999a; Szalay and Sargis, 2001; and Luo et al., 2002; among others). All studies on nuclear genes and most studies on protein sequences have clearly rejected the “Marsupionta” hypothesis, instead uniting placentals and marsupials to the exclusion of Monotremata. The therian hypothesis is supported by an earlier study on protamine DNA, corroborated by studies of neurotrophin genes, β-globin gene sequences, and the latest studies on imprint genes and retroposons (reviewed by Killian et al. 2000, 2001). A recent comparative study on the nuclear versus mitochondrial genomes by Springer et al. (2001) shows that the nuclear exon genes are more informative than the proteincoding mitochondrial genes for resolving deep mammal phylogeny, weakening the relative strength of the mitochondrial evidence for recovering higher-level phylogenetic history in mammals, at least for the case of deep phyletic splits of monotremes, marsupials, and placentals. Although an earlier study on the combined protein sequences yielded an unresolved trichotomy for the three groups of living mammals (Czelusniak et al., 1990), the more recent evidence from the protamine protein sequence, the α-lactalbumin protein sequence, and the IgM proteins excluded monotremes from a monophyletic Theria. In summary, although some types of molecular data have provided limited support for the “Marsupionta” hypothesis, the prevailing evidence from nuclear genes, retroposons, and protein sequences favors the traditional hypothesis of a monophyletic crown Theria (Mammalia of Linnaeus). The study of molecular evolutionary rates by α-lactalbumin protein and IgM protein sequences suggests that modern monotremes split from crown therians about 170 to 168 Ma ago (Messer et al., 1998; Belov et al., 2002). This molecular time estimate is in concordance with the latest morphological hypothesis incorporating relevant fossils. Recent analyses place the Middle Jurassic Ambondro and the Middle-Late Jurassic Asfaltomylos as stem taxa related to monotremes, with shuotheriids (also of Middle Jurassic age) as a sister group to australosphenidans (Luo, Kielan-Jaworowska, and Cifelli, 2001; Luo et al., 2002; Rauhut et al., 2002; Kielan-Jaworowska, Cifelli, and Luo, 2002). As such, the split sequence and time estimate by molecules are in good agreement with the morphological hypothesis based on fossils. The mammalian evolutionary tree is fundamental to comparative mammalian genomics, as differences and similarities in the gene and protein sequences of diverse modern mammalian species are accumulated through\n\ntheir evolutionary history. The cross illumination of molecular evolutionary biology and mammalian paleontology can only enhance our understanding of the deep evolutionary history of mammals. PA R A D I G M S H I F T S I N M E S O Z O I C MAMMAL EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES\n\nA significant conceptual advance from recent studies of early mammals is the understanding that the greatest taxonomic diversification and morphological divergence tends to appear in the earlier periods of each major clade (Rowe, 1993; Cifelli, 2001; Luo et al., 2002). The most significant diversification of Mesozoic mammals occurred long before the splits of modern lineages of monotremes, marsupials, and placentals. It is near the root of the mammal tree that many basal branches split off, so as to generate a very bushy branching pattern of the stem clades in the Jurassic (Rowe, 1999). Based on the almost fully resolved tree of all phylogenetically relevant taxa, Mesozoic mammals have some 26 or more clades, which appeared in the fossil record by several successive bursts of diversification of stem lineages. Most of these stem lineages are dead-end evolutionary experiments that did not survive the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction. Of all 26 or more clades (figure 1.1), only four major lineages—the monotremes, cimolodontan multituberculates, marsupials, and placentals—have a significant presence after the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction.2 Most of the orders and families of the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, such as sinoconodontids, morganucodontans, and kuehneotheriids, represent a hierarchical series of stems at the very base of the mammalian tree. They are distantly related to modern mammals and did not directly give rise to the major orders and families of the mammalian crown group of the Middle and Late Jurassic. (It remains unclear whether haramiyidans, which are among the earliest mammals, are related to multituberculates, which appeared and diversified considerably later; see Rowe, 1993; Butler, 2000; and chapters 8 and 15.) Similarly, the major mammalian groups of the Late Jurassic— dryolestoids, docodontans, Multituberculata (sensu stricto), and triconodontids—represent evolutionary dead ends in 2\n\nMonotremes, cimolodontans, marsupials, and placentals are the four main groups that survived the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction. It has been reported that one dryolestoid, otherwise known only from Jurassic-Cretaceous, is found in the Paleocene of South America (Gelfo and Pascual, 2001). There is also another report of a therapsid taxon from the Paleocene of North America (Fox et al., 1992), but this has been debated (Sues 1992).\n\n13\n\n14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTA B L E 1 . 1 .\n\nA Cladistic Classification of Mesozoic Mammals at the Suborder to Family Levels\n\nClass Mammalia Clade of (Sinoconodon + Crown Mammalia) Family Sinoconodontidae Family incertae sedis Adelobasileus (sedis mutabilis) Clade (Morganucodon + Crown Mammalia) Order Morganucodonta Order incertae sedis, family Kuehneotheriidae (sedis mutabilis) Clade (Docodonta + Crown Mammalia) Order Docodonta Order and family incertae sedis Reigitherium (sedis mutabilis), Woutersia (sedis mutabilis) Clade (Hadrocodium + Crown Mammalia) Order and family incertae sedis, Hadrocodium Clade of mammalian crown group Clade Yinotheria (Shuotherium + Crown Mono"
