        "text": "M. 2011. New dryolestidan mammal from the Hauterivian–Barremian transition of the Iberian Peninsula. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 56 (2): 257–267. Crusafontia amoae sp. nov. (Dryolestida, Stem Cladotheria) is represented by two isolated upper molars (M4 or M5 and M6 or M7) from the terminal Hauterivian–basal Barremian (Early Cretaceous) of the El Castellar Formation (Galve, Spain). The molars have a deep ectoflexus, a distinct metacone, a continuous metacrista, and an antero−lingually placed paracone. They differ from the molars of the other species of the genus, Crusafontia cuencana, by their larger size, by their outsized parastyle, by the pointed lingual slope of the paracone, their more symmetrical appearance with a deep ectoflexus in occlusal view, and the well−developed metacone. Revision of three isolated teeth previously attributed to Crusafontia cuencana suggests that instead of being upper premolars belonging to Crusafontia cuencana they in fact be− long to Pocamus pepelui, of the stem cladotherian superorder Zatheria, probably \"peramuran\". As such, the stem Cladotheria record from the Early Cretaceous of the Iberian Peninsula is composed of two dryolestids (Crusafontia amoae and Crusafontia cuencana) and one zatherian (Pocamus pepelui).

Until now, the oldest multituberculate mammals known from the Gondwanan continents come from the Early Cretaceous of Morocco, NW Africa. Here, we report the presence of a new multituberculate mammal, Indobaatar zofiae gen. et sp. nov., from the Lower/Middle Jurassic Kota Formation, Pranhita-Godavari valley in peninsular India. This is the first record of a multituberculate from the Mesozoic rocks of India and possibly predates the oldest known multituberculates from Gondwanan continents. The new specimen, representing an upper premolar (P(4)), compares well with the upper premolar morphology of Eobaatariinae multituberculates known from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia, China, England, and Spain. Together with the recent findings of cimolodontan multituberculates from the Early Cretaceous of Australia and Late Cretaceous of South America, the new discovery indicates a wide temporal and spatial distribution for multituberculate mammals in the former Gondwanaland.\n\nNew multituberculate mammals from the Hauterivian/Barremian transition of Europe are described. They were found in the late Hauterivian-early Barremian fossiliferous locality of La Cantalera (Josa, Teruel, Spain), one of the Early Cretaceous sites in the Aragonese branch of the Iberian Ranges, in northeastern Iberia. The fossils have been assigned to at least three taxa on the basis of nine isolated teeth: a new pinheirodontid taxon, Cantalera abadi gen. et sp. nov.; a representative of the eobaatarid Eobaatar; a taxon described as Plagiaulacidae or Eobaataridae gen. et sp. indet.; and other as Plagiaulacida indet. These fossils have increased the resolution of European Early Cretaceous multituberculate mammalian biostratigraphy and palaeobiogeography: the oldest representative of Eobaatar is described here; a taxon is assigned to ?Plagiaulacidae, in which case it would be the first of this family in the Iberian Peninsula; and the discovery of a new late Hauterivian pinheirodontid taxon demonstrates greater biodiversity and a wider distribution for these multituberculates than was previously known. The mutituberculate fauna of La Cantalera consists of endemic taxa (Pinheirodontidae), which were restricted to what is now Western Europe, and others (Eobaataridae) which have also been described in Asia. Consistent with the Iberian record of late Barremian gobiconodontid mammals, the presence of Eobaatar in Iberia with representatives from the late Hauterivian to late Barremian, as well as in the Aptian or Albian of Mongolia, indicates that faunal exchanges between Europe and Asia could have existed for most of the Early Cretaceous, either sporadically or constantly.\n\nThis paper includes a systematic reassessment of the Early Cretaceous (late Hauterivian–early Barremian) multituberculate fossils of Galve (Teruel, Spain), previously studied by Crusafont-Pairó and Adrover, and Crusafont-Pairó and Gibert in 1966 and 1976, respectively, as well the study of other unpublished specimens found in the revised collection of Institut Català de Paleontologia (ICP). We here include for the first time the emended descriptions and comparisons as well as the SEM photographs of all the specimens found in the collection and update the biostratigraphic data that they have provided. The multituberculate fossil assemblage from Galve comprises at least four taxa: the paulchoffatiid Galveodon nannothus, the eobaatarid Eobaatar hispanicus, another eobaatarid or a possible plagiaulacid, Iberica hahni gen. et sp. nov., and the pinheirodontid Lavocatia alfambrensis. The species Parendotherium herreroi has been removed from the multituberculate faunal list of Galve. Another two different taxa, provisionally classified as Paulchoffatiidae indet. and Plagiaulacidae or Eobaataridae indet. could be added to the list if their validity can be assessed once more specimen are found. The presence of more than four different “plagiaulacidan” multituberculate taxa in the late Hauterivian–early Barremian of the Galve area suggests a high biodiversity of these mammal faunas in the Early Cretaceous age of the Iberian Peninsula."
