So allow me to distract you with this article not at all related to that.\n\nWhy multituberculates were not replaced by rodents:\n\nThe last unambiguous multies, ptilodontoideans like Ectypodus, were generalists (Ostrander 1984). This goes against principles of competitive exclusion in which only specialised forms remain. Compare for example monotremes and marsupials, the highly specialised former possibly outcompeted by the latter, but even this has been called into question (Phillips 2009).\n\nMultituberculates disappear in many areas before rodents arrived. For exaple kogaionids diversified in the Cretaceous and Paleocene of Balkanatolia, but there is an interval of 18 million years before kogaionids disappearing in the PETM and the first apparence of rodents in Balkanatolia; this vaccuum of both groups in fact allowed the evolution of local mammals like pleuraspidotheriids and polydolopiforms (Métais 2018). Corriebaatar suggests an Early Cretaceous Australian presence, yet the few Cenomanian and Cenozoic Australian fossil sites show no evidence of multituberculates, providing an interval of over 100 million years between the presence of multituberculates and rodents in Australia. The fossil reccord of Africa and Indo-Madagascar is notoriously poor, but again large intervals are observed between the last multituberculate presence (Krause 2017) and the mid-Cenozoic arrivals of rodents to these landmasses.\n\nMost damningly Brocklehurst 2021 has shown that multituberculates actually constrained placental dievrsity in the northern continents, with placentals only diversifying after multies declined. This paints the precise polar opposite of the rodent competition hypothesis: multituberculates were so efficient at competing with placental mammals that they kept rodents in place until they died out.\n\nReferences (that aren’t already linked)\n\nOstrander, Gregg (1 January 1984). “The Early Oligocene (Chadronian) Raben Ranch Local Fauna, Northwest Nebraska: Multituberculata; with Comments on the Extinction of the Allotheria”.
