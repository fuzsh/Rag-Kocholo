        "text": "Article content\n\nWhile dinosaur discoveries often get the most attention when they’re announced, there’s many other fields in paleontology out there that don’t often get the spotlight much.\n\nOne of which is mammal paleontology. While this might conjure up thoughts of woolly mammoths and saber-toothed cats, there’s a big world of earlier, more obscure mammals which are just as fascinating as the famous ice age giants. Most people probably aren’t aware that mammals showed up at around the same time in history as the dinosaurs, though for most of that time they stayed pretty small, only starting to diversify into larger modern forms in the Paleocene after non-avian dinosaurs had gone extinct. A recent fossil mammal discovery from western Alberta, however, contradicts what we previously thought about this.\n\nA team of authors led by Dr. Craig Scott of the Royal Tyrrell Museum have described a new species of the fossil mammal “Catopsalis”, a type of multituberculate. If that last name sounds like scientific nonsense to you, don’t feel bad. Multituberculates aren’t the most popular of prehistoric creatures, but to mammal paleontologists they’re a big deal, despite being pretty small critters. These animals first show up in the early Jurassic period, and went extinct in the Eocene, well into the Age of Mammals, giving them the longest fossil record of any mammal order. Anyone who’s seen a rodent skeleton before will see something familiar in the fossils of multituberculates, as there’s a lot of similarity between the two groups. Like rodents, multibuberculates were small, ranging from about the size of small mice to about the size of a rabbit. They likely had similar lifestyles to rodents, living as tree-dwellers or burrowers, so they probably looked pretty rodent-like on the outside too. They also had long gnawing teeth in the front of their jaws just like rodents do today. However, multituberculates were not closely related to modern rodents, they just superficially looked like them. One major difference is that multituberculates have a huge lower blade-like molar, likely used for chopping and shearing plant material. Since teeth are harder than bone, and the skeletons of small mammals rarely preserve well, the story of mammal evolution is largely told through their teeth.\n\nThis new multituberculate, described recently in the Journal of Paleontology, was named “Catopsalis kakwa”. The creature dates back to the Paleocene epoch, right after the extinction of the dinosaurs, and had some unexpected traits. Most multituberculates from this time were relatively larger than their Cretaceous ancestors, about the size of a rabbit. However, a close study of the teeth of “Catopsalis kakwa” showed that it was noticeably smaller, around the size of a squirrel. This trend-breaking in body size was unusual, but the authors who described this creature have some ideas as to why it’s so small. It could be that Catopsalis kakwa represents a reversal in the trend of body size evolution, reverting back to a smaller size more similar to its earlier ancestors. Or, it might be that this new species is part of a specific lineage that was always small, never attainting the larger size of other multituberculates of the time, and we just haven’t found any other members of this lineage (we call this phenomenon in paleontology a ‘ghost lineage’).\n\nWhatever the reason, new fossils from Alberta continue to challenge the way we look at trends in the evolution of animals, from giant dinosaurs to tiny mammals. So give a moment to think about the multituberculates, a proud part of our shared mammalian heritage.\n\nReference: Scott, C., Weil, A., & Theodor, J. (2018).
