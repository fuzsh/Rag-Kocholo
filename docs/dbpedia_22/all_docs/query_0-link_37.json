        "text": "Kogaionon (genus) Genus of mammals\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nKogaionon is a mammal genus from the Upper Cretaceous of Romania. It lived in Transylvania the same time as some of the last dinosaurs and was a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata. It was named after Kogaionon, the holy mountain of the ancient Dacians. It lies within the suborder Cimolodonta and the family Kogaionidae. The genus Kogaionon was named by Rădulescu R. and Samson P. in 1996.\n\nWoolly mammoth An extinct species of mammoth from the Pleistocene epoch\n\n0 0\n\nrank #5 ·\n\nThe woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene until its extinction in the early Holocene epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.\n\nMajorcan giant dormouse Extinct species of rodent\n\n0 0\n\nrank #7 ·\n\nThe Majorcan giant dormouse (Hypnomys morpheus) is an extinct animal from Majorca, Spain. It is considered an example of island gigantism. The closest extant relative is considered to be the genus Eliomys, which includes the garden dormouse. It is believed to have been omnivorous, and may have been terrestrial rather than arboreal. The arrival of humans on the island is believed to have been a major factor in its extinction. H. morpheus was described by the palaeontologist Dorothea Bate in 1919. A 2011 study estimated its body weight as between 173 and 284 g, with a head and body length of 179 mm and a total body length of 295 mm."
