        "text": "Multituberculates were the most abundant and diversified mammals during the Mesozoic, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere (see Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004; and Hahn and Hahn, 2006, for the bibliography). Adapted for an omnivorous to herbivorous diet, multituberculates were the longestlived order of the class Mammalia; they appeared in the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian), survived the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, and persisted until the Early Cenozoic (Late Eocene). The order Multituberculata consists ...\n\nThis paper includes a systematic reassessment of the Early Cretaceous (late Hauterivianeearly Barremian) multituberculate fossils of Galve (Teruel, Spain), previously studied by Crusafont-Pairó and Adrover, and Crusafont-Pairó and Gibert in 1966 and 1976, respectively, as well the study of other unpublished specimens found in the revised collection of Institut Català de Paleontologia (ICP). We here include for the first time the emended descriptions and comparisons as well as the SEM photographs of all the specimens found in the collection and update the biostratigraphic data that they have provided. The multituberculate fossil assemblage from Galve comprises at least four taxa: the paulchoffatiid Galveodon nannothus, the eobaatarid Eobaatar hispanicus, another eobaatarid or a possible plagiaulacid, Iberica hahni gen. et sp. nov., and the pinheirodontid Lavocatia alfambrensis. The species Parendotherium herreroi has been removed from the multituberculate faunal list of Galve. Another two different taxa, provisionally classified as aulchoffatiidae indet. and Plagiaulacidae or Eobaataridae indet. could be added to the list if their validity can be assessed once more specimen are found. The presence of more than four different “plagiaulacidan” multituberculate taxa in the late Hauterivianeearly Barremian of the Galve area suggests a high biodiversity of these mammal faunas in the Early Cretaceous age of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe dinosaur fauna from the Barremian locality of Uña, east-central Spain, is described on the basis of isolated teeth. Apart from an unidentified sauropod and a probably new basal euornithopod, the fauna is noteworthy for its high diversity of theropods. The latter clade is represented by teeth of velociraptorine and dromaeosaurine dromaeosaurids, as well as Richardoestesia -like and Paronychodon -like teeth, making the theropod tooth fauna from Europe strikingly similar to the Late Cretaceous faunas from North America. However, the reported presence of more basal theropods from other Early Cretaceous localities in Europe indicate that this was a transitional fauna between the typical Late Jurassic and the typical Late Cretaceous theropod faunas of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nRemains of multituberculates are very rare in Upper Cretaceous deposits of Europe, being described only from the upper Maastrichtian Sinpetru Formation, Hateg Basin, Romania. New excavations undertaken in the coeval Densuq-Ciula Formation from Hateg led to the recovery of a few isolated multituberculate teeth, which we describe herein. At least some of these teeth belong to Hainina Vianey-Liaud, 1979, a poorly known Paleocene genus from western Europe.\n\nSpalacotheriids, basal trechnotheres with an acutely angled, reversed-triangle pattern of major molar cusps, are relatively rare pan-Laurasian mammals that ranged through much of the Cretaceous but are generally not well represented in the fossil record. Herein we describe newly collected specimens from the Molino Alto 1 locality, Teruel Province, Spain, and review previously described materials from the nearby locality of Galve; the sites lie in the same horizon in the upper El Castellar Formation and are of early Barremian age. On this basis, we recognize and name Aliaga molinensis, gen. et sp. nov., and provisionally place in the same genus a previously described species, cf. Aliaga henkeli, comb. nov., which appears to be the largest known spalacotheriid. The two species are characterized by a distinctive, multicuspate cingulid on lower cheek teeth. Based on acuteness of molar cusp triangulation and other features (e.g., planar molar shearing surfaces, elongation and cusp pattern of penultimate premolar, reduction of last molar, simplification of upper molar crown pattern), the species are referred to the Spalacolestinae. This subfamily is most diverse in North America, where it ranged from Albian–Campanian, but first appears in the Barremian of Western Europe, supporting the hypothesis that the group had a Eurasian origin and later dispersed to North America."
