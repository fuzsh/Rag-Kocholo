        "text": "I keep thinking I'm not going to need to write any more about LGBTQ issues, that I've said all I need to say, and yet... here we are.\n\nI'm going to start with a question directed at the people who are so stridently against queer rights, queer visibility, even queer existence. I doubt many people of that ilk read Skeptophilia, but you never know. So here goes:\n\nHow does guaranteeing that LGBTQ people are treated equally, fairly, and kindly, and are given the same rights as straight people, affect you at all?\n\nIt costs you absolutely nothing to say, \"I'm not like you, and maybe I don't even understand this part of you, but even so, I respect your right to be who you are without shame or fear.\" For example, I'm not trans; I have always felt unequivocally that I am one hundred percent male. But when I had trans students in my classes, all it required was my crossing out a first name on the roster and writing in the name they'd prefer to be known by, and remembering to use the appropriate pronouns. A minuscule bit of effort on my part; hugely, and positively, significant on theirs.\n\nWhat possible justification could I have for refusing?\n\nThe reason this whole topic comes up once again is a link sent to me by a loyal reader of Skeptophilia about a rugby team in Australia, the Manly Sea Eagles, which had seven of its players refuse to play in an important match because the owner wanted the team to wear jerseys with a rainbow design meant to promote inclusivity.\n\nNote that the jerseys pretty subtle. There's not even any text explaining, or calling attention to, the rainbow bands. But even that level of support was a bridge too far for seven homophobic bigots, who chose to stand down from the game instead.\n\nThe whole incident is made even more outrageous by the fact that the owner wasn't wanting the jersey design changed permanently; it was for one damn game, as a sign of solidarity with LGBTQ players and fans. But no, seven players refused to wear them, saying it violated their \"religious beliefs.\"\n\nRetired Sea Eagles player Ian Roberts, who is the first rugby league player to come out publicly as gay, was devastated by the players' actions. \"I try to see it from all perspectives, but this breaks my heart,” Roberts said. \"It’s sad and uncomfortable. As an older gay man, this isn’t unfamiliar. I did wonder whether there would be any religious pushback. That’s why I think the NRL have never had a Pride round. I can promise you every young kid on the northern beaches who is dealing with their sexuality would have heard about this.\"\n\nMatt Bungard, of Wide World of Sports, was blunter still. \"I don’t want to hear one single thing about ‘respecting other people’s opinions’ or using religion as a crutch to hide behind while being homophobic. No issues playing at a stadium covered in alcohol and gambling sponsors, which is also a sin. What a joke.\"\n\nWhich I agree with completely, but it brings me back to my initial question; how did wearing the jerseys, for one night, harm those seven players? The jerseys didn't say, \"Hi, I'm Gay.\" They were just a sign of support and inclusivity, of treating others the way you'd like to be treated.\n\nHmm, now where did I hear about that last bit? Seems like I remember someone famous saying that. Give me a moment, I'm sure it'll come to me.\n\nA Christian baker creating a wedding cake for a gay couple is saying, \"I may not be gay, but I'm happy you've found someone you love and want to spend your life with.\" Straight parents who give unconditional support to their trans child are saying, \"I love you no matter what, no matter who you are and what you'd like to be called.\" A straight teacher having books with queer representation is saying, \"Even if I don't experience sexuality like you do, I want you to understand yourself and be happy and confident enough to express your own truth openly.\"\n\nI remember when I first saw this tweet thinking, \"How about creating a world where if Billy did wake up and go ask Brad to the prom, it would be no big deal?\" It costs cis-hetero people nothing, zilch, to say, \"I'm fine with who you are.\" And to queer kids, it would be life-changing. Heaven knows, my life would have been different if I'd been able to ask Brad to the prom.\n\nNot you specifically, Brad. I'm just making a point.\n\nReally, all it requires is the ability to say (1) \"Your experience is not the same as my experience, and that's okay,\" and (2) \"I'm committed to treating everyone with kindness, respect, and love.\"\n\nInstead, far too many people are still choosing bigotry, exclusion, and oppression. And here in the United States, there is an increasing push to codify all that hatred into law.\n\nIf you're against same-sex marriage, if you bristle at Pride events, if you refuse to use a person's chosen name and pronouns, if you think businesses should be able to deny services to queer people, I want you to stop, just for one moment, and ask yourself: how is any of this harming me? Maybe it's time to pay more attention to the \"love thy neighbor\" parts of the Bible than to the Book of Leviticus, of which (face it) 99% is ignored by most Christians anyway. Maybe it's time to put more emphasis on compassion, understanding, and acceptance than on condemning anyone who doesn't think, act, or believe like you do.\n\nAfter all, Jesus said it himself, in the Gospel of John, chapter thirteen: \"By this all people will know that you are my disciples: if you have love for one another.\"\n\n****************************************\n\nMy Aunt Florence, my mother's older sister, died of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHer children, especially my cousin Linda, took care of her as she slowly declined during the last fifteen years of her life. She finally died in 2008 at the age of ninety, and by that time there was little left of her but a physical shell. She was unresponsive, the higher parts of her brain destroyed by the agonizing progression of this horrible illness. She went from being a bright, inquisitive, vital woman, an avid reader who did crossword puzzles in ink and could beat the hell out of me in Scrabble, to being... gone.\n\nMy Aunt and Uncle in better times\n\nDuring this ordeal I lived fifteen hundred miles away, so I wasn't confronted every day by the terrible reality of what Alzheimer's does, both to the people suffering it and to their families. Even so, it was my aunt's face I kept picturing while I was reading an article in Neoscope sent to me by a friend -- all the while getting angrier and angrier.\n\nIf you've kept up at all with the research on Alzheimer's you probably are familiar with the words beta amyloid. It's a short-chain protein, whose function is unknown, which allegedly is directly toxic to nerve cells (and can cause other proteins to misfold, suggesting an etiology similar to Creutzfeld-Jakob syndrome, better known as \"mad cow disease\"). A great deal of money and time has been spent investigating the role of beta amyloid in Alzheimer's, and in developing drugs that interfere with its production -- significantly, not a single one of which has been shown to slow down the progression of the disease, much less reverse it.\n\nIt turns out this is no coincidence. There is good evidence that the often-cited papers on the topic by Sylvain Lesné -- who wrote convincingly that a specific beta amyloid species, Aß*56, was the culprit in the devastating destruction you see in Alzheimer's sufferers -- were based on faked data.\n\nNot even well-faked, either. The images Lesné included from \"Western blot\" experiments, a commonly-used separation technique used to detect specific proteins in mixtures, were cut-and-pasted, something that can be seen not only in faint cut lines in the images but in the fact that the bands in the photographs have clearly been duplicated and moved (i.e., if you look at the edges of the bands, several of them have identically-shaped edges -- something that would be next to impossible in an actual Western blot).\n\nIt's a devastating finding. About how the hell fraud like this got past peer review, biochemist Derek Lowe writes in Science:\n\nThe Lesné stuff should have been caught at the publication stage, but you can say that about every faked paper and every jiggered Western blot. When I review a paper, I freely admit that I am generally not thinking “What if all of this is based on lies and fakery?” It’s not the way that we tend to approach scientific manuscripts. Rather, you ask whether the hypothesis is a sound one and if it was tested in a useful way: were the procedures used sufficient to trust the results and were these results good enough to draw conclusions that can in turn be built upon by further research? Are there other experiments that would make things stronger? Other explanations that the authors didn’t consider and should address? Are there any parts where the story doesn’t hang together? If so, how would these best be fixed?\n\nThere is a good-faith assumption behind all these questions: you are starting by accepting the results as shown. But if someone comes in with data that have in fact been outright faked, and what’s more, faked in such a way as to answer or forestall just those sorts of reviewing tasks, there’s a good chance that these things will go through, unfortunately.\n\nLesné's apparently fraudulent research doesn't invalidate the whole beta amyloid hypothesis; other, independent studies support the toxic effects of beta amyloid on nerve cells, and have shown there's beta amyloid present in damaged cells. But Lesné's contention that Aß*56 was causative of Alzheimer's was apparently a blind alley -- and the presence of the protein in the neurons of Alzheimer's sufferers could as well be a result of the disease as a cause.\n\nWhat concerns me about this kind of thing, though, is the damage it does to the scientific enterprise as a whole. Here in the United States, in the last twenty years, we've been dealing with the effects of a surge of anti-science propaganda on a number of fronts, most notably anthropogenic climate change and the efficacy of vaccines. When highly cited, widely publicized work like Lesné's is shown to be based on fraudulent data, it gives more ammunition to the crowd who is already shrieking about how the scientists are making it all up to get grant money and are fundamentally untrustworthy.\n\nAnd as my friend who sent me the link pointed out, there is a profit motive involved in science. The publish-or-perish model of scientific research means that the competition for grant money is intense and often cutthroat. Producing publishable results doesn't just get you funded, it is also the key to tenure-track research positions and the stability and prestige that come with them. Don't get me wrong, I still strongly believe that 99% of scientists are rigorously ethical, and the vast majority of research is reliable; but when you set the system up to punish negative results, it gives the unscrupulous a hell of an incentive to cheat, and the naysayers yet another opportunity to tar all scientists with one brush.\n\nBut what haunts me most in this case is the human cost. This disease destroys lives, and does it in a slow, agonizing, dehumanizing way. The idea that falsified data may have led researchers down a fruitless rabbit hole, wasting huge amounts of time and money while people suffered and died, is horrifying. I keep picturing my Aunt Florence's face, as she languished for years, her brain decaying while her body lived on, and wonder how the people who perpetrate such fraud can sleep at night.\n\n****************************************\n\nThere are two very specific scents that will always remind me of my beloved grandma, with whom I lived for a year and a half when I was eight or nine years old.\n\nOne is the flowers of the sweet olive tree. Sweet olive is a small tree with glossy leaves and little, cream-colored flowers with a fruity, spicy smell a little reminiscent of a combination of fresh peaches and vanilla. My grandma had a beautiful sweet olive, and when it flowered in early summer, it perfumed the entire yard.\n\nThe other is the smell of old books. When I lived with my grandma my bedroom was in the attic, a maze-like twist of rooms and alcoves with sloped ceilings, a wooden floor, and shelves laden with what seemed to my young eyes like thousands of books. That dusty, dry smell when you turn the cover of a book that hasn't been opened in decades immediately brings me back to that happy time that was, in a lot of ways, like an oasis of calm and happiness in an otherwise troubled and turbulent childhood.\n\n[Image licensed under the Creative Commons Lin Kristensen from New Jersey, USA, Timeless Books, CC BY 2.0]\n\nI suspect a lot of you can relate to my experience of having scents trigger memories, but it's hardly a new observation. This phenomenon was the impetus for Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, in which the entire book begins with the protagonist having a memory triggered by the smell and taste of madeleine cake and tea. What's been less obvious is why smell has such a strong link to memory -- for many people, stronger than any of the other senses.\n\nTwo recent papers, one in the journal Cell and the other in Nature, have elucidated why that might be. One reason is that the sense of smell is so specific -- we have over four hundred different types of olfactory sensors, each responsive to different molecules, and those sensors are connected through the olfactory bulb of the brain directly to the hippocampus (a major memory center) and the parts of the cerebral cortex involved in storage of memories.\n\nThere's a lot we still don't understand, however. In part, our responsiveness to scents seems to have an epigenetic component -- the phenomenon wherein traits can be inheritable without involving alterations in the DNA. For example, the grandchildren of mice who were given mild electric shocks when exposed to the scent of cherry blossoms have an aversive reaction to the odor even though they were never shocked themselves. (This may sound like a Lamarckian \"inheritance of acquired characteristics\" model, and in a way, it is; but epigenetic effects usually happen because the trait involved hormonal alteration of the rate of gene expression, which can affect the children -- and grandchildren -- without the actual DNA being changed.)\n\nWhat it immediately made me wonder is how this affects the experience of animals with way more sensitive noses -- like dogs. Dogs' big snouts have fifty times more olfactory receptors than our puny little noses do.\n\n\"'Big Nose'? Who you callin' 'Big Nose,' bub?\"\n\nNot only that, a dog's olfactory processing center is forty times bigger relative to the rest of its brain than yours is. So how does that affect what neuroscientist David Eagleman calls its umwelt -- the sensory world it inhabits? Imagine if the olfactory landscape you were immersed in every time you took a breath was as vivid as the visual and auditory landscapes most of us experience without even thinking about it.\n\nNo wonder my dogs both sniff me thoroughly whenever I come home after being away. Who knows what information they're gleaning about where I've been, who I've come into contact, and *gasp* what other dogs I may have said hi to along the way?\n\nWe're just beginning to parse how our sensory processing centers integrate with the other parts of the brain, and solve the old question of why (and how) the olfactory sense is such a powerful trigger to sometimes long-buried memories. Scientists are even considering the possible use of scents as a way to decondition traumatic memories in PTSD sufferers -- if there are smells with positive, reassuring connections, being exposed to those while suffering from the resurgence of trauma might blunt the edge of the pain. In one study, smelling an odor with pleasant associations (in this case, fresh coffee) while recounting a memory of a traumatic experience significantly lowered the emotional distress of the test subjects.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see where this research goes, as we untangle layer after layer of the complex network that allows us to perceive our world and recall what we experience. And, perhaps, explain how after fifty years, there's still a link in my brain between sweet olive flowers, old books, and my grandma's face.\n\n****************************************\n\nOne of the most interesting, and persistent, misconceptions about evolutionary biology revolves around the use of the word \"primitive\" to describe certain life forms.\n\nThe misunderstanding goes back to Aristotle, really. The great philosopher proposed a concept usually known by its Latin name of scala naturae, the \"scale of nature.\" Often called \"the great chain of being.\" The idea is that life has progressed up some sort of ladder of complexity, starting with something like bacteria, then upwards through jellyfish and worms and bugs and fish and amphibians and reptiles and \"lower\" mammals, finally arriving at us, who (of course) being the pinnacle of creation, stand proudly at the top of the ladder.\n\nThe problem with this, as with many misconceptions, is that in some ways it's kinda sorta almost true. Something like today's bacteria were the first life forms, and the progression of fish > amphibian > reptile > mammal is pretty well established. The problems start when you look at life forms earlier than fish; during the famous Cambrian Explosion, most of the phyla of animals branched off and diversified in a relative flash, not only including the ones we have around today but a number of oddball groups that didn't survive. So with respect to most modern groups of species, that smooth progression up the ladder didn't actually happen.\n\nThe problem gets worse when you try to apply the word \"primitive\" to current life forms. Is a bug more primitive than a human? Both are alive right now; each of them has exactly the same length of ancestral history. It doesn't even work if you link \"primitiveness\" with \"complexity.\" Humans and bugs are both complex organisms, they're just complex in different ways. Certainly, there's a difference in intelligence; most humans are smarter than most bugs. But intelligence doesn't equal evolutionary success. By just about any measure, insects are by far the most successful animals on the Earth.\n\nIt recalls the famous anecdote about the illustrious biologist J. B. S. Haldane. Haldane was a zoologist but also rather notorious as an outspoken atheist, and religious people used to go to his talks to heckle him about it. At one, during the question-and-answer period, a woman asked, \"Professor Haldane, what have your studies in biology told you about the nature of God?\"\n\nHaldane thought for a moment, and finally said, \"All I can say, ma'am, is that he must have an inordinate fondness for beetles.\"\n\nIn any case, you have to be extraordinarily careful how you apply the word \"primitive.\" In biology it's now used to describe traits (not entire organisms), with a very specific, restricted meaning, defined as \"a trait that is shared with the ancestral form.\" An example is the vascular tissue -- the internal plumbing -- in plants, which is \"advanced\" as compared to the trait of \"lacking vascular tissue.\" Vascular plants evolved from non-vascular ones, so apropos of that trait, mosses (which lack vascular tissue) are primitive as compared to ferns (which have vascular tissue).\n\nBut it still requires caution, because it's all too easy to assume that \"primitive traits are less complex\" or (worse) that \"if an organism is like humans, that means it's advanced,\" neither of which are true. For example, take a look at the paper last week in The American Naturalist written by a team from the University of Washington that questions the notion of primitiveness with respect to something most of us take for granted -- reproduction in mammals.\n\nThere are three basic modes of reproduction in Class Mammalia. A couple of modern species are oviparous -- egg-laying (the monotremes, namely the echidna and the platypus). Another group are marsupials, which give birth to extremely altricial (undeveloped) young, because the mothers have no placentas to interface between themselves and their babies. Once the offspring are too big (which isn't very big at all; kangaroos are about two centimeters long at birth) they are born, and develop the rest of the way in the mother's pouch. The third are the placentals such as ourselves (and every mammal you've ever heard of other than the monotremes and marsupials).\n\nEgg-laying certainly is a primitive trait; it's pretty clear that the reptilian ancestors of the earliest mammals were oviparous. But what about the presence of a placenta? Once again, the danger is in assuming that it's the \"advanced trait\" because (1) humans are placentals, (2) there are currently more placentals than marsupials, and (3) somehow the placental method \"seems more complicated.\" These are all more like smug self-congratulation than they are science, and none are reliable indicators of the primitiveness of a trait.\n\nThe current study, in fact, suggests that the placental mode of reproduction may predate the marsupial method -- by a lot. The researchers studied the odd multituberculates, a group of mammals that were amongst the first to diversify significantly, way back in the Jurassic Period around 170 million years ago. They were some of the most common mammals for a very long time, finally going extinct about 35 million years ago (for reasons unknown).\n\nThe multituberculate Sunnyodon notleyi [Image licensed under the Creative Commons FunkMonk (Michael B. H.), Sunnyodon, CC BY-SA 3.0]\n\nThe salient point here is that the marsupial mammals, including the extinct ones that have been studied, have a very distinctive pattern of bone growth that is connected to their being born so incredibly undeveloped. A careful analysis of multituberculate bones shows they're a great deal more similar to today's placentals -- despite the fact that they branched off from the rest of Class Mammalia way earlier than the marsupials did.\n\nSo it looks like the little multituberculates had placentas and long gestation periods, and our mode of reproduction is actually the primitive one. Meaning the marsupial lineage lost the ability to form a placenta, rather than our lineage gaining it. Why that happened isn't known; but as we've seen, a trait doesn't need to be complex to give its owner a selective advantage. Perhaps in marsupials, the draw on the mother's resources is lowered enough by giving birth early that it allows her a better shot at surviving -- but that's pure speculation.\n\nWhatever it is, both modes function perfectly well. \"Evolution,\" as biologist Richard Dawkins put it, \"is the law of 'whatever works.'\"\n\nAnd it all reinforces the notion that there is no \"great chain of being,\" there's just an enormous tangled web of which we are just a single strand.\n\n****************************************\n\nThere's something a little unsettling about the idea that when you're looking outward in space, you're looking backward in time.\n\nIf it seems like we're seeing things as they actually are, right now, it's only because (1) the speed of light is so fast, and (2) most of the objects we look at and interact with are relatively close by. Even the Sun, though, which in astronomical terms is right on top of us, is eight light-minutes away, meaning that the light leaving its surface takes eight minutes to cross the 150 million kilometers between it and us. If the Sun were suddenly to go dark -- not, mind you, a very likely occurrence -- we would have no way of knowing it for eight minutes.\n\nThe farther out you go, the worse it gets. The nearest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is about 4.2 light years away. So the awe-inspiring panorama of stars in a clear night sky is a snapshot of the past. Some of the stars you're looking at (especially the red supergiants like Antares and Betelgeuse) might actually already have gone supernova, and that information simply hasn't gotten here yet. None of the stars we see are in exactly the same positions relative to us as they appear to be to us right now.\n\nWorst of all is when you look way out, as the James Webb Space Telescope is currently doing, because then, you have to account not only for distance, but for the fact that the universe is expanding. And it hasn't expanded at a uniform rate. Current models support the inflationary model, which says that between 10^-36 and 10^-32 seconds after the Big Bang the universe expanded by a factor of around 10^26. This seems like a crazy conjecture, but it immediately solves two perplexing problems in observational astronomy.\n\nThe Carina Nebula, as photographed by the James Webb Space Telescope [Image is in the Public Domain courtesy of NASA/JPL]\n\nThe first one, the horizon problem, has to do with the homogeneity of space. Look as far out into space as you can in one direction, then do the same thing in the opposite direction, and what you'll see is essentially the same -- the same distribution of matter and energy. The difficulty is that those two points are causally disconnected; they're far enough apart that light hasn't had time to travel from one to the other, and therefore no mechanism of communication can exist between them. By our current understanding of information transfer, once causally disconnected, always causally disconnected. So if something set the initial conditions in point A, how did point B end up with identical conditions if they've never been in contact with each other? It seems like a ridiculous coincidence.\n\nThe other one is the flatness problem, which has to do with the geometry of space-time. This subject gets complicated fast, and I'm a layperson myself, but as far as I understand it, the gist is this. The presence of matter warps the fabric of space locally (as per the General Theory of Relativity), but what is its overall geometry? From studies of such phenomenal as the cosmic microwave background radiation, it seems like the basic geometry of the universe as a whole is perfectly flat. Once again, there seems to be no particular reason to expect that could occur by accident.\n\nBoth these problems are taken care of simultaneously by the inflationary model. The horizon problem disappears if you assume that in the first tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang, the entire universe was small enough to be causally connected, but during inflation the space itself expanded so fast that it carried pieces of it away faster than light can travel. (This is not forbidden by the Theories of Relativity; matter and energy can't exceed the speed of light, but space-time itself is under no such stricture.) The flatness problem is solved because the inflationary stretching smoothed out any wrinkles and folds that were in space-time at the moment of the Big Bang, just as taking a bunched-up bedsheet and pulling on all four corners flattens it out.\n\nAll of this will be facing some serious tests over the next few years as we get better and better at looking out into the far reaches. Just last week a team at the University of Cambridge published a paper in Nature Astronomy about a new technique to look out so far that what you're seeing is only 378,000 years after the Big Bang. (I know that may seem like a long time, but it's only 0.003% of the current age of the universe.) The problem is that prior to this, the universe was filled with a fog of glowing hydrogen atoms, so it was close to opaque. The new technique involves filtering out the \"white noise\" from the hydrogen haze, much the way as you can still see the shadows and contours of the landscape on a foggy day. It's not going to be easy; the signal emitted by the actual objects that were there in the early universe is estimated to be a hundred thousand times weaker than the interference from the glowing fog.\n\nIt's mind-blowing. I've been learning about this stuff for years, but I'm still boggled by it. If I think about it too hard I'm a little like the poor woman in a video with science vlogger Hank Green, who is trying to wrap her brain around the idea that anywhere you look, if you go out far enough, you're seeing the same point in space (i.e. all spots currently 13.8 billion light years from us were condensed into a single location at the moment of the Big Bang), and seems to be about to have a nervous breakdown from the implications. (Hat tip to my friend, the amazing author Robert Chazz Chute, for throwing the video my way.)\n\nSo think about all this next time you're looking up into a clear night sky. It's not a bad thing to be reminded periodically how small we are. The universe is a grand, beautiful, amazing, weird place, and how fortunate we are to be living in at time where we are finally beginning to understand how it works.\n\n****************************************\n\nWhen people think of environmental degradation, usually what comes to mind are urban areas, agricultural land either grazed bare by cattle or sheep or devoted to monoculture farming, and obviously damaged sites like mines, oilfields, and landfills. It's a little alarming when studies are done that show that an entire country is an example of a severely degraded environment.\n\nEspecially when the country is as big as Australia.\n\nMy guess is that Australia wouldn't be the first place you'd think of when it comes to ecological damage. But a two-thousand-page state of the environment report, commissioned by the Australian government, resulted in an overall assessment that the condition of the country's ecosystems is \"shocking.\" Amongst the findings:\n\nNineteen of Australia's ecosystem are \"on the verge of collapse.\"\n\nNon-native plant species now outnumber native ones.\n\nMore species have gone extinct in Australia in the last two hundred years than on any other continent. (Not country; continent.)\n\nTwo hundred species endemic to Australia -- found nowhere else in the world -- have experienced upgraded threat status in the last five years.\n\nIn the past ten years, there has been a record number of droughts, wildfires, record-breaking floods, and typhoons.\n\nThere have been six major coral-bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef in the world.\n\nIn a dramatic example of how environmental effects don't stop at national borders, a large contributor to the problem has been climate change -- even though Australia's government has committed to cutting carbon emissions by 43% by the year 2030. Which is lovely, but when there are countries like the United States still thumbing their noses at decreasing fossil fuel use, it's not going to make much difference.\n\nNot that the Australians themselves have done everything right, mind you. Many of the exotic species -- most notoriously, the European rabbit -- were brought in deliberately. Previous governments have been much less eco-friendly than the current one, usually citing budget issues as an excuse not to do anything.\n\nIt reminds me of a discussion I had with one of my environmental science students years ago. The question I threw out to the class was, \"What would it take for governments to take action on environmental issues, specifically carbon emissions and climate change?\" Her answer was, \"Things will have to get a great deal worse. Bad enough that ordinary people have their lives drastically changed. When the food starts running out, when the heat starts killing not just poor people in third world countries but middle-class folks right here in the United States. I hate to put it this way, but until it's bad enough that people living right in our neighborhoods are dying because of it, we'll just keep on doing what we've always done and pretending everything's okay.\"\n\nI think she's spot-on. The problem is, once it gets to that point, it's too late to do anything to halt it. As the Australians have found out, as the Americans and Western Europeans are finding out, once entire countries are sweltering in a pressure cooker, there's not much you can do other than try to survive it -- and accept that some won't.\n\nOf course, developing countries and the third world has known that for decades. Right now, Pakistan, India, and large parts of central and northern Africa are experiencing record high temperatures as well. Unlike the United States and Western Europe, though, this is nothing new. It seems like every year they have a new record-setting heat wave, people die, and it barely is a blip on the radar in the industrialized world.\n\nYet another reason why we think we're immune to the effects of what we've been doing to the climate for the past hundred years.\n\nIt's profoundly maddening when you think about the fact that scientists and environmentally-conscious laypeople like myself have been sounding the alarm about this for decades. I'd like to hope that this new report out of Australia will shake a few people up, but our history of ignoring the experts leaves me feeling like this will get shoved under the rug, too.\n\nRemember the character of Cassandra from Greek mythology? She was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy, and was given a blessing and a curse by the god Apollo -- that she could see the future, but when she told people about it, no one would believe her. Even after Troy was sacked and burned, and her parents killed -- just as she'd predicted -- still people discounted what she said. The environmental scientists are like modern-day Cassandras, telling people what the models said would happen, and even after the models have proved correct over and over (in fact, when they were wrong, it was usually because they underestimated the effects), people still shrug their shoulders and pretend nothing's wrong.\n\nI'd like to find a positive way to end this post, but I'm fresh out of ideas about how to do that. The situation is dire. Our only hope -- slim as it is -- is to elect politicians who place the global environment in first place on the priorities list. Until we do that, I'm afraid the Cassandras will continue their fruitless prophesying, and the rest of us will continue our slide into the pressure cooker.\n\n****************************************\n\nI was first introduced to the idea that human history has been shaped by climate swings back in 1990, with British science historian James Burke's prescient two-part documentary After the Warming. In part one, he tracks the (natural) ups and downs that have occurred because of gradual shifts in the Earth's orbit and rotational axis; in part two, he then looks at the effects humans are having because of our out-of-control burning of fossil fuels and use-it-once-then-throw-it-away culture of consumerism. From my standpoint now, thirty-two years after the documentary was released, his predictions seem nothing short of uncanny, right down to the United States's steadfast determination not to do a damn thing to address anthropogenic climate change. But he even got a lot of the more specific effects spot-on. For example, he predicted the crazy spate of Atlantic storms that caused billions of dollars of damage and resulted in the NOAA running out of hurricane names and having to switch over to \"Alpha,\" \"Beta,\" and \"Gamma,\" even getting it right down to the year it occurred (2005). Watching it now, it's almost like it was made today by someone with a slight penchant for bending the truth, not by someone three decades ago for whom all of these were merely shrewd forecasts.\n\nIf I have one criticism of Burke, it's that he gives the impression that everything in history boils down to the climate. Part one, entertaining and enlightening as it is, is kind of a ninety-minute long exploration of the single-cause fallacy. That said, it's still a sobering cautionary tale. We can't discount the effects that shifts in the climate can have on humanity. Right now in the central and southern United States we're trapped in a heat wave that has already broken records in an area that's accustomed to summer heat; simultaneously the much-more-poorly-prepared people of western Europe are not only facing record high temperatures but droughts and wildfires.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long it'll take before the climate naysayers will finally, grudgingly, admit that we've been right all along.\n\nAnother of Burke's oversights is an interesting one; although he considers other natural phenomena, he doesn't look at the effects of volcanic eruptions on the climate. It may be because these are drastic, but usually short-lived; long-time readers of Skeptophilia may recall a piece I wrote a while back on the effects of an eruption in Iceland in the sixth century C. E. that was the principal cause of \"the worst decade in history\" -- a series of plagues, famines, and catastrophically cold winters that killed an estimated sixty million people. It took nearly a hundred years for the effects to abate, and when they did, they led into an unusually warm period (probably because of the injection of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by the eruption). An even bigger eruption, this one in Indonesia about seventy-four thousand years ago, is thought by some scientists to have nearly caused the human species to go extinct -- the \"Toba Bottleneck\" may have reduced the entire human population of the Earth to under ten thousand individuals. (This conclusion, however, is still under serious debate amongst scientists.)\n\nThe reason all this comes up is because of an article at the site Yale Climate Connections sent to me by a loyal reader, which describes the historical impact of an eruption I'd never heard about -- the eruption of the Alaskan volcano Mount Okmok in 43 B. C. E.\n\nThe caldera of Mount Okmok [Image courtesy of photographer Christina Neal and the USGS]\n\nIt was another massive one, with global effects. Tree ring analysis from the White Mountains of California give evidence of the second-coldest winter on record. Written accounts from Rome describe cold, dry summers that caused agricultural failures several years running; in Egypt, it manifested as the loss of the annual floods of the Nile River three times in a row, resulting in devastating drought and famine.\n\nThis, in turn, contributed to the collapse of the Ptolemaic Empire in Egypt, then ruled by the famous and charismatic Queen Cleopatra VII.\n\nIt's a little alarming to see how quickly the climate can change, and the havoc such changes can wreak. It's why people like me have been sounding the alarm for decades, urging caution instead of what we've been doing, which is blundering about as if everything around us is permanent, as if we're guaranteed a clement climate and plenty of food and water. All you have to do is to look at history to realize how precarious things are. While I won't go as far as James Burke did in attributing damn near everything to the climate, there's no denying that in many ways the interlocking systems of our planet have the fragility of a house of cards. Some things -- such as volcanic eruptions and orbital shifts -- we can't do anything about. But once you see the effects of climate change on the history and habitability of the Earth, I don't see how you wouldn't come away absolutely convinced that we better do everything we can to protect the part of it we can do something about.\n\n****************************************"
