        "text": "Updated Janurary 5, 2018 with the addition of more taxa.\n\nWikipedia reports\n\n“Haramiyidans have been known since the 1840s, but only from fossilized teeth and a single partial lower jaw. However, several features of the teeth have shown for many years that haramiyidans are among the most basal of mammaliaforms. Megaconus (Middle Jurassic, Zhou et al. 2013, Fig. 1) is a member.”\n\nWikipedia also reports\n\n“Multituberculata is is an extinct taxon of rodent-like mammals. At least 200 species are known, ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. Multituberculates are usually placed outside either of the two main groups of living mammals—Theria, including placentals and marsupials, and Monotremata—but closer to Theria than to monotremes. The oldest known species in the group is Rugosodon from the Jurassic.”\n\nRecently added taxa\n\nto the LRT (749 taxa then, 1370 taxa when updated) include the purported haramiyid allothere mammaliaform. Megaconus mammaliaformis (Zhou et al., 2013) the mutituberculates Rugosodon (Yuan et al. 2013) and Kryptobaatar (Kielan-Jaworowska 1970). Unfortunately most of the other known haramiyid allothere mammaliaformes are known from too few traits to test in the LRT. So far as I know, only Kryptobataar (Fig. 8), Rugosodon (Fig. 9) and Megaconus (Fig. 1) are known from complete skeletons. There may be others, but these three are enough to test the nesting. In the LRT they nest together with Rattus (the rat. Fig. 3). Additional taxa nest Haramiyavia with pre-mammal trithelodonts.\n\nBy contrast…\n\nZhou et al. 2013 report: “Here we describe a new fossil from the Middle Jurassic that has a mandibular middle ear, a gradational transition of thoracolumbar vertebrae and primitive ankle features, but highly derived molars with a high crown and multiple roots that are partially fused. The upper molars have longitudinal cusp rows that occlude alternately with those of the lower molars.” The first three traits put Megaconus among the pre-mammal cynodonts. The last three traits are specialiizations. The broader traits employed by the LRT put Megaconus in the rodent clade. Rattus (the rat) and Oryctlagus (the rabbit) were included taxa in both studies. The primitive traits appear to be atavisms (reversals).\n\nSo now we have a phylogenetic problem.\n\nDo Megaconus and Rugosodon nest more primitively than monotremes? According to Zhou et al. they do. The Zhou team employed more taxa, more traits and more dental traits — by far.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nMegaconus otherwise looks so much like a rodent that it has been given the nickname, ‘the Jurassic squirrel.’ The LRT tests only the relatively easy traits to see, not dental details. In the LRT, shifting Megaconus and Rugosodon to Juramaia adds 37 steps. That’s a big hump to get over. I do not know how many additional steps would be added by shifting Megaconus to Rattus in the Zhou et al. study.\n\nIf the Zhou et al. team is correct\n\nthen we have a problem. If the Zhou et al. team is not correct, they have a problem. They have identified an angular/ectotympanic where there is none. Rugosodon and Kryptobataar likewise do not have pre-mammal-type posterior jaw bones prior to their evolution into tiny ear bones.\n\nHow can we reconcile this problem?\n\nIf Megaconus indeed nests with Rattus, then the ankle, posterior jaw and other traits may represent reversals to a more primitive state.\n\nIf Megaconus is indeed primitive, then it anticipates and converges on a long list of traits with Rattus under the LRT, Given that living monotremes have a long list of special traits, it is not unreasonable to accept that Megaconus diid likewise. The only caveat to that hypothesis is that monotreme special traits are not shared with or converge with those of other mammals.\n\nIf Megaconus parts have been misidentified, then (no exceptions) all other traits indicate it is a rodent sister.\n\nStem mammals have lots of teeth\n\n(Fig. 6) and Megaconus does not have lots of teeth. It has rodent-like teeth and everything else is rodent-like, too. And check out that overbite!\n\nThe skull of\n\nKryptobataar, (Fig. 6) another purported multituberculate, likewise shows no trace of tiny post-dentary bones, either here or in a Digimorph scan.\n\nThe skull of\n\nof Rugosodon (Fig. 9) likewise shows no trace of long, gracile post dentary bones, either here or originally.\n\nReferences\n\nKielan-Jaworowska Z 1970.
