        "text": "For those in a hurry, a two-part summary:\n\n1. By convergence, basal multituberculates in the Jurassic (Figs. 1, 4), had a distinct flying squirrel (Glaucomys, Figs. 2, 3)-like patagial (= gliding membrane) morphology.\n\n2. Also by convergence, multituberculates in the Jurassic had a short post-dentary skull length with a sliding jaw joint and a nearly absent angular process as seen in the extant aye-aye (Daubentonia, Figs. 5, 6).\n\nToday’s blogpost had its genesis\n\nwhen I finally noticed several basal multituberculates that preserved soft tissue had flying-squirrel-like patagia preserved in the sediment (Fig. 1)… and squirrels nested more or less close to the origin of multituberculates. So, I added a flying squirrel, Glaucomys (Fig. 1) to the large reptile tree (LRT, 1810+ taxa) to see what would happen.\n\nIt should come as no surprise\n\nthat Glaucomys nested with the extant red squirrel Sciurus, NOT any closer to multituberculates. Thus, the ability to glide in the manner of a flying squirrel turned out to be by convergence in basal multituberculates of the Jurassic.\n\nBased on the phylogenetic position\n\nof squirrels and other rodents as sisters to multituberculates, either flying squirrels were also gliding from tree-to-tree during the Mesozoic, or they took their time and only appeared after the Mesozoic. That is the current paradigm based on present evidence.\n\nEnd of part 1. Scroll down for part 2.\n\nPart 2.\n\nBy convergence, the aye-aye, Daubentonia\n\n(Fig. 5) has a multituberculate-like mandible lacking an angular process along with a large circumference, sliding jaw joint and reduced post-dentary skull.\n\nBy convergence, Carpolestes\n\nhas an enlarged posterior lower premolar, as in multituberculates. So, lots of convergence surrounds the multituberculates.\n\nThe aye-aye is a traditional basal primate,\n\nbased on gene studies (Dene et al1980; Rurnpler et al 1988; Del Pero et al 1995; Porter et al 1995).\n\nBy contrast\n\nthe large reptile tree (LRT, 1810+ taxa; subset Fig. 4) nests the aye-aye (Daubentonia) with rodents, plesiadapiformes, carpolestids and multituberculates. We’ve seen how genomic studies produce false positives. Add Daubentonia to that list of flubs. Note that both lemurs and aye-ayes are both from Madagascar, lending more evidence to the hypothesis that geography and geology (e.g. Afrotheria, Laurasiatheria) affect genomics to a greater degree than professionally realized over deep time.\n\nLike rodents:\n\nThe aye-aye does not have mammary glands on the chest, as in primates, but along the groin, as in non-primates. The aye-aye has a large diastema between the incisors and molars, as in plesiadapiformes and rodents, distinct from primates.\n\nLike primates:\n\nThe aye-aye has a postorbital bar, stereoscopic vision and an opposable hallux. Owen 1863 considered such traits ‘must be ordained’ in arguments for God and against Darwin’s then novel hypothesis of natural selection and evolution.\n\nLike rodents,\n\nPerry et al. 2014 report: “the single pair of incisors consists of continuously growing, elongate, open-rooted chisels, both upper and lower incisors.”\n\nBased on the LRT\n\nmutltuberculates are netonous rodents, growing to adulthood without ontogenetically incorporating post-dentary bones into the tympanic and periotic (inner ear enclosing bones), as we learned earlier here.\n\nBy convergence\n\nthe aye-aye (Daubentonia. Fig. 6) likewise reduces the tympanic and periotic along with the angular process of the dentary, producing a sliding joint that would have interfered with the ear bones if allowed to develop as in most placentals.\n\nCarter 2009 notes\n\n(while mistakenly assuming a lemur affinity for Daubentonia), “The overall dimensions of the D. madagascariensis auditory ossicles are large and they have a unique morphology.” Carter also reports on the elongate manubrium of the malleus (the former articular). This is in accord with similar structures in the neotonous (not primitive!) multituberculate auditory bone chain you can see here.\n\nWhat does the angular process of the plancental dentary do?\n\nAccording to Meng et al. 2003, a huge angular process was present in Rhombomylus, an extinct gerbil. Meng et al. mapped insertions for the deep masseter and superficial masseter externally. Then they mapped insertions for the medial pterygoid and superficial masseter internally. The Rhomboylus glenoid has a small diameter and rotates. It does not slide.\n\nMeng et al. write: “As the major muscle to move the mandible forward, the superficial masseter must be long enough so that it can work to bring the jaw forward at least the minimum working distance. In general, the action line of the anterior deep masseter is nearly perpendicular to the moment arm of the mandible, while the posterior one has an acute angle to the moment arm and, therefore, less mechanical advantage. the deep masseter must have been sizable and supplies the main force for mastication as in rodents.”\n\nThe point of which is: multituberculates and the aye-aye reduce and eliminate the angular process. So we can imagine the muscles listed by Meng et al. either migrate or are lost in multituberculates and the aye-aye.\n\nWe can’t leave Jurassic flying squirrels\n\nwithout a quick review of Maiopatagium (Early Jurassic, Fig. 7, Meng et al. 2017), which was hailed ever since as a gliding mammal or mammaliaform.\n\nContra Meng et al. 2017\n\nphylogenetic analysis nested Maiopatagium with the extant porcupine (Coendou), not with gliding multituberculates, like Vilevolodon. Maiopatagium has long straight hairs and lacks any trace of a patagium. Those long straight hairs are the precursors to porcupine quills according to the LRT.\n\nPhyogenetic analysis puts rodents and all their precursors\n\n(Tupaia, Henkelotherium, Nasua) squarely and clearly in the earlier part of the Early Jurassic, though not yet recovered in fossils.\n\nThe myth about the patagium surrounding Maiopatagium\n\nseems to have had its genesis in the fact that Vilevolodon was described at the same time, by the same authors, in the same publication. Vilevolodon (Fig. 1) has a no-doubt, flying sqirrel-like patagium. Maiopatagium (Fig. 7) was described with a misidentified patagium and a misidentified bat-like calcar. No patagium is present, but long straight hairs are. As noted above, these are precursors to porcupine quills. Getting taxa into a proper phylogenetic context is the key to understanding soft tissue and taxonomy.\n\nReferences\n\nCarter Y 2009.

They are not considering the possibility, hypothesized in the large reptile tree (LRT, 1593+ taxa) of a phylogenetic reversal in which the inner ear bones, which recapitulate phylogeny during embryonic ontogeny in placentals, could have stopped developing and stopped migrating to the typical placental position posterior to the mandible.\n\n“Here we report a skull and postcranium that we refer to the haramiyidan Vilevolodon diplomylos (dating to the Middle Jurassic epoch (160 million years ago)) and that shows excellent preservation of the malleus, incus and ectotympanic (which supports the tympanic membrane).\n\nSee figure 1. We covered this issue earlier here, here and here.\n\nFrom the Wang et al. abstract (continued)\n\n“After comparing this fossil with other Mesozoic and extant mammals, we propose that the overlapping incudomallear articulation found in this and other Mesozoic fossils, in extant monotremes and in early ontogeny in extant marsupials and placentals is a morphology that evolved in several groups of mammals in the transition from the dual to the single function for the ossicles.”\n\nUnfortunately\n\nWang et al. are pinning all their phylogenetic hopes on the inner ear bones. Therefore they are “Pulling a Larry Martin.” Don’t do that. When placed into a phylogenetic analysis that considers traits from the entire skeleton and a wide gamut of mammals and pre-mammals, Vilevolodon nests within the placental clade Glires (the gnawers = rodents, rabbits, shrews, aye-ayes, multituberculates, etc.) We’ve known this for several years.\n\nWang et al. 2021 provide four prior analyses\n\nin their SuppData, (references below) all of which employ suprageneric taxa, none of which test pertinent members of Glires.\n\nIn summary:\n\nWhen tested against more taxa Vilevolodon is recovered as a derived member of Glires (rodents, rabbits, shrews, etc.) sharing with other multituberculates a neotonous retention of the embryonic condition, prior to the migration of the inner ear bones to the base of the skull, posterior to the mandibles. Evidently in their typical adult placental position typical ear bones interfered with the long slide of the mandible during gnawing and mastication, so retained the embryonic condition. The authors noted this ‘transition” in placentals in their abstract, but did not consider the possibility of a reversal or neotony.\n\nReferences\n\nHan G, Mao F, Bi S., Wang Y and Meng JA2017.

Presently several species are known. This one was µCT scanned.\n\nFrom the abstract\n\n“We report a new Cretaceous multituberculate mammal with 3D auditory bones preserved. Along with other fossil and extant mammals, the unequivocal auditory bones display features potentially representing ancestral phenotypes of the mammalian middle ear.”\n\nThe authors made several basic mistakes with Sinobaatar.\n\nBy concentrating on one set of traits (the middle ear), rather than the entire skeleton, the authors ‘Pulled a Larry Mrartin“.\n\nBy not including derived members of Glires (gnawing placentals) in their phylogenetic analysis, their cladogram (Fig. 2) suffers from taxon exclusion and inappropriate taxon inclusion (e.g. Liaoconodon and Origolestes are mammal-mimics living in the Early Cretaceous alongside real mammals).\n\nThe authors did not consider the possibility of convergence brought about by a reversal. When members of Glires are added to analysis (Fig. 3), the reversal becomes obvious (Fig. 4).\n\nThe takeaway:\n\nNot matter what the configuration of the middle ear in Sinobaatar, if the rest of the skeleton nests it in Glires, maximum parsimony says: Sinobaatar and all multituberculates nest in Glires.\n\nThe authors report in the SuppData:\n\n“Given several recent efforts of higher-level phylogenies of mammaliaforms [1-3] and the relatively stable position of multituberculates (Sinobaatar in particular) within mammals in all these studies, we consider it redundant to run another phylogenetic analysis.”\n\nRedundant, yes, if using the same taxon list. But adding members of Glires to that taxon list changes everything.\n\nThe wide gamut of the taxon list\n\nin the large reptile tree (LRT, 1729+ taxa; subset Fig. 3) minimizes taxon exclusion. When taxa that have never been tested together before get tested together, sometimes they nest together. You just have to let the software do what it does best and keep shoveling in more taxa.\n\nThe authors report,\n\n“While the auditory bones already detached from the dentary in the three phenotypes, the transitional middle ear of Liaoconodon is most primitive in that the malleus and ectotympanic have long anterior processes that are still in contact with the ossified Meckel’s cartilage; thus, hearing and chewing functions were not completely separated. Origolestes is more derived in having lost the bony contact of the auditory bones to the ossified Meckel’s cartilage so that hearing and chewing functions were decoupled.”\n\nWithout a valid cladogram the authors assume the order of evolution without really knowing. In the LRT Origolestes is not a mammal and the more primitive of the two, hinting at an earlier stage in a reversal. The LRT lumps and separates taxa to reveal such reversals.\n\nThe authors report,\n\n“With the assumption that the DMME evolved independently in monotremes, therians, and multituberculates, there should be no common ancestral phenotype of the middle ear for these clades.”\n\nThat is incorrect. The LRT nests multituberculates within the gnawing clade, Glires (Fig. 3). The LRT indicates the primitive nature of the middle ear of multituberculates is a reversal likely caused by the great propalinal movement of the gnawing jaw interfering with and preventing normal maturation of the placental middle ear and leaving it at a more primitive state. You can have more confidence in this hypothesis because more taxa are tested, ‘leaving no stone unturned.’\n\nEvery description you’ll ever see\n\nof multituberculates, plesiadapiformes, carpolestids and the aye-aye, Daubentonia, includes the phrase, “rodent-like” for a very good reason. That’s because they are closely related, something Mao et al. 2020 and other multituberculate experts do not yet realize. Adding taxa always resolves problems. Just do it. Don’t “Pull a Larry Martin.”\n\nReferences\n\nMao F-G, Liu C, Chase MH, Smith AK, Meng J 2020.

Added to the large reptile tree (LRT, 1678+ taxa; subset Fig. 3), Adalatherium nests with Miocene Paedotherium (Fig. 2), a metatherian taxon known since 1888 with homologous large rodent-like incisors and retained coracoids. Regrettably this taxon was omitted from the Krause et al. cladogram (Fig. 4).\n\nPaedotherium typicum (Burmeister 1888, Cerdeño E and Bond M 1998; Miocene-Pleistocene) was originally considered a rabbit-like typothere notoungulate, but here nests between Dasyuroides and Phalanger among the marsupials. The Cretaceous taxa, Vintana and Groeberia are more closey related, hinting at the probable Jurassic origin of Paedotherium.\n\nBy contrast with the LRT,\n\nKrause et al. considered their discovery a member of the ‘Gondwanatheria’ and therefore a basal mammal between Prototheria (duckbills and echidnas) and Metatheria (marsupials) (Fig. 4), still close to Vintana, the closest included taxon known from more than teeth.\n\nFrom the abstract:\n\n“To our knowledge, the specimen is the most complete skeleton of a Gondwanan Mesozoic mammaliaform that has been found, and includes the only postcranial material and ascending ramus of the dentary known for any gondwanatherian. A phylogenetic analysis including the new taxon recovers Gondwanatheria as the sister group to Multituberculata.”\n\nThis is a red flag. In the LRT multituberculates are members of the clade Glires a placental clade that includes tree shrews and rodents. Krause et al. omitted the closest taxa in the LRT to the multituberculates.\n\nLarge rodent-like incisors, coupled with procoracoids, coupled with epipubes,\n\nnarrowed the taxonomic focus for the Krause team, but narrowed it a little too far. Overlooked Paedotherium (Fig. 2) shares those traits and hundreds more. The LRT minimizes exactly this type of taxon exclusion by including such a wide gamut of taxa that keeps getting wider and deeper with every new taxon. The similarities are obvious.\n\nFrom the abstract:\n\n“The skeleton, which represents one of the largest of the Gondwanan Mesozoic mammaliaforms, is particularly notable for exhibiting many unique features in combination with features that are convergent on those of therian mammals. This uniqueness is consistent with a lineage history for A. hui of isolation on Madagascar for more than 20 million years.”\n\nNot ‘unique’ and not ‘convergent’ with those of therian mammals—Adalatherium IS a therian mammal… with a procoracoid and epipubes.\n\nDon’t rely on a short list of traits.\n\nThat would be like ‘Pulling a Larry Martin.” Don’t rely on dental traits. Don’t rely on genes. Just expand your taxon list and let the software decide where to nest new taxa. Omitting pertinent taxa is a common issue in paleontology. Not sure what drives it other than headlines in this case.\n\nAfter all the work involved in discovering\n\nand recovering Adalatherium, expanding the taxon list would have been the easiest thing to do… and, as usual, the most important. Simply omitting taxa too often produces erroneous conclusions, turning a wonderful discovery, kept under wraps and studied for twenty years in prestigious institutions into an embarrassing error published in Nature and widely publicized around the world (links below).\n\nEarlier we talked about the origin of major mammal clades\n\nin the Jurassic and Cretaceous (Fig. 7). Adalatherium is just one of many already known and many to come.\n\nIs Adalatherium the oldest mammal found in the Southern Hemisphere?\n\nNo. Brasilitherium and Brasilodon (Fig. 7) both from Brazil, are known from the Norian (Late Triassic) more than twice as old as Adalatherium. We also have seven placentals (Fig. 7) from the Late Jurassic of China and older marsupials from China and England.\n\nAccording to Science Alert (link below):\n\n“Exactly what factors induced the craziness of the crazy beast isn’t fully clear, but a 20-year-long analysis of the remains (the fossil was first discovered in 1999) indicates it is indeed a strange creature. Knowing what we know about the skeletal anatomy of all living and extinct mammals, it is difficult to imagine that a mammal like Adalatherium could have evolved,” says vertebrate palaeontologist David Krause from the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, who helped find the skeleton during a field expedition in Madagascar in 1999. “It bends and even breaks a lot of rules.”\n\n“Strange… crazy… difficult to imagine…”\n\nthis is all hyperbole. When Paedotherium is added to the taxon list, none of this is strange… and there goes the headline… and the generic name…\n\nContinuing from Science Alert\n\n“Part of the weirdness is the primitive septomaxilla bone in its snout region – a feature that disappeared 100 million years earlier in the ancestors of living modern mammals.”\n\n“It also had more openings (called foramina) in its cranium than any known mammal, the researchers say, which may have enhanced the sensitivity of its snout and whiskers, by enabling passage for nerves and blood vessels through the skull.”\n\n“The animal had strangely bowed leg bones, too, and researchers aren’t sure whether it used its limbs for digging, or running, or even other kinds of locomotion. Then there are the teeth. The strangeness of the animal is clearly apparent in the teeth – they are backwards compared to all other mammals, and must have evolved afresh from a remote ancestor,” Evans explains.\n\nBackwards? Does that mean more primitive?\n\nLet’s assume the latter. On that point, the teeth of Paedotherium are similar.\n\nBottom line:\n\nAdalatherium is just a minor variation on a traditionally overlooked taxon known for over 100 years. Chronologically it’s not that old. Phylogenetically it’s not that crazy, strange or bizarre. Omitting taxa remains THE MOST COMMON error in academic papers. Let’s fix that.\n\nReferences\n\nKrause DW et al. (12 co-authors) 2020. Skeleton of a Cretaceous mammal from Madagascar reflects long-term insularity.

The LRT agrees with the ‘a’ oversimplified cladogram, the one that does not split Arboroharamiya from Jeholobaatar.\n\nIn similar fashion,\n\nthe large reptile tree (LRT, 1612+ taxa) nests multituberculates as derived rodents, despite what appears to be, in this phylogenetic context, a more primitive middle ear morphology than found in extant rats (Rattus, Fig. 4), mice (Mus) and their closest living relatives, the aye-aye (Daubentonia). In the LRT Jeholbaatar nests at the base of the Villevolodon + Shenshou clade.\n\nTradition continues in Wang, Meng and Wang\n\nas they omit rodents from multituberculate studies while force fitting multis into a dissimilar nesting with basal mammals, including prototheres, the egg-laying mammals.\n\nIt is worthwhile comparing the skulls\n\nof the rodent, Rattus (Fig. 6), and the multituberculate, Kryptobaatar (Fig. 5). This is much more than convergence. That is why they nest close to one another in the LRT, but not as sisters.\n\nFrom the Wang, Meng and Wang 2019 abstract:\n\n“The evolution of the mammalian middle ear is thought to provide an example of ‘recapitulation’—the theory that the present embryological development of a species reflects its evolutionary history.”\n\nThis has been documented in embryo dissections.\n\n“Accumulating data from both developmental biology and palaeontology have suggested that the transformation of post-dentary jaw elements into cranial ear bones occurred several times in mammals.”\n\nIn the LRT this happened once in crown mammals, and once again in Repenomamus, a pre-mammal, Cretaceous mammal-mimic\n\n“In addition, well-preserved fossils have revealed transitional stages in the evolution of the mammalian middle ear. But questions remain concerning middle-ear evolution, such as how and why the post-dentary unit became completely detached from the dentary bone in different clades of mammaliaforms.”\n\nThe LRT does not recognize the clade Mammaliaformes, defined as, “the clade originating from the most recent common ancestor of Morganucodonta and the crown group mammals.” Morganucodon is a basal metatherian in the LRT.\n\n“Here we report a definitive mammalian middle ear preserved in an eobaatarid multituberculate mammal, with complete post-dentary elements that are well-preserved and detached from the dentary bones. The specimen reveals the transformation of the surangular jaw bone from an independent element into part of the malleus of the middle ear, and the presence of a restricted contact between the columelliform stapes and the flat incus.”\n\nCongratulations to the preparator. The middle ear bones are microscopic.\n\n“We propose that the malleus–incus joint is dichotomic [= classification based upon two opposites] in mammaliaforms, with the two bones connecting in either an abutting or an interlocking arrangement, reflecting the evolutionary divergence of the dentary–squamosal joint. In our phylogenetic analysis, acquisition of the definitive mammalian middle ear in allotherians such as this specimen was independent of that in monotremes and therians.”\n\nThe LRT does not recover the clade Allotheria. Rather multituberculates nest within Glires, within Rodentia close to Rattus (Fig. 4), Carpolestes and the aye-aye, Daubentonia.\n\n“Our findings suggest that the co-evolution of the primary and secondary jaw joints in allotherians was an evolutionary adaptation allowing feeding with unique palinal (longitudinal and backwards) chewing. Thus, the evolution of the allotherian auditory apparatus was probably triggered by the functional requirements of the feeding apparatus.”\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nthe authors do not compare their find to rodents. Note the similarity of the middle ear bones in Rattus (Fig. 3) to those of multituberculates. So, once again: taxon exclusion spoils a perfectly grand discovery and description.\n\nA little backstory:\n\nAs mentioned by Wang, Meng and Wang, a mammal embryo develops ontogenetically it more or less recapitulates its entire phylogenetic development, from one cell, to a ball of cells, to an embryo with gills, to an embryo with several primordial jaw bones. Three of these detach from the dentary in placentals, migrate posteriorly and become middle ear bones.\n\nMultis are different.\n\nMultis appear to have large, attached, more primitive middle ear bones, like those found in egg-laying pre-mammals. The question few appear to have asked is: why would this happen?\n\nMultis are renown\n\nfor losing (or never developing in the tradition model) their cylinder and socket jaw joint to develop a sliding jaw joint, harnessed by large muscles. A sliding jaw joint is also present in rodents.\n\nHere’s a thought:\n\nPerhaps nature found it more important for the jaw joint to slide posteriorly in multis, over the spot where tiny ear bones are found in rodents, so the middle ear bones remained in a state of arrested development, more or less attached to the posterior dentary, moving along with the sliding jaw, never attaching themselves to the base of the braincase, as in other placental mammals. This can happen by a simple matter of stopping the development of primitive large ear bones to tiny ear bones. Evidently this reversal was a successful gambit, as multis survived from the Jurassic deep into the Tertiary before finally going extinct for reasons unknown.\n\nFor the general public (popular press),\n\nthe following online article describes the specimen and its authors.\n\n“Researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) have reported a new species of multituberculate – a type of extinct Mesozoic “rodent” – with well-preserved middle ear bones from the Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China. The findings were published in Nature on November 27.”\n\nNote the use of quotation marks around the word “rodent” indicate their understanding that Jeholbaatar was not a rodent, but looked like one.\n\n“The new mammal, Jeholbaatar kielanae, has a middle ear that is distinct from those of its relatives. WANG Yuanqing and WANG Haibing from IVPP, along with MENG Jin from AMNH, proposed that the evolution of its auditory apparatus might have been driven by specialization for feeding.”\n\nAccording to the LRT, it is not the evolution of an auditory apparatus, but the reversal to to a more primitive state, because sisters all have tiny middle ear bones.\n\n“Fossil evidence shows that postdentary bones were either embedded in the postdentary trough on the medial side of the dentary or connected to the dentary via an ossified Meckel’s cartilage in early mammals, prior to their migration into the cranium as seen in extant mammals.”\n\nSee figure 7 for an illustration of this trough and migration in several taxa.\n\n“Detachment of the mammalian middle ear bones from the dentary occurred independently at least three times. But how and why this process took place in different clades of mammals remains unclear.”\n\nIt remains unclear in the Wang, Meng and Wang paper due to taxon exclusion, leading to an invalid tree topology. They why was likely due to the nocturnal and arboreal displacement of surviving mammals, requiring better hearing abilities, during the age of dinosaurs, which were their chief predators during the day.\n\n“The Jeholbaatar kielanae specimen was discovered in the Jiufotang Formation in China’s Liaoning Province. It displays the first well-preserved middle-ear bones in multituberculates, providing solid evidence of the morphology and articulation of these bony elements, which are fully detached from the dentary.”\n\nFully detached and displaced, between the teeth.\n\n“It reveals a unique configuration with more complete components than those previously reported in multituberculates. The new fossil reveals a transitional stage in the evolution of the surangular – a “reptilian” jawbone.”\n\nRemember, ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, and Jeholbaatar is a tiny specimen (Fig. 1), a precocial and phylogenetically miniaturized taxon, retaining juvenile traits, including a middle ear in an arrested state of development.\n\n“In light of current evidence, scientists argue that the primary (malleus-incus) and secondary (squamosal-dentary) jaw joints co-evolved in allotherians, allowing a distinct palinal (anteroposterior) jaw movement while chewing.”\n\nIn the LRT anteroposterior jaw movement was well established in more primitive taxa (Figs, 3, 4). The LRT does not recognize the traditional clade, ‘Allotheria’.\n\n“Selective pressure to detach the middle ear bones could have been stronger in order to increase feeding efficiency, suggesting that evolution of the middle ear was probably triggered by functional constraints on the feeding apparatus in allotherians.”\n\nActually, just the opposite, according to the LRT. Primitive placentals already had, for millions of generations, tiny middle ear bones. In multis alone neotony + phylogenetic miniaturization led to the arrested development of the middle ear bones, which moved along with the dentary during palinal (anteroposterior) jaw movement. I suggest workers add more taxa to their phylogenetic analyses. Test rodents and their relatives along with multituberculates and see what pops out.\n\nReferences\n\nLi P, Gao K, Ding D and Salvi R 2015. Characteristic anatomical structures of rat temporal bone.

Nature online\n\nhttp://english.cas.cn/newsroom/research_news/life/201911/t20191127_226412.shtml\n\nYesterday I promised a look at the new Jurassic gliding mammal, Arboroharamiya (Han et al. 2017), known from two crushed, but complete specimens (Figs. 1, 2). Originally this genus was considered a euharamiyid, close to the Jurassic squirrel-like Shenshou (Fig. 3) derived from trithelodont pre-mammals close to Haramiyavia.\n\nThe two specimens are superficially distinct\n\ndue to the width of their extraordinary gliding membranes, reinforced with stiff fibers. I have not tested the paratype specimen in the LRT yet.\n\nContra Han et al. 2017\n\nIn the large reptile tree Arboroharamiya nests with Carpolestes, Ignacius, Plesiadapis, Daubentonia and Paulchaffatia, taxa excluded from Han et al. The extant rodents, Rattus and Mus, are also related and included in the Han et al. cladogram (Fig. 3).\n\nArboroharamiya provides an unprecedented look\n\nat the post-dentary in taxa transitional between rodents + plesiadapiformes and multituberculates (Fig. 5). Earlier here, here and here multituberculates were shown to have pre-mammal post-dentary/ear bones, yet nested with placental and rodent taxa. This is a reversal or atavism, a neotonous development due to the backward shifting of the squamosal (another reversal) favoring the development of larger jaw muscles to power that uniquely shaped cutting tool, the lower last premolar. It has never been so clear as in Arboroharamiya, though.\n\nHan et al. reported, “The lower jaws are in an occlusal position and the auditory bones are fully separated from the dentary.” In the new interpretation (Fig. 5) the neotonous articular is back in contact with the neotonous quadrate (both auditory bones in derived mammals) as the squamosal shifts posteriorly to its more primitive and neotonous position toward the back of the skull. Essentially the back of the skull in Arboroharamiya and multituberculates are embryonic relative to rodents.\n\nReversals\n\ncan be confusing because they are a form of convergence arising from neotony. The LRT separates convergent taxa by nesting them correctly with a wide suite of traits and testing them with a wide gamut of taxa.\n\nWhen a few traits say: pre-mammal\n\nand a suite of traits say: rodent descendant, go with the standard for phylogenetic analysis. Only maximum parsimony reveals reversals when they appear. If you relied on just the post-dentary traits here you’d be ‘Pulling a Larry Martin‘ and nesting Arboroharamiya with pre-mammals.\n\nI didn’t think I’d have to\n\nkeep referring to the dear departed professor from Kansas, Dr. Larry Martin, but he did like to play that game. I’m encouraging others not to, whether they know they are doing so or not.\n\nReferences\n\nHan G, Mao F-Y, Bi-SD, Wang Y-Q and Meng J 2017. A Jurassic gliding euharamiyidan mammal with an ear of five auditory bones. Nature 551:451–457.\n\nUpdated the next day, January 5, 2019 with new interpretations of the post-dentary bones in figure 3, detailed here.\n\nWith the addition of four taxa\n\nto the large reptile tree (LRT, 1370 taxa), a review of the Bremer scores helped cement relationships in the Primates + Glires clade (Figs. 1, 2). Yesterday we looked at plesiadapiform taxa (within Glires, Fig. 2) leading to the aye-aye, Daubentonia. Today we’ll look at a sister clade within Glires, one that produced the clade Multituberculata.\n\nThe traditional, but invalid outgroup taxon,\n\nHaramiyavia, is a pre-mammal trithelodontid not related to the rodent-and plesiadapiform- related members of the Multituberculata in the LRT. More on that hypothesis below.\n\nIn Figure 1\n\nlook for the gradual accumulation of traits in derived taxa. Carpolestes (Late Paleocene) is a late survivor from a Jurassic radiation. Paulchoffatia is Latest Jurassic. Megaconus is Middle Jurassic. Vilevolodon, Xianshou and Rugosodon are Late Jurassic. Kryptobaatar is Late Cretaceous. Ptilodus is Paleocene. So this radiation had its genesis in the Early Jurassic and some clades, like Carpolestes, had late survivors.\n\nIt’s worth noting\n\nthat the one key trait that highlights many multituberculates, the oddly enlarged last premolar of the dentary, is also a trait found in the basal taxon, Carpolestes, but not in Paulchoffatia, (Fig. 1). Paulchoffatia has the odd mandible (dentary) without a distinct retroarticular process common to multituberculates, convergent with Daubentonia. That there is also no distinct glenoid process (jaw joint) in clade members made these jaw bones even harder to understand. Then I realized the jaw joints were mobile, slung in place by muscles, as in rodents and primates, rather than a cylindrical dentary/squamosal joint, as in Carnivorans.\n\nThere is one more elephant in the room\n\nthat needs to be discussed. Earlier we looked at the splints of bone at the back of the jaws in multituberculates identified as posterior jaw bones (Fig. 3), a traditional pre-mammal trait. Multis move the squamosal to the back of the skull and reduce the ear bone coverings (ectotympanics) that nearly all other placentals use to cover the middle ear bones. This reversal to the pre-mammal condition is key to the traditional hypothesis shared by all mammal experts that multis are pre-mammals. Embryo primitive therians have posterior jaw bones, but these turn into tiny middle ear bones during ontogeny. In multis their retention in adults is yet another example of neotony.\n\nWhy lose/reverse those excellent placental middle ear bones?\n\n‘Why’ questions get into the realm of speculation. With that proviso, here we go.\n\nThe over-development of the lower last premolar\n\nindicates some sort of preference or adaptation for food requiring such a tooth. The coincident and neotonous migration of the squamosals to the back of the skull (the pre-mammal Sinoconodon condition) enlarged the temporal chewing muscles (Fig. 2). The neotonous lack of development of tiny middle ear bones was tied in to that posterior migration. Evidently Jurassic and Cretaceous arboreal multis did not need the hearing capabilities provided by the tiny middle ear bones of most therians, but they needed larger jaw muscles. Evidently they were safe in the trees because there were few to no arboreal predators of mammals back then. Multis and rodents had the trees to themselves. Evidently that changed in the Tertiary, when multis became extinct, perhaps because birds of prey (hawks and owls) became widespread and only rodents could hear them coming. That’s a lot of guesswork. Confirmation or refutation should follow.\n\nA recent paper by Han et al. 2017\n\non the Late Jurassic pre-mulltituberculate euharamiyidan, Arboroharamiya (Fig. 3), documents precisely the status of the middle ear/posteror jaw bones along with the phylogenetic reduction of the ectotympanic that frames the ear drum and forms a thin shell around the middle ear bones in more primitive members of the clade Glires (Fig. 4, evidently there is more variation in this, and I will take a look at that in the future). Han et al. report for Arboroharamiya, “The lower jaws are in an occlusal position and the auditory bones are fully separated from the dentary.” That is the mammal condition.\n\nThe Han et al cladograms\n\ninclude a rabbit and a rodent, but suffer from massive taxon exclusion. As a result they mix up prototherians, metatherians and eutherians as if shuffling a deck of cards, as compared to the LRT. My first impression is that they use too many taxa known only form dental traits when they should have deleted those until a robust tree topology was created and established with a large suite of traits from more complete taxa, as in the LRT. I will add Arboroharamiya to the LRT shortly.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nand I hate to report this, mammal experts have been guilty of depending on a short or long list of traits (which can and often do converge and reverse) to identify taxa and clades. As readers know, paleontologists should only depend on a phenomic phylogenetic analysis that tests a large suite of bone characters and a wide gamut of taxa. Analysis proves time and again to be the only way to confidently identify taxa and lump’n’split clades. Cladograms, when done correctly, weed out convergence. Otherwise, reversals, like the neotonous reappearance of post-dentary bones and the reotonous disappearance of ectotympanics, can be troublesome to deal with, causing massive confusion. A phylogenetic analysis quickly and confidently identifies reversals because all possible candidates are tested at one time.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\ndiscovering this little insight is yet another reason why other workers have dismissed the LRT, have attempted to discredit the LRT, and is causing confusion in yet another upcoming class of future paleontologists. Paleo students have to choose between relying on a short list of traits or performing a phenomic phylogenetic analysis. Only the latter actually works (see below) and avoids mixing in convergent traits.\n\nIf you don’t remember\n\n‘amphibian-like reptiles,’ those are taxa, like Gephyrostegus, Eldeceeon and Silvanerpeton, that nest at the base of all reptiles in the LRT, but have no traditional reptile traits. Everyone else considers them anamniotes. In the LRT, based solely on their last common ancestor status/nesting, these taxa are known to have evolved the amniotic membrane, the one trait, by definition, that unites all reptiles (including birds and mammals) and labels the above basal taxa, ‘amphibian-lke reptiles.’\n\nReferences\n\nHan G, Mao F-Y, Bi-SD, Wang Y-Q and Meng J 2017.
