Sunnyodon is a genus of multituberculate mammal from the Early Cretaceous period of England, although some specimens from Denmark have been assigned to the genus.

There is only one currently recognized species of Sunnyodon: S. notleyi from the Lulworth Formation. Remains assigned to an indeterminate species of Sunnyodon have also been found in the Rabekke Formation.

Inaccuracies

Sunnyodon is seen coexisting with Dromaeosauroides and Pholidosaurus. While all three of these species are known from the same time period and country, thus making it possible for these species to meet, the Danish Sunnyodon are currently only known from the Rabekke Formation, while Dromaeosauroides and the Danish Pholidosaurus are currently only known from the Jydegaard Formation.

Role

Background animal. A Sunnyodon is briefly seen on a riverbank before being attacked and killed by a Dromaeosauroides.
