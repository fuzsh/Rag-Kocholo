        "text": "Frank Zirone is the producer of ONES and a founding member of the core\n\nYEAH YEAH YEAH band. After watching a swarm of screaming girls chase the Beatles into the train station in the first scene of the movie Hard Day's Night, \"the light went on in my head\". That scene immediately answered the proverbial question \"what do you want to do with your life?” Decision made, music was to be Frank's lifelong partner. With a long and storied history in \"the biz\" he joined his first \"gigging\" band in 1968 at the age of 14 and hasn't stopped. Frank was involved with various cover bands until 1977 when he started writing, recording and performing his own songs. In 1979 Frank formed the band Zero-One, signed a deal with Anthem Records and recorded one album. Managed by Michael Cohl and Bill Ballard of Concert Productions International (CPI), Zero-One went on to tour with Max Webster, Loverboy, Saga and Toronto and were nominated for a Juno in 1981 for Best New Group before disbanding in 1982.\n\nHanover Fist was Frank's second touring act. Produced by David Bowie guitarist Stacy Heydon, the Hanover Fist Project was recorded at Pete Townshend’s Eel Pie studio in Surrey, England. The self-titled album was released in 1983 on MCA Records after Eddie Van Halen inadvertently listened to the demo tape in a borrowed car. Van Halen selected the track \"Metal of the NIght\" as the soundtrack for the movie he was working on entitled Wild Life. In 1985 MCA execs decided to change the name of band to Hanover and re-released the album, now named Hungry Eyes. Hanover then toured with Saxon throughout the U.S. for three months. Incidentally, Saxon were Rob Reiner's inspiration for the movie Spinal Tap. After the demise of Hanover, Frank went on to tour with The Monkees, Triumph, Gary Puckett, Herman's Hermits, Rob Grill (Grassroots) and Randy Travis. He continues to write and record in his home studio and has added authoring science fiction stories and video editing to his repertoire. Why the Beatles? \"Because I believe you should leave the dance with the same girl you came in with.\" A continual source of inspiration, the Beatles have become Frank's muse, affecting every aspect of his musical career as both a performer and songwriter. It was back in 1986 that Frank decided he would, some day, create the ultimate Beatle's music band. In 2014 he did, and now in 2016, Frank Zirone presents ONES.\n\nIf you look up the word music in the dictionary you are sure to find Bruce Nasmith's name in the definition. Becoming skilled on a variety of instruments at a very early age, Bruce has been a full-time musician his entire life. Self-taught on the guitar, he also plays violin and recorder. His formal training in piano and classical organ have produced a long list of credentials and commendations. A graduate of the Royal Conservatory of Music in piano performance, piano teaching and music theory and composition, he also studied classical organ, receiving the Kathleen Stokes scholarship. He graduated from the Royal Canadian College of Organists winning both the Healey Willan scholarship and the Rollinson Prize. While residing in Australia he completed an Associateship diploma in classical guitar performance and a Licentiateship in classical organ performance, lectured at the West Australian Academy of Performing Arts and adjudicated the Busselton Music Festival for three years. When he returned to Canada Bruce took up the position of Music Director at Armour heights Presbyterian Church where he continues to conduct the choir and play the organ. He has released two albums, \"Pleasure and Pain\" and \"The Twelve Months\", fronted the rock band Stratosphere, performed and toured with classic rock trio Wild Blue Yonder, currently plays in the classic rock band The Petition with Frank Russell and is a also a member of The Too Drunk to Fish Band. Approached by Frank Zirone to join the YEAH YEAH YEAH band, Bruce, a lifelong lover of The Beatles music, enthusiastically accepted the invitation and also recommended Frank Russell for the project. Bruce is very much at home with all aspects of arranging and performing The Beatles music and directs the Penny Lane Strings and the Pepperland Horns for the ONES show.\n\nKevin Rolston has been plucking the strings of the bass guitar for 45 years, and during those 45 years he has performed across Canada, the U.S. and Europe. An engineer for Ontario Hydro (don't bother complaining to him about your rates, he's heard it all) Kevin also blows a sweet harmonica, backs up on guitar and sings! A few of the folks he's performed with include David Bendith (Locomotive), Dan Hill, Frank Zirone, and the John Stewart Band. An avid hockey player, Kevin participates in tournaments around the world including Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, the U.K. and the U.S. Why the Beatles? \"As a musician it's the challenge of playing and singing their music 'right', plus the variety of tunes which cross all the musical genres,\" ensuring no one ever gets bored. There's a tune for everyone and everyone has their favourite(s). Quiet and unassuming, Kevin is quite content to remain in the background, part of the backbone of the band (along with the drums). However, he gets an immense kick out of watching people singing along, dancing, and the general delight of the audience, when the band plays Beatles tunes.\n\nFrank Russell's three passions in life are drumming, his daughter and fishing... not necessarily in that order. Raised in Hamilton, Ontario, (known locally as The Hammer), he started tapping out a beat as a young boy using rolled up newspapers as drumsticks and his legs as a drum kit. Persistent and determined, he practiced constantly, on anything and anyone. Using a set of borrowed Bolero's, he played his first professional gig, finally purchasing his first set of drums, a Rogers kit, in his late teens. Today he uses his British-made, red Premiers and has been drumming professionally for almost 50 years. Frank also teaches and his expertise has been reflected in two of his students, both of whom were accepted into the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Berklee is the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world and operates a second campus in Valencia, Spain. Frank has recorded with Plateau (The Subway Album), Downchild Blues Band (We Deliver) and Lee Aaron (Metal Queen). He has also added his expert metering skills to many bands including Buzzsaw, Moxy, Ten Mile Drive, The Petition and Roadhouse among others. A singer and songwriter, he composes his own material using his six- and twelve-string guitars, another skill he learned watching his father play. Joining the YEAH YEAH YEAH band in 2014, Frank considers The Beatles one of the best songwriting teams of all time and Ringo one of the most underrated drummers in the world. After hearing Frank sing, the band immediately dubbed him \"Fringo\". It fits....perfectly.\n\n“David Love would be my first choice for super solid guitar playing and vocal back up on any rock band I put together. He's also a 'gearhead' like myself and a fount of rock and roll information. My times onstage and in the studio with him have all been memorable and tons of fun.” Randy Bachman, O.C.\n\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, David Love is a guitarist (45 years), singer and voice-over artist. He began to play professionally in 1975 when he joined the Top 40 band Titan. In 1977 he joined Dodger and performed with them across Ontario and Northern Quebec. \"Like many Canadian musicians before and since, (I) traveled across the country in a cramped van playing anywhere and everywhere.\" In 1979 David decided to take a break from a full-time career in music and returned to college to study logistics, eventually working with a number of transportation companies. By 1989 he was back in \"the business\" and formed the quartet, The Intenders. Four years later, in 1993, he joined The Carpet Frogs, a band he remained with for 18 years and who are well-known for their work with Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman. David himself has worked extensively with the two former Guess Who members having also been a 14-year member of The Burton Cummings Band and a 5-year member of The Bachman Cummings Band. From 1998 until his departure from The Carpet Frogs, David was the principal harmony singer for Cummings. In 2012 he formed his own band, The David Love Band, a power-pop trio that focuses on the music of the 60's. Think Yardbirds, Chambers Brothers, Tommy James and the Shondells, The Tremelos, and of course, The Beatles. David has recorded numerous albums with The Carpet Frogs, Burton Cummings and The Bachman Cummings Band and has criss-crossed Canada many times, performing on average 100 shows a year, including a special show for our troops at Canadian Forces Base Kandahar in Afghanistan. In 2014, David performed in the Classics Album Live tribute to The Beatles 'Let It Be' at Massey Hall. A perfect segue. As the newest member of the YEAH YEAH YEAH band and ONES, he brings us his love of The Beatles and all things 60's.\n\nDevoting her life to performing, teaching and sharing her love and knowledge of music to audiences around the world, Sonia is also an avid blogger, an award-winning gardener and Half Ironman Triathlete.

Her deep passion for music and her love of the Beatles shine through in her beautifully crafted multi-media shows for both the YEAH YEAH YEAH band and now ONES. Her love of Beatles history is apparent and comes to the fore with each song. Jain has studied both piano and clarinet in her youth and although she has never performed professionally, she continues to play the piano at home in her spare time, finding it both cathartic and liberating. According to Jain, she is forever learning new and exciting things about the songs of the Beatles. She is particularly impressed with how their special, creative dynamic impacted people and how their music ricocheted around the world, and continues to every day. \"I will never forget back in the mid 90’s while on a trip to Brazil, being at a friend’s family farm and hearing someone with a guitar singing Yesterday. No hydro or running water for miles and miles but somehow the music got through. All the locals, many of which spoke little or no English, knew every word and sang along as if it was a sacred hymn in church. The Beatles are a touchstone, a constant reminder that great music will always be an integral part of my life.\" Jain's mission is to visually transport the audience into the \"Beatles Zone\" during the ONES show, and she accomplishes this with aplomb.\n\nTry and get a straight answer from a \"sound guy\" when you ask him about his life in the music business. According to Jeff it's all Bruce's (Nasmith) fault! If Bruce hadn't had the Rice Krispies camel train running on his desk in home room on their first day of junior high \"I might not have thought, oh, here's an interesting fellow. I rather imagine we could become pals and do fun things together for many years to come.\" Jeff subsequently learned to translate his 'intrinsic nerdiness' and love of music into something fun and exciting - sound engineering. In the intervening 43 years since meeting Bruce, Jeff has mixed professionally for about six of thoses years. He doesn't play any instruments....at least, according to Jeff, \"not so you'd notice.\" He enjoys the challenge of refurbishing old audio gear with his business card clearly stating, \"If I can't fix it, it probably can't be fixed.\" A Beatles fan since the Help album in 1965, Jeff considers them the forerunners of \"prog rock\". Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Genesis, Yes, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd were all influenced by the writings of John and George. You'll find Jeff sitting quietly at his sound board, unperturbed by the commotion around him, ears tuned to the nuances of the sounds emanating from the musicians on stage.\n\nFrom Hamilton Ontario, Peter Genrick has been in the thick of the entertainment industry for over 35 years. Launching his career in the world of rock 'n roll with the band Vehicle, he worked as a \"light man\" for many rock groups from the 1970's to the 1990's including the infamous Teenage Head, local act Steve Madden and his band Reckless, and western bands Trooper and Headpins. The early 90's found Peter working on the set of the Canadian/German soap opera Family Passions by day....by night you would find him at the popular Toronto nightclub Berlin as their in-house lighting tech. It was here he met Walter Zwol (Brutus), who had formed an all-star band for the nightclub that included Peter Meuller (Tom Cochrane), Rick Grattan (Rough Trade), Asher Horowitz (Lisa Dalbello band) and Bobby Economou (Blood, Sweat and Tears). Peter arranged with Berlin's owners to shoot a rock video of the band's performance, one of his first forays into video production. In 1999 Peter was working on the biopic The Jesse Ventura Story when he was asked to be a stunt driver for the scene of Ventura riding his Harley with his \"new bride\". Thankfully the scene was completed in two takes with no wipeouts. Peter developed extensive knowledge in the field of lighting for both large and small venues including bars, theatres and large concert/sound stages. His hands-on experience was valuable to Humber College where he was invited to teach, lecturing on the various aspects of theatre lighting. Today Peter is a \"gaffer\", (which in layman's terms is head lighting technician), in the film, television and new media industries. One memorable project was working director Roland Joffe, shooting a feature film in Moscow, for the better part of a year. Peter also produces and directs live videos for a number of performers including the David Barrett Trio. If you're wandering the streets of Toronto and notice the distinctive orange cones taking up all the parking spots, keep your eyes peeled for Peter, chances are you'll run into him working on another one of his many shoots.\n\n(Beatles connection: During the 1980's Peter, for the first and last time, was hired to do sound for Richie Walker and Hotel Street Band. After heading to Hawaii for a gig, Walker took Peter to the local Hare Krisha compound to meet Cat Stevens. As the room filled up people, Peter found himself standing next to George Harrison)\n\nHailing from London, Ontario, Pat Blythe has been involved in the entertainment business in one capacity or another for almost 40 years.
