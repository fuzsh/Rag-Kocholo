        "text": "Why do we love cover bands so much?\n\nIs it the way they make us feel when we hear our favorite songs? Is it the promise of a good time the minute the first note is played? Could it be the way the crowd reacts? And the feeling of being lost in a moment? It’s all of the above.\n\nThe great thing about hiring a cover band is the ability to pick your perfect match. Want a 70’s style act for gen X or a 90’s nostalgia show for millennials? You got it! Want a band that plays everything in between? You can have that too!\n\nA cover band is perfect for events that require quality live music for broad demographics. Start your festival or fair with a bang. Get the crowd hyped and ready for your headliners. Your holiday gatherings would be amiss without that party vibe. Whatever the event, a cover band is a great choice.\n\nBHI has top quality bands that suit virtually every budget. Contact us to find the perfect one for your next event."
