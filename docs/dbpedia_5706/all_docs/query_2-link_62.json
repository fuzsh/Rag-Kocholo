        "text": "CEPA annual report for 2022 to 2023 [PDF - 2.4 MB]\n\n1 Introduction\n\nPreventing pollution and protecting the environment and human health lies at the heart of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA), (the Act). The Government delivers many of the environmental and health protection programs administered by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Health Canada (HC) through CEPA, such as the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP), the National Environmental Emergencies Center and the Air Quality Program. CEPA is also the legislative basis to implement several regulations and risk management instruments related to waste, disposals at sea, fuels, and emissions from vehicles, engines and equipment, as well as Canada’s obligations under numerous international environmental agreements, such as the Basel Convention and the London Protocol.\n\nThis annual report provides an overview of the activities conducted and results achieved under CEPA from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 by both ECCC and HC. It responds to the statutory requirement in Section 342 of the Act to provide an annual report to Parliament on its administration and enforcementFootnote 1 .\n\n1.1 Bill S-5, Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act\n\nIntroduced in February 2022, Bill S-5, Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act, received Royal Assent on June 13, 2023. The Bill modernizes the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) and represents the first set of comprehensive amendments to CEPA since it was enacted over 20 years ago and includes new requirements to report annually on certain CEPA activitiesFootnote 2 .\n\nWhile Bill S-5 was not in effect during the fiscal year covering the activities included in this annual report, best efforts were made to include information in this report where available and possible. Where information was not available for this report, an implementation plan is in place and steps are being taken to collect the information for subsequent reports.\n\nWith this Bill, the Government of Canada delivered on its commitment to strengthen CEPA and recognize, for the first time in federal law, that every individual in Canada has a right to a healthy environment as provided under the Act. The Government will develop an implementation framework which will set out how the right will be considered in the administration of the Act and elaborate on principles such as environmental justice, intergenerational equity, and non-regression. It will also describe relevant factors to consider in interpreting and applying the right and determining its reasonable limits. The Government also confirmed its commitment to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and incent action on reconciliation through a requirement to report annually on consultations, findings, recommendations, or measures taken in that regard (see section 6.3 of this report).\n\nIn addition to the recognition of the right to a healthy environment, other amendments introduced by Bill S-5 include:\n\na new plan of Chemicals Management Priorities\n\nWith new chemicals being developed, new uses for existing chemicals, increasingly complex supply chains, and emerging science about risks including cumulative effects, the CEPA amendments require the Government to establish a new plan to prioritize the ongoing assessment of risks from chemicals. This plan will include timelines, a strategy to reduce reliance on vertebrate animal testing, consider class-based assessment approaches as a means of avoiding regrettable substitutions, as well as labelling and other means to provide meaningful information to the public. The amendments also require that this plan be reviewed at least every eight years.\n\nsupporting the shift to safer chemicals\n\nIn addition to changes to risk assessment and risk management activities, CEPA amendments require the Minister of Environment and Climate ChangeFootnote 3 to maintain a Watch List - a list of substances that can pose a risk and thereby meet the criteria in Section 64 of CEPA if, for example, uses change or exposure increases.\n\nincreased transparency in decision-making\n\nIndividuals in Canada may request that a chemical be assessed and require the Minister of Environment and Climate Change and the Minister of Health (the Ministers) to consider and respond to any such requests. The amendments also require that the Government communicate anticipated timelines for completing risk assessments and for proposing subsequent risk management actions when a substance is found to meet the criteria to require risk management. Industry will also be required to provide a rationale to support requests for the confidentiality of business information, and the Ministers will be required to review and validate a statistically representative sample of these requests and report on the results. In addition, the amendments establish the circumstances under which the Ministers may disclose the explicit names of masked substances or living organisms.\n\na stronger regime for toxic substances that pose the highest risk\n\nFor substances that are determined to be toxic under CEPA and that meet criteria for posing the highest risk, the amendments to CEPA require that the Ministers give priority to prohibiting activities involving these substances. The criteria for these substances will include the existing regulations on persistence and bioaccumulation, as well as new criteria that will be set out in regulations on carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity, and substances that pose the highest risk. These regulations will be developed in consultation with stakeholders.\n\nrisk assessments of new living organisms under Part 6 of the Act\n\nAmendments to CEPA require the Ministers to consult interested persons when assessing new living organisms that are vertebrate animals or otherwise prescribed by regulation.\n\nreducing reliance on vertebrate animal testing\n\nAmendments to CEPA recognize the need to reduce reliance on the use of vertebrate animal testing when assessing the risks that substances may pose to human health and the environment. These amendments require the Government to support the development and use of scientifically justified alternative methods and strategies to replace, reduce, or refine the use of vertebrate animals in toxicity testing, as science permits.\n\nchanges to the Food and Drugs Act to strengthen the environmental risk assessment and risk management of drugs\n\nAmendments to the Food and Drugs Act expand the Minister of Health's ability to manage environmental risks resulting from drugs, and the ability to develop modernized environmental risk assessment and risk management regulations for drugs under the Food and Drugs Act.\n\nThe ability to put in place geographically targeted regulations, as appropriate, including to help address pollution “hot spots”.\n\n1.2 CEPA management cycle\n\nCEPA provides the authority for the Government of Canada to take action on a wide range of environmental and human health risks – from chemicals, to pollution, to wastes. The Act provides a suite of instruments and measures to identify, assess and address these risks.\n\nThe steps taken to address each risk constitute a management cycle (see Figure 1). At each stage of the cycle:\n\nindustries, individuals, interest groups and others are invited to participate in the public consultations and decision-making processes\n\nthe Government works closely with their partners in domestic and international jurisdictions and agencies\n\nFigure 1. The CEPA management cycle\n\nLong description\n\nThis diagram shows the steps of the CEPA management cycle. There is a large oval in the centre of the diagram which represents:\n\nPublic participation and intergovernmental co-operation and Aboriginal consultation\n\nThe six ovals arranged in a circle around the large oval in the centre represent:\n\nresearch and monitoring\n\nrisk assessment\n\nrisk management\n\ncompliance promotion\n\nenforcement\n\nperformance measurement, evaluation and reporting\n\nThis report provides information on all stages of the management cycle:\n\nResearch and Monitoring (sections 2 and 7) covers the monitoring and surveillance activities that allow experts to determine levels and trends of chemicals, air pollutants and waste disposal affecting the environment and human health\n\nRisk Assessment (section 3) covers information gathering and risk assessment for substances, air pollution and greenhouse gases, water quality, and waste\n\nRisk Management (section 3) covers risk management for substances, air pollution and greenhouse gases, water quality, and waste\n\nCompliance promotion and enforcement (section 4) provides information on the planned activities undertaken to increase awareness, understanding and compliance with the Act and regulations\n\nReporting programs and emission inventories (section 5) covers information on releases of pollutants and greenhouse gases\n\nAdministration, public participation and engagement with Indigenous Peoples (section 6) covers stakeholder engagement and inter-jurisdictional relationships\n\nThe CEPA Registry is an accessible online source of current information relating to the Act. It gives people in Canada the opportunity to learn how the federal government administers the Act and is a comprehensive source of information on a variety of CEPA-related tools, including proposed and existing policies, guidelines, codes of practice, government notices and orders, agreements, permits, and regulations. The Registry invites industries, individuals, interest groups and others to participate in the public consultations and decision-making processes that take place under the Act.\n\n2 Monitoring the environment and human health\n\nMonitoring changes in the environment and human health trends is essential for assessing the impact of toxic substances. It is also essential for assessing the effectiveness of measures put in place to minimize environmental harm and reduce current and potential threats to human life.\n\n2.1 Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators\n\nThe Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators (CESI) program is a key mechanism whereby the Government of Canada monitors and publishes information on all aspects of environmental quality. CESI produces indicators on environmental sustainability issues including climate change, air quality, water quality and availability, wildlife, biodiversity, habitat, pollution, and toxic substances. The program works with partners to analyze and communicate the state of Canada’s environment, including historical trends, in a straightforward and transparent manner. CESI provides citizens, Parliamentarians, policy makers and researchers with comprehensive, unbiased, and authoritative environmental information. CESI is the prime instrument used to measure progress of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and responds to ECCC's commitments under CEPA and the Department of the Environment Act to report on the state of the environment.\n\nThe Indicators published on the CESI website show national and regional data along with contextual analysis and the methodologies explaining each indicator. CESI makes understanding the data easier through interactive tools such as Power BI dashboards and interactive maps that enable the user to quickly explore Canada's local and regional environmental indicators. The corresponding datasets are also published in the Government of Canada Open Data Portal (see Table 1 for CESI updates and new releases in 2022-2023).\n\n2.2 Chemicals\n\n2.2.1 Chemicals in our environment\n\nMonitoring programs contribute to efforts both domestically and abroad. The following programs contribute to national monitoring activities:\n\nthe Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) Environmental Monitoring and Surveillance Program\n\nthe Northern Contaminants Program (NCP)\n\nthe Freshwater Quality Monitoring Program\n\nthe St. Lawrence Action Plan\n\nthe Canada-Ontario Agreement on Great Lakes Water Quality and Ecosystem Health (COA)\n\nthe Great Lakes Basin (GLB) Monitoring and Surveillance Program\n\nthe Global Atmospheric Passive Sampling network (GAPS)\n\nthe Whales Initiative\n\nCanada’s Plastics Science Agenda\n\nMonitoring activities which support Canada’s contribution to international efforts, include:\n\nthe Canada-United States Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement\n\nthe Great Lakes Herring Gull Contaminants Monitoring Program\n\nthe Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement\n\nthe Arctic Council’s Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme and the Arctic Contaminants Action Program\n\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe’s Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution\n\nthe United Nations Environment Programme’s Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Minamata Convention on Mercury\n\nIn particular, the CMP Environmental Monitoring and Surveillance Program involves the collection of data on the concentration of chemical substances in various environmental media across Canada. Environmental media include surface water, sediment, air, aquatic biota and wildlife. Wastewater system influent, effluent and biosolids are also monitored across a range of input and treatment system types. These activities provide data to inform the assessment and management of chemical substances in the environment.\n\nExamples of priority substances monitored in 2022-2023 as part of the CMP Environmental Monitoring and Surveillance Program\n\nPer- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs)\n\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\n\nPolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)\n\nOther flame retardants\n\nOrganochlorine pesticides\n\nChlorinated alkanes\n\nBisphenols\n\nMetals, including mercury\n\nOrganotins\n\nTriclocarban\n\nQuaternary Ammonium Compounds\n\nA selection of the numerous papers on the presence of chemicals in the environment published by ECCC scientists in 2022-2023 are highlighted below.\n\nPrediction of bisphenol A contamination in Canadian municipal wastewater\n\nAbstract: Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most common contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs), which pose a threat to human health. Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered as the major pathway of BPA entering the aqueous environment. To control and mitigate BPA contamination in the aquatic environment, predicting BPAs fate at WWTPs is critical. In this study, three machine learning models, including shared layer multi-task neural network (MLT-NN), genetic programming (GP), and extra trees (ET) are used to predict the effluent BPA concentration at 12 municipal WWTPs across Canada. Additionally, the theory of networks is adopted to analyze the interdependencies among the influencing factors of BPA removal. It is found that the proposed models can provide reasonable BPA effluent concentration predictions. They have advantages in alleviating data sparsity and imbalance, improving model interpretability, and measuring predictor importance, which is valuable for the modeling of BPA and many other CECs. The network analysis results imply there are moderate interdependencies among various influencing factors of BPA removal. Factors that significantly affect BPA effluent concentration and are thus important for BPA removal are identified. The results also show that BPA is unlikely to be removed at primary treatment plants, while BPA removal could be achieved through secondary or tertiary treatment. This study presents an integrated framework for the modeling and analysis of BPA at WWTPs, which can provide direct and robust decision support for the management of BPA as well as other emerging contaminants in municipal wastewater.\n\nHighlights:\n\na framework for Bisphenol A (BPA) modeling at wastewater plants is proposed\n\ndata from 12 plants are used to develop data-driven models for BPA prediction\n\ninfluencing factors of BPA removal are studied using network theory\n\nthe results imply that BPA can hardly be removed through primary treatment\n\nimportant factors for BPA removal at wastewater treatment plants are identified\n\nPublication: Zhou, P., Li, Z., El-Dakhakhni, W., Smyth, S.A., 2022.

The aim of this study is to assess the levels of these lesser-known elements in fishes of the Great Lakes.\n\nResults: Concentrations of ten technology-critical elements (Ce, Gd, Hf, Ir, Os, Re, Ru, Ta, W, Y) were measured in the muscle of six fish species collected from Lakes Erie and Ontario, as well as their relationships to body size and condition to understand whether biological factors affect their bioaccumulation. The highest concentrations detected were for Ce in the muscle of trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) from Lake Erie, and in the muscle of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) from Lake Ontario. There were negative relationships for W and Y with length in S. namaycush and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii), respectively. Also, there was a negative relationship for Gd with weight in M. thompsonii. The regressions showed that Ta showed positive relationship with both length and weight of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from Lake Erie, whereas this element showed a negative correlation (p < 0.05) with the Fulton factor in S. namaycush from Lake Ontario. These first results suggest that technology-critical elements vary within and among species from two of the Great Lakes, with some decreasing with increasing fish size, and that these data could serve as baseline information to assess trends in fish populations in these systems. This study was conducted in collaboration the Unversidad de Concepción, McMaster University, and Toyo University.\n\nPublication: Celis, J.E., W. Espejo, K. Kidd, D. McGoldrick, M. Clark, D.

DOI:10.22034/IAR.2022.1966270.1325\n\n2.2.2 Chemicals in humans\n\nHC human biomonitoring efforts continued in 2022-2023 with the national biomonitoring program conducted under the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), measuring environmental chemical exposures in a nationally representative sample of Canadians aged 3 to 79 years. Collection of data for cycle 7 of the CHMS experienced delays due to modernization efforts at Statistics Canada and subsequently the COVID-19 outbreak. Biomonitoring data collection for cycle 7 of the CHMS survey started in January 2023 and is planned for completion in late 2024. Cycle 7 includes emerging chemicals such as BPA substitutes, glyphosate, DEET and neonicotinoid pesticides, as well as the first samples collected from children aged 1 to 2 for metals in blood.\n\nIn order to generate timely baseline data for certain priority chemicals impacted by the delay in CHMS cycle 7, and to collect additional data points necessary to calculate time trends for certain priority chemicals measured in previous CHMS cycles, a CHMS biobank analysis was initiated in 2020. At year-end 2022-2023, the biobank analysis for a number of priority pesticides (including glyphosate and DEET), flame retardants, and self-care and consumer product chemicals had been completed, and the data were being validated. The data will be released online via the Canadian Biomonitoring Dashboard through PHAC’s Health Infobase. The release of the dashboard with the existing CHMS (cycle 1 to 6) dataset alongside initial biobank data is planned for fiscal year 2023-2024.\n\nInternal and external consultations for drafting the chemical list for Cycle 8 were completed and input has been consolidated.\n\nActivities of the CHMS in 2022-2023 included:\n\npublication of two peer-reviewed scientific articles:\n\nIntroducing the international human biomonitoring health-based guidance value (HB2GV) dashboard\n\nCharacterizing variability in total mercury hair:blood ratio in the general Canadian population\n\ndevelopment of the Canadian Biomonitoring Dashboard on the Health Infobase platform, with the goal of launching the dashboard and releasing initial results from the CHMS biobank project in the 2023-2024 fiscal year\n\nCHMS biomonitoring data continues to inform Health Canada’s risk assessment and management activities. For example, CHMS cycle 1, 3, 4, and 5 data were used in a dioxins and furans performance evaluation report published in July 2022, which demonstrated that concentrations have remained stable since 2007 in the Canadian population.\n\nsuccessfully integrated Canadian national biomonitoring data in the European Commission’s ‘Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring’ (IPCHEM) databases, greatly enhancing access to the CHMS data and facilitating comparison of CHMS data with other international/European datasets by policy and research communities\n\nlaunch of the Human Biomonitoring Health-Based Guidance Value (HB2GV) Dashboard, a HC initiative, under the auspices of International Human Biomonitoring Guidance Values Working Group and International Society of Exposure Science (ISES). The database allows search of health-based guidance values for priority chemical substances, and comparison of population concentrations against guidance values. This also aids prioritization of chemicals for monitoring, assessment and research.\n\nThe National Biomonitoring Program organized, co-chaired and provided secretariat support for the annual International Human Biomonitoring (i-HBM) Working Group meeting at the ISES conference in Portugal.\n\nThe Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study was established in 2007 to obtain national biomonitoring data for pregnant women and their infants, and to examine possible adverse health effects of prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals on pregnancy and infant health. There are several follow-up studies under the MIREC Research Platform, including:\n\nthe MIREC-ID (Infant Development) study\n\nthe MIREC-CD3 (Child Development at 3 years) and MIREC-CD Plus (Early Childhood Biomonitoring and Neurodevelopment) studies\n\nthe MIREC-ENDO (Pubertal Timing, Endocrine and Metabolic Function) study\n\nHC continued analysis and publication of biomonitoring and research results from the MIREC Research Platform. These included novel assessments of prenatal and early-childhood exposure to chemicals and the establishment of national estimates of maternal and fetal exposures (see section 7.1.2.1 for publications).\n\nPhase 2 of the MIREC ENDO study started in-person recruitment in Q1 of 2022-2023 and by year-end 2022-2023 was recruiting participants from eight sites, with two more to come online. By the end of 2022-2023, 63% of participants contacted were interested in participating in Phase 2.\n\nThe MIREC Biobank, created at the beginning of the MIREC study in 2008, has grown with each follow-up study. The Biobank stores all the data and biological specimens collected since the inception of MIREC. Novel measures added to the Biobank in 2022-2023 include immune system biomarkers. At year-end 2022-2023, the MIREC biobank had six preliminary Biobank access requests under review, and five full Biobank access requests had been approved.\n\nDuring the 2022-2023 fiscal year, 13 MIREC Research Platform papers were published, including the MIREC Research Platform’s 100th publication. Nine of 13 publications were co-authored by Health Canada, using biomonitoring and research data from the MIREC cohort. These studies investigated prenatal and lactational exposure to multiple chemicals and associations with child health and neurodevelopment outcomes.\n\nOther MIREC knowledge transfer activities for 2022-2023 included:\n\nproviding data from MIREC participants for silver, dioxins and furans in support of risk assessment and performance measurement activities within HC\n\ncontributing data to the draft risk profile for Chlorpyrifos with the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (PORC-17)\n\nscientific presentations at International Conferences, including the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology and the U.S. National PFAS conference.\n\nMonitoring in the North\n\nBoth ECCC and HC contributed to the Northern Contaminants Program (NCP) led by Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC). HC partners with CIRNAC on the human health component of the NCP, which addresses concerns about human exposure to elevated levels of contaminants in wildlife species important to the traditional diets of northern Indigenous peoples. In 2022-2023, HC supported six human biomonitoring and health projects under the NCP in several Arctic regions including the Yukon, Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Northwest Territories, and in Nunavik. These projects addressed:\n\nexposure to contaminants and links to country foods\n\nunderstanding dietary decision-making and supporting the development of communication materials\n\nthe integration of information on country foods, nutrition, food security and health messaging\n\nidentifying sources and patterns of persistent organic pollutants (POPs)\n\nunderstanding the health impacts of elevated exposure to perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs)\n\nThis work forms the basis of Canada’s contribution to the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program’s (AMAP) Human Health Assessment Group (HHAG), co-chaired by HC. The AMAP human health assessment was released in 2022-2023.\n\nNCP knowledge transfer activities at year-end 2022-2023 included:\n\ndata use from NCP funded projects to support several ongoing chemicals management activities in 2022-2023 (such as, Performance Measurement Evaluation (PME) reports for cadmium and arsenic, the State of PFAS report, and the Preliminary Assessment of Chromium)\n\npublication of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)’s 2021 AMAP Assessment on Human Health in the Arctic (published April 13, 2022)\n\nECCC has been a major contributor in monitoring abiotic media, aquatic biota, and wildlife, as well as Arctic ecosystem health. ECCC monitors wildlife at numerous sites across the Canadian Arctic on a biennial or annual basis under the NCP, for a large suite of legacy and new Chemicals of Emerging Arctic Concern (CEACs), as well as metals, including mercury.\n\n2.3 Air pollutants and greenhouse gases monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting activities are important for identifying and tracking levels and trends of air pollutants that impact both the environment and human health, as well as greenhouse gases that impact climate change.\n\n2.3.1 Air pollution\n\nAmbient (outdoor) air quality monitoring informs air quality management in Canada. ECCC monitors ambient air quality across the country through two complementary networks.\n\nThe National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) program provides long-term air quality data from populated regions of Canada. This program is managed through a formal agreement between the provincial and territorial governments and ECCC.\n\nThe Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) provides information on regional patterns and trends of atmospheric pollutants in both air and precipitation at rural and remote sites.\n\nThe data collected through the NAPS program and CAPMoN are used to assess the impact of air pollution on people in Canada and the environment, validate numerical air quality prediction models, evaluate the benefits and effectiveness of control measures, and report on Canada’s progress under international air agreements. NAPS data are used to track progress relative to the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS). The CAAQS are health- and environment based air quality objectives for concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ground-level ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in outdoor air. Data collected through the NAPS program, CAPMoN, and other provincial, territorial, and municipal monitoring stations are used to calculate the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators (CESI) air quality indicators. The indicators track ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ground-level ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at the national, regional, and urban levels, and at local monitoring stations.\n\nAdditional atmospheric monitoring carried out by ECCC includes the following networks:\n\nAEROCAN, the Canadian sub-network of NASA’s global AERONET satellite network, takes optical readings of solar radiation to measure atmospheric aerosols\n\nThe Canadian Brewer Spectrophotometer Network measures the total thickness of the ozone layer (known as total column ozone) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) at selected locations across Canada\n\nThe Canadian Ozonesonde Network measures vertical column ozone from ground level up to 36 km altitude by launching weekly ozonesondes affixed to balloons, providing long-term ozone data\n\nFigure 2. Canadian atmospheric monitoring sites\n\nNAPS site location data is from 2021; all others from 2023.\n\nLong description\n\nECCC makes its atmospheric monitoring data available to the public through national and international databases, including the Government of Canada Open Data Portal, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), World Data Centres for GHGs, the WMO World Data Centre for Precipitation Chemistry, and: the WMO World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre which is operated by the Meteorological Service of Canada.\n\nThe Air Quality Health Index (AQHI)\n\nData collected through the National Air Pollution Surveillance program are used to calculate the AQHI. The AQHI is a health protection tool designed to help people understand what the air quality around them means to their health. The AQHI is calculated based on the relative risks of a combination of the following common air pollutants known to harm human health:\n\nOzone (O3) at ground level\n\nParticulate matter (PM2.5/PM10)\n\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2)\n\nThe AQHI is measured on a scale ranging from 1-10+. The AQHI index values are grouped into health risk categories as shown below. These categories help to identify the level of risk easily and quickly.\n\n2.3.2 Greenhouse gases\n\nThe Canadian Greenhouse Gas Measurement Program includes observations of carbon dioxide and other GHGs from 16 long-term measurement sites across Canada (Figure 3). Among the sites is the Alert Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory. Alert serves as one of three global GHG inter-comparison sites to ensure consistent measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas concentrations across the world.\n\nFigure 3. Canadian greenhouse gas measurement program monitoring sites\n\nLong description\n\nThis map shows the 16 Environment and Climate Change Canada long term monitoring sites for the Canadian Greenhouse Gas Measurement Program: Inuvik, NT; Behchoko, NT; Cambridge Bay, NU; Alert, NU; Estevan Point, BC; Abbotsford, BC; Lac La Biche, AB; Esther, AB; Bratt’s Lake, SK; East Trout Lake, SK; Churchill, MB; Fraserdale, ON; Egbert, ON; Downsview, ON; Chapais, QC; Sable Island, NS.\n\nECCC makes its atmospheric monitoring data available to the public through national and international databases, including the Government of Canada Open Data Portal, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), World Data Centres for GHGs, the WMO World Data Centre for Precipitation Chemistry, and: the WMO World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre which is operated by the Meteorological Service of Canada.\n\nMeasurements of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 at Alert, Nunavut\n\nMeasurements of atmospheric CO2 began in July 1975 at Alert, Nunavut (Figure 4). The annual average CO2 value at Alert in 2022 was 419.8 parts per million (ppm), which is slightly higher than the annual average CO2 values at Alert in 2021 and 2020 which were 417.4 ppm and 414.9 ppm, respectively.\n\nECCC began measuring atmospheric methane (CH4) in June 1985 at Alert, Nunavut (Figure 5). The annual average CH4 value at Alert in 2022 was 1997.2 parts per billion (ppb). Annual CH4 concentrations are now increasing following the relatively stable period from about 1999 to 2007. The annual average values of CH4 at Alert in 2021 and 2020 were 1981.0 ppb and 1967.7 ppb, respectively.\n\nFigure 4: Atmospheric carbon dioxide measured at Alert, Nunavut\n\nLong description\n\nThis graph shows the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) measured in Alert, Nunavut, starting in July 1975.\n\nFigure 5: Atmospheric methane measured at Alert, Nunavut\n\nLong description\n\nThis graph shows the level of atmospheric methane (CH4) measured in Alert, Nunavut, starting in June 1985.\n\n2.4 Disposal at sea site monitoring program\n\nBy monitoring disposal sites, ECCC is able to verify that the permitting of disposals at sea is sustainable and that permit holders have continued access to suitable sites. Where monitoring indicates a problem or where the site has reached its capacity over time, management actions in the form of closing the site, moving the site, or altering the site use can occur. ECCC works with Indigenous groups, the public, and other stakeholders to ensure early and meaningful opportunities for engagement on proposed disposal activities and integration of recommendations and concerns as appropriate into monitoring and site management measures.\n\nIn 2022-2023, monitoring projects were completed at 14 ocean disposal sites nationally, which amounts to monitoring 20% of the 70 actively used sites. Due to the nature of field work cycles, analysis and interpretation of monitoring results is not always finalized in the same year that the monitoring was conducted. Therefore, any previous studies for which results have now become available are reported alongside the 2022-2023 results.\n\nPacific region\n\nIn 2022-2023, four sites were monitored in the Pacific region. In addition to the results for the 2022-2023 monitoring studies, final results are now also available for the 2021-2022 ocean bottom current monitoring at the Sand Heads disposal site.\n\nECCC collaborated with the Canadian Hydrographic Survey to complete multibeam bathymetric surveys at the Sand Heads disposal site. Multibeam bathymetric surveys measure the water depths and map the seafloor topography to delineate the disposal footprint and offer valuable temporal assessment of bathymetric and volumetric changes between surveys.\n\nMonitoring at Point Grey and Kitimat Arm 2016 disposal sites consisted of sediment grab sampling for physiochemical parameters to better understand the potential effects related to disposal activities. Monitoring at the Kitimat Arm 2016 disposal site also consisted of sediment grab sampling for toxicity testing. Monitoring of the Point Grey disposal site also consisted of biological monitoring, incorporating two methods of benthic community assessment. The first method was to repeat a morphology-based benthic study to assess whether the benthic invertebrate communities within and near the Point Grey disposal site have changed since the last study in 2010. The second method was a pilot project to explore the use of environmental genomics in sediment as a monitoring tool for the disposal at sea site monitoring program. Environmental genomics is a novel approach to biodiversity characterization that does not require collection of whole biological specimens but instead relies on recoveries and analysis of DNA from the physical environment in which they live. Results will be reported when data analysis is completed.\n\nData collection began on the seasonal current velocity and directional information 1 metre above the seafloor at the Cape Mudge disposal site, part of an ongoing effort to increase understanding of the movement of sediments at disposal sites. Natural Resources Canada is leading this work and results will be reported when data analysis is complete.\n\nWork continued on sediment contaminant monitoring in and around the Point Grey and Sand Heads disposal sites, in support of the Government of Canada’s Whales Initiative. The Disposal at Sea program’s participation in this five-year initiative (2018 to 2022), including data analysis, is ongoing and results will be reported when data analysis is completed.\n\nResults of monitoring disposal at sea sites in Pacific region in 2022-2023:\n\nSand Heads\n\nResults:\n\n(2021-2022) The results from the ocean bottom current monitoring confirmed that the site is strongly dispersive.\n\n(2022-2023) The results from the multibeam bathymetric survey confirmed that the site is located in a naturally dynamic area that is constantly changing. When comparing the 2020 and 2022 surveys, a significant amount of material has collapsed within the disposal site and moved down slope but it was not possible to conclusively determine source of material as natural river deposition or disposal at sea without extensive ground truthing.\n\nComments: ECCC is considering possible updates to the monitoring of the site, including sediment transport modelling to further understand the dynamics at the disposal site and the surrounding area.\n\nCape Mudge\n\nResults: Ocean bottom current data collection in progress.\n\nComments: Full results will be reported in the 2024-2025 CEPA annual report\n\nPoint Grey\n\nResults: The results from the sediment grab sampling confirmed that sediment contaminant concentrations were within ranges observed in results of previous past monitoring. The results from the morphology-based benthic invertebrate community study confirmed that the total biomass of macrofauna and meiofuana were similar between 2010 and 2022. There was no indication that sediment contaminants affected benthic infaunal structure and functioning in 2022 since sediment concentrations were typically higher surrounding the disposal site than within the disposal site. Analysis of the environmental genomics is in progress.\n\nComments: Results of the environmental genomics study will be reported in the 2024-2025 CEPA annual report.\n\nKitimat Arm 2016\n\nResults: Overall, the results from the sediment grab sampling confirmed that sediment contaminant concentrations within the disposal site were lower compared to outside of the disposal site. Exceptions to this were PAH, PCB, and PBDE concentrations, which were slightly higher inside the disposal site than outside but within ranges observed in results of previous monitoring and all samples passed toxicity tests. There are no concerns at this time.\n\nComments: There are currently no concerns. ECCC will continue monitoring the site at regular intervals.\n\nQuebec region\n\nIn 2022-2023, a total of six disposal sites were monitored: three in the Gaspé region and three near the Magdalen Islands, one of them (Dépôt E) being the biggest site in the area. Post-disposal hydrographic surveys were conducted at these sites and compared to the results of previous surveys, providing a “before and after” survey of the sea floor. In addition to the results for the 2022-2023 monitoring studies, final results are now also available for hydrographic surveys conducted at 6 disposal sites in 2021-22. These included four in the Gaspé region and two near the Magdalen Islands (see list below).\n\nThe sites in the Gaspé and Magdalen Islands regions were monitored with the objectives of verifying compliance with permit conditions, establishing the height of the material deposited (that is, mounds) for navigation safety purposes and to verify the dispersion of sediments. Hydrographic surveys in recent years at the disposal sites in the Gaspé region have given some perplexing results, where not all the material reported as deposited could be located at the site. The hydrographic surveys in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 also aimed to evaluate whether this situation was persisting or if compliance promotion efforts had led to improvements. Results from 2021-2022 indicated that only one site, Saint-Godefroi, remains problematic, although results were inconclusive at L’Anse-à-Brillant due to the low volume of material disposed, while 2022-2023 results showed three problematic sites (see list below).\n\nIn order to determine whether conditions at the sites have changed and if permit assumptions about currents remain valid, a video study is being planned to enable visualization of the seafloor at and around the problematic disposal sites. ECCC is also in contact with the proponents as we continue work to determine the fate of material disposed at these locations.\n\nResults of monitoring disposal at sea sites off the coast of Quebec in 2022-2023 (and previously unreported results from 2021-22):\n\nSites in Gaspé:\n\nPort-Daniel-Est (PD-6)\n\nResults: (2021-2022) 2720 m3 of material was disposed of at the site and approximately the same volume at the correct coordinates was detected with the post-disposal hydrographic survey.\n\nComments: This result represents an improvement, given the fact the surveys in 2016, 2018 and 2020 did not detect the disposed volumes. This site is considered to be non-dispersive, but a more in-depth study may be pursued in the future help to assess the situation.\n\nSaint-Godefroi (SG-2)\n\nResults:\n\n(2021-2022) 2366 m3 of material was disposed of at the site but it was not detected with the post-disposal hydrographic survey.\n\n(2022-2023) 2178 m3 was disposed of at the site but it was not detected with the post-disposal hydrographic survey.\n\nComments: Despite reported disposal volumes of 2366 m3 in 2021-22 and 2178 m3 in 2022-2023 the material was not detected at the disposal site in post-disposal hydrographic surveys in either year. This site remains problematic, with the same pattern of results for the last 7 years. Annual monitoring is still required for the site, in addition to compliance promotion with the contractor. This site remains a priority for environmental enforcement officers to visit whenever possible.\n\nL’Anse-à-Brilliant (ABR-1)\n\nResults:\n\n(2021-2022) 1500 m3 of material was disposed of at the site but not detected in the post-disposal hydrographic survey.\n\n(2022-2023) 800 m3 of material was disposed of at the site but not detected in the post-disposal hydrographic survey.\n\nComments: Despite a reported disposal volume of 1500 m3 and 800 m3 in 2022-2023, the material was not detected at the disposal site. The small volumes could explain this result as they may have dispersed before reaching the seabed. Annual monitoring is required for this site.\n\nL’Anse-à-Beaufils (AB-5)\n\nResults:\n\n(2021-2022) 5994 m3 of material was disposed of at the site in 2021-22 and approximately the same volume at the correct coordinates was detected with the hydrographic survey.\n\n(2022-2023) 3376 m3 of material was disposed in 2022-23 but no material was detected at the disposal site.\n\nComments:\n\nThe 2021-2022 result represents an improvement, given the fact the results for 2016, 2018 and 2020 did not detect the disposed volumes.\n\nThe 2022-2023 result went back to the situation of the hydrographic survey not detecting the disposed volume. Annual monitoring is required for this site and a priority for future field inspections.\n\nSites in Îles-de-la-Madeleine:\n\nMillerand (M-5)\n\nResults: (2021-2022) 9845 m3 of material was disposed of at the site and 40% of the volume was detected at the correct coordinates with hydrographic survey.\n\nComments: The result suggests a more dispersive site than expected; this trend has been observed for some years now. Hydrographic surveys showed over the time a creation of underwater sand dunes east of the disposal site, probably fed by the dredged material disposed of at the site.\n\nPointe-Basse (PBCM-1)\n\nResults:\n\n(2021-2022) 37 019 m3 of material was disposed of at the site and approximately the same volume at the correct coordinates was detected with the hydrographic survey.\n\n(2022-2023) 43 171 m3 of material was disposed of at the site and approximately the same volume at the correct coordinates was detected with the hydrographic survey.\n\nComments:\n\n(2021-2022) The west side of the site has almost reached its capacity and the minimum depth (draft) for safe navigation, so could no longer be used. The east side of the side was used for disposal in 2022-2023.\n\n(2022-2023) No concerns have been identified.\n\nL’Île-d’Entrée (IE-6)\n\nResults: (2022-2023) 9 295 m3 of material was disposed of at the site and 58% of the volume was detected at the correct coordinates with hydrographic survey.\n\nComments: Fiona storm seems to have contributed to movement of sediments outside of authorized coordinates, as shown in the surveys, which could explain the 2022 results.\n\nChenal de la Grande-Entrée (Dépôt E)\n\nResults: (2022-2023) Hydrographic surveys showed a mound at the correct coordinates, but complete volume calculations were not possible.\n\nComments: Much of the sediment disposed of to the south of the disposal site could not be calculated because there was no recent survey previously done at that exact location. The 2022-2023 data can now form a baseline for future studies.\n\nArctic region\n\nFinal results are now available for the 2021-2022 monitoring study that ECCC, in partnership with the Canadian Hydrographic Service, undertook at the Frobisher Bay disposal site in the Arctic region, in the eastern Arctic in Nunavut. The objectives of this hydrographic survey were to verify compliance with permit conditions, establish the height of the material deposited, (that is, mound), for navigation safety purposes and to verify the dispersion of sediments. Results were conclusive, even though the volume calculations were only an estimate, based on a synthetic reference image, and didn’t allow for a reliable, high-precision calculation.\n\nResults of monitoring disposal at sea sites off the Arctic coast (previously unreported in 2021-2022):\n\nFrobisher Bay (FB-01)\n\nResults: Hydrographic surveys showed a mound at the correct coordinates and approximately 92% of the sediment still in place.\n\nComments: Since volume calculations are only estimates, the stability of the disposal site cannot be validated with certainty.\n\nAtlantic region\n\nIn 2022-2023, four sites were monitored in the Atlantic region. Hydrographic monitoring surveys were conducted at the Black Point and Shippagan Gully disposal sites off the coast of New Brunswick and optical monitoring surveys were conducted at the St. Lawrence, Newfoundland fish waste disposal site and the on a beach adjacent to the Point Sapin Small Craft Harbour disposal site.\n\nIn addition to the results for the 2022-2023 monitoring studies, final results are now also available for the three 2021–2022 monitoring studies and one 2019-2020 monitoring study and all are provided in this report. The 2021-2022 studies included hydrographic monitoring surveys conducted at the Black Point, NB and Shippagan Gully, NB disposal sites and an optical monitoring study conducted at the Charlottetown, Labrador fish waste disposal site. The 2019-2020 study was a physicochemical and biological sediment monitoring study conducted at the Black Point, NB disposal site. Results are explained by disposal site.\n\nBlack Point disposal site, New Brunswick\n\nThe Black Point disposal site is located in the Bay of Fundy and was initially believed to be dispersive. However, repetitive hydrographic surveys have shown significant sediment build-up, and an analysis of these surveys determined an average net retention rate of disposed material of 29.1%. Given this accumulation, ECCC is now assessing the elevation of the accumulated material annually, as per the site management plan, to confirm that the disposed material accumulation is less than 7 metres above the 1959 baseline elevation. The 7 metre threshold was selected by the DAS program as a conservative navigational criterion. In January 2021, ECCC moved the active release zone to a more northerly area of the disposal site as the elevation was approaching the 7 metre height difference criteria. The July 2021 and June 2022 hydrographic surveys were compared to each other and the 1959 baseline survey. Results showed that the release zone is well below the 7 metre height threshold.\n\nIn November 2019, sediment samples were collected from within the Black Point, NB disposal site and three associated reference areas located in the outer Saint John Harbour to undertake physical and chemical analyses and assessments of the biological communities. These types of monitoring are conducted every five years to understand short-term and longer-term environmental changes, if any, at and around the disposal site. Based on the collective analyses of the physical, chemical, and biological data, it is likely that the low abundance, richness and diversity at the disposal site are primarily a result of the physical impacts of the regular disposal of dredged sediments at the site, rather than because of contaminant concentrations in the discharged sediments. The results of the 2019 study are consistent with previous findings based on samples collected from 1959 to 2002, indicating that there has been little biological change at the disposal site, particularly since 2001 when the surrounding area was thoroughly sampled.\n\nShippigan Gully disposal site, New Brunswick\n\nMonitoring at the Shippagan Gully disposal site is driven by the need to monitor the fate of disposed materials and to verifiy the rate of dispersion against that predicted by the model. Three hydrographic surveys were conducted in 2021 (spring, summer and fall) following the completion of disposal activities. The surveys were compared to each other and to the 2019 baseline survey. The results of the hydrographic surveys were be shared with Saint Mary’s University, to be used in their proposed research program on the beneficial re-use of the dredged material and effectiveness of mitigation measures related to the Piping Plover Recovery Strategy.\n\nOver the five and a half month timeframe of the 2021 hydrographic surveys, the disposal site did not appreciably diminish in size or configuration. When compared to the 2019 baseline, the seabed did not appear to be accreting material as the bathymetry remained essentially constant. It was concluded that five and a half months was not sufficient time to observe appreciable dispersion of the disposed material subsequent to the conclusion of disposal activities. Therefore, in 2022-2023, spring, summer and fall bathymetric surveys were conducted again in the area surveyed in 2021-2022. These 2022-2023 surveys will be compared to each other, to the 2021-2022 surveys and to the 2019 baseline survey and the results of these analyses will be reported in the 2024-2025 CEPA report.\n\nFish waste disposal sites: Charlottetown, Labrador and St. Lawrence, Newfoundland\n\nFish waste disposal sites are selected to be dispersive so that fish waste does not accumulate on the seafloor. Representative monitoring of fish waste disposal sites was conducted in 2021-2022 and in 2022-2023 to ensure that there was no build-up of fish waste or other visual indicators of impacts. The optical surveys were completed using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with a 4K GoPro attachment (that is, video footage).\n\nIn 2021-2022, a pre-disposal optical monitoring study was conducted at the Charlottetown, Labrador fish waste disposal site. There were no visual signs of fish waste build-up or environmental impacts resulting from disposal activities. In 2022-2023, two optical monitoring studies were conducted at the St. Lawrence, Newfoundland fish waste disposal site; one survey following the conclusion of disposal activities and the second after the winter storm season in order to assess the dispersiveness of the disposal site. Results confirmed that the site is dispersive and no evidence of fish waste or other impacts were observed.\n\nPoint Sapin Small Craft Harbour disposal site, New Brunswick\n\nAt the Point Sapin, NB DFO SCH, annual maintenance dredging is required to maintain safe navigational depths. Dredging is done by an excavator from the beach and the dredged material is then transported, by truck, to a near shore disposal site. Access to the dredge area is via an existing road/path which crosses a small section of Piping Plover Critical Habitat. In order to ensure protection of this critical habitat during dredging and disposal operations, several mitigation measures are in place, including restricting the timing of activities to a time of year when Piping Plover are not present, restricting equipment on the beach to just the required transit path and the use of truck mats on the transit path should the beach not be frozen. It is predicted that any residual effects would be limited to equipment tracks/wheel ruts and that these effects will disappear naturally through tide and wave activity between one and four weeks post project. In order to verify the accuracy of these impact predictions, a post-disposal optical monitoring study was conducted following the winter 2022-23 dredging activities. A return to pre-use conditions occurred approximately seven weeks after the completion of dredging and disposal activities, confirming the impact predictions.\n\nResults of monitoring disposal at sea sites in Atlantic region in 2022-2023 (and previously unreported results from 2019-20 and 2021-22):\n\nBlack Point, NB 2019 Physical, Chemical and Biological Sediment Monitoring Study\n\nResults: The results of the 2019 study are consistent with previous findings based on samples collected from 1959 to 2002, indicating that there has been little biological change at the disposal site, particularly since 2001 when the surrounding area was thoroughly sampled.\n\nComments: Physical, chemical and biological monitoring will be repeated at 5-year intervals.\n\nBlack Point, NB 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 Hydrographic Surveys\n\nResults: Hydrographic data analysis indicates the site was stable between 2020-2021, 2022 and 2023.\n\nComments: The 2021+ Release Zone may continue to be used for disposal activities.\n\nShippagan Gully, NB 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 Hydrographic Surveys\n\nResults: The analysis of the 2021-2022 hydrographic surveys indicated that the study period was not sufficient to observe appreciable dispersion of the disposed material.\n\nComments: Analysis of the 2022-2023 results and comparison to previous surveys will be reported in the 2023-2024 CEPA report. This will allow for a longer study period.\n\nCharlottetown, Labrador 2021-2022 Optical Monitoring Study\n\nResults: Based on the analysis of the ROV footage, there are no visual signs of fish waste accumulation on the seafloor within or outside of the permitted disposal site.\n\nComments: Disposal activities are being conducted according to the DAS regulations and permit conditions. The disposal site is dispersive.\n\nSt. Lawrence, Newfoundland 2022-2023 Optical Monitoring Study\n\nResults: Based on the analysis of ROV footage, there are no visual signs of fish waste accumulation within or outside of the permitted disposal site.\n\nComments: Disposal activities are being conducted according to the DAS regulations and permit conditions. The disposal site is dispersive.\n\nPoint Sapin, NB 2022-2023 Optical Monitoring Study\n\nResults: A return to pre-use conditions occurred approximately seven weeks after the completion of dredging and disposal activities.\n\nComments: Given that Piping Plovers arrive on the breeding grounds from the end of March to early May and stay until early to mid-July, it is believed that the winter dredging and disposal activities are unlikely to have a significant impact on Piping Plovers at this site.\n\n2.5 Water quality monitoring in support to CMP surveillance sites\n\nFreshwater quality monitoring has been a core ECCC program since the Department’s inception in the early 1970s. The Department’s monitoring and surveillance activities are critical for assessing and reporting on water quality status and trends in addition to fulfilling federal domestic and international commitments and legislative obligations. Much of the Program’s monitoring is carried out through federal-provincial/territorial agreements, ensuring cost-effective and non-duplicative program delivery.\n\nECCC’s Freshwater Quality Monitoring program continues to implement a risk-based adaptive management framework in conjunction with statistical analyses to better target monitoring activities to the risks of contaminants and human activities in Canadian watersheds. The approach has been used to optimize monitoring locations and adjust monitoring frequencies relative to the environmental risks and to report on changes in environmental condition. The program continues to monitor chemicals of concern in water, sediments and aquatic biota at national sites across Canada in support of the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6. Freshwater quality monitoring programs sites in support of the CMP Environmental Monitoring and Surveillance in 2022-2023 (aquatic biota (fish), water, and sediment)\n\nLong description\n\nECCC’s Freshwater Quality Monitoring program continues to support performance measurement and evaluation of regulated chemicals by providing data and/or syntheses to determine the status and trends of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in the Canadian environment. The program also made contributions to the Toxic Chemicals assessment of the 2022 State of the Great Lakes Report for the water, sediment, and whole fish sub-indicators which evaluate the status and trends of several chemicals of concern.\n\nPlease see the Canada Water Act Annual Reports for updates on freshwater quality monitoring in Canada.\n\n2.6 Wildlife contaminant monitoring\n\nECCC has been monitoring contaminants in wildlife, primarily bird eggs, since the early 1970s. The data has been used to assess the health of wildlife, including in polluted regions such as the Great Lakes Areas of Concern, and to determine the success of mitigation measures and changes to regulation and management of chemicals in reducing levels of chemicals in wildlife. The prime monitoring species are colonial waterbirds, such as gulls, which are monitoring in all three coasts, in the prairies, the Arctic, Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River basin. Colonial waterbirds feed from the aquatic environment, and hence indicate trophic transfer of contaminants in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. Colonial waterbirds are monitored from both the Great Lakes Herring Monitoring Program (annual collections from 1974 onward), and the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) Environmental Monitoring and Surveillance Program from 2008 onward.\n\nEuropean starlings are also monitored throughout Canada on both the east and west coasts, in the prairies, the Arctic, Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River basin. Starlings represent the terrestrial element of the wildlife monitoring component and collection sites target rural, urban sites and landfills as possible sources of emissions to the environment. Starlings have been monitored annually as part of CMP Environmental Monitoring and Surveillance since 2009.\n\nData collected from the eggs of these birds are used to assess legacy compounds, such as PCBs, pesticides and mercury, but also current or recently used substances of mutual concern, such as PFAS, brominated flame retardants, and rare earth elements.\n\n3 Addressing key risks: risk assessment and risk management\n\nRisk assessments help to identify the sources of pollution that pose the greatest risk to the environment and human health. While risk assessment is the prelude to, and informs, the risk management stage for all programs under CEPA, the Act provides explicit direction on the assessment of toxic substances and the assessment of wastes and other matters that are destined for disposal at sea.\n\n3.1 Chemicals\n\nCEPA includes specific requirements for the assessment and management of substances in Canada. The Minister of Environment and Climate Change and the Minister of Health jointly administer this part of the Act.\n\nThere are two streams of risk assessment for substances in Canada:\n\nexisting substances: a substance that is being or has been used in Canada as a commercial substance or product, or released into the Canadian environment as a single substance, effluent, mixture, or contaminant\n\nnew substances: a substance (chemicals, polymers or living organisms) being introduced into the Canadian marketplace that are not on the Domestic Substances List\n\nProgress under the Chemicals Management Plan\n\nThe Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) is a program, jointly delivered by ECCC and HC, to assess and manage environmental and health risks posed by chemical substances that can be found in food and food products, consumer products, cosmetics, drugs, drinking water and industrial releases. Included is a commitment to address approximately 4300 existing substances of potential concern. The Government also conducts pre-market assessments of health and environmental effects of approximately 350 new substances to Canada each year.\n\nChemicals Management Plan Update\n\nSince the launch of the CMP in 2006, the Government of Canada has been managing potential risks to Canadians and the environment. As of March 31, 2023, the Government of Canada has:\n\naddressed 95% (4144) of the 4363 existing substances identified as priorities in 2006\n\nfound 353 existing substances to be harmful to the environment and/or human health, for a total of 602 when including toxic substances identified prior to 2006\n\nimplemented over 210 risk management actions for existing substances\n\nassessed approximately 6996 notifications for new substances prior to their introduction into the Canadian market\n\nimplemented 320 risk management actions for new substances\n\n3.1.1 Information gathering\n\nMandatory notices issued under CEPA are used to gather information needed to inform priority-setting, risk assessment and risk management activities, as well as decision making for chemical substances. In 2022-2023:\n\nECCC and HC continued to respond to inquiries and receive data from information gathering notices published in the Canada Gazette in late 2021-2022, specifically with respect to bisphenol A (BPA) and BPA structural analogues and certain substances on the Revised In Commerce List.\n\nECCC and HC also continued to hold discussions with stakeholders on the future direction of the information-gathering program, in particular balancing stakeholder concerns while ensuring program core data needs.\n\nIn July 2022, ECCC published an updated information-gathering plan.\n\nIn March 2023, ECCC published a non-confidential summary of bisphenol A (BPA) and BPA structural analogues information gathering initiative on their open data platform.\n\nIdentifying risk assessment priorities\n\nSince 2014, ECCC and HC have developed and implemented an approach to the identification of risk assessment priorities (IRAP) for chemicals under CEPA. As part of this approach, both departments compile new information on substances, evaluate this information, and then subsequently determine if further action on the substance(s) may be warranted.\n\nResults from past IRAP review cycles (2015, 2016, 2017-2018 and 2019) and from ECCC’s 2022 Science Approach Document for the Ecological Risk Classification of Organic Substances version 2.0 (ERC2) are available online and will continue to inform future risk assessment activities, including data gathering.\n\nThe program initiated a new IRAP review cycle in 2022, including collection of internal nominations from CMP program partners, and further scoping of substances identified in previous IRAP cycles. Results of these prioritization activities will feed into the development of a new risk assessment workplan that will be consulted on prior to implementation.\n\n3.1.2 Existing substances\n\n3.1.2.1 Risk assessment of existing substances\n\nECCC and HC conduct risk assessments or screening assessments to determine whether existing substances on the DSL meet or are capable of meeting any of the criteria for toxicity as set out in section 64 of the Act. Draft screening assessments are published for a 60-day public comment period, followed by the publication of the final screening assessments.\n\nDuring 2022-2023, the Ministers (see Table 6):\n\npublished 1 draft screening assessment and reports covering 5 substances\n\npublished 17 final screening assessment reports covering 69 substances\n\npublished an additional risk characterization document in support of the draft screening assessment for the Furans Compounds Group\n\nconcluded that 9 substances meet one or more of the toxicity criteria set out in section 64 of CEPA\n\n3.1.2.2 Risk management of existing substances\n\nRisk management instruments are put in place to reduce or eliminate risks to the environment and/or human health after a substance has been concluded toxic. Risk management instruments may take the form of regulations, pollution prevention plans, release guidelines or codes of practice, environmental performance agreements, and environmental quality guidelines. The risk management scope is published to outline the Government of Canada's early thinking on risk management. If the final screening assessment maintains the toxic conclusion, the risk management approach is published and outlines in more detail the Government of Canada's plan for risk management.\n\nRisk management scope and approach documents\n\nWhen a draft risk assessment proposes a conclusion that the substance is “toxic” under CEPA, meaning that the substance has met one or more of the criteria in section 64, a risk management scope document is developed and published at the same time as the draft assessment report.\n\nThere were no risk management scope documents published in 2022-2023 (see Table 6). However, on March 18, 2023, an Addendum to the Risk Management Scope for Furan Compounds - Furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofuran in outdoor air was published for a 60 day public comment period ending May 17, 2023.\n\nWhen the final screening assessment report concludes that a substance is “toxic” under CEPA, a risk management approach document is developed and published at the same time as the final risk assessment report.\n\nIn 2022-2023, 2 risk management approach documents were published for substances, or groups of substances, that met one or more of the toxicity criteria set out in section 64 of CEPA (see Table 6).\n\nFinal decision by the Ministers\n\nThe Ministers may recommend the addition of a substance to Schedule 1 of CEPA if a screening assessment concludes that a substance meets one or more of the toxicity criteria set out in section 64 of CEPA.\n\nNo final Orders were published in 2022-2023, therefore, no substances were added to Schedule 1.\n\nProposed regulations\n\nProposed regulations are published in the Canada Gazette, Part I and are linked to the CEPA Registry.\n\nOn May 14, 2022, the proposed Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2022 were published. The proposed Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2022 would repeal and replace the Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2012 and introduce restrictions on the manufacture, use, sale and import of DP and DBDPE, and products containing these substances. The proposed Regulations would also further restrict the manufacture, use, sale and import of PFOS, PFOA, LC-PFCAs, HBCD and PBDEs, and products containing these substances, which are already prohibited, with some exemptions, under the current Regulations.\n\nOn May 14, 2022, the proposed Order amending Schedule 3 to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (the Export Control List) was published in Part I of the Canada Gazette, for a 75-day public comment period. Notably, the proposed Order would add certain substances, including DBDPE, DP, HBCD, PFOA, LC-PFCAs, PBDEs and ferbam to the Export Control List making their exports subject to the Export of Substances on the Export Control List Regulations.\n\nOn December 24, 2022, the proposed Regulations Amending the Products Containing Mercury Regulations were published. The main objective of the proposed Amendments to the Products Containing Mercury Regulations (the proposed Amendments) is to protect people in Canada by lowering the risk of mercury releases into the environment from lamps in Canada. In addition, the proposed Amendments would ensure the Regulations meet the requirements under the Minamata Convention and in some cases, go beyond what is required in the Convention to further decrease mercury releases.\n\nFinal regulations\n\nFinal regulations are published in the Canada Gazette, Part II and are linked to the CEPA Registry.\n\nOn February 3, 2023, the Prohibition of the Manufacture and Importation of Wheel Weights Containing Lead Regulations were published. The Regulations aim to reduce human and environmental exposure to lead by prohibiting the manufacture and import of lead wheel weights destined for the Canadian market, which will help reduce the adverse health impacts resulting from lead exposure, and help improve air, water and soil quality.\n\nRegulatory administration\n\nThe Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations control the export, import, manufacture, sale and certain uses of ozone-depleting substances and hydrofluorocarbons, as well as certain products containing or designed to contain these substances.\n\nIn 2022-2023, approximately 135 permits were issued under these Regulations. Additionally, consumption allowances for hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) were issued to eligible companies and 30 requests for transfer of allowances were granted. The Department publishes the list of HFC and HCFC allowance holders as well as holders of essential purpose permits.\n\nThe Export of Substances on the Export Control List Regulations apply to the export of substances listed on Schedule 3 of CEPA (known as the Export Control List) and to the export of products containing these substances.\n\nIn 2022-2023, 63 notices of proposed export were submitted to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change. No export permits were requested.\n\nCodes of practice\n\nCodes of practice are voluntary instruments that recommend procedures and practices or environmental controls relating to works, undertakings, and activities. They aim to encourage the sustainable use of the environment and to reduce pollution. Codes of practice are not enforceable. They set out official national standards that companies and organizations should follow.\n\nOn February 4, 2023, the proposed Code of Practice for the Environmentally Sound Management of Chemical Substances in the Chemicals, Plastics and Rubber Sectors was published for chlorhexidine and its salts. The objective of this Code of Practice is to identify and promote best practices in the management and handling of chemical substances in the manufacturing and distribution of chemicals, plastics, and rubber products in order to prevent releases of these substances into the environment.\n\nOn February 4, 2023, a Notice regarding the proposed Code of Practice for the Environmentally Sound Management of Chemicals was published in Canada Gazette, Part I for a 60-day comment period. The purpose of the proposed Code is to provide guidance on best practices to manufacturers, formulators and distributors in the chemicals, plastics and rubber sectors in order to prevent releases of chemical substances to the environment.\n\nThe complete list with status updates for all active codes of practice is available online.\n\nEnvironmental performance agreements\n\nAn environmental performance agreement is a voluntary and non-statutory instrument that allows parties with common goals to address a particular environmental or human health issue, such as reducing the use or release of chemicals, promoting product stewardship or conserving sensitive habitats. These agreements may be used to complement a regulation, a code of practice or a pollution prevention planning notice under CEPA.\n\nOn November 21, 2022, the final Environmental Performance Agreement for the Formulation of Chlorhexidine Products was published. This 5-year environmental performance agreement aims to protect the aquatic environment by minimizing participating companies’ releases of chlorhexidine and its salts, from their facilities that formulate chlorhexidine-based products.\n\nOn January 18, 2023, the second progress report for the 2020 to 2025 Environmental Performance Agreement Respecting the Use of Tin Stabilizers in the Vinyl Industry was published. This progress report indicates that all participating facilities continue to meet the objective of the agreement.\n\nPollution prevention planning notices\n\nThe Minister may require the preparation and implementation of pollution prevention plans (P2 plans) for CEPA toxic substances (substances that have been added to Schedule 1 of CEPA). To invoke these requirements, the Minister publishes notices in the Canada Gazette, Part I, requiring persons to prepare and implement P2 plans for a substance or group of substances.\n\nThere were no P2 plans published in 2022-2023. The complete list with status updates for all active P2 notices is available online.\n\nEnvironmental quality guidelines\n\nEnvironmental quality guidelines provide benchmarks for the quality of the ambient environment. They may be developed nationally through the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) as Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines (CEQGs, found in Table 7) or federally under section 54 of CEPA as Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines (FEQGs, found on Table 8). In addition, an FEQG summary table is available online as of Feb 2021.\n\nOn August 20, 2022, a notice was published in in the Canada Gazette, Part I indicating the following FEQGs are now available:\n\naluminum to improve water quality\n\nselenium to reduce exposure to fish tissue, and bird egg\n\nsiloxane D4 to improve quality of water, sediment, and reduce exposure to in wildlife from the consumption of aquatic biota\n\nOther risk management actions on CEPA toxic substances\n\nProposed additions to the cosmetic ingredient hotlist\n\nOn November 17, 2022, a Notice to Stakeholders was published proposing to amend the Cosmetics Ingredients Hotlist to include new proposed addition of Benzophenone, Chlorocresol, and Triarylmethanes - Malachite Green under Prohibitions and an anthraquinone (Solvent Violet 13) under Restrictions, due to health concerns. Additionally, revisions to the Talc entry are proposed to help reduce exposures from certain cosmetics which may be inhaled, or which may result in perineal exposure to the population with intact ovary/ovaries.\n\nFinal additions to the cosmetic ingredient hotlist\n\nOn August 26, 2022, the Changes to the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist were published. Ethylhexyl Ethylhexanoate was added to the list of restricted substances due to health concern, as assessed by CMP.\n\nSubsequent regulations or instruments\n\nBill S-5, Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act received Royal Assent on June 13, 2023. As part of the public accountability framework, the Ministers must report annually to Parliament, as part of the CEPA annual report, on their progress in implementing the Plan of Chemicals Management Priorities. Where the Ministers propose to develop more than one risk management instrument in respect of a substance, the Ministers must report on progress made in developing subsequent regulations or instruments in the Annual Report, along with an update on estimated timelines and reasons for any delay. Because S-5 passed after the fiscal reporting year of 2022-2023, policy development is underway between HC and ECCC to track and report subsequent actions, as outlined in the modernized CEPA in the next CEPA Annual Report for 2023-2024.\n\nSignificant new activity requirements\n\nA Significant New Activity (SNAc) requirement may be applied when an existing substance has been assessed and no risks were identified with current activities but there is a suspicion that new activities may pose a risk to human health and/or the environment. When it is applied, new uses or activities must be reported to the government. This ensures that departmental experts can evaluate whether the new use of a substance poses a risk to human health or the environment and determine if risk management should be considered.\n\nIn 2022-2023, 5 SNAc Notices of Intent were issued covering 9 existing substances (see Table 9).\n\nIn 2022-2023, 2 SNAc Orders were issued for 4 existing substances (Table 10).\n\nRisk management performance measurement evaluation\n\nPerformance measurement evaluations provide individuals in Canada with information on the effectiveness of risk management actions for substances found to be toxic under CEPA. The risk management, human health and environmental objectives are systematically evaluated using robust data and expert analysis.\n\nIn 2022-2023, performance measurement evaluation reports were published for the substances nonylphenol and its ethoxylates (NP and NPEs), dioxins and furans (health component) and dichloromethane (DCM).\n\n3.1.3 New substances\n\n3.1.3.1 Risk assessment\n\nSubstances that are new to Canada require notification to the government prior to being imported into or manufactured in Canada. In 2022-2023:\n\n308 New Substances Notifications were assessed pursuant to section 81 of CEPA and the New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers)\n\n18 new substances risk assessment summaries were published online\n\n57 waivers of information requirements were published in the Canada Gazette for new chemical and polymer substances\n\n23 pre-notification consultations were held to help companies better understand the notification requirements for their specific chemical or polymer before submitting a New Substances Notification.\n\nSubstances in products regulated under the Food & Drugs Act (FDA) are subject to the new substances provisions in CEPA for examination of potential risks to the environment and indirect exposure to humans.\n\nOf the 308 New Substances Notifications that were assessed in 2022-2023, 61 were for new substances in products regulated under the FDA.\n\nWhen the assessment of a new substance identifies a risk to human health or the environment, CEPA allows the Minister of Environment and Climate Change to intervene prior to or during the earliest stages of its introduction into Canada. In this case, 3 actions may be taken. The Minister may:\n\npermit the manufacture or import of the substance subject to specified conditions\n\nprohibit the manufacture or import of the substance\n\nrequest additional information considered necessary for the purpose of assessment\n\nIn 2022-2023, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change issued 10 Notices of Ministerial Conditions for 10 new substances and varied 1 Notice of Ministerial Conditions that was previously published (see Table 11).\n\nA Significant New Activity (SNAc) requirement can be applied when a substance has been assessed and no risks were identified with current activities but there is a suspicion that significant new activities may pose a risk to human health and/or the environment.\n\nIn 2022-2023, 4 SNAc Notices were published (see Table 12)\n\n3.1.4 Communication activities\n\nCommunications and outreach activities provide individuals in Canada with timely and credible information about the CMP and its achievements, and how to protect themselves from the risks of chemical substances and pollutants.\n\nIn 2022-2023, ECCC and HC continued to raise awareness of the safe use and potential risks of chemical substances and pollutants. A variety of communications materials were developed and published on Canada.ca and on ECCC and HC social media channels to accompany the technical and scientific documents on chemical substances and pollutants. These outreach products include information sheets, fact sheets, plain-language summary pages, social media campaigns, and brochures/postcards made available for publication in community papers, blogs, and websites. These products provide supplemental and/or non-technical information about aspects of the program and about substances, for stakeholders and the public.\n\nThe following communications activities and products relating to the health and environmental risks of chemicals were published:\n\n2 new fact sheets as part of the Fact sheet series: Topics in risk assessment of substances under CEPA. The following communications activities and products relating to the health and environmental risks of chemicals were published on Canada.ca:\n\nuse of assessment factors in ecological risk assessment for deriving predicted no-effect concentrations\n\nconsideration of vulnerable populations in risk assessment\n\n1 information sheet webpage summary of a draft screening assessment\n\n17 information sheet webpage summaries of final screening assessments and/or risk management approach documents (where applicable)\n\n1 information sheet webpage update for an additional risk characterization document in support of a draft assessment and an addendum to a risk management scope document\n\n13 information sheet webpage updates for risk management activities and proposed or final orders listing substances to Schedule 1\n\n18 new substances notification assessment summaries\n\n110 social media posts were published on Health Canada’s Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and LinkedIn accounts (635 455 impressions), which promoted the campaign and drove traffic to Healthy Home related web pages\n\n297 706 page views of Healthy Home related web pages\n\nan advertising campaign saw 23.5 million impressions through search engine marketing (Google AdWords and Bing), Yahoo ads and more. Several environmental health topics were promoted, such as: asbestos, boric acid, flame retardants, and formaldehyde\n\npublished and printed four new publications:\n\nHealthy Home Guide,\n\nTips for renters\n\nTips for pregnancy and preparing for baby\n\nTips for do-it-yourself projects and renovations\n\ncompleted the second phase of the Healthy Home Challenge, an interactive online game designed to help inform the public about the potential health risks associated with certain chemicals and pollutants found in the home. The game will be completed and promoted next fiscal year.\n\nHealth Canada Regional offices continued to deliver Healthy Home sessions as virtual and in-person public outreach events. The objective of this educational tool is to raise awareness of potential health risks posed by chemicals and pollutants in and around the home and provide tangible actions to protect health. This enables direct delivery of CMP and environmental health information to people in Canada, with a focus on reaching intermediaries such as nurses, community health officers, early childhood educators, health care providers, and parents. These intermediaries further disseminate messaging through their professional networks and reach populations that may be disproportionately impacted, such as Indigenous communities, newcomers, seniors, pregnant women and people, children, and youth.\n\nHealth Canada’s Risk Communications and Public Involvement officers continued working with staff across Environmental Health Programs to generate cross promotion of related and relevant environmental health messaging, including reading product labels, safe home renovations, radon testing, mould removal, reducing chemical exposures, and maintaining indoor air quality. In 2022-2023:\n\n102 in person and virtual outreach activities were delivered across the country, including Healthy Home sessions, and exhibits at trade shows, science fairs, and conferences. This included 10 Train-the-Trainer collaborations.\n\nsurveys show that 98% of Health Canada outreach session participants had increased knowledge and that 96% plan to apply what they learned\n\nHealthy Home Sessions and other public outreach activities helped to reach people living in Canada, such as: Bringing an Awareness of Senior Safety Issues to the Community (BASSIC) working group developed and distributed 41K calendars to seniors in Ontario\n\na postcard on poison prevention was distributed to 117K homes in the Atlantic region, Manitoba and Saskatchewan\n\nHealthy Home booth displays upgraded to better integrate Health Canada environmental health programs to meet accessibility, health and safety, engagement and sustainability goals\n\ncontract with EcoSchools Canada to distribute action cards “Environmental Health” and “Let’s Talk Air” on their environmental certification platform, reaching 77,637 K-12 students across Canada. In addition, Action cards were distributed to over 12K students\n\n3.2 Animate products of biotechnology\n\nLiving organisms, defined in CEPA as animate products of biotechnology (CEPA section 104), are regulated for health and safety purposes by a variety of federal departments and agencies across the government. CEPA sets the federal standard for assessment and risk management of new and existing living organisms that are animate products of biotechnology. Other Canadian acts meeting the federal standard set by CEPA are listed in Schedule 4 of the Act. Living organisms manufactured or imported for a use not covered by an act listed on Schedule 4 are regulated under CEPA. These include naturally occurring and genetically modified organisms (such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and higher organisms, such as fish or pigs) used for various environmental, industrial, and commercial purposes.\n\n3.2.1 Risk assessment of living organisms\n\nThe Act requires that all 68 living organisms grandfathered to the DSL (that is, those in commerce between 1984 and 1986) undergo a screening assessment to determine whether the living organism is toxic or capable of becoming toxic. ECCC and HC have completed joint assessments for 45 of those living organisms to date. The remaining 23 living organisms have since been or will be removed from the DSL. In addition, ECCC and HC jointly perform the assessment of living organisms that are new to the Canadian marketplace and require notification to the government prior to being imported into or manufactured in Canada.\n\nRisk assessment of existing living organisms\n\nOn November 23, 2022, a Ministerial Order deleting one masked living organism from the DSL was published in the Canada Gazette, Part II, as this living organism does not meet the criteria set out in subsection 105(1) of the Act (see Table 13).\n\nRisk assessment of new living organisms\n\nDuring 2022-2023, 43 notifications for new animate products of biotechnology were assessed under the New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms). Of these, 18 were for new substances in products regulated under the Food and Drugs Act.\n\nAlso, during 2022-2023:\n\n13 pre-notification consultations were completed to help companies better understand the notification requirements for their specific living organism before submitting a New Substances Notification\n\n74 waivers of information requirements for new living organisms were granted and published in the Canada Gazette, Part I\n\nRisk assessment of new higher organisms\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada and Health Canada are promoting more public engagement in the risk assessment of higher organisms (such as genetically modified plants and animals) conducted by the New Substances (NS) program.\n\nThe voluntary engagement initiative was launched in 2018. The NS program publishes summaries of New Substances Notifications submitted for higher organism and invites stakeholders to share scientific information and test data related to potential risks to the environment or human health from the new living organisms. Information that could be shared to inform the risk assessment process includes:\n\nenvironmental fate information\n\necological effects information\n\nhuman health effects information or\n\nexposure information (including sources and routes of exposure)\n\nA public comment period was completed on four new genetically modified aquarium fish and another on a new genetically modified fruit fly to inform risk assessments. Further information on past engagement initiatives may be found online.\n\n3.2.2 Risk management\n\nRisk management instruments are put in place to reduce or eliminate risks to the environment and/or human health after a living organism has been concluded toxic.\n\nIn 2022-2023, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change did not issue any Ministerial Conditions or SNAc Notices for new living organisms.\n\nIn 2022-2023, 1 SNAc Order was issued for two existing living organisms (see Table 14).\n\n3.3 Air pollutants and greenhouse gases\n\nAir pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs) originate from numerous domestic and international sources, such as industry and transportation. CEPA provides authorities to develop and administer regulatory and non-regulatory risk management instruments to reduce the releases of air pollutants and GHGs.\n\n3.3.1 Risk assessment\n\nHealth and environmental risk assessments of air pollutants underpin air quality risk management decisions made by federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal governments. Comprehensive risk assessments are completed in support of decisions to establish or update Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) and sector-based assessments are conducted to inform management and regulation of air pollution sources. In addition to CAAQS for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ground level ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), HC is developing health-based air quality objectives (HBAQOs) as there are other pollutants in outdoor air that that may not be as ubiquitous in the environment, but nonetheless can be harmful to human health. HC is initiating development of an HBAQO for arsenic, others to follow will include benzene; formaldehyde; carbon monoxide; and PM10, that is, particles with a diameter of 10 microns and smaller.\n\nIn December 2022, HC published the assessment document Health Benefits per Tonne of Air Pollutant Emissions Reduction: Region-, Sector- and Pollutant-specific Estimates for Two Canadian Regions. The report provides a way to calculate the dollar value of health benefits associated with a one tonne reduction in air pollutant emissions in the regions of southwestern British Columbia and the Windsor- Quebec City corridor. These calculations can support local/regional decision makers in the evaluation of air pollution or GHG mitigation strategies.\n\nIn February 2023, HC published Health Impacts of Air Pollution from Transportation, Industry and Residential Sources in Canada: Estimates of Premature Mortality and Morbidity Outcomes at National, Provincial, Territorial and Air Zone Levels. This assessment provides a comparative analysis of the health impacts associated with PM2.5, NO2 and ground level ozone air pollution attributable to 20 individual anthropogenic sectors/subsectors for the year 2015. The top three sectors contributing to air pollution health impacts in 2015 were home firewood burning, on-road transportation, and ore and mineral industry.\n\nIn March 2023, HC published the report Benzene releases from gasoline stations - Implications for human health. This assessment evaluates the potential magnitude of benzene vapour emissions from gasoline stations and the associated health risks.\n\n3.3.2 Risk management\n\nDifferent regulatory and non-regulatory instruments are available under the authorities provided by CEPA to limit and reduce emissions of air pollutants and/or greenhouse gases from vehicles, engines and fuels, consumer and commercial products, landfills, and industrial sectors, as well as for establishing national ambient air quality objectives to drive air quality improvements.\n\nCooperation among governments is key in managing air pollution. The Air Quality Management System (AQMS), agreed to by federal, provincial and territorial environment ministers in 2012, provides a collaborative approach to reducing air pollution and improving the health of Canadians and the environment. The AQMS includes:\n\nCanadian Ambient Air Quality Standards\n\nlocal air zones and regional airsheds that cross jurisdictional borders\n\nindustrial emission requirements for several industrial sectors and equipment types\n\nwork to address emissions from mobile sources\n\nreporting on the state of the air to people in Canada\n\nThe AQMS system is supported by significant monitoring of outdoor air pollutants, through the National Air Pollution Surveillance program undertaken in cooperation with provinces and territories. Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) are health and environment-based air quality objectives that apply to the concentration of specific air pollutants in the outdoor air. They provide the drivers for local air quality management actions that are meant to promote continuous improvement in air quality across the country. ECCC in collaboration with HC lead the process under the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) to develop, review and update CAAQS. Once approved by the federal, provincial and territorial ministers of the environment, CAAQS are published by the Ministers of the Environment and the Minister of Health as objectives under CEPA. CAAQS for 2020 and 2025 are in place for ground level ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). CAAQS for PM2.5, are in place for 2020. The process to finalize the review and potential update of the 2020 CAAQS for PM2.5 to more stringent standards is ongoing.\n\nIndustrial sector emissions\n\nThe Multi-Sector Air Pollutants Regulations (MSAPR) which came into force in 2016, put in place industrial emissions requirements agreed under the AQMS for equipment types used in several industrial sectors and for the cement sector. The regulations established nationally consistent industrial emissions performance standards that limit nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from large industrial boilers and heaters and stationary spark ignition engines, used in several industrial sectors, that burn gaseous fuels (such as natural gas).\n\nFor stationary spark-ignition engines covered by the MSAPR, emission requirements for modern engines are in force, with annual compliance reports due each July 1. Emission requirements for certain engines began to apply in 2021, and the first annual compliance reports were submitted on July 1, 2022.\n\nThe MSAPR also limit NOx and SO2 emissions from kilns at 14 cement manufacturing facilities in Canada. As of the end of 2022, 13 of the 14 facilities are meeting the SO2 limit and 12 of the 14 facilities are meeting the NOx emission limits as defined in the MSAPR. The facility not meeting the SOx emissions limit has re-commissioned their SO2 scrubber and is on track to meet the SOx limit for 2023 as set out in the regulation. The two facilities not meeting the NOx emissions limits have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, a selective non-catalytic reduction system to reduce their NOx emissions and meet the NOx limit as set out in the regulation.\n\nSeveral non-regulatory instruments to reduce air pollutants from other industrial sectors have been put in place under CEPA and continued to be administered by the Department in 2022-2023:\n\nAluminium sector\n\ncode of practice for PM2.5\n\nperformance agreements for SO2, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PM2.5, and total particulate matter (TPM)\n\nBase metals smelting sector\n\nfive company-specific performance agreements for SO2, TPM\n\nIron ore pellet sector\n\nperformance agreements for NOx, SO2, PM2.5\n\nIron, steel and ilmenite sectors\n\ncode of practice for TPM and VOCs\n\npollution prevention notice for SO2, NOx, VOCs\n\nNew natural gas-fueled stationary combustion turbines\n\nguidelines for NOx\n\nPotash sector\n\ncode of practice for PM2.5\n\nPulp and paper sector\n\ncode of practice for SO2, TPM\n\nOil and gas sector emissions\n\nThe first requirements under the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector), came into force on January 1, 2020, in order to help fulfill Canada’s commitment to reduce emissions of methane from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45% below 2012 levels, by 2025. The remaining requirements related to venting from well completions involving hydraulic fracturing and venting from compressors came into force on January 1, 2023.\n\nIn 2021, Canada committed to achieving at least a 75% reduction in methane emissions from its oil and gas sector from 2012 levels by 2030. Also in 2021, Canada joined over 100 countries in signing the Global Methane Pledge, committing to reduce global anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Canada was subsequently pleased to accept an invitation to be a Global Methane Pledge Champion. In March 2022, ECCC launched public consultations with Indigenous organizations, industry, research organizations and civil society through a discussion paper to inform the development of more stringent regulations to achieve further methane emission reductions in the oil and gas sector. Following the public comment period from March 25, 2022 to May 25, 2022, ECCC reviewed comments received leading to the development and publication of a proposed regulatory framework in Faster and Further: Canada’s Methane Strategy, published in September 2022. ECCC plans to publish proposed regulations by the end of 2023. In November 2022, at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 27), Canada announced increased cooperation with the United States on reducing oil and gas sector emissions—with a special focus on methane. Canada also joined the International Methane Emissions Observatory contributing $250,000 to the initiative and agreeing to serve on its Implementation Committee. The observatory works to reconcile methane data in near real-time from measurement studies, satellites and reported data, in order to help countries and companies take fast mitigation action on methane.\n\nIn July 2022, following more than six months of preliminary meetings with key interested parties, ECCC, in collaboration with NRCan, released a discussion paper that launched formal consultations on a key commitment in the Government’s 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan—capping and cutting emissions from the oil and gas sector. During the formal comment period, the Government of Canada received over 25,000 written submissions in response to the discussion paper and held a number of information webinars and bilateral meetings with interested parties. Engagement with provinces, territories, Indigenous Peoples, industry, non-governmental organizations, and other Canadians on the oil and gas sector emissions cap is ongoing.\n\nElectricity generation\n\nECCC currently administers 2 regulations pertaining to electricity generation under CEPA:\n\nThe Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations, were amended in 2018 for the purpose of meeting the Government’s commitment to phase out the unabated generation of electricity using coal, coal derivatives and petroleum coke by January 1, 2030.\n\nThe Regulations Limiting Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Natural Gas-fired Generation of Electricity, which came into force starting January 1, 2019, set performance-based standards for new natural gas units as well as conditions for the operation of coal units converted to run on natural gas. Under these regulations, new natural gas-fired electricity generation is required to use efficient technology and higher emitting coal-to-gas converted units will be phased out more rapidly than better performers.\n\nIn 2020, Canada committed to achieving a net-zero electricity system by 2035 as a key part of its plan to achieve a net-zero econ"
