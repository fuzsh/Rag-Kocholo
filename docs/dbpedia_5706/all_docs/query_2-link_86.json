        "text": "Julianna Balsamo joined the CTV Barrie team as a Journalist in 2024.\n\nShe was born and raised in Simcoe County and discovered her passion for television at a very young age.\n\nWhen she was 10 years old, Julianna started filming and sharing videos on her YouTube channel, which she made for an imaginary audience. This childhood interest inspired her to pursue a degree in Radio and Television, where she received her Bachelorâ€™s degree in Media Production at Toronto Metropolitan University.\n\nThroughout Julianna's career, she made it her goal to explore all facets of the media industry.\n\nShe found a love for marketing and social media and received her Social Marketing Certification in 2021.\n\nJulianna concluded her studies by working on a Toronto-produced interactive television series, Get Together, where she led her team in all social, digital, and marketing campaigns.\n\nHer film later won an award for Best Social Media Design at the 45th Annual Tara Awards.\n\nAs a Journalist, Julianna enjoys learning more about her community and sharing feel-good stories.\n\nShe speaks English."
