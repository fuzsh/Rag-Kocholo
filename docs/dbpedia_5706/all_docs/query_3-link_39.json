        "text": "So....Matt (Melas), Alex (Occidentalis) and I are attending the prestigious Pet n' Reptile show in cosmopolitan Reading Pennsyltucky for about 5 hours.\n\nI know, I know....how did we only spend a mere 5 hours at a reptile show you are undoubtably asking? Well, after seeing the 25 lb flemmish welsh meat / fluff / pet rabbit (worlds largest feeder rabbit to us), Matt was frustrated that he couldn't take it home to his albino burm, so we left.\n\nHere's where it gets weird, hard to believe, an' all X files and stuff....\n\nWe all arrive at my house and retire to the basement frog room. Alex came all the way from Michigan to view my collection and I did not wish to disapoint! As we are sitting on the couch and I am begining the \"tour\" with my laser pointer - extolling the virtues of a modifiyed ultrasonic humidifyer and a double layered Brom canopy, my attention fell upon my Cauchero vivarium, containing my excellently producing group of 1.2 frogs and 2 froglets. As SOON as I said \"and this is one of the viv's that I am most proud of\" or something similarly humble, I noticed that the front half of the glass hinge lid was WIDE OPEN ! I quickly deduced that it had to have been left open since 9 am or just before Matt and I left for the show.\n\nThe 3 adult pumilio and 2 froglets had a half open top for over 7 hours!\n\nLater that night, after staying up till midnight with my princeton headlamp on, making sure that every inch of leaf, branch, brom and panamanian ficus was checked, I found EVERY SINGLE FROG inside the viv.\n\nThe end.\n\nWait....Is there more? A moral perhaps? A joke (you know me by now) ? Something more????\n\nI'll leave you with this, for you to judge. All the Pumilio were F1 to F2 frogs (Captive born, second generation). I've had at least 6 Wild Caught Pumilio either find cracks or otherwise quickly sneak out of an enclosure if I even turned my back for a second, it seemed. Were the frogs so well suited to captive conditions that they had no inclination to search for escape? The one female was found near the brom in the top left corner where she always hangs out - INCHES away from the OPEN top when we discovered it. One tiny jump would have been all it took for her to go over the edge and yet she stayed inside the viv.\n\nMy horrible mistake......OUR collective learning experience. Submitted for your perusal. Make of it what you will....\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dartden/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DartDen\n\n\"Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana\".\n\nThis story is familiar.\n\nRushed off to work after feeding the frogs. Came home from work 10 hours later. Went into the frog room to stare at the frogs and found the pumilio tank lid open about half an inch (this was back when I only had my female).\n\nPanic!\n\nShe wasn't sitting in her favorite brom . Did not find her under her favorite log eating springtails. Did not see her inside her favorite hidey hole where she would go to get away from me.\n\nI tore my frog room apart. It was, at one time, the master bedroom and still has bedroom furniture in it. I was crawling around on the floor with a flashlight, searching every nook and cranny. Even shined the light down the air vents. I was up until 3 am looking for that frog, before I finally went to bed, sobbing.\n\nNext morning, I got up and went to check on the frogs, intentionally ignoring her tank. I couldn't bear to see it there, empty. Something orange caught my eye. There she was, in her tank, happily eating breakfast as if nothing happened.\n\nOn the one hand, I was so relieved! On the other, I wanted to kill her! :mrgreen:\n\nBut, yea, she had 10 hours to leave her tank. And then she had many hours to watch me crawling around, acting the fool.\n\nOh, she is F1\n\nDo you know where your frogs have been?\n\nBack in the day, when the first escudos came in ca. 2006, I traded Marcus a proven 2.3 orange terriblis and a prov 2.3 proven yellow terriblis for (3), 1.1 escudo. I loved my terriblis, but I was moving to CT and it was going to be a lot to take care of my frogs long distance so I made the switch to oophaga. I Qt'd the escudos in 10 gallons. I put a brom in each cause I had the extras, and surely they would make the pums more comfortable. Well, didn't they start tending tads right away, I couldn't have been more excited. The next time I returned from NE, I couldn't find two of the males....until I looked harder..........they were jerky on the floor. I was devastated. I was soooooo disgusted with myself. How could I have missed the gap at the corner of their 10 gallon tanks!?!? Over the years I have found that these types of events shouldn't be commonplace, but occasionally bad things will happen. Now, when I leave my frogroom, I often check 2-3 times, leave the room, and check once again. It might be paranoid, but I've only had one escapee since...\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I was misting frogs and it went without incident until I got to my 18x18x24 Exo-Terra that housed a breeding group of vents. Knowing that thumbs can be lightning quick, slippery, little devil frogs I checked the front glass to make sure no frog was hanging out plotting an escape. No one was sitting there, good news! I opened the tank and pointed the\n\nnozzle of the hand pump mister into the tank. I depressed the handle and approximately 3 drops of water hit the viv before I saw a flash of black and gold leap out of the tank and onto the tile floor. That little devil frog had been sitting amongst the leaf litter at the very front of the tank just waiting for some fool (me) to open the door and make his escape. I clumsily made an effort to snatch him with one hand as I still had the mister in the other hand. But he just winked at me and crawled through the tiniest gap between the bottom of the rack and the tile floor. Underneath the big 2x4 rack...full of tanks. Yes this rack.\n\n[ATTACHMENT NOT FOUND]\n\nNo way in hell I could move all those vivs and rack by myself to try and get that frog. I freaked out. My heart was in my throat. I was actually panicking thinking about that poor little frog drying up in minutes. I did do one thing right, I called another frogger. I called my buddy JBear (Justin). At least being away from the situation allowed him to think clearly. He suggested getting something thin to put underneath the rack and try to \"shoo\" the frog out. A-ha! I had just the thing!! I ran to the garage and got a 16\" zip tie. It was thin enough to fit in the tiny little gap underneath the rack of vivs. After just a couple of side to side sweeping motions that little vent hopped right out from underneath the rack. I quickly nabbed him, gave him a quick little spray of water, an popped him right back into his home, at which time I proceeded to unleash a stream of obscenities at him for giving me a coronary at such a young age.\n\nThat's my escape story.\n\nP.S.\n\nAnyone interested in some vent froglets? I've got some available, real cheap too!\n\nJon"
