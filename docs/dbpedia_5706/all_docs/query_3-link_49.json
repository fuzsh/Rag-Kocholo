        "text": "No direct/indirect sales or solicitations by commercial enterprises are allowed in University Housing residential communities (halls and apartments). Groups who wish to advertise their products to students may utilize:\n\nFederal mail service with appropriate postage\n\nHall public posting areas\n\nPhone solicitations\n\nCampus newspapers\n\nDoor-to-door solicitation, distribution, and advertising by non-Housing & Dining Services (HDS) staff is prohibited. HDS will not release phone numbers and addresses for residents.\n\nAdvertising Reservations\n\nPosting/Advertising/Community Display Area\n\nEach residence hall and apartment has a designated public posting area where advertising materials may be displayed. Front desk staff can confirm these individual locations. Bring your own push pins/staplers to post materials.\n\nAdvertising should avoid the use of obscene language and may not promote illegal behavior, including the underage use of alcohol or illegal drugs. Advertisements that do not follow these guidelines or are posted in areas not designated by University Housing staff will be removed. Advertisements may be posted for up to two weeks.\n\nFor poster distribution, only recognized University student organizations and departments/offices are permitted to have posters distributed throughout Housing & Dining Services (not to individual residents). Posters must be approved by Housing & Dining Services and can be done by emailing housing@colostate.edu. If approved, posters must be dropped off at the Palmer Center for distribution.\n\nNewspaper\n\nSubscription Newspapers:\n\nFront desk staff maintain an updated list of newspaper subscribers and are responsible for proper distribution to residents. Shortages and other inquiries must be handled directly between the subscriber and newspaper.\n\nNewspapers/Publications:\n\nWooden newspaper stands/bins are located in the lobbies and are available on a first-come, first-served basis (not assigned or reserved). Publications must fit in stands/bins, and outdated newspapers/publications must be removed in a timely manner.\n\nUse of Residence Hall Rooms\n\nAs stated in the Residence Hall Contract, the residence halls and adjacent grounds are for the use of student residents only. Residence hall rooms may not be used for commercial or business purposes.\n\nUse of Student Mailboxes\n\nThe use of residence hall student mailboxes is limited to federal mail, campus mail, and information regarding residence hall concerns, programs, and events. Recognized student organizations not directly affiliated with the residence halls may distribute fliers or other advertisements through student mailboxes if the items are individually addressed to the occupants of the room with correct student names and room numbers.\n\nOff-campus businesses and individuals may not mass distribute fliers or other advertisements through student mailboxes unless the items are delivered through the U.S. Post Office, and labeled to individual students.\n\nFood Distribution\n\nAny group wishing to distribute food samples MUST be invited on campus by hall staff and contact Environmental Health Services at (970) 491-6121 to complete necessary paperwork at least two weeks in advance.\n\nChalking\n\nChalking in front of the residence halls by student organizations and groups unaffiliated with CSU is not allowed. Residence hall staff may use chalking to promote residence hall events with approval from the hall’s residence director.\n\nOutdoor Recruitment\n\nGroups and their representatives can engage in activities on sidewalks of the major streets that surround the residence halls. This activity must allow for the smooth flow of traffic along the sidewalk. Allowable areas include the sidewalks along Shields, Laurel, North/Plum, Loomis/Meridian, University, South, Pitkin, Lake, and Prospect. Groups are not allowed conduct activities in areas closer to the residence halls, such as internal courtyards, etc.\n\nDonations/Collections\n\nStudent organizations collecting items on behalf of outside organizations for a service opportunity must get permission prior to setting up a collection site. For more information, contact the University Housing’s Coordinator for Student Engagement at (970) 491-4719 or housing@colostate.edu.\n\nInformation Tables in the Residence Halls\n\nRecognized University student organizations and departments/offices are permitted to set up informational tables in the residence halls. Tables must be informational and not used to recruit or solicit to students.\n\nResidence directors will work with hall staff and University Housing management to select appropriate locations for table placement. Tables must be in visible public spaces within halls and may not interfere with/impede resident traffic, staff duties, or dining operations. Due to the high volume of traffic during meal times, setting up outside dining centers is recommended.\n\nTables can be set up between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily, beginning the second week of classes through the next-to-last week of classes each semester. Reservations are made on a first-come, first-served basis. No more than one group may be at a location at one time.\n\nThe following guidelines must be followed in order to set up tables in the residence halls:\n\nA permit must be secured in person at the University Housing front desk in the Palmer Center at least 48 hours in advance of table setup.\n\nPermits are limited to one day per month, and only one date may be reserved at a time. A new reservation may be made once the existing reservation has past.\n\nUpon arrival, a signed permit must be shown at the hall front desk prior to setup. For tables near a dining center entrance, a permit must also be shown to the dining center manager.\n\nContact the hall front desk to confirm if there is an existing table for use, or if you need to bring your own. Residential Dining Services can lend one six­foot-long table and up to three chairs with three­days notice (in applicable halls). Tablecloths and skirting are not provided.\n\nHandouts/communications must align with Housing & Dining Services posting policies in appropriateness of material.\n\nGroups may not ask students to stop and speak with them, complete surveys, accept print-outs/giveaways, etc. Information may be relayed/distributed only if a student approaches the table on their own.\n\nRaffles, drawings, etc., are not permitted.\n\nGroups are responsible for returning the space to its original condition.\n\nTable reservations may be canceled at any time if any policies are violated."
