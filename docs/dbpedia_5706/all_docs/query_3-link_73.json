        "text": "If it is 18 inches up, could you not consider burying it in the garden to make it lower? Once your froglets have 4 legs they will be off never to return, its a sad fact, that is why there are so many as most will not survive. Adult frogs are often looking for a place to live, but believe it or not they don't live in water most of the time, as tigertim suggested somewhere for them to hide such as branches, upturned bricks is where they live/hibernate, yes they do go in water but they don't live there 24/7 and if they can not see the water (18 inches up) they will carry on with their travels and go somewhere easier. (Wouldn't you?)\n\nIf you can't lower the pond, how about raising the (or one) surrounding side? (Not just a ramp it must be somewhere to live, hide etc)\n\nThanks for the responses.\n\nIâ€™ve got wildflowers and hostas plus geraniums and a few other bits which I have no idea what theyâ€™re called which seem to provide a lot of cover. Iâ€™ll add some logs and other bits deep into the beds to provide more cover. Also have a lot of pots with small gaps under them which Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll use.\n\nAs for the pond itâ€™s raised and on decking. It was never my intention to put tadpoles in it but the neighbour launched a load in as to save them getting eaten by his fish. Maybe Iâ€™ll try and squeeze in a small sunken pond just so they have somewhere to retreat to if they need it. To be fair I think most of them will end up hidden under the decking gorging on all the bugs down there.\n\nCheers\n\nMight be stating the obvious but make sure you have something they can climb up to get out of the raised pond when/if the water level drops below the rim (a ladder as such) They naturally spend a good amount of time on land, in fact many species will spend most of their time on land when not breeding so whilst they may pop in and out, you are most likely to see them in water during springtime breeding periods.\n\nAlso something just below water line that they can perch on is a plus (rocks, plants etc) Iâ€™ve just done a little re-vamp of my mini wildlife pond. Iâ€™ve got a large pond too, but this one is more of a glorified puddle in my woodland area, maybe 8 - 10 inches deep at its deepest point and half of that depth is full of leaves and general detritus. I spent the afternoon, however, being watched by two little frogs, sat amongst plants with just their heads poked up through the duckweed! ðŸ˜‚\n\nIâ€™ve sunk a very large deep bucket at one end (so they now have a plunge pool) and the extra depth will add some variety of conditions for other wildlife critters!\n\nAlso, tall reeds or stems are great for dragonfly or damselfly larvae to climb out onto in order to do their final moult before flying off to mate. Seeing the perfectly formed moults that they leave behind is pretty cool too.\n\nIf you have space and it works for you, a good patch of nettles somewhere is a good plus for wildlife (not always popular) and as a general rule for flowers, open flowers with good access to pollen rather than fancy doubles with lots of petals in the way, a variety of different flower shapes such as some open face, some bells (like foxgloves) and some plants with lots of small flowers is good, as this will cater to a larger variety of pollinators with different preferences. Also try to extend your season for as long as you can. Early and late flowers can be crucial for those times when there is not so much available. Heathers can be great for this as many will flower through the colder seasons.\n\nI personally get as much joy from seeing all the critters in my garden as I do seeing the flowers. I hope you do too. ðŸ˜Š\n\nBit off topic but any recommendations for long flowering perennials which will attract bees? Already got salvias, lavender, cosmos, bellflower, geums and some other bits I canâ€™t remember the name of. Also got mentha and a few other bits in the patio pond for pollinators.\n\nCheers\n\nIf you want long flowering and impact then one of the sterile hardy geraniums will work. The most common is \"Rozanne\" which is a great plant if you have some sprawling space but \"Anne Thompson\" is better behaved and \"Ann Folkard\" somewhere in between.\n\nErysimum bowles mauve is a perennial wallflower that keeps going most of the year but the best flowering plants in my garden the last few years have been Knautia macedonica and on one plant it was in flower everyday through last year's winter.\n\nThe best bee and insect plants I have in the garden don't flower for that long but when they do they are abuzz with life so do consider other things as well if you have space. For me eryngiums and echinops are two of the ones I wouldn't be without and monarda is similarly inticing to bugs.\n\nHi all,\n\nBit off topic but any recommendations for long flowering perennials which will attract bees?\n\nIf you want long flowering and impact then one of the sterile hardy geraniums will work.

I also really like Marjoram (Origanum sp.) and <\"Origanum laevigatum\"> is a great long flowering one.\n\nFrom the useful <\"Improving lawns....\"> thread.\n\nThis is cheating a bit (because it is at work), but it is a Rambler Rose (<\"Madame Gregoire Staechelin\">) and I grew it from a hard wood cutting and \"Guerilla\" planted it.\n\ncheers Darrel\n\nUnless that's a very big plate, I think those are an earlier hedgehog litter which is a good sign for the future. We get big mama hogs producing a couple of litters a year and sometimes so late the that babies aren't big enough to overwinter. One year we had 27 I think that we helped to get through till spring (our friend took them in from around the neighbourhood but then became ill so we took over with lots of guidance).\n\nIt's amazing how uplifting these little encounters can be.\n\nItâ€™s actually a small plate, probably half the size of a dinner plate. I was thinking they were little ones but Iâ€™ve seen so few live hedgehogs in my life I canâ€™t really remember the size of an adult. We had a youngster visit one night last year too so theyâ€™re breeding nearby somewhere which is good. Itâ€™s a pretty built up area so to see them is great, theyâ€™re cute little things with no fear.\n\nCheers"
