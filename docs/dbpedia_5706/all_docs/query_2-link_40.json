        "text": "JANEY CANUCK IN\n\nTHE WEST\n\nI\n\nWESTWARD HO!\n\nTHOUGHT I was a Christian,\" said Gail Hamilton, \"but we've been moving.\"\n\nIt seems that ever since Mother Eve got notice to leave, moving has meant a domestic cyclone. This is what I said to the family, as I surveyed our household penates done up in \"big box, little box, bandbox, bundle,\" to say nothing of crates, barrels, bales and baskets; but the family were too busy to pay any attention to me. They fail to appreciate the appalling fact that I shall have to locate all my books on new shelves. When, anon, I go to the fourth shelf, fifth book from the north side, to get \"The Scarlet Letter\", it will be to find \"Pearson on the Creed\" or Jevons's \"Logic\" in that identical spot. It means a moving of all my mental images–a changing of my geography, so to say. What a lot of knowledge runs to waste in the world!\n\nIn no way is your weakness of character so revealed to you as in moving. Upstairs and downstairs, and in my lady's chamber, you find heaps of stuff that ought to be burned, but you have not sufficient stamina to apply the match. You dilly-dally, vacillate, and halt between two opinions.\n\n\"Things are expensive in the West,\" you argue mentally. \"They have not been kept the proverbial seven years.\" And so, because of the vague possibilities of vaguer needs in a problematic future, you cumber and incommode the present.\n\nTo move means a review of your whole life. Inside one little hour, you laugh, swell with pride, cry, grovel with humility and burn with indignation as the fingers of still-born projects, dead joys, or foolish frolics reach out and touch you from the past.\n\nThere are compensations, though. Things get cleaned up. You lose fifteen pounds of absolutely useless flesh. There is the secret and blissful consciousness of removing mountains and making things happen.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt is a big flit we are taking. The moisture in my eyes is purely the result of smoke from the engines.\n\nBlessed old Toronto, the home of our love! You have been good to us. I cannot forbear kissing my hands to your charm and beauty. To live with you is to \"be happy ever after.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nAt five p.m. we found ourselves–the Padre, our two girls and myself–on board the Athabasca. She is a great white swan without a neck. They tell us she is \"well-found,\" and \"handy\" in a storm. I don't know though. I never have time to look at anything but the engines–and, incidentally, the dining-table, when I am aboard ship. The pistons, wheels, belts, and shafts that strain and sweat and growl under the driving steam are an endless mystery to me. The greedy, glittering jaws and ponderous limbs of the weird monster hold me in an awesome but delightful spell.\n\nThe Padre says I show a \"residual taint of the original state,\" whatever he means by that. I do not answer him, for all the while I am singing the song o' steam:\n\n\"The tail-rods mark the time.\n\nThe crank-throws give the double bass, the feed-pump sobs an' heaves,\n\nAn' now the main eccentrics start and quarrel with the sheaves;\n\nHer time, her own appointed time, the rocking link-head bides,\n\nTill–hear that note–the red return whings glimmerin' through the guides.\n\nThey're all awa'! True beat, full power, the clangin' chorus goes.\"\n\nAs the sea-gulls swirled around our ship to-day in looping flight, I heard a little girl say they were really angels.\n\nSome poet has thought this already:\n\n\"A gull–nay rather\n\nA spirit on eternity's wide sea\n\nCalling: 'Come thou where all we\n\nGlad souls be.'\"\n\nAs we watch them rise, quivering, falling, poising, and soaring like living fountains of wings, we wot that an angel could assume many forms less suitable and beautiful than that of a snow-white bird.\n\nThere is a Scotsman aboard whose chief aim seems to be the tabulation of all kinds of facts relating to Canada. Under the caption \"Street Lamps of the Waterways,\" he has the number of light-houses, fog-stations and fog-horns in the Dominion; also their cost of maintenance. He has noted that in the years 1870 to 1902 the deaths on Canadian and British sea-going vessels, in our waters, have been 5,247. We have been trying to figure out the chances against our landing safely. They are, we conclude, about 100,000 to 1.\n\nThe woman who sits by me at the table is a person of varied interests and many pursuits. She is short-breathed and long-winded. She has \"a voice.\" I mean one of those talking voices that continue to go through you long after the speaker has disappeared. She wants to know my age, my income, and how much I paid for my steamer-rug. She has a passion for \"getting at the heart of things.\"\n\nAt nightfall a stiff wind blew up. There is nothing in the lake line superior to Lake Superior in a blow. I thought of certain characters in a song who \"went to sea in a sieve they did, in a sieve they went to sea.\"\n\nI am a most penitent traveller. Seasickness is an attitude which no amount of \"new thought\" can render graceful or dignified.\n\nThe Padre is one of those hateful people who are always well, even in a storm. He seems to think the malady amusing, and made himeslf objectionable by explaining to me the co-relation between she-sickness and nau-she-a.\n\nOn the second day we arrived at Port Arthur, at the head of navigation. My impressions? A green sea, a white ship, yellow sunlight, a city built on seven terraces!\n\nA visit to the Canadian Northern Railway elevator at this port gives one, more than any other place, an idea of the enormous output of the Western wheatfields. In a glib way we talk of \"millions of wheat,\" but it is only when we look at the space it takes to hold a million bushels that we begin, in any measure, to comprehend the meaning of the words. I had to climb eighteen flights of stairs to look down the bins. I tried to explain to my guide that this was a magazine of cereal stories, but my little joke was quite lost.\n\nThe storage capacity of the building makes the enormous total of seven million bushels. The grain is held in huge circular towers or bins, each being eighty-five feet deep. It is an almost fearsome experience to look down their black cavernous depths. It gives one a nightmare at noonday. These giant bins are made of fireproof tiles which are set in bands of steel, embedded in cement. This makes the grain not only immune from fire but also from heat. Fifteen cars of grain may be run through the elevators every hour. The process by which the wheat is elevated, cleaned, weighed, and carried to its particular bin is a marvel of clever, but withal simple, mechanism.\n\nThe great bulk of grain grown in the North-West must be stored at Port Arthur. It is here one sees Canada's answer to the world's call for wheat. This is why elevators are of universal interest. It is not because they tell the progress of great companies, but in that they are chapters which mark the upward steps of our young land in clear, monetary gain, and consequently in knowledge, science, civilisation and all else for which wealth stands.\n\nIt is on these great mountains of grain, too, that the federation of the Empire will largely stand. Interdependent, the Colony shall feed the Motherland, and in return shall receive protection against the covetous claws of the world.\n\nIt has been computed that the wheat grown in Canada last year was sufficient to make a string of two-pound loaves which would pass around the world four times.\n\nIn China rice is life. In Canada life is wheat. We should throw wheat on our brides.\n\nWho so great as to pen the song of the wheat? Who can sum up its epic? From its sibilant swish on the wide-flung steppes to its whir and crunch under the wheels of the mill, wheat sums up the tale of the race. Like love, wheat rules the court, the camp, the grove. It makes or breaks the world of men. Wheat is blood. Wheat is life. Who can sing its song?\n\nII\n\nOUT WEST\n\nT Winnipeg, the new Canadian Pacific Railway station is going forward. We were dumped out of the train into a great block of people and building material–hundreds of the former, tons of the latter. An hotel \"tout\" seized us, and seemed much grieved that we did not care to avail ourselves of his kindly services. We took a carriage, and our driver wanted to overcharge us, and then had no change. No one ever saw a cabman with change. The final argument was interesting, if not wholly edifying, but I felt like the old woman an American essayist tells about. She witnessed with arms akimbo a conflict between her husband and a bear. \"Go it, husband!\" she said. \"Go it bear! I don't care which beats.\"\n\nHow the sun shines here in Winnipeg! One drinks it in like wine. And how the bells ring! It is a town of bells and light set in a blaze of gold. Surely the West is golden–the sky, flowers, wheat, hearts.\n\nWinnipeg is changing from wood to stone. She is growing city-like in granite and asphalt. Hitherto, banks and hotels were run up over-night, and had to pay for themselves in the next twenty-four hours.\n\nWinnipeg has something western, something southern, something quite her own. She is an up-and-doing place. She has swagger, impelling arrogance, enterprise, and an abiding spirit of usefulness.\n\n\"What I like,\" says an American to me, \"is the eternal spunk of the place.\"\n\nWinnipeg is another name for opportunity. The wise men did come from the east. They are all here. Winnipeg is a city of young men, and youth is ambitious. It is called \"the bull's-eye lantern of the Dominion,\" and \"the buckle of the wheat belt.\" If you want to please a Winnipegger, tell him the city's growth is steady and healthy–not a bit of a boom about it. You will be telling the absolute truth at the same time.\n\nOn the streets of Winnipeg, there are people who smile at you in English, but speak in Russian. There are rushful, pushful people from \"the States,\" stiff-tongued Germans, ginger-headed Icelanders, Galicians, Norwegians, Poles, and Frenchmen, all of whom are rapidly becoming irreproachably Canadian. In all there are sixty tongues in the pot.\n\nThe real Westerner is well proportioned. He is tall, deep-chested, and lean in the flank. His body betrays, in every poise and motion, a daily life of activity in the open air. His glances are full of wist and warmth. There is an air of business about his off-hand way of settling a matter that is very assuring.\n\nEvery mother's son of them is a compendium of worldly wisdom and a marvel of human experience. What more does any country want?\n\nIn the evening we went to church at Holy Trinity. The preacher was a theological professor from one of the lower provinces. I knew him once as a brilliant young student, and was pleased to see him mount the pulpit.\n\nBut, alas! \"how the devil spoils a fire God gave for other ends!\"\n\nOur friend undoubtedly feels he has a reputation to keep up as a controversialist and dogmatist, and so turns the pulpit into a kind of theological fortification, from whence he pours down broadsides on the doubts and mooted questions which he imagines are greatly troubling us.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, few of us are puzzling over the \"tangled Trinities,\" over these analytical, metaphysical aridities which may be picked out from what Hume would designate as the \"speculative tenet of Theism.\" They are too much out of the beaten track, and besides, most of us are kept far too busy, week days and Sundays, fighting the world, the flesh, and the devil.\n\nThere are some of us–in truth, many of us–who do not care about the wonderful something in the future; nor do we desire, in the present, morbid self-introspection and gloom. We ask the Church to teach us how we may live life now; how we may have it in large, abundant measure. We want to know how to be strong, healthy and holy (wholesome), happy, and wise. And if there are other worlds we want the same things there.\n\nOn Monday we leave Winnipeg for Poplar Bluff, via the Canadian Northern Railway.\n\nThe country through which we are passing is as full of flowers as any paradise of Fra Angelico's. Mile upon mile is covered with a pretty purple flower that I do not know. I mentally catalogue it as the purple blossom the German prince in the fairy tale found on the hillside, and which he used to disenchant his love who lay in the old witches' cottage by the forest.\n\nMillions upon millions of sunflowers, no bigger than my watch, blossom in a continuous bed.\n\nI never saw Madame Sunflower turn to the sun. The French have. They call her \"Tournesol.\" Moore must have too, for he sings,\n\n\"The sunflower turns on her god when he sets\n\nThe same look which she turn'd when he rose.\"\n\nA heavy-necked \"Commercial\" who is sitting beside me has risked an inconsequential remark upon the weather, that introductory topic responsible for so much of the world's misery.\n\nBut it is always well to be civil to Commercials. They are experienced and knowledgeable men of the world–men of account.\n\nThis is one from the Land of Cakes. His speech bewrayeth him. I change the conversation from the weather to the sunflowers.\n\nHe is a canny chiel, this Scotsman, and tells me how the sunflowers may be utilised. The seeds, if roasted, will make a drink almost as tasty as cocoa, and, if ground into flour, make excellent cakes. Just before the flowers bloom, if well boiled, they will make a dish with a taste between the cauliflower and artichoke. Blotting-paper may be manufactured out of the seed-pods. The fibre of the stalk is useful for quite half a dozen things, and, when dry, is as hard as maple wood. The seedheads, with the seeds in, burn better than the best hard coal. The leaves can be used as tobacco. If planted in a malarial district, they are a protection against fever.\n\nI bow in homage to you, Madame Sunflower!\n\nThe wild roses have fruited, and cover the low bushes like elfin bonfires.\n\nThe Commercial informs me that the flower of the prairie rose is a thermometer by which the knowing \"agriculturalist\" (he means \"farmer\") can tell whether the land has an exposure to the early summer and late autumn frosts. It appears the tiny, crimson point of the bud which protrudes from the calyx is very sensitive, and more easily blighted by frost than any other bud.\n\nIt is a pity prospecting emigrants from the East are not aware that Nature has placed so cheap and convenient a weather-glass to their hand.\n\nI think the reason prairie flowers are more beautiful than their city cousins is because they are loosely ordered and simply grow out of the grass. Their setting is quite inimitable by art, in spite of all its cunning. The green world they live in sets them off.\n\nTo look long at this blaze of purple and gold is to be filled with a desire, in some way, to make it a part of one, to feel it in one's pulses, and live it out in the world. This must have been what Tennyson experienced when he said, \"The soul of the rose went into my blood.\"\n\nThe architecture here is early Western style and possesses the high art of simplicity. The people are in such haste to get to work they have no time for building houses, and so are content with shells–\"shacks\" they call them. They are such houses as Thoreau described as a tool-box with a few auger holes bored in it to admit light, and a hook to fasten down the lid at night.\n\nThe stoutly-built Galician homes, while by no means arts-and-crafts mansions, are not so inartistic as the tool-boxes in that they seem to grow out of, or fit into, the landscape.\n\nThe life on these isolated steadings must fit Gogol's description of the sleepy life at Ostankino, \"where each door had a separate sound as it turned on its hinges, conveying a distinct articulation to those who could comprehend it.\"\n\nHere and there, we come to a field fat with growing crops. There is actually room for myriads of emigrants in this district. In the words of the good old Sunday school hymn,\n\n\"Thousands now are safely landed\n\nOn this golden shore;\n\nThousands more are on their journey,\n\nYet there's room for thousands more.\"\n\nThere are only three trains a week up this line, and, as yet, there are no Pullmans or dining-cars. At Portage la Prairie and Dauphin the conductor accommodatingly waited while we had dinner and tea. The meals were substantial enough in all conscience, but when they were served it was almost time to get back to the train, and so we ate as if our lives depended on it–\"one feeding like forty.\"\n\nWe reached \"Poplar Bluff\" 1 at midnight after two wretched days and two equally wretched nights of travelling. Our trunks were missing. We were assured they would come on the next train, three days hence. The sidewalk at Poplar Bluff is full of holes. The Scotch Commercial fell into one of them on his way to the hotel. He must have hurt himself for I heard one of the denizens of the place say,\n\n\"Well? Are you ever going to come out of that — place — ?\"\n\nIf you are in search of dirty hotels you can scarcely go amiss here. Whichever one you go to you will wish you had gone to the other.\n\nOur room had a sad-coloured carpet, the smallest washstand ever seen outside a doll's house, and a looking-glass that distorted our faces.\n\nWe slept with some pestilent insects, unchristian in temper and carnivorous in habit. They made me think of the ants mentioned by Pliny and Herodotus which were not so large as a dog, but bigger than a fox.\n\nNor was the table d'hôte more to our taste. When the lumber-jacks have finished feeding, the table-cloth looks like a map of the world done with washes of yellow, brown, and blue. If you are of an inquiring turn of mind, you may satisfy yourself as to what each man ate by the stains around his plate.\n\nThe maid apologised for the drinking-water, saying the \"microbats\" made it dark coloured. The tea is a copperas-tasting decoction. The steak chews like the pneumatic tyre of a bicycle, and I expect to see the boarders die on their chairs by my side. There is nothing viler than \"good, plain Canadian fare.\" No, nothing!\n\nThe discussion at our table at dinner concerned apple-growing in Manitoba. To hear these men talk, one would believe apples were the staple product of the province. These Manitobans would die rather than acknowledge that their province has been slighted by Pomona, and yet apples are as much a forbidden fruit here as in Eden.\n\nA farmer in this district planted some young trees and took ninety-nine precautions to save them. He lost his nurslings on the hundredth, for the field-mice burrowed beneath and cut the roots.\n\nThe wiseacres say the stupid fellow should have beaten a hard path in the snow around each tree.\n\nIndeed, the Manitobans will acknowledge no province as their equal.\n\nManitoba is a corruption of two Indian words Manitou napa, \"the land of the great Spirit.\" The Manitobans translate it more freely as \"God's Country.\"\n\nIII\n\nACROSS THE LAND\n\n\"Let the plough therefore be going and not cease.\"–LATIMER.\n\nE drove to a neighbouring village to-day. On account of the stumps in the middle of the trails, it is almost the universal habit in this district to travel with two horses. Our devious route lay most of the way through forests of poppies.\n\nThese trails wander free as the wind and lead to regions rather than places. They do not seem to have had any surveying, but to have been made after the manner the little maid's mother cut her frock–\"by presume.\"\n\nSometimes, we came to a clearing with a little shack of logs, a cow-byre, and perhaps a herd of full-fed cattle, with calves frisking about in a series of grotesque and ungainly gambols.\n\nIn one blessed spot, a ginger-headed Icelandic giant was turning over his first furrow. The great oxen strained as they pulled the share through the sod and brush. Behind, in the furrow, walked the mother and three little children. They were partners in this undertaking. It was a supreme moment for them. The turning of civic sod was never half so vital. They had crossed a hemisphere to turn this furrow. The steading was holy ground, and, metaphorically, I took off my shoes. These folk are of the \"few elect.\" Thoreau was right when he said, \"We want great peasants more than great heroes.\"\n\nAlong the trails the autumn flowers are mostly yellow. The land is a field of cloth-of-gold, such as any knight might have tilted upon. Gold is the note of my life to-day.\n\n\"All golden is the sunshine,\n\nAnd golden are the flowers.\n\nThe golden wing makes music\n\nIn the long golden hours.\n\nAnd dull gold are the marshes\n\nAnd red-gold are the dunes;\n\nAnd gold the pollen dust is\n\nMoting the quiet moons.\"\n\nThe country hereabouts is alive with rabbits. Hitchy, twitchy, munchy things they are. The Indians call them wahboos, which means \"the little white chaps.\"\n\nThey are not so wild as Mistress Molly Cottontail down in Ontario. Indeed, they dawdle around, and take you in with a half-curious stare, as much as to say, \"Well, Woman Creature, what do you want?\" Then they scuttle off to their warren sanctuary. One of the most delightful excursions in the world must have been that which Alice in Wonderland made into the rabbit-burrow.\n\nThis is \"plague year\" with the rabbits. It comes one year in seven. The plague is a bot which infests the intestines of the animals and kills them off in thousands. It also has a disastrous effect on the wolves who eat the diseased rabbits.\n\nBeing in no hurry we put up at a village hotel. Allah be praised for a leisurely life! The party ordered milk and biscuits, but I had wine and biscuits. It was a sweet drink, full and heady–a ruddy port that harboured a kiss and reflected a glance. I drank one glass–one glass and a spoonful–and enjoyed to the full the unusual delight of feeling wicked that is only experienced by innocent people.\n\nThe hostess was a Frenchwoman. She related how, five years ago, she had walked two hundred miles to this place with her family, for then there were no railways or trails. It was delightful to hear her babble away in soft vowels accompanied by the shrug of her race, which means all things from total ignorance to infinite understanding. Her face is an elusive suggestion of a boy's and a woman's. She is a healthful-bodied, healthful-minded woman, with a fine way of hitting the nail on the head. Finally, her hospitality was as free as it was hearty. Angels could have done no more.\n\nComing home we were drenched. The rain had killed the \"fatted cloud\" for us. The trees were as quiet as whipped children, for the rain was scolding them. And when it stopped raining a miasmic mist chilled us to the very heart. A white mist in the north is a veritable death-sheet. Dante had proper insight when he made the Inferno foggy, and Tennyson, too, in \"Guinevere\", when he wished to presage unutterable sadness, told how\n\n\"The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,\n\nClung to the dead earth, and the land was still.\"\n\nIV\n\nVILLAGE LIFE\n\nHE sword of Damocles, which has been hanging over these golden harvest days, has fallen. We had frost last night, and all the wheat in the valley has suffered. A German from whom we purchased some lime to-day says, \"De Lord am trying to kill off de tam farmers, I can see dot.\" There! Somebody had to say it.\n\nBeing the first day of September, it is the time of paradise for dogs and sportsmen! Duck-shooting opened to-day. One cannot but feel a pity for those feathered creatures who are subjected at once to Nature, \"red in tooth and claw,\" and to the Lords of Creation who carry guns. I have been shooting at a mark this last few days. The Padre says I keep my eyes shut, but he assures me it is not well to worry about it as this fact makes no appreciable difference to my aim.\n\nHere in this little Western village one suffers for want of fruit, and must, perforce, substitute vegetables. I climbed a fence to-day to pull a yellow turnip. There were some geese in the field. I am always afraid of geese. They honk, and squawk, and quack, and hiss, and the more I \"shoo\" them with my skirts, the worse they are.\n\nInadvertently I stirred up the animosity of a wasp, too, and had to run with an impetuosity seldom seen outside a race-course. The Padre cut short the insect's ill-mannered career with his hat. Christopher North was inspired when he said that of all God's creatures the wasp was the only one eternally out of temper.\n\nThe turnip was good. All the wild blessings of the country are bottled up in the turnip. It has a more distinctive flavour than anything else we grow, and yet it is a flavour not easily described. Pungent, acid, and sweet are all applicable terms, yet none is wholly correct. As a complexion beautifier it is unrivalled. It acts on the skin like magic. When any one declines to eat a raw turnip, it is a sure sign that he or she has grown old.\n\nWe also bought a yoke of oxen to-day. There are more oxen hereabout than horses. Our yoke cost one hundred and fifty dollars, but we had the worth of them in fun during the purchase.\n\nThe owner, a queer codger with a red, bibulous face, was anxious to place the good traits of the animals before us in the most favourable light, but in putting the oxen through their paces would burst into purple patches of vituperation.\n\n\"Go on, you blankety-blank, knock-kneed, cloven-hoofed chewer of cuds!\n\n\"Now, ma'am, can't they walk some?\n\n\"Get out of the mud there, you stall-fed, lounging lump of wickedness!\n\n\"Yes, siree, Boss! You needn't laugh. Them's the finest beasts in the valley. They're slick as shootin'.\"\n\nI suspect it is true what they say out here: \"No one can serve God and drive oxen.\"\n\nThis hamlet of Poplar Bluff, which is to be our home for at least two years, is not famous in history. Of course, it will be some day, the same as all other Western places. At present, it is only one of the many small villages with big names like Kitchener, Durban, Emerson, Mafeking, Roosevelt, Gladstone, and Cartier. Indeed, we are no longer in swaddling clothes, for our chemist has laid in a supply of blue and gold glassware decorated with the picture of our barber's shop, hotel, and butcher's stall. They are \"Souvenirs of Poplar Bluff.\"\n\nThey doubtless serve a purpose. Travellers who buy them will remember they were here.\n\nYou can get anything in the stores except the thing you want at the identical moment.\n\nEach store is a departmental repository, a multifarious bazaar, where one may purchase blizzard-caps, hip-boots, blankets, guns, gloves, grain-bags, laces and larrigans, molasses and moccasins, shoes and steel traps, tea and tump-lines, tacks and thread. The prices are not extravagant either. Perhaps the biggest \"beat\" is our daily bread. It costs ten cents a small loaf. I have altered the Lord's Prayer to cover this item.\n\nEverybody–literally everybody–in Poplar Bluff is in real estate. One would naturally think the supply of real estate would run out, but such is far from being the case. The villagers sell to immigrants, they sell to each other, and, now and then, the loan companies swoop down on the fold and give a helping-hand.\n\nI do not know whether any are growing rich, but they say it keeps money in circulation. This seems an end greatly to be desired.\n\nThe clergy in Poplar Bluff are numerous enough to preach the Gospel to every creature. There are five, not counting the students from theological colleges who are here for the summer. The population is about three hundred. Still, this cannot be helped, for our mission boards must really make an endeavour to spend the money contributed by the very generous people \"back East.\"\n\nIt is both costly and difficult to be clean in our burg. Circumstances are not calculated to encourage \"the great unwashed.\" The only soft water available is caught in rain-barrels. About every fifth family has a well, and about every fifth well is usable.\n\nSome of the households drink the water that drips from their refrigerators. This is considered the best–No. I Hard, so to speak.\n\nOn account of the cold winters, the water is not pumped but is dipped up in buckets. When the worst comes to the worst, a hole can always be made in the ice on the river, and water secured from thence.\n\nThe houses in our village are built without the slightest reference to taste. They are stiff and ugly enough to serve as object-lessons for the crude. They are great wooden sarcophagi built solely to furnish shelter.\n\nThe Presbyterian pastor and his family of seven have been living in a one-roomed shack, but they have lately moved into more commodious, although hardly more beautiful, quarters.\n\nThe Baptist preacher's family is domiciled in one room with a \"lean-to.\"\n\nThe Episcopal clergyman, a wide-awake young bachelor, has a two-roomed house and \"boards around.\"\n\nThe Disciples' preacher is a carpenter, and so has a commodious house with clapboard exterior and gingerbreadesque ornaments.\n\nOur own house is undergoing renovation. It is a hideous, card-board box that looks like a toy in which if you lifted the roof, you would find jellies, fruits, or chocolates. I must not forget to mention that it is decorated on the gable with a blue and crimson sunset.\n\nWhen we came to move in, we found there were no laths or plaster on the walls, because, forsooth, there are no plasterers here. The paper is put on over stretched cheese-cloth, and every time you lean against it, you go through and see daylight in the chinks of the outer shell.\n\nThe men are at work doing better things for us. We shall have three bedrooms, a dressing-room, parlour, study, dining-room, kitchen, and servant's room. We have no furnace, bathroom, cellar, or woodshed. Perhaps we shall have these later, for the rule here seems to be to build from the top. The stone foundation is usually built after the house has been standing a year; later a cellar is dug out, and finally, as the family increases in wealth, or as they get leisure, a drain is added.\n\nThe hotels and shops are finished inside and outside with embossed and painted tin. The finish is as ugly as it sounds. This, I am told, is in deference to the underwriters. Besides, lumber is expensive, planed spruce-boards selling at $26 per thousand feet.\n\nSome of the houses have car-roofs. The name is exactly descriptive.\n\nV\n\nMORTUARY MUSINGS\n\n\"When the earth was sick and the skies were gray,\n\nAnd the woods were rolled with rain,\n\nThe dead man rode through the autumn day\n\nTo visit his love again.\"\n\nOLD BALLAD.\n\nHE Padre bought some graves to-day, and is having them levelled. I argue that he could spend his money to better advantage. He flatly contradicts me, and claims that the first use of money, as far as we know, was for a burial, and the first sale of land was for a cemetery.\n\nThese graves were made here before the village cemetery was purchased. They are desolate-looking hillocks, but Pokagon stops digging to ask me,\n\n\"Wat de odds, Missus? One grave be comferable as anoder.\"\n\nThe graveyard here is hard to find. It lies some distance off the trail, and its \"shadowed swells\" might almost be trodden over by the pedestrian were it not for a barbed-wire fence that belts one grave and a galvanised iron cross that heads another. The cross bears a type-written inscription, and is erected in memory of a Swedish woman who died only a month ago. The inscription, which is the composition of her husband, reads:\n\n\"No more thou are, and no one here are so to me in kindness. Such hearted breast, such lovely voice no more on earth be found.\"\n\nI think, perhaps, this means something more than the epitaphic literature we Canadians are wont to select out of the stock-book belonging to the monument builders.\n\nAs I push back the undergrowth and read the inscription on the wooden \"stones,\" I am filled with a throbbing pity, for all the ages indicate that strong, young lives are throttled at their flood-tide.\n\nThe fascination of a cemetery is irresistible to me. The cemetery is populated with people who are always \"at home.\" I ask them foolish things. Are they really dead? Do they live again? Or is it we in the flesh who are dead? We who weep. We who sin. Is it we who are dead?\n\nThis graveyard is in a state of absolute neglect, and consequently is evidence of our low civilisation. The village cemetery, I take it, marks the degree of the village culture.\n\nOur dear ones go from the home circle to the open congregation, and their remains are a solemn deposit entrusted to our honour.\n\nBut, somehow or other, they are very, very dead, and the living are hungry, tired, impatient, and make many calls on us.\n\nA shabby graveyard has its uses, though. It humbles us. We think we are of the utmost importance to our little circle of kin, and in truth we are, but it is astonishing how quickly the waters close over the spot where we went down. Our dearest will even say it was \"a happy release,\" that we are \"better off,\" or use some equally empty expression as a mere covering for a lack of sensibility.\n\nVI\n\nAUTUMN DAYS\n\nESTERDAY was brimful of liquid sunshine. It was as good as gold–indeed much better than gold.\n\nSince coming here, I have lost my old habit of insomnia, and am beginning to like the place better. It reminds one of Winthrop's description of Acadia–\"a land where sunshine never scorches and yet shade is sweet; where simple pleasures please; where the sky is bright, and green fields satisfy for ever.\"\n\nEvery one who writes from the East sympathises with me in this \"Ultima dim Thule.\" I cannot say that I think as much of Thule as the people in it, but I am beginning to learn how much I can drop out of life without being unhappy. I find almost as much joy in losing my knowledge as I did in acquiring it. The 'ologies and 'osophies, the big causes, cultures, and cants are not so sweet to my taste as\n\n\"The lore o' men that ha' dwelt with men,\n\nIn new and naked lands.\"\n\nYesterday, the vicar drove me to his two appointments. Our way lay for the most part through a forest with a prodigal luxuriance of undergrowth, but now and then we emerged into a stumpy clearing where the land looked smooth and fat. It is what they call in Manitoba \"mellow\" clay. That is, it turns over without sticking to the spade.\n\nWalt Whitman apostrophised this country as \"thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns.\" It will be many a day before this vicinity can be thus addressed. At best, the barns are 12 by 14 shacks, log-roofed, thatch-roofed, sod-roofed, roofed anyhow. Indeed, there is but little occasion for barns. The farmer stacks and threshes his grain in the field, and at once takes it to market.\n\nAt some of the bachelor shacks the men were hanging out their Sunday washing, and the garments disported themselves in the wind with an utter abandonment of decency.\n\nThe vicar thinks quite badly of the village girls because they refuse to marry the bachelors and live in these shacks. On the contrary, I contend that it speaks well for them. Any girl who was not wholly insane would prefer a brick-clad house with lace curtains, and perhaps a piano and a carpet-sweeper.\n\nMatrimony is the only game of chance the clergy favour.\n\nBesides, there are not sufficient village girls to go round. The unequal distribution of trousers and skirts in Canada makes countless thousands mourn and so, perforce, the Eastern spinster and Western bachelor sigh vainly for each other like the pine and palm.\n\nWe stopped to examine a rat colony which was situated in the centre of a green, sluggish pond. Their houses, which are dome-shaped, are made of grass, moss, reeds, and sticks. The musquash travels with a queer, wriggling motion, has webbed feet, a flat tail, and a clay-coloured body.\n\nThe Indians trap thousands of them every year. It cannot be called a slaughter, though, for these rodents multiply at a most surprising rate. Besides, as Miss Laut has already pointed out, linings for coats do more to save life than all the Humane Societies in the world.\n\nThat I might live out of doors these autumn days, the Padre bought me a pony. It is a half-breed–perhaps only a quarter-breed–at any rate, a mongrel Indian pony. I have christened him \"Shawna,\" which is Indian for \"Sweet Thing.\"\n\nHis conduct leads me to believe that he is no more likely to measure up to his name than the youthful George Washingtons, Wesleys, or Albert Edwards we meet in all quarters of the world.\n\nA more characteristic cognomen would have been \"Paul,\" because he suffers not a woman to have authority. He fairly bowls along with the Padre, but once I mount he stands stock-still.\n\nHe has all the traits the vendor claimed for him–backbone and stamina, perseverance, grit, pluck, staying powers, and \"sand.\" Indeed he has!\n\nThe Padre casts aspersions on my equestrianism but this is because he does not like to acknowledge he was sold with the pony.\n\nPeter Paulson, one of our workmen, is having trouble, too, with the oxen. They have been jerking him whither they would. He hitched them on the wrong side, got them astride a stump, or tangled up the lines. Peter did not like to dig on the canal we are making from the river to the sleugh where the logs from our timber-limit are to be boomed, so the Padre gave him a job as driver. He was a goldsmith in Copenhagen, but recently lived in Greenland. He has been in this country six months, and speaks our language well enough for all ordinary uses. I heard him call one of the men \"Rubber\" the other day!\n\nThis afternoon he has been arrested for taking whisky to the Indians. One of the squaws imbibed freely, and this morning was found, burned to death, by the camp fire. She was Henry Brass's mother-in-law. Henry is digging on the canal. He came at noon to the house and asked me for a spade with which to dig his mother-in-law's grave. He was one of the revellers too, and will probably have to explain to the coroner.\n\nAnother of our men, Michael Peck, is in trouble. His \"wife,\" who is also my scrub-woman, has been arrested and goes to jail at Portage la Prairie to-night, for trial. She tried to kill Michael last night with a razor. It should be seen that since the initial error of Eve a certain amount of \"devil\" has been apportioned to all flesh.\n\nThree bears entered the village last night and partly demolished the carcass of a horse. They escaped without a shot being aimed at them.\n\nBears, moose, and other large animals are plentiful in this district. Over one hundred years ago, Daniel Harmon, a factor of the North West Fur Company, wrote that in this vicinity the animals were \"moose, red deer, a species of antelope, grey, black, brown, chocolate-coloured and yellowish bears, two species of wolves, wolverines, polecats or skunks, lynxes, kitts, beavers, otters, fishers, martins, minks, badgers, musk-rats, and black, silver, cross and red foxes.\"\n\nAll these autumn nights the sky is aglow with northern lights. The youngsters assure me they are glory gleams from the angel children as they dance about the Pole. There have been other and less beautiful explanations.\n\n'Tis a pity one cannot even approximately describe the aurora. Words stop short at form. They cannot translate colour. The aurora may best be described as \"an intermediate, somewhat between a thought and a thing.\"\n\nDuring the occurrence of this phenomenon, the telegraphic system is deranged, showing the intimate connection between these lights and the magnetism of the earth. The magnetic needle also deviates several degrees from its normal position, and it is most affected when the aurora is brightest.\n\nI think the proximity of the magnetic pole has something to do with the superiority of the Northmen. The best peoples of the world have come out of the north, and the longer they are away from boreal regions in such proportion do they degenerate.\n\nVII\n\nPICKINGS ABOUT PIE\n\nAM devoting my days and my nights to pie.\n\nI heartily agree with Mr. Crosland, the English essayist, that, properly considered, the pie is one of the finest things humanity is capable of producing.\n\nIt has been my lifelong ambition to perform this culinary feat, and now I can make a pie–such a pie that, on tasting it, you will, as Brillat-Savarin says, \"see wonders.\"\n\nMy recipe? I just take a pinch o' this, and a handful o' that, and a squeeze of lemon juice–that most delicate acid Nature has ever distilled–and then you have it.\n\nStand back and look! It is the colour of the morning sunlight. Come near and smell. It is the distracting odour of the forbidden fruit. Shut your eyes! It is a dream.\n\nUp to date, I have been president of thirteen women's societies or clubs, but it required infinitely more boldness, more accurate calculation, greater finesse, and deeper insight to tackle the pie art.\n\nLike Gail Hamilton, all I knew about a pie hitherto, was to know it when I saw it. But now!\n\nMy first crust was not a success. The same applies to several succeeding ones. But it was not my fault. The recipe did not say the water must be cold, and so, naturally I used hot. It was tough enough (I mean the pie) to sew buttons on. Then followed a series with boggy foundations. The family called them \"muskegs.\"\n\nHow hateful the family were! They would persist in tracing the origin of the word \"pie,\" and would conclude that it comes from the Latin pica, from whose black and white aspects come \"pied\" and \"piebald,\" and is the same pie by which printers describe type that is all jumbled up.\n\nThe word \"tart\" they traced back to the Latin tortus, meaning twisted. The twisting, they argue, refers rather to the effects of the tart than to its shape.\n\nThey gave it as their opinion that I had proved the falsity of the dictum that it was not possible to eat your pie and have it. And one day the Padre told a story of a philosopher who said:\n\n\"Tell me what people read, and I will tell you what they are.\"\n\n\"Well, there's my wife,\" rejoined the dyspeptic party. \"She's for ever reading cookery books. Now, what is she?\"\n\n\"Why, a cook, of course,\" replied the philosophy dispenser.\n\n\"That's where the spokes rattle in your wheels,\" said the other. \"She only thinks she is.\"\n\nMy greatest difficulty has been to know how to decorate the edges. Sometimes I use a fork, and sometimes I scallop them with a spoon, but the impress of the latter looks too much like a thumb mark. I asked the milkman about it the other day. He is my most sympathetic friend and counsellor. He did not offer his opinion, but he told me a story of a certain mistress who, for the amusement of her company, wished to rally her servant upon the fantastic ornament of a huge pie.\n\n\"Why, Bridget,\" she said. \"Did you do this? You are an artist. How did you do it?\"\n\n\"Indade it was meself that did it,\" replied Bridget, \"Isn't it pretty, mum? I did it with your false teeth, mum.\"\n\nI have best luck with my Sunday pies. Once the Padre lectured me about it, but I got rid of him by putting flour on his coat.\n\nHe is quite wrong about Sunday pies. They are pious acts. It is quite possible for a pie to comfort the soul. I have proved it over and over, and so great an authority as Leach holds this view too. He says that the small boy who interrupted a description of heaven to ask, \"Do they have a good cook there?\" had his finger on the foundation-stone of human happiness.\n\nVIII\n\nIN THE STING OF THE NORTH WIND\n\nSTARTED out with the Padre this morning for the timber-limit.\n\nThe thermometer stood at 48° below zero. It was a clear, shining day of pitiless cold–a day on which it is not difficult to understand the idea of sun worship.\n\nThey made me a bed in the sleigh. It consisted of a heap of hay, rugs, furs and pillows. In sooth, it was \"a couch more soft than sleep.\"\n\nSometimes our way lay along the beaten trails, and sometimes we crossed fluffy snow-fields of dead white, where the wind had brushed up drifts of fantastic sculpturing.\n\nThe supple undulations and exquisite curves of these waves of snow, held in the lethal grasp of winter, are always a joy to the eyes. They are wraith forms that never repeat themselves, and so prove a never-ending source of wonder and novelty.\n\nAhead of us drove a man in a Russian sled. His horses were rimey with frozen breath. The sled was infinitely more artistic than our Canadian cutters. It was painted black, with a horse rampant in white and some queer, unconventional designs. The Canadian cutter, besides being ugly, is uncomfortable. It has not enough back or side support, and there is not sufficient room to stretch your legs. The seat is too big for one, and not large enough for two. It is provocative of rheumatism and kidney disease.\n\nWe passed a quaint, pleasing log house of octagon shape. It is not often the settlers care to take the time to attempt anything like elegance in their homes.\n\nHere and there we were greeted by snarling, yellow curs, for all the settlers keep dogs.\n\nLapland snow-birds, in rustling bunches, rose up from almost under our horses' hoofs. These feathered sprites are white in colour, and belong to the family of finches. They build their nests on the ground because trees are not common in their homeland. They utter tiny chirps like weak fifes.\n\nA snowy owl, perched on a dead tree, made a striking picture. By popular prejudice this bird is connected with night and black deeds, but I am told this species seeks its prey in daytime, its victims being rabbits, birds, mice and mink. Minerva sat on her perch with an odd air of gravity, and when the Padre raised his gun she assumed a grotesque attitude, finally flying off with a half-wheeze, half-croak.\n\nThe Padre said he did not shoot out of deference for her. He believes there is something half human about an owl. I think, maybe, he is right. It is the only bird that has an external ear. A certain loresman declares that the owl was a baker's daughter. She sat up all night to make loaves for the workmen, who found her every morning blinking with sleep. By and by she actually turned into an owl.\n\nThe rabbits are ubiquitous. Their numbers recall the story of a little girl who explained that when God made babies He made them one by one, but when He came to make rabbits He said, \"Let there be rabbits!\" and there were rabbits. They do not bother to hide as we pass by.\n\nThe chief enemy of these little rodents is the wolf. In one place we saw where Brer Rabbit had been killed and eaten. They themselves dine off poplar boughs. Wherever a limb falls they nibble off every vestige of bark.\n\nI got out of my nest to hold the horses while the Padre shot at and missed a coyote. This \"four-footed friar in orders grey\" had histrionic ability. Sometimes he slunk along in devious loop-like curves, and again he leaped into the air and stood stock-still. He is a regular Joey Bagstock of animals. \"Sly, sir, devilish sly, is old Joe.\" One tries hard to think why this lurking, cowardly, complaining, white-toothed brute should have been sacred to the stalwart Mars.\n\nNo one seems to have understood the coyote so well as Bret Harte, who has described him as\n\n\"A shade on the stubble, a ghost by the wall,\n\nNow leaping, now limping, now risking a fall.\n\nLop-eared and large-jointed, but ever alway\n\nA thoroughly vagabond outcast in gray.\"\n\nWe stopped at Tibble's clearing to get warmed. They have thirteen children and a home-made furnace. The registers are the cracks in the floor. We exchanged courtesies. Mrs. Tibble gave me a tatted collar, and I have promised to send her a package of literature monthly.\n\nWe met a Mr. Bowles there. He came out from England last year. He told me that while hitching his horses to the sleigh this morning, the coyotes were so thick about him that he was afraid to turn his back lest they should jump on him. The Padre says his fears are wholly groundless, for the coyotes are cowardly and will not attack a man.\n\nAs we faced north-west, we saw Thunder Hill, a wooded mountain of indigo-blue aligning the horizon. At long intervals we passed bachelor shacks. The lives of these men must be as lonely as that of Robinson Crusoe. They must possess a queer mental crotchet to thus isolate themselves. Fishes go in shoals, bees in swarms, cattle in herds, and the normal man is gregarious. Bacon has said, \"Whoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god.\"\n\nI asked the Padre what he thought about it. He did not say, but told me that once a barber asked Webster how he liked to be shaved. The great man replied, \"In silence.\"\n\nI am still wondering if he meant the story to apply to the bachelors or to me.\n\nOf a sudden, we saw a hurtling, quick-moving compact mass on the trail some hundreds of yards ahead.\n\n\"Moose!\" hissed the Padre.\n\nI felt swift thrills up and down my spine, and a sudden tightness of the throat. It was a sight to see milord the Moose in his natural setting.\n\nThe Padre was too late with his deadly barrel, and glad I was, for the moose are \"God's own horses.\" Their lives are more interesting than their deaths. The Padre said I get moral when the grapes are sour. I retorted by telling him that a man with a gun is a savage. When we both calmed down, undeterred by his story anent Webster, I asked him a string of questions. He did not answer me till I reminded him that Archimedes was slain because he did not answer a question that was asked him. Here is the summary of his replies:–\n\nThe moose was probably attracted by the sound of our bells. Above all else the bull is curious. The Indians have a \"long call\" which they make with a birch-bark horn. It is in simulation of the cow's call for her mate, but the Padre says it is not a good imitation and any unusual sound will \"fetch him.\" This method of luring the buck seems treacherous. What odds that the buck is often brutal, a coward, or selfish? It is not sport, and does violence to our social sentiments. Wherever an Indian kills a moose, he moves his camp thither. The moose \"yard-up\" for winter. Their chief food is the branches of the moose-willow. Indeed, their name is derived from the Indian word mouswah, meaning wood-eater. (N.B.–I am not sure of this. Perhaps the Padre coined the word to impress me with his knowledge.) The Padre says the moose also browses on the shoots of young spruce-trees. I am not sure of this either, for I have heard tell that the squirrel is the only animal that likes turpentine. Nature or evolution has endowed the moose with a wonderful nose, not only in size, but in acuteness of scent. This is why he is called the \"Hebrew of the Woods.\" He has remarkable ears too, and hunters say that if you can feel his ears and nose you can put salt on his tail.\n\nFurther on, the Padre shot a huge timber-wolf. It whirled round and round, and then, with a half-keyed shriek suggesting the lamentation of a lost soul, angled off into the brush, leaving a trail of blood. The Padre followed a short distance but returned empty-armed, for the snow was almost hip-deep.\n\nThe timber-wolves are the only animals the Indians are afraid of. Their mode of attack is effective. They hamstring their man–that is, they cut the sinews of his legs–and so he falls a helpless prey.\n\nIX\n\nWITH THE DUKHOBORS\n\n\"Of course I am interested in my neighbour. Why shouldn't I be? That fence between us only whets my appetite.\"\n\nT was seven o'clock when we sighted the Dukhobor village of Vosnesenia. It is built on rising ground, and the site has been well chosen. The drainage is perfect. Ditches on either side of the village carry the water to a small creek that winds through the lowland.\n\nArriving at Vosnesenia, we went to Eli's house. He has frequently worked for us, and the Padre says his house is one of the cleanest and most comfortable in the village.\n\nThe houses are arranged on both sides of a wide street, and are foreign in every line. They are one-storied, and of unsawn lumber plastered with clay. They are whitewashed, and frescoed with vivid dadoes. Sometimes the roofs project into verandas, which are ornamented with carving. The blinds are on the outside, and consist of several thicknesses of hemp. These have a superlative advantage. Early callers know whether the inmates are ready or not to receive them.\n\nThe Padre went into the house to know if we might spend the night with them. I was presently surrounded by men, women and children, and borne triumphantly indoors, all the while feeling that I was being examined with a directness that was disconcerting.\n\nThey took off my headgear, fur coat, and golf-jacket, and finally tackled my footgear. Then they all laughed at the great heap of dry-goods I had shed. My hatpins afforded them especial amusement. They pushed them in and out of my cap many times.\n\nWhen our \"grub\" box was brought in, I sallied to the kitchen to get tea ready. The stove was made of baked clay. It was what Mr. Arnold Haultain has described as \"an ungainly but highly satisfactory stove.\" I put a handful of tea in the pot, and gave it to one of the women to steep. She poured half a cupful of water on, and then proceeded to pour it off. I was afraid of losing my brew, but unnecessarily, for this was only to free the leaves of dust and other impurities–surely a laudable and sanitary precaution.\n\nI cooked bacon in my own pan, and fried some potatoes. One of the little girls held her nose during the cooking process. Eli told me she did not like \"the stank.\"\n\nThe Dukhobors are vegetarians, and urge with their kind that we \"make graveyards of our stomachs.\" I explained to Eli that the Israelites ate angels' food in the wilderness, and remained stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart.\n\n\"Me no understand,\" said Eli. He is a sly fellow, this Eli, and does not like to be drawn out.\n\nThe table off which the Dukhobors eat is small. With them, dining is clearly not a function. They spread a white cloth over the table in our honour. They also set down a plate of their bread. In colour it resembled New Orleans treacle, and had we no fine stomachic sensibilities I am sure we should have found it highly nutritive. I do not know what they put in it, but should say its component parts are similar to those of bread I once ate in Germany, consisting of three parts specially prepared sawdust and one part rye-flour.\n\nThe women of the household washed my dishes. How many women were there? I do not know. There were four generations of them. Some of the houses have five.\n\nThe news had spread that we were in the village, and soon all the young men and maidens gathered to see us. They were taking us in, and it would doubtless have been a thorn in our pride if we knew what they thought of us.\n\nThe girls entered, and made a stately bow, which I must practise. It is beautiful. The women wear short postillion-like jackets of black sateen. Their skirts are short, and made without gores, being gathered in evenly all round the waist-line. They nearly all wore aprons, the bottom of which had knitted woollen bands edged with scallops. They affected every colour, and even succeeded in blending purple, red and green in a happy triple alliance.\n\nThe unmarried women–even the baby girls–wear white kerchiefs on their heads, and the married women coloured ones. These kerchiefs are never doffed. I do not know why, but in likelihood to show they are unquestionably worshipful of their lords.\n\nOn the whole, their dress spells comfort. Their arm-holes are easy; their skirts do not drag; their bodies are not jails of bones and steels, and they wear no cotton-batting contrivances. \"Jennie June\" was right when she said the great art of life is to eliminate.\n\nMost of the Dukhobors can speak a few words of English, and all are anxious to become proficient so that they may go to our villages to work. On this occasion, John, a young Dukhobor who had worked in a Canadian store, and who speaks English fluently, acted as interpreter.\n\nI asked them to sing for us. Their music is not of the \"popular\" variety, and in volume would suffice for a marching regiment. All the sounds seem to come from their head and throat. They do not move their lips, or very slightly, so that I found it difficult to know who was singing. The airs are weird and vagrant. It is astonishing how long they can hold one note. The Dukhobors never use musical instruments. They sang the 77th Psalm, lullabies, and songs of freedom.\n\nPerhaps Tolstoy described the motive of the peasant's song better than any one else. He says it is \"an accessory coming of itself, without effort, and seeming solely to mark cadence.\"\n\nWhen I expressed a wish to retire, the guests bowed themselves out, and one of the women made our bed. It consisted of a feather mattress as soft as marshmallows, and a heap of pillows and blankets. The mattress was very short, being calculated to accommodate only the body and not the legs. It was laid on a wooden bench which was about five feet wide, and ran nearly all the way round the room.\n\nThe men retired to one apartment, the women to another, and Eli and his wife to a third. A woman and baby lay at our feet, and a boy opposite. The baby was placed in a square bed or box which was suspended from the ceiling, something like a bird-cage.\n\nWhile I was undressing, the women returned and examined my clothing with apparent interest. My golf-skirt, with brilliant plaid lining, and my underskirts were handed round, rubbed between the fingers and commented upon. They seemed much pleased with the ribbons running through my underwear, but were shocked and, at the same instant, amused by my corsets. They nudged each other, grinned, and shrugged their shoulders. These corsets were of the long-hipped style, had two pairs of yellow suspenders, and carried a patent busk-protector.\n\nThen they showed me what they wore. Taking all things into consideration, I wouldn't exchange.\n\nAfter we lay down, the women returned once more with articles for sale. We bought some socks and woollen mittens. The mittens were white, and had white fleece knitted inside, making them as warm as fur.\n\nHeavens! but the heat was awful. No Pullman car was ever comparable, nor baker's oven for that matter. The women kept piling on dry tamarack wood at intervals all night. I gasped and suffocated, and thought longingly of the dress mentioned by Rabelais as \"nothing before, nothing behind, with sleeves of the same.\"\n\nAnd the cat walked over me most of the night, for in an ill-guided moment I had fed it with meat, and so it was showing me some cupboard love.\n\nThe men were having breakfast when I awoke. They were dipping soup out of a bowl with wooden spoons. Each man had a huge chunk of bread. A plate of sliced turnips and a dish of baked potatoes completed their \"halesome farin'.\" As I watched them eat, I thought of Bronson Alcott, \"the tiresome archangel,\" who kept only \"a chaste supply of water and vegetables for his bodily needs.\"\n\nTea was the last course, and was served separately. The men stood with bowed heads, and returned thanks with profound and unaffected devotion before leaving the table. Even our unhallowed presence did not disturb them.\n\nI had some of the soup for my breakfast. It was made of cabbages, onions, potatoes, and butter. The matter with it was that the onion was at its very worst moment. A raw onion is palatable, a cooked onion is toothsome, but an onion that has merely undergone a heat change is devastating in its effects upon the feeder.\n\nThey also gave me some eggs to cook, and a jug of milk. I gave them a peach pie in return. They threw away the crust because there was lard in it. After eating the fruit they pronounced it \"no good.\" Almost every Dukhobor can say these two words.\n\nThe interiors of the houses are plastered and whitewashed, and decorated with dadoes of brown and yellow. Coloured pictures and calendars are much in evidence. The floor was of clay mixed with mud, and seemed almost as hard as asphalt. The window sills were deep and flower-filled.\n\nThe system being communistic, the houses have only one door. It was Pat Kelly who said to the Liverpool detective, when the latter was looking for Fenians in his saloon:\n\n\"The back door was it your honour was looking for? Sure, the only back door is in the front.\"\n\nOne of the women was making a frock for herself. She used no thimble. I indicated to her with signs that might be useful to the Meisterschaft System that she ought to have one. She produced one from a cupboard and placed it on her first finger. I showed her that I wore it on the second, but she only laughed, and doubtless thought me very stupid and illogical. She seemed to be a nice girl, and bubbling over with what certain superior men describe as \"womanly instinct.\" These thrifty women sew without machines, spin, knit, and make their own baskets and linen. They reap in the harvest fields too, and, if need be, can take a hand at the plough.\n\nBy unfriendly critics, much has been made of the fact that the Dukhobor women perform the arduous work of harnessing themselves to the plough, but this is entirely at their own suggestion.\n\nAt first the women were greatly in the majority, as their fathers, sons, and husbands were in Siberian exile, and much of the work had, therefore, to be done by the womenfolk. It was when only a few draught horses were available, and these were needed to haul logs from a distance so that homes might be built before the rigours of winter set in, that the women volunteered, with true Spartan fortitude, to break up the land.\n\nMay Agnes Fitzgibbon, in her bright letters to the Toronto Globe, speaking of these immigrants, has well said:\n\n\"In the days to come one of the Russian artists in their midst will paint a picture which will be a source of pride to the descendants of these women who shouldered this burden with the same steadfast courage with which they have borne many others.\"\n\nLast season this village bought a steam plough, and the other villages are following suit.\n\nBefore leaving, I went into one of the houses to see the process of making linseed oil. The flax had been chopped, and the women were kneading the meal in troughs. The meal was heated in a large, shallow pan, and then subjected to great pressure under a jack-screw. The refuse, after the oil is extracted, is given to cows, but the children, too, licked it up greedily. The Dukhobors use this oil for various purposes, but mainly for cooking, in the place of animal fats.\n\nAs I watch the easy, muscular movement of the women kneading the meal, it is borne in on me that they have no special need of dumb-bells nor any reason to yearn for physical culture.\n\nDr. Johnson is credited with saying that much can be done with a Scotsman if you catch him young. The same would apply to the Dukhobors. The children are bright, receptive, and keen for work, and will be singing \"The Maple Leaf\" before another decade.\n\nThe boys are the same as other boys, in that they stare, wriggle, snuffle, grin behind your back, and are as hard to hold as quicksilver.\n\nThe girls are round, brown, and dimpled, and as well developed physically as their brothers.\n\nThey are not warm-happed, cuddled, and health-fooded like our children, and so infant mortality is not high among them. Overlooked, almost forgotten, these little wildings gather to themselves sap and sinew like children of the cave-dwellers. It is the shrewd way of God.\n\nI am convinced that these people from the shores of the Black Sea will make excellent citizens. They do not steal–or very seldom–fight, drink intoxicants, smoke, or swear. Their lives are saturated with ideas of thrift and small economies. They hold themselves slaves of neither priest nor landlord, and their history is a story of sturdy struggling for independence.\n\nPeople who are jealous, or misinformed detractors, have made much ado over their unfitness as settlers, and have evidenced their pilgrimages to find Christ as a proof.\n\nOnly twenty per cent of the Dukhobors took part in this pilgrimage, and these were the dupes of a religious fanatic who posed as a prophet. But, as their kindly chronicler, John Elkington, has pointed out, they are not the first people to be made the victims of false teaching through their ignorance of the Bible. At any rate, we may safely say that any shortcomings these simple folk betray are mental rather than moral.\n\nElbert Hubbard, who visited them at the time of their pilgrimage, declared they were not fanatics, but merely Baptists gone to seed. In principle they are Quakers, but style themselves \"The Christian Community of United Brotherhood,\" and are banded together with the primary object of maintaining the principles of peace and love to all men.\n\nTheir system is communistic. The crops and money are all stored in one fund. This practice cannot be set aside as entirely visionary and unworkable when the whole Christian Church kept it without violation for more than two hundred years. Besides, it is something very akin to this system that is advocated to-day by leading Socialists in all parts of the world.\n\nThere are some very apparent benefits in this Dukhobor method, too. The people are not isolated on lonely steadings miles and miles from any one. This loneliness is undoubtedly the greatest trial our settlers have to endure. He was a wise statesman who said it was not a parish council the country needed so much as a parish circus.\n\nIn these Dukhobor villages, the people practically constitute one large family, and know each other's outgoings and incomings, fortunes and misfortunes. It is their habit to visit each other in the evenings, to sew, gossip, sing, or while away the time as wisdom may dictate or fancy lead.\n\nTheir system has another superlative advantage. The wolf is never at the door. Their storehouses have superfluities for none, but an abundance for all.\n\nIt looks, though, as if the iron of worldly ambition has at last got a wedge in their souls. The land which the Government allotted to them is about to be thrown open to settlers. The Government is wholly justified in this action. It is neither wise nor fair to leave a large area of country fallow and unproductive while other people need it.\n\nBut the forfeiture will probably prove too severe a strain on the principles of the community, and the likelihood is that the people will make entries for homesteads.\n\nTheir beautiful ideals will be whittled down by the jack-knife of all-pervading expediency. Their little Arcadias will be broken up, and presently their women, too, will be affecting hatpins, corsets, and yellow garters. The pity of it!\n\nHitherto the sciences and arts have been a quality unfelt, because unknown. They lost some few things; but in losing they gained more. They were wise with the supreme wisdom of simplicity.\n\nX\n\nIN SASKATCHEWAN\n\n\"An' the silence, the shine, an' the size\n\nOf the 'igh, inexpressible skies.\"\n\n–KIPLING.\n\nT was growing dusk when we left Vosnesenia for the Dukhobor saw-mill, our next stage on the journey northward.\n\nWe were now in the territory of Saskatchewan. Our road, at first, ran through a country of park-like character. This road has been cut by the Dukhobors, and is an excellent one. It is also marked out by mile posts. At six miles we came to a half-way house which has been erected for shelter, but we did not stop.\n\nFurther on, the road entered a forest. The picture was one of scant lighting and low values. All colour seemed to be bleached out of the earth.\n\nNow and then the snow cried out in sharp resistance as the sleigh passed over it.\n\nIt was quite dark. The cold was cowing. I cuddled deeper into my blankets.\n\n\"The wood,\" says Tennyson, \"is full of echoes, owls, elfs, ghosts o' the mist, wills-o'-the-wisp. Only they that be bred in it can find their way o' nights in it.\"\n\nSoon we had nothing to talk of. The Padre dropped into poetry and said, somewhat mournfully:\n\n\"With how sad steps, O Moon! thou climbst the skies. How silently, and with how wan a face.\"\n\nI accused him of pretending this apostrophe was a quotation. He assured me it was from an old sonnet which read \"moone\" and \"wanne.\"\n\nHe was not to be set aside on the subject, and went on, telling me that Emerson said a man who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight has been present, like an archangel, at the creation of light.\n\nThen we spoke of Shelley's address to \"the orbed maiden with white fire laden,\" eventually swinging off to a hot discussion of Bacon's theory that all life is larger and more vigorous upon the full of the moon.\n\nOur conversation soon took a lighter tone. The Padre said the man in the moon was there because he broke the Sabbath by picking up chips.\n\nNow the Padre is always dwelling offensively on the matter of Sunday observance, because he disapproves of my making pies on that day instead of teaching Sunday school, and so I contended that the man in the moon ought to be let down again, for it was just possible he lived in the North-West and couldn't help himself. Besides, he probably had an exacting kind of wife who would not go cold, just as husbands won't go hungry. This nettled His Infallible Highness, and he said the man in the moon was a woman because of her changeability, and because she gets reduced to her last quarter every month.\n\nMy theory is that he stays there because he is a manufacturer of counterfeit silver, for he takes in no end of young couples every year. Besides, Mr. Zangwill is on my side. He gives it as his opinion that the moon has \"a blank, idiot face,\" and that it should have been made a chronometer, with hands on it, instead of being left to stare at us so uselessly.\n\nBefore we knew it, the black forest recesses were echoing with laughter and jeers.\n\n\"Night steeped the passing of the day\n\nIn quiet, peace, and love,\n\nWhile Dian in her tranquil way\n\nKicked up a shine above.\"\n\nWe reached the Dukhobor saw-mill at eight o'clock. It is situated on the edge of the timber-limits given to them by the Government.\n\nOn our arrival, our horses were taken from us and we made our way into a long barn-like structure, lighted only by a small, guttering lamp and the glare of the red-hot iron stove.\n\nThe men made way for us. I did not know I was cold till I got into the heat. Had any one touched me, I would have broken in two. I could have cried out with misery and weariness. Of a surety, \"women and gouty legs are best at home.\" Any fool can travel, but it takes a wise woman not to.\n\nA Dukhobor who could speak some English tried to comfort me by telling me how that day he had frozen the heel of his nose.\n\nThe Boss of the mill brought us two cups and a kettle of hot water for tea. It is only recently that china-ware has been used by these refugees from the land of the Tsar.\n\nThe Padre put the food on the table, for I was dazed and stupid. I ate it reclining in true Oriental fashion. There were no chairs, and the table, which was fixed, was situated next one of the bunks.\n\nThis was the sleeping camp, and it is never used for eating except by our own men.\n\nThe mill was not cutting then, owing to the extreme cold. The men were there loading their sleighs with lumber for the churches which were being erected in each village.\n\nI made my bed on the big bench, which was eight feet wide and about fifty feet long. The men slept at the far end. The Padre was complaining that we had no wash-basin, and before he \"turned in\" told me we were like a German couple he heard about. They were giving evidence in a trial, and the man was asked by the lawyer:\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"I am dirty.\"\n\n\"And what is your wife?\"\n\n\"My wife is dirty-two.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you are a very nasty couple, and I wish to have nothing further to say to either of you.\"\n\nShortly after I lay down, the Boss awoke me to say he had a bed made for us in his house, but I declined with thanks. Why should I bestir myself? A warrior taking her rest with her fur coat wrapped around her! Soft rugs, softer cushions, a leaping fire! How nice it was to be warm and sleepy.\n\nIt was four o'clock when I awoke. The men were talking. They talk always; that is unless they are putting wood on the fire, and, generally, they do both together.\n\nI slipped on my moccasins, mittens, and cap, and stole out into the night.\n\nRabbits and prairie chickens were gambolling about the yard in a risky, frisky fashion. The Dukhobors do not take life, and so these furtive wood-folk have become domesticated.\n\nI saw a light in a building. It was a building about a hundred feet long, and was quaintly ornamented like the others. I was curious. I peeped in. It was the stable. I opened the door, and slipped in. A lantern was suspended in the middle of it. How warm and clean it was! The carefully groomed hides of the horses shone like satin in the half-light. They are big, solid, careful-looking animals. The Dukhobors have the best horses in the country, and take great care of them, sometimes killing them with kindness–another name for overfeeding. In the villages it is the custom to keep a fire in the stable where all the horses are stalled, and they are fed at night as well as day.\n\nOutside, the spruce trees stood up tall and stiff, like sentinel grenadiers. The sky was bright with stars. Alone in this great vastness one begins to doubt–even so frivolous a one as I–whether, after all, you are a little lower than the angels. You are possessed with a yearning to be nobler than you hold yourself to be. It is given you to hear \"the still, small voice.\" Life, with its hurry and fever dreams, falls away, and you feel it is not possible the world can harm you.\n\nI did not wake again till after eight o'clock. It was a man turning a grindstone that awoke me. He said something in Russian. \"Good morning,\" I suppose; \"have you slept well?\" But there was no thread of language relation between us. We were both human, that was all, and so we both smiled.\n\nAfter breakfast, the Boss, who spoke a little English, took me to see the sights–the cook's camp, with its huge, clay oven and brick stove, the eating camp, the engine room, the blacksmith's shop, and his own quarters. I was sorry I had not accepted his offer of a bed. He had prepared one for us in a tiny room with a tiny stove and such furniture. The cupboard was of curious design and painted in vivid red and blue. The legs of the bench, too, combined art with utility, and there was a Russian chair which I coveted. Canadian manufacturers might aptly copy it.\n\n\"After all,\" said Richard Le Gallienne, \"if one has anything to say, one might as well put it in a chair.\"\n\nI was much interested in the bath-house. Every village has one. It has two apartments. In the first is a huge copper to heat the water. It is similar to the English household coppers, only larger. The second room contains a heap of stones under which is an aperture for fire. When these stones are heated, hot water is thrown on them, and the result is a cloud of steam that will wash away everything but original sin, and I am not so sure about even this. Tiers of benches are built up the walls, giving the apartment somewhat the appearance of a hospital theatre. The walls are mud-plastered. The plaster is laid on laths, which are arranged in diamond shape instead of horizontally.\n\nI have heard people talk about \"the dirty Dukhobors,\" but it is only the large cities in Canada that have public baths. Of course it has been argued that, as we all sprung from clay-mould, dirt, mud, garden-soil, or a compost of the same sort, it is the base impudence of pride to try to rub or scrub away the original clod. The most natural man is the dirtiest man, and there is really some holiness in what is illogically called filth. Besides, St. Jerome, one of the Fathers of the Church, said \"I entirely forbid a young lady to bathe.\"\n\nIn old times, saints used to soothe their bodies by prayer and fasting. The Dukhobor method is by prayer and bathing.\n\nIn the summer, I am told both sexes bathe out of doors, just as they came into the world. This is not because of wickedness, but by reason of their morality and simplicity. After all, it is doubtless true that morality is a matter of geography, of religion, of circumstances.\n\nThe Padre took me to see his hay, which is here awaiting transportation to the limit. The Dukhobors have the contract of hauling it in. They are steady workers, but very slow. It does not pay to hire them except by contract.\n\nSome few of them, too, are given to small duplicities, just the same as Canadians. I must always watch Simon, or he will cut the stove wood too long. He has a way, also, of piling it so that three-quarters of a cord will measure a whole cord.\n\nThen there is Nikolai; we frequently recover a rope, a decking-chain, or an axe from among his \"belongings.\" And one day, at the beginning of the winter, I had two boys cleaning the stoves. I was going out, and paid them. The liquid had not yet dried, nevertheless they at once decamped without giving the stove a single rub.\n\nNow, these are only exceptions, and do not prove that all these people are dishonest. On the contrary, we have found them, as a whole, scrupulously honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe merest midge of a boy helped me into my wraps preparatory for the final stage of our journey. The Padre thought he would say something very absurd, so he asked the boy if he were married. Judge of our amazement when he owned up to being a father. He did not look over fourteen, but he was seventeen, and had been married a year. His wife is sixteen. You see we did not know how very, very old he felt. I told him Canadian boys were too poor to marry early, but he said:\n\n\"Me live my fader.\"\n\nMan has been defined as a woman-caressing animal, and the definition is so absolutely correct that it is beyond controversy. This being the case, there is a deal to be said in favour of a system that permits early marriages without the fear of poverty. Immorality is wholly unknown among this people.\n\nThe marriage service, as this youth explained it to me, is not complicated, being wholly without the benefit of bell, book, or candle. The couple simply make a declaration before their elders, respective families, and often the assembled village. These marriages are duly recorded in the registrar's office, although friction arose over this matter shortly after the colony was made.\n\nI do not know if the marriages are based on love as defined by the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"–\"the principle of sympathetic and pleasurable attraction in thinking and feeling beings.\" But, after all, it does not make much difference. Selection has not so much to do with happiness in marriage, as the recognition of the necessity for adaptation.\n\nThe Dukhobor woman is a housewife. She does not believe that her home is a jail, and that her babies are the turnkeys. Like Solomon's \"virtuous woman,\" she \"seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.\"\n\nOn the other hand, she is a housewife only. She is not expected, as our women are, to be a combination of Mary, Martha, Magdalen, Bridget, and the Queen of Sheba.\n\nXI\n\nPOLAR PENCILLINGS\n\n\"Do you know the blackened timber–do you know that racing stream\n\nWith the raw right-angled log-jam at the end?\"\n\n–KIPLING.\n\nHE Padre wrapped me up snugly for the journey. I was the first woman–white, black, or red–to traverse this part of Canada, and he was anxious that I should establish a good precedent.\n\nOur road, for the first mile or so, ran through the Dukhobor timber. The dark spruces looked especially funereal with their streamers of Tillandsia, better known as \"hanging moss.\" The scene was only brightened by the silver-barked, lichen-blotched poplars.\n\nLying mummied in my blankets, I looked up into the twisty twigs of the filigree under which we were passing, \"bare, ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.\" At long intervals I espied a nest in some gaunt tree. It only added to the loneliness of our way, for:\n\n\"There is no sadness in the world,\n\nNo other like it here or there–\n\nThe sadness of deserted homes\n\nIn nests or hearts or anywhere.\"\n\nAfter two hours' travel, we found ourselves surrounded by a ghostly and ghastly company of burnt trees. We hear much mawkish sentiment in these days about the felling of trees, but when one passes through such a territory as this, it seems as though the shame lay in leaving the trees so long unused. All this by-product might have gone to support, if not enrich, thousands of needy homes. Here is a land that has lain idle and unproductive since the world has known it, and bids fair so to continue to the end of time.\n\nI wore three pairs of stockings and moccasins of moose hide that were lashed on with leather thongs; yet my feet were cold–freezing. Cold feet will spoil any amount of ideal enjoyment. The Padre tried to light the lantern that I might use it as a foot-warmer, but the oil had frozen, and the wick refused to ignite.\n\nHe was relentless. I had to get out, then and there, and walk. With all my clothes I was as helpless as a medieval knight in armour. It is hard to walk in the woods for the steps are uneven, and the sharp, freshly-cut roots hurt one's feet cruelly. The horses walked more quickly than I did. I was getting wrathier every minute–because the Padre wouldn't wait–and consequently warmer. Madame de Staël was right: travelling is one of the sad pleasures of life.\n\nWe didn't speak for quite an hour after that. I decided to be hateful all the way. I could have bit his head off, but I suddenly forgot all about it with the sheer joy of seeing one of my own blue streamers fluttering on a moose-willow.\n\nIt was this way: this road, which can only be traversed in winter, is but three months old. The line for it was struck by one Andrew, an Indian. He and a party of \"breeds\" cut the road out of what has hitherto been a howling wilderness of burnt timber, scrub, and muskegs. A gang of Dukhobors followed and cleaned up the work. Once more Andrew passed over it to blaze the trees and to tie streamers in muskegs where the first fall of snow would surely obliterate parts of the trail.\n\nAndrew is the most intelligent Indian in all this country. He has risen above the blanket caste. He helped me to prepare these streamers. He said they should be all red, but I resisted, and had them of red, white, and blue.\n\nAndrew says he never gets lost in the woods. He always selects a high object far ahead in the direction he wishes to go, and travels towards it. The lack of this precaution is why men who are lost in the forest travel in a circle.\n\nNothing could be more appalling than these muskegs. They are cursed with a curse. Early in the season, before they were frozen hard, the teams would shake the earth for twenty-five feet around. In the summer they would swallow a form almost as light as a bird's. There are miles and miles of them–\"aching leagues of solitude,\" with madness in the heart of them. Once get fifty yards off the trail, and the chances are you are lost for ever. The scene is a picture of desolation without sublimity and barrenness without relief. No need to spy out the nakedness of the land; it is thrust upon you at every turn. It is a land bitter, raw, and utterly worthless. A hundred miles of it is not worth an old glove. It is under the Isaian malediction: \"I shall lay it waste, and it shall not be pruned or digged.\"\n\nIt is not until you go to the unfenced territories that you realise the place of the fence in the eastern provinces. The territories are beautiful in spots, but, as the story-book reviewers are wont to say, the interest is not sustained throughout.\n\nOur clergyman tells me that his uncle was literally absorbed by one of these muskegs. Months afterwards, the dead man's brother found his gun in the place where he had sunk. He stuck the barrel of the rifle into the bog and left it standing there–a grim monument to one who had been an intrepid pathfinder.\n\nThe musk-rats fairly swarm in these muskegs. This is why they survive. They live where man would die. We passed several colonies of them. They look like small beavers, except that their tails are flattened from side to side. The female produces three or four litters of seven or eight every year.\n\nAn ermine crossed our trail, too. It covered the ground in a series of short, quick leaps, leaving claw tracks like a bird's. The ermine, or stoat, is a bloodthirsty little villain. He eats musk-rats, rabbits, and partridges. The trappers, it is reported, catch him by putting a smear of grease on a piece of iron. He puts his tongue to it, and, lo! the frosted iron holds him fast–not the first of creatures to be taken by the unruly member.\n\nThere is a story some preachers tell illustrative of purity. They say that if mud be placed around the ermine's nest he will die rather than soil his coat by crossing it, and so is trapped. I used to think this quite a pretty story, but since I have seen the ermine's habitat I know how utterly impossible it is. Supposing you could get clay and water here, it would freeze solid before you could spread it out.\n\nThe Padre keeps a paper of pin-facts to prick my bubbles of illusions, and he replied:\n\n\"Women are so illogical. Summer does come once a year. Doesn't it?\"\n\nI confess to being wholly confounded till I remembered that the ermine's coat turns grey in the summer, and he is never trapped then.\n\nNow I make it a daily–indeed, an hourly–habit to treat the Padre as if he were in the right, and so I did not say anything. He would not change his opinion anyway, and I score heavily every time by giving him either his due or a compliment. A man likes to be head and shoulders in advance of his wife. He likes her to wonder at his amazing cleverness, and to brighten his spare hours with a little comfortable adulation.\n\nWe crossed several high, narrow ridges. They reminded me of the earthworks at Fort George, Niagara-on-the-Lake, which were thrown up in the war of 1812. The Padre told me we were crossing beaver dams and meadows, and that these wonderful rodents fairly swarmed here. The Indians consider the flesh of the beaver a great delicacy. In Germany, too, where beavers are very rare, it is esteemed highly, and the tail is always sent to the Emperor's table. While the Indians delight in the beaver's flesh they have a poor idea of its brains.\n\n\"Beaver big fool,\" they say; \"work all time same as white man.\"\n\nIn every direction we saw the cleft hoof-prints of moose. In some places several had passed over the snow. I should judge there are many hundreds of them in this north country.\n\nTowards evening we came into heavier timber again, chiefly poplar, with here and there a jack-pine. Our trail seemed to \"fairly dawdle.\" We are in \"the desert and illimitable air; lone, wandering, but not lost.\"\n\nIt is easy at night to people the forest with weird beings–buskined nymphs, nixes, dwarfs, demons, dryads, fawns, witches, ghosts, and even Pan and all his merry rout. Indeed, you see moving, shadowy forms wherever you look. The dark languor of the wood and the soft depths of gloom have an air of mystery. The trees seem to reach out their arms for you to come and be at rest. Perhaps it is the delirious glamour of your own mood, for some say we see nature through temperament.\n\nIn the Black Forest there were, and, perhaps, still are, little wood-wives or moss-folk. Keightley tells of them in his \"Fairy Mythology.\" He says they are of the stature of three-year-old children, but grey and old-looking, and covered with moss. The women are of more amiable temper than the men, who live further back in the woods.\n\nThese are the kindly fairies who help people with their haymaking, churning, and cooking, and when you do them a favour they give you a ball of yarn that is never ended, or chips that turn to yellow gold. The cruel Wild Huntsman kills these little wood-women, but if the good wood-cutter make three crosses on his stump, they sit in the midst of these and are safe from their wicked enemy.\n\nIt is not strange that the northern imagination invested the forests with awe as the haunts of Odin and Thor, and that the Teutons should make them the home of the Erl King and his elfin court. But groves in every land were the first temples. \"The word templum,\" writes Grimm, \"also means wood.\" This is, perhaps, why \"Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.\"\n\nAll day we had heard at intervals the yelps of brawling timber-wolves, but at night the packs were in full cry. I think they were baying the moon, as do their cultured relatives the dogs.\n\nThoreau says the moon is where dogs go when they die, and when they bay the moon, they are calling to the White Pack that they are coming soon.\n\nOnce, as a child, I heard an old pioneer tell about the wolf-demons and how they cried at night around his house, and I shivered with terror. It seemed an experience so dreadful as to be almost unthinkable. Now, in the reality, I was not in the least uneasy. Perhaps it was because an awful weariness had settled down on me. I had spent nine hours in the open sleigh with the temperature 50° below zero. The tension of the air had made a large draught on my vitality, and I felt I must sleep.\n\n\"This is our log-road, and these are all your own trees–miles of them. Look up, sweetheart!\"\n\nI opened the corner of one eye long enough to see we had entered a forest of towering, spear-headed spruces, but although I have come half across the continent to view these very trees, I cannot bear to look at them.\n\nWhy does the Padre shake me like that? He is hateful. And now my teeth are chattering like–I am too sleepy to think of the word, but it is the name of something the corner-man clatters in the minstrel show.\n\nI try to drink some brandy-wine the Padre gives me, but my lips freeze on the metal of the flask.\n\n\"Castanets!\" Yes, that is the word I want!\n\nOnly a few twists more in the road till I hear voices, and, quicker than I can tell it, two lumber-jacks have me out of the sleigh and into a wide, low cabin that is bright and warm, where there is an odour of fresh, wheaten bread, and where a man moves among pots and pans with the air of one conducting a religious ceremony.\n\nXII\n\nIN CAMP\n\n\"The God of Fair Beginnings\n\nHath prospered here my hand.\"\n\n–KIPLING.\n\nSLEPT the sleep of the well-fed and woke up twice as good as new. The sunlight poured in through a sash of window-panes that ran across one side of the room. There were rows of shelves with granite-ware, jam pots, pickle pails, and mysterious jars. There were strings of red-skinned onions, too. Hams and bacon hung pendent from the heavy rafters, and a line of dish towels and clean shirts behind the range suggested something of the modern cosy, or uncosy, corner. Two long tables covered with white oilcloth were at the far end of the room. The staunch furniture was so eminently useful, and at the same time so execrably ugly, that it could not have failed to delight the Roycrofters. The logs of which the house was built were chinked with moss, so that I had been actually sleeping in a moss-lined nest.\n\nNext to a marble mansion, there is nothing comparable to a log house. Think of the royal extravagance of it. The trees in this cooking camp would supply inch boards, scantlings and laths for several town houses. The \"desirable city residence\" is thin–dreadfully thin–and accordingly susceptible to heat and cold. It is stiff, angular, ugly within and uglier without, but this nest of logs in the northern wilds has a motherly suggestion about it that is irresistible. Nature may bring all her big guns to bear upon it, but without avail. To the earlier and later rains it is impervious. To the frost and wind it says, \"Thus far.\" To the lightnings, \"Do your worst; what care I for a surface scald, or a mere splinter here and there?\"\n\nAlbert laughed mightily when I inquired if it were breakfast time yet.\n\n\"Lor', ma'am, the men had breakfast four hours ago, and they ate right at that table. And to think you didn't hear them!\"\n\nAlbert is the cook. He gave me his bunk last night and betook himself to the sleeping camp, which bears also the opprobrious name of \"the doggery.\"\n\nI sat up. The cookee, a chipper little Dane with a walk between a run and a stumble, brought me a big bowl of steaming broth, and bread. I began to think of Silverlocks in the woods, the big bears, and the soup. I pinched myself like the old woman in the nursery rhyme, and said, \"This is surely none of I.\"\n\nThe soup was highly seasoned. It was sweet, satisfying, and sustaining. The Cap of Fortune could grant no more.\n\nOutside the air was full of sunshine, but it was the kind of sunshine that hurt your eyes without in the least warming you.\n\nThe Padre was nowhere to be found. I got my saddle out of the sleigh and proceeded to adjust it to a bronco that belonged to the foreman. She had a calico-coloured hide, and a bad, red eye. Her ribs were flat, her hips cat-hammed, and her tail looked like a used-up shaving-brush. Her nose, too, was sufficiently pronounced to declare the most stubborn propensities.\n\nI have heard the back of a bronco spoken of in the West as \"the hurricane deck of a cayuse.\" The expression is inspired. It cannot be improved upon.\n\nIt is said that a horse, at its best, is an amiable idiot; at its worst, a dangerous maniac. The bronco combines these traits at once. It makes no difference that it has reached the years of discretion, for the discretion never arrives with the years. Indeed, the word \"bronco\" is Spanish for \"wild.\"\n\nI did not know this particular \"bronc,\" and while tightening the girths was all the while remembering a proverb which says, \"He that would venture nothing must not get on horseback.\"\n\nProverbs are unsatisfactory. If you accept any particular one as a guide, it will not fit all circumstances. It is best to adjust the proverb to the circumstance. That is why I swung off to the one which says, \"Nothing venture, nothing win.\"\n\nPerhaps Miss Bronco did not like the way I rode. The foreman rides along like the armour-clad knights of old–that is, with legs straight down like tongs in the fender.\n\nShe curved her back up in the middle like a one-humped camel, plunged down behind and reared in front, at the same time keeping her legs as stiff as stilts. She appeared to be three parts rubber and the rest iron. I was not exactly prepared for this impromptu rough-riding, or what the Padre would probably describe as my \"pyrotechnic repertory of feats,\" and so my hair fell down my back and in my face, thus adding vastly to my confusion.\n\nI tried to hold my aplomb between forces centripetal and centrifugal, but—\n\nWhen my own horse \"bucks\" I hit him hard between the ears with the butt of my whip. It has the settling effect of a nursery \"spank.\" I tried it on this flying bunch of sinews, and before I knew what had happened I had once more illustrated the laws of gravitation and dynamics. Fortunately, we had backed into comparatively soft snow, and I was only hurt enough to be indignant.\n\nYes, I would do it; else where is the use of belonging to the pick of the Scots who fought their way to Canada by the north of Ireland? Besides, I was a thousand miles from a Red Cross Society, or a Society for the Prevention, etc., etc., \"and there's never a law of man or God runs north of 53°.\" I would do it deliberately and thoroughly. I would endeavour to teach her ladyship that my principal object in mounting was to stay there at my convenience.\n\nI took time to regather my hairpins and re-arrange my hair. I secured a stout rope halter, and tied her Roman nose close to a tree. I procured a long whip with a rawhide lash, and had only cut her once or twice when I found myself whipping her, \"whaling\" her, \"basting\" her, with all the fury of a woman scorned. I lathered her with all my might, and she kicked with all her main.\n\nThe cookee ran out and stood wringing his hands in an ecstasy of woe.\n\n\"She keel you,\" he wailed. \"I know she weel. The Padre, he keel me. He keel me dade.\"\n\nHow the itch to fight lies close under the skin of every woman with Irish blood! I wanted to turn on the cookee too, but wisely confined myself to mine enemy. I whipped her again and again with all the vindictive menace of my soul, and until I was entirely satisfied that the punishment fitted the crime.\n\nThen the cookee helped me into the saddle and unloosed her halter, but that lump of Western wickedness refused to budge herself one inch. The blacksmith had come out of his camp, and he led her off by the head till she started of her own accord.\n\nIt was an ignominious defeat, but she did not, however, try to unseat me again. As matters stand, I am afraid of that mare, but I have doubts as to the feeling being reciprocated. I also have emphatic orders to desist from further attempts to ride her. \"She is not broken to skirts,\" I am informed. Her name is \"Dinah\"–short for dynamite, I suppose.\n\nThere is a marvellous stillness in a spruce forest. There is no rustling in the branches. No breath of wind is muttered or unexpressed through the close-matted jungle of big trees and little trees. The needles on the conifers all point upwards. If they leaned out of the perpendicular they would not be able to resist the weight of snow which lies in broad masses like white quartz on the branches, bending them in exquisite curves.\n\nThis aerial electricity must have wonderful curative properties for certain disorders, and I wonder that physicians do not more often advise for nerve-shaken, over-civilised people a sojourn in these regions. Here, too, you may weave a bit of poetry into the warp of your days. All the way one's heart is singing, \"Dark, and true and tender is the north.\"\n\nIt is a great pleasure to a city woman when she is able to discern the survey lines, and to tell by the Roman numerals from the iron post in the surveyor's mound what township, section, and range she is in. It gives her a sense of superiority over other women, and of satisfaction with herself. She may have trouble mounting her bronco again, but, likely as not, a teamster will be going campward at that very moment and will see her once more safely on the \"hurricane deck.\"\n\nThe teamsters are called \"skinners.\" I met them all on the log road. Some I know and some are strangers, but all are polite to \"the Missus.\"\n\nThey are proud of their teams, and like to be questioned about them. I ask Frank Wark about his big greys, and he tells me they are \"game as pebbles and gritty as bulldogs.\" William York thinks his team can \"bet\" (Western for past-participle of \"beat\") any two teams on the haul, and Tibble's are \"clean grit all through.\" Every man has a similar song, except one who complained that the loader was \"no tarnal use\" and was killing the horses with big loads.\n\nThe log road was made after winter had set in, and already the snow had fallen on the thick, soft needle mould. This made the hauling heavy. It all had to be cleaned off to the ground, and fresh snow piled on to secure a hard road-bed.\n\nThe choppers, sawyers, skidders, and swampers had lit a fire and were having their midday lunch. They invited me to join. True, they had no dietetical elegancies–only fried pork, bread, butter, tea, and syrup, but my appetite was keen enough to be generously uncritical. I imbibed unknown quantities of tea. The men called the sugar and milk \"the trimmings.\" The condensed milk, considered separately, is correctly known as \"tin cow.\" The food was good, and I ate and ate and was glad that nature had endowed me with so marvellous an appetite and such a well-balanced capability of digestion.\n\nI get transcendent delight from eating. There are some very excellent people who stigmatise the delights we get from the senses as unseemly and vulgar. This is a mistake which even the Romans made. They portrayed the beautiful goddess Voluptas as having Virtue under her feet. There is no reason why the intellect should be unduly deified by \"keeping the body under\"–no reason why the stomach and all its works should be denounced as \"a diabolic machine.\" It is true that Daniel thrived on pulse and looked fairer than those who ate the king's meat, but I have a poor opinion of such gastronomical idiosyncrasies. And, when you come to think of it, Jacob's mess of pottage is the most expensive dish on record.\n\nAn inquisitive, "
