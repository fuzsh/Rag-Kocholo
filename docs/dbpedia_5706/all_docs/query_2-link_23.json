They recorded one studio album in 1989 with help from Jones and Bartolucci which was released on Virgin Records Canada. The single and video for the song “How Many Times” gained them TV exposure on MuchMusic, YTV and other network programs like CBC-TV’s ‘Good Rockin’ Tonight’. The band toured briefly and released the album’s title track, “Safety Zone,” as the follow-up single. It did not chart. After GNP ended Gilmour and Negus returned to Saga while Robbie Rae and Rino Lista continued performing the Toronto club scene with The Robbie Rae Band. Later, Rae moved to Thailand to open his own bar and survived the Indonesian Tsunami on December 26, 2005 but later died in Pukhet, Thailand in 2006 after a short illness. with notes from Ursula Lott and Don Palmer.

They moved to England where Gabor did everything under the sun to make ends meet including driving taxis, radio work, and brokering on the London Metal Exchange. Music didn’t really enter into his world until he moved to Canada at age 23. Gabor played the Toronto suburban pub scene before his Instaband was discovered at Queen Street circuit establishment Grossman’s Tavern. His self-titled debut was released on Anthem in 1980 and was co-produced by Terry Brown. With two well played radio singles, “Soviet Jewellery” and “Metropolitan Life”, Gabor crossed Canada twice with touring, garnered a JUNO Award nomination, won a CFNY U-know Award, and was voted as best new artist in Music Express magazine’s readers poll. His instant fame led him to begin working with others including production of Jimi Bertucci’s solo material in 1980. The second album, 1981’s ‘Girls of the Future’ was co-produced with Eugene Martynec and featured the single “Jealous Girls”, a cover version of The Extras’ classic from the same year. After being let go by Anthem in the mid-80’s, Gabor saw his career flounder in fits and starts including The Extras returning the favour for the “Jealous Girls” exposure by getting Gabor and Paul DeVilliers to produce “Fever Fire” on their ‘The Watcher’ EP. Gabor then relocated to British Columbia from Toronto in 1984 to be closer to his son. In 1986 he worked on sessions with Todd Rundgren featuring Ken Bassman (guitar), Ted Quinlan (guitar), Mike Lent (bass), Don Powery (drums) and Andre Grigoriev (percussion). But Gabor’s behavior was so erratic that the album was never completed. In 1987 he assembled a new band: keyboardist Phil Dwyer (VEJI), keyboardist David Stone (Richie Blackmore’s Rainbow), drummer Tony Toly, guitarist Kim Keyser, bassist Tom Christianson and an Afghanistan percussionist known simply as Mr. X (an alias for Grigoriev). He also reactivated his publishing company Equalised Music and continued producing other acts like Toronto’s Ron Hedland. On January 17, 1990 Gabor’s body was found by police at his Toronto apartment where coroners ruled the cause of death as a suicide. with notes from Denis Keldie, Leon Stevenson, and Adrianne Binet.

The group opened shows for Fludd and other visiting acts and were once mistaken for McKenna-Mendelson Mainline. Having only recorded a couple of rehearsal tapes during their original run, (1969-1971), these long lost tapes were re-discovered by Chuck Gadsby nearly 25 years later, which inspired the band to re-record this set of original material, (plus a cover of Blue Cheer’s “Just A Little Bit”), from that period. On a recommendation by the British music reviewer and chronologist, Colin Hill, Skol went to see England’s premier psychedelic band The Bevis Frond at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto, in 1999. After their set, Rick met the band, and gave guitarist-singer-songwriter, Nick Saloman, the latest recording. Nick Saloman was blown away, and the self titled, ‘Gadsby & Skol’ CD was released on England’s “Woronzow Records” label in 2001.

In 1961 he went to Paris, France on a Province of Quebéc grant. In 1962 he returned to Canada and worked as accompanist to Monique Leyrac and Claude Levéillée until 1969. Following this, Gagnon went solo, and traveled to England where he recorded with the London Baroque Orchestra. From there he skipped over to Germany to work with the Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra. Known specifically as a classical musician for the majority of his early career, Gagnon decided to delve into contemporary pop with 1976’s ‘Neiges’ which proved he had a knack for melody within short compositions. The album won him a JUNO Award. He also managed success in the US despite the language barrier because the majority of his commercial works have been instrumental pieces; Gagnon died December 3, 2020.\n\nSingles\n\n1968 Don’t Ask

(bass) / Ray McAndrew (drums) / Tim McHugh (keyboards)\n\nFormed in late 1964 in Calgary, Alberta as The Skeptics. Dennis Paul (Planidin), who had been with Wes Dakus & The Rebels, and Mel Degan (ex-Privilege) had migrated from Edmonton to join what became The Gainsborough Gallery which had been christened by keyboardist Tim McHugh after Calgary’s Gainsborough (Art) Gallery where the group had their fan mail re-directed for pick up. The group had done their first recordings at Porter’s recording studio in Las Vegas, Nevada which was located beside a railroad line where sessions were often interrupted to break for passing trains. Those sessions became the basis for two failed singles on Apex Records entitled “My Little Red Book” and “If You Knew”. Undaunted, Paul suggested they try again at Norman Petty Studios in Clovis, New Mexico where he had recorded with Wes Dakus and The Rebels previously. In 1969 they traveled to New Mexico to record a full length album. The first single lifted from the sessions, “Life Is A Song’ – written by George Tomsco of The Fireballs, was released on Petty’s Evolution label in December 1969 stateside and on REO Records in Canada. The song would to be their biggest hit, peaking at No.54 on January 24, 1970 with a modest 10 weeks on the charts. Degan briefly left the band to rejoin Privilege and was replaced by Henry Small following the release of the album but soon returned. A non-album track, “Ev’ry Man Hears Different Music”, was released next and had a nine week run at the charts, peaking at No.78 on April 11, 1970. Frustrated by their lack of success, they disbanded after their contract expired. Their last performance together was opening for Lighthouse at Calgary’s Jubilee Auditorium in March 1971. McHugh is still involved with music and producing in Vancouver, BC.; Henry Small joined Canadian groups Scrubbaloe Caine, Small Wonder and Prism; Marley, McAndrew and Degan are still in the music industry and reside in Calgary; Dennis Paul is a financial consultant in Arizona; Mack now lives in Tennessee. with notes from Shawn Nagy via Dennis Planidin & Peter Marley.

At the age of three her mother had her join her sisters to sing at fairs and on radio and TV as The Gallant Sisters. The family would move to Montréal when Gallant was 10. Gallant went solo in 1967 and released an independent single that led to TV appearances such as ‘Music Hop’, ‘Discotheque’, and ‘Smash’. Later, she performed at the Place de Arts in Montréal with Charles Aznavour followed by a stint on the CBC with her own weekly variety show. By 1969 she’d hooked up with songwriter Yves Lapierre who introduced her to commercial jingle work for such clients as Ford Motors, Air Canada, Coke and McDonald’s. Through her jingle connections she met her future manager and co-producer Ian Robertson. From there she began working on theme songs for such movies as ‘Theme From L’initiation’ and ‘Theme From Ya Pas e Trou a Perce’. She is fluent in French and English and recorded in both languages with her English debut being 1972’s ‘Upon My Own’ which spawned the single “Get That Ball”. Gallant recorded her 1973 Columbia Records album ‘Power’ in Nashville in hopes of cracking the US market which would elude her at this time. It would take four more years to reap the rewards of success with the English single “Are You Ready For Love” in 1977. Simultaneously, she recorded her French debut – ‘Besoin D’Amour’ – which spawned three hit singles including the French version of “Sugar Daddy”. Three JUNO Awards would soon follow between 1976 (‘Best Female Vocalist’) and 1977 (‘Best Female Vocalist’ and ‘Single of the Year’ for “Sugar Daddy”). Her next English hit was the disco rave “From New York to LA” which was originally the French hit ‘Mon Pays C’est L’Hiver’ written by Gilles Vigneault. She then hosted her own disco-variety show on CTV called ‘The Patsy Gallant Show’. In 1993 she played the lead role in the French version of a biographical play about Edith Piaf. Gallant currently stars in the 5 year run of the Paris, France production of ‘Starmania’.

He was taught how to play fiddle by veterans in his hometown of Swift Current. By the age of 9 he was playing town dances and by the age of 13 he had appeared on CHWC Radio in Regina, SK. Formal training came later at the hands of W. Knight Wilson, Gregori Garbovitsky and Jack Thornicroft. He formed Sons of the West in Edmonton in 1942 and they performed on CBC Radio’s ‘Alberta Ranch House.’ They also won the 1950 ‘Pacific National Exhibition World Open Western Band Competition’ in Vancouver. The notoriety turned into a recording contract with RCA-Victor Records in 1951. He recorded his debut single “Ridin’ The Fiddle” at RCA Studios in Montreal where producer Hugh Joseph gave him the name “King Ganam” as in ‘Canada’s King of the Fiddle’. Ganam and His Sons of the West toured extensively through Canada. Ganam made featured appearances at Mart Kenny’s Ranch and after moving to Toronto in 1952 made appearances in concert at Casa Loma and became regular performers on CBC TV’s ‘Holiday Ranch’ show. Ganam had his own CBC radio show in 1954-1955. He would appear on CBC TV’s ‘Country Hoedown with Gordie Tapp and a studio version of the Sons of the West that included Tommy Hunter from 1956 thru 1959. In 1956, it’s reported that his fan club had well over 1,000 members. He eventually starred in his own CTV series ‘The King Ganam Show’ in 1961. He moved to Carlsbad, California in 1962 but would often return to Canada to perform. Ganam was one of the first artists inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1990, he received the Saskatchewan Country Music Association Legend and Legacy Award; Ganam died in Carlsbad, California at the age of 79 in 1994.\n\nSingles\n\n1951 Ridin’ the Fiddle/First Last & Always (RCA Victor) 57-5039\n\n1954 Speed The Plough Reel/The Maritime Polka (RCA Victor) 57-5094\n\n1954 Orange Blossom Special (RCA Victor) 57-5096\n\n1954 Holiday Waltz/Kitty O’Neil Jig (RCA Victor) 57-5113\n\n1956 The Shelburne Reel/The Tipsy Sailor Jig (RCA Victor) 57-3248\n\n1956 You’ll Never Be Satisfied/Banjo Polka (RCA Victor) 57-3243\n\n1958 Island Breakdown/Forever In My Heart (RCA Victor) 57-3294\n\n1958 Marilyn Bell Reel/Farmer’s Schottische (RCA Victor) 57-3303\n\n1958 Hot Canary/Cactus Blossoms (RCA Victor) 57-3308\n\n1958 Black Mountain Rag/Happy Times Schottische (RCA Victor) 57-3310\n\nas KING GANAM & HIS SONS OF THE WEST\n\n1951 Ridin’ The Fiddle/Kiley’s Reel (RCA Victor – US) 47-5870\n\n1951 Albert Stomp/Kiley’s Reel (RCA Victor) 57-5049\n\n1953 Four String Polka/Among the Flowers (RCA Victor) 57-5056\n\n1953 Tomahawk Stomp/Western Reel Medley (RCA Victor) 57-5061\n\n1953 Many Tears Apart/King Ganam’s Special (RCA Victor) 57-5076\n\n1954 The Maritime Polka/Speed The Plough Reel [10″] (RCA Victor) 55-3300\n\n1954 Orange Blossom Special/Somebody’s Rose [10″] (RCA Victor) 55-3302\n\n1954 Hot Canary/ Cactus Blossoms [10″] (RCA Victor) 55-3308\n\n1954 Fraser Valley Breakdown/Casa Loma Hornpipe (RCA Victor) 57-5083\n\n1954 May You Never See Sunshine Again/Champagne Polka (RCA Victor) 57-5085\n\n1954 Ridin’ Ole Paint, Leadin’ Ole Ball/Dalhousie Hornpipe (RCA Victor) 57-5092\n\n1955 The Tipsy Sailor Jig/The Shelburne Reel [10″] (RCA Victor) 56-3248\n\n1956 Carefree Heart/Sweet Georgia Brown (RCA Victor) 57-3257\n\n1957 Rippling Water Jig/Rocket Reel (RCA Victor) 57-3260\n\n1957 Arkansas Traveler/Josh King’s Country Breakdown (RCA Victor) 57-3271\n\n1957 Dick McDougall’s Reel/Oompah Rag (RCA Victor) 57-3279\n\nas KING GANAM & HIS SONS OF THE WEST Featuring TOMMY HUNTER\n\n1957 Teenage Love Is A Losing Game/I Don’t Care (RCA Victor) 57-3278\n\nAlbums\n\n1951 King Of The Fiddle (RCA Camden) CALS-969\n\n1952 Square Dances (RCA Camden) CALS-2131\n\n1953 Ridin’ the Fiddle (RCA Camden) CAL-2207\n\n1954 Reels and Rags (RCA Camden) CAL-2250\n\nas KING GANAM & HIS SONS OF THE WEST\n\n1951 Ridin’ The Fiddle With… [10”] (RCA Victor) LCP-3009\n\nwith AL CHERNY, KING GANAM, NED LANDRY\n\n1971 Best Of The Country Fiddlers (RCA Camden) CAS-2450\n\n1973 Best Of The Country Fiddlers Vol. II (Pickwick/RCA) KCL1-7004\n\nGANDHARVAS, The\n\nPaul Jago (vocals) / Jud Ruhl (guitar) / Brian Ward (guitar) / Tim McDonald (drums) / Eric Howden (bass) / Beau Cook (bass)\n\nFrom London, Ontario; Howden would go on to join Raised By Swans; Ruhl joined The New Kings;\n\nSingles\n\n1994 The Coffee Song [3 mixes] (Watch) WMDS-9467\n\n1995 The First Day of Spring\n\n1997 Watching The Girl (Watch) WMDS-97186\n\n1998 Downtime (Radio Version)/Downtime (Album Version) (Watch/MCA) MCA5P-4154\n\nAlbums\n\n1994 A Soap Bubble and Inertia (Watch) WMD-89303\n\n1995 Kicking in the Water (Watch) WMSD-89505\n\n1995 Sold for a Smile (Watch/MCA/Universal) WMSD-89709\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1994 “Forgiveness” on ‘CHRW London Underground II Dig Deeper’ (CHRW)\n\n1995 “Held to the Ground” on ‘This One’s Worth Saving’ (MCA) MCAD-9562\n\n1995 “The First Day of Spring” on ‘Absolute 90’s (MCA) MCASD-81008\n\n1995 “Drool” on ‘Music For The Needy…A Compilation’ (independent)\n\nGARBAGEMEN, The\n\nHoward ‘Zephyr’ Szafer (bass) / Howie Moscovitch (guitar) / Ron Weiseman (keys) / Glenn Milchem (drums) / Ben Cleveland Hayes (drums)\n\nToronto’s Queen Street circuit mainstays The Garbagemen were formed in 1985 as a pick-up agro-punk/sex-funk outfit with a heavy political agenda. Though they moved around from bar to bar, their home was invariably the Cameron House. A well-received 1986 cassette paved the way for a live set from the Cameron in 1987 called ‘Take It Away’. Drummer Glenn Milchem left the band following the release due to heavier commitments with his three other bands: Vital Sines, Whitenoise and Groovy Religion. He would later quit all those acts and team up with former Coney Hatch bassist in Soho ’69 before hitting the big time as Howard French’s replacement in Blue Rodeo.\n\nAlbums\n\n1986 Garbagemen [cassette] (Craps)\n\n1987 Take It Away (Craps) TFM-01\n\n1989 8 Rough Mixes Of 16 Beds [cassette]\n\nGARDINER, Dick\n\nBorn on Grey Island, White Bay, Newfoundland.\n\nSingles\n\n1981 I’ll Be Home For Christmas Rose Marie/Santa Helped Me Cut A Christmas Tree (Quay/Clode Sound) CS-8102\n\n1985 Glenda/I Still Love You (APS) APS-7100\n\nAlbums\n\n1979 Where The Churchill River Flows (Quay/Clode Sound) CS-7930\n\n1980 Headin’ Back To Newfie (Quay/Clode Sound) CS-8004\n\n1983 A Star For Mary (Quay/Clode Sound) CS-8097\n\n1984 Little Girl’s Prayer (D.G.)

He would often go into seclusion – once on an island in Spain and later to a chalet in Switzerland – before returning to Canada where he formed the Garfield Band. The band began by playing university pubs. Their stage show was so extravagant and elaborate that their excessive amount of equipment made it nearly impossible to book them in small venues. In October 1976, The Garfield Band performed at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa as openers for 10CC. The English act’s record label reps were in the audience that night and took a shine to The Garfield Band. With a Mercury Records deal (through its subsidiary Capricorn) in hand, they became, simply, Garfield and released the Elliott Mazur produced ‘Strange Streets’ which spawned the hit single “Old Time Movies”. The follow-up, ‘Out There Tonight’, was less than a break-through and the band found itself being held hostage at the hands of Capricorn and it would be a full year before the band’s third album, ‘Reason To Be’, could be released (this time on Polygram). The band released four albums in total before breaking up in the early ’80’s. with notes from Matthew Jackson and Russell Craig.\n\nSingles\n\n1976 Ride The Waves/Old Time Movies (Mercury) M-73800\n\n1976 Old Time Movies/Ride The Waves (Mercury) M-73813\n\n1976 Give My Love To Anne/Nanny’s Song (Mercury) M-73845\n\n1977 All Alone Again/It’s Not That Bad (At All) (Capricorn/Polydor) 2065-377\n\n1977 Mississippi Jimmie/All Alone Again (Capricorn – US) CPS-0299\n\n1979 Buffalo to Boston/Over a Dry Martini (Capricorn/Polydor) 2065-420\n\n1981 Like I Love You/One on One (Polydor) PDS-2174\n\n1981 Got More Than You Want/High Class (Polydor) PDS-2182\n\n1980 Ride The Thunderbolt/Things I See (Irving-Almo/A & M) AI-101\n\nAlbums\n\n1976 Strange Streets (Mercury) SRM-1-1082\n\n1977 Out There Tonight (Capricorn/Polydor) 2424-167\n\n1979 Reason To Be (Capricorn/Polydor) 2424-183\n\n1981 Flights Of Fantasy (Capricorn/Polydor) 2424-225\n\nGARNETT, Gale\n\nBorn: Gale Zoë Garnett on July 17, 1942 in Auckland, New Zealand\n\nGarnett spent her first decade growing up in New Zealand before her family immigrated to Canada when she was 11. She began singing in public at the age of 18, and launched her acting career at the same time with a appearances on TV shows like ‘The Dick Powell Show’, ’77 Sunset Strip’ and ‘Bonanza’. She began appearing in night clubs starting in 1963, and was discovered by RCA Records in New York where she was signed to a recording contract. In late 1964, Garnett’s self-penned “We’ll Sing in the Sunshine”, from her debut album ‘My Kind of Folk Songs’, crossed over in several radio formats which peaked at #10 on the CHUM Chart in September 1964. It reached #1 on Billboard’s ‘Adult Contemporary Singles chart’ for seven weeks while becoming a Top 50 country hit. The song went on to win a Grammy Award for ‘Best Folk Recording’ in 1965. Garnett also found international success with records released in French that gained popularity in Quebec and France. Her second highest charting single, “Lovin’ Place,” peaked at #36 on the CHUM Chart in January 1965. At the peak of her popularity, Garnett appeared twice on ABC-TV’s music show ‘Shindig!’ and ‘The Lloyd Thaxton Show’. She continued her recording career as a singer and guitarist in the late ’60s with her backing band the Gentle Reign which featured Paul Robinson (drums), producer Dick Rosmini (guitar), Rob Fisher (bass, synthesizer), Tony Hill (guitar, percussion) and Bruce Horiuchi (organ, piano). Together they moved away from straight pop music into psychedelic influenced material after signing with Columbia Records. Pivoting to acting, Garnett appeared on the TV show ’77 Sunset Strip,’ and in the 1967 Rankin-Bass stop-motion feature film ‘Mad Monster Party’ singing “Our Time to Shine” and “Never Was a Love Like Mine.” Her music career was put aside in the 1980s and she focused more on film (‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding’, ‘Tribute’, ’32 Short Films About Glenn Gould’) and television (‘Edison Twins’, ‘King of Kensington’, ‘Littlest Hobo’, ‘E.N.G.’, ‘Kung Fu: The Legend Continues’). She has also branched out into journalism, has become a successful book author and has written and performed two one-person theatre shows.\n\nSingles\n\n1964 We’ll Sing In the Sunshine/Prism Song (RCA Victor) 47-8388\n\n1964 Lovin’ Place/I Used To Live Here (RCA Victor) 47-8472\n\n1964 Gale Garnett [4-song 7″ EP] (RCA Victor – SPAIN) 3-20842\n\n1964 Gale Garnett [4-song 7″ EP] (RCA Victor – FRANCE) 86.408\n\n1965 Toujours On Se Souvient (We’ll Sing In The Sunshine)/Ne Me Parlez Pas De Lui (You’ve Been Talkin’ ‘Bout Me Baby) (RCA Victor) 57-5664\n\n1965 I’ll Cry Alone/Where Do You Go to Go Away (RCA Victor) 47-8549\n\n1965 Why Am I Standing at the Window/I’m Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter (RCA Victor) 47-8668\n\n1965 Gale Garnett [4-song 7″ EP] (RCA – FRANCE) 86.107-M\n\n1965 À la fenêtre [4-song 7″ EP] (RCA – FRANCE) 86.122-M\n\n1965 Malaika/Pretty Boy (RCA Victor – GERMANY) 47-9613\n\n1965 Denk Bitte Heute Nicht An Morgen/Schön, Schön, Schön Ist Das Leben (RCA Victor – GERMANY) 47-9671\n\n1965 Lui E’ Tornato Qui (Wandering)/Il Mio Paese (I Came To The City) (RCA Victor – ITALY) 45N-1451\n\n1965 Saluta L’Amore (We’ll Sing In The Sunshine)/Che Senso Ha (I Wish You Were Here) (RCA Victor – SPAIN) 45N-1466\n\n1965 Toujours On Se Souvient (We’ll Sing In The Sunshine)/Mon Plus Beau Rêve (I Know You Rider) (RCA Victor – France) 46.074\n\n1965 Gale Garnett [4-song 7″ EP] (RCA Victor – FRANCE) 86.437\n\n1966 Gale Garnett [4-song 7″ EP] (RCA Victor – FRANCE) 86.534\n\n1966 Oh, There’ll Be Laughter/This Kind of a Love (RCA Victor) 47-8824\n\n1966 It’s Been a Lovely Summer/You’ve Got to Fall in Love Again (RCA Victor) 47-8961\n\n1966 I Make Him Fly/The Sun is Gray (RCA Victor) 47-9020\n\n1966 I’m Gonna Be By Myself By Myself/People Come And Go (RCA Victor – NEW ZEALAND) 60407\n\n1967 Over The Rainbow/The Cats I Know (RCA Victor) 47-9196\n\n1967 We’ll Sing The Sunshine/You Are My Sunshine (RCA Victor/Gold Standard – US) 447-0732\n\nwith GALE GARNETT AND THE GENTLE REIGN\n\n1968 Breaking Through/Fall in Love Again (Columbia) 4-44479\n\nAlbums\n\n1964 My Kind of Folk Songs (RCA Victor) LSP-2833\n\n1965 Lovin’ Place (RCA Victor) LSP-3305\n\n1965 The Many Faces Of Gale Garnett (RCA Victor) LSP-3325\n\n1965 Variety Is The Spice Of Gale Garnett (RCA Victor) LSP-3498\n\n1966 New Adventures (RCA Victor) LSP-3586\n\n1967 Sings About Flying & Rainbows & Love & Other Groovy Things (RCA Victor) LSP-3747\n\n1995 The Many Faces Of Gale Garnett [re-issue w/bonus tracks] (Marginal) MAR-008\n\n1998 We’ll Sing In The Sunshine (Collectables – US) COL-5864\n\nwith GALE GARNETT AND THE GENTLE REIGN\n\n1968 An Audience with the King of Wands (Columbia) CS-9625\n\n1969 Sausalito Heliport (Columbia) CS-9760\n\n2008 An Audience With The King Of Wands & Sausalito Airport (Rev-Ola – UK) CR-REV-257\n\nGARNETTE, Garry [aka GARRY MURPHY]\n\nSingles\n\n1969 Have You Heard The News/Sick And Tired (Capilano) CAPS-158\n\nwith GARRY MURPHY WITH THE VALENTINES\n\n1962 Captain Of Love/Candy Kisses (Jaguar) J-1002\n\nGAROLOU\n\nGeorge Antoniak (guitar, vocals) / Marc Lalonde (lead vocals, bass, percussion) / Michel Deguire (drums, percussion) / Michel Lalonde (lead vocals, acoustic guitar, percussion) / Steven Naylor (keyboards, vocals) / Réginald Guay (vocals, keyboards) / Gaston Gagnon (guitar, vocals) / Raynald Wiseman (Saxophone) / Gilles Beaudoin (guitar)\n\nA French-Canadian folk-rock group formed in 1975 as Lougarou who released a self-titled album in 1976 before receiving a cease & desist order from a dance troupe named Les Loups-garous in 1977 that they could not use the name. The band would change its name to Garolou, and Antoniak and Naylor would leave the group. The band released albums through the early1980s before disbanding. Michel Lalonde would launch a solo career.

It was in London, Ontario in 1966, as part of a United Appeal concert in which their latest band, The King Bees, finished fourth that the duo decided to perform together professionally. With a deal through RCA/Victor the act released the single “Little Girl/What’s Your Name” that year. There wasn’t a huge amount of success and gigs were hard to come by. They eventually quit the act and decided to focus on their talents as a duo. Beckett worked the comic end of the act as Weeks became the straight man while weaving comedy, original songs and established hits into their act. Their stage show was punctuated by imitations of other Canadian recording artists such as a Vienna choirboy singing The Bells’ “Stay Awhile” or an all kazoo version of “One Fine Morning” by Lighthouse. This show made them very appealing in Europe particularly Holland. They began recording in 1969 and began playing festival including a headlining attraction at the 1970 World’s Fair in Japan. Gary & Dave signed to Greg Hambleton’s Axe Records in 1972. Their first few singles were slow starters, but the label was determined to find the right material and musicians to record a full length LP. 1973’s ‘Together’ was recorded at Toronto Sound Studios and Manta Sound by engineers Dave Slagter, Terry Brown, Greg Hambleton and Dave Green, with Hambleton also acting as the producer. Beckett and Weeks sang everything and supplied instrumentation on several tracks. The string and horn arrangements were by Brown’s musical director, Doug Riley, with bass and guitars by Sebastian Agnello and Greg Hambleton’s brother Fergus. Drums were supplied by Paul Clinch (Choya) and keyboards by Peter Goodale. The album spawned what would become their biggest hit – 1973’s “Could You Ever Love Me Again”. The song not only went to No1 in Canada but stayed on the charts for 27 weeks and became a French hit for 12 year-old Michel Lesage in 1974. To promote the single and the album, they toured along with The Stampeders which was followed by their own CBC-TV show. The single would eventually be released in 22 countries with mild success in the US and major success in Australia. After several more hits, like 1974’s “It Might As Well Rain Until September”, the duo walked away from their recording contract and decided to follow their other love, flying, and both became pilots for Airtransit STOL Canada, an experimental commuter airline from Toronto to Ottawa. It wasn’t long, however, before they were back into music. With their return to music full time they enlisted the help of backing band The Stewart Brothers and toured to support the release of their album “14 Greatest Hits” in 1977. The duo finally split in 1979 and returned to full time jobs as pilots for Air Canada. Weeks retired from music and became assistant pastor at the Calvary Church in Toronto before moving to Ireland to do Missionary work; Beckett became a consultant for the Ministry of Transportation in their test pilot program and was the flight safety director for Ontario’s London Air Show. with notes from Sebastian Agnello and Davida Bösch.

The following week they performed at the local YMCA which was initially only a 15 minute appearance that turned into a full-blown sock hop. The group became a full-time concern with the group averaging between two and five dances a week throughout New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Ontario, Québec, and Nova Scotia. They released their first album on Banff Records in 1963followed in 1964 by their sophomore effort “These Fabulous Gemtones Play Reno and Other Hits.” Soon they were invited to play on Montreal’s “Like Young” TV show following the Top-10 showing of their original song “Reno” on the charts. An appearance at the New York World’s Fair followed and tours throughout the eastern seaboard; Keyboardist Brice Sinclair moved to Bangor, Maine where he co-founded Rockin’ Ron and the New Society Band in 1970.

The band worked in the Québec dance halls such as La Salle, Golden, and Parc Belmont among others. After hearing a Beatles record brought back from England by a friend prior to its release in North America, Gene Williams and G-Notes recorded a tribute album to The Beatles. The tribute album was released by Globe Records and found front-rack space in the windows of Kresge and Woolworths at the same time as The Beatles’ Capitol Records Canada’s album ‘Beatlemania: With The Beatles.’ The tribute album would sell over 150,000 copies and half the songs were repackaged by Global on a second album shared with The Four Knights called ‘The Beatlemen – Twist And Shout.’ Despite this, no money trickled down to the band itself. The band would break up in early 1965, and Gene Williams became the guitarist for Donald Lautrec from 1965 through 1968. During that time he was signed as a solo artist to Montreal’s Jupiter Records, releasing several singles starting in 1967 before releasing a series of one-off singles for another dozen labels before starting his own record label/studio called Startrack Inc.

Within months of forming, the under-age act was banned, blacklisted, threatened with a $50,000.00 lawsuit, and ostracized by the older “elite” crowd at the Cedar Lounge. By 1981 they’d finally found a permanent five-piece line-up and became regulars at The Embassy Hotel. Soon offers were made to do opening slots for The Professionals, Forgotten Rebels, Dead Kennedys, and The Damned among others. In January 1982 the ban at the Cedar Lounge was lifted but the band was disheartened and split up following a violent and eye-opening gig in Toronto at The Turning Point. Generics reformed nearly a year and a half later for a one-time gig with D.O.A. on June 3, 1983. After supporting GBH and playing a record setting alcohol sales “farewell” show, Generics set out on a western tour in August, playing in Winnipeg, Calgary, and Vancouver. While at a house party in Portland in order to extend their stay in Vancouver they recorded a 3-song demo. A fourth song, “Outcasts of Society”, was also recorded, but only as an afterthought because the band didn’t like the song. The reunion was cut short after just three months when the Generics crashed near Brandon, Manitoba on September 3, 1983. Marc Sahrmann was killed in the accident. All four songs found on a few homemade cassettes known as the ‘Vancouver Demos’ in 1983 were properly released in his honour as the ‘Societal Hemorrhage’ 7″ vinyl EP on the anniversary of the band’s reunion – June 3, 1984.\n\nSingles\n\n1983 Vancouver Demos [cassette] (independent)\n\n1984 Societal Hemorrhage [4-song EP] (independent)\n\nGENETIC CONTROL\n\nPolio Elvis [aka Mike ‘Zabo’ Price] (vocals) / Dick Pagent (bass) / Louie Levesque (drums) / Duke Crystal (guitar) / Teen Hunk Rob [aka Rob Porter] (guitar) / Douglas Crevier (bass; 2005) / Rob Huppee (guitar; 2005)\n\nHumorous Montréal hardcore band formed in 1984.

The Gentlemen of Horror would practice in Walchuk’s bedroom at his parents’ house which was located on one of Kelowna’s finest golf courses. Golfers were often entertained by the band and frequently practiced with the doors open so the public could enjoy their music. G.O.H. released their first and only record in January 1981 – a 5 song 7″ inch single of which they pressed only 200 copies. Original pressings of the record have been known to sell for over $300 on E-bay and other on-line music services. G.O.H. only played an average of 20 shows in their three years together mostly due to the fact that there was nowhere to play (especially with underage band members) in Kelowna at the time. They would put shows on, usually at a place called the Kadac Hall, but the only people who ever showed up were six of the band’s friends. Their most memorable Kelowna punk gig was an outdoor show organized by the band in August of 1981 at the local city park bandstand. The show would draw 500 spectators and featured the band Empty Set that included future Grapes of Wrath member Kevin Kane. G.O.H. would have to drive seven hours to Vancouver or Victoria to play gigs and buy records. Tom and Chris Hooper would borrow their Dad’s car so they could play the Smiling Buddha in Vancouver, backing up punk legends The Subhumans. The Gentlemen of Horror eventually disbanded and in the fall of 1983, Tom moved over to the bass, and, again with brother Chris, joined up with friend Kevin Kane. In April of 1983, after putting together a one-off show as cover band Honda Civic, the trio decided to work together musically again. From the Hooper family garage they began rehearsals and gained enough confidence to open for acts in Seattle and Vancouver as the newly christened Grapes of Wrath. Punk Records will be issuing a 25th anniversary CD package containing Gentlemen of Horrors’ original ‘Sterling Death’ EP along with 11 additional tracks of never before heard studio and live material sometime in 2011. with notes from Tom Hooper.

In 1964, as the Ye Ye Beatles-inspired groups erupted on the heels of Beatlemania, Germain teamed up with Les Fabulous Furys for a Beatle inspired single “The Beatles Are Coming! (That Fab Fab Fabulous Beatle Beat)” which was produced by David Leonard at his Montreal studio for Monticana Records, and licensed to London Records in both English and French. with notes from David Leonard.

Timmins and Anton instead formed experimental music act Germinal — that didn’t rely on performing live but, rather, on studio recordings. To launch the band they formed their own label with Geoff Railton and Brett Wickens called Latent Recordings. Germinal would release a cassette in 1983 followed by a full-length LP in 1984. After the demise of the band Timmins and Anton eventually returned to Toronto to form the Cowboy Junkies in the summer of 1985 with Timmins’ brothers John and Peter, and sister Margo; Geoff Railton remained in England.\n\nAlbums\n\n1983 Germinal [cassette] (Latent) LATEX-1\n\n1984 DIN (Latent) LATEX-2\n\nGERRARD, Donny\n\nDonny Gerrard first came to prominence as the male vocalist for Vancouver’s Skylark which had formed from the ashes of one of Ronnie Hawkins’ many back-up groups. Band members David Foster and female vocalist BJ Cook took the initiative and the band was soon signed to Capitol Records. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1972 which spawned three singles including what would be the band’s biggest hit – “Wildflower”. The song was written by the band’s original guitarist Doug Edwards and a policeman friend from Victoria, British Columbia (David Richardson). The song went to No. 1 in Canada and made Billboard magazine’s Top 10. The single would go on to sell over 1 million copies. A follow-up album ‘2’, was released in 1974 and again contained “Wildflower” as a request by Capitol to keep the song prominently in the public’s consciousness. The album itself featured the additional help of Bobby Taylor (of Bobby Taylor & The Vancouvers fame) on backing vocals and Robbie King on organ. The record was met with less success and the group called it a day. Gerrard was signed to Elton John’s newly launched Rocket Records (at the same time as Dr. Music married duo Brenda Gordon and Brian Russell). The first single, Neil Sedaka’s “(Baby) Don’t Let It Mess Your Mind,” was produced by Robert Appere (Kiki Dee). By 1976 he moved over to Los Angeles-based label Greedy Records and released several singles including the charting “Words (Are Impossible)”. Several of his singles would also be licensed and released in Canada on Attic Records as well as his self-titled debut in 1976. Gerrard would also become backing vocalist for the likes of Elton John, Bette Midler, Bruce Springsteen, Aaron Neville, Ray Charles, Cher, Bobby Womack, Bob Seger, Dolly Parton, John Fogerty and Donna Summer among others. His voice was featured in the movie soundtracks ‘The Rose’ and ‘St. Elmo’s Fire’ as well as a 1990’s car commercial singing Barbara Lewis’”Baby I’m Yours”. The commercial led to a distribution deal on the Lightyear Entertainment and a second solo album in 1999 entitled ‘The Romantic’.

With Gerussi’s rich speaking voice Kanata Records owner Gene Lees took the ‘Words & Music’ format which often teamed him with singer-songwriter Tommy Ambrose to create a narrative mixture of poetry and music on a double album called ‘Fuzzy Love’ as part of the label’s second set of inaugural releases in November 1971. The poetry was supplied by newspaper columnist Gary Dunford while the music segments were supplied by Toronto session players under the auspices of arranger/producers Doug Riley and Rick Wilkens. Ambrose’s role, for the most part, involved performing cover tunes by the likes of James Taylor and George Harrison among others while Gerussi read the narratives between musical segments. Gerussi would go on to star in CBC TV’s ‘The Beachcombers’ in 1972 and stayed on the show for nearly 18 years – juggling a second job as host of ‘Celebrity Cooks’ as well. Gerussi re-teamed with wordsmith Gary Dunford and songwriter/producer Kevin Gillis in 1978 for the novelty tune “Signin’ With the NHL” as a one-off single. Georgia Straight journalist and musician Tom Harrison would later name his own band Bruno Gerussi’s Medallion as a tribute to the star. The band was invited to perform at ‘The Beachcombers’ wrap party on August 4, 1990 at the Gibsons Curling Rink in Vancouver. Gerussi died of a heart attack in Vancouver in November 1995. Gerussi’s nephew, Gino, is currently making the rounds with a remake of Billy Joel’s song “She Got A Way”.\n\nSingles\n\n1978 Signin’ With the NHL/Shake the Sun (Quality) 2274X\n\nAlbums\n\nwith BRUNO GERUSSI & TOMMY AMBROSE\n\n1971 Fuzzy Love (Kanata/Pindoff) KAN-4\n\nGÉTRO\n\nAlias of singer Dominic Lacaille who had initially been a member of Les Copains before forming a successful duo with fellow bandmate Christian Paquet known as Christian et Gétro.

He originally attempted to use the Shondels name, but was unable to get permission from founding member Jack Wong so the group called themselves The Main Line. Following one single on REO Records – a cover of the Motown classic “Money (That’s What I Want),” the band changed its name to The Gettysbyrg Address. They recorded three hit singles for Winnipeg’s Franklin label in 1967 and 1968. “Love Is A Beautiful Thing” was produced by Randy Bachman and Harry Taylor while “Come Back Baby” was produced by legendary producer Norm Petty in Edmonton. Hanford eventually quit. Many thought this was the end of Gettysbyrg Address especially with Wallace and Hamblin joining recently departed Greg Leskiw from the Jamieson Roberts Device. They formed a new act called Logan Avenue. But Frank Weiner of Franklin Records/Hungry I Entertainment Agency, still saw demand for the former “Gettysbyrg Address” name and suggested they reform under that moniker in 1969. They recorded one track, a Leskiw composition called “Baby True” for a Franklin compilation LP featuring the lineup of Leskiw, Wallace, Hamblin, Herman Fruhm, and Richard Torrance. This was a short-lived lineup and effectively ended the Gettysbyrg Address, with Leskiw soon forming Wild Rice (which lasted only a few months) before being asked to join the Guess Who in 1970; Hanford moved to British Columbia. He too would eventually play in the 1984 version of the Guess Who. He has recently returned to playing in Winnipeg; Wallace, Winter and Leskiw all ended up in various versions of the Guess Who; Winter has since passed away; Hermann Fruhm became a member of Crowcuss and currently works in the tool design and manufacturing business with Silverlode guitarist/vocalist Geoff Gibbons. with notes from Rod Sein, Jack Wong, Shawn Nagy and Dave Sampson.

Blues (East Side) ES-017\n\nGIBBONS, Geoff\n\nGeoff Gibbons was bewitched at an early age, by the singer Petula Clark and her producer and writer Tony Hatch before discovering the Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. As a youngster on Canada’s west coast, he was urged to join the British Columbia Boys Choir by his mother, a keen opera buff who taught in the North Vancouver School Board while Gibbon’s father was a professor on the faculty at Simon Fraser University. After four years of singing “in an insanely high register” and touring as a soprano soloist, Gibbons dropped out to pursue cooler teenage pursuits. Soccer soon gave way to guitar. He fell hard for Neil Young, Cat Stevens, The Eagles and Don McLean. He and high school buddy Jack Guppy, who later would become the drummer in Barney Bentall’s band The Legendary Hearts, formed the group Cove Company and established a popular weekend slot at a club in North Vancouver. After the tragic death of its keyboard player caused the group to disband, Gibbons, now 20, used his winnings from a local talent show to finance a trip to Australia’s Gold Coast near Brisbane. Confident enough to talk his way into a steady paying gig, Gibbons spent nine sun-baked months entertaining dinner patrons at night and lazing on the beach during the day. When his Vancouver friend Ken Kirschner arrived down under, the two decided to team up professionally to put their own spin on the sunny, California-influenced pop they loved. Both were reading J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy at the time, so they adopted the group name Silverlode from Lathlorien’s mystical Silverlode River. Back in Vancouver, Silverlode cut an independently released EP and then a full-length album with producer Claire Lawrence (The Collectors, Chilliwack, Shari Ulrich). The single “Sky High” became a regional and then a national hit. And the duo became one of Vancouver’s leading attractions of the early ’80s, landing on the cover of the ‘Georgia Straight’. The would open concert dates for the likes of Emmylou Harris, The McGarrigles, David Crosby and The Band’s Levon Helm & Rick Danko, and The Little River Band. On a national level, however, Silverlode’s brand of harmony-laden, radio-friendly pop fell between the cracks in an era when punk and new wave rock was at their zenith. Following a steady summer of work at Vancouver’s Expo 86, Silverlode split up. The group’s recorded output was re-issued as ‘Sky High: The Best of Silverlode’ by Bullseye Records in 2001. Back on his own, Gibbons was again plying his trade as a working musician with an unquenched need to hone his craft as a writer of original material in the vein of Gram Parsons, the Eagles and John Hiatt. Those influences were present on his eponymous solo debut, co-produced by Robbie Steininger (Sue Medley) and recorded live-off-the-floor to create ‘Love Tattoos’. A distribution deal with Sony Music in Germany and video airplay for three of the album’s tracks – “Just What I Am,” “House of Horrors” and “Can’t Curse The Rain” – on CMT in Europe and Canada sowed the seeds for the next album. It came together over a three-year period with assists from such stalwart local players as Steininger, k.d. lang’s back-up vocalist Sue Leonard, keyboardist Robbie King and bassist Rob Becker from Patricia Conroy’s touring band. With CMT again giving strong support for the singles “Bones In The Road” and “Living”, the album made an initial buzz as an independent before being picked up in 2000 by Toronto record company Song Corp. That promising scenario ended when SongCorp went under the following year. Following the re-issue of the Silverlode collection on Bullseye Records, Gibbons was picked up by the label for his next solo album ‘Sentimental Maniac’. The album spawned a single in the title track. When not focused on his own music, Gibbons has been involved in a variety of outside projects. Back in the Silverlode era, his vocals were in demand by Vancouver’s jingle industry and such clients as Labatt’s, Dallas Daily News, Growers Cider, and Fleet Street tabloid The Star. He’s also worked extensively as a producer/collaborator with his many west coast friends. In recent years, his songwriting talents have been recognized more widely. Three of his songs – “Love Makes No Rules,” “The April Place” and “Nowhere Town” – were featured in the FOX Television series ‘Higher Ground’. Gibbons has spent the last few years writing material for the Danna Mennie movies ‘Wolf Moon’ and ‘Lido’. Gibbons does regular live performances at Carderos Restaurant in Vancouver; he is currently a member of Vancouver supergroup The New Yank Yorkies. with notes from Geoff Gibbon.

Waterman, fresh on the heels of enormous success with the likes of Nick Kershaw, Bananarama, Rick Astley, Kylie Minogue and Tracy Ullman suggested him to executives at A & M Records. Back in Canada, Gibson had short-term pop success at home starting with the single “Lock Up My Heart” released in August 1986 on A & M Records. It cracked the Top 30 Adult Contemporary chart in RPM Magazine in September that year. A & M released the second single, “Look Who’s Crying Now”, exactly a year later which managed to hit No.23 on the RPM Top 30 Adult Contemporary chart. A self-titled album including the previous singles – produced by Domenic Troiano and Howard Ayee – was finally released in 1988. The song, “Easy Street”, was released as a single in April 1989 and managed to make it to No.22 on the RPM Magazine Top40 CanCon singles chart. A second song from the album, “Lying to Me”, was released in July 1989 and just brushed the bottom of the RPM Top40 singles chart. The album was re-issued on CD in 1991 through Troiano’s Black Market Records. As part of that distribution deal, Gibson’s follow-up album, ‘Rhythm Method’, was released on Black Market in 1996. It was also produced by Troiano. In 1997 Gibson penned the song “I Don’t Know” which became a success for Chicago act Escapade (featuring vocalist Simone Denny of LOVE INC). Gibson supplied backing vocals. Gibson was nominated for a ‘Most Promising Male Vocalist’ JUNO Award.

They achieved some success at sold out coffeehouses, but bounced into the limelight with a record deal through MGM in Los Angeles and had one moderate hit called “Been Burnt” in 1967. With performances in New York they managed to land an exclusive gig at the prestigious Bitter End which, in turn, led to larger venues opening shows primarily with Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead. Still, the band was not making any inroads and sensing the imminent failing of the act, Gibson joined Kensington Market and the Apostles folded immediately the week after. Following Kensington Market’s failure to set the world on fire in 1969, Gibson and former Apostles Pat Little and Mike McKenna found themselves joining Danny McBride and Jack Geisinger as the new Luke And The Apostles for a reunion single in 1970 – “You Make Me High” – on Bernie Finkelstein’s fledgling True North label. The single would turn out to be the band’s most successful record, but previous commitments for some of the members led to the addition of Walter Rossi on guitar. However, by the end of 1970, the band had split up once more. Gibson would go on to record for True North and release a moderately successful album in 1971. Gibson has continued a steady workload of club gigs around Toronto with the band Killaloe, Luke Gibson Rocks, and The Silver Tractors for the last 40 years as well as stints with reformed versions of Luke & The Apostles, Kensington Market and The Gibson-McKenna Band.

It was in Vancouver that Gilder realized his love for music, and after high school, joined the local band Rasputin. This band eventually morphed into Sweeney Todd and in late 1975 the band was signed to London Records. Their eponymous first album, released in 1976, produced the hit single “Roxy Roller” and Gilder’s style attracted the attention of Chrysalis Records in the US. After some deliberation, Gilder and Sweeney Todd co-founder Jim McCulloch left the band and signed with Chrysalis out of Los Angeles. Hoping to undermine Gilder’s solo attempt, London Records re-released “Roxy Roller” first with vocalist Clark Perry which went to #90 on the US charts. Chrysalis filed an injunction to squash the record. London then followed that up with Sweeney Todd’s third vocalist and third version of “Roxy Roller” featuring a 16-year old Bryan Adams, which went to #99 on the charts and once again Chrysalis had the song repressed. Undaunted, Chrysalis sent Gilder and McCulloch into the studio to record new material, and his first solo album, ‘You Know Who You Are’ was released in 1977. The U.S. release featured Gilder’s remake of “Roxy Roller”. Failing to make a dent on any chart, Gilder and McCulloch returned to the studio with keyboardist Jamie Herndon and bassist Eric Nelson, who appeared on ‘You Know Who You Are’, this time with producers Peter Coleman (Suzi Quatro, The Knack, OMD, Pat Benatar) and Mike Chapman (Sweet, Suzi Quatro) and the result was 1978’s ‘City Nights’, which had the international hit single “Hot Child In The City” (#1 on Billboard) and the Canadian hit “Here Comes The Night”. Coleman and Chapman would go on to produce Pat Benatar’s 1979 album ‘In the Heat of the Night’ featuring the Gilder/McCulloch track “Rated X”. Over the course of the next three years, Gilder recorded and released three more albums – ‘Frequency’, ‘Rock America’, ‘Body Talk Muzik’, but failed to recreate the success he enjoyed with ‘City Nights’. In 1985 he resurfaced with a self-titled album (less Jim McCulloch) on RCA Records. And as late as December 1997 there was word out of L.A. that there existed a tribute band called St. Nick: A Tribute To Nick Gilder, to sing the praises of the man who wrote “Hot Child In The City”. Gilder released another solo album in 1997 from his home base in British Columbia called ‘Stairways’ on the Spinner label. This was followed by ‘Longtime Coming’ in 1999 with his band The Time Machine on Oasis/Songcorp. The CD features remakes of “Hot Child In the City” and “Roxy Roller” both of which are featured on a 2000 CD single to coincide with “Hot Child’s” soundtrack appearance on the September 24, 2000 episode of ‘Sex In The City’. with notes from Leslie Charles and Nick Gilder.

Waugh decided to write a song for Canada’s centennial in 1967 and when a recording of 39 children from the school’s choir doing “The Answer Rests Upon You” aired locally, Rada Records released it in 1971.\n\nSingles\n\n1971 The Answer Rests Upon You/100 Years (Rada) MAS-1967\n\nGIMBY, Bobby\n\nBorn: Robert Stead Gimby on October 25, 1918 in Cabri, Saskatchewan\n\nDied: June 20, 1998 in North Bay, Ontario\n\nTrumpeter, orchestra leader, arranger and music teacher Gimby gained public attention in The Cabri Boys’ Band and other western bands and orchestras. In 1940 he moved to Toronto where he became the lead trumpeter from 1941 through 1943 of Mart Kenney’s Western Gentlemen. He formed his own orchestra in Toronto after the Second World War and led the Rodeo Rascals in 1949 on his CBC Radio country music program ‘The Bobby Gimby Show’. He was then a featured soloist and comic frontman with ‘The Happy Gang’ from 1945 to 1959 also on CBC radio. Eventually he dabbled in television when he became music director from 1956 to 1960 for the ‘Juliette’ show on CBC TV. He led his own bands on record for several albums and singles in the late ’50s and early ’60s including the song “Jimbo” in 1958 with Johnny Wayne – half of comedy duo Wayne & Shuster. In 1963 he went to London, England, where he worked for the cigarette company Rothman’s of Pall Mall as their jingle writer. The company’s clients in the Pacific Rim gave him the opportunity to compose the song “Malaysia Forever” which would later be adopted by Malaysia as an unofficial anthem of sorts. Gimby wore a cape and played a decorated heraldic trumpet as he paraded around being followed by children who sang along to his songs. He soon gained the nickname “The Pied Piper of Canada”. It was Gimby’s 1967 Centennial song “Ca-na-da” that gained him international recognition and he toured with different youth choirs which included is daughter Lynn. The song would eventually be recorded by more than thirty other acts including the Young United Singers and The Sugar Shoppe who made it a pop hit in late 1967. The song would eventually be adopted by Tourism Canada but Gimby donated his songwriting royalties to The Boy Scouts of Canada. Later that year he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada as well as ‘Broadcaster of the Year’. “Ca-na-da’ was awarded two Lloyd E. Moffat Memorial Awards for ‘Best Middle-of-the-Road Record’ and ‘Best Example of Canadian Originality and Creativity’ by Moffatt Broadcasting Limited in 1968. Through 1975 he ended up back on TV as the host of the music variety show ‘Sing a Song’ on the CTV network. During the 1980s he continued to lead groups including the Bobby Gimby Orchestra for civic, charity, children’s, and senior citizens’ events throughout Canada. During this period a songwriters’ lobby group used “Ca-na-da” as a call-to-arms for better royalty rates and pointed out to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that this song was only one example of songs generating revenue of only one cent each time it was played – the lowest rate in the world. This led, in part, to the eventual overhaul of performance royalty rates for all songwriters. In 1987, he created his own Bobby Gimby Productions in conjunction with the Sensation Jazz Band. In his final years he would lead a band at the Leisure World Retirement Home in North Bay, Ontario. Gimby died there of natural causes in June 1998. with notes from Jean Miller.
