She is especially interested in challenges emerging from plantation-style forest management.\n\nFabio Fontana\n\nffontana@interchange.ubc.ca\n\nFabio studied geography and biology at the Universities of Bern (Switzerland) and Stockholm (Sweden) and completed his MSc degree in geography at the University of Bern in 2005. After a couple of months as a research assistant in the Remote Sensing Research Group, University of Bern, Fabio started his PhD studies in the same group, specializing on the analysis of AVHRR and MODIS data to study land surface parameters in mountain regions. During that time he also spent three months at the Canada Center for Remote Sensing in Ottawa, Canada.\n\nSuffering from a “Post-PhD-exhaustion-Syndrome”, Fabio fled from real life after his PhD degree in October 2009 and travelled through South America for three months. After his return to Switzerland, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Bern on the validation of a new cloud mask for the MSG SEVIRI sensor. Fabio then joined the IRSS lab as a postdoctoral fellow in July 2010. His work includes the analysis of AVHRR data over the Canadian land mass to derive long-term variations in habitat conditions to indirectly analyze changes in biodiversity… But most of all, he enjoys being outdoors in beautiful B.C… hiking… biking… camping…skiing…\n\nGreg Rickbeil\n\ngrickbeil@gmail.com\n\nGreg Rickbeil grew up in the diverse metropolis of New Westminster, BC and was, of course, a Salmonbelly. After brief stints at SFU, UVIC and the circus, Greg finished a B.Sc. in Conservation at UBC. Greg’s MSc research focused on avian biogeography and diversity in British Columbia, integrating freely available RS data with large scale avian data sets to produce avian distribution estimates and inform conservation across the province. Greg’s PhD is focusing on slightly larger animals, tundra caribou, and how RS data can be used to test ecological questions regarding caribou – environment relationships and t­­­­he effects of changing arctic ecosystems. Basically, if it involves animals and large scale patterns, it’ll be of interest to Greg. In his free time, Greg takes as much advantage of living in the lower mainland as possible by getting out of it, up the Sea to Sky for a bike or snowboard, or into the Kootenays for a beer.\n\nJean-Simon Michaud\n\nmichaud2@interchange.ubc.ca\n\nJean-Simon Michaud was born in December 1984 and raised in a suburb just north of Montréal, Québec. City life was appealing, so he enrolled in a geomatics program at the Collège Ahuntsic in Montréal. After getting his degree, J-S worked for one year as a distribution service manager for Hydro Québec. Although he enjoyed his time with Hydro Québec, he quickly realized that he missed doing cartography and managing natural resources as part of his daily job. Thus, he moved on to pursue a Bachelor`s degree in Applied Environmental Geomatics at the Université de Sherbrooke, QC. During this time, he worked with Nature Conservancy Canada to develop an evaluation system to assess the value of aquatic ecosystems which would serve to guide conservation efforts in southern Québec.\n\nJean-Simon’s growing interest in conservation and wildlife management using remote sensing and GIS have lead him to pursue a M.Sc. at the University of British Columbia. He is now researching the relationship between the biomass or the foliage vigor (driven by remote sensing) and wildlife behavior.\n\nAlthough he may not hold the title of youngest PhD student in the faculty of forestry, Jean-Simon is the youngest of his group and greatly appreciates the advise of his colleagues. During his spare time, Jean-Simon likes to go hiking, sailing, biking, kayaking, snowboarding and wind surfing.\n\nJohn Arnett\n\narnett.jtt@gmail.com\n\nBorn in Vancouver, BC John is a rare 5th generation Vancouverite. Growing up on rural Salt Spring Island he developed an intense interest and desire to learn about natural systems. In 2008, John joined the UBC Faculty of Forestry and graduated in 2012 with a B.Sc. in Natural Resources Conservation.\n\nHe has worked for a variety of institutions, including Parks Canada and The Salt Spring Island Conservancy. Prior to starting his MSc in the IRSS lab, John worked as a summer student creating a set of Landsat-derived cover change maps for the Nisga’a Lisims Government. John’s master’s research involves developing automated disturbance detection techniques using high resolution RapidEye Constellation data. When John is not in the lab, he is likely to be found riding his bike.\n\nLorraine Campbell\n\nlocampbell7@gmail.com\n\nSixteen years ago, Lorraine moved from Tofield, AB, a small farm town outside Edmonton, to the BC coast and since then has held a number of positions in the outdoor industry, including ski patrol and kayak instructing. She knew that her interests in ecology would influence her career decisions, leading her to complete a BSc in Conservation here at UBC Forestry and find a position in the IRSS as a summer research assistant. This interest in ecology—and a lifelong love of maps, of course—made her decision to attend graduate studies in the IRSS an unexpected but easy one. Lorraine’s MSc will investigate how LiDAR can be used to advance and improve BC’s terrestrial ecosystem mapping process.\n\nIn her spare time Lorraine can almost certainly be found rock climbing, mountaineering, skiing, or otherwise enjoying the great British Columbian outdoors.\n\nMartin van Leeuwen\n\nvanleeuwen.martin@gmail.com\n\nBorn in Holland, Martin was raised with the beauty of tulips, daffodils, and the sheer amount of colours that these flowers bring with them. Although he did like these little colourful gifts of nature, it may have been the rarity of seeing forests in his country that made him decide to pursue his career among trees. He started his undergraduate preparation at Wageningen University (The Netherlands) in Forest and Nature conservation. He soon realized the eminent value of remote sensing to forest science. Therefore, in 2005, Martin started his M.Sc. at Wageningen University in Geoinformation Science, where he developed a decent background in multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing. This study definitely boosted his enthusiasm. In fact, he liked it so much that he decided to have a look into LiDAR remote sensing as well at University College Dublin (Ireland). Gaining a second M.Sc., his ultimate goal was to combine all his knowledge in his Ph.D. research at the University of British Columbia to find improved means to determine light use efficiencies in Canada’s extensive forested ecosystems to support forest growth modelling.\n\nNicholas Goodwin\n\nngoodwin@forestry.ubc.ca\n\nPrior to joining the IRSS lab as a post-doctoral fellow, Nick obtained a BSc and PhD from the University of NSW in Australia.\n\nHis research areas relate primarily to remote sensing of forested environments using airborne LiDAR and passive optical imagery. However, he is also an EPiCC (Environmental Prediction in Canadian Cities) project participant which involves the derivation of urban land cover attributes using LiDAR data.\n\nNick Soverel\n\nnsoverel@gmail.com\n\nFrom Maine (the US), Nick developed a love for nature and the outdoors in this wooded state. His favourite thing to do was catching frogs and hiking. Not much has changed since then. He attended the University of Vermont and studied Natural Resources with a focus in Ecology. After college he worked on an ice cream truck and as a park biological technician. He worked at Big Thicket National Preserve in Southeast Texas, as a seasonal firefighter at Bryce Canyon National Park in Bryce, UT, as a resource assistant for the US Fish and Wildfire Service at the National Interagency Fire Center, and as a seasonal firefighter at Olympic National Park near Port Angeles, Washington state, United States. He has a strong interest in fire management and remote sensing. After working at the US national office in Boise, Idaho he became increasingly aware of the complexity involved in fire planning and fire ecology on a landscape scale. His masters involved using Landsat imagery to inventory burn severity in Canadian parks. This work involves using a fire effects monitoring system used in the United States called FIREMON. Canadian parks to date have not inventoried their fire burns to this extent and this data will help to explain the effects of fire on ecosystems in places like Wood Buffalo National Park in North-eastern Alberta.\n\nOlivier Tsui\n\notsui1@gmail.com\n\nOlivier was born in Paris and immigrated to the beautiful and culturally diverse city of Montréal, Québec in the early 80’s. Raised in a family of culinary chefs and restauranteurs, Olivier at a young age developed a fondness for gastronomy and the culinary arts and is often seen eating. When not eating, Olivier managed to graduate from McGill University with a biology degree. Unsure what to do with his recent degree, he decided to take a plunge into the field of GIS and remote sensing and moved to Vancouver, B.C. to complete the Advanced GIS Diploma Program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology.\n\nAfter graduating from BCIT, Olivier worked at MDA Geospatial Services, CH2M HILL, and Hatfield Consultants. Developing an increased interest in remote sensing, especially RADAR technology, Olivier decide to put aside his aspiration of opening is own culinary restaurant to further his knoweldge. Aside from always searching for the best noodle shop and hidden culinary gems, Olivier is currently pursuing a M.Sc. at the University of British Columbia. His current research project focuses on the application of polarimetric SAR and LiDAR integration to improve large area forest biomass estimates.\n\nRachel Gaulton\n\nrgaulton@interchange.ubc.ca\n\nRachel completed her BSc in Ecology at the University of East Anglia (UK) in 2003, having developed a strong interest in forest ecology during an exchange year spent studying in the US (UMaine). After an obligatory year of temporary admin jobs, waitressing and a bit of travel (in Canada and Alaska), she returned to academia and began a PhD at the University of Edinburgh in 2004. Her research examined the use of high resolution airborne remote sensing for identifying canopy gaps in Sitka spruce plantations and describing and quantifying spatial heterogeneity of forest structure. During her PhD, Rachel took some time out to work on a fellowship at the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology in London, further developing an ongoing interest in science communication and policy.\n\nEven though she will greatly miss the impenetrable Scottish spruce plantations, Rachel jumped at the chance to spend time in Vancouver and joined the IRSS as a postdoctoral fellow in March 2009, leaving for more research in March 2010. Her research interests include spatial modelling of forest productivity using the 3PG forest growth model and more generally, ecological applications of remotely sensed data (especially lidar and hyperspectral imagery). When she escapes from work, Rachel enjoys being outdoors, whether hiking, attempting to windsurf or sitting in the sun with a beer.\n\nRiccardo Tortini\n\nrtortini@mtu.edu\n\nThe first of two brothers, Riccardo was born and raised in rural Secugnago, Italy, in the heart of the Po Valley. He first encountered remote sensing while studying Urban, Environmental and Landscape Planning (2005) at Polytechnic University of Milan, Italy. This interest was furthered while studying engineering after having joined the Laboratory of Remote Sensing. His research activity within the lab focused on the effects of hydrocarbon seepage on sparse vegetation, a topic that he continued to study in the two years following his Masters in Environmental Engineering (2009). In 2011 he crossed the pond and landed in Michigan’s beautiful upper peninsula, where he obtained his PhD in Geological Engineering (2015) at Michigan Tech. There, his research covered the effects of sulfur dioxide deposition from volcanic passive degassing on vegetation types.\n\nInitiated to soccer in his early years, Riccardo is now an avid outdoor enthusiast and endurance freak: he loves trail ultrarunning, long mountain bike rides, and cross country ski tours. When not on the trails training for his next marathon or dabbling with landscape photography, you can find him enjoying a beer or espresso at his favorite Vancouver spots.\n\nRory Tooke\n\nrorytooke@gmail.com\n\nRory was raised in rural Ontario on a small hobby farm with numerous barnyard beasts including horses, chickens, goats, rabbits, dogs, cats, and a donkey. Camping and canoeing were introduced to him at a young age, and many summers were spent in Ontario’s provincial parks. Rory’s enthusiasm for outdoor activities was a deciding factor in his relocation to Vancouver, BC, where he spent his summers on his bicycle and winters on his snowboard.\n\nAs an undergraduate student Rory had a taste of various courses from economics to philosophy until discovering his passion for Geography while attending the University of Otago in New Zealand. Between years of formal education, Rory took time to live and explore different societies and cultures in Canada and around the world. This mosaic of experience and education has inspired Rory to further investigate connections between place and people through his Masters degree where he studied relationships between physical land cover patterns and socio-economic variables in urban environments.\n\nRyan Frazier\n\nfarawayhillsaregreener@gmail.com\n\nHailing from Boston, Massachusetts, Ryan attended Clark University and received a BA in Geography and an MA in Geographic Information Science. During this time he worked in a large area mapping and monitoring program that mapped forest cover over Massachusetts using multiple years of Landsat data. It was there that Ryan developed an affinity for Landsat. After leaving Clark, Ryan was employed as a GIS Analyst at an environmental consulting company. That position offered him the chance to map a little bit of everything all around the United States. Now at IRSS, Ryan is interested in using Landsat time series stacks to understand boreal forests in Canada.\n\nRyan Powers\n\nrppowers@interchange.ubc.ca\n\nRyan Powers was born in Sechelt, BC, the small picturesque town tucked between the waters of Georgia Strait and the Sechelt Inlet. He was raised for most of his childhood on Vancouver Island, but returned to his birth place for his high school years. As a youth, he spent much of his time exploring the hundreds of kilometres of beautiful coastlines and the many mountains and old growth forests in the region. Ryan continues to enjoy the outdoors and has recently and enthusiastically taken up sailing.\n\nRyan received his BSc in Geography from the University of Victoria in 2006. During his BSc, Ryan specialized in Remote Sensing, Spatial Statistics, GIS, and wetland classification. Building upon his B.Sc work, Ryan completed his MSc from the University of Calgary in 2009, where his research involved employing a Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) approach to estimate the differences in detected wetlands when high-resolution imagery (<5m) and medium-resolution (>10m) imagery are used. As a PhD student at UBC, Ryan’s research focus is on the application of Remote Sensing imagery to biodiversity assessment and reserve selection across Canada’s Boreal Forests.\n\nSam Coggins\n\nsam.coggins@hotmail.com\n\nSam is an MI-6 agent with Double-0 status who performs black-ops missions for the UK government. Sam has sworn an oath of secrecy to protect the nation, so don’t ask who killed JFK or whether the moon landing was faked. Of course he could tell you, but then he’d have to kill you, cover up the crime and relocate to another country.\n\nUnfortunately Sam’s cover has yet again become compromised, forcing another relocation, this time to small town British Columbia, where the authorities have even less chance of catching up with him. Here Sam will continue to practice forestry, GIS, and remote sensing, while accepting missions that enable plenty of back country travel, skiing, and snowboarding.\n\nSteve Gillanders\n\nsgilland@interchange.ubc.ca\n\nSteve belongs to that rare breed of people who were actually born in Vancouver, BC and still reside there. He grew up skiing and windsurfing until he discovered climbing, at which time his life took a drastic turn into the dark world of big wall obsession. Steve worked in the forests of BC as a treeplanter, salvage logger, and woodlot manager and travelled as far as Asia where he spent two years. Upon returning from India Steve studied environmental science at Camosun College and Royal Roads University in Victoria, BC and eventually started a small environmental consulting firm. After several years in the world of small business, Steve decided to return to academia so he came to UBC to do a Masters degree exploring spatio-temporal patterns of mountain pine beetle infestation in the BC interior.\n\nTodd Schroeder\n\nTodd.Schroeder@ubc.ca\n\nIn 1989 Todd began his academic career studying the behavior of inebriated lab rats in the Department of Psychology at Hanover College. This unique academic experience left him working several uninspiring jobs including stints as a carpet-roller, condominium trader, yellow-page salesman and tennis teaching professional. Todd decided that going back to school might afford a more lucrative career path. While preparing for entrance into a master’s program in geology, Todd fell under the spell of the siren known as remote sensing. Love struck, Todd immediately changed career paths, and in 2002 he completed a master’s degree in Biogeography and Remote Sensing from Indiana State University.\n\nFollowing the completion of his master’s degree Todd worked as a Remote Sensing Specialist for the Canaan Valley Institute located in Thomas, West Virginia. Still unfulfilled, or simply a glutton for punishment Todd decided school once again sounded fun. So Todd loaded up the truck and headed out west and in 2006 he completed a PhD in Forest Ecology from Oregon State University.\n\nNow fully qualified as a psyhcogeoforester Todd landed a position as a post-doctoral fellow in the IRSS lab at the University of British Columbia. His research interests include integration of field inventory and satellite remote sensing data, characterization of forest disturbance and recovery dynamics with multi-image trajectories, tree species habitat modeling, and mapping forest productivity and site index of Pacific Northwest forests.\n\nIn his free time Todd enjoys hiking and camping, landscape photography, listening to reggae music and rooting for the world champion Indianapolis Colts.\n\nTrevor Jones\n\ntrevor.jones@ubc.ca\n\nTrevor Gareth Jones originates from the town of Kirkland in central New York State (NYS).
