        "text": "Bert and Doris Richards gave birth to one of the most influential musicians to ever touch a guitar. Keith Richards, the beloved guitarist for The Rolling Stones, was born on December 18, 1943. From that day forward he has lived an eventful life.\n\nRELATED: U2 Stop Traffic For A Video Shoot...\n\nFrom world tours to substance abuse issues, if you can think of a scenario, he's likely already been there. But no story is as bizarre as the rumor of him combining his father's ashes with cocaine and snorting them.\n\nKeith and his dad had a rough start to their relationship becoming estranged for a long time. But they were able to set aside their differences and mend the relationship in the 80's. They remained close until Bert Richards unfortunately passed away in 2002 at the age of 84.\n\nshortly after the loss, Keith was in an interview with NME's Mark Beaumont, where he was asked about his dad. Keith jokingly said, \"He was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow\". The comment, intended as a joke, didn't seem like one to Mark.\n\nThe story traveled far and wide. So far in fact, Mark Beaumont did an interview with BBC about the story. In that interview, he said that Keith offered far too many details for the story to be false.\n\nBut in 2007, Keith Richards denied the rumors. His manager Jane Rose appeared in an interview with MTV News and said Keith made the remark \"in jest\". going on to say she couldn't believe anyone could take the statement seriously.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Keith actually did combine his father's ashes with drugs. Especially when you remember he is famous for his light-hearted nature, and never passing up on a good joke. But in this case, you can't be too sure.\n\nDid he do it or not? That's for you to decide. Check out Keith Richards' video for \"Hate It When You Leave\"\n\nOther Notable Rock Events From April 3\n\n1964 - Bob Dylan made his first appearance on the UK charts with the song “Times Are A-Changing”.
