        "text": "Share\n\nNew York City is America's melting pot and with such a diverse populous comes incredibly delicious food. Starting July 22nd and running through August 18th, New York City Restaurant Week 2024 celebrates some of the city's hautest boîtes, offering diners special menus at discounted prices. And did you know that more than 60 MICHELIN Guide spots are participating this year? So, take a seat, grab a pencil, and plan out where to eat (and stay) in the five boroughs.\n\nBrooklyn\n\nTanoreen (Bay Ridge)\n\nCuisine: Middle Eastern\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nThis warm Middle Eastern Bib Gourmand is tucked into an unassuming Bay Ridge corner and run by Chef/owner Rawia Bishara and her daughter.\n\nInspector notes: \"Meals graciously commence with pickled vegetables and za’atar-dusted flatbread and are followed by a tableful of unique plates brimming with flavors and colors. Come hungry or armed with friends.\"\n\nLORE (Park Slope)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nRun by Chef Jay Kumar, this unique corner storefront at the base of a residential building delivers creative, highly enjoyable Indian-infused and American fare.\n\nInspector notes: \"The food is certainly the star, but the poetic cocktail list is worth more than a cursory glance.\"\n\nGage & Tollner (Downtown Brooklyn)\n\nCuisine: Steakhouse\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThere is plenty to eat here, as the team, headed by Executive Chef Adam Shepard is not content to merely let history and looks stand in for substance.\n\nInspector notes: \"Seafood towers, big steaks, crab cakes and a superb platter of fried chicken with cornmeal fritters take their cues from the legendary Edna Lewis, who ran the kitchen in the late 80s and whose Southern cooking has inspired countless followers.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nAce Hotel Brooklyn\n\nLeave it to Ace Hotels to find a way to put a novel spin on the idea of a Brooklyn boutique hotel. Ace Hotel Brooklyn finds itself not in Williamsburg but in rapidly evolving Boerum Hill, right at the edge of Downtown Brooklyn, in an arresting new building by Stonehill Taylor. What’s familiar is what’s inside: modernist-inspired industrial-romantic interiors by Roman & Williams, who are on our short list for the world’s most influential boutique-hotel designers.\n\nNEW: Discover Paris by The MICHELIN Guide — the ultimate address book of where to dine, stay, and enjoy the City of Light\n\nLizzie Munro / Gage & Tollner\n\nAce Hotel Brooklyn\n\nTong (Bushwick)\n\nCuisine: Thai\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$45 dinner menu\n\nOne of the first questions a server here will ask is whether you like spicy food. Answer truthfully because this Thai kitchen does not hold back when it comes to those fiery chilies, which seem to find their way into every corner of the menu.\n\nInspector notes: \"The space is indeed a welcome hangout, where friends can crowd their table with a host of small plates, or kub klaem. Highlights like fried banana blossoms with cucumber relish, or crispy rice with fermented pork sausage and shallots deliver a whirl of textures and sharp flavors.\"\n\nKRU (Greenpoint)\n\nCuisine: Thai\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nHusband-and-wife Chefs Ohm Suansilphong and Kiki Supap are behind KRU, which is Thai for \"guru.\" Indeed, you will get a lesson in traditional Thai dishes, albeit ones that have been spruced up in a decidedly contemporary way.\n\nInspector notes: \"First up? An invigorating salad of multi-colored cauliflower \"pla\" dressed in chiles, lime and fish sauce. Khai phra arthit, or a rice omelette that is equal parts fluffy and dense, is further proof that the simplest ingredients often are best.\"\n\nFrancie (Williamsburg)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nFrancie is headed by John Winterman and native New Yorker, Chef Chris Cipollone. The open kitchen is a true-to-life stage for this team, who can be seen prepping, cooking, and putting the finishing touches on a series of Mediterranean-style plates.\n\nInspector notes: \"Pasta is a must, as in the conchiglie with a luscious clam sauce. Shelled clams, bits of bacon, and sesame breadcrumbs complete the delightful preparation.\"\n\nMeadowsweet (Williamsburg)\n\nCuisine: Mediterranean\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nTucked next to the steely skeleton of the Williamsburg Bridge, Meadowsweet cuts a stylish industrial figure with its glass-fronted façade, whitewashed brick walls and original mosaic-tiled floors. Inside, the restaurant jumps with a steady stream of locals and regulars, all here for well-priced and well-executed food.\n\nInspector notes: \"Despite ample competition in this section of town, Owners Polo Dobkin and Stephanie Lempert elevate the kitchen’s dishes ranging from crispy baby artichokes with shaved parmesan and orechiette with blue crab tossed in a lemon beurre fondue to spiced duck breast with sweet corn polenta, grilled escarole and Mandarin orange.\"\n\nMesiba (Williamsburg)\n\nCuisine: Middle Eastern\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nMesiba certainly lives up to its name. This Levantine restaurant tucked at the base of the hip Moxy Williamsburg hotel, means “party” in Hebrew, and indeed its lively ambience alone is a draw. However, Chef Eli Buliskeria's food is equally captivating. From baba ganoush to ktzitzot (red snapper skewers) with Palestinian za'atar to khinkali, he honors this melting pot-style cuisine in a sleek setting reminiscent of Tel Aviv's Bauhaus-inspired architecture.\n\nInspector notes: \"A creamy \"risotto\" made with freekeh delivers great flavors thanks to head-on prawns and a tangy-tart yogurt.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe William Vale\n\nIn Williamsburg, where rare high-rise buildings tend towards the nondescript, the William Vale is an immediate eye-catcher. The building, by Albo Liberis, is unmistakable, and with an exterior like that, you expect big things from what’s inside. And, in what has to be considered a leap forward for the Brooklyn hotel scene, the William Vale delivers — Williamsburg’s finally got the modern-luxe boutique hotel it was always destined to have.\n\nAdam Friedlander / Tong\n\nThe William Vale\n\nManhattan (Bowery, East Village, NoLita, Lower Manhattan)\n\nHearth (East Village)\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nThis kitchen is still all about delicious Italian, yes, but now the ingredients are more carefully sourced, on the healthy side and with a deep commitment to GMO-free grains, less butter, and no processed oils.\n\nInspector notes: \"Chef Marco Canora's focus on vegetables, grains and brodi is a winning combo; make sure to begin with their warm whole-grain bread with creamy lardo. Then Sorana beans are braised to perfection with garlic and mackerel “bottarga;” while cured egg yolk and chervil tops carrot and beet tartare.\"\n\nBaar Baar (East Village)\n\nCuisine: Indian\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nThis delightful restaurant delivers contemporary Indian cuisine that brings a refined touch to familiar South Asian plates. The large, industrial space can feel cold, but warm, jeweled tones and even warmer service make up the difference.\n\nInspector notes: \"Baar Baar may bill itself as a gastropub, but dining is the focus here. In fact, its vast, inventive menu is filled with such delicious condiments, as if to prove that no detail is too small for this kitchen.\"\n\nNoreetuh (East Village)\n\nCuisine: Fusion\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nFor a taste of something different, make a beeline to this unique Hawaiian-flavored spot. Headed by a trio of Per Se veterans, Noreetuh features an intimate setting of two slender dining rooms adorned with hexagonal mirrors and shelving units used to store bottles from the impressive wine list.\n\nInspector notes: \"The kitchen turns out contemporary and sophisticated interpretations of Hawaiian cuisine. Imported ingredients such as shrimp from Kauai and the famous King's Hawaiian sweet bread are sure to invoke nostalgia among the expats.\"\n\nBar Primi (East Village)\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nGreat wine, a friendly service team, and two floors of comfortable seating make it easy for guests to pile in, night after night. And pile in they do—this Bib Gourmand is perpetually buzzing with diners sipping wine and twirling their forks into plates of pasta.\n\nInspector notes: \"They clearly know what they wanted to do in this kitchen: make excellent Italian (and Italian-American) food with a delicious twist here and surprise ingredient there. The result is a restaurant we would all like to have just around the corner.\"\n\nNudibranch (East Village)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nChefs Matthew Lee and Jeff Kim are behind the East Village's well-loved Nudibranch. The food is contemporary with strong Asian influences along with a few Italian and Scandinavian elements making an appearance. Portions lean dainty, but nobody seems to care, as they're all nibbling off each other's plates, family style.\n\nInspector notes: \"Begin with fried frogs legs finished with bright galangal and lemongrass before tucking in to cauliflower three ways. The signature mushroom dish has been on the menu since day one.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Bowery Hotel\n\nFrom the outside it’s clear enough that the Bowery Hotel is a relatively recent addition to the neighborhood, but what’s inside is such a faithful homage to classic New York you’d be forgiven for starting to think it’s been here forever. Its eclectic, bohemian look helped usher in a new kind of romance in boutique-hotel style, and the timelessness of its aesthetic means the romance is still fresh long after the glossy minimalism of some of its contemporaries has begun to fade.\n\nThe Standard East Village\n\nIt’s hard to miss the towering curves and angles of the Standard, surrounded as it is by a relatively low-rise district. And from inside the rooms it makes for unique perspectives on the East Village rooftops as well as the downtown bridges and classic uptown skyscrapers. Windows are floor-to-ceiling, and the in-room amenities are pure luxury-boutique: huge HD screens, Bluetooth-enabled sound systems, mosaic-tile bathrooms and three different bathrobes to choose from. All this and warmth too — the sunny rooms are fitted with subtly retro furnishings and dreamy beds with fluffy down pillows.\n\nDan Kocsis / Bar Primi\n\nThe Bowery Hotel\n\nCarne Mare (The Seaport)\n\nCuisine: Steakhouse\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu\n\nNo expense was spared in the design of restaurateur Andrew Carmellini's Italian chophouse, located at Pier 17 in the South Street Seaport, where a bustling horseshoe-shaped bar anchors the ground floor and a team of sharply dressed servers manage the upstairs dining room, outfitted with Tuscan leather banquettes, Venetian mirrors, and charming views of the East River.\n\nInspector notes: \"High quality steaks are seasoned and cooked deftly; and among the many cuts and sizes, the unique gorgonzola-cured Wagyu strip loin is certainly a highlight.\"\n\n8282 (Lower East Side)\n\nCuisine: Korean\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThere’s a first time for everything at this rambunctious little restaurant in the Lower East Side. The team works with a solid foundation of Korean flavors and from there, springboards into uncharted waters. Creative, bold dishes – all of which beg to be shared – run up and down this menu. Those wanting to stick to something more familiar will not leave disappointed.\n\nInspector notes: \"The pan-fried scallion-parsley pancake makes for a superb start, followed by tender medallions of grilled Iberico pork galbi resting in a pool of spicy red chili paste.\"\n\nCrown Shy (Lower Manhattan)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nCrown Shy occupies a stunning setting in the landmark Art Deco tower, 70 Pine Street. It’s an undeniable feast for the senses, as the cooking is just as enticing. The kitchen moves like clockwork, in sync and calm in its delivery of dishes like ricotta gnocchi, delightfully pillowy and slathered with a creamy sauce that surprises with a hit of spice along with crumbly duck bits.\n\nInspector notes: \"The roasted Japanese sweet potato nestled in a bright-tasting green curry sauce is made heartier by some strewn farro, while a perfectly refreshing finale is the Creamsicle-inspired satsuma ice crowned with torched marshmallow and shattered bits of honeycomb candy.\"\n\nWayan (NoLita)\n\nCuisine: Indonesian\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nThis enticing Indonesian restaurant, brought to you by Chef/co-owner Cédric Vongerichten boasts a modern French flair. Located in ever-fashionable SoHo, the long and sleek restaurant is a riot for the senses, thanks to a lush, exotic décor filled with candles, pillows, live plants, and warm teak paneling.\n\nInspector notes: \"The seasonal menu is divided into satays, sides, small and large plates, as well as a sprinkling of desserts.\"\n\nMa•dé (NoLita)\n\nCuisine: South East Asian\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThis spot, which translates to \"second born\" in Balinese (Sister spot and \"first born\" is nearby Wayan), is the latest from Chef Cédric Vongerichten and wife Ochi Latjuba Vongerichten. It is a tribute to their love for the Indonesian archipelago, with everything from collected shells and tiles to handpicked glassware sourced directly.\n\nInspector notes: \"The food is as sunny and pleasant as the setting. Snack on a bowlful of crispy-fried artichoke hearts with a side of basil, black olive and lemon aioli, then delight in the Ma·dé chirashi, presented in an etched wine glass with cubes of tuna and trout over kombu-braised potatoes for a dish that is as delicious as it is stunning.\"\n\nIl Buco Alimentari e Vineria (NoHo)\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nThis is the kind of cooking and scene that makes you wish you were Italian. Start with a stroll through the alimentari up front to grab some goodies; then settle into the rustic and warm dining area in the back. Note the meticulous copper roof and open kitchen, which set a picturesque backdrop for a delicious meal.\n\nInspector notes: \"Perfectly chewy spaghetti, tossed with lemon zest, bottarga di mugggine and red pepper flakes, is simple yet wholly devourable.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nCrosby Street Hotel, Firmdale Hotels\n\nThis year, more than most, hotels are clambering over one another to slash costs and look adequately humble. What’s so appealing about Crosby Street, and the Firmdale approach in general, is that they’re unapologetic about the fact that theirs is a decidedly high-end offering. There’s something inherently a little bit decadent in the very idea of paying money for a place to sleep, after all, and while Crosby Street isn’t exactly conspicuous consumption of the champagne-in-the-bathtub variety, it’s by no means a hard time either — and the confidence shows, right down to the smallest detail.\n\nThe James New York Nomad\n\nVestiges of the building’s original architectural ornamentation remain, and are contrasted in the rooms with Scandinavian modernist furniture, in a way that’s reminiscent of more than a few Copenhagen luxury boutique hotels. Standard rooms are typically New York–sized, but some genuinely expansive suites are available as well. Ultra-modern details include a gym equipped with Peloton bikes and a generous pet policy; the hotel’s public spaces include a speakeasy-style cocktail bar named after the original hotel on this site, the Seville, as well as the flagship location of Scarpetta, the highly regarded Italian restaurant brand.\n\nDan Ahn / 8282\n\nCrosby Street Hotel, Firmdale Hotels\n\nManhattan (Chelsea, Flatiron, Gramercy, NoMad, Koreatown, Union Square)\n\nCi Siamo (Chelsea)\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu\n\nEfficient, busy from the minute doors open and effortlessly likable, this Italian eatery hiding deep inside the Manhattan West development is everything we’ve come to expect—and enjoy—from restaurateur Danny Meyer.\n\nInspector notes: \"Chef Hillary Sterling's food is equally inviting. The caramelized onion torta is enough to warrant a return, with melting onions packed into a delicate crust, buried under two kinds of pecorino and finished in the wood-burning oven.\"\n\nHav & Mar (Chelsea)\n\nCuisine: Fusion\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThis modern spot pays homage to Samuelsson's Ethiopian and Swedish roots with a seamless and heartfelt approach. The menu pulls from both cultures and their staple ingredients.\n\nInspector notes: \"Few dishes represent this cultural collision better than the Swediopian, a berbere-cured salmon shingled between slices of Granny Smith apple, dressed with mustard seed caviar and buckthorn and finished with injera chips.\"\n\nCarlotto (Gramercy)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThough it's steps from Gramercy Park, an area already brimming with dining choices, Carlotto is a chic and elegant newcomer worthy of attention. It has just the right mix of Southern Italian-American cuisine and impeccable hospitality, where warmly lit interiors and exposed brick walls exude an urban trattoria ambience.\n\nInspector notes: \"Begin with the beef carpaccio, with tissue-thin slices of beef tenderloin topped with slightly smoky aioli, Burgundy truffle and pecorino. Then, risotto tucked with meaty Alaskan king crab and sweet corn is textbook perfect. Finally, their selection of amari, including vintage varieties, is beyond comprehensive and is a worthy splash in your affogato.\"\n\nOceans (Gramercy)\n\nCuisine: Seafood\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nPark Avenue South may be brimming with restaurants—from expense account beauties to the massively trendy—but this dining room will stop you in your tracks. First with its looks (imagine an inviting bar that anchors the room up front, while the back is crowned by a raw bar and sushi counter); and then with its enticing cooking.\n\nInspector notes: \"If the glistening items on ice didn't give you the hint, seafood reigns, with local plus global sourcing and preparations ranging from ceviche and sushi to towering platters and delicious entrées.\"\n\nThe Dining Room at Gramercy Tavern (Gramercy)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 lunch menu\n\nThis fabled NY icon is high on most people's roll call. It's one of those places that manages the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities and can be all things to all diners. The “Tavern” side is a prized spot for lunch, especially if you can sit at the bar. It doesn't take reservations so get here early. The “Dining Room” though is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle and truly comes to life at night. Service is attentive throughout.\n\nInspector notes: \"Focused on impeccable products, the seasonal and creative American cuisine is a perfect match for the woody surrounds. It's also sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nPendry Manhattan West\n\nIt’s well tailored to its setting, thanks to the interior work of the New York–based Gachot Studios, but a keen eye might detect hints of the Pendry’s Californian origins — there’s a certain calming softness to the design and materials, and echoes of the West Coast’s golden sunlight in the décor. There’s also a sparse simplicity to the rooms and suites that makes them feel even more generously sized than they already are.\n\nClay Williams / Hav & Mar\n\nPendry Manhattan West\n\nKyma (Flatiron)\n\nCuisine: Greek\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nAs its name in Greek suggests, this stunner is making “waves” in town by way of Roslyn, New York. The space transports diners to the Ionian Sea but it’s not just beauty that bewitches here.\n\nInspector notes: \" All Hellenic meals begin with a panoply of spreads, so using a warm pita, scoop up the pikilia trio with feta, hummus and taramasalata. The menu also lists a series of fresh-caught fish ready for “your pleasure.”\n\nJunoon (Flatiron)\n\nCuisine: Indian\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu/$60 dinner menu\n\nFeaturing a series of spaces (the front area is primarily suited for a bite and bevy), the reprized décor flaunts pendant lights strung with thick grass ropes, vintage mirrors, and a gleaming white marble bar. Speaking of, teetotalers rejoice as the mocktails alone (a cucumber collins, anyone?) are worth a letter home.\n\nInspector notes: \"Bold Indian flavors and elegant platings are par for the course. The menu certainly makes the most of goat as a whole.\"\n\nThe Clocktower (Flatiron)\n\nCuisine: English\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nNothing says “Brit” like a billiards room and there’s one to be enjoyed at this swanky dining room of the New York Edition hotel. The space, typically full to the brim, has a refined look, with high ceilings, handsome wood-paneling and every inch of wall space covered with framed pictures of the good and great.\n\nInspector notes: \"There’s an elevated and contemporary British accent to the menu. Their version of fish and chips takes the national treasure to a new level. Beef Wellington may be a classic, but it isn't resting on any laurels here. Roasted Long Island duck is served with a chutney made from plum and shallots alongside woodsy chanterelles, but it's the chocolate torte with Earl Grey ice cream that you'll remember.\"\n\nKanyakumari (Union Square)\n\nCuisine: indian\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nCompact but contemporary with a buzzy vibe, this restaurant is named for the city at the southernmost tip of India, and appropriately, spotlights the regional fare of south India with a focus on seafood. The cooking is as bold as you’d expect, with a depth of flavor. This kitchen puts their spin on the tried-and-true.\n\nInspector notes: \"If the server recommends the slow-cooked Black Gold beef, order it. It's impossibly tender beef short rib dressed with Madras onion rings, crispy curry leaves, and tiny green chilies. A nuanced fish curry is complemented by the ghee rice.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe New York EDITION\n\nIf you know Schrager by his earlier work you’ll be surprised to see a relatively sober, subdued look on display. In fact it’s something of an Edition trademark, and it’s perfectly suited to the New York Edition’s century-old backdrop. The public spaces radiate prewar prestige, and the rooms feel serious, substantial, with subtly modern furnishings providing the contrasting note to the classic lines and materials.\n\nHyatt Union Square New York\n\nOf course at this moment, even in New York, straight-up ostentation is quite out of style. Here the cavernous, colorful lobby bar is where the (subtle) fireworks really begin. Modern furniture, modern art, modern design — needless to say, this isn’t the typical Hyatt. What it is is perfectly suited to this particular corner of New York, at this particular moment, and if that’s not quite all that matters in choosing a hotel, it’s isn’t nothing, either.\n\nMasala Ribs / Junoon\n\nThe New York EDITION\n\nHanGawi (Koreatown)\n\nCuisine: Korean\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nBeyond an ordinary façade lies this serene, shoes-off Bib Gourmand with traditional low tables, Korean artifacts and meditative music. While wine and beer are available, a pot of royal green tea from Mt. Jilee is a more apt pairing considering the soothing setting.\n\nInspector notes: \"HanGawi is a soft-spoken, vegetarian-only restaurant that cares about what you eat and how you feel. The ssam bap offers a fun DIY experience with a long platter of fillings.\"\n\nSweetbriar (NoMad)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nChef Bryce Shuman's appealing restaurant delivers New American cooking kissed by the flames of a wood-fired grill and a seasonally directed menu that has something for everyone.\n\nInspector notes: \"Love mushrooms? This is the place to partake, since they're sourced from all over the world. Case in point? A whole head of maitake mushroom, roasted and resting in a warm, umami-rich mushroom broth with tender beluga lentils.\"\n\nKoloman (NoMad)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nIt's old world-meets-new on the menu, where Chef Markus Glocker and his team take French and Viennese classics and render them with modern sophistication.\n\nInspector notes: \"Snapper crudo with spicy citrus is a bright opener before moving on to an intriguing and modern dish of tagliatelle infused with confit fennel and accompanied by smoked brook trout, vermouth and caviar. There is perhaps no better way to end a meal here than with a return to tradition, as in the standout apple strudel with rum raisins and frozen buttermilk.\"\n\nIl Fiorista (NoMad)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThis bright, airy dining room doubles as a flower shop, and its vivid, spring-like décor feels like stepping into a magazine cover. But these gorgeous blooms serve a third, even more exciting, role here, making their way into cocktails and dishes crafted with edible flowers like nasturtium blossoms and hibiscus petals. (They're also crafting a collection of spices, salts and sugars).\n\nInspector notes: \"Black pappardelle is imbued with lavender and black pepper, while trout tartare toast delivers a kick from chili, freshly grated horseradish and mustard flowers.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nArlo NoMad\n\nNew York real estate prices being what they are, you can see why a spacious hotel room can easily run you a month’s rent back home. The flip side of this rule is that an affordable room is often laughably small. The Arlo NoMad, however, goes a long way toward solving the equation — through a combination of clever, compact layouts and the plentiful sunlight afforded by the full-length windows of a brand-new hotel building, its rooms manage to feel livable rather than laughable, in spite of their modest square footage.\n\nMoonhee Kim / LittleMäd\n\nArlo NoMad\n\nManhattan (Greenwich Village, West Village, SoHo, TriBeCa)\n\nKubeh (Greenwich Village)\n\nCuisine: Middle Eastern\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$45 dinner menu\n\nChef/owner Melanie Shurka traveled to Israel to learn the art of making kubeh (dumplings) from the immigrant women of Kurdish, Iranian and Syrian descent. Taste the results of her education in this lovely Bib Gourmand, which showcases fresh, wholesome food, including a heartfelt rendition of its namesake dish.\n\nInspector note: \"Though hand-rolled kubeh may be prevalent in the Middle East, they can be hard to find here. Don’t miss the Syrian lamb version, filled with richly spiced meat served in a hamusta broth with chard and zucchini.\"\n\nLoring Place (Greenwich Village)\n\nCuisine: American\n\nPrice: $30 lunch menu\n\nNamed after the Bronx street that his father grew up on, Loring Place is where Chef Dan Kluger serves up delicious, stylistic, and locally sourced Californian cuisine to a downtown crowd.\n\nInspector notes: \"His skillfully made, vegetable-centric American fare served here is unique and spirited, beginning with caramelized cauliflower served with chilies and Meyer lemon jam. The wood-oven pizzas, made with house-milled whole wheat flour, are a hit at any time. The generously sized room is uncluttered and mid-century chic, with bright orange window frames and boldly striped banquettes.\"\n\nSilver Apricot (West Village)\n\nCuisine: Chinese\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nChef Simone Tong, a native of Chengdu, brings her culinary flair to this contemporary Greenwich Village den. The menu reads like a narrative of Chinese immigrants craving a taste of home. In fact, nostalgia is at the forefront in grown-up versions of such staples as a chili crab Rangoon dip, served with crispy wontons and salted duck yolk.\n\nInspector notes: \"Scallion puffs are warm, wee-sized pastries matched with scallion butter; while fried rice laced with bok choy and deeply savory Larou is quite literally flipped on its head with a crisp crust on top.\"\n\nWallsé (West Village)\n\nCuisine: Austrian\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nIn the midst of modern New York, Wallsé evokes a sense of place and a reverence for history. However, those who may think Austrian food is all Wiener schnitzel and apple strudel should think again, because this cuisine is itself made up of a host of influences, stretching from Italy all the way to the Balkans. Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner and his kitchen also demonstrate how cuisines can evolve to respect contemporary tastes without compromising their integrity.\n\nInspector notes: \"There are plenty of classics, including quark spaetzle with succulent, tender rabbit, on offer, but there are also lighter dishes, like cod with squash and chanterelles.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Marlton Hotel\n\nIn this town there are always bigger, swankier, more luxurious hotels. Personality is the only way out of that arms race. The Marlton is swanky enough, in its Parisian-inspired way, and it’s also realistically priced, so as to make space for a more eclectic clientele. It’s been described as a sort of baby Bowery, and that’s not inaccurate — imagine the Bowery Hotel on a cozier scale with a slightly more residential vibe, and you’re most of the way there.\n\nFood Story Media / Gotham\n\nThe Marlton Hotel\n\nSan Carlo Osteria Piemonte (SoHo)\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nSan Carlo Osteria sources the freshest ingredients from local farmers and purveyors for their cuisine focusing on the Piemonte region bordering Switzerland and France.\n\nInspector notes: \"Naturally, dishes reflect a unique blend of influences. Savor classics including vitello tonnato, tender yet meaty with spot-on sauce, or tuck in to a plate of raviolini del plin in brodo di faraona.\"\n\nThe Dutch (SoHo)\n\nCuisine: American\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nBuzzy and beloved since day one, Chef Andrew Carmellini’s The Dutch quickly became a major hit and SoHo institution. Its primo corner windows open on to the sidewalk, tempting guests inside with a stocked oyster bar, cozy banquettes and sharply dressed service staff. The menu is just as seductive as the space, familiar but with fresh updates.\n\nInspector notes: \"Highlights include \"Chinatown Calamari,\" featuring deep-fried rings, golden and crispy, dressed with a salad of diced cucumber enhanced with fresh herbs and a spicy vinaigrette.\"\n\nVestry (SoHo)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nVestry is a foolproof destination for guests craving a quiet evening in an intimate setting. Steering this One Star kitchen's reins is Australian-born Chef Shaun Hergatt, whose admiration for Japanese culinary technique and elements is clear and woven into the seasonal vegetable- and seafood-based menu.\n\nInspector notes: \"Risotto with diced white asparagus is lovely but the diced, seared, glazed eel served on top is a clever embellishment. Tender, flavorful slow-cooked lamb neck with a dark, rich, Bourgogne reduction is another standout dish that speaks to the season\"\n\nBar Tulix (SoHo)\n\nCuisine: Mexican\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nBaja-inspired eats meet SoHo sleek at Bar Tulix where the food straddles a very relaxed line between casual and haute Mexican cuisine. The seafood-leaning menu is primed with dishes easy to enjoy on an average weeknight or a weekend celebration alike.\n\nInspector notes: \"Guacamole is far from ho-hum, enlivened with roughly mashed creamy avocado jacketed by dabs of smoky-spicy salsa verde, serrano peppers, cool crema and cotija cheese.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nSIXTY SoHo\n\nThe location doesn’t hurt, down one of SoHo’s swankier streets, and a recent multi-million-dollar renovation by the London-based designer Tara Bernerd has left the interiors looking more vibrant than ever. The soaring loft-style guest rooms are still as quintessentially downtown as they come, equal parts luxury-hotel sheen and boutique-hotel funk, with high-end Italian linens, Dean & Deluca pantries (we used to call them minibars) and bathrooms that manage to be decadent and heavily marbled and yet youthfully stylish at the same time.\n\nSan Carlo Osteria Piemonte\n\nSIXTY SoHo\n\nTamarind (Tribeca)\n\nCuisine: Indian\n\nPrice: $45 lunchmenu\n\nMost impressive of all is the sleek display kitchen, outfitted with a gleaming tandoor that turns out exceptional Mughlai food like sirkha gosht (lamb in a fiery chili and coriander chutney).\n\nInspector notes: \"Malai halibut, roasted then blanketed in a coconut-ginger sauce with toasted cumin seeds, is a standout.\"\n\nFrenchette (Tribeca)\n\nCuisine: French\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu/$60 dinner menu\n\nFrenchette arrives courtesy of Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, veterans of some of the city's most beloved brasseries, and this duo has perfected their Parisian-laced panache.\n\nInspector notes: \"Begin with brouillade, a plate filled with scrambled eggs framing a pool of Peconic snails and—you guessed it—garlic butter. Traditional sweetbreads sport a crisp shell masking the smooth interior and are served in a savory jus studded with poached crayfish and spring peas. Savor a flaky mille feuille before bidding this delightful kitchen adieu.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Greenwich Hotel\n\nWhile you might not be literally partying with celebrity owner Robert DeNiro, there’s no question the Greenwich is an establishment that values privacy and discretion, two values many of today’s publicity-hungry boutique hotels lack. The location, in a neighborhood that’s become indelibly associated with DeNiro, places you roughly where hip and upscale intersect, minutes from more shopping and nightlife than any one neighborhood could reasonably need.\n\nTamarind\n\nThe Greenwich Hotel\n\nManhattan (Times Square, Midtown)\n\nGallaghers (Times Square)\n\nCuisine: Steakhouse\n\nPrice: $30 lunch menu\n\nA multi-million dollar renovation hasn’t glossed over any of Gallaghers iconic character. Walls covered with photos of horses and jockeys harken back to the seasoned stallion’s former proximity to the old Madison Square Garden. The menu’s “other soup” is a sly reference held over from Prohibition days; and diners still walk past the window-fronted meat locker where slabs of USDA Prime beef are dry-aged.\n\nInspector notes: \"The chefs here turn out contemporary-minded fare like hamachi crudo with a yuzu-jalapeño vinaigrette to go with choice cuts of meat grilled over hickory.\"\n\nLe Rock (Midtown)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nNo stranger to crowds, the team behind Frenchette has quickly found its footing on the ground floor of bustling Rockefeller Center. This is one of the more refined restaurants to open in the area in years, and the crowds have caught on immediately.\n\nInspector notes: \"In line with a French brasserie, the menu offers familiar trappings: seafood platters, hearty pâtés, classic sauces like au poivre and vin jaune, and, of course, delicious profiteroles smothered in chocolate sauce.\"\n\nSoba Totto (Midtown)\n\nCuisine: Japanese\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$45 dinner menu\n\nAs the name suggests, everyone arrives in droves for the tasty homemade soba. Dinnertime brings a mellower vibe, and a crowd of beer- and sake-sipping patrons ordering tasty plates of spicy fried chicken and yakitori galore.\n\nInspector notes: \"Skip over the fried seafood in favor of the soba totto gozen set, which includes the wonderful noodles in fragrant dashi; or try one of the many delicious dons topped with tasty tidbits like sea urchin and salmon roe or soy-marinated tuna, grated yam and egg.\"\n\nAi Fiori (Midtown)\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $45 lunch menu\n\nNestled within the Langham Hotel with walls of windows overlooking Fifth Avenue, Ai Fiori is the perfect perch for the expense account crowd. The handsome marble bar and lounge is ideal for a post-work drink; while large florals, leather chairs and square columns lure families into the formal dining room.\n\nInspector notes: \"The menu boasts Italian favorites mingled with contemporary flair. The four-course prix-fixe is the best way to experience dishes such as radish carpaccio; pasta, like luscious strands of spaghetti twirled with sweet lumps of blue crabmeat and dressed with bottarga and Calabrian chili; and entrees, like seared duck breast composed with kumquat, radicchio and chestnut puree.\"\n\nLe Jardinier (Midtown)\n\nCuisine: French\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/$65 dinner menu\n\nChef Alain Verzeroli, who spent just over two decades crafting menus for the late Joël Robuchon, is now the star of this culinary wonderland. This light-filled space is a verdant vision—with olive-green velvet furnishings, green-veined marble flooring and lush plants at every turn. It’s the perfect effect for the chef's produce-driven menu, where seasonal vegetables, fruits and herbs play a prominent role—with impeccably sourced meats and sustainable fish as the supporting cast.\n\nInspector notes: \"Highlights include a tempting composition of burrata with ripe black figs, apple slices and a Marcona almond gremolata. Seared Montauk black bass is expertly plated with lemongrass foam, roasted broccolini and sweet potato puree. End with Valrhona chocolate crémeux with white chocolate ice cream and a salted caramel sabayon.\"\n\nNaro (Midtown)\n\nCuisine: Korean\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThe group behind Atomix and Atoboy continue to show no signs of slowing down with their latest opening in bustling Rockefeller Center. Named after South Korea’s first successful rocket to space, the restaurant offers a more traditional view of Korean cuisine dating back to the Joseon dynasty.\n\nInspector notes: \"Choose between two tasting menus, one of which is vegetarian, and expect familiar dishes like mandu, bibimbap and shrimp pancake to be reimagined and refined, usually with mild-mannered flavors and always with high-quality ingredients.\"\n\nPorter House (Midtown)\n\nCuisine: Steakhouse\n\nPrice: $30 lunch menu\n\nThis is a steakhouse in the moneyed Time Warner Center after all, so deals here are going down almost as quickly as those bottles of Château Margaux. Still, this isn’t a suits-only haunt; in fact, the intuitive service makes everyone feel like a bigwig. And the Central Park views are worthy of the price tag alone.\n\nInspector notes: \"The food is straightforward, featuring crab cakes with horseradish-mustard sauce and charred cowboy rib steak. But, don’t shy away from other equally surprising items, including sweet, slightly al dente corn bathed with a delightfully rich and creamy sauce.\"\n\nThe Bar Room at The Modern (Midtown)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nThe Modern is designed to capture the iconic feel of the MoMA in which it is housed. Art enthusiasts can't help ogling at its glorious surrounds; while excellent acoustics facilitating quiet conversations ensure a steady stream of couples and globe-trotters. The kitchen is state of the art, so for a truly special experience book the chef's table inside.\n\nInspector notes: \"The staff perform a veritable ballet as they present diners with such appealingly nuanced dishes as a seed cracker with aged cheddar and butternut squash butter; or eggs on eggs, starring none other than soft-boiled eggs with sturgeon caviar. Turbot roasted on the bone may then arrive alongside rich parmesan cream.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nCIVILIAN Hotel\n\nCIVILIAN isn’t just a high-design boutique hotel in Manhattan’s theater district; it’s an intricately detailed love letter to the glamour of Broadway itself. Hotelier Jason Pomeranc and designer David Rockwell aren’t new at this, either — in lesser hands, an homage like this might feel heavy-handed, but here the theatrical commitment is as tasteful as it is thorough.\n\nDavid Oludele / Ai Fiori\n\nCIVILIAN Hotel\n\nManhattan (Upper East Side, Harlem, Hamilton Heights)\n\nJoJo (Upper East Side)\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThe 90s are back and so is JoJo—famed chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s first New York restaurant. Like the very best face-lift, this transformation has rid the space of its former fuddy-duddy feel and replaced it with a fresh, contemporary backdrop that beckons moneyed residents.\n\nInspector notes: \"Good taste never goes out of style and diners hoping for a little culinary nostalgia will be rewarded here. The menu isn’t groundbreaking (think: roast chicken and Maine lobster) but it is very well executed.\"\n\nContento (Harlem)\n\nCuisine: Peruvian\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThis bright spot is brought to you by beverage director Yannick Benjamin, business partner George Gallego and Chef Oscar Lorenzzi. A concise, clever wine list is poured into Austrian crystal to accompany a range of sophisticated dishes that bear a Peruvian accent.\n\nInspector notes: \"Well-executed seafood is a strength, as in crispy skin salmon and tender octopus with black chimichurri, but the likes of arroz con pato are also impressive.\"\n\nMelba's (Harlem)\n\nCuisine: Southern\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/dinner menu\n\nWith its colorful spirit and lineup of Southern classics, this comfortable spot—as charming and lovely as its namesake owner, born-and-bred Harlemite Melba Wilson—is a perfect reflection of the neighborhood’s flavor, culture and past.\n\nInspector notes: \"It’s a place to gather and relax over good food and drinks, from Auntie B’s mini-burgers slathered with a smoky sweet sauce to a golden-brown and berry-licious fruit cobbler that’s nothing short of heaven on a plate. Equally enticing is the Southern fried chicken—darkly bronzed, sweet and salty when paired with Melba’s iconic eggnog waffles.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Lowell\n\nThe Lowell saves the best for where it counts. These spaces are stylish updates on the classic prewar Upper East Side residential template, plush but always dignified, full of creature comforts and steeped in Gotham romance. Suites far outnumber rooms, contributing to the Lowell’s residential aspect, and more than a few of them have original wood-burning fireplaces, long gone from the vast majority of New York hotels.\n\nJojo\n\nThe Lowell\n\nManhattan (Upper West Side)\n\nDagon\n\nCuisine: Mediterranean\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$45 dinner menu\n\nDagon calls this prominent corner of Broadway home and is appealingly flanked by large windows. Inside, the room is open, spacious and easy-breezy, infused with shades of teal.\n\nInspector notes: \"The menu is a clear and nuanced expression of Middle Eastern flavors, as may be evidenced by a well-dressed salad of onion, cucumber, tomato and schug. Fresh-baked breads, like kubaneh accompanied by creamy labneh, shouldn't be missed.\"\n\nNice Matin\n\nCuisine: French\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/$45 dinner menu\n\nFrom morning until night, servers are bustling and cutlery is clattering throughout the deep, comfortable dining room. The colorful interior feels cheery with pale yellow walls, curved green banquettes and bountiful plants.\n\nInspector notes: \"The kitchen is led by the talented Executive Chef Eric Starkman, who delivers a versatile, Mediterranean-inspired menu with heavy French leanings. Soft prices and hearty daily specials merely help things along.\"\n\nThe Leopard at Des Artistes\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThis traditional Italian restaurant nestled inside the historic Hotel des Artistes is cherished for its well-executed favorites. Retaining that X factor from its previous incarnation as Café des Artistes, it is also a vault for everyone from artists to corporate bigwigs.\n\nInspector notes: \"The cooking covers Italy's various regions and may unveil a lasagna Ennese, layering pork ragù, Marsala wine and Piacentinu cheese; or braised coniglio with lampascioni, wild mushrooms and chestnuts.\"\n\nWau\n\nCuisine: South East Asian\n\nPrice: $60 lunch/dinner menu\n\nThe façade of this Salil Mehta operation is meant to evoke the hawker stalls of Singapore; and thankfully for us, the chef's creations are equally unique and delicious.\n\nInspector notes: \"From a classic tom yum soup with shrimp and mushrooms to Isaan-style larb with long beans and mint leaves, flavors are smartly layered with garnishes aplenty.\"\n\nEléa\n\nCuisine: Greek\n\nPrice: $45 lunch/$60 dinner menu\n\nThe polished Eléa has been a hit out of the gate as its décor is picture perfect and the menu replete with classic Greek fare. Fitted out with whitewashed brick walls, weathered wood beams, and pretty lighting, the bi-level space exudes all the easy-breezy feels. Add on the deliciously rustic food and you have a win.\n\nInspector notes: \"Imagine everything from creamy spreads with pita bread to fresh fish to get your taste buds going. Following suit, ingredients are given the spotlight in the likes of htipiti (feta with roasted chili pepper); taramasalata with cured ikura and pickled capers; as well as whole grilled tsipoura in a lemon, olive oil, and caper sauce.\"\n\nKebab aur Sharab\n\nCuisine: Indian\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nThere may be plenty of outside seating, but indoors at Kebab aur Sharab, the look is lavish. From the deep, rich colors and a sea-blue tiled wall to the intricate woodwork and wicker seating, this Upper West Side spot is especially transporting.\n\nInspector notes: \"A versatile menu offers snacks, small plates and main courses, all designed for sharing (though you may want to keep them to yourself). Do as the name suggests and order a kebab—the baby goat one is exceptional. Finely minced goat is formed around a skewer held together by thread, which is then unspooled tableside to deliver the juicy meat with just a whisper of spices and a hint of smokiness.\"\n\nNougatine at Jean-Georges\n\nCuisine: Contemporary\n\nPrice: $60 lunch/dinner menu\n\nThe longevity of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s flagship is due to many factors—a sumptuous setting, a discreet aura and superior French cuisine. Dishes showcase everything from attention to detail and impeccable products to thoughtful garnishes and nuanced flavors. The omnivore menu is appealingly versatile thanks to contemporary accents and classic techniques.\n\nInspector notes: \"A supple day-boat scallop over crispy \"sushi\" rice a light opener, while roasted cauliflower tea is delicate, warm and frothy with a pop of citrus from Santa Teresa lemons.\"\n\nAmelie\n\nCuisine: French\n\nPrice: $45 dinner menu\n\nFrom the French chefs, staff and owners, to that nation’s culinary favorites (moules, but of course!), Amelie is the embodiment of that winsome neighborhood bistro of your dreams. The postage stamp-sized restaurant radiates with warmth, so settle in with a glass of wine before perusing the menu—it's scattered with delicacies alongside as an ever-changing roster of specials.\n\nInspector notes: \"A perfect sphere of goat cheese rolled in crushed pistachios and drizzled with honey starts things off right. Then move on to the delicate, Southern France-inspired ravioli filled with Comté and a blend of cheeses in a heady vegetable-based broth.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nThe Mark Hotel\n\nIt’s about as far as you can get — both figuratively and literally — from the funky downtown boutique hotels of lower Manhattan. The Mark is the very picture of classic, timeless Upper East Side poshness, in spite of — or maybe even because of — its recent, extremely thorough renovation. And in its present incarnation it’s proof that old money doesn’t necessarily imply old-fashioned.\n\nMandarin Oriental New York\n\nThis is one of the only big business hotels in New York with a contemporary look — the guest rooms are sleek, minimal, with stylish modern furniture. But the most remarkable design choice is the inclusion of floor-to-ceiling windows — corner rooms, especially, seem suspended in air high above midtown Manhattan, offering a view that’s hard to match in New York’s more traditional luxury hotels. The fittings are as modern as the furnishings, with high-speed internet, in-room laptop charging safes, and flat-screen TVs in bedrooms and bathrooms. And those bathrooms are an attraction unto themselves, with separate marble baths and enclosed showers, and, in suites, vast picture windows affording bathers views of the Hudson and the park.\n\nPaula Sorrentino / The Leopard at Des Artistes\n\nThe Mark Hotel\n\nQueens (Long Island City)\n\nHupo\n\nCuisine: Chinese\n\nPrice: $30 lunch/60 dinner menu\n\nSuch a quaint setting is an apt pairing for the small, focused menu that features regional favorites like spicy mapo tofu, house-made cold noodles slicked in a sweet and spicy chili oil, as well as Chungking spicy chicken.\n\nInspector notes: \"Nothing blasts of heat here, so spice junkies are unlikely to break a sweat. Still, dishes like stewed fish fillet in hot chili soup arrive chock-full of minced garlic and channel the kind of fiery, umami-driven complexity we crave from this cuisine.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nGraduate New York\n\nThis being New York, of course, the Graduate is a touch more forward-looking and urban in style than, say, the Iowa City iteration, with architecture and design by the Oslo-based firm Snøhetta. The rooms come with views of the Manhattan skyline, and are bright and colorful — none more so than the Loft Suite, full of childlike charm (and inspired by the Tom Hanks movie “Big.”)\n\nHupo\n\nGraduate New York\n\nStaten Island (Stapleton Heights)\n\nVinum\n\nCuisine: Italian\n\nPrice: $60 dinner menu\n\nAs its name would suggest, this bijou on Bay Street is centered around wines, with many offered by the glass. Inside, where wooden wine crates double as decor, the place feels like an osteria straight out of Italy.\n\nInspector notes: \"The menu is designed for sharing. “The Meatball Bar” is a treat, with unlikely twists on tired offerings—think truffled veal or lamb. Hearty mains, like a pan-roasted Berkshire pork chop with rosemary, garlic and balsamic vinegar, or a smoky puttanesca pasta are never a bad idea.\"\n\nStay nearby:\n\nCollective Governors Island\n\nCollective Governors Island offers the sort of grown-up summer-camp experience you’d ordinarily drive to the Catskills to find, accompanied by live entertainment and cocktails on the Sunset Terrace. Tents feature air conditioning, en suite bathrooms, Frette robes, and high-end bath products, and the top-end Outlook Shelter is a cabin-like structure with an indoor soaking tub facing the Statue of Liberty.\n\nGrubhub / Vinum\n\nCollective Governors Island\n\nHero image: Briana Balducci / Carne Mare\n\nAd"
