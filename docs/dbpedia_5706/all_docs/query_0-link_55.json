        "text": "Burton Cummings (born December 31, 1947) is a Canadian musician. He is the lead singer for Canadian rock band \"The Guess Who\", and during his 10 years in \"The Guess Who\" from 1965 to 1975, he sang many well known songs, including \"American Woman\", \"No Time\", \"Share the Land\", \"Hand Me Down World\", and \"These Eyes\". Burton was born and raised in the Canadian prairie city of Winnipeg, as were the rest of \"The Guess Who\".\n\nHis first band was \"The Devrons\", which at the time was one of Winnipeg's biggest bands. He joined \"The Guess Who\" in 1965 after its previous lead singer, Allen Cobell, left the band. In 1975, after 10 years, Burton left \"The Guess Who\" to become a solo artist. Some of his well known solo hits include \"Stand Tall\", \"Scared\", and \"Break it to Them Gently\". In 2000, Burton as well as the rest of the original members of \"The Guess Who\" went on a nation-wide tour which turned out to be very successful.\n\nSince then he purchased Winnipeg's \"Salisbury House\" restaurant chain with The Guess Who manager Lorne Saifer and a few other local celebrities, and still tours with the reunited \"The Guess Who\" every summer. In 2001, Burton and the rest of The Guess Who received honourary doctorates at Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba. Most recently, the band played at the so-called \"SARSstock\" concert in Toronto. On November 23rd, 2004, Burton Cummings' new single \"With God On Our Side\" debuted at 21st spot on Canadian music charts. \"With God On Our Side\" is a cover of the famous Bob Dylan song. Cummings is planning on releasing a new album in the summer of 2005, as well as tour with Randy Bachman as The Bachman-Cummings Band, featuring The Carpet Frogs, a band from Toronto.\n\nSolo Albums\n\n1976 Burton Cummings\n\n1977 My Own Way To Rock\n\n1979 Dream Of A Child\n\n1980 Woman Love\n\n1980 Best of Burton Cummings\n\n1981 Sweet Sweet\n\n1984 Heart\n\n1990 Plus Signs\n\n1994 The Burton Cummings Collection\n\n1997 Up Close and Alone\n\nSingles"
