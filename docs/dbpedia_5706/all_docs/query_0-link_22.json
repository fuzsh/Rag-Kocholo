They each showed up for an audition at the Patriote, and they started their own group called Triolets. The name would soon change to Les Cabestans after it was discovered another group had the same name. They won “Best Group Discovery” in 1965 at a band competition. In 1966 Serge Laplante, a former choir mate, joined the group. Under the direction of arranger/producer François Dompierre, he helped highlight the soprano voice of Lorraine Cayouette. When added to the their folk music approach, they attracted the attention of RCA Records. They released several singles and a full length album in 1968. The group would split up in 1969; Charbonneau would go on to form Blind Ravage and, later, Mirage; Mignault went on to a solo career. With notes from Michel Parent.

With some extra cash, Cadell returned to the studio to begin work on what would become ‘Angel Food For Thought’. Stuart Raven-Hill and Graham Stairs at Intrepid Records signed Cadell based on the strength of these sessions featuring members of The Rheostatics as backing band, plus Barenaked Ladies’ Jim Creeggan, and Blue Rodeo’s Bob Wiseman. Intrepid released the remixed album in 1991 and the first single, “The Sweater,” became a radio/video hit. Single release follow-ups were “Inventory” and “Barbie” but failed to live up to the potential of “The Sweater”. 1993 saw the release of the single/video “Courage” (featuring members of The Infidels) from Cadell’s follow-up album ‘Bombazine’ on Sire/Warner. The album once again had an all-star guest line-up in John Gzowski, George Koller, Andy Stochansky, Chris Whiteley, Ben Mink (FM), Tyler Stewart (Barenaked Ladies), Thomas Neuspiel, Tom Third, Anne Bourne, The Rheostatics, Kathryn Rose, and John Alcorn. Meryn Cadell went on hiatus from the music business after the deal with Sire fell apart trying to put as much distance as possible from “The Sweater.” In 1995 Cadell became involved with the PEN charity – the worldwide organization of writers dedicated to the defense of freedom of expression which also works to free imprisoned, endangered, and disappeared writers. Cadell also began writing a one-person movie called ‘Going Back To Find’ which was shelved indefinitely due to Ontario Government arts funding cutbacks. In 1997 Cadell made a strong musical comeback with ‘6 Blocks’ on the indie Handsome Boy label. Special guests included Anne Bourne, Mary Margaret O’Hara, Chris Wardman (Blue Peter), Paul Brennan (The Odds), Jason Sniderman (Blue Peter), Martin Tielli (Rheostatics), and Fergus Marsh (Bruce Cockburn, Big Faith). Cadell also did some music for film (“The Hanging Garden”) and for the CBC radio program “Definitely Not the Opera” (aka DNTO). Meryn Cadell had a significant public career as a woman, but on October 2, 2004, came out as transgender on broadcaster Bill Richardson’s CBC Radio One show ‘Bunny Watson’, and announced that he will retain his birth name of Meryn Cadell. For many years Cadell taught the writing of song lyrics and libretto in the Creative Writing Program at University of British Columbia as a professor. He now resides in Ontario once more With notes from Andrew McElroy, Deborah Hoodiman, and Christopher Childs.\n\nSingles\n\n1992 The Sweater (Album)/I Say (Album Version) (Sire/Reprise – US) 4-18866\n\n1992 Inventory (Intrepid/Capitol)\n\n1992 Barbie (Remix)/The Pope [cassingle] (Intrepid/Capitol) IN7-0002\n\n1993 Johnny and Betty (Sire/Warner)\n\n1993 Window Of Opportunity (Album Version) (Sire/Reprise – US) PRO-CD-6495\n\nAlbums\n\n1988 Mare-In Ka-Dell [cassette] (independent)\n\n1989 Talking Like Crazy [cassette] (T.E.C.

The band solidified its line-up with the addition of Billy Bryans and Omar Tunnock. Walsh soon returned to Downchild after the departure of Tony Flaim. Fraser Finlayson briefly replaced Walsh before Flaim himself came over to the Cameos. Flaim didn’t last long before Chuck Jackson signed on as permanent vocalist in 1979 and the Cameo Blues Band became the house band at the Cameo Lounge. When Jackson left to form Citizen’s Arrest and taking John Bride with him, the band was considered finished. However, Walsh decided to resurrect the group in 1982 with an entirely new line-up that included Wayne Mills and several prominent pro musicians from Toronto’s Yorkville scene. An album was recorded with this new edition but was never released. In 2002 producer Lance Anderson finally convinced the band to finally commit their sound to CD. The album ‘All Play and No Work’ featured the line-up of Ray Harrison (keyboards), John Bride (guitar), Tom Griffiths (bass), Mike Sloski (drums), John Dickie (vocals), Chuck Jackson (vocals), Walter Zwol (vocals) and Malcolm Tomlinson (vocals). Special guests included Michael Fonfara (keyboards) and Freddie Keeler (guitar). For their 30th anniversary celebration the band put on a show at the Lighthouse Festival Theatre in Port Dover, Ontario with yet another line-up: Ray Harrison (keyboards), John Dickie (vocals), Freddie Keeler (guitar), John Bride (guitar), Mike Sloski (drums), and Travis Harrison (bass).\n\nSingles\n\n1982 Who’s That Lady/Soothe Me (Bubblehead) WRC3-882\n\nAlbums\n\n2002 All Play And No Work (Make It Real)\n\n2012 10,000 Hours\n\nCAMERIN, Sandro Carlos\n\nVancouver-based alternative jazz guitarist.

He became a folk singer in Glasgow’s pubs and clubs around 1966 – usually at his favourite haunt called Hasties Farm. After his mother remarried he traveled on his own by motorcycle landing in London, England in 1967. In 1968 he relocated to Toronto, Ontario and found himself in a group called Sons Of Erin who released one album on Dominion Records. Cameron would strike out on his own, but after finding that there was a Maritime Celtic singer named John Allan Cameron, he added “Little” to the beginning of his name and was signed, first, to Audat Records for his eponymous debut in 1970, and then to Cynda where his ‘Sit Down, Mr. Music Man’ album spawned several singles (including the title track) in 1971. In the 1980s he ended up in Newfoundland as a member of the band Sons of Erin. When he left that group, he became a popular entertainer in the St. John’s club scene and frequently toured the coastal ferry route in small rural communities as a soloist. He retired in 1998 due to poor health and passed away in October 2002.

Cameron would then become an independent artist again and released the song “Fool For Love” on Jack Lenz’s Don’t Blink Music label, and several other singles in 1986. Following the pandemic in 2022, Cameron joined Duncan Fremlin as a member of Fremlin’s long running band Whiskey Jack. with notes from Duncan Fremlin.

His uncle Dan Rory MacDonald was a famed fiddler whose sister, Cameron’s mother, was also a fiddler. She passed the tradition on to Cameron and his older brother, John Donald. However, at the age of 12, John Allan began accompanying John Donald at local dances as his brother’s guitarist. By 1957, John Allan was studying to be a priest with the Order of the Oblate Fathers in Ottawa until his love of music took precedent. He needed special papal dispensation in 1964 to get the blessing of the church in order to pursue a music career. He would continue his formal educational studies at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia but began making musical appearances on CJFX radio in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He also made appearances on TV shows like ‘Singalong Jubilee’ and ‘Ceilidh’ where he attracted the attention of Apex Records and releasing two albums for them in 1968 and 1969. A highlight from this period included an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry in 1970. Following his tenure with Apex, he was signed to Columbia Records from 1971-1976 where he released three albums, several charting singles and had his own CTV-TV show through the 1975-1976 season. His brother John Donald was producer and arranger of a string quartet that accompanied John Allan on the show. Cameron established his own record label called Glencoe in 1978 and used a series of several CBC TV specials from 1979-1981 to promote his own music and that of his musical friends. During this time he was also producer of entertainment shows that performed at Canadian military bases in Germany. By the late ‘80s he was indulging his love for acting with performances at the Stephenville Festival in Newfoundland and the Neptune Theatre in Halifax. His last studio album was entitled ‘Glencoe Station’ and featured guest appearances by Natalie MacMaster (fiddle), Ashley MacIsaac (fiddle, step dancing), J P Cormier (fiddle, mandolin, banjo, guitar), Seumas MacNeil (piano), Tom Roach (drums), Al Bennett (bass), Gordie Samson (guitars), Stewart MacNeill (accordion) and Declan O’Doherty (keyboards). Cameron received the Order of Canada in 2003. He is also credited as the co-creator of the Cape Breton Symphony along with his brother John Donald. In 2001 Cameron was diagnosed with Leukemia and died in November 2006. His funeral in Pickering, Ontario was attended by more than 500 people including musicians Tom Cochrane and Greg Keelor of Blue Rodeo. Many east coast musicians such as Jimmy Rankin, Ashley MacIsaac and Mary Jane Lamond paid tribute to the late artist on a 40 song CD set called ‘Yes!

In the summer of 1969, they went to Edmonton, Alberta to play the Orange County Pop Festival and stole the show. While in Alberta, over the period of 1969 to 1971, they evolved into the legendary Top Band. Their manager at the time, Lou Blair, went with them to Toronto, as it was the place to pursue a record deal. In 1970, under their new name CANADA, they signed with RCA Records in Toronto. The label released their first single, “I Don’t Believe”, with little fanfare and little promotion. The record flopped and a second single, “La La Love You”, did just as poorly. With internal restructuring at RCA, the label did not renew the band’s option. The summer of ’70 was still a successful time for the band live back in Alberta. They performed at the “The Festival Train” Stadium Show in Calgary alongside acts like Janis Joplin and The Band! Canada played many times at Club Apollo in Calgary and appeared on the CTV “Come Together” TV Show. At The Coral, in Calgary, the band opened for Steppenwolf. They also played featured shows at Edmonton’s Club Zorba’s, as well as high schools & lake dances in Alberta. By the late fall of 1970 they were back east playing the high school circuit in Ontario. By early 1971, they switched home base to Edmonton with Lou Blair back in Vancouver. Paul Dean left that summer for Calgaryand teamed up with Henry Small for the beginnings of a new band called Scrubbaloe Caine. The remaining trio, moved back to Vancouver in January 1972, but disbanded by spring of that year. McBeth went on to join Scrubbaloe Caine soon after; Dean would play in Streetheart and then have international success as a founding member of Loverboy; Newcombe was a member of Chilliwack from 1984-1986, but is best known as a successful session player having recorded with names like Heart, 98 Degrees, Jessica Simpson, and Michelle Wright to name but a few. He has also performed with such acts as David Foster, Celine Dion, Bryan Adams, Kenny Logins, and Chicago; Harvey briefly performed the lounge circuit but has been leading a successful solo career with his own independent label (Harvey Music) and touring the Pacific Rim. with notes from Brian Newcombe and Clyde Harvey.

Patterson was the only working musician at the time, and had just returned home to Ottawa after three years with the band 3’s A Crowd. Comeau & Huot had left music and had gone on to raise families and take on day gigs full-time. At that time there were few spots in the Ottawa downtown area where adults could enjoy commercial Pop music and Oldies that also boasted a dance floor, making The Tabu Room in Ottawa’s Beacon Arms Hotel a perfect place. The trio was soon joined by other members of mid-1960’s Ottawa bands along with newcomer Barbra Bullard on vocals. With that, they decided to cash in on their previous success as the Esquires and rename themselves The New Esquires. With only weekend gigs at the venue, eventually Wednesday nights were also added to accommodate the full house every night the band played. In 1970 local music impresario Harvey Glatt, who had been manager of both The Esquires and 3’s A Crowd, suggested that the band make a recording to sell at the club. Glatt paid for a three song session and shopped the demo tape around for reaction in the music industry itself. The best response came from New York producer/songwriter Jerry Ragavoy who was doing A & R work for a new American label called Tonsil Records. The act was soon signed. Due to the success of a Black American R & B group called The Esquires, it was decided the act should find a new name for the release of the first single. During Patterson’s days living in Yorkville Village in Toronto while a member of 3’s A Crowd, he had become a fan of the folk jugband The Dirty Shames that featured guitarist Amos Garrett. Garrett once said, jokingly, that if he ever put a rock group together he was going to call it The Toronto Maple Leafs or possibly Canada Goose. Patterson had remembered the Garrett quote and suggested it to the New Esquires members. Following approval from Garrett himself for the use of the name, the group became Canada Goose. The success of the recording “Higher And Higher” placed the band in high demand and they had to turn down regular work at their hotspot, The Tabu Room, as they started accepting concert engagements in Ontario, Québec, and the Northern USA. The highlight of the American dates came while playing in Burlington, Vermont at a local College club. After the second night of performances, the manager asked the band if they would do him a favour and play for the President of the United States during his visit to Burlington that weekend. The Canadian group obliged and Richard Nixon’s office sent the members a thank you letter for their efforts. However, soon Patterson received a call from former 3’s A Crowd member Trevor Veitch and working with American Folk legend Tom Rush who needed a drummer for a fall tour of North America. Patterson accepted the offer and left the band. It wasn’t long before Canada Goose called it quits due to conflicts in scheduling surrounding the personal lives of the various members. But, months later, one of the last members to join, Daryl Wadsworth formed a new band under the name Canada Goose to continue the success of the original band and accept another house gig at an Ottawa club. The new Canada Goose featured lead singers Paul Huot and Barbara Bullard, former Liverpool Set member Lach MacFadyen (guitar), Wadsworth (piano), Barry Gosselin (bass) and Phil Downey (drums). They played at The Plaza on Sparks Street in Ottawa. Various line-up changes followed and the band would finally call it quits in 1973. Garry Comeau and Val Tuck joined GRT recording band James Leroy And Denim; Wayne Leslie went on to play with Wells Fargo and did a tour with Tom Rush; Derek O’Neil went on to become a successful studio musician, writer, and producer in Los Angeles; Patterson went on to tour & record with Tom Rush, David Wiffen, Ian & Sylvia’s Great Speckled Bird, American Pop legend Bobby Vee, and then onto a 16 year contract with CBC Radio & TV in Ottawa. He died after a prolonged illness in 2011; Lach MacFadyen (who had been in The Liverpool Set with future producer Jack Douglas) went on to produce Harlequin, Joe Hall & the Continental Drift, and others; Comeau, Huot and Patterson reunited in 1987 with other members of The Esquires for their 25th anniversary concert and charity event for the Eastern Ontario Children’s Hospital. The City of Ottawa proclaimed it Esquires Day; Wayne Leslie died April 7, 2016; Richard Patterson died April 3, 2011. with notes from Richard Patterson, Gary Comeau, Daryl Wadsworth, and Doug Grose.\n\nSingles\n\n1970 Higher And Higher/Answer Man (Tonsil/Quality) T-0002X\n\nCANADIAN ACES\n\nScott Cushnie (piano, vocals) / Mitchell Lewis (guitar, vocals) / Terry Wilkins (bass, vocals) / Bucky Berger (drums, vocals) / Jody Golick (saxophone, vocals) / Chris Whiteley (trumpet) / Wayne Mills (saxophone) / Marian Tobin (vocals) / Eileen Tobin (vocals)\n\nThe Canadian Aces front man Scott Cushnie (aka Professor Piano) – of The Rocking Deltoids fame – along with guitarist Mitchell Lewis, and the Tobin Sisters (Marian and Eileen) drew their influences from the ’30’s and ’40’s swing and jazz styles.

He was a childhood musical prodigy who accomplished harmonica, guitar, mandolin and fiddle at an early age. Following school he joined his one of his brothers on the road who called himself Keray Regan. Frederickson adopted the name as well under the handle Bob Regan. He made his first recording as lead guitarist with Keray’s band, the Peace River Rangers, in 1953. It was an instrumental called “Teenage Boogie” for Aragon Records. The flipside featured a duet with Bob and his sister Fern entitled “I Will Never Hold Another”. Following Fern’s marriage in 1955 she left the music business and Bob Regan found a new singer partner in a young Lucille Starr. Lucille Marie Raymonde Savoie was born May 13, 1938 in St. Boniface, Manitoba, but raised near Port Coquitlam, British Columbia. She grew up listening to Hank Snow and Peggy Lee and in her teens she sang with a French ensemble, Les Hirondelles. She began using the name Lucille Starr in 1954 when she began playing around the bar circuit in Vancouver. Starr met Bob Regan who was performing at a wedding party she attended. As ‘Bob & Lucille’ they became a popular live duo. In 1958, they were married and headed for California to try and catch a break. In Los Angeles they met promoter and former Hank Williams and Hank Snow manager Norm Riley in Nashville, Tennessee. Riley was co-owner of country music bar the Riverside Rancho. He also ran Ditto Records out of Hollywood. The duo was soon signed to Ditto and released two singles: 1958’s “Eeny-Meeny Miney Moe” and “The Big Kiss” in 1959. The records did nothing to help their career outside of the folks that saw them in bars. In 1961 they signed with SOMA stateside for one release called “No Help Wanted” in 1961 but it too failed to light the charts or their popularity on fire. It would take two more years slogging it out in California to bring them to the attention of Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert and their label A & M Records. They were finally signed by the team in 1963 under the name The Canadian Sweethearts. They managed nine singles and two LPs which were distributed in Canada by Quality Records. Starr also made solo records shortly thereafter and managed an international hit with “The French Song” (“Quand le Soleil Dit Bonjour Aux Montagnes”). The bilingual tune hit No.54 on the Billboard country singles chart, and managed to reach No.1 in several territories including Canada. Her 1964 A & M album of the same name sold millions of copies and spawned several other singles including “Colinda” (peaking at No.3 in Europe) and “Jolie Jacqueline”. During this period Regan recorded one guitar instrumental single for Challenge Records called Tarantula” b/w “Highland Lassie”. Following their deal with A & M they released an album and several singles for Epic Records. The couple divorced in 1967 but would continue to perform together on occasion until 1977.

The song sat on RPM’s Canadian Content Singles chart for five weeks in a row from Sept 21- Nov 2, 1964. Around the same time, execs at Aragon signed singer Patty Surbey to the label as well, and paired her with the Canadian V.I.P.’s. This rockabilly outfit found notoriety on the Canadian west coast – most notably from the timely 1964 track “I Want A Beatle For Christmas.” Moving to Sparton Records in 1965, the group released the rocker “Hey Boy,” but it failed to chart; The V.I.P’s would soon disband and Surbey went on to appear in several TV shows before moving from British Columbia to Ontario and becoming a Born-Again Christian; Both Dave and Pat Trainor are deceased; Petrie would join The Centaurs.

With their original song “Dancing Under a Latin Moon” being released by Toronto’s Somersault Records (also home of Tall New Buildings), the label parlayed the catchy song into a full album deal with I.R.S. Records. The debut album entitled ‘Candi’ spawned several charting hits including “Dancing Under A Latin Moon” and “Under Your Spell”. The former would crack the Billboard Hot100 in the US peaking at No. 68. Candi Pennella was nominated for ‘Female Artist Of The Year’ JUNO Award in 1990. “Under Your Spell” was nominated for ‘Single of the Year’ and also ‘Best Dance Recording’ along with the album’s third single – “Missing You” at the same JUNO Awards ceremony. With a name change to Candi & The Backbeat for their sophomore effort ‘World Keeps On Turning’ they garnered another ‘Best Dance Recording’ JUNO Award nomination in 1991 for the title track. With disappointing sales and chart action, the group retired. Candi Pennella married Paul Russo and left the business.

By 1975 CANO had signed to A & M and began releasing french language albums albums to critical success though commercial sales eluded them. In 1978 founding member Andre Paiement committed suicide. It wasn’t until 1979’s ‘Rendezvous’, produced by Jim Vallance (Bryan Adams, Prism), and a switch to predominantly English language material, that the records began to sell – though still not in the quantities warranting a ‘hit record’. They temporarily split up with some members appearing as Masque a few years later. They reunited in 1985 with a new record. The guitar and keyboard sounds are rooted in jazz/rock fusion. Ben Mink (FM, k.d.lang) adds violin.

Canucks Ltd. arrived in Yukon in 1966 and had the house gig in the Rainbow Room at the Whitehorse Inn where they played for many years. Back then Yukon was in the midst of a boom and it was here that Park, Lewis, and Isaak had the opportunity to take over The Rainbow Room. Their popularity lead to line-ups down the block and standing-room only attendance most nights of the week. It was in this era they made music and memories with friends such as Al Oster, Hank Karr, Bill & Rusty Reid and The Northernaires to name a few. Radio was the cornerstone of communication and entertainment and it was through this medium the Canucks logged many countless hours recording and performing at the CBC with the likes of Les McLaughlin, Cal Waddington, Tim Kinvig and Terry Delaney, all who were huge catalysts in helping to develop the Yukon music scene as we know it today. Canucks Ltd. have played from Alaska to the southern USA alongside countless legendary performers such as Waylon Jennings, Loretta Lynne, Sam Butara, Ernest Tubb, Jimmy Duranty, Doris Day, Hank Snow, Buddy Knox and The Coasters, among others. Revered as the godfathers of live music in Yukon, they are one of the few remaining groups still together. 2007 marked the release of a brand new CD mainly filled with pre-1955 standards. with notes from Brandon Isaak .\n\nSingles\n\n1958 Old Macdonald/Never Before (Diadon)\n\n1958 Rock Around the Barn/Never Before (Diadon) 116\n\n1970 Sunshine Girl/Don’t Stop Loving Me Now (6th Avenue) AV-610\n\n1971 Yukon Song/Everybody’s Talkin’ (6th Avenue)\n\nAlbums\n\n1978 Gold Fever (Damon)\n\n2007 Ain’t Misbehavin’ (Blue-Star)\n\nCANYON, George\n\nBorn: Fred George Lays on August 22, 1968 in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia\n\nThe Nova Scotia bred Canyon spent time as a policeman, and a slaughterhouse beef inspector before his love of music led him to operating a recording studio for other would-be artists. He also put out two independent CDs – 1996’s Iron Wolf and his self-titled sophomore effort in 1999. Canyon competed in the ‘Nashville Star 2’ competition in 2004. He was the runner-up in the competition. After the competition ended he quickly caught the attention of Universal Music who signed him to their Nashville subsidiary Universal South. He released a new album at year’s end called ‘One Good Friend’ which led to the Top 5 hit “My Name,” a Juno Award for ‘Best Country Recording of the Year’ and four Canadian Country Music Awards Nominations (CCMAs) including ‘Male Vocalist of the Year’ and ‘Fan Choice’ award. As a lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics Canyon was part of the 2007 ‘China-Canada: Hand in Hand’ concert in Vancouver sponsored China Central Television and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation). Canyon performed “What a Fine Jasmine Blossom” as a duet with Mandarin singer Tang Can. In early 2008, Canadian Defence minister Peter MacKay appointed Canyon to the position of Honourary Colonel at east coast air force base 14 Wing Greenwood.

They were in need of a rehearsal place and guitarist Richard Emond had one. He was asked to join the band and with the help of new manager Reynald Beaupré (a friend of Émond) they became Le Cardan. They originally called themselves B Sharp Blues Band as they were playing Paul Butterfield-style blues. They changed their name depending on what the bookers were looking for. One of those names was Le Kaleidoscope. Denis Soucy came up with the name Le Cardan (meaning Universal Joint). They played at the Temple, a psychedelic bar, every Monday night in Québec City, and every Friday night at La Salle Beaulieu. Saturdays and Sundays, they would play at Mont-Laurier. Rhéaume worked at producer Andre Perry’s studio and the band would sneak in overnight and record their own material. They released their first single entitled “La reine et le roi” for RCA Victor in 1968. The band would appear on the TV show ‘Allez 4’ to promote it. “Les yeux de velours” would follow in 1969, and “L’évadé de la nuit” in 1970;Rhéaume would go on to a solo and session musician career.

The band released a 7″ four song EP called, simply, ‘The White EP’ in 1977 as they performed alongside such notorious acts as The Viletones, Teenage Head and The Ugly among other notables. With several line-up changes the band continued developing its unique cross of King Crimson-inspired art-punk which led to the release of a 12″ 1979’s four song follow-up called ‘The Black EP’ — which contained the 7″ single as a free bonus. That same year the band would achieve its biggest claim to fame when they were immortalized on film and record for their performance as part of the ‘The Last Pogo’ movie and soundtrack recording. But, by the following year, John Paul Young yearned for a more stable and reliable format to produce his music and went solo at which time he performed all his own instrumentation in a new set of recordings in 1980 entitled ‘The Life Of Ermie Scub’ which won a CASBY Award. The band reunited for The Edge’s brief resurrection and anniversary celebration April 26, 1981. Recordings from this performance were released as a live album in 1982 before the band split up for good. Patrick Gregory went on to become a member of Woods Are Full of Cuckoos and The Lawn; Vincent Carlucci would form Station Twang with Carl Tafel of Terraced Garden fame; John Paul Young is a successful actor in many Canadian television productions and has contributed to movie soundtracks such as ‘The Gate’. He has since resurrected the Cardboard Brains on several occasions for club dates in Toronto, initially to coincide with the John Paul Young And Cardboard Brains ‘best of’ compilation CD, and then in 2000 as a prelude to a possible new Cardboard Brains recording project. with notes from John Paul Young, Vince Carlucci, and Paul O’Connell.

His first release was in 1965 entitled “Chante Heigh Ho” on the Tournesol label. The song didn’t do much to propel his career. He worked on his writing and landed a bigger deal with Carrousel Records where he released five singles from 1967 through 1969. One more single “Notre Rendez-Vous” would be released on Vedettes Records. Carel changed his professional name to Jan Françoys (sometimes Jan François) playing keyboards at Montréal’s Chez Bourgetel Cocktail Lounge in the early ’70s where he’d record a live album. During his solo years Carel had also augmented his work schedule writing, arranging, and producing other artists such as Karo, Maxime, Les Makadams, Claude Philippe, Richard Audet, Gil Patrick, Serge Blouin, Norman Knight, and many others.

He learned to play guitar shortly thereafter and was soon performing in a band on weekends at dances and clubs in the Ottawa Valley,. It was at this time that he began to develop his songwriting skills but it wasn’t until a chance meeting with fellow songwriter Bruce Rawlins in 1969 that Carisse began to actively pursue a singer/songwriter career. The duo’s first break as songwriters was penning the song “Hello Mom” for the Mercey Brothers in 1971. The song topped the country and MOR charts across Canada for three weeks which gave the songwriters inspiration to pursue more work. They landed three tunes on the ‘Rowdyman’ soundtrack and Carisse performed four numbers in the movie itself. The Mercey’s called on the team again for a string of hit singles — “Who Wrote The Words” (1972), “Kentucky Turn Your Back” (1973), “Old Loves Never Die” (1976), and “If I Believed In Myself” (1977). Up until this point Carisse had remained holed-up in Ottawa working strictly on his songwriting skills, but in 1978 he joined Carroll Baker’s band, Tenderfoot, and toured throughout Canada and the UK the highlight of which was a stop at the Palladium in London, England. When he returned the Mercey Brothers decided to return the favour for Carisse’s continued hard work on their behalf and signed him to their own MBS Records. A string on singles was released throughout 1978 and early 1979, the best of which were compiled and released as Carisse’s debut album ‘The Story of the Year’. Every single from the album went Top-20 on the national charts with “Sparkle In Her Eyes” hitting #1. ‘The Story of the Year’ LP won nominations as ‘Album Of The Year’ at the 1979 Big Country Awards, the title track was nominated as ‘Single Of The Year’ and a nomination in the ‘Top Country Male Vocalist’ category. The momentum of several more singles and a high public profile touring with his own band, Tracks, landed him the ‘Male Vocalist’ win in 1980. 1981 saw the release of his second MBS album, ‘We Could Make Beautiful Music Together’, which won ‘Album of the Year’, and the single “Windship” won ‘Top Country Single of the Year’ while Carisse himself was a repeat winner in the ‘Male Vocalist’ category. He would repeat the latter win in 1982 to make it a hat trick. He was also nominated for a Juno Award in 1983 for ‘Male Country Vocalist’ as well. However, there had been no album in 1982, merely the single “Nevada”, due to the dismantling of the Mercey Brothers record label and a follow-up production deal with a US based company that went bankrupt after sending Carisse to Nashville left him in litigation for nearly 18 months. During his down time, Carisse to a swing at his other love, gospel, and finally released his next album featuring songs in that vein with 1983’s ‘A Gospel Gathering’ featuring an all-star guest list of Carroll Baker, Larry Mercey, Tracey Prescott and Lawanda Brown (from The Family Brown), Johnny Burke and Ted Daigle. This time the Country Music News voted him ‘Country Male Vocalist of the Year’. With a chance meeting during Country Music Week in Nashville with Savannah Records’ Brian Ferriman, Carisse had a new record deal by the end of 1983. His first album for the label was 1984’s ‘The Closest Thing To You’, which spawned two hit singles which both made the Top-20 in Canada and won ‘Male Vocalist Of The Year’ for the fourth year straight. The publishing company set up by Carisse and Rawlins also won ‘Music Publisher of the Year’ at the 1984 Academy Of Country Music Entertainment Awards. Carisse hit the road with a new edition of Tracks – Dusty King Jr. (bass), Steve Piticco (guitar), Sam Henry (drums) and the year was capped by Carisse receiving another nominational nod as ‘Country Male Vocalist’ at the Juno Awards. 1985 was a repeat performance — 5th ‘Male Country Vocalist’ Award at Canadian Country Music Awards; the single “Counting the I Love Yous” was voted ‘Song of the Year’; ‘Album of the Year’ for ‘The Closest Thing To You’. He also received a Citation Award as ‘Producer of the Year’ and Tracks were honoured as ‘Backing Band Of The Year’ with guitarist Steve Piticco getting the award for ‘Instrumentalist Of The Year’. 1985 closed with Carisse receiving his 9th PROCAN Certificate Of Honour for his “The Closest Thing To You” single which was the most performed country song in Canada in 1984. The capper was another hit single (the fourth) called “Sweet Blue” which went Top-10 on the country charts and found Carisse crossing over onto Adult Contemporary playlists. He also received his third nomination as ‘Outstanding Country Male Vocalist’. Carisse finally released his next album, ‘None of the Feeling Is Gone’, in the summer of 1986 and its hit single “Love Sweet Love” which peaked at #6 on the national charts. This was followed up with a tour featuring an expanded line-up of backing band Tracks and another win at the first ever broadcast of the Canadian Country Music Awards for ‘Male Vocalist of The Year’. A second single followed. In 1987, following a win for Carisse and Rawlins as the Canadian Music Publisher’s Association ‘Country Composers of The Year’, Rawlings died of cancer. The loss of Carisse’s long-time songwriting partner was devastating to the performer and it hardened his resolve to continue his exposure of the duo’s songwriting. In 1989 Carisse spent time in Nashville collaborating with some of country’s top songwriters (Carl Jackson, Don Pfrimmer, Dickey Lee, Tommy Rocco, Jim Rushing), with the results appearing on the album ‘That Was A Long Time Ago’. It would be Carisse’s final recording as a major artist on the Canadian music scene. Carisse’s remarkable career in Canadian country music was formally acknowledged in 1989 with his induction into the Ottawa Valley Country Music Hall Of Fame. During the 1990’s, he let his music take more of a back seat in his life, and although he continued to make occasional guest appearances on the Ottawa Valley music scene, and continued to pursue his craft as a songwriter (most notably teaming with local songwriter Jim Cass), he also found a new interest as a dog breeder, working alongside his wife Aija in their very successful business, as well as participating in various capacities for the Ottawa Kennel Club Association. Carisse died May 22, 2005 in Ottawa of cancer at the age of 62. Terry is survived by his wife Aija (Skadins) and sons Stephen, Chris and Sean and a brother, Stephen. He was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall Of Fame in 2006; Bow Park in Nepean was renamed Terry Carisse Park in September 2006. with notes from Ron Neville.\n\nSingles\n\n1975 The Spirit Lives On/[split w/BOBBY LALONDE] (Boy Scouts of Canada) BSC-75E\n\n1976 Been Thinking/Leaving (Rejoice) RJ-106\n\n1978 Lonely Highway Blues/Velvet Nights (MBS) MBS-1001\n\n1979 The Story of the Year/The Story of the Year (Album Preview) (MBS) MBS-1013\n\n1979 Time To Go/The Story of the Year (Album Preview) (MBS) MBS-1015\n\n1979 Sparkle In Your Eyes/The Story of the Year (Album Preview) (MBS) MBS-1018\n\n1980 All Her Letters /The Story of the Year (Album Preview) (MBS) MBS-1023\n\n1980 We Could Make Beautiful Music Together/Cowboy Corner (MBS) MBS-1024\n\n1981 Windship/If Dreams Do Come True (MBS) MBS-1029\n\n1981 Ode To An Outlaw’s Lady/Your Eyes Don’t Lie To Me (MBS) MBS-1032\n\n1982 Coming Undone Again/If Dreams Do Come True (MBS) MBS-1034\n\n1982 Nevada/[same] (MBS) MBS-1037\n\n1982 We Could Make Beautiful Music Together/Cowboy Corner (MBS) MBS-1060\n\n1983 Love Blind/[same] (Cara) CR-1001\n\n1984 The Closest Thing To You/Southern Star Plantation (Savannah/Quality) SRS-825\n\n1984 Two Broken Hearts/Runaway Dreams (Savannah/Quality) SRS-827\n\n1985 Counting the I Love You’s/Love Blind (Savannah/Quality) SRS-829\n\n1985 Sweet Blue/Hallelujah I’m Ready (Savannah/Quality) SRS-833\n\n1985 I Wish I Had You Here Again (Savannah/Quality)\n\n1986 Love Sweet Love/When It Comes To Love (Savannah/Quality) SRS-841\n\n1986 It Must Be October/Give In (Savannah/Quality) SRS-848\n\n1987 Old Photographs/Postcards (Savannah/Quality) SRS-852\n\n1987 Starting Forever Again/Love Sweet Love (Savannah/Quality) SRS-858\n\n1987 None of the Feeling is Gone/[split w/ Michelle Wright] (Savannah/Quality) SRS-860\n\n1987 Give In/Starting Forever Again (Savannah/Quality) SRS-864\n\n1987 I Thought Leaving Would Be Easy/Give In (Savannah/Quality) SRS-869\n\n1989 Loveproof Heart/[same] (Savannah/Quality) PRO-648\n\n1989 What About Her (Savannah/Quality)\n\n1990 The Start of Something New [duet w/ TRACEY BROWN] (Savannah/Quality)\n\n1990 Is Your Heart Taken (Savannah/Quality)\n\n1991 That Was A Long Time Ago (Savannah/Quality)\n\n1992 My Old Man (BMG)\n\n1994 Daddy’s Girl (Hillcrest)\n\n2005 Because of You\n\nas RAY GRIFF & TERRY CARISSE\n\n1988 Moonlight/[same] (WEA) PRO-653\n\nAlbums\n\n1978 Terry Carisse (Radio Canada) RCI-490\n\n1979 The Story Of The Year (MBS) MBS-2002\n\n1981 We Could Make Beautiful Music Together (MBS) MBS-2005\n\n1983 A Gospel Gathering (Cara) CR-2001\n\n1984 The Closest Thing To You (Savannah/Quality) SRL-9822\n\n1986 None of the Feeling is Gone (Savannah/Quality) SRL-9827\n\n1989 That Was A Long Time Ago (Savannah/Quality) SRL-9835\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1988 “Silver Bells” on ‘Reveillon’ (WEA) CDP-632\n\nCARMEN\n\nYé-Yé singer from Québec.\n\nSingles\n\n1968 Les Pantalons/Ma Gaspesie (Télédisc) TD-61\n\nCARLSON, Ralph\n\nBorn: November 6, 1940 in Montréal, Québec.\n\nDied: October 10, 2002 in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nCanadian singer-songwriter, and guitarist was born in Montréal but raised in New Brunswick.

White, O’Toole, McLaughlin, Grew and McManus comprised the original line-up, but Mike Feeney, Johnny Patterson and Bob Lewis joined soon after. Some of the members were lost in front of Maple Leaf Gardens in downtown Toronto one night which is located on Carlton Street and so they decided to adopt the name as the Carlton Danceband. This name was later changed to the more familiar Showband. After two popular singles for Quality Records (“The Merry Ploughboy” and “Up Went Nelson”), their self-titled debut appeared in 1966 on CASL Records. The following year, they became the houseband for CTV’s ‘Pig and Whistle Show’; a gig they would maintain for ten year until the show went off the air. 1973 saw the Best of the Carlton Showband Volume I. They recorded such an abundance of new material in those twelve months that a second volume was released in 1974 along with new vocalist Gregory Donaghey. Singles stormed the airwaves – “March of the Maple Leaf”, “Biddy McGaw”, “Half An Hour Later In Newfoundland”, and “Mother”. The next decade wouldn’t be as kind but they found their niche in TV advertising, selling albums on K-Tel and Quality Records. But the touring never stopped. The group retired in 1996 after being together 33 years and releasing 34 albums but revived a new version of the band that toured Casinos and Fairs in 2010.\n\nSingles\n\n1966 The Merry Ploughboy [w/ARLENE KING]/Reilly’s Daughter (CASL/Quality) 2106X\n\n1966 Up Went Nelson/Quiet Land of Erin (CASL/Quality) 2107X\n\n1966 Bonnie Wee Jennie McCall/Come Back To Erin (RCA Victor Canada International) 57-3418\n\n1968 White Wash Gable/Black Velvet Band (RCA Victor Canada International) 57-3451\n\n1968 March of the Maple Leaf (RCA)\n\n1968 Westmeath Bachelor (RCA)\n\n1971The Leprechaun/Myles Song (RCA) 75-1057\n\n1972 Roll it Around In Your Mind/Jigs (RCA) 75-1086\n\n1972 Red Haired Mary/Will Ye Go Lassie Go (RCA) 75-1109\n\n1973 Old Johnny Bucka/Waitress Waitress (RCA) SPS-45-104\n\n1974 There’s Nothing Like A Newfoundlander/March Hare (RCA) PB-50024\n\n1975 Any Dream Will Do/Mike’s Kathleen (RCA) PB-50044\n\n1975 The Gypsy/Amazing Grace (RCA) PB-50077\n\n1975 Biddy McGraw/Maids When You’re Young (RCA) PB-50245\n\n1975 Sadie the Cleaning Lady/My Song for the Miner (RCA) PB-50259\n\n1976 Harpers Ferry/Love Is Teasing (RCA) PB-50156\n\n1976 One Up On The World/Belfast City (RCA) PB-50229\n\n1977 More Than Yesterday/Laughing Policeman (RCA) PB-50386\n\n1977 Christmas In Killarney/Silent Night (RCA) PB-50403\n\n1977 Here We Go Again Celeidhe/A Melody You Will Never Forget (RCA) PB-50405\n\n1977 1/2 Hour Later In Newfoundland/Young And Beautiful (RCA) PB-50467\n\n1978 More Than Yesterday/Any Dream Will Do (RCA Golden Greats) GB-50486\n\n1978 Hard Times (Comin’ Down Again)/The Ring Your Mother Wore (RCA) PB-50531\n\n1979 He Believes In Me/Hunting the Wren (RCA) PB-50541\n\n1980 Dear Old Donegal /Christy’s Reel (RCA) PB-50561\n\n1982 Three Steps To Heaven/Christmas Time In Innishfree (CSB) WRC3-1946\n\n1983 Mother /Among the Wicklow Hills (CSB) WRC3-4498\n\n1983 The Bangin’ In Ye’r Head/River Rat John (CSB) CSB-1001\n\n1984 What’s A Nice Guy (Like Me Doin’ In a Place Like This) (CSB) CSB-8402\n\nAlbums\n\n1966 We’re Off To Dublin On The Green (Mala – US) LP-4004\n\n1966 The Carlton Showband (RCA) PCS-1173\n\n1967 A Night At the Pub with the Carlton Showband (RCA) KCL1-0025\n\n1968 The Carlton Showband On Tour (RCA) PCS-1203\n\n1969 The Carlton Showband At The Pig And Whistle (ARC) ACS-5022\n\n1970 Time Gentlemen Please (RCA) KCL1-0037\n\n1971 Best Of Carlton Showband (RCA-Camden) CAS-2483\n\n1971 Carlton Showband Special CAS-2597\n\n1972 Sing Irishman Sing (RCA-Camden) CASX-2539\n\n1973 If You’re Irish (Carlton Showband By Request)\n\n1974 Any Dream Will Do (RCA) KCL1-0083\n\n1975 Best Of The Carlton Showband Volume II (RCA) KCL1-7002\n\n1975 Carlton Showband First Choice\n\n1976 One Up On The World (RCA) KXL1-0142\n\n1977 Best Of The Carlton Showband Volume III (RCA) KNL1-0218\n\n1977 20 Gospel Favourites (RCA) KSL1-7064\n\n1978 Sixteen Most Requested Songs (RCA) KSL1-7067\n\n1979 Hard Times (RCA) ACL1-0333\n\n1980 Back To The Sod (RCA) APL1-0362\n\n1982 Three Steps To Heaven (World) WRC1-2634\n\n1985 Reflections (World) WRC1-4047\n\n1986 We Wish You A Merry Christmas (Carlton Showband) WRC1-4774\n\n1988 25th Anniversary (CSB) CSBLP-02588\n\n1990 Catch The Spirit (CSB) CSBCD-00190\n\n1993 25 All-Time Favourites\n\n2016 Happiness Is Being Irish (Music From the TV Series “The Pig & Whistle”) [reissue] (Unidisc) AGEK-2655\n\nCARNATIONS, The\n\nNathan Rekker (guitar, vocals) / Patrick Conan (drums) / Steve Krecklo (vocals, guitar) / Thomas D’Arcy (lead vocals, bass)\n\nToronto band featuring former All Systems Go! member Thomas D’Arcy; Patrick Conan would go on to join Tricky Woo and Land Of Kush; Thomas D’Arcy would go on to Jakalope, Small Sins, and White Hot Guilt.\n\nSingles\n\n2000 Scream & Yell/Sundays//[split w/NERO] [7″] (Alphabetty – UK) MSF2\n\nAlbums\n\n1999 A Return To Melody (Sycamore) SYC-002\n\n2001 The Carnations [6-song EP] (Ductape/Alphabetty) DCD-007-2\n\n2003 In Good Time (FACTOR/Ductape/Universal) DCD-010-2\n\nCARNIVAL\n\nTim Hallman (piano) / Don Pellow (organ) / Bill Wells (bass, saxophone) / Bob Brownscombe (lead guitar) / Mike T. Oberle (drums)\n\nHallman and Oberle were from Waterloo while Pellow, Brownscombe, and Wells were from Woodstock. In 1968, out of the ashes of The Flying Dutchman Drum and Bugle Corp., the band settled in Kitchener-Waterloo as The Trendsetters. Hallman, stayed in high school making the band a four-piece. That year they played on CTV’s ‘After 4’ show in Toronto. They would do five of these appearances and from that show won the audition for ‘It’s Happening’ starring Robbie Lane to replace his backing band The Disciples. The producer of the TV show, Mike Steele, wanted five bodies on the stage, so Tim Hallman got the call and walked straight into a national TV contract. The production, a 26 week run, was standard for its day. The Carnival taped at CFTO Studios on 13 alternating Fridays (two shows per session). By this time the band lived in Don Mills, Ontario and pre-recorded the backing music at Chelsea Sound on Mount Pleasant Ave. in Toronto – a four-track facility – where it was necessary to pre-record between 18-20 tracks every two weeks as backing tracks for feature artists as a means of keeping up with the pace of the show. The performances on the show featured Robbie Lane singing live while the band, now calling themselves The Carnival, lip-synced – vocally and instrumentally. On occasion the band became a ‘featured act’ on the show. The young band got to meet, among others, Andy Kim, Eddie Floyd (“Knock on Wood”), and Grant Smith (minus his band The Power). They were working towards releasing an album (tentatively titled ‘Keil Heil Kelly’) when the band split up. It wasn’t long before there was a reformation under the new name Magic Circus with Oberle (drums), Pellow (organ), Hallman (keyboards, trombone) and new recruits Allen Spencer (bass), and Alan Palmquist (guitar). They had their own Vox sound system and played all around southern Ontario from 1971 through 1973. They even did a beer commercial where Oberle’s drum kit was flown to the top of a mountain for the filming; Hallman enrolled at Queen’s University where he earned his Bachelor of Music degree and taught school music. He now plays around Kingston, Ontario and occasionally teaches; Pellow became an architect and lives near Milton, Ontario and sticks mainly to church organ; Wells was last known to work for the former Ontario Hydro Company at the Bruce Nuclear Plant near Southampton; Oberle recorded and toured around the Ontario bar circuit with Ian Thomas for many years and would become leader and manager of The Lulu’s Roadhouse House Band in Kitchener. They are still playing between 35 and 50 corporate gigs a year as well as off-shoots of duos, trios and up to an 11-piece band with horn line-up; Brownscombe worked as a printing press mechanic and operator in Calgary and continued playing guitar and recording songs as a hobbyist. He died of a heart attack January 21, 1997. with notes from Tim Hallman, Michael Woodhead, Marti Shollenburg, Alan Palmquist, Michael T. Oberle.\n\nSingles\n\n1968 Doot Doot Doo Doo/Dark Star (Columbia) C4-2782\n\n1968 Out Of My Life/Four Seasons (Columbia) C4-2789\n\n1968 Hi Ho Silver Lining/I’m Going Home Tomorrow (Columbia) C4-2816\n\nCARNIVAL CONNECTION\n\nAllan Nicholls (vocals) / Bill Hill (guitar) / J.P.

Their new identity would be short lived, however, following the low-charting single on Capitol called “Poster Man” (hitting No.67 in December 1968). The band split up in early 1969. Nicholls would join Mashmakhan briefly before heading off to New York and then Los Angeles for a successful career on stage and in film/TV. He currently lives in the United Arab Emirates; Hill went on to form Freedom North; Lauzon joined the band Life and has had a modest solo career through the years. with notes from Shawn Nagy.

Soon they teamed up with Just Alice front man Nick Sinopoli for gigs at Lee’s Palace during nights that Ground Zero wasn’t hosting the club’s Sunday night jams. Sinopoli mentioned The Carpet Frogs’ existence to Canadian rocker Greg Godovitz (Goddo) who, after seeing them one night on his way home from a gig, wrangled his way into the band. The Carpet Frogs soon became the Lee’s Palace Sunday jam band and hosted there through much of 1994. With an eye on doing more than playing cover tunes, the group set about recording their debut album, ‘Frog Curry’, at Quest Studio in Oshawa. The album was released on Godovitz’s indie label, Nile Records. By Christmas of 1994, they had released the first single and video – “Christmas All Over the World” (which still receives rotation on MuchMusic during the holidays). The album was shopped internationally and immediately picked up for stateside distribution "
