        "text": "What do they look like?\n\nCarpet Pythons come in all different shapes and sizes. They come in a range of colours from olive green to brown or black. They also sport a variety of patterns including diamond shapes, bands, rings, splotches and stripes. These are usually a lighter white, cream or gold colour. The carpet python can grow up to 4 metres long, but are usually around 2 metres.\n\nWhere are they found?\n\nCarpet Pythons are probably the most commonly seen snake in suburban backyards, the most familiar being the Carpet Python in Queensland and the closely relate sub-species called the Diamond Python in eastern NSW and Victoria.\n\nFast Facts:\n\nSummer is python breeding time, and after the female has laid up to 15 eggs, she coils herself around them and shivers – vibrating all her muscles to keep the eggs warm. She won’t eat during the whole 60-day incubation period.\n\nSnakes can continue to grow for as long as they live. That’s why they can reach massive lengths: the largest Australian snake, the Amethystine Python from North Queensland can exceed 8 metres, and is one of the biggest snakes in the world.\n\nCarpet Python – the full story\n\nThere are 15 species of python in Australia, making up a quarter of all the snakes that live here. Carpet Pythons are probably the most commonly seen snake in suburban backyards, the most familiar being the Carpet Python in Queensland and the closely relate sub-species called the Diamond Python in eastern NSW and Victoria.\n\nSummer is python breeding time, and after the female has laid up to 15 eggs, she coils herself around them and shivers – vibrating all her muscles to keep the eggs warm. During the whole 60-day incubation period, she won’t eat.\n\nAfter her eggs hatch, a female Carpet Python will have lost up to half her body weight and immediately starts to search for food. One of the best places for a Carpet Python to find food is in your roof.\n\nIf a Carpet Python is in your roof, it’s looking for rodents to eat. If you can cope with the idea of a snake in the attic, it’s best to leave them to it. Chances are, once they have cleaned out your roof of rats or mice, they will move on.\n\nPythons are shy and non-venomous, although it’s best to keep your distance as their curved backward facing teeth do give a painful bite.\n\nTo discourage Carpet Pythons, keep the house free of rats and mice. Keep your chicken coop clean as dirty or vermin infested coops can attract snakes. They are not interested in the eggs or chickens, but the rats and mice.\n\nReinforce your chicken house to exclude snakes and rodents. Cover it completely with mesh no greater than 12 mm square. It’s amazing the tiny holes that pythons can squeeze themselves through,\n\nDid you know?\n\nUnlike mammals, snakes continue to grow for as long as they live. That’s why they can reach massive lengths: the largest Australian snake, the Amethystine Python from North Queensland can exceed 8 metres, and is one of the biggest snakes in the world.\n\nTip\n\nPythons moult regularly, and the roofs of some old houses are full of shed skins. If you find a skin, a snake expert at your local or state Museum may be able to identify the species."
