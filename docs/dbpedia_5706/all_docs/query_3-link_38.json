        "text": "Amphibian\n\ncold-blooded vertebrate of the class Amphibia, comprising frogs, toads, newts, salamanders and caecilians. Typically the larvae are aquatic (dependent on water) and breathe using gills whereas the adults are terrestrial or semi-terrestrial (land based), breathing by lungs and/or through their moist skin.\n\nAmplexus\n\nthe mating embrace of frogs and toads where the smaller male clasps on to the larger female ‘piggy back’ style.\n\nAnuran\n\nAmphibians without tails (i.e. frogs and toads).\n\nARG\n\nAmphibian and Reptile Group (county-based group of experts and enthusiasts).\n\nCaudata\n\namphibians with tails (e.g. newts).\n\nCroaks\n\nemail news bulletins from Froglife (also the noise made by frogs and toads).\n\nDaphnia\n\nwater fleas (common food for tadpoles).\n\nEft\n\nthe young of newts; usually describes newts that have just completed their metamorphosis from tadpoles and have left the water.\n\nExotic\n\na species not native to this country (also called non-native or introduced).\n\nFrogalogue\n\ndirectory of Froglife merchandise.\n\nFroglet\n\nyoung frog that has just completed its metamorphosis from a tadpole and left the pond.\n\nFroglife Friend\n\npaying supporter of Froglife.\n\nHibernacula\n\nplace for amphibians and reptiles to spend the winter; normally comprises of logs or brick rubble covered with soil.\n\nHibernation\n\nperiod of time spent dormant (over the winter).\n\nLarva\n\nthe immature form or life-stage; used to describe newt tadpoles.\n\nMetamorphosis\n\na profound change in form from one life stage to the next e.g. a tadpole developing into a frog.\n\nNatterchat\n\nFroglife’s bi-annual newsletter.\n\nNewtlet\n\na newt that has just completed its metamorphosis from a tadpole and left the water; sometimes called an eft.\n\nParotoid glands\n\na pair of glands on the backs of toads, usually behind the eye, which produce a toxin; this toxin makes them distasteful to predators.\n\nPond-dipping\n\nfun, educational activity to see what’s living in a pond; a net is swept through the water and the contents tipped into a water-filled tray to get a closer look.\n\nRed-leg\n\nmisleading name given to frog-disease ranavirus.\n\nRefuge\n\nflat easily-warmed object a reptile can hide underneath which can be lifted to get a closer look, for example a piece of slate, a square of corrugated tin or an old carpet.\n\nReptile\n\ncold-blooded vertebrate of the class Reptilia, comprising snakes, lizards, turtles and crocodiles, and various extinct members including the dinosaurs. They have an external covering of scales and usually lay eggs.\n\nSpawn\n\namphibian eggs.\n\nTadpole\n\nthe aquatic young of amphibians, particularly frogs and toads.\n\nToad Patrol\n\ngroup of volunteers who help toads as they migrate across roads to their breeding ponds.\n\nToadlet\n\nyoung toad that has just completed its metamorphosis from a tadpole and left the pond.\n\nToadpole\n\nsometimes used to describe toad tadpoles.\n\nViviparous\n\ndescribes the act of incubating eggs internally and giving birth to live young rather than laying eggs externally. Common lizards, sometimes called viviparous lizards, do this, as do adders and smooth snakes.\n\nVocal sac\n\npouch(es) of skin under an amphibians chin; these are inflated in order to make noises to attract a mate.\n\nWildlife and Countryside Act\n\nlaw protecting amphibians and reptiles (the level of protection depends on the species).\n\nWildlife pond\n\npond kept solely for the use of native wildlife; it will usually not contain fish and have no pump/filter/aerator."
