        "text": "PANAMA CITY BEACH — Production is winding up on “East Side Story,” a motion picture recently filmed here, and programs shot in Bay County are hitting the airwaves regularly. Now a production company owned by NBC TV weatherman Al Roker is looking for locals to star in a few new reality TV shows.\n\nThese are just the latest in what seems to be an accelerating pattern, according to Bay County Film Commissioner Julie Gordon: The television and movie industry has discovered (or possibly re-discovered) Panama City Beach and the surrounding county.\n\n>>See behind the scenes video from filming of ‘East Side Story’<\n\n“Honey Boo Boo, ‘Jersey Shore’ appearances, Kimora Lee, the Housewives of everywhere, ‘Gossip Girls,’ ‘Real World’ — the list is endless,” Gordon said.\n\n“Born & Raised,” an independent film that shot in St. Andrews neighborhoods and businesses is wrapping up its year on the festival circuit, where it has garnered seven awards. It’s entering the distribution phase, Gordon said, and may have a “red carpet” release locally this autumn.\n\n>>See the Born & Raised movie trailer<<\n\n“History Channel loves the area for both the Navy and Air Force bases, also the richness of Indian lore and the diving spots,” she said, noting that the “Dream Wrecks” show is a “repeat customer.”\n\nIn just the last few years, an amazing number of productions have shot in the Bay County area, including: “Banana Trip,” a Florida State University film short; “Preachers’ Daughters” for Lifetime network; “Last Call Food Brawl” on Destination America (aired in June); multiple documentaries for Discovery (including “Myth Busters” and “Dr. H Investigates”); four segments on “Waiting for a Baby” on Oxygen channel; country singer Luke Bryan’s videos and Spring Break specials; and lots of foreign television, including six to eight shows every year with German, French, Canadian and Japanese networks.\n\nDiscover America shot its “Last Call Food Brawl” at Schooners earlier this year, featuring a contest between four area chefs, including Dee Brown of Dee’s Hangout, Rob Burgess of Saltwater Grill, Yi Lynne Weber of E Street Café food truck, and Tom Newberry of Outlaws Barbecue.\n\nAdd to that numerous print and television commercials for Visit Florida; fashion photo shoots by Jantzen Beach, Levis, Pottery Barn, Longaberger Baskets, American Girl and more; A&E documentary segments; pharmaceutical commercials filmed in McKenzie Park and Camp Helen; and national ads for Polaris, Sea Doo and other watercraft shot in St. Andrew Bay and at Shell Island.\n\n“Travel Channel loves us,” Gordon said, listing shows that filmed here including “Florida Beach Weekend,” “Best FL Beaches,” “Best USA Beaches,” “Best Spring Breaks,” “Spring Break 24/7,” and others. “It is not all beach-related, but obviously, (the beach) often sparks the draw, then they see the marshes, the marinas, the bayous, etc.”\n\nHGTV has been to Bay County four times in the past two years. A “House Hunters” episode shot in Panama City Beach will run on the HGTV channel on Aug. 24 at 10 p.m. and overnight at 1 a.m. (it originally aired July 19). Check out the episode to see if the hunters chose a home in Panama City Beach or one in Destin.\n\nIn addition, the Travel Channel’s new “Magic Man” series premieres Aug. 11, and its Aug. 18 episode features tricks performed in Bay County by series star JB Benn, a mind-blowing street magician. According to the episode description, Benn “shockingly contorts an iPhone by twisting it in half, and later completes a death-defying stunt as he blindly drinks cups of liquid, unaware of which one contains poisonous flammable lamp oil.”\n\n“We were lucky to get to shoot on Tyndall Air Force Base as well as loads of beachy spots,” Gordon said. “Should be a great showcase for us.”\n\nGordon said she is still getting referrals from Lion’s Gate, the company that produced 2003’s “Secondhand Lions,” which filmed beach scenes on Shell Island.\n\n>>See the trailer for Secondhand Lions<<\n\nGordon began promoting the area as a film location 16 years ago, and 12 years ago the Bay County Commission endorsed the efforts of her film office. The local film office is now credited with between $5 million and $11 million annually in local economic impact, Gordon said.\n\nPotential New Productions:\n\nAl Roker Entertainment, based in New York City, thinks the forecast is good for Bay County locals hoping to make a splash on TV.\n\n“We’re currently casting people for some new documentary television shows we’re developing in your area,” said ARE spokeswoman Asia Boostani. She said the company was hoping to cast for four shows:\n\n“While a lot of people know Al, they might not be aware that, for years, our production company has been producing prime time television series for major US networks,” she said.\n\nFormed in 1994, Al Roker Entertainment has created programs for The Food Network, NBC, The History Channel, TRU TV, Animal Planet, GAC, The Weather Channel, Discovery, Spike, A&E, and others.\n\nDescribed as “a hands-on business owner,” Roker is involved in the selection, creation and development of the productions, and “focuses on programs that are honest, high quality, and in most cases, contain organic storytelling,” according to promotional materials.\n\nRoker said the shows bear his name, and he wants to create programs parents can watch with their children.\n\nTo apply, simply email a little bit about yourself, and include a few photos and any relevant links, as well as a good time and phone number to reach you. A casting producer may be in touch. Send emails to casting@alroker.com.

The film features 11 performers who were past winners and runners-up on the American and Canadian versions of the TV competition, “So You Think You Can Dance.”\n\nThe movie shot earlier this year in several Bay County locations including Pier Park, Club La Vela, Gulf Coast State College, Shores of Panama, and Arnold High School, where 800 extras turned out for a sequence on the school’s athletic field.\n\nEditing is in progress on the film, with a targeted release in early 2014.\n\nGordon recently got to watch a “rough cut” of “East Side Story” — not yet the finished version of the film, but close enough to see that it’s “two full hours of beautiful promos” for Panama City Beach, she said. Besides dramatic sequences shot in area hotels and night spots, the film features montages of dancing throughout Panama City Beach’s most treasured sites.\n\n“It is a positively beautiful tribute to the magical area in which we live,” Gordon said. “The passion of dance is felt throughout the piece and makes you want to stand up in your seat and start moving. The locals will be proud, and the rest of the world will want to see this ‘real life’ movie set, where we call home.”\n\nMovies Shot Locally\n\n(Hit the links to view movie trailers)\n\nFrogs (1972) filmed in Panama City Beach and Eden Gardens State Park; stars Sam Elliott, Ray Milland and Joan Van Ark; director George McCowan\n\nCondominium (1980) filmed at Pinnacle Port, Panama City Beach in 1979; stars Barbara Eden and Dan Haggerty; director Sidney Hayers\n\nLittle Sweetheart (1989) filmed in East Point; stars John Hurt; screenwriter/director Anthony Simmons\n\nGrand Isle (1991) filmed in Apalachicola and Destin, as well as New Orleans; stars Kelly McGillis; director Mary Lambert\n\nRuby in Paradise (1993) filmed in Panama City Beach; stars Ashley Judd; writer/director Victor Nunez\n\nUlee’s Gold (1997) filmed in Wewahitchka, Apalachicola and Port St. Joe; stars Peter Fonda; writer/director Victor Nunez\n\nThe Truman Show (1998) filmed in Seaside; stars Jim Carrey; director Peter Weir\n\nCoastlines (2002) filmed in Carrabelle and Sopchoppy; stars Timothy Olyphant and Josh Brolin; writer/director Victor Nunez\n\nSecondhand Lions (2003) filmed a segment on Shell Island; stars Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Haley Joel Osment; writer/director Tim McCanlies\n\nThe Match (2009) filmed in Apalachicola and Tallahassee; stars Christina Bach; director Alexander Lau; writers Lau and Kyle Arrington\n\nBorn & Raised (2012) filmed in the historic St. Andrews area of Panama City; director Joshua Dragge; writer/star Nick Loritsch\n\nEast Side Story (2014) filmed in Panama City Beach; stars Witney Carson, Chehon Wespi-Tschopp, Jordan Clark; writer/producer/director David Winters\n\nIn addition, underwater scenes for several movies were filmed at Wakulla Springs near Crawfordville over the years, including: “Tarzan’s Secret Treasure” (1941), “Tarzan’s New York Adventure” (1942), “Creature from the Black Lagoon” (1954), “Night Moves” (1975), “Joe Panther” (1976), “Airport ’77” (1977), “Every Little Girl’s Dream” (2002) and the short film “Wakulla” (2008)."
