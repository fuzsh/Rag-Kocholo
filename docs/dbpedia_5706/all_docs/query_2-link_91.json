They will identify the main entry points, other entry points, and potential entry points for effective raccoon control. Customized options will be presented based on your specific property structure. The primary method for raccoon removal involves the use of a one-way door. This door allows raccoons to exit but prevents re-entry. Once the raccoon leaves, the door is replaced with screening to block re-entry from the same area. If there are raccoon babies involved, a one-way door is not used. Technicians physically remove the babies and place them in an insulated box until their mother relocates them to a new den individually. When trapping is necessary, raccoons are relocated within a maximum distance of 1 kilometer per Ontario Law.\n\nA prevention method is employed to prevent raccoons from accessing weak points or potential entry points. This involves the use of galvanized steel mesh, a durable material that effectively prevents raccoons from chewing through and accessing these areas. We offer all sorts of extermination and pest control services if you have other bug or rodent problems as well.\n\nIf you are searching for Toronto raccoon removal, contact Addison Pest Control at (416) 628-6963 or use our online form.

Cameron fumugated the backyard and listened to my concerns and sprayed it thoroughly. Cameron and Darren came back a week after to spray the inside for preventative. Both of them were professional and communicated very well. The company overall was very patient with me and answered all my questions! They are pricey but well worth it!!!
