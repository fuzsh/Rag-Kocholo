        "text": "BEFORE\n\nSeveral years ago, an episode of The Simpsons featured Bart Simpson (in the company of Homer, of course) standing in front of a stage at a county fair, watching Bachman Turner Overdrive. As BTO plowed through a version of Takin' Care of Business, Bart turned to Homer and asked, \"Who are those pleasant old men?\" This naturally prompted a defence from Homer, but for me, the damage had been done.\n\nI still love classic rock, and will undoubtedly wail along to Stairway to Heaven till my dying day. But honestly, the music of Randy Bachman and especially Burton Cummings (above), be it Guess Who fare, BTO or Cummings's solo material, has been so beaten to death in this country that if I am forced to listen to These Eyes one more time, I may poke my own out.DURING\n\nNot everyone agrees with me. Despite massive competition for the entertainment dollar on Friday night, a crowd of 10,000 or so came out to Toronto's Molson Amphitheatre to revel in the huge slice of Sugar Maple pie called the Bachman Cummings Band. And while a large percentage of the crowd could well have been part of the audience at Woodstock, there were a surprising number of younger folk.\n\nAnd it seemed that both the 62-year-old Bachman and the 58-year-old Cummings may agree with the tired-song assessment. One might figure that both American Woman and These Eyes would have been saved for the set's climax. Instead, they were both trotted out within the first 10 minutes.\n\nMost of the best action was reserved for songs that were not quite as well remembered. Backed by engaging local band the Carpet Frogs, Cummings led the septet through solid, up-tempo versions of numbers such as Hand Me Down World, Albert Flasher and Star Baby. For his part, Bachman offered up some characteristically splendid guitar work on both BTO rockers such as Let It Ride and Hey You, and more jazz-influenced (he gave a nice tribute to mentor Lenny Breau) numbers such as Lookin' Out for Number One.\n\nAFTER\n\nEarly on in the performance, Cummings said that this show was about \"straight ahead rock and roll, no thinking, just tapping of the toes, tapping of the feet and snapping of the fingers.\"\n\nAnd I must confess, by the fifth or sixth number ( Clap for the Wolfman), various of my body parts were spasmodically jerking about in time to the music. They pretty much stayed that way.\n\nWhen all was said and done, they won, again. Damn you, pleasant old men!\n\nThe Bachman Cummings Band performs in Ottawa tonight, Kitchener, Ont., tomorrow and Hamilton on June 29."
