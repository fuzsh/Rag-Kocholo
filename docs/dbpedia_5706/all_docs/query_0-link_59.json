        "text": "Comedian Sandra Battaglini is appearing in her newest solo show Classy Lady, June 14 through 24 at Alumnae Theatre, 70 Berkley St. The play chronicles Battaglini’s rise to ladyhood – easy enough for some, but not so for this sharp-witted, opinionated Italian-Canadian traditionalist.\n\nBattaglini joined The Second City Training Centre in 1999, and fell in love with improvisational comedy and character invention. Since then she has been a clown, and done Vaudeville-style stand-up and sketch comedy. She has written and starred in several one-woman comedy shows, and collaborated with many of the city’s top comedians. She won a Canadian Comedy Award for her previous show Hard Headed Woman, which played to sold-out audiences. Find out more about this offbeat comedian at sandrabattaglini.com.\n\nTickets for Classy Lady are $25, and are available from box office at 416-591-1417, or online at brownpapertickkets.com. Classy Lady runs Thursday to Sunday at 8 p.m.\n\n•\n\nThe inaugural Toronto Beaches Film Festival (TBFF) kicks off June 29 and 30 at The Fox Theatre, 2236 Queen St. E. The festival showcases independent filmmakers from around the world, including one from the Beach.\n\nOn June 29, beginning at 4 p.m., TBFF presents five family-friendly films. Shag Nation, by the Brittany Brothers, delves into the quirky subculture of shag dancing on the beaches of North and South Carolina. Breathe Life, a German film by director Antje Beyen, is a film documentary about surfing on the island of Oahu. A Strange Day in July, directed by Shantal Reich, is a magical film about dealing with tragedy. Surf, Sand and Silversides: the Californian Grumion, directed by Karen Martin, is a documentary about the spawning runs of this unique fish species. The Pipedreams Project, by Faroe Des Roches and Ryan Vandecasteyen, follows three kayakers on their epic two-month trip through the coastal waters of British Columbia, and their attempt to bring attention to the economic perils of an oil pipeline to the area.\n\nOn June 30, beginning at 11:30 a.m., TBFF presents Rest In Peace, directed by Fawaz Al-Matrouk. Two dead bodies lie in the street of occupied Kuwait in 1990. Day after day, everyone passes them by, afraid to stop – except one man. The film was inspired by true events.\n\nFollowing that is If I Should Fall, by former Beacher Brendon Culliton. Before deploying to Afghanistan, Canadian soldier Marc Diab makes a farewell video in case he “should fall.” Diab is killed by an improvised explosive device three weeks before coming home. His video ‘See You Tomorrow’ is played at his funeral delivering a message of comfort for family and friends. If I Should Fall is a story that celebrates a life lived and the honour and sacrifice of Canadian soldiers and their families in Canada’s Afghan War. This is Culliton’s first feature film. The 24-year-old grew up in the Beach, attended Neil McNeil High School, and lived and worked in the neighbourhood for several years before moving to London, Ontario.\n\nFor more information on the films visit the website at torontobeachesfilmfest.com. Tickets to the festival are $12 each or two for $20, and can be purchased at the Fox box office.\n\n•\n\nBrenda Carol and ClaireVoyance will be appearing at The Hothouse Cafe, 35 Church St. at Front, with two sets, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., on June 24 and 25 as part of the Toronto Jazz Festival.
