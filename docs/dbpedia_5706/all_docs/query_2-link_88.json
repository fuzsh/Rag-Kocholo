        "text": "These delicate looking little animals, weighing not much more than about 230 g, are in fact aggressively fearless, not at all reluctant to chase intruders many times their size. People get a kick out of seeing these squirrels stamping their feet, flicking their tails, and scolding vociferously in what seems like a paroxysm of rage. Anyone who has ventured near one of their food caches has been treated to this display. At times they get so agitated that they nearly fall out of the tree in their anxiety to see the interloper off.\n\nThey can often be seen chasing away larger Eastern Grey Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) who rarely put up a fight when confronted by these red terrors. A few years ago, I watched a red squirrel quite literally riding on the back of a grey squirrel and repeatedly biting its head. The grey was running, with difficulty, trying to shake the smaller animal from its back, with no success. I don’t know what the outcome was because the grey managed to climb a tree and vanish, still with the red on its back! Was this simply a matter of chasing away an intruder taken to extreme, or was there a more insidious intent, with the grey being viewed as food?\n\nSome years ago, I found a red squirrel feeding on the hindquarters of a grey squirrel (black phase). I never knew whether the grey squirrel had been killed by the red squirrel, or whether, as seems more likely, it had simply come across the animal already deceased and had taken advantage of a good source of protein (the flesh) and calcium and minerals (the bones). I watched this squirrel for a long time and it both ate the meaty part of the grey squirrel and gnawed on the bones. I have also seen red squirrels gnawing on bones of various animals, including those of a rabbit at the FWG.\n\nAs feisty as red squirrels are predatory on others, they themselves are preyed upon. At the FWG their biggest enemy is probably the domestic dog, but owls, hawks, weasels and foxes will also take these creatures. One year, a Short-tailed Weasel or Ermine (Mustela erminea) took up residence in the door frame of our Resource Centre. The mother moved in her 4 or 5 young, then went hunting for food. The first thing she brought back was a young red squirrel, considerably bigger than she was. Other volunteers at the garden have noticed red-tailed hawks eating red squirrels, and the Great Horned Owls that sometimes stay around, although primarily nocturnal, will supplement their diet with both red and grey squirrels.\n\nWe’ve also had them nesting in the roof of the Resource Centre which must have seemed like a wonderfully warm and capacious cavity! In the summer of 2006, I noticed three young red squirrels in a nest box in the Old Field. They were sharing quarters with two Grey Treefrogs (Hyla versicolor). I was sure the frogs would quickly be eaten, but they weren’t. The squirrels soon left the box and the treefrogs remained.\n\nNobody knows for sure how long a red squirrel lives, but it is estimated that in the wild it is probably one to three years. At the FWG, our population seems to be doing quite well and we have at least 10 individuals at present, living on our 5-hectare site. Their numbers have increased over the years as the garden has matured with trees, particularly evergreens, planted 15 years ago now a good size.\n\nTerritories\n\nAt the FWG, the red squirrels have set up very distinct and separate territories. In the wild, their population density would probably be much less than it is at the FWG. We have at least 10 (and perhaps more) red squirrels on 5 hectares. In wilderness areas, estimates show that there would likely be about one red squirrel for every 2 hectares. If that was true at FWG, we’d only have 2,5 squirrels! Red squirrels tend to have fairly small home ranges and at FWG this can be clearly seen. Once you have figured out where they are, you can almost guarantee that you’ll find them in the same location. Colour marking these animals in some way would be a good way of determining their range at FWG which is probably smaller than average given the density of animals.\n\nSome years ago, one enterprising pair moved into a bird box situated between two walnut trees and they, or their descendants, have been there ever since. In 2006, another squirrel took up residence under the red barn; it uses a nearby log as its dining table and the remains of walnuts and cones can be found there in abundance.\n\nWinter survival\n\nUnlike some animals, Red Squirrels do not hibernate, go into a state of torpor, or remain inactive for long periods of time during the winter months. Hoarding great amounts of food ensures their survival in even the coldest weather. In coniferous forests, where they depend on cone supplies to get them through the winter, many animals will die off when the cone crop is limited. And since cone crops are cyclical, Red Squirrels are more abundant in some years than others. However, in areas such as the FWG, where they have ready access to a greater variety of food, they are usually able to make it through the winter.\n\nIf you look under conifers at the FWG, you’ll find great piles of cones placed there by Red Squirrels. In their hurry to amass food, they will chew off branches holding the cones and let them fall to the ground. Every so often, they will descend to stack them into piles before going back to gather more. We have found these caches under Norway Spruce (Picea abies), White Spruce (Picea glauca), and Scotch Pine (Pinus sylvestris). Most are small, but in some cases I have found caches nearly 1 metre deep.\n\nIn addition to their industrious caching of food, Red Squirrels also develop a very thick fur coat. Look at the red squirrels in winter and see how much bushier their coats look compared to those in the warmer seasons. Most non-hibernating animals develop similarly thick coats, including our domestic dogs and cats when housed outdoors.\n\nThe third ingredient for surviving winter successfully involves having a snug, warm, dry place to spend the night and those rare days, when the weather is so fierce that even red squirrels don’t venture out. Cavities in trees afford much warmth, and around the FWG, nest boxes are good alternatives. Sometimes squirrels will create a winter den under a tree stump or fallen log. Whether they actually use underground dens seems open to debate. There is no doubt that they are quite comfortable going underground, and will make limited use of tunnels to store some food. During the winter months I have come across many holes leading underground (as opposed to snow tunnels which remain above ground), most with heaps of cone bracts around the entrance. Whether they are subterranean food chambers or places to spend the night, I am not sure. One way to discover this would be to dig up some of the tunnels and see what is there, but I wouldn’t have the heart to do this in winter in case they are being used as shelter from the cold."
