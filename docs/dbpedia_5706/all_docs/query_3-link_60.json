She attended Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts where she majored in biology and minored in studio art. She then moved on to complete graduate work in wildlife science with Purdue University’s Department of Forestry before coming back to work full-time at Eagle Creek Park.\n\nHer favorite things about the park include the amazing diversity of park visitors, the small, hidden vernal pools teeming with fairy shrimp and baby salamanders in the spring, and the sound of loons (the bird kind) calling on the reservoir. She specializes in amphibians and reptiles, bugs and aquatic invertebrates, growing native plants for butterfly gardening, and loves answering weird questions about Indiana wildlife.\n\nShe is also a licensed wildlife rehabilitator and shares her home with six fish, five orphaned baby opossums, three cats, three orphaned raccoons, three orphaned baby squirrels, one yellow-bellied slider, and one rescued domestic rabbit.\n\nNaturalist\n\nLeah grew up in North Carolina where she attended North Carolina State University, and graduated with a degree in natural resources-ecosystem assessment. After graduating, she was hired as an outdoor environmental educator with the Flat Rock River YMCA in St. Paul, Indiana. She learned to teach children to love nature while exploring the outdoors, and has been doing so ever since.\n\nShe enjoys a wide range of outdoor activities including hiking, identifying insects, and nature photography. As her boss describes, “Leah is awesome and likes to pin dead insects when she isn’t teaching archery or writing environmental education curricula.”\n\nEarth Discovery Center Manager\n\nDawn is an Indianapolis native who started working at Eagle Creek Park as a seasonal naturalist back in 1994.
