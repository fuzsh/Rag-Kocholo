        "text": "\\ TO EAST \\\n\nIf you lived through it you’ll never forget it and you know you’ll never experience anything like it again. If you didn’t you’ll never really grok how absolutely, magnificently inspiring and uplifting was the “Summer of Love” (generally regarded as 1969, when Woodstock took place) and those for the couple of years before and after it. But you can come close!\n\nSome hoping to relive happier, more exciting times may flock to the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) that opens tonight and features, along with roller coasters and ice cream waffles, a bunch of retro-Pop groups like The Carpet Frogs, The High Rollers and The Nomads over its 18-day run [see Daily Show Listings for details].\n\nBut many savvy fans of vintage melodic Pop Rock know exactly where they can catch some of the very best of the music of that era all done by one group on one stage tonight: The David Love Band at Linsmore Tavern in East TO.\n\nSounding like much more than a power trio, DLB resurrects and re-energizes the hits of the mid to late 60s and early 70s, including many cult faves (like “Crimson & Clover”, “19th Nervous Breakdown”, For Your Love” and “Journey To The Centre of Your Mind”) that you won’t often, if ever, still hear even on “oldies” radio.\n\nThis group brings real credibility to its command of tunes by icons like The Beatles and the Stones, Tommy James, Bee Gees, Cream, Guess Who, Youngblood, Smokey Robinson, Who, The Byrds and many, many more from popular music’s golden era.\n\nFrontman singer (and in this combo, bass player) David Love spent just under two decades as part of The Carpet Frogs and has also, in addition to these days serving as part of Craig Martin’s Classic Albums Live Rock troupe, been a longtime mainstay part of the recording and touring combos called upon by Guess Who members Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman for their solo and joint projects.\n\nLove is best known really as a guitar player, so for him to switch to four-string for his own band means, as I’ve written previously, that he has a pretty talented guy in the clutch six-string spot in Darrell McNeill, a veteran Gibson-slinger and vocalist who also has his own Fifteen Stone originals project.\n\nDrummer Kevin Mulligan is another experienced performer upon whom the other two rely to help create the authenticity of the wide range of sounds and styles (another of the great things about that era of popular music) required to convincingly render material ranging from “Psychotic Reaction” by Count Five to “Groovy Kind Of Love” by the Mindbenders.\n\nThe group also adeptly uses its own lighting, backdrop and special effects to truly recreate a magical, mysterious tour of some of the very best of Pop Rock’s melodic heyday.\n\nWhile it’s only been three years since Love took the leap from the Frogs’ pond to start his own group, the trio has been featured at many festivals, corporate and special events and is a mainstay of top-shelf clubs across the GTA.\n\nTonight’s venue, Linsmore Tavern at 1298 Danforth Ave a few steps from the Greenwood subway station, was already over 30 years old when Woodstock was taking place; it’s seen plenty of lovin’ inside its walls before, during and after that epochal weekend!\n\nWe’re talkin’ about a marriage of love and Love here folks. If you lived through the Summer of Love and long to bring it all back, you’ll want to be there starting at 9 p.m. to feel it all again. If you were born too late and can only wonder at what it must have been like, for a measly $5 cover charge this is as good a time and place as any to find out. Just don’t do the brown acid.\n\n-Gary 17, TorontoMoon.ca\n\nSHOW LISTINGS for Friday, August 21, 2021:\n\nListings are organized by area in which the shows occur and within each area field shows are listed chronologically.\n\nListings preceded by an asterisk (*) are repeating weekly events.
