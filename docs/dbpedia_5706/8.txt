December 19 2013 – Santa will certainly have 8 artists and bands on his nice list. Toronto Rock-Aid was born as an idea from Michael Sadler (the vocalist of one of Canada’s most succesful rock bands Saga) to both raise funds and awareness for a charitable cause.

Typhoon Haiyan raved the Philippines on November 8th. 6000 people are reported dead with an additional 1800 still missing. “The homes of more than 16 million people also were either flattened or damaged by the typhoon” reports The Huffington Post. Sadler decided that he needed to take some action (whose ties to the country is strong as his wife is from the Philippines) and leveraged his sphere of influence and put together tonight’s rock spectacular. His band Saga were the headliners, but the bill included Lawrence Gowan, David Barrett Trio, Marty Morin and The Tom Waits Appreciation Congregation, Sean Kelly, Jacob Moon, Neil Chapman and The Carpet Frogs.
