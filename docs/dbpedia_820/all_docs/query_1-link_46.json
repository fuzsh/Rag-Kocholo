        "text": "Thwaites Glacier\n\nThwaites Glacier (Fig. 1) is the fastest-moving ice stream in West Antarctica. It drains a 121000km2 area (Mclntyre, 1984), about 7% of the West Antarctic ice sheet, with an overall surface slope of about 0.004 above the grounding line (Drewry, 1983). The subglaciol floor of the drainage area reaches the Byrd Subglaciol Basin, more than 2000 m below sea level (Drewry, 1983). Thwaites Glacier has been previously investigated, beginning in the early 1980s, based on analysis of satellite images (Reference HughesHughes, 1981; Reference Williams, Ferrigno, Kent and SchoonmakerWilliams and others, 1982; Reference Lindstrom and HughesLindstrom and Hughes, 1984; Lindstrom and Tyler, 1984). Fluctuations of the front of Thwaites Glacier ice tongue have been noted by Ferrigno and Gould (1987), Reference Williams, Ferrigno, Swithinbank, Lucchitta and SeekinsWilliams and others (1995), Reference Swithinbank, Williams, Ferrigno, Seekins, Lucchitta and RosauovaSwithinbank and others (1997) and Ferrigno and others (1998).\n\nThwaites Glacier lacks a buttressing ice shell, but some buttressing may have been provided by Thwaites Iceberg tongue, which had cak ed fromThwailes Glacier ice tongue by 1967. It remained in front of the glacier until 1986, probably pinned on shoals. This huge tabular iceberg (150 km long by 35-65 km wide) had moved out of Pine Island Bay by 1990.\n\nERS-1 images for this area were co-registered by using the coordinates provided, since only one outcrop was exposed on the images. When matching the images by this outcrop and the rolling topography of the grounded ice sheet, residual errors were within 2 pixels of the compressed image, or the equivalent of 50 m on the ground. However, the pixel offset is small relative to the measured icc-fcaturc displacements, and therefore the velocity error is small.\n\nVelocities on both the grounded and floating sections of Thwaites Glacier were measured. Figure 2 shows displacement vectors for the grounded part and a small section of the floating tongue, for the time interval September 1993 March 199 1 images 3 and 5 in Table 1). (The grounding line was placed where the rolling topography of the ice sheet gives way to the crevassed ice of the tongue.) Velocities for this time interval for both the grounded section and the adjacent major portion of the glacier tongue [images 2 and 4 in Table 1) are shown in Figure 3.The figure demonstrates an apparent rapid increase in velocity of approximately\n\n1 km a−1 as the central part of the glacier moves across the grounding line into the glacier tongue. Similar accelerations across the grounding line were observed on Pine Island Glacier (Lucchitta and Rosanova, in press). in addition, measurements were made, for Thwaites Glacier ice tongue only, for the earlier time interval March 1992-September 1993 (images 1 and 3 in Table 1); they give similar velocities to those for the 1993-94 time interval, showing that recent velocities have not changed.\n\nAverage v elocities for the fastest-moving, central parts of the glacier (path 2 in figs 2 and 3) range from about\n\n2.2 km a−1 just above the grounding line to 3.4 km a− at the limit of the measurements in these images. The eastern and western parts of the main glacier (paths 1 and 3 in figs 2 and 3) moved at a slower rate of about 1.5 km a−1 above the grounding line, but accelerated to the same velocity in the glacier tongue. West of the main glacier (paths 4 and 5 in figs 2 and 3) the ice moved at an even slower 0.2-0.6 km a above the grounding line, accelerating gradually to about 3 km a−1 in the glacier tongue.\n\nPrevious velocity measurements were made on the glacier tongue only (the section that remained after the 1967 calving event). in 1977, R. J. Allen (in Ferrigno and others, 1993) estimated an average velocity of 2.0-2.9 km a−1 based on aerial photographs and Landsat images. Lindstrom and Tyler (1984) measured an average velocity of 3.6 km a−1 from 1972 to 1983 on Landsat images co-registered by icebergs trapped in fast ice, a method that makes their numbers questionable. Ferrigno and others (1993) measured an average velocity of 2.6 km a−1 on Landsat images from 1972 to 1984, and 2-7-2.8 km a−1 on Landsat images from 1984 to 1990. They noted an apparent inrrea.se in the velocities, which is confirmed by the results of this"
