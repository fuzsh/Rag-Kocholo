        "meta_description": "Abstract. The geometry of the sea floor immediately beyond\nAntarctica's marine-terminating glaciers is a fundamental control on\nwarm-water routing, but it also describes former topographic pinning points\nthat have been important for ice-shelf buttressing. Unfortunately, this\ninformation is often lacking due to the inaccessibility of these areas for\nsurvey, leading to modelled or interpolated bathymetries being used as\nboundary conditions in numerical modelling simulations. At Thwaites Glacier\n(TG) this critical data gap was addressed in 2019 during the first cruise of\nthe International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) project. We present more than 2000âkm2 of new multibeam\necho-sounder (MBES) data acquired in exceptional sea-ice conditions\nimmediately offshore TG, and we update existing bathymetric compilations.\nThe cross-sectional areas of sea-floor troughs are under-predicted by up to\n40â% or are not resolved at all where MBES data are missing, suggesting that\ncalculations of trough capacity, and thus oceanic heat flux, may be\nsignificantly underestimated. Spatial variations in the morphology of\ntopographic highs, known to be former pinning points for the floating ice\nshelf of TG, indicate differences in bed composition that are supported by\nlandform evidence. We discuss links to ice dynamics for an overriding ice\nmass including a potential positive feedback mechanism where erosion of\nsoft erodible highs may lead to ice-shelf ungrounding even with little\nor no ice thinning. Analyses of bed roughnesses and basal drag contributions\nshow that the sea-floor bathymetry in front of TG is an analogue for extant\nbed areas. Ice flow over the sea-floor troughs and ridges would have been\naffected by similarly high basal drag to that acting at the grounding zone\ntoday. We conclude that more can certainly be gleaned from these 3D\nbathymetric datasets regarding the likely spatial variability of bed\nroughness and bed composition types underneath TG. This work also addresses\nthe requirements of recent numerical ice-sheet and ocean modelling studies\nthat have recognised the need for accurate and high-resolution bathymetry to\ndetermine warm-water routing to the grounding zone and, ultimately, for\npredicting glacier retreat behaviour.",

Larter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2645–2664, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2645-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2645-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDelicate sea floor ridges – corrugation ridges – that form by tidal motion at Antarctic grounding lines record extremely fast retreat of ice streams in the past. Here we use a mathematical model, constrained by real-world observations from Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, to explore how corrugation ridges form. We identify till extrusion, whereby deformable sediment is squeezed out from under the ice like toothpaste as it settles down at each low-tide position, as the most likely process.\n\nNew gravity-derived bathymetry for the Thwaites, Crosson, and Dotson ice shelves revealing two ice shelf populations\n\nTom A.

Ice shelves form a floating buffer between the ice–ocean systems, but the water depth beneath is often a mystery, leaving a critical blind spot in our understanding of how these systems interact. Here, we use airborne measurements of gravity to reveal the bathymetry under the ice shelves flanking the rapidly changing Thwaites Glacier and adjacent glacier systems, providing new insights and data for future models.\n\nGlacial sedimentation, fluxes and erosion rates associated with ice retreat in Petermann Fjord and Nares Strait, north-west Greenland\n\nKelly A.

Here we use a comprehensive geophysical survey from the Petermann Fjord system in NW Greenland to map these sediments, identify depositional processes and calculate glacial erosion rates for the retreating palaeo-Petermann ice stream. Ice streaming is the dominant control on glacial erosion rates which vary by an order of magnitude during deglaciation and are in line with modern rates.\n\nPast water flow beneath Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, West Antarctica\n\nJames D. Kirkham, Kelly A. Hogan, Robert D. Larter, Neil S. Arnold, Frank O. Nitsche, Nicholas R. Golledge, and Julian A. Dowdeswell\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1959–1981, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1959-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1959-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA series of huge (500 m wide, 50 m deep) channels were eroded by water flowing beneath Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in the past. The channels are similar to canyon systems produced by floods of meltwater released beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet millions of years ago. The spatial extent of the channels formed beneath Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers demonstrates significant quantities of water, possibly discharged from trapped subglacial lakes, flowed beneath these glaciers in the past.\n\nSubglacial hydrological control on flow of an Antarctic Peninsula palaeo-ice stream\n\nRobert D.

These data show how subglacial water was delivered to and influenced the dynamic behaviour of the ice stream. Our observations provide insights relevant to understanding the behaviour of modern ice streams and forecasting the contributions that they will make to future sea level rise.\n\nPast and future dynamics of the Brunt Ice Shelf from seabed bathymetry and ice shelf geometry\n\nDominic A. Hodgson, Tom A. Jordan, Jan De Rydt, Peter T. Fretwell, Samuel A. Seddon, David Becker, Kelly A. Hogan, Andrew M. Smith, and David G. Vaughan\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 545–556, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-545-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-545-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica is home to Halley VIa, the latest in a series of six British research stations that have occupied the ice shelf since 1956. A recent rapid growth of rifts in the Brunt Ice Shelf signals the onset of its largest calving event since records began. Here we consider whether this calving event will lead to a new steady state for the ice shelf or an unpinning from the bed, which could predispose it to accelerated flow or collapse.\n\nDeglaciation and future stability of the Coats Land ice margin, Antarctica\n\nDominic A. Hodgson, Kelly Hogan, James M. Smith, James A. Smith, Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand, Alastair G. C. Graham, Peter Fretwell, Claire Allen, Vicky Peck, Jan-Erik Arndt, Boris Dorschel, Christian HÃ¼bscher, Andrew M.

Geologic evidence indicates that GVIIS had disintegrated several thousand years ago due to ocean and atmosphere warming. Here, we use remote sensing and numerical modeling to show that strain thinning reduces buttressing of grounded ice, creating a positive feedback of accelerated ice inflow to the southern GVIIS, likely making it more vulnerable than the northern sector.\n\nQuantitative Sub-Ice and Marine Tracing of Antarctic Sediment Provenance (TASP v1.0)\n\nJim Marschalek, Edward Gasson, Tina van de Flierdt, Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand, Martin Siegert, and Liam Holder\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-104,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-104, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce sheet models can help predict how Antarctica's ice sheets respond to environmental change, and such models benefit from comparison to geological data. Here, we use an ice sheet model output, plus other data, to predict the erosion of debris and trace its transport to where it is deposited on the ocean floor. This allows the results of ice sheet modelling to be directly and quantitively compared to real-world data, helping to reduce uncertainty regarding Antarctic sea level contribution.\n\nCoupled iceâocean interactions during future retreat of West Antarctic ice streams in the Amundsen Sea sector\n\nDavid T. Bett, Alexander T. Bradley, C. Rosie Williams, Paul R. Holland, Robert J. Arthern, and Daniel N. Goldberg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2653–2675, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2653-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2653-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new ice–ocean model simulates future ice sheet evolution in the Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica. Substantial ice retreat is simulated in all scenarios, with some retreat still occurring even with no future ocean melting. The future of small \"pinning points\" (islands of ice that contact the seabed) is an important control on this retreat. Ocean melting is crucial in causing these features to go afloat, providing the link by which climate change may affect this sector's sea level contribution.\n\nInsights into glacial processes from micromorphology of silt-sized sediment\n\nAllison P.

We find that grain shape alteration is greatest in glaciers where high-energy drainage events and abundant melting of surface ice are inferred and that the surfaces of silt-sized sediments preserve evidence of glacial transport. Our results suggest grain shape and texture may reveal whether glaciers previously experienced temperate conditions with more abundant meltwater.\n\nExtensive palaeo-surfaces beneath the EvansâRutford region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet control modern and past ice flow\n\nCharlotte M. Carter, Michael J. Bentley, Stewart S. R. Jamieson, Guy J. G. Paxman, Tom A. Jordan, Julien A. Bodart, Neil Ross, and Felipe Napoleoni\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2277–2296, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2277-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2277-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use radio-echo sounding data to investigate the presence of flat surfaces beneath the Evans–Rutford region in West Antarctica. These surfaces may be what remains of laterally continuous surfaces, formed before the inception of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and we assess two hypotheses for their formation. Tectonic structures in the region may have also had a control on the growth of the ice sheet by focusing ice flow into troughs adjoining these surfaces.\n\nSpatial variability of marine-terminating ice sheet retreat in the Puget Lowland\n\nMarion A.

Past, 20, 891–908, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-891-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-891-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecords of the interaction between land and glacial ice movement in the Puget Lowland of Washington State are used to interpret that solid Earth movement provided stability to this marine-terminating glacial ice for at least 500 years. These results are significant because this landscape is similar to parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Antarctic Peninsula, indicating that the interactions seen in this area are applicable to modern glaciated regions.\n\nEnglacial architecture of Lambert Glacier, East Antarctica\n\nRebecca J. Sanderson, Kate Winter, S. Louise Callard, Felipe Napoleoni, Neil Ross, Tom A. Jordan, and Robert G. Bingham\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4853–4871, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4853-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4853-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-penetrating radar allows us to explore the internal structure of glaciers and ice sheets to constrain past and present ice-flow conditions. In this paper, we examine englacial layers within the Lambert Glacier in East Antarctica using a quantitative layer tracing tool. Analysis reveals that the ice flow here has been relatively stable, but evidence for former fast flow along a tributary suggests that changes have occurred in the past and could change again in the future.\n\nAntarctic Ice Sheet paleo-constraint database\n\nBenoit S. Lecavalier, Lev Tarasov, Greg Balco, Perry Spector, Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand, Christo Buizert, Catherine Ritz, Marion Leduc-Leballeur, Robert Mulvaney, Pippa L. Whitehouse, Michael J.

This includes observations of past ice sheet extent, past ice thickness, past relative sea level, borehole temperature profiles, and present-day bedrock displacement rates. The database is intended to improve our understanding of past Antarctic changes and for ice sheet model calibrations.\n\nAntarctic Bedmap data: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) sharing of 60 years of ice bed, surface, and thickness data\n\nAlice C.

These data are a crucial component of the Antarctic Bedmap initiative which aims to produce a new map and datasets of Antarctic ice thickness and bed topography for the international glaciology and geophysical community.\n\nTowards modelling of corrugation ridges at ice-sheet grounding lines\n\nKelly A. Hogan, Katarzyna L. P. Warburton, Alastair G. C. Graham, Jerome A. Neufeld, Duncan R. Hewitt, Julian A. Dowdeswell, and Robert D. Larter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2645–2664, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2645-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2645-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDelicate sea floor ridges – corrugation ridges – that form by tidal motion at Antarctic grounding lines record extremely fast retreat of ice streams in the past. Here we use a mathematical model, constrained by real-world observations from Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, to explore how corrugation ridges form. We identify till extrusion, whereby deformable sediment is squeezed out from under the ice like toothpaste as it settles down at each low-tide position, as the most likely process.\n\nDifferential impact of isolated topographic bumps on ice sheet flow and subglacial processes\n\nMarion A. McKenzie, Lauren E. Miller, Jacob S. Slawson, Emma J. MacKie, and Shujie Wang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2477–2486, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2477-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2477-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTopographic highs (âbumpsâ) across glaciated landscapes have the potential to affect glacial ice. Bumps in the deglaciated Puget Lowland are assessed for streamlined glacial features to provide insight on ice–bed interactions. We identify a general threshold in which bumps significantly disrupt ice flow and sedimentary processes in this location. However, not all bumps have the same degree of impact. The system assessed here has relevance to parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet and Thwaites Glacier.\n\nDirect measurement of warm Atlantic Intermediate Water close to the grounding line of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79Â° N) Glacier, northeast Greenland\n\nMichael J.

Some of its outlet glaciers and ice shelves have been breaking up and retreating, with inflows of warm ocean water identified as the likely reason. Here we report direct measurements of warm ocean water in an unusual lake that is connected to the ocean beneath the ice shelf in front of the 79Â° N Glacier. This glacier has not yet shown much retreat, but the presence of warm water makes future retreat more likely.\n\nQuantitative Sub-Ice and Marine Tracing of Antarctic Sediment Provenance (TASP v0.1)\n\nJames W. Marschalek, Edward Gasson, Tina van de Flierdt, Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand, Martin J. Siegert, and Liam Holder\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-8,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-8, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce sheet models can help predict how Antarctica’s ice sheets respond to environmental change; such models benefit from comparison to geological data. Here, we use ice sheet model results, plus other data, to predict the erosion of Antarctic debris and trace its transport to where it is deposited on the ocean floor. This allows the results of ice sheet modelling to be directly and quantitively compared to real-world data, helping to reduce uncertainty regarding Antarctic sea level contribution.\n\nHolocene history of the 79Â° N ice shelf reconstructed from epishelf lake and uplifted glaciomarine sediments\n\nJames A.

Rea, Colm O'Cofaigh, Pauline Gulliver, Werner Ehrmann, Richard S. Jones, and David H. Roberts\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1247–1270, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1247-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1247-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet is melting at an accelerating rate. To understand the significance of these changes we reconstruct the history of one of its fringing ice shelves, known as 79° N ice shelf. We show that the ice shelf disappeared 8500 years ago, following a period of enhanced warming. An important implication of our study is that 79° N ice shelf is susceptible to collapse when atmospheric and ocean temperatures are ~2°C warmer than present, which could occur by the middle of this century.\n\nAnthropogenic and internal drivers of wind changes over the Amundsen Sea, West Antarctica, during the 20th and 21st centuries\n\nPaul R. Holland, Gemma K. O'Connor, Thomas J. Bracegirdle, Pierre Dutrieux, Kaitlin A. Naughten, Eric J. Steig, David P. Schneider, Adrian Jenkins, and James A. Smith\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 5085–5105, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-5085-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-5085-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing ice, causing sea-level rise. However, it is not known whether human-induced climate change has contributed to this ice loss. In this study, we use evidence from climate models and palaeoclimate measurements (e.g. ice cores) to suggest that the ice loss was triggered by natural climate variations but is now sustained by human-forced climate change. This implies that future greenhouse-gas emissions may influence sea-level rise from Antarctica.\n\nDrainage and refill of an Antarctic Peninsula subglacial lake reveal an active subglacial hydrological network\n\nDominic A. Hodgson, Tom A. Jordan, Neil Ross, Teal R. Riley, and Peter T. Fretwell\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4797–4809, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4797-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4797-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes the drainage (and refill) of a subglacial lake on the Antarctic Peninsula resulting in the collapse of the overlying ice into the newly formed subglacial cavity. It provides evidence of an active hydrological network under the region's glaciers and close coupling between surface climate processes and the base of the ice.\n\nBritish Antarctic Survey's aerogeophysical data: releasing 25 years of airborne gravity, magnetic, and radar datasets over Antarctica\n\nAlice C. FrÃ©mand, Julien A. Bodart, Tom A. Jordan, Fausto Ferraccioli, Carl Robinson, Hugh F. J. Corr, Helen J. Peat, Robert G. Bingham, and David G. Vaughan\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

These include a total of 64 datasets from 24 different surveys, amounting to >30 % of coverage over the Antarctic Ice Sheet. This paper discusses how these data were acquired and processed and presents the methods used to standardize and publish the data in an interactive and reproducible manner.\n\nGeomorphology and shallow sub-sea-floor structures underneath the EkstrÃ¶m Ice Shelf, Antarctica\n\nAstrid Oetting, Emma C.

Klages, Gerhard Kuhn, Astrid Lambrecht, Andreas LÃ¤ufer, Christoph Mayer, Ralf Tiedemann, Frank Wilhelms, and Olaf Eisen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2051–2066, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2051-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2051-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study combines a variety of geophysical measurements in front of and beneath the EkstrÃ¶m Ice Shelf in order to identify and interpret geomorphological evidences of past ice sheet flow, extent and retreat. The maximal extent of grounded ice in this region was 11 km away from the continental shelf break. The thickness of palaeo-ice on the calving front around the LGM was estimated to be at least 305 to 320 m. We provide essential boundary conditions for palaeo-ice-sheet models.\n\nReconstructing Antarctic winter sea-ice extent during Marine Isotope Stage 5e\n\nMatthew Chadwick, Claire S. Allen, Louise C. Sime, Xavier Crosta, and Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand\n\nClim. Past, 18, 129–146, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-129-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-129-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlgae preserved in marine sediments have allowed us to reconstruct how much winter sea ice was present around Antarctica during a past time period (130 000 years ago) when the climate was warmer than today. The patterns of sea-ice increase and decrease vary between different parts of the Southern Ocean. The Pacific sector has a largely stable sea-ice extent, whereas the amount of sea ice in the Atlantic sector is much more variable with bigger decreases and increases than other regions.\n\nEvaluation of lipid biomarkers as proxies for sea ice and ocean temperatures along the Antarctic continental margin\n\nNele Lamping, Juliane MÃ¼ller, Jens Hefter, Gesine Mollenhauer, Christian Haas, Xiaoxu Shi, Maria-Elena Vorrath, Gerrit Lohmann, and Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand\n\nClim. Past, 17, 2305–2326, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2305-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2305-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analysed biomarker concentrations on surface sediment samples from the Antarctic continental margin. Highly branched isoprenoids and GDGTs are used for reconstructing recent sea-ice distribution patterns and ocean temperatures respectively. We compared our biomarker-based results with data obtained from satellite observations and estimated from a numerical model and find reasonable agreements. Further, we address caveats and provide recommendations for future investigations.\n\nArchaeal intact polar lipids in polar waters: a comparison between the Amundsen and Scotia seas\n\nCharlotte L.

Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are powerful tools for reconstructing ocean temperature but can be difficult to apply to the Southern Ocean. Our results show active GDGT synthesis in relatively warm depths of the ocean. This research improves the application of GDGT palaeoceanographic proxies in the Southern Ocean.\n\nLast Glacial Maximum to Holocene paleoceanography of the northwestern Ross Sea inferred from sediment core geochemistry and micropaleontology at Hallett Ridge\n\nRomana Melis, Lucilla Capotondi, Fiorenza Torricella, Patrizia Ferretti, Andrea Geniram, Jong Kuk Hong, Gerhard Kuhn, Boo-Keun Khim, Sookwan Kim, Elisa Malinverno, Kyu Cheul Yoo, and Ester Colizza\n\nJ.

Results allow us to identify three time intervals: the glacial–deglacial transition, the deglacial period, and the interglacial period.\n\nA global mean sea surface temperature dataset for the Last Interglacial (129â116 ka) and contribution of thermal expansion to sea level change\n\nChris S. M. Turney, Richard T. Jones, Nicholas P. McKay, Erik van Sebille, ZoÃ« A. Thomas, Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand, and Christopher J. Fogwill\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 12, 3341–3356, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-3341-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-3341-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Last Interglacial (129–116 ka) experienced global temperatures and sea levels higher than today. The direct contribution of warmer conditions to global sea level (thermosteric) are uncertain. We report a global network of sea surface temperatures. We find mean global annual temperature anomalies of 0.2 Â± 0.1ËC and an early maximum peak of 0.9 Â± 0.1ËC. Our reconstruction suggests warmer waters contributed on average 0.08 Â± 0.1 m and a peak contribution of 0.39 Â± 0.1 m to global sea level.\n\nGeohazard detection using 3D seismic data to enhance offshore scientific drilling site selection\n\nDavid R. Cox, Paul C. Knutz, D. Calvin Campbell, John R. Hopper, Andrew M. W. Newton, Mads Huuse, and Karsten Gohl\n\nSci. Dril., 28, 1–27, https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-28-1-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-28-1-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA workflow is presented that uses 3D subsurface image (seismic) data to identify and avoid potential geological hazards, in order to increase safety and minimize the risk associated with selecting offshore scientific drilling locations. The workflow has been implemented for a scientific drilling expedition proposal within a challenging region offshore north-western Greenland and resulted in an improved understanding of subsurface hazards and a reduction of risk across all selected drill sites.\n\nNew gravity-derived bathymetry for the Thwaites, Crosson, and Dotson ice shelves revealing two ice shelf populations\n\nTom A. Jordan, David Porter, Kirsty Tinto, Romain Millan, Atsuhiro Muto, Kelly Hogan, Robert D. Larter, Alastair G. C. Graham, and John D. Paden\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2869–2882, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2869-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2869-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLinking ocean and ice sheet processes allows prediction of sea level change. Ice shelves form a floating buffer between the ice–ocean systems, but the water depth beneath is often a mystery, leaving a critical blind spot in our understanding of how these systems interact. Here, we use airborne measurements of gravity to reveal the bathymetry under the ice shelves flanking the rapidly changing Thwaites Glacier and adjacent glacier systems, providing new insights and data for future models.\n\nResults of the third Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (MISMIP+)\n\nStephen L.

MISMIP+ is one in a series of exercises that test numerical models of ice sheet flow in simple situations. This particular exercise concentrates on the response of ice sheet models to the thinning of their floating ice shelves, which is of interest because numerical models are currently used to model the response to contemporary and near-future thinning in Antarctic ice shelves.\n\nPast ice sheetâseabed interactions in the northeastern Weddell Sea embayment, Antarctica\n\nJan Erik Arndt, Robert D. Larter, Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand, Simon H. SÃ¸rli, Matthias Forwick, James A. Smith, and Lukas Wacker\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2115–2135, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2115-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2115-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe interpret landforms on the seabed and investigate sediment cores to improve our understanding of the past ice sheet development in this poorly understood part of Antarctica. Recent crack development of the Brunt ice shelf has raised concerns about its stability and the security of the British research station Halley. We describe ramp-shaped bedforms that likely represent ice shelf grounding and stabilization locations of the past that may reflect an analogue to the process going on now.\n\nGetz Ice Shelf melt enhanced by freshwater discharge from beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\nWei Wei, Donald D. Blankenship, Jamin S. Greenbaum, Noel Gourmelen, Christine F. Dow, Thomas G. Richter, Chad A. Greene, Duncan A. Young, SangHoon Lee, Tae-Wan Kim, Won Sang Lee, and Karen M. Assmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1399–1408, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1399-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1399-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGetz Ice Shelf is the largest meltwater source from Antarctica of the Southern Ocean. This study compares the relative importance of the meltwater production of Getz from both ocean and subglacial sources. We show that basal melt rates are elevated where bathymetric troughs provide pathways for warm Circumpolar Deep Water to enter the Getz Ice Shelf cavity. In particular, we find that subshelf melting is enhanced where subglacially discharged fresh water flows across the grounding line.\n\nGlacial sedimentation, fluxes and erosion rates associated with ice retreat in Petermann Fjord and Nares Strait, north-west Greenland\n\nKelly A. Hogan, Martin Jakobsson, Larry Mayer, Brendan T. Reilly, Anne E. Jennings, Joseph S. Stoner, Tove Nielsen, Katrine J. Andresen, Egon NÃ¸rmark, Katrien A. Heirman, Elina Kamla, Kevin Jerram, Christian Stranne, and Alan Mix\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 261–286, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-261-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-261-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacial sediments in fjords hold a key record of environmental and ice dynamic changes during ice retreat. Here we use a comprehensive geophysical survey from the Petermann Fjord system in NW Greenland to map these sediments, identify depositional processes and calculate glacial erosion rates for the retreating palaeo-Petermann ice stream. Ice streaming is the dominant control on glacial erosion rates which vary by an order of magnitude during deglaciation and are in line with modern rates.\n\nPast water flow beneath Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, West Antarctica\n\nJames D. Kirkham, Kelly A. Hogan, Robert D. Larter, Neil S. Arnold, Frank O. Nitsche, Nicholas R. Golledge, and Julian A. Dowdeswell\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1959–1981, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1959-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1959-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA series of huge (500 m wide, 50 m deep) channels were eroded by water flowing beneath Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in the past. The channels are similar to canyon systems produced by floods of meltwater released beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet millions of years ago. The spatial extent of the channels formed beneath Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers demonstrates significant quantities of water, possibly discharged from trapped subglacial lakes, flowed beneath these glaciers in the past.\n\nSubglacial hydrological control on flow of an Antarctic Peninsula palaeo-ice stream\n\nRobert D. Larter, Kelly A. Hogan, Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand, James A. Smith, Christine L. Batchelor, Matthieu Cartigny, Alex J. Tate, James D. Kirkham, ZoÃ« A. Roseby, Gerhard Kuhn, Alastair G. C.

These data show how subglacial water was delivered to and influenced the dynamic behaviour of the ice stream. Our observations provide insights relevant to understanding the behaviour of modern ice streams and forecasting the contributions that they will make to future sea level rise.\n\nPast and future dynamics of the Brunt Ice Shelf from seabed bathymetry and ice shelf geometry\n\nDominic A. Hodgson, Tom A. Jordan, Jan De Rydt, Peter T. Fretwell, Samuel A. Seddon, David Becker, Kelly A. Hogan, Andrew M. Smith, and David G. Vaughan\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 545–556, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-545-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-545-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica is home to Halley VIa, the latest in a series of six British research stations that have occupied the ice shelf since 1956. A recent rapid growth of rifts in the Brunt Ice Shelf signals the onset of its largest calving event since records began. Here we consider whether this calving event will lead to a new steady state for the ice shelf or an unpinning from the bed, which could predispose it to accelerated flow or collapse.\n\nDeveloping community-based scientific priorities and new drilling proposals in the southern Indian and southwestern Pacific oceans\n\nRobert McKay, Neville Exon, Dietmar MÃ¼ller, Karsten Gohl, Michael Gurnis, Amelia Shevenell, Stuart Henrys, Fumio Inagaki, Dhananjai Pandey, Jessica Whiteside, Tina van de Flierdt, Tim Naish, Verena Heuer, Yuki Morono, Millard Coffin, Marguerite Godard, Laura Wallace, Shuichi Kodaira, Peter Bijl, Julien Collot, Gerald Dickens, Brandon Dugan, Ann G.

Simkins, Sarah L. Greenwood, and John B. Anderson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2707–2726, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2707-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2707-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing thousands of grounding line landforms in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, we observe two distinct landform types associated with contrasting styles of grounding line retreat. We characterise landform morphology, examine factors that control landform morphology and distribution, and explore drivers of grounding line (in)stability. This study highlights the importance of understanding thresholds which may destabilise a system and of controls on grounding line retreat over a range of timescales.\n\nDeglaciation and future stability of the Coats Land ice margin, Antarctica\n\nDominic A.

Graham, Peter Fretwell, Claire Allen, Vicky Peck, Jan-Erik Arndt, Boris Dorschel, Christian HÃ¼bscher, Andrew M.

Larter, Peter Friedl, Karsten Gohl, Kathrin HÃ¶ppner, and the Science Team of Expedition PS104\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2039–2050, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2039-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2039-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe calving line location of the Pine Island Glacier did not show any trend within the last 70 years until calving in 2015 led to unprecedented retreat. In February 2017 we accessed this previously ice-shelf-covered area with RV Polarstern and mapped the sea-floor topography for the first time. Satellite imagery of the last decades show how the newly mapped shoals affected the ice shelf development and highlights that sea-floor topography is an important factor in initiating calving events.\n\nSeafloor geomorphology of western Antarctic Peninsula bays: aÂ signature of ice flow behaviour\n\nYuribia P. Munoz and Julia S. Wellner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 205–225, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-205-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-205-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe mapped submarine landforms in western Antarctic Peninsula bays. These landforms were formed by flowing ice and provide insight into the local controls on glacial ice advance and retreat. We combined data from various cruises to create seafloor maps. We conclude that the number of landforms found in the bays scales to the size of the bay, narrower bays tend to stabilize ice flow, and meltwater channels are abundant, and we hypothesize a recent glacial advance, likely the Little Ice Age.\n\nA global, high-resolution data set of ice sheet topography, cavity geometry, and ocean bathymetry\n\nJanin Schaffer, Ralph Timmermann, Jan Erik Arndt, Steen Savstrup Kristensen, Christoph Mayer, Mathieu Morlighem, and Daniel Steinhage\n\nEarth Syst.

We corrected data from earlier products in the areas of Petermann, Hagen BrÃ¦, and Helheim glaciers, incorporated original data for the floating ice tongue of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier, and applied corrections for the geometry of Getz, Abbot, and Fimbul ice shelf cavities. The data set is available from the PANGAEA database.\n\nPast ice-sheet behaviour: retreat scenarios and changing controls in the Ross Sea, Antarctica\n\nAnna Ruth W. Halberstadt, Lauren M.

Based on extensive mapping of these glacial landforms, a large embayment formed in the eastern Ross Sea. This was followed by complex, late-stage retreat in the western Ross Sea where banks stabilised the ice sheet. Physiography and sea floor geology act as regional controls on ice-sheet dynamics across the Ross Sea.\n\nConfiguration of the Northern Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet at LGM based on a new synthesis of seabed imagery\n\nC.

Optical-satellite imagery is used to retrieve the calving cycle of the glacier ice tongue and to measure the ice velocity and strain rates in order to document fracture evolution. We observed that the presence of sea ice for consecutive years has favoured the glacier extension but failed to inhibit the growth of fractures that accelerated in June 2021.\n\nWeak relationship between remotely detected crevasses and inferred ice rheological parameters on Antarctic ice shelves\n\nCristina Gerli, Sebastian Rosier, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, and Sainan Sun\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2677–2689, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2677-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2677-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecent efforts have focused on using AI and satellite imagery to track crevasses for assessing ice shelf damage and informing ice flow models. Our study reveals a weak connection between these observed products and damage maps inferred from ice flow models. While there is some improvement in crevasse-dense regions, this association remains limited. Directly mapping ice damage from satellite observations may not significantly improve the representation of these processes within ice flow models.\n\nExtensive palaeo-surfaces beneath the EvansâRutford region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet control modern and past ice flow\n\nCharlotte M. Carter, Michael J. Bentley, Stewart S. R. Jamieson, Guy J. G. Paxman, Tom A. Jordan, Julien A. Bodart, Neil Ross, and Felipe Napoleoni\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2277–2296, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2277-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2277-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use radio-echo sounding data to investigate the presence of flat surfaces beneath the Evans–Rutford region in West Antarctica. These surfaces may be what remains of laterally continuous surfaces, formed before the inception of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and we assess two hypotheses for their formation. Tectonic structures in the region may have also had a control on the growth of the ice sheet by focusing ice flow into troughs adjoining these surfaces.\n\nTowards the systematic reconnaissance of seismic signals from glaciers and ice sheets â Part 1: Event detection for cryoseismology\n\nRebecca B. Latto, Ross J. Turner, Anya M. Reading, and J. Paul Winberry\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2061–2079, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2061-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2061-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study of icequakes allows for investigation of many glacier processes that are unseen by typical reconnaissance methods. However, detection of such seismic signals is challenging due to low signal-to-noise levels and diverse source mechanisms. Here we present a novel algorithm that is optimized to detect signals from a glacier environment. We apply the algorithm to seismic data recorded in the 2010–2011 austral summer from the Whillans Ice Stream and evaluate the resulting event catalogue.\n\nTowards the systematic reconnaissance of seismic signals from glaciers and ice sheets â Part 2: Unsupervised learning for source process characterization\n\nRebecca B. Latto, Ross J. Turner, Anya M. Reading, Sue Cook, Bernd Kulessa, and J. Paul Winberry\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2081–2101, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2081-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2081-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeismic catalogues are potentially rich sources of information on glacier processes. In a companion study, we constructed an event catalogue for seismic data from the Whillans Ice Stream. Here, we provide a semi-automated workflow for consistent catalogue analysis using an unsupervised cluster analysis. We discuss the defining characteristics of identified signal types found in this catalogue and possible mechanisms for the underlying glacier processes and noise sources.\n\nGeometric amplification and suppression of ice-shelf basal melt in West Antarctica\n\nJan De Rydt and Kaitlin Naughten\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1863–1888, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1863-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1863-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing ice at an accelerating pace. This is largely due to the presence of warm ocean water around the periphery of the Antarctic continent, which melts the ice. It is generally assumed that the strength of this process is controlled by the temperature of the ocean. However, in this study we show that an equally important role is played by the changing geometry of the ice sheet, which affects the strength of the ocean currents and thereby the melt rates.\n\nAlpine topography of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, Antarctica, mapped from ice sheet surface morphology\n\nEdmund J. Lea, Stewart S. R. Jamieson, and Michael J. Bentley\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1733–1751, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1733-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1733-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use the ice surface expression of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in East Antarctica to map the horizontal pattern of valleys and ridges in finer detail than possible from previous methods. In upland areas, valleys are spaced much less than 5 km apart, with consequences for the distribution of melting at the bed and hence the likelihood of ancient ice being preserved. Automated mapping techniques were tested alongside manual approaches, with a hybrid approach recommended for future work.\n\nImpact of boundary conditions on the modeled thermal regime of the Antarctic ice sheet\n\nIn-Woo Park, Emilia Kyung Jin, Mathieu Morlighem, and Kang-Kun Lee\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1139–1155, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study conducted 3D thermodynamic ice sheet model experiments, and modeled temperatures were compared with 15 observed borehole temperature profiles. We found that using incompressibility of ice without sliding agrees well with observed temperature profiles in slow-flow regions, while incorporating sliding in fast-flow regions captures observed temperature profiles. Also, the choice of vertical velocity scheme has a greater impact on the shape of the modeled temperature profile.\n\nThe staggered retreat of grounded ice in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)\n\nMatthew A. Danielson and Philip J. Bart\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1125–1138, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1125-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1125-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in the Ross Sea was more significant than for any other Antarctic sector. Here we combined the available dates of retreat with new mapping of sediment deposited by the ice sheet during overall retreat. Our work shows that the post-LGM retreat through the Ross Sea was not uniform. This uneven retreat can cause instability in the present-day Antarctic ice sheet configuration and lead to future runaway retreat.\n\nThe effect of landfast sea ice buttressing on ice dynamic speedup in the Larsen B embayment, Antarctica\n\nTrystan Surawy-Stepney, Anna E. Hogg, Stephen L. Cornford, Benjamin J. Wallis, Benjamin J. Davison, Heather L. Selley, Ross A. W. Slater, Elise K. Lie, Livia Jakob, Andrew Ridout, Noel Gourmelen, Bryony I. D. Freer, Sally F. Wilson, and Andrew Shepherd\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 977–993, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-977-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-977-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we use satellite observations and an ice flow model to quantify the impact of sea ice buttressing on ice streams on the Antarctic Peninsula. The evacuation of 11-year-old landfast sea ice in the Larsen B embayment on the East Antarctic Peninsula in January 2022 was closely followed by major changes in the calving behaviour and acceleration (30 %) of the ocean-terminating glaciers. Our results show that sea ice buttressing had a negligible direct role in the observed dynamic changes.\n\nWidespread increase in discharge from West Antarctic Peninsula glaciers since 2018\n\nBenjamin J. Davison, Anna E. Hogg, Carlos Moffat, Michael P. Meredith, and Benjamin J. Wallis\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-232,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-232, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a new dataset of ice motion, we observed glacier acceleration on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. The speed-up began around January 2021 but some glaciers sped-up earlier or later. All of those glaciers flow into the ocean where they melt – ship-based observations show that ocean temperatures near the glaciers have been unusually warm since 2018, likely causing them to melt faster and speed-up. As the ocean warms more in future, these glaciers may accelerate again.\n\nMeteoric water and glacial melt in the southeastern Amundsen Sea: a time series from 1994 to 2020\n\nAndrew N. Hennig, David A. Mucciarone, Stanley S. Jacobs, Richard A. Mortlock, and Robert B. Dunbar\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 791–818, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-791-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-791-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA total of 937 seawater paired oxygen isotope (δ18O)–salinity samples collected during seven cruises on the SE Amundsen Sea between 1994 and 2020 reveal a deep freshwater source with δ18O − 29.4±1.0‰, consistent with the signature of local ice shelf melt. Local mean meteoric water content – comprised primarily of glacial meltwater – increased between 1994 and 2020 but exhibited greater interannual variability than increasing trend.\n\nEvaporative controls on Antarctic precipitation: an ECHAM6 model study using innovative water tracer diagnostics\n\nQinggang Gao, Louise C. Sime, Alison J. McLaren, Thomas J. Bracegirdle, Emilie Capron, Rachael H. Rhodes, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Xiaoxu Shi, and Martin Werner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 683–703, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-683-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-683-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctic precipitation is a crucial component of the climate system. Its spatio-temporal variability impacts sea level changes and the interpretation of water isotope measurements in ice cores. To better understand its climatic drivers, we developed water tracers in an atmospheric model to identify moisture source conditions from which precipitation originates. We find that mid-latitude surface winds exert an important control on moisture availability for Antarctic precipitation.\n\nDisentangling the drivers of future Antarctic ice loss with a historically calibrated ice-sheet model\n\nViolaine Coulon, Ann Kristin Klose, Christoph Kittel, Tamsin Edwards, Fiona Turner, Ricarda Winkelmann, and Frank Pattyn\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 653–681, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-653-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-653-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present new projections of the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet until the end of the millennium, calibrated with observations. We show that the ocean will be the main trigger of future ice loss. As temperatures continue to rise, the atmosphere's role may shift from mitigating to amplifying Antarctic mass loss already by the end of the century. For high-emission scenarios, this may lead to substantial sea-level rise. Adopting sustainable practices would however reduce the rate of ice loss.\n\nFeedback mechanisms controlling Antarctic glacial cycle dynamics simulated with a coupled ice sheet–solid Earth model\n\nTorsten Albrecht, Meike Bagge, and Volker Klemann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2990,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2990, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed coupled ice sheet – solid Earth simulations and discovered a positive (forebulge) feedback mechanisms for advancing grounding lines, supporting a comparably larger West Antarctic Ice Sheet at Last Glacial Maximum. During deglaciation we found the stabilizing GIA feedback to dominate grounding line retreat in the Ross Sea, where a weak Earth structure is prevalent. This may have consequences for the contemporary and future ice sheet stability and potential rates of sea level rise.\n\nInsights into the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers from the ISMIP6 ice sheet model ensemble and associated uncertainty\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Vincent Verjans, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nEvaluation of four calving laws for Antarctic ice shelves\n\nJoel A. Wilner, Mathieu Morlighem, and Gong Cheng\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4889–4901, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4889-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4889-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use numerical modeling to study iceberg calving off of ice shelves in Antarctica. We examine four widely used mathematical descriptions of calving (calving laws), under the assumption that Antarctic ice shelf front positions should be in steady state under the current climate forcing. We quantify how well each of these calving laws replicates the observed front positions. Our results suggest that the eigencalving and von Mises laws are most suitable for Antarctic ice shelves.\n\nEnglacial architecture of Lambert Glacier, East Antarctica\n\nRebecca J. Sanderson, Kate Winter, S. Louise Callard, Felipe Napoleoni, Neil Ross, Tom A. Jordan, and Robert G. Bingham\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4853–4871, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4853-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4853-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-penetrating radar allows us to explore the internal structure of glaciers and ice sheets to constrain past and present ice-flow conditions. In this paper, we examine englacial layers within the Lambert Glacier in East Antarctica using a quantitative layer tracing tool. Analysis reveals that the ice flow here has been relatively stable, but evidence for former fast flow along a tributary suggests that changes have occurred in the past and could change again in the future.\n\nMass changes of the northern Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet derived from repeat bi-static synthetic aperture radar acquisitions for the period 2013â2017\n\nThorsten Seehaus, Christian Sommer, Thomas Dethinne, and Philipp Malz\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4629–4644, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4629-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4629-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExisting mass budget estimates for the northern Antarctic Peninsula (>70° S) are affected by considerable limitations. We carried out the first region-wide analysis of geodetic mass balances throughout this region (coverage of 96.4 %) for the period 2013–2017 based on repeat pass bi-static TanDEM-X acquisitions. A total mass budget of −24.1±2.8 Gt/a is revealed. Imbalanced high ice discharge, particularly at former ice shelf tributaries, is the main driver of overall ice loss.\n\nThe evolution of future Antarctic surface melt using PISM-dEBM-simple\n\nJulius Garbe, Maria Zeitz, Uta Krebs-Kanzow, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4571–4599, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4571-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4571-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe adopt the novel surface module dEBM-simple in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) to investigate the impact of atmospheric warming on Antarctic surface melt and long-term ice sheet dynamics. As an enhancement compared to traditional temperature-based melt schemes, the module accounts for changes in ice surface albedo and thus the melt–albedo feedback. Our results underscore the critical role of ice–atmosphere feedbacks in the future sea-level contribution of Antarctica on long timescales.\n\nCharacteristics and rarity of the strong 1940s westerly wind event over the Amundsen Sea, West Antarctica\n\nGemma K. O'Connor, Paul R. Holland, Eric J. Steig, Pierre Dutrieux, and Gregory J. Hakim\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4399–4420, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4399-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4399-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers in West Antarctica are rapidly melting, but the causes are unknown due to limited observations. A leading hypothesis is that an unusually large wind event in the 1940s initiated the ocean-driven melting. Using proxy reconstructions (e.g., using ice cores) and climate model simulations, we find that wind events similar to the 1940s event are relatively common on millennial timescales, implying that ocean variability or climate trends are also necessary to explain the start of ice loss.\n\nThe influence of present-day regional surface mass balance uncertainties on the future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\nChristian Wirths, Johannes Sutter, and Thomas Stocker\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2233,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2233, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the influence of several regional climate models onto the Antarctic Ice Sheet, when applied as forcing for the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM). Our study shows, that the choice of regional climate model forcing results in uncertainties similar to the ones in future sea level rise projections and affects also the extent of grounding line retreat in West Antarctica.\n\nThe long–term sea–level commitment from Antarctica\n\nAnn Kristin Klose, Violaine Coulon, Frank Pattyn, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-156,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-156, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for TC\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe systematically assess the long-term sea-level response from Antarctica to warming projected over the next centuries with two ice-sheet models. We show that this committed Antarctic sea-level contribution is substantially higher than the transient sea-level change projected for the coming decades. A low-emission scenario already poses a considerable risk of multi-meter sea-level increase over the next millennia, while additional East Antarctic ice loss unfolds under the high-emission pathway.\n\nSensitivity of the MAR regional climate model snowpack to the parameterization of the assimilation of satellite-derived wet-snow masks on the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nThomas Dethinne, Quentin Glaude, Ghislain Picard, Christoph Kittel, Patrick Alexander, Anne Orban, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4267–4288, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4267-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4267-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the sensitivity of the regional climate model Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) to the assimilation of wet-snow occurrence estimated by remote sensing datasets. The assimilation is performed by nudging the MAR snowpack temperature. The data assimilation is performed over the Antarctic Peninsula for the 2019–2021 period. The results show an increase in the melt production (+66.7 %) and a decrease in surface mass balance (−4.5 %) of the model for the 2019–2020 melt season.\n\nStratigraphic noise and its potential drivers across the plateau of Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica\n\nNora Hirsch, Alexandra Zuhr, Thomas MÃ¼nch, Maria HÃ¶rhold, Johannes Freitag, Remi Dallmayr, and Thomas Laepple\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4207–4221, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4207-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4207-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStable water isotopes from firn cores provide valuable information on past climates, yet their utility is hampered by stratigraphic noise, i.e. the irregular deposition and wind-driven redistribution of snow. We found stratigraphic noise on the Antarctic Plateau to be related to the local accumulation rate, snow surface roughness and slope inclination, which can guide future decisions on sampling locations and thus increase the resolution of climate reconstructions from low-accumulation areas.\n\nModes of Antarctic tidal grounding line migration revealed by Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) laser altimetry\n\nBryony I. D. Freer, Oliver J. Marsh, Anna E. Hogg, Helen Amanda Fricker, and Laurie Padman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4079–4101, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4079-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4079-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a method using ICESat-2 data to measure how Antarctic grounding lines (GLs) migrate across the tide cycle. At an ice plain on the Ronne Ice Shelf we observe 15 km of tidal GL migration, the largest reported distance in Antarctica, dominating any signal of long-term migration. We identify four distinct migration modes, which provide both observational support for models of tidal ice flexure and GL migration and insights into ice shelf–ocean–subglacial interactions in grounding zones.\n\nA physics-based Antarctic melt detection technique: Combining AMSR-2, radiative transfer modeling, and firn modeling\n\nMarissa Eileen Dattler, Brooke Medley, and C. Max Stevens\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-136,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2023-136, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for TC\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop an algorithm based on combining models and satellites observations to identify the presence of surface melt on the Antarctic Ice Sheet. We compare two sites to observations taken in the field and find that this method works similarly to previous methods. Unlike other previous methods, this algorithm is based on physical parameters and updates to this method could allow this algorithm to quantify the amount of melt water present on the Antarctic Ice instead of simply detecting it.\n\nEvaluating the impact of enhanced horizontal resolution over the Antarctic domain using a variable-resolution Earth system model\n\nRajashree Tri Datta, Adam Herrington, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, David P. Schneider, Luke Trusel, Ziqi Yin, and Devon Dunmire\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3847–3866, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3847-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3847-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation over Antarctica is one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in sea level rise estimates. Earth system models (ESMs) are a valuable tool for these estimates but typically run at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we present an evaluation of the variable-resolution CESM2 (VR-CESM2) for the first time with a grid designed for enhanced spatial resolution over Antarctica to achieve the high resolution of regional climate models while preserving the two-way interactions of ESMs.\n\nStatistically parameterizing and evaluating a positive degree-day model to estimate surface melt in Antarctica from 1979 to 2022\n\nYaowen Zheng, Nicholas R. Golledge, Alexandra Gossart, Ghislain Picard, and Marion Leduc-Leballeur\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3667–3694, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3667-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3667-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPositive degree-day (PDD) schemes are widely used in many Antarctic numerical ice sheet models. However, the PDD approach has not been systematically explored for its application in Antarctica. We have constructed a novel grid-cell-level spatially distributed PDD (dist-PDD) model and assessed its accuracy. We suggest that an appropriately parameterized dist-PDD model can be a valuable tool for exploring Antarctic surface melt beyond the satellite era.\n\nWidespread slowdown in thinning rates of West Antarctic ice shelves\n\nFernando S. Paolo, Alex S. Gardner, Chad A. Greene, Johan Nilsson, Michael P. Schodlok, Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel, and Helen A. Fricker\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3409–3433, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3409-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report on a slowdown in the rate of thinning and melting of West Antarctic ice shelves. We present a comprehensive assessment of the Antarctic ice shelves, where we analyze at a continental scale the changes in thickness, flow, and basal melt over the past 26 years. We also present a novel method to estimate ice shelf change from satellite altimetry and a time-dependent data set of ice shelf thickness and basal melt rates at an unprecedented resolution.\n\nSeasonal variability in Antarctic ice shelf velocities forced by sea surface height variations\n\nCyrille Mosbeux, Laurie Padman, Emilie Klein, Peter D. Bromirski, and Helen A. Fricker\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2585–2606, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2585-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2585-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctica's ice shelves (the floating extension of the ice sheet) help regulate ice flow. As ice shelves thin or lose contact with the bedrock, the upstream ice tends to accelerate, resulting in increased mass loss. Here, we use an ice sheet model to simulate the effect of seasonal sea surface height variations and see if we can reproduce observed seasonal variability of ice velocity on the ice shelf. When correctly parameterised, the model fits the observations well.\n\nRevisiting temperature sensitivity: how does Antarctic precipitation change with temperature?\n\nLena Nicola, Dirk Notz, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2563–2583, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2563-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2563-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor future sea-level projections, approximating Antarctic precipitation increases through temperature-scaling approaches will remain important, as coupled ice-sheet simulations with regional climate models remain computationally expensive, especially on multi-centennial timescales. We here revisit the relationship between Antarctic temperature and precipitation using different scaling approaches, identifying and explaining regional differences.\n\nPrecision measurement of the index of refraction of deep glacial ice at radio frequencies at Summit Station, Greenland\n\nChristoph Welling and the RNO-G Collaboration\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-745,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-745, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report in the measurement of the index of refraction in glacial ice at radio frequencies. We show that radio echos from within the ice can be associated with specific features of the ice conductivity, and use this to determine the wave velocity. This measurement is especially relevant for the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G), a neutrino detection experiment currently under construction at Summit Station, Greenland.\n\nCosmogenic-nuclide data from Antarctic nunataks can constrain past ice sheet instabilities\n\nAnna Ruth W. Halberstadt, Greg Balco, Hannah Buchband, and Perry Spector\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1623–1643, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1623-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1623-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper explores the use of multimillion-year exposure ages from Antarctic bedrock outcrops to benchmark ice sheet model predictions and thereby infer ice sheet sensitivity to warm climates. We describe a new approach for model–data comparison, highlight an example where observational data are used to distinguish end-member models, and provide guidance for targeted sampling around Antarctica that can improve understanding of ice sheet response to climate warming in the past and future.\n\nExploring ice sheet model sensitivity to ocean thermal forcing and basal sliding using the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM)\n\nMira Berdahl, Gunter Leguy, William H. Lipscomb, Nathan M. Urban, and Matthew J. Hoffman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1513–1543, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1513-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1513-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContributions to future sea level from the Antarctic Ice Sheet remain poorly constrained. One reason is that ice sheet model initialization methods can have significant impacts on how the ice sheet responds to future forcings. We investigate the impacts of two key parameters used during model initialization. We find that these parameter choices alone can impact multi-century sea level rise by up to 2 m, emphasizing the need to carefully consider these choices for sea level rise predictions.\n\nHigh mid-Holocene accumulation rates over West Antarctica inferred from a pervasive ice-penetrating radar reflector\n\nJulien A. Bodart, Robert G. Bingham, Duncan A. Young, Joseph A. MacGregor, David W. Ashmore, Enrica Quartini, Andrew S. Hein, David G. Vaughan, and Donald D. Blankenship\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1497–1512, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1497-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1497-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEstimating how West Antarctica will change in response to future climatic change depends on our understanding of past ice processes. Here, we use a reflector widely visible on airborne radar data across West Antarctica to estimate accumulation rates over the past 4700 years. By comparing our estimates with current atmospheric data, we find that accumulation rates were 18 % greater than modern rates. This has implications for our understanding of past ice processes in the region.\n\nSeasonal and interannual variability of the landfast ice mass balance between 2009 and 2018 in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica\n\nNa Li, Ruibo Lei, Petra Heil, Bin Cheng, Minghu Ding, Zhongxiang Tian, and Bingrui Li\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 917–937, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-917-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-917-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe observed annual maximum landfast ice (LFI) thickness off Zhongshan (Davis) was 1.59±0.17 m (1.64±0.08 m). Larger interannual and local spatial variabilities for the seasonality of LFI were identified at Zhongshan, with the dominant influencing factors of air temperature anomaly, snow atop, local topography and wind regime, and oceanic heat flux. The variability of LFI properties across the study domain prevailed at interannual timescales, over any trend during the recent decades.\n\nMegadunes in Antarctica: migration and characterization from remote and in situ observations\n\nGiacomo Traversa, Davide Fugazza, and Massimo Frezzotti\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 427–444, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-427-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-427-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMegadunes are fields of huge snow dunes present in Antarctica and on other planets, important as they present mass loss on the leeward side (glazed snow), on a continent characterized by mass gain. Here, we studied megadunes using remote data and measurements acquired during past field expeditions. We quantified their physical properties and migration and demonstrated that they migrate against slope and wind. We further proposed automatic detections of the glazed snow on their leeward side.\n\nSlowdown of Shirase Glacier, East Antarctica, caused by strengthening alongshore winds\n\nBertie W. J. Miles, Chris R. Stokes, Adrian Jenkins, Jim R. Jordan, Stewart S. R. Jamieson, and G. Hilmar Gudmundsson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 445–456, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-445-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-445-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite observations have shown that the Shirase Glacier catchment in East Antarctica has been gaining mass over the past 2 decades, a trend largely attributed to increased snowfall. Our multi-decadal observations of Shirase Glacier show that ocean forcing has also contributed to some of this recent mass gain. This has been caused by strengthening easterly winds reducing the inflow of warm water underneath the Shirase ice tongue, causing the glacier to slow down and thicken.\n\nTimescales of outlet-glacier flow with negligible basal friction: theory, observations and modeling\n\nJohannes Feldmann and Anders Levermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 327–348, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-327-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-327-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we present a scaling relation that allows the comparison of the timescales of glaciers with geometric similarity. According to the relation, thicker and wider glaciers on a steeper bed slope have a much faster timescale than shallower, narrower glaciers on a flatter bed slope. The relation is supported by observations and simplified numerical simulations. We combine the scaling relation with a statistical analysis of the topography of 13 instability-prone Antarctic outlet glaciers.\n\nAntarctic contribution to future sea level from ice shelf basal melt as constrained by ice discharge observations\n\nEveline C. van der Linden, Dewi Le Bars, Erwin Lambert, and Sybren Drijfhout\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 79–103, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-79-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-79-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) is the largest uncertainty in future sea level estimates. The AIS mainly loses mass through ice discharge, the transfer of land ice into the ocean. Ice discharge is triggered by warming ocean water (basal melt). New future estimates of AIS sea level contributions are presented in which basal melt is constrained with ice discharge observations. Despite the different methodology, the resulting projections are in line with previous multimodel assessments.\n\nAnthropogenic and internal drivers of wind changes over the Amundsen Sea, West Antarctica, during the 20th and 21st centuries\n\nPaul R. Holland, Gemma K. O'Connor, Thomas J. Bracegirdle, Pierre Dutrieux, Kaitlin A. Naughten, Eric J. Steig, David P. Schneider, Adrian Jenkins, and James A. Smith\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 5085–5105, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-5085-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-5085-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing ice, causing sea-level rise. However, it is not known whether human-induced climate change has contributed to this ice loss. In this study, we use evidence from climate models and palaeoclimate measurements (e.g. ice cores) to suggest that the ice loss was triggered by natural climate variations but is now sustained by human-forced climate change. This implies that future greenhouse-gas emissions may influence sea-level rise from Antarctica.\n\nNew 10Be exposure ages improve Holocene ice sheet thinning history near the grounding line of Pope Glacier, Antarctica\n\nJonathan R. Adams, Joanne S. Johnson, Stephen J. Roberts, Philippa J. Mason, Keir A. Nichols, Ryan A. Venturelli, Klaus Wilcken, Greg Balco, Brent Goehring, Brenda Hall, John Woodward, and Dylan H. Rood\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4887–4905, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4887-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4887-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers in West Antarctica are experiencing significant ice loss. Geological data provide historical context for ongoing ice loss in West Antarctica, including constraints on likely future ice sheet behaviour in response to climatic warming. We present evidence from rare isotopes measured in rocks collected from an outcrop next to Pope Glacier. These data suggest that Pope Glacier thinned faster and sooner after the last ice age than previously thought.\n\nAntarctic surface climate and surface mass balance in the Community Earth System Model versionÂ 2 during the satellite era and into the future (1979â2100)\n\nDevon Dunmire, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Rajashree Tri Datta, and Tessa Gorte\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4163–4184, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4163-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4163-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarth system models (ESMs) are used to model the climate system and the interactions of its components (atmosphere, ocean, etc.) both historically and into the future under different assumptions of human activity. The representation of Antarctica in ESMs is important because it can inform projections of the ice sheet's contribution to sea level rise. Here, we compare output of Antarctica's surface climate from an ESM with observations to understand strengths and weaknesses within the model.\n\nInverting ice surface elevation and velocity for bed topography and slipperiness beneath Thwaites Glacier\n\nHelen Ockenden, Robert G. Bingham, Andrew Curtis, and Daniel Goldberg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3867–3887, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3867-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3867-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHills and valleys hidden under the ice of Thwaites Glacier have an impact on ice flow and future ice loss, but there are not many three-dimensional observations of their location or size. We apply a mathematical theory to new high-resolution observations of the ice surface to predict the bed topography beneath the ice. There is a good correlation with ice-penetrating radar observations. The method may be useful in areas with few direct observations or as a further constraint for other methods.\n\nHysteretic evolution of ice rises and ice rumples in response to variations in sea level\n\nA. Clara J. Henry, Reinhard Drews, Clemens Schannwell, and Vjeran ViÅ¡njeviÄ\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3889–3905, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3889-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3889-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used a 3D, idealised model to study features in coastal Antarctica called ice rises and ice rumples. These features regulate the rate of ice flow into the ocean. We show that when sea level is raised or lowered, the size of these features and the ice flow pattern can change. We find that the features depend on the ice history and do not necessarily fully recover after an equal increase and decrease in sea level. This shows that it is important to initialise models with accurate ice geometry.\n\nVariability in Antarctic surface climatology across regional climate models and reanalysis datasets\n\nJeremy Carter, Amber Leeson, Andrew Orr, Christoph Kittel, and J. Melchior van Wessem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3815–3841, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3815-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3815-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models provide valuable information for studying processes such as the collapse of ice shelves over Antarctica which impact estimates of sea level rise. This paper examines variability across climate simulations over Antarctica for fields including snowfall, temperature and melt. Significant systematic differences between outputs are found, occurring at both large and fine spatial scales across Antarctica. Results are important for future impact assessments and model development.\n\nSensitivity of the Ross Ice Shelf to environmental and glaciological controls\n\nFrancesca Baldacchino, Mathieu Morlighem, Nicholas R. Golledge, Huw Horgan, and Alena Malyarenko\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3723–3738, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3723-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3723-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding how the Ross Ice Shelf will evolve in a warming world is important to the future stability of Antarctica. It remains unclear what changes could drive the largest mass loss in the future and where places are most likely to trigger larger mass losses. Sensitivity maps are modelled showing that the RIS is sensitive to changes in environmental and glaciological controls at regions which are currently experiencing changes. These regions need to be monitored in a warming world.\n\nHigh-resolution subglacial topography around Dome Fuji, Antarctica, based on ground-based radar surveys over 30 years\n\nShun Tsutaki, Shuji Fujita, Kenji Kawamura, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Kotaro Fukui, Hideaki Motoyama, Yu Hoshina, Fumio Nakazawa, Takashi Obase, Hiroshi Ohno, Ikumi Oyabu, Fuyuki Saito, Konosuke Sugiura, and Toshitaka Suzuki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2967–2983, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2967-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2967-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe constructed an ice thickness map across the Dome Fuji region, East Antarctica, from improved radar data and previous data that had been collected since the late 1980s. The data acquired using the improved radar systems allowed basal topography to be identified with higher accuracy. The new ice thickness data show the bedrock topography, particularly the complex terrain of subglacial valleys and highlands south of Dome Fuji, with substantially high detail.\n\nCosmogenic nuclide dating of two stacked ice masses: Ong Valley, Antarctica\n\nMarie Bergelin, Jaakko Putkonen, Greg Balco, Daniel Morgan, Lee B. Corbett, and Paul R. Bierman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2793–2817, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2793-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2793-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacier ice contains information on past climate and can help us understand how the world changes through time. We have found and sampled a buried ice mass in Antarctica that is much older than most ice on Earth and difficult to date. Therefore, we developed a new dating application which showed the ice to be 3 million years old. Our new dating solution will potentially help to date other ancient ice masses since such old glacial ice could yield data on past environmental conditions on Earth.\n\nCited articles"
