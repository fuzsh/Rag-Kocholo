        "text": "PJ. They say only the good die young. You will obviously be missed by everyone whose life you crossed. To you Karen. I know you are a strong, responsible girl. It seems like yesterday we were having our hair done for the wedding. This is going to be difficult, but you will get through it with support of your friends and family. It will all seem like a horrible nightmare sometimes and you will want to just wake up and have things back to normal. Be strong and know that your family and friends are there for you. You and the children have each other, so do lean on each other for support. Out of sight but not out of mind ... But just to tell you how news spreads .. I am in Norway and got the news today. You are in my thoughts and prayers and I will do a nine day novena for you all. Lots of Love Carey Phillipps Ever since I can remember being a part of the RJYC sailing family, some 16 years now, PJ has always been a vibrant part of the memories that will always stand out. We had a special bond because of the role that we were privileged to play on our respective boats, that of being foredeck crew. PJ and I would go through every detail of our spinnaker sets, gybes and douses comparing techniques and trading secrets on how even the smallest details could be done more efficiently. None of this however, would come before a tip of the hat or a salute to each other as we passed in the marina in the midst of preparing our foredecks for the race ahead. On the way back in after every sail was doused, \"Spinnaker went up clean PJ!!\" \"Yours too Laz! What a pretty gybe!!\" We were proud to do the \"madman\" job on the boat as we sometimes referred to it, and we were in agreement that not even the skipper was allowed forward of the mast. Farewell my friend, and cheers to a life lived with love for all, to the fullest and without regret. We will miss you. -Laz I have known PJ since we were 8 years old and if one word could describe him, it would be \"consistent\". Talk about \"set in your ways\", there was no changing this boy and certainly no possibility of budging the man he became. I had tremendous respect for him as a man who was not afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve. As a friend, if he loved you, you felt it both inside and out with the characteristic inappropriate hugs and kisses that only PJ could do and get away with. No matter who you were or where you came from, he either had a kind word or a bad word for you. No matter which one you got, you always felt special in the end. He made no apologies for his behaviour and made that fact very clear. He is the only person I know that can engage the biggest, baddest \"bad man\" downtown, tell him a string of bad words (for this he was very talented at) and in the blink of an eye, be hugging him and sitting down for a drink! HE IS UNFORGETTABLE, even if you only met him is passing. As a husband, he was passionate about Karen, telling me repeatedly, that he had three children... but only one of her, and she was his keystone. As a father, he was on a pedestal of his own. He loved all children, his and yours and would correct everyone without hesitation. PJ was the black\\white, yes\\no sort of guy. No grey areas and no guessing. If you wanted to know, all you had to do was ask. What a man can read nuff and fast!!!! Year after year after year at Silver Sands he would read almost a book a day, and still find time to clown with the kids or in the usual game of dominoes, apologize profusely for the “pass” I was about to receive or predict the dead double in my hand to his “pardee”. As a seaman, I never sailed around the buoys with him, but as far as off-shore is concerned, he was priceless. That brute had a stomach of steel and in the typical blow to Bowden on Gallivant, while everyone else would be turning all shades of green, he would go below and bring up a sip of rum to keep himself warm but not before checking with the \"Skip\" and crew if he could bring up something for them too. He handled himself with precision in all conditions. The self-appointed anchor watchman could be seen on deck, fast asleep in his characteristic jeans with sailing gloves on, \"just in case\". PJ Thwaites - to your famous question \"You know who I am?\" I say, we know who you are, and as you have left a piece of you with each of us, you will continue to live on dearly in our hearts. May the favour of heaven bless you with everlasting happiness, and may you finally go in to port with your heart filled with peace and joy. BTW - I love you too Cookie PJ was my best friend and co-troublemaker since we met the first day of school in September 1979 at Campion. I will never forget that first day of school when Father Ruddy gave him a detention for simply being the youngest cousin and brother of Brett/Evan/Tweety/Barbara/Nancy Thwaites...!!! We sailed Mirror Dinghies together, having cobbled together my dinghy \"Deliverance\" from several left over kits. We had many a wonderful race against our arch nemesis, Al Stewart; many a fight over tactics (which usually culminated with PJ reaching over the side, grabbing a Kingston Harbour jellyfish and clobbering me with it!!). We let the air out of a prominent member's car tires because he parked his car, blocking the Mirror launching dock and ruining our morning sail. Life with PJ was always fun, he was one of the few people I knew who, when he called you friend, let you into his heart forever. He demonstrated it with that Million MegaWatt smile when he saw you, a huge hug and a reach around to grab a handful of my arse!! Our fathers actually met to discuss what boarding schools we were going to be sent to, the further the better because they knew if we were within 100 miles of each other we would get up to no good!! PJ, I will miss you forever. I hope Laura's & my daughter will enjoy a friendship like ours. I love you and your wonderful family. Godspeed, raise up a great domino game and meet me at the Pearly Gates with that world famous PJ grin!!! One of my favorite writers had this to say about sailing, and the more I read it...the more I was drawn to share. I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving: To reach the port of heaven, we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it - but...we must sail. (Oliver Wendel Holmes) Two things of note...our PJ is definitely in port now, and he got there by sailing some tough and treacherous seas. I have thought many nights since Tuesday about where you are, and what you're up to. I am sure that you have your shades on, a cig out of the side of your mouth, and are sitting at some dominoe table somewhere berating the pour chap under your hand about his double six that you're about to send to the waves. It cannot be measured how much you are, and will be missed by so many, and I give you my solemn promise that I will be by your children's side as if they are my own. I have known PJ for over 35 years, sailing at the RJYC since our pre-teens. PJ was a unique member of our sailing fraternity, and his memory will endure in no small part due to time well spent. We began sailing in Mirror Dinghies at the RJYC in the mid 1970's, racing with other \"young\" members including Ian Chandley, John Ralston, David Allen (alright, not so young!), Harry and Andrew Harper to name a few.... so many happy memories and a solid foundation in seamanship, friendship and life. PJ was one of those special people that I was always happy to encounter; you could always count on him to brighten the time spent together with his humour, quick wit, and always that smile. He was a deeply caring person, and one who provided me with valuable counsel when I finished studies and joined him in the working world. To Karen, Racquel, Peter John Jr, Chloe, parents Peter John and Mary, Nancy and the rest of his family, friends and loved ones, I extend our love, thoughts, prayers and support as best we can. To PJ, you earned my undying respect as a man, a father, a fellow competitive sailor and friend. Fair winds and following seas my brother, 'til we meet again. Yours aye, Al & Tanya Stewart S/V CHEN"
