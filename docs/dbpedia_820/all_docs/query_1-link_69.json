        "text": "Hereâ€™s a great musing that I read on LinkedIn: How will alternative primary care models fare when growth mode gets balanced with profitability and VC-supported burn rate is transformed to Big Retail bottom-line expectations? Mission v. margin. (from a great post by Benjamin Schwartz, MD, MBA - link in show notes.) Iâ€™m gonna add to this: How will alternative primary care models, or even just doing good primary care, fare when it encounters the current system rife with perverse incentives of all kinds, including Big Retail bottom-line expectations but also Big Health System and Big Payer bottom-line expectations and current business models? This show from last year was wildly popularâ€”maybe one of our most popular showsâ€”and relisten to it in the current context of whatâ€™s going on right now in the primary care and MSO (Managed Services Only) space. Coming up, Iâ€™m gonna probably do a whole show on this if I can get my act together; but this encore is really relevant right now.

Whoâ€™s winning and what does this mean for the healthcare consumer? Join James A. Gardner, Director, Healthcare Strategy, at OHO Interactive and host Alan Tam as they explore and discuss the future of primary care, whatâ€™s motivating these giants, what moves theyâ€™ve already made, and what might happen next. Retail health leaders like Walgreens, CVS Health, Walmart, Amazon, and Dollar General are remaking primary care with their ambitious plans to deliver at-scale health and wellness services. For traditional care delivery organizations, risks and opportunities are abound in this fast-changing landscape. This conversation is brought to you by Actium Health in partnership with the Forum for Healthcare Strategists. #hmps23 #healthcaremarketing #hellohealthcare #podcast #healthcare #healthcarestrategy Listen on your favorite podcast app.\n\nThe other problem we are taking up in this healthcare podcast as it relates to healthcare delivery organizations who have rolled up or consolidated and are led with centralized control is the Diversification Discount. The Diversification Discount is actually a Wall Street word, and it means that companies doing a whole bunch of different things might wind up with a lower stock price than companies who do one thing really well or only do things that have the same business model.

Gardner, and I had a lovely and insightful conversation with Creagh Milford, DO, MPH, Vice President of Retail Health Services at CVS Health on the Healthcare Rap Podcast. Dr. Milford talked us through the ins and outs of \"retail health,\" explained how CVS Health is partnering with health systems nationwide, and how the organization thinks about putting health consumers first. The episode drops in a couple of weeks.

Starbucks dropped 16% yesterday and had its worst day in the market in years. \"The company missed on all metrics (revenue, earnings, and same-store sales), with foot traffic declining across the globe.\" Yahoo Finance. 2. CVS Health also got trounced yesterday with its stock down 17%. After plans feasted on Medicare Advantage the last couple of years, this area is getting a lot tougher. 3. The markets soared after Chairman Powell spoke. Then the markets gave back all of their gains and then some by the end of the day. Currently futures point up today. 4. Apple reports earnings after the bell today. 5. Job openings are decreasing in the US. This ultimately has the potential to bring down wage inflation and also move the Fed on rates. Not yet but this will help. 6. Walmart Health threw in the towel on more core health care clinics. See number 7. 7. Many of the big disruptors in health care are learning what we all know. There aren't enough doctors, stupid. Listen to this short podcast at either Becker Private Equity and Business Podcast or the Becker's Healthcare podcast.\n\nIT'S HERE.

Gardner Mitch Holdwick\n\nDiving into Value-Based Care! This afternoon, we had a lovely conversation with Dr. Bartley Bryt and Mark Foulke from Privia Health. We spent most of the show talking about the ins and outs of value-based care arrangements, what is essential for physician practices to get right, and how technology is only part of that solution. Also, did you know that CMS will require ALL their covered lives to be in value-based arrangements by 2030? That sounds like a massive call to action; what do you think, Jared Johnson? #healthcare #podcast #valuebased #innovation"
