Conversely, an association between the HLA-B∗15:01 allele and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated individuals was recently reported, suggesting a contribution of pre-existing T cell-dependent adaptive immunity. We report a lack of association of classical HLA alleles, including HLA-B∗15:01, with pre-omicron asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated participants in a prospective population-based study in the United States (191 asymptomatic vs. 945 symptomatic COVID-19 cases). Moreover, we found no such association in the international COVID Human Genetic Effort cohort (206 asymptomatic vs. 574 mild or moderate COVID-19 cases and 1,625 severe or critical COVID-19 cases). Finally, in the Human Challenge Characterisation study, the three HLA-B∗15:01 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed symptoms. As with other acute primary infections studied, no classical HLA alleles favoring an asymptomatic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified.\n\nKeywords: HLA, association, asymptomatic infection, COVID-19, population stratification\n\nThis study shows that HLA alleles, including HLA-B∗15:01, are not associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in two independent cohorts. These results refute previous reports. HLA alleles do not strongly influence the phenotypic outcome during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPrimary infection with SARS-CoV-2 underlies a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations in unvaccinated individuals, ranging from silent infection to lethal COVID-19 pneumonia. Rare and common human genetic variants have been associated with hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia.1,2,3,4,5,6 Inborn errors of TLR3- and/or TLR7-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity underlie critical COVID-19 pneumonia in 1%–5% of cases.1,7,8,9 Moreover, autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN underlie at least another 15% of cases,10,11,12 further highlighting the key role of type I IFNs in protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract. While inborn errors are preferentially found in young patients with critical COVID-19 cases, the autoantibodies are more common in the elderly.3 Common variants in or near genes involved in viral entry into respiratory cells or airway defense have also been associated with severe COVID-19.5 In contrast, only a few associations between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and COVID-19 severity were consistently reported in the many studies that tested the hypothesis that HLA genes would be associated with COVID-19 because of their well-established role in T cell responses to viruses.13,14 The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative analyzed more than 20,000 cases and 2,000,000 controls (data freeze 6) to identify their first association between an HLA allele and COVID-19 severity: HLA-DRB1∗04:01 conferred a small decrease in the risk of critical COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.8).2,5\n\nWhile human genetics proved fruitful to decipher some causes of severe COVID-19, very few studies investigated why a small percentage of unvaccinated adults presented with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.6 In this context, in July 2023, an association was reported between the HLA-B∗15:01 allele and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated individuals.15 The OR was 2.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.54–3.64) for heterozygotes, reaching 8.58 (95% CI: 1.74–34.43) in homozygotes. The authors replicated this association in a smaller independent cohort. This study further showed that T cells from HLA-B∗15:01 individuals who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 recognized a SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitope by cross-reactivity due to prior exposure to one of two common cold coronaviruses: OC43-CoV or HKU1-CoV.15 Moreover, more than 100 immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides are highly similar to peptides from at least one human coronavirus (hCoV) presented by a wide range of classical HLA molecules.16 We, therefore, tested the hypothesis of an association between HLA alleles and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in two independent cohorts. We aimed (1) to test the association with HLA-B∗15:01 and (2) to identify additional HLA alleles potentially associated with asymptomatic COVID-19.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nCohorts and phenotype information\n\nUS prospective cohort\n\nParticipants in the US prospective cohort came from two studies: the Helix DNA Discovery Project and the Healthy Nevada Project. All enrolled participants provided written informed consent for participation and were recruited through protocols conforming to local ethics requirements. Participants were recruited before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed an online survey that we sent a few times in 2021. The survey takes about 15 min to complete and has been published in the past.17 We received responses from 8,125 unique Helix DNA Discovery Project participants and 9,315 unique Healthy Nevada Project participants. The participants in this cohort were 18–89+ years old, 65% were female, and 85% were of European genetic similarity. The respondents indicated whether they had been infected and whether they had been vaccinated, as well as information on exposure, reasons for testing, and comorbidities. They rated the severity and duration of their symptoms and disease. They answered questions about 24 specific symptoms known to occur after SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThis cohort was previously included in the large meta-analysis of the COVID-Host Genetic initiative genome-wide association study (GWAS) for susceptibility to infection. In the data freeze 7, 1,000 cases and 10,000 controls came from this cohort representing fewer than 1% of cases and 5% of total controls.5 More recently, this cohort was used to identify the association between HLA-A∗03:01 and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine side effects.17\n\nCHGE cohort\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, the COVID Human Genetic Effort (CHGE) has enrolled more than 10,000 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and broad clinical manifestations from all over the world. All the enrolled participants provided written informed consent for participation and were recruited through various protocols and cohorts, including the COVIDeF cohort, the French COVID cohort, the CoV-Contact Cohort, the Orchestra Working Group, the Amsterdam UMC COVID-19 Biobank, the NIAID-USUHS COVID study, and the COVID-STORM study (see supplemental methods), aiming at recruiting both hospitalized COVID-19 cases and infected controls. The physicians classified the patients according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria,18 as follows: (1) Critical cases were defined as hospitalized patients with pneumonia requiring high-flow oxygen (>6 L/min) and/or requiring admission to the intensive care unit (WHO score ≥6); (2) severe cases were defined as hospitalized patients with pneumonia requiring low-flow oxygen (WHO score = 5); (3) moderate cases were defined as hospitalized patients with pneumonia not requiring oxygen (WHO score = 4); (4) mild cases were defined as pauci-symptomatic ambulatory patients, with the presence of mild, self-healing symptoms such as cough, fever, body aches, or anosmia (WHO score = 2 or 3); and (5) asymptomatic cases were defined as infected individuals with no symptoms, having a score of 1 in the WHO clinical progression scale.18 The presence of infection was assessed on the basis of a positive PCR test and/or serological test and/or the presence of typical symptoms such as anosmia or ageusia after exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case.\n\nSome of the samples of this cohort were previously included in studies focusing on the genetic causes of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.1,7,9 The largest overlap is with the genome-wide burden screen of rare coding variants associated with critical COVID-19 pneumonia published in 2023 in Genome Medicine,7 in which most of the critical patients of the present study were included as cases, and most of the asymptomatic and mild individuals were included as controls. By contrast, most of the moderate and severe patients have not been analyzed so far. HLA association has never been previously investigated in any of the samples of the CHGE dataset.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Characterisation Study\n\nThirty-six participants were recruited, two became seropositive to spike protein prior to study start. The 34 seronegative participants were challenged with D614G-containing pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2, of whom 33 consented for genetic analysis and were analyzed in the present study. Additional details on the study design and participants were previously published.19,20 Ethics approval was obtained from the UK Health Research Authority Ad Hoc Specialist Ethics Committee (reference 20/UK/0002). Written informed consent was obtained from participants before screening and enrollment.\n\nSequencing\n\nUS prospective cohort\n\nDNA samples were sequenced and analyzed at Helix with the Exome+ assay, which targets the exome and a few hundred thousand non-exonic common SNPs, providing a backbone for imputation of the most common SNPs in the genome as previously described.21 Genotype processing was performed in Hail.22\n\nFor each individual, we ran a supervised ADMIXTURE23 algorithm with k = 5 populations using the 1000 Genomes dataset. From these admixture coefficients, we then labeled each individual with one genetic similarity using the following decision tree:\n\n- If (ADMIX_EUR>0.85) & (ADMIX_AFR<0.1) & (ADMIX_AMR<0.1) & (ADMIX_EAS<0.1) & (ADMIX_SAS<0.1) then “Europe”\n\n- Else If ADMIX_EAS>0.6 then “East Asia”\n\n- Else If ADMIX_SAS>0.6 then “South Asia”\n\n- Else If (ADMIX_AFR >0.3) & (ADMIX_EAS<0.1) & (ADMIX_SAS<0.1) & (ADMIX_AFR > ADMIX_AMR) then “Africa”\n\n- Else If (ADMIX_AMR>0.1) & (ADMIX_EAS<0.1) & (ADMIX_SAS<0.1) then “Americas”\n\n- Else is “Other”\n\nPrincipal-component analysis (PCA) was done using a set of 184,445 coding and noncoding LD-pruned, high-quality common variants. Eigenvalues and scores were calculated using the hwe_normalized_pca function in Hail.\n\nCHGE cohort\n\nWhole-exome (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed at several sequencing centers, including the Genomics Core Facility of the Imagine Institute (Paris, France), the Yale Center for Genome Analysis (USA), Macrogen (USA), Psomagen (USA), the New York Genome Center (NY, USA), the American Genome Center (USUHS, Bethesda, MD, USA), MNM Bioscience (Poland), Invitae (San Francisco, CA, USA), the Genomic Sequencing Platform Seqoia (France), the Centre National de Recherche en Génomique Humaine (CNRGH, Evry, France), the Genomics Division-ITER of the Canarian Health System sequencing hub (Canary Islands, Spain), and the AlJalila Genomics Center (Dubai). Libraries for WES were generated with the Twist and Twist Plus Human Core Exome Kit, the xGen Exome Research Panel from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT; xGen V1 and V2), Agilent SureSelect (Human All Exon V6 and V7) panels, the SeqCap EZ MedExome Kit from Roche, the Nextera Flex for Enrichment-Exome kit, the Illumina TruSeq Exome panel, and WES custom target enrichment probes. Massively parallel sequencing was performed on HiSeq 4000, HiSeq 2500, NextSeq 550, or NovaSeq 6000 systems (Illumina).\n\nFor PCA, common variants from the gnomAD v2.1 Exome dataset were jointly genotyped with GATK GenotypeGVCFs. PCA was performed with PLINK v1.9 software on a pruned set of ∼14,600 SNPs not in linkage disequilibrium (maximum r2 value for linkage disequilibrium of 0.4 between pairs of SNPs), with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >1%, a call rate >99%, and p value for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium >10−5, as previously described.24 The ancestral origin of the patients was further inferred from the PCA, as previously described.24\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Characterisation Study\n\nWGS was performed on Illumina NovaSeq (Novogene Ltd., UK), yielding 150 bp paired-end reads. The average depth of coverage was >50x with a minimum of 31x. PCA and global ancestry inference were performed using Hail according to the protocol described by the gnomAD project.25\n\nHLA calls/imputation\n\nUS prospective cohort\n\nHLA alleles were imputed for seven genes: HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 with HIBAG using the default recommendations.26 Individual genotypes were imputed with the model that was the most appropriate based on the genetic similarity for each individual. Specifically, we used the African model for individuals in the Africa genetic similarity group, the Asian model for those in the East Asia or the South Asia genetic similarity groups, the European model for those in the Europe or Other genetic similarity groups, and the Hispanic model for those in the Americas genetic similarity group. Models were downloaded from https://hibag.s3.amazonaws.com/hlares_index.html. As an example, the European model was the HLA4-hg19.RData model (available: https://hibag.s3.amazonaws.com/download/hlares_param/European-HLA4.html). Probabilities greater than 0.5 were used for genotype calling. All alleles had p value for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium >10−4.\n\nCHGE cohort\n\nClassical class I and class II HLA alleles were typed from the raw WES or WGS reads with HLA∗LA software,27 which uses a linear projection method to align reads to a population reference graph and enables high HLA typing accuracy from WES or WGS data. Alleles with p value for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium <10−4 were excluded.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Characterisation Study\n\nHLA alleles were typed from raw WGS reads with HLA∗LA software at G group resolution. Only HLA calls with a posterior probability of 100% and a minimum coverage of 20x were retained in the analysis. At the B locus, all individual calls fulfilled these filtering criteria at 2-field resolution.\n\nThese tools have been validated for their accuracy to call HLA alleles at 2-field resolution, particularly in populations of European ancestry.26,28,29,30 For example, the HIBAG HLA calls made at Helix for seven genes in seven European ancestry Coriell samples showed 99% concordance with the known HLA calls for these individuals. Inferred HLA alleles between HIBAG and HLA∗LA were more than 96% identical at four-digit resolution in the COVID-HGI study.2 Differences caused by HLA allele calling should mostly be limited to rare HLA types and populations with poor imputation references.\n\nHLA-WAS\n\nWe used Regenie31 for the genetic analysis. In brief, this method builds a whole-genome regression model based on common variants to account for the effects of relatedness and population stratification; it also accounts for situations in which there is an extreme case-control imbalance likely to lead to test statistic inflation with other analysis methods. We used the approximate Firth p value when the logistic regression p value was below 0.01. The covariates included were age group, sex, and the first five principal components, as recommended to accurately correct for population structure.31 We used a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.\n\nFor the US prospective cohort, a representative set of 184,445 coding and noncoding LD-pruned, high-quality common variants were identified for the construction of PCs and the whole-genome regression model, as previously described.21 PCs were calculated within the European group. For CHGE, the set of ∼14,600 SNPs used for PCA within the European group was used for the whole-genome regression model.\n\nPower calculation\n\nWe estimated the power required to detect an effect similar to that reported by Augusto et al. with the Genetic Association Study (GAS) Power Calculator, which uses a method derived from the CaTS power calculator for two-stage association studies.33 Power was first estimated as a function of the OR for the specific replication of the HLA-B∗15:01 association using the following parameters: allele frequency of 0.05; prevalence of asymptomatic infection: 0.1; Dominant inheritance model; type I error of 0.05; numbers of cases and controls according to the third definition in both cohorts. In a second step we estimated the power to detect an association in the context of an HLA-wide screen (i.e., using a type I error of 5 × 10−4) as a function of the OR and for various allele frequencies using a sample size either corresponding to our combined samples (400 cases and 3,000 controls) or a sample size which would be 10 times larger (4,000 cases and 30,000 controls).\n\nSerology\n\nPlasma immunoglobulin (Ig)G titers for the SARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Characterisation Study participants were determined using MesoScale Discovery Coronavirus panel 2 plates on an SQ120 instrument. Binding titers given as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) based on a kit-provided human plasma standard curve.\n\nResults\n\nHLA-wide association in the US prospective cohort\n\nWe first conducted an HLA-wide association study (HLA-WAS) in a prospective population-based US cohort ( ). The 17,434 adults who responded to at least one of the COVID-19 infection and vaccination surveys sent in 2021 included 1,680 participants reporting SARS-CoV-2 infection while unvaccinated. A continuous spectrum of symptoms, duration of illness was reported following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S1). The most common symptoms were muscle and body aches, and a cough (Figure S1A). No symptoms at all were reported by 5.1% of individuals (n = 86), whereas 5.3% of the infected participants required hospitalization with or without oxygen therapy (n = 58) or were admitted to the intensive care unit (n = 31) (Figure S1B). We tested the hypothesis that HLA alleles play an important role in the early response to SARS-CoV-2 by considering three case definitions for the asymptomatic cases ( A): (1) “0 symptoms” was a stringent definition of asymptomatic as a total absence of symptoms (n = 86); (2) “Max 1 day” was a definition of asymptomatic in which the presence of one symptom for no more than 1 day was tolerated (n = 111). This definition was used to increase the power for detection of an association by enlarging the “asymptomatic” group while still identifying individuals who cleared the virus quickly and efficiently; (3) “Max 2 days” was a definition as close as possible to that used by Augusto et al., considering participants to be asymptomatic if none of their symptoms lasted 3 days or more, and if the reason for testing was unrelated to symptoms (n = 286).15 We used only one definition for controls (individuals with symptoms lasting at least 3 days). The control group included all individuals admitted to the intensive care unit or the hospital and anyone reporting symptoms of at least 3 days’ duration with some impact on their daily routine (n = 1,247). For the HLA-WAS, we restricted the analysis to individuals who were genetically similar to a reference group from Europe often denoted as individuals of “European ancestry” (Figures S1C and S1D), leading to a total of 59 to 191 asymptomatic cases and of 945 symptomatic controls ( A). Age and sex distribution are shown in Table S1. The association test was performed with Regenie31 under a dominant inheritance model, with age, sex, and the first five principal components as covariates (see supplemental methods). The risk of detecting false-positive associations was decreased by limiting the analysis to the 105 HLA alleles with an allele frequency of at least 1% in this cohort. No statistically significant associations (at a corrected threshold of p < 0.00048) were found with any of the three phenotype definitions ( and S2–S4). The top-ranked HLA allele was DRB1∗16:01, which was depleted in asymptomatic individuals, with the strongest effect being observed in the “Max 2 days” group of asymptomatic patients (OR [95% CI] = 0.06 [0–1.5], p = 0.004, pcorrected = 0.42, ).\n\nTable 1\n\nAlleleOR [95% CI]aRaw p valuebAFcAsymptomatic definitiondDRB1∗16:010.06 [0.002–1.5]0.0040.012Max 2 daysA∗32:012.19 [1.3–3.8]0.0080.035Max 2 daysB∗07:021.58 [1.1–2.3]0.0160.13Max 2 daysC∗07:021.53 [1.1–2.2]0.0200.14Max 2 daysDQB1∗06:021.52 [1.1–2.2]0.0250.14Max 2 daysDQB1∗05:020.29 [0.1–1.1]0.0370.015Max 2 days\n\nHLA-wide association in the CHGE cohort\n\nWe next studied patients recruited by the physicians of the international CHGE consortium. These physicians classified participants with SARS-CoV-2 infections according to acute disease severity: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, or critical (Figure S2A). Whole-exome or WGS data were available for 7,229 participants and HLA alleles were typed with HLA∗LA.27 In this HLA-WAS, we compared the patients classified as “asymptomatic” by the clinicians (n = 311) with those in three sets of symptomatic controls: (1) the patients with the most extreme symptoms requiring hospitalization and oxygen supplementation (i.e., those with a severe or critical form of the disease, n = 4,451); (2) all symptomatic patients, whatever their acute disease severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe or critical, n = 5,682); and (3) symptomatic patients not requiring oxygen supplementation (i.e., mild and moderate patients only, n = 1,231); this last group of symptomatic patients is the most similar to the symptomatic patients groups of the US prospective cohort and the study by Augusto et al. ( ). We restricted the analysis to individuals of European genetic ancestry and the final study population comprised 206 asymptomatic cases, 1,625 patients with severe or critical disease, and 574 patients with mild or moderate disease (Figures S2B and S2C). Age and sex distribution are shown in Table S1. Analyses were also performed under a dominant inheritance model with age group, sex, and the first five principal components as covariates. This analysis was performed with Regenie and was limited to the 114 HLA alleles with an allele frequency of at least 1% in this cohort. No statistically significant association (at a corrected threshold of p < 0.00044) was identified in the HLA-WAS, regardless of the definition of symptomatic patients used (Tables S5–S7). The top-ranked HLA allele found to be enriched in asymptomatic individuals was HLA-B∗40:02, for which the strongest effect was observed in comparison with the group of symptomatic patients with severe or critical disease (OR [95% CI] = 3.4 [1.5–7.7], p = 0.005; pcorrected = 0.57, ).\n\nTable 2\n\nAlleleOR [95% CI]aRaw p valuebAFcControls useddB∗40:023.42 [1.5–7.7]0.0050.016Severe + CriticalDPB1∗01:010.28 [0.1–0.8]0.0070.042Severe + CriticalA∗23:012.5 [1.2–5.0]0.0100.023Mild + ModerateB∗49:012.26 [1.2–4.3]0.0140.031Mild + ModerateA∗03:011.66 [1.1–2.5]0.0190.12Severe + CriticalDQA1∗01:021.54 [1.1–2.2]0.0220.18Mild + ModerateA∗30:022.46 [1.1–5.6]0.0310.019Mild + ModerateB∗57:010.47 [0.2–1.0]0.0470.027Mild + ModerateA∗68:023.53 [1.0–12.2]0.0470.01Mild + ModerateDPB1∗03:010.65 [0.4–1.0]0.0490.093Mild + Moderate\n\nHLA-wide meta-analysis\n\nWe then performed three meta-analyses, denoted M1, M2, and M3 ( B), combining the results from our two independent cohorts with METAL.32 The first used the strictest definitions for the groups: the HLA-WAS with the “0 symptoms” group of asymptomatic patients in the US prospective cohort and the HLA-WAS limited to patients with severe and critical disease only in the CHGE cohort (Table S8). The second meta-analysis combined the HLA-WAS with the “Max 1 day” definition of asymptomatic patients for the US prospective cohort (0 symptoms or one symptom for 1 day) with the HLA-WAS with all symptomatic cases from the CHGE (Table S9). The final meta-analysis used the results for the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups most closely resembling those of the study by Augusto et al. (Table S10). The meta-analyses detected no statistically significant associations (at a corrected threshold of p < 0.00053, 95 alleles tested) between HLA alleles and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection ( and S8–S10). The top-ranked HLA allele was HLA-B∗40:02 (p value = 0.0008, pcorrected = 0.095), for which enrichment was observed in asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals in both cohorts and in the meta-analysis based on the strictest definitions. Of note, this allele has exactly the same frequency in cases and controls in the study of Augusto et al.15\n\nTable 3\n\nAlleleMeta-analysisUS prospective cohortcCHGE cohortcMeta-analysis numberOR [95% CI]aRaw p valuebCorrected p valueOR [95% CI]aRaw p valueOR [95% CI]aRaw p valueB∗40:02M13.51 [1.7–7.3]0.00080.0954.05 [0.7–24.6]0.1283.42 [1.5–7.7]0.005DPB1∗01:01M20.43 [0.3–0.7]0.00150.170.43 [0.2–1.0]0.0580.43 [0.2–0.8]0.010DQA1∗01:02M31.41 [1.1–1.8]0.0070.801.31 [0.9–1.8]0.1191.54 [1.1–2.2]0.022A∗23:01M22.22 [1.2–4.0]0.0070.822.14 [0.7–6.6]0.1862.25 [1.1–4.4]0.019DQB1∗06:02M31.46 [1.1–2.0]0.01311.52 [1.1–2.2]0.0251.33 [0.8–2.2]0.276C∗03:03M10.52 [0.3–0.9]0.01510.48 [0.2–1.2]0.1320.54 [0.3–1.0]0.055B∗49:01M31.96 [1.1–3.4]0.01911.29 [0.4–3.9]0.6572.26 [1.2–4.3]0.014B∗07:02M31.42 [1.1–1.9]0.02111.58 [1.1–2.3]0.0161.16 [0.7–1.9]0.554DRB1∗15:01M31.38 [1.0–1.9]0.03711.42 [1–2.1]0.0751.32 [0.8–2.2]0.264\n\nLack of replication for HLA-B∗15:01\n\nAn analysis focusing on HLA-B∗15:01 did not replicate the association between HLA-B∗15:01 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection ( A and 2B; ) despite being well powered (>95%) to detect an effect similar to that reported by Augusto et al. (OR of 2.40 for enrichment in asymptomatic vs. symptomatic patients, p = 5.67 × 10−5) (Figure S3). We further estimated the frequency of HLA-B∗15:01 in various groups of patients of the CHGE consortium, including children with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by multisystem inflammatory syndrome (classified as MIS-C) and individuals with high levels of exposure who never tested positive (classified as “resistors”).34,35 This frequency ranged from 2.4% in asymptomatic individuals to 6.0% in resistors ( C). We also looked at individuals from non-European genetic ancestries. Similarly, we found no difference in frequency between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals ( D and Table S11). Overall, no enrichment in the HLA-B∗15:01 allele was observed among asymptomatic individuals in our US population-based prospective cohort, or in the international CHGE cohort.\n\nTable 4\n\nAnalysisAF asymptomatic casesaAF symptomatic controlsaOR [95% CI]bRaw p valueUS prospective cohort0.0670.0630.96 [0.58–1.6]0.89CHGE cohort0.0240.0300.74 [0.36–1.53]0.42Meta-analysis M3––0.88 [0.58–1.34]0.56\n\nSymptoms and serology for participants with HLA-B∗15:01 in the SARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Characterisation Study\n\nThe mechanism proposed as an explanation for the association between HLA-B∗15:01 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was pre-existing immunity, probably due to prior infection with OC43-CoV or HKU1-CoV.15 Unfortunately, no serological data were available for the HLA-B∗15:01 carriers in the US prospective and the CHGE cohorts. We tested the hypothesis that the lack of association in our study was due to an absence of prior infection with OC43-CoV or HKU1-CoV by examining the data for the SARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Characterisation Study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04865237\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04865237\"}}NCT04865237; funder, UK Vaccine Taskforce), in which 34 participants seronegative to spike protein were challenged with D614G-containing pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2, of whom 33 consented for genetic analysis.19 Serological data, history of prior infections with other coronaviruses, and genetic data were available, together with infection status and data concerning the recorded symptoms. HLA alleles were called with HLA∗LA from whole-genome sequences obtained from the participants. Three of the 17 infected participants (positive test result) carried an HLA-B∗15:01 allele, as well as three of the 16 who stayed uninfected. Only one of the 17 infected participants was fully asymptomatic and this participant did not carry the HLA-B∗15:01 allele. The three infected participants with an HLA-B∗15:01 allele were symptomatic ( ), despite evidence of prior exposure to OC43-CoV and HKU1-CoV (Figure S4). Thus, prior exposure to a coronavirus did not prevent the HLA-B∗15:01 carriers from developing symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur analyses identified no associations between classical HLA alleles and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, we did not replicate the previously reported association between HLA-B∗15:01 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite being well powered (>95%) for this specific replication study. Another recent study in a Spanish cohort found no associations between classical HLA alleles and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.36 One possible explanation for the difference in results regarding HLA-B∗15:01 is that the studies analyzed different groups of individuals living in different environments. However, the US prospective cohort we analyzed has many features in common with the cohort analyzed by Augusto et al.: specifically, the participants were from the United States, with a slight bias toward women, and the phenotype was assessed on the basis of self-reported surveys at multiple time points during the pandemic before summer 2021 (before the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became dominant in the United States37). The percentage of individuals self-reporting asymptomatic infection was similar between the two, as were the rates of each symptom. Alternatively, the difference in results may reflect differences in the handling of potential population stratification. Augusto et al. did not consider population structure in their study on bone marrow donors, probably because no genetic information outside of the HLA region was available, whereas we accounted for population structure by restricting our analysis to those of European ancestry and including the first five principal components as covariates in our regression model. The highly polymorphic nature of the HLA region and the differences in allele frequencies between human sub-populations contribute to a high risk of false-positive results in association analyses. The frequency of HLA-B∗15:01 is known to vary across continents, between continental populations within the United States (Figure S5A), and even between European countries (Figure S5B). Augusto et al. used self-identified race (White) to select their participants; however, this is not an appropriate proxy of genetic ancestry.38 Population stratification may, thus, have played a confounding role in their study.\n\nOverall, the absence of an association between classical HLA alleles and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is consistent with the modest impact of HLA variation on severe or critical COVID-19.5,14,39 A limitation of our study is the limited power to detect an association in the context of an HLA-wide screen, in particular due to the relatively small number of asymptomatic individuals. Using a sample size combining our two cohorts, we had an 80% power to detect an association with an allele with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.05 and an OR of 2.18, or an allele with a MAF of 0.2 and an OR of 1.72 (Figure S6). With a sample size 10X bigger, we would have an 80% power to detect an association leading to an OR of 1.29 and 1.18 for an allele with a MAF of 0.05 and 0.2, respectively (Figure S6). Nonetheless, our results indicate that a potential association between an HLA allele and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection would not have a strong effect. This result is also consistent with the absence of any strong association between HLA alleles and clinical outcomes during the acute phase for the other primary viral infections studied to date.40,41,42 By contrast, HLA alleles have been associated with multiple clinical or laboratory outcomes during chronic infections, including viral (e.g., HIV, HBV, HCV), mycobacterial (e.g., leprosy), and protozoan infections.42,43,44,45 HLA alleles are also known to be associated with responses to vaccinations,46,47 including against COVID-19.17,48 While pre-existing immunity due to prior infections with common cold coronaviruses might help preventing the development of clinical manifestations following SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that such pre-existing immunity would not strongly depend on HLA alleles.\n\nData and code availability\n\nData supporting the findings of this study are available within the manuscript and supplemental files.
