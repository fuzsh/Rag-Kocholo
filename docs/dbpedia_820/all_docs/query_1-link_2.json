        "text": "What 16 personality type is David Thwaites?\n\nDavid Thwaites, as an ESTJ, tends to be very traditional and take their commitments very seriously. They are reliable workers who are loyal to their employers and co-workers. They like to be in charge and may have difficulty delegating tasks or sharing authority. ESTJs are natural-born leaders, and they are not afraid to take charge. They are always looking for ways to improve efficiency and productivity, and they are not afraid to make tough decisions. Following a healthy order in their daily lives helps them maintain their balance and peace of mind. They have sound judgment and mental fortitude during a crisis. They are vigorous advocates of the law and set a positive example. Executives are interested in learning and promoting understanding of social issues, which helps them to make informed judgments. Because of their organized and good people abilities, they can organize events or initiatives in their communities. Having ESTJ friends is rather common, and you will respect their drive. The only disadvantage is that they may eventually expect people to reciprocate their gestures and be disappointed when their efforts go unnoticed.\n\nWhich Enneagram Type is David Thwaites?\n\nDavid Thwaites is an Enneagram Eight personality type with a Seven wing or 8w7. Eights with a seven wing type are more outgoing, energetic and fun than most other types. They are ambitious but can sometimes act recklessly with their commitment to being the best in anything they desire. They are most likely the ones to take risks even when it isn't worth taking those chances."
