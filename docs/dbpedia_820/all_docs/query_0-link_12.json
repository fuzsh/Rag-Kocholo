They sold foreign cars long, long before they were popular.\n\nLarry Roszkowiak <larry.roszkowiak@ucsf.edu>\n\nSan Francisco, CA - Monday, March 31, 2008 at 14:38:00 (EST)\n\nSpeaking of car dealerships, does anyone remember Motor Sports on North market Streets. They sold Volvos and other imports. Also, there was a car dealer on Gov. Printz and 30th St. that sold imports, I bought a Fiat from them, possibly the worst car I ever owned, with the exception of the 1976 Sunbird from Union Park Pontiac - no quality at all!\n\nBruce <private>\n\nSugar Land, TX USA - Monday, March 31, 2008 at 09:19:56 (EST) Does anyone remember Schwartz's Soda Shop, on Hillcrest Ave., just before it becomes Haines Ave.(in Bellefont)? Old man Schwartz, in the early 50's, made the best lemon phosphates I've ever tasted...Does anyone know what happened to the shop, or how long it remained under Mr.and Mrs. Schwartz's ownership??\n\nRuth \"Buz\" Peoples <whimsywoman@fastmail.fm>\n\nSequim, WA USA - Monday, March 31, 2008 at 00:02:35 (EST) My dad, an insurance salesman, used to take me to car dealerships in Wilmington in the late 1950s. He'd take me into the closing rooms and I'd watch two guys go into this histrionic, faux-emotional theater with me as both audience and shill. In October 1959 Dad bought a 1960 Chevrolet Impala, 2Dr, hardtop, white w/blue vinyl interior, blue tinted windows, back-up lights, dual headlights, 6 cyl, 3 speed std (on the column) It even looked like a spaceship then! $2100. Speaking of 3-speed on the column - Guys, remember how cool it was to rest your arm on the gearshift in 2nd gear?\n\nLarry Roszkowiak <larry.roszkowiak@ucsf.edu>\n\nSan Francisco, CA USA - Sunday, March 30, 2008 at 09:57:32 (EST) Last day M&M bakery was open was Super Bowl Sunday. No details! We will miss them a lot!!! Shirley Hudson Jester\n\nShirley Hudson Jester <ujest110@aol.com>\n\nNewark, DE USA - Saturday, March 29, 2008 at 08:34:56 (EST) One other thing comes to mind when thinking about the events surrounding the unveiling of the new model year cars. I remember standing on the corner of Lancaster Ave and Franklin Sts and watching the new cars being sent out to the individual dealers. A lot of the traffic came down Lancaster Ave at that time. All the new cars being delivered just prior to the big event were covered. There was a lot of secrecy involved which heightened the hoopla in October. I remember sneaking around to the lots as a kid trying to get the first glimpse of them before they were actually put on display. It really was a big event for car lovers. Can you imagine a kid today getting that excited about something as simple as that?\n\nWayne <twntydasys@aol.com>\n\new Castle, DE USA - Friday, March 28, 2008 at 20:46:09 (EST) My (own) first car was a 1953 Chevy that my father help me buy from F W Diver on Penna. Ave. after I had gotten out of the service. It cost $1900 brand new. Had a stick shift and that car would get me anywhere. Great mileage and could keep right on going thru snow with no trouble. A family friend who had a late model Pontiac convertible liked my car so much he was willing to trade with me but \"no deal\". That was the first of many Chevys that were to come in later years.\n\nBudo <budmar53at poolesite.com>\n\nWilm, DE USA - Friday, March 28, 2008 at 16:27:33 (EST) Colonial Chevrolet around 1965, I was the lot boy, where I used to drive the incoming cars to the back lot where they would be parked waiting for service. I once had to move a Brooks Armored Truck only to find out the reason it was at Colonial was it had no brakes!! (I stalled it out, luckily). A neighbor, Boots Campbell was the Colonial GM and I think he later got his own dealership on Kirkwood Hywy. He passed away a few years ago. Great Guy!.\n\nKevinD <donohue11@comcast.net>\n\nEllicott City, MD USA - Friday, March 28, 2008 at 15:40:35 (EST) In discussing some now gone car dealers around Wilmington, lets post memories about our first car. e.g. what kind, where you bought it, how much you paid and where you hung out with it.\n\nMike <mgo.trans@yahoo.com>\n\nTownsend, DE USA - Friday, March 28, 2008 at 14:37:52 (EST) Is anyone up-to-date on what the MBNA buildings on Chestnut Hill Road at 273 are going to be used for, and when? Everytime I look at the traffic live cam at that corner their parking lots are completely empty! They used to be completely full! Also - sadly, the GM plant at Boxwood Rd has many fewer cars than it used to.\n\nConnie <nospam>\n\nWilmington, DE USA - Friday, March 28, 2008 at 13:40:04 (EST) Does anybody know if the m&m bakery on Philadelphia Pike close down.

When I drove by here last time, the old clubhouse had been torn down and it looked for all intents and purposes like the property was in the process of being developed for commercial or residential purposes.\n\nKevinD <donohue11@comcast.net>\n\nEllicott City, MD USA - Friday, March 28, 2008 at 06:50:09 (EST) In regard to Nealis Motors (Dodge Dealership) In 1955, till ? It was located at 36th and Market, next to Wilm. Trust Bank, and next to the Bank was Rollins Motors, Ford Dealer. The Gen'l Manager of Nealis was Bill Vanderbraak, who went on to open Van's Chevrolet on duPont hwy.\n\nBill <wchamerica@yahoo.com>\n\nOcala, Fl USA - Friday, March 28, 2008 at 06:37:30 (EST) Don't know whats up with that Wayne but your not alone, I have had several people tell me the same thing. if it will make you feel any better yours wouldn't let me send to you either Ha Ha.

USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 22:36:05 (EST) Lehman's...I remember it well. Does anyone remember the Brown Derby on the Gov. Printz Blvd.? In the mid 60's it was open,as I rememember,one night a week to those under 21 in a club atmosphere without alcoholic drinks, and great for meeting and dancing.\n\nJerryTomczyk <sandybeach1@mchsi.com>\n\nDagsboro, De. USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 22:05:54 (EST) Sterling Auto was at Eleventh and Union Streets. They sold new Fords. Down the block on the west side of Union Street between Eight and Ninth in the mid fifties was a Mercury dealership. It was the first place I ever saw an Edsel up close. I remember us buying a 55 Mercury Montclair there. It was red with a white top and had twin spotlight/mirrors on it, stock from the factory. It was a year old and a used car when we got it, but it came from them. Rambo you're absolutely right about the searchlights lighting the sky around the city. It must have been like WW II all over again. Although I only saw that kind of stuff in the movies the searchlights gave everyone in town notification that something big was happening. Cadillac used to have a champagne preview the night before, for their regular customers. First (and last) time I had goose pate, or whatever that crap was that they had those people serving from the silver platters.That was much later, in the eighties, after the pomp and circumstance surrounding the grand showing of the new cars had ended. They were eventful and exciting times for young car buffs.\n\nWayne <twntydasys@aol.com>\n\nNew Castle, DE USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 20:28:57 (EST) Everyone is talking about Lynthwaite but does anyone remember Lehman's Custard on Governor Printz Blvd? I remember how good that was!\n\nTerri <LilSis923@comcast.net>\n\nHugo, MN USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 20:18:36 (EST) Don Wood, I believe that the car dealer was Sterling Auto Sales. I knew the Myers family very well from the early forties.\n\nRobert J. McKelvey <windsorme2@verizon.net>\n\nCape May, N.J. USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 19:56:23 (EST) I remember a Dodge dealer around Penna. Ave. and Union.. Around 1954 I went there for driving lessons. Don't believe the name was Nealis.\n\nBill Lyons <ALyons2336@aol.com>\n\nRehoboth Beach, DE USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 19:05:52 (EST) RE: Dodge dealer. Some how my first message got lost. Anyhow Rance Myers was Service Manager of a Dodge dealer on Union St.about one or two blocks south of Penna Ave. Pretty sure memory is working OK on this one. His son, Ed Myers, was my best friend. All this is about 1955.\n\nDon Wood <DCW545@yahoo.com>\n\nCharlotte, NC USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 18:50:19 (EST) Re: Dodge dealer/Union St. and Penna Ave. I beleive the name was Nealis Motors. It was on east side of Union about one or two blocks south of Penna Ave.\n\nDon Wood <DCW545@yahoo.com>\n\nCharlotte, NC USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 16:41:05 (EST) Phyllis, it is strange that we didn't know each other. As for the Carl's, Annabelle was the oldest, then Ruthie, Johnny and Margie. They did move to Delaire in the late 40's, I believe. I went to Ursuline Academy from 1949 and graduated in 1953.\n\nPat LeVan <levan1706@bellsouth.net>\n\nPort St. Lucie, FL USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 13:38:34 (EST) Wayne, I posted you a little while ago in Re; to DiPrisco but it didn't go through for some reason. Anyway you were right He was before my time on the Department(1959-1980)however my Wife new the Family. She lived around the corner from them on Lancaster Ave.\n\nRay Jubb <golfopera@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, De. USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 13:03:09 (EST) ah yes, rocket 88, I saw them play a few time over at the old \"booth house\" bar in old new castle - its a jewelry store now i think - but in the 70's- 80's it was a pretty nice place to go - pretty little barmaid too as I remember - barbara i think her name was, the ownwers daughter i believe.\n\noldeschool55 <oldeschool55@yahoo.com>\n\nwilmington, de USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 11:10:19 (EST) To Jim Rambo: I also remember when the new cars used to come out every year. It was a ritual that I would visit as many showrooms that I could. Some of the dealers would give us models of the cars. Like my old baseball cards, I wish I still had them.\n\nSwifty <williamwswift@aol.com>\n\nMiddletown, DE USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 10:38:10 (EST) Your right Wayne, that was before my time on the Department. However, I do remember the name and my Wife remembers the Family very well. She lived in the 1300 block of Lancaster Ave. just around the corner from that Family. My time on the Department was 1959-1980.\n\nRay Jubb <golfopera@aol.com>\n\nWilmington De., De. USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 10:23:05 (EST) In the Fall, at Third and Connell, we would see spotlights in the air coming from the Pennsylvania Avenue area. That was our signal that the new cars were on display in the dealerships. Knowing that pretzels, sodas or milkshakes were on the dealers' agenda, we would hop on our bikes and ride out to the showrooms. They always let us walk through and stuff ourselves...nice guys. I most remember the 1955 Fords and the big old Oldsmobiles. Never liked the big fins on the back of other makes.\n\njim rambo <rammymex@yahoo.com>\n\najijic, jalisco Mexico - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 09:56:24 (EST) Old school, Back in my Mechtron days, early 70's, Nick was a heavy set Polish guy, probably in his 40's who never tied his work boots, but never tripped over the laces. He lived in New Castle. I believe he had previously worked for the Rail Road. Tom - Dr. Harmonica is around 56-58 years old. He lived in Brandywine Hundred, went to BHS and got some help with his band from George Thorogood. His first name is Mark. I think his band is Rocket 88.\n\nBruce <private>\n\nSugar Land, TX USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 09:27:47 (EST) Ray Jubb, it may have been a little before your time on the force, but I seem to remember a police officer by the name of De Prisco who lived on Franklin Street had a heart attack and dropped dead while being waited on in Goldie's around 1956. His wife later opened a sub shop on the corner of Lancaster Ave. and Franklin Street. It was there a while, and eventually she moved out to Elsmere, down from Doctor Forman, right before the little bridge on Du Pont Road.\n\nWayne <twntydasys@aol.com>\n\nNew Castle, DE USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 07:20:58 (EST) In the interest of accuracy, because as I have stated many times before, people will look at this years from now and consider it historical fact, there was no Dodge dealership at Pennsylvania Ave and Union or near there in the late fifties. Starting at Pennsylvania Ave and Du Pont you had the Cadillac dealership Delaware Motor Sales. In the next block was Union Park Pontiac. A little further down on the same side past Scott Street was Divers used car lot, and across from that Sterling Auto had the Ford used car lot. Their new car showroom was around the corner at Eleventh and Union. On the corner of Pennsylvania Ave and Union was another used car lot. A little further out and just before the Park Drive was Liberty Buick on the one side with Diver's Chevrolet on the other. Although one may have purchased a used Dodge from any of the used car lots along that stretch of Pennsylvania Ave, there was no actual Dodge dealership located there during that time. As far as NEW Car Dealerships were concerned General Motors dominated Pennsylvania Ave. at that time. Perhaps it had something to do with their catering to the Greenville crowd.\n\nWayne <twntydasys@aol.com>\n\nNew Castle, DE USA - Thursday, March 27, 2008 at 07:10:12 (EST) Phyllis B.:: Lynthwaite's Ice Cream See Map had TWO locations.__The first location was on the west side of Concord Pike.__The west side is the side that the Chuck Wagon is on - if you know where that is.__The SECOND location was on the east side of Concord Pike - the side where the Concord Mall is.__The second location would have been between Double Tree and the Concord Pike Village.__I would guess that the two locations were across from each other and maybe 200 yards apart.__The Chuck Wagon side was where the farm was.__The exact location is NOT recognizable - it is not there.__It may be the mound of dirt between the two places mentioned.__If you are in the area of Mitchell's in Fairfax, every year they put old photos in their windows.__One shows the second and last location of Lynthwaite's.__The building is alone - nothing else is near it.__There are no survey markers to point it out - you just have to visualize it...\n\nWebmaster <web-master@oldwilmington.net>\n\nWilmington/Perryville, DE/MD USA - Wednesday, March 26, 2008 at 22:03:24 (EST) Pat LeVan - Can't say that I remember you at all. Don't recognize your maiden name either. Strange, since we are close in age and I did visit the Walsmleys often. My maiden name was Bartlett. When you speak of the Carl's on Ashton St., were they Ruth, Johnny and two more? The Carl family I remember moved to Delaire. I don't recognize the other names you mentioned. Did you graduate from P.

She used to teach us how to weave \"gimp\" to make bracelets, etc. I would go there and spend the entire day during the summer.... ride the swings and pitch horseshoes. She was a very nice lady..... I think she taught at Mary C.I. during the school year. She was kind of an \"arts and crafts\" person as well as a supervisor of us kids in the park during the day.

I didn't think he would appreciate me using his real name, he does go by Dr. Harmonica. I do remember him playing the harmomnica in the tunnel that was the inspection lane. There were a lot of Drs. in the DMV area. I remember a guy called Dr. Bulb who used to sit outside the inspection area and replace burned out lights on cars that flunked inspection. I think they eventually made him move his truck out of the area. He had a good idea.\n\nBruce <private>\n\nSugar land, TX USA - Tuesday, March 25, 2008 at 11:09:23 (EST) Old school - That's the same Fuzzy.

It appeared somewhere in the early fifties or thereabouts.\n\nWayne <twntydasys@aol.com>\n\nNew Castle, DE USA - Tuesday, March 25, 2008 at 10:30:11 (EST) Bruce, I should have known Dr. Harmonica - had a terrible time getting any of my \"Gravel Gerties\" to pass that inspection; seems like all my cars needed ball joints or some other such calamity that may have cost more than the car was worth.\n\nButch Schilling <fschillling@bellsouth.net>\n\nAiken, SC USA - Tuesday, March 25, 2008 at 09:38:38 (EST) The \"riding academy\"/stable that rented horses by the hour that I remember patronizing back in 1949 or 1950, whether it was Rick's Riding Academy or not, was the one someone just recently identified as being on Claymont Street, east of Northeast Boulevard. It may not have been as close to the Brown Boy's Club as I remember, but it was in the same general neighborhood down near the flats of the banks of the Delaware River, and not far from the Pennsy Right of Way. I remember that the typical route of the 'rides' we took went up to a high field on the north side and across the way from Wilmington Ball Park. The big map that the Webmaster provides here helped also me to figure that out.\n\nBob Wilson Jr <wilso127@yahoo.com>\n\nBeaufort, SC USA - Tuesday, March 25, 2008 at 08:43:10 (EST) Some one mentioned a stable being just off the Gov. Printz Blvd. If my memory serves me corectly, there used to be a stable where the First State Bowling Lanes are today, that was in the early 40's, can't remember the name of the place, but it was a very odd name.\n\nBill <wchamerica@yahoo.com>\n\nOcala, Fl USA - Tuesday, March 25, 2008 at 07:07:45 (EST) Here's a better link to the picture of the old St. Cornelius Mission Church on Rt. 202 next to Ricks on 202.

We were a \"Mission Church\" of Saint Thomas the Apostle\". Internet link: http://www.catholicparishes.net/phl/StCorneliusChaddsFord/default.asp?.ProID=714595 The picture definitely looks like the tiny church that was adjacent to Rick's on 202. I could find nothing on Google on Spring Lakes Golf course but I’m sure that is the correct name. The miniature golf course and driving range was “Spring Valley” Many thanks to Donn, whom I think is a member of the great BHS Class of 1967!! Regarding the trampoline center on Kirkwood Highway, I was not familiar with that one but definitely was familiar to the trampoline center behind the old El Capitan in Fairfax which operated in the early 60’s.\n\nKevinD <donohue11@comcast.net>\n\nEllicott City, MD USA - Monday, March 24, 2008 at 17:25:38 (EST) To try to fill in what I think I know, The Church next to Rick!s Academy, might have been ST. Cornelius Church. The par three course was Spring Lakes. The course on the left,was always changing hands. But I applied to drive the Jeep, one summer, to collect balls on the driving range . Name escapes me. The restaurant was The Surrey. The trampoline park was where Taco Bell, and Wendy!s on Farrand drive is now. across from Best Buy. [ formally The Red Barn ] They, Red Barn Restaurant had a bar and band downstairs on the weekend.

They had inground rectangular trampolines where you would pay for time to jump on the trampolines. The place didn't last very long, I suspect too many injuries = too much insurance issues.\n\nerik <nospam>>\n\nNewark, DE USA - Monday, March 24, 2008 at 13:50:23 (EST) Short story about the old DMV at 8th & Grant Ave.: Someone in the Police Dept. got the great idea one day to set up shop in the DMV behind the counters and out of sight. As the people came in to renew their drivers licenses or for any thing where they had to produce identification there names would be run for outstanding warrants. You should have seen how many trips we had to make with that old Paddy Wagon to the lock-up. Don't know if they still do it or not but it sure cleared up a lot of old warrants and other outstanding papers.\n\nRay Jubb <golfopera@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, De.

Rick’s Riding Academy was located on Rt. 202 just over the PA state line. I believe there was a little, one story old stone church adjacent to Rick's on the same side. My father used to take me up there in the mid-50's after constant reminders, I think you got three turns around the ring for 50 cents. Another similarly located and familiar landmark on Rt 202 North was the par 3 \"Pitch and Putt\" golf course, (Silver Lakes?) it was owned by the Cudone family who also owned the independent movie theater on Gov. Printz. (Edgemore?). I noticed the last time in DE, the Par 3 course was being developed and the wooden \"clubhouse\" structure was torn down. Also, what was the name of the miniature golf course on 202 on the south bound side?, it had a driving range and when you got a hole-in-one on the last hole of the miniature golf course, the buzzer rang loudly and you got a free game! Also, would love to see a picture of Linthwaite's Ice Cream if one exists. Many thanks for the great memories on this website.\n\nKevinD <donohue11@comcast.net>\n\nEllicott City, MD USA - Monday, March 24, 2008 at 12:23:17 (EST) ROBERT MCKELVEY: I remember the millstone at the bottom of Adams and Park Dr. Is it stii there? On the corner opposite the cemetery was a small park with kids swings etc.( in the 50's and 60's). An old neighbor from Klair Estates, Ann Stansell,nee Bradley,(think she grew up near 3rd and Madison),told me that there was once a small pool at this location. In the same general area, if you went past the swinging bridge towards the mills, there were ,on the right, hills of sand and dirt that we used to ride our bikes down.\n\nJerry Tomczyk <sandybeach1@mchsi.com>\n\nDagsboro, De.

After a long bus ride I was awakened by the city lights and then treated to a view of Market Street in all it's Christmas glory with lights and decor on every pole and building. Santas on several corners with their little sheds to kleep them warn. It's not the same anymore. Then finally my Mom or Dad opening the front door with the smell of cookies and coziness of my home dressed for the holiday.\n\nAl Minne <alminne@verizon.net>\n\nTemecula , CA USA - Monday, March 24, 2008 at 11:14:18 (EST) Connie: My storm story pales in comparision to Bill F.’s but here it is: (Jerry T.: Your email address finally clicked for me. Thanks for your interest.) I remember the 58 storm but what year was the second storm you spoke of. As a sixth grader at Lore I received a scholarship to the Delaware Art Center and had to travel by myself from school to the Center by Trolley and Bus. On a late spring day in 1953 (I believe) a heavy snow storm surprised us. I boarded the trolley and traveled to the transfer point and found no bus waiting. I was not dressed for the weather and knew nothing about this section of town. I knew the trolley barn was 7-8 blocks back so I walked there. The only Del Coach employee I found told me the Buses were not running then brushed me off and sent me out into an unknown neighborhood with no idea of where I was. I had a good sense of direction so I started walking toward home in Lancaster Village which was probably about 6 miles away. When I got to Pennsylvania Avenue I found the car dealership where my dad had purchased a car. Went and found our salesman. I told him my problem. He was unable to contact my parents but checked and found that the busses were now running but very slow. My transfer was not good from there so he gave 7 cents for bus fare and pointed me to a nearby bus stop. It was a long wait but I finally got home. Months later my dad and I passed the dealership and I told him I needed to repay the salesman. We went in found the guy and I handed him 7 cents. He was very surprised and happy. He reached into his pocket and handed me a quarter telling to “Remember, honesty always pays.” I did remember and applied his message to my life. He was correct! It paid well. I wish I could share his name and/or the Dealership’s name with you but I cannot remember. It was a Dodge dealership on Pennslyvania Ave near the RR bridge.\n\nAl Minne <alminne@verizon.net>\n\nTemecula , CA USA - Monday, March 24, 2008 at 11:14:01 (EST) bruce, I remember Fuzzy, he had a great big long mustache!!!! right???? anybody else here from the old mechtron days????\n\noldeschool55 <oldeschool55@yahoo.com>\n\nwilmington, de USA - Monday, March 24, 2008 at 11:08:29 (EST) Well, I lived right in back of the Brandywine/Ellis drive-in theater in Minquadale. I think Orv is correct in the progression of the names. It was Brandywine first. Kiddie Town was right next to it. To the west of those two attractions was a farm. Hessler of Hessler Sign Company owned all of that land at one time. One of my classmates family had a pony ride concession in the little amusement park. On Friday Nights a small local band Played Music from the Rooftops of Kiddie Town. Wilmington Speedway indeed had stock car races every Sunday night. You could hear the roar of the engines and smell the exhaust nearly all night. As kids we were not allowed down there as there was school the next day but a good many of us climbed the fences and the trees to watch the races.\n\nRay Zelano <RZelano@aol.com>\n\nNew Castle, De USA - Monday, March 24, 2008 at 10:18:28 (EST) The DMV on Bancroft was always a circus at the end of the month with people trying to get their cars inspected at the last minute. It seemed to be one of those government agencies that were staffed with people who got jobs through knowing someone. I had a friend (Known in music circles back in the day as Dr. Harmonica) who worked in the inspection line for awhile and he would pass anyone who he know no matter the condition of the car. I remember taking a friends Corvette through the line - the headlights didn't work, the brakes barely stopped the car and various other things were wrong with the car, but it passed!\n\nBruce <private>\n\nSugar Land, TX USA - Monday, March 24, 2008 at 08:06:22 (EST) I think the Ellis Drive-in was originally called the Brandywine Drive-in; also I think after the drive-in shutdown, then it became the Wilmington Speedway... not sure about this one though.....

USA - Saturday, March 22, 2008 at 21:30:23 (EST) The blizzard of '66 Christmas Eve caper: I was working as a Crew Scheduler for American Airlines in Los Angeles in 1966. The day before Christmas Eve, I had to assign a fairly senior Captain from \"off\" time to fly a 3-day trip beginning the morning of Christmas Eve. This naturally didn't sit too well with him, but he couldn't argue much; the airplanes must fly! I managed to finagle myself into having 3 days off over Christmas, starting Dec. 24th, and decided to surprise my parents and other family members who lived in Wilmington by showing up on Christmas Eve. So, I got my non-revenue space-available pass to fly to Philadelphia Christmas Eve morning. Little did the Captain of American flight 60 that morning know, but the rascal who caused him to have to fly this trip was sitting about 20 or so feet behind him on the way to Philly! I also discovered that two stewardesses were also \"non-reving\" on this flight, and that they too were heading for Wilmington. They had a whole lot of Christmas presents with them, and looked like a couple of gypsies with all their belongings on their backs! We banded together as pilgrims heading home for Christmas. The flight was uneventful until we were close to Pittsburgh, when Capt. Bush got on the P.A. system and announced that they were having a blizzard in Philadelphia, and there were many thunderstorms in the area as well. We made one pass at Philly and then the airport closed up tighter than a drum. The snow was falling so fast the plows couldn't keep it off the runways! Soooo, we had to divert to JFK Airport in New York. This was bad news for the three freeloaders on the way to Delaware. We were supposed to arrive in Philly at about 4:45pm, but after all the hassle of overflying and the accompanying air traffic control delays, we got to JFK at about 8:00pm. American Airlines provided a bus to get the passengers to Philly, but since we were \"non-revenue, space available\" passengers, we weren't really entitled to any ground transportation. Fortunately, the bus wasn't full, so one of the flight crew yelled, \"Come on, you guys, you're gonna miss the bus!\" We gathered up all the Christmas presents the girls were carrying, and jumped on board the bus before anybody had a chance to change their mind... and I tried my best to avoid the Captain's eyes! I think I pulled it off; he never mentioned a thing about it afterwards. The bus trip to Philly was slow and LONG! I've never seen so much snow in my life. We finally pulled into Philadelphia International at about 11:30pm. Nearly 3 hours to make a trip that should have been only about 90 minutes... and there was practically no traffic. When we got to the airport terminal, everything was totally shut down; it looked like a ghost town. We ran across a cab driver, and quickly asked if he would take us to Wilmington. He looked at us as if we were crazy, but when we offered him a LOT of money, he reluctantly agreed to try it. We were quite relieved, since everything else was at a standstill. Gathering up all the presents and suitcases once again, we piled into his cab, which reminded me a lot of the \"Tijuana Taxi\", and we headed for the airport exit. We almost got there, when all of a sudden a large cloud of steam surrounded the cab. His radiator had blown! Oh, joy- here we were, stuck in a blizzard with a wounded taxicab. Fortunately, we were quite close to the Philadelphia Airport Motel, so we decided to trek though the deep snow over to it. We gathered up the presents and got there, and foolishly asked if there were any rooms available. The desk clerk gave us a look that was about 10 times the one the cab driver had shown us. He said that the airport had been closed for quite some time, and that the rooms went quickly, with all the stranded passengers to take care of. I said to the girls that we'd better grab a sofa or two and get some sleep, because nothing was going to happen to get us home. As we were picking out sofas, I noticed a guy coming down the stairs from the second floor. It turned out to be a fellow I knew from an American Airlines class I took some years prior, when I worked for American at New Castle County Airport and had to go to Philly for training classes. He had become a Passenger Service Manager at Philly. I explained our situation to him, and he said, \"You might be the luckiest three people in Philly right now; I have a double room and a single that we were holding. It looks like the worst is over, so I'm going to let you have them... no charge.\" I quickly turned to the girls and asked which one wanted the single room... but as luck would have it, neither of them did, so I had to take it. Bummer. So, once again we gathered up the presents, etc. and made our way to the rooms. In the morning, one of the girls called her father to come rescue us. He drove through all that snow and got to the airport by about 10am. Gathering up the presents, we piled into his car and headed down route 291 (I-95 wasn't there back then!) The girls were both going south and west of downtown, so they dropped me off at the Edgemoor Theater, since my folks only lived about 3 blocks up from it. Keep in mind that I was going to surprise my family, so couldn't let them know where I was the day before and that morning. I said goodbye to all the presents, the girls, and the nice dad that rescued us (not necessarily in that order), and set out to walk the three blocks home. I quickly found that carrying a fairly heavy suitcase was not really possible in almost waist-deep snow, so decided to blow my cover and call home. I went into the Edgemoor Drug Store on the corner and called. My mom answered the phone, so I said, \"Merry Christmas!\" She said that the phone connection must be a very good one; you sound like you're only around the corner.\" I of course replied, \"Well, to tell you the truth... I AM!\" I'm at the Edgemoor Drug Store... can you fire up that snow-loving Corvair and come dig me out? I have quite a story to tell you...\" About 3 minutes later, she showed up, and I almost started looking around for the presents to load into the car. We got home and although my surprise wasn't total (I wanted to ring the doorbell and let them answer it), it was a pretty good one in spite of all the difficulties. We had a great Christmas afternnon and evening, even though it was shorter than I had planned. I had to leave the next day and get back to work. Fortunately, no more problems were encountered.\n\nBill Fisher <whfisheratearthlink.net>\n\nWestminster, CA USA - Saturday, March 22, 2008 at 21:26:56 (EST) MARTY: Dino Taviano may still be with Motor Vehicle.

USA - Saturday, March 22, 2008 at 20:35:06 (EST) Canby Woods: that's what we called it back in the early to mid '50s, before the ball parks and the developments. Now its Canby park. There was a path from the small stone bridge in the area at the beginning of Oak St. that wound through the woods and came out to Maryland Ave. About halfway down the path , in a clearing, was a stone horse trough fed by a pipe tied in to a natural spring. I remember people riding horses on this path and stopping for water. When I walked through with my son in the late 70's , early 80's , the trough and pipe were gone but the water was still trickling out. Canby again: someone on a previous post mentioned the remnants of a stone building with nothing but the chimney standing and the stones laying around the base. This was in the woods, behind one of the ball diamonds in the area of the top of Oak St. Does anyone know the history of that house? Canby again(Indian rocks): near the Maryland Ave. section of the woods , in the stream, were actually two carvings in two separate rocks of Indian faces. One maybe both had an Indian head dress. I remember them from the early 50's and my brothers from the early 40's. Does anyone know their history?\n\nJerry Tomczyk <sandybeach1@mchsi.com>\n\nDagsboro, De.

I have learned that Paul and Fred Filaipone passed a few years back and was wondering about the rest of the gang, Blackie DiBattista, Jack Maher, Dino Tavani, Paul Jarrell, Tom Snell. They were really a close knit group that were mainly WPD and Wilmington firefighter retirees. Where did they move the DMV?\n\nMarty <bythesea@google.com>\n\nDeerfield, Fl USA - Saturday, March 22, 2008 at 20:04:01 (EST) I got stuck on Robert Kirkwood Highway and Possum Park Rd., on the way home from Louviers.

I left Jackson and Elm Sts. to go pick up a girlfriend from Zappatterini's(sp.)bakery between 4th and 5th on Lincoln.Coming back down 4th to Jackson was treacherous. I got stuck in front of St. Paul's on Jackson. Some kind nuns came out and gave me cardboard to put under the tires. For some reason instead of going straight down Jackson to Elm, I took a detour to Maryland Ave. and started up Linden. I got stuck again, halfway between Maryland Ave. and Jackson and left it there in the middle of the street until the next day, Christmas, when I, my Dad, brother and others got it out. My Dad said, I told you so. It was his '66 Pontiac Le Mans that I borrowed.\n\nJerry Tomczyk <sandybeach1@mchsi.com>\n\nDagsgoro, De.

WM you are right about the buildings being cold. A few years after Mechtron I worked At Wilm. Finishing Co. at the other end of the mill and it was freezing. The heat would come on twice a day and it was for the benefit of the machines, not workers. Old school the only supervisors on the rail cars were a guy named Fuzzy and a big Polish fellow who was the supervisor of the truck group that I worked for. Hard cold/hot work but somehow we had fun. I also remember a old railroad guy named Charlie - another nice guy. At Wilmington finishing Co. I knew the head of security, Deb Fluharty, who was originally from 40 acres. Anyone remember him?

Being a high point, I think the site allowed gravity feed of the water out and down to customers. The water was pumped up from the Brandywine. In 1880, a court house was built on the filled ground. That lasted until about 1920, when construction was begun on the Square. The Caesar Rodney statue was completed and dedicated in 1923. It was sculpted and cast by James Kelley of New York city. He was famous for works that immortalized many of the heroes and scenes of the Civil War. On Park Drive, another of his works was moved from the intersection at Van Buren street, just south of the bridge over the Brandwine to a site farther west. I think it depicts Pres. McKinley, but I'd have to check. When the library was built, the lot was occupied by the First Presbyterian church and cemetery. On the corner at 10th was what looked like a two story office building with the church facing on Market just south and adjacent to the two story structure. The cemetery was on the south side of the church and extended to King street. The church was moved to south Park Drive at West. The residents of the cemetery were relocated, some with the church, I believe, and others to Wilmington and Brandywine. Perhaps other cemeteries were involved. Once the new library was built, the old building at 8th and Market, built in 1861, was sold to John Govatos and eventually became a Kresge's five and dime. That site was once the home of John Dickinson, who once lived there in a house that faced the Christina. There are several books around that have great pictures. Carol Hoffecker's book, 'So Laudable An Undertaking' is worth a read. It describes what it took to get the new library built and describes some of the development in and around the Square.\n\nBill <mcgonigal9@verizon.net>\n\nTownsend, DE USA - Thursday, March 20, 2008 at 20:30:28 (EST) ORV, Under Class links, same column as Nostaglia Forum, click on it and follow to WHS Class of 1960 Entire yearbook is there.

All took shape in the early decades of the 20th Century soon after the DuPont Company built the DuPont Building for its 500 person staff. On land donated by Pierre S. DuPont, New York architect Edward Lippincott Tilton (1861-1933), formerly of McKim, Mead and White and responsible for 60 library buildings, designed this elegant -- and garlanded -Beaux Arts' structure (below) for the Wilmington Institute Free Library that was finished by 1922.Behind the library looms the massive Delaware Trust Building.

I recall my brother, Al, working at the Pigments plant in Newport during his Univ.of Dela. years '53-'57.He also delivered mail,neighborhoods unknown, during the same time period. According to my maternal grandmother, Martha Szatkowski, born in Wilmington, 1890, she had an interesing story about Rodney Square and the Wilmington Library.She told me that at one time, probably before her time,that one site was once a reservoir and one was an old cemetery. Does anyone have any information to confirm this? I also read somewhere that on one of the corners of the Dupont Hotel, General Lafayette visited/courted the house of an attractive lady. So much for Newport in the 1950's to the Rodney Square area in the Revolutionary War days.*** Almost forgot that my uncle Henry, 'Hank', Szatkowski,flew planes and experimental aircraft at the old DuPont airfield on Lancaster Pike and 141, in the 1950's. He also worked at the DuPont Experimental station,as a Lab Technician during the '50's.\n\nJerry Tomczyk <sandybeach1@mchsi.com>\n\nDagsboro, De.

Frank said he would only do so as a partner and as head of the company! Try the first hit \"WWW.chemheritage.org/exhibits/pittcon/martinez.html\" then check the others.

Obviously Dupont's history is as old as our country and it is a major reason the Wilmington history even exists! Without DuPont's powder we might still be a British Colony. Now you've stirred up my engineering mememories! Does any remember Frank Martinez? I believe he was at the Experimental Station in the late 50s. He developed a Gas Chromatograph for Dupont but persuaded them to let him contract to manufacture and supply their needs. Shortly after he founded F&M Scientific Corporation which still later (cirica 1965-66) he sold F&M to Hewlet Packard and it became their Avondale Division. My first \"real\" employment after the Navy was at F&M.\n\nAl Minne <alminne@verizon.net>\n\nTemecula , CA USA - Wednesday, March 19, 2008 at 19:14:34 (EST) Bruce, you are 100% correct and I am 100% wrong. It was NOT Mechtron, it was Micron - they were involved with microscopes and used the \"mu\" as part of their logo. Now, Mechtron: I made many trips there Click here for photo. They made a chemical mixer for us called a Blender - it was for the 24L Film Processors we sold to publishers - remember, I was with the Image Systems of the Photo Products Department. Everything you said about Mechtron was right, except that where they made our Blenders, it was in the section that overhung the Brandywine. You could see the water through the cracks in the wooden floor. And it was cold there in the winter. I remember Jim - he was tough to work with. I can almost think of the foremans name and if I e-mailed Herman, the fellow I worked with, I'd bet he would remember - I just might do that. Did you go to The Cave much for lunch? We also went to the Del Rose on Delaware Avenue. Mechtron's other location was up the street from Pusey & Jones - it was cold in there also. Gee, more memmories - this is great. Thanks for mentioning it, but now do you remember Micron at the airport?\n\nWebmaster <web-master@oldwilmington.net>\n\nWilmington/Perryville, DE/MD USA - Wednesday, March 19, 2008 at 18:25:11 (EST) Web Master, I worked at Mechtron for a few years, but when I started with them they were located in the old Bancroft Mills. Since they were started by a group of All American employees I guess that's why they were at the old Airport facility. There was a VP, Jim Olivere, who was pretty tough to work for, but I think a pretty good guy. Mechtron got into repairing dining railroad cars for Amatrak, which is where I worked after a short time in the sheet metal shop. They then moved the railroad operations to a large building off of fourth st., close to the Christiana River. It was a pretty rough area, I'm sure it's a war zone now from some of the posts about Wilmington.\n\nBruce <private>\n\nSugar Land, TX USA - Wednesday, March 19, 2008 at 15:41:36 (EST) Bruce:: Crolyn tape was to be DuPont's entry into the business of audio and video cassette tape for the consumer. From what I later found out, the business did not last long because the tape surface was too rough for the players' heads and acted like sandpaper on them. Also, DuPont could not compete with the Asian-made tape. Maybe things changed once they moved the operation to Europe. Orv can tell us something about that, maybe. Bruce, maybe our paths crossed each other at that time, I recall having a lot of Olsten's workers - I was doing most of the electrical and electronic work at the airport and Herman was involved in the mechanical. I remember how the cassette loading machines would fail and the two of us would have to repair them. He and I were the only technicians there for the first two years. We even had the assignment of rotating every other week opening up the main gate on 141 at 6:00AM - we were given the #100 master keys. Poor Herman also had to take care of the old boilers to heat the place - it was a mess but it was also a good experience. A year before we moved to Glasgow, we were both transferred to the QA Group, given an expense account and new a company car every two years. I then traveled for the next 18 years. DuPont is not the same company today as when I worked for them - I can truly say I loved my job then, but today - I don't know.\n\nWebmaster <web-master@oldwilmington.net>\n\nWilmington/Perryville, DE/MD USA - Wednesday, March 19, 2008 at 12:52:01 (EST) Budo, I do not know Carl...as for class reunions, we have all been to our class reunions, whenever they were held.

I never worked there - I would only go there once a month to take inventory of the material they stored for my operation in the building on Water Street_______Orv: I should know you. E-mail me so we can discuss our DuPont days. I remember Chiaverini and O'Neil. (Mike stayed with us up to the Eagle Run Site). While at the Newport Dev. Lab when we were looking for a site to relocate, management sent me and a fellow named Herman Schechinger to the airport and look around. All-American had already moved to the Dravo buildings. There was the EDL's Model Shop in the lower level of the front hanger and a private company (Mechtron Industries) in the small building near the woods. All of the other buildings were empty. We reported to management that we should move in. I remember that the electrical service was such a mish-mash it was hard to locate all of the panels and figure out what type power went where. My first assignment was to create electrical drawings of the entire site - from where the 3-phase power entered the site to every sub-panel. Once we moved in and got organized, there was one long building where the tape slitting operation was. All of us were allowed to have as many of the rejected cassettes we wanted - they were still useable, just not good enough to sell (I still have some of those white cassettes). Do you remember any of the operators there - especially the redhead? And did you know Corky Correll? I remember lightning hit the steel transformer tower one day and shorted out the whole site. The main conduit went under the two-story building by Mechtron and shorted it out. We had to get Galloway Bros. Electrical to run a new line from the tower to the oil-filled main switch building. We later had Delmarva relocate the transformers and removed the tower. During lunch most of the guys would just walk all around the fields - we found the runway lights that were still in place and we discovered the little cemetary that was overgrown so much you vould not tell it was there. You can now see it along Lancaster Pike. I wish I took photos back then (1971 - 1974). We outgrew the airport and moved to Glasgow. We soon outgrew that building and thought we would have another building built for us on DuPont's 1300 acre Glasgow Site. But, Ronson had their building up for sale (Eagle Run), so we moved there. In 1985, we had plans to add two stories on top of the Eagle Run building (I have the artists view of it), but in 1988 all DuPonter remember what happened: Louviers closed and down-sizing began. I took advantage of the Enhanced Pension Policy they offered and retired in 1991. I know I spent a lot of everyones time here, but for DuPonters - it is some history of a few sites...\n\nWebmaster <web-master@oldwilmington.net>\n\nWilmington/Perryville, DE/MD USA - Wednesday, March 19, 2008 at 12:12:18 (EST) Shirley I believe I remember your sister from the class of 49 at PS.

I also worked temporarily out of the old Dupont Airport with the magnetic tape slitting and cassette loading operation. The person in charge of that operation then was Mauro Chiaverini and he reported to Mike (\"Iron Mike\") O'Neil. I also maintained an office there prior to going to the old Soviet Union as part of a technology sale of Chromium Dioxide manufacturing. We set up a plant in the Soviet Union (Shotska) and trained their people on equipment operation, wrote S.O.P.'s and all that was necessary for Chromium Dioxide manufacturing (for a price).

I remember Jeanne Butler... but she probably doesn't remember me. I worked in the Chromium Dioxide Area (Bldg A20 and the new bldg in the back of the Plant, A300). I remember Art Jennings.... was a big joker and well-liked. When I started back in '67, Doc Rodowskas was the Plant Manager and then after him came a number of different ones. The one that most folks disliked was a guy Bill McClure. He was a no-nonsense sort of guy who was more interested in the \"bottom line\" than in his employees. (unlike the past) I was also part of a \"support team\" that \"fought\" against the United Steelworkers union attempt to organize the Plant. Worked for Charlie Wood. Some members of that \"team\" were John Neid, Ben Belote, Dan Tierney, Gene Filliben (who was the former president of the Local Union #9. In about 1984 the Chromium Dioxide area in the back of the Newport site was separated from the rest of the Plant (which was sold to Ciba-Geigy). It was called \"Holly Run\". I could go on and on but I think Jeanne will remember some of the things I mentioned.\n\nOrv <obursler@comcast.net>\n\nLincoln, DE USA - Tuesday, March 18, 2008 at 19:01:41 (EST) Al Minne.... Sounds like (from the directions you gave me) that your wife was at the \"Willow Bank\" site. The original Krebs Plant was on the opposite side of Newport Gap Pike. When going south on that road and under the RR bridge turn RIGHT and go into the gate. This was called Newport Pigments Plant when I was there (from 1967 to 1996). We did, however, have a \"pilot\" program for Corian as well as Nylon Shutters. You're correct saying that Corian went to the Buffalo Plant up in N.Y. I noted in todays News Journal that the AREA Supervisor in the old Shutters area passed away.... Harry Reid. Most folks didn't know that there was a Dupont location at the site where your wife worked.\n\nOrv <obursler@comcast.net>\n\nLincoln, DE USA - Tuesday, March 18, 2008 at 18:52:34 (EST) Budo, my sister, Joan Hudson, was in your class of 1948. We kind of went right down the line, Joan in '48, Jack in '50, me in '51 and Bob in '52. The two younger guys, Kenny and Richard, went to Mt Pleasant - later!

That school was originally built to be a high school and should stay a high school. I will always have great memories of PS and great memories of the rivialries against old WIlm. High. Both great schools. My class was 48 however I moved on out of state so I wasn't able to stay for graduation there but 48 will still be \"my class\". Also both my sisters had graduated there earlier.

Whoever was behind the park ought to be thanked. Instead of putting up another big box store or strip center someone thought of a place for kids to play and enjoy the out doors. I was glad to hear they left a tower from the old workhouse as a memory from the past.\n\nBruce <private>\n\nSugar Land, TX USA - Tuesday, March 18, 2008 at 12:38:08 (EST) for ROSE: before you move back, you may want to visit, wilm is a different place!\n\nTom Brejwa <brejwa@mchsi.com>\n\nOcean View, De USA - Monday, March 17, 2008 at 18:20:00 (EST) For all you Ninth Warders and PS duPont Alumnus...help me understand why the city wants to build a new high school when they have our magnificent PS duPont just sitting there in all it's glory, with a 44 million dollar renovation...I am totally lost as to where they are coming from. We now know that the decision in 1978 to close down all the high schools and Jr. High Schools was the demise of the Wilmington that I loved and grew up in. The city that had it's own community schools that I walked to everyday, Shortlidge, Warner,and PS and our families walked to before us. Putting our kids on a two hour bus ride to someone else's community was not the answer. The answer is to bring PS back as a high school, bring back Warner as a Jr. High, and hey bring back Howard as a high school. Bring back the community and let the kids of our future carry on the tradition as we did...They brought back Conrad, let's not stop there...I kniow I have been away for a long time, and maybe there is a lot I am not aware of but when I move back in July and have my feet back on my home town's turf I intend to make some noise. We have several PS alumnus who are city officials...so I will start there...tell me your thoughts...\n\nRose(Watson)Culver <reculver71@aol.com>\n\nLayton, UT USA - Monday, March 17, 2008 at 18:00:34 (EST) It appears that when we had the crash, we lost all the talk about the Kreb's Plant in Newport. I had told my wife (Jeanne Butler) about all the people on here that had worked there, and she asked who they were thinking she would probably know some of them. She was there from December 1974 until December 2005. Started out working with Art Jennings the Plant Engineer and ended her career as the plant manager's secretary. She would like to hear from some of you who remember her.\n\nWayne <twntydasys@aol.com>\n\nNew Castle, DE USA - Monday, March 17, 2008 at 17:49:57 (EST) For Jerry T.....I never lived in that area but I knew of the Cichocki family and that was after his daughter was married....She often spoke of her father and his store and I did see him a couple of times.

Margie Jones was my wife's name until we married in 1964 then Margie Minne. Sweet lady with Strawberry Blond Hair. She was the Receptionist at the Krebbs Plant. If I remember correctly, when south bound on Newport Gap you went under the RR Bridge then immediately left. The main entrance was a few hundred feet in on the left with parking to the right. She had a few interesting experiences there. Margie and I divorced in 1990.\n\nAl Minne <alminne@verizon.net>\n\nTemecula , CA USA - Monday, March 17, 2008 at 14:01:47 (EST) ROSIE: you're right, it was Cichocki!

At Christmas they sold live trees for $3(early to mid 50's).You might also remember the Bobeck family on our block, on Linden St. They had several girls and a boy named Jackie. One of the girls, Phyllis, became a lawyer, I believe, and married a Tom Houghton who was once New Castle County Sheriff. You might be able to help me out with this one: on our block on the corner of Adams and Linden, an older gentleman owned a Dry Goods store. He also owned the Barber shop next to it on Adams St., but I can't remember his name. He was a friendly and kind gentleman who used to give us a dime in our bags for Halloween.Good money back then. It could buy three, 3 cent candy bars with a penny change or two 5 cent bars or 1 extra large 10 cent bar.One last question : next to the Lenkiewicz's at 307 S. Jacvkson St. was a family whose last name escapes me. The lady had a son who was a painter and a daughter who died young leaving a son who was about 7 or 8 at the time, about the same age as Jitterbug and myself.\n\nJerry Tomczyk <sandybeach1@mchsi.com>\n\nDagsboro, De.

We lived on Verona Dr. from '75-2002. SOMEONE was asking me in which Archives I found some info. about Price's Corner. It was in the Archives on this site. St. Hedwig's: There were and still are 2 large Magnolia trees in front of the rectory. In the late spring they have clusters of small white blossoms that emit a pleasing fragrance unlike some of the other type of Magnolias which have an overbearing odor. When the wind was right you could smell them 4 blocks away. I'm trying to find this species to plant, but haven't had any luck.\n\nJerry Tomczyk <sandybeach1@mchsi.com>\n\nDagsboro, De.

I think it was a Model \"T\" Ford or close to that time period, I know it was OLD. He was then and remains today very dedicated to the old WHS. Talking to him Wednesday was a pleasure and a privilege, I always was a big Fan of Pete's.\n\nray Jubb <golfopera@comcast.net>\n\nWilmington, De.

During lunch recess he sold the long stick pretzels from a big can for a penny. A lady, last name Sobocinski, 1100 block Linden and her crystal clear, angelic voice who sang in Church. A Mr.Bonk, the organist, who also had a very deep singing voice. Those beautiful, enchanting and most reverent Church bells who chimed for the Angelus and tolled upon the the death of a parishoner. And lastly the men who tipped their hats when going past the Church and the ladies who wore either their hats or bandanas inside.\n\nJerry Tomczyk <sandybeach1@mchsi.com>\n\nDagsboro, De.

I had 3 older brothers Jack and Jim and Mike. Jack and Jim were both in the service, Jack was in the army and Jim was in the Navy. All 3 of My brothers hung out at the Grill but they were a lot older than me. Jack is 15 years older than me and Jim is 14 years older than me ane Mike was 7 years older than me. Mike was the brother engaged to Tony before he died. I never knew Toni was a dancer in Atlantic city. Next time I run into her at one of my neices I'll have to ask her about it"
