Fraser, and Marcel Nicolaus\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2775–2793, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2775-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2775-2020, 2020\n\nWarm-air entrainment and advection during alpine blowing snow events\n\nNikolas O. Aksamit and John W. Pomeroy\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2795–2807, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2795-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2795-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn cold regions, it is increasingly important to quantify the amount of water stored as snow at the end of winter. Current models are inconsistent in their estimates of snow sublimation due to atmospheric turbulence. Specific wind structures have been identified that amplify potential rates of surface and blowing snow sublimation during blowing snow storms. The recurrence of these motions has been modeled by a simple scaling argument that has its foundation in turbulent boundary layer theory.\n\nBrief communication: Mapping Greenland's perennial firn aquifers using enhanced-resolution L-band brightness temperature image time series\n\nJulie Z. Miller, David G. Long, Kenneth C. Jezek, Joel T. Johnson, Mary J. Brodzik, Christopher A. Shuman, Lora S. Koenig, and Ted A. Scambos\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2809–2817, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2809-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2809-2020, 2020\n\nSoil respiration of alpine meadow is controlled by freezeâthaw processes of active layer in the permafrost region of the QinghaiâTibet Plateau\n\nJunfeng Wang, Qingbai Wu, Ziqiang Yuan, and Hojeong Kang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2835–2848, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2835-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2835-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe active layer, a buffer between permafrost and the atmosphere, is more sensitive and responds more quickly to climate change. How the freeze–thaw action at different stages regulates carbon emissions is still unclear. We conducted 2-year continuous in situ measurements in an alpine meadow permafrost ecosystem in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and found the freeze–thaw process modified the Rs dynamics differently in different stages. Results suggest great changes in freeze–thaw process patterns.\n\nStrain response and energy dissipation of floating saline ice under cyclic compressive stress\n\nMingdong Wei, Arttu PolojÃ¤rvi, David M. Cole, and Malith Prasanna\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2849–2867, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2849-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2849-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLaboratory-scale work on saline ice is usually limited to the use of dry isothermal specimens. Here we developed techniques for conducting floating-ice experiments. The mechanical behavior of floating-ice specimens under cyclic compression was compared with that of dry specimens. Moreover, both of them were successfully analyzed using a theoretical model. Results demonstrate the importance of the work on warm and floating ice, increasingly existing in the polar regions due to climate change.\n\nNew gravity-derived bathymetry for the Thwaites, Crosson, and Dotson ice shelves revealing two ice shelf populations\n\nTom A. Jordan, David Porter, Kirsty Tinto, Romain Millan, Atsuhiro Muto, Kelly Hogan, Robert D. Larter, Alastair G. C. Graham, and John D. Paden\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2869–2882, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2869-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2869-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLinking ocean and ice sheet processes allows prediction of sea level change. Ice shelves form a floating buffer between the ice–ocean systems, but the water depth beneath is often a mystery, leaving a critical blind spot in our understanding of how these systems interact. Here, we use airborne measurements of gravity to reveal the bathymetry under the ice shelves flanking the rapidly changing Thwaites Glacier and adjacent glacier systems, providing new insights and data for future models.\n\nRevealing the former bed of Thwaites Glacier using sea-floor bathymetry: implications for warm-water routing and bed controls on ice flow and buttressing\n\nKelly A. Hogan, Robert D. Larter, Alastair G. C. Graham, Robert Arthern, James D. Kirkham, Rebecca L. Totten, Tom A. Jordan, Rachel Clark, Victoria Fitzgerald, Anna K. WÃ¥hlin, John B. Anderson, Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand, Frank O. Nitsche, Lauren Simkins, James A. Smith, Karsten Gohl, Jan Erik Arndt, Jongkuk Hong, and Julia Wellner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2883–2908, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2883-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2883-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe sea-floor geometry around the rapidly changing Thwaites Glacier is a key control on warm ocean waters reaching the ice shelf and grounding zone beyond. This area was previously unsurveyed due to icebergs and sea-ice cover. The International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration mapped this area for the first time in 2019. The data reveal troughs over 1200 m deep and, as this region is thought to have only ungrounded recently, provide key insights into the morphology beneath the grounded ice sheet.\n\nAnthropogenic climate change versus internal climate variability: impacts on snow cover in the Swiss Alps\n\nFabian Willibald, Sven Kotlarski, Adrienne GrÃªt-Regamey, and Ralf Ludwig\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2909–2924, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2909-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2909-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change will significantly reduce snow cover, but the extent remains disputed. We use regional climate model data as a driver for a snow model to investigate the impacts of climate change and climate variability on snow. We show that natural climate variability is a dominant source of uncertainty in future snow trends. We show that anthropogenic climate change will change the interannual variability of snow. Those factors will increase the vulnerabilities of snow-dependent economies.\n\nSnow depth mapping from stereo satellite imagery in mountainous terrain: evaluation using airborne laser-scanning data\n\nCÃ©sar Deschamps-Berger, Simon Gascoin, Etienne Berthier, Jeffrey Deems, Ethan Gutmann, Amaury Dehecq, David Shean, and Marie Dumont\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2925–2940, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2925-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2925-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate a recent method to map snow depth based on satellite photogrammetry. We compare it with accurate airborne laser-scanning measurements in the Sierra Nevada, USA. We find that satellite data capture the relationship between snow depth and elevation at the catchment scale and also small-scale features like snow drifts and avalanche deposits. We conclude that satellite photogrammetry stands out as a convenient method to estimate the spatial distribution of snow depth in high mountains.\n\nBrief Communication: Mesoscale and submesoscale dynamics in the marginal ice zone from sequential synthetic aperture radar observations\n\nIgor E. Kozlov, Evgeny V. Plotnikov, and Georgy E. Manucharyan\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2941–2947, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2941-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2941-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we demonstrate a recently emerged opportunity to retrieve high-resolution surface current velocities from sequential spaceborne radar images taken over low-concentration ice regions of polar oceans. Such regularly available data uniquely resolve complex surface ocean dynamics even at small scales and can be used in operational applications to assess and predict transport and distribution of biogeochemical substances and pollutants in ice-covered waters.\n\nA model for interaction between conduits and surrounding hydraulically connected distributed drainage based on geomorphological evidence from Keewatin, Canada\n\nEmma L. M. Lewington, Stephen J. Livingstone, Chris D. Clark, Andrew J. Sole, and Robert D. Storrar\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2949–2976, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2949-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2949-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe map visible traces of subglacial meltwater flow across Keewatin, Canada. Eskers are commonly observed to form within meltwater corridors up to a few kilometres wide, and we interpret different traces to have formed as part of the same integrated drainage system. In our proposed model, we suggest that eskers record the imprint of a central conduit while meltwater corridors represent the interaction with the surrounding distributed drainage system.\n\nEstimating statistical errors in retrievals of ice velocity and deformation parameters from satellite images and buoy arrays\n\nWolfgang Dierking, Harry L. Stern, and Jennifer K. Hutchings\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2999–3016, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2999-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2999-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMonitoring deformation of sea ice is useful for studying effects of ice compression and divergent motion on the ice mass balance and ocean–ice–atmosphere interactions. In calculations of deformation parameters not only the measurement uncertainty of drift vectors has to be considered. The size of the area and the time interval used in the calculations have to be chosen within certain limits to make sure that the uncertainties of deformation parameters are smaller than their real magnitudes.\n\nBayesian calibration of firn densification models\n\nVincent Verjans, Amber A. Leeson, Christopher Nemeth, C. Max Stevens, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Brice NoÃ«l, and Jan Melchior van Wessem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3017–3032, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3017-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3017-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce sheets are covered by a firn layer, which is the transition stage between fresh snow and ice. Accurate modelling of firn density properties is important in many glaciological aspects. Current models show disagreements, are mostly calibrated to match specific observations of firn density and lack thorough uncertainty analysis. We use a novel calibration method for firn models based on a Bayesian statistical framework, which results in improved model accuracy and in uncertainty evaluation.\n\n| Highlight paper\n\nISMIP6 Antarctica: a multi-model ensemble of the Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the 21st century\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

This study presents an ensemble of model simulations of the Antarctic evolution over the 2015–2100 period based on various ice sheet models, climate forcings and emission scenarios. Results suggest that the West Antarctic ice sheet will continue losing a large amount of ice, while the East Antarctic ice sheet could experience increased snow accumulation.\n\n| Highlight paper\n\nThe future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Anthony Payne, Eric Larour, Helene Seroussi, William H.

Smith, Fiamma Straneo, Lev Tarasov, Roderik van de Wal, and Michiel van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3071–3096, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3071-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3071-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we use a large ensemble of Greenland ice sheet models forced by six different global climate models to project ice sheet changes and sea-level rise contributions over the 21st century. The results for two different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass until 2100, with contributions to sea-level rise of 90 Â± 50 mm and 32 Â± 17 mm for the high (RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) scenario, respectively.\n\nThe role of history and strength of the oceanic forcing in sea level projections from Antarctica with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model\n\nRonja Reese, Anders Levermann, Torsten Albrecht, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3097–3110, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3097-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3097-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare 21st century projections of Antarctica's future sea-level contribution simulated with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model submitted to ISMIP6 with projections following the LARMIP-2 protocol based on the same model configuration. We find that (1) a preceding historic simulation increases mass loss by 5–50 % and that (2) the order of magnitude difference in the ice loss in our experiments following the two protocols can be explained by the translation of ocean forcing to sub-shelf melting.\n\n| Highlight paper\n\nA protocol for calculating basal melt rates in the ISMIP6 Antarctic ice sheet projections\n\nNicolas C. Jourdain, Xylar Asay-Davis, Tore Hattermann, Fiammetta Straneo, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Christopher M. Little, and Sophie Nowicki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3111–3134, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3111-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3111-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo predict the future Antarctic contribution to sea level rise, we need to use ice sheet models. The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for AR6 (ISMIP6) builds an ensemble of ice sheet projections constrained by atmosphere and ocean projections from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). In this work, we present and assess a method to derive ice shelf basal melting in ISMIP6 from the CMIP6 ocean outputs, and we give examples of projected melt rates.\n\nEvaluating permafrost physics in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models and their sensitivity to climate change\n\nEleanor J. Burke, Yu Zhang, and Gerhard Krinner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3155–3174, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3155-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3155-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPermafrost will degrade under future climate change. This will have implications locally for the northern high-latitude regions and may well also amplify global climate change. There have been some recent improvements in the ability of earth system models to simulate the permafrost physical state, but further model developments are required. Models project the thawed volume of soil in the top 2 m of permafrost will increase by 10 %–40 % °C−1 of global mean surface air temperature increase.\n\nAn analysis of instabilities and limit cycles in glacier-dammed reservoirs\n\nChristian Schoof\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3175–3194, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3175-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3175-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacier lake outburst floods are major glacial hazards in which ice-dammed reservoirs rapidly drain, often in a recurring fashion. The main flood phase typically involves a growing channel being eroded into ice by water flow. What is poorly understood is how that channel first comes into being. In this paper, I investigate how an under-ice drainage system composed of small, naturally occurring voids can turn into a channel and how this can explain the cyclical behaviour of outburst floods.\n\nHow much snow falls in the world's mountains? A first look at mountain snowfall estimates in A-train observations and reanalyses\n\nAnne Sophie Daloz, Marian Mateling, Tristan L'Ecuyer, Mark Kulie, Norm B. Wood, Mikael Durand, Melissa Wrzesien, Camilla W. Stjern, and Ashok P. Dimri\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3195–3207, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3195-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3195-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe total of snow that falls globally is a critical factor governing freshwater availability. To better understand how this resource is impacted by climate change, we need to know how reliable the current observational datasets for snow are. Here, we compare five datasets looking at the snow falling over the mountains versus the other continents. We show that there is a large consensus when looking at fractional contributions but strong dissimilarities when comparing magnitudes.\n\nBrief communication: Time step dependence (and fixes) in Stokes simulations of calving ice shelves\n\nBrandon Berg and Jeremy Bassis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3209–3213, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3209-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3209-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComputer models of ice sheets and glaciers are an important component of projecting sea level rise due to climate change. For models that seek to simulate the full balance of forces within the ice, if portions of the glacier are allowed to quickly break off in a process called iceberg calving, a numerical issue arises that can cause inaccurate results. We examine the issue and propose a solution so that future models can more accurately predict the future behavior of ice sheets and glaciers.\n\nTowards understanding the pattern of glacier mass balances in High Mountain Asia using regional climatic modelling\n\nRemco J. de Kok, Philip D. A. Kraaijenbrink, Obbe A. Tuinenburg, Pleun N. J. Bonekamp, and Walter W. Immerzeel\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3215–3234, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3215-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3215-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers worldwide are shrinking, yet glaciers in parts of High Mountain Asia are growing. Using models of the regional climate and glacier growth, we reproduce the observed patterns of glacier growth and shrinkage in High Mountain Asia of the last decades. Increases in snow, in part from water that comes from lowland agriculture, have probably been more important than changes in temperature to explain the growing glaciers. We now better understand changes in the crucial mountain water cycle."
