        "text": "LOS ANGELES — William Wilberforce, the English abolitionist of two centuries ago, believed in the power of co-belligerents: those who fight for a common cause while disagreeing forcefully on most everything else.\n\nThese days, he is inspiring the executives at Walden Media, the family-values-oriented entertainment company that produced “The Chronicles of Narnia” trilogy.\n\nSince last year, Walden and its sister brand, Bristol Bay Productions — both operated by the Anschutz Film Group — have been in the throes of a transformation that finds them, like Mr. Wilberforce, courting allies from across a deep cultural divide.\n\nWalden — owned by the billionaire Philip Anschutz, who is known for his Christian beliefs — makes no R-rated films, rarely risks even a PG-13 and strictly avoids scripts with profanity or overtones of sex. And while it eschews overt spiritual messaging, it seeks out films that possess a clear, inspirational quality.\n\nAnschutz Film Group executives, led by the chief operating officer, Frank Smith, and president, Micheal Flaherty, say they are keeping those values intact. But they are changing their company’s business strategy to focus heavily on joint ventures and often aligning with cultural opposites, in a nod to the shifting economics of the film business.\n\n“If we continued to operate under the model we were operating under, we couldn’t be relevant,” Mr. Smith said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
