        "text": "Captain Arthur Waite raced his supercharged Austin 7 to victory in the 1928 Australian Grand Prix on Victoria’s Phillip Island…\n\nHere ‘The Skipper’ as his boys in the UK called him, on the far side of the car, and his Australian mechanic, Guy Barringer are preparing the racer behind the Isle of Wight Hotel in Cowes during the race weekend, 31 March 1928.\n\nBilled at the time by the promoter, Victoria’s ‘Light Car Club’ as the ‘100 Miles Road Race’, ‘The First In Australia’ the event was run on a dirt-circuit laid out on the Islands roads, it later became recognised as the first Australian Grand Prix- the Victorian Light Car Club named subsequent events held at ‘Island from 1929-1935 as ‘The Australian Grand Prix’.\n\nIn more recent times the first AGP has been acknowledged by many as that held on 15 January 1927. It was a knockout speedway event held at the Goulburn, New South Wales horse racing track. The cars didn’t race ‘en masse’ but rather six competitors ran, two at a time in three heats, knockout fashion over 4 laps of a 1 mile and a bit oval track with the final decided by the fastest two competitors from the heats facing off over 6 laps- Geoff Meredith was the winner in his Bugatti T30. The circumstances around the discovery and recognition of the First Australian Grand Prix are briefly ventilated in this article; https://primotipo.com/2017/04/14/1936-australian-grand-prix-victor-harbour/\n\nThe 1928 ‘Island event was a road race held on a 6.5 mile dirt, rectangular course for cars of less than 2 litres spread across four engine capacity based classes- in two races, each race having two of the classes in it of 100 miles distance.\n\nTwenty six ‘light car’ competitors entered with thirteen classified as finishers. The winner was the fastest overall- as in the competitor with the quickest race time from the two events of 100 miles, Captain Arthur Waite in his ‘works’ Austin 7 s/c won from JO McCutcheon aboard a Morris Cowley and CR Dickason in an Austin 12.\n\nHistoric European Context…\n\nIt is timely to look at motorsport in Australia in the context of what was happening globally at the time.\n\nMotor racing commenced in France, the first ‘motoring contest’ took place on July 22, 1894, organised by a Paris newspaper, the Paris-Rouen Rally was 126 km from Paris to Rouen.\n\nCount Jules Albert de Dion was first into Rouen after 6 hours 48 minutes, an average speed of 19 km/h (12 mph). The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their speed, handling and safety characteristics- De Dion’s steam car needed a stoker which the judges deemed to be outside their objectives…\n\nAnd so commenced a period of racing unregulated cars on open roads between cities, this evolved after many deaths, from racing on open to closed road circuits. During the Paris-Madrid road race of 1903 a number of people, both drivers and pedestrians – including Marcel Renault were killed, as a result the race was stopped by French authorities at Bordeaux- further road based events were banned.\n\nIn the US the Gordon Bennett Races for the ‘Gordon Bennett Cup’ funded by American newspaper magnate James Gordon Bennett in commenced in 1900. Its formula was based around similar vehicles competing on closed roads but representation was limited to three teams per country, this disadvantaged France as the largest European motor manufacturer at the time.\n\nWhen the French proposal to change representation in the 1905 Gordon Bennett failed they used the chance to host the 1906 event, a privilege to the previous years winner, to hold the alternative ‘Grand Prix de l’ACF’. The French Grand Prix was held on 26 June 1906 over a 103 Km roughly triangular road circuit near Sarthe, the winner of the 1238 Km, event, held over 6 laps of the 103 Km course on two days was Hungarian Ferenc Szisz in a Renault.\n\nIn the US, William Vanderbilt launched the Vanderbilt Cup at Long Island, New York in 1904.\n\nRaces at the time were heavily nationalistic, with a few countries setting up races of their own, but there was no formal championship tying them together. Rules varied from country to country and race to race, and typically centred on maximum (not minimum) weights in an effort to limit power by limiting engine size indirectly. 10–15 litre engines were common, usually with no more than four cylinders and producing less than 50 hp. The cars all had mechanics onboard as well as the driver and no one was allowed to work on the cars during the race except this pair.\n\nIn 1904 many national motor clubs combined to form the AIACR ‘Association Interntionale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus’ to regulate racing, amongst other things.\n\nThe American Grand Prix , ‘American Grand Prize’ was first held on a public road course at Savannah, Georgia in 1908. Italy’s first Grand Prix was held on a road course at Brescia in 1921. The first Spanish Grand Prix on 1913 on a road circuit near Madrid, majestic Spa-Francorchamps hosted the first Belgian GP in 1925. Road racing was banned in the UK but the ‘Royal Automobile Club Grand Prix’ was held on the combined Brooklands road/banked circuit in 1926. Some of these events aren’t all continuous mind you, nor were they originally called ‘Grand Prix’ in some cases but you get the drift.\n\nClearly it is not a big deal to call the 1928 Phillip Island ‘100 Miles Road Race’ the AGP given the first American and British Grand’s Prix weren’t strictly called ‘American or British Grand Prix’ either.\n\nBy 1927 and 1928 the period of the AGP i am writing about the essence of International GP rules was as follows;\n\n1927; 1.5 litres supercharged capacity, cars had a minimum weight of 700 Kg, two seater bodies were mandated or monopostos allowed as long as the cockpit was a minimum of 80 cm wide. The events themselves were a minimum of 600 Km in length.\n\n1928; No engine capacity restrictions but a minimum weight of 550 and a maximum of 750 Kg, minimum race distance still 600 Km. This 750 Kg Formula gave birth to the phenomenal ‘Silver’ Arrows’ of the pre-war period of course.\n\nThe relevance of these rules in far away Australia with its nascent motor industry, small national ‘car park’ and tiny number of competitors was moot, irrelevant in fact, arguably it was not until the 1955 South Pacific Trophy meeting at Gnoo Blas, Orange, New South Wales that we had our first ‘truly International race’, run as it was to Formula Libre.\n\nHistoric Australian Context…\n\nNone of our events at the time resembled those in Europe, we had no specialist motorsport governing body- the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (very recently re-named Motorsport Australia) was formed in the mid-fifties. Racing decisions prior to the CAMS existence were made by the Competitions Committee of the Australian Automobile Association, an organisation of each states automobile peak body or club, each of which were naturally primarily concerned with everyday motoring/motorists needs.\n\nThe level of car ownership in Australia was low, the number of ‘racing cars’ small and so it naturally followed that our events suited our needs, inclusive of our premier race.\n\nGraham Howard observes in ‘The Fifty Year History of the Australian Grand Prix ‘that intercity records-amazing feats, and of dubious legality as well-were the most consistent form of competitive motoring in Australia until the late 1920s, and produced our first household name drivers and some of our first marque rivalries’.\n\nAt 100 miles the 1928 Phillip Island event is ‘pissant’ compared to contemporary European GPs of 600 Km. A 6 mile, 6 lap AGP held on a short oval track between two competitors is outrageous but comparisons cannot really be fairly made with events in Europe and the US at the time.\n\nThe 1928 100 Miles Road Race aka 1928 Australian Grand Prix, Phillip Island, Victoria…\n\nThe difficulties of holding a road race in Australia at the time were great, in most states road races were illegal including Victoria- under the provisions of the ‘Highways and Vehicles Act’ racing on other than enclosed circuits, which at the time consisted only of speedways, was illegal.\n\nThe local council, the ‘Phillip Island and Woolamai Shire’ voted to sever the Island’s government from Victoria’s in 1927 thus making racing on the Island a possibility. After a hard fought campaign the ‘Shire of Phillip Island ‘ was created in 1928, the creation of ‘The Peoples Republic of Phillip Island’ really does give me a chuckle, why don’t we secede?- sounds like the sand-gropers (West Australians) today.\n\nA delegation was despatched by the Victorian Motor Cycle Union in Melbourne to Cowes, the Islands ‘capital’ with a view to running ‘bike events.\n\nIt was quite a trip in those days involving a drive from Melbourne and sea ferry from Stony Point to Cowes, the bridge allowing road traffic from San Remo on the mainland to Newhaven on the Island wasn’t opened until 1940. The Motor Cycle Union were later joined by a group from the Light Car Club of Victoria, proposing racing events on the island in March 1928.\n\nThe Phillip Island Shire saw the economic benefits racing would bring to their small rural community so they voted in support of defying the existing Victorian state law and announced a 100 Mile Race for cars to be held on March 26 1928.\n\nAmongst the delegation included Jack Day (and his T37 Bugatti) Bill Scott, and LCCA president and later 1929 AGP winner, Arthur Terdich. After several ‘reccies’, the group retired to the Isle of Wight Hotel which is still keeping competitors refreshed nearly a century later to discuss the event, which seemed impossible given the time available for its preparation given the state of the roads and other logistics.\n\nJim Scaysbrook in a MotorSport article wrote that ‘Scott suggested the names for the corners; he said that the luncheon gathering reminded him of ‘Young and Jackson’s’, the famous pub opposite Flinders Street Railway Station in Melbourne. ‘Gentle Ann’ was named after a country maid of British folklore, the following narrow cutting christened ‘Needle’s Eye’- ‘Devil’s Slide’ was likened to falling into ‘Hell’, which then became the name for the third corner. Scott admitted to heaving a huge sigh of relief at negotiating the narrow bridge halfway along the next straight, so this became the ‘Bridge of Sighs’ and the final bend, reminding him of peace after torment, became ‘Heaven Corner’.\n\nScott measured the circuit, borrowing a horse and cart. He nailed a strip of rubber to the inside of the wheel and counted the number of times it flicked his boot, multiplying this by the wheel circumference produced the figure of 6.569 miles per lap.\n\nThe circuit itself presented a real challenge in that the road was very narrow with a high crown and was extremely dusty- whilst the surface was partially consolidated by blue metal rolled into the gravel it was entirely unsealed.\n\nAn inspection of the circuit by 130 Light Car Club members on 4 March revealed a surface in very poor repair. The LCC Committee therefore advised the local council that Commonwealth Oil Refinery and Castrol would provide 5,000 gallons of sump oil to be spread over the track to reduce dust levels. This work was overseen by the COR’s Charlie Watt who found the time to take some of the wonderful photographs spread throughout this article.\n\nWhilst the feature event in 1928 was ‘The 100 Miles Road Race’, when it was discovered that the rights to stage the ‘Australian Grand Prix’, held at Goulburn in 1927, had not been taken up for 1929 the LCC began to apply the AGP term to Phillip Island.\n\nThe event was very much an adventure for competitors almost none of whom had road racing experience- their ‘racing’ was variously trials, hillclimbs and in some cases speedway.\n\nEntries closed on 24 February- thirty were received with twenty-six accepted which in the end converted to seventeen starters due to accidents and mechanical mayhem- thirteen cars were manufactured in the UK, eight in France, two in Germany with one apiece from Belgium and Italy.\n\n‘With the exception of one or two entries, the field comprised either standard touring or sports chassis stripped of road equipment and in some instances fitted with narrower and more efficient bodywork…not many modifications were indulged in, other than careful assembly and the polishing of heads and ports and in some instances a slight increase in compression, the use of stronger or double valve springs and the employment of a larger or outside exhaust system’ wrote John Blanden.\n\nLet’s not forget at the time ‘top whack’ of a garden variety Ford, Morris or Citroen was 50-55mph together with a few ‘Hail Marys’ whilst clutching yer St Christopher medallion from father at the wheel.\n\nPlenty of newspaper interest was generated in the ‘big smoke’ (Melbourne) in the lead up to the event with police from later in March turning a blind eye to stripped cars devoid of silencers blasting along the narrow, relatively deserted roads of Melbourne-Frankston-Hastings.\n\nRacing was totally different to today when even production cars are trailered to events. There were no trucks or trailers to take the racers to the meeting, the racing cars were driven by their owners or drivers with spares, consumables and tools loaded into the car- or what wifey, friend or sponsor could carry in a separate vehicle which was then driven to Stony Point and loaded onto the Westernport Shipping Company ferry for the short trip across Westernport.\n\nPhillip Island was then a sleepy rural and fishing hamlet with a nascent tourism industry, accommodation was provided by two hotels- The Isle of Wight and Phillip Island Hotel and a swag a boarding houses which filled up very quickly with the influx of thousands of people the likes of which the Island had never experienced before.\n\nCharlie Watt took many photographs at a hotel which appear to be The Isle of Wight, it burned own the 1925 and was rebuilt in the ‘Tudor’ style one can see in many of the shots- my guess is that the garage shots are at the same establishment- the Phillip Island Hotel appears far more modest in comparison.\n\nThe challenges of communication back then were so different to today- the local populace knew when the event was taking place via newspapers but the timing of practice was a different thing without a local radio station even if the punters possessed a ‘wireless’ in any event.\n\nIt was hoped that word of mouth and notices on public buildings and shops would do the trick but the possibility of wandering sheep or cattle or Farmer Brown aboard his horse-drawn rig ‘on track’ was not beyond the realms of possibility- a job for the solitary local police constable whose number was bolstered by another couple of souls when police HQ in Russell Street realised the scale of the public event being staged in the Peoples Republic of Phillip Island a couple of hours away from Melbourne.\n\nAll was set for first practice on Wednesday 21 March, the first casualty was the SC Cox Bugatti T39 which crashed on the home turn onto the straight- Waite lapped at 57 mph ‘his Austin seemingly on rails’. Official practice took place on the Saturday with Cox’ repaired Bug providing more excitement when it shed a tyre at 90 mph and ‘made a sensational skid at the Bridge of Sighs’. Jack Day did 61 mph in his Bugatti T37. Ed Hussey and Phyllis Passmore’s Frazer Nash took off over a hill, as an escape road after brake failure on the approach to Young and Jacksons- the rear axle had moved forward its springs making the cable operated brakes inoperative…\n\nBill Williamson’s Riley found a road roller working on the two-mile stretch, skidded and overturned chucking the driver and his passenger out fortunately without injury- the car landed upside down in the bush with radiator, scuttle, tail and steering wheel smashed- by Monday she was ready again to ‘rock and roll’ and looking good as the photograph above shows.\n\nEdward Huon aboard John Goodall’s Aston Martin added to the excitement after shedding a wheel- he too rolled but again the pilot and mechanic, Bob Horne were ok. WH ‘Bill’ Lowe, later importer of Ferrari and Lancia into Australia broke a wheel of his Metallurgique at Heaven Corner whilst Wagner skidded at the same spot after a tyre burst on his Wanderer.\n\n‘Finally Maurice Shmith’s narrow, scarlet Fiat tried to take Young and Jacksons corner too fast, jumped a gutter and plunged through a hedge and a wire fence surrounding a house on the corner. The car was almost immediately shot back onto the roadway by the catapulting effect of the wire fence, fortunately without too much damage to the car and with the passengers only stunned by the suddenness of it all’ John Blanden wrote.\n\nNo times from practice are available but doubtless by the end of practice the crews were well aware of the challenges of this simple in some ways, but dangerous and demanding road course.\n\nUnseasonally, the weather gods turned on the Sunday night- raceday was Monday 26 March- the heavens opened completely swamping the course- given the lack of the TV, internet, iPhones, Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram the Light Car Club decided to hold some flying half mile sprints on the highest, driest straight between Heaven and Young and Jacksons to entertain the crowd who poured in from the mainland on the SS Alvina and Killara. Jack Day’s Bugatti was timed at 84 mph which was the quickest, later in the day the sandy soil dried sufficiently to run and some 3 lap races were organised with Cox scoring a win.\n\nWhen the field finally assembled on March 31, 1928, the event didn’t attract the number of spectators who attended on The Eight Hours Day long weekend.\n\n‘Nevertheless, the attendance was regarded as highly satisfactory and the racing, although never close enough to be exciting or fast enough to be really thrilling, attracted so much interest that it is likely that the club will make the race an annual event. It is claimed to be the first 100 mile motor race in Australia, ‘The Argus’ newspaper reported .\n\nOf the 26 cars entered 17 started- the Class A capacity limit was 750cc, Class B to 1100cc, Class C to 1500cc and Class D to 2 litres- competitors had to race on Australian made tyres.\n\nFancied combinations included Ed H Cooper’s Frazer Nash which burst into flames whilst parked in the main street of Cowes and was utterly destroyed despite attempts to extinguish the blaze. The three Bugattis of Jack Day (Type 37A), Sid Cox (Type 39) and Arthur Terdich (T40)- although Arthur Waite’s supercharged Austin 7 was also seen to be an outside chance.\n\nThe morning’s race, for Classes B and D, got under way at 11am, with a maximum of two hours 30 minutes allowed to complete the 16 laps.\n\nBarney Dentry’s Senechal was delayed early with a broken gear lever, Williamson’s Riley 9 led for 5 laps then he had mechanical problems giving Bill Terdich’s DFP the lead.\n\nHe stayed in front until valve troubles caused his retirement so Barney Dentry, with his gear lever repaired, won Class B from Williamson’s Riley and Pounds DFP.\n\nIn Class D John McCutcheon led from start to finish in his Morris Cowley from Cyril Dickason’s Austin 12 in a time of 1hr 50min 10sec – the mark that the afternoon cars would need to beat to win the contest.\n\nThe second heat, for Classes A and C, left the line at 3pm and ‘provided the most thrilling driving of the day’, with Waite making the early running, he had a lead of 100 metres at the first turn only a mile from the start.\n\n‘The turning of the small cars on the corners provided many thrills for the spectators. There were spectacular skids, but the cars were always handled with so much skill that the drivers recovered control without apparent difficulty’ The Argus reported, whilst noting that Waite was not in doubt to win Class A.\n\nFor the first 7 laps Waite’s Austin led the field, gradually the Bugattis of Day and Terdich got into their stride, with the latter taking the lead on lap 8 and was led by nine minutes as it entered the fifteenth lap, only for the French exotic to stop on course seemingly out of fuel.\n\nTerdich hitched a ride to the pits, returning to the track soon after with tins of fuel only to find that his mechanics had retrieved the Bug and coaxed it back into the pits!\n\nFinally Terdich and his car were reunited and refuelled and sped off in pursuit of Waite who had stopped to refuel, having lost 3 minutes. Day was fast after an excursion early in the race had put him through a hedge, but time ran out for the Bugatti despite a series of laps late in the race of over 70mph.\n\nWaite took the flag in 1hr 46min 40sec and was chaired from his ‘Baby Austin’ as ‘The Argus’ described it, to the victory dais by jubilant supporters.\n\nClass A was won by Waite from C May, T Davey and S King all in Austin 7’s, only Waite’s machine was supercharged. In Class B Barney Dentry in his Senechal won from Williamson’s Riley 9 and Les Pound’s DFP. Class C was taken by Terdich’s Bugatti T40 from Day’s Bugatti T37A and the J Hutton Alvis 12/50.\n\nJohn McCutcheon’s Morris Cowley won Class D despite having more than 21,000 road miles on its odometer! ‘Such performances as these, and that of Mr Hinkler in his British-built light aeroplane, should remove any doubt as to the return of Britain to world leadership in the automotive field’ ‘The Argus’ reported, breathlessly and patriotically- we were a British Dominion then after all!, the Federation of Australia duly noted in 1901. Second in Class D was Cyril Dickason’s Austin 12 and Bill Lowe’s Metallurgique.\n\n‘Probably Waite’s win was due chiefly to his remarkably cool driving throughout and his deliberate stop half way through the race for a methodical refilling of his tiny supercharged Austin with water, oil and petrol. A similar stop would probably have won the race for Arthur Terdich (Bugatti), who seemingly had the race in hand two laps before the finish. Petrol troubles then stopped his car, and Waite won before Terdich got going again…recorded the Geelong Advertiser. ‘Waite won using Shell spirit and oil and Australian made Perdriau tyres’- it was usually the case that the ‘paper reports of the day recorded this information- early advertorial perhaps.\n\nIn a word from the sponsor, the Managing Director and owner of Austin Distributors Pty. Ltd. SA Cheney said that ‘…it is pleasing that our confidence in (the Morris and Austin cars the company distributed) their quality and stamina is being so constantly rewarded in successive reliability trials and road contests.’\n\n‘A notable feature of the race was that every Austin which started finished the race. SV King’s car being one of the only three cars to run non-stop, an honour also gained by McCutcheon’s Morris and Dickason’s Austin 12’ the ‘Tiser concluded.\n\nFive thousand spectators went home covered in dust but happy – the largest influx of people in the island’s history, the Shire’s brave decision to back the race was vindicated, the race became a fixture at the ‘Island until 1935 when the intrinsic nature of the gravel track- without change to a sealed surface had run its course.\n\nThe winners of the AGP in the Phillip Island era were Bill Thompson in 1930 and 1932 in a Bugatti Type 37 and 1933 aboard a Riley Brooklands. Arthur Terdich won in 1929 in a Bugatti T37A, Carl Junker in 1931 in another Bugatti, a T39, Bob Lea-Wright in a Singer 9 Le Mans in 1934 and finally Les Murphy in an MG P type in 1935. Thompson was second in 1934 and 1935 off scratch and was well and truly the driver of the era, and regarded as one of Australia’s greatest ever. Click here for a piece on Thompson; https://primotipo.com/2018/10/26/gerringong-beach-races-1930-bill-thompson/\n\nThe following piece from the fifty year anniversary meeting program of the then first Australian Grand Prix in 1978, was written by John Williams, a journalist who attended and covered the 1928 race.\n\nDo read it, he paints the most marvellous picture of the times and the meeting.\n\nThe end of the Phillip Island AGP Era…\n\nPhillip Island’s eighth and final Australian Grand Prix took place in March 1935, it had been decided to rotate the race amongst the states, the 1936 event moved to Victor Harbour, South Australia- the South Australian Centenary Grand Prix held on 26 December 1936, was later erroneously and incorrectly appropriated as the 1937 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nThe loss of ‘their’ event was seen as a crushing blow by the Light Car Club, but it was not entirely unexpected, racing on potholed unsealed roads may have been acceptable in the 1920s, but by 1936 it was out of the question, so was the prospect of sealing the Phillip Island track, the economics simply did not stack up.\n\nA new promoter, the ‘Australian Racing Drivers Club’, conducted racing on a shorter 3.3-mile Phillip Island circuit which used only the original start/finish straight (on Berry’s Beach Road) but by 1938 the cars were gone, although motorcycles ran their annual Tourist Trophy on that layout until 1940.\n\nIt would be December 1956 before the island saw motor racing action again, this time at a new purpose-built circuit south west of Cowes.\n\nThe roads of the Phillip Island road circuit are still intact…\n\nThey were clearly marked after the 50 year anniversary of the AGP held in 1978- what an event that was, one for another time.\n\nIts well worth a visit and a few gentle laps amongst the PI tourist traffic, the place is a popular destination for surfers, holiday makers and tourists seeking koalas and the fairy penguin nightly scuttle from the water to their nests in the sand dunes-and of course bike and car enthusiasts visiting the circuit and its museum.\n\nThe start/finish area is located on Berry’s Beach Road, the pits used to be located in a large paddock, which today is still a large paddock.\n\nFrom the start, the road rises slightly to Heaven Corner, the first of the four right-hand, right-angle bends. From here it’s a flat-out blast along the still-narrow undulating high crowned road, past a small monument which has a map of the original track inset into the stone, to Young and Jackson’s Corner, almost two miles away. On your left, a timber plaque displays the corner name, although the original bend is now a large roundabout. Once this is negotiated, another straight (the main road from Cowes back to Melbourne) takes you to within 400 metres of Gentle Annie Corner.\n\nThe highway now swings left, so the approach to Gentle Annie is not the original straightforward 90-degree corner, but is clearly signposted and easily found. From here it’s another two-mile roller-coaster ride over the hillocks and humps, encountering The Needle’s Eye at the halfway point, which is no longer a needle, nor an eye.\n\nHell Corner has recently been obliterated by a roundabout- once you’re through the maze the road stretches out ahead over more gentle rises, with the former Bridge of Sighs at about half distance and the old pits on the left- and that’s it.\n\nIn the 1930s the landscape was more barren, caused by the penchant to denude the landscape of trees to allow the maximum number of sheep per acre, and, of course, the road is fully sealed, unlike the days when vast quantities of black sump oil was laid to ‘kill’ the dust\n\nCaptain Arthur Waite and his Austin 7…\n\nAs we have just see, the 1928 victor was a ‘Baby Austin’, a prototype of the supercharged ‘Super Sports’ package released that year.\n\nWaite was born in Adelaide on 9 April 1984, he lived and attended school in Norwood before attending the Adelaide School of Mines and was then apprenticed to JH Southcott until the outbreak of the Great War.\n\nHe joined up and soon achieved the rank of Second-Lieutenant in the Australian Field Artillery, he then took a reduction in rank to ensure his qualification for overseas service- after training in Egypt he landed in Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 also serving in North Africa and France where in 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross\n\nHis wife was Irene Austin – daughter of Lord Herbert Austin, founder of Britain’s Austin Motor Company. The pair met during Waite’s War service, he was injured in France and met Irene, a volunteer nurse, during his recovery, they married in 1918 and Waite, an engineer, was introduced into the Austin family business on his twenty-fifth birthday- 9 April 1919.\n\nWaite thought that racing would improve vehicle development and enhance sales, with Herbert Austin’s support he began to develop, build and test racing and sportscars amongst his other responsibilities.\n\nIn 1923, together with Alf Depper, foreman of the Experimental and Racing Department the pair drove a 7 to Monza, won the first International Italian Grand Prix for Light Cars on 20 April and then drove home again- success at Brooklands quickly followed when Waite broke all existing 750cc class records.\n\nIn 1925 ‘The Skipper’ set up racing ‘shops at Longbridge where work started on the first supercharged 7, this was not initially successful so Austin designed a Roots type blower with three impellers. The blower was mounted on a cradle atop the timing cover utilising magneto drive gear revolving at a quicker engine ratio of 1.25:1- 36 bhp @ 5000 rpm was the result.\n\nFitted into a 7 foot 3 inch wheelbase chassis with a fabric covered body the car made 92 mph and 86 mph for the two-way flying kilometre. Later that year Waite, with the car bored to 775 cc ran it in the 1100cc class of the 200 Mile Race at Brooklands- along with five other 7s. ‘By the end of 1928 Waite held all the class H (750cc) records’ Bryan Purves wrote\n\nHerbert Austin was keen to broaden his son-in-law’s management experience and shipped him off to Australia to do so, SA Cheney, the owner of Austin Distributors was glad to have him aboard ‘to try and double sales’.\n\nWhen Waite became aware of the 1928 ‘Island race he requested that his old car be sent to the colonies but unknown to him his supercharged racer, less engine had been sold to Johnny Pares, a Longbridge employee (or dealer depending upon your source), suitably re-engined it raced successfully obtaining the nickname ‘Slippery Anne’ along the way.\n\nWaite was therefore sent a car which was basically a prototype of the ‘Supercharged Sports’ which was going into production to qualify for the Ulster Tourist Trophy.\n\nThe chassis of the car (number unknown) was standard as were the springs but they were cord bound- a straight front axle was also standard along with production friction dampers- the steering column was lowered to suit the longer bonnet Waite had made by a coach-builder in Melbourne.\n\nThe engine was supercharged, fitted with a Laystall steel crankshaft and pressure lubricated. The Cozette Number 4 blower created a boost of 5psi drawing air from a Cozette carburettor. All of the alloy castings of the engine were prefixed with the letters ‘SP’- the crankcase had the casting number ‘SP767.’\n\nThe inlet manifold was designed to slide over long studs and the exhaust was taken out of the nearside bonnet panel via a three-port exhaust manifold which continued along the side of the body. Its output was 33-35 bhp at 5000 rpm which converted to a top speed on the long Phillip Island straights of about 75 mph.\n\nThe gearbox was trick too- it was four rather than three speeds but reverse was omitted to find the requisite space inside the standard case.\n\nAustin Works engineer, team manager and driver Charles Goodacre described the completed Waite car ‘As the most dreadful thing you ever saw, for it looked like an enormous egg and when the driver sat in it his head stuck out of the top. Anyway, the whole thing was put together and tested locally instead of being sent to Brooklands. There was a straight stretch of road from Rubery to Bromsgrove over which a local motorcycle company used to test their TT machines at over 100 mph early in the morning…They went there early in the morning when it was safe…I drove it to carry out the road testing and the car had quite a good performance. It would do 90 mph easily and the engine would tun at about 5500 rpm. It was quite smooth, and it was reliable.’\n\n‘Sir Herbert saw the car in the works on his return from South Africa and asked what it was. When told it was the car that was going to Waite in Australia he asked how they proposed sending it and was told they were making a crate for it. “We’re not wasting, time, wood and money on a crate. It looks like a bath, it will float so let the boat tow it to Australia” Austin quipped!\n\nThe bathtub which won the Australian Grand Prix it seems!\n\nTwo other similar cars were produced by Longridge which were raced by Sidney Holbrook and Gunnar Poppe- entered at Shelsey Walsh, the pair were knocked off by George Coldicutt in ‘Slippery Anne’.\n\n‘Col Waite as well as his other titles was a Freeman of the City of London and a Life member of the British Racing Drivers Club’ Tony Johns added, Johns suggested the inclusion of Waite’s Foreword from John Blanden’s ‘A History of Australian Grand Prix 1928-1939’ which is below.\n\nThe three photographs above are the Waite car at the Island- that is the the prototype of the 1928 ‘Super Sports’ albeit fitted with a locally modified bonnet, then below it a standard ‘SS’ in order that you may compere the differences between the cars for yourselves- and a Super Sports engine.\n\nAt this point thanks are in order to racer/restorer/historian/authors Tony Johns and Bob King who have contributed all of the photographs in this article from their vast archives, and in Tony’s case an enormous amount of Austin 7 material and race experience.\n\nOf the latter engine photograph Johns observes, ‘The ‘Y-shaped’ inlet manifold is the same as mine (see a bit later on) designed to fit on long studs- look between the centre exhaust pipes and rear pipe. The photo illustrates the longer than standard valve springs to accommodate the 3/8 inch lift camshaft, as well as the location of the Pilgrim pump on the rear of the supercharger to lubricate the vanes- Vane type superchargers such as Shorrock need more lubrication than Roots type where their is no contact between revolving parts. The carburettor is a Cozette- this is a slightly later engine than Waite’s as it has the later inlet manifold designed for shorter studs to make for easier assembly.’\n\nBy the 1929 AGP Waite was back in the UK where he was appointed to the Austin Board of Directors.\n\nAmongst his new responsibilities Arthur took over the Austin racing team in 1930, competing along with ‘Freddie’ March and ‘Sammy’ Davis. In the Ards TT Waite was thrown from his Austin into the path of oncoming cars suffering a broken jaw and concussion- engine failures to all but one 7s in this race resulted in the crankcase being extended to below the level of the chassis- the end result was a ten-stud head which was a part of the ‘Ulster’ model specifications. Waite gave up his racing career after the Ards accident.\n\nBack in Australia the driving chores of the 1928 winner were handed to Clarrie May who had a run in the car in the lead up to the AGP at Aspendale Speedway in bayside Melbourne that January but the car failed to impress the ‘Sporting Globe’ writer, ‘Truto’ who commented that the Clarrie May driven car was one of the most disappointing of the meeting ‘It showed no ginger and is probably a temperamental piece of mechanism’- rather a harsh description of the AGP winner!\n\nEntered in Waite’s name for the 1929 AGP, decades later correspondence between Waite and John Blanden confirmed the car was owned by Austin Distributors Pty. Ltd. not Arthur individually.\n\nThe car ran very well as part of the lead bunch until suffering supercharger failure on lap 20 of the 31 lap race won by Arthur Terdich’s Bugatti T37A- he bagged the win in 1929 he in many ways deserved the year before.\n\nIn the 1930 AGP May again raced an, Austin, on this occasion an Ulster to a DNF after rolling the car- Bill Thompson won that year in a Bugatti T37A.\n\n1931 saw two supercharged Austin 7s entered driven by CR Dickason and CR May, again Clarrie reputedly racing the ex-Waite car, this year completing 18 of the 30 laps and retired, the best placed Austin 7 was Cyril Dickason’s superbly driven car which finished second outright in the handicap race.\n\nBill Thomson won again in 1932 with T37A, Clarrie May again ran an Austin 7 but it was a different machine to the year before and not as fast’, Blanden wrote that ‘Clarrie May was also in an Austin as usual. However it was being tipped that this car was not going to be as fast as the one he had driven the previous year’- in the event he was eighth, with Dickason again the best placed Austin 7 in third behind Thompson and the G Disher Salmson.\n\nIn his 1931 race piece in ‘A History of Australian Grand Prix 1928-1939’ Blanden ponders as to whether the car May raced in 1931 was the Waite car- Tony Johns confirms it was not and ‘all efforts to trace to whom the car was sold and its subsequent movements have been in vain’. John published his book in 1981, in 2020 the picture is clearer but still to an extent publicly untold.\n\nThe Austin 7 community in Australia are a tight-knit bunch, one of their ‘doyen’ is Tony Johns who will be known to many enthusiasts as an A7 racer, restorer, purveyor of fine books for many years and more recently an author- he and Phillip Schudmak together with Clare Hay and Bob Watson wrote and published ‘Vintage Bentleys in Australia’ about twelve months ago, do get a copy, its a great book, which i promised to review now i think of it…\n\nTony Johns picks up his Austin story and history, ‘Great Aunt in Brisbane owned an Austin 7 from new, and I would sit in the back seat whenever we were in Queensland for family holidays which usually involved a seaside holiday at Southport on the Gold Coast, quiet as it was in those days. As an aside Bill Pitt (the driver of the Geordie Anderson owned D Type Jaguar i have written about ), the service manager at Anderson Motors looked after both my Grandmother and Aunts motor cars.’\n\n‘This Austin was a 1931 tourer and as it was not Vintage, ie built before December 1930 I rejected the offer to inherit it when my Aunt passed away. However I did claim the original tool kit and still have the screw driver, pliers and grease gun that have n ever been used.’\n\n‘In 1960 I purchased a 1928 Chummy six months before I was eligible to get a driving licence and joined the Austin 7 Club. Not long after, I met Nigel Tait and we were both young and were soon elected to the committee. Nigel started racing a few years before me and I would act as his pit crew at Templestowe, Tarrawingee and in 1964 the South Australian Easter Collingrove Hillclimb and Mallala Races. By 1964 I had collected a modified chassis, and the body from Allan Tyrrell’s racing car- by Easter 1965 my first racing car was ready for the trip to Adelaide with the rest of the Victorian Austin 7 racers.’\n\n‘In 1973 and 1974 i lived in London and used some of that time to locate an Austin 7 Ulster- there were no complete running cars for sale so I ended up buying a restored rolling chassis and a new body. I shipped four of these Stuart Rolt built bodies back to Melbourne. Also in 1974 I was loaned Martin Eyre’s spare Austin to race in UK VSCC events in exchange for building engines, it was then that the challenge was made to prove that our Australian Austins were quicker than their cars- plans for the ‘1981 Raid’ of Australian Austin 7s in the UK were soon underway’ that story we will pick up in the next couple of months.\n\n‘I was as well connected as anyone in the Austin 7 world and knew the story that the Waite car remained stored at the back of the Austin Distributors building in South Melbourne for some years before it was sold- by then the later Ulster sportscars were faster machines.’\n\nBy the seventies the consensus was that the race winning car had been broken up so Victorian A7 man Bill Sheehan built a replica using the correct type of chassis and running gear with the body built with the assistance of Barry Papps.\n\nWhilst Johns was happily racing his 7 in 500 Car Club/A7 events and divisional racing then later still historic racing he was always on the lookout for A7 bits- especially competition parts.\n\n‘My longtime Meteor bodied Austin 7 friend from Sydney, Col Masterton, told me about the supercharged Waite crankcase. He approached the owner in the hope that i may be able to buy it for my unblown Ulster i purchased in pieces and shipped from the UK in 1974.’\n\n‘It was not for sale but the owner also had a 1930s Nippy sports Austin that was missing its crankcase and if i could find one he would do a swap- it was all stops out to locate a suitable crankcase from my UK contacts so that i could complete the deal.’\n\n‘When the crankcase arrived from England and on my next racing weekend in Sydney…i arranged with Colin to complete the swap. That Saturday morning, under a house not sure where in Sydney i saw the Ulster crankcase for the first time. Imagine my surprise and the look on face trying to stay calm when i realised it was a complete engine including the cast alloy inlet manifold and timing chest at the front of the crankcase. Even the steel gear that drives the supercharger was a special Works part that had one less tooth than the standard part in order to increase the supercharger revs- not just the crankcase that was to be the swap. Racing the Austin in Sydney that weekend became less important, i already had achieved the win of a lifetime.’\n\n‘The Waite motor was reunited with the replica Bill Sheehan constructed replica when it was owned by my friend, Graeme Steinfort- i had sold the eight stud Waite crankcase to Graeme in exchange for legal advice.’\n\n‘At the time Graeme was driving an un-supercharged Ulster he had purchased in the UK from former Lotus F1 driver John Miles. The four speed Waite gearbox was purchased by Graeme from another Melbourne Austin 7 enthusiast, Neil Johannesen’ so the replica at that stage had two of the critical original parts from the 1928 AGP winner.\n\n‘Sydney 1970s when i acquired the Waite engine, unfortunately the spare Blown crankcase was not part of the deal. Note the four bolts on the side face of the crankcase are there to mount the Cozette supercharger. Sydney A7 enthusiast Col Masterton is holding the very rare cast inlet manifold, this differed from later Ulster manifolds as it was designed for the long studs that were used at the time. Note the special 9C numbers that were cast into the non-standard competition parts.’\n\n‘Above is the Waite crankcase after I stripped and cleaned it- the special inlet manifold is clearly visible as well as the original supercharger driveshaft and coupling.’\n\n‘As to the casting numbers you can see, Mike Costigan checked with all the UK experts in relation to casting numbers on the side of the crankcase. The reply was that they were there for the factory to be able to check which foundry had made the castings in case of faults and are of no importance to us regarding Ulster or Super Sports part numbering.’\n\n‘The shot below shows the same inlet manifold, Cozette carburettor and supercharger fitted to my Ulster as above- the crankcase is now, again, as noted above, fitted to the Waite Replica.’\n\nAt this point a happy confluence of events occurred, Bob King (remember his ‘Werrangourt Archive’ articles on primotipo) had a next door neighbour at Blairgowrie on Melbourne’s Mornington Peninsula named Reg Sweet who just happened to have owned the Waite car in the late thirties.\n\n‘He was a great bloke, he made a mean home-brew and ensured the whole Blairgowrie experience was bearable. Fascinating too, he had flown as a pilot in Lancasters during the War including sorties over places like Cologne.’\n\nKing introduced Sweet to Graeme Steinfort on a Victorian Vintage and Sportscar Club run to Blairgowrie circa 1980, Graeme made typed notes after the meeting- i would scan them and pop them up but they will be too difficult to read hence this transcription in full.\n\n‘Apparently the car had remained in the hands of Austin Distributors in Melbourne for many years after the event (1928 AGP) and was gradually pushed into a corner of their workshop. Reg Sweet at that time was engaged in the motor trade mainly buying and selling Austin 7s, and thus had a lot to do with the people at Austin Distributors. He was onto them for a number of years to sell the car to him, but in those “pre-depreciation” days they said that it was on the books for 200 pounds!’\n\n‘He was called in to Austin Distributors one day in about 1934 and was told that they were clearing out all the old stock and was invited to make an offer on the Waite car if he wished. To this, he requested their suggestion as to what he should offer, and was told “60 pounds”, he offered that amount and acquired the car.’\n\n‘He recalls a lot about the car, the most significant feature which to him, apart from the number 4 Cozette supercharger, was the fact that it would rev quite easily to 7000 rpm in competition. It had the straight front axle and the body on it was quite similar to that constructed by Bill Sheehan (that Graeme owns).\n\n‘Reg proceeded to race the car at Aspendale Speedway (in bayside Melbourne) without success because the days of the Austin 7 in competition were really over, having been overshadowed by the MG P Types and Singer Le Mans which were then the current favourite for light car competition.’\n\n‘However he did have a success in his class at Rob Roy and until recently had a cup to prove it. That cup he donated to Bob King to give as a trophy for Brescia Bugattis at the Bi-Annual Bugatti Rally. Reg tells me he registered the car during this period and ran it without lights or mudguards, the registration authorities in those days being less stringent than they are today.’\n\n‘Basically, however, he used the car purely for competition disposing of it in about 1938 when the responsibilities of family and the like put an end to his sports motoring at the time. Reg managed to break the crankshaft and replaced it with one purchased from England for 13 pounds. The replacement crank came complete with new pistons, rings, gudgeon pins and rods- all fully prepared to go straight into the motor. He tells me the crankshaft was not an exact fit and he had to do some work on the case, grinding a proportion away to get the crankshaft to fit. Tony Johns reports that these grinding marks are present on the crankcase that he has on his engine.’\n\nGraeme Steinfort concludes an amazing document with the observation that ‘Naturally, Reg remembers the car with some affection and would like to have it back today! I think we join with him in that, and it would be nice to see the complete car in existence.’\n\nTony did some quick Rob Roy research and indeed Reginald Sweet won class 1, under 750cc, supercharged at Rob Roy Number 5, Cup Day November 1938 with a time of 41.66 seconds- he returned on 30 January 1939 and finished second in class to Derry George, MG J4 who did a 38.74 seconds.\n\nIf any of you can fill in the gaps between Reg Sweet’s sale of the Waite car circa 1938 and the acquisition of the car’s engine and gearbox by Messrs Johns and Steinfort in the seventies that would be wonderful, do get in touch.\n\nArthur Waite provides his best wishes to the Austin 7 ‘Raid’ racers prior to their trip to the UK in 1981.\n\nProminent Australian historian/racing journalist Ray Bell provided this shot below which his brother took in the UK in 1987- Ray wrote the 1928 chapter, and others, of ‘The 50 Year History of The Australian Grand Prix’, Bell’s copy of which Arthur is holding.\n\nRay dispatched his brother to meet with the old racer to sign the 1928 title page of his HAGP copy, when brother Brian knocked on the door and sought an audience, or arrived at the agreed time, the lady who answered the door enquired as to the reason for calling to which Brian responded ‘He won a car race in Australia a long time ago’ at which point the lady interrupted him by saying ‘Yes! And haven’t we all heard enough about that?’\n\nEtcetera…\n\nStan King Austin 7- unusual angle shows the tight packaging of mechanic and driver in the smaller cars- the pair completed the second race for Class A/C cars without a stop, one of few to do 100 miles without pitting.\n\nGood deed of the day award went to this crew who gave Arthur Terdich a lift on the rear of the car as the hapless Melburnian tried to find his Bugatti which had been coaxed back to life by the side of the road and driven back to the pits by his mechanic.\n\nJohn McCutcheon and friends before the off- the second placed and very quick Morris Cowley was never headed once into the lead of the morning’s Class B and D race.\n\nThe Pound DFP in profile- Les was third in Class B despite a number of tyre blowouts in the morning race, Bill Terdich in the other DFP was a DNF with a broken valve or piston.\n\nLight Car Club committee members at the Isle of Wight during the 1928 meeting. The fellow on the car side closest to the umbrella pole is Arthur Terdich, Tony believes- any clues on the other characters folks?\n\nArthur Terdich was in many ways the ‘man of the meeting’ having been up to his armpits in the organisation of the event as a LCC Committe member and one of the front runners in the race- he was stiff not to win it.\n\nHe returned to the Island many times of course and won in 1929 with a Grand Prix Type 37A Bugatti rather than the modified touring T40 machine he drove so well in 1928.\n\nTerdich was a critical force in Victorian racing for many years, I will circle back to him and have a crack at a profile about him with Bob and Tony’s assistance.\n\nIn the sensational photograph below Terdich (left) is plotting the path of the 1926 Alpine Trial, the car is his 3 litre Bentley chassis ‘602’, which was also the official course car during the event, somewhere in the Victorian high country.\n\nBill Williamson, aboard the Riley 9 owned by Mrs Jack Day.\n\nIt was a weekend of drama with a rollover in practice and a class B/D race of perseverance after transmission problems caused a pitstop- during which the problem was fixed, twelfth the result.\n\nBarney Dentry does look like a lean, mean fighting machine, despite the fag.\n\nSo many of these early racers were middle-aged given the readies required to compete, Barney is a veritable youth in comparison- car is a Senechal.\n\nA Valentine postcard of the Isle of Wight over a race weekend- not much to go on but cars and a date folks?\n\nGee-whizz, the Phillip Island Hotel looks decidedly low rent, I doubt any of the Light Car Club types stayed there.\n\nLes Jennings, Morris Cowley DNF after completing 6 laps- the car blew a cylinder head gasket.\n\nHis Lanes Motors supported machines were very well prepared with support from Lanes- and very well driven.\n\n‘Dunlop Grand Prix this way’- by this stage of the journey to Cowes the spectators would have been at fever pitch with excitement at the prospect of a spectacle few would have seen before- Terdich behind the wheel of the road roller?\n\nRon Gardner with a touch of the opposites, Alvis 12/50- DNF after completing 8 laps- big end bearing failure.\n\nThe John Goodall Aston Martin 1.5- Ed Huon the driver and Bob Horne the mechanic- Goodall retired the car with stripped gears having only completed a lap of the afternoon race.\n\nNot too many racing cars and drivers have been honoured with an Australian postage stamp- but the Waite Austin 7 s/c is one of them.\n\nThe Australia Post researchers got it right too- the other car featured is the ‘if only’ Bugatti T40 of Arthur Terdich.\n\nAs reported in period by ‘The Car’…\n\nThe Austin Distributors Pty.

He damaged his hand with its construction and still had issues with it in 1960.

Bob Carter wrote on OzBoatRacers that ‘The real story about the demise of Albert Park Lake (as a speed boating venue) has nothing to do with water depth.’\n\n‘I promoted the Aussie F1 Series for five years and ran a round on Albert Park Lake and what is now Docklands. I was closely involved with Melbourne Major Events (the people who run the GP F1 race and bikes at Phillip Island) to run a round of the F1 powerboat series in Melbourne at either Albert Park Lake or Docklands.’\n\n‘Docklands was really too small a venue so Albert Park Lake was the choice. The concept was to run at Albert Park in conjunction with the first F1 car race in Melbourne (in 1996).’\n\n‘We brought Nicolo di San Germano (world UIM (Union Internationale Motonautique) F1 promoter) to Melbourne to check the Albert Park venue and met the people from Major Events. We were on track from the Melbourne end but the deal fell over when the F1 car people said no to the boats as a support event. I understood they felt a bit threatened by the spectacle of the F1 boats. Never before has there been a World F1 car GP and a World F1 boat GP staged at the same venue on the same weekend’. How good would that have been on an ongoing basis!? And yes, i know, the pedestrian pontoon across ‘The Neck’ could not have been put in place, big deal.\n\nCarter finishes his piece in tapatalk.com by observing ‘The knockback ended any chance of ever running an F1 boat GP on Albert Park Lake. The Act of Parliament that underscores the GP at Albert Park specifies that there can only be one motorsport event in the Albert Park parkland precinct each year. This restriction was intended to prevent the venue becoming a motorsport track for cars and bikes and no doubt power boats.’\n\nThe signing of Albert Park as the host venue for the F1 Australian Grand Prix split both the motorsport community and Melburnians within a bulls-roar, or rather a Vee-Ten scream of Albert Park down the middle.\n\nWe all loved the Adelaide AGP. Full stop.\n\nThe Victoria Park venue, the road circuit created thereon using a mix of existing roads and bespoke bits, the carnival weekend with ‘yer mates away from the little sabre-toothed tigress and the kiddy-wids, the fantastic variety of support events, the way Big Country Town Adelaide embraced the F1 Circus. It was just sensational, no other word does it justice.\n\nBut the cost of the race, in a democracy at least, can be, and often is a political football.\n\nSouth Australian Labour Government (our progressive party) Premier John Bannon achieved a political coup when he secured Bernard Charles Ecclestone’s signature on a contract to stage an F1 race in Adelaide from 1985. Race fans were orgasmic with delight at finally having a world championship event here, the last truly F1-esque Tasman Series was run in 1969, it was a very long time since current F1 drivers and cars had raced in Australia.\n\nBannon ran an expansionary, imaginative administration, but, like Labour’s Victorian Premier John Cain, the push to make their State Banks more entrepreneurial was to their, and taxpayers considerable cost when the lack of sufficient oversight and due diligence of the enterprises investments meant the banks had to be re-capitalised or bailed out after unbelievable clusterfucks of political and management incompetence.\n\nBy mid 1992 Bannon was well and truly in the political merde to such an extent that he had to resign as Premier that September. In Victoria similar problems impacted both John Cain and his successor, Joan Kirner, and so the unthinkable seemed possible, Liberal (our conservative party) leader, Jeff Kennett, who had already lost two Victorian elections and was pretty much regarded as a bit of a joke, seemed half a chance in the next state poll.\n\nEcclestone and Bannon, apart from their business relationship also had good personal rapport, but South Australia’s budget problems meant the future contract to retain the AGP had still not been finalised.\n\nFormer Lord Mayor of Melbourne, partner in local builder/developer Hudson Conway, Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party, head of Melbourne Major Events, friend and ally of Jeff Kennett, Ron Walker, sniffed an opportunity. Bannon was marginalised in the sin-bin, so he renewed his regular onslaughts upon Bernie to shift the race from Adelaide to Melbourne, and so it was, over a period of months, a contract was negotiated and signed, and then kept secret for a year, at Bernie’s request.\n\nBy that time (from October 1992) Kennett was Premier of Victoria, a job he did brilliantly for two three year terms, only bulk hubris cost him another one or two terms, and his Liberal Party buddy, Dean Brown headed a government in South Australia. Ron Walker’s terrible ‘kiss of death’ the day after Brown’s election win on 14 December 1993 was to inform him the Vics had knocked off Adelaide’s tourism jewel in the crown; his devastation and that of South Australians generally was complete. Poor ‘ole Jeffrey was button-holed in the streets of Adelaide for decades by antsy South Australians, the fact that he was President of the Hawthorn Football Club didn’t help his cause of course!\n\nBoth South Australia’s and Victoria’s economies at the time were in dire trouble. The AGP was important economically but also symbolically to both states, whilst anger raged in South Australia about the loss of the Grand Prix even greater passion was being vented in Melbourne about its win.\n\nAmongst the best places to live in Melbourne are parts of South Melbourne, Albert Park and Middle Park. The trouble for Jeffrey was that the good citizens of these suburbs all vote for the Liberal Party, they were Jeff’s own supporters many of whom were well connected and rather vocal using about it. The poor bastard couldn’t go to a Dribble Party gig – the most dull, shit-boring gatherings on the planet mind you, having done my share in the cause of commerce – without being bailed up by some well nourished chappie in tan trousers and blue blazer whinging about that ‘bloody race in my park oulde boy’.\n\nEven angrier of course were the self-righteous left wing, arty-farty, commo, poofter bastard, tree-hugging whale kissers (to use a Sir Les Patterson descriptor in part) living in St Kilda, Prahran, Windsor and Port Melbourne. Jeffrey didn’t give a rats about this mob mind you as these nasty folks voted Labour, or even worse were the flower pot mob living in Pixie Land at the bottom of the garden, who, of course, voted Green.\n\nAnd so it was that the Save Albert Park (SAP) group was formed by February 1994 of a very large unholy alliance of people with absolutely nothing in common and completely opposite political views but who were united in their hatred of any change to their park including a race week which was going to impact upon the normal progress of their Mercedes four-wheel-drive or wheezy Peugeot 504 as the case may be, in and around their lovely bayside suburbs.\n\nSome of the SAP public rallies were anti-Vietnam War in size for chrissakes, the Save Albert Park nutbags endurance and commitment had to be admired though as they maintained a DAILY vigil with a couple of folks sitting at a table knitting Melbourne Footy Club scarves whilst sipping lots of Earl Grey tea surrounded by anti-GP posters near the corner of Queens Road and Albert Road for well over a decade after the race commenced.\n\nThe amazing thing is that despite the fairly dubious economic net benefits of the Gee Pee to the state, which even I struggle to justify, the race has bi-partisan support. Every now and again some pollie gives it a bit of a slap but the race, thankfully is with us and as a Windsor dwelling tree-hugging nuffy I am very thankful for that!\n\nThe park is a wonderful communal resource made better by Jeff’s investment in many improvements as part of the quid pro quo with the locals including regular harvesting of the reeds which otherwise cause sclerosis of da lake, said harvester is about where I came in with this strange piece of boats, cars and politics.\n\nDue process and managing the punters expectations…\n\nThe politics and management of nudging public opinion back in the direction of racing in the park started in February 1993 with the ‘Back To The Lake’ public event in which 250-300 ‘classic cars’ did some laps of a circuit created by roads on the west side of the lake- not the full ‘old circuit’ using perimeter roads mind you.\n\nI had an Elfin NG Formula Vee and ASP 340 Toyota Clubman at the time and ran the latter in this event about which I remember very little, other than that track time was minimal. It was a beautiful day which attracted lots of spectators and plenty of ‘wotizzit mister’ questions about one’s car which was nice.\n\nThe public policy or political point is that the gig wasn’t about the competitors but was rather an important step in the process carefully constructed by Melbourne Major Events with ‘Field Marshall Walker’ and his small band of Lieutenants at the helm heading in the direction of a prize – racing in Albert Park which was made slightly easier to achieve thanks to a confluence of political events in North Terrace and Spring Street.\n\nMore practically in this process, in mid 1994, the new government commissioned a ‘Master Plan for Albert Park’ from The Hassell Group (town planners and architects) and Melbourne Parks and Waterways, who had administrative responsibility for Albert Park as to it’s redevelopment in the future.\n\nIt would only be of interest to locals but shows the professionalism which was deployed to make the precinct a vastly superior community resource for all than it was before the hundred million dollars was spent.\n\nSydney. Where did you say? Really…\n\nEvery now and again the Sydney Morning Herald runs a story about the Harbour City lifting the race from Melbourne, but I’m not so sure that will ever happen.\n\nThese pissant GPs which have popped up in the last decade or so in places nobody has heard of or wants to visit has kept the price of having a GP very high. Perhaps in a post Covid 19 world some GPs will choose to not renew their contracts which may create, say again, may, create some competitive tension in Australia, and let’s not forget the good ‘ole Melbourne/Sydney rivalry which is never too far below the surface.\n\nThe last bit of nonsense about a Sydney GP speculated in 2015 about a race using the bridge, the Cahill Expressway and Bridge Street before jumping onto York Street and back across the bridge. I thought it was completely bonkers taking as it would, a big chunk of the track away from spectators, the bridge that is.\n\nBut, ever constructive and helpful, here is the best GP track on the planet. Walk it the next time you are in Sydney and tell me what you think. I lived in Millers Point for a decade from 2003 and this was my every other day early morning run route, it is a locals layout with backdrops which simply cannot be bettered.\n\nThe start of the race will on ‘The Hungry Mile’ on Hickson Road, a nice bit of local history as it is the place unemployed dock workers queued for a days work to load a ship during The Depression, hence ‘The Hungry Mile’ epithet.\n\nWe then have a straight run between the Barangaroo Parklands towards town on the right with the steep stone escarpment to the drivers left as they jostle for ‘Napoleons’ – a medium sharp left hander into Napoleon Street which rises gently straight for 100 metres to a tight left-hander at ‘Kents’.\n\nKent Street continues to rise gently as the drivers have tall apartment and office buildings on the left and open space on the right as they head north back towards the harbour, the road flattens as they pass Stamford Apartments on the left and Observatory Tower on the right.\n\nOn the approach to Observatory Hill Park on the high escarpment to the right the cars pass The Rocks Fire Station on the right and my old apartment building ‘Highgate’ on the left before doing a sharp left- and then right into High Street before heading downhill gently and up the other side again- this stretch is open to the drivers left with Barangaroo below and has Harbour Trust housing on the right side of the street- this stretch is about 400 metres long before turning right into Argyle Street for a 1 km run past the Lord Nelson on the left and again Observatory Hill park on the right towards Circular Quay in the distance.\n\nThis section of the track is very open – there is heaps of space for spectators and stands to the left and natural vantage points from Observatory Hill down to the track – with the Hero of Waterloo an easy stroll for a quick ale, it’s one of Sydney’s oldest pubs.\n\nArgyle Place is straight and flat for the first 500 metres and starts to drop gently downhill towards Circular Quay at Cumberland Street- the sound of the cars going through The Argyle Cut will be unbelievable – now we are in the heart of The Rocks, braking hard and going gently downhill to turn left into George Street. The drivers will have a glimpse of the blue-green Quay waters and a Manly Ferry perhaps, after the left the road is straight for 500 metres before jinking right onto Hickson Road and then what will be a very fast open right-hander parallel with Campbells Cove – there are heaps of ‘money shots’ along this stretch – across to the Opera House, Bridge and North Sydney.\n\nThe road then sweeps open left, fast past Dawes Point itself and then runs along close to and parallel with the Harbour before turning left at Pier One. There is a hotel on the right and heaps of open space to the left for spectators and high above on the escarpment from the bottom of Lower Fort Street looking down. Plum, stunning viewing actually, my seat might be somewhere here.\n\nThe drivers are now onto the last third of the track, which comprises a 500 metre straight, opening to a flat gentle right past the Walsh Bay wharves on the right and the Hickson Road eateries and Sydney Theatre Company on the left before a medium fast left at the Towns Place intersection – we are still on Hickson Road – and then a fast blast through the short tunnel with the Palisade Hotel high above us and then 500 metres before hitting the start finish line and commencing another lap.\n\nWalk it folks and then let me know if that isn’t potentially the best city road circuit on the planet. Ok then second best after Monaco.\n\nMark Webber’s Williams FW26B BMW during its 2005 Sydney Harbour Bridge runs the week before the AGP. https://primotipo.com/2015/08/29/mark-webbers-sydney-harbour-bridge/\n\nEtcetera…\n\nCirca 1970’ish i guess with the Arts Centre spire in St Kilda Road in the background- the water never looks that blue to me.\n\nOne for you many aircraft nutters.\n\nRAAF Westland Wapitis from Point Cook, site of the 1948 AGP BTW- formation flying over Albert Park Lake circa 1930- planes used for, amongst other things Forests Commission of Victoria, aerial bushfire reconnaissance.\n\nVilleneuve from Hill in 1996- exit of Pit Straight and beyond- didn’t he take to GP racing from Indycars in a way i wished Michael Andretti had done so a few years before- the BAR era took him backwards didn’t it.\n\nJaney in trouble trying to do a three point turn during the November 1958 meeting.

Hunting and fishing, they caught eels and fish in conical shaped nets watched by over 130 different species of water birds including ducks, swans, grebe, coot, cormorants as well as possums, bats and reptiles.\n\nThe area to the south of what became known as the Yarra River, its low sides skirted with marshes covered with luxuriant reeds, wild grass and herbage comprised a series of brackish lagoons and low lying marsh formed by the flow of the Yarra to the Bay near St Kilda. Early settlers reported on the area’s beauty and abundance of wildlife.\n\nEmerald Hill ‘a gum and wattle tree forest’ was the name given to the high point of the land in South Melbourne. Some early geographers queried whether the Yarra was really a river and characterised it as a tract of marsh or swamp drawing a parallel with the fens of Lincolnshire which were drained, a model that ‘the Yarra and other Melbourne wetlands were doomed to follow.’\n\nWhat was known as the South Melbourne Swamp was low lying land around Emerald Hill which was formed into Albert Park Lake during the 1930s Great Depression years. In so doing the marsh was drained and built over for domestic housing, the only reminder of the area as it was before European settlement is Albert Park Lake.\n\nThe Park originally extended to St Kilda Road, but the land was sold in 1874, the St Kilda Cricket Club was the first of many sporting clubs to be given permission to use the land, the Junction Oval is well known to Melburnians.\n\nThe Lake itself is about two kilometres long north to south and about one kilometre wide, the site was permanently reserved as a park of 230 hectares in honour of Queen Victoria’s Prince Consort in 1876\n\nBibliography…\n\nBob Carter on tapatalk.com, ‘Lost and Found Wetlands of Melbourne’ Rod Giblett\n\nIllustration and Photo Credits…\n\nThe Illustrated Australian News July 1879, Les Maloney Photo Collection, Australian Grand Prix Corporation, John Lamb, Jack Atley, Herald Sun, Parks Victoria, Jason South, Tony Johns Collection\n\nTailpiece: Albert Park Lake, 1893…\n\nFinito…\n\nBeautiful Peter D’Abbs photograph of Lex Davison’s Aston Martin DBR4/250, chassis #1 3-litre with Austin Miller, Cooper T51 Climax in the background, Phillip Island, 23 October 1960…\n\nLex became famous for his retirements from racing and Dame Nellie Melba type returns to the grid. His 1958 AGP win at Bathurst was the final time he raced the marvellous ex-Ascari/Gaze Ferrari 500/625. He took a break from racing, but heading into 1960 he planned to take a holiday in Europe with his wife Diana, and to acquire a new racer.\n\nHe had watched the ‘Cooperisation’ of Australian racing from the sidelines and decided that a modern incarnation of his (ex-Moss 1954 AGP winning) HWM Jaguar would be competitive with the growing number of mid-engined cars.\n\nLex pitched the idea of a DB4 3.7-litre engine fitted to a DBR4 GP chassis to Aston Martin Racing Manager John Wyer. Wyer assured him the motor wouldn’t readily fit and that the David Brown five-speed transaxle, already marginal, would be pushed beyond its limits.\n\nAfter plenty of argy-bargy Lex did a deal to buy DBR4 chassis #1 fitted with a 3-litre DBR1 sportscar engine, and a DB4GT road car. A rather nice combination of roadie and racer!\n\nAfter the cars rebuild in March 1960 it was tested at Goodwood by Jack Fairman, and Roy Salvadori over two days before shipment to Port Melbourne. Davison drove the car on the second of the days to within a fraction of a second of Fairman’s best.\n\nChassis 1, unsurprisengly the first of the DBR4s built, was raced by Salvadori during the 1959 and four times in 1960.\n\nAfter an initial test session with Allan Ashton and the AF Hollins crew at Phillip Island Lex raced it to THAT missed-a-win-by-a-bees-dick Australian Grand Prix at Lowood on 12 June. There, Alec Mildren’s Cooper T51 Maserati led Davo home by an official margin of one half of a second after a little over an hour of Grand Prix motor racing of the first order- click here for a feature on Mildren inclusive of a full race report on the AGP; https://primotipo.com/2018/06/08/mildrens-unfair-advantage/\n\nLex and the boys made the long trip back to Queensland in September and ran again at Lowood in another Gold Star round for third place behind Alec and Bib Stillwell, both T51 mounted, then at the non-championship meeting at Phillip Island in October. Davo then raced in the soggy Warwick Farm opening meeting on 18 December where he was fourth behind the T51s of Stillwell, John Youl and Austin Miller having started from the front row.\n\nFamously these Aston Martins were at least two years late to be competitive in Grand Prix racing. Honours as the successful front-engined GP cars go to the Ferrari Dino 246 and Vanwall, winners of the 1958 drivers and manufacturers respectively. While handing out gongs, perhaps the most sophisticated front-engined GP car was the Lotus 16 Climax, if not the most reliable.\n\nTwo of the magnificent Aston Martins came to Australia in 1960. Davison’s ‘DBR4/250 (1) and Bib Stillwell’s ‘DBR4/250 (3)’.\n\nUnlike Lex, Bib had an each way bet, his Kew, Melbourne Holden dealership was spitting out wads of cash so he had a Cooper or three in his garages as well as the Feltham beastie. Lex’ eggs were in one basket, until he borrowed one of Stillwell’s Cooper T51s and nicked the 1961 AGP at Mallala, South Australia from under the noses of the established water-cooled Cooper aces.\n\nI say that as Lex had been winning races and hillclimbs in two Phil Irving fettled Vincent engined Coopers for years, he was hardly unfamiliar with the handling characteristics of these small, light mid-engined missiles.\n\nInto 1961 Lex raced the Aston in the late January Warwick Farm 100- Q11 and DNF oil leak, the race was won by the Walker/Moss Lotus 18 Climax. Davison then contested the Victorian Trophy at Ballarat Airfield on 12 February- the colour photo taken above by Phillip Skelton at that meeting could almost be a BP PR shot!\n\nThis time the car was out after completing nine laps with gearbox dramas, the hot and dusty race was won by Dan Gurney from Graham Hill in BRM P48s. It was the only international win for these cars.\n\nThree weeks later, Davison and Stillwell took the cars to Longford. While Bib practiced the Aston he raced his Cooper whereas Davo raced to the finish of the 24 lap 100 miler, finishing in fifth behind Roy Salvadori, Bill Patterson, John Youl and Austin Miller in 2.2-litre and 2.5-litre Coventry Climax engined Cooper T51s.\n\nAfter Longford Lex shipped the car back to the UK. It needed a major rebuild as “the chassis was breaking up” wrote Graham Howard. The AF Hollins crew had repaired chassis tubes and added strengthening gussets to the machine in their Armadale, Melbourne workshop between the Ballarat and Longford meetings.\n\nLex’ plan was to race an Aston Martin at Le Mans and contest a number of Intercontinental Formula races in 196. In the event, after ongoing discussions with John Wyer, Aston Martin provided Davison a later chassis, “the sister car to Stillwell’s later model DBR4”, chassis 4 which was built but unraced in 1959, for Lex to use at Silverstone in July and Brands Hatch in August.\n\nIt was equipped, as was chassis 1 with a five speed Maserati transaxle instead of the heavy, recalcitrant David Brown unit, the latest cylinder head design which had valves arranged at an included angle of 80 degrees rather than the earlier variants 95 degrees. In 3-litre form it was good for circa 296bhp @ 6,700rpm, a good deal more mumbo than the 230 or so bhp of an FPF 2.5, but of course the chassis was no svelte nymph.\n\nThis article tells a bit of Bib and Lex’ 1961 European Adventures; https://primotipo.com/2015/09/22/aston-martin-db4gt-zagato-2vev-lex-davison-and-bib-stillwell/\n\nDavo above having his first race in the second Aston DBR4/250-4 3-litre at Silverstone during the July 8 1961 British Empire Trophy Intercontinental Formula race. DNF gearbox quill-shaft after 17 laps, up front after 245km was Moss and Surtees in Cooper T53 Climaxes.\n\nDavison had a busy weekend as he also contested the GT race in John Ogier’s Aston Martin DB4GT, “a bit of an old nail” and finished third behind the Ferrari 250 GTs of Stirling Moss and Graham Whitehead.\n\nThe Australian’s DBR4 drive received good press coverage, but Graham Howard wrote that it added to confusion for later historians as to which car Davo raced. The Motor described the machine as an ex-works DBR4 Grand Prix car fitted with a much modified 3-litre sportscar engine, while Autosport added to the confusion by noting that “a new chassis was fitted.”\n\nAston Martin themselves didn’t help either. In a late 1961 letter to Lex about a variety of things including shipment of the car to Australia, Wyer advised “the Aston had now been shipped, although there had been a mix-up with chassis numbers and it had been stamped DBR4-1 rather than DBR4-4”.\n\nTo be clear on this point, Graham Howard makes no comment about the chassis number of Lex’ first Aston, nor does Doug Nye, while Anthony Pritchard – his book was published later – says that the car is generally accepted to be DBR4-1. John Blanden in the second edition of his book simply lists one car and applies two chassis numbers to the “one entity”.\n\nThe correct position seems to be that the two cars were quite separate. Lex raced DBR4-1 in Australia, returned it to Feltham in early 1961, then raced DBR4-4 (the unused 1959 built chassis) in the UK and then later in Australia. The chassis, body and engine were different, built to a later spec. Whether the Maserati gearbox and other componentry fitted to chassis 1, which was interchangeable, was carried over to #4, who knows.\n\nWhat is clear is that Lex was unhappy with his new car after Silverstone, Autosport quoted Lex as saying its “handling was nothing like the original car.”\n\nA month later Davison contested his second and last Intercontinental race, the Guards Trophy at Brands Hatch on 7 August. This time, in dry, sunny conditions he brought the “new dinosaur” home in sixth place, ‘bruising’ the nose of the car; up front, four laps up the road in fact, Jack Brabham headed Jim Clark home in Cooper T53 Climax and Lotus 18 Climax respectively.\n\nA week or so after Brands the family headed home to Australia with the Aston Martin left behind at the factory for further work. This included repair of the panel damage sustained at the Kent circuit and to fit 12.5:1 pistons to suit the alcohol based fuel Lex used in Australia.\n\nHoward reports that Davison was still unhappy with the handling of the car. He quotes from a letter written by Lex to Brian Josceleyne of the Aston Martin Owners Club, “My Grand Prix car is still at the works, where they are endeavouring to sort out some of the handling bugs, for the new chassis proved rather twitchy, unlike my earlier one which was a superb handling car and could be thrown about in a rather flippant way.”\n\nDavo returned home via America including Hawaii, in time to win the AGP in South Australia on 9 October in one of Stillwell’s Cooper T51s. It was a car he rented from Bib after it became clear the DBR4 wouldn’t arrive in Australia on time for the race, that story is here; https://primotipo.com/2018/03/29/the-naughty-corner-renta-gp-winner/\n\nThere was still life in the old design though, Davison raced the Aston Martin to second place in the Victorian Trophy at Calder behind Stillwell’s Cooper T53 Climax in late February 1962. Not too far from home, at Sandown’s opening meeting he contested the Sandown Park International on 12 March where he was eighth behind a swag of Climax engined Coopers and Lotuses as well as the Chuck Daigh driven Scarab RE Buick 3.8-litre V8, it too was a mid-engined machine.\n\nBy that stage Lex had got-with-the-strength and was racing a Cooper T53 Lowline which famously met its maker in a huge accident at Longford on March 4. A gust of wind caught the car while airborne on the hump in the road before the Longford pub, it was a very lucky escape. The Yeoman Credit Cooper was geared for 170mph @ 6,700rpm that weekend, Davison described the accident, raconteur as he was, to John Wyer in one of the many letters they exchanged.\n\n“I was managing to lap at 110 to 112 mph, some three seconds faster than Brabham’s lap record of the year before, when I became airborne over a hump some 200 yards prior to a 90-degree corner in the middle of a little town. A gust of wind caught me and I landed in a drain beside the road. I motored along this at some 140 mph causing some uneasiness to the police, radio announcers, officials, television cameramen and various others cluttering up the entrance to the escape road. I regained the road again but the heavy rear-engined end slid in the gravel and I shot down the road sideways. I hit a tree with the nose, which plucked everything forward of the soles of my feet off the car and spun the car around in the process. It then shot along a hotel wall at window height, demolishing the floral display, pot plants etc, then a 360 degree spin around the entrance porch of the hotel and back up the wall again. The car then fell off the hotel wall and back into the road and shot across the road backwards into a grain mill. I shook what was left from me and went back into the pub and ordered a brandy. They even made me pay for it, which was the cruelest blow of all.”\n\nAfter the international visitors returned home Lex ran the Aston at Sandown in May 1962, winning a race for front engined racing cars. He didn’t run it again until February 1963 when he gave it a gallop at Calder, in part to demonstrate it to potential purchasers. In the process he provided five thrilling laps for spectators in a three car match race with Bryan Thomson’s supercharged Cooper T51 Climax and Frank Matich’s new, works, Elfin Catalina Ford pushrod 1.5.\n\nThe Aston Martin was advertised for sale in Australian Motor Sports during 1962 and was soon acquired by garage proprietor and Calder Raceway part owner, Pat Hawthorn. He is photographed above proudly showing off his new acquisition at his Clayleigh Service Station in Clayton, not too far at all from Sandown where, by March 1963, he was mixing it with the heavies in the Sandown Park International.\n\nHawthorn raced the car through until 1966 in Victoria and South Australia. Perhaps the last championship points the car scored were in the 14 October 1963 Advertiser Trophy, Mallala Gold Star round. There he was fourth among the mid-engined hordes, behind the Cooper T55 of John Youl, Bib Stillwell’s Brabham BT4 and Wally Mitchell’s MRD (aka Brabham BT1) Ford Formula Junior.\n\nPat sold the car to UK historic racer Neil Corner in 1966, there he was a consistent race winner, the Calder Raceway signed Rice Trailer cut quite a dash on UK Motorways! DBR4-4 of course still exists.\n\nChassis numbers and development of the Aston Martin GP cars in summary…\n\nMy standard reference for all things chassis numbers is Allen Brown’s great site, oldracingcars.com (ORC). I say great in the sense that most of the standard texts were written in the pre-internet days before it was possible to debate the merits of ‘what is what’ and ‘which is which’ amongst knowledgeable enthusiasts to land on generally agreed positions based on facts which have been often vigorously debated.\n\nUsing ‘Howard’ (see bibliography) published in 2004, ‘Nye’ in 1993, ‘Blanden’ in 2004, ‘Pritchard’ in 2006 and ‘ORC’ as my source material the Aston Martin Grand Prix cars built are as follows and their destiny, I think and hope is as follows…\n\n1. DP155 and the DBR4/250\n\nAston’s first toe in the water GP exercise was the DB3S based DP155 I wrote about a while ago. Its most significant racing was with Reg Parnell at the wheel during the 1956 New Zealand Internationals, click here; https://primotipo.com/2019/09/05/the-gp-aston-martin-dp155/\n\n‘Its bones’ were converted back into a DB3S albeit there is a car doing the rounds in the UK ‘sorta in the style’ of DP155. It has none of the original car’s core componentry.\n\nGetting more serious, in the summer of 1956 – at the same time they started development of the DBR1 – Aston Martin’s engineers commenced the design of the DBR4/250 GP car.\n\nThe spaceframe chassis was fitted with a short-stroke version of their 3-litre sportscar RB6 engine. This 2493cc DOHC, two valve, 50DCO Weber fed engine produced 250bhp @ 7,800rpm on the Avgas which was mandatory from 1958.\n\nThe design was period typical in having upper and lower wishbone suspension at the front, with torsion bars and co-axial shock absorbers, and De Dion rear suspension with torsion bars again the springing medium. The axle was located by a Watts linkage and radius rods. Armstrong provided the shocks front and rear.\n\nA transaxle was used at the rear – the unpopular with drivers – David Brown CG537 five-speeder. Girling provided the brakes, Borrani the wire wheels. Initially Morris Minor rack and pinion steering was used, later the DB4 rack and pinion was adopted.\n\n2. DBR4/250 chassis number 1\n\n‘This prototype’ was built in time for testing by Reg Parnell and Roy Salvadori at MIRA in December 1957. It was further testing again there in February 1958 before being put to one side as sportscar racing was prioritised.\n\nStirling Moss won the Argentinian GP in a Rob Walker Cooper T45 Climax in early 1958. Time was of the essence with the DBR4/250. The oh-so-sexy-beast, was, in effect obsolete by the time of its launch in April 1959.\n\nBy then the car was fitted with modified DB4GT coil and wishbone front suspension which was more practical than the torsion bar arrangement, but was 15 pounds heavier – in a car which was already a pork-chop.\n\nSalvadori’s second place in the BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone flattered to deceive. Initial problems were an engine at the wrong end of the car (cheap shot), too much weight, and, most critically engine bearing lubrication issues which meant revs had to be kept down to an uncompetitive level.\n\nAston Martin won at Le Mans in 1959, Salvadori and Carroll Shelby took a splendid win in the DBR1. Poised to win the World Sportscar Championship, the F1 program, rightfully, took second place in the allocation of scarce corporate resources.\n\nIn the winter of 1959/1960 chassis 1 and 2 were modified. After surgery they were two inches slimmer and some 55lb lighter. ‘”Merely replacing Brown’s own heavy and baulky CG537 transaxle with one from Maserati (Type 5M-60) saved 50lb. The Aston gearchange, reliable, but heavy and slow – tolerable in a sportscar, was out of place in Formula 1″ Doug Nye wrote.\n\nAfter negotiations between Davison and Wyer DBR4 1 was fitted with engine number RB6/300/1 from sportscar chassis DBR1-1 and shipped to Australia, John Blanden wrote.\n\nDBR4 1 was returned to the UK by Davison in early 1961 and was eventually bought by Neil Corner, to use as a spare for his DBR4-4 he ran in historic racing with chassis 1 built into a complete car by Geoffrey Marsh in the early eighties.\n\n3. DBR4/250-2\n\nWas Carroll Shelby’s chassis in 1959, and like #1 contested only the Dutch, British and Portuguese GPs that year. 1959/1960 winter modifications as above. DBR4-2 was scrapped.\n\n4. DBR4/250-3\n\nThis car was lighter than the first two built by virtue of a stressed skin body centre section, one piece De Dion tube and lighter Maserati gearbox. Its race debut was at Monza in September 1959.\n\nSalvadori retired it while running sixth, Moss won in a Rob Walker Cooper T51 Climax. Front engined Ferrari 246 and BRM P25s filled six of the top eight places so a good front-engined machine could still do well, on fast circuits at least!\n\nStillwell bought the car on a bit of a whim, frustrated as he was by not being able to buy a 2.5-litre Coventry Climax FPF engine for his Cooper T51 at the time. The motors were in short supply, allocation preference was to the works favoured or contracted Cooper, Walker and Lotus teams.\n\nIn the event, no sooner had Bib committed to the Aston Martin, he was able to buy the Cooper T51 Jack Brabham raced in Australia that year…fitted with a 2.5-litre FPF.\n\nIn fact the Kew, Melbourne Holden Dealer had possibly fallen out of love with the Aston before its arrival in Australia. Bib raced his new 2.5-litre T51 to first at Port Wakefield in October, then second at Caversham, and third at Phillip Island on consecutive December weekends. He topped off his late season form by winning the (non Gold Star) Warwick Farm Trophy on 18 December, back in fourth place was Lex’ DBR4 surrounded by a sea of Cooper T45/51s.\n\nFitted with 3-litre RB6/300/7 sportscar engine, DBR4/250-3 arrived in Australia in late 1960 and was almost immediately shipped to New Zealand to contest the NZ GP at Ardmore, Auckland in early January 1961. He placed fifth in a heat and was classified twelfth in the GP, Jack Brabham won in a Cooper T53 Climax.\n\nBack In Australia, he practiced the car for the Warwick Farm 100 in late January but didn’t race it. Running the T51, he finished third behind the Moss and Innes Ireland Lotus 18 Climaxes. Bib’s crew then took the car across Bass Straight to Longford in early March, Bib practiced it, but the engine burned a piston so he raced his Cooper T51, retiring with plug problems in the Longford Trophy won by Roy Salvadori’s Ecurie Vitesse (Jack Brabham) Cooper T51 Climax.\n\nBib continued to race his T51 but returned with the Aston Martin to Warwick Farm in May. He won the (non Gold Star) 10 lap Racing Car Scratch from Alec Mildren’s Cooper T51 Maserati 2.9 and Noel Hall’s Cooper T51 Climax 2.2. Was this the only race win of a DBR4 in-period anywhere?\n\nAnd that was it. Bib displayed the car at Jim Abbott’s Melbourne Racing Car show in August before racing it again in the 1962 NZ GP, doubtless, given his flotilla of Coopers, with a view to selling the car in New Zealand. He was tenth in the sopping wet race won by Stirling Moss – having qualified seventh – inclusive of a mid race plug-change.\n\nBay of Islands driver Lionel Bulcraig acquired the car after the race, running it in NZ through to 1965, his time in the car is covered here; https://primotipo.com/2019/09/02/waimates-aston-martin-dbr4-250/\n\nBulcraig advertised it in Car and Driver, the American international magazine, in late 1965. It was acquired by Peter Brewer who dominated Historic Racing in the UK in the late sixties with it. Bought by Tom Wheatcroft’s Donington Collection in 1970, it was “a collection of horrible bits”, as Doug Nye described it, for restoration to original 1959 specifications.\n\n5. DBR4/250-4\n\nThis chassis built at the same time as #3 but was unraced in F1 in 1959 and 1960.\n\nAfter DBR4-1 was returned by Davison to Feltham in early 1961, DBR4-4 was built to ultimate spec; De Dion rear, Maserati gearbox, 80 degree cylinder head and magnesium alloy block RB6/300 engine specifications for use in the Intercontinental Formula in the UK. Then limited use in Australia before its sale to Pat Hawthorn in early 1963.\n\nLater to Neil Corner in 1966, who also acquired DBR4-1 which was eventually built up as an historic car.\n\nCars 6. and 7. DBR5/250-1 and 2- sometimes also referred to as DP201\n\nFor 1960 Aston Martin designed a new car – still front engined mind you – the DBR5/250 was 3 inches shorter than the DBR4 with a wheelbase of 7 ft 3 inches and used torsion bar independent front suspension.\n\nTwo cars were laid down, DBR5/250-1 which was built with a De Dion rear and chassis 2 which was fitted with independent rear suspension by torsion bars.\n\nBoth DBR5s were scrapped after unsuccessful performances in the International Trophy, at Zandvoort and in the British GP.\n\nDoug Nye wrote that “The new rear end merely made the cars handle worse, so following the British GP, David Brown wisely withdrew his team from the dying Formula”,- the 2.5-litre F1 ended on 31 December 1960.\n\nIn summary, Aston Martin built seven Grand Prix cars; one DP155, four DBR4s and two DBR5s with three now extant – DBR4 1, 3 and 4.\n\nAnthony Pritchard wrote that “By this time (Zandvoort) Aston Martin realised the hopelessness of their position.”\n\nTeam Manager Reg Parnell asked Stirling Moss to try the car, the best that he could manage was a 1:40 compared to 1:33.2 in his Lotus 18 Climax. Trying his very hardest, Salvadori achieved 1:37 seconds.\n\nEtcetera…\n\nAfter publication Lotus historian and author Michael Oliver got in touch and sent these two marvellous shots of Lex during the Brands Hatch Guards Trophy meeting taken by his father, and his dad’s mate, below.\n\nWhilst Lex damaged the nose of the car during practice he also knocked off the right-front corner of the Aston. The shot captures the damage and is a rare colour image of the suspension.\n\nEcurie Australie at Longford in 1961.\n\nPhoto Credits…\n\nPeter D’Abbs via Mark Ellery Collection, Pat Hawthorn Collection via Russell Hawthorn, Phillip Skelton via the Tony Johns Collection, Getty Images, Ron Lambert, oldracephotos.com.au/JSaward, Peter Coleby Collection, Tony Selfe, David Friedman Collection, LAT, E Stevens, Brier Thomas, Hall & Hall, TC March, conceptbunny.com, Michael Oliver Collection, Kim Harley\n\nBibliography…\n\n‘Lex Davison: Larger Than Life’ Graham Howard, ‘History of The Grand Prix Car 1945-65’ Doug Nye, ‘Aston Martin: A Racing History’ Anthony Pritchard, ‘Historic Racing Cars in Australia’ John Blanden, oldracingcars.com\n\nTailpieces…\n\nThe opening shot of Lex again but cropped a tad tighter to focus that little bit more on the car- DBR4/250-1.
