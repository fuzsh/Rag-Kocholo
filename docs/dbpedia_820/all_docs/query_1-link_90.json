        "text": "4.1 Detrimental impacts of mining on biodiversity\n\n4.1.1 Impacts related to mining operational activities\n\nUndoubtedly, mining plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth and enhancing living standards [2, 16, 26, 35]. However, it often results in severe land degradation, with major implications for ecosystems [11, 27, 38]. The review highlights the mining operation with potential impacts on biodiversity in many African countries (Fig. 3). Activities such as vegetation clearance, land degradation, habitat fragmentation, pollution, release of metallic substances, and changes to the hydrological cycle are mostly reported. These processes alter natural landscapes and facilitate the invasion of invasive species, posing serious threats to biodiversity [6, 39]. Mining operations also lead to significant deposition of metals, disrupting the natural biogeochemical cycle and posing considerable threats to biodiversity [2, 40]. Similarly, activities such as the burning of explosives and amalgam, the smelting of pyrite, and the processing of mineral ores have profound impacts on ecosystem sustainability [11]. Furthermore, blasting, excavation, pit digging, trenching, dredging, panning, drilling, and shoveling [2, 41] are closely associated with extensive habitat fragmentation. These actions carry a high potential for metal contamination [42] posing greater environmental risks compared to natural sources [20].\n\nSimilarly, excavation methods like shaft and open-cast mining lead to significant vegetation loss and the potential disappearance of native plant species [2]. Meanwhile, drilling, blasting, and shoveling in deep mines such as those for Tanzanite in Tanzania release substantial amounts of poisonous gases, significantly polluting the environment [41]. The extraction and processing of metals from their ores vary considerably, involving multiple steps dependent on ore type, metal reactivity, and impurity composition [26, 34]. For example, the production of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals involves substantial landscape destruction, releasing large quantities of toxic substances into the environment [26]. During the mining process, the ores of most metals are brought to the Earth’s surface, often with varying degrees of adverse environmental impact. A comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity by Murguía et al. [17] concluded that mining operations stand as the primary drivers of biodiversity depletion. The impacts of mining, particularly in ecologically sensitive and protected areas, are now receiving widespread global attention [39]. In Central Africa, Edwards et al. [3] documented significant deposits of major metals (ranging from 3.8 to 10.3%) within protected areas, with profound implications for the health of surrounding ecosystems. In their work on “Mining and the African Environment,” Edwards et al. [3] warned that without careful management, the rapid expansion of mining and its associated secondary effects would inflict severe impacts on African biodiversity.\n\nSimilarly, Wassenaar et al. [43], in their study on “Ensuring the Future of Namib's Biodiversity,” emphasized the destruction of habitats and ecological processes due to the high demand for Uranium, resulting in the loss of ecosystem services and significant biological diversity. Chibunda et al. [44] reported on the effects of gold mining on Chironomus riparius in the Mabubi River (Tanzania), suggesting adverse impacts on C. riparius and potentially other fauna. Kitula [45], in Geita (Tanzania), documented unpredictable river diversions, landscape degradation, deforestation, destruction of aquatic habitats, and widespread contamination by metallic pollutants as negative impacts of mining. Palacios-Torres et al. [25] observed substantial and illicit dumping of mine wastes, leading to environmental health concerns, including significant damage to water sources and natural vegetation. Haule et al. [46] reported extensive deforestation and land degradation resulting from limestone mining in Usongwe (Tanzania), with 38.3 hectares of forests cleared, leading to unpredictable soil erosion and vegetation loss. David et al. [47] and Gbedzi et al. [48] noted a double decrease in forest cover due to mining activities. A review by Mensah et al. [49], utilizing observations and in-depth interviews with communities and government officials around mining areas, documented landscape transformations, rendering land barren, soil erosion, and loss of viable species, along with alterations to hydrological regimes. Oke & Ibhanesebhor [50] observed that excavation altered landforms in southwestern Nigeria, creating opportunities for invasive species like Pinus caribaea and Typha australis, endangering the original vegetation. Adesipo et al. [13] observed the introduction of non-native plant species (e.g., Capsicum frutescens, Crassocephalum crepidioides, Adenia venenata, and Grewia flavescens), outweighing native species.\n\nWhile pollutants released into the environment undergo a natural degradation process [30], the pollution levels stemming from mining operations yield significant negative ecological impacts. Depending on the quality of ores, mining methods can be either pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical, conducted underground or on the surface, each potentially contributing to environmental pollution [6]. These methods are characterized by vegetation destruction, topsoil removal, extensive vegetation clearance, and the generation of substantial amounts of waste [34]. Mining operations release various types of waste with significant and potentially long-lasting impacts [7, 26, 51], posing serious and highly specific threats to biodiversity and resulting in its loss. Mining activities substantially increase contaminant levels [52], with mining-induced explosions being particularly significant contributors to environmental toxification [25]. The extraction process, involving underground excavation and rock destruction, has caused extensive land degradation. Uncontrolled digging and pit abandonment have further exacerbated land destruction, with adverse impacts on wildlife resources beyond technical recovery [2]. The toxicity of heavy metals poses a significant threat to biological species, even at low concentrations [30].\n\nSimilarly, Devenish et al. [53] observed the most significant deforestation resulting from mining operations in the Madagascar forests. The study employed various methods, including extensive robustness, to predict the effects of mining in Madagascar forests. They noted a drastic reduction in tree and shrub populations within buffer zones, with significantly lower densities in mined areas compared to unmined ones. This observation underscores the adverse impacts of mining. Additionally, Muhire et al. [2] revealed higher concentrations of metals and metalloids exceeding international standards in a protected reserve in Rwanda. Thus, mining activities pose threats to aquatic and terrestrial life to the point of extinction, with wildlife reported to migrate due to toxicity. Venkateswarlu et al. [34], in their study on “Abandoned Metalliferous Mines,” demonstrated a significant association between mining and domestic instability, ghost town proliferation, increased environmental pollution, and indirect long-term impacts on ecosystems. Sonter et al. [51] emphasized that mining poses serious and highly specific threats to biodiversity, advocating for coexistence between mining and biodiversity conservation. Kumi-Boateng et al. [54] reported a significant threat to biodiversity due to indiscriminate and unscientific mining methods, with a drastic reduction in tree species density in mined areas compared to unmined ones.\n\nSimilarly, Attuquayefio et al. [4] observed reduced species abundance and diversity indices along with a significant loss of small mammals in the Western Region of Ghana's mined areas. Using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System, Kahangwa et al. [55] documented forest reduction in Geita Gold Mines (Tanzania) due to mining activities, leading to extensive conversion of forest covers to non-forest areas, endangering biodiversity. Haule et al. [46] reported forest clearance in limestone mining in Mbeya (Tanzania), exacerbating soil erosion, vegetation loss, and air pollution. Moreover, Werema et al. [56] in Nzega district, Tabora (Tanzania), observed decreased habitat complexity negatively affecting flora and fauna. Moreover, the lack of awareness of timely environmental management around mine sites exacerbates these issues. Thus, the severity of mining impacts depends on the methods used, contributing negatively to massive damage to landscapes and flora and fauna diversity.\n\n4.1.2 Impacts related to chemicals storage and waste disposal system\n\nAlthough the impacts of mining on biodiversity vary, key effects are summarized in Fig. 3. Besides operational activities, the review highlights that many of the adverse effects of mining on biodiversity originate from the chemicals and reagents used throughout the mining process. Improper disposal of mining waste, solvent or chemical leaks, and the release of dust during mining operations pose significant threats to surrounding biological species [11, 43]. The leakage and discharge of such chemicals undergo biochemical reactions, transforming into other hazardous compounds, as noted by Festin et al. [6] and Kitula [45]. The use of mercury (Hg) and cyanide (CN) also poses specific risks to the environment and biodiversity [51]. Heavy metals commonly used in mining operations, such as those mentioned by Lam et al. [38] and Rasafi et al. [27], significantly threaten various environmental components. For example, acid mine drainage (AMD) occurs when sulfide-bearing material is exposed to oxygen and water, resulting in groundwater contamination and subsequent impacts on water quality and the broader environment [8]. Mensah et al. [49] documented five major cyanide spillages and leaks from Teberebie Goldfields, leading to the contamination of major rivers in Ghana. The compound methylmercury, known for its adverse effects on the natural environment, particularly when entering trophic levels and food chains, was implicated.\n\nFurthermore, dust generated during mining activities, such as blasting, can contain significant amounts of respirable dust, as reported by Malisa & Kinabo [60]. These dusts are associated with major poisonous gases such as CO, CO2, H2S, NO, N2O, HNO2, HNO3, NH3, H2S, and SO2, as observed in Tanzania. The combustion of explosives contributes CO and CO2, while smelting pyrite ore releases H2S, and burned-out explosives emit NO and N2O. Additionally, reactions of nitrogen oxide gases with water produce HNO2 and HNO3. The atmospheric contamination resulting from burning dumps, which releases greenhouse gases like CO2, CO, CH4, H2S, H, SO2, SO3, HCl, and NH4, poses a significant threat to biodiversity, leading to soil nutrient depletion, wildlife habitat destruction, and pollution of water bodies [26, 41, 47]. Mensah et al. [49], on the other hand, documented significant losses in vegetation cover and observed heavily polluted rivers as direct outcomes of mining activities in Ghana. Moreover, Festin et al. [6] detailed the unforeseeable degradation of land and alterations in the physical and chemical characteristics of soil, which were linked to changes in land shape, removal of vegetation, and displacement of topsoil. These activities typically result in decreased species diversity, abundance, and richness. Pollution-induced abiotic stress affects the growth, morphology, and metabolism of species, thereby restraining plant growth [35, 53]. Metal-related impacts lead to acidic and saline soil conditions, displacement of fresh groundwater hindered plant growth, and subsequent loss of ecological services [57]. Virah-sawmy et al. [9] proposed initiatives to integrate critical biodiversity attributes with the mining industry to achieve a better balance between economic development and biodiversity conservation.\n\nAside from ecological concerns, mining operations are associated with various health and social issues. Increased concentrations of particulate matter and dust significantly degrade air quality and pose threats to human health, potentially resulting in lung, larynx, or circulatory system cancer [58]. Dust particles released during mining activities pose significant environmental risks, containing toxic metals that expose humans to health hazards [11, 14]. Other social issues linked to mining are the establishment of local towns, attracting migrants and rapidly increasing population densities. Edwards et al. [3] reported a fourfold increase in population (from 30,000 residents in 1999 to 120,000 residents in 2002) following the establishment of the Geita Mine in Tanzania. Such population growth can have serious adverse impacts on other non-mobile species like plants. The combined effects of mining operations and population growth could significantly alter species composition, potentially leading to species extinction [2]. These effects exacerbate pressures on biodiversity through habitat fragmentation, poaching, bushmeat hunting, and wildlife trade. Additionally, radioactivity and electromagnetic radiation from mineral processing stages are likely to cause the extinction of vulnerable species [26]. It is evident that without proper strategic planning, mining operations in many developing African countries could pose serious threats to humanity as mine waste finds its way into water bodies, affecting aquatic life. Both governments and the mining industry must understand the fundamental principles of biodiversity, which can be achieved through awareness programs, workshops, and capacity-building seminars.\n\n4.2 Potential phytoremediators\n\nThe review observed a preference for using exotic species over indigenous ones in phytoremediation research. Despite their high remediation potential in African nations, these species possess weedy characteristics that allow them to rapidly outcompete native species, threatening biodiversity and reducing the ability to maintain native biota. Invasive non-woody plants such as Triticum aestivum L., Tagetes erecta L., Trifolium repens L., and Bambusa vulgaris Schrad. ex J.C.Wendl., as well as woody species like Stachytarpheta cayennensis (Rich.) Vahl., Lantana camara L., Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck., Theobroma cacao L., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., Artocarpus nobilis Thwaites, and Eucalyptus globulus Labill. are frequently used (Appendix 1). However, the use of such invasive species can outcompete native species for resources such as light, water, and nutrients, leading to the decline or extinction of native species. They can alter habitats, and the structure and composition of ecosystems, making them unsuitable for native species to thrive.\n\nThe current review identified 146 phytoremediator species across various African countries. Among these, 78 (including 57 herbs, 8 shrubs, and 13 trees) are native and commonly found in different regions of Africa. The notable native woody plants (shrubs and trees) frequently found in different African countries, as listed in Table 1, include Indigofera cuneata Oliv., Acacia albida Bentha., Justicia insularis T. Anderson., Palisota ambigua (P.Beauv.) C.B.Clarke., Alchornea cordi Müll.Arg., Icacina trichantha Oliver., Pearsonia metallifera Wild., Alstonia boonei De Wild., and Terminalia superba Engl. & Diels. Furthermore, non-woody (herbaceous) native plants with multielement remediation capabilities include Marantochloa purpurea (Ridl.) Milne-Redh. and Dissotis rotundifolia (Sm.) Triana for As, Hg, Pb, and Cu (Table 2). Other species include Hammada scoparia (Pomel) Iljin., Citrullus vulgaris Schrad., Stipa capensis Thunb., Forsskaolea tenacissima L., Thymus satureioides Coss., and Plantago ovata Forssk. Additional herb species with relatively high remediation capabilities are Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., Cymbopogon plurinodis (Stapf) Stapf ex Burtt Davy., Digitaria eriantha Steud., Eragrostis superba Peyr., Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., Blepharis maderaspatensis (L.) B.Heyne ex Roth., Sporobolus pyramidalis Beauv., Hygrophylla auriculata Schumach., Stylochaeton natalensis Schott., Crinum papilosum Nordal., Pluchea dioscoridis (L.) DC., Commelina benghalensis L., Cyperus articulatus L., Cyperus exaltatus Retz., Fuirena umbellata Rottb., Dioscorea balcanica Košanin., Hoslundia opposita Vahl., and Hibiscus nicranthus L.f. The identified phytoremediators suggest an efficient implementation process that saves time on trial experiments. If these species are successfully incorporated into contaminated sites, they could remediate a wide range of environmental contaminants while promoting biodiversity conservation.\n\nThis review promotes the use of native species to protect soil from contamination and to enhance biodiversity. Researchers have investigated the potential of phytoremediation in mining areas. For instance, Jacklin et al. [60] documented 1410 plant species, 257 of which were indigenous and had remediation capabilities. Nirola et al. [61] highlighted the importance of integrating plant-based technologies to address toxic metal issues in the environment. Yang et al. [62] identified over 400 plants as metal hyperaccumulators, concluding that phytoremediation is a cost-effective method for remediating polluted soils. Similarly, Rasafi et al. [7] in Morocco identified 450 plants as potential remediators for various metals, including Fe and Zn. Kahangwa et al. [10] listed species such as S. pyramidalis, B. maderaspatensis, L. camara, and L. leucocephala as potential hyperaccumulators in gold mining areas. Irunde et al. [8] emphasized the significant remediation potential of indigenous plants like E. crus-galli for various metals. Combining multiple species in a multi-plant system has been shown to provide better performance. Phytoremediation has attracted considerable interest from researchers for its potential in restoring contaminated sites. Similarly, research by Kushwaha et al. [36] demonstrated that the roots of terrestrial plants like Brassica juncea and Helianthus annuus efficiently remove toxic metals such as Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr6+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ from aqueous solutions.\n\nThe findings offer a benchmark and starting point for efficient implementation, minimizing the need for extensive trial experiments. Moreover, the identified plant pool will be readily accessible to researchers, ecologists, environmental practitioners, and government authorities. The review underscores the necessity for further research to deepen our understanding of this viable technology and stresses the importance of funding from governmental and non-governmental organizations to support projects and prioritize native species. Therefore, environmentalists, ecologists, and other stakeholders in African nations must collaborate to promote the use of phytoremediation and incorporate it into national policies and legal frameworks.\n\n4.3 Suitable plants for multi-elemental remediation in Africa\n\nThe top woody plant candidates for multielement remediation identified include Lycium intricatum for Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd; Acacia albida for Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, and Au; Indigofera cuneata for Pb, Zn, Cd, and Ni; and Alstonia boonei for As, Hg, Pb, and Cu (Fig. 4). Other native species with remediation potential are Schinus molle, Uvaria chamae, and Acacia polyacantha. Among non-woody (herbaceous) plants recorded in this review, Marantochloa purpurea and Dissotis rotundifolia can remediate As, Hg, Pb, and Cu, while Hammada scoparia, Citrullus vulgaris, Stipa capensis, Forsskaolea tenacissima, Thymus satureioides, Plantago ovata, and Hygrophylla auriculata can remediate Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn (Fig. 5). Plant species function as phytoremediators, particularly hyperaccumulators, only if they meet specific criteria [34, 73]. Some species can remediate multiple metals (multi-elemental remedy), while others are specific to certain metals (Appendix 1). Plant species like G. celosioides, H. nicranthus, I. cuneata, A. albida, and C. dactylon are effective for remediating metals such as Pb, Zn, Cd, and Ni at a gold mine in Tanzania. Festin et al. [6] found that P. metallifera and D. niccolifera are Ni hyperaccumulators in South Africa, while grasses like C. ciliaris and C. plurinodis are capable of remediating Pb and Zn. Additionally, A. gerrardii, A. karroo, and A. polyacantha have shown good survival in metal-contaminated sites. In Zambia, R. altera and C. dactylon were identified as having significant phytoremediation potential. In South Africa on the other hand, H. annuus, P. americanum, and C. juncea were recognized as effective phytoremediators [66]. Kahangwa et al. [10] identified several potential hyperaccumulators, such as Sporobolus pyramidalis (Pb = 757.78 μg/g), Blepharis maderaspatensis (Cd = 158.11 μg/g). Thus, phytoremediation offers a comprehensive approach to effectively remediate a wide range of contaminated sites [38, 73]. It can tackle current environmental challenges and potentially serve as a viable solution for communities affected by mining-related metallic waste. The review highlighted a gap in understanding the connection between mining and biodiversity, which poses a significant and highly targeted risk to biodiversity. The absence of such knowledge leaves the academic community uninformed. To mitigate the adverse impacts of mining on biodiversity, conservation experts must exert greater pressure on relevant political authorities. This review suggests that the concept of sustainable biodiversity management at mining sites should be a top priority in discussions both between and within governments.\n\n4.4 Limitations for implementing phytoremediation in African"
