        "meta_description": "Abstract. Ice shelves play a key role in the dynamics of marine ice sheets by\nbuttressing grounded ice and limiting rates of ice flux to the oceans. In\nresponse to recent climatic and oceanic change, ice shelves fringing the\nWest Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) have begun to fragment and retreat, with\nmajor implications for ice-sheet stability. Here, we focus on the Thwaites\nEastern Ice Shelf (TEIS), the remaining pinned floating extension of\nThwaites Glacier. We show that TEIS has undergone a process of fragmentation\nin the last 5 years, including brittle failure along a major shear zone,\nformation of tensile cracks on the main body of the shelf, and a release of\ntabular bergs on both the eastern and western flanks. Simulations with the\nHelsinki Discrete Element Model (HiDEM) show that this pattern of failure is\nassociated with high backstress from a submarine pinning point at the distal\nedge of the shelf. We show that a significant zone of shear, upstream of the\nmain pinning point, developed in response to the rapid acceleration of the\nshelf between 2002 and 2006, seeding damage on the shelf. Subsequently,\nbasal melting and positive feedback between damage and strain rates\nweakened TEIS, allowing damage to accumulate. Thus, although backstress on\nTEIS has likely diminished over time as the pinning point shrunk,\naccumulation of damage has ensured that the ice in the shear zone\nremained the weakest link in the system. Experiments with the BISICLES ice-sheet model indicate that additional damage to or unpinning of TEIS is\nunlikely to trigger significantly increased ice loss from WAIS, but the\ncalving response to the loss of TEIS remains highly uncertain. It is widely\nrecognised that ice-shelf fragmentation and collapse can be triggered by\nhydrofracturing and/or unpinning from ice-shelf margins or grounding points.\nOur results indicate a third mechanism, backstress triggered failure, that can occur if and when an ice\nshelf is no longer able to withstand stress imposed by pinning points. In\nmost circumstances, pinning points are essential for ice-shelf stability,\nbut as ice shelves thin and weaken, the concentration of backstress in\ndamaged ice upstream of a pinning point may provide the seeds of their\ndemise.",

Benn, Anna J. Crawford, Joe Todd, and Thomas Zwinger\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 5759–5777, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5759-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5759-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCalving, the detachment of large icebergs from glaciers, is one of the largest uncertainties in future sea level rise projections. This process is poorly understood, and there is an absence of detailed models capable of simulating calving. A new 3D calving model has been developed to better understand calving at glaciers where detailed modelling was previously limited. Importantly, the new model is very flexible. By allowing for unrestricted calving geometries, it can be applied at any location.\n\nA regionally resolved inventory of High Mountain Asia surge-type glaciers, derived from a multi-factor remote sensing approach\n\nGregoire Guillet, Owen King, Mingyang Lv, Sajid Ghuffar, Douglas Benn, Duncan Quincey, and Tobias Bolch\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 603–623, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-603-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-603-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurging glaciers show cyclical changes in flow behavior – between slow and fast flow – and can have drastic impacts on settlements in their vicinity. One of the clusters of surging glaciers worldwide is High Mountain Asia (HMA). We present an inventory of surging glaciers in HMA, identified from satellite imagery. We show that the number of surging glaciers was underestimated and that they represent 20 % of the area covered by glaciers in HMA, before discussing new physics for glacier surges.\n\nContrasting surface velocities between lake- and land-terminating glaciers in the Himalayan region\n\nJan Bouke Pronk, Tobias Bolch, Owen King, Bert Wouters, and Douglas I. Benn\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5577–5599, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5577-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5577-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAbout 10 % of Himalayan glaciers flow directly into lakes. This study finds, using satellite imagery, that such glaciers show higher flow velocities than glaciers without ice–lake contact. In particular near the glacier tongue the impact of a lake on the glacier flow can be dramatic. The development of current and new meltwater bodies will influence the flow of an increasing number of Himalayan glaciers in the future, a scenario not currently considered in regional ice loss projections.\n\nBrief communication: Thwaites Glacier cavity evolution\n\nSuzanne L. Bevan, Adrian J. Luckman, Douglas I. Benn, Susheel Adusumilli, and Anna Crawford\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3317–3328, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3317-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3317-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet depends on the behaviour of the fast-flowing glaciers, such as Thwaites, that connect it to the ocean. Here we show that a large ocean-melted cavity beneath Thwaites Glacier has remained stable since it first formed, implying that, in line with current theory, basal melt is now concentrated close to where the ice first goes afloat. We also show that Thwaites Glacier continues to thin and to speed up and that continued retreat is therefore likely.\n\nBuoyant calving and ice-contact lake evolution at Pasterze Glacier (Austria) in the period 1998â2019\n\nAndreas Kellerer-Pirklbauer, Michael Avian, Douglas I. Benn, Felix Bernsteiner, Philipp Krisch, and Christian Ziesler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1237–1258, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1237-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1237-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPresent climate warming leads to glacier recession and formation of lakes. We studied the nature and rate of lake evolution in the period 1998–2019 at Pasterze Glacier, Austria. We detected for instance several large-scale and rapidly occurring ice-breakup events from below the water level. This process, previously not reported from the European Alps, might play an important role at alpine glaciers in the future as many glaciers are expected to recede into valley basins allowing lake formation.\n\nThinning leads to calving-style changes at Bowdoin Glacier, Greenland\n\nEef C. H. van Dongen, Guillaume Jouvet, Shin Sugiyama, Evgeny A. Podolskiy, Martin Funk, Douglas I. Benn, Fabian Lindner, Andreas Bauder, Julien Seguinot, Silvan Leinss, and Fabian Walter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 485–500, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-485-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-485-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe dynamic mass loss of tidewater glaciers is strongly linked to glacier calving. We study calving mechanisms under a thinning regime, based on 5 years of field and remote-sensing data of Bowdoin Glacier. Our data suggest that Bowdoin Glacier ungrounded recently, and its calving behaviour changed from calving due to surface crevasses to buoyancy-induced calving resulting from basal crevasses. This change may be a precursor to glacier retreat.\n\nImpact of warming shelf waters on ice mÃ©lange and terminus retreat at a large SE Greenland glacier\n\nSuzanne L. Bevan, Adrian J. Luckman, Douglas I.

Satellite images show that it has recently retreated even further. The current retreat follows the appearance of extremely warm surface waters on the continental shelf during the summer of 2016, which likely entered the fjord and caused the rigid mass of sea ice and icebergs, which normally inhibits calving, to melt and break up.\n\nSensitivity of a calving glacier to iceâocean interactions under climate change: new insights from a 3-D full-Stokes model\n\nJoe Todd, Poul Christoffersen, Thomas Zwinger, Peter RÃ¥back, and Douglas I. Benn\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1681–1694, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1681-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1681-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet loses 30 %–60 % of its ice due to iceberg calving. Calving processes and their links to climate are not well understood or incorporated into numerical models of glaciers. Here we use a new 3-D calving model to investigate calving at Store Glacier, West Greenland, and test its sensitivity to increased submarine melting and reduced support from ice mÃ©lange (sea ice and icebergs). We find Store remains fairly stable despite these changes, but less so in the southern side.\n\nAutomatic detection of calving events from time-lapse imagery at Tunabreen, Svalbard\n\nDorothÃ©e Vallot, Sigit Adinugroho, Robin Strand, Penelope How, Rickard Pettersson, Douglas I. Benn, and Nicholas R. J. Hulton\n\nGeosci. Instrum. Method. Data Syst., 8, 113–127, https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-8-113-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-8-113-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a novel method to quantify the sizes and frequency of calving events from time-lapse camera images. The calving front of a tidewater glacier experiences different episodes of iceberg deliveries that can be captured by a time-lapse camera situated in front of the glacier. An automatic way of detecting calving events is presented here and compared to manually detected events.\n\nEffects of undercutting and sliding on calving: a global approach applied to Kronebreen, Svalbard\n\nDorothÃ©e Vallot, Jan Ã strÃ¶m, Thomas Zwinger, Rickard Pettersson, Alistair Everett, Douglas I. Benn, Adrian Luckman, Ward J. J. van Pelt, Faezeh Nick, and Jack Kohler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 609–625, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-609-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-609-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a new perspective on the role of ice dynamics and ocean interaction in glacier calving processes applied to Kronebreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard. A global modelling approach includes ice flow modelling, undercutting estimation by a combination of glacier energy balance and plume modelling as well as calving by a discrete particle model. We show that modelling undercutting is necessary and calving is influenced by basal friction velocity and geometry.\n\nRapidly changing subglacial hydrological pathways at a tidewater glacier revealed through simultaneous observations of water pressure, supraglacial lakes, meltwater plumes and surface velocities\n\nPenelope How, Douglas I. Benn, Nicholas R. J. Hulton, Bryn Hubbard, Adrian Luckman, HeÃ¯di Sevestre, Ward J. J. van Pelt, Katrin LindbÃ¤ck, Jack Kohler, and Wim Boot\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2691–2710, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2691-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2691-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides valuable insight into subglacial hydrology and dynamics at tidewater glaciers, which remains a poorly understood area of glaciology. It is a unique study because of the wealth of information provided by simultaneous observations of glacier hydrology at Kronebreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard. All these elements build a strong conceptual picture of the glacier's hydrological regime over the 2014 melt season.\n\nStructure and evolution of the drainage system of aÂ HimalayanÂ debris-covered glacier, and its relationshipÂ withÂ patternsÂ ofÂ massÂ loss\n\nDouglas I. Benn, Sarah Thompson, Jason Gulley, Jordan Mertes, Adrian Luckman, and Lindsey Nicholson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2247–2264, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2247-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2247-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper provides the first complete view of the drainage system of a large Himalayan glacier, based on ice-cave exploration and satellite image analysis. Drainage tunnels inside glaciers have a major impact on melting rates, by providing lines of weakness inside the ice and potential pathways for melt-water, and play a key role in the response of debris-covered glaciers to sustained periods of negative mass balance.\n\nA particle based simulation model for glacier dynamics\n\nJ.

Previous applications of the stabilization on ice flows have only considered simple ice-sheet benchmark problems; in particular the method had not been tested on real-world glacier domains. This work addresses this shortcoming by demonstrating that the stabilization works well also in this case and increases stability and robustness without negatively impacting computation times.\n\nA new 3DÂ full-Stokes calving algorithm within Elmer/Ice (v9.0)\n\nIain Wheel, Douglas I. Benn, Anna J. Crawford, Joe Todd, and Thomas Zwinger\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 5759–5777, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5759-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5759-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCalving, the detachment of large icebergs from glaciers, is one of the largest uncertainties in future sea level rise projections. This process is poorly understood, and there is an absence of detailed models capable of simulating calving. A new 3D calving model has been developed to better understand calving at glaciers where detailed modelling was previously limited. Importantly, the new model is very flexible. By allowing for unrestricted calving geometries, it can be applied at any location.\n\nTidal influence on flow dynamics of Dotson Ice Shelf, West Antarctica\n\nGabriela Collao-Barrios, Ted A. Scambos, Christian T. Wild, Martin Truffer, Karen E. Alley, and Erin C. Pettit\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1895,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1895, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDestabilization of ice shelves frequently leads to significant acceleration and greater mass loss, affecting rates of sea level rise. Our results show a relation between tides, flow direction, and grounding-zone acceleration that result from changing stresses in the ice margins and around a nunatak in Dotson Ice Shelf. The study describes a new way tides can influence ice shelf dynamics, an effect that could become more common as ice shelves thin and weaken around Antarctica.\n\nSensitivity of Totten Glacier dynamics to sliding parameterizations and ice shelf basal melt rates\n\nYiliang Ma, Liyun Zhao, Rupert Gladstone, Thomas Zwinger, Michael Wolovick, and John C. Moore\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1102,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1102, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTotten Glacier in Antarctica holds a sea level potential of 3.85 m. Basal sliding and sub-shelf melt rate have important impact on ice sheet dynamics. We simulate the evolution of Totten Glacier using an ice flow model with different basal sliding parameterizations as well as sub-shelf melt rates to quantify their effect on the projections. We found the modelled glacier retreat and mass loss is sensitive to the choice of basal sliding parameterizations and maximal sub-shelf melt rate.\n\nApplication of a regularised Coulomb sliding law to Jakobshavn Isbræ, West Greenland\n\nMatt Trevers, Antony J. Payne, and Stephen L. Cornford\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1040,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1040, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe form of the friction law which determines the speed of ice sliding over the bedrock remains a major source of uncertainty in ice sheet model projections of future sea level rise. Jakobshavn Isbræ, the fastest flowing glacier in Greenland which has undergone significant changes in the last few decades, is an ideal case for testing sliding laws. We find that a regularised Coulomb friction law reproduces the large seasonal and interannual flow speed variations most accurately.\n\nSensitivity of Future Projections of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin Ice Sheet to Grounding Line Melt Parameterizations\n\nYu Wang, Chen Zhao, Rupert Gladstone, Thomas Zwinger, Ben Galton-Fenzi, and Poul Christoffersen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1005,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1005, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur research delves into the future ice loss in Antarctica’s Wilkes Subglacial Basin (WSB) and its impact on sea level rise, focusing on how basal melt is implemented at the grounding line in ice flow models. According to our best model results, under high-emission scenarios, the WSB ice sheet could undergo massive and rapid retreat between 2200 and 2300, potentially raising global sea levels by up to 0.34 m by 2500.\n\nTriggers of the 2022 Larsen B multi-year landfast sea ice breakout and initial glacier response\n\nNaomi E. Ochwat, Ted A. Scambos, Alison F. Banwell, Robert S. Anderson, Michelle L. Maclennan, Ghislain Picard, Julia A. Shates, Sebastian Marinsek, Liliana Margonari, Martin Truffer, and Erin C. Pettit\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1709–1731, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1709-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1709-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOn the Antarctic Peninsula, there is a small bay that had sea ice fastened to the shoreline (fast ice) for over a decade. The fast ice stabilized the glaciers that fed into the ocean. In January 2022, the fast ice broke away. Using satellite data we found that this was because of low sea ice concentrations and a high long-period ocean wave swell. We find that the glaciers have responded to this event by thinning, speeding up, and retreating by breaking off lots of icebergs at remarkable rates.\n\nThe effect of landfast sea ice buttressing on ice dynamic speedup in the Larsen B embayment, Antarctica\n\nTrystan Surawy-Stepney, Anna E. Hogg, Stephen L. Cornford, Benjamin J. Wallis, Benjamin J. Davison, Heather L. Selley, Ross A. W. Slater, Elise K. Lie, Livia Jakob, Andrew Ridout, Noel Gourmelen, Bryony I. D. Freer, Sally F. Wilson, and Andrew Shepherd\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 977–993, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-977-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-977-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we use satellite observations and an ice flow model to quantify the impact of sea ice buttressing on ice streams on the Antarctic Peninsula. The evacuation of 11-year-old landfast sea ice in the Larsen B embayment on the East Antarctic Peninsula in January 2022 was closely followed by major changes in the calving behaviour and acceleration (30 %) of the ocean-terminating glaciers. Our results show that sea ice buttressing had a negligible direct role in the observed dynamic changes.\n\nISMIP6-based Antarctic Projections to 2100: simulations with the BISICLES ice sheet model\n\nJames F. O'Neill, Tamsin L. Edwards, Daniel F. Martin, Courtney Shafer, Stephen L. Cornford, Helene L. Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, and Mira Adhikari\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-441,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-441, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use an ice sheet model to simulate the Antarctic contribution to sea level over the 21st century, under a range of future climates, varying how sensitive the ice sheet is to different processes. We find that, under stronger warming scenarios, ocean temperatures increases and more snow falls on the ice sheet. When the ice sheet is sensitive to ocean warming, ocean melting driven loss exceeds snowfall driven gains, so that the sea level contribution is greater with more climate warming.\n\nBrief communication: Rapid acceleration of the Brunt Ice Shelf after calving of iceberg A-81\n\nOliver J. Marsh, Adrian J. Luckman, and Dominic A. Hodgson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 705–710, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-705-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-705-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Brunt Ice Shelf has accelerated rapidly after calving an iceberg in January 2023. A decade of GPS data show that the rate of acceleration in August 2023 was 30 times higher than before calving, and velocity has doubled in 6 months. Satellite velocity maps show the extent of the change. The acceleration is due to loss of contact between the ice shelf and a pinning point known as the McDonald Ice Rumples. The observations highlight how iceberg calving can directly impact ice shelves.\n\nEvaluating an accelerated forcing approach for improving computational efficiency in coupled ice sheet-ocean modelling\n\nQin Zhou, Chen Zhao, Rupert Gladstone, Tore Hattermann, David Gwyther, and Benjamin Galton-Fenzi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-244,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-244, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript under review for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have introduced an \"accelerated forcing\" approach to address the discrepancy in timescales between ice sheet and ocean models in coupled modelling, by reducing the ocean model simulation duration. We evaluate the approach's applicability and limitations based on idealized coupled models. Our results suggest that, when used carefully, the approach can be a useful tool in coupled ice sheet-ocean modelling, especially relevant to studies on sea level rise projections.\n\nInsights into the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers from the ISMIP6 ice sheet model ensemble and associated uncertainty\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Vincent Verjans, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nMillennial and orbital-scale variability in a 54 000-year record of total air content from the South Pole ice core\n\nJenna A. Epifanio, Edward J. Brook, Christo Buizert, Erin C. Pettit, Jon S. Edwards, John M. Fegyveresi, Todd A. Sowers, Jeffrey P. Severinghaus, and Emma C. Kahle\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4837–4851, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4837-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4837-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe total air content (TAC) of polar ice cores has long been considered a potential proxy for past ice sheet elevation. This study presents a high-resolution record of TAC from the South Pole ice core. The record reveals orbital- and millennial-scale variability that cannot be explained by elevation changes. The orbital- and millennial-scale changes are likely a product of firn grain metamorphism near the surface of the ice sheet, due to summer insolation changes or local accumulation changes.\n\nMapping Antarctic crevasses and their evolution with deep learning applied to satellite radar imagery\n\nTrystan Surawy-Stepney, Anna E. Hogg, Stephen L. Cornford, and David C. Hogg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4421–4445, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4421-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4421-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe presence of crevasses in Antarctica influences how the ice sheet behaves. It is important, therefore, to collect data on the spatial distribution of crevasses and how they are changing. We present a method of mapping crevasses from satellite radar imagery and apply it to 7.5 years of images, covering Antarctica's floating and grounded ice. We develop a method of measuring change in the density of crevasses and quantify increased fracturing in important parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\n\nSubglacial hydrology from high-resolution ice-flow simulations of the Rhine Glacier during the Last Glacial Maximum: a proxy for glacial erosion\n\nDenis Cohen, Guillaume Jouvet, Thomas Zwinger, Angela Landgraf, and Urs H. Fischer\n\nE&G Quaternary Sci. J., 72, 189–201, https://doi.org/10.5194/egqsj-72-189-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/egqsj-72-189-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring glacial times in Switzerland, glaciers of the Alps excavated valleys in low-lying regions that were later filled with sediment or water. How glaciers eroded these valleys is not well understood because erosion occurred near ice margins where ice moved slowly and was present for short times. Erosion is linked to the speed of ice and to water flowing under it. Here we present a model that estimates the location of water channels beneath the ice and links these locations to zones of erosion.\n\nA leading-order viscoelastic model for crevasse propagation and calving in ice shelves\n\nMaryam Zarrinderakht, Christian Schoof, and Thomas Zwinger\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-807,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-807, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used a model to study how crevasses propagate in ice shelves. Our model combines a viscous model and a fracture mechanics model. We studied periodic crevasses on an ice shelf being stretched. We show that existing models based only on stress cannot fully explain how crevasses grow and lead to iceberg calving. This model can be a useful tool to train a low-dimensional representation calving law for an ice sheet model.\n\nClimatology and surface impacts of atmospheric rivers on West Antarctica\n\nMichelle L. Maclennan, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Christine A. Shields, Andrew O. Hoffman, Nander Wever, Megan Thompson-Munson, Andrew C. Winters, Erin C. Pettit, Theodore A. Scambos, and Jonathan D. Wille\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 865–881, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-865-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-865-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric rivers are air masses that transport large amounts of moisture and heat towards the poles. Here, we use a combination of weather observations and models to quantify the amount of snowfall caused by atmospheric rivers in West Antarctica which is about 10 % of the total snowfall each year. We then examine a unique event that occurred in early February 2020, when three atmospheric rivers made landfall over West Antarctica in rapid succession, leading to heavy snowfall and surface melt.\n\nGlaciological history and structural evolution of the Shackleton Ice Shelf system, East Antarctica, over the past 60 years\n\nSarah S. Thompson, Bernd Kulessa, Adrian Luckman, Jacqueline A. Halpin, Jamin S. Greenbaum, Tyler Pelle, Feras Habbal, Jingxue Guo, Lenneke M. Jong, Jason L. Roberts, Bo Sun, and Donald D. Blankenship\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 157–174, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-157-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-157-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use satellite imagery and ice penetrating radar to investigate the stability of the Shackleton system in East Antarctica. We find significant changes in surface structures across the system and observe a significant increase in ice flow speed (up to 50 %) on the floating part of Scott Glacier. We conclude that knowledge remains woefully insufficient to explain recent observed changes in the grounded and floating regions of the system.\n\nTermPicks: a century of Greenland glacier terminus data for use in scientific and machine learning applications\n\nSophie Goliber, Taryn Black, Ginny Catania, James M.

Korsgaard, Adrian Luckman, Twila Moon, Tavi Murray, Andrew Sole, Michael Wood, and Enze Zhang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3215–3233, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3215-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3215-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTerminus traces have been used to understand how Greenland's glaciers have changed over time; however, manual digitization is time-intensive, and a lack of coordination leads to duplication of efforts. We have compiled a dataset of over 39 000 terminus traces for 278 glaciers for scientific and machine learning applications. We also provide an overview of an updated version of the Google Earth Engine Digitization Tool (GEEDiT), which has been developed specifically for the Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\nEvaluation of an emergent feature of sub-shelf melt oscillations from an idealized coupled ice sheetâocean model using FISOC (v1.1) â ROMSIceShelf (v1.0) â Elmer/Ice (v9.0)\n\nChen Zhao, Rupert Gladstone, Benjamin Keith Galton-Fenzi, David Gwyther, and Tore Hattermann\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 5421–5439, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5421-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5421-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a coupled ice–ocean model to explore an oscillation feature found in several contributing models to MISOMIP1. The oscillation is closely related to the discretized grounding line retreat and likely strengthened by the buoyancy–melt feedback and/or melt–geometry feedback near the grounding line, and frequent ice–ocean coupling. Our model choices have a non-trivial impact on mean melt and ocean circulation strength, which might be interesting for the coupled ice–ocean community.\n\nModelling the mass budget and future evolution of Tunabreen, central Spitsbergen\n\nJohannes Oerlemans, Jack Kohler, and Adrian Luckman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2115–2126, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2115-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2115-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTunabreen is a 26 km long tidewater glacier. It is the most frequently surging glacier in Svalbard, with four documented surges in the past 100 years. We have modelled this glacier to find out how it reacts to future climate change. Careful calibration was done against the observed length record for the past 100 years. For a 50 m increase in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) the length of the glacier will be shortened by 10 km after about 100 years.\n\nThermal structure of the Amery Ice Shelf from borehole observations and simulations\n\nYu Wang, Chen Zhao, Rupert Gladstone, Ben Galton-Fenzi, and Roland Warner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1221–1245, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1221-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1221-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe thermal structure of the Amery Ice Shelf and its spatial pattern are evaluated and analysed through temperature observations from six boreholes and numerical simulations. The simulations demonstrate significant ice warming downstream along the ice flow and a great variation of the thermal structure across the ice flow. We suggest that the thermal structure of the Amery Ice Shelf is unlikely to be affected by current climate changes on decadal timescales.\n\nA regionally resolved inventory of High Mountain Asia surge-type glaciers, derived from a multi-factor remote sensing approach\n\nGregoire Guillet, Owen King, Mingyang Lv, Sajid Ghuffar, Douglas Benn, Duncan Quincey, and Tobias Bolch\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 603–623, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-603-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-603-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurging glaciers show cyclical changes in flow behavior – between slow and fast flow – and can have drastic impacts on settlements in their vicinity. One of the clusters of surging glaciers worldwide is High Mountain Asia (HMA). We present an inventory of surging glaciers in HMA, identified from satellite imagery. We show that the number of surging glaciers was underestimated and that they represent 20 % of the area covered by glaciers in HMA, before discussing new physics for glacier surges.\n\nWeakening of the pinning point buttressing Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica\n\nChristian T. Wild, Karen E. Alley, Atsuhiro Muto, Martin Truffer, Ted A. Scambos, and Erin C. Pettit\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 397–417, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-397-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-397-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThwaites Glacier has the potential to significantly raise Antarctica's contribution to global sea-level rise by the end of this century. Here, we use satellite measurements of surface elevation to show that its floating part is close to losing contact with an underwater ridge that currently acts to stabilize. We then use computer models of ice flow to simulate the predicted unpinning, which show that accelerated ice discharge into the ocean follows the breakup of the floating part.\n\nContrasting surface velocities between lake- and land-terminating glaciers in the Himalayan region\n\nJan Bouke Pronk, Tobias Bolch, Owen King, Bert Wouters, and Douglas I. Benn\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5577–5599, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5577-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5577-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAbout 10 % of Himalayan glaciers flow directly into lakes. This study finds, using satellite imagery, that such glaciers show higher flow velocities than glaciers without ice–lake contact. In particular near the glacier tongue the impact of a lake on the glacier flow can be dramatic. The development of current and new meltwater bodies will influence the flow of an increasing number of Himalayan glaciers in the future, a scenario not currently considered in regional ice loss projections.\n\nTwo decades of dynamic change and progressive destabilization on the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf\n\nKaren E. Alley, Christian T. Wild, Adrian Luckman, Ted A. Scambos, Martin Truffer, Erin C. Pettit, Atsuhiro Muto, Bruce Wallin, Marin Klinger, Tyler Sutterley, Sarah F. Child, Cyrus Hulen, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Michelle Maclennan, Eric Keenan, and Devon Dunmire\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5187–5203, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5187-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5187-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a 20-year, satellite-based record of velocity and thickness change on the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (TEIS), the largest remaining floating extension of Thwaites Glacier (TG). TG holds the single greatest control on sea-level rise over the next few centuries, so it is important to understand changes on the TEIS, which controls much of TG's flow into the ocean. Our results suggest that the TEIS is progressively destabilizing and is likely to disintegrate over the next few decades.\n\nBrief communication: Thwaites Glacier cavity evolution\n\nSuzanne L. Bevan, Adrian J. Luckman, Douglas I. Benn, Susheel Adusumilli, and Anna Crawford\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3317–3328, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3317-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3317-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet depends on the behaviour of the fast-flowing glaciers, such as Thwaites, that connect it to the ocean. Here we show that a large ocean-melted cavity beneath Thwaites Glacier has remained stable since it first formed, implying that, in line with current theory, basal melt is now concentrated close to where the ice first goes afloat. We also show that Thwaites Glacier continues to thin and to speed up and that continued retreat is therefore likely.\n\nGeophysical constraints on the properties of a subglacial lake in northwest Greenland\n\nRoss Maguire, Nicholas Schmerr, Erin Pettit, Kiya Riverman, Christyna Gardner, Daniella N. DellaGiustina, Brad Avenson, Natalie Wagner, Angela G. Marusiak, Namrah Habib, Juliette I. Broadbeck, Veronica J. Bray, and Samuel H. Bailey\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3279–3291, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3279-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3279-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the last decade, airborne radar surveys have revealed the presence of lakes below the Greenland ice sheet. However, little is known about their properties, including their depth and the volume of water they store. We performed a ground-based geophysics survey in northwestern Greenland and, for the first time, were able to image the depth of a subglacial lake and estimate its volume. Our findings have implications for the thermal state and stability of the ice sheet in northwest Greenland.\n\nUnderstanding drivers of glacier-length variability over the last millennium\n\nAlan Huston, Nicholas Siler, Gerard H. Roe, Erin Pettit, and Nathan J. Steiger\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1645–1662, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1645-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1645-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulate the past 1000 years of glacier length variability using a simple glacier model and an ensemble of global climate model simulations. Glaciers with long response times are more likely to record global climate changes caused by events like volcanic eruptions and greenhouse gas emissions, while glaciers with short response times are more likely to record natural variability. This difference stems from differences in the frequency spectra of natural and forced temperature variability.\n\nBuoyant calving and ice-contact lake evolution at Pasterze Glacier (Austria) in the period 1998â2019\n\nAndreas Kellerer-Pirklbauer, Michael Avian, Douglas I. Benn, Felix Bernsteiner, Philipp Krisch, and Christian Ziesler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1237–1258, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1237-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1237-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPresent climate warming leads to glacier recession and formation of lakes. We studied the nature and rate of lake evolution in the period 1998–2019 at Pasterze Glacier, Austria. We detected for instance several large-scale and rapidly occurring ice-breakup events from below the water level. This process, previously not reported from the European Alps, might play an important role at alpine glaciers in the future as many glaciers are expected to recede into valley basins allowing lake formation.\n\nThe Framework For Ice SheetâOcean Coupling (FISOC) V1.1\n\nRupert Gladstone, Benjamin Galton-Fenzi, David Gwyther, Qin Zhou, Tore Hattermann, Chen Zhao, Lenneke Jong, Yuwei Xia, Xiaoran Guo, Konstantinos Petrakopoulos, Thomas Zwinger, Daniel Shapero, and John Moore\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 889–905, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-889-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-889-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRetreat of the Antarctic ice sheet, and hence its contribution to sea level rise, is highly sensitive to melting of its floating ice shelves. This melt is caused by warm ocean currents coming into contact with the ice. Computer models used for future ice sheet projections are not able to realistically evolve these melt rates. We describe a new coupling framework to enable ice sheet and ocean computer models to interact, allowing projection of the evolution of melt and its impact on sea level.\n\nThinning leads to calving-style changes at Bowdoin Glacier, Greenland\n\nEef C. H. van Dongen, Guillaume Jouvet, Shin Sugiyama, Evgeny A. Podolskiy, Martin Funk, Douglas I. Benn, Fabian Lindner, Andreas Bauder, Julien Seguinot, Silvan Leinss, and Fabian Walter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 485–500, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-485-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-485-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe dynamic mass loss of tidewater glaciers is strongly linked to glacier calving. We study calving mechanisms under a thinning regime, based on 5 years of field and remote-sensing data of Bowdoin Glacier. Our data suggest that Bowdoin Glacier ungrounded recently, and its calving behaviour changed from calving due to surface crevasses to buoyancy-induced calving resulting from basal crevasses. This change may be a precursor to glacier retreat.\n\nThe 2020 Larsen C Ice Shelf surface melt is a 40-year record high\n\nSuzanne Bevan, Adrian Luckman, Harry Hendon, and Guomin Wang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3551–3564, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3551-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3551-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn February 2020, along with record-breaking high temperatures in the region, satellite images showed that the surface of the largest remaining ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula was experiencing a lot of melt. Using archived satellite data we show that this melt was greater than any in the past 40 years. The extreme melt followed unusual weather patterns further north, highlighting the importance of long-range links between the tropics and high latitudes and the impact on ice-shelf stability.\n\nBrief communication: Time step dependence (and fixes) in Stokes simulations of calving ice shelves\n\nBrandon Berg and Jeremy Bassis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3209–3213, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3209-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3209-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComputer models of ice sheets and glaciers are an important component of projecting sea level rise due to climate change. For models that seek to simulate the full balance of forces within the ice, if portions of the glacier are allowed to quickly break off in a process called iceberg calving, a numerical issue arises that can cause inaccurate results. We examine the issue and propose a solution so that future models can more accurately predict the future behavior of ice sheets and glaciers.\n\nISMIP6 Antarctica: a multi-model ensemble of the Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the 21st century\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

This study presents an ensemble of model simulations of the Antarctic evolution over the 2015–2100 period based on various ice sheet models, climate forcings and emission scenarios. Results suggest that the West Antarctic ice sheet will continue losing a large amount of ice, while the East Antarctic ice sheet could experience increased snow accumulation.\n\nResults of the third Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (MISMIP+)\n\nStephen L. Cornford, Helene Seroussi, Xylar S. Asay-Davis, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, Rob Arthern, Chris Borstad, Julia Christmann, Thiago Dias dos Santos, Johannes Feldmann, Daniel Goldberg, Matthew J.

MISMIP+ is one in a series of exercises that test numerical models of ice sheet flow in simple situations. This particular exercise concentrates on the response of ice sheet models to the thinning of their floating ice shelves, which is of interest because numerical models are currently used to model the response to contemporary and near-future thinning in Antarctic ice shelves.\n\nAn updated seabed bathymetry beneath Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula\n\nAlex Brisbourne, Bernd Kulessa, Thomas Hudson, Lianne Harrison, Paul Holland, Adrian Luckman, Suzanne Bevan, David Ashmore, Bryn Hubbard, Emma Pearce, James White, Adam Booth, Keith Nicholls, and Andrew Smith\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 12, 887–896, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-887-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-887-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMelting of the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica may lead to its collapse. To help estimate its lifespan we need to understand how the ocean can circulate beneath. This requires knowledge of the geometry of the sub-shelf cavity. New and existing measurements of seabed depth are integrated to produce a map of the ocean cavity beneath the ice shelf. The observed deep seabed may provide a pathway for circulation of warm ocean water but at the same time reduce rapid tidal melt at a critical location.\n\nIce island thinning: rates and model calibration with in situ observations from Baffin Bay, Nunavut\n\nAnna J. Crawford, Derek Mueller, Gregory Crocker, Laurent Mingo, Luc Desjardins, Dany Dumont, and Marcel Babin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1067–1081, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1067-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1067-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge tabular icebergs (ice islands) are symbols of climate change as well as marine hazards. We measured thickness along radar transects over two visits to a 14 km2 Arctic ice island and left automated equipment to monitor surface ablation and thickness over 1 year. We assess variation in thinning rates and calibrate an ice–ocean melt model with field data. Our work contributes to understanding ice island deterioration via logistically complex fieldwork in a remote environment.\n\nA new open-source viscoelastic solid earth deformation module implemented in Elmer (v8.4)\n\nThomas Zwinger, Grace A. Nield, Juha Ruokolainen, and Matt A. King\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 1155–1164, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1155-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1155-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a newly developed flat-earth model, Elmer/Earth, for viscoelastic treatment of solid earth deformation under ice loads. Unlike many previous approaches with proprietary software, this model is based on the open-source FEM code Elmer, with the advantage for scientists to apply and alter the model without license constraints. The new-generation full-stress ice-sheet model Elmer/Ice shares the same code base, enabling future coupled ice-sheet–glacial-isostatic-adjustment simulations.\n\nSimulated retreat of Jakobshavn IsbrÃ¦ during the 21st century\n\nXiaoran Guo, Liyun Zhao, Rupert M.

Bevan, Adrian J. Luckman, Douglas I. Benn, Tom Cowton, and Joe Todd\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2303–2315, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2303-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2303-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKangerlussuaq Glacier in Greenland retreated significantly in the early 2000s and typified the response of calving glaciers to climate change. Satellite images show that it has recently retreated even further. The current retreat follows the appearance of extremely warm surface waters on the continental shelf during the summer of 2016, which likely entered the fjord and caused the rigid mass of sea ice and icebergs, which normally inhibits calving, to melt and break up.\n\nScientific workflows applied to the coupling of a continuum (Elmer v8.3) and a discrete element (HiDEM v1.0) ice dynamic model\n\nShahbaz Memon, DorothÃ©e Vallot, Thomas Zwinger, Jan Ã strÃ¶m, Helmut Neukirchen, Morris Riedel, and Matthias Book\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 3001–3015, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-3001-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-3001-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nScientific workflows enable complex scientific computational scenarios, which include data intensive scenarios, parametric executions, and interactive simulations. In this article, we applied the UNICORE workflow management system to automate a formerly hard-coded coupling of a glacier flow model and a calving model, which contain many tasks and dependencies, ranging from pre-processing and data management to repetitive executions on heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) resources.\n\nBuoyant forces promote tidewater glacier iceberg calving through large basal stress concentrations\n\nMatt Trevers, Antony J. Payne, Stephen L. Cornford, and Twila Moon\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1877–1887, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1877-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1877-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIceberg calving is a major factor in the retreat of outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Massive block overturning calving events occur at major outlet glaciers. A major calving event in 2009 was triggered by the release of a smaller block of ice from above the waterline. Using a numerical model, we investigate the feasibility of this mechanism to drive large calving events. We find that relatively small perturbations induce forces large enough to open cracks in ice at the glacier bed.\n\nIceberg topography and volume classification using TanDEM-X interferometry\n\nDyre O. Dammann, Leif E. B. Eriksson, Son V. Nghiem, Erin C. Pettit, Nathan T. Kurtz, John G. Sonntag, Thomas E. Busche, Franz J. Meyer, and Andrew R. Mahoney\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1861–1875, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1861-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1861-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe validate TanDEM-X interferometry as a tool for deriving iceberg subaerial morphology using Operation IceBridge data. This approach enables a volumetric classification of icebergs, according to volume relevant to iceberg drift and decay, freshwater contribution, and potential impact on structures. We find iceberg volumes to generally match within 7 %. These results suggest that TanDEM-X could pave the way for future interferometric systems of scientific and operational iceberg classification.\n\nSensitivity of a calving glacier to iceâocean interactions under climate change: new insights from a 3-D full-Stokes model\n\nJoe Todd, Poul Christoffersen, Thomas Zwinger, Peter RÃ¥back, and Douglas I. Benn\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1681–1694, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1681-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1681-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet loses 30 %–60 % of its ice due to iceberg calving. Calving processes and their links to climate are not well understood or incorporated into numerical models of glaciers. Here we use a new 3-D calving model to investigate calving at Store Glacier, West Greenland, and test its sensitivity to increased submarine melting and reduced support from ice mÃ©lange (sea ice and icebergs). We find Store remains fairly stable despite these changes, but less so in the southern side.\n\ninitMIP-Antarctica: an ice sheet model initialization experiment of ISMIP6\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, Erika Simon, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Torsten Albrecht, Julien Brondex, Stephen Cornford, Christophe Dumas, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Heiko Goelzer, Nicholas R.

Rodehacke, Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel, Andrew Shepherd, Sainan Sun, Johannes Sutter, Jonas Van Breedam, Roderik S. W. van de Wal, Ricarda Winkelmann, and Tong Zhang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1441–1471, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1441-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1441-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare a wide range of Antarctic ice sheet simulations with varying initialization techniques and model parameters to understand the role they play on the projected evolution of this ice sheet under simple scenarios. Results are improved compared to previous assessments and show that continued improvements in the representation of the floating ice around Antarctica are critical to reduce the uncertainty in the future ice sheet contribution to sea level rise.\n\nAutomatic detection of calving events from time-lapse imagery at Tunabreen, Svalbard\n\nDorothÃ©e Vallot, Sigit Adinugroho, Robin Strand, Penelope How, Rickard Pettersson, Douglas I. Benn, and Nicholas R. J. Hulton\n\nGeosci. Instrum. Method. Data Syst., 8, 113–127, https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-8-113-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-8-113-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a novel method to quantify the sizes and frequency of calving events from time-lapse camera images. The calving front of a tidewater glacier experiences different episodes of iceberg deliveries that can be captured by a time-lapse camera situated in front of the glacier. An automatic way of detecting calving events is presented here and compared to manually detected events.\n\nNeutral equilibrium and forcing feedbacks in marine ice sheet modelling\n\nRupert M. Gladstone, Yuwei Xia, and John Moore\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3605–3615, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3605-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3605-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComputer models for the simulation of marine ice sheets (ice sheets resting on bedrock below sea level) historically show poor numerical convergence for grounding line (the boundary between grounded and floating parts of the ice sheet) movement. We have further characterised the nature of the numerical problems leading to poor convergence and highlighted implications for the design of computer experiments that test grounding line movement.\n\nDynamically coupling full Stokes and shallow shelf approximation for marine ice sheet flow using Elmer/Ice (v8.3)\n\nEef C. H. van Dongen, Nina Kirchner, Martin B. van Gijzen, Roderik S. W. van de Wal, Thomas Zwinger, Gong Cheng, Per LÃ¶tstedt, and Lina von Sydow\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 4563–4576, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4563-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4563-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce flow forced by gravity is governed by the full Stokes (FS) equations, which are computationally expensive to solve. Therefore, approximations to the FS equations are used, especially when modeling an ice sheet on long time spans. Here, we report a combination of an approximation with the FS equations that allows simulating the dynamics of ice sheets over long time spans without introducing artifacts caused by application of approximations in parts of the domain where they are not valid.\n\nBasal friction of Fleming Glacier, Antarctica â Part 1: Sensitivity of inversion to temperature and bedrock uncertainty\n\nChen Zhao, Rupert M. Gladstone, Roland C. Warner, Matt A. King, Thomas Zwinger, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2637–2652, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2637-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2637-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA combination of computer modelling and observational data were used to infer the resistance to ice flow at the bed of the Fleming Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula. The model was also used to simulate the distribution of temperature within the ice, which governs the rate at which the ice can deform. This is especially important for glaciers like the Fleming Glacier, which has both regions of rapid deformation and regions of rapid sliding at the bed.\n\nBasal friction of Fleming Glacier, Antarctica â PartÂ 2: Evolution fromÂ 2008 toÂ 2015\n\nChen Zhao, Rupert M. Gladstone, Roland C. Warner, Matt A. King, Thomas Zwinger, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2653–2666, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2653-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2653-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA combination of computer modelling and observational data were used to infer the resistance to ice flow at the bed of the Fleming Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula in both 2008 and 2015. The comparison suggests the grounding line retreated by ~ 9 km from 2008 to 2015. The retreat may be enhanced by a positive feedback between friction, melting and sliding at the glacier bed.\n\nSimulated dynamic regrounding during marine ice sheet retreat\n\nLenneke M. Jong, Rupert M. Gladstone, Benjamin K. Galton-Fenzi, and Matt A. King\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2425–2436, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2425-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2425-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used an ice sheet model to simulate temporary regrounding of a marine ice sheet retreating across a retrograde bedrock slope. We show that a sliding relation incorporating water-filled cavities and the ice overburden pressure at the base allows the temporary regrounding to occur. This suggests that choice of basal sliding relation can be important when modelling grounding line behaviour of regions where potential ice rises and pinning points are present and regrounding could occur.\n\nModelled fracture and calving on the Totten Ice Shelf\n\nSue Cook, Jan Ã strÃ¶m, Thomas Zwinger, Benjamin Keith Galton-Fenzi, Jamin Stevens Greenbaum, and Richard Coleman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2401–2411, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2401-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2401-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe growth of fractures on Antarctic ice shelves is important because it controls the amount of ice lost as icebergs. We use a model constructed of multiple interconnected blocks to predict the locations where fractures will form on the Totten Ice Shelf in East Antarctica. The results show that iceberg calving is controlled not only by fractures forming near the front of the ice shelf but also by fractures which formed many kilometres upstream.\n\nDynamic response of Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet to potential collapse of Larsen C and George VI ice shelves\n\nClemens Schannwell, Stephen Cornford, David Pollard, and Nicholas E. Barrand\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2307–2326, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2307-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2307-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite the speculation on the state and fate of Larsen C Ice Shelf, a key unknown factor remains: what would be the effects of ice-shelf collapse on upstream drainage basins and thus global sea levels? In our paper three state-of-the-art numerical ice-sheet models were used to simulate the volume evolution of the inland ice sheet to ice-shelf collapse at Larsen C and George VI ice shelves. Our results suggest sea-level rise of up to ~ 4 mm for Larsen C ice shelf and ~ 22 for George VI ice shelf.\n\nSimulating the roles of crevasse routing of surface water and basal friction on the surge evolution of Basin 3, Austfonna ice cap\n\nYongmei Gong, Thomas Zwinger, Jan Ã strÃ¶m, Bas Altena, Thomas Schellenberger, Rupert Gladstone, and John C. Moore\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1563–1577, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1563-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1563-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we apply a discrete element model capable of simulating ice fracturing. A microscopic-scale discrete process is applied in addition to a continuum ice dynamics model to investigate the mechanisms facilitated by basal meltwater production, surface meltwater and ice crack opening, for the surge in Basin 3, Austfonna ice cap. The discrete element model is used to locate the ice cracks that can penetrate though the full thickness of the glacier and deliver surface water to the bed.\n\nEffects of undercutting and sliding on calving: a global approach applied to Kronebreen, Svalbard\n\nDorothÃ©e Vallot, Jan Ã strÃ¶m, Thomas Zwinger, Rickard Pettersson, Alistair Everett, Douglas I. Benn, Adrian Luckman, Ward J. J. van Pelt, Faezeh Nick, and Jack Kohler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 609–625, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-609-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-609-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a new perspective on the role of ice dynamics and ocean interaction in glacier calving processes applied to Kronebreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard. A global modelling approach includes ice flow modelling, undercutting estimation by a combination of glacier energy balance and plume modelling as well as calving by a discrete particle model. We show that modelling undercutting is necessary and calving is influenced by basal friction velocity and geometry.\n\nCenturies of intense surface melt on Larsen C Ice Shelf\n\nSuzanne L. Bevan, Adrian Luckman, Bryn Hubbard, Bernd Kulessa, David Ashmore, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Martin O'Leary, Adam Booth, Heidi Sevestre, and Daniel McGrath\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2743–2753, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2743-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2743-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFive 90 m boreholes drilled into an Antarctic Peninsula ice shelf show units of ice that are denser than expected and must have formed from refrozen surface melt which has been buried and transported downstream. We used surface flow speeds and snow accumulation rates to work out where and when these units formed. Results show that, as well as recent surface melt, a period of strong melt occurred during the 18th century. Surface melt is thought to be a factor in causing recent ice-shelf break-up.\n\nRapidly changing subglacial hydrological pathways at a tidewater glacier revealed through simultaneous observations of water pressure, supraglacial lakes, meltwater plumes and surface velocities\n\nPenelope How, Douglas I. Benn, Nicholas R. J. Hulton, Bryn Hubbard, Adrian Luckman, HeÃ¯di Sevestre, Ward J. J. van Pelt, Katrin LindbÃ¤ck, Jack Kohler, and Wim Boot\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2691–2710, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2691-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2691-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides valuable insight into subglacial hydrology and dynamics at tidewater glaciers, which remains a poorly understood area of glaciology. It is a unique study because of the wealth of information provided by simultaneous observations of glacier hydrology at Kronebreen, a tidewater glacier in Svalbard. All these elements build a strong conceptual picture of the glacier's hydrological regime over the 2014 melt season.\n\nIce shelf fracture parameterization in an ice sheet model\n\nSainan Sun, Stephen L. Cornford, John C. Moore, Rupert Gladstone, and Liyun Zhao\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2543–2554, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2543-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2543-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe buttressing effect of the floating ice shelves is diminished by the fracture process. We developed a continuum damage mechanics model component of the ice sheet model to simulate the process. The model is tested on an ideal marine ice sheet geometry. We find that behavior of the simulated marine ice sheet is sensitive to fracture processes on the ice shelf, and the stiffness of ice around the grounding line is essential to ice sheet evolution.\n\nObservationally constrained surface mass balance of Larsen C ice shelf, Antarctica\n\nPeter Kuipers Munneke, Daniel McGrath, Brooke Medley, Adrian Luckman, Suzanne Bevan, Bernd Kulessa, Daniela Jansen, Adam Booth, Paul Smeets, Bryn Hubbard, David Ashmore, Michiel Van den Broeke, Heidi Sevestre, Konrad Steffen, Andrew Shepherd, and Noel Gourmelen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2411–2426, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2411-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2411-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow much snow falls on the Larsen C ice shelf? This is a relevant question, because this ice shelf might collapse sometime this century. To know if and when this could happen, we found out how much snow falls on its surface. This was difficult, because there are only very few measurements. Here, we used data from automatic weather stations, sled-pulled radars, and a climate model to find that melting the annual snowfall produces about 20 cm of water in the NE and over 70 cm in the SW.\n\nStructure and evolution of the drainage system of aÂ HimalayanÂ debris-covered glacier, and its relationshipÂ withÂ patternsÂ ofÂ massÂ loss\n\nDouglas I. Benn, Sarah Thompson, Jason Gulley, Jordan Mertes, Adrian Luckman, and Lindsey Nicholson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2247–2264, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2247-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2247-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper provides the first complete view of the drainage system of a large Himalayan glacier, based on ice-cave exploration and satellite image analysis. Drainage tunnels inside glaciers have a major impact on melting rates, by providing lines of weakness inside the ice and potential pathways for melt-water, and play a key role in the response of debris-covered glaciers to sustained periods of negative mass balance.\n\nRegional modeling of the Shirase drainage basin, East Antarctica: full Stokes vs. shallow ice dynamics\n\nHakime Seddik, Ralf Greve, Thomas Zwinger, and Shin Sugiyama\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2213–2229, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2213-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2213-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Shirase Glacier in Antarctica is studied by means of a computer model. This model implements two physical approaches to represent the glacier flow dynamics. This study finds that it is important to use the more precise and sophisticated method in order to better understand and predict the evolution of fast flowing glaciers. This may be important to more accurately predict the sea level change due to global warming.\n\nGenerating synthetic fjord bathymetry for coastal Greenland\n\nChristopher N. Williams, Stephen L. Cornford, Thomas M. Jordan, Julian A. Dowdeswell, Martin J. Siegert, Christopher D. Clark, Darrel A. Swift, Andrew Sole, Ian Fenty, and Jonathan L. Bamber\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 363–380, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-363-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-363-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKnowledge of ice sheet bed topography and surrounding sea floor bathymetry is integral to the understanding of ice sheet processes. Existing elevation data products for Greenland underestimate fjord bathymetry due to sparse data availability. We present a new method to create physically based synthetic fjord bathymetry to fill these gaps, greatly improving on previously available datasets. This will assist in future elevation product development until further observations become available.\n\nMarine ice sheet model performance depends on basal sliding physics and sub-shelf melting\n\nRupert Michael Gladstone, Roland Charles Warner, Benjamin Keith Galton-Fenzi, Olivier Gagliardini, Thomas Zwinger, and Ralf Greve\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 319–329, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-319-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-319-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComputer models are used to simulate the behaviour of glaciers and ice sheets. It has been found that such models are required to be run at very high resolution (which means high computational expense) in order to accurately represent the evolution of marine ice sheets (ice sheets resting on bedrock below sea level), in certain situations which depend on sub-glacial physical processes.\n\nIn situ field measurements of the temporal evolution of low-frequency sea-ice dielectric properties in relation to temperature, salinity, and microstructure\n\nMegan O'Sadnick, Malcolm Ingham, Hajo Eicken, and Erin Pettit\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 2923–2940, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2923-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2923-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNon-destructive in situ monitoring of sea-ice microstructure is of value to sea-ice research and operations but remains elusive to date. We relate in situ measurements of sea-ice dielectric properties at frequencies of 10 to 95 Hz to ice temperature, salinity, and microstructure. Results support the possible use of low-frequency electric measurements to monitor the seasonal evolution of brine volume fraction, pore volume, and connectivity of pore space in sea ice.\n\nExperimental design for three interrelated marine ice sheet and ocean model intercomparison projects: MISMIP v. 3 (MISMIP +), ISOMIP v. 2 (ISOMIP +) and MISOMIP v. 1 (MISOMIP1)\n\nXylar S.

Such models have a broad range of potential applications in studying the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers, including assessing their contributions to sea level change. Here we describe the idealized experiments that make up three interrelated Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) for marine ice sheet models and regional ocean circulation models incorporating ice shelf cavities.\n\nCentury-scale simulations of the response of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to a warming climate\n\nS.

This is computationally demanding, and although other groups have considered parts of West Antarctica, we think this is the first calculation for the whole region at the sub-kilometer resolution that we show is required.\n\nNumerical simulations and observations of the role of katabatic winds in the creation and maintenance of Scharffenbergbotnen blue ice area, Antarctica\n\nT. Zwinger, T. Malm, M. SchÃ¤fer, R. Stenberg, and J. C.

A further simulation of a reconstructed topography at the Late Glacial Maximum further reveals that the BIA at SBB must have formed after this period.\n\nBrief Communication: Newly developing rift in Larsen C Ice Shelf presents significant risk to stability\n\nD.

In this study we present the development of the rift as derived from remote sensing data and assess the impact of possible calving scenarios on the future stability of the Larsen C Ice Shelf, using a numerical model. We find that the calving front is likely to become unstable after the anticipated calving events.\n\nConfiguration of the Northern Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet at LGM based on a new synthesis of seabed imagery\n\nC.

We find that this method works similarly to previous methods by assessing 13 sites and the Larsen C ice shelf. Unlike previous methods, this algorithm is based on physical parameters, and updates to this method could allow the meltwater present on the Antarctic Ice Sheet to be quantified instead of simply detected.\n\nBrief communication: Precision measurement of the index of refraction of deep glacial ice at radio frequencies at Summit Station, Greenland\n\nChristoph Welling and The RNO-G Collaboration\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3433–3437, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3433-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3433-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report on the measurement of the index of refraction in glacial ice at radio frequencies. We show that radio echoes from within the ice can be associated with specific features of the ice conductivity and use this to determine the wave velocity. This measurement is especially relevant for the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G), a neutrino detection experiment currently under construction at Summit Station, Greenland.\n\nWidespread increase in discharge from west Antarctic Peninsula glaciers since 2018\n\nBenjamin J.

The speed-up began around January 2021, but some glaciers sped up earlier or later. Using a combination of ship-based ocean temperature observations and climate models, we show that the speed-up coincided with a period of unusually warm air and ocean temperatures in the region.\n\nSurface dynamics and history of the calving cycle of Astrolabe Glacier (AdÃ©lie Coast, Antarctica) derived from satellite imagery\n\nFloriane Provost, Dimitri Zigone, Emmanuel Le Meur, Jean-Philippe Malet, and ClÃ©ment Hibert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3067–3079, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3067-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3067-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe recent calving of Astrolabe Glacier in November 2021 presents an opportunity to better understand the processes leading to ice fracturing. Optical-satellite imagery is used to retrieve the calving cycle of the glacier ice tongue and to measure the ice velocity and strain rates in order to document fracture evolution. We observed that the presence of sea ice for consecutive years has favoured the glacier extension but failed to inhibit the growth of fractures that accelerated in June 2021.\n\nWeak relationship between remotely detected crevasses and inferred ice rheological parameters on Antarctic ice shelves\n\nCristina Gerli, Sebastian Rosier, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, and Sainan Sun\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2677–2689, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2677-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2677-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecent efforts have focused on using AI and satellite imagery to track crevasses for assessing ice shelf damage and informing ice flow models. Our study reveals a weak connection between these observed products and damage maps inferred from ice flow models. While there is some improvement in crevasse-dense regions, this association remains limited. Directly mapping ice damage from satellite observations may not significantly improve the representation of these processes within ice flow models.\n\nExtensive palaeo-surfaces beneath the EvansâRutford region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet control modern and past ice flow\n\nCharlotte M. Carter, Michael J. Bentley, Stewart S. R. Jamieson, Guy J. G. Paxman, Tom A. Jordan, Julien A. Bodart, Neil Ross, and Felipe Napoleoni\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2277–2296, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2277-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2277-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use radio-echo sounding data to investigate the presence of flat surfaces beneath the Evans–Rutford region in West Antarctica. These surfaces may be what remains of laterally continuous surfaces, formed before the inception of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and we assess two hypotheses for their formation. Tectonic structures in the region may have also had a control on the growth of the ice sheet by focusing ice flow into troughs adjoining these surfaces.\n\nTowards the systematic reconnaissance of seismic signals from glaciers and ice sheets â Part 1: Event detection for cryoseismology\n\nRebecca B. Latto, Ross J. Turner, Anya M. Reading, and J. Paul Winberry\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2061–2079, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2061-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2061-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study of icequakes allows for investigation of many glacier processes that are unseen by typical reconnaissance methods. However, detection of such seismic signals is challenging due to low signal-to-noise levels and diverse source mechanisms. Here we present a novel algorithm that is optimized to detect signals from a glacier environment. We apply the algorithm to seismic data recorded in the 2010–2011 austral summer from the Whillans Ice Stream and evaluate the resulting event catalogue.\n\nTowards the systematic reconnaissance of seismic signals from glaciers and ice sheets â Part 2: Unsupervised learning for source process characterization\n\nRebecca B. Latto, Ross J. Turner, Anya M. Reading, Sue Cook, Bernd Kulessa, and J. Paul Winberry\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2081–2101, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2081-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2081-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeismic catalogues are potentially rich sources of information on glacier processes. In a companion study, we constructed an event catalogue for seismic data from the Whillans Ice Stream. Here, we provide a semi-automated workflow for consistent catalogue analysis using an unsupervised cluster analysis. We discuss the defining characteristics of identified signal types found in this catalogue and possible mechanisms for the underlying glacier processes and noise sources.\n\nGeometric amplification and suppression of ice-shelf basal melt in West Antarctica\n\nJan De Rydt and Kaitlin Naughten\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1863–1888, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1863-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1863-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing ice at an accelerating pace. This is largely due to the presence of warm ocean water around the periphery of the Antarctic continent, which melts the ice. It is generally assumed that the strength of this process is controlled by the temperature of the ocean. However, in this study we show that an equally important role is played by the changing geometry of the ice sheet, which affects the strength of the ocean currents and thereby the melt rates.\n\nAlpine topography of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, Antarctica, mapped from ice sheet surface morphology\n\nEdmund J. Lea, Stewart S. R. Jamieson, and Michael J. Bentley\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1733–1751, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1733-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1733-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use the ice surface expression of the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in East Antarctica to map the horizontal pattern of valleys and ridges in finer detail than possible from previous methods. In upland areas, valleys are spaced much less than 5 km apart, with consequences for the distribution of melting at the bed and hence the likelihood of ancient ice being preserved. Automated mapping techniques were tested alongside manual approaches, with a hybrid approach recommended for future work.\n\nMelt sensitivity of irreversible retreat of Pine Island Glacier\n\nBrad Reed, J. A. Mattias Green, Adrian Jenkins, and G. Hilmar Gudmundsson\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-673,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-673, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a numerical ice-flow model to simulate the response of a 1940s Pine Island Glacier to changes in melting beneath its ice shelf. A decadal period of warm forcing is sufficient to push the glacier into an unstable, irreversible retreat from its long-term position on a subglacial ridge to an upstream ice plain. This retreat can only be stopped when unrealistic cold forcing is applied. These results show that short warm anomalies can lead to quick and substantial increases in ice flux.\n\nThe effect of ice rheology on shelf edge bending\n\nW. Roger Buck\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-557,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-557, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStandard theory predicts that the edge of an ice shelf should bend downward. Satellite observations show that the edges of many ice shelves bend upward. A new theory for ice shelf bending is developed that, for the first time, includes the kind of vertical variations in ice flow properties expected for ice shelves. Upward bending of shelf edges is predicted as long as the ice surface is very cold and the ice flow properties depend strongly on temperature.\n\nImpact of boundary conditions on the modeled thermal regime of the Antarctic ice sheet\n\nIn-Woo Park, Emilia Kyung Jin, Mathieu Morlighem, and Kang-Kun Lee\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1139–1155, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study conducted 3D thermodynamic ice sheet model experiments, and modeled temperatures were compared with 15 observed borehole temperature profiles. We found that using incompressibility of ice without sliding agrees well with observed temperature profiles in slow-flow regions, while incorporating sliding in fast-flow regions captures observed temperature profiles. Also, the choice of vertical velocity scheme has a greater impact on the shape of the modeled temperature profile.\n\nHysteresis of idealized, instability-prone outlet glaciers under variation of pinning-point buttressing\n\nJohannes Feldmann, Anders Levermann, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-457,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-457, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we show in simplified simulations that the (ir)reversibility of the retreat of instability-prone, Antarctic-type glaciers can strongly depend on the depth of the bed depression they rest on. If it is sufficiently deep, then the destabilized glacier does not recover from its collapsed state. Our results suggest that the wide and deep bed depression under West Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier might promote potential future unstable retreat and hamper possible re-advance of the glacier.\n\nThe staggered retreat of grounded ice in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)\n\nMatthew A. Danielson and Philip J. Bart\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1125–1138, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1125-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1125-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in the Ross Sea was more significant than for any other Antarctic sector. Here we combined the available dates of retreat with new mapping of sediment deposited by the ice sheet during overall retreat. Our work shows that the post-LGM retreat through the Ross Sea was not uniform. This uneven retreat can cause instability in the present-day Antarctic ice sheet configuration and lead to future runaway retreat.\n\nThe effect of landfast sea ice buttressing on ice dynamic speedup in the Larsen B embayment, Antarctica\n\nTrystan Surawy-Stepney, Anna E. Hogg, Stephen L. Cornford, Benjamin J. Wallis, Benjamin J. Davison, Heather L. Selley, Ross A. W. Slater, Elise K. Lie, Livia Jakob, Andrew Ridout, Noel Gourmelen, Bryony I. D. Freer, Sally F. Wilson, and Andrew Shepherd\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 977–993, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-977-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-977-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we use satellite observations and an ice flow model to quantify the impact of sea ice buttressing on ice streams on the Antarctic Peninsula. The evacuation of 11-year-old landfast sea ice in the Larsen B embayment on the East Antarctic Peninsula in January 2022 was closely followed by major changes in the calving behaviour and acceleration (30 %) of the ocean-terminating glaciers. Our results show that sea ice buttressing had a negligible direct role in the observed dynamic changes.\n\nMeteoric water and glacial melt in the southeastern Amundsen Sea: a time series from 1994 to 2020\n\nAndrew N. Hennig, David A. Mucciarone, Stanley S. Jacobs, Richard A. Mortlock, and Robert B. Dunbar\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 791–818, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-791-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-791-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA total of 937 seawater paired oxygen isotope (δ18O)–salinity samples collected during seven cruises on the SE Amundsen Sea between 1994 and 2020 reveal a deep freshwater source with δ18O − 29.4±1.0‰, consistent with the signature of local ice shelf melt. Local mean meteoric water content – comprised primarily of glacial meltwater – increased between 1994 and 2020 but exhibited greater interannual variability than increasing trend.\n\nEvaporative controls on Antarctic precipitation: an ECHAM6 model study using innovative water tracer diagnostics\n\nQinggang Gao, Louise C. Sime, Alison J. McLaren, Thomas J. Bracegirdle, Emilie Capron, Rachael H. Rhodes, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Xiaoxu Shi, and Martin Werner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 683–703, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-683-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-683-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctic precipitation is a crucial component of the climate system. Its spatio-temporal variability impacts sea level changes and the interpretation of water isotope measurements in ice cores. To better understand its climatic drivers, we developed water tracers in an atmospheric model to identify moisture source conditions from which precipitation originates. We find that mid-latitude surface winds exert an important control on moisture availability for Antarctic precipitation.\n\nDisentangling the drivers of future Antarctic ice loss with a historically calibrated ice-sheet model\n\nViolaine Coulon, Ann Kristin Klose, Christoph Kittel, Tamsin Edwards, Fiona Turner, Ricarda Winkelmann, and Frank Pattyn\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 653–681, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-653-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-653-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present new projections of the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet until the end of the millennium, calibrated with observations. We show that the ocean will be the main trigger of future ice loss. As temperatures continue to rise, the atmosphere's role may shift from mitigating to amplifying Antarctic mass loss already by the end of the century. For high-emission scenarios, this may lead to substantial sea-level rise. Adopting sustainable practices would however reduce the rate of ice loss.\n\nFeedback mechanisms controlling Antarctic glacial cycle dynamics simulated with a coupled ice sheet–solid Earth model\n\nTorsten Albrecht, Meike Bagge, and Volker Klemann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2990,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2990, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed coupled ice sheet – solid Earth simulations and discovered a positive (forebulge) feedback mechanisms for advancing grounding lines, supporting a comparably larger West Antarctic Ice Sheet at Last Glacial Maximum. During deglaciation we found the stabilizing GIA feedback to dominate grounding line retreat in the Ross Sea, where a weak Earth structure is prevalent. This may have consequences for the contemporary and future ice sheet stability and potential rates of sea level rise.\n\nInsights into the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers from the ISMIP6 ice sheet model ensemble and associated uncertainty\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Vincent Verjans, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

Trusel, Jonas Van Breedam, Peter Van Katwyk, Roderik S. W. van de Wal, Ricarda Winkelmann, Chen Zhao, Tong Zhang, and Thomas Zwinger\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5197–5217, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5197-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5197-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMass loss from Antarctica is a key contributor to sea level rise over the 21st century, and the associated uncertainty dominates sea level projections. We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nEvaluation of four calving laws for Antarctic ice shelves\n\nJoel A. Wilner, Mathieu Morlighem, and Gong Cheng\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4889–4901, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4889-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4889-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use numerical modeling to study iceberg calving off of ice shelves in Antarctica. We examine four widely used mathematical descriptions of calving (calving laws), under the assumption that Antarctic ice shelf front positions should be in steady state under the current climate forcing. We quantify how well each of these calving laws replicates the observed front positions. Our results suggest that the eigencalving and von Mises laws are most suitable for Antarctic ice shelves.\n\nEnglacial architecture of Lambert Glacier, East Antarctica\n\nRebecca J. Sanderson, Kate Winter, S. Louise Callard, Felipe Napoleoni, Neil Ross, Tom A. Jordan, and Robert G. Bingham\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4853–4871, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4853-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4853-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-penetrating radar allows us to explore the internal structure of glaciers and ice sheets to constrain past and present ice-flow conditions. In this paper, we examine englacial layers within the Lambert Glacier in East Antarctica using a quantitative layer tracing tool. Analysis reveals that the ice flow here has been relatively stable, but evidence for former fast flow along a tributary suggests that changes have occurred in the past and could change again in the future.\n\nMass changes of the northern Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet derived from repeat bi-static synthetic aperture radar acquisitions for the period 2013â2017\n\nThorsten Seehaus, Christian Sommer, Thomas Dethinne, and Philipp Malz\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4629–4644, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4629-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4629-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExisting mass budget estimates for the northern Antarctic Peninsula (>70° S) are affected by considerable limitations. We carried out the first region-wide analysis of geodetic mass balances throughout this region (coverage of 96.4 %) for the period 2013–2017 based on repeat pass bi-static TanDEM-X acquisitions. A total mass budget of −24.1±2.8 Gt/a is revealed. Imbalanced high ice discharge, particularly at former ice shelf tributaries, is the main driver of overall ice loss.\n\nThe evolution of future Antarctic surface melt using PISM-dEBM-simple\n\nJulius Garbe, Maria Zeitz, Uta Krebs-Kanzow, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4571–4599, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4571-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4571-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe adopt the novel surface module dEBM-simple in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) to investigate the impact of atmospheric warming on Antarctic surface melt and long-term ice sheet dynamics. As an enhancement compared to traditional temperature-based melt schemes, the module accounts for changes in ice surface albedo and thus the melt–albedo feedback. Our results underscore the critical role of ice–atmosphere feedbacks in the future sea-level contribution of Antarctica on long timescales.\n\nCharacteristics and rarity of the strong 1940s westerly wind event over the Amundsen Sea, West Antarctica\n\nGemma K. O'Connor, Paul R. Holland, Eric J. Steig, Pierre Dutrieux, and Gregory J. Hakim\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4399–4420, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4399-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4399-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers in West Antarctica are rapidly melting, but the causes are unknown due to limited observations. A leading hypothesis is that an unusually large wind event in the 1940s initiated the ocean-driven melting. Using proxy reconstructions (e.g., using ice cores) and climate model simulations, we find that w"
