        "text": "Researchers found that the Thwaites Glacier is melting faster than expected.\n\nPesaCheck\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nPesaCheck\n\n·\n\n4 min read\n\n·\n\nNov 30, 2022\n\n--\n\nAn article claiming that the Thwaites Glacier is retreating at a slower rate is FALSE.\n\nAccording to the article’s headline, scientists have found a “massive recent slowdown in melting” of the Antarctic glacier commonly referred to as the “doomsday glacier”.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier is seen as a barometer for rising sea levels due to climate change. Researchers have found that the glacier has had a net loss of 1,000 billion tonnes of ice since 2000.\n\nThe article further claims “human-caused climate change was not a factor in the faster retreat”.\n\nThe article based its claims on a research paper in Nature Geoscience. The story was also shared on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHowever, the article is misleading and represents a selective reading of the research results.\n\nThe researchers’ paper examined the sea floor beneath the glacier. They analysed ridges formed on the seabed by the daily lifting and setting of the glacier due to tides. They compared these to “the bump”, a prominent promontory or cape on the seafloor when the glacier was far more advanced than today.\n\nTheir analysis found: “Our results indicate that the rate of retreat from the bump was double the average estimated for the period 1996 to 2009, and about three times faster than a location immediately inland of the bump between 2011 and 2017”.\n\nBut, their findings do not have an exact time. According to Alastair Graham, the lead author of the study, their results occurred over a five-month period some time “in the last two centuries, and possibly as recently as the mid-20th Century”. The claim that there has been a “massive recent slowdown” in the retreat of the glacier is thus not true.\n\nThe researchers warn that the rapid retreat they found represents an “upper speed limit” for expecting the behaviour of the glacier in future. Moreover, scientists warn that pulses of retreat such as they found may recur and rapidly.\n\n“Thwaites is really holding on today by its fingernails, and we should expect to see big changes over small timescales in the future — even from one year to the next — once the glacier retreats beyond a shallow ridge in its bed,” said Robert Larter, a co-author of the study.\n\nOther researchers found that the glacier is shedding “75bn tons of ice every year, and the rate is increasing”.\n\nThe article also falsely claims that global warming is a natural process. The United States’ National Aeronautics and Space Agency found it is not.\n\nPesaCheck has examined an article claiming that the Thwaites Glacier’s retreat is slowing down and finds it to be FALSE.\n\nThis post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.\n\nBy partnering with Facebook and similar social media platforms, third-party fact-checking organisations like PesaCheck are helping to sort fact from fiction. We do this by giving the public deeper insight and context to posts they see in their social media feeds.\n\nHave you spotted what you think is fake or false information on Facebook? Here’s how you can report. And, here’s more information on PesaCheck’s methodology for fact-checking questionable content.\n\nThis fact-check was written by PesaCheck climate change fact-checker Christiaan van der Merwe and edited by PesaCheck senior copy editor Cédrick Irakoze and acting chief copy editor Francis Mwaniki.\n\nThe article was approved for publication by PesaCheck’s managing editor Doreen Wainainah.\n\nPesaCheck is East Africa’s first public finance fact-checking initiative. It was co-founded by Catherine Gicheru and Justin Arenstein, and is being incubated by the continent’s largest civic technology and data journalism accelerator: Code for Africa. It seeks to help the public separate fact from fiction in public pronouncements about the numbers that shape our world, with a special emphasis on pronouncements about public finances that shape government’s delivery of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) public services, such as healthcare, rural development and access to water / sanitation. PesaCheck also tests the accuracy of media reportage.
