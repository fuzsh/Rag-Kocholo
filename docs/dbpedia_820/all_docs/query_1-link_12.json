        "text": "#Zoomposium with Prof. Dr. Thomas #Naumann and Dr. Ilja #Bohnet \"The mysterious universe: The fundamental questions of modern science\" In this further installment of our \"Zoomposium Interview Series\" (https://lnkd.in/eXmYtQxj), my colleague Axel St√∂cker from the \"Blog der gro√üen Fragen\" and I had the great honor and pleasure to interview two proven experts in the field of physical research and experts in communicating scientific research results. Professor Dr. Thomas Naumann and Dr. Ilja Bohnet come from the field of particle physics research and know each other from their joint work at DESY (\"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron\") Zeuthen-Berlin. Not only through their work in physics research, but also through their interest in the exciting communication of scientific results, the desire has been awakened in both of them to make these \"fundamental questions of modern science\" accessible to a broader audience one day in the form of publications. More at: https://lnkd.in/eZARvJQb or: https://lnkd.in/eJYxDyEH There is an orange translation button \"Translate>>\" at the bottom left.\n\nPhysics can build a better world - and it's the people working in #physics who make that better world a reality. We launched the Physics Inclusion Award yesterday which was designed in partnership with the physics community to ensure that everyone in physics is welcomed and supported. This blog by Prof Nicola Wilkin PFHEA FInstP, Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham and Chair of the Physics Inclusion Award Steering Group, and IOP's Head of EDI Sarah Bakewell, explains why and how we developed and launched the Award. Read it here: https://lnkd.in/e3AKEpYy\n\nFascinating update from the world of STEM! JILA and NIST Fellow Jun Ye and his team have made a groundbreaking stride in our understanding of atomic clocks, the most precise timekeepers in the universe. Their study, published in Science, sheds light on the complex light-atom interactions within these clocks. Such research is vital for our scientific progress and is a testament to the power of STEM. Keep exploring and who knows - one day you might be part of such monumental discoveries!\n\nWhat does a MODEST person look like? This is what it looks like (it's a short clip showing the first reaction of one of this year's Nobel Prize winners): https://lnkd.in/dJ8Chb7K ‚≠ê Why do I follow the The Nobel Prize every year? Why do I find this fascinating and follow it still for many weeks after the announcement? üî≠ Because this time is an informal international celebration of science. üë©üî¨ This is the time when the whole world learns about important discoveries and gets to know the people behind them. Such as Anne L'Huillier and many others. üß† This is the time when we get access to excellently prepared popular science materials, thanks to which the promotion of knowledge becomes easier, example: https://lnkd.in/df9By7Y3 After all, we know that science is not about winning prizes, but I always hope that this time is an inspiration for thousands of others for whom science is (or may become) passion. #knowledge #knowledgeispower #science #nobelprize #inspiration #innovation #technology"
