        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe challenges of small field dosimetry in photon beams have been investigated for more than two decades [1], [2] and gained importance with the implementation of advanced treatment techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), stereotactic (body) radiotherapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The main issues in accurate determination of field OFs in these beams are the loss of lateral charged particle equilibrium and source occlusion, as well as detector related effects such as volume averaging and the difference between the density of the detector material and water [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In 2008, Alfonso et al. introduced a formalism on the determination of small field OFs using detector and field size specific correction factors [10]. Several research groups have investigated these factors for a wide range of passive and active detectors [7], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Recently, a new code of practice on small static fields used in external beam radiotherapy has been published [16].\n\nAccurate experimental determination of OFs in small fields is only one component of the TPS to calculate the dose correctly. The other part is the implementation or modelling of these OFs in a TPS, which is critical for the dose calculation accuracy. Dose calculation algorithms have evolved from simple factor based dose calculation as found in [17], [18], to model-based algorithms [3], [19], [20], [21], [22], stochastic linear Boltzmann transport equation solvers such as Monte Carlo algorithms [23], and deterministic linear Boltzmann transport equation solvers [24], [25]. These model-based algorithms rely on an accurate source model describing the energy fluence entering the patient for a given aperture. Source models are usually optimized based on basic beam data provided by the user. For the optimization of small field OFs, e.g. for an accurate modelling of the penumbra, the aforementioned effects in small fields have to be considered. It is expected that the accuracy of source models for small fields will increase with improvements in the measurement accuracy of small fields accounting for ion chamber and fluence corrections [3], provided that manufacturers are willing to optimize their source models for small fields. However, small field calculations for TPSs are usually not the focus of standard commissioning procedures and therefore may be prone to errors.\n\nNational and international organizations have provided recommendations on acceptance testing, commissioning and quality assurance of medical TPSs [26], [27], [28]. These documents outline the individual steps in validating the general functionality of the TPS and especially dose calculation accuracy. All of these documents recommend the verification of OFs by recalculation and comparison against measurements as OFs have a direct impact on the number of monitor units necessary to deliver the prescribed dose. E.g. TECDOC-1583 suggests the comparison of calculated and measured OFs for field sizes ranging from 3 × 3 cm2 to 40 × 40 cm2 using a tolerance of ±2% [27]. A comprehensive data set on small field OFs of various treatment machines produced by different vendors has been determined by the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core Houston QA Centre (IROC-Houston QA Centre, formerly the Radiological Physics Centre). OFs were measured for field sizes down to 2 × 2 cm2 at a depth of 10 cm in water at 100 cm SSD on more than 150 linear accelerators as a part of the on-site visits. These measurements were made using a cylindrical ionization chamber. The measured OFs were grouped according to energy and linear accelerator manufacturer. Even when grouped across multiple accelerator models, the measured OFs were highly consistent for a given energy and manufacturer. The average standard deviation of the output factor for a given manufacturer and energy was less than 0.5% except for the 2 × 2 cm2 fields which was 0.7%, indicating that the reference OFs were highly consistent and descriptive of the linacs. Besides that, average differences between calculated and measured output factors for the 2 × 2 cm2 field ranging from 1.3% to 5.8% depending on the linac vendor and beam energy were observed [29], [30].\n\nA coordinated research project was launched to develop audit methodologies for testing the implementation of treatment techniques with different complexities. The aim of this project was to make these methodologies available to national external audit groups and assist them with the local development of these audits. In particular, dosimetry audit of small fields was of interest because of the prevalence of difficulties both in conducting small field dose measurements as well as in computing them. One contributing factor to observed errors with small fields is the agreement between calculated and measured lateral small beam profiles. Discrepancies of more than 3 mm have been observed which could potentially lead to an unsatisfactory accuracy in dose calculation of advanced treatment techniques [31]. Another aspect is the accuracy of calculated small field output factors (OFs) using treatment planning systems (TPSs) employed in clinical practice, which is focus of this work.\n\nThe results of this audit, which was designed within a multinational coordinated research project, tested with national audit groups in a multi-centre setting and implemented on a national level in a few countries, are given.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis simple audit methodology allows a quick assessment of the accuracy of the employed dose calculation algorithm and beam model in small photon fields. Particularly for advanced radiotherapy such as IMRT, SBRT and SRS, the use of small fields is common, and so the accuracy of small field OFs directly impacts the accuracy of patient dose calculation. Naturally, these are not the only contributing factors to the dose calculation accuracy of TPSs for treatments, other factors, such as tissue heterogeneity, have a substantial impact as well. Nevertheless, small field OFs must be verified as an integral part of the TPS commissioning process. Such testing ensures accurate values, and also helps to identify the limits of the employed beam model in terms of minimum field size. Most TPSs allow the specification of parameters, e.g. minimum segment area or minimum leaf gap, which prevent the use of field sizes too small for accurate dose delivery.\n\nSeparating the results by nominal beam energy revealed a rate of results exceeding the action limit of 30% for the 2 × 2 cm2 field for beams with nominal beam energy of 6 MV, compared to 31% for beam energies higher than 6 MV for the audit performed on national levels, which is consistent with observations during the multicentre run. The majority of data was provided for the combination Varian linac – Eclipse for a nominal Energy of 6 MV. This particular combination was characterized by a mean 2 × 2 cm2 field calculated to reference OFs ratio of 1.030 and a standard deviation of the mean of 0.003 for the national run. Kerns et al. also reported measured OFs being consistently lower than TPS calculated OFs, on average 1.6% over field sizes ranging from 2 × 2 cm2 to 6 × 6 cm2 with 64% showing a discrepancy larger than 1% [32]. For the 2 × 2 cm2 field, standard deviations of up to 7.9% for OFs calculated by institutions have been reported by Followill et al. [29], [30].\n\nEclipse allows the user to perform beam modelling autonomously without interacting with the TPS manufacturer, which could be the reason for the larger offset and spread of data. In order to model small fields adequately in Eclipse, head scatter parameters need to be adjusted and after that, the dose calculation accuracy needs to be verified for all field sizes [30], [33]. For other TPSs, e.g. Monaco or Oncentra for Elekta machines, for which the beam modelling process is performed by the manufacturers based on basic beam data provided by the users the mean ratio is more accurate compared to Eclipse. This should not mean that accurate beam modelling is not possible using Eclipse, but that generating beam models for small beams is a task which needs to be performed carefully and that assistance by the manufacturers can improve the results. There are examples in the literature [34] and also in this data set (see ) where good agreement between calculated and published OFs was achieved for the combination Varian linac and Eclipse TPS. For Monaco the mean ratio of the 2 × 2 cm2 field was significantly higher than unity, indicating that there is also room for improvement. In principle, this dataset might allow institutions to understand potential limitations in beam modelling of their treatment machines, and refinements of the investigated dose calculation algorithms in general, but this would go beyond the scope of this work.\n\nAnother reason for the increasing deviation of calculated OFs compared to reference OFs can be that the input data used to determine the beam model parameters did not extend to small fields. Some TPSs rely solely on measurements of relatively larger fields (e.g., only as small as a 4 × 4 cm2 field) and then extrapolate for smaller field sizes. A similar situation can appear when a TPS was initially commissioned for large fields only and the recommissioning of the system was not performed for the introduction of treatment techniques using small fields. Moreover, the input data could have deviated substantially from reference data either due to actual machine characteristics or inaccurate data acquisition. As part of the follow-up for beams exceeding the action limit, the institutions were asked to provide measured OFs for small beams. Only eight follow-up results were available at the time when this paper was written, therefore a final conclusion cannot be drawn. However, the majority of follow-up results showed an agreement of measured OFs by the institutions with reference OFs within the expected uncertainty, which was also found in the multicentre run. For one institution where a substantial deviation from reference OFs was found, the calculated OFs were higher and measured OFs were lower compared to reference data. It was determined that the institution had used a detector which was not suitable for the field size and the experimental data were either implemented incorrectly or not considered at all. Results thus far have consistently shown that the reference values have been accurate representations of the linacs examined, within the expected uncertainties of the reference set.\n\nOn average, the ratio of calculated OFs to reference OFs are higher than unity and increase with decreasing field size. This suggests that the dose in small fields calculated by TPSs is frequently overestimated. Effects on the dosimetric quality of the patients’ treatment plans depend on the applied treatment technique. For example, for stereotactic treatments the deviations of calculated OFs compared to actual OFs can add up to unacceptable levels as the treatment plans consists mainly of small fields. This may or may not be the case for static and dynamic IMRT techniques since these treatment techniques consist of a combination of large and small fields. IROC-Houston QA Centre recently commissioned a recalculation system based on the data collected during on-site visits. This system was used to recalculate more than 200 treatment plans for their head and neck IMRT phantom audit and revealed that 17% of the investigated treatment plans had considerable calculation errors. Considering only those institutions who failed IROC-Houston’s acceptance criteria for irradiation of the head and neck phantom, 68% had calculation errors [35]. While the underlying cause of these computational errors has yet to be elucidated, a contributing factor is potentially the high frequency of small field output factor errors.\n\nLooking at the data from a different perspective raises the question whether discrepancies between calculations and measurements can be explained by systematic errors in the reference data. Recently published correction factors for the A16 ion chamber [16] indicate this chamber is reliable for the investigated field sizes. Other publications using the same reference data have shown that the difference between calculated and measured output factors is more pronounced for fields limited by the MLC with the jaws open to a larger field size which is the more challenging situation compared to fields limited by jaws and MLC [32]. Therefore, the discrepancies are more likely to be caused by inaccurate dose calculation. This work was restricted to a minimum field sizes of 2 × 2 cm2 due the available reference data in [29,30]. Even larger deviations of calculated OFs compared to measured OFs can be expected for smaller field sizes, e.g. 1 × 1 cm2, necessitating even more careful commissioning of TPSs.\n\nIn conclusion, it has been shown that OFs of small photon fields generated by TPSs often differ substantially from measured reference OFs. The correct implementation of OFs of small fields in TPSs needs to be carefully validated by the user in light of the high frequency of this error. The methodology proposed in this work can be used for this purpose. Special care must be taken if the users alone are responsible for creating their beam model without the support of the TPS manufacturer. In any case, the final responsibility concerning the accuracy and utilization of the beam model lies with the clinical medical physicist."
