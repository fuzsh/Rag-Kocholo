Leader to be announced.\n\nMarch 1950\n\n(Page 1) HISTORY OF AYH\n\nIt is a long way from Westphalia, Germany to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and a long time from 1910 to 1950, but this is how far hosteling has traveled and how long the IDEA has endured. Indeed, that is precisely what hosteling is -- the idea that, given the opportunity to travel inexpensively and adventurously, the youth of the world would find health, happiness, and international understanding. With the tramp of a heavy boot on a mountain trail or the rush of fresh air against the cyclists' face, intolerance sinks to nothing, and impatience with one's fellow man disappears. Hosteling transcends the artificial boundaries of race, religion, and nationality and establishes that while there are differences between various groups, it does not follow that one is inferior to another.\n\nSomewhere in the deep conscience of the Westphalia school teacher, Richard Schirmann, these thoughts must have moved when he initiated the first youth hostels in country schools -- empty for the summer months. They surged irrepressibly through Western Europe so that hosteling was firmly rooted by 1933 when Isabel and Monroe Smith, of Northfield, Massachusetts, voyaged abroad to find and feel the import of this spirit new to the United States but not necessarily alien. Upon their return, they established the first American youth hostel in their home then, with a burning ambition to make hosteling a household word they began their expansion. New England, ideally suited because of natural beauty, small towns, and numerous academic centers, became the first hostelized area. It remains today the bulwark of the movement. But in due time, other national areas accepted the IDEA -- The Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest, the Great Smokies, and others. By the time the United States entered the recent war, hostels numbered 250 and passholders nearly 20,000. It was not a movement to be regarded lightly.\n\nHosteling swept Pennsylvania like a flood in the late 30's -- and mushrooming almost overnight was a chain of hostels along the Horseshoe trail from Harrisburg to Philadelphia and along the Appalachian trail from the Susquehanna to the Delaware Water Gap. A State Council was established in Philadelphia, as well as a local council in the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre area, Pittsburgh, too, felt the impact of AYH and, under the leadership of Horace F. Baker, eminent attorney, established a council in 1941, followed shortly thereafter by a model hostel in South Park.\n\nUnfortunately, great forces of evil were afoot in the world, and the thing hosteling opposed most -- WAR -- came to pass. Whole peoples relegated their pleasure and ideals to the back of their minds and united in an even greater effort. The United States was no exception. Amid the rubble of foreign communities lay ruined hostels. In this country, no physical destruction occurred but AYH membership and participation dropped markedly as did the number of hostels. Councils floundered and fell disorganized, and the newest groups, such as the one in Pittsburgh, were the first to go. In the aftermath, while foreign nations counted their broken buildings, American hosteling surveyed a terrible loss in everything but reputation, and, while not returned to its beginnings of 1933, faced a reconstruction problem of prime magnitude. With courage and new determination, however, the loose ends were gathered, the veterans of the movement were summoned and advised of the task which lay ahead, and deliberate reconstruction began.\n\nSix long years after the demise of the original Pittsburgh Council, a fledgling local group began anew on Washington's Birthday, 1948, to hold hikes intended eventually to expand to a full blown youth hostel movement. Simultaneously, Mr. Horace F. Baker invited a number of civic-minded citizens to a dinner at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Club in an effort at reorganization. This group, guided by professional AYH workers from New York, Philadelphia, and Northfield, constituted itself a steering committee to formulate a new organization. It resolved to emphasize hostelers and hosteling rather than hostels in its initial phases, and this sound policy paid dividends we are all happily reaping today.\n\nElsewhere in this annual report will be found detailed summaries of progress in 1949, a banner year for AYH in Pittsburgh. It was made possible through the selfless, unflinching devotion of many fine people to an IDEA. It has borne fruit because of active participation of all of you in activities which we firmly believe constitute a firm foundation, not only for priceless companionship at a local level, but for elimination of animosity in a far greater sphere. With your continued support and enthusiasm, hosteling in Pittsburgh will inevitably reach the high stature it proudly enjoys in the great cities of the East. The community will come to look on hosteling as an integral and valued part of the culture of mankind.\n\n(Page 3) BAKER TRAIL SONG (Tune: \"Field Artillery Song\")\n\nOver hill, over dale,\n\nOn the Horace Baker Trail,\n\nAs the hostelers go hiking along.\n\nPick 'em up, lay 'em down,\n\nLeave the stragglers back in town,\n\nAs the hostelers go hiking along.\n\nFor it's hi, hi, he,\n\nThough we're beat as you can see,\n\nWe sing out a lusty hiking song.\n\nIf a tourist comes by,\n\nWe'll ptui in his eye,\n\nAs the hostelers go hiking along.\n\n(Page 5) BAKER TRAIL\n\nIn the early Fall of 1949, the Board of Directors of the Pittsburgh Council authorized the construction of an extended trail to connect Pittsburgh with Cook Forest, an estimated distance of 125 miles. The trail was named the Horace F. Baker Trail in honor of the prominent Pittsburgh attorney who served as president of the first local council and whose guidance and assistance have played so prominent a part in the progress of the present Council.\n\nConstruction of the trail is accomplished in several steps. First, one or two scouts establish a logical route to be followed by a blazing party which marks the route with bright paint blazes on trees and rocks. The third step is the establishment of mileposts, to be followed by parties establishing campsites at regular intervals. The final refinement, of course, is the opening of hostels along the route.\n\nThe trail starts in Aspinwall and roughly parallels the Allegheny River to Freeport, where it crosses and proceeds to Kelly Station, Crooked Creek Dam, Mahoning Dam, and thence to Cook Forest. At present, scouting is virtually complete to Crooked Creek Dam and blazing has been accomplished as far as Tarentum. This portion of the trail almost completely avoids paved roads and crosses streams by such rustic means as cable and log bridges.\n\nUpon completion of Sector No. 1 (to Crooked Creek Dam), a brochure will be prepared describing the route. This will be available to AYH members and to other groups in the community interested in hiking.\n\nMay 1950\n\n(Page 1) SYMPATHY\n\nHorace Forbes Baker, who was instrumental in founding the Pittsburgh Council, passed away February 24. The Baker Trail will be a memorial to his great influence in hosteling.\n\n(Page 4) Sat.-Sun., June 10-11 - BAKER TRAIL OVERNIGHT HIKE-BIKE.

The brochure, which contains a complete set of ten maps of the 133-mile trail, is available without charge to all new Pittsburgh AYH passholders. Additional copies are available for 20¢.\n\nThe maps in the Guide are the work of George Howe, who spends his non-hosteling hours in the Geography Department at Pitt.\n\nPhil Ewald, chairman of the Baker Trail, has announced that the Crooked Creek trip of May 19 and 20 will blaze the trail from Freeport to Crooked Creek, while the Mahoning Dam to Cook Forest section will be blazed by the end of June. They have been scouted.\n\nA Boy Scout troop from Wexford will be out on the Trail the weekend of April 22, while a troop from the South Hills will go from Crooked Creek to Springdale the weekend of May 19.\n\n(Page 2) ON THE BAKER TRAIL\n\nBy Herb Buchwald\n\nBetty Bierer, Roger Giler, Ross Firestone of Cleveland, and I started the Easter trip off by a taxi ride from Clarion to Cook Forest. It was 10:30 p.m. when we got there, too late to get a cabin. The only thing left was an open pavilion. The snow and 18° temperature didn't bother us that night--much! After breakfast we made our way to the fire tower, which is the start of the Baker Trail. The walk along the Clarion River amid snow flurries and sun streaming through the clouds started the trail off perfectly. After lunch we climbed Hill 1776, the highest point on the Baker Trail. That afternoon we found that it was not all honors to be a member of the first party to hike the Clarion section of the Baker Trail. Yes, we got lost. The detour took us at least 5 miles out of our way, bringing us to Corsica after a 22-mile day. In Corsica we persuaded a minister that we were human and deserved a ride in his car to Brookville for a stopover at Chet Merkle's. The next day was spent in some of the most beautiful lonely virgin pine country yet to be seen on the trail. We found lodging in the soft hay of a North Freedom barn that night. The rain and wind howled, but we didn't know it until 5:30 the next morning. Ross went home, but we carried on past Mahoning Dam on one of the wettest, coldest, windiest days of the season. That night we found lodging in Dayton's only hotel. It was a beautiful Easter morning, and before the churchbells beckoned, we had started on our last day. We were now again in well marked Baker Trail country. Late afternoon we reached the Hammel's in Plumville (Louise Pranses' family), and were welcomed to an inviting dinner, before we returned by bus from a very well spent Easter vacation.\n\n(Page 4) CROOKED CREEK ON THE BAKER TRAIL. Good preparation for the rough hiking trips this summer. Packs, eating and sleeping gear are all necessary. Leader, Phil Ewald, Le. 1-3541. Estmated cost $3.50\n\nWednesday, May 30 (Memorial Day) - BAKER TRAIL. A 10-mile hike along the Allegheny Sector of the Baker Trail, including many beautiful views of the Allegheny River from the heights. Bring your lunch and 90¢. Leader, Dan Moore, MO 1-4024\n\nJuly 1951\n\n(Page 1) ADVENTURE WITH US\n\nBy Betty Bierer, Chairman\n\nYear 'round hosteling is loads of fun. Those Friday night (oh) hikes, Monday evening cycle rides, weekend trips have been a wonderful adventure in making new friends, seeing W.Pa., dancing a square, doing the unusual and sharing the good fellowship that results from community living. Now, with the beginning of summer vacations, the greater adventure awaits in the extended trips that the Pittsburgh Council is sponsoring.\n\n...\n\nA chance to begin at Pgh. and hike along the Baker Trail to Cook Forest with its virgin stand of timber is given by Wes Bunnelle. On no trail within such a short distance, can be found such variety of topography, scenery, sociology -- this is the opportunity to see the large recreation areas at the three flood control dams along the way.\n\n(Page 4) Sunday, August 5 - HIT THE TRAIL - All day hike on the Baker Trail with a campfire supper in evening. Cost-- $1.85. Leader, Martha Wood, Ma. 1-7885.\n\nSeptember 1951\n\n(Page 1) BAKER TRAIL BOUQUETS\n\nExactly 136.8 miles is the length of the Baker Trail, starting at Guyasuta Lane in Aspinwall and ending at the Observation Tower in Cook Forest. And Betty Bierer and Wes Bunnelle were the first two to hike all 136.8 miles. They were accompanied by Mathilda--the bicycle wheel which rolled off the miles on its cyclometer. The first complete hiking of the trail was celebrated in Cook Forest, Saturday evening, August 18, with the presentation of achievement trophies to Betty and Wes. Phil Ewald, chairman of the Baker Trail Committee, presided at the presentation, and George Armstrong, park manager, spoke about the history and facilities of the park. At the same time, a scroll \"in appreciation for so effectively organizing and carrying out the initial development phases of the Horace Forbes Baker Trail\" was signed by all attending, to be presented to Tony Pranses. To welcome the pioneers after their two-week journey and to join in the ceremonies, were more than a score of hostelers who spent the weekend in the Forest with Fred Frouthal making decisions. The weekend was also distinguished by the presence of a real photographer, Jim Blair of the Pittsburgh Photographic Library who kept the air clicking with about 300 pictures including 97 flash bulbs.\n\nTHURSDAY OPEN HOUSE\n\nOct. 11 - \"Baker Trail from Pittsburgh to Cook Forest.\"\n\n(Page 4) Saturday, Sunday, Oct. 27-28 - BACK TO THE \"OLD BAKER TRAIL\" with Field Curry as leader.

Blazing Being Rapidly Completed ... Construction of Shelter in June.\n\nOur first B-T meetings saw the twelve sector leaders copying the tentative, correct route of the trail onto their own topographic quadrangles. As a model, they used the official routing as it exists now on the master set of topo maps, revised by B. Bierer and Wes Bunnelle after their 2-week hike two years ago, on the first complete trek over the entire 137 miles.\n\nGoals for 1953 were set at:\n\nFinishing the blazing and re-blazing.\n\nGathering all needed information for a guide book.\n\nSince then however, additional favorable reports of a shelter site above Freeport expanded to a definite plan to start construction in June. Though the painting is to be finished by then, this will require postponing of all final details of the blazing work. It means too, that we will be unable to issue a new guide book at the end of the year. But...completion of the first B-T shelter close to both Pittsburgh and the hostel, certainly warrants this emphasis.\n\nArrangements were made to furnish a group of Explorer Scouts with two guides for a 2-day trip on the Trail in June. We learned also of a two week pack trip by Senior Girl Scouts of Allegheny County routed from Crooked Creek north to Cook Forest.\n\nIn addition, our own Hostelers have been making the B-T a well travelled Trail with expeditions almost every week.\n\n--Walt Williams, Baker Trail Chairman\n\n(Page 5) Marshall Stalley, of our Executive Advisory Board, extends an invitation to all Hostelers to visit the Univ. of Pittsburgh Photographic Library on the thirteenth floor of the Cathedral of Learning. The office is open Mon. thru Friday from nine to five. There are lots of pictures on file that were taken at the Cook Forest weekend- summer of '51. Anyone interested in seeing them can get mor information from Rosemary and John Crable who've already visited the library.\n\n(Page 8) May 23, Saturday-FREEPORT TO PITTSBURGH OR BUST!

On October 17, the hikers, led by Chester Heavner will begin their seven day trip at the beginning of the trail in Aspinwall, and hike the entire length of the trail to Cook Forest. Several of our own hostelers are hoping to be able to join the Detroiters for a few days.\n\nSeptember 1953\n\n(Page 8) Oct. 18, Sun. - BAKER TRAIL HIKE.

Richardson, Mu 1-2885.\n\nNovember 1953\n\n(Page 7) I'm a little WATCHBIRD.\n\nI watch from a nest high in a tree near the town of Schenley. It used to be, things were pretty quiet around my house but that's changed now. Like Saturday, for instance ...\n\nIt was just around seven o'clock when I was distrubed by some people (Hustlers, they were) chopping a dead tree right next to my house. Walt, Ruth, Bruce, Jean and Dot (that's what I heard them called) then picked up this cut tree and carried it to a small clearing nearby. Immediately, they were joined by two others, Ramona and Gloria. Then everyone began peeling off the bark.\n\nAt the same time, John and Cy busily studied a blueprint; then hung up some strings which they told everybody was the roof.(?) When I saw that blueprint, I knew it must be a professional job. I looked real hard. On the bottom was written, \"Baker Trail Shelter No. 1.\"\n\nHow they worked--with axes, hatchets, saws and knives...like beavers! In fact, that's what they named Ruth after she chopped her first tree, 'Little Beaver'...couldn't figure that one out, but her friends thought it was funny.\n\nShe wasn't the only girl swinging an axe. Five went out looking for a tree...but before they took it there was always a vote--Would the bark come off easily; Was it easy to carry; Were there any thickets around it. And all the time, over the chatter of the girls, you could hear the boys hammering and sawing, as they fitted the logs into place.\n\nI'm glad it's almost finished--(I don't tremble anymore when someone goes past with an axe.) In my birdseye opinion, this lean-to is a good looking piece of work...And now, to watch the Hustlers that come here to camp!!!\n\n-- Jean McDowell\n\n(Page 8) Dec. 6, Sun.

Braddock suffers a disasterous defeat at Monongahela crossing, and the French and Indians are free to ravage all the small English settlements in the area from their strong-hold at the Indian village of Kittanning. This was the picture before Col. John Armstrong led a small band from Fort Shirley near Carlisle on an eight day hike across old Indian trails to Kittanning, and there in one surprise raid snuffed out this hotbed of murder. The attack was the first successful military thrust into western Pennsylvania and proved to be a decisive blow in the ware, which was to determine the fate of North American civilization.\n\nIn 1956, the bi-centennial year of the march, the Armstrong Trail Society was instituted and the march was re-enacted by a group of Boy Scouts. The Society wants to develop this route into an established, public hiking trail and is asking the Pittsburgh Council for advice and assistance to accomplish this. The Trail crosses our Baker Trail at right angles and heads east through some of the most scenic woods and mountains in our state. If extended, it might eventually link the Baker Trail and the Appalachian Trail which run parallel to each other in opposite ends of Pennsylvania.\n\n(Page 3) Book Review\n\n\"If bad weather comes, I will remember that it makes everyone miserable and I will remain civil to my buddies. Fighting won't stop it from raining.\" ... This was one of the rules by which Exploreres of Post #108 in Leetsdale, Pa., promised to live on the Baker Trail last summer. They completed their trip, from Aspinwall to Tionesta and back, in 26 days, and compiled a most remarkable record of it, showing landmarks, terrain, approximate mileage, compass readings, food and water stops, and camp sites. Although only in loose-leaf form, the book is an invaluable source of Trail information, even to details of preparation, like the scrap drive by which the boys made money to pay for the trip. The nine Explorer Scouts, and their advisor, E. D. Wright, deserve congratulations. (A.Y.H. has to publish its own Baker Trail guide book now, or the Scouts will let people think the Trail belongs to them, poison ivy and all)\n\n(Page 7) March 24. - Peggy Reskauskas takes us on a Spring hike to Shelter #2, B.T. with campfire supper afterwards...Messkits and 65¢ plus $1.25 Transp.

The maximum benefit is thereby derived by all members of all the clubs that belong. Most of the eleven associates are also charter members of the Appalachian Trail Association and maintain hiking trails of their own.\n\nThe groups (150 attended) were generally older even than the A.Y.H. members, but they offered no apologies for their advanced age and needed none. Their social program included a five-mile hike on Saturday; a ten-mile hike on Sunday, (with Eileen Hagan upholding the honor of the Pittsburgh Council up front and the rest of us bringing up the rear.)\n\nSaturday's highlight, at the long social meeting after dinner, was an illustrated talk by the Hon. Daniel Hock of Reading, on the founding of the Blue Mtn. Eagle Climbing Club. 91 years old...and his movies are not much younger...Mr. Hock still shows an active interest in hiking, the outdoors, and the opposite sex. We are hoping he will repeat his talk at our tenth anniversary banquet next Feb. 22.\n\nThe Association appears to offer many advantages, well worth the $5-a-year membership dues we pay. Its most active committee is comprised of representative from each participating club.\n\nThe Committee's chairman, George Kimmel, has maps of all trails and can answer almost all queries. Any question he cannot answer is referred to persons representing the Trail concerned.\n\nThe most direct, indirect benefits were the invitations of other clubs to participate in joint hikes on their trails. No committments were made, but our Trips and Trails committee is busy now with plans for the spring.\n\nPerhaps the least obvious, but the most important, benefit is the example the Keystone Trails Assoc. sets in efficiency of operation. With only two meetings a year and an annual budget of $74, they maintain a service of value to hundreds and perhaps thousands of hikers in Pennsylvania. Their business meetings are models of despatch and efficiency, maybe because one of their officers is a Legal Advisor who nips in the bud any wrangles about constitutionality, legal form, etc. If any of this know-how rubs off on the Pittsburgh Council, our $5.00 investment will multiply manifold.\n\n--Ralph Ludington\n\n(Page 3) BAKER TRAIL NEWS\n\nLEADERSECTORMILEAGETOPO QUAD'L.Betty BiererAspinwall-Springdale12.0Pittsburgh N.

Making their way through the dense undergrowth, they are a strange combination...in the lead is a half-doubled-over elderly man, a gallon paint bucket in one hand, and a paintbrush in the other, followed by a young lad of no more than twelve with a large pack on his back, also.\n\nUpon reachine the top of the hill both figures collapse into one, soaked-and-panting heap of humanity. A few minutes pass...then they take their canteens from their packs and gulp the remaining few ounces of water. They slowly rise after resting awhile and continue their journey to the Crooked Creek camping area.\n\nAt the Ranger's Cabin they are informed that the camping ground is completely filled and that they must spend the night in the cove close to the water and the mosquitoes.\n\nThey slowly trudge their way to the proposed campsite when they spy a familiar object coming towards them. Frantically, they wave their arms and shout as it comes closer and closer.\n\nIt's a car with two canoes on top and inside are four Pittsburgh hostelers. They get in and are whisked away to a delightful dinner and evening at a small cabin outside of Murraysville where they spend the night in a bed for the first time in five days.\n\nDecember 1960\n\n(Page 7) Sunday, January 8 - Baker Trail Hike in the vicinity of Cochran's Mill, suitable for ten-mile hikers.

The group formulated broad and detailed objectives for the development of the trail into a hikers' paradise.\n\nTrail signs will be erected at the trail and road intersections. It was decided by the group that the signs will be of sheet metal. These signs will be fabricated by Harry Rhule and will be ready for erection on April 7th.\n\nInformation centers will be located in various towns up and down the length of the trail. The information center will contain a large wall-type map and a literature rack that will contain a one-sheet informational type of publication. In the publication will be a map of the Baker Trail, plus some information on the trail and on Pittsburgh Council of AYH. Winifred Roensch is preparing the informational sheets. The informational centers have tentatively been designated as Cook Forest, Crooked Creek State Park, Mahoning Dam, Freeport, Plumville, Corsica, Summerville, North Freedom, McWilliam, and Atwood.\n\nAdditional lean-to sites will be secured at the following locations: Cochran's Mill; Plum Creek near Rte. 422; Plum Creek 3 miles south of Plumville; Phoenix; McWilliams; between Summerville and Heathville; Mill Creek near Strattonville; and between Corsica and Fisher.\n\nIt is hoped that the Cochran's mill site can be selected in the near future. The approval of the owner of the property will then be secured so that construction of the lean-to can get underway. It is the objective of the group that this lean-to can be under construction by Fall of 1963.\n\nHarry Rhule has agreed to lead some trips in the area with the intention of selecting some tentative sites. Mark Dodd will handle the arrangements with the owner for construction of the lean-to that will be under the direction of Don Woodland.\n\n(Page 9) March 10, Sunday - Still proving to pompous cyclists, with their Century Pins & Orange Belt rides, that we have real hikers in AYH ...

The remainder of the trail signs will be erected on Saturday, July 27 and help is needed for this quarter.\n\nNow...for the big step: Two new lean-to's will be erected this year. These have been designed and will be laid out and precut in our headquarters, thereby saving more time when we begin raising the lean-to at the site. We need the help of people that can saw a board and use a wood chisel...Gain some valuable experience in carpentry and learn modern methods of precut building construction.\n\nThe precutting will be done on Tuesday, August 6. Beginning in the afternoon, we shall work until evening, stopping only for the buffet supper that will be served to our able workers.\n\nThis will bring a total of four shelters on the Baker Trail and we hope to add three more in '64, thus enabling Hostelers to hike the entire trail, stopping over night at the shelters.\n\nDid you know that the Crooked Creek lean-to is surrounded by Mountain Laurel. In June when it bursts into bloom, it is magnificent!\n\n(Page 7) Saturday, August 10 to Sunday, August 11 -- Overnight hike on the Baker Trail between Freeport and Crooked Creek. Bring own food and sleeping bag plus individual necessities and assorted luxuries. Cost of trip is only $2.00. Leave HQ at 10 A.M.\n\nOctober 1963\n\n(Page 2) GETTING A LEAN-TO SITE IS SIMPLE?...\n\nBy Fran Czapiewski\n\nTake a typical example: Don Woodland asked Mark Dodd to get permission to build a shelter on the Baker Trail near Crooked Creek. The spot at Brick Church was located near a coal mine so the solution seemed simple--we just had to ask the owner.\n\nGoing up, Mark approached a man at the mine and was told that he didn't own it, but the man inside did; he would be out in a little bit. Some thirty minutes later the man in the mine came out and said he didn't own it but a man by the name of King up at the store owned it.\n\nAt the store, Mark talked with Mr. King who said he didn't own it; his brother who lived in another county did...Then thinking further, he said the property was divided into small parts. His brother owned one part, the Cuthbert heirs owned another, the Federal government had the third part. The assessor for the township, he felt sure, would have more information.\n\nDodd found the assessor sitting on his back porch, rocking away with a very cold attitude. He started to explain that he wanted to know where the Cuthbert heirs could be located, when from under the porch there suddenly appeared two big wolfhounds (well, they were bigger than collies, anyhow) which were duly called off by the owner. When the assessor found out what was wanted he was very happy to oblige and gave us the address of the Cuthbert heiress.\n\nWe wrote the Cuthbert heiress and to Brother King and received permission. Meantime, the superintendant at Crooked Creek State Park has indicated an interest in putting up a shelter right in the park. So, we are now considering additional sites for lean-to's further up the trail...eventually going all the way to Cook Forest!\n\n(Page 3) Oct. 5, Sat. - Foundation planting party, a fancy way of saying \"digging holes for the concrete supports that anchor the framework for our new Baker Trail shelters...yes, a work party.\" Don Woodland takes another step forward finishing the leanto's...no willing hand turned away; Don will show you what to do...girls are useful for handing tools and morale. For full details, call 563-5419.\n\nOct. 12, Sat. - Finishing touches on the Baker Trail shelters. Don Woodland's number: 563-5419.

Leave HQ at 8:30 a.m.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF LEAN-TO #3\n\nBy Don Woodland\n\nLean-to #3 is almost finished. The asphalt shingles for the roof have to be installed as well as some minor carpentry work. One more day should see the shelter finished. The construction of Lean-to #3 began in August with the pre-cutting of the framing members. This proved to be a time-saving method and the pieces fitted well in the field. On November 16th the concrete footers were installed. We used a post hole digger so sink the holes and made the forms out of cardboard boxes that were secured from a local A & P Store. Saturday, November 23rd, was the big day for the erection of the platform and framing. Harry Rhule delivered the pre-cut lumber and the oak lumber for the platform to the site in his red truck. It rained all morning so that the dress for the day was ponchos. In short order the crew, that included Mark Dodd, his daughter and 2 girl scouts, and Bruce Sundquist, had the heavy oak platform timbers cut and placed into position. 40 penny nails were used to nail the members together and this was an exceedingly difficult job that required many blows of a heavy hammer to penetrate the timbers. The girls did a superior job of nailing down the oak flooring. What a beautiful sight to see the rain running down their faces and the hammers pounding away. The framing of the back and side walls and roof was relatively easy because these members were pre-cut and marked so that it was only necessary to nail them together. Saturday, December 7th, was the day that saw the general completion of the carpentry work. The sides were installed as well as the roof. The final work party will be scheduled pending a break in the weather. More of our members should be taking part in the construction of the lean-tos. This is a good opportunity to develop some building skills. The skills will be needed when the Pittsburgh Council of AYH undertakes the development of a ski hostel several years from now.\n\nMarch 1964\n\n(Page 1) Baker Trail Improvement News\n\nD.J. Woodland\n\nTHREE CHEERS, Shelter No. 3 (Cochran Mills) is now completed and is dry and warm. A dedication and ribbon cutting cerermony will be held in March. This will be a gala affair and reserved for those loyal members and friends that helped in the field construction. The exact date has not been set, but it is planned to have it on the afternoon of the day that the concrete footers for Lean-To No. 4 are poured.\n\n1963 was a good year for the capital improvements program. The road signs were made and put in place. These signs are very striking and should help people to find the road-trail intersections. The objective for 1964 is to build at least two more lean-tos. The trail will require four more lean-tos to reach Mahoning Dam. The sites for two lean-tos have been selected, and the approval of the owners secured, thanks to the labor of Mark Dodd. The two additional sites will be tentatively selected in March.\n\nI am sure that we learned quite a bit from the construction of Lean-To No. 3. For one thing the cost is reasonable, about $150. Also, it is possible to modify the design of the lean-to to reduce some of the material needed for the construction. For example the roofing will be changed to a plank and beam system that will elimate the need for rafters. Some of the framing lumber for lean-to No. 4 will have to be modified, but this can easily be done at headquarters.\n\nThe importance of having the right tools to work with was a valuable lesson. We broke two light hammers trying to drive 40 penny nails into oak. Saws and chisels have to be kept sharp.\n\nWho will be the first person to sleep out in the new shelter? The honor should go to Mark Dodd and his \"girls\". He will have to hurry because my 4-year-old daughter has her sleeping bag rolled and is anxious to camp out.\n\nWe still need more workers. A couple more shelters will definitely put the Baker Trail on the map, and it is a great satisfaction to have taken part in this adventure.\n\n(Page 3) Sat.

Woodland\n\nOur Baker Trail development program took a giant step forward in May. The following is how it progressed:\n\nMay 2 - The concrete footers for No. 4 Lean-to had been installed in early April. Our illustrious editor Dave Magram helped with the concrete work; that is, he was busy between slices of cinnamon bread. Today the platform and framing was built. Harry Rhule delivered the lumber in his Red Truck and Bruce Sundquist, J. D. Myers, Winifred Roensch, and I worked liked the slaves building the Egyptian Pyramids to complete the work before dark. It was 7:30 p.m. when we stopped. It was necessary to cut the frsm1ng lumber from stock because the pre-cut materials that were stored under the big table at headquarters could not be used as we did not have a key. As a result of this, lean-to #4 features the plank and beam roof that was explained in some detail in the March 1964 Golden Triangle.\n\nMay 3 - Shelter No. 3 at Cochran Mills was dedicated with fitting ceremony and a delicious cake made by Mrs. Dodd. The cake had white icing (for the snow in winter), green trees, and a brown lean-to with a small red fire. Winifred Roensch gave us a demonstration in geometry by initially dividing the cake into 16 equal parts. There were 14 of us at the dedication, from my 2-year old son to teenage girls and adults. J. D. Myers and his wife stayed after the gang had departed to cook supper. It is a good thing they did because our guest, Scoutmaster Victor Wise from Renfrew, Pa. and his wife and family arrived late. You will be hearing more about Scoutmaster Wise and his boys from B.S.A. Troop 12 of Butler.\n\nMay 9 - Bruce Sundquist and I made a fast trip up to #4 to complete the framing and some odds and ends. We drove a short distance on the trail towards Russell Hill and came across a Troop from Allison Park that was out in force hiking the trail. This was an encouraging sight for us.\n\nMay 24 - Scoutmaster Wise and some of the older boys camped at Cochran Mills shelter and worked on Saturday to erect the roof of #4 and install the sides. The back was not finished because of a mistake in the lumber order. The roofing shingles were installed.\n\nMay 30 - Lean-to #7, located a short distance from Mahoning Dam, was started. The men from B.S.A. Troop 12 of Butler, Pa. helped J. D. Myers and I to erect the platform and frame up the shelter. Harry Rhule brought up the materials on Friday night. My family and I camped out Friday and Saturday. It was wonderful weekend and we had a good time. My children saw deer and other animals.\n\nMay 31 - My family and I broke camp early in the morning and with J. D. Myers drove to Idaho shelter to finish the job. The Mahoning Dam lean-to will be finished soon. We used railroad ties for the foundation of this shelter, and this proved to be a time-saving device. With the proper work party of about four to five good workers, we should be able to finish a shelter in two days. This is important because of the increased travel time from Pittsburgh.\n\nInterest continues to mount on the Baker Trail. We are receiving communications from as far away as Cambridge, Mass. The sites for shelters #5 and #6 will be selected by October, and I expect to have them finished by November 1964. This will complete the chain of lean-tos from Freeport to Mahoning Dam. We are interested in finding a group that will take over the responsibility of the trail from Mahoning Dam to Cook Forest. A group in the Clarion or New Bethlehem area would be ideal. Two shelters should be built to complete the trail facilities to Cook Forest. Happy Hiking!\n\n(Page 3) 16 FRI 17 SAT Baker Trail Shelter Party - Camp out Friday night and return by Sat. night.

Those are terrifying words to hear, and it is my sad duty to report that we have received word that one of our shelters was destroyed by fire on Nov 2, 1964. It was the Schenley Shelter, a log cabin design. I am sure that all the people who worked on that shelter will be saddened by the news. We intend to rebuild the shelter in Spring of 1965. There will have to be a clean-up party. Who would like to lead the party?\n\nThis fall has been devoted to administrative work that has to be done on the trail. We have interested some other groups in the trail. Five boy scout troops from Butler, Pa. area and Oil City area have been approved as sector groups. It is anticipated that a troop from DuBois will be assigned a sector. Pgh AYH is reserving the sectors from Freeport to Cochran Mills for our members. Any volunteers for a sector?\n\nWe are planning a general meeting for the sector leaders to be held in Cook Forest perhaps in the early spring. The purpose of this meeting is to have some original discussions on the trail development.\n\nThe Commonwealth is erecting signs in Cook Forest and Crooked Creek State Parks. We are planning to meet with the Highway Dept. in the near future to try to get them to erect signs on the state roads. Happy Hiking! - Don Woodland\n\n(Page 2) FORBES TRAIL\n\nA.Y.H. along with historical and scouting groups is currently scouting the historic Forbes Trail with the intention of turning it into a hiking trail running between Pittsburgh and Ligonier and ultimately to Bedford. Long range plans include joining this trail to C. & O. Canal towpath via the ancient \"Warrior Trail\" which runs along a high, wooded ridge between Bedford and Cumberland and also to join the Baker Trail to Forbes Trail via Roaring Run (east of Apollo) and the Loyalhanna Creek area. Persons interested in trail scouting or helping with these efforts in other ways are urged to contact J. D.

Woodland\n\nFor those hikers that have hiked Sector 3 (Route 66 to Cochran Mills) of our Baker Trail certainly have been impressed by the high quality of the trail signs and paint blazers. The Sector Leader, Walter Tereszkiewiez, deserves a lot of thanks for his efforts. He cheerfully volunteered his services as a sector leader less than a year ago, and what a fine job he has done. His work is very professional and has been an inspiration to all of us that have labored on the trail development program. Thanks Walter for a job well done.\n\nFebruary 1966\n\n(Page 3) Feb. 26 - Help finish off the Baker Trail Sign Program.

I have received many fine reports from our sector leaders on the work that has been done on their sectors.\n\nThe trail is well blazed and marked with signs. More signs are being erected this year. Tentative site selections for shelter No. 9 (Little Mill Creek) and No. 6 (Mahoning Church) have been made. The property owners are being contacted for permission to build. Some major trail relocations in section 10 have been planned.\n\nOur indefatigable sector leader Walter Tereszkiewiez has two beautiful highway signs for Route 66 and Cochrans Mills (356) trailroad intersections. He is currently working on a Covered Bridge that will be field erected beginning in August. This will be the only covered bridge in Armstrong County.\n\nVictor Wise, our able sector leader No. 5, is to be congratulated for receiving the Scouters Silver Beaver award. His sector is from Idaho to Atwood and is in excellent shape. If you get lost on his sector, we recommend that you stay home.\n\nThe number of hikers using the trail is constantly increasing. A girl scout troop used a pony to carry a cripple boy on a hike. The local residents along the trail are very friendly to the hikers. Mr. Weaver, who has a large farm at Hone, Pa., noticed a group of hikers on the trail. He sent his daughter to meet them on the road and insisted that they camp at his place. Mr. Simkins, who owns a hardware store in Corsica, Pa. told me that there is a steady stream of hikers past his window, and that they are getting younger all the time.\n\nWe plan to extend the trail south of Freeport to take in the scene of the Indian massacre. The original cabin is being restores.\n\nDon't forget to buy the patches. HAPPY HIKING\n\n(Page 3) July 23 Hike the Baker Trail from Idaho to Atwood. Bring lunch and about $1.50.

Return by 6 on Sunday.\n\nOctober 1966\n\n(Page 2) MORE HIKING TRAILS (TOBERMORY TO FREEPORT)\n\nIn case you haven't heard, a number of Canadian hiking clubs are nearly finished with a hiking trail from Tobomory (where Lake Huron and the Georgian Bay meet) down to near Niagara Falls. The trail is called the \"Bruce Trail\" and runs along the Niagara escarpment through Eastern Canada's most scenic country.\n\nAt Queenston, the Bruce Trail joins the Finger Lakes Trail System. A number of very active New York State hiking clubs expect to have their Finger Lakes Trail system extend eastward to the Catskills and southward via a spur trail to the Allegheny State Forest at Red House. There, says the New York State Park Department, it has a (somewhat overgrown) trail that leads south to the Pa.-New York line. Recently we have heard that the Allegheny National Forest people (N.F.S.) have plans for a trail that will run from the Pa.-New York line to the Muzette Fire Tower (thru the Allegheny National Forest), which is just seven miles north of the end of the Baker Trail in Cook Forest. Is it possible that some day there will be a trail from Tobermory to Pittsburgh? and if so, why not on to Washington, D. C. via Forbes Trail, Warrior Trail and the C. & O. Canal Towpath?\n\nHandwritten: (Warrior Trail circled above) This must be some trail other than Greene-Marshall counties Warrior Trail\n\n(Page 3) Saturday, October 22 - Fall colors hike on the Baker Trail from Cochran's Mill to Crooked Creek State Park.

WOODLAND (563-5419).\n\nNovember 1967\n\n(Page 1) BAKER TRAIL BRIDGE\n\nThe Baker Trail now has a beautiful new covered bridge crossing Horne Camp Run between Cochran's Mill and Crooked Creek Park. The bridge was built by sector leader, Walter Tereszkiewiez, and B.S.A. Troop 40. Its heavy timber trusses and rustic appearance are appropriate to its environment. Walter and Troop 40 are to be congratulated for an outstanding addition to the Trail.\n\nDecember 1967\n\n(Page 4)\n\nAYH owes much credit to Don Woodland, Baker Trail Chairman, for his many contributions to the trail during the past six years. He has been largely responsible for building shelters, erecting signs, and maintaining the trail. He has generated interest in it among many scout troops and other groups and has established excellent relations with many people involved with it.\n\nBefore becoming interested in the Baker Trail, Don served on the Board of of Directors and also did a tremendous amount of work on the renovation of our headquarters building. Don has bean a real asset to AYH and deserves the members' support end assistance.\n\nA native of Baltimore, Maryland, Don came to Pittsburgh about 13 years ago, joined AYH and met Billie here. They now have five hosteling children and live in Baldwin Township.\n\nMarch 1968\n\n(Page 1) BAKER TRAIL NEWS\n\nDid you know that our Baker Trail has six shelters; or that our plans call for the construction of four more to complete the chain from Freeport to Cook's Forest? These shelters are your home away from home along the hiking trail. The inside dimensions are 12 by 8 feet and will sleep 6 comfortably. Each shelter has its official wooden sign, with the name and date of construction routed into the sign. The shelters are: Schenley, 1965; Crooked Creek, 1953, Cochrans Mill, 1963; Idaho, 1964; Milo Weaver, 1966; Mahoning, 1964; and hopefully, North Freedom, 1968.\n\nThe Crooked Creek shelter was built of timbers from an old log cabin; the newer shelters are built of rough sawn oak with boards and battens for the siding. Each shelter requires about 1,000 board feet of lumber and 30 lbs. of nails.\n\nOut shelter design has progressed through several stages of development, with general dimensions based on the most efficient use of stock sizes of lumber. We have kept the waste down to approximately 2%.\n\nOn March 30th, AYH will break ground for the North Freedom Shelter. Our basic design has been modified so that a better proportioning of the interior space is achieved. If you want some good clean fun, and would like to create something for others to enjoy, sharpen up your saw and check the Trips and Trails page for where to report for work.\n\n(Page 11) 29 FRI JO SAT Ground breaking and foundation work party for the latest Baker Trail Shelter - North Freedom. Leave HQ 7:00 p.m. and sleep in Mahoning Shelter. See Don Woodland (563-5419) for details.\n\nMay 1968\n\n(Page 2) NEWEST SHELTER\n\nThe construction of our newest Baker Trail Shelter, THE NORTH FREEDOM SHELTER, is on schedule, and it will be dedicated on Saturday, March [May] 11, as the closing event of National Hostel week.\n\nThe shelter is situated on a slight knoll overlooking the river. The site is heavily accented with hemlock and rhododendron. The stream flowing in its bed is like so much background music; the air is crisp and scented with hemlock and pine.\n\nThis shelter is our latest design that was described in the March TRIANGLE and has worked out very well with the increased interior space. With the large amount of hikers using the trail in the winter months, an indoor fireplace is tempting for the next shelter in the Atwood area.\n\nOur Baker Trail now has seven shelters and one covered bridge. Three more shelters are needed to complete the chain to Cook's Forest. The sites for those shelters must be selected so that we can schedule construction. We can use more help from our members on this work so why not join us and learn how to use your hands in a creative activity! -- Donald Woodland\n\n(Page 11) 11 SAT Come to the DEDICATION of the NORTH FREEDOM SHELTER on the Baker Trail. Don Woodland (563~5419) leads. Leave HQ at 9:30 am with lunch, poncho and about $2.00. Be prepared to do some hiking in the area.\n\nJune 1968\n\n(Page 1) SHELTER DEDICATION A WET SUCCESS\n\nNestled in a grove of hemlocks, on the banks of an almost white-water stream, Shelter Number Eight at North Freedom may be the most beautiful shelter on the whole Baker Trail. It is certainly the newest--in fact the dedication trip turned out to be a work party as those who attended it ended up nailing shingles on the roof. A welcome addition to the party were Billie Woodland and the Woodland's five children. Billie's husband, Don, is chiefly responsible for this shelter and most of the recent development of the Baker Trail.\n\nThe foundations for this shelter and its outhouse were dug by Bernard McKenna end some of his boys from the Youth Squad in Wilkinsburg. Assisting Don with the building were: Bruce Sundquist, Manny Morgan, Gordon Hyatt, David Engel and Robert Palazzi.\n\nThe dedication of the North Freedom shelter, which was one of the important events of Hostel Week, was highlighted by a cake baked by Billie Woodland with decoration provided by Hugh Gilmour. After the ritual cake-eating and the shingle-nailing, Hugh, Mary Johnston, Dave Wright, Bob Mautino and Cathy Lynch followed the capable map reading of Bruce Sundquist through the rain. The area looked excellent, even under these conditions. The North Freedom Shelter should prove to be a popular one.\n\nWhen the TRIANGLE asked Billie for a comment on the shelter dedication, she reminded us of the total purpose of the Baker Trail. \"This is Pittsburgh Council's most important service project\" she said, \"it should enable people, not only Scouts--by just a few or many years--to enjoy backpacking--to get close to God by getting close to nature. People who have such experiences should be better people, better able to solve their own problems and society's. That's what the Baker Trail is all about. That's really what the shelters are for.\"\n\n(Photo) May 11th Dedication: Don Woodland, David Wright, Hugh Gilmour and Mary Johnston. Photo by--Bruce Sundquist.\n\nSeptember 1968\n\n(Page 1) BAKER TRAIL NEWS\n\nThe site for Shelter No. 5 has been selected and construction of the shelter is scheduled for the middle of September. This shelter will be known as the Pine-ees Shelter and is location about 1 mile south of Atwood on the Baker Trail. The Pine-ees Chapter of the NCHA from Indiana, Pa. will be in charge of the construction.\n\nDue to the sharp increase in the number of hikers using the trail, we decided to increase the size of the shelter to sleep two more hikers. The width will also be increased by a foot to provide a little more space in the front.\n\nA good spring is located about 50 feet from the shelter site, and it has cool sweet water. There is a beautiful view on top of the hill of the surrounding Rural Valley.\n\nThis shelter when finished will bring to eight the number that we have on the Baker Trail. Our overall plans call for ten shelters; with the remaining two to be built on the northern end of the trail.\n\n--Don Woodland, B.T.

This is our finest shelter to date. Keith States and his crew deserve a round of thanks for their splendid achievement. The shelter will be dedicated sometime in the near future.\n\n1968 has been a record year for the Baker Trail. Two shelters and four latrines were built as well as a stone fireplace at the Cochrans Mill shelter. About 40 new signposts were installed. The trail has never been in better shape. No work was done from Corsica North. These sectors will be worked over next year. Some major trail relocations are being planned.\n\nThere still remains a lot of work to be done to make the Baker Trail into a first class hiking trail.\n\nDecember 1968\n\n(Page 6) FREEPORT TO COOK FOREST BY WAY OF THE BAKER TRAIL\n\nDo the entire 137 miles, or take a sector at a time.

The schedule overs the entire trail through forests and farmland, from Freeport to Cook Forest, a distance of 108 miles. The hikes are planned around spring flowers, summer swimming and blackberry picking in the fall.\n\nAfter the winter storms are over, the trail usually needs a \"face-lifting,\" repainting of faded blazes, addng of missing signs, removal of trees and branches lying across the trail, and the replacement of lost shingles and other repairs to the shelters. These hikes with \"paint brush and saw\" cannot be closely described that far ahead, but cover usually one section at a time and usually end at a shelter with a rewarding supper.\n\nAll trips will start from the upper parking lot near the headquarters bldg. in Nellon Park. It is recommended that you wear hiking boots and long pants and that you bring a lunch and drinking water as there may not be water available along the trail. Anticipate a prompt departure; the return time is anywhere between 6 and 10 PM. If you have your own transportation, you can arrange with the leader for an earlier return. All trip fees are approximate and include transporuation; the leader himself will determine the final fee. Nonmembers can add 50¢ per trip. Reservations for all trips are a must as changes in departure time may be necessary; be sure to call the leader for details, or call AYH on Thursday evening from 8 to ll ... the number: 362-8181. The general location of the hikes can be found on our Baker Trail information sheet which is free or in the Baker Trail Guide Book which sells for 75¢.

Much has been done on the Baker Trail in 1971 and the year is not over yet.\n\nDave Porterfield and I, as Baker Trail Chairman and Co-Chairman, agreed at a meeting with neighboring trail clubs to extend the trail about 15 miles into Allegheny National Forest. After negotiating with four governmental agencies and several private landowners, the route was established, scouted, cleared and partly blazed.\n\nThe trail from the Clarion River to Corsica was rerouted for about 16 miles back into the woods. After selecting the route and scouting the trail, the trick is to find the landowners and get their permission to walk over their property. So far nobody has turned us down. We got a lot of help from Bill Hearst in Clarion. He even got an OK to build the Fisher Shelter on McNaughton Hill, the highest point in Clarion County with a beautiful view. We got right into the act and in July the shelter went up. It was almost completed, including outhouse and picnic table. The Clarion Boy Scouts promised to put on the missing boards and shingles.\n\nAfter taking a break for vacation we found a fine spot for the Corsica Shelter. That one will be built on November 13 and 14, 1971. This leaves one shelter to be built near Summerville to complete the chain of 11 shelters up to Cook Forest.\n\nThe shelter design, based on Don Woodland's Idaho Shelter was refined and worked out in great detail. This enables a crew of six to build one shelter on a weekend (the cooking crew not included!).\n\nThe rest of the trail is in pretty good shape, but should be rerouted in several spots away from roads and populated areas.\n\nWalter Tereszkiewicz added several unique bridges in Section 3 near Crooked Creek. Besides that he took pity on the section below Summerville and did a great job with blazes, wooden signs and little benches along the way. For all his donation of time and expenses over many years, Walter was awarded Honorary Life Membership in AYH.\n\nAmong the many helpers with the trailwork, the efforts of Don Woodland, J.D. Meyers and his wife Eleanor, and Bob McGoff should be mentioned.\n\nWith 7½ minute maps now available for the entire trail, a new guide book is in preparation.\n\nWe will continue to improve the trail in 1972. It extends now from Freeport into Allegheny National Forest and is over 130 miles long.\n\nIf you haven't hiked yet on the trail and camped at one of the shelters, try it once, you will enjoy it!!\n\n(Page 5) Fri.
