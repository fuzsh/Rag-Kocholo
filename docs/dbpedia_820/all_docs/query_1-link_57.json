        "text": "C L M S T\n\nC\n\nCatholics and the American Revolution\n\nMartin I. J. Griffin compiled this two-volume work from articles originally published in The American Catholic Historical Researchers between 1906 and 1907. It examines how Catholicism was viewed by the parties involved in the Revolution, and the role that Catholics played, both as supporting Patriots and dissenting Loyalists. A few article titles include \"Anti-Catholic Declarations of the Continental Congress,\" \"The Marquis de Lotbiniere, a Supporter of the American 'Rebels' . . . ,\" and \"Catholic Hessians in the Revolution.\" There are also several articles on Catholicism in Canada during the American Revolution. The two-volume work was published by the author in 1907 and 1909.\n\nVolume 1 Volume 2\n\n______________________________________________\n\nCentenary of the See of Boston, a Newspaper Man's Compilation of the Leading Events of the One Hundreth Anniversary of the Diocese of Boston\n\nThis book by William F. Kennedy details the events celebrating the Centenary of the See of Boston, as well as how the events were reported in local newspapers. Included are biographical sketches of important figures, such as Archbishop O'Connell, messages from leaders such as Pope Pius X and Theodore Roosevelt, and details of celebratory masses and parades. The Centenary occurred in 1908, and this book was published in 1909.\n\nVolume 1 Volume 2 Volume 3\n\nVolume 4\n\n______________________________________________\n\nL\n\nThe Life of Cardinal Cheverus\n\nJean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus (1768-1836) was born in France, but became the first Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese in Boston in 1808. Despite being well-respected in America, Cheverus returned to France in 1823, where he became Bishop of Montauban, and later Archbishop and then Cardinal. This biography was originally written in French by J. Huen-Dubourg, translated to English by E. Stewart and published in 1839.\n\nThe Special Collections also holds an 1841 copy of the original French.\n\nOriginal French (1841) English Translation (1839)\n\n______________________________________________\n\nM\n\nThe Memorial History of Boston, Including Suffolk County, Massachusetts 1630-1880\n\nThis monumental four-volume work was edited by Justin Winsor and published in 1880-1881. Each section was written by a historian specializing in that period or area. In addition to General History, the series includes sections Natural History, Religious History, Literary History, and Linguistics of local Native American Languages, among other topics. Additionally, the series includes histories of notable neighborhoods, and many historical maps.\n\nVolume 1 Volume 2 Volume 3 Volume 4\n\n______________________________________________\n\nS\n\nThe Spirit-Rapper; An Autobiography\n\nOrestes Augustus Brownson (1803-1876), the author of this autobiography, was an intellectual, activist, and notable Liberal Catholic. He was born in Vermont and spent most of his working life in and around Boston, where he fulfilled a variety of roles from Catholic Priest to labor organizer. He is best known for his writing supporting Catholicism - at times taking controversial stances such as early support of emancipation, and supporting church above governmental authority.\n\nView on Archives.org\n\n______________________________________________\n\nThe Story of Massachusetts\n\nIn the Forward to the first volume, compiler William H. Clark says this work is titled \"The Story\" rather than \"The History\" of Massachusetts because it strives to include a wide variety of perspectives not typically included in historical works. For example, the first three volumes include sections on Geological Formation, Evolution of the Whaling Industry, and Transportation (1635-1936). The fourth volume includes \"Personal and Family Histories\" of notable Massachusetts residents. The four-volume set was edited by Daniel L. Marsh and published in 1938.\n\nVolume 1 Volume 2 Volume 3 Volume 4\n\n______________________________________________\n\nThe Story of the Irish in Boston\n\nThe first part of this book tells the history of Irish immigration and settlement in Boston, covering topics as diverse as the role of Irish soldiers in the Revolutionary War and accusations of witchcraft in Irish communities. The second half includes biographical sketches of notable men and women of Irish descent living in Boston. It was written by James Bernard Cullen and published in 1889.\n\nView on Archives.org\n\n______________________________________________\n\nT\n\nThe Town of Roxbury\n\nIn the preface to this sketch of Roxbury, Francis S. Drake says that Roxbury has had a surprisingly large influence on the evolution of Massachusetts. Besides being the home to a large number of Militiamen during the American Revolution, the original settlers of Springfield and Worcester, MA, hailed from Roxbury, as did ten governors of Massachusetts. This book includes a history of Roxbury, and a detailed description of the town as it existed in 1905, the year of publication.\n\nView on Archives.org\n\n______________________________________________\n\nB C H I L\n\nB\n\nA Brief Historical Review of the Archdiocese of Boston 1907-1923\n\nThis aptly-named volume described the activities of the Boston Archdiocese in the early 20th century. It includes sections on Diocesan Charities, the Diocesan School System, Diocesan Property, A Spiritual Survey (sacraments, Sunday schools, and St. John's Seminary), Propagation of the Faith (missionary and charity work), and the Diocesan Press. According to the Foreword by William Cardinal Cushing, most of the research for the book was conduced at St. John's Seminary in Boston.\n\nView on Archive.org\n\n______________________________________________\n\nC\n\nCampaigning for Christ\n\nThis work recounts the authors' Catholic missionary activities and proselytism across America. It also touches on their socialist political campaigning. It was written by David Goldstein and Martha Moore Avery and published in 1924.\n\nView on Archive.org\n\n______________________________________________\n\nCardinal Wiseman's Works\n\nCardinal Nicholas Wiseman (1802-1865) was the first Archbishop of Westminster after Catholicism was re-established in England in 1850.

The Catholic Encyclopedia describes is as follows: \" Written from an apologetic point of view, the work contributed enormously to the extirpation of Gallicanism in the Church of France.
