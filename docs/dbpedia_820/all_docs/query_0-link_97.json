Aged 30.\n\nSon of Elizabeth Wilson (formerly Sellen), (née Gambell), and of the late William Sellen.\n\nHusband of Edith Agnes Sellen (née Muggeridge).\n\nGeorge was the stepson of George Wilson. His birth was recorded in the Milton, Kent, Registration District during the fourth quarter of 1870. His marriage to Upchurch native Miss Edith Agnes Muggeridge was recorded in the Medway, Kent, Registration District during the fourth quarter of 1894. Edith was a daughter of James Muggeridge and Sarah Ann Muggeridge. George is commemorated on at St. Mary’s Churchyard, Upchurch, on a cross which bares the inscription:-\n\nIN LOVING MEMORY OF MY DEARLY LOVED HUSBAND GEORGE WILLSON SELLEN WHO DIED WHILST ON ACTIVE SERVICE DECR 16TH 1900. AGED 30 YEARS. SOLDIER REST THY WARFARE O'ER REST IN SLEEP THAT KNOWS NO WAKING AWAY NEATH AFRICA’S SHORE THE LAST REVILLE WAITING.\n\nOn Wednesday 28 September 1898, the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards embarked upon the SS Nubia at Gibraltar and sailed to England, arrived back at Wellington Barracks, London on Tuesday 3 October 1899, it being the same month the Second Boer War was declared. By December the army started to raise the 8th Division in order to meet the expected demands for additional personnel to serve in South Africa. The 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards in Which George was serving, formed part of the 16th Brigade, 8th Division which was commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Macleod Leslie Rundle, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O. The 8th Infantry Division at that time being comprised the 16th Brigade commanded by Major-General Barrington Campbell, M.V.O., consisting of the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards, 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, 2nd Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment, the 1st Battalion Leicester Regiment, and the 21st Bearer Company, 21st Field Hospital, Royal Army Medical Corps. The 17th Brigade commanded by Major-General John Edward Boyes, C.B., consisting of 1st Battalion Worcestershire Regiment, 2nd Battalion, Queen’s Own (Royal West Kent Regiment), 1st Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment, 2nd Battalion Manchester Regiment, and the 22nd Bearer Company, 22nd Field Hospital, Royal Army Medical Corps. The other units making up the 8th Division were the 1st Brigade Imperial Yeomanry consisting of the 1st, 4th and 11th Battalions; 5th Company, Royal Engineers; 2nd, 77th and 79th Batteries, Royal Field Artillery; and the 23rd Field Hospital, Royal Army Medical Corps, and which numbered approximately 8000 officers and other ranks. Prior to the move to South Africa, H.M. Queen Victoria reviewed George’s battalion on Saturday 10 March 1900. Commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Lloyd, D.S.O. the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards sailed for South Africa from Southampton on the 5,413 ton SS Dunera on Sunday 18 March 1900, and disembarked at Port Elizabeth, South Africa on Monday 16 April, along with the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards, 2nd Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, Leinster Regiment, all being part of the 16th Brigade. At the time of sailing for South Africa, the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards was comprised of eight companies of about 120 personnel, they being No.1 Company commanded by Major Scott-Kerr, No.2 Company commanded by Captain Murray-Thriepland, No.3 Company commanded by Captain Verschoyle. No.4 Company commanded by Captain The Lord Ardee, No.5 Company commanded by Captain Bonham, No.6 Company commanded by Captain The Honourable W. Cavendish, No.7 Company commanded by Captain The Viscount Kilcoursie, and No.8 Company commanded by Major W. Marshall. The following is a brief extract from the book The Great Boer War, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which was published in London, by Smith, Elder & Co., in 1902, which illustrates some of the events appertaining to the 8th Division in which George served:- “The division arrived while Lord Roberts was still in Bloemfontein, but worried by the raids which the enemy had made with success at Sannah’s Post and Reddersburg. Wepener was still blockaded, and the division was accordingly railed to the Springfontein-Edenburg district, and immediately took the field at Orlogspoort and Dewetsdorp. There was no severe fighting. The enemy held strong positions about the latter place; but the force employed was overwhelming, and the Boers retreated from these and from the neighbourhood of Wepener, which was relieved on 24th April. The division followed General French to Thabanchu, which they occupied on 28th April, a few days before Lord Roberts commenced his northern advance on Pretoria. The division now followed Ian Hamilton, who commanded the army of the right flank, and Colvile, but rather to their right rear. Hence they were generally a long distance from the railway; and as we had still great scruples about commandeering, and transport was ill to get, Sir Leslie Rundle’s division was soon known all over the world as “the starving VIIIth”. The work they had to do from now till the end of the campaign was not of the glory-begetting sort, but they did it faithfully with a minimum of grumbling. General Rundle did not remain long at rest at Thabanchu. A few days after his arrival there he commenced to spread out his division so as to hold the country on Lord Roberts’ right rear. On 15th May M'Quetling’s Nek and the Modder Poort were occupied, then ClocoIan and Ladybrand. On the 26th he occupied Senekal, and on the 28th he received a message from Colonel Spragge that his battalion of Yeomanry were hard pressed at Lindley. It is well to recall the general position at this time. Lord Roberts, with two divisions and a large force of cavalry and artillery, had moved up the railway to the Vaal. Ian Hamilton, with a division and a brigade of cavalry, had accompanied him on his right flank via Lindley and Heilbron. Colvile, with a brigade and less than 100 mounted men, had followed Hamilton, and found it difficult to pass out of Lindley. Spragge, with 500 Yeomanry, had moved from the railway to Lindley to join Colvile; but the latter had left, and when he got Spragge’s call for help, had found himself unable to give it. As regards the enemy, the whole fighting force of the Free State was massed in the Senekal-Lindley-Bethlehem district. South and west of these points the country was practically free from Boers. Southeast of Senekal they were, however, stoutly opposing Rundle’s right. Lord Roberts says: “General Rundle could not go to Spragge’s relief, as he had been called on to support Brigadier General Brabant in the direction of Hammonia, nor could he leave Senekal until the arrival of Major General Clements, who with a portion of his brigade was proceeding to that place from Winburg. Under the impression, however, that he might indirectly relieve the hostile pressure on Lieutenant Colonel Spragge’s detachment, General Rundle, with a force of six companies of Yeomanry, two field batteries, Major General Campbell’s brigade, and the 2nd Royal West Kent Regiment, moved out four miles on the Bethlehem road and encountered the enemy, who were in considerable strength, at Kuring Kraus. After an engagement (generally known as Biddulphsberg) which had no decisive result, General Rundle fell back on Senekal, his casualties amounting to 30 killed and 150 wounded”. This reference is unsatisfactory, and the unofficial accounts of the engagement are more so. On the 28th it had been seen that the enemy’s position was strong, but on the 29th an attempt was made on his flank. The hill was shelled heavily, but our field artillery were, it is said by ‘The Daily Telegraph’ correspondent, who was present, unable to silence one Boer gun. During this artillery 'preparation’ several fires were started in the 4-foot-long grass,—one fire the same correspondent attributes to the carelessness of a Yeomanry officer. The infantry now advanced, the Grenadiers leading; but these fires embarrassed them greatly, causing the most horrible suffering to, and indeed the death of, many wounded men. After approaching the foot of the hill the troops were withdrawn. The correspondent imagined (on the 31st) that the action had relieved Spragge and helped Lord Methuen. As a matter of fact, its only result was that it gave the VIIIth Division, still strange to South African fighting, lessons they seem to have required, and fortunately did not forget. All accounts agree that the Grenadiers behaved with the most perfect steadiness throughout a very trying day. Their losses were approximately 35 men killed and 5 officers and nearly 100 men wounded. Colonel Lloyd was wounded three times, the last in the abdomen. It was while holding his hand on his colonel’s wound that Drummer Haines had his arm smashed. A week after this battle was fought Lord Roberts occupied Pretoria, and having by the action at Diamond Hill (11th and 12th June) driven the enemy back from the east of the capital, he at once commenced a series of operations with the view of surrounding the Boer forces in the north-east angle of the Orange River Colony. A strong column under Sir A Hunter was sent via Heidelberg and Frankfort towards Bethlehem (see 1st Sussex Regiment). Clements and Paget moved towards, and after stiff fighting occupied, Bethlehem on the 7th July (see 1st Royal Irish Regiment). Rundle’s division, also placed under the general direction of Sir A Hunter, occupied a line from Biddulphsberg to Ficksburg; ready to move inwards — i.e., north — at same time preventing the enemy from breaking south. The entrances to the Brand water basin at Slabbert’s Nek (see 1st Royal Irish), Retief Nek (see 2nd Black Watch), and Golden Gate having all, after severe fighting, been secured, Hunter and Rundle moved on Fouriesburg, whither Prinsloo and over 4000 Boers had retired. Driscoll’s Scouts of the VIIIth Division, after a forced march of twenty-five miles from Commando Nek, boldly entered the town on 26th July, other troops followed, and Sir Archibald Hunter himself arrived on the scene. The enemy had meanwhile retired in a northeasterly direction to Golden Gate, where Macdonald was in command. General Hunter followed on the 28th, and on the 30th Prinsloo and over 4000 men surrendered. Thereafter the VIIIth Division provided garrisons for Senekal, Bethlehem, Fouriesburg, Ladybrand, and Thabanchu. Until the close of the campaign the division remained in this district, which, from its mountain fastnesses and fertile valleys, was the chief stronghold of the enemy in the Free State. On 26th October 1900 Rundle, moving from Bethlehem to Harrismith, had stiff fighting with a strong force of Boers who held hills commanding the road. The troops engaged that day were the 2nd Grenadiers, 2nd Scots Guards, and Hampshire and Gloucestershire companies of the Imperial Yeomanry. The position was cleared “in spite of a very stubborn resistance”, Rundle’s losses being 3 killed and 20 wounded. During the two years and one month, commencing 20th April 1900, some part of the division was almost daily engaged. They had no great battle, but unceasing hard work and constant need for watchfulness. It is to their credit that they had no disasters or surrenders.” George was numbered amongst the 321 members who were serving with the South Africa Field Force who died at the town of Harrismith, Orange Free State, South Africa. By August 1900, Harrismith was in British hands and was subsequently used by Lieutenant-General Rundle as the base of his operations. It was at Harrismith that a General Order was issued to the men of the 8th Division, which was known as the 'Starving Eighth,’ thanking them for their cheerfulness and zeal in carrying out Lord Roberts’s orders. The prevalence of disease afflicted many of the British troops during the Second Boer War, but due primarily as the result of the comparatively healthy climate at Harrismith, the incidence of disease was less than elsewhere. The Dutch Reformed Church, which was the biggest building in the town, was converted into a hospital. In addition the church a large stone building was to the rear, which served the medical needs of the soldiers. Like George, by far and away the majority of those who were hospitalised at Harrismith were suffering from some form of disease, mainly Dysentery or Enteric Fever, which is now more commonly called Typhoid or Typhoid Fever. Only a minority of those who died at Harrismith had been killed in action or died of wounds, all of those who died at the hospital were buried in the Harrismith Town Cemetery, which also contains 2 war graves from the Great War, and 5 from the Second World War. By the end of hostilities on 31 May 1902, 262 soldiers had been interred at the cemetery where George is at rest. One of the graves is that of 6406, Trooper G Chamberlain of the 11th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry who died on Monday 19 November 1900, and was the brother of Joseph “Our Joe” Chamberlain who was then Britain’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, and was a brother of Arthur Neville Chamberlain the future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. British graves and memorials in South Africa from the Second Boer War have been the responsibility of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission since 2005, and the project involved the renovation of graves of over 24,000 casualties at no less than 223 sites.\n\nThe Second World War\n\n1939 -1945\n\nBOAKES, SIDNEY (SID) RONALD. Lance Corporal, 1872959.\n\n41 Fortress Company, Royal Engineers.\n\nDied Friday 22 October 1943. Aged 23.\n\nBorn and resided Kent.\n\nSon of John Boakes and Lily Elizabeth Boakes (née Packer).\n\nBuried Chungkai War Cemetery, Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Grave Ref: 6. P. 1.\n\nSidney’s father and mother married at the parish church of St. Mary the Virgin, Upchurch on Saturday 22 October 1904. Sidney was a pre war member of the Royal Engineers. His birth was recoded in the Milton, Kent, Registration District during the first quarter of 1920. Officers and other ranks of the 41 Fortress Company, Royal Engineers were serving in Malaya Command, when their unit was captured by the Japanese following the fall of Singapore on Sunday 15 February 1942. As the British forces had retreated across the Johore Strait they destroyed the causeway connecting the mainland with Singapore, and hoped for some breathing space after their retreat down the length of Malaya. It was the personnel of the 41 Fortress Company, Royal Engineers who destroyed the large arsenal of ammunition at Changi, although their primary role had been employed on coast defence duties. Sidney lost his life during the construction of the notorious Burma-Siam railway, which was built by Commonwealth, Dutch and American prisoners of war, to support the large Japanese army in Burma. During its construction, approximately 13,000 prisoners of war died and were buried along the railway. An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians also died during the course of the project, chiefly forced labour brought from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies or conscripted in Siam (Thailand) and Burma (Myanmar). The graves of those who died during the construction and maintenance of the Burma-Siam railway (except for the Americans, whose remains were repatriated) were transferred from camp burial grounds and isolated sites along the railway into three cemeteries at Chungkai and Kanchanaburi in Thailand and Thanbyuzayat in Burma (Myanmar). Chungkai where Sidney is at rest was one of the base camps on the railway and contained a hospital and church built by Allied prisoners of war. The war cemetery is the original burial ground, which was commenced by the prisoners themselves. Sidney’s death is recorded on page 34, volume 10 of the 1943 (Army) books of overseas deaths at General Register Office. Thanks were tendered to the late Steve Bates, ex Intelligence Corps W.O.II prior to his death in Thailand, for kindly providing the grave marker photograph shown above at Chungkai War Cemetery, Kanchanaburi, Thailand.\n\nEDMONDS, ASHLEY. Trooper, 6292402.\n\nQueen’s Bays (2nd Dragoon Guards), Royal Armoured Corps.\n\nDied Monday 16 October 1944. Aged 30.\n\nBorn and resided Kent.\n\nSon of Emma Edmonds (née Robinson) of Twinney, Upchurch, Sittingbourne, Kent, and the late Thomas Edmonds.\n\nCommemorated on the Cassino Memorial, Italy. Panel 1.\n\nAshley’s father and mother married at the parish church of St. Mary the Virgin, Upchurch on Saturday 10 October 1891. Ashley’s army number is indicative that he had originally served in the British army as a member of The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment). His birth was recoded in the Milton, Kent Registration District during the second quarter of 1914. The Queen’s Bays (2nd Dragoon Guards), Royal Armoured Corps in which Ashley was serving at the time of his death, arrived in the Middle East in November 1941, and was equipped initially with Crusader tanks. The regiment fought with great distinction and bravery at the ‘Cauldron’ and 'Knightsbridge’ during the Battle of Gazala, being continuously in action for 19 days, it being a record for an armoured regiment in the Western Desert. Having also taken part at the battles of El Alamein, the Tebaga Gap and at El Hamma, also the Mareth Line and then fought on to Tunis. The Queen’s Bays (2nd Dragoon Guards), Royal Armoured Corps arrived in Italy in May 1944. During the Italian Campaign, Ashley’s regiment was engaged in the actions of the Gothic Line (Friday 25 August 1944 to Sunday 17 December 1944). At the Battle of Coriano Ridge the regiment lost all but three of its tanks, and suffered 98 casualties in a matter of minutes when were sent into action against a screen of German anti-tank guns, which had including the versatile German 88mm guns. The Queen’s Bays (2nd Dragoon Guards), Royal Armoured Corps fought in the Po Valley, at the Crossing of the Lamone and at Rimini, Coriano Ridge and at Cesena. Post Ashley’s death, his old regiment helped force the Agenta Gap (Thursday 12 April 1945 to Thursday 19 April 1945) and was at Ferrara when the Germans surrendered. Prior to enlisting in army and serving in The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), Ashley had been a member of the Upchurch Football Club, and his (cropped) photograph was copied (with permission) from the book by Mike Gunnill ‘Upchurch in Old Picture Postcards,’ the original photograph shows the complete football team. Ashley’s death is recorded on page 132, volume 17 of the 1944 (Army) books of overseas deaths at the General Register Office.\n\nSKETCHLEY, PERCY ROBERT. Gunner, 1131932.\n\n12 (Honourable Artillery Company) Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery.\n\nDied Tuesday 10 April 1945. Aged 27.\n\nBorn and resided Kent.\n\nSon of Arthur Sketchley and Polly Sketchley (née Speed).\n\nHusband of Ruth Florence Sketchley (née Robinson) of Gillingham, Kent.\n\nBuried Ravenna War Cemetery, Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy.\n\nGrave Ref: I. G. 3.\n\nPercy’s birth was recoded in the Milton, Kent Registration District during the first quarter of 1918. His marriage to Ruth Florence Robinson was recoded in the Chatham, Kent Registration District during the fourth quarter of 1941. The 12 (Honourable Artillery Company) Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery in which Percy was serving at the time of his death was a Territorial Army formation. At the commencement of the Second World War, it was in London District and based at Finsbury, and was comprised of “C” and “D” Batteries which were equipped with 25 Pounder field guns plus limbers and Quad towing vehicles. The regiment made a number of moves within southern England during the early years of the Second World War, and in November 1940 “F” Battery was added to its strength. Whilst stationed at Cambridge, Cambridgeshire in September 1941, the 12 (Honourable Artillery Company) Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery became part of the 6th Armoured Division in which it then remained for the rest of the Second World War. Less “C” Battery which was detached for service with the 78th Division, the 12 (Honourable Artillery Company) Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery was posted to Algeria in late November 1942. Having served in Algeria and Tunisia during the North Africa Campaign, the regiment was then posted to Italy. The regiment remained fighting in the Italian Campaign for the remainder of the war, and was then posted to Klagenfurt, Austria in May 1945, still as part of the 6th Armoured Division. Percy’s death is recorded on page 191, volume 15 of the 1944 (Army) books of overseas deaths at General Register Office. It has not been possible to ascertain when, where, or how Percy died, one reason being that the cemetery where he is at rest near the village of Piangipane in the Commune and Province of Ravenna, was selected by the Army in 1945 for burials from the surrounding battlefields. Ravenna was taken by the Canadian Corps at the beginning of December 1944, and the burials in the cemetery there reflect the fighting for the Senio Line and the period of relative quiet during the first three months of 1945. Many of the men buried there were Canadians; one of the last tasks of the Canadian Corps before being moved to north-west Europe was the clearing of the area between Ravenna and the Comacchio Lagoon. Others are Indians from the 10th Indian Division, and New Zealanders. Ravenna War Cemetery, Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy where Percy is now at rest contains 955 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War, 63 of them unidentified. There are also 33 Great War burials, 30 of them brought in from Gradisca Communal Cemetery in 1973, the others from communal cemeteries at Arzigano, Fano and Monterosso al Mare. Among those buried in the cemetery are 33 men of the Jewish Infantry Brigade Group which was formed in September 1944, chiefly by volunteers from Palestine; the burials at Ravenna form the largest concentration of casualties from the Brigade.\n\nThe Second World War\n\n1939 -1945\n\nLost Casualties\n\nAUSTEN, DERIC or DERRICK STANLEY.

Depending on what data sources are accessed, results in a variety of spellings of the first Christian name of this casualty, including Deric, Derreck, Derrick, and Derek. His marriage to Miss Bernice Muriel Williamson, the daughter of Edward Alfred Williamson and the late Louisa Maria Williamson (née Clemons), was recorded in the Sheppey, Kent, Registration District during the second quarter of 1941. As can be seen on the accompanying photograph above, Bernice Muriel Austen was like her late husband only 23 years old when she died on Tuesday 6 June 1944. The headstone also commemorates Bernice’s mother Louisa Maria Williamson who died on Wednesday 4 March 1931, aged 31. The 6th (Kent) Army Brigade, Royal Field Artillery was formed by the amalgamation of The Royal East Kent Mounted Rifles (The Duke of Connaught’s Own), and The West Kent Yeomanry (Queen’s Own) in 1920. In 1921 it became the 97th (Kent Yeomanry) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, consisting of the Canterbury based 385th, the 386th Ashford based (Duke of Connaught’s Own Yeomanry) Batteries, and the Bromley based 387th and the Maidstone based 388th (Queen’s Own Yeomanry) Batteries. In 1938 the unit was re-designated as the 97th (Kent Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, and in 1939 the 143rd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery (Kent Yeomanry) was formed as a duplicate of 97th Regiment, as part of the Territorial Army, with 385th and 387th Batteries. It served with 5th Infantry Division during the Fall of France, seeing action at St. Valery-en-Caux in June 1940 before destroying its guns and equipment prior to being evacuated at Dunkirk, prior to which the regiment was located in 15 different places in the 18 days before finally being evacuated from France. After arriving back in the United Kingdom, the regiment was reformed at Abergele, North Wales. In February 2008 it was noted whilst the transcriber of these Upchurch commemorations had been carrying out the brief commemorations of the personnel of the 97th (Kent Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, that several of those who died whilst serving in the regiment had been Welsh, which for an English county Yeomanry unit seemed a bit strange. All was made clear during a conversation with Tenterden, Kent resident, the late Major (Retd) Jack Bazzard, M.C., R.A., who joined the regiment pre war as a Gunner at Ashford, Kent. Jack told the transcriber that he clearly remembered the influx of the Welshmen occurring when the regiment was based in South Wales, and that he had helped to train them when he was a Sergeant. From North Wales, the regiment did indeed go to South Wales, initially being sent to Swansea for training, and later to man naval guns, which was in defence of the busy docks. In February 1941 the regiment was relocated to Essex in a coastal defence role, where the officers and other ranks were billeted in various places, including Galleywood, Roxwell, St. Osyth and Writtle. During this period a lot of training for overseas duty including a week on Salisbury Plain. The regiment manned guns on Martello Towers, which were located on the coast. At the end of August 1941, the regiment was assigned to reinforce the army in the Middle East, and was moved from Essex to Scotland by train, and embarked on the 20,097-ton P&O Line ship R.M.S. Orontes, which was in use as a troopship from 1940 to 1947. The regiment was delayed once aboard the ship, until the convoy WS11 of which it was in and that was being assembled, was finally completed off Oversay. The regiment was at sea for almost two months, during the course of which the convoy split into Fast and Slow portions on Thursday 4 September to proceed separately to Freetown, the R.M.S. Orontes, which was also carrying the convoy Commodore sailed with the fast ships comprised of 9 vessels. The revised convoy was escorted by the battlecruiser H.M.S. Repulse, and the destroyers H.M.S. Encounter and H.M.S. Nestor, which were joined off Freetown by H.M.S. Velox and H.M.S. Wrestler, plus the corvette H.M.S. Starwort, arriving at Freetown on Monday 13 October. R.M.S. Orontes, eventually arrived at Bombay, India on Thursday 23 October 1941, where the 97th (Kent Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment, Royal Artillery personnel were quickly transferred to the troopship H.M.T. Devonshire the following day for passage to Iraq. After landing at Basra, Iraq, the regiment was posted to the Habbaniya area in order for it to acclimatize and to carry out desert training. The regiment served in the 10th Army as part of the 10th Indian Division in Iraq until late May 1942, when it was then sent to serve in Libya, North Africa, by which time the 470th Battery had also been formed. In Libya, the 97th (Kent Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment, Royal Artillery was ordered to take part in the defence of Tobruk against the Axis forces, which were being commanded by General Irwin Rommel. Because the British 2-Pounder anti-tank gun was found to be virtually useless against the German Tiger tanks, the regiment was assigned with its 25-Pounder field guns to be used in an anti-tank defensive role in front of the infantry. The Germans attacked on Thursday 28 May and with commendable speed reached the Tobruk area. On Tuesday 16 June 1942 some of the personnel of the regiment were camped in Salum defending the route back to Egypt, where they were ordered by their Colonel to make a stand, until all of the light troops had pulled back past them. On Monday 29 June 1942 equipped with 25-Pounder field guns, the 97 (The Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery arrived at El Alamein, Egypt, prior to the commencement of ‘The First Battle of El Alamein’ which was fought from Wednesday 1 July 1942 to Monday 27 July 1942. On the first day of the battle when Derrick was killed, the regiment occupied Deir el Shein, a large saucer shaped depression in the middle of the Alamein defence line. Early on the morning of Wednesday 1 July 1942, the Commanding Officer, seeing that the regiment was in no fit condition to fight, went off to Corps Headquarters to obtain permission from the Corps Commander to withdraw for a few days in order to re-fit. Permission to withdraw and re-fit was granted, and a staff officer was sent back to the regiment with the orders to that effect, but through no fault of his he arrived too late. By the time that the staff officer arrived in the area, the German 21st Panzer Division had already attacked Deir el Shein, The 18th Indian Infantry Brigade which had been hastily sent from service in Iraq, supported by twenty three 25-Pounder field guns of the 97 (The Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, 121st Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, and the 124th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, plus 16 of the new 6-pounder anti-tank guns which were manned by The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), plus nine Matilda tanks succeeded in holding out the whole day during a period of desperate fighting, but by evening the Germans had succeeded in overrunning them all. Soon after the Germans had arrived, which at that time were thought to have been several miles away, one of the first victims of the regiment to be killed by the sporadic enemy shelling was 26 year old Captain, Maurice Charles Allfrey, D.S.O. who was killed outright. A total of 7 deaths are recorded for the regiment on the day that Derrick fell, and as a 25-Pounder had a crew of 5/6, it would seem likely that Derrick was a member of the gun-crew which 27 year old Lieutenant Desmond Herbert Biggleston from Canterbury, Kent, was recorded as standing on when the gun received a direct hit killing the entire gun-crew. Under the cover of darkness the survivors of the regiment that were able to do so, made their way on foot through the enemy lines, and after walking 25 miles rejoined the regiment the next day. Shortly after Derrick’s death the regiment joined 7th Armoured Division in July 1942, and remained with it until December 1942. In October 1943 97 (The Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery rejoined 10th Indian Division, serving in North Africa, Palestine and Italy until the end of the war. In 1947 it became the 297th (Kent Yeomanry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, before finally being disbanded surplus to peacetime requirements. During the Second World War, those members of the regiment who perished during the tragic sinking of the Italian cargo/passenger ship S.S. Scillin, by the British S class submarine H.M.S. Sahib 10 miles north of Cape Milazzo in the Tyrrhenian Sea on Saturday 14 November 1942, whilst they were prisoners of war, were the most casualties suffered by the 97th (Kent Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery on any one particular date. Gunner Austen’s death is recorded on page 32, volume 13 of the 1942 (Army) books of overseas deaths at General Register Office, with his Christian name spelt DERIC.\n\nThe Austen family grave at Upchurch to the fore of the tree, and behind the war grave of Stuart William Arthur Mercer.\n\nCORBETT, GEORGE HENRY.

George is also commemorated on the Oak Bay Cenotaph, Uplands Park, and on a memorial plaque in the foyer of the Gravesend, Kent sports centre, which is located on the site of the former R.A.F. Gravesend airfield.\n\nThe marriage of George’s parents who were both natives of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was recorded in the Tonbridge, Kent, Registration District during the first quarter of 1914, it being shortly before they emigrated to Canada. Born at Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent on Monday 7 September 1885; George’s father Henry Claude Corbett enlisted in the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada on Friday 21 July 1916, at which time he stated that he was employed as a Clerk, and named his wife Mabel Corbett residing at Rosthern, Saskatchewan, as his next of kin. The Corbett family made a number of visits back to the United Kingdom from Canada, including one in 1920/1921 when the family had sailed from Montreal on the 11419 ton Canadian Pacific Ocean Services Ltd, liner SS Corsican, on Friday 29 October 1920, in order to visit relatives and stayed at the home of George’s uncle, George Thomas Adams at “Woodstock,” 154, Upper Grosvenor Road, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent. At the time of the visit in 1920, the Corbett family address for correspondence was Box 165, Rosthern, Saskatchewan, Canada. In view of George’s place of birth, the ship which the family travelled on another occasion was somewhat apt, comprised of George’s parents, 6 year old George and his 2 year old sister Phyllis Mabel Corbett, visited the United Kingdom in 1925. They returned to Canada on the 16,289-ton White Star Line passenger liner “Regina,” which sailed from Liverpool, Lancashire, and arrived at Quebec on Sunday 31 May 1925. The family moved to reside at Oak Bay, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada in 1929. George was educated at the High School, Cranmore Road, Oak Bay, from which he graduated in 1935. Shortly after his graduation, George went with his family to England, and following his successful application, he enrolled at the De Havilland Aircraft Construction, Technical School at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, having by then had a life long passion for building model aircraft and studying the construction of aircraft. Having enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in November 1937, George obtained his Royal Aero Club Aviators’ Certificate at the De Havilland School of Flying on Thursday 29 June 1939, flying a Tiger Moth, Gypsy 130. At the time of gaining his Pilots Licence (No.18931), he was employed as an Aeronautical Engineer, and his address for correspondence was 21, Altham Court, Hatfield, Hertfordshire. At the commencement of the Second World War, George was on a two month visit to his family in Canada, which he cut short and returned to England in order to fulfill his Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commitment. All of the Flying Training Schools which were in existence on the day the Great Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, were redesignated Service Flying Training Schools, and George was trained at the No. 9 Flying Training School, R.A.F. Hullavington, Chippenham, Wiltshire. On the completion of his flying training at No. 9 Flying Training School, George was posted to serve at No.7 Operational Training Unit, R.A.F. Hawarden, Flintshire, North Wales on Sunday 7 July 1940, and after converting to Spitfires, George was posted to No. 66 Squadron, Royal Air Force at R.A.F. Coltishall, Norfolk on Friday 26 July 1940 as a Pilot Officer, and soon found himself taking part in the Battle of Britain. He was posted with his squadron to R.A.F. Kenley, Surrey on Tuesday 3 September 1940, and at 1735 hours on Monday 9 September, George was credited with his first confirmed hit which was a Messerschmitt Bf 109. He was flying his Spitfire (N 3049) as Blue 3 at 22,000 feet, on Monday 9 September 1940, when a formation of enemy aircraft were spotted and intercepted. Completing a steep left hand turn he saw the Messerschmitt just in front and below him. Diving, a two second burst from his machine guns at about 250 yards caught the enemy aircraft, and white vapour was then seen to be pouring from the fuselage. George continued to press home his attack, firing two more bursts into the enemy aircraft, but was rapidly losing height and had to break off his attack over Maidstone, Kent. Attempting to rejoin his squadron, George was attacked by three enemy fighter aircraft. Turning towards them, a chase then ensued and then he felt an explosion under his seat. The cockpit of the Spitfire then filed with smoke, and the control column jumped from his hand and became jammed in the left hand corner of the cockpit. George’s Spitfire then went into a tight spiral dive to the left, having been wounded at 1800hours he had baled out of his stricken aircraft over East Grinstead, Sussex after being shot down by a German Messerschmitt Bf 109. He parachuted from the stricken aircraft at about 12,000 feet, and landed near the village of Cowden, Kent, it being only about 8 miles from the birthplace of both his parents. Slightly injured George was then taken off flying duty for a few days. Later in September 1940, 66 Squadron, Royal Air Force moved to R.A.F. Gravesend, Kent, and by Friday 27 September George was back in action, this time flying Spitfire (P 9575) as Finbus Blue 2. During the long and arduous afternoon his squadron and 72 squadrons plus 92 squadrons were involved in a large air battle over Kent. George attacked a Junkers JU 88, hitting the port engine of the enemy bomber. He flew to within 50 yards of the damaged bomber until the smoke from the burning plane filled his Spitfire. Banking away he felt his own aircraft hit and one elevator was shattered, in addition to which the rudder partially jammed. With his engine smoking George was forced to land near Orpington, Kent. He later reported that he believed that his aircraft had been hit by a local Anti-Aircraft gun battery, and subsequent enquiries tended to verify and add credence to George’s theory. The Junkers which George had attacked crashed at Chelsfield, Orpington, Kent. On Tuesday 8 October 1940 flying Spitfire (R 6779) as Blue 2 in B Flight, George took off from R.A.F. Gravesend, Kent, at 0830 hours along with Flying Officer ‘Bobby’ Oxspring (1919-1979), who was flying Spitfire (R6800 LZ-N) and Pilot Officer C. A. Cooke flying Spitfire (X4421 LZ-?). Pilot Officer Cooke had been forced to bale out of his Spitfire (R6689) over Ashford, Kent at 1330 hours on Wednesday 4 September 1940, when he was shot down by a Messerschmitt Bf 109, and had been wounded. Refueling at R.A.F. Hawkinge, Kent, having participated in a convoy patrol over the English Channel, George took off and joined up with another section over east Kent seaside town of Herne Bay. The R.A.F. fighters which George had joined in the Herne Bay area, were taken totally by surprise and attacked by a number of German fighter aircraft of Stab JG26, which had the sun behind them. Flown by the ‘ace’ Major (later Generalleutnant) Adolf “Dolfo” Galland, his Messerschmitt Bf 109 closed fast on George’s Spitfire which was badly hit, bursting into flames at 0930hours, and George became ‘kill’ 43, of the 104 credited to Adolf Galland between Sunday 12 May 1940 and Thursday 26 April 1945. George’s Spitfire crashed on Bayford Marsh, about a mile to the north of the village of Upchurch, and upon removal from the crashed aircraft his body it was found to be riddled with bullet wounds. Nearby lay his twenty-first birthday present from his family, which was a gold watch that he had opened early as his birthday was not until 4 November. The Vicar of nearby Lower Halstow, the Reverend William Joseph Wright who had been the incumbent since 1937, quickly made his way across the marsh to the crash site to render assistance, on the off-chance that George had survived the crash. The Reverend Wright later sent a letter to the Most Reverend Harold Eustace Sexton, D.D. (1888-1972) the then Anglican Bishop of British Columbia, who had served in the Great War as Chaplain with Canadian Expeditionary Force. In his letter to Canada, The Reverend Wright wrote that George’s body was removed from the wreck of his aircraft riddled with bullets, and that death had been instant. He added that he offered prayers and gave a blessing beside the downed Spitfire, and that “The pilot’s body was then covered, his parachute being his shroud.” George was laid to rest at Upchurch churchyard with military honours as befitted his rank, with his funeral service being taken by the Vicar of Upchurch and the Reverend William Joseph Wright, and which was attended by members of the Royal Air Force and other service organizations, in addition to members of the local populace. The church still maintains his grave to an exceptionally high standard, and in 1981 a memorial service was held for him. In 1982 the engine and propeller of Spitfire (R 6779) was unearthed by a group of aviation archaeologists from the cloying mud of Bayford Marsh, and the remains of his George’s aircraft can be seen at the Tangmere Military Museum. Only a few days after receiving official notice of George’s death, Mabel Corbett received a letter written by her son in the weeks prior his loss. In his letter to his mother George described two early mishaps, including his escape by parachute, and revealed a personal insight into the importance of the battle he was fighting. “Having got out OK, my confidence has been tremendously increased and I want you to be confident also. We’re seeing plenty of action here every day and I’ll be back in the fight tomorrow. The Jerries are a long way from getting supremacy in the air, and until they get it, which they won’t, there’ll be no invasion.” George’s sister Phyllis who had served in the Second World War, visited her brother’s grave at Upchurch where she planted a Canadian Maple in his memory. It was learned whilst carrying out this brief commemoration of George, that his sister Phyllis Corbett (later Cooley) kept in regular correspondence with a number people in England. When aviation archeologists removed the propeller and engine of George’s Spitfire for restoration, his was invited to the aircraft museum doing the work. On the same day that George was killed, his squadron also lost 23 year old Croydon, Surrey native, Sergeant (Pilot) Rufus Arthur Ward, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, who was flying Spitfire (N3043) which was shot down at 1155 hours by a Messerschmitt Bf 109, and crashed near Valley View Road, Borstal, Rochester, Kent. Rufus had enlisted in the Royal Auxiliary Air Force on Tuesday 3 March 1936, and transferred to the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in September 1937. Rufus was believed to have baled out but died subsequently died of his injuries, and is at rest at Mitcham Road Cemetery, Croydon. The impressive stained glass window in rememberance of George at the parish church of St. Mary the Virgin, Elgin Road, Oak Bay, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, was commissioned by the Corbett family, and depicts George wearing his Royal Air Force uniform, a life preserver, flight boots and clutching a flying helmet and earphones, and he looks upward in an image illustrating the Ascension, when the Bible says Jesus Christ rose to heaven following his Crucifixion. Every year his sister placed a bouquet of roses at the base of the window. When Phyllis became too old to complete the task, a parishioner at St. Mary’s church took over from her, and now, every year without fail, on the Sunday closest to Battle of Britain Day on 15 September, and on Remembrance Day on 11 November, a single rose appears underneath the window. Long may the practice continue? Having suffered from Alzheimer’s disease in the latter years of her life, Phyllis Cooley (née Corbett) died on Tuesday 1 February 2011. Aged 83, George’s father Henry died at Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on Tuesday 1 July 1969. Robert Wardlow (Bobby) Oxspring, who was one of the pilots who took off from R.A.F. Gravesend with George on Tuesday 8 October 1940, rose to the rank of Group Captain and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and 2 Bars, plus the Air Force Cross, in addition to which he was awarded the Dutch Flying Cross on Friday 10 January 1947. He retired from the Royal Air Force in 1968, and died on Tuesday 8 August 1989, and is at rest at Cranwell, Lincolnshire. Adolf “Dolfo” Joseph Ferdinand Galland, who shot down George, was born at Westerholt, Westphalia, on Tuesday 19 March 1912. He achieved 104 aerial victories during the course of 705 missions, all on which were flown on the Western Front. Having been wounded Adolf Galland surrendered himself to American forces at Tegernsee, Bavaria, Germany on Saturday 5 May 1945. He was then held in military custody for two years. In October 1948, he took a position with the Argentine Air Force. There followed many offers to act as consultant to armament firms who would equip the new German Luftwaffe. He made his choices and settled down to prosperous and lively decades as a businessman. In his final years he divided his time between his home in Germany, and his bungalow by the Alicante coast of Spain. Adolf Galland passed away on Friday 9 February 1996 at Remagen-Oberwinter, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. After the Second World War, he formed several notable friendships with former British air aces, which had included Air Marshall James Edgar “Johnnie” Johnson C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., D.F.C. Group Captain Sir Douglas Bader, C.B.E., D.S.O., D.F.C. and Wing Commander Robert Stanford Tuck, D.S.O., D.F.C., A.F.C. The memorial window photograph, which accompanies this commemoration, is with the kind permission of the Times Colonist, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nOur sincere thanks are due to A. Chafe of Brentwood Bay, Central Saanich, British Columbia, Canada, for kindly providing the above photograph for inclusion here of George’s grave, when it still with its original grave marker.\n\nSKINNER, GEORGE. Civilian casualty.\n\nDied Friday 23 November 1944. Aged 58.\n\nBorn Upchurch, Kent Sunday 6 December 1885.\n\nSon of William Albert Skinner of 22, Upper Brents, Faversham, Kent, and the late Emily Skinner (née Scott).\n\nHusband of Louisa Alice Skinner (née Harrison) (1884 – 1956) of 24, Aldeburgh Street, Greenwich, London.\n\nWilliam died at his home 24, Aldeburgh Street, Greenwich, London, SE10, when a (Doodlebug) German flying bomb exploded in the street. When the Skinner family had resided at Upchurch, they lived at Dennis Cottages, Wallbridge Lane, which is where it was residing when the 1891 census was carried out. At the time of the 1901 census, the Skinner family resided at 12, Windmill Hill, Upchurch, Kent. Head of the house was 45year old Canterbury, Kent native William Albert Skinner, who was employed as a Cement Factory Labourer. The then 15year old George was recorded by the census enumerator as being employed as a Brickfield Labourer. George married Hoo, Isle of Grain, Kent native Miss Louisa Alice Harrison, who was a daughter of John Harrison and Mary Ann Harrison, at the parish church of St. James, Cooling, Rochester, Kent on Saturday 21 September 1907. When the 1911 census was conducted, 25year old George was recorded as being the head of the house at 153, Station Road, Rainham, Kent, and employed as a Clay Miner. George’s late mother Emily Skinner died on Monday 2 October 1922 at Faversham, Kent, and his father; William Albert Skinner died on Friday 4 February 1949 at Faversham, Kent. George and his wife Louisa had been long time residents of Aldeburgh Street, Greenwich, and they are both recorded as residing there on the 1918 London Electoral Register.\n\nIn addition to the 3 Upchurch Second World War casualties who are commemorated on the memorial plaque, which is located in the parish church of St. Mary the Virgin, the following casualties all lost their lives on Wednesday 16 August 1944 at the Railway Bridge, Oak Lane, Upchurch. They being amongst the 8 fatalities which resulted from a tragic train accident when the 3:35pm Victoria, London to Ramsgate, Isle of Thanet, Kent express was derailed at the Railway Bridge. At the time of the disaster, the train was carrying approximately 600 passengers, many of which were servicemen. The tragedy was the result of a Spitfire clipping the wing of a flying bomb, which crashed into the railway bridge. In addition to the fatalities, 33 people where seriously injured, and 28 slightly hurt. Miraculously both the train driver Charles Barnett and David Humphreys the fireman escaped with only minor injuries. Following the crash, those who died were removed to the premises of Brunt and Aylett in Newington High Street which was used as a makeshift mortuary. A first-aid post was set up in Rainham School, to which Charles Barnett and David Humphreys were both taken for treatment. Of the many civilians of the Commonwealth whose deaths were due to enemy action in the Second World War, the names of some 67,092 casualties are commemorated in the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour, located near St. George’s Chapel in Westminster Abbey, London.\n\nBEADLE, ETHEL EMILY.

Grave Ref: Section E. Grave 18.\n\nAt the time of the 1911 census, Albert was recorded as being an Inmate at the Bromley Union Workhouse,Farnborough, Kent. He had also been on the training ship Exmouth, which was one of the training ships, which were used to train poor boys in all aspects of seamanship preparing them for a career at sea. The Metropolitan Asylums Board borrowed the Exmouth from the Royal Navy in 1877. Previously the ship had seen active service in the Baltic and had been converted from sail to steam in 1854. The Board moored the Exmouth off the coast of Grays, Essex, and used it as a way to provide vocational training to boys in their care. The Exmouth remained off Grays until shortly before the commencement of the Second World War. When Albert had enlisted in the Royal Navy as a Boy at Chatham, Kent on Sunday 12 October 1919 for 12 years, his employment entry on his service sheet was T.S. Exmouth.
