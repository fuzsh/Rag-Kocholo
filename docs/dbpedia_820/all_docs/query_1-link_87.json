Unfortunately, this pencil drawing is of little assistance in identifying the site. It shows only a single, small, gable-roofed structure backed by a dense stand of tall evergreens. The place could be almost any forested tract in the Pacific Northwest, which fact in itself is rather confusing, since as late as 1856, at least, a fairly extensive area near the fort site is known to have been cleared of trees and under cultivation as a garden. The trees in the Scammon sketch appear much taller than the 20-foot ones mentioned by Mrs. Victor in 1872. See note 15 below.\n\n15Francis Fuller Victor, All Over Oregon and Washington (San Francisco, 1872), 43.\n\n16Oregonian (Portland, Ore.), June 27, 1885, p. 3, col. 3.\n\n17Elliott Coues (ed.), History of the Expedition under the Command of Lewis and Clark (4 vols., New York, 1893), III, 904-905, note 3.\n\n18Handwritten inscriptions on the reverse sides of three photographs taken on the occasion of W Wheeler's visit and now in the Oregon Historical Society bear the dated August 20, 1899.\" That these photographs were taken for Wheeler is sufficiently proved by the fact that two of them form the illustrations for his first published account of his visit to the site.

In 1949, Mrs. Milton York, who had lived on the fort site as a young girl, said that the two surviving cherry trees then on the property, and which show in the 1899 photographs were planted by her father, Joseph B. Stevenson, between about 1876 and 1881.

From internal evidence, it would appear that P. W. Gillette was the author of the article, or \"letter to the editor,\" contained in the unidentified clipping in O. H.

Quaife, op. cit., 317. However, this description does not agree with Clark's diagrams, which would appear to have precedence.\n\n52DeVoto, op. cit., 336.\n\n53This account of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and its stay at Fort Clatsop is based largely upon the original journals already cited in note 1 above. The estimate of the significance of the expedition is based upon the introductions to these works and upon other studies listed in the bibliography at the end of the historical narrative section of this report (see pp. 37-40 below).\n\n54Oregon Historical Society, Scrapbook 21, p. 42; Deposition of C. W. Shane, June 15, 1900, in Proceedings of the Oregon Historical Society...1900, 20-21. In 1856 surveyors' notes show that there was a \"Shane's House\" 5.2 feet west of a point 148.5 feet north of the 1/4 corner between Sections 35 and 36, T.8N., R.10W., W.M. Notes of Joseph W. and John Trutch, typescript, in Clatsop County Historical Society. However, it is not clear if this was the house erected by Shane in 1851 or a later one built by his brother, Franklin. From Shane's deposition one gains the impression that the 1851 house was farther west from the edge of the bluff.\n\n55Oath of P. W. Gillette, November 21, 1855; Oath of Charles W.
