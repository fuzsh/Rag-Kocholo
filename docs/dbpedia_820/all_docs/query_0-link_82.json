No-one did--or at least no-one made it to the end. As I have probably pointed out more than once in these web-pages, the reason the photo was taken at all was due to Clive Anderson's plea to Joe Avery at a School Council meeting \"...it IS the Diamond Jubilee, sir!\" which had Harry Mees rolling his eyes and even George Cowan's eyebrows momentarily raised. I know no-one did because May 18th was the day I passed my driving test and I arrived late, waving my pink \"pass\" slip at my buddies who were on the other side of the semi-circle (I am second to the left in the fifth row in front of the dining hut). Just prior to the photo being taken, Joe told Malcolm Cox (fifth row, just under the pavilion clock) to comb his hair out of his face. It was probably as a reult of this that Victor Mietkowski (his neighbor to the left) decide to flash Joe a V-sign (clearly visible in the photo). It was an unusually sunny day, which is why the photo is so bad--the contrast is much too high--and we spent most of the afternoon basking in the long grass next to the Terrapin huts.

As for accents in the U.K. I have noticed the same thing. People do not sound quite as they once did. I also notice the vocabuary changing. When would try to avoid using what I regarded as North American words, such as \"commuter\", the reply would come \"you mean commuter\". After leaving school, two periods of work in Scotland left me very familiar with the various accents there. ARS hailed from Dunfermaline in the West Fife coalfield where miners spoke with a very different accent. He spoke \"pan loaf\" which is the \"received\" accent of educated Scots. Pronounciation of the letter \"Jay\" as \"Jye\" is common enough, as is 'mingies' for 'Menzies'. Does anyone recall hearing him use this word? The well-known entertainer Harry Lauder came from Arbroath which is where ARS taught for many years. Harry spoke a in sort of Anglicised Fifeshire accent not at all like ARS. I can well imagine that a few years amongst the Sassenachs would modify ARS' panloaf accent.\n\nName:\n\nRichard Buckley\n\nEmail:\n\nrbuckleyREMOVENOSPAM @spaceplanner.co.uk\n\nDate:\n\n12/18/2002\n\nTime:\n\n5:02:38 PM\n\nComments\n\nSteve Mulliner asks how many boys tried to appear twice in the 1971 panoramic photograph. I appear on the left at the very end of the 1960 Golden Jubilee photograph and to this day regret being too timid to run around to the other end when the camera began to turn. I recall that the photographer had a very bad limp, no doubt incurred in some act of extreme bravery during the war, which prompted lots of ungallant schoolboy shouts of 'hoppity' as the poor man ran, or rather lurched, around trying to set the photograph up.\n\nOn another matter altogether, having recently moved to a village just outside Cirencester, I looked up Harry Mees in the book and gave him a call. We had a long talk and I'm delighted to say he was in good shape and sounded just like the old Harry so many of us remember. What's more, to my surprise and even greater delight, my recollection of his famous story about the crewless GWR train (the crew having got off the footplate against all the regulations to investigate a broken signal in the Severn Tunnel) setting off by itself down the slope of the tunnel, running up the other side and then running back down again as the Guard wondered what on earth the driver was doing was, more or less, true.\n\nName:\n\nDave Buckley\n\nEmail:\n\ndavidbuckleyREMOVENOSPAM @beeb.net\n\nDate:\n\n12/18/2002\n\nTime:\n\n4:56:49 PM\n\nComments\n\nRef. Phil Chesterman's comment about Virtus Non Stemma - I assume he is refering to the School Song which accompanies the title page. For everyone's information, it came from a radio programme put out in 1960 on what was the Third Programme. The song is only a short clip from about a two minute section of the programme, which I found on a tape made up at the time by the late Jim Golland. (In fact I recorded the actual assembly when the BBC came along, but sadly the tape has gone missing. Pity as it had Dr.Simpson really blowing up at the end of the assembly!) The whole tape is a bit of a treasure trove of sound clips of the school in general, including an item from a House Christmas production from around 1959/60 or earlier (which has ben recorded at a slow spedd which I cannot play at the moment). When I find time I will go through the tape and copy it to Minidisk for the archives and let Jeff have a copy for the web site. I am at present sorting out good quality tranfers of some of the G and S productions from the mid-60's onto CD so that Rod Clark in Wales can make up sound files for Jeff to put direct onto the site.\n\nName:\n\nPhil Chesterman\n\nEmail:\n\nphilconnieREMOVENOSPAM @shaw.ca\n\nDate:\n\n12/18/2002\n\nTime:\n\n3:24:19 PM\n\nComments\n\nre: Virtus Non Stemma\n\nTo Brian Hester can only say that I have no intention of spoiling anything. I left HCS in 1951, way before the organ era, but in the middle of the George Thorn and Dr. ARS regime. Now, I have no intention of insulting the English nation, but have only spent the odd week here and there in the UK since 1960, but have noticed an amazing change in accents.\n\nTo me STRIFE used to sound like STRAIF when old George had his way. In this 1960 (?)recording it's become STROIF. What would it be today ? Is this estuary English ?\n\nJust curious !\n\nFar more earth-shattering was the shock that I was about to hear the voice of the good Doctor Simpson, in my own house in Calgary. Being December, the windows are only open a crack; should I close them in case the neighbours hear. Put earmuffs on the cat to prevent a visit from the SPCA ?\n\nThen came the voice of educated Scotland (we had a master called D.J. King - instead of DeeJAY, ARS called him DeeJYE) but low and behold Dr. ARS sounded 99% English ! The pupils taught the teacher.\n\nName:\n\nColin Dickins\n\nEmail:\n\ncolin.dickinsREMOVENOSPAM @blueyonder.co.uk\n\nDate:\n\n12/18/2002\n\nTime:\n\n12:50:49 PM\n\nComments\n\nMy \"contribution\" to the Guestbook today was, in fact, part of an e-mail written earlier to Jeff Maynard personally. (inserted into the guestbook at Colin's request! - Jeff)\n\nI checked the link above my piece just now and it works, so Paul Romney must just have been unlucky. Try again, Paul. (if you are using a slow dial-up connection, it may take a few moments to load - Jeff)\n\nI find my adopted role as apologist for a man I disliked and feared rather strange. I did respect him, as teacher and headmaster, and my contention has always been that he achieved great things for the School and for those pupils who chose to avail themselves of the opportunities. I'm afraid I availed myself all too little of the opportunities, but I certainly benefited somehow, as did many other \"non-achievers\". But Paul makes the same point, although I do discern an unwritten \"in spite of\" in what he says.\n\nAs for antisemitism, I have said before that I never discerned it and several Jewish OG's I questioned on the allegation have told me that they were neither aware of it nor victims. I also questioned a senior master I'm still in touch with who loathed the man. He has little good to say of him, but absolutely refuted the allegation. He said that Simpson would \"take the best, no matter who they were or where they came from. He only wanted the best.\"\n\nName:\n\nPaul Romney\n\nEmail:\n\nType your e-mail address here\n\nDate:\n\n12/18/2002\n\nTime:\n\n10:49:47 AM\n\nComments\n\nUnfortunately, the URL in Colin Dickins's message yielded neither sound nor a sound prompt, so I was unable to refresh my memory of the Simpson voice. Surely, though, the Simpson legacy is a matter of remembered words and deeds rather than tone. If indeed his anti-Semitism, and the foibles recorded in Jim Golland's dispassionate memoir, fitted ill with the Zeitgeist of the 1960s, that fact arguably speaks well for the 1960s. As to the supposed decline in educational standards since then, and the merits of the new reforms, I have no personal opinion, having left the UK in 1966, but I find a very different perspective from Colin's expressed in Ross McKibbin's article in the London Review of Books of 28 November.\n\nThe past year has given me a fascinating perspective on the Harrow Couunty debate by putting me in touch with most of the Wembley Manor Junior School class from which I graduated to Harrow County in 1956. Most of us seemed pretty much on a par, regardless of how we had fared academically back in the 1950s and '60s, but one stand-out was a man who had never ranked high in the class and had failed the Eleven Plus. He had subsequently become an electrical engineer and the joint owner of a components manufacturer with six factories in the UK, US and China. It was a striking illustration of how far one could get without O Level Latin.\n\nName:\n\nray sewell\n\nEmail:\n\nrayREMOVENOSPAM @raymondsewell.co.uk\n\nDate:\n\n12/18/2002\n\nTime:\n\n10:17:18 AM\n\nComments\n\nForm 2D 1954 Whilst at the Tuck Shop one morning fighting desparately for a jam doughnut SOME LITTLE TEA_LEAF stole my prized collection of match box and cheese labels.Will the culprit now own up please!!

He sounds so measured and reasonable - as I have always insisted he could be (and probably mostly was), despite the scorn poured on him by so many contributors to the site - and I realise I have unfairly heard him in my mind as the ranter he is reputed to be in popular caricature. He certainly had his manic and obsessive moments in my day, as in others, but I think he just fitted ill with the hedonistic, cynical, soft left, nihilistic zeitgeist of the sixties and his qualities and achievements were dismissed. The decline in educational standards and rigour over thirty years would have confirmed his own convictions. He's probably up (or down!) there wryly approving of current belated attempts by recent governments to reverse the decline. He may not have been a \"nice\" man, but he was a dedicated teacher and headmaster.

The event took place at the school starting on Apr 6th 1970 and was previewed in the Harrow Observer dated Mar 31st and then reported again after the event.

I do remember very clearly on D-Day being allowed to join a group in the then \"new chem lab\" to hear Churchill announce the Normandy landings. There was a very large \"start second front now\" message on the bridge over the railway just opposite the school.

Is there anyone else out there who remembers it?\n\nBernie's roneo-ed notes, starting with a blow-by-blow account of things to see out of the window of the train to Rome via Basle, told us more than we could ever have wanted to know or had time to read. How wonderful and learned education was in those days!\n\nFor many of us the journey was memorable for an encounter with a group from a girl's school in Birmingham on the train coming back. Bernie was - probably justifiably for the 1950s - worried about this, but was courtesy personified when he received a delegation from the girls' group, asking for permikssion to mingle. 'Certainly, dear lady' is a phrase that sticks in the memory, though he can't have approved.\n\nBut best of all was the encounter with a Greek sailor on a hill above Naples. (Yes, a Lesbian, or should I say Lesbiote, like all the best Greek sailors, as Bernie commented to us later.) They conversed I think in Greek, and Bernie responded with grave sympathy when the sailor asked him if he knew his cousin in London. He even accepted (or have I invented this??) a pair of boots, with a promise to deliver them to said cousin. Afterwards he explained to us how Greeks treat the world like a village, and how impossible it would be too refuse such a request. A lesson well learned which has stood me in good stead often since.\n\nThank you Bernie!\n\nNicholas de Lange 195562\n\nName:\n\nSteve Freedman\n\nEmail:\n\nSteveREMOVENOSPAM @sjfreedman.co.uk\n\nDate:\n\n12/3/2002\n\nTime:\n\n1:03:44 PM\n\nComments\n\nThe bar billiards record was done when I was at HCS viz. 1969 - 76.

I was asked to bowl at you in the nets circa 1946. You were a year ahead of me and were being groomed for batting stardom. Sammy Watson said to me \"We'd like to see Farley's drives Roy - so pitch it up a bit!\" I promptly let fly but it was all pace and short. You went forward of course as obviously you had been told to drive, and were clean bowled.\n\nThis happened for the next few balls and you must have been fed up with picking up the stumps and re-seating the bails. Sorry about that Rob - the truth is I really didn't know then what \"pitch it up\" meant. However, next thing I was bowling for the Second X1!.\n\nOn the other hand, I probably set your batting career back a year or two. Come to think of it, England could have used you a few weeks ago in the first test here in Brisbane. The fact that in spite of the ongoing disasters, they have seen fit not to make use of my talents is a constant source of disappointment to me.

Sure he was frightening to young boys - but that was mainly by the power of his voice and his demeanour. I did Latin to O Level and never had a problem. I do remember him being rather embarrassed at one of my coleagues lack of understanding when doing a translation of a particular passage. This referred in typical oblique Latin way to a woman being pregnant - and he was rather red at explaining this. He was also our year head later in the school and he didn't bat much of an eyelid when I wore brown trousers and a purple shirt to school one day - it was accompanied by the regulation tie and blazer. In the sixth form the French group arranged to boycott one of Hughie Skillen's classes in protest as his anticiapted control of teh following year's classes - we though he was a poor teacher. I admit I turned up - as the only one - but Bernie came in to our next lesson with Mrs Rutter and told us off - but did I detect a note of sympathy then.\n\nName:\n\nJeff Maynard\n\nEmail:\n\njeffrey@jeffreymaynard.com\n\nDate:\n\n11/30/2002\n\nTime:\n\n7:54:36 PM\n\nComments\n\nTo Chris Ricwood - please e-mail me with your re-mail address!

Given an unobservant or distracted teacher, The back pair could be used for sneaking in and out during a lesson for a quick puff near the bike sheds. The desk nearest these doors was left unoccupied as much as possible to facilitate this. Alternatively, having been already registered in the class, one could cause confusion and hilarity by exiting rear doors and re- entering main door apologising for lateness.

Regarding Mike Butler, he told me subsequently that it was picric acid and he was heating it in the sandtray simply \"because I wanted to see what would happen.\" The rest is as recounted, including the tripod bit. He was involved in a fairly catastrophic motor cycle accident some years after leaving school. No crash hats in those days, and I think he sustained brain damage. Sorry, but I can't add to that. I have often wondered whether he survived and what happened to him. He actually had a brilliant mind.\n\nAs for Spud Heafield (both sic), I never heard the Fleafield story - probably apocryphal under pressure. He was a very good English teacher and I owe at least as much gratitude to him as to Beaky Fooks.\n\nThe potassium/sodium/phosphorus story is interesting. When did it happen? I had my own little adventure with sodium: someone had cocked up the field day arrangements for the CCF Naval Section and our field day was to be rowing on Ruislip Lido, no less. I thought to liven the day with some sodium, legitimately purchased and safely (well, fairly safely) kept in a screw-topped jar full of paraffin. While waiting in the quadrangle for our trip to start I lobbed a minute pellet into a puddle. Unfortunately, it went bang just as Bert Morshead walked round the corner. When he stopped gibbering he asked who had done it and I owned up cheerfully. I was dispatched to the adjutant (Reg Allen), passed to the CO (the prat Bigham), sent to the Deputy Head (Brister) and he sent me to Square. I was then suspended from school (and subsequently reinstated when Square found I'd done rather well in 'O' Level Latin). It was much later that I found out that all the overreaction was substantially because it had been suspected that, despite my open account of how I came by it, I'd nicked the sodium from the chemy lab.

I'd suspect these days he would have received formal recognition. However, Square treated is an embarrassing incident to be glossed over.

Marshall.\n\nHe concocted some kind of mixture for making fireworks, which he has in his pocket in a plastic flask.\n\nDuring one of \"Eggy\" eager's classes (2nd form c. 1954) he bumped his leg against the metal legs of desk and it went off, setting light to his clothing.\n\nQuick thinking by Jeff Begley probably saved his life. Jeff smothered flames with his blazer. Even so Marshall spent the best part of a year as I recall in hospital.\n\nWas Begley given even the slightest recognition for his actions by Square ?

One lunch hour he showed me a test-tube full of a pale-blue liquid that he'd made which he said was nitro-glycerine.During that afternoon's Organic Chemistry lab class there was a terrific CRACK from the side bench.When we picked ourselves up from the floor Mike explained he had been heating the stuff in a beaker on a sandtray which was on a tripod-to reduce its volume.Of the beaker and sand there was no sign and only a crumpled ball of metal was left of the sandtray,the tripod being driven half an inch into the benchtop before disintegrating.Many years later I paid a return visit to the school and the holes were still there. Poor Mike,he was 'expelled'although he was allowed to write A-levels a few weeks later.I often wonder if he made as big an impact in his chosen career as he did in school.\n\nName:\n\nAlan Thompson\n\nEmail:\n\npushticat@shaw.ca\n\nDate:\n\n11/25/2002\n\nTime:\n\n1:21:43 PM\n\nComments\n\nRev.'Dicky'Dyer was my form-master in the 2nd form.Does anyone remember his famous bicycle rides?Each boy in turn was asked to accompany him on a Saturday bike ride ostensiby to 'get to know'him better.Those who partipated seemed less than anxious to talk about their experiences afterwards so I put him off as long as possible but eventually succumbed.I got asked a lot of embarrassing personal questions about my lifestyle-such as it was-whilst eating our picnic lunch but that's all.Hardly surprising but at the end of the year he was ordained as an Anglican priest and vanished from school.\n\nName:\n\nColin Dickins\n\nEmail:\n\ncolin.dickins@blueyonder.co.uk\n\nDate:\n\n11/25/2002\n\nTime:\n\n9:58:11 AM\n\nComments\n\nAll these names! It was \"Billy\" Duke and \"Joe\" Brister. I think \"Sorbeau\" is enchanting, but in my day we wrote it \"Sorbo\" because he was shaped, and seemed bouncy, like a sorbo rubber ball. Or did we just no know the correct spelling? Eggy Webb was certainly eccentric and entertaining - but \"decent\"? His eccentricities included the study of small boys' paraphernalia and it was generally assumed that his sudden departure to the IoM was related to this. (I think this falls short of libel, Jeff. He must be long gone, anyway.)\n\nAnd, yes, Connolly was there, minus part of his left leg lost in the war. He was one of several who bore pain with fortitude, although it sometimes led to irrascibility. He was the sort of chief catholic for RC's. Never had a nickname to my knowledge.

We sent our two boys to King Williams in 1975. It was a sort of HCS by the sea. They did well there and enjoyed it as much as I imagine boarding school can be enjoyed. I'll ask them to check up on Eggy. He was not there in 1975. The Isle of Man is a good place to teach because of the advantageous income tax regulations. I remember Eggy best for his yoga performance. He stood on his head with legs crossed in the classic lotus position and stripped to the waist so he could show us how he could wiggle his stomach muscles.

Some were clearly based on physical attributes - Beaky Fooks for his prominent, thin nose, Swanny Amos for his long neck, Spadger Heyes was a cruel one as the poor fellow was obliged to walk with the aid of two sticks,there was also Creeper Davis who at some time before mine had been obliged to wear plimsoles to alleviate a foot condition. Another overlooked one is Sorbeau Hartland for his bouncy walk. With the initials E.G., Eggy is simply too easy. by the way, I recall hearing that E.G.Webb went to teach on the Isle of Man. He was a very decent sort of person and a good teacher but certainly one of the more eccentric ones who as a class, appear to have earned many of the nicknames, e.g. Twink Bradley! Good teachers who ran a 'tight ship', like Duke and Brister, were never given nicknames.\n\nName:\n\nMartin Flack\n\nEmail:\n\nmartinflack@btinternet.com\n\nDate:\n\n11/24/2002\n\nTime:\n\n5:04:44 AM\n\nComments\n\nNice thought Phil, but...

I'm now making regular visits, and have to admit that I'm quite 'hooked' on it. Some of the comments and anecdotes on the message board have brought about a smile or two.\n\nI attended HCS between 1954-1960, and although I don't remember any of the names sending the emails, I do recognise names and faces in some of the photographs, particularly Class 1D of 1954. Dickie Head used to take the mickey out of Mr Eagers (fondly known as 'Eggy'), mimicking his voice and mannerisms unmercifully. There was a noise that we used to make that was associated with 'Eggy', but for the life of me, I cannot recall what it was. I also remember a certain master from my first year who regularly scaled the windowsills to open/shut the sash windows in a classroom on the Sheepcote Road side of the school. Supporting himself with one hand, Tarzan style, he would regale us with stories of days spent under sail at sea. I don't know whether he was trying to impress us with tales of daring-do, or his physical prowess. Was that really 'Twink'?\n\nI have to say that I'm very impressed with the professions of a number of ex-pupils mentioned on this site, barristers, politicians, television producers among them. I suppose that the school, and masters who taught there (some, I believe, are still around), deserve a lot of credit, not least, our thanks. Unfortunately, I myself, never rose to those 'dizzy heights', having spent most of my working life in payroll administration. All very boring, but it did keep the wolf from the door.\n\nI have lived in Swindon now for 33 years (well, somebody has to), and was amazed to discover that dear old Harry Mees lives just a few miles up the road in Cirencester.\n\nWould gladly welcome contact from any other old reprobates of these times, or indeed, anybody else who would take the trouble to email me.\n\nRegards Tony Knight\n\nName:\n\nMichael Schwartz\n\nEmail:\n\nmichael@icompub.com\n\nDate:\n\n11/14/2002\n\nTime:\n\n8:31:12 AM\n\nComments\n\nGaytonians - one more vote of thanks to Jeff.\n\nThe site has completed its second year of hits.

This is primarily because I left the Middlesex area as soon as I left school, settling first in Herts, then Bucks, before a big leap to Cumbria where I have lived for the last 24 years. I greatly enjoyed the reminiscences, and long-lost memories have started to come flooding back. Not much material on my period though (1954-59), nor any direct references to any of my closest 'mates', as far as I can see. Naturally, I would like to contribute some of my own recollections, but first, will need to spend a little time dredging the depths of memory to see what I can come up with! I may also have some photographs tucked away somewhere. Thanks for producing this wonderful trip down Memory Lane.

I certainly blotted my copybook as far as Bingham was concerned. I formed an impression of a miasma of class prejudice rather than anything racial, but as a white chap of working class origin myself, I could have overlooked the latter.

Moving from HCS actually shaped my career, as I had not been very good at German, but my new school started it in Year 4 and this time it clicked! My first Form Teacher was Mr. Marchant (who once slippered me for arriving late) and then for the next three years it was Mr. Kincaid, a very decent man.

(see below, courtesy of The Observer)\n\nThe grounds for the award were undoubtedly much less worthy than those for Sir Paul, but much more entertaining. What did a Professor of Psychology have in mind, when embarking on such a study?\n\n\"Robin McKie, science editor Sunday October 13, 2002 The Observer\n\nThe sight of a pair of testicles on a Greek statue led Chris McManus to his first international award last week. At Harvard University, the psychologist was presented with the 2002 IgNobel prize for medicine after publishing a definitive paper on 'Scrotal asymmetry in man and in ancient sculpture.' McManus had noted a key fact missed by generations of medical experts: that Greek statues' left testicles are always larger than right ones. On real males, the right bollock is always the mightier.\n\n'The right testicle is also higher, and Greeks assumed this meant it had to be lighter and smaller,' the University College London psychologist told The Observer . 'Unfortunately, they were wrong.'\n\nThe end result of this observation, backed by hours of squinting at statues of naked men, was a paper published in Nature which led to McManus's IgNobel prize, one of 10 annual awards given for research 'that cannot, or should not, be repeated.'\n\nThe prizes, presented in the same week as real Nobels and handed out by actual laureates, are intended to prove there is no limit to the depths of human ingenuity, particularly if there is a chance of a research grant at the end of it.\"\n\nName:\n\nRoyston Ellis\n\nEmail:\n\nroyston@sierra.lk\n\nDate:\n\n10/17/2002\n\nTime:\n\n8:31:19 PM\n\nComments\n\nAt my laptop in my attic studio (OK, it overlooks the beach and the Indian Ocean) at my home (for the past 22 years) in Sri Lanka, at 5am (I start work early) I was amazed to find an email from Jeffrey Maynard telling me to check the guest book, and then saw Peter's astonishing recollection of some of my past misdeeds.

I knew this guy only by sight. Two years later I saw his photo in the Daily Mirror. He was wearing sandals, a duffle coat and had grown a straggly beard and was described in mocking and disapproving terms as a \"beat poet\". Forward to 1989. I was working late and was listening to an interview with Paul McCartney. McCartney mentioned our man as an early influence on the Beatles. So thats where the fab four heard HCS words like \"grotty\" I thought.\n\nToday, for no special reason, I did a Google search and found his website, www.roystonellis.com. Apparently he put the \"a\" in \"beatles\" and was the original \"paperback writer\". His biography states \" Royston Ellis was born 10 Feb 1941 in Pinner, England,and educated at state school, until he left, aged 16, determined to be a writer...\". The following two quotes also caught my eye \"to write first and think afterwards is still his bad habit\" (school report 1950) and \"he has robust power of expression\" (John Betjeman, Daily Telegraph, 1959)\n\nWell done Royston mate. How many of us didn't have the bottle let alone the talent. Personally I was a slow starter, staying on to Schol IV.\n\nOn the other hand, I suppose some might argue that even H.C.S dropouts left their mark on popular culture!

When i first joined the club in approx 1984 Phil was the Secretary of the main club committee and he was a great help to me as i was invoved in the Sunday football section that used the club.Phil left the Committee later in the 1980s but was always around the park especially during the Cricket season.I have been Secretary of the Adult Saturday Football Section for some years and many Old Gaytonians have played either football or cricket at the club over the years.Harrow St Marys has been going for even longer than Harrow County having records going back to 1881 and were the 1st football team to play a match at the new Wembley Stadium in 1923 before the West Ham v Bolton Cup Final Remember the White Horse. I last saw Phil in early May when he came into the club for one of the 1st cricket games of the season, he was in good form.

Yes you remembered my sister's name and she is fine, married with children etc. You mentioned your mother and that triggered some memories. I am sure she had grown up in British Honduras and you always had a number of stories to tell the kids at school such as the classic \"tarantula under the pillow\" tale and other horrors that lurked in the jungles of Central America !

I also remember hating Friday afternoons when we were all subjected to rugby & the subsequent humiliation of \"showers boys\". Some nostalgic memories - waiting for the 140 bus & the \"bundle\",the prospect of sex education with Miss Freeman(if only!),the tuck shop, the video club that amazingly screened the Exorcist & Last Tango in Paris- a true education for 15 year olds, some great mates.

Looking at the old photo of Form 1K in 1971 caused a huge amount of mickey taking from my 13 year old son , in NZ the kids wear shorts and a very casual shirt right through to their final high school years so my tie and blazer looked quite bizarre to his eyes. A few memories and a question: mates that I went through Vaughan junior school with as well as to HCGS- Michael Angus(who lived in the Apollo pub!), David Stone,Philip Buck,Keith Greatbatch. Being forced to play rugby!I was a keen soccer man (and still play at 42 years of age) Even in NZ in the early 70s,schools gave you the option of playing rugby or soccer(though playing soccer in NZ back then,certainly cast doubts on your sexuality!) Fancied myself as a bit of a scrapper , but got a shocking hiding by David stone(actually a good mate of mine)at the front of the school one morning(big crowd in attendance),served me right and certainly ended my interest in pugilism. Lastly, can someone clear up something that has bothered me for years. As an avid heavymetal/rock fan throughout the 70s and early 80s , can someone confirm that Deep Purple visited the school during my time there 71 or 72 ? I'm sure they visited to talk to the 6th Form Society (whatever that was) I'd love to know , or did I dream this and have been talking bull...t all these years.\n\nName:\n\nMichael Schwartz\n\nEmail:\n\nmichael@icompub,com\n\nDate:\n\n9/27/2002\n\nTime:\n\n7:39:52 AM\n\nComments\n\nI switched on BBC1 this morning to catch the headlines.

I just remember you particularly because your dad worked with mine for a while at Harrow Council. All those names warmly familiar. I'm still in regular touch with Malcolm Taylor, Mike Castile, Ray Farrow and Paul Dunmore so HCS lives on!\n\nName:\n\nYe Min\n\nEmail:\n\nyeyeye63@btinternet.com\n\nDate:\n\n8/27/2002\n\nTime:\n\n2:49:53 PM\n\nComments\n\nStumbled upon this site today and have been trawling its distant memories. I'm on the IC photo for 1963 - a shock to the system! Cant say that I have fond memories of the place as an educational establishment. I think mine was the only non-white face in the whole school picture. We all know it was an elitist place etc etc. I feel my education was thwarted there by not fitting into the square hole. Where are the antischool memories? Those who pushed against the system? Do you remember ARS/cOWAN ranting about the theft of cutlery from the dining room and the sound of a fork being dropped at the back of the hall! All those detentions. Cowan asked me how many I had to do and I'd lost count by then. And being shocked by my pal lighting a joint on his way to dentention in 1965. Amazing that Cowan learned all our names in a few days and then our positions on the photo. Scarey man.

Back in the late Sixties I was taking piano lessons just four doors away from where I am sitting typing this in Harrow Weald; unbeknown to me at the time, a couple of years earlier a young Gordon Waller was doing exactly the same thing on exactly the same piano; he went on to record hits as part of the duo Peter and Gordon.....I needless to say didn't!! A few years earlier even than this, Gordon used to ride his bicycle near to where my Dad worked in Headstone Lane; quite often he would ask my Dad if he would pump his tyres up for him; that's my Dad's claim to fame! I wonder what happened to Gordon? I recall Peter Asher became a record producer for the likes of Linda Rondstat amongst many others.\n\nFinally I too remember well the concerts that used to take place at both the Granada and Dominion Cinemas and seeing the likes of Marianne Faithfull, The Hollies, Dave Clark Five, Dave Berry, etc. Wonderful days !!!\n\nBye for now Graham Gall (HCS 1965-1972)\n\nName:\n\ngogilan\n\nEmail:\n\nfunkylachunga@hotmail.com\n\nDate:\n\n8/24/2002\n\nTime:\n\n4:41:53 PM\n\nComments\n\nIt was a most memorable experience to attend Gayton High school from september 1991 until july 1995. It certainly shaped my character, and i learnt a lot about life. It is without a doubt the fondest memories i have of school life. Experiences from winning awards for everything academic and sporting to being ordered to \"Go and wait under the Clock!!\". Also the teachers of that time will always be appreciated for all their help!!
