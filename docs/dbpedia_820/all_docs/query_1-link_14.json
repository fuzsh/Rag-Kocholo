        "text": "John Frank Celin, 83, of Scottsville, Virginia, passed away peacefully at his home on May 21, 2024.\n\nJohn, popularly known by friends and family as “The Boss”, “Doctor Celin”, “Professor\", “Comandante” and “Uncle John” was born on October 24, 1940, in Vicenza, Italy to wonderful parents, Giuseppe and Giuseppina Celin.\n\nJohn became a doctor in Milano, Italy and worked for many years in the beautiful town of Campione d’Italia nestled on the shores of Lake Lugano. He was so well known, he almost decided to become the mayor.\n\nHe shared his passion for traveling and learning new things with his niece, and his love of fast cars with his nephew. He enjoyed cruising in his convertibles with the wind in his hair, like he did not have a care in the world. He loved classical music and frequently went to concerts where he was friends with the conductor. Most importantly, he loved his food and wine, and if he didn’t, he’d make sure to let the chef know.\n\nAfter several years, he decided to become a plastic surgeon, and this is when his story in America began.\n\nJohn was a Clinical Teaching Fellow at the Department of Surgery, Harvard Medical School. Following training and Board Certification in General and Vascular Surgery, Professor Celin trained in Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at the Harvard Medical School, New York University, and the University of Kentucky.\n\nJohn finished his career as a Clinical Associate Professor at the Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Virginia, School of Medicine Consultant Faculty.\n\nHe continued his career in London and met some remarkable people along the way.\n\nBesides his work as a surgeon in the United Kingdom and United States, John was an avid world traveler, who traveled to the farthest corners of the planet in his dedication to delivering humanitarian aid, and to do his small part in the advancement of modern medicine in underdeveloped countries.\n\nFrom his infamous medical studio next to Harrods in London to the outskirts of New Delhi, the Caribbean Islands, and trekking through the Himalayas in Nepal, he brought his skills and knowledge to help those in need.\n\nJohn was the glue that reunited a family that had been lost through the generations and spread across three continents. He is preceded in death by his parents, Giuseppe and Giuseppina Celin. He leaves behind his immediate family, brother Roberto Celin, (Renata), niece Rosmarie Elena Celin Stone (Mark Stone), nephew Joseph Celin (Nadia Kurtz).\n\nAnd his extended family Amanda & Chiara Borwick (Henry); Paolo, Alberto, Francesca, Alessandra, Mirella Celin (Mario); Giorgia Zambello; Retto Baccaglini (Albertina); Anna Baccaglini and children Lorenzo & Corinna, Adriano Baccaglini (Michela), and son Leonardo, Giorgio Scaramuccia (Maura); Lorella Zersi; Roman Zersi (Noëmi) and children Èmile & Maël); Roberta Zersi, Cesare Zersi (Linda); Rosanna, Elsa, Aldana (Mateo & Sofia), and Luciana Zopatti; Gian Andrea Sanna and children Sara (Gabriele) & Valentina (Gemma & Giacomo), Caterina Sanna, and daughter Carlotta; Rosa Sanna, and children Simone & Matteo; Euriele Ragazzi, and sons Elia & Leonardo; Luca Ragazzi (Lucia) and son Guido; the Scaramuccia family of Vitorchiano, Italy; the Folatti family of Chiesa in Valmalenco, Italy; the Celin family of Ivrea, Italy; and the Zersi Family of Santiago, Chile.\n\nAnd his dear friends of which he had many.\n\nThose of you who know this family are aware there are many relatives spread across each and every corner of the globe, so please forgive us if we’ve forgotten your name.\n\nJohn was described dearly as “a polymath, a raconteur, an aesthete, an internationalist, a stylist, an explorer, and a guardian angel. Also, a… bit cranky at times. The world was a better place just knowing that he was in it- wherever he was on his travels. Now there is only void”. ~ Paul Thwaites\n\nA Funeral service will take place at St George Catholic Church in Scottsville, Virginia on May 24th, 2024, at 1:00pm.\n\nSheridan Funeral Home will handle his arrangements.\n\nJohn’s final resting place will be in the beautiful mountains of Northern Italy, where his journey began."
