I empathise with Opal and am extremely grateful to them for providing me with this scholarship.\n\n“The financial support that this scholarship provides will allow me to focus more on my studies. As a result, I will become more knowledgeable in the field, allowing me to provide more effective care to my patients. The Opal HealthCare scholarship will also help support my aspirations of becoming a mental health nurse.”"
