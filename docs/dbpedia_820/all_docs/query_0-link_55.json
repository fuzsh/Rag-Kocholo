This will mean more burning of marine fuels and black carbon emissions, accelerating further melting. More open water means further absorption of the sun’s warmth and heating of the Arctic Ocean — a vicious cycle. </p><p>As a former navigator I have sailed on ships in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. In 1979 I was second officer on the first ship to east Greenland that season and we arrived at Angmagssalik around July 1 after spending a day navigating very heavy multi-year ice. Later that year, I was in the Thule (Qaanaaq) district in northwest Greenland, which opened up for ship traffic only in early August.</p><p>Much later, around 1998, I got involved in the International Maritime Organization’s work on drafting the Polar Code. The first draft was brought to the IMO by Canada, but it needed quite some work in order to appear as an IMO document. The first version was adopted in 2002 as a set of voluntary guidelines, whereas the present version, which entered into force on January 1 this year, is a mandatory IMO Code under both the Solas and the Marpol Conventions.</p><p>Looking again at this year’s ice chart, it appears that the areas I visited back in 1979 will be open to ship traffic much earlier and the navigable window will be much longer.</p><p>Is that good? Well, from a purely navigational view, an ice-free Arctic for half of the year would be convenient. Many tonne-miles would be saved and thereby less fuel burned on a global basis, which arguably could have a mitigating effect of shipping on climate change and even delay the 2°C temperature increase scenario by several weeks. But overall, is this significantly beneficial compared with the negative side-effects of global warming, and the potential impacts of burning heavy fuel oil in the Arctic?</p><p><span><a onclick=",

Yikes!  Several sensitive ecosystems – such as Venice and its surrounding lagoon in Italy – have taken steps to limit cruise ships’ access (quantity, size, etc.) due to the impacts of climate change and damage caused by these ships. Is it time to limit cruise ships access to the Antarctic and Arctic regions? I have heard that tourism in the polar regions is becoming increasingly popular. Though surely the presence of large ships in these regions is not good for climate change and surely has severe impacts on the sensitive ecosystems. Is it time to limit access just for researchers, scientists, etc.? </p><p><a href=",
