        "text": "Aaron believes in ideas, working hard being nice and brushing his teeth after lunch.\n\nOriginally from Mexico City, with more than 20 years of advertising experience across a wide range of US and global brands. Over the past 5 years, he has delivered unparalleled work in pharmaceutical marketing in therapeutic categories such as respiratory, dermatology, and cardiology. He joined McCann Health NY in 2021 to work with a portfolio of cardiovascular accounts.\n\nAaron’s work has been recognized for creative excellence by the London International Awards, Clio, The Creative Floor, MM&M Awards, DTC Awards, Lüerzers Archive magazine, Shots magazine, and was published on McGraw Hill’s Marketing Essentials textbooks.\n\nAaron’s personal artwork has been exhibited in multiple galleries around the world, including Miami Art Basel, Venice, and NY.\n\nSarah is Creative Director at McCANN Health Italy. After more than 10 years in agencies such as Publicis, TBWA, DDB and FCB, she moved into healthcare advertising, where she finally found the chance to give words and ideas a meaningful purpose. Healthcare communication changed her life, and she believes that it can impact a lot in the lives of other people too. She has a special vocation to find that point of intersection where health meets our culture, be it cinema, music, design, books and any other type of passion. She falls in love with ideas and storytelling that push health closer to us, going beyond boundaries, and make people understand that health, in the end, is simply about life. Sarah strongly believes in the great power of freedom and inclusion. In addition to numerous national awards at the Italian Art Directors Club (ADCI), she was the President of Jury in Healthcare at ADCI Awards 2021 and won also international recognition at the Creative Floor Healthcare Awards, the One Show and Eurobest.\n\nYvonne has been working in the creative field since 1999. With a background in graphic design she bridged the gap between consumer and healthcare, before leaning into to her passion for the life-changing creative opportunities available in healthcare communications.\n\nOncology, HIV, ophthalmology, neurology, and on, and on, Yvonne has worked across the full range of clients, categories and channels over the course of her career. Her experience has culminated with 7 years at IPG Health, where she believes that now more than ever, our industry has a real chance to make a positive change in people’s lives.\n\nStuart is Digital/UX Director at Frontera London, part of the Bloc Network, and leads on the design and execution of digital experiences for the agency’s global pharmaceutical clients.\n\nWith over 15 years agency experience, Stuart has an extensive background in digital development and solution design, having begun his career as a web developer working with brands such as Sony, Mirror Group and Premier League football clubs.\n\nAt Frontera/The Bloc, Stuart has consulted across a range of brands and therapy areas, from oncology to aesthetics, delivering digital solutions that respond to the needs of audience and drive effective, long-lasting behaviour change.\n\nWhen he isn’t deep in wireframes or measurement KPIs, he can often be found on Pinterest compiling mood boards for his new house.\n\nChristian Bauman (Chief Creative Officer, The Bloc) is the only person we know with work represented in both the Smithsonian Institution and the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame. ​\n\nAs a creative director, Christian has always worked in healthcare and never wanted to be anywhere else, guiding major campaign for clients including Pfizer, Sanofi, Novartis, Alcon, and many others. He has served on executive juries of all the major health shows, including Cannes Health, Clios Health, and MM&M. ​\n\nOutside of work he is the author of three critically acclaimed novels (In Hoboken, Voodoo Lounge, and The Ice Beneath You) and a former regular commentator for NPR’s All Things Considered. Bauman has been featured on Fresh Air with Terry Gross, The New York Times, CNN, Elle, and Details, among others. ​\n\nChristian served in the US Army Waterborne from 1991-1995, including tours in the war zones of Somalia and Haiti.\n\nSarah is a Sr. Creative Director at Vice / Virtue, with 18+ years experience in creating impactful campaigns for brands in the MENA region. Having worked at some of the top agencies in Dubai, like Impact BBDO, Mullen Lowe, and Wunderman Thompson, she has enjoyed her fair share of success in working on a diverse portfolio of Global and regional brands like Emirates, Mars, KFC, Unilever, P&G, Johnson’s, Pepsi Co, Amazon, Google and Essity. Sarah has a particular interest in creating work that impacts culture and changes the narrative for women.
