        "text": "Current Work\n\nI have made an outstanding contribution to research and scholarship through 7 books and 120 articles, multiple top 10 downloads in SSRN, published in 4* journals. I have contributed actively to REF2008, REF2014 and REF2021 with journal papers and impact case studies (ICS). In REF2021 we infer that my Impact Case Study was rated 4* 'world leading' by the review panel.\n\nThe ESRC selected my research from 350 entrants as runner-up in the Celebrating Impact Prize Finals in 2021 at the Royal Society. I won the University of Nottingham Best Policy Initiative Prize 2019. The underpinning research has appeared in 4* journals and the prestigious NBER working paper series. Two NBER papers were selected by Prof Jim Poterba (Harvard) to feature in The NBER Digest and written up in Sunday Times and the Financial Times. I have fostered research collaborations with Chicago Booth, Imperial, Kings, LSE, MIT, Northwestern, Stanford; Bank of England, Bank for International Settlements, Banque de France. Deutsche Bundesbank, European Central Bank, Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund..\n\nI am currently engaged in three major research projects using data we gather from three unique surveys:\n\nDecision Maker Panel. Jointly with the Bank of England and Nick Bloom of Stanford University we aim to gather survey data on economic uncertainty, expectations and Brexit. I head up a 50 strong team of researchers supported by the ESRC. and other contributing institutions supported by c£3.1m grants and in-kind contributions. The survey has been extensively referenced in the minutes of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, Monetary Policy Report, Quarterly Bulletin, and reports to the Treasury Select Committee in Parliament. The results have been used extensively by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee including in the official assessment of the Withdrawal Agreement presented to Parliament (Nov 2018).The findings to date have been reported in The Financial Times, The Sunday Times, The Times, The Independent, The Guardian, the Harvard Business Review and contributed to the Jackson Hole Symposium 2020.\n\nManagement and Expectations Survey. Our novel approach to surveys was embedded in a Management and Expectations Survey in 2017 in collaboration with John van Reenen and Nick Bloom and the Office for National Statistics. The results of the MES survey were used to inform a 2018 call for evidence by BEIS and HM Treasury relating to the British Productivity Review. Data on UK productivity have been shared with the Industrial Strategy Council Chair, Andrew Haldane. The ESRC has awarded £1,102,171 in 2019 to conduct a second wave and enable analysis of the results. Evidence suggests that firms that make greater use of management practices are more productive than firms that do not. More details can be found in a summary report here. In June 2022 HM Treasury has approved £250,000 for funding MES 2023.\n\nWorking From Home (WFH) Survey. Launched in December 2020. We reveal attitudes towards working from home have changed substantially since the start of the pandemic. Our survey of 2,500 working adults per month in the UK since December 2020 show a huge increase in the UK labour force working from home during Covid-19 and the majority would like to continue to work from home 2-3 days per week post-COVID.
