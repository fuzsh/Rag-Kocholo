        "text": "I have just completed my fourth week in self-isolation. Other than a visit to a local supermarket three weeks ago the only outside space I have seen is my garden. I am not alone, far from it. Millions of people around the world are getting by on little more than an hour a day spent outside of the home\n\nThis blog is dedicated to those people who keep on working through this crisis. Doctors, Nurses, Carers, shop workers, delivery drivers, postmen, refuse collectors…………………all heroes. All of these people are making a real difference, providing lifelines to millions of others. Yet many of the people I am celebrating are amongst the lowest paid in society. Think of all the Chief Executives sitting at home helplessly watching profits skydiving, share prices sliding and the only thing they have done to make a difference is cut costs through making people unemployed.\n\nWhen this shit storm is over I hope that people realise we need to re-balance the world economy and start to reward people in proportion to their contribution to making society work. Never take anyone for granted and never look down your nose at another person because you think you are more important………….think about it…………you’re not!!!\n\nDuring a visit to the NASA space centre in 1962, President John F. Kennedy noticed a janitor carrying a broom. He interrupted his tour, walked over to the man and said, “Hi, I’m Jack Kennedy. What are you doing?”\n\n“Well, Mr. President,” the janitor responded, “I’m helping put a man on the moon.”\n\nPerhaps you have heard the story of Christopher Wren, a seventeenth-century English architect who walked one day unrecognized among the men who were at work upon the building of St. Paul’s cathedral in London, which he had designed.\n\n“What are you doing?” he inquired of one of the workmen. The man replied, “I am cutting a piece of stone.” As Wren went on he put the same question to another man, and the man replied, “I am helping Sir Christopher Wren build a beautiful cathedral.”\n\nImagine how much better our world would be if those at the top of the pyramid realised that without those at bottom nothing happens!\n\nThus endeth my Easter sermon.\n\nJade told me a great story this week;\n\n‘I met an old guy when I was on a bike ride and we had a good long chat. Turns out he was a teacher in Sheffield and he’d taught Jarvis Cocker and his sister. The guy proudly told me that he played a part in the name of Jarvis’ band Pulp.\n\nMy new friend was Jarvis’ economics teacher and one day he gave the class a copy of the Financial Times from many years ago and asked them all to write down what they’d invest in from commodity lists. They would then read the present days financial times to see who made the best choice. Apparently Jarvis was like ey sir what’s this Arabicus coffee pulp thing. The teacher explained it and Jarvis was like okay I’m gonna put my money on that… Turned out that was the best from the list and he was like, Sir I’m gonna name my band after that. Arabicus pulp was too much of a mouthful so he shortened it to Pulp.’\n\nI love the story and it got me thinking about the genesis of other band names. As many people seem to be taking part in online quizzes as a way of coping with social isolation I thought I’d set some questions. Good luck, answers are at the bottom of this blog.\n\nAn acronym formed from the first letters of each group member’s first name.\n\nNamed after Milo O’Shea’s character in Sci Fi classic Barbarella\n\nIrish band whose name came from a robot character in The Dandy comic.\n\nAmerican band named after a steam-powered dildo in William Burrough’s novel The Naked Lunch.\n\nEnglish Heavy Metal band named after a 1933 Boris Karloff film.\n\nAmerican band who took their name from the sidekick of Bart Simpson’s favourite superhero, Radioactive Man.\n\nThis band was inspired by early-rocker Buddy Holly, whose backing group was called the Crickets.\n\nBand named after the South African football club that was the first team that ex-Leeds United captain Lucas Radebe played for.\n\nBand named after the founder members family home where they gathered to rehearse.\n\nLiverpool band named after a character in Harper Lee’s classic ‘To kill a Mockingbird’\n\nI hope that some of you are using your unexpected spare time to catch up on some reading. I said in my last blog that I was reading Sandi Toskvig’s autobiography – Between the Stops: The View of My Life from the Top of the Number 12 Bus. I really enjoyed this book so have compiled a list of some of my favourite Biographies auto or otherwise.\n\nStairway to Heaven – Richard Cole\n\nSteven Davis’ Hammer of the gods is the best known biography of Led Zeppelin This warts and all exposé of life on the road with Led Zeppelin became the benchmark rock biography. Davis’ tales of excess most notably the infamous Mudshark incident helped to build the Zeppelin legend.\n\nI would recommend Stairway to Heaven above Davis’ tome. Richard Cole was Led Zeppelin’s tour manager and also the personal assistant of the bands mentor and manager Peter Grant. Cole was there for every year, every album and every tour and was therefore a first-hand witness to some of the legends that surround Led Zeppelin. Not for the faint hearted, it is however a definitive witness statement of someone who experienced the life with most the significant rock band on god’s great earth.\n\nAnyone fancy a night at the Edgewater Inn Seattle??\n\nA Magick life – Martyn Booth\n\nDescribed by the popular press as “the wickedest man in the world” Aleister Crowley was an English writer, mystic, and ceremonial magician. Playing up to his reputation Crowley described himself as the Great beast 666 which fuelled the fires of scandal in the press which labelled him a Satanist.\n\nCrowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a recreational drug experimenter, bisexual and an individualist social critic. He was also though a poet, painter, novelist, and mountaineer. He dedicated his life to seeking arcane knowledge. Crowley became a Yoga adept may years before it became fashionable in western society.\n\nCrowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism. Led Zeppelin founder Jimmy Page is one of his most famous devotees. Page bought Boleskine house by Loch Ness which was formally owned by Crowley and reputedly where he tried to perform a series of rituals known as the Sacred Magic of Abra-melin the Mage, the purpose which was to summon a guardian angel.\n\nIf you want to go beyond the more sensationalist crap pedalled by the popular press and understand a little more about who Crowley really was then this book is a good place to start.\n\nI’m with the band – Pamela Des Barres\n\nPamela Des Barres was arguably the first groupie. This book is a wonderfully evocative memoir of Los Angeles in the sixties and seventies and describes the social changes brought upon the western world through the influence of rock music.\n\nBeginning with Pamela Des Barres’ early obsession with Elvis, her own Beatlemania madness, and her fierce determination to meet the musicians who rocked her world, I’m With The Band describes how she infiltrated the nascent LA music scene in the late sixties. From being a nanny to Frank Zappa’s kids to relationships with Jim Morrison, Jimmy Page, Mick Jagger and even Pink Fairies’ bassist Duncan Sanderson to name but a few.\n\nThis book is a fantastic eyewitness account of the rise of rock music through to its dominance of popular culture. Des Barres has written other books but they descended in to little more than kiss and tell pap.\n\nThe Moon is a balloon – David Niven\n\nDavid Niven lived through the golden age of Hollywood and was a favourite of Samuel Goldwyn. Niven was born into the English upper class. He attended Heatherdown Preparatory School and Stowe School before gaining a place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After Sandhurst, he joined the British Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry.\n\nHaving developed an interest in acting, he left the army and travelled to Hollywood to pursue a career in the film industry.\n\nThe day after Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Niven returned home and rejoined the British Army. He was alone among British stars in Hollywood in doing so; the British Embassy advised most actors to stay put in LA.\n\nNiven was recommissioned as a lieutenant into the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort’s Own) on 25 February 1940 and was assigned to a motor training battalion. He wanted something more exciting, however, and transferred into the Commandos.\n\nAfter the war Niven returned to Los Angeles and enjoyed a very successful acting career. This wonderful book will make you laugh out loud as he describes his life in Hollywood. His description of he and Errol Flynn sharing a house which they called ‘cirrhosis by the sea’ is a scream. This book is a must read for film devotees but will be enjoyed by anyone who likes to laugh.\n\nYou’ll never make love in this town again\n\nIn the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal it was worth revisiting this book.\n\nHeidi Lynne Fleiss was an American madam who ran an upscale prostitution ring based in Los Angeles, California. She was convicted in 1996 and following her court case four of her girls wrote this expose of the seediness of the so called high class vice trade.\n\nYou will recognise most, if not all of the ‘clients’. I can’t watch Paul McCartney’s moving rendition of Something at the George Harrison memorial concert without thinking about this book. I lost respect for Jack Nicholson and will never watch another Sylvester Stallone film. Remember that this book is nearly twenty five years old but makes the Weinstein trial chilling when you realise just how misogynistic and cruel Los Angeles has always been.\n\nStoned – Andrew Loog Oldham\n\n‘People say I made the Stones. I didn’t. They were there already’. They only wanted exploiting. They were all bad boys when I found them. I just brought out the worst in them.’\n\nAndrew Loog Oldham was nineteen years old when he discovered and became the manager and producer of an unknown band called The Rolling Stones. This autobiography is a fascinating picture of London in the swinging sixties. Oldham is a fascinating mix of chancer and genius. He became the template for many subsequent pop music Svengali’s and deserves greater recognition than he receives. It was Oldham who locked Jagger and Richards in a room and told them not to come out before they had written a song. The rest as they say is history, but what a history!\n\nMr Nice – Howard Marks\n\nWhat an extraordinary fellow Howard Marks was. His autobiography takes him from his South Wales childhood and Oxford University education through his life dealing marijuana and the enormous mythology that accrued around what the tabloids called “the English Toff Drugs King of the World”. This book is called Mr Nice after one of the many aliases Marks’s life as a merchant of pot obliged him to assume.\n\nThis book is a hilarious but cautionary tale of a life well lived. You can’t help but warm to Howard Marks. As you read the book you will wish you had got the chance to drink a pint or share a spliff with Mr. Nice. On a serious note, Marks argues the case for the legalisation of Marijuana and it is difficult to argue with him.\n\nMy Niece Steph met Howard and confirmed what my instincts told me…….he was truly Mr. Nice.\n\nRhinos, Winos & Lunatics – Deke Leonard\n\nFrom the Publisher:\n\nMan are a band from Wales with more history behind them than the Greeks. Rhinos, Winos & Lunatics is an hilarious account of life in the weirdest rock’n’roll band in the universe. Ablaze with razor-sharp wit, it is a stirring saga of courage, endurance and almost breathtaking stupidity.\n\nI like the idea of Man more than I like the Manband’s music. The Ride and the view from the Welsh connection is one of my favourite songs of all time but few other Man tunes (with the notable exception of Bananas) scratch my itch.\n\nDeke Leonard, however, is a fantastic raconteur. How he manages to remember the many stories he tells is truly amazing given his prodigious consumption of narcotics!\n\nDeke wrote four more books, all superb. He passed away in in 2017. The world lost a true original, someone who deserved a bigger audience. Whether you like music or not you will love this book. Do yourself a favour and buy or blag a copy. You won’t be disappointed.\n\np.s. If you play guitar, you must buy the Twang Dynasty. This book is Deke celebrating his own guitar heroes. The chapter on my hero Larry Wallis is jaw droppingly hilarious\n\nNotes from a small island – Bill Bryson\n\nFrom the publisher:\n\nBill Bryson is an unabashed Anglophile who, through a mistake of history, happened to be born and bred in Iowa. Righting that error, he spent 20 years in England before deciding to repatriate: “I had recently read that 3.7 million Americans according to a Gallup poll, believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another, so it was clear that my people needed me.” That comic tone enlivens this account of Bryson’s farewell walking tour of the countryside of “the green and kindly island that had for two decades been my home.”\n\nMy friend Phil doesn’t like Bill Bryson. He thinks he should spend more time in pubs connecting with people in the universal environment. I know where Phil is coming from but I find Bill Bryson hilarious. I love all of his travel books but this one resonates because it is about my home country. I love America so it is particularly good to read a book about an Americans love for my home.\n\nIf you read this book I can guarantee that (unless your name is Phil and you are a West Ham fan) you will seek out more of Bill Bryson’s work.\n\nThe Smell of Football – Mick Rathbone\n\nI have to finish with a sports book. After all, we all miss sport. Whatever is your sporting gig it fills a huge part of our lives. This book is not about a sporting god but is the story of a physio with Everton football club.\n\nFrom the publisher:\n\nWhen Mick Rathbone signed for Birmingham City as a 16 year-old apprentice he was living every schoolboy’s dream. But when he discovered he was so nervous he was unable to speak, let alone pass the ball, in the presence of his boyhood hero and City star Trevor Francis, he realised that a career in football might not be everything he had imagined.\n\nThe Smell of Football is the brutally honest and utterly compelling story of how ‘Baz’ conquered his personal demons to build a life in the game – from the terrified teenager who purposely tried to get injured in training rather than get picked for the first team, to the experienced pro who became Head of Medicine at Premier League Everton FC in charge of the treatment of the likes of Wayne Rooney, Louis Saha and Tim Cahill.\n\nBrilliantly written and packed with hilarious tales featuring a football ‘who’s who’ cast of characters – from Sir Alf Ramsey and ‘Big Sam’ Allardyce to David Moyes, Duncan Ferguson and Rooney himself – The Smell of Football is an engrossing and moving memoir that covers every aspect of the professional game and gives an unprecedented insight into what life is really like at football’s coalface.\n\nThis is an inspirational book that shows how any of us can make a difference once we have found our niche.\n\nThank you for reading this blog. I genuinely hope that you will read at least one of these books. If you do, let me know what you think.\n\nFinally, please recognise the contribution made by those comrades who are selflessly working through these horrific times. Hopefully this will lead to a new world order of collaboration and tolerance…………………………………….I think I’ve been reading too much Mr. Nice!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nQuiz answers\n\n1) Abba\n\n2) Duran Duran\n\n3) Thin Lizzy\n\n4) Steely Dan\n\n5) Black Sabbath\n\n6) Fall out boy\n\n7) The Beatles\n\n8) Kaiser Chiefs\n\n9) Fairport Convention\n\n10) Boo Radleys\n\nWorking from home is a tough gig. On the positive side, I am kept very busy so the day passes quickly. I realise what a great bunch of people I am working with, the team spirit is fantastic. I speak with Craig who I share an office with most days which always boosts my morale as we end each call discussing how many beers we’re going to drink together if we get through this shit. On the downside, Skype calls are very frustrating; after all, you can’t make eye contact with a laptop screen!\n\nPhone conference protocols are difficult to adhere to. It’s hard not to talk over somebody when you can’t see what is going on. It proves Professor Mehrabian right;\n\nProfessor Mehrabian came up with the now famous—and famously misused—rule that communication is only 7 percent verbal and 93 percent non-verbal. The non-verbal component was made up of body language (55 percent) and tone of voice (38 percent).\n\nLast week I was exchanging emails with my friend Mark. His wife Jeanne told him to ask me what my favourite album sleeves are. Hey, serendipity intervenes again. I have been meaning to sort my vinyl albums alphabetically for months, mainly driven by my inability to find my copy of Solid by the Groundhogs. Jeanne’s question proved the motivational trigger. I decided that I would only choose my favourite album covers from those I own on vinyl.\n\nI will provide a little commentary on what I like about the sleeve and also a few words about the album. I must stress that I have picked my favourite album covers, not my favourite albums\n\nSo here we go, my top 10 in no particular order;\n\nI love Modern art and Don Van Vliet is one of my favourite artists. His paintings have a childlike quality but reward those who study them deeply. There is much wisdom concealed within that childlike simplicity and his use of colours is stunning. Don was a fellow member of the MS club.\n\nCaptain Beefheart is Don’s alter ego (named after his uncle, read the story!). This isn’t his best album but it is a good one nonetheless. Seekers should checkout Clear Spot or Ice Cream for Crow for great songs, Trout Mask Replica for weirdness, and Bongo Fury for one of the best collaborations of all time.\n\nps\n\nPat told me if I ever buy one of Don’s paintings (I could never afford an original) and attempt to hang it on open display she will perform an orchidectomy with her bare teeth!!!\n\nWhat can I say about this Hipgnosis classic? There is so much going on here; the everyday gesture of two people shaking hands, particularly those formally dressed. The seeming indifference to the fact that one of the guys is on fire! Finally, the background is incongruous. Is it a movie set? Maybe it’s a deserted factory? Wherever they are, it’s a beautiful day. Wish you were here indeed!\n\nI love Pink Floyd and this album is one of their top three in my opinion:\n\nDark side of the Moon\n\nWish you were here\n\nThe Wall\n\nI honestly can’t pick a favourite as it is only ever the one I happen to be listening to. Of those three great albums it is Wish you were here that boasts the best cover!\n\nPretty whimsical I hear you say.\n\nThis is less about the sleeve and more about what this album did for me. I bought this album from Earthquake records in 1977. I had never heard of the Pink Fairies. A guy called Simmo took me under his wing one day and showed me albums that I should own, needed to own. His number one recommendation was Kings of Oblivion.\n\nForty three years later I sit here in my man cave typing this blog looking at a framed copy of the album cover. I love the perfection of the colours, the expressions of the pigs but most of all I love travelling back through time to the day that I first unfurled my freak flag!!\n\nThe album is awesome as well. If there is a better track than City Kids then I have certainly never heard it.\n\nLarry Wallis and Duncan Sanderson passed away recently.\n\nRest in peace comrades.\n\nI was fascinated by this sleeve from the first time I saw it. I love the black and silver diagonal stripes, the band logo is a design classic but most of all I love the photo of Alex Harvey. Alex looks hard, threatening, uber fucking cool.\n\nWhat a fantastic album as well. Not only is there not a bad track but the album marks the first outing for Harvey’s alter ego Vambo.\n\nTowering over everything else is the title track Next, a song written by legendary Belgian singer Jacques Brel, Harvey makes the song his own just like Sinatra does with New York New York and Elvis does with Are you lonesome tonight.\n\nDon’t die without hearing this album at least once.\n\nNever has an album sleeve described what you are about to hear as much as Swordfish Trombones. You really have to listen to this masterpiece to understand what I mean.\n\nWaits was a great songwriter from the get go. I love Blue Valentine, Heart attack and Vine and Nighthawks at the Diner but this one was the game changer. This album marked not only a musical departure but an artistic one as well. The sleeve reflects the fact that through the album you will meet a cast of vagabonds, ne’er do wells and real people that will warm your heart. These stories are set against an eclectic, fantastic musical background.\n\nTom’s next album was Rain Dogs and he raised the bar again.\n\nPlease check this album out and whether you like it or not, see how it resonates with the sleeve art.\n\nI used to flick past this album every week in Earthquake records. I would inevitably retrace my steps and pull it from the rack. I loved the sleeve. The colours are stunning the image of the cowboy waving goodbye to his true love felt strangely reassuring.\n\nThe problem was that I was told that the band were just a second string bunch of old hippies that noodled away aimlessly fuelled by a cocktail of weed and psychedelics.\n\nThen I read Winos, Rhinos and Lunatics by Deke Leonard. This fantastic book recounts Deke’s time as a part of legendary Welsh hippies Man. One of the books highlights is the time that the Manband spent with John Cipollina, guitarist with Quicksilver Messenger Service. Deke is awestruck as he describes Cippo’s talents. So I finally bought the album. I really like it but the sleeve is still the star\n\nThe French would say this sleeve is ‘Les ballons de chien’ The dog’s bollocks!\n\nThe band logo perfectly illustrates the sound of Motorhead. Another Earthquake records purchase of mine. I had read about Motorhead in the music press, knew of Lemmy through his tenure in Hawkwind but nothing prepared me for the holy row that erupted from the speakers.\n\nThe band logo still adorns tee shirts and has seamlessly crossed at least three generations. I would proudly wear this logo if the clothing catered for the more mature old rocker!!!\n\nLemmy and Fast Eddie are sadly no longer with us but the awesome music still is. The title track and the biker anthem Iron Horse stand out on this album but the band would go on to record many more great songs such as Overkill, Ace of Spades and Killed by Death.\n\nAndy Warhol is one of my favourite artists. I have seen his work exhibited in London, New York and Hamburg. I yearn to see more, particularly his photography.\n\nI was not convinced when I first saw this album sleeve. Nor was I sold on the music. Every band when I was a teenager played Waiting for my man (except for my band of course).\n\nAs I started to get into Warhol I realised I needed to buy this album and see if it deserved the fuss.\n\nBrian Eno once said that even though hardly anyone bought Velvet Underground recordings at the time they first appeared, almost everyone who did formed their own bands.\n\nYou only need to hear Patti Smith, Talking Heads or the New York Dolls to see that this is true.\n\nA truly great album. I now love Waiting for my man, Heroin and Nico singing All Tomorrow’s parties.\n\nIf you like the album then you should checkout more great Warhol art. If you don’t like the music, still checkout Warhol!\n\nReaders of my earlier blogs will have read of my fascination with this album sleeve. I still don’t know whether to be filled with a sense of calm or a sense of trepidation. In the last few years we have visited both Glastonbury Tor and Stonehenge and on both occasions I have thought about this album cover.\n\nArgus is a great album. There are no bad tracks. It will forever be known for Blowin’ Free but The King will come and The Warrior best reflect the album cover theme.\n\nMy God there is something deep about this album sleeve. I can remember seeing it on Amazon, reading reviews in the music press but I always felt drawn to the album cover. To this day I cannot describe why I feel so moved.\n\nAs you can imagine I needed to check the album out. It is fantastic!!! The Decemberists got even better on their next album The Hazards of Love.\n\nWe saw the band live in Leeds a couple of years ago and they are brilliant!!! I have since bought many more albums by this wonderful band but The Crane Wife sleeve still fascinates me.\n\nPostscript: I really enjoyed sorting out my 500 records into alphabetical order. It took a little longer than planned but felt so good. So many memories came flooding back. So many long lost treasures were rediscovered and so many gaps that need plugging were duly noted.\n\nHey Jeanne, I’ve shared my favourites, now I look forward to you sharing yours.\n\nI never did find that damn Groundhogs album!!!\n\nI have been watching a lot of You tube clips over the past couple of weeks. I set of with best intentions of learning something new on guitar (Romeo and Juliet this week) but get rapidly impatient with myself when I don’t master a new song by the second try. If it first you don’t succeed……..just search for something more interesting.\n\nI found the following three clips this week. Each features a great guitarist interpreting pieces not written with the guitar in mind.\n\nJeff Beck – Nessun Dorma\n\nI saw Jeff Beck supporting ZZ Top at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. I have always loved his playing but thought he had become too ‘noodly’ in his later years. Not at this show, Beck was awesome……….he blew ZZ Top off the stage!!\n\nI’d lose the boots Jeff!!!\n\nEleanor Rigby – Stanley Jordan\n\nI first saw Stanley Jordan on much missed music show the Tube. I stared open mouthed at the screen. I had never seen anyone play the guitar like him.\n\nStar Spangled Banner – Jimi Hendrix\n\nThis closes Woodstock. Jimi starts playing the National anthem faithfully but then veers off course. Hendrix seems to mimics explosions, machine gunfire and a wailing emergency siren – musical images of horror. Hendrix had served in the US air force and still had many friends who were in Vietnam. Hendrix then plays the “Taps” melody, a tune traditionally performed at military funerals to honor the sacrifice of service.\n\nFinally, he returns to the traditional anthem melody, offering a full and faithful conclusion to the song. One of the defining moments in Rock music history\n\nI’ll finish off this blog with a few more comedy clips. I felt much better watching these clips and laughing out loud. I hope you find them funny as well\n\nJeremy Thorpe (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979, and as leader of the Liberal Party between 1967 and 1976. In May 1979 he was tried at the Old Bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, arising from an earlier relationship with Norman Scott, a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and the furore surrounding it, ended his political career. It was felt at the time that the British establishment had looked after one of its own. As official documents were released over the years it was seen that this was no conspiracy theory. Thorpe may have lost his political career but he never went to jail which he surely should have done.\n\nThis clip features Peter Cook spoofing the Judge summing up at the Jeremy Thorpe trial. It is hilarious, but like a lot of the best comedy, the underlying theme is to expose corruption in high places.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyos-M48B8U\n\nFrom the same Amnesty benefit are two clips of Rowan Atkinson. This was in the pre Mr Bean years when Atkinson was at his funniest in my opinion. The first clip features a duet with Kate Bush! The second clip features Atkinson as the Devil greeting new arrivals in Hell.\n\nThe final clip is a compilation of Billy Connolly jokes. Still the king of comedy for me\n\nThanks for reading. I’ll finish with a couple of quotes\n\nThere is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.\n\nErnest Hemingway\n\nWe live in strange time’s comrades. Increasingly large parts of our lives are on lock down. Some of us are personally locked down for the foreseeable future. I have just completed a week of self-isolation; I’ve had to work at home for a week and I found it unbelievably stressful. It’s likely that we will all have to spend time confined to our homes in the near future so I thought it would be good to focus on things that can lift the spirit whilst helping pass the time.\n\nAs you may guess I’ll start with music. I’ve picked five tracks that never fail to lift my spirits when I hear them\n\nI still believe – Frank Turner\n\nI first heard this track watching highlights from the Cambridge Folk festival a few years ago. I was shocked to see how crazy the crowd went when Frank played this track as I’d never heard it nor heard of him before. I’m a big fan of Frank’s music now and this track never fails to get my adrenaline flowing and fist pumping. If you like it check out the album ‘England keep my bones’ a fine tribute to my home country.\n\nJeruselem – William Blake\n\nA few years ago we were In Glastonbury, one of our favourite towns in one of our favourite parts of England. It was a beautiful day and we enjoyed browsing around the market and talking to the many New agers and Pagans that sell a wide range of esoteric wares. We saw that there was a bus that would take us to the foot of Glastonbury Tor so we jumped on. I love seeing Glastonbury Tor on the horizon, so iconic. Anyway, by the time we disembarked the sun was blazing and the temperature had soared into the eighties. I have MS. It’s a shitty condition at the best of times but it plays particular havoc in hot and humid conditions. Putting discomfort to the back of my mind we set off walking up the Tor. It is not really a challenging climb, a pleasant stroll if you’re relatively fit. It nearly fucking killed me! I must admit I faltered in the very last stages and thought about turning back. Pat encouraged me and I got to the top. I sat in the shade on the cold stone bench in Saint Michael’s Tower the emblematic building at the summit of the Tor. It was a truly spiritual moment. Later I sat alone in the sun gazing over the mythical Isle of Albion feeling lucky to be alive and proud of my heritage.\n\nI first heard the hymn Jerusalem at Barrow Grammar school for Boys. I have loved it ever since. It never fails to swell my heart with pride and patriotism. My funeral Hymn I think (along with It’s a grand old team of course!!)\n\nThis Land is your Land (Woody Guthrie) performed by Mary Gauthier\n\n1st June 2017 we saw Mary Gauthier at the String Jam Club in the Scottish Borders town of Selkirk. The club is held in the County Hotel where we were staying. Mary Gauthier was staying there as well. Just prior to her going on stage President Trump announced (via Twitter of course) he was pulling the USA out of the Kyoto protocol on climate change. Mary was truly horrified. She walked on stage and apologised on behalf of the American people. She then played a heartfelt, understated and very moving version of this Woody Guthrie classic. It was a truly moving moment that I will never forget. The song has been a regular encore at her shows ever since.\n\nI love the words and the sentiment of this song. It says in the Bible that The meek shall inherit the earth. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a 19th century French politician who was the first person to declare himself an anarchist said ‘Property is theft’ and Woodie Guthrie wrote this rallying cry to the working classes. Remember in these troubling times ‘This land was made for you and me’\n\nThis is the America I recognise and love as much as I love my own country\n\nThis clip was recorded at my favourite venue – The Met theatre – Bury\n\nThelma and Louise – Trish Murphy\n\nAnyone with Daughters knows the importance of Female empowerment. The world is split pretty much equally between Males and Females. Power and influence is split 90-10 in favour of males. Surely any idiot can see that this is wrong???…………………….I guess not.\n\nI was already a fan of Trish Murphy when I heard this track from the Girls get in free album. I loved it from the get go. On the album it is a rollicking anthem. I was delighted to find this clip of an acoustic version on YouTube. I love the sentiment behind this ode to female empowerment. If you it like then treat yourself and buy Girls get in Free, Rubies on the lawn or any other album by Trish. You won’t be disappointed. She does a great version of These Boots are made for walkin’ on Rubies on the lawn. Enjoy!!!\n\nWhat a wonderful world – Louis Armstrong\n\nI can’t say it any better than Satchmo\n\nInspiration\n\nAt work I have a PowerPoint presentation I turn to when I’m feeling stressed or doubting my ability to succeed. It contains a collection of quotes that I find inspirational. Most of them are from business leaders but I have started to add quotes from anyone that lifts my spirits and makes believe in the power of positive thought. I will share with you a few of my favourites. How do they make you feel? Who inspires you?\n\nRobert Kennedy. The greatest President who never was. Sirhan Sirhan I hope you rot in hell. Like Mark David Chapman you snuffed out a candle of hope.\n\nMary Kay Ash was a Texan lady. She started Mary Kay cosmetics with a $5000 loan from her son in 1963. Mary became a Billionaire.\n\nI love this quote. It inspires me as a People manager. Think about it………its true isn’t it?\n\nNext time you walk past a homeless person and look the other way remember Mary’s words and hang your head in shame.\n\nIn 2018 we visited the National Civil Liberties museum at the former Lorraine Motel in Memphis Tennessee. The Lorraine Motel is where Martin Luther King was shot and killed by James Earl Jones (hmmm, read about it, do you believe it was him?). I wept all the way round. I felt deeply ashamed to be white, at man’s inhumanity to man. The story of Rosa Parks is both moving and inspiring.\n\nRosa Parks was a civil rights activist who refused to surrender her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her defiance sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Its success launched nationwide efforts to end racial segregation of public facilities.\n\nRosa Parks died aged 92 in 2005. There are few people in life who manage to inspire lasting change.\n\nRIP Sister Rosa.\n\nIn England Women were not allowed to vote until 6 Feb 1918 and then only those aged 30 or over. Full democracy for all over 21 only came in 1928. This was only due to the efforts of the Women’s Suffrage movement. Emmeline Pankhurst formed the Women’s Suffragette movement.\n\nSisters, treasure your vote. Brave women gave their lives to win it for you. Use it wisely. We men haven’t got a fucking clue!!!\n\nDave Hickson was renowned for his physical approach as a centre forward, which coupled with his determination soon made him a crowd favourite. Off the pitch, Hickson was a different man, quiet and unassuming, but the Dave Hickson that pulled on a Blue shirt and entered battle every Saturday afternoon was an aggressive character, no quarter given or asked. This aggression would lead to several run-ins with officials, and three sendings-off during his career, but that was his style & the fans loved it. A youthful Hickson with his striking appearance, fully quiffed up with a shock of blonde hair, as was the style of the day, was one of the few things to get excited about on the terraces of Goodison Park. Dave Hickson soon forged a productive partnership with John Willie Parker, with Hickson being the target man. Although his reputation as an aerial threat was well known, Hickson was also a difficult opponent with the ball on the floor, and could produce a powerful shot, which earned him the nickname Cannonball Kid. Hickson played more than 400 games between 1948 and 1963 most for Everton. Dave played for the following his clubs.\n\nEverton\n\nAston Villa\n\nHuddersfield Town\n\nEverton\n\nLiverpool\n\nCambridge City\n\nBury\n\nTranmere Rovers\n\nHis most famous quote was;\n\n“I’d break every bone in my body for any club I play for but I’d die for Everton.”\n\nI have that quote on the back of a T shirt that will never be thrown away.\n\nDave died aged 83 in July 2013 and was an Ambassador for Everton football until he passed away.\n\nRIP Dave Hickson\n\nSport\n\nThe worst thing about the last two weeks has been the absence of sport. Many now realise how integral sport is in our daily lives. Whatever is your sporting gig I bet you’re missing it?\n\nIn Football, all Leagues in Great Britain have been suspended and the European championships cancelled. It’s highly likely that the Olympics will be cancelled. The US Masters Golf tournament and the USPGA have been cancelled and all Cricket worldwide is suspended. I have picked just a few examples, there are many more. I was watching youtube clips last night to slake my sporting thirst. I will now share with you five sportsmen who I have loved watching over the years. I know you will all have your own heroes in a wide variety of sports so I hope my choices will inspire you to consider your own top 5.\n\nViv Richards\n\nI love cricket. I have been lucky to have watched some of the greatest batsmen to have played the game. One reigns supreme though. Vivian Alexander Richards was born in Antigua in 1952 and went on to play for the great West Indies side from 1975 – 1991. Viv was a force of nature, the most destructive batsmen I have ever seen. Watch the following clip of him scoring a century against Australia to see what I mean.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjsoRQnSb-E\n\nShane Warne\n\nTo even things up I have to pick a bowler as well. I would have loved to pick an Englishman, Botham, Willis or Anderson perhaps. I would at least have liked it to be a fast bowler. Dennis Lillee, Michael Holding and Malcom Marshall are all heroes of mine. The best bowler I have ever seen is a Spinner, a leg spinner. He is also an Australian. Shane Warne was quite simply awesome. I loved watching him bowling. He out thought batsmen and intimidated the world’s best with his ability. He also dated Liz Hurley…………..respect!\n\nDick Butkus\n\nLike many Walneyites, the highlight of my week used to be Sunday lunchtime in the Vickerstown Institute. Back then licensing laws meant that the bar could only serve between 12.0 and 2.0 pm. What two hours they were though. There would be a dozen or so of us sat around the same table. I can hear the laughter now, remember the characters and shake my head at how much drink we managed to consume in two hours. It takes me a week to drink that much today!! Much of the conversation revolved around sport. American Football started to become popular in the UK in the late Eighties. Much of the debate in the ‘Tute was around which was the hardest sport Rugby League or American Football. The Walney cognoscenti argued that Rugby League deserved the accolade with the vote almost unanimous. I argued on behalf of the American game, my only supporter was the legendary Red Dog, a Rugby League fan himself. I found a video called Crunchtime – The NFL’s hardest hitters. One player to feature was Chicago Bears Middle Linebacker Dick Butkus. My god this man was awesome, truly scary. When the Vickerstown barflies watched the video the which sport is the hardest argument melted away and went back to more sensible sporting debate.\n\nButkus became an actor when he retired from Football and proved to be a relaxed, funny human being. The Vickerstown Institute closed. I still miss those Sunday lunchtimes. I miss Red Dog, a truly funny man. Red Dog is still alive but his story is a troubled one for another time. Those who know him know what a fantastic guy he is.\n\nNolan Ryan\n\nTo Baseball. In 1993 Pat and I were on holiday in Texas. We stayed two nights in Arlington across the road from the ballpark. Pat said that she wasn’t going to the ball game two nights on the run so I had to choose which game I saw. Displaying my renowned patience I opted for the first night. The Texas Rangers were playing the Chicago White Sox. This was my first live Baseball game and I loved it. I sang the Star Spangled Banner, fist clenched to my breast. I did the Seventh inning stretch and I also got totally shit canned. It was one of the best nights of my life. The Rangers got beat but it didn’t spoil a great night. I bought every Rangers souvenir in the shop, ate Nachos and became best friends with the Beer boys.\n\nThe following night I had to settle for watching the game on big screen tv in a restaurant tantalisingly close to the ball park. That night the Rangers Pitcher was the legendary Nolan Ryan. Nolan was then 46 years old and playing his final season. Imagine my bitter disappointment at not only missing seeing the great man in action in the flesh but I also missed one of the most famous moments in Baseball history. Check it out\n\nI loved the headline in the following day’s local newspaper\n\n‘Nolan pitches a six hitter’!!\n\nDuncan Ferguson\n\nI have to finish with Soccer. Not only Soccer but my beloved EFC. Not only EFC but my all-time hero Duncan Ferguson. Duncan was branded a thug by the red top press, as a bad example for youngsters. When Big Dunc signed for Everton from Glasgow Rangers he was told that the players operated a rota so that every week a few of them would spend the afternoon at Alder Hey Children’s hospital spending time with sick kids and handing out club merchandise. Duncan refused to join the rota, instead he said he would be there every week. He was as good as his word. He kept in touch with some of the kids when he was transferred to Newcastle. Big Dunc returned to Everton and carried on his weekly visits until he retired. After his career ended Dunc moved his family to Majorca. He still stayed in touch with the sick children in Alder Hey though. Big Dunc was a hard man on the pitch but a thug?? Does he sound like a thug??\n\nReading\n\nA great way to pass the time whilst enriching your life is to read a book. Whatever you’re interested in there’s a book out there about it. Whether it’s the escapism afforded by a good novel or the knowledge gained from a good biography, the learning you can get from a book on a specific topic or the inspiration you can get from travel books you will find reading a truly rewarding experience.\n\nI have picked five books. This was truly hard as I have loved reading since I was five. I have read thousands of books across every sphere of literature. The books I have picked are not necessarily my favourites just examples of the different genres I love.\n\nBetween the stops – Sandi Toskvig\n\nThis is the book I am currently reading. It is in essence an autobiography but Sandi has written about her life using her Bus journey from her home in Dulwich to the BBC studios in Central London as a central theme. Sandi uses the stops along the journey as a way of describing her journey through life. I have always enjoyed watching her on TV and find her funny but I have really enjoyed getting to know the real Sandi Toskvig. I have also enjoyed reading about parts of London that I have added to my must visit list\n\nHarry Potter – J K Rowling\n\nI can’t pick one of the seven books in the Harry Potter series, it’s not fair. They are absolutely fantastic, right up there with Tolkien and CS Lewis. Do not make the mistake of dismissing them as children’s books because they are so much more. There is more wisdom about the human race in these seven books than there is in many academic theses. Do yourself a favour and read them, the films are good but they do not do these wonderful books justice.\n\nIn my life – Alan Johnson\n\nAlan Johnson was a Labour politician who retired in 2017. A former postman, Johnson was renowned for his common sense and sense of reason. He wrote a highly lauded autobiography over three volumes charting his journey from humble beginning in London in 1950, through being orphaned at age thirteen and ending in a successful political career. I have all three books but am yet to read them. I have read, however, In my life. This book is about Alan Johnson’s lifelong love affair with music. It is wonderful; our musical tastes have many similarities although I think mine are better! The mark of a good autobiography is when you finish it; you really want to meet the person. I know I would enjoy a few pints with Johnson talking about music with a sprinkle of politics.\n\nHigh Fidelity – Nick Hornby\n\nAnother book about music but this time a novel. I enjoy Nick Hornby’s books which started with Fever Pitch, his story of being a lifelong Arsenal fan leading up to the title winning season in 1989. The book though intersperses Football with Hornby’s life story. Well worth a read whether you’re a fellow Gooner or a true Football fan. High Fidelity tells the story of a guy who owns a record shop in London. It describes his musical snobbery, something I can empathise with. The novel is so much more than that. It is about relationships, about the difference between men and women and ultimately about the ability of music to be a power of good. It was made into a decent film although the demands of Hollywood forced it to be transported to Chicago. Believe me comrades, the book is much better than the film.\n\nThe Dharma bums – Jack Kerouac\n\nKerouac is one of my favourite authors. On the Road is his most famous work. It is a great book but not his best in my opinion Big Sur is another fantastic book. It makes me want to experience the magnificence of this part of Northern California. The Dharma Bums is the Kerouac novel that does it for me. Like all of his books it has an autobiographical feel to it. The open spaces and Buddhist overtones of this book appeal to me. A troubled man but a genius nonetheless.\n\nMovies\n\nI appreciate that some people would much prefer to watch a good film than read a book or listen to music. I prefer the latter two but I do like a good film so I have picked five of my own favourites.\n\nThe Shawshank redemption\n\nOstensibly a prison movie this film is so much more. Based on a Stephen King short story the movie is based around a grave injustice. It is ultimately one of the most uplifting films of all time. Truly great performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.\n\nThe Wedding Singer\n\nCheesy, yeah but I don’t care. This film features two of my favourite actors Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Their on screen chemistry led to a number of other movies. This is my favourite though, I can watch it again and again and never get bored. A truly feel good film.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nThe acting talent alone makes this film worth watching. Francis Ford Coppola’s masterpiece features stellar performances by Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Dianne Keaton and Talia Shire amongst many others. Towering above the rest though is the incomparable Marlon Brando. If you’ve ever wondered what the fuss is about then watch Brando in this film. He brings Don Corleone to life in a way that nobody else could. I read the novel by Mario Puzo before seeing the film and the author himself couldn’t have imagined Don Corleone as vividly as they he is brought to life by Brando.\n\nThe Godfather is my favourite film of all time. When I am treated with disrespect I close my eyes and imagine the scene at the christening of Michael Corleone’s Nephew. I can put life back into perspective after that meditation!!\n\nDirty Harry\n\nIf the Godfather is my favourite film then Clint Eastwood is my favourite actor. I could have picked Grand Torino, The Outlaw Josie Wales, Pale Rider even Every which way but loose but I have gone with the character which established Eastwood as a star. Harry Callahan is a San Francisco Homicide detective who employs unorthodox methods to solve crimes. This film introduced the world to the .44 Magnum, Harry’s weapon of choice. The series eventually ran to five movies with the Economic law of diminishing returns applying. Once you see this film burned into your mind will be Eastwood gently intoning to a bankrobber\n\n‘This gun in my hand is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you’ve got to ask yourself one question: ‘Do I feel lucky? ‘\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nI’ll finish off the movie section with the ultimate feel good movie The Wizard of Oz. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t watched this brilliant film. Towering above everything is the performance of Judy Garland. What a talent, what a screen presence. Judy Garland went on to lead a tragically short life but this film stands as testament to her brilliance. I love to listen to her sing Somewhere over the Rainbow, one of my all-time favourite movie tunes.\n\nComedy\n\nThey say that laughter is the best medicine. It’s true: laughter is strong medicine. It draws people together in ways that trigger healthy physical and emotional changes in the body. Laughter strengthens your immune system, boosts mood, diminishes pain, and protects you from the damaging effects of stress. Nothing works faster or more dependably to bring your mind and body back into balance than a good laugh. Humor lightens your burdens, inspires hope, connects you to others, and keeps you grounded, focused, and alert. It also helps you release anger and forgive sooner.\n\nWith so much power to heal and renew, the ability to laugh easily and frequently is a tremendous resource for surmounting problems, enhancing your relationships, and supporting both physical and emotional health. Best of all, this priceless medicine is fun, free, and easy to use.\n\nI have picked five of my favourite comedy moments. I watched or listened to them again yesterday and laughed out loud all the way through. Check them out, I hope you enjoy them too. I hope they inspire to hunt down some of your favourite comedy moments.\n\nThe Crucifixion – Billy Connolly\n\nThis is nearly fifty years old! As you can imagine it caused offence in religious circles but is not really blasphemous, just a great example of Billy Connolly riffing about Glasgow.\n\nBruce’s song – Monty Python\n\nThis short (about one minute) song is not only hilarious it is also very, very clever. I certainly discovered some wonderful Philosophers through this song.\n\nRehab, Alcohol and Drugs – Denis Leary\n\nI never saw Lenny Bruce or Bill Hicks. I did see Denis Leary though. His No cure for Cancer show is a funny today as it was when I first saw it over thirty years ago.\n\nI’ve had it up to here – Victoria Wood\n\nVictoria Wood hails from Bury. There is a statue of her in the town centre dedicated to the memory of this immensely talented, very funny woman. This song was from an Amnesty International benefit show and it still makes me laugh out loud.\n\nTrouble – Rik Mayall\n\nMy favourite British comedy actor. Rik Mayall died tragically young but left behind a legacy of hilarious comedy performances.\n\nI hope that there will be something in this blog that helps you get through these challenging times. Although we may need to self-isolate but that does not stop people from keeping in touch. If you can, reach out and help those less fortunate and remember; Never turn your back on a friend.\n\nIn 1974 a shy, nervous boy started at Barrow Grammar school for buys. I hated most of the next five years but one thing has stayed with me since that first day. Enjoy!!\n\nAfter a musically barren (gig wise) February I was really looking forward to seeing this show. We hadn’t seen Elvis Costello since he played an acoustic show in our hometown in the early eighties. Support act that night was someone I’d never heard of, T Bone Burnett. I vowed to myself to look out for this guy though doubted I’d ever hear about him again………………shows what a musical savant I am!!\n\nWhen I saw Elvis was touring I booked tickets and bought his new album Look Now. I wasn’t disappointed; it’s a damn fine record.\n\nI was also delighted to be returning to Sheffield. On our last visit we saw Mary Gauthier at the University, a great show. We also visited some good pubs and record shops. Gigs, Pubs and record shops………….Truly a holy triumvirate!\n\nSheffield doesn’t immediately conjure up visions of a major musical heritage in the way that London, Liverpool and Manchester do……………..does it? Sheffield, however, spawned Joe Cocker, Paul Carrack, Def Leppard, Cabaret Voltaire, Human League, Pulp, Richard Hawley, Arctic Monkeys and who could forget the mighty Jilted John!!! Pretty damn impressive by anyone’s standards wouldn’t you agree? There are many more, I just got bored of typing, sorry.\n\nFirst stop after checking in at our hotel was Bear Tree Records in the Forum on Division Street. I’d never visited this place but online reviews were good so my expectations were high. I wasn’t disappointed. My mission was to get hold of the new Cornershop album England is a Garden on vinyl which was released the day before. Not only was it in stock but in a limited edition blue vinyl with a poster……………..result. I also picked up a copy of Gillian Welch’s Harrow and the Harvest on vinyl (fantastic sound quality). Both albums were very competitively priced even compared to Amazon. Amazon can never compete with the satisfaction that music fans get from foraging in record shops, surrounded by fellow vinyl anoraks.\n\nPat doesn’t share my enthusiasm for getting heads down in record bins so I called her when my vinyl lust was sated and we met up at a nearby pub the Frog and Parrot. What a find, I greedily surveyed the selection of real ales on offer and settled on a locally brewed Porter, a fine selection. Sat near to us were a bunch of Sheffield United fans partaking in a little libation prior to heading to Bramall Lane to watch their heroes entertain the flatlanders from Norwich. I have a soft spot for Sheffield United as Everton have signed Phil Jagielka, Mason Holgate and Dominic Calvert-Lewin from them, all fine players who have played or will play for England. Sheffield United, or the Blades as they are known to fans, also have a highly respected firm. The Blades Business Crew (BBC) boast former Housemartin and Beautiful South singer Paul Heaton as a former active member and are much respected by Top boys from the firms of all England’s major clubs.\n\nThe Blades hated neighbours are Sheffield Wednesday. Their home ground is Hillsborough. In 1989 96 football fans tragically lost their lives at the FA cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Pause a moment, 96 people died watching a football match……………………killed by the incompetent actions of the Senior Police chiefs in charge that day.\n\nI will never recover from watching the scenes on TV………………….innocent people dying………………..oh shit I weep as I type.\n\nI have loathed the Red top media ever since……………………..the bastards who tried to blame it on drunken fans…………………….Please, please look for the truth before believing the shite pedalled by the right wing media.\n\nI am a proud Evertonian but I feel desperately sorry for those poor Liverpool fans who lost their lives and their families who try to expose the hypocrisy of the official version of events.\n\nMy own Sheffield Wednesday experience cam a decade later. 1998 is a year I will never forget. I lost my Mam…………..My Mam always believed in me, always forgave me for the many things that I did wrong. A few months before she passed I went with my mate Craig to see Everton play Sheffield Wednesday. We were struggling but Wednesday were way worse than us. Any Nobhead could see that we were going to batter them……………………Oh dear, I never reckoned with Paulo Di Canio.\n\nIn all my years watching football at Goodison Park I have never seen a performance such like. ‘D-I Can-io sang the Wednesday fans to the tune of the appalling Otawan song. He was Fucking awesome……………………I saw all the greats from that era but none as good as him.\n\nWednesday won 3-1, the future looked bleak.\n\nUltimately Everton survived but my Mam didn’t……………….\n\nThe other song that resonates from that day was the Wednesday fans chanting to the tune of Singing the Blues;\n\nI’ve never felt more like Singing the Blues\n\nWednesday win, United lose\n\nOh Wednesday\n\nYou’ve got me singin’ the blues\n\nIndeed!\n\nI hope the BBC caught up with you fucking woolybacks!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAnyway, back to our day in Sheffield.\n\nWe took a leisurely walk to the Beer Engine. This pub looks decidedly nondescript from the outside. Inside is a different story. A warm welcome and cool décor await. A great selection of real ales on tap and a menu of freshly cooked Tapas that would melt the hardest of hearts . We enjoyed an enjoyable couple of hours before adjourning for a power nap prior to the evening’s festivities.\n\nSheffield City Hall is a grade 11 listed building which dominates Barker’s Pool, one of Sheffield’s central squares. It is a neo-classical building with a giant portico. The inside of the building is equally impressive with wide staircases and very high ceilings. The great hall is spread over three floors each of which has a bar. We were on the top floor. Our seats were not particularly good. They cost £60 each and had a partially restricted view, a fact not advertised. Fortunately due to a few no shows we were able to blag better seats. The venue has 2217 seats and I would guess 2000 were filled. Support act was Ian Prowse. We didn’t go in to watch them but they sounded OK from the bar.\n\nElvis Costello and the Imposters wandered onstage at 8.15 and launched into Strict Time. In total they played 26 songs in a show that lasted two and a quarter hours. Elvis played most of my favourite songs though I would have liked to have heard a few more tunes from his latest album. Highlights for me were Good year for the roses, (I don’t want to go to) Chelsea, Alison and Pump it up. I particularly enjoyed watching a middle aged couple who were sat on the front row moving off to the side and enthusiastically bustin’ their moves to Pump it up. She throwing all inhibitions to the wind while he was more restrained. I detected a Northern Soul fan background in the shapes they were throwing. The only slight downer for me was that Elvis didn’t play Shipbuilding, one of his finest songs in my opinion. It had featured in all of the preceding shows on this tour although EC seemed to be suffering from a sore throat which would explain its absence. It was a very good show though perhaps not quite a great one. The Imposters are top notch musicians who provide an excellent platform to drive the songs along. I would recommend catching a show if you get chance.\n\nSetlist\n\nStrict Time\n\nClubland\n\nGreen Shirt\n\nAccidents Will Happen\n\nWatch Your Step\n\nJust About Glad\n\nHarry Worth\n\n(I Don’t Want to Go to) Chelsea\n\nSuspect My Tears\n\nWatching the Detectives\n\nA Good Year for the Roses\n\nA Face in the Crowd\n\nI Can’t Stand Up for Falling Down\n\nMystery Dance\n\nBurnt Sugar Is So Bitter\n\nHigh Fidelity\n\nFrom a Whisper to a Scream\n\nAlison\n\nMr. & Mrs. Hush\n\nPump It Up\n\nFlutter & Wow\n\nGetting Mighty Crowded\n\nEveryday I Write the Book\n\nOliver’s Army\n\n(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding\n\nIt’s hard to believe that it is 43 years since Elvis Costello and the Attractions released their first single Less than Zero on Stiff records (Buy 11 fellow anoraks). In the intervening years he has written songs with musical luminaries such as Sir Paul McCartney, Carole King and Burt Bacharach. He was once married to Cait O’Riardon the original bassist with the Pogues and also featured in the second Austin Powers movie………………….yeah baby!!\n\nAfter the show we tried to get in the Spoons next door but it was way too crowded so we walked back to Division Street and the Frog and Parrot. The place was bouncing by now. The good people of Sheffield obviously have excellent taste as all six of the real ales were sold out. I had to settle for a pint of Camden IPA which wasn’t bad. The age group of punters ranged from teenagers to some in their sixties and the atmosphere was really good. The DJ was blasting out Fifties tunes which was absolutely brilliant. Even the youngest punters were getting into the music and I vowed to buy some Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard stuff as they sounded awesome at high volume. After a couple of hours in the Frog and parrot we headed back to the hotel for a nightcap to round off a great day out in Sheffield.\n\nThe following morning we met Jade who was coming off a nightshift at the Children’s hospital. We had breakfast at a good ‘Spoons and caught up for an hour or so. A great way to round off our trip.\n\nI can’t wait to go back to Sheffield. There are many more pubs and record shops that I want to explore and several Indian restaurants that look tempting. I noticed many cool looking vintage shops which I didn’t get to browse in. If it wasn’t such a pig of a journey from our small Island home we would surely visit more often.\n\nI love music, have done since I was very young. It has defined my life, influenced travel plans and consumed a significant part of my income. I have heard many people say they love music too but what they really mean is they like it. Like doesn’t confer any sort of passion hence they use ‘love’.\n\nIn 2017 we embarked on a road trip that took in New Orleans, Clarkesdale, Memphis and Nashville. It cost a fortune but was worth every penny. The whole trip was about music. We saw the Crossroads, the studio where Elvis first recorded, hung out in bars that influenced Rolling Stones lyrics, Marie Laveau’s tomb amongst many other highlights. This year we will visit LA and Austin Texas, two cities steeped in the history of music.\n\nI have drank in Amy Winehouse’s local, Led Zeppelin’s favourite LA hangout, the bar where Janis Joplin had her last drink and the pub that John Lennon chose as the venue for the first date with Cynthia, his wife to be.\n\nI was listening to music last weekend when I realised there are a number of songs that stop me in my tracks. Whatever I am doing, whoever I’m talking to, I need to zone out and concentrate on the song. Some of these songs probably wouldn’t make my personal top fifty, others are in the top five. I will try to explain what it is about them, probably no single reason, but every time I hear them I am transfixed.\n\nThe following list is by no means all but is a significant number. I will try to explain what it is that grabs me and won’t let go.\n\n1952 Vincent Black Lightning – Richard Thompson\n\nOne of my loves is a great lyric, especially one that affects me emotionally. This tune is a tragic love song that makes me well up every time I hear it. I (try to) play guitar and tried to learn this acoustic masterpiece. The first struggle was the tuning CGDGBE – what’s that about?? Secondly Richard Thompson employ’s deft fingerpicking, I can’t even manage crap fingerpicking. Buoyed on by Henry Ford’s words – ‘If you think you can do it or think you can’t do it…………..you’re probably right!’ I persevered. I managed to busk the guitar parts ‘til they sounded ok to me but it was when I tried to sing it. I kept breaking down in tears when I reached the last verse!!……………..Dammit Richard…………….why don’t you cry? How can you make guitar playing seem so effortless?\n\nCheck out this youtube video if you want to understand what the hell I’m going on about\n\nLast of the Hobo Kings – Mary Gauthier\n\nI tried out my theory with this one. I put ‘Live at Blue Rock’ by Mary Gauthier on and had to stop when Last of the Hobo Kings came on. Now Mary Gauthier is one of the finest lyricist’s of all time and a writer of many heart wrenching songs. This is not one of them. I like to think of this as a celebration of an alternative life well lived. I first heard it at a Mary Gauthier show in Bury. She told the story of why she wrote the song before playing it and the story has stayed with me ever since.\n\nOver to Mary Gauthier:\n\nI was in the café atrium sipping Dutch coffee one morning when I saw a headlined obituary in the International Herald Tribune newspaper for Steam Train Maury Graham, the Grand Patriarch of the Hobo Nation. I’d never heard of him, but I read his obituary and it grabbed me, he grabbed me, and I knew I’d found the thread of the song I should write. My attention fully engaged, I started poking around on my laptop for the more of Steamtrain’s story. The first thing I found was the website for the funeral home where he was being laid to rest. I clicked on his name, landed on a message board and read all the messages posted there from people who loved him, mostly other hobos. I kept poking around, digging up hobo treasures and gathering hobo stories from all over the web.\n\nMaury Graham was a folk hero and legendary figure in his community, thus the headlined obituary in The New York Times, and The International Herald Tribune paper. I travelled deep into the vernacular and history of hobos in America, and time flew by. I learned about the hobo jungles and the hobo gatherings, the annual King and Queen elections, and the hobo lifestyle. It was a wonderful journey into a world I’d never visited and I emerged a few days later with the song in hand. It’s one of my favourite songs I’ve ever written.\n\nNew Rose – The Damned\n\nI had yet to reach my teenage years when this song was released. Even in my early years I was an avid reader of the music press thus I was aware of Punk Rock as it began to evolve in London in 1976. The Sex Pistols were the band all music fans were waiting for and wanted to hear. It was The Damned that were the first Punk band to release a single. New Rose was released on the iconic Stiff records (Buy 6 was its catalogue number fellow anoraks). I first heard it on the John Peel show, surreptitiously listening when I had been sent to bed. Man, I was blown away………………I was a Prog rock fan for God’s sake!! My life was changed forever. Rebellion was in the air and I wanted to be a part of it. My education started here.\n\nI bought my copy from Earthquake records. It came in a picture sleeve, Slade didn’t. I got home and played it repeatedly for days on end. From the opening ‘Is she really going out with him?’ through Rat Scabies ferocious drum intro and Bryan James’ fast paced chords I was hooked.\n\nA few weeks later the Pistols released Anarchy in the UK, the Clash released White Riot and the Stranglers released (get a) Grip. The Damned soon became a joke in my eyes, I quickly moved on.\n\nNow, nearly 45 years later, I still stop and freeze when I hear New Rose. I like a few Damned tracks but my God, this song changed my life and opened doors that have kept me exploring musically ever since.\n\nI have friends who say that Punk was ‘not music’, ‘the end of music’……………….the same people who say they love music but really mean they like it. Even worse, they only like safe tum-ti- tum pleasant tunes.\n\nCheck this track out. This is where it began in England. In America it was the MC5, the Stooges then the Ramones. As Bob Dylan said ‘The times they are a changin’\n\nMiss Ohio – Gillian Welch\n\nTime to calm things down after the rousing clarion call of Punk. Time the Revelator was the first Gillian Welch song I heard and it’s fair to say I was hooked. I came late to Gillian’s music but I quickly bought everything she’d released. Soul Journey’s was supposed to be the album that made me think she’d sold out and gone too commercial. I put the album on, It started with Miss Ohio. I had to pull over, listen to the whole album, then listen to Miss Ohio again before I could continue my drive into work. To this day Miss Ohio makes me stop whatever I’m doing and listen with 100% attention.\n\nThe line “I want to do right but not right now” echoes a famous prayer of St Augustine; “Lord, make me pure—but not yet.”. Here the line is detached from a religious context but the sentiment appears to be similar! A nice allusion to the dualities of human nature. Maybe Miss Ohio went on to be good after all … or maybe not …\n\nListen to Gillian sing\n\nShe’s a-running around with her rag-top down\n\nShe says, I want to do right but not right now\n\nHow does it make you feel? How does Gillian sound? It grabbed me the first time I heard it and still does now.\n\nYou were always on my mind – Willie Nelson\n\nContinuing in a mellower mood comes one of the finest love songs of all time. Written by Johnny Christopher, Mark James, and Wayne Carson it was first recorded by B.J. Thomas in 1970. I’ve never heard the original version so can’t comment. For me this song this is about two singers; Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson.\n\nElvis’ version is awesome. I can’t relate to people who claim they don’t like Elvis. Sure he didn’t write his own songs, most of his music was schmaltzy and insignificant, his films were crap but when he did get it right there was no-one better. Listen to his early music, that’s what the fuss is about. Awesome doesn’t begin to describe how good he was. I’ll never forget standing in Sun studios listening to the original acetate of That’s alright Mama………..stunning. In RCA Studio B the guide told the story that Elvis liked to record in the dark……she dimmed the light and played the first take of Are you lonesome tonight……………..spine tingling!!!!!!\n\nSo why Willie Nelson? It’s the voice, calming, mesmerising, so goddam believable. The lyrics of this song make me think of my own failings and frailties. I wish I could look the love of my life in her eyes and apologise my weaknesses. If I could, I would want to sound like Willie Nelson. What a voice, what a guy. Who would not want to be Willie Nelson? “As adults we try to relax from the never-ending quest for reason and order by drinking a little whiskey or smoking whatever works for us, but the wisdom isn’t in the whiskey or the smoke. The wisdom is in the moments when the madness slips away and we remember the basics.”\n\nWillie built his own golf course on his ranch:\n\n“Par is whatever I say it is. I’ve got one hole that’s a par 23 and yesterday I damn near birdied the sucker.”\n\nWhat a man, what a song……………………Pour yourself a self a big one or skin yourself a fat one, dim the lights and listen to Willie singing You were always on my mind.\n\nCaptain Beefheart Big Eyed Beans from Venus\n\nTime to let your freak flag fly.\n\nI first heard this song when I was at school. Back then it stopped me in my tracks, slapped me in the face……..It was different to anything I’d ever heard. The opening riff, the guitar tone, Captain Beefheart’s rasp……I was hooked. I had heard of the Captain as I was a Frank Zappa fan. I loved his singing on ‘Willie the Pimp’ from the Hot Rats album.\n\nThis song has, without doubt, some of the best guitar work you’ll ever hear on record. It’s delta blues from another dimension. I was talking to an immensely talented local guitarist a few years ago who I knew to be a Beefheart fan. I asked if he could play Big Eyed Beans from Venus and he guardedly admitted he could. It was fairly obvious that he didn’t want to show me how, what he didn’t know was that I don’t want to even try. I’d only ruin it!\n\nClear Spot was the first Captain Beefheart album I heard. I was amazed by the chords, the rhythm, the lyrics, the poetry and then came Big eyed beans from Venus. Forty odd years on this track still amazes me. I will probably like you if you’ve heard this track. If you love it like I do then I will definitely like you.\n\nThis was one of John Peel’s favourite songs of all time.\n\nMr. Zoot Horn Rollo\n\nHit that long lunar note\n\nAnd let it float\n\n…………Pure bliss………..\n\nSonny’s Lettah – Linton Kwesi Johnson\n\nLinton Kwesi Johnson, also known as LKJ, is a Jamaican dub poet who has been based in the United Kingdom since 1963. In 2002 he became the second living poet, and the only black poet, to be published in the Penguin Modern Classics series. His performance poetry involves the recitation of his own verse in Jamaican Patois over dub-reggae, usually written in collaboration with renowned British reggae producer/artist Dennis Bovell.\n\nTolly, a guy I used to work with, loaned me Forces of Victory by LKJ when I told him I liked Reggae music. I don’t know what I expected but it certainly wasn’t an album of poetry. The music is a bit part player as LKJ’s poetry is mesmerising. I love Jamaican patois, it conjures visions of tropical sunshine, strong Rum cocktails and fast bowlers. Sonny’s Lettah has a serious message. It is an anti Sus poem. Sus law empowered the police to arrest any person they suspected of loitering with intent to commit an arrestable offence. …The vast majority of those arrested were Black people. The sus law caused widespread public concern and was abolished after the 1981 Brixton riots.\n\nThis poem gripped me the first time I heard it and still does today. I can’t imagine how it felt to live under its shadow. Sadly, Sus seems to be making a comeback with ‘Stop and search’ policy implemented by many police forces today. Evidence seems to suggest that this policy has, at best, limited impact on violent crime levels.\n\nHave a listen to Sonny’s Lettah\n\nRoute 66 – Chuck Berry\n\nWritten by Bobby Troup this ode to the Mother road has been covered by a huge number of artists. The Rolling Stones did a great version as did Doctor Feelgood but my favourite cover was recorded by Chuck Berry. Troup was a Jazz musician who wrote the song in 1946 inspired by his drive West to look for fame and fortune in Los Angeles. Nat King Cole heard the song and released the first cover version and made it a hit.\n\nI love America and this song always symbolised the American dream to me. Though I have never driven from Chicago to LA I have travelled parts of the Mother road and loved every minute. Try and visit Seligman, Arizona the small town that was the inspiration behind the Disney film Cars. We met Angel Delgadillo who is a business owner in Seligman who has been dubbed the “guardian angel” of U.S. Route 66. He is the main founder of the Historic Route 66 Association of Arizona, established in 1987 to campaign for “Historic Route 66” signage on the former US highway; similar initiatives have since been established in every U.S. Route 66 state. It was Angel who lobbied Congress to recognise Route 66 as having National historic status. He is a truly wonderful, modest, friendly man. I can’t do a road trip without Route 66 being a key fixture on my music compilation.\n\nBorn to Run – Bruce Springsteen\n\nAnother road song. For years I really didn’t like Bruce Springsteen. He epitomised all I disliked about stadium gigs full of chest beating anthems…………….except I loved this song from the first time I heard it. When I hear the crashing opening chords I want to jump up, dance, sing a long at the top of my voice, grab a guitar and play along pausing briefly to learn to play Saxophone. This song still makes me feel good every time I hear it, remember how it felt when me and Pat were younger and the whole world felt open to us. All we could see were opportunities to see the parts of the world we dreamed of. I guess Bruce is singing about getting out of New Jersey with his girl. He did of course……..but today can look back fondly to those Asbury Park days that defined him.\n\nThis is another tune that is a must have on my road trip compilations. If I feel down I only need to play this song to lift my spirits.\n\nBruce Springsteen redeemed himself in my eyes with Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom Joad and the Seeger sessions. It is Born to Run though that will always define him in my eyes\n\nSmells like Teen Spirit – Nirvana\n\nI still vividly remember staring, open mouthed at the TV screen when I first saw the video for Smells like Teen Spirit on MTV. I love the slowly swaying janitor and the cheerleaders who go through the motions until becoming energised as the crowd wake up and begin to mosh.\n\nKurt Cobain said he was trying to rip off the Pixies when he wrote it. Cobain came up with the song’s title when his friend Kathleen Hanna, at the time the lead singer of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill, wrote “Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit” on his wall. Hanna meant that Cobain smelled like the deodorant Teen Spirit, which his then-girlfriend Tobi Vail wore. Cobain said he was unaware of the deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted it as a revolutionary slogan, as they had been discussing anarchism and punk rock. How goddam cool is that???\n\nI am hooked from the moment I hear the guitar riff. I love Kurt’s voice, love the lyrics. I can’t help but think how he would have turned out if he hadn’t tragically taken his own life at the Rock’n’Roll occult age of 27. I can’t sit down and listen to this track………I need to be up playing air guitar and singing along, empathising with Kurt. Another song that heralded a revolution in popular music. RIP Kurt\n\nWell that’s ten tunes which feels like a good number to end on. I am torn by the fact that I didn’t get to write about:\n\nAin’t Nuthin’ but a G thang – Dr Dre\n\nI still believe – Frank Turner\n\nJeruselam – Steve Earle\n\nPancho and Lefty – Townes Van Zandt\n\nI walk on gilded splinters – Dr John\n\nI had to stop somewhere or this blog would have become a book! When your life is defined by music you build up a vast library of tunes that define stages of your life. I said at the beginning that some of these songs would not get in my top 50 or even top 100. I’m conscious (and somewhat horrified) that I have not included anything by The Beatles, The Stones, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Alex Harvey and many other of my favourite artists. My intention was always to highlight songs that form part of my musical fermata. I bet you have some as well. I hope this blog will cause you to consider your own. I hope you will check out these ten songs. It will only take an hour of your life but hopefully some of these songs will enrich it.\n\nThis blog is dedicated to Earthquake records. You were my musical finishing school, where I got my degree in music that made a difference.\n\nThis blog is about my enduring love for the city of Liverpool. I have visited many of Great Britain’s best cities but none feel as welcoming as Liverpool. Natives are known as Liverpudlians or more commonly as Scousers (after the cities signature dish). In England we have Cockneys, Brummies, Mancs, Northerners, Southerners……..I could go on………but none are as distinctive as Scousers. They are warm people who possess a fantastic sense of humour. They also have an inbuilt sense of fairness. This gets the city unfairly labelled as a hotbed of left wing thinking. The Labour party created the NHS and places social justice at the forefront of its policies. These are values that resonate with Liverpudlians hence the city’s left wing reputation. When you walk around the city you will notice that people regularly drop coins in the cups of the homeless, showing these unfortunate Brothers and Sisters their due respect. Only in Glasgow do you see similar respect shown to those less fortunate.\n\nI have been coming to Liverpool for many years. My Dad sailed from here when he was in the Merchant Navy. There will be no nostalgia for the early years more a celebration of the cities pubs and people! But first I owe to myself to begin with a love story that has lasted half a century. I am an Everton fan, I love the Blues. It goes without saying that I hate the scum from across Stanley Park so they will not be mentioned again.\n\nSadly, I no longer get to the match so I dearly miss visiting the Old Lady, The school of science, Goodison Park. When I watched my beloved Blue boys my heart would nearly burst when Z Cars played as the players ran onto the pitch. There have been so many good times. Watching Duncan Ferguson and hearing the crowd sing his name to the tune of Go West. I was there on the last day of the season for the game against Coventry when relegation was a strong possibility. The atmosphere was incredible, the fear palpable. We drew 1-1 (cheers Gareth Farelly) and Chelsea beat Bolton so we stayed up. I don’t know who was the most relieved, us or the Coventry fans who had to get home safely! I remember my friend Geoff and I taking our young daughters to see us play Man Utd who were top of the league. We went into half time lucky to be only one – nil down. In the second half we absolutely battered them and were unlucky to only draw. Our girls saw what it means to be a Blue, they are Blues to this day. I also remember watching a midweek match against Man Utd where I finally understood what the fuss about David Beckham was…………he tore us apart!\n\nI love the pubs around Goodison. I mourn the passing of the Blue House and of the pub that I can’t remember the name of that was close to Kirkdale station. A special place in my heart is reserved for The Winslow. This pub is opposite the main stand. On match days it is full of Blues looking forward to the match. It is near impossible to get served, the beer is average (no real ale) but the atmosphere is unforgettable. I worry that if Everton relocate to Bramley Moore Dock then the Winslow will perish along with Goodison Park. It is not the nicest or safest neighbourhood you will visit but history paves its streets and some of the best people on God’s great earth live there.\n\nOne last story about the neighbourhood. I have a friend who is a Drugs Counsellor. One early Summer day he and his Dad were walking up towards Goodison park. A young lad on a bike buzzed them a couple of times. He shouted to my friend ‘what are you doing around here?’. ‘We’re going to buy our season tickets’ he replied. The young lad shook his head and said ‘ and you’re counselling me?’\n\nIn the Nineties a bunch of us regularly took the two hour train journey to Liverpool to watch the Blues. We would head for the Canarvon Castle pub on Tarleton street just off Lord street. This great little pub serves The best sandwich ever!! Toasted Bacon, Egg and Cheese. I can taste it as I type. I’ll never forget eagerly ordering six of these delicacies only to be told by the young barman that they didn’t serve such sandwiches , only what was on the menu. I perused said menu and ordered six Cheese, Egg and Bacon!!! Obviously this Mensa dodger must be a Koppite!. The landlord always hailed us by shouting ‘The Woolybacks are in’ It was always taken in the best spirit and I truly miss those halcyon days.\n\nWe always headed for Coopers bar opposite Central Station. This tiny pub needs to be experienced to be believed. You can find yourself entertained by a Leprechaun Karaoke singer, offered black market goods or just included in the conversation of the regular punters. We use to meet Frank and Johnny in Coopers. Frank was my Dad’s best friend and He and Johnny were passionate Blues. We drank and laughed right up to game time. Sometimes we would meet them after the game in the Winslow and carry on. Both of them have sadly passed away. I miss Frank so much, he helped me when my Mam passed away and was always there when I needed advice. I will never meet a more generous man and I am proud to have counted him as a friend. I always remind Frank’s daughter that when her and her son wear red Santa suits at the Santa dash that Frank will be looking down shaking his head. He’ll still love them though!\n\nNext door to Coopers is one of my favourite pubs on earth. The Globe is a small bar with a sloping floor that makes you feel drunk before you have had your first pint! This place is friendliness personified. I like to go there while my wife is shopping. I sit drinking a pint, people watching and listening. The ladies behind the bar are brilliant. You never wait to be served and they always remember what you are drinking. My wife loves the Globe as well, when she rings to see where I am and I tell her I am in there, she tells me to order her a beer and that she will be there in five minutes. If you love pubs that play great tunes and are full of trendy people then don’t go to the Globe. If you just like to relax and enjoy a good craic then make a beeline for the Globe.\n\nAnother favourite City centre haunt of mine is The White Star. This pub sits at the entrance to Mathew Street and is named after the Shipping line that counted the Titanic as the centrepiece of its fleet. There are some great photos of the Titanic on the walls as well as many other shipping related mementos. I like to sit in the back bar and watch football if there is a game on. The back bar of the White Star was apparently used by former Cavern DJ Bob Wooler to pay all the club’s groups, including You Know Who. Where the Beatles wall is in the back room, is where they were paid.\n\nThere are also a number of brass plaques on the front wall: one to the Beatles, one commemorating the twinning with a Czech White Star. Others mark the twinning with pubs in Norway. One with the Mets Sports Bar in Skien, and one with The Fat Lady in, er, Grimstead.\n\nAs I have got older, Mathew Street has become less and less of a much visit. It is filled with theme bars with loud music blaring. Sadly, competition has led to bars employing touts enticing potential customers with the promise off free shots. Too reminiscent of European holiday resorts for my liking, but as I said earlier, I’m getting older. There are gems though, so if you wish to avoid overcrowding visit midweek or on a Sunday. You will find the Cavern club….not the original but a faithful reproduction. Lots of live music in there, much of which is free. Across the way is the Cavern pub. Try to visit on a Wednesday night or early Saturday night and catch a set by the Amazing Kappa band. Paul Kappa is a brilliant guitarist and frontman. He plays for 2-3 hours and his set features both covers and originals. He plays Led Zeppelin tunes like Jimmy Page and plays an amazing version of Norwegian wood. Entrance is free!!! Each brick on the front of the Cavern pub contains the name of artists/bands that have played on Mathew Street. The names are jaw dropping. Outside is also a life-size statue of John Lennon. You will need to tread carefully around a constant stream of people posing for photographs draped around John at all times of day. A further photo opportunity is available back at the Cavern Club where there is a statue of former Cloakroom girl Cilla Black……………….hey, whatever floats your boat. At the corner of Mathew Street is the Hard day’s Night hotel. This is as you can imagine a Beatles themed hotel. Prohibitively expensive at weekends, good deals can be found on Sundays and mid-week. I enjoyed staying there but once was enough. A far better and far more authentic Beatles experience on Mathew Street is The Grapes. This pub is where the lads drank between sets at the Cavern. The old part of the pub has some fantastic photos of the band drinking in there. I always enjoy a pint in the Grapes, it’s authentic which is very refreshing. Mathew street also has Eric’s. This is the venue where Punk bands played in Liverpool and for a time in the late Seventies was a Mecca for serious music fans. Yazoo (Vince Clarke from Erasure and Alison Moyet ) called their debut album Upstairs at Eric’s. The original club closed in 1980. Eric’s re-opened in 2011 and hosts bands most nights of the week. I’ve only been in once recently, not quite my scene but great news that good quality live music is on offer again.\n\nMusic in Liverpool is dominated by The Beatles and rightly so. Although they only lasted for ten years they left behind some of the best tunes of all times. I am sick of having pub arguments at home with people who say they don’t like The Beatles, think they are overrated, say they prefer The Stones. The same people sing along as loud as anyone else when Hey Jude or any other Beatles classic is played on the Juke box! Ironically, The Beatles played more shows in Hamburg than they played in their home town. There are many other fine bands who have hailed from Liverpool; Frankie Goes to Hollywood, The Teardrop Explodes, Echo and the Bunnymen, The La’s and The Zutons to name but a few. It must be a hell of a millstone following The Beatles!\n\nA short walk from Mathew Street just off Dale street is the oldest pub in the city. Ye Hole in Ye Wall Dates from 1726 and stands on the site of a 17th Century Quaker Meeting House. Unusually, due to its history, the cellar is actually on the first floor. More recently – as late as 1977 – this particular haunt became one of the last to open its doors to women. Speaking of haunts, this pub is allegedly the home of a spectre in a long coat. A great pub that serves a fine selection of real ales and is a must visit for history buffs .\n\nIf you leave Ye Hole in Ye Wall and head back towards the Waterfront it is worth visiting The Old Bank on James street. No prizes for guessing why this pub is named thus. It is an amazing building which features ludicrously high ceilings and fantastic ornate chandeliers. Bar prices are very reasonable and the beer and spirits selection is excellent. Behind the old Bank on Old Ropery is the Cornmarket. This Victorian pub is always spotlessly clean. It is a great place to relax and drink a few quiet pints. The Cornmarket serves food and has a beer garden.\n\nIf you walk back along the Strand past Liverpool 1 you will come to one of my favourite pubs in the city. The Baltic Fleet ; a mid-19th century pub named after the crews of Siberian whaling ships who used to frequent it. There are secret tunnels that allegedly lead from the cellar to the dockland, and another leading to the old red light district of Cornhill which provided the ship crews with their most pressing of needs – beer and prostitutes. Although the clientele has now changed, in look, history and character, the Grade II listed Baltic Fleet is arguably Liverpool’s most interesting surviving pub.\n\nNow the cellar is used for brewing a host of exceptional ales in copper kettles making the Baltic Fleet the only brew pub left in Liverpool, with a rotation of 136 recipes for beer. 136! Throw in a log burning fire, stripped pine tables, duck egg blue walls and high windows on three sides, The Baltic Fleet is a must-visit boozer. For Ghost hunters, the Baltic Fleet is supposedly another of Liverpool’s most haunted pubs\n\nI’m very sceptical about ghosts and hauntings but I’m conscious that I mention them a lot. A vocational habit for lovers of old buildings I guess. With this in mind I now take you to the Philharmonic pub on Hope street. This is the place where Paul McCartney played a secret show on the episode of James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke dedicated to him. The pub is most famed for the Gents toilets! The immaculate Victorian pissoir attracts a stream of women on nights out to look at its magnificence (allegedly!). This fantastic place has many ghost stories of which the most spectacular occurred in 1971, when Walter Slim – a man who had been dead for 83 years – walked into the pub and bellowed to the barman: “In the name of human charity, I’ll have your gin sir!” – and he was dressed in the top hat and cape, and was actually served the gin, which he drank, before leaving.’ The ghost is said to have told bemused drinkers his name and that he’d been disturbed from his deathly sleep in his tomb at a local cemetery.\n\nPeople naturally thought the man was a prankster, until later that week when police discovered that Satanists had broken into the tomb of a Walter Slim (1861-1888) in St James’s Cemetery and had not only opened his lead-lined coffin – in which the body was perfectly preserved – they had carried out an elaborate black magic ritual called the Octagenesis of Resurrection – by which means a corpse is supposedly brought back to life. Hmmm!!\n\nClose to the Philharmonic is Ye Crack on Rice street. I love this place! This is where John Lennon took Cynthia on their first date and the pub is festooned with some excellent photos and paintings of him. They have a great selection of beers on offer and the locals are a friendly crowd. I also love this place because the bar staff are Evertonians\n\nWhile we are in the Georgian Quarter of Liverpool I must encourage you to visit two great pubs\n\nPeter Kavanagh’s – 2-6 Egerton St, Liverpool L8 7LY\n\nLocated on Back Egerton Street, Peter Kavanagh, the establishment’s namesake and landlord for 53 years, was, in his spare time, a city councillor, an inventor and a still-life painter. His eclectic and eccentric sensibilities have survived, embodied in what must be one of the most intriguing pubs Liverpool has to offer. Just like the interior, the characters are equally as intriguing and no-one is a stranger for longer than 5 minutes. Amongst the decor there’s a row of urns containing the ashes of generations who’d chosen Kavanagh’s as their final resting place, they never forget anyone. Its inhabitants consist of students, professionals and labourers alike who all find solace in a cornerstone of Liverpool’s history and good beer. P.K’s was voted pub of the year in 2019 and richly deserves this accolade. Your life will be richer for visiting this great pub.\n\nTHE CALEDONIA – 22 Caledonia St, Liverpool L7 7DX\n\nKnown as The Cali to its regulars, this boozer truly defines “The People’s Pub”. They call Catherine Street home and always have live music on with a huge concentration on Folk, Roots and Jazz to accompany an extensive range of ales. You will find even the most timid of visitors in the corner tapping their feet to the beat, the more confident person banging their hands against the table and the regular who has miraculously simulated a seemingly regular table spoon into an impromptu contribution to the performance\n\nThere is more to Liverpool than pubs. Liverpool 1 offers shopping fans over 170 shops from High street staples and department stores to upmarket Designer brands. It is right in the middle of the city and is mostly open air. I personally prefer Bold street adjacent to Central station. Famously bohemian, Bold Street has always had an independence and charm unmatched by any other area of the city. But in recent years, it’s the Bold Street restaurants that have got Liverpool talking.\n\nWitnessing somewhat of a food revolution, the gaps between vintage retailers and gift shops on this road has been filled by coffee bars, brunch stops and restaurants, all busy putting a Scouse twist on global cuisines.\n\nThere are Greek, Italian, Indian, Mexican, Lebanese restaurants to name but a few. There are some fantastic independent cafes which are a pleasure to visit.\n\nI love the Vintage shops such as Soho and Pop boutique both of which sell records. My favourite record shop though is Dig Vinyl which is on the first floor of Resurrection, a cool clothes shop. I have picked up some great albums and real bargains at Dig Vinyl.\n\nBold street also offers a gateway to Concert Square which is one of the cities liveliest nightlife spots. Here you’ll find some of the most popular nightlife venues in the city including McCooleys, Modo, Soho, Fusion, Einstein, Coyote Ugly Saloon, Level and Boston Pool Loft. As you can imagine, this area is for younger people! An alley off Concert Square leads to Seel street which has some cool hotels and some decent bars and restaurants.\n\nFor culture buffs there is the Museum of Liverpool on Albert Dock. This is a fantastic place that features both permanent and special exhibits. The museum deals honestly with the part that Liverpool played in the repugnant slave trade as well as celebrating the history of this vibrant city. There is also a Beatles museum on Albert Dock which I have never visited but gets good reviews on Trip advisor. There is also a branch of the Tate gallery on Albert Dock which is high on my to do list.\n\nThere are two magnificent cathedrals at each end of Hope Street. The Anglican cathedral is a Gothic masterpiece while the Catholic cathedral is a modernistic building affectionally known to Scousers as Paddy’s Wigwam!!\n\nJohn Moores University enjoys an excellent reputation in academic circles (I wouldn’t know)\n\nA must do is to take the Ferry across the Mersey. The return journey from Birkenhead is the best as the views of the city skyline and the Liver birds are spectacular. Spoiler alert, you’ll hate the f**k*ng song by the time you get back to dry land!!!\n\nI still want to visit Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields and go for a few beers in Wavertree. I really could write much more. As I scan through this blog I am conscious of the great pubs I have missed, the fantastic statues, the Mersey tunnel. Do yourself a favour and book a few days in Liverpool and check out some of these brilliant places and discover a few of your own. Share them with me and I will visit……. as long as they are not red of course!!!\n\nThe Ultimate Pub crawl!!\n\nMy adult life has been defined by three things; Music, travel and drinking in no particular order.\n\nIn my previous blogs I have concentrated on gigs we’ve attended recently and the cities where they took place. Of course, every city we have visited has resulted in visits to the various hostelries on offer.\n\nThis blog pays homage to some of the best pubs, bars and clubs we have drank (got drunk!) in. Most of the ones I have chosen are because when you visit them you are standing on the shoulders of giants. They may not be your heroes or may not have inspired you but you won’t deny the impact these past patrons have had on our culture. The below photo is from the Winslow Liverpool 4. This pub is directly opposite the main stand of Goodison park, home of my beloved Everton FC. It doesn’t serve the best beer, is murder to get served in but every punter is a fellow Blue………………what more could a man want!! When (if) Everton move to their proposed new stadium at Bramley Dock then, I’m afraid that the Winslow will perish along with the area around Goodison Park which will be a tragedy.\n\nI will start this pub crawl blog in New York City. If you’ve never been to New York then hang your head in shame and book immediately. If you’ve ooh’d and aah’d at Disney or Universal film sets then do yourself a favour and get to Manhattan. Every street, every Diner, every bar will seem familiar. The difference is that they’re real!\n\nWe’ll kick off at McSorley’s Old Alehouse in the East Village. Greenwich Village is The best neighbourhood on earth. Yup, better than Haight Asbury, North Beach, Soho, Camden, Venice Beach……..anywhere you care to name. This is where CBGB’s was, where the Fillmore east was, where Andy Warhol had his Factory, where Bob Dylan was discovered, where the Stonewall pub that inspired the riots still is………………my god, I could go on forever. Anyways, back to McSorleys. This pub on E 7th street opened in 1854. Past patrons include Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S Grant and Teddy Roosevelt. President’s aside, cultural drinkers include Woody Guthrie, Hunter S Thompson and Brendan Beehan. Hell, John Lennon also drank a beer or two here . Today, the floors are still covered in sawdust. They serve two types of beers; Light or Dark. Order a beer and it come s in two glasses. The Gents toilets would make the Philharmonic in Liverpool weep in submission they are so clean. There are many regulars and a few tourists.
