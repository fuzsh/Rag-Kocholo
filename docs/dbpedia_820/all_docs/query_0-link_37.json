        "text": "The AK-47, officially Avtomat Kalashnikova (Russian: Автомат Калашникова, lit. 'Kalashnikov's automatic [rifle]'), is a select-fire, gas-operated 7.62x39mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov. The model spawned the Kalashnikov rifle family of weapon designs, whose members would be adopted by large amounts of countries as their service rifles, becoming one of the most widely used firearms in the world.\n\nThe AK-47 and its variants has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. Multiple Communist Bloc countries manufactured copies of the AK-47 (and the AKM), some of which would go on to spawn derivative rifle families with designs distinct from Soviet/Russian designs. These include:\n\nChina: Type 56 assault rifle\n\nHungary: AKM-63\n\nRomania: PM md. 63\n\nYugoslavia: Zastava M70\n\nNote: This page specifically focuses on 7.62x39mm Soviet/Russian variants of the Kalashnikov rifle, as well as their near-identical copies manufactured by other countries. For 7.62x39mm Kalashnikov variants with distinctive designs used by other countries, please see their respective pages. For later modernized Soviet/Russian Kalashnikov variants, see the AK-74, AK-100 series, and AK-12 pages.\n\nThe AK-47 and variants can be seen in the following films, television series, video games, and anime used by the following actors:\n\nSoviet/Russian Models\n\nAK-46\n\nThe AK-46 (exact designation uncertain) is the common name for an experimental assault rifle by Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov on the basis of a self-loading carbine he developed in 1944, whose design would evolve into the AK-47. The rifle commission rejected this design in the second round of their tests, but Kalashnikov would radically revise his design and create the prototype \"AK-47\".\n\nThe AK-46's design had a certain resemblance to the mechanisms of the M1 Garand, specifically action with a short stroke of the gas piston located above the barrel and a rotating bolt.\n\nThere were three versions of the rifle, each slightly different from each other. The third in particular had a folding buttstock, similar to the later AKS-47.\n\nSpecifications\n\n(Prototyped in 1946)\n\nType: Assault Rifle\n\nCaliber: 7.62x39mm\n\nFeed System: 30-round box magazine\n\nFire Modes: Semi-Auto/Full-Auto\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Kalashnikov Yuriy Borisov Mikhail Kalashnikov №1 prototype 2020\n\nAK-47\n\nThe name AK-47, as used in the English-speaking world, refers to the oldest production variants of Kalashnikov's assault rifle design, before the introduction of the AKM. These production weapons are officially designated as the AK in Soviet sources; the name \"AK-47\" in Russian sources instead only refers Kalashnikov's pre-production prototypes from 1947, which feature some differences from the finalized design. In Soviet sources, the AK-74 and its variants were the first to include the year in its original naming.\n\nThese early production AK variants are divided by western firearm collectors into three distinctive types:\n\nType 1: The first production model, produced from 1948-1951. The Type 1 AK featured an early stamped receiver. It can be distinguished by a raised section of the stamped receiver underneath its charging handle, as well as a slightly differently shaped pistol grip.\n\nType 2: The second production model, produced from 1951-1957. The Type 2 AK featured a milled receiver; while it was intended for the AK to use all stamped parts for cost reasons, the Soviet metalworking industry was simply not ready to do this at the time, and the high rejection rate of the early stamped AK receivers led to a switch to milling that lasted until the introduction of the AKM. It can be distinguished by a metal stock mounting bracket on its buttstock.\n\nType 3: The third production model, produced from 1955-1959. The Type 3 AK is an improved version of the Type 2 AK, and also had a milled receiver. Most milled receiver AKs are derived from the Type 3 design. The Type 3 AK was phased out in 1959 by the improved stamped receiver AKM.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the U.S. government had a ban on all weapons imported from Warsaw Pact nations during the Cold War years (1947-1989). Communist nations which were not part of the Warsaw pact, such as Yugoslavia and Mainland China, were allowed to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S., thus the influx of Chinese AK type rifles and Yugoslavian AKs (Zastava). The Maadi ARMs (the US version of the MISR) were allowed because Egypt was never a Communist country nor a member of the Warsaw Pact. But, as a result of this, virtually no U.S. movie has a real original AK-47 prior to a certain date. The exceptions are, custom build ups after the mid 1990s when original AK-47 rifle kits were available (as was done on We Were Soldiers, using original blueprints and US-made milled receivers), and movies filmed overseas where foreign movie armorers had no such restrictions. This is particularly true for films made in Israel and some parts of Europe.\n\nThis is not the case now, with the current crop of films made outside the U.S., mostly in the newly democratic Eastern European nations (Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Czech Republic, etc.) However, Russia has firmly blocked the export of their old AK-47 surplus guns outside of the country, having distributed most of them to client nations and guerrillas throughout the world in the previous five decades. So the AK-47 one 'thinks' one sees may very well be a Poly Technologies Legend series AK (from China) or another AK Variant.\n\nAs an additional note, early production AKs used the slab sided magazine featured in Kalashnikov's original design, and the ribbed magazine design was introduced later.\n\nSpecifications\n\n(1949 - Present)\n\nType: Assault Rifle\n\nCaliber: 7.62x39mm\n\nWeight: 8.5 lbs (3.9 kg) empty, 10.5 lbs (4.8 kg) loaded\n\nLength: 34.3 in (87 cm)\n\nBarrel length: 16.4 in (41.6 cm)\n\nMuzzle velocity: 2,350 ft/s (715 m/s)\n\nFeed System: 10, 20, 30, 40-round box magazine, 75 or 100-round drum magazine\n\nFire Modes: Semi-Auto/Full-Auto\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Maksim Perepelitsa Soviet Soldiers The first screen appearance of AK 1955 Blue Arrow (Golubaya strela) Yuriy Bogolyubov Sgt.

The AKS may feature any of the three AK-47 receiver types. Very few original Russian versions of this rifle were ever allowed into the U.S. Market. The vast majority of milled receiver underfolders seen in American movies were Chinese Norinco Rifles or Chinese Polytech legend series (which was by far the most accurate Chinese clone of the original AK 47 to date). Original Russian AK (especially the milled versions) were most common in movies and tv shows filmed OUTSIDE of the USA.\n\nSpecifications\n\n(1949 - Present)\n\nType: Assault Rifle\n\nCaliber: 7.62x39mm\n\nWeight: 6.5 lbs (3 kg)\n\nLength: 37 in (94 cm) (stock extended), 27.6 in (70 cm) (stock folded)\n\nBarrel length: 16.3 in (41.5 cm)\n\nFeed System: 30-round box magazine\n\nFire Modes: Semi-Auto/Full-Auto\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Blue Arrow (Golubaya strela) A saboteur 1958 Soldier's Heart (Soldatskoye serdtse) Soviet soldiers 1959 Dr. Mabuse vs. Scotland Yard British police 1963 The Lark (Zhavoronok) Valentins Skulme Frenchman 1964 Objective 500 Million (Objectif: 500 millions) Bruno Cremer Jean Reichau 1966 Etienne Bierry Douard Funeral in Berlin East German Border Guard 1966 Hit Back (Otvetnyy khod) Boris Galkin Capt.

GAMMA AKS-47 2022\n\nAKM\n\nThe AKM is the improved version of the AK-47, featuring a number of refinements such as a stamped receiver (as opposed to the milled receiver of the original Type 2 and Type 3 AK-47), a slant compensator on the tip of the barrel (to reduce recoil), an improved gas tube (without vents), and use of lighter materials to reduce weight and simplify construction.\n\nMost of the AKMs seen in Hollywood movies are actually Egyptian Maadi MISR copies, which were sold in the U.S. as the ARM in the 1980s - such weapons were first procured by Stembridge Gun Rentals for Red Dawn and subsequently re-used in numerous other motion pictures. The Maadi is almost identical to the original Soviet-built AKM, save for the markings, and is nearly impossible to tell apart.\n\nSpecifications\n\n(1959 - Present)\n\nType: Assault Rifle\n\nCaliber: 7.62x39mm\n\nWeight: 7.9 lbs (3.6 kg)\n\nLength: 34.6 in (88 cm)\n\nBarrel length: 16.3 in (41.5 cm)\n\nFeed System: 10, 20, 30, 40-round box magazines, 75 or 100-round drum magazine\n\nFire Modes: Semi-Auto/Full-Auto\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Zhenya, Zhenechka and \"katyusha\" Soviet soldiers 1967 The Shield and the Sword (Shchit i mech) German soldiers Replacement for StG 44 1968 Red Square (Krasnaya ploshchad) Soviet Army infantry on parade Documentary footage 1970 Listen on the Other Side (Daisny tserguudee sonsotsgoo!)

It was introduced in 1958, put into regular service in 1961, and was subsequently replaced by the MPi-KM from 1964.\n\nOne of the features of MPi-K is the absence of a cleaning rod and a socket in the buttstock for a pencil case with accessories, since instead of them a cleaning kit of the Karabiner 98k pattern was used. However, the original AK kit later was considered more effective (in particular, the ramrod could allow knocking out a stuck shell), and was introduced on the subsequent MPi-KM.\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date And Your Love Too East German border guards and soldiers MPi-KmS 1962 I Was Nineteen (Ich war neunzehn) Jaecki Schwarz Lt.

It was introduced in 1961 and entered to regular service from 1964. Early version of the MPi-KM rifle had wooden furniture and was similar to the original AKM, but later models have distinctive stippled brown pistol and top hand grips (from 1965), and buttstocks (from 1966). In 1970 were designed the updated models, introduced into service in 1972, under the designations MPi-KM-72 and MPi-KMS-72. The MPi-KMS-72 also has a side folding single strut \"coat hanger\" stock, a feature which is shared with the later Romanian rifles. It is worth noting that the MPi-KMS-72 was the first version of the new rifle with a folding buttstock, taken into service, the earlier MPi-KMS (similar to the original AKMS) was not adopted.\n\nSince 1984, they have been replaced by the MPi AK-74. After the German reunification, all variants of the MPi were removed from service, with most rifles being sold as surplus to the militaries of such countries as Finland and Turkey.\n\nNote: The chance of seeing a 100% original East German MPi-K series of rifle in a movie or television show is extremely unlikely. Most of the \"East German\" AKs that are seen in visual media are regular AKMs using East German Parts kits.\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Operation Leopard (La légion saute sur Kolwezi) Katanga rebels \"Transitional\" model MPi-KM 1980 23 East German border patrol 1998 Sun Alley East German border guards 1999 Extreme Ops Thug 2002 Hotel Rwanda Rwandan soldiers 2004 Lord of War Afghan mujaheddin 2005 Battle for Haditha Iraqi Army soldiers MPi-KMS-72 2007 The Hurt Locker Iraqi police officer MPi-KMS-72 2008 Carlos Terrorist 2010 Zero Dark Thirty Afghan soldiers 2012 Daylight's End Heather Kafka Earnesta 2016 Wolf Warriors 2 Hans Zhang Zhuo Yifan MPi-KMS-72 2017\n\nTelevision\n\nTitle Actor Character Note / Episode Date Alarm für Cobra 11 - Die Autobahnpolizei Terrorist \"Das Attentat\"; MPi-KMS-72 1997 Alarm für Cobra 11 - Die Autobahnpolizei Bank robber \"Todesfahrt der Linie 834\"; Sturmgewehr AKMS-K carbine 2001 GSG-9 Terrorist Folding Stock 2008 Munich 72 Shredi Jabarin \"Issa\" 2012 Bornholmer Straße Max Hopp Burkhard Schönhammer MPi-KMS-72 2014 Milan Peschel Ulrich Rotermund Robert Gallinowski Michael Krüger\n\nAnime\n\nTitle Character Note Date Spriggan (1998) Turkish General Directorate of Customs Protection soldiers 1998 Schwarzesmarken Sergeant Major Kurt Griebel MPi-KMS-72 2017 Second Lieutenant Katia Waldheim NVA soldiers and East German border guards\n\nRadom-Hunter\n\nThe Radom Hunter is a Polish \"sporterised\" version of the AKM.

Both the European style AKs (like the Romanian AKs or Egyptian Maadis) and the Chinese style of AK rifle (Type 56) can fit into the kit. In the Mid-2000s, KVAR stopped making and selling the AKU-94 conversion kit. All remaining kits were purchased by Century Arms International, and subsequently used to 'spruce up' AK rifles with a futuristic bullpup look. Currently various imported AK rifles (mostly WASRs) with kit installed, is sold by Century Arms International. This bullpup configuration retains the standard barrel length but the design makes the AK rifle more compact making it more suitable for close quarters battle.\n\nSpecifications\n\n( - )\n\nType: Assault Rifle\n\nCaliber: 7.62x39mm\n\nFeed System: 30-round box magazine\n\nFire Modes: Semi-Auto/Full-Auto\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Soldier Kurt Russell Sgt.

The AKMSU was gifted to the National Firearms Centre in 2005 by UK's MOD Pattern Room, who in turn received the weapon in June 1986. The weapon's exact background is unclear, but most authoritative sources today believe that the AKMSU is a one-off custom carbine made outside of the Soviet Union, likely made in the Khyber Pass region of Pakistan.\n\nA false history came to be attributed to the weapon during the weapon's time in the MOD Pattern Room, which described it as a rare prototype carbine intended for Soviet airborne troops, before being found to be inconvenient to use and phased out by the AKS-74U; this history is refuted by the lack of Soviet documentation on a weapon of this configuration, and the fact that the AKMSU uses non-Russian AK components (see below).\n\nThe AKMSU's identity as a custom model is primarily evidenced by its diverse range of components: it features a Type 56 receiver (indicated by the rivet positions at the rear of the receiver), an AKS-74U-like barrel and handguard, an AKMS-style stock, a custom thumbhole foregrip, and a custom muzzle brake containing an expansion chamber, required for cycling.\n\nThe name AKMSU, following the naming pattern set by other Soviet AK variants, is short for \"Автомат Калашникова Mодернизированный Складной Укороченный\", or \"Kalashnikov's shortened modernized assault rifle with a folding stock\". It is unclear how the name was invented, attributed to the weapon, and became its common name; one of the earliest public depictions of the rifle comes from Masami Tokoi's AK-47 & Kalashnikov Variations, who named it \"AKMS Carbine\" rather than \"AKMSU\".\n\nVideo Games\n\nTitle Appears as Mods Notes Date Survarium 2013\n\nConverted AKM Pistol / \"Krinkov\" / \"AKMSU\"\n\nFull-size 7.62x39mm AK variants converted with AKS-74U parts kits exist in recognizable quantities in Hollywood productions, such as Three Kings, Tropic Thunder, Bad Boys II, etc. They are usually nicknamed \"Krinkov\", originally a nickname for the AKS-74U, by the movie production community.\n\nOn IMFDB, such carbines are commonly designated \"AKMSU\", even though they are configured differently from the National Firearms Centre AKMSU, and are not clones or derivatives of it.\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Hard Boiled Philip Kwok Mad Dog 1992 Three Kings Iraqi Republican Guard officer 1999 Training Day Russian mafia hitmen 2001 Ali G Indahouse Gang member 2002 xXx Radek Tomecka Ivan Pedgrag 2002 Czech Police Bad Boys II Haitian gang members and Cuban special forces 2003 Battle Royale II: Requiem Saki Sakurai Wild Seven 2003 A Man Apart Cartel soldier w/ Bulgarian \"waffle\"-style plastic magazine 2003 Tears of the Sun Nigerian militia fighter 2003 Mission: Impossible III Davian's mercernaries 2006 The Kingdom Terrorists 2007 Tropic Thunder Brandon Soo Hoo Tran 2008 Flaming Dragon members The Dark Knight One of Scarecrow's men 2008 Terminator Salvation Human survivor 2009 The Town Jeremy Renner James 'Jem' Coughlin With RIS handguard 2010 The Expendables General Garza's soldiers 2010 Gary Daniels The Brit Sinners and Saints Johnny Strong Detective Riley 2010 Killer Elite Guard 2011 Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol Russian agents KCI quad rail handguard 2011 Contraband Diego Luna Gonzalo KCI quad rail handguard 2011 Largo Winch II Police in Bashkortostan 2011 Red Dawn Chris Hemsworth Jed Eckert 2012 Resident Evil: Damnation Leon S.
