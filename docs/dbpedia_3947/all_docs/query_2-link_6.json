        "text": "With AWS Config, you are charged based on the number of configuration items recorded, the number of active AWS Config rule evaluations, and the number of conformance pack evaluations in your account. A configuration item is a record of the configuration state of a resource in your AWS account. An AWS Config rule evaluation is a compliance state evaluation of a resource by an AWS Config rule in your AWS account. A conformance pack evaluation is the evaluation of a resource by an AWS Config rule within the conformance pack.\n\nAWS Pricing Calculator\n\nCalculate your AWS Config and architecture cost in a single estimate.\n\nCreate your custom estimate now Â»\n\nPricing details for public AWS Regions\n\nPay for only what you use, with no minimums or upfront commitments.\n\nAdditional costs\n\nConfiguration snapshots and configuration history files are delivered to you in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket that you choose, and configuration change notifications are delivered through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). Standard rates for Amazon S3 and Amazon SNS apply. Custom rules are authored using AWS Lambda. Standard rates for Lambda apply.\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, our prices are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT, GST and applicable sales tax. For more information on AWS Config, see the\n\nFAQ.\n\nPricing examples\n\nPricing example 1\n\nYou have the following usage in the US East (N. Virginia) Region in a 24-hour period: 10 configuration items are recorded from each of 100 Amazon EC2 instances for a total of 1000 configuration items.\n\nBelow is the cost of these configuration items if you use continuous recording versus if you use periodic recording.\n\nCost of configuration items under continuous recording\n\n1000 continuous configuration items * $0.003 per continuous configuration item = $3.00\n\nCost of configuration items under periodic recording\n\nUnder continuous recording 10 configuration items were recorded per resource. Under periodic recording, only 1 configuration item per resource is generated per day.\n\n1 periodic configuration item per resource * 100 resources = 100 periodic configuration items\n\n100 periodic configuration items * $0.012 per periodic configuration item = $1.20\n\nPricing example 2\n\nYou have the following usage in the US East (N.Virginia) Region in a given month:\n\n10,000 configuration items recorded across various resource types\n\n50,000 AWS Config rule evaluations in detective mode across all individual AWS Config rules in the account\n\n5 conformance packs, each containing 10 AWS Config rules with 300 rule evaluations per AWS Config rule (that is, 5*10*300 = 15,000 conformance pack evaluations total)\n\nCost of configuration items\n\n10,000 * $0.003 = $30\n\nCost of AWS Config rules\n\nFirst 100,000 evaluations at $0.001 each = 50,000 * $0.001 = $50\n\nCost of conformance packs\n\nFirst 100,000 conformance pack evaluations at $0.001 each = 15,000 * 0.001 =$15\n\nTotal AWS Config bill\n\n$30 + $50 + $15 = $95\n\nPricing example 3\n\nYou have the following usage in the US East (N. Virginia) Region in a given month:\n\n10,000 configuration items recorded across various resource types\n\n50,000 AWS Config rule evaluations in proactive mode only, across all individual AWS Config rules in the account\n\n5 conformance packs, each containing 10 AWS Config rules, with 300 AWS Config rule evaluations per AWS Config rule (that is, 5*10*300 = 15,000 conformance pack evaluations total)\n\nCost of configuration items\n\n10,000 * $0.003 = $30\n\nCost of AWS Config rules\n\nFirst 100,000 evaluations at $0.001 each = 50,000 rule evaluations from rules in proactive mode only * $0.001 = $50\n\nCost of conformance packs\n\nFirst 100,000 conformance pack evaluations at $0.001 each = 15,000 * 0.001 = $15\n\nTotal AWS Config bill\n\n$30 + $50 + $15 = $95"
