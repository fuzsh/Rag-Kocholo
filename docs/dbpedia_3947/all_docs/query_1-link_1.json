        "text": "I normally just close out the payment as \"Other\" and in the notes type in \"Paypal\". Since I don't take checks that \"Other\" payment can only be from a PayPal payment. I have to do it this way cuz I share my in-store merchandise with my online sales. If I didn't close out the transaction there would be no way for my Square to deduct those items from my inventory.\n\nBut I do agree that Square needs to make this a priority payment method. To hell with that tap and pay crap with your phone...I don't know anyone that uses it but I know A LOT of people that use PayPal (myself included).\n\nI have both square and paypal on my website for check out options. Customers can pay with either. However, it would be great to have paypal and square integrated information wise since I pull all of my sale reports from square. I could pull the report via my website, but then my special order invoices through square wouldn't be included. There has to be some sort of third party app that would be able to integrate everything. Business owners don't have time to mess with all of this non-sense. And everyone that has commented about some customers only trusting paypal are right on the money. Some will only check out with Paypal, so I have to have it as a check out option.\n\nYes, I agree with the post just above this, I came here looking for the same reasons, there must be some way to do it all from your WordPress dashboard but I don't have the time to look into it all, perhaps I need one of those numerous Woo extentions, I have no idea. I just want my shop checkout and my invoices (for custom made items) to all have the SAME payment options available.\n\nI'm really happy with Square on my shopping cart because it also has the option of the paypal express just below, although I think they need to make the OR bigger coz some people just assume I only take PayPal Express I think, they don't realise by clicking the 'Proceed to Checkout' button there will be more payment options on the next screen (Square, or bank transfer, or normal PayPal).\n\nAnyway it's the year 2018, people have been having these issues for decades now with online/mobile payments, I'm getting sick of waiting!\n\nWe might not have ever got those awesome hoverboards we all hoped for but can we at least work towards sorting out this payment mess somehow through all our fancy advances in tech we are so proud of?"
