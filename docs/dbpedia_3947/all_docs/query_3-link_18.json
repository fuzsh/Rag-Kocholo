        "text": "This advanced facility is the result of a joint venture with the Mahansaria Group, with the two companies combining their expertise to bring Mitas tire engineering into the two-wheeler tire market. Both companies have been working throughout the challenges of the last two years, to test and produce tires, ready to deliver to motorcycle enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nDuring the official opening event, Paolo Pompei, President of Trelleborg Wheel Systems, shared his enthusiasm and vision for the future of Mitas tires, stating: “On behalf of everyone at Trelleborg Wheel Systems, I am honored to have seen the first of many Mitas two-wheeler tires come off the production line at this state-of-the-art facility. Developed alongside our strategic joint venture partner, Mahansaria Group, who bring over 30 years of experience in leading successful businesses for off-highway tires. This facility will further reinforce the Mitas brand in the high-performance market and expand our global presence. It is a great achievement by all involved, and we are happy to write a new chapter in the history of our Mitas brand as we look forward to continued joint success.”\n\nYogesh Mahansaria added: “At Mahansaria Group, it is our pleasure to embark on a long and exciting journey with Trelleborg Wheel Systems and support them in building and bolstering Mitas's position as a formidable global brand. This state-of-the-art manufacturing facility is a convergence of our \"tough and rugged\" DNA, having built leading global brands in the Off-Highway Tire industry over 3 decades, and Mitas's technological expertise in the world of two wheels. It also marks our group's foray into the ever-evolving Indian performance two-wheeler tire market. We are very excited about this partnership with Trelleborg Wheel Systems and look forward to an exciting journey ahead.”\n\nDownload the press release in PDF"
