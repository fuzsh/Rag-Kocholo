        "text": "Post by timmy84 on\n\nHow could the producers of Dreamgirls NOT say that the movie isn't at least loosely based on the Supremes and Motown Records is beyond me because the spoilers in the movie tell you that it is paying a tribute to Motown:\n\nHere, I'll list some similarities between the Supremes and the Dreams and Motown and Rainbow and the characters around it:\n\n*The story of the Dreams starts in Detroit, Michigan; the story of the Supremes starts in Detroit, Michigan\n\n*In one of the sneak peeks I saw, the Dreams and another girl group (a four member group) are rivals; the Supremes and Marvelettes (a four-member group for much of its early duration) were rivals.\n\n*The Dreams start out as the Dreamettes; the Supremes started out as the Primettes.\n\n*Curtis Taylor, Jr. is a music impresario; Berry Gordy, Jr. is/was a music impresario.\n\n*Of course Effie White is the lead singer of the Dreamettes/Dreams; Florence Ballard was the lead singer of the Primettes/Supremes.\n\n*The Dreamettes back up James \"Thunder\" Early; the Supremes and Martha & the Vandellas backed up Marvin Gaye. James Early is a combo of Marvin, Jackie Wilson and James Brown.\n\n*Rainbow Records becomes a popular music label in the '60s and '70s; Motown Records became a popular music label in the '60s and '70s.\n\n*Curtis replaces Effie as lead singer of the Dreams and puts Deena Jones in front and falls in love with her also; Berry replaced Florence as lead singer of the Supremes and put Diana Ross in front and Berry & Diane start a relationship.\n\n*Lorrell Robinson dates James Early; Mary Wilson dated \"Duke\" of the Four Tops.\n\n*Effie is eventually replaced by Curtis from the Dreams after \"showing off\"; much the same reason Flo got cast aside.\n\n*Effie finds herself on welfare and an alcoholic; Flo found herself on welfare and an alcoholic.\n\n*Jimmy Early tries in vain to break from his pop image cultivated by Curtis and presents Curtis with a socially conscious song, Curtis turns it down; Marvin Gaye broke away from his pop image cultivated by Berry and presents Berry with a socially conscious song, Berry turns it down; the only difference is Marvin got through to release that song: \"What's Going On\"; James' \"Patience\" never gets a release.\n\n*C.C. White, Effie's brother, is like a Lamont Dozier type of writer/producer.\n\n*Rainbow Records hosts a televised anniversary celebration; Motown hosted a televised anniversary celebration.\n\n*James Early, breaking away from his pop image goes into a funk number and drops his pants; Marvin Gaye dropped his pants during a performance during HIS funk number but it was not on Motown 25.\n\n*James Early is addicted to drugs; so was Marvin; the only difference afterwards is James DIES of a drug overdose; Marvin, well we know what happened.\n\n*Deena Jones eventually breaks away from Curtis' control and leaves him to follow her dreams of movie stardom; Diana Ross eventually broke away from Berry's control and left him to have more control of her career; much like Deena, Diana also finds movie stardom.\n\n*Deena Jones take several modeling shots that will remind you of Diana Ross in \"Mahogany\".\n\n*Effie (with C.C. and Marty and some lawyers) sues Curtis for payola after Curtis produces a disco version of her breakthrough solo single \"One Night Only\"; Florence sued Berry for undue royalties.\n\n----\n\nThe only differences here from the movie and their inspirations was that Florence Ballard never had the chance to experience that breakthrough solo stardom that Effie White finally won, Diana and Florence never had a one-to-one talk following the 1967 split like Deena and Effie did and unfortunately there wasn't a reunion performance with Florence, Diana, Mary and Cindy as it was with Effie, Deena, Lorrell and Michelle.\n\nOther than that, it was definitely loosely based on the Supremes and Motown Records regardless of how either the play or movie folks think.\n\nPost by antceleb12 on\n\nOK, another forum, there was discussion about Dreamgirls. Part of one of my posts was the following:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"a lot of people were expecting [Deena] to be more egotistical, like Diana Ross, which was not the case at ALL in the movie. She sympathized with Effie much more than Ross would have with Ballard\"\n\nAnother person's response:\n\n\"I don't know what connections anyone has to Florence or Diana to make such a claim, but unless one was in the mix, how does one have the requisite knowledge to characterize the amount of sympathy Diana Ross had for Florence Ballard? Statements such as these are incredibly unfair and perpetuate unverified accounts that neither of the principles - Ross or Ballard - have commented upon.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI really can't make sense out of this. I think he's trying to say that its unfair to say Ross treated Flo badly. If that is the case, would it be unfair to say that Diane made Flo's life a living you-know-wut? I mean surely these things don't just get made up from thin air, so where does it start then? On the other hand, if Mary Wilson had fabricated everything about Flo and Diane and what went on backstage, why hasn't Mary been called upon, like James Frey with his book, A Million Little Pieces.\n\nIt's just really shocking that someone today can deny that those two were perfect friends and nothing went on.\n\nYea thats true, which is exactly why she started drinking, got angry at the two, got fired and then died. Yep - cuz thats what perfect friends do...And also to think that this person can deny that Deena and Effie were at least SOMEWHAT written around Flo and Diane...?\n\nPost by rainymourning on\n\nantceleb12 said:\n\nOK, another forum, there was discussion about Dreamgirls.

If Diana was truly a good friend she would have looked out for Florence when the internal problems began to arise - not after she was removed from the group. Just my opinion yet again.\n\nPost by antceleb12 on\n\nNot to partake in the \"buzz\" lol but the movie, in my opinion was AMAZING! Now others say, its just razzle-dazzle, fell short of plot, Jen was the only good thing, blah-di-blah...I thought it was ALL WONDERFUL!\n\nWith Jen Hudson, you knew she wasn't gonna sit for no BS. So everytime Effie was being used or mistreated, or something wrong was going on with her, it was like \"uh-uh, girlfriend. somebody's gonna get smacked!\" haha!\n\nBut all joking aside, I think even if you look at it in all different point-of-views, Jennifer really blew Dreamgirls out of the water. I've read that many people are favoring Jen Holiday's version of And I Am Telling You over Hudson's. My theory is if you let favoritism get in the way of a performance, chances are you're not gonna like the non-original as much. Well for And I Am Telling You, don't play favorites!! If you want to get the wind knocked out of you by Hudson's performance, honey, you WILL! lol - Both versions are equally outstanding, but you cannot compare raw talent and emotion the way Jen and Jen have done!\n\nAnywho, DreamGirls was a show I am proud to say that it is my all-time favorite Bway-Bigscreen film! Actually, its probly my favorite movie ever.\n\nWhy is that? Three words\n\nSoul, emotion, and power"
