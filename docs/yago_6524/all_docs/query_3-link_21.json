        "text": "Twenty-five years after first bringing Broadway audiences to their feet, the Tony Award-winning musical sensation \"Dreamgirls\" comes to the big screen starring Academy Award® winner Jamie Foxx (\"Ray\"), Beyoncé Knowles (\"Austin Powers in Goldmember\"), Eddie Murphy (\"The Nutty Professor,\" \"Dr. Dolittle\"), Danny Glover (\"Lethal Weapon\"), Jennifer Hudson (\"American Idol\"), and Tony Award winner Anika Noni Rose (Broadway's \"Caroline or Change\").\n\nSet in the turbulent late 1960s and early ‘70s, \"Dreamgirls\" follows the rise of a trio of women—Effie, Deena (Beyoncé Knowles) and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose)—who have formed a promising girl group called The Dreamettes. At a talent competition, they are discovered by an ambitious manager named Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), who offers them the opportunity of a lifetime: to become the back-up singers for headliner James \"Thunder\" Early (Eddie Murphy). Curtis gradually takes control of the girls' look and sound, eventually giving them their own shot in the spotlight as The Dreams. That spotlight, however, begins to narrow in on Deena, finally pushing the less attractive Effie out altogether. Though the Dreams become a crossover phenomenon, they soon realize that the cost of fame and fortune may be higher than they ever imagined.\n\nMOVIE REVIEW\n\nI just watched Dreamgirls, the Best Musical or Comedy of the Year according to the Golden Globes. The movie, starring Beyonce Knowles and Jamie Foxx, has skyrocketed \"American Idol\" non-winner Jennifer Hudson to stardom (and an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) and earned Eddie Murphy an Oscar nomination as well. There was a lot of fuss when Dreamgirls didn't make the cut as a Best Picture nominee at the Academy Awards, or when it didn't win Best Song, but it is clear why neither events happened..."
