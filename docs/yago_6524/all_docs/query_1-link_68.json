        "text": "In addition toÂ Ann WilsonÂ andÂ Nancy WilsonÂ ofÂ Heart,Â there are a host ofÂ WilsonsÂ who have made popular music over the years. Â The Beach BoysÂ â âAmericaâs bandâ according to no less thanÂ President Ronald ReaganÂ (whose middle name isÂ Wilson, come to think of it)Â â was founded inÂ 1961Â byÂ Brian Wilson, his brothersÂ Dennis WilsonÂ andÂ Carl Wilson, and their cousinÂ Mike Love;Â Al JardineÂ was the one original bandmember not in the family.Â AnotherÂ Nancy WilsonÂ is a top-notchÂ jazz vocalist who started in theÂ 1960.âsÂ and frequently crossed over to the R&B and rock charts. Â Mary WilsonÂ was one of the founding members ofÂ the Supremes;Â the story of the other bandmembers being eclipsed by lead singerÂ Diana RossÂ formed the main storyline for theÂ BroadwayÂ musicalÂ DreamgirlsÂ that later madeÂ Jennifer HudsonÂ a star in the film version,Â Dreamgirls.Â Then there are R&B singersÂ Jackie WilsonÂ andÂ Wilson Pickett, country starÂ Gretchen Wilson, comedian and chefÂ Justin Wilson, and many others.Â\n\nÂ\n\n(November 2013)\n\nÂ\n\n* Â Â Â * Â Â Â *\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nThe saga ofÂ the SupremesÂ formed much of the story line for the hit musicalÂ Dreamgirls. Â The musical opened onÂ BroadwayÂ inÂ 1981Â and won 6Â Tony Awards. Â Twenty-five years later, inÂ 2006,Â DreamgirlsÂ was made into a popular film starringÂ Jamie Foxx,Â BeyoncÃ© Knowles,Â Eddie Murphy, and (fresh from finishing as a finalist onÂ American Idol)Â Jennifer Hudson. Â At $80 million,Â DreamgirlsÂ is the most expensive film ever to feature an allâAfrican-American starring cast. Â\n\nÂ\n\nDreamgirlsÂ created drama at theÂ OscarsÂ that year to match what was being portrayed on the screen. Â Despite not being nominated forÂ Best DirectorÂ orÂ Best PictureÂ (or any nominations forÂ Best ActorÂ orÂ Best ActressÂ either, for that matter),Â DreamgirlsÂ had the mostÂ Academy AwardÂ nominations inÂ 2007Â with eight â a first at theÂ Academy Awards. Â In a rare feat for an actor in a debut role,Â Jennifer HudsonÂ was namedÂ Best Supporting Actress, butÂ Eddie Murphyâs loss toÂ Alan ArkinÂ (for his role in the quirky and delightful comedyÂ Little Miss Sunshine) asÂ Best Supporting ActorÂ was regarded as an upset. Â Three of the songs fromÂ DreamgirlsÂ were nominated forÂ Best Song, but they also lost out to theÂ Melissa EtheridgeÂ song âI Need to Wake Upâ from theÂ Al GoreÂ documentary film,Â An Inconvenient Truth. Â\n\nÂ\n\nIt was a different story at theÂ Golden Globes, where bothÂ Jennifer HudsonÂ andÂ Eddie MurphyÂ won in their categories, andÂ DreamgirlsÂ tookÂ the award forÂ Best Picture â Comedy or Musical;Â BeyoncÃ© KnowlesÂ was also nominated forÂ Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Â\n\nÂ\n\nIf you ask me, the insistence on having only one category of film or performer is a major flaw at theÂ Academy Awards, and the recent decision to multiply the nominations forÂ Best PictureÂ to 10 or 12 only highlights the problem. Â TheÂ Golden GlobesÂ is a more enjoyable television experience than theÂ OscarsÂ nearly every year; eachÂ Golden GlobeÂ actually means something, in contrast to the parade of technical awardsÂ that almost no one cares about that composes the middle two-thirds of theÂ Academy AwardsÂ show.Â\n\nÂ\n\n(April 2015/1)\n\nÂ"
