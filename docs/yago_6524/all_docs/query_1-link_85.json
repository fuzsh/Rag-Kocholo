        "text": "Dreamgirls is a 2006 film about a trio of black female soul singers who cross over to the pop charts in the early 1960s, facing their own personal struggles along the way.\n\nDirected and written by Bill Condon, adapted from the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name by Henry Krieger and Tom Eyen.\n\nFame comes and goes, starts rise and fall, but dreams live forever.taglines\n\nEffie White\n\n[edit]\n\n[singing] And I am telling you\n\nI'm not going\n\nYou're the best man I'll ever know\n\nThere's no way I could ever go\n\nno, no, there's no way\n\nNo, no, no, no way\n\nI'm living without you\n\nI'm stayin', I'm stayin'\n\nAnd you, and you...you're gonna love me.\n\nThat's right Curtis. You stopped me once, but you'll never stop me again. [sings] 'Cause this time, Effie White's gonna win!\n\nCurtis Taylor, Jr.\n\n[edit]\n\nDeena, you know why I chose you to sing lead? Because your voice... has no personality. No depth. Except for what I put in there.\n\nLorrell Robinson\n\n[edit]\n\n[singing] And Lorrell loves Jimmy\n\nLorrell loves Jimmy\n\nLorrell loves Jimmy, it's true\n\nBut Lorrell and Jimmy are through\n\nThe Dreams\n\n[edit]\n\n[singing] Ev'ry man has his own special dream\n\nAnd that dream is just about to come true\n\nLife's not as bad as it may seem\n\nIf you open your eyes towards in front of you.\n\n[singing] We're your Dreamgirls, boy, we'll make you happy... Yeah!\n\nWe're your Dreamgirls, boy, we'll always care\n\nWe're your Dreamgirls, Dreamgirls will never leave you... No, no!\n\nAnd all you got to do is dream\n\nBaby, we'll be there.\n\nJames \"Thunder\" Early\n\n[edit]\n\nHey, I got soul! You can't kill a man with soul!\n\nI can't do it no more. I can't sing no more sad songs.\n\nJimmy want a rib, Jimmy want a steak, Jimmy want a piece of your chocolate cake!\n\nMarty Madison\n\n[edit]\n\n[Referring to a club in Florida where Curtis has booked the Dreamettes] That place is so white they will not even hire us to wash dishes!\n\nEffie, it is time for you to perform. For the past four months I have been your food, your rent, your support network.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nEffie White: Tell me something, Curtis. Do you think it's right to promote an amateur performer over a professional?\n\nCurtis Taylor Jr.: I'm not sure what this is about...\n\nEffie White: It's about fairness, Curtis. It's about people paying their dues. Isn't that what you keep telling me? \"Get in line, Effie. Wait your turn\". So why am I sitting here without so much as a B-side on a 45, when an amateur like Martin Luther King Jr. gets his own freaking album? I mean, can he even sing?\n\nM.C.: And now, the courageous, the curvaceous, Creamettes!\n\nDeena Jones: It's the Dreamettes! The Dreamettes!\n\nCurtis Taylor, Jr.: $500 says the Dreamettes do not win.\n\n[Contest judge takes money]\n\nContest judge: Thanks a lot man, because they were going to lose anyway!\n\nEffie White: So... Deena's going to sing the lead 'cause you like the way she looks? Am I ugly to you, Curtis?\n\nCurtis Taylor Jr.: Baby, come on! You know how I feel about you, come on. Don't make it personal.\n\nEffie White: Well, what am I supposed to do? Deena's beautiful, and she's always been beautiful... but I've got the voice, Curtis! I've got the voice! You can't put me in back; you just can't!\n\nMae Jones: I'm amazed, Mr, Taylor. As much as I love my daughter, I never thought she had much of a voice.\n\nCurtis Taylor, Jr.: Oh, Deena has something better. She has a... quality.\n\nMae Jones: You make her sound like a product.\n\nCurtis Taylor, Jr.: \"A product.\" I like that!\n\nCurtis Taylor Jr.: Who was the first artist to sing \"Hound Dog\"?\n\nC.C. White: Elvis Presley.\n\nCurtis Taylor Jr.: Big Mama Thorton. She had the number-one single on the R&B charts, but the white stations wouldn't play it, because to them it was just another race record.\n\nC.C. White: Isn't music supposed to express what people are feeling?\n\nCurtis Taylor Jr.: Music is supposed to sell.\n\nEffie White: [about Deena] She ain't better than anybody. She ain't nothin' but common!\n\nDeena Jones: Now who you callin' common, you self-indulgent, self-absorbed, non-professional?\n\nEffie White: You! I'm callin' you! I'm callin' you the common piece he's knockin' off!\n\nDeena Jones: Now you listen to me, Miss Blame-It-On-The-World, see, I put up with you for much too long. I have put up with your bitchin', I put up with your naggin', and all your screamin' too!\n\nLorrell Robinson: Now when are you two gonna stop all this fighting?\n\nEffie White: Stay out of this, Lorrell! This is between Deena and me!\n\nLorrell Robinson: Yeah? Well, it's between me too! I'm a part of this group as anybody else! And I'm tired! Effie, I'm tired of all the problems you're makin' us!\n\nEffie White: I always knew you two were together.\n\nLorrell Robinson: What?!\n\nEffie White: I always knew you two were gangin' up on me!\n\nDeena Jones: She had nothing to do with this change. It was you! You always thinkin' of you! Always thinkin' of you!\n\nCurtis Taylor, Jr.: I knew you were trouble from the start.\n\nEffie White: Trouble?!\n\nCurtis Taylor, Jr.: You were real bad trouble from the start.\n\nEffie White: Curtis, I'm your woman!\n\nCurtis Taylor, Jr.: But you're gettin' out now. I'm not building this group to have you tear it apart! Go head and rant and scream and shout! Don't worry, baby, I'll buy you out.\n\nEffie White: There's no money dirty enough to buy me out. You remember that, Curtis!\n\nC.C. White: Effie, Curtis was supposed to...\n\nEffie White: Love me. Curtis was supposed to love me.\n\nMagic White: Momma, why are you so slow?\n\nEffie White: Because I'm old.\n\nC.C. White: Lay off, Effie. Just take the money and run.\n\nEffie White: You in this with them, C.C.?\n\nC.C. White: Cool it, Effie. This time you know what you've done.\n\nEffie White: So they bought your black ass too, huh?\n\nC.C. White: I said, cool it, Effie. This time you've gone too far.\n\nEffie White: Oh, I can go further! I can go further!\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nFame comes and goes, starts rise and fall, but dreams live forever.\n\nAll you have to do is dream.\n\nOne dream will change everything.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJennifer Hudson - Effie White\n\nJamie Foxx - Curtis Taylor, Jr.\n\nBeyonce Knowles - Deena Jones\n\nEddie Murphy || James \"Thunder\" Early\n\nDanny Glover - Marty Madison\n\nAnika Noni Rose - Lorrell Robinson\n\nKeith Robinson - Clarence Conrad (C.C.)
