        "text": "At the recent New York press junket for \"Chicago,\" Condon told Playbill On Line, \"I think that Dreamgirls is a great movie waiting to happen. There aren't that many [musicals] that can really work [on film]. There's one that can work that will never, ever — no one would ever, ever finance — and that's Side Show. It's hard enough to get Phantom made into a movie, but an 80-performance flop is not going be on the top of anyone's [list]. That would make a good movie, you know.\" Condon also said that he doesn't feel that the pop operas would work well as films, although he is interested in several Stephen Sondheim musicals. \"I think a couple of Sondheim shows, Follies and Sweeney Todd, are both ones that would be interesting to try. I'm not sure, but they'd be interesting to try to treat them as movies, but I think that Dreamgirls is the great obvious one.\"\n\nCondon's next film, however, will be a non-musical one. He has written the screenplay and will direct a feature film about the life of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. Liam Neeson will star as the researcher whose 1948 study of male sexuality shocked the world. Laura Linney will play his wife, and Ian McKellen and Chris O'Donnell are also scheduled to be a part of the cast. Condon's other film credits include the award-winning \"Gods and Monsters\" as well as \"Strange Behavior\" and \"Strange Invaders.\""
