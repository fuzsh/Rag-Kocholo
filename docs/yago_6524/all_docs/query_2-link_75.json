        "text": "Chicago was adapted for the screen by Bill Condon\n\nBill Condon has the weirdest resume in Hollywood. Prior to writing Chicago, he was predominantly known as a writer and a director. He wrote and directed the critically acclaimed Gods and Monsters (1998) starring Sir Ian McKellan and Brenden Fraser (that's Sir George of the Jungle to you). After writing Chicago (which he did not direct) he went on to write/direct Queen Bey's Dreamgirls (2006) and reunited with Ian McKellan in Mr. Holmes (2015).\n\nHowever, there are also weird spots on there. Condon directed the sequel to Candyman, subtitled Farewell to the Flesh in 1995, and the two biggest spectacles of 2011 and 2012, which might be horror depending on your point of view: Twilight: Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2. Edward may have sparkled but we didn't see any jazz handsâ€¦ so we don't know what all these movies have in common."
