        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nThe long-mooted new screen take on classic musical Guys & Dolls gets the director of Dreamgirls to give it a helping hand.\n\nFilmmaker Bill Condon has got some form when it comes to movie musicals, courtesy of the hugely successful Dreamgirls that he directed and penned. He also co-wrote The Greatest Showman, and penned the script for the Oscar-winning Chicago movie.\n\nWhich all makes him a logical choice to bring Guys & Dolls back to the big screen. Previously filmed with Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons all the way back in 1955, there’s been talk of a big screen redo for some time now. The film has been set up at the Sony-owned TriStar Pictures, and whilst no production dates are known as of yet – nor any casting details – there’s a good chance that this’ll now be Condon’s next project.\n\nMore news as we hear it…\n\nTHR\n\n—\n\nThank you for visiting!
