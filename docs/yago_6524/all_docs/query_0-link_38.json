I have to give credit to the director, Bill Condon, for expanding the musical format to an almost operatic scale, where ordinary dialogue is not spoken but sung. It's ambitious.\n\nThe movie runs a little over 2 hours but somehow feels very long. It needs editing. Any side story involving Beyonce should have been cut. It's a sleepy movie unless Jennifer Hudson or Eddie Murphy are on screen. Hudson is wonderful. What a voice! And she embodies her character to a T. Eddie Murphy was better than I've seen him in a long time. Both of them were quite moving.\n\nThe music is great, but there's just too much of it. I think they could have cut several songs.\n\nAt any rate, I recommend the film, if you like musicals, and do try to see it in the theater. It's a larger than life movie.\n\nReading is freedom.\n\nThe mind soars, no earthly cares,\n\nno limitations.\n\nA Maggers Haiku, 2005\n\nYears ago my mother used to say to me... \"In this world, Elwood, you can be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.\"\n\nWell, for years I was smart.\n\nI recommend pleasant.\n\nYou may quote me.\n\nElwood P.

I liked the story more than the music. This is one of those movies that no one would go see with me, so I braved it alone. Eddie Murphy just might take the Oscar. His performance reminded me of Richard Pryor's in that Billie Holliday movie with Diana Ross. And I can see Jennifer Hudson thumbing her nose at the American Idol voters. Good for her.\n\nAC"
