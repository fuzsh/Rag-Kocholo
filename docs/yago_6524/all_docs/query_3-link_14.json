        "text": "Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx) is a car salesman aching to make his mark in the music business – to form his own record label and get its sound heard on mainstream radio at a time when civil rights are still only a whisper in the streets. He just needs the angle, the right talent, the right product to sell.\n\nLate for their stint in a local talent show, The Dreamettes –Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), and lead singer Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) - show up in their cheap wigs and homemade dresses, rehearsing songs and steps by Effie’s brother, C.C. (Keith Robinson), with hopes that talent and sheer desire will break them out of the only life that seems available to them. They’re young, beautiful and just what Curtis is looking for. All they have to do is trust him.\n\nJames “Thunder” Early (Eddie Murphy) is a pioneer of the new Detroit sound, spellbinding audiences all along the “Chitlin’ Circuit” with his electrifying blend of soul and rock ‘n’ roll. Curtis finesses The Dreamettes a gig singing backup for Early, and suddenly, for all of them, the gulf between what they want and what they can have draws closer for the first time.\n\nCurtis launches the girls as a solo act, rechristening them The Dreams, knowing in his gut that success lies not with the soulful voice of Effie, but with the demure beauty and malleable style of Deena –despite their history… and Curtis’ promises. Deena is ready to step into the spotlight, even as Effie fades away.\n\nSmash\n\n\"Smash\" is a musical drama that celebrates the beauty and heartbreak of the Broadway theater as it follows a cross-section of dreamers and schemers who all have one common desire—to be a smash.\n\nView\n\nCats\n\nOscar-winning director Tom Hooper transforms Andrew Lloyd Webber’s record-shattering stage musical \"Cats\" into a breakthrough cinematic event. In theaters December 20, 2019.\n\nView\n\nWest Side Story\n\nA host of talented actors, singers and dancers join director Steven Spielberg and his crew in bringing a new adaptation of the original, beloved stage musical \"West Side Story\" to the screen for a new time and generation.\n\nView"
