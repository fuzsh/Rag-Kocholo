        "text": "Disconnect yourself from the story, which follows the basic rise-and-fall lifeline of every musician biopic ever, and youâ€™ll at least be able to enjoy several good songs and a [good] performance by Eddie Murphy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Mar 8, 2024\n\nIt has taken 25 years for Michael Bennett's Dreamgirls to go from Broadway to the big screen. The delay can be forgiven, however, because the film rocks on all levels.\n\nFull Review | May 19, 2020\n\nVery much rooted in its disco-era decadence, but it is always fiercely, vibrantly fresh\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jun 6, 2019\n\nWhile Dreamgirls has many fantastic attributes -- brilliant musical numbers, top performances, and some amazing camerawork and editing -- it doesn't quite gel, ensuring that this musical never moves from being a good film to a supreme one.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Nov 3, 2018\n\nThis film could earn eight Oscar nominations. It's so much fun. Let's go see a movie where you smile, and cheer ... and tap your feet a little, too.\n\nFull Review | Jan 5, 2018\n\nThe energy is so high in sequences like this -- and there are lots of them -- that it almost doesn't matter that we've seen this story before, in Ray and other film biographies about the \"heartbreak\" of musical stardom.\n\nFull Review | Jul 6, 2010\n\nIt compares to that other \"legitimate\" musical smash of recent vintage, Chicago. It just doesn't have the life or fun of Chicago.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | May 13, 2009\n\nDreamgirls opened on Xmas day and it was every much of a brilliant holiday movie. I guess the only complaint I have is it is too slick.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A- | Jul 22, 2007\n\nThere's a joy on screen -- a love for the material that's palpable and contagious -- but the material, in the end, lets them down.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jul 14, 2007\n\nYou may not be expecting this from a musical, but Dreamgirls is one of the most fast-paced, frenetically-edited, roller-coaster rides of a movie that you'll see all year.\n\nFull Review | Mar 24, 2007"
