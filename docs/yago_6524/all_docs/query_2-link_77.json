        "text": "Bill Condon has just seen the live-action Beauty And The Beast he directed for Disney turn into a box office behemoth. Now, as Universal continues to build out its updated, connected monster movie universe, Condon is in talks to make The Bride Of Frankenstein.\n\nOne of Condon's favourite movies, the original Bride featured Elsa Lanchester and Boris Karloff in the story of how Dr. Frankenstein, goaded by a fellow scientist, created a mate for his famous monster.\n\nJames Whale directed the film in 1935, and it was Oscar nominated. Aside from his love of the movie, Condon has another connection to it â€“ his film Gods And Monsters, which explored the waning days of Whale's life (played in the drama by Ian McKellen) and scored an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for Condon.\n\nJurassic Park's David Koepp has written the script for the new film, which according to Deadline, will have a feminist angle. Universal has been after Angelina Jolie to star in (and, at one point, direct) the movie, but there's no word on whether she's still even a possibility.\n\nThe first film in the new planned batch of monster movies, The Mummy, lands on 9 June.\n\nEmpire Essay: The Bride Of Frankenstein\n\nBride Of Frankenstein Resurrected"
