        "text": "On Dec. 1, Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé will open in thousands of theaters nationwide, capturing the era-defining artist at the peak of her creative powers. The movie, which was shot during her sold-out Renaissance tour, is tracking for a domestic opening in the $17 million to $23 million range.\n\nBut this isn’t Beyoncé’s first foray into film. The pop star made her feature debut in 2001 starring opposite Mekhi Phifer in Robert Townsend’s Carmen: A Hip Hopera, playing the man-eating actress Carmen. A year later, she tried her hand at comedy in Austin Powers in Goldmember, playing Austin’s sidekick Foxxy Cleopatra. But it was Dreamgirls that cemented Beyoncé’s reputation as a big-screen star. The DreamWorks adaptation of 1981’s Tony-winning Broadway musical traces the history of a Motown supergroup called the Dreamettes, not-so-loosely modeled on The Supremes. Beyoncé portrays the group’s shy but steely frontwoman Deanna Jones, inspired by Diana Ross. Director Bill Condon originally intended to cast all unknowns as the three Dreamettes. But Knowles furiously lobbied for the part, and, after a successful screen test, she won it. Says Condon: “One of the great pleasures of making Dreamgirls was being able to capture Beyoncé and her brilliance in a moment in time — even if it’s one that represents just a sliver of her vast artistic life.”\n\nFor the role of Effie — which propelled Jennifer Holliday to Broadway superstardom — Condon insisted on casting an unknown. In the end, 783 women auditioned for Effie, including American Idol alumni Fantasia Barrino and Jennifer Hudson, Disney star Raven-Symoné and Community star Yvette Nicole Brown (who ended up in a smaller role). Hudson, of course, landed the part — and an Oscar in the process. (Eddie Murphy also earned a nom for playing James “Thunder” Early but lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine. According to press reports, Murphy stormed out of the ceremony after Arkin’s name was announced.)\n\nTHR’s review praised Hudson and Beyoncé, saying, “The sensation here is Hudson … Meanwhile [Beyoncé] Knowles shows more flair than her character is supposed to have.”"
