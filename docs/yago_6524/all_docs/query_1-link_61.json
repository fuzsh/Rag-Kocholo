(jamie foxx, in a role that ok, tho' he was no great shakes), cadillac dealer/up & coming record producer - he sees them, and likes what he hears...\n\nhe hires them to sing back up for eddie murphy (james \"thunder\" early) - who does all of his own singing, and i was so pleased to see him actually \"acting\" that i wasn't quite sure he could pull it off...\n\nit's wonderful to know that this man has actual talent - away from those mind-candy comedies on which he has based his career...he delves deep into the rise and fall of and soul/r&b singer trying to make something better of himself and go for a different sound from whence he started...\n\nthru out the film, i waited w/great anticipation for jennifer hudson to tackle the song, and i'm telling you, i'm not going made famous by another jennifer (holiday)...her rendition was simply incredible...she hit every note and then some...as i sat in packed theatre, people began to applaud her mid-song, and i got chills just listening to and feeling the pain in which she belted out the song...\n\nas the movie continued on w/the letting go of effie and watching her struggle to survie w/her child (illegimate daughter), i found myself rooting for her and becoming less impressed w/beyonce...i like her, but i just wrap my brain around her acting skills...maybe it's me, i don't know - but i felt she was nothing to write home about..\n\non the other hand - eddie murphy completely surprized me...\n\nall in all, i thought it a really wonderful movie..."
