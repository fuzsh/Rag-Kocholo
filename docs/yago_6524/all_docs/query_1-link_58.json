        "text": "Dreamgirls tells the story of three female, African-American singers, Deena, Effie, and Lorrell struggling to make a name for themselves. The girls form a music group called the Dreamettes. The Dreamettes are discovered by Curtis Taylor Jr., who asks them to sing backup for Jimmy Early. They accept and eventually make their way to the spotlight. The group is torn apart when Deena is chosen as the lead singer, instead of Effie, who has the stronger voice. The movie/musical, Dreamgirls, has an overall negative impact on the portrayal of women. One way that women are portrayed is as an accessory. One example is Lorrell, the singer in the shadow of Effie and Deena, who gets involved with Jimmy Early. Jimmy is already taken when the two meet, yet she falls completely in love with him. She attempts to stand up her for herself and leave, but the relationship continues after he charms her. After an eight year relationship, Lorrell leaves Jimmy. The heartbreak causes Jimmy to overdose and die. The idea that Lorrell cannot survive without Jimmy is the idea put into our heads. We see her as dependent on and attached to a man. Another way that the movie degrades women is with the impression that good looks dominate success. Deena is the most attractive of the group, causing her to get the lead in the group. Effie is upset because she knows that she has the best voice. The main reason for Deena replacing Effie as lead singer was her skinny body, fair skin, and attractiveness. Effie feels unappreciated and gets dismissed from the group.\n\nDreamgirls shows the struggle that women face when trying to succeed and create their own destiny. The movie depicts Effie as a stereotypical black woman: argumentative, defensive, and confident. She struggles to get her voice to be heard, while facing adversities as a single-mother. She is able to create her own destiny by letting no one get in the way of her dream. The movie ends with Effie rejoining the group. Effieâ€™s strength and determination resulted in a sense of unity in the group and among all black women. By rebelling against male dominance, these women were able to follow their dreams and stand up for themselves."
