The group is renamed ‘Deena and the Dreams’. Angry and pregnant with Curtis’s child, Effie leaves the group and is replaced by Michelle (Sharon Leal). Her life as a single parent becomes a struggle as she tries to revive her singing career.

It has a great musical score and will appeal to older adolescents.\n\nThe main message from this movie is that stardom is not as glamorous as it appears and that it can be quite a tough life.\n\nThis movie could also give parents the opportunity to discuss with their children attitudes and behaviours, and their real-life consequences, such as"
