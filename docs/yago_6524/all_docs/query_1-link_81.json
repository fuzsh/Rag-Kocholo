        "text": "IT’S the opening night of the director Michael Bennett’s musical “Dreamgirls” at the Imperial Theater on Broadway, December 1981. In the last row of the top balcony, a young screenwriter leaps to his feet and cheers along as the actress Jennifer Holliday — playing a girl-group singer who has just been dumped by the man who is her manager and lover — delivers her tear-your-heart-out torch song, “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going.” In a stunning moment that gives the lie to her lyrics, she vanishes behind a wall of rotating mirrors that dazzle and shift to reveal three fabulously dressed women who have stolen her place on the stage and are singing up a Motown storm as the curtain falls for intermission.\n\nDissolve to April 2006. On a shaggy street in South Central Los Angeles, Bill Condon, still boyish after 25 years and now a director and Oscar-winning screenwriter, savors the memory of that night as he takes a break from shooting his $70 million version of “Dreamgirls,” starring Beyoncé, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover and an “American Idol” finalist, Jennifer Hudson, as Effie White, the character originally played by Jennifer Holliday.\n\n“I was really in awe of Michael Bennett’s talent, because you could see him pushing the form in a work that was completely cinematic and never stopped moving,” said Mr. Condon, who adapted the stage musical’s book by Tom Eyen. “There are so many uncanny mirror images and parallels involved in our production, but the most important for me was to reflect the soul of the original stage version, yet still make it our own unique thing that speaks to younger audiences who had never seen the Broadway show.”\n\nMuch like the group whose ghetto-to-glam rise it tracks, “Dreamgirls” became a sensation at its opening. And it kept its Motown-inspired musical motors revving through six Tony Awards and 1,521 performances. (In his review in The New York Times, Frank Rich declared that “Broadway history was made at the end of the first act.”)\n\nMr. Condon and the producers, DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures, hope to replicate that sensation when the movie opens in selected cities on Dec. 21, 25 years to the month after the show’s opening night. Toward that end, they have cast the pop star Beyoncé as Deena Jones. Like the musical, she is 25, and like her character, who is based on Diana Ross of the Supremes, she was the lead singer in a black female trio, Destiny’s Child, before moving on to solo stardom.\n\nBeyoncé, however, politely insists that the similarities stop there. “Initially, I was afraid audiences would think this is my life story,” she said. “But I don’t see myself at all in this performance, which is exactly what I wanted. My own vocal style isn’t nearly as laid back as Deena’s, and it was amazingly difficult for me to sing so restrained and poised and still deliver all that soul. Every blink had to be perfect.”\n\nShe says she “pored over” tapes of Ms. Ross in performance to prepare for the role. “It was really strange how sometimes I felt I was channeling Diana Ross,” she said.\n\nWith its marquee touting three black actors who are among the most bankable figures in the entertainment world, the casting of “Dreamgirls” mirrors the crossover phenomenon its story tells. The movie follows Curtis, an ambitious Detroit manager, played by Mr. Foxx, who hustles a local 1960’s black singing group from obscurity to the top of the charts.\n\n“This movie is living proof that what was once the black counterculture has now become the music and movie mainstream,” Mr. Condon said, adding, “We’re at the moment now when the promise of the black Motown explosion of the 60’s has been fully realized.”\n\nOr, as Randy Spendlove, the film’s music supervisor, put it: “There is no longer black music or white music. There’s just music that makes you feel.” The popularity of Motown also helped paper over the industry’s earlier days, which were rife with backstage bribery, payola and dirty tricks — a period depicted in the choreography of one of the film’s main dance numbers, “Steppin’ to the Bad Side.”\n\nWITH its A-list cast and Broadway pedigree, “Dreamgirls” is aiming to reprise the success of the original production by Bennett, whose biggest Broadway triumph was “A Chorus Line” and who died of AIDS in 1987 at 44.\n\nDavid Geffen, a founder of DreamWorks and one of the producers of “Dreamgirls” on Broadway, holds the rights to the show. Over the years, he has rebuffed numerous offers to adapt it to film, and perhaps with good reason. The musical-to-movie highway is littered with misfires by respected directors like Richard Attenborough (“A Chorus Line”), Sidney Lumet (“The Wiz”) and John Huston (“Annie”). One offer he accepted — a production in the late 1990’s that was to be directed by Joel Schumacher and to star Lauryn Hill as Deena — came to naught.\n\nSo how did Mr. Condon, who cut his teeth writing genre scripts back in the 80’s and 90’s (“Strange Invaders,” “FX/2”) and who had never directed a musical before, win Mr. Geffen over?\n\nCut to a Hollywood Christmas party in 2002, shortly after the opening of the hit film “Chicago,” for which Mr. Condon was about to earn his second Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay. (He won for “Gods and Monsters” in 1998). The producer Laurence Mark, who was at the party, recalled that Mr. Condon had been “asked to write every Broadway musical that hadn’t been filmed, or so it seemed.” He continued, “So my question to Bill was, is there any musical you’d love to direct?”\n\nWithout hesitation, Mr. Condon remembered, he replied that “the great unmade musical was ‘Dreamgirls,’ ” but that Mr. Geffen would apparently never release the rights. Mr. Mark offered to telephone Mr. Geffen, a longtime friend.\n\n“And when I did,” Mr. Mark said, “David, of course, spent 15 minutes telling me very nicely how it was just never going to happen for lots of reasons, one of which was that he had the legacy of Michael Bennett to protect.” Nevertheless, Mr. Mark accepted an invitation for Mr. Condon and himself to lunch with Mr. Geffen the next day. (A spokeswoman for Mr. Geffen said he declined to be interviewed, preferring that Mr. Mark speak for him.)\n\n“And during that lunch — somewhere between the baked salmon and the poached pear — Bill did his eight-minute spiel on his vision for the film,” Mr. Mark said. “When he finished, David simply said, ‘O.K., why don’t we give this a whirl?’ The next thing you know, we were talking to business affairs at DreamWorks.”\n\nBut Mr. Condon still had the small matter of directing his next film, “Kinsey.” It would be a year and a half before he could rustle up the time to write “Dreamgirls.” After he did, in January 2005, Mr. Geffen telephoned him — twice — the afternoon that he read the script to say “he was moved by it,” Mr. Condon said.\n\nFour days later, Mr. Geffen announced the production in Variety. “That’s the kind of one-man shop this movie is,” Mr. Condon said. “Because of the backing of Geffen, I’ve been able to make this movie exactly the way I wanted to make it.”\n\nWhat did Mr. Condon tell Mr. Geffen at that fateful pitch? “I said I wanted the story of ‘Dreamgirls’ to mirror its larger historical context of the turbulent 60’s and 70’s — the peace marches, the riots and the real decimation of the inner cities,” Mr. Condon recalled.\n\nAnd so, in a departure from the original, Mr. Condon depicts Motown as a catalyst not only for a musical movement but for social change, too. The film includes montages of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963, echoed later by images of the dream gone sour in the Detroit race riots.\n\nMr. Condon said he also offered Mr. Geffen a solution to a stylistic challenge: “Paradoxically, what makes backstage musicals more cinematic is to set them close to their theatrical roots. I wanted to keep the film of ‘Dreamgirls’ as much in the world of theater as possible.”\n\nIt was a lesson the director had absorbed on the film “Chicago.” “Working on that show was like going to a college for musicals,” he said.\n\nSo, to further fuel the project’s theatrical motor, Mr. Condon decided to move some scenes that originally took place offstage back onto the boards, using theatrical styles to enhance his film in a mirror-image of the way that Bennett — who dazzled Broadway with his use of rapid-fire cross-cuts, fades and dissolves between scenes — summoned cinematic techniques to power his staging.\n\nFor Effie’s gut-wrenching Act I finale, Mr. Condon moved the scene from its original setting in a dressing room directly onto the theatrical force field of a bare stage. The scene was shot over three days during the last week of the five-month production, “to give Ms. Hudson the time needed to grow into the role,” according to Mr. Mark, one of the movie’s producers. “And she nailed it.”\n\nInevitably, the movie will be judged in part by the emotional punch of that one scene. But it presented the filmmakers with a conundrum. How do you top a showstopper that arrives only halfway through the movie? Mr. Condon said he felt that the Broadway show seemed “almost over” at intermission, so he asked his music team, led by Henry Krieger, the show’s composer, to create a new and equally moving song to energize the second act.\n\nThe answer was “Listen,” an 11 o’clock number that Deena sings just before she escapes the heavy hand of Curtis, her manager, to find her own voice as a newly independent woman. Written by Mr. Krieger, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven and Beyoncé, the song is one of four composed for the movie and is included as a bonus track on Beyoncé’s “B’Day” album.\n\n“Even though it takes place in the 70’s, this is a song that you can play on the radio and that my generation of fans can relate to today,” Beyoncé said. “And it has soul, which is really the legacy of Motown.”\n\nAs for the legacy of “Dreamgirls,” Beyoncé, like others in the movie, said Mr. Condon’s preparation and focus were responsible for finally bringing the musical to the screen. “It’s odd, but both Jennifer Hudson and I were born while Michael Bennett was rehearsing this show,” she mused. “Maybe, like Bill, we feel that making this movie was our destiny.”"
