        "text": "It was clear Jennifer Hudson was going to be a movie star from her raw Dreamgirls audition tape.\n\nHudson made the huge step from American Idol breakout to starring alongside heavyweights such as Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx and Beyonce in director Bill Condon's 2006 film adaptation of the musical Dreamgirls.\n\nMore than holding her own, Hudson broke out in a big way as Effie, a performance that earned her a best supporting Oscar.\n\nThis talent was visible from the auditions, revealed here and part of the extras for Dreamgirls director’s extended edition (out on Blu-ray Oct. 10).\n\n\"We have to remember she had been on American Idol, but (Hudson) had never been on a movie set before,\" Condon tells USA TODAY. \"She had this this incredible, natural talent. It was incredible to spend time with her, watching her control that and hone that.\"\n\nThis audition was her third and \"most elaborate,\" says Condon. Vying for the role, Hudson flew to Los Angeles to film it.\n\n\"And that’s where she really started to feel comfortable with the camera,\" Condon says. \"She does have this great confidence. She disguises it sometimes, but it’s what she draws on.\"\n\nCondon says Hudson's raw talent carried over and he cast her despite the lack of screen experience.\n\n\"For both of us, it was like, 'Wow, we’re going to do this,' \" says Condon. \"We had our hands clasped together and we jumped off the cliff. There was excitement. And it felt good really, really fast. I live in awe of how she took on this major role.\"\n\nOf course, Hudson is now coaching on The Voice. Her ability to sing, as she did in And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going in Dreamgirls, was never in question."
