        "text": "1. Whitney Houston could have starred in the original film\n\nA film of Dreamgirls had been in the works since the 1980s with stars such as Whitney Houston and Lauryn Hill rumoured to star. Warner Brothers abandoned the project and DreamWorks/Paramount picked it up in 2006, securing stars including Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Jamie Foxx.\n\n2. Jennifer Hudson had to pile on the pounds\n\nThe film marked Jennifer Hudson's acting debut and the singer had to gain 20 pounds for the role of Effie White.\n\n3. It's a Tony Award Winner\n\nThe musical originally opened in 1981 on Broadway and was nominated for 13 Tony Awards, winning six. The original cast recording also won two Grammy Awards.\n\n4. Amber Riley is a talented songwriter\n\nAmber Riley, who is set to play Effie White in the upcoming Savoy production, once co-wrote a song for pop group The Saturdays.\n\n5. Riley almost missed out on the role of Effie White\n\nThe actress also nearly missed out on the role due to having an operation on her vocal cords a fortnight before being asked to audition. Riley auditioned in New York and flew to London to meet producer Sonia Friedman but contracted bronchitis. Riley sang for Friedman anyway who was moved to tears from her performance.\n\n6. A London production has been in the works for a while\n\nOne of the reasons Dreamgirls has not been seen on stage in London is because of the difficulty in finding an actress to play Effie. Hundreds of people auditioned for the part last year but it wasn't until finding Amber Riley that the show received the go-ahead.\n\n7. Don't compare Dreamgirls to The Supremes!\n\nDespite similarites to the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes, producers have denied that there is any connection between Dreamgirls and the 1960s pop group.\n\n8. Effie White was meant to bite the dust\n\nThe character of Effie White was originally intended to die at the end of act one. However, when Jennifer Holliday – who was playing the role – quit the project because she was upset her character died, playwright Tom Eyen and composer Henry Krieger rewrote the story.\n\n9. The show uses a lot of costumes\n\nThe 2009 US touring production of Dreamgirls had over 460 costumes and 205 wigs.\n\n10. That famous song was never meant to be in the show\n\nAlthough \"Listen\" may be one of the most well known songs in the show, it wasn't in the original Broadway production. Film director Bill Condon added it because he felt the second half of the film needed an \"emotional punch\". It has since been added to the stage version.\n\nDreamgirls opens at the Savoy Theatre on 14 December."
