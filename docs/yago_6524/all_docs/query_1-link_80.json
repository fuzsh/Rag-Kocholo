        "text": "So with the exciting news that Amber Riley is going to be playing Effie White in a West End revival of Dreamgirls – of course I had to go back and revisit this character!.\n\nIn a film about show-business and cracking the industry, you can expect the characters involved to be packed full of talent and ambition; Effie White has both of these and more, but lacks the foundations of a seasoned performer and believes she deserves everything to be given to her from the outset due to her (amazing) voice. This self-righteous pride eventually leads to Effie’s downfall from being a member of America’s hottest trio to struggling to make it on her own; just listen to the song Family and you’ll see what she expects of the world and those around her without giving them any support back.\n\nIt’s not unusual for a character to be humbled over the course of their story, but to be cast aside by everyone who was there for her in her moment of need, and then to become cold towards those who tried to reach out and help after the events, you’d expect Effie to be unlikeable; but the events of the film show us that Effie really did have it quite hard. From her man Curtis deciding to go for a different ‘look’ for the band and woman to love in band-mate Deena, to brother C.C. choosing success over family, Effie’s journey through the film is not without struggle. Even after these events, Effie keeps consistent with her head-strong attitude and refuses help when C.C. comes back in to her life; but it’s at this turning point that we see Effie develop as a character.\n\nWhile it may be with her own interests at heart to launch as a successful artist, Effie forgives her brother and tries again to make it in the industry. It’s nice to see the cold exterior Effie presents to be melted, and her soul bared in the song I Am Changing – a song I feel is defining for the character, more so than belt-out anthem And I Am Telling You. While AIMTY is the big song that everyone remembers, it is a song about Effie and her relationship with Curtis; whereas IAC is just as much a powerhouse song that shows Effie’s progression through the events of the story.\n\nAlthough Effie’s stubbornness is expected from the hurdles we know she and the Dreamettes have faced, it’s this change from vainglorious lead singer to humbled solo artist that is an important message from the film. Effie is one of the characters who starts as a ‘somebody’ and ends as somebody new, with the hurt and the pain of the past teaching her how to be this new person. Just look at the fact she raised Magic without any help; while it can be seen as a point of pride by saying “Magic has no father”, it’s with this anger that Effie manages to be a role model to her daughter about overcoming adversity and remaining true to yourself, while also reigning in your detrimental qualities."
