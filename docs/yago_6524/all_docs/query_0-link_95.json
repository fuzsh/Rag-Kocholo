        "text": "Here’s a Broadway oddball: Side Show, a musical about conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, who became a 1920s freak-show sensation and then top draw on the vaudeville circuit. The original was a failure when it first debuted on Broadway in 1997. Now, Bill Condon, director of Gods And Monsters and the Dreamgirls movie and screenwriter for the film version of Chicago, makes his Broadway directing debut with a revival of the show.\n\nIt stars Erin Davie and Emily Padgett as the sisters, along with Blair Ross and Bill Joy. As I say in my video review above, Condon departs from the original production by emphasizing the freak-show atmosphere, which originally was immortalized in Tod Browning’s 1932 genre classic Freaks, and which co-starred the real Hilton sisters.\n\nDoes this new, new version redeem a flop? Watch my review. And if you go to the show, let us know what you think."
