        "text": "So, this movie is a slap on the face of the American Idol jury who kicked Jennifer Hudson out of the show. Maybe she wasn’t meant for a simple record deal, but for an Oscar and a Golden Globe and all the other awards and critics made to her name. This film was her entire show. When she sings ‘And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going’ we feel like a friend reaching our hand to her; feeling her pain; understanding. That’s art in its purest form: something that reaches another being’s soul.\n\nBut it was not only Hudson who gave a performance so real that we start questioning the whole fiction of it all. Eddie Murphy — and Hudson as well — is living proof that all a good professional needs is the right opportunity. He impersonates crazy Jimmy so well that what was meant to be a side character becomes central. The public shares Jimmy’s frustration and pain, much like in another sensitive and strong musical about American music institution, ‘Ray’. Talking about ‘Ray’, Jamie Foxx is also great; Beyonce is good most of the time; the other actors likewise. It was as if all the characters were played by the right people. Guess the director Bill Condon knew what he was doing, though I imagine what would the film be like were it made by an African-American director. It made me think of ‘The Wizard of Oz’ against ‘The Wiz’.\n\nThe film, based on the musical, has not only good story and music played by the right actors and professionals, but also depicts a lot of how African-American popular music came to where it is today. The 60s and the 70s were decades of tremendous popularization of a once ‘guettoed’ style and it was done by simple people’s dreams. That’s how strong dreams are. No wonder that’s the name of the musical. Still, dreams are not one-facetted shows and the characters suffer with abuse, misogyny, racism and frustration along the way. It’s important to have films like ‘Dreamgirls’ and ‘Lalaland’ and similars, showing reality with a bit of fiction; but which in the end always keep the dream alive."
