        "text": "Dreamgirls is a film made in 2006, depicting the story of an all-female African American singing group from the 1960s-1970s. This film not only focuses on the individual growth and histories of the characters, but also the changing image of African American culture as a whole during that time period. With the Civil Rights Movement and the Detroit Riots both used as background events during the film, the overarching struggles of black artists is set against a much larger struggle of the African American community in America. Dreamgirls doesn’t embody many attitudes and stereotypes present in the mid-20th century, but rather, the institutions that were still at play during 2006, the year the film was made. While the film tries to highlight the extent to which parts of society have evolved in terms of racial equality and women’s rights, the film’s account of the mid-21st century actually illuminates the similarities between the past society and modern society. From the character tropes to the allusions to institutions that should have been fixed but continue to endorse inequality, Dreamgirls forces audiences to re-examine societal prejudices that survived and still continue to exist, even thrive.\n\nThe 1960s was a decade of radical political and cultural change. The Civil Rights Movement and Second Wave feminism were important factors in shaping the cultural and social beliefs of the country. Women both fought against de jure inequalities through Title IX and the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as well as de facto inequalities, including fighting the idea that a woman’s place was in the home and not in the workforce.[1] African Americans were also making strides in gaining more freedoms, and specifically to the film, Motown Records Corporation was founded, opening up opportunities for many black artists to become more popular in the mainstream.[2]\n\nDreamgirls opens at a talent competition in the 1960s. The Dreamettes, Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), and Lorell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) perform, and while the crowd is impressed, they end up losing to another performer. Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx), a car salesman turned music producer, offers the Dreamettes a job as back-up singers for the locally famous Jimmy “Thunder” Early. The girls accept and travel around with him, and Early starts having an affair with Robinson. However, he and the group are eventually separated after an incident where Early embarrasses the group in front of an important audience. Curtis ends up replacing the bold lead singer (and his current love interest) Effie White with the soft-spoken Deena Jones. Tensions rise as Effie is increasingly convinced that Deena and Curtis are having an affair, and Effie is eventually replaced and forced to find a new career on her own while Deena and the other girls rise to stardom.\n\nDreamgirls struggles to effectively represent how difficult it was for African Americans to become famous in a predominantly white field like music. In one scene, Effie rushes out of the recording studio into the streets of Detroit.[3] She sees the riots and violence happening in the streets, and she (and the audience) is reminded of the fact that most African Americans during that time period were not as fortunate as her.[4] The 1967 Detroit Riot had more than 40 deaths, 1,000 injuries, and 7,000 arrests.[5] This scene was especially important because prior to this, the scenes had been centered on glitzy nightclubs and lavish musical numbers. The main struggle of the protagonists was getting ahead in the music industry, an effort that musicians still go through today, not unique to the 1960s. But having Effie run into the street is a brutal reminder that most African Americans in that period had much larger problems than getting a record deal. However, this scene was still unique compared to the rest of the film. Glamorous 1960s style costumes and album covers seem to be the only things that are constant reminders of the time period; and while these heighten the visual aspect of the film, they also create a sense of nostalgia for a time period saturated in racial and political tensions. By systematically showing less of the physical prejudices of the 1960s, the film creators increase the lightheartedness of the movie, so not to get too dramatic for a musical movie hybrid. This flashy, colorful 1960s with certain parts removed shows a less than accurate picture of the time period.\n\nIn the past, for African Americans to be successful in the film industry, they had to play into stereotypes that were set by white people who played African Americans through blackface. Back then, the two main stereotypes were: “the happy, shuffling, plantation ‘darkies’ and the inept, urban buffoons.”[6] African Americans slowly had to create depth for their characters, even if on the surface they were still the same tropes as the ones the white people played. As a general rule, “America can identify with minorities as comedians, but is not prepared to accept them as central characters in drama-as whole, human beings.”[7] These beliefs were present not only in the very beginning of television and movies, but persisted into the mid-20th century. In “the early 1970s, several situation comedies focusing on Black families marked a resurgence in oversimplified portrayals of Blacks. These caricatures could be seen on shows from What’s Happening and Good Times to The Jeffersons and were maintained even into the 1980s with a revived mammy role in Gimme a Break.”[8] Within mid 21st century comedy TV shows and movies (Dreamgirls included), we see similar character tropes as in the past.\n\nThe strongest stereotype is evident through Jennifer Hudson’s character, Effie. Effie exemplifies what other scholars call the “strongblackwoman” character. Kimberly Springer, from the Department of Black Studies at the University of Portland, says that the stereotype of the strongblackwoman originates in “the history of slavery” and the ways that black women were expected to keep a strong outer complex under even the worst situations. Strongblackwoman is condensed into one word to exemplify how these traits have become both a singular and inseparable identity trait. This model is a harmful stereotype to perpetuate because it’s “a way for Black women to deny emotional, psychic, and even physical pain, all the while appearing to keep it together.”[9]And Hudson’s character plays right into these stereotypes. She learns that she is pregnant with Curtis’ child right before he replaces her in the Dreams. Even after visiting the unemployment office for years, she still refuses to tell Curtis about the child or even accept the money that her brother has been sending her. She symbolizes the pressures that many African American women feel that they need to exemplify, an expectation to “persevere under any circumstances.”[10]\n\nAnika Noni Rose plays Lorell Robinson, the youngest member of the Dreams who grows to have a relationship with the already married Jimmy “Thunder” Early, played by Eddie Murphy. While the Dreams eventually become more famous than Early, in the beginning of the film, they are singing back up for him. Robinson, especially, is star struck, and she receives attention and love from a man who she knows is already married. Robinson represents a different stereotype, the Jezebel: a young, oversexed women who receives some sort of emotional or material goods from her relationships.[11] We see the sexualization of African American women throughout countless music videos and movies during the time the film was made, and as a society, are fixated on the sexuality of young African American girls in particular. The idea “African American women are not and do not have the capacity to be sexually innocent”[12] stems from the media portrayals of young African American girls as somehow more inherently sexual than their Caucasian counterparts. Many scholars have focused on African American females and “how popular culture has commodified the black female body as hyper sexed.”[13] Robinson’s main plotline as well as character development is centered solely on her relationship with Early. But her fulfillment of the Jezebel stereotype is grounded in her age, the Jezebel is a young woman, and Robinson is 18 at the beginning of the film. This shows that, even in 2006, African Americans still struggles with harsh character tropes and limited depth of character.\n\nAssimilation and conformity to fit into “white culture” is also a driving force of the film. Curtis claims that he wants to appeal to a younger audience for the Dreams, yet he chooses Deena to be the new lead singer and replace Effie.[14] In actuality, Robinson is the youngest member of the Dreams, yet Curtis does not choose her to be the new lead. We can attribute this fact to the idea that Curtis doesn’t want to the Dreams to look younger; he wants the Dreams to look whiter. The documentary, The Colour of Beauty, follows an African American woman and her pursuit of becoming a top model. Other agents and leaders in the fashion industry discuss how only 6% of the models in the 2008 fashion week were African American. This is because it’s difficult for African American women to get jobs as top models unless they have ”white” facial features like a slim nose and face. Often, agents are told to find African American girls that “look like white girls that were painted black”, without unique features of African Americans because “black doesn’t sell.”[15] While this documentary was primarily a comment of the fashion industry, these ideas and practices still hold true for the entertainment industry as a whole, especially as music is becoming and increasingly visual medium. This idea derives from the ideology that “White consumers will not buy a product if it is associated with non-Whites, and advertisers have been reluctant to increase the number of non-White characters in their ads because they fear a potential loss of offended White customers.”[16] These beliefs not only decrease the chances African American women and other minorities from have from being included in advertisements, movies, and television show, it also forces them to change their overall appearance to one that is more Euro-centric, often including “light skin, straight hair, and other White features.”[17] Interestingly, this is more of a commentary on the culture of 2006 as opposed to the culture of the 1960s. African American female entertainers during the mid 20th century had more individual and diverse features than those of the early 21st century.\n\nLooking at the popular artists of 2006, we see a much more homogenous group in relation to facial features. Therefore, while it may have helped if the Dreams had a more Caucasian looking lead to sell to a white audience, that visual aspect appears more necessary in 2006.\n\nYet even with this discrimination based on appearance, society sends the message that the entertainment industry is one of the only ones where minorities can become successful. Comedian Chris Rock once made a joke about the neighborhood he lived in. He tells the audience how the other African Americans that live there (excluding himself) are Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, and Eddie Murphy, all world-class entertainers. But Rock’s next-door neighbor, a white man, is a dentist. The African Americans that live in the neighborhood have to be world-class entertainers to get to the same financial level as a white person with a more commonplace job. As Rock says, “See, the black man gotta fly to somethin’ the white man can walk to.”[18] The idea that Rock is alluding to was present in the 1960s era portrayal of Dreamgirls as well as the 2006 society that made the movie. The message this gives to African Americans is that the only way they can be successful is through a career in entertainment. Effie’s severe downfall after leaving the Dreams is an example of this problem. When she was no longer singing with the Dreams, she had to move into a lower income area and constantly visit the unemployment office to try and find work. She even tells the worker that her only marketable talent is her voice, and she doesn’t have the skills for any other job. In addition to this, when Effie goes to Curtis threatening to sue him for payola scams, the lawyer she brings in is a white male. Oddly enough, this is one of the only white characters featured in the movie. This sends the message that African Americans can only be characters if the narrative is about the entertainment industry, not pursue careers in law or other fields.\n\nWhile the movie shows clips of Detroit (both before and after the destruction caused by the riots) the changes in the city seem more like a cinematic effect than a real historical issue. We see the city thriving when the girls are recording there, then we see the riots in progress when Effie storms out of the building, and finally we see the decaying view when Effie returns after having been removed from the Dreams. It appears that the city is a reflection of Effie and her personal journey more than it is a part of a changing social system, more important than the emotional dynamic of one person. For a riot that forced the government to send in the National Guard, the unusual idea that these characters (who have spent the majority of their lives in Detroit) are somehow unaffected goes too far to suspend disbelief.\n\nMedia often portrays the Black Freedom Movement as “good” stages and “bad” stages. Martin Luther King Jr. and the non-violent protests are often romanticized, a less radical part of the Civil Rights Movement that white audiences feel more comfortable with. The latter part of the movement, which included the rise of the Black Panthers and more violet protests, is often portrayed less or even not at all in television and movies. Police brutality and other forms of blatant racism were such crucial parts of understanding the movement and the actions of people at the time. Therefore, showing the clips of injured people from Detroit and collapsing building begs the question as the to why the city appeared to be under such siege.[19] These news clips in addition to the re-enacted material does not give a full view of the tensions at the time. When Effie runs into the street and sees the crowds, Curtis follows, and yells in support for black power to a passing car. The majority of the people breaking the windows and buildings and riding around shooting guns are African American. While it may be historically accurate that many African Americans took part in the riots themselves, it gives too much of a one-sided story. De facto discrimination was paramount in understanding the riots, and the impact of these institutions on African Americans is two-fold: “psychologically, in the sense that the Negro must face a situation where they are constantly regarded as inferior; [and] socially and economically, in the sense that the Negroes’ share of the wealth in America is limited.”[20] Without at least some clips or references to the underlying and overt tensions present in society that were the real causes of the riots, the causation for the violence is too ambiguous, and blends into the background of the individual narratives.\n\nThe reception of Dreamgirls also shows the prejudice still present in society and the entertainment industry. Effie shows the audience the “good” stages of Civil Rights by bringing in a record with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on it, reminding present audiences how much progress has been made since the era. The Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act had been signed over 40 years prior. Audiences in 2006 could legally marry someone from any race they wanted and sit anywhere in any restaurant or bus they wanted. As contemporary audiences watching movies about Civil Rights, we can’t help but feel like we as a society have improved from the time being portrayed. However, while there were less legal restrictions on racial segregation, the overall consciousness of racial tensions was still very much present in 2006 American society. The five films that were nominated for best picture in the year 2007 were Letters from Iwo Jima, Little Miss Sunshine, the Departed, the Queen, and Babel. Dreamgirls received eight nominations for awards, and was “the first film in many decades to have the most nominations and not be in the best-picture category.”[21] Newspapers including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal announced that they all thought Dreamgirls was a front-runner for an Oscar for best picture.[22] So the idea that a huge blockbuster as this wasn’t even nominated came as a shock. Some scholars believe that this lack of a nomination is due to the fact that Dreamgirls had a predominantly African American cast while all the movies that were nominated had predominantly white casts.\n\nAs Ron Harris, of the Los Angeles Times wrote in 1989, “Perception of minorities is often drawn from earlier distorted movie and television stereotypes.”[23] Social prejudices and discriminatory institutions were very influential in both the making, and the reception of the movie. Even in the contemporary entertainment industry its apparent that “films blacks and other minorities produce, those films are comedies or music-related or action movies.”[24] So while Dreamgirls did not accurately depict the 1960s as well as it gave an insight into the culture of 2006, it was still an important movie of the time period. From its box office reception to its Oscar response, Dreamgirls forced people to talk about institutions that were still functioning from the time it depicted to its creation. In 2013, eight of the nine movies that were nominated for Best Picture featured predominantly white casts. The ninth, 12 Years a Slave, was not only nominated for Best Picture, it won. And not only was 12 Years a Slave an Oscar-winning film with an African American protagonist, it was a drama. While the societal and cultural elements in Dreamgirls exemplified that America in 2006 still emphasized outdated ideas about race and women, society has, in recent years, shown some improvement in minority representation in the media. While inequality is still present, there are signs of growth.\n\n[1] “The 1960s” History. http://www.history.com/topics/1960s\n\n[2] Classic Motown.
