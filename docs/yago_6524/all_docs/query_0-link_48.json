The winner of the award will be announced on Saturday, February 3 at the Hyatt Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles.\n\nCondon will compete against co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Farris (Little Miss Sunshine), Stephen Frears (The Queen), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel), and Martin Scorcese (The Departed). The DGA nominations are considered a very reliable predictor of the Academy Award nominations, which will be announced on January 23, and 51 of the past 57 DGA winners have also won the Oscar."
