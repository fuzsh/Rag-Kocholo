        "text": "Assistant Professor\n\nDr. Mellissa Bortz is an assistant professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and a nationally certified speech-language pathologist. Her research interest include the development of language assessments for Global populations and Translanguaging narrative assessments. Her teaching and clinical interests focus on the assessment and treatment of language challenges and neurodiversity. Originally from South Africa, Dr. Bortz is especially interested in understanding how speech-language pathologists can best serve multilingual individuals in culturally and linguistically diverse areas of the globe.\n\nDr. Bortz is a member of the American Speech – Language – Hearing Association (ASHA). She is a Coordinating Committee Member of SIG 17 Global Issues in Communication Sciences and Related Disorders and was selected to participate in ASHA’s Faculty Development Institute. In addition, she’s a part of ASHA’s Leadership Development Program and previously served on the ASHA International Issues Board. She is a member of International Association of Communication Sciences and Disorders (IALP) and she is also a founding member of the African Connections networking group.\n\nAt St John’s, Dr. Bortz has been awarded the Faculty Mission Certificate by the Vincentian Centre for Church and Society. She is a member of the Equity and Inclusion Council. Her students participate in Academic Service-Learning and some of their projects have been presented at conferences. She is the faculty moderator for the St John’s NSSLHA chapter which has received Gold Honors. She enjoys mentoring her students and encourages interested students to participate in her research.\n\nTeaching Philosophy\n\nEveryone in the world is created equally. I am therefore wholly committed to teaching everyone equitably. I am a passionate Speech Language Pathologist and aim to develop that passion in my students. I do this by empowering students with an ‘I can succeed and work out how to do this’ attitude. I therefore teach using the Socratic method and Bloom’s Taxonomy to developing critical thinking by students. Interactive learning, with dynamic class discussions are very helpful in linking theory to practice. I also share my clinical experience and video of culturally and linguistically diverse clients with students so that they can gain a realistic impression of what being a Speech Language Pathologist/Audiologist entails. In the words of Ginsberg, Friberg and Visconti (2012) I wish ‘to instill a love of learning’ in my students so they become colleagues in the Speech Language Pathology/ Audiology Profession and/or faculty members themselves (p. 2 - 3)."
