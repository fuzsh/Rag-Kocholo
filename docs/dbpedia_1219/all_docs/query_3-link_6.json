        "text": "In just three decades, Great Britain’s place in world politics was transformed. In 1945, it was the world’s preeminent imperial power with global interests. By 1975, Britain languished in political stasis and economic recession, clinging to its alliance with the United States and membership in the European Community. Amid this turmoil, British intellectuals struggled to make sense of their country’s decline and the transformed world in which they found themselves. This book assesses their responses to this predicament and explores the different ways British thinkers came to understand the new international relations of the postwar period.\n\nThis paper evaluates the English School (ES) as a prominent approach to the study of International Relations (IR) as a “scientific research enterprise” (James, International Relations and Scientific Progress, 2002). Analysis begins with introduction of a “continuum of aggregation” that conveys a given scientific research enterprise, such as the English School, at different conceptual levels. The ES’s axioms, along with its negative and positive heuristics, are identified and evaluated on the basis of classic and more recent works from Wight, Bull and others. Conclusions and prospects for further development of the ES complete the paper."
