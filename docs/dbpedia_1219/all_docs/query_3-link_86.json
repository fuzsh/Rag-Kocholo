        "text": "Chautauqua Lecture Series\n\nWhat We Got Wrong: Learning from Our Mistakes\n\nThe earth isn’t flat, nor is it the center of the universe. Diseases aren’t caused by an imbalance of humors. Asbestos, as it turns out, isn’t the best building material. And maybe, just maybe, there’s a whole lot more we’ve gotten wrong throughout our history. In this week, we turn with both candor and curiosity to our past, pinpointing the moments and ideas we can now say emphatically and categorically were misguided, incorrect, or flawed. We look at the psychology of personal decision-making, and the reflective introspection and humility that happens when we change our minds. Finally, we take the same lens of hindsight and apply it to our present, considering the thought experiment: What will future generations say we’re getting wrong now?\n\nKori Schake, American Enterprise Institute’s director of foreign and defense policy studies, returns to the Chautauqua Lecture Series on Monday, July 8, 2024, to examine the contemporary legacy of American warfare — from Vietnam through Afghanistan to the current day — asking what mistakes we’ve learned from and those we’ve not, and how this can inform American military strategy as we engage in a new era of diplomacy and defense. On Tuesday, July 9, 2024, journalist and author of When Crack Was King: A People’s History of a Misunderstood Era Donovan X. Ramsey will reflect on the failures of the United States’ decades-long “war on drugs” and generally on the systemic mistreatment and oppression of marginalized populations throughout American history. Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, historian and journalist Kai Bird takes the stage Wednesday, July 10, 2024, to discuss the legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose groundbreaking work altered the course of history. Bird will draw on American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which he co-authored and which served as the inspiration for the 2023 film “Oppenheimer.” On Thursday, July 11, 2024, co-author of The Big Fail: What the Pandemic Revealed About Who America Helps and Who it Leaves Behind, Bethany McLean, returns to the Chautauqua Lecture Series to offer a perspective on the mistakes that led to, and in some cases perpetuated or deepened, recent world and American financial crises — and what we’ve learned from those experiences to prevent or soften future downturns. Finally, the Novartis Professor of Leadership and Management at the Harvard Business School and author of Right Kind of Wrong: The Science of Failing Well, Amy C. Edmonson, closes the week on Friday, July 12, 2024."
