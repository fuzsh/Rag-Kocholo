        "text": "Journal Science and Engineering Ethics Publication\n\nDr. Richard T. Cimino and colleagues have recently published the article “Comparing first-year engineering student conceptions of ethical decision making to performance on metrics of ethical reasoning,” in the journal Science and Engineering Ethics. In this work, Dr. Cimino et al. report on a research study in which the ethical reasoning of first-year undergraduate engineering students at several universities was assessed with multiple ethical reasoning tools. In addition to these tools, students were also asked to create personal concept maps of the phrase “ethical decision-making.” The results of this study suggest that the way first-year students conceptualize ethical decision making does not predict the way they behave when performing scenario-based ethical reasoning (perhaps more situated). This disparity indicates a need to more precisely quantify engineering ethical reasoning and decision making.\n\n2023 Early Career Investigator Award Recipient\n\nKathleen McEnnis, assistant professor, received the 2023 Early Career Award from Metavivor Foundation for her proposal titled “Mesenchymal stem cells as platinum nanoparticle delivery systems for metastatic breast cancer treatment.”\n\nCME Diversity Dialogue Series\n\nThe NJIT Otto H York Department recently hosted a panel discussion on \"Diversity in Engineering: Navigating Industry & Immigration\" which featured top immigration lawyers, Neil Dourbaum and Kathleen Peregoy, Connell Folley and various industry engineering experts, Horane Henry, Disney, Chadakarn Sitassichoke, PhD., BMS and Tayo Femi- Fowode, GE Vernova. Over a light lunch, approximately 40 students were able to interact with the guests and discuss steps to landing a job in US industry in spite of immigration challenges. Understanding that the current demand for higher education degree STEM jobs are typically filled by international students, the department recognizes the importance of acknowledging differences in cultural background and immigration status and is committed to preparing its student body with the necessary tool kit and resources to be successful engineers in spite of these disparities.\n\nHosts: Dr. Kerri-lee Chintersingh and Dr. Richard Cimino, Chair, CME DEI Committee\n\nJoint NSF-DFG Collaboration\n\nGennady Gor, associate professor, of the Otto H. York Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, collaborated with Prof. Patrick Huber from Hamburg University of Technology for almost a decade. They wrote several papers together, organized sessions at Interpore, and last year their collaboration further strengthened when they received a joint NSF-DFG grant on electrolytes in nanopores.\n\nProf. Gor was the host for Patrick's group when they came to NJIT for the APS Meeting. Three Ph.D. students Juan Sanchez, Laura Gallardo, Guido Dittrich, visited his group during their visit. During their visit they spent the entire day at NJIT talking about fluids in nanopores, and the cherry on the cake was the weather, 19C (66F) in mid November!\n\nUpper row (left to right): Guido Dittrich, Juan Sanchez, Laura Gallardo, Gennady Gor, Ashoka Karunarathne, Geordy Jomon, Andrei Kolesnikov,\n\nLower row: Santiago Alberto Flores Roman, Egor Demidov, Ella Ivanova, Liza Basharova, Gunel Nabiyeva\n\nSome papers Prof. Gor wrote together with Patrick:\n\nElastic response of mesoporous silicon to capillary pressures in the pores https://lnkd.in/ehnegvtr\n\nAdsorption-induced deformation of nanoporous materials - A review https://lnkd.in/eTnShkRX\n\nElastocapillarity in nanopores: sorption strain from the actions of surface tension and surface stress https://lnkd.in/e5Ks-BzE\n\nAdsorption from binary liquid solutions into mesoporous silica: a capacitance isotherm on 5CB nematogen/cyclohexane mixtures https://lnkd.in/ehPiBuRu\n\nPresenter at the 2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference\n\nDr. Cimino has recently published and presented a conference paper entitled \"Work-in-Progress: A Study of Chemical Engineering Student Biases Regarding Teamwork and DEI Issues across the Curriculum\" at the 2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) in College Station, TX on October 21st. In this work, he outlines his efforts towards integrating critical and reflective instruction regarding DEI in the context of teamwork in the Chemical Engineering Department, and describes the longitudinal plan for studying the effects of this instruction on student attitudes over the 2023-2026 academic years. This paper will be the first in a series, cataloging the results of this longitudinal study. The permalink to the paper is forthcoming.\n\nExcellence In Teaching Award Recipient\n\nFor the the 2021/2022 academic year, Kathleen McEnnis was awarded the Excellence in Teaching Award in the category of Upper Division Undergraduate Instruction by Tenured/Tenure Track Faculty. She also received the 2023 Newark College of Engineering Excellence in Teaching Award, which recognizes an NCE full-time tenured/tenure-track faculty member or university lecturer who has demonstrated excellence in teaching as recognized by faculty, students and alumni and has served as a full time member for at least three years.\n\nFor other news, a research publication from my group authored by my PhD student Guangliang Liu, undergrad student Roberto Martinez, high school student Anika Bhatnagar, and myself, entitled \"Influence of Surfactant on Glass Transition Temperature of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) Nanoparticles\", was recently accepted to the Emerging Investigators Series in the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Soft Matter. This themed series showcases work being conducted by Emerging Investigators. This collection gathers the very best work from soft matter scientists in the early stages of their independent careers in recognition of their potential to influence future directions in the field. Liu, G.; Martinez, R.; Bhatnager, A. McEnnis, K. Soft Matter, 2023, DOI: 10.1039/D3SM00082F\n\nAdditionally, I received notification from Wiley that my group's research article \"Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis of Polymer Nanoparticles in Blood Plasma\" was a top cited article among work published in an issue in the journal Particle & Particle Systems Characterization during 2021-2022.\n\nBannon, M. S., López Ruiz, A., Corrotea Reyes, K., Marquez, M., Wallizadeh, Z., Savarmand, M., LaPres, C. A., Lahann, J., McEnnis, K., Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis of Polymer Nanoparticles in Blood Plasma. Part. Part. Syst. Charact. 2021, 2100016. DOI: 10.1002/ppsc.202100016\n\n2023 Excellence in Catalysis Award Recipient\n\nXianqin Wang, professor of chemical and materials engineering, won the 2023 award for Excellence in Catalysis. The award, sponsored by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, consists of a plaque and a $1,500 gift. It is granted to an individual or a research team from North America to recognize outstanding contributions in either applied or basic research in either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis.\n\nThe award ceremony will be held in Fall 2023.\n\nPreparing the Space Workforce for the Future\n\nResearches from NJIT (Boris Khusid), Creare LLC (Thomas Conboy), and RPI (Joel Plawsky, Corey Woodcock) focus on preparing the space workforce for space thermal and cryogenic technologies. Space thermal management systems utilize various components for energy transport, acquisition, rejection, storage, reclamation, and for temperature control in life support systems and various mission environments. Applications of cryogenics in space include scientific instrumentation, telecommunications, cryo-electronics, superconducting magnets, and propellant storage and utilization. The educational activity will be on multiphase flow, heat, and mass transfer in thermal and cryogenic systems under reduced and microgravity environments where the gravitational body force is absent. Since the conventional gravitational mechanisms driving these phenomena are not present in these environments, the design, fabrication and safe operation of these systems requires unique skills and expertise. Educational events will be organized to reach out and engage communities that are underrepresented in the space workforce.\n\nEPA Grant Recipient\n\nMengqiang (Mark) Zhao, assistant professor in the chemical and materials department was awarded a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the amount of $25,000 for his proposal on 2D TMD-based FET sensors for lead ion. With the increasing concerns on the lead contamination in drinking water systems, there is a pressing demand to develop highly cost-effective and portable detection sensors of lead ions (Pb2+) in drinking water. This project aims to develop scalable two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based field-effect transistor (FET) sensors for rapid in-situ lead detection in drinking water. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) films will be used to stabilize TMDs as well as facilitate the functionalization of TMDs with Pb2+ probe molecules. This invention will gain new insights and lay foundation for developing novel lead sensors.\n\nCME Faculty Embrace Artificial Intelligence as a Learning Opportunity\n\nJoshua Young, assistant professor of chemical and materials engineering, embraces artificial intelligence by having his students compare their own work to the automated code, and then look for strengths and weaknesses. Students know that code itself is only a small part of data science, compared to context such as deciding what to measure and determining the input parameters. ChatGPT doesn't know that.

Cimino and Dr. Rees Rankin are the recipients of a $1000 Active Learning Grant offered by the Institute for Teaching Effectiveness (ITE) and through the generous support of the Martinson Family Foundation. This Active Learning Grant is a part of the Virtual Immersive Technologically Augmented Learning (VITAL) initiative, which prioritizes innovative student-centered teaching and learning, with an emphasis on immersive and active learning.\n\nThe grant will be applied to the development of activities in the new CHE-201 Material and Energy Balances course. In addition to 4 hours (2 hrs on two separate days) of lecture-based instruction each week, this course will have a third one-hour active learning session, during which students will participate in a team-based or individual gamified and/or game based learning experiences. Students will solve ill-posed problems (i.e. problems requiring significant assumptions to be made, which can result in a spectrum of correct answers). These challenge problems will require the brainstorming of solution strategies and documentation of assumptions, which will also be assessed. A special emphasis will be placed on the potential human impacts of their design choices, by situating the design challenges within the context of recent chemical process safety incidents and events, among others. Still other design challenges will involve creating computer-based solutions, and then utilizing them to answer similarly ill-posed questions. All challenges will conclude with a collective debrief, which may come in the form of an informal discussion, or in some cases a brief but formal oral presentation.\n\nNature Reviews Materials Publication\n\nAssistant Professor Kerri-lee Chintersingh, CME, NJIT along with a team of experts across the United States (UF, UCSD, UCSB, MIT, JHU) and Germany (Max Planc Institute) recently published a ViewPoint article in Nature Reviews Materials. The article titled \"Materials for Extreme Environments\" brings focus on the state of the art in material development, characterization and modeling approaches and highlights the most exciting advances, opportunities and bottlenecks in various applications like materials used in aeroplane engines, hypervelocity micrometeroid impacts on satellites, high speed machining of ceramics, strong radiation doses in nuclear reactors and countering weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAlexei Khalizov (CES) and Gennady Gor (CME) received a $620k grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve ways of describing soot nanoparticles in atmospheric models. Soot is a potent climate forcer with a warming contribution as much as 1/3 of that from carbon dioxide. However, unlike with carbon dioxide, for soot this contribution is known with a large uncertainty. The project “A Multiscale Model for Restructuring of Atmospheric Soot Particles” will help to reduce the uncertainty by improving the ability of models to describe the evolution of soot particles in the atmosphere and allowing to produce more accurate predictions of climate warming caused by soot. Notably, this collaborative project was initiated with support from the NJIT Faculty SEED award. It is also a natural extension of Alexei's previous NSF project “Kinetics and Mechanism of Restructuring of Atmospheric Soot and Associated Impact on Light Absorption”.\n\nAmong the many things that made the grant application successful is the research contributions from Alexei’s and Gennady’s students. One of them, Dr. Ogochukwu Enekwizu (CME), is now a postdoctoral researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory. She contributed to both experimental and computational aspects of preliminary work. Ali Hasani (CES), who is about to defend his PhD thesis, was responsible for the experimental aspects of the project. Ella Ivanova, a PhD student in CME, has been carrying out the theoretical and computational work. An undergraduate student, Egor Demidov is a CME senior and a twice Provost Summer Research awardee, sees his near future as PhD student. Divjyot Singh, a math and physics double major and a twice Provost Summer Research awardee, contributed to the computational part of the project. He graduated last year and joined the Los Alamos National Laboratory as a post-baccalaureate researcher.\n\nEcevit Bilgili, Professor of Chemical Engineering, delivered a webinar titled \"Lectures are Not Dead: Effective Strategies for Excellent Lectures” (in Turkish: “Dersler ölü değildir: Mükemmel dersler için etkili stratejiler\") on Oct. 25, 2022.

Through global public and private sector collaboration, next-generation nucleic acid-based vaccines have been developed and deployed in record time including two mRNA-based lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccines: the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), and Moderna (mRNA-1273), COVID-19 vaccines. However, the current LNP-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are limited by short shelf life and a lack of stability which requires them to be kept between −60 °C and −80 °C, and −15 °C and −25 °C respectively, and this ultracold-chain storage and transportation cause an exponential increase in the cost of transportation and distribution. To address this challenge, Prof. Xiaoyang Xu and his team have developed a new class of lipid-modified polymers via enzyme-catalyzed esterification, and further formulation of the polymers with an FDA-approved medical material PLGA-PEG leads to self-assembly into a “particle-in-particle” (PNP) nanostructure for gene delivery. The top-performing nanoparticles can efficiently deliver both DNA and mRNA in vitro and in vivo, presenting enhanced transfection efficacy, sustained gene release behavior, and excellent stability for at least 12 months of storage at −20 °C after lyophilization without loss of transfection efficacy. Encapsulated with spike encoded plasmid DNA and mRNA, the lipid-modified polymeric PNP COVID-19 vaccines successfully elicit spike-specific antibodies and Th1-biased T cell immune responses in immunized mice even after 12 months of lyophilized storage at −20 °C. This newly developed lipid-polymer hybrid PNP nanoparticle system demonstrates a new strategy for both plasmid DNA and mRNA delivery with the capability of long-term lyophilized storage. A paper entitled \"Lipid-polymer hybrid “Particle-in-Particle” nanostructure gene delivery platform explored for lyophilizable DNA and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\" has been officially published by Advanced Functional Materials, which is a prestigious journal with an impact factor of 19.924.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202204462\n\nProfessor Ecevit Bilgili of the Otto H. York Department of Chemical and Materials Department presented a plenary lecture titled \"The 4M Business for Drug Nanoparticles and Nanocomposites: Making, Manipulating, Measuring, and Modeling\" at the 17th European Symposium on Comminution & Classification in Toulouse, France on June 28th, 2022 (https://escc2022.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/3).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfessor Bilgili also presented an invited seminar titled \"Recent Advances in the Production of Drug Nanoparticles and Nanocomposites\" at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkiye on Aug. 16th, 2022 (https://etkinlikler.hacettepe.edu.tr/en/recent_advances_in_the_product-998).\n\nNew NJIT-Led NSF IUCRC Center Wins Pharma Backing\n\nRajesh Dave, distinguished professor, leads a new industry-backed center that will improve pharmaceutical drug formulations, while developing efficient ways to design new drugs digitally and simpler, faster methods to manufacture them.\n\nRead more\n\nNAMF Student Award Competition Finalist\n\nBaran Teoman, Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering, and Justin Pace, currently pursuing his undergrade ChE degree, have been selected as two of the three finalists in the NAMF Student Award Competition sponsored by the North American Mixing Forum (NAMF) of AIChE. They are both working in the Mixing Lab at NJIT and they are advised by Professor Piero Armenante.

The round trip transport was sponsored by NJIT GSA. Our department endorses such social activities to strengthen networking among graduate students. And in this regard, starting from spring 2022 our student leaders are hosting different social events to facilitate student interactions every other Monday after CME Graduate Seminar.\n\nPODCAST: Professor Armenante Talks About His Research Activities\n\nListen here\n\nPiero Armenante, Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering, was recently interviewed by Dr. John Thomas of M-Star of M-Star CFD, about his current and past research activities focused on mixing in liquid and multiphase mixing systems and related phenomena. In this podcast Prof. Armenante describes his recent and long-term activities aimed at fully characterizing the complex hydrodynamic behavior of different mechanically agitated systems, ranging from small testing equipment used in the pharmaceutical and consumer product industries, such as dissolution testing apparatuses and dispenser bottles, to larger systems such as industrial pharmaceutical reactors and stirred vessels. To conduct this work, he and his students at NJIT used an array of experimental tools, such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), as well as many techniques, as well as computational tools such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Through the combination of both approaches he and his team were not only able to precisely quantify the velocity profiles in the system under investigation, and therefore understand the details of its functioning, but also to study complex phenomena such as the suspension and dispersion of solid particles in liquids, the formation of vortices in mechanically stirred vessels, or the pumping of fluids with complex rheological properties.\n\n2022 Kokes Award Recipient\n\nSafa Alzaim, a PhD student in the Otto H.

The first-year chemical engineering students John Mullen, Justin Nguyen, Matthew Stickles & Melisa Bilgili (Team #14, bottom photo) won second place, while Madison Cosgrove, Antionio Antonucci, Colton Jones & John Szczepanski (Team #15, top photo) won the Audience Choice Award. These wonderful recognitions would not be possible without the dedication, mentoring and advisement from Professor Irina Molodetsky.\n\nBelow are a few words from Professor Molodetsky and team leaders.\n\nProfessor Molodetsky expressed \"as a teacher, I am thankful for the opportunity to be a part of the First Year Engineering Showcase, and another opportunity for me to communicate with our curious and creative freshmen. I enjoy seeing the process of preparation for the Showcase, where the team members have to go deeper in the subject of their presentation, appreciate lessons learned during the semester, and polish their presentation for a wide audience. It really takes time after the final presentation in class to continue learning and improving the skills needed for the NCE Showcase. It requires dedication and commitment of all team members to extend FED experience beyond the semester but this is what helps our students win. I specifically want to acknowledge the key role of our team leaders who schedule the discussion sessions, unite, energize team members and follow up with the suggested improvements.\"\n\nMadison said \"the First Year Showcase was a great opportunity for us to expand our engineering knowledge. The in class assignment had to be one way and cover certain topics, but the showcase gave us more freedom in what we could talk about. In preparation for the showcase we focused more on the bigger picture of our design and were able to learn more about how it would be if we actually implemented our model. We were able to expand our knowledge of the problem we were tackling and how other engineers are approaching it. One of the best parts of this whole process was learning that your knowledge is always growing and every project can be improved over time. The best advice to a group preparing for the showcase is to be open to new ideas and change. The showcase is a great experience to get feedback from people with more experience, and to work as a team to learn and grow as people and engineers. This experience is also a chance to practice your presentation skills that will be used in the workforce. As scary as this all sounds, the showcase is a fun environment where everyone wants you to succeed so don’t stress and learn along the way.\"\n\nMatthew said \"our experiences in working on this project helped to reinforce theory we learned in class with hands-on experience. During the course, we learned the purpose of the parts that we used in designing and constructing our CO2 scrubber, and it was extremely gratifying to see it all come together. Moreover, my group and I felt that, as our project progressed, we became increasingly efficient as a team, which will no doubt help us in our college years and beyond. It was very helpful to construct a model build of something that a chemical engineer may actually build, and gave us insight to roles that a chemical engineer may fulfill in an industrial setting. We would whole-heartedly recommend that anybody who wants to present at the showcase should present, as it gets your name out there within the department, and it’s a great experience for the team.\"\n\nNew Member of NJIT's Chapter of the National Academy of Inventors\n\nMurat Guvendiren, assistant professor, was elected as a senior member in NJIT's Class of 2022 Chapter of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI).\n\nRead more\n\nRecent Publications from Professor McEnnis's Research Group\n\nLópez Ruiz, A.; Villaseco Arribas, E.; McEnnis., K.

York Award\n\nThomas Reardon Stanley S. Grossel Award\n\nRobert Gwiszcz Outstanding Chemical Engineering Senior\n\nThomas Hopper Robert M. Brown Memorial Scholarship\n\n(Pictured L to R: Katherine Gawel, Thomas Hopper, Robert Gwiszcz, Thomas Reardon, James Ligot, Krolina Wakulik and Dr. Reginald Tomkins)\n\nDr. Gennady Gor, Assistant Professor, has published an invited review paper on adsorption-induced deformation of nanoporous materials in the journal Applied Physics Reviews. Nanoporous materials play an important role in many chemical engineering applications, in particular they are used as adsorbents. When fluids get adsorbed in the pores that are only a few nanometers wide, the intermolecular forces between the fluids and solids induce very high pressures. These pressures can reach hundreds of atmospheres and cause noticeable deformations even in stiff solid materials. The review paper discusses a variety of cases where these strains are significant: change of permeation of zeolite membranes, swelling of coal, etc. and presents the state-of-the art theoretical understanding of this phenomenon.\n\nThe paper is available online (open access) at\n\nhttp://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4975001​"
