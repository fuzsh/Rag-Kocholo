        "text": "Duncan Anderson was owner of Lethe estate in St James at the time of his death in 1793 [sic]. He left the estate to his eldest son Robert (born 14/06/1791) with a 500l Jamaican annuity to his wife. His widow remarried, to William Carter. The Chancery case Carter v. Anderson gives details of her claim for non-payment of the annuity.\n\nDuncan Anderson and his wife Catharine had at least 4 children baptised in St James: Jane (born 29/06/1789 and baptised 06/01/1790), Robert (born 14/06/1791 and baptised 30/11/1791, the same as Robert Anderson in 2., above), John (born 08/10/1793 and baptised 06/01/1794) and Catharine Mary (born 11/12/1796 and baptised 13/08/1797). Although the Law Journal cited above states that Duncan Anderson died in 1793 it must have been at a later date given the births of his two youngest children. The Law Journal does not give the name of Duncan Anderson's wife but states her marriage settlement was dated 16/06/1803: William Carter, Bachelor, married Katharine Anderson, Widow, in St Pancras, London, 18/06/1803 when they were both of St Pancras Parish.\n\nJohn Anderson, aged 57, widower, 'no profession', born Jamaica, was living at Kenton Devon in 1851 with his sister Jean age 62 born St James Jamaica, son Robert aged 36 born Marylebone and daughter Anne [or Anna] aged 30 born Burstead [?] Sussex with 3 servants, 2 from Southampton. None of the family has been further traced to date."
