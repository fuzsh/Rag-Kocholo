(more)\n\nThe central theme of this workshop is the analysis and computation of SchrÃ¶dinger operators and applications to nonlinear problems in several areas of Mathematical Physics, Analysis of Partial Differential Equations, Quantum Chemistry, and more. The simplest, most basic example, of such an operator is of the form H = ââ+V on an appropriate Hilbert space, and their Dirac analogues.\n\nMany problems in Quantum Physics and Chemistry require a precise understanding of the spectra of SchrÃ¶dinger operators, H = ââ + V, for various classes of potentials V (x), and in various regimes, especially in the semi-classical and adiabatic ones. The analysis entails determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors and more generally the evolution generated by H, the study of wave operators, and of the âdistorted Fourier transformâ and its mapping properties. All of these can be interpreted as diagonalization procedures which are especially delicate for non-selfadjoint operators that can arise as... (more)\n\nA fundamental challenge that spans nearly all areas of evolutionary biology is the development of effective techniques for analyzing the unprecedented amount of genomic data that has become readily available within the last decade. Such data present specific challenges for the area of phylogenetic inference, which is concerned with estimating the evolutionary relationships among collections of species, populations, or sequences. These challenges include development of evolutionary models that are sufficiently complex to be biologically realistic while remaining computationally tractable; deriving and implementing algorithms to efficiently estimate phylogenetic relationships that use models whose theoretical properties are well-understood and therefore interpretable; and devising ways to scale novel methodology developed to handle datasets that are increasingly large and complex.\n\nThis semester program brings together mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and experimental... (more)\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of unpredictable systems such as turbulent mixing and combustion has been one of the most important and challenging problems in scientific and engineering applications. The validation, verification, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) studies are crucial to achieving reliable and accurate results through high-fidelity multi-physics and multi-scale modeling and simulations. This workshop honors Dr. James Glimm, member of the National Academy of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and winner of the National Medal of Science for his outstanding contributions to computational fluid dynamics.\n\nThe workshop themes include analysis, modeling, and computation of partial differential equations and applications in turbulent mixing and combustion. The workshop will bring together researchers to highlight recent advances and challenges in modeling and simulations of realistic fluid flows. Topics will include: (1) interface instabilities; (2) mixing... (more)"
