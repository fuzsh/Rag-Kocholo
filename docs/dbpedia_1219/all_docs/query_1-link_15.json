        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nThis page has been accessed 4,528 times.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn was born about 1500. He passed away about 1539.\n\nNotes\n\nHe was notary public and clerk of the Diocese of Glasgow in 1539. He left two sons: John and William. In 1547 William was the proprietor of Dowhill.\n\nAnderson: Arms: Argent, a saltire engrailed Sable between four mullets Gules Badge: Out of a wreath of the liveries, an oak tree Proper Branches: Candacraig (Strathdon), Dowhill, Wester Ardbreck Motto: Stand Sure.\n\nGaelic Name: MacGhille Aindrais\n\nThere are two versions of the name Anderson (the Lowland form) and MacAndrew (the Highland version), both mean son of Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. The MacAndrews were renowned for their fighting qualities and were part of the Confederation of Highland clans, the Clan Chattan. There is no chiefly line at present.\n\nOur heritage comes from the Lowland Andersons, who achieved fame in different quarters. Alexander Anderson's early 17th century treaties on geometry and algebra gained European recognition. James Gregory, the inventor of the reflecting telescope, was an Anderson. In 1773, James Anderson from Midlothian, wrote the entry on monsoons for the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, predicting the discoveries to be made by Captain Cook. John Anderson (1726-1796), Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University, invented a way to reduce the recoil in a gun, and helped found one of Scotland's eight universities (Strathclyde University).\n\nThe Anderson Tartan is unique among all of the Scottish tartans. This is because it is the only tartan to have seven colors. All other tartans have six or less. Because of this, the Anderson tartan must be woven on a special loom. The colors are primarily a rich blue with yellow, green and red in the plaid. Three variations exist: The Ancient colors which are derived from the color scheme set mostly by natural old world style dyes, The Modern colors derived from the use of modern chemical dyes and the Muted colors which simulate a \" weathered \" tartan. The Royal Canadian Air Force tartan, which has only five colors, is an officially registered variant of the Clan Anderson tartan. From a distance it is difficult to distinguish between the two.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.geni.com/people/John-Anderson-Sr-Sir/6000000037923046392\n\nhttps://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/castles/stobcross-house"
