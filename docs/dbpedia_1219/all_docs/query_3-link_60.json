        "text": "Following decades in international business, Christine Brown-Quinn embarked on a new career in 2010 to share with aspiring professionals globally, practical, hands-on business strategies to fast track their careers. She‘s been on a mission to bust the myth that a rewarding career and a fulfilling personal life have to be at loggerheads. Known as the ‘Female Capitalist’, Christine unveils what really matters in getting ahead in demanding corporate environments through her webinars, workshops and one-one coaching. As a former managing director in International Finance in London, Christine is well versed in what it takes to forge a thriving career in highly pressurized, alpha environments.\n\nIn March 2020 Christine launched her book Unlock Your Career Success – Knowing the Unwritten Rules Changes Everything, a five-star rated Amazon #1 Best Seller in Business & Finance. According to one reviewer, Michaela Jedinak, a fashion designer and entrepreneur, \"Unlock Your Career Success empowers women with truth-telling facts from the real business world paired with practical advice and insider knowledge that will help you to be promoted to the top. Essential and inspiring reading for every working woman to realize their ambitions and aspirations.”\n\nChristine is an accomplished international speaker and commentator on a range of issues relevant to the success of female professionals through podcasts, blogs, articles, radio & tv shows. Christine has an undergraduate degree in Foreign Languages from Georgetown University (Cum Laude) and an MBA in International Business from the George Washington University (Beta Gamma Sigma scholar). Christine is currently president of the George Washington University Alumni Association and a member of the GW School of Business Dean’s Board of Advisors as well as the Dean’s Diversity Council.\n\nChristophe G. de Taurines is currently the head of business development at Long Harbour LTD, a London-based asset manager.

Under his leadership, Long Harbour developed its UK residential Built-to-Rent platform from less than GBP 300M to over GBP 1.2 bn. in AUM and is currently developing its expansion into continental Europe.\n\nMr. de Taurines has previously served as managing director of European business development and investor relations at Colony Capital; founder and CEO of Capital & Marketing Group, a global capital market agency focused on alternative investments (real estate, infrastructure and corporate private equity), which he sold to LBO France in 2013, becoming a member of its executive committee and a partner of the real estate private funds group of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (now part of Credit Suisse); managing director of LaSalle Investment Management in London; resident vice president at Citibank in the Corporate Real Estate Team; and assistant vice president in the Debt Capital Markets Division of Credit Commercial de France (now part of HSBC).\n\nOver his career, Mr, de Taurines, with his various teams, acted and advised on over €40.0 billion of equity; for over 60 vehicles, attracting investors from around the globe. He is a trustee and member of the Investment Committee of the Saint Martin in the Fields Trust, a member of the Advisory Board of the School of Business of the George Washington University, a past board member of Sussex Place Ventures (the London Business School affiliated venture capital investment manager), and an investor in various ventures, and the past finance chair of the London Chapter of the Young Presidents Organisation.

He speaks English, German and French as a native and is conversational in five other languages.

This event featured a panel discussion from this year's Women that Build award-winners, who advance careers in technology, manage innovation and collaboration, and promote diversity and inclusion. We explored specific challenges they have faced in their careers, and the strategies they have used to overcome them and become extraordinary women that build. This panel included Marie-Philippe Gill, NLP research developer at Croesus, Nelly Ortiz, director of business hacking and U.S. co-lead at Globant, Joti Balani, founder and managing director of Freshriver.ai, and Ellen Joyce, founder and CEO of Digital Leader Academy.\n\nThe panel was moderated by Kathy Korman Frey, professorial lecturer of management and director of the Center For Entrepreneurial Excellence (CFEE) at the GW School of Business. It was also co-moderated by GW students and CFEE Leadership Fellows Lena Ebadi, Alexis Nazitto and Maiah Zaky.\n\nThis event was hosted in partnership with the GW School of Business Dean's Diversity Council and in conjunction with the Howard Hoffman Distinguished Lecture Series presented by the Center for Entrepreneurial Excellence at the GW School of Business.\n\nNelly Ortiz is an international speaker, certified design thinking coach, and award-winning business woman in tech. With a background in consulting and leadership, her career expands over several industries including financial services, retail, and real estate. She is passionate about helping her clients redefine their businesses through innovation, at the intersection of business, technology, and design. Even though Nelly’s background in digital strategy with Fortune 500 companies might suggest her talks are serious in nature, she’s anything but boring! Nelly understands the power of laughter and humor when teaching complex concepts. She even did standup, as she believes comedians are the best public speakers. Event planners love working with Nelly, often describing her as the energizer bunny of their events. Nelly has earned her master’s degree from New York University in integrated marketing (digital and brand), and a business administration title from Los Andes University in Colombia. Her most recent leadership roles have been in technology companies like Globant, Mindtree and IBM. Growing up as a “Navy brat,” Nelly went through 11 schools before college, making her hugely adaptable and eager to keep learning from different cultures. She believes diversity is a great catalyst for innovation. As a Colombian, she gives presentations in both English and Spanish, and as a true Latina she’s loud and claims that dancing is the best sport.\n\nEllen Joyce is the founder and CEO of Digital Leader Academy. Being one of four girls, it makes sense that she ended up in the world of chaos that is startups. Originally from Ireland and being the eldest of four means she has been training to be a CEO her whole life. The Irish “gift of the gab” plus the ability to convince 3 younger sisters to do things they really didn't want to do has prepared her well.\n\nEllen has been an educator her whole life. Her passion is working with students to help them reach their potential. This all began when she started tutoring her younger sister Sarah, who is dyslexic, and it inspired her to start a business that focused on math education for students with learning difficulties while completing her undergraduate degree in computer science and statistics at Trinity College Dublin. She grew the school from 1 student to 50 students and $32k ARR in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, Ellen received a Naughton Scholarship to complete a Masters of Science in Technology Entrepreneurship at the University of Notre Dame. While at Notre Dame, Ellen started to investigate why there are fewer women in computer science in 2020 than there were in 1980 and how could you increase the number of women in tech. This led to her founding Digital Leader Academy (DLA), a startup that is on a mission to increase the size and the diversity of the tech workforce.\n\nThis year, Ellen was invited back to be an adjunct professor at the University of Notre Dame where she is teaching “Technology for Startups” to the next generation of entrepreneurs. It has been an honor to work with so many bright minds and help them start the companies of the future.\n\nBrandon Wales is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) first executive director, serving as the senior career executive helping oversee execution of CISA operations.
