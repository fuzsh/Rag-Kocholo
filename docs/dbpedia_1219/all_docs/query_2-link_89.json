        "text": "This week Jim Adams has prompted us with choosing a song pertaining to Breeze | Cloud | Sky | Wind for this week’sSong Lyric Sunday. I chose “Seminole Wind” by John Anderson.\n\nJohn Anderson is an American country music singer-songwriter from Apopka, Florida. A true Floridian who wrote a song filled with imagination and truth in his native land. The lyrics take us on a journey of the destruction of natural habitat, financial gain, the devastation of the Seminole Indian people and progress. The music video features a large group of Seminole Indian tribes performing with Anderson beside a campfire. Anderson had to get permission from the tribes’ masters before filming could begin on their land.\n\n“Seminole Wind” is a song close to my heart. It was released on August 10, 1992. A few days later, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 14th that would eventually be one of the largest hurricanes to hit the United States. On August 24th, Hurricane Andrew made landfall in south Florida as a powerful Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 165 mph and gusts as high as 174 mph. It is the most destructive hurricane to ever hit Florida in relation to structural damage when it flattened homes from their concrete foundations in Homestead, Florida in, then Dade County. The area is now known as Miami-Dade County. Andrew destroyed over 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, cost over $27.3 billion in damage, and killed 63 people.\n\nWhen Hurricane Andrew devastated south Florida, I was on bedrest (10 weeks at this point) with my third child after multiple times in early labor. I was hooked up to an IV and had to monitor my contractions twice a day, sometimes more. We lived in Brandon, Florida near Tampa at the time and I watched this all unfold on television. It caused a lot of stress as we were not sure if it would pass through the state closer to Tampa. Lucky for us, we got some tropical conditions, but nothing earth shattering and my condition didn’t get any worse.\n\nOn September 17, 1992, I went into labor again, only 3 weeks from my due date at this point so the doctor’s let me go into labor. After 7 hours, I was wheeled into the delivery room. I had an epidural so I was awake and wasn’t in much pain. Upon entering the sterile room, there was a radio playing country music in the background. My doctor asked me if I wanted it turned off. “Not a chance”, I said. At the moment my daughter, Kaela was born, “Seminole Wind” was playing on the radio. She is the only native Floridian in our family and I’ve always believed it was a sign. She blew into our lives the day before my 27th birthday.\n\nIn 2016, “Seminole Wind” was re-issued on a project called Country Grass on Pinecastle Records by the Bluegrass performer Lorraine Jordan & Carolina Road. John Anderson sang the vocals for the release.\n\nSong Facts:\n\nWritten and performed by John Anderson.\n\nReleased on August 10, 1992.\n\nThe fourth single and title track from the album of the same name.\n\nPeaked at #2 on the U.S. Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.\n\nReached #1 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart.\n\nBefore its release as a single, it was included on the “B” side of the album’s second single release “Straight Tequila Nights”.\n\nThe music video was directed by Jim Shea and filmed in the Florida Everglades. It was featured on CMT’s 100 Greatest Videos in 2004 and 2008.\n\nSeminole Wind"
