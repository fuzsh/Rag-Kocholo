        "text": "Administrator and Politician. Born at Eskbank by Dalkeith (Midlothian), and educated at the University of Edinburgh and in Leipzig. Anderson was appointed Chairman of the Board of the Inland Revenue (1919) and Governor of Bengal (1932). Elected Member of Parliament for the Scottish Universities (1938), he served as Home Secretary (1939-40) and Chancellor of the Exchequer (1943-5). The war-time Anderson air-raid shelter is named after him, and he introduced the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system for income tax payment. He was knighted in 1919, awarded the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh in 1944 and raised to the peerage in 1952."
