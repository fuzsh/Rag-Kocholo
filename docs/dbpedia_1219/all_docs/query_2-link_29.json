        "text": "John Anderson was an assistant coach with the University of Colorado basketball team for two years from 2005-07.\n\nAnderson, 48, comes to Boulder from Hillcrest High School in Memphis, Tenn., where he was the head coach from 1987-2005 and compiled a 253-194 record.\n\nAt Colorado, Anderson was responsible for off-campus recruiting, scouting and the Ricardo Patton Basketball Camps.\n\nBringing over 24 years of coaching experience to the Buffaloes, Anderson earned the Tennessee Athletic Coaching Association’s Coach of the Year award three times (1994, 1995, 1996) and the District 16AA Coach of the Year in 1995 and 1996 while at Hillcrest. During the 1993-94 campaign, Anderson coached his team to a 25-0 record to begin the season and a No. 17 national ranking. He left Hillcrest as the school record holder in victories.\n\nWhile at Hillcrest, Anderson coached a pair of former Colorado Buffaloes, Ernest Renfroe (1997-2001) and Leroy Carter (1994-96). During his two years with the Buffs, Anderson coached a pair of former Hillcrest prep athletes, Calvin Williams during the 2005-06 season, and during this past year, incoming freshman Jeremy Williams.\n\n“He and I have been friends for a long time,” said Patton. “I actually offered him a job in 1995, but at the time he was wasn’t prepared to leave Memphis. The time is right now; he spent 18 years at Hillcrest High in Memphis and was ready for a new challenge.\n\n“I think right off the bat he’s going to bring a level of enthusiasm to our team, and that our players will respond right away. Recruiting-wise, he’s well connected in Memphis, a city that is loaded with rising seniors. We’ve been able to establish an identity in Memphis?we’ve had one in years past, but this now makes us even stronger.”\n\nAnderson’s collegiate playing career spanned four seasons at two different schools. He played two seasons at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Ala., where he received Player of the Year honors in 1980 and the Desire to Win award in 1979. At Coahoma Junior College in Clarksdale, Miss. he earned two letters along with the Newcomer of the Year and the team best defensive player awards in 1977.\n\nHe graduated from Stillman College in 1980 with a bachelor of arts degree in health and science physical education, and in 1996 earned his master’s degree in biology from LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis."
