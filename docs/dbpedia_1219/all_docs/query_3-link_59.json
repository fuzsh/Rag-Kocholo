The resource includes advice on how to best implement each assessment, and instructors are encouraged to adapt the items and measures to their own unique context.\n\nNote: 2023 Instructional Resource Award\n\nEffective Study Strategies Exercises in Online or Blended Delivery (2023)\n\nPowerpoint Slides (.pptx)\n\nAuthors: Sue Morris1, Jacquelyn Cranney1, and Carolyn Elizabeth Alchin2\n\nAffiliations: 1School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2School of Psychology and Wellbeing, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia\n\nDescription: This 17-page resource provides instructors with resources and activities they can use to help students reflect on their own study strategies and understand which study strategies are supported by research and which are not.
