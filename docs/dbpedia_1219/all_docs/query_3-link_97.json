        "text": "Fall Semester (9 hours)\n\nPOLS 5030 Introduction to Applied Politics (3 hours) This “Launchpad” course will introduce students to substantive issues and knowledge needed to pursue a career in politics and politically-oriented advertising and public relations. Course material will be integrated with guest lectures by a variety of practitioners from politics and public affairs.\n\nADPR 3860 Introduction to Public Affairs Communications (3 hours) This course describes the field and the role of public affairs and advocacy in shaping public policy, legislation, and politics. Relevant topics include politics and media, ethics, advocacy advertising, and elements of historical campaigns.\n\nPOLS 4150 Research Methods for Political Science (3 hours) This course will be taught with a dedicated Applied Politics section and will focus on helping students develop the tools necessary to engage in applied politics and applied politics research.\n\nSpring, Summer, or next Fall Semester (4-12 hours)\n\nInternship courses may generate anywhere from 4 to 12 hours of course credit depending on the combination of requirements utilized by the professor and student. Internships must be sponsored by the Director of the Applied Politics program and developed with the specific career interests of the student in mind. Students may engage in an internship program affiliated with another body, however, students must register for POLS internship hours (at least 4) in order to meet the curriculum requirements for the Applied Politics track of the Public Affairs Professional Certificate. The core courses in the Applied Politics Program should be completed before the internship portion begins, however, some exceptions may occur and will be determined by the Director of the Applied Politics. Students must meet with the Applied Politics Director in person regarding their internship and assignments prior to registering for internship hours.\n\nThank you to the practitioners who have shared their stories, practical career advice, and best practices in the realm of public affairs and public affairs communications, and to the professors who have shared their research and expertise in the science of politics.\n\n(NOTE: Affiliations are those of the practitioner at the time of their visit.)\n\nAlexa Bankert, Assistant Professor of Political Science, UGA School of Public and International Affairs\n\nJames Beverly, Georgia State House Minority Leader, District 143\n\nJaylen Black, Press Secretary, Abrams for Governor Campaign\n\nMallory Blount, Director of Specialty Media at the White House, Communications Director, Walker for Senate\n\nGreg Bluestein, Political Reporter, Atlanta Journal Constitution\n\nRyan Bowersox, Senior Policy Analyst, Senate Research Office, Georgia State Senate\n\nKaitlyn Branson, Vice President of Operations, War Room Strategies\n\nMeredith Brasher, Communications Consultant\n\nBrendan Buck,Seven Letter, Partner; NBC News Political Analyst; Former aide to House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner\n\nCharles S.
