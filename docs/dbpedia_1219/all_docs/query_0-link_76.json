        "text": "Kurt Vogel Russell was born on March 17, 1951 in Springfield, Massachusetts and raised in Thousand Oaks, California to Louise Julia Russell (née Crone), a dancer & Bing Russell, an actor. He is of English, German, Scottish and Irish descent. His first roles were as a child on television series, including a lead role on the Western series The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (1963). Russell landed a role in the Elvis Presley movie, Ob blond, ob braun... (1963), when he was eleven years old. Walt Disney himself signed Russell to a 10-year contract, and, according to Robert Osborne, he became the studio's top star of the 1970s. Having voiced adult Copper in the animated Disney film Cap und Capper (1981), Russell is one of the few famous child stars in Hollywood who has been able to continue his acting career past his teen years.\n\nKurt spent the early 1970s playing minor league baseball. In 1979, he gave a classic performance as Elvis Presley in John Carpenter's ABC TV movie Elvis - The King (1979), and married the actress who portrayed Priscilla Presley in the film, Season Hubley. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for the role. He followed with roles in a string of well-received films, including Mit einem Bein im Kittchen (1980) and Silkwood (1983), for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. During the 1980s, he starred in several films by director Carpenter; they created some of his best-known roles, including the infamous anti-hero Snake Plissken in the futuristic action film Die Klapperschlange (1981) (and later in its sequel Flucht aus L.A. (1996)), Antarctic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady in the horror film Das Ding aus einer anderen Welt (1982), and Jack Burton in the fantasy film Big Trouble in Little China (1986), all of which have since become cult classics.\n\nIn 1983, he became reacquainted with Goldie Hawn (who appeared with him in The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968)) when they worked together on Swing Shift - Liebe auf Zeit (1984). The two have lived together ever since. They made another film together, Garry Marshall's comedy Overboard - Ein Goldfisch fällt ins Wasser (1987). His other 1980s titles include Rocket Man - Der Beste aller Zeiten (1986), Tequila Sunrise (1988), Winter People - Wie ein Blatt im Wind (1989) and Tango und Cash (1989).\n\nIn 1991, he headlined the firefighter drama Backdraft - Männer, die durchs Feuer gehen (1991), he starred as Wyatt Earp in the Western film Tombstone (1993), and had a starring role as Colonel Jack O'Neil in the science fiction film Stargate (1994). In the mid-2000s, his portrayal of U.S. Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks in Miracle - Das Wunder von Lake Placid (2004) won the praise of critics. In 2006, he appeared in the disaster-thriller Poseidon (2006), and in 2007, in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof - Todsicher (2007) segment from the film Grindhouse (2007). Russell appeared in The Battered Bastards of Baseball (2014), a documentary about his father and the Portland Mavericks, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014. Russell starred in the Western films Bone Tomahawk (2015) and The Hateful 8 (2015), and had a leading role in the dramatization Deepwater Horizon (2016). He also co-starred in the action sequels Fast & Furious 7 (2015) and Fast & Furious 8 (2017).\n\nRussell and Goldie Hawn live on a 72-acre retreat, Home Run Ranch, outside of Aspen. He has two sons, Boston Russell (from his marriage to Hubley) and Wyatt Russell (with Hawn). He also raised Hawn's children, actors Oliver Hudson and Kate Hudson, who consider him their father. Russell is also an avid gun enthusiast, a hunter and a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. He is also an FAA-licensed private pilot holding single/multi-engine and instrument ratings, and is an Honorary Board Member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.\n\nEiza González Reyna is a Mexican actress and singer. She was born on January 30, 1990 in Caborca, Sonora, Mexico, to Carlos González and Glenda Reyna. Her mother is a yesteryear Mexican model. She has one elder brother, Yulen. She lost her father in a motorcycle accident when she was just 12. Later in September 2015, she revealed that due to this trauma, she suffered from compulsive overeating and depression from 15 to 20 years of age.\n\nEiza studied at the 'American School Foundation' and at the 'Edron Academy', both in Mexico City. In 2003, Eiza joined Mexico City based acting school 'M & M Studio', run by renowned actress Patricia Reyes Spíndola. She attended the school till 2004. She was then allowed to take up a three years course at the renowned entertainment educational institution of Televisa, 'Centro de Educación Artística', in Mexico City, when she was 14. It was there that she got noticed by producer-director Pedro Damián.\n\nHer real breakthrough came with an adaptation of Floricienta (2004) titled Lola: Érase una vez (2007), a Televisa produced teen-oriented Mexican melodrama telenovela. Lola: Érase una vez (2007), that premiered in Mexico on February 26, 2007, and ran for two seasons till January 11, 2008, saw her essaying the starring role of Dolores \"Lola\" Valente, the lead female protagonist. As a result of the huge popularity of the show, it was shown in many other countries across Latin America and the US. In spring 2008, she went to New York City with her mother to take up a three months acting course at the 'Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute' and returned to Mexico City upon its completion. That year, cosmetic brand Avon in Mexico selected her as the new face of 'Color Trend de Avon'. EMI Televisa signed a deal with her in late 2008 that led her to release her debut album 'Contracorriente' on November 24, 2009 in Mexico/Latin America through EMI Televisa Music and on January 26, 2010 in the US through Capitol Latin. The album climbed at #13 on the Mexico Top 100 Albums chart. Meanwhile, she shared screen space with Mexican actress Susana González in April 2009 in the episode Tere, desconfiada (2009) from the popular Mexican drama and psychological thriller television series Mujeres asesinas (2008). She essayed the role of Gaby, a teenage antagonist.\n\nShe then landed up with dual roles in the musical tween telenovela Sueña conmigo (2010), as the lead protagonist Clara and her alter-ego Roxy Pop. For filming of the series, she had to stay in Buenos Aires for a year since April 2010, visiting Mexico only during breaks. Produced by Televisa, Illusion Studios and Nickelodeon Latin America, Sueña conmigo (2010) aired on Nickelodeon Latin America from July 20, 2010 to April 1, 2011 covering Mexico, Argentina and other Latin American nations. The popularity of the series led the cast to perform concerts across Argentina between March and July 2011. Her second album 'Te Acordarás de Mí' released digitally on June 5, 2012. It debuted at # 66 on the México Top 100 Albums charts and peaked at #14 on the US Billboard Latin Pop Album chart. The comedy drama flick Casi treinta (2014) that premiered at different film festivals in 2013 marked her debut on big-screen. The film however released in Mexico much later on 22nd August 2014.\n\nHer next big role on TV was that of Nikki Brizz Balvanera, a female protagonist, in the Mexican telenovela Amores verdaderos (2012) that aired on Canal de las Estrellas from September 3, 2012 to May 12, 2013.\n\nShe then went on to play Sheila \"Jetta\" Burns in the 2015 film Jem and the Holograms (2015). Since 2014 she features in the American horror TV series From Dusk Till Dawn (2014) essaying the character of Santanico Pandemonium played by Salma Hayek in the original flick.

She can be seen playing the role of Darling in the action film Baby Driver (2017), released in June 2017.\n\nJude was born in Burlington Vermont on March 11th, 1947. He spent his first three years in Middlebury Vermont where his father coached Football, Basketball and Baseball at Middlebury College. He then moved to Albany, New York, his hometown, where he would spend his formative years. After grade school at St. Catherine of Siena, He graduated from Christian Brothers Academy in 1965. He was an All City and All League first team selection in Football and Basketball, and was a member of the American Legion All Star team, and pitched in every All Star game all three years that he played. In Football he was voted the Most Valuable Player by the members of his HS team and was Captain of the Basketball team. Along with his father, Richard S. Ciccolella and his brother Thomas, Jude has been inducted into to the CBA Hall of Fame. Though as a kid Jude never participated in plays or learned to play a musical instrument and gave no obvious indication that he would make his living in the performing arts, looking back, there were signs along the way. Jude went to the movies a lot with his mother and father and his Aunt Jo, especially loving the swords and sandal epics, the sci-fi and horror films, and, of course, the westerns. He also would always have fantastic costumes designed by his mother for Halloween contests---the Pharaoh, the Monster, the Knight. He sang the tunes from the radio incessantly---trying to imitate the voices. Even in sports, it seemed to matter more that you stood at the plate like Henry Aaron, that you swung the bat like him---exactly---than whether you got a hit. Fantasy! Imitation! It was really at Brown University, though, that Jude discovered his vocation---something that, in hindsight, had been manifesting itself all along. Jude graduated from Brown with a BA in Philosophy and played football. But it was the theater department, headed by Jim Barnhill, that opened up the thespic world to Jude and pointed him toward his life goal. The campus band, Cool Clear Walter, which Jude fronted, was engendered by associations in the Theater Department-Terry Harkin (drums) and the Philosophy Department-Al Musgrave (lead guitar). After two years of social work in Albany, Jude went to Temple University in 1971 and received and MFA in Acting two years later. After a number of years in Philly writing songs, singing in pubs, doing plays, and supporting himself with stage hand work, it was time, finally---late in the game---to hit the BIG APPLE. Since he arrived, one of the lucky ones, he has earned his living on stage and screen for 35 years. For the first seven years it was tough---on call seven days a week while loading trucks to pay the bills---but there was always progress---a break here, a break there. Again, he was one of the lucky ones. He is a member of The Actors Studio and EST and is co-artistic director with Bill Bolender of The Eumenides Group, which has produced three plays in LA. He received a number of best actor awards for a short film (Last Call) which he co-produced with director Robert Bailey. The Jude Ciccolella Band has been playing for eight years in LA, playing the pop music of his generation and original stuff. He is also the composer and performer on five original CDs. Jude is married to the wonderful actress and award winning author Sylva Kelegian. They reside on the coast with their beloved dogs.\n\nKate Bosworth was born in Los Angeles, California, to Patricia (Potter), a homemaker, and Harold Bosworth, who was an executive for Talbots. Unlike the characters Bosworth has portrayed in television and in film, which are known as \"townies\", Kate spent most of her childhood in different cities and states. At age 6, she and her parents moved to San Francisco, then to Connecticut at 9, and to Cohasset, Massachusetts, at 14. It was at 14 that Kate, a champion equestrian, learned of a casting call for a movie about horses.\n\nAlthough Kate attended the open audition in New York for the Robert Redford film Der Pferdeflüsterer (1998) simply in hopes of getting the experience of what it was like to audition for a movie role, she won the role of the female lead's best friend and the chance to work with director/star Robert Redford. Her previous acting experience had consisted of singing at county fairs in California and acting in a community theatre production of \"Annie\". However, since landing the movie role, Kate seemed to be in more sound stages than ranches. Fearful that an early career would rob her of her childhood, she took 18 months off to live a normal life before opting to plunge into acting again. In 2000, she landed the role of the bratty sister in the feature film Newcomers - Neue Freunde (2000) and the part of a football co-captain's girlfriend in the Denzel Washington movie Gegen jede Regel (2000).\n\nThroughout high school, Kate maintained academic excellence and was an honor roll student and a member of National Honor Society. In her spare time, she has volunteered with various non-profit organizations, including a Los Angeles program for physically challenged children who learn to ride horses with assistance.\n\nRugged features and a natural charm have worked for Josh Brolin, the son of actor James Brolin. He has played roles as a policeman, a hunter, and the President of the United States.\n\nBrolin was born February 12, 1968 in Santa Monica, California, to Jane Cameron (Agee), a Texas-born wildlife activist, and James Brolin. Josh was not interested at first in the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents' divorce, and both of them being actors. However, during junior year in high school, he took an acting class to see what it was like. He played Stanley in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and became hooked. His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film Die Goonies (1985), based on a story by Steven Spielberg. He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles on such series as Pilot (1987) and Die jungen Reiter (1989). \"Private Eye\" was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. \"The Young Riders\" was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin's father, James Brolin.\n\nAfter Die jungen Reiter (1989), Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in Roadflower (1994), but the film was not a success. He followed up with the crime film Killer Cops - Mörder in Uniform (1996), the romantic film Das Rosenbett (1996), the thriller film Freeze - Alptraum Nachtwache (1997), and appeared with his father in Brothers in Arms (1997). However, nothing truly stuck out, especially not the box office flop Mod Squad - Cops auf Zeit (1999). The 2000s initially brought no significant change in Brolin's career. He appeared in the independent film Slow Burn - In der Hitze der Wüste (2000), the sci-if thriller Hollow Man - Unsichtbare Gefahr (2000) and starred on the television series Mister Sterling (2003). In 2004, he married actress Diane Lane but later divorced in 2013.\n\nIt was not until 2007 that Brolin received much acclaim for his films. He took a supporting role in the Quentin Tarantino-written Grindhouse (2007) which was a two-part film accounting two horror stories. He also played two policemen that year: corrupt officer Nick Trupo in the crime epic American Gangster (2007), and an honest police chief in the emotional drama Im Tal von Elah (2007) which starred Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by Paul Haggis. However, it was his involvement in No Country for Old Men (2007) that truly pushed him into the limelight. The film, directed by the Coen brothers, was about a man (Brolin) who finds a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. He is pursued by an unstoppable assassin (Javier Bardem, who won an Oscar for his work) and his friend, a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). The film won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nBrolin found high-profile work the next year, being cast as Supervisor Dan White in the film Milk (2008). His performance as the weak and bitter politician earned him an Oscar nomination, and Brolin received more praise for his fascinating portrayal of George W. Bush in the Oliver Stone film W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008). Despite the mediocre success of W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008), he was recognized as the best part of the film, and Milk (2008) was another triumph, critically and commercially.\n\nBrolin then acted in the smaller comedy Women in Trouble (2009) before landing a number of large roles in 2010. The first of these was the film based on the comic book figure Jonah Hex (2010). The film was a box office flop and critically panned, but Brolin also forged a second collaboration with legendary director Oliver Stone for Wall Street: Geld schläft nicht (2010). Brolin played a large role alongside such young stars as Carey Mulligan and Shia LaBeouf, and older thespians such as Michael Douglas, Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella. Brolin's character was Bretton James, a top banker in the film, and also the film's chief antagonist. Brolin also appeared in Woody Allen's London-based film Ich sehe den Mann deiner Träume (2010) and a second collaboration with the Coen Brothers, which was a remake of Der Marshal (1969).\n\nDespite his earlier mediocre success and fame, Brolin has maintained a choosiness in his films and, recently, these choices have paid off profoundly. Hopefully, he continues this streak of good fortune that his talents have finally given him.\n\nPhoebe Mary Waller-Bridge is an English actress, producer, and writer.
