        "text": "What are we celebrating?\n\nStrathclyde is looking forward to a landmark year in 2024, which will see the 60th anniversary of us gaining University status.\n\nThe late Queen Elizabeth II signed the Royal Charter at Balmoral in August 1964, ensuring that what had been the Royal College of Science and Technology would become the first university established in Scotland for nearly 400 years.\n\nStrathclyde had existed as an institution under various names since 1796, but it was the Royal seal which formally brought us into existence and opened the door for the research, learning and teaching, industrial engagement and informing of policy which we continue to practise.\n\nWe have never stood still throughout our history, continually enhancing and evolving the work we do, often leading the way for others to follow. Our campus has also been radically transformed, ensuring our staff and students have the advanced resources and facilities to keep us at the forefront of higher education in Scotland.\n\nThere have been many milestones over the past two and a quarter-centuries. Below, are just a few of the major events in our history."
