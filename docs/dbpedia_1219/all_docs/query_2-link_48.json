        "text": "Was Britain divided about Indian independence, 1930-47?\n\nSource 7\n\nLetter from Mr Clifton H Stephenson to Sir John Anderson MP, 10 March 1947\n\nReference\n\n➜ CHUR 2/43A-B/82-83\n\nSimplified Transcript\n\nTo\n\nThe Right Honourable Sir John Anderson M.P.\n\n(Ex-Governor of Bengal). House of Commons\n\nLondon\n\n‘PERSONAL’\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease excuse me writing to you but I want to state (and I’m sure Europeans throughout India agree) that we read with the keenest interest about the recent debates in Parliament on the Indian Political Situation. The general agreement of most people in India is that the Socialist (Labour) Government has betrayed India by agreeing to leave in India in 1948, while the whole country is in chaos, and has ruined the Honour and the Fair Name of Britain. The Socialist Government have deliberately abandoned all the minorities in India (including the European and Anglo-Indian Communities) to their ultimate fate. The Socialist Government, in the short space of twenty-one months, has succeeded in breaking up the British Empire, and has dragged the Fair Name of Britain through the mire.\n\nMr Churchill said in the House of Commons on 6 March 1941, ‘It is with deep grief that I watch the falling down of the British Empire, with all its glories, and all the services which it has given to the world’. ‘We should do everything we can to stop the ruin and disaster which will follow the disappearance of Britain’s power in the East.’ ‘Let us not make things worse by leaving quickly.’ – This is a terrible accusation of the Socialist Government which has ruined the Fair Name of Britain,\n\n(Image 3)\n\nand has dragged her Honour through the mud.\n\nBritish influence in the East is at its lowest and it’s the fault of the Socialist Government. Will you, dear Sir, send my best regards to that great Englishman and patriot Mr Winston Churchill, and also accept our very sincere and Best Wishes for yourself.\n\nI shall feel grateful, Sir, if you’ll kindly let me know you’ve received this letter.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly\n\nClifton. H. Stephenson\n\n{Bangalore}\n\nSouth India\n\n10 March 1947\n\nOriginal Transcript\n\n[all handwritten]\n\nTo\n\nThe Right Hon’ble [Honourable] Sir John Anderson M.P.\n\n(Ex-Governor of Bengal). House of Commons\n\nLondon\n\n“PERSONAL”\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI trust you will pardon the liberty, I, a stranger, have taken in addressing you, but I should like to state, (and I am sure that I am also expressing the sentiments of Europeans throughout India), that we read with the Keenest interest, the recent debates, both in the “Lords” and in the “Commons”, on the Indian Political Situation. The general consensus of moderate opinion out here, is that the decision of the present Socialist Government to quit India in 1948, while the whole country is in a state of widespread chaos and anarchy, is a shameful and disgraceful act of the blackest treachery and cowardice, and has brought an indelible stain upon the Honour and the Fair Name of Britain. The members of the Socialist Govt, with their eyes wide open, have deliberately abandoned all the Minorities in India, (including the European and anglo-Indian Communities.\n\n2\n\nCommunities), to their ultimate fate. The Socialist Govt, in the short space of 21 months, has succeeded in breaking up the British Empire, and has dragged the Fair Name of Britain through the mire.\n\nThe concluding words of the speech of Mr Winston Churchill in the House of Commons on the 6th March last, when he said “It is with deep grief that I watch the clattering down of the British Empire, with all its glories, and all the services it has rendered to mankind”. “We should do everything in all these circumstances, and exclude no expedient that may help to mitigate the ruin and disaster which will follow the disappearance of Britain’s power in the East”. “Let us at least not add to the pangs by shameful flight, by premature and hurried scuttle, let us not add the pangs of sorrow which many of us feel the taint and smear of shame”. – is an unchallengeable and unanswerable Indictment of the Socialist Govt, which has blackened the Fair Name of Britain,\n\n3\n\nand has dragged her Honour through the Mire.\n\nBritish prestige and Influence throughout the East is at the its lowest ebb, and for all this, the Socialist Govt alone, is responsible. Will you, dear Sir, convey our warmest and respectful regards to that great Englishman and Patriot, Mr Winston Churchill, and also accept our very sincere and Best Wishes for Yourself.\n\nI shall feel grateful, Sir, if you will kindly acknowledge the receipt of this letter, just to know that it has reached you safely\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly\n\nClifton. H. Stephenson\n\n{Bangalore\n\nSouth India}\n\n10th March 1947\n\nWhat is this source?\n\nThis is a letter from Mr Clifton H Stephenson to Sir John Anderson MP, 10 March 1947.\n\nBackground to this source\n\nSir John Anderson had been Governor of Bengal from 1932 to 1937 and was elected to Parliament as an independent MP in 1938. He was well respected by all political parties and was appointed to the Cabinet by both Chamberlain and then Churchill. Stephenson appears to be writing to him because of Anderson’s experience in India and because he was a respected independent politician.\n\nClement Attlee had become Prime Minister in July 1945 after the Labour Party won the General Election held at the end of the Second World War. The Labour Government supported the principle of independence for India and in February 1947 it announced that British India would become fully independent by June 1948 at the latest. The semi-autonomous princely states would decide at a later point whether to join the independent India.\n\nHow can we use this source in the investigation?\n\nRemember, we’re hoping that the source can be useful to us in investigating whether opinion in Britain was divided on the question of Indian independence. The sources can be analysed in two ways:\n\nSurface level\n\nWhy is Stephenson writing to Anderson?\n\nWhat are Stephenson’s views on the decision to grant India independence?\n\nWhy does he think the timing is dangerous?\n\nWho does he quote in his letter and why?\n\nDeeper level\n\nWhich of the inferences below can be made from this source?\n\nOn a scale of 1-5 how far do you agree that this source supports this inference? Which extract(s) from the source support your argument? This letter is useful for showing the views of people in India towards Indian independence. This letter is written by someone in India and so can tell us nothing about views on Indian independence in Britain. Stephenson’s opposition to Indian independence means that this letter is of no use to historians interested in this subject. There is evidence that some people in Britain supported Indian independence. There is evidence that some people in Britain opposed Indian independence.\n\n➜ Download table (PDF)\n\n➜ Download table (Word document)\n\nNeed help interpreting the source?\n\nAnderson had been a civil servant in the Colonial Office before he became an MP and had spent five years as the Governor of Bengal in India – the region that Stephenson lives in.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Anderson was a member of the Cabinet trusted by both Churchill and Attlee.\n\nHe was re-elected as an MP in 1945 but didn’t join Clement Attlee’s government.\n\nExplore the guide to interpreting telegrams\n\n➜ Source 8\n\n➜ Back to sources page"
