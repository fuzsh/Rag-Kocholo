        "text": "From: The News (Frederick, Maryland) Mar 28, 1924\n\nIntriguing comment [excerpt] left by Astri on a previous post about Robert Burns and Auld Lang Syne:\n\nI just discovered at a local Robbie Burns party celebrating his birthday last night, here in western Canada, what I, for 3 or more decades, have loved and sung in Norwegian as an old Norwegian folk song. This is “Jon Anderson, Min Jo”.\n\nLast night at the party, I discovered the English-language song called “John Anderson, my Joe” – to nearly the same tune (some of the ancient natural-scale tones common in the Norwegian folk music had been anglicized or ‘normalized’ according to english folk tunes) and with basically the same verses, in English.\n\nI said to my friend driving home in the car, “I wonder if Burns heard this song and ‘lifted’ it for its beauty and lovely sentiment,” ~ maybe while travelling in Norway, or in a pub meeting Norwegian travellers (brought together by the prospect of beer, ever-alluring to both our peoples, from early days of mead-making and viking-travel, on doubt!)!\n\nIt would be interesting to find out when the Norwegians first started singing this song. Might turn out to be one of those chicken/egg things, but I would be interested in finding out more. I tried searching the Norwegian title, and I only got 2 hits, neither of which gave any information.\n\nThis comment jogged my memory of a temperance poem I had previously posted, which turned out to be a parody of “John Anderson, My Jo.” I decided to see what else I could dig up on this same poem, being it is Robert Burns’ birthday. Evidently, this poem was so popular, it was parodied quite a bit. Below is a sample of what I found:\n\nLooking for a sausage vat picture for this first parody, I was surprised to find the above image actually took me to a blog post about the murder referenced in the parody! Link: Louise Luetgert: The Sausage Vat Murder\n\nRather sick sense of humor, I think:\n\nSAID IN FUN.\n\nJohn Anderson, my Jo, John,\n\nWhen you and I first met\n\nWe loved each other well, John;\n\nBut not, already yet;\n\nWe had a little spat, John,\n\nNot many months ago,\n\nAnd you boiled me in a sausage vat,\n\nJohn Anderson, my Jo.\n\nThe Nebraska State Journal (Lincoln, Nebraska) Oct 21, 1897\n\nSAID IN FUN.\n\nJohn Anderson, my Jo John\n\nWhen we again prepare\n\nTo kill the boar black pigs John,\n\nThat scent the perfumed air,\n\nWe’ll bribe our fellow men, John,\n\nWith cash before we go,\n\nTo haul them to the slaughter pen,\n\nJohn Anderson, my Jo.\n\nThe Nebraska State Journal (Lincoln, Nebraska) Nov 22, 1897\n\nI saw the great regatta go\n\nA half a mile from land;\n\nThe sons of Eli tried to row\n\nTheir boat to beat the band.\n\nThe oars sank deep, the men perspired,\n\nI heard them puff and blow —\n\nToo slow the pace, they lost the race,\n\nJohn Anderson, my jo.\n\nThe Nebraska State Journal (Lincoln, Nebraska) Jul 10, 1909\n\n*****\n\nNow, for a couple of advertisements:\n\nThe Ohio Democrat ( New Philadelphia, Ohio) Oct 18, 1888\n\nSKIDOO!\n\nJohn Anderson, my Jo, John,\n\nWhen last it was we met,\n\nOur winter supply of Coal, John,\n\nHand not been purchased yet.\n\n“It’s time you was skidooing, John,”\n\nI hear all the wise people speak —\n\nThere should be something doing, John,\n\nThen do it now — this week.\n\nNo.2 Chestnut . . . $5.75 the ton\n\nUNION COAL CO. 119 Main St.\n\nThe Fitchburg Sentinel (Fitchburg, Massachusetts) Jun 25, 1906\n\n*****\n\nA political parody:\n\nJOHN C. CALHOUN MY JO.\n\nA COMIC POLITICAL SONG.\n\nTune – “John Anderson my Jo.”\n\nJohn C. Calhoun my Jo John, I’m sorry for your fate,\n\nYou’ve nullify’d the Tariff laws, you’ve nullify’d your State;\n\nYou’ve nullify’d your party, John, and principles, you know,\n\nAnd now you’ve nullified yourself, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nOh! John how could you look into the face of Henry Clay?\n\nThe glory of the Western World, and of the World away;\n\nYou call’d yourself his ‘master,’ John, but that can ne’er be so,\n\nFor he ‘would not own you for a slave,’ John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nThe Father of the Tariff, and patron of the Arts,\n\nHe seeks to build his country up in spite of foreign parts;\n\nAnd Harrison will soon upset the little Van & Co.\n\nAnd renovate the ship of State, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nJohn C. Calhoun my Jo John, ambition in despair\n\nOnce made you nullify the WHOLE, the HALF of it to share;\n\nThe ‘whole hog now you’ve gone,’ John, with Kendall, Blair & Co.’\n\nBut ‘you’ve got the wrong sow by the ear,’ John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nAmerican mechanics, John, will never sell their votes\n\nFor mint drops or for Treasury bills, or even British coats;\n\nThey want no English coaches, John, while servants they forego,\n\nFor their carriage is of Yankee stamp, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nOh! John he is a slippery blade with whom you’ve got to deal,\n\nHe’ll pass between your clutches too, just like a living eel;\n\nYou think he’ll RECOMMEND you, John, but Van will ne’er do so,\n\nFor he wants the fishes for himself, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nJohn C. Calhoun my Jo John, if this you dare to doubt,\n\nGo ask the LIVING SKELETON who deals his secrets out;\n\nHis favorites are marked, John, the mark you cannot toe,\n\nAnd you’ll soon repent the bargain made, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nThis is dirty business, John, go wash your little hands,\n\nAnd never bow your knee again to cunning Van’s commands;\n\n‘How are you off for soap,’ John, I cannot say I know,\n\nBut ‘your mother does not know you’re out’ John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nThe brave sons of the South, John, will never own you more,\n\nAnd Benton’s Mint Drops will not save — you’re rotten to the core;\n\nThe people will no power, John, on such as you bestow,\n\nAnd you’ve jump’d your final sumerset, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nThen better men, my Jo John our sad affairs will fix,\n\nRepublicans in principle, the Whigs of Seventy six;\n\nThe offices they’ll purge, John, Swartwouters all must go,\n\nAnd Sycophantic fellows too, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nThe farmer of North Bend, John, will plough the weeds away,\n\nAnd the terror of Tecumseh then will gain another day;\n\nAmerica will flourish John, mechanics find employ,\n\nAnd our merchants will rejoice indeed, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nJohn C. Calhoun my Jo John, when one term shall expire,\n\nHe’ll drop the reins of power and with dignity retire,\n\nTo look upon a smiling land, that he has rendered so,\n\nAnd every Whig will cry AMEN, John C. Calhoun my Jo.\n\nMIDFORD BARD.\n\nPoet’s Garret, Baltimore, January, 1840.\n\nHuron Reflector (Norwalk, Ohio) Mar 7, 1840\n\nThis last one is not a parody, but rather interesting, if Francis Scott Key actually penned these additional verses:\n\nJOHN ANDERSON MY JO.\n\nA Pipe Creek Man Awakens a Reminiscence of Francis Scott Key.\n\nA correspondent of the Washington Evening Star writes: In your issue of Saturday you publish an added verse to Burns’ “John Anderson, My Jo,” written by a lady from Georgia.\n\nMr. Francis S. Key, the author of the “Star Spangled Banner,” wrote two additional verses to Burns’ poem, and not remembering having seen them published, I send them to you.\n\nMr. Key writes:\n\n“There ought to be another —\n\nJohn Anderson my Jo, John,\n\nFrom that sleep again we’ll wake,\n\nWhen another day’s fair light\n\nOn our opened eyes shall break.\n\nAnd we’ll rise in youth and beauty\n\nTo that bright land to go,\n\nWhere life and love shall last for aye,\n\nJohn Anderson, my Jo\n\nOR\n\nJohn Anderson, my Jo, John,\n\nOne day we’ll waken there,\n\nWhere a brighter morn than ever shone,\n\nOur opened eyes shall cheer.\n\nAnd in fresh youth and beauty\n\nTo that blest land we’ll go\n\nWhere we’ll live and love forever,\n\nJohn Anderson, my Jo.”\n\nPipe Creek, October 13, 1842.
