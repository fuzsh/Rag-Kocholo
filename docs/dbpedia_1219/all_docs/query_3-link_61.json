        "text": "John Anderson\n\n1953 - 2013\n\nObituary by Adrian Joyce, Consultant Urological Surgeon & Past-President of BAUS\n\nJohn Anderson was appointed Consultant Urological Surgeon to Sheffield in 1991 with a special interest in Oncology, particularly the detection and treatment of early prostate cancer and the management of invasive bladder malignancy, having spent a travelling fellowship with Don Skinner in Los Angeles.\n\nJohn's leadership skills immediately became apparent with the instigation and development of a departmental clinical subspecialty approach, allowing him to develop all aspects of urological oncology and its research.\n\nThe man described by The Daily Mail as \"one of the big beasts of open prostate surgery\" has been a national and international presence, guiding standards in urological cancer care for our patients for the last 15 years. His contribution to the field of prostate cancer has been influential and enormous, helping to instigate major MRC trials into the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. For the past 10 years, John has been the Urology Advisor to PCAG (Prostate Cancer Advisory Group), a member of the NCRI Clinical Advisory Boards for Bladder and Prostate Cancer and, in 2005, he became a Trustee and Clinical Advisor to the Prostate Cancer Charity and subsequently Trustee of Prostate Cancer UK. In 1998 he helped form the BAUS Section of Oncology, was subsequently elected as Secretary in 1999 - 2001 and then became Chairman in 2002 - 2004.\n\nJohn was passionately involved with BAUS in all its facets for several years, and his contribution to our association over the last 10 years of his life was ben immense. John took over the \"Best of BAUS\" from Tony Mundy, and I really feel that this title succinctly reflects the stature of the man and the regard with which he is held by this Association, being elected Honorary Secretary Elect and Honorary Secretary in 2007-2009. It was a very proud moment for him when he was elected President in 2010, again recognizing those assets of ability and leadership and, at the March Council Dinner last year, the Trustees and Council acknowledged this achievement with the award of a special medal.\n\nJohn was always keen to promote all aspects of British Urology, whether it was through the BJUI journal, where he served on the Executive Committee, or through teaching and training. John's leadership skills and inciteful comments were much appreciated at the BJUI where he helped to direct the journal into the international arena. He always believed that teaching and training the next generation was an integral part of a Consultant's work and, having helped to set up the original FRCS(Urol) revision course in Sheffield, his greatest delight was delivering the 2-hour Prostate Cancer lecture to \"an audience ... focused on the topic in hand and keen to challenge the lecturer\". I know that he felt he was able to offer a meaningful contribution to their understanding of the subject, and John has always been held in great regard by successive years of trainees.\n\nJohn was very keen to let everyone know that his last year had been the best year of his life in many ways, and he certainly lived it to the full. He died very much as he wanted, at home, with his family around him, and at peace. John was a superb colleague, an inspiration and a great friend and mentor to so many of us; his presence will be sorely missed.\n\nA book of commemoration was available at the 2013 BAUS Annual Meeting for those who wished to send John's family a message, and Sarah requested that any donations be made to John's charity, Prostate Cancer UK.\n\nVisit the Prostate Cancer UK website to make a donation"
