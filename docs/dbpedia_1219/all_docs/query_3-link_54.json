Recommended Prerequisite(s): BIOC 301 or BIOS 301\n\nBIOS 553 - MOLECULAR BASIS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE\n\nShort Title: MOL BASIS: INFECTIOUS DISEASE\n\nDepartment: Biosciences\n\nGrade Mode: Standard Letter\n\nCourse Type: Lecture\n\nCredit Hours: 3\n\nRestrictions: Enrollment is limited to Graduate level students.\n\nCourse Level: Graduate\n\nDescription: BIOS 353/553 is a one-semester course that surveys a representative group of bacterial and viral infectious diseases and the medical countermeasures used to defeat them or in some cases just keep them in check. The course begins with a brief history of how infectious diseases have shaped human history and progresses to present day challenges including emerging pathogens both natural and man-made. We will do deep dives of several important pandemic diseases to understand their epidemiological contexts, pathogenesis and disease states. We will then examine how vaccines, antiviral and antimicrobial strategies work to protect human health at the molecular level. Importantly, we will then examine how molecular evolution provides adaptation to various biomedical interventions and why the fight against infectious diseases cannot be easily won. Graduate/Undergraduate Equivalency: BIOS 353.\n\nBIOS 555 - MOLECULAR MEMBRANE BIOLOGY\n\nShort Title: MOLECULAR MEMBRANE BIOLOGY\n\nDepartment: Biosciences\n\nGrade Mode: Standard Letter\n\nCourse Type: Lecture\n\nCredit Hours: 3\n\nRestrictions: Enrollment is limited to Graduate level students.\n\nCourse Level: Graduate\n\nPrerequisite(s): BIOS 341\n\nDescription: Molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic cell function. Emphasis on detailed, in-depth mechanistic analysis of specific topics related to compartmentalization and membrane related events. Graduate/Undergraduate Equivalency: BIOS 441. Recommended Prerequisite(s): BIOS 301, BIOS 344 Mutually Exclusive: Cannot register for BIOS 555 if student has credit for BIOS 441/NEUR 441.\n\nBIOS 558 - FUNDAMENTALS OF QUANTITATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nShort Title: ENVIRON HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nDepartment: Biosciences\n\nGrade Mode: Standard Letter\n\nCourse Type: Lecture\n\nCredit Hours: 3\n\nRestrictions: Enrollment is limited to Graduate level students.\n\nCourse Level: Graduate\n\nDescription: This course provides a baseline understanding of the fundamental tenets of quantitative environmental health risk assessment as it is practiced in the United States, its associated federal and state regulatory drivers, and current hot topics and trends in health risk assessment. It also provides exposure to some of the quantitative and statistical tools that are used in the practice of environmental health risk assessment.\n\nBIOS 559 - SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\nShort Title: SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS\n\nDepartment: Biosciences\n\nGrade Mode: Standard Letter\n\nCourse Type: Lecture\n\nCredit Hours: 3\n\nRestrictions: Enrollment is limited to Graduate level students.\n\nCourse Level: Graduate\n\nDescription: This course is an exciting review of the methodologies involved in conducting Environmental Impact Assessments according to epistemologies from Sustainable Development. EIAs have to be conducted, before permitting is secured, for large projects and programs; such as power plants, highways, pipelines, dams, mines"
