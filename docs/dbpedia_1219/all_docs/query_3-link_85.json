After working at a nonprofit and then as a paralegal in New York City, Prof. Ehrenreich attended law school at the University of Virginia, where she earned both a J.D. degree (cum laude) and an L.L.M.\n\nAfter completing her L.L.M., Professor Ehrenreich spent nearly two years living in a small village in Togo, West Africa. She speaks Kabiye, the local language of that area, as well as fluent Spanish and rusty French. Upon returning to the United States, she was appointed Co-Director of the Legal Research and Writing program at the University of Virginia School of Law, where she also taught Feminist Legal Theory. In 1989, she accepted her current position at the Sturm College of Law. She was tenured in 1995 and promoted to full professor in 2002. The seminar she offers here on Race, Class, and Reproductive Justice, was one of the first law school courses of its kind in the United States.\n\nProfessor Ehrenreich’s scholarship focuses on the intersection of race and gender, highlighting inequalities in the legal treatment of low-income women of color and other marginalized groups. Her work has been published in many prominent law journals, including the Yale Law Journal, the Duke Law Journal, the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, and the Michigan Journal of Race and Law. Her book, The Reproductive Rights Reader: Law, Medicine, and the Construction of Motherhood, published by NYU Press, has been assigned reading in many law, and non-law, courses around the country.\n\nA leading voice in the legal academy for academic freedom and social justice, Prof. Ehrenreich has served on many working boards focusing on inequality in both law schools and the broader society.

A local songwriter, Crystal Cartier, claimed that Jackson had appropriated the song “Dangerous” from her. Jackson and Hoffman prevailed.\n\nHoffman also represented the former American Basketball Association in its merger with the National Basketball Association.\n\nHe also defended many corporate clients in class-action, antitrust and other cases, including General Electric, Lockheed Martin and Gates Corp.\n\nAmong Hoffman’s many honors were the Colorado State Committee of the American College of Trial Lawyers Lifetime Achievement Award, the American Jewish Committee Judge Learned Hand Award, and the University of Denver Sturm College of Law Outstanding Alumni Award.\n\nDenver Post: Dean Emeritus Daniel Hoffman, LLB'58, dies at 78.

Since leaving SCOL, Kris had been deeply involved in myriad projects which more than expand the scholarship, publications, lectures which marked her tenure at the law school. Finally, she looks forward to a return to Ireland, to lecture and reconnect with colleagues at Trinity, University College and Queens College, Belfast.
