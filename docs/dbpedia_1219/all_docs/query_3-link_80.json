        "text": "Joey Buytendorp, MD (he/him)\n\nMedical school: University of Minnesota\n\nMedical interests: Community health, preventative care, addiction medicine, mental health, health equity and advocacy.\n\nPersonal interests: Improv, soccer, basketball, spending time outdoors, traveling, and cooking new recipes.\n\nWhy North Memorial: I chose UMN North Memorial because of the dedication to providing full-spectrum training through the lens of patient-centered care and health equity. During medical school, I spent a year in the residency program, and there was a palpable sense of community among the residents, staff, and patients. I was a welcomed team member and felt supported throughout my time at Broadway/North Memorial. I am also very excited to continue to learn from the North Minneapolis community and how to positively impact the health of our patients beyond the clinic walls.\n\nSydney Geiger, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical school: University of Minnesota\n\nMedical interests: Health equity, underserved and community medicine, sexual and reproductive health, gender-affirming care, LGBTQ+ care, addiction medicine, immigrant and refugee health, medical Spanish, and minimizing language barriers to care.\n\nPersonal interests: Dancing, walking my dog, watching telenovelas (La Reina del Flow is my favorite), trying new group fitness classes on ClassPass, learning to crochet, and spending time with family and friends.\n\nWhy North Memorial: I chose North Memorial for the community. Getting to know the residents and faculty, it was clear they were passionate about caring for patients of diverse backgrounds, forming strong relationships with the surrounding community, and advocating for health equity. During my medical school rotation at Broadway, I observed residents support one another, and I saw their faces light up when they talked about the program. I knew that the comprehensive and collaborative learning environment at Broadway/North Memorial would help me grow as a physician, advocate, and human being.\n\nReem Ghanem, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical school: University of Minnesota Medical School, Twin Cities\n\nMedical interests: Reproductive health and justice, behavioral health, substance use disorder, and palliative medicine.\n\nPersonal interests: Environmental justice and ethical/sustainable living, social justice, and advocacy. I also love curating memes and hunting for niche music, and I adore animals of all kinds. I enjoy looking at nature (from indoors), writing mediocre poetry, and exploring new foods and restaurants.\n\nWhy North Memorial: In choosing a residency program, it was important to prioritize programs that shared my priorities within medicine. I particularly wanted to find a program that committed itself to social justice and community engagement within and beyond their neighborhood. I wanted a program that \"walked the walk,\" as I've heard some people phrase it—a program that did more than list social justice as a core commitment, but demonstrated a genuine connection to these principles through its curriculum, electives, didactics, and community engagement. I wanted a program where I wouldn't feel like it was exclusively up to me and others of color to push for change and equity against staunch resistance. North Memorial stood out to me because it met all of those needs and more! I saw and heard from administrators and residents the program's commitment to the values of social and racial justice and equitable care, and I felt welcomed rather than isolated, and that was such a lovely experience.\n\nCareer goals: I want to practice full-spectrum family medicine with a special emphasis on engaging with advocacy, social justice, and decolonization within medicine, healthcare, and our broader communities. I'm considering a palliative care fellowship after residency, but I am so open to discovering new passions and goals within family medicine.\n\nDenise Paola Quintanilla, MD, MPH (she/her)\n\nMedical school: University of Minnesota\n\nMedical interests: OB/GYN, sports medicine, addiction medicine.\n\nPersonal interests: Plants, cats, soccer (going to Allianz Field for games), and reading.\n\nWhy North Memorial: I chose North Memorial because I had a wonderful time there during a clinical rotation, the wonderful team dynamic (positive, friendly, supportive), and the diversity of the staff, attendings, patients, and, most importantly, residents.\n\nCareer goals: I would like to work closely with a Spanish-speaking population and provide services to those who do not have access to health care. I hope to do this by addressing social determinants of health and working alongside organizations prioritizing health equity.\n\nPa Ta Xiong, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical school: UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health\n\nMedical interests: Underserved and community medicine, maternal and child health, reproductive justice, preventative health.\n\nPersonal interests: DIY projects, spending time with my family and dogs, going on long walks, practicing mindfulness, football (Go Pack Go!)\n\nWhy North Memorial: The faculty and residents stood out to me most during the interview process. You could sense their commitment to advocacy, community health, and health equity. There was also a great sense of community within the program itself. This, in addition to the curriculum, made me feel that North Memorial was the best place to support me in becoming the community-responsive physician I want to be.\n\nAllison Aase, DO, MPH\n\nMedical school: Kansas City University of Medicine & Biosciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nMedical interests: Sexual and reproductive health, underserved populations, LGBTQ care, community health, academic medicine.\n\nPersonal interests: Running, yoga, pop culture podcasts, downhill skiing, watching movies, and playing with my rescued pitbull named Diva\n\nWhy North Memorial: I was looking for a community program with academic affiliation and fell in love with North Memorial, Broadway Family Medicine Clinic during my med school rotation. The faculty and residents are so supportive, kind, and committed to this community and to health equity. I know I’ll receive high-quality training here that will prepare me to be the best family medicine doctor.

I like to watch cooking shows and classic movies, play video games, stay active, and, most recently, spend time with my new puppy.\n\nWhy North Memorial: North Memorial/Broadway Family Medicine was the perfect match for me throughout the interview process. North Memorial Family Medicine Residency Program is serious about its dedication to the community in North Minneapolis, combating health inequity, and training family medicine doctors that are capable, conscientious, and responsible to their community. I'm confident that in my three years here I will be able to obtain the training necessary for the career I want to have. Finally, seeing as how I have no prior connections to Minneapolis, faculty and my fellow residents have been incredible people to be around, and I feel welcomed and wanted here.\n\nFredrick Blaisdell, MD (he/him)\n\nMedical school: University of Minnesota Medical School Duluth\n\nMedical interests: Underserved medicine, American Indian/Alaska Native/First Nations health, sports medicine, addiction medicine, and community health.\n\nPersonal interests: Ice hockey, ice fishing, river fishing, being outside, enjoying a hot cup of coffee, playing the drums, listening to classic rock (my favorite bands are AC/DC, Metallica, and Pink Floyd), golf (trying to stay within the fairway!), and traditional Anishinabe and Haudenosaunee drumming and singing.\n\nWhy North Memorial: I chose North Memorial Family Medicine Residency Program for its high-quality family medicine training that keeps the local community at the heart and center.

I am also drawn to the program’s commitment to health equity by addressing social determinants of health and meeting patients where they are through community outreach and advocacy.\n\nRuth Kimo, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical school: All Saints University School of Medicine, Roseau, Dominica\n\nMedical interests: Mental health, addiction medicine, underserved medicine, lifestyle medicine, community health, sports medicine, primary care, and health equity.\n\nPersonal interests: Cooking, community outreach, food drives, crafting and sharing recipes, hosting meal events, practicing spiritual disciplines, the color green, watching football (soccer), music, and forming meaningful relationships.\n\nWhy North Memorial: The people! The warmth was palpable! I admire the family-like dynamic that exists at the program as a whole, as well as the top-notch hospitality they show their visitors.

I was met with an immediate and overwhelming understanding that this team, while carrying unique passions, is unified in working for the greater good. There was something intangible and inspiring in everyone I met, and I knew quickly that this is the kind of community in which I want to train and grow.\n\nCareer goals: My goal is to engage in long-lasting relationships with people I see as patients. I have had a strong passion for palliative, hospice, and primary care for many years and would like to act as a bridge for people to engage with either/both philosophies of care when appropriate.
