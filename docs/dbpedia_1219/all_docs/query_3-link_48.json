        "text": "MARIO EDEN, Dean\n\nMARIA AUAD, Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Faculty Development\n\nDEAN HENDRIX, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies and Program Assessment\n\nALLAN DAVID, Associate Dean for Research\n\nJANET MOORE, Assistant Dean for Student Services\n\nENGINEERS ARE FACED with worldwide problems and expectations awesome in responsibility, yet exciting as professional challenges. These range from the extremes of interplanetary exploration through earth orbiting systems to the problems arising from our population explosion: energy, better productivity, housing, transportation and environmental issues.\n\nAs a renewed appreciation develops for the contributions of science and technology, engineering leaders are calling for engineers who are better equipped to tackle the specific, technical problems of the future. They also are calling for engineers who by breadth of education and understanding of other disciplines can convince others of the role of engineers not only in technical matters but in policy decisions to ensure the use of technology to benefit mankind.\n\nEngineering education at Auburn provides in a four-year curriculum both the technical knowledge and the broad general education necessary to equip engineers for their problem-solving challenges. Centered on mathematics and the physical sciences, the curricula also stress the importance of social sciences, humanities and communication skills. Auburn’s engineering programs enable individuals to develop their natural talents and provide knowledge, skills and understanding that will help them to find their places in society as well as in their vocations.\n\nAdmission\n\nFreshmen eligibility is determined by the Office of Enrollment Services. However, since the requirements for engineering education necessitate high school preparatory work of high intellectual quality and of considerable breadth, the following program is recommended as minimum preparation: English, four units; mathematics (including algebra, geometry, and trigonometry), four units; chemistry, one unit; history, literature, social science, two or three units. Calculus, physics and foreign languages are recommended but not required.\n\nTransfers from other institutions must apply through the Office of Enrollment Services. The exact placement in courses can be determined only upon review of the student's transcript by the Samuel Ginn College of Engineering. See Admission of Transfer Students for complete requirements.\n\nThe college allows credit for courses completed with satisfactory grades provided the courses correspond in time and content to courses offered at Auburn. Courses that are taught at the 3000-level or higher at Auburn are generally not transferable from junior colleges.\n\nMany courses required by the Samuel Ginn College of Engineering are highly specialized in their content and potential transfer students need to select courses with care. Therefore, to ensure maximum transferability of credits, students are encouraged to contact the College as soon as possible about acceptable credits.\n\nTransfers from on-campus must be approved by the Samuel Ginn College of Engineering. The requirements for a student to advance from the pre-engineering program into an engineering curriculum are subsequently described in the “Scholastic Requirements” section.\n\nPrograms\n\nPre-Engineering\n\nThe Pre-Engineering Program consists of a freshman program of studies to prepare students for curricula in the Samuel Ginn College of Engineering. Students are provided with academic guidance and support to assist students in determining the curriculum that best fulfills their personal and educational objectives.\n\nPre-engineering students are eligible to move into a major upon successful completion of the academic requirements specified for each degree program. These minimum academic requirements must be completed within four resident semesters, not including the summer term between the freshman and sophomore years.\n\nAerospace, Biosystems*, Materials, & Mechanical Engineering\n\nUnadjusted Cumulative Auburn GPA of 2.0\n\nComplete the following pre-engineering courses with a grade of “C” or better:\n\nCalculus I (MATH 1610), Calculus II (MATH 1620), Chemistry (CHEM 1030 or CHEM 1110), Engineering Physics (PHYS 1600), Intro to Engineering (ENGR 1110), Engineering Orientation (ENGR 1100), Introduction to Computing: MATLAB (COMP 1230)\n\n*includes Bioprocess, Ecological, and Forestry Engineering majors\n\nCivil, Industrial & Systems, & Electrical Engineering\n\nUnadjusted Cumulative Auburn GPA of 2.0\n\nComplete the following pre-engineering courses with a grade of “C” or better:\n\nCalculus I (MATH 1610), Calculus II (MATH 1620), Chemistry (CHEM 1030 or CHEM 1110), Engineering Physics (PHYS 1600), Intro to Engineering (ENGR 1110), Engineering Orientation (ENGR 1100), Introduction to Computing: PYTHON (COMP 1220)\n\nChemical Engineering\n\nUnadjusted Cumulative Auburn GPA of 2.0\n\nComplete the following pre-engineering courses with a grade of “C” or better:\n\nCalculus I (MATH 1610), Calculus II (MATH 1620), Chemistry I (CHEM 1110/CHEM 1111 or CHEM 1030/CHEM 1031) Chemistry II (CHEM 1120/CHEM 1121 or CHEM 1040/CHEM 1041), Intro to Engineering (ENGR 1110), Engineering Orientation (ENGR 1100)\n\nComputer Engineering\n\nUnadjusted Cumulative Auburn GPA of 2.0\n\nComplete the following pre-engineering courses with a grade of “C” or better:\n\nCalculus I (MATH 1610), Calculus II (MATH 1620), Chemistry (CHEM 1030 or CHEM 1110), Engineering Physics (PHYS 1600), Intro to Engineering (ENGR 1110), Engineering Orientation (ENGR 1100), Introduction to Computing: JAVA (COMP 1210)\n\nComputer Science, Software Engineering\n\nUnadjusted Cumulative Auburn GPA of 2.0\n\nComplete the following pre-engineering courses with a grade of “C” or better:\n\nCalculus I (MATH 1610), Discrete Structures (COMP 2240), Approved Degree-Applicable Lab Science* Engineering Orientation (ENGR 1100), Intro to Engineering (ENGR 1110), and Introduction to Computing: JAVA (COMP 1210)\n\n*BIOL 1020/BIOL 1021 or CHEM 1030/CHEM 1031 or PHYS 1600\n\nProfessional Programs\n\nThe following undergraduate engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET: Aerospace Engineering, Biosystems Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Materials Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Polymer and Fiber Engineering, and Software Engineering.\n\nThe undergraduate Computer Science program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET.\n\nThese curricula are designed to meet the educational requirements of the engineering professions.
