        "text": "My name is John Wesley Anderson. I am a former homicide detective, turned full-time author after retiring from a 30-year law enforcement career. I hold an MBA, from Regis University, and am the author of seven published books.\n\nI began my law enforcement career with the Colorado Springs Police Department in 1972, which is where I first met the legendary Detective Lou Smit. I eventually became one of Louâ€™s detective partners and we worked major investigations together for over six years. I taught entry-level to advanced criminal investigation courses, was president of two forensic science organizations and became court qualified as an expert in forensics including bloodstain pattern interpretation and crime scene reconstruction.\n\nIn 1995 I retired from the police department, at the rank of sergeant, when I was elected Sheriff for El Paso County, Colorado. On my first day in office I appointed Lou Smit to be my Captain of Detectives and put him in charge of the unsolved kidnapping-murder investigation of 13-year-old Heather Dawn Church. Within four months, Lou and his team had made an arrest in the 4-year-old cold case. The suspect pled guilty to two counts of 1st Degree Murder and is currently serving two life sentences. Three months after the murder of JonBenÃ©t Ramsey, I was asked by Alex Hunter, the Boulder District Attorney, if I would recommend he hire Lou Smit to be a detective with the Boulder DAâ€™s Office Ramsey Task Force. I strongly encouraged DA Hunter to hire Lou and shared that I consider Lou to be the best detective I have ever met. Lou was my best friend and served as best man at my wedding in 1997.\n\nIn 2003 I retired after a 30-year law enforcement career and was employed for 10 years by the Lockheed Martin Corporation. In 2012 I retired from the corporate world to become a fulltime author.\n\nIn 2018 the Historic Preservation Alliance of Colorado Springs presented me with the Literary Award for Excellence and was also honored to receive the Friends of the Pikes Peak Library District 2022 Golden Quill Award.\n\nA to Z Coloradoâ€™s Nearly Forgotten History 1776-1876 (nonfiction, first printing September 2021, hardcover, 324 pages, over 500 copies sold).\n\nSherlock Holmes in Little London, 1896 The Missing Year (mystery, first printing October 2020, hardcover, 318 pages, 250-350 copies sold).\n\nZacBox and the Pearls of Pleiades (science fiction, YA, first printing July 2020, softcover, 308 pages, 150-200 copies sold).\n\nR.S.
