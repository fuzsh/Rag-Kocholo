Use arrow keys to navigate.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe Bachelor of Science in Architecture degree offers a rigorous sequence of STEM-designated courses, providing students with a solid foundation of math, science, and physics. Since architects’ lead projects using engineers as consultants, they must know technical and engineering concepts and principles, understand structures, building systems (mechanical, electrical, plumbing, daylighting principles and system design) and go beyond the core curriculum to ensure they are well-prepared to lead architectural projects and collaborate effectively.\n\nOur architecture-driven curriculum and studio-based experiences will develop your capacity for design thinking. You will leverage creative thinking as a tool in rapidly expanding fields.\n\nApply Download Program Flyer Request More Information\n\nAbout the Program\n\nWe deliver a 21st-century education building on timeless principles while engaging with current, emerging, and projected trends. Motivated 2nd-year ARCH students who aspire to become licensed professional architects have the option to participate in the Integrated Path to Architecture Licensure (iPAL) program to simultaneously pursue the three essential components for licensure, i.e., Education (Accredited degree), Experience (AXP), and Examination (ARE 5.0), thereby reducing the overall time required to obtain an architectural license. The curriculum requires all 3rd-year undergraduate students to study away from the Texas A&M Main Campus for one semester. Students can elect to participate in an internship or study abroad program to gain global architecture and design perspectives. The Bachelor of Science in Architecture prepares graduates to continue their professional education through a NAAB-accredited Master of Architecture program.\n\nAreas of Emphasis\n\n* Students interested in professional architecture registration must complete a National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB) accredited Master of Architecture program after completing the four-year undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Architecture degree.\n\n** Salary ranges estimated from PayScale.\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe Bachelor of Science in Architecture is a 120-credit-hour degree organized over the course of eight semesters. Coursework encourages multidisciplinary and comparative perspectives, communication skills, and team-oriented methods of production. Knowledge gained in the core curriculum is complemented by learning by doing in the design studio sequences.\n\nStudents often supplement their degree plans with minors offered through the department, including art and architectural history; sustainable architecture and planning; architectural fabrication and product design; and architectural heritage conservation.\n\nDegree Plan 2023–2024\n\nAll students are placed on the current catalog when they enter the Department of Architecture.

There is no way to overlap to get ahead with studio courses as they are meant to be taken in sequential order. Your degree’s completion time will depend on your AP, transfer, or dual credits and overall academic performance, but typically takes at least four years.\n\nDesign Studios\n\nThe design studio sequence encourages individual exploration, research, and team-based collaboration through project-based learning and application. Students learn and develop skills through a variety of theoretical, experimental, and practical design projects. Design studio projects place a shared emphasis on the:\n\nTechnical and expressive content of design work\n\nProcesses used to research, synthesize and document design ideas\n\nCreation of tangible, high-quality products\n\nRead our studio culture philosophy\n\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmission to our architecture program is offered to students seeking a bachelor’s degree and who meet the Texas A&M University’s entrance requirements.\n\nApply\n\nFAQ about the admission process\n\nIs a portfolio required to apply?\n\nNo.\n\nDo you accept transfer students?\n\nYes. However, it can take up to eight semesters (4 years) to complete the environmental design program after transferring because it requires a studio sequence. There is no way to overlap to get ahead with studio courses as they are meant to be taken in sequential order. Departments may offer summer studio courses to accelerate a program.\n\nHow does the admission process work?\n\nSubmit your application to Texas A&M University through ApplyTexas or Coalition. Select Architecture as your intended major in your application.\n\nHow much does it cost to attend?\n\nThe cost to attend varies depending on a variety of factors, including semester of admission, student type, how many hours you take per semester, and rate type. Additional costs to consider include course materials, housing, meal plans, parking, and fees.\n\nFor a better understanding of your total cost of attendance, please visit the Texas A&M University cost and tuition rates webpage. This webpage will provide you with an opportunity to review estimated cost of attendance information for undergraduate, graduate and professional students, as well as other resources such as the tuition calculator and billing and fee explanations.\n\nWhat kinds of financial aid does the program offer?\n\nNumerous scholarships and financial aid are available through Texas A&M University, the School of Architecture, and the Department of Architecture. Incoming freshmen applicants are considered for university scholarships through the ApplyTexas Application or the Coalition Application. Continuing students can apply for additional scholarships through the University Scholarship Application for Continuing Students or through our departmental scholarship application process.
