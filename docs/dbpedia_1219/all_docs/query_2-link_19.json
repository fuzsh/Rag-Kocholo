        "text": "Ava Anderson, Viscountess Waverley (1896-1974) was the only daughter among four children of John Edward Courtenay Bodley (1853-1925) and his first wife Evelyn Frances Bodley. Her childhood years were spent dividing her time between France and England in the company of her father's wide circle of friends drawn from political, literary and academic spheres.\n\nIn 1925 she married Ralph Follet Wigram (1890-1936), First Secretary at the British Embassy in Paris. In 1927 Wigram was diagnosed with infantile paralysis, a condition that left him reliant on walking sticks and often in considerable pain. In 1929 Ava gave birth to her only child, Charley. Born severely disabled, he required constant care until his death in 1951. In 1933 the Wigrams returned to London following Ralph's appointment as a Counsellor in the Foreign Office. In December 1936 Wigram suddenly died of a haemorrhage.\n\nAva now devoted her time to caring for her son and continuing to enhance her reputation as one of London's premier hostesses. It was through her ability to draw the most sought after guests to her home that she first met Sir John Anderson, the newly elected independent MP for the Scottish Universities and former governor of Bengal, in 1938. In October 1941 she married Anderson (now Lord President of the Council in the Churchill coalition government). Throughout the war Anderson continued to rise through the cabinet ranks culminating in his service as Chancellor of the Exchequer, 1943-5. Anderson left office upon the defeat of the Churchill government in the 1945 General Election but remained an MP until the abolition of the university seats in 1950.\n\nIn 1946 Anderson accepted the chairmanship of the Port of London Authority, a role in which he was greatly aided by Ava. The couples' river cruises, almost exclusively organised by Ava, soon became a highlight of the London social scene attracting prominent guests from all over the world and greatly enhancing the reputation of the Port of London. In 1952 Anderson was created 1st Viscount Waverley of Westdean. He died in 1958.\n\nAva was not only renowned as hostess but also as a correspondent of the highest discretion, a service greatly valued by Harold Macmillan during his Premiership. Ava was a passionate follower of opera and ballet, serving as a Trustee of the Royal Ballet Benevolent Fund and as a Member of Council of the Friends of Covent Garden. She was also a keen bloodhound breeder."
