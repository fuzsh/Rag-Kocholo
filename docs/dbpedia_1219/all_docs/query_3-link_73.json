There is a paucity of literature on the unification of the radiological hallmarks of spondylolisthesis and how it guides interventional and surgical evaluation and management. The pathophysiology of degenerative spondylolisthesis is a subject of controversy. It is theorized that degeneration of the facets and discs can lead to segmental instability, leading to displacement over time. Kirkaldy-Willis divided degenerative spondylolisthesis into three phases: phase of dysfunction, a stage of functional abnormalities with minimal anatomic changes; phase of instability, involving further degeneration of disc, facets, and ligaments; finally, phase of re-stabilization, through osteophytes and fibrosis formation of the facets and intervertebral disc.\n\nFaculty in this webinar will identify, display, and discuss the radiographical features that can be seen on x-ray, CT and MRI, with the intention to establish a timeline on which they clinically present. These features are routinely used in a spine clinic to assist with the diagnosis of spondylolisthesis and guide management. They consist of common structural and degenerative changes within the facet joints, posterior ligamentous complex, and the intervertebral disc. These features include: (1) Facet Morphology/Arthropathy, (2) Facet Effusion, (3) Facet Vacuum, (4) Synovial Cyst, (5) Vacuum disc and (6) Interspinous Ligament as markers of dysfunction, instability, and/or re-stabilization.\n\nIn this webinar, we will increase awareness of these radiographical markers, placing them within the framework of the currently accepted model of degenerative spondylolisthesis to help guide future research and treatment guidelines. To this aim, we will assemble a multi-disciplinary context of the current state of literature on degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.\n\nChair\n\nKush Goyal, MD\n\nFaculty\n\nArvin Saremi, MD, MS\n\nRick Kinser, MDT\n\nR.

Depending on individual preferences and practice patterns, spine surgeons take on various levels of responsibility for the supervision, interpretation and technical performance of IONM, often without knowing these guidelines and standards exist. Deviations from guidelines and standards on the part of the surgeon are often documented by the IONM team for their medicolegal protection, potentially increasing exposure for the surgeon. Additionally, hospital policies and procedures that constrain the practice of IONM can reduce patient safety and result in additional unanticipated medicolegal exposure. This session will address the most common questions the IONM Section gets from the NASS community. Faculty are experts in IONM guidelines and standards, clinical practice patterns and closed claims involving IONM and spine surgery. Attendees are encouraged to share their experiences and perspectives in what we expect will be a lively Q&A.

As a result, we may not have an understanding of the science and physics behind MR imaging and the various pulse sequences that are available for obtaining the scans. Many of us prefer to read our patients’ MR imaging studies ourselves rather than rely solely on the “official” radiologist’s report. We learn to make preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative decisions based on those readings. However, unlike radiologists who are trained to evaluate MRI studies in a systematic fashion, we may be more likely to evaluate the images in a less organized manner and to rely on our anatomic expertise and experience, which may not be the most effective method.\n\nThis online course teaches spine specialists how to systematically evaluate and interpret MR imaging studies of the spine. Although there are many courses that focus on MR imaging of the spine, this one is distinctive in that it is given by spine surgeons and radiologists specifically for spine specialists.
