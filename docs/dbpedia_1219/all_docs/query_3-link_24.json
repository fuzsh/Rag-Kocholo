        "text": "Sondhi:\n\nSo Phil, let’s start off by asking, at what stage did you become interested in science? Could you tell us about some formative influences?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI can’t remember a time when I wasn’t interested in science. We lived in a house where my father was a scientist and my grandfather had been a kind of scientist, he was a teacher of mathematics. And the house was full of books and I was just fascinated by the books. There was a four-volume geology book and a three-volume book about natural history. I don’t remember who they were by, but what I do remember is that the opinions expressed there were terribly old fashioned and now are all obsolete, but they fascinated me because they tried to explain. They had a picture of this pile of clay which you squeezed and mountains came up, and things like that. No, I can’t remember when I wasn’t. If I could interject something, one of the really big influences in my life is very simple. If you remember Shaw’s Preface to Pygmalion, he says, every man who amounts to anything turns out to have a strong woman for a mother, and I had a strong woman for a mother, although, as far as I remember neither parent ever laid a hand on me. I was scared to death not to achieve adequately, and that was very effective in directing my efforts at least as far as schoolwork was concerned. Essentially the Andersons, and particularly the Osbornes, always got A’s and I did not intend to be the one who got the first B. So this went back to my uncle who had been a Rhodes scholar, and before him was my grandfather who was a professor of mathematics in a small college. So achievement was assumed rather than enforced. So I can’t remember when I wasn’t interested in science. My father, of course, encouraged me. He built up for me a chemistry set full of substances which we would no longer be allowed to have in the home, from which I tried to make fireworks unsuccessfully, things like that. I generated hydrogen in the basement with it and fortunately didn’t blow myself up. And he encouraged me to collect butterflies and to identify plants, things like that. So there was some encouragement, but I didn’t need much.\n\nSondhi:\n\nDo you feel that the science education that you had in school helped you towards developing your interest in science?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, I can’t really quite ask, “What science education?”, in fact there was at least one rather good teacher. My school of course was the University High School, which was a very, very good school not because it was experimental, which it became later, but because it was an absolutely traditional school that was taught by better teachers, by university quality teachers instead of conventional teachers. And the practice teachers, kids from the education department, couldn’t really ruin what their professors did. So we tended to learn pretty well and we were very competitive because there were special admissions, not very difficult, but there were admissions requirements for the school. (and a ridiculously small fee) At the grade school I think the main thing was resistance to whatever they did to us, but when I got to high school things were very different. I had a wonderful math teacher who was really great, and a very sympathetic biology teacher. There was a famous physics teacher who was a state-award-winning teacher but who was terrible. He was totally qualitative and turned me off to physics entirely and I disliked physics, I went to Harvard intending to be in mathematics or chemistry. I said earlier, what’s important in people’s lives is really the group that they socialize in, their group of peers. There was one group, I remember one particular group of peers, a group of five of us at one time, one of us called it The Five in some pejorative sense or whatever. We weren’t. We were five friends that hung around together. Three of us were from Uni High, two of us the local high school, Urbana High, but we were clearly probably the brightest kids in each of the two schools, and somehow we congealed around a girl (who was really a kind of mascot-she was younger). It was her mother that was important because her family had the only, probably the only really good hi-fi in all of Urbana, Illinois, we had tried to learn classical music from the public broadcasts, which were just awful in those days. We’d go there and listen to records and we’d socialize together and we had a little string quartet, we organized with the sister of one of the guys. And we all became scientists in one field or another. Philip Thompson I believe was one of the real pioneers in meteorology. He worked with John von Neumann. He suffered from alcoholism later on. The others were fairly successful in their own fields.\n\nColeman:\n\nWhat was it like to be at home? What was the nature of your interaction with your parents?\n\nAnderson:\n\nReally quite good. I was kind of precocious. I was a little younger than some of my classmates, but I had a very fine setup, a second social group that was important was something called the Saturday Hikers. The University of Illinois has a really unique group of professors who went out every Saturday, rain or shine or snow. They went out into the countryside which you wouldn’t believe there was near Urbana, Illinois but there was then, and they would find pastures or woods or wherever and they set up their softball diamonds and play some baseball and have a campfire. They had collected a set of equipment, coffee pots, jugs for water, and so on. And this group was, at the time I was growing up, was really the most powerful men on the local campus, the head of the Classics Department, the head of Physical Chemistry, the Provost named Griffith. The head of Political Science, etc. And there was a ladies adjunct that often went out on Sundays, and of course the kids were not allowed on Saturdays, only on Sundays. And I would sit back in the corner and listen to them talk around the campfire and get some idea of what university politics was like, or I would sit very quietly in the backseat and listen to the discussion. Then we vacationed with this group, spent three summers in the Tetons, and I remember we met some of them in Northern Italy the year when we went to England and we traveled around and saw The Last Supper and other places. So that was an important part of growing up. It made me used to being around very, very bright people. One of the members of the Saturday Hikers of course was, Wheeler Loomis, who was the famous, well known head of the Physics Department. He started with a moderate-Middle-Western-Big-Ten type department of aging professors who didn’t do quantum mechanics. He made it into a leading department. He just basically took any graduate students Fermi had and hired them. And then when he realized he couldn’t hold onto the particle physicists, instead he hired Seitz and Bardeen, and that was a pretty good move too. He was a very savvy, intelligent man. He told my parents I damn well had better take first year physics because I could never replace it. That’s what got me into physics.\n\nColeman:\n\nActually, before we get to Harvard, are there aspects of sort of having grown up in a Nirvana, to sort of put it in sort of somewhat stereotypical concept, small college town in the Midwest that you feel has had a formative influence on how you’ve [???]\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, just that it had Uni High. Uni High was a very good high school and this group of very bright kids. I mean I can talk about the three of us from Uni High actually there were three scholarship winners in my year.\n\nColeman:\n\nCan you mention their names actually?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWendell Lehmann, who is here in Princeton as a matter of fact. He is one of the founders of Princeton Instruments Company, along with Bob Dicke, and he’s the one who took the millions of dollars that he earned and quit, retired too... you probably know him and know his wife. He retired to play golf and enjoy himself in Princeton. Then another was Pierre Noyes, who is notorious if you ever have been at Stanford because he’s about half completely wacky and half a very bright guy. I roomed with him in college, so I know him very well. He was always in some ways a support and in some ways a terrible problem. He made a big thing out of being a radical. That was his only recourse. He didn’t have the personality that attracted people, so instead he would spout radical slogans. And eventually he grew into radicalism. I don’t think he was to begin with, but he gradually grew into it and became notorious for suing the government about the death penalty and various other things. It’s not that he wasn’t bright in many cases, but he talked much more radical than he actually was. He never actually belonged to the Communist party, but talked as though he did.\n\nSondhi:\n\nBefore we move onto your period at Harvard, perhaps I could ask you one last question about your childhood. You’ve often said that going on sabbatical with your parents made a big difference in your view of the world. Could you comment a little bit on that?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, yes. It was fun. It was great because I was exactly the right age when I saw a lot of things.\n\nChandra:\n\nHow old were you?\n\nAnderson:\n\n13. I appreciated a lot of things. At least more than what I would have been expected to, although I didn’t have some kind of artistic epiphany. But I got to know Perpendicular from Early English and things like that. I got to know the geography of Europe very well, visited the Paris Exposition. We drove all the way to Sophia, so I learned about Eastern Europe, what the difference between Eastern Europe and England was.\n\nChandra:\n\nYour sabbatical was based in England?\n\nAnderson:\n\nYes.\n\nChandra:\n\nWhere?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNowhere in particular. My father spent a couple of months in London visiting Kew Gardens, visiting various experiment stations nearby. But he was visiting all kinds of places all over England and the continent.\n\nChandra:\n\nSo did you go to school that year?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNo, I didn’t go to school at all, at least in the spring semester. I had skipped a year the previous year because I had taken this sub-Freshman skipping program at Uni High. And then the year after that they simply gave me some class work to do for my second semester. They were very tolerant. I passed some kind of set of exams when I got back. So I skipped basically a year and a half of school. And I didn’t miss anything. The other thing which was very important to my political orientation and understanding because my parents were very conscious about it, we talked to a lot of people in Holland and in particularly Germany, people who were still speaking out to a certain extent about the regime, and I was reading about the internment of Jews very much. So I was overly conscious of it. I never understood how anyone who was living through that period could not have been conscious of what the Holocaust was about. Some pretend that they were not conscious and I can’t forgive that.\n\nColeman:\n\nSo moving on to your coming to Harvard, describe a little bit what it was like for you to reach there?\n\nAnderson:\n\nMiserable. Well, I was sixteen. I arrived at Harvard at sixteen. Most of my classmates were 18 of course, and most of the great majority of them were from Eastern Prep Schools. Only about 15% were kind of in the club system and social, real social. So that was the problem. Most all of us who went to Harvard, 80% of the students, ignored the club system. The clubs were very proud of themselves, but they didn’t control the student body. But the Eastern prep school system did control the student body, and we were the first generation, first in the sense of students who came in on the national scholarship system which had been established only five years before. We were the first generation of kids to go strictly need-blind to the major Eastern schools, and I had a need-blind scholarship. They figured what my parents could afford, by scraping, about $500 dollars a year, the rest was paid, which wasn’t that much. The rest was paid by scholarship. So I wasn’t poor, that was not serious. We were in the kind of living quarters suites that were reserved for the kids from South Boston who came on scholarships. I was not really needy, was just socially incredibly naïve and young. You know, there others in the same position. So for the first year I was feeling pretty lonely. I grew up between that year and the next, and the next two years I had a wonderful time. Not as great a time as I had in graduate school, but I was mature enough to really relax a little bit. The first year I took many too many courses. That was on Wheeler Loomis’ advice. I would take five courses my first year and then we would coast the rest of the time. That was a terrible mistake coming from the Middle West. I had never learned to study. I had never learned to take notes from my reading. Boy, we had a real history course, it was not high school history. That was hard. I just barely scraped by with an A-. That scared me to death that I was going to get a B in that. I didn’t work on French, and I did get a couple of Bs. In the end I think my transcript reads eight A pluses, two A minuses, and the rest Bs. It was very bimodal.\n\nColeman:\n\nDuring this first year when you said you felt somewhat under siege. What were the sorts of things that allowed you to keep in touch?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell you know, I just found physics and math very easy. I had good math training, and physics was just well taught. So after a couple of sessions of worrying about I was catching on and understanding it, it suddenly became very easy. So I relaxed in physics and math and worked on the other courses. Of course that first course in physics was so beautifully taught that really was my fate was sealed from that point on…\n\nColeman:\n\nWho taught the course?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWendell Furry. He was a wonderful teacher. Everything about him Jeremy Bernstein says in his autobiography was right. That was really kind of a tragic loss. He was destroyed by the simultaneous arrival of the Un-American Activities Committee and of Schwinger, and I think that they were twin blows. I mean Schwinger was just a force of nature and you couldn’t hope to compete with it, and Wendell tried to. At the same time he was having all this trouble with the Un-American Activities Committee, totally unjustified, disastrous for him.\n\nColeman:\n\nWhat kind of peer group did you form?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, as an undergraduate I was thinking about it, there was basically no peer group. My peers were a few pickup friends and acquaintances, and Pierre and Pierre’s roommate, and a few other guys gradually in the course of a year. The other peer group was the bright students in physics. We were all working together. Bob Houston, Tom Kuhn was one of them, myself, Henry Silsbee, Pierre, a few others. But it turned out we all ended up with summa cum laudes, almost half of the class that took that physics course ended up with summa cum laudes at the end of the three years, which was all we had. And they thought it was grade inflation, but it wasn’t. It was Tom Kuhn, and Bob Houston was brighter than Tom Kuhn. And Henry Silsbee. Henry Chauncey said it was the brightest class he had probably seen in his life. I think we all did pretty well.\n\nColeman:\n\nSo this is on sort of on the eve of the war as well as in physics at a time when tremendous sort of progress in quantum mechanics had come about. How much of this got through to you?\n\nAnderson:\n\nReally, none. Well my family was very politically active. My mother was very active in the local Committee to support the Allies, whatever that was, an interventionists committee, League of Women Voters. All of the Saturday Hikers were interventionist and very politically active. So I knew about the war, and was biting my nails and worrying about whether civilization was going to survive, frankly. I remember talking to Pierre when the Germans got to Stalingrad, and I was wondering when was it all going to collapse? So we were very conscious of it. We’d had this insulated life, but we were conscious through the influences at home. And there were kids going off, volunteering, a lot of them were, and those were kids who were a lot older than I was. Remember, I was two years younger than the rest of the class.\n\nColeman:\n\nWere there echoes of sort of the political debate?\n\nAnderson:\n\nOh, the other thing I did was I tried to get into various military programs, tried to get into ROTC, I tried to sign-up to be an Air Force Navigator and they all said no, “You have glasses.” And I figured the possibility if things came to war was to work hard and get into a research lab. I was not eager to go fight in the trenches, we all thought of this war as being like World War I where the worst thing that could happen to you was being in the trenches. Actually in this war the worst thing that could happen to you was being a bomber navigator, it turns out. So I was very lucky I wore glasses. I volunteered with no success.\n\nColeman:\n\nAnd the second part of my question was about the developments of physics and whether echoes of those reached you.\n\nAnderson:\n\nThen at the end of my second year, or maybe even after the first semester, they formed this engineering physics program that was aimed at preparing kids for getting into a radar program, and some others of us understood very well that the thing to do was to stay in physics because some of us had physicists fathers who knew about Los Alamos and other things, and some of us had other sources of information, like Ted Hall, who ended up being a spy at Los Alamos. I knew him vaguely, but he was not in our group of physicists after the first year, not one of the really high ranking kids. And Henry Silsbee knew about that. He stayed in physics. But I didn’t. My physicists friends back home in Urbana kept absolutely mum and didn’t advise me to stay in physics and work in nuclear physics, and so fortunately I didn’t. I joined the engineering physics program which was aimed at radar. And we also, after the first year, were expected to stay on and accelerate our program. So I took summer school and finished in three years plus summer school and took a lot of engineering courses. Some of those courses were very good; some of them were terrible. I also took physics courses, some of which were good, some were terrible. It depended on the physics.\n\nColeman:\n\nLet me try this another way. One of the things that you’ve emphasized is that there was this real revolution in the way physicists looked at the world in terms of suddenly being able to understand a whole range of phenomena after the discovery of quantum mechanics that you just couldn’t previously.\n\nAnderson:\n\nNobody was telling us about that. We were aware of strictly basic classical physics, no quantum mechanics in the first year. In Physics G we did a little bit of kinetic theory and quantum mechanics and so on. And in radar or in the engineering programs, we were taught how electron tubes work, which of course is basically classical physics. We were taught how amplifiers work, a lot of really bad classical radiation theory and electromagnetic waves, about wave guide theory, of course, because that was very important. And not a word about quantum mechanics.\n\nColeman:\n\nWas there anyone on the faculty that was sort of in the thick of things?\n\nAnderson:\n\nOh yes, everyone was. I mean the faculty. Van Vleck taught us classical mechanics, but he taught us classical mechanics in terms of the standard classical models, you know, Euler’s equations and all that kind of stuff. (He was running the Harvard branch of the Radlab.)Bainbridge had just gotten through inventing the mass spectrometer. Furry of course was busy doing the theory of diffusion for isotope separation, and he taught us a lot about that after the war, but in wartime he didn’t go into that. I got some hints just in the problems. I derived from my book Maxwell’s distribution, which I was thrilled when I could derive Maxwell’s distribution to really understand how a gas worked. That was a big thrill. But I didn’t realize the whole thing had already been done. There was no awareness in undergraduate school. I learned about real physics in an odd way at the Naval Research Lab. There was this old drunk who had had a Ph.D. in physics, he was fairly bright, but he was, you know, if loose lips sank ships, he must have sunk the whole fleet because he couldn’t keep his mouth shut about anything. I never supposed that spies were that efficient. All they needed to do was go to a bar and listen to him and they would know everything in the research lab, everything that the research lab was doing. But he had a copy of Margenau and Murphy and I would read it, and that had quantum mechanics in it. That was a thrill. We didn’t have a lot of spare time, we worked 9 hours a day 6 days a week, but there were moments between testing antennas and things like that where I had time to read this book, and that was where I learned about modern physics. He kept borrowing money, and finally he said, “I owe so much money, you can keep the book.” I still have it.\n\nColeman:\n\nAre there other highlights attributed with the research lab that contributed to you headed back to Harvard for graduate school?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNot really. Well, it was fun, but by now I was growing up and I had discovered girls and drinking and having fun and wandering around Washington museums, all sorts of things. For dinner every Sunday we went out on to a great seafood restaurant on 7th Street SW downtown. It was very busy, but a good time.\n\nColeman:\n\nDid you have any close family members at that point who were involved in war in other ways?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, my sister was a WAVE [feminine branch of the Navy]. She flew blimps in various peripheral places around the coasts of the US. She never went overseas, but I think she was as far as Hawaii. But they were doing weather assessment in blimps. She was a lieutenant in the Weather Service.\n\nColeman:\n\nActually while we’re on the topic, because we somehow skipped it, could you tell us a little bit about your sister?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell she is older. She’s still around. And she became a biochemist, a Ph.D. in biochemistry. She and my mother fought terribly because my mother was sexist, as everyone was in those days, and thought that boys should be scientists and girls should primp and dress prettily. That wasn’t my sister’s style. She was very much a tomboy. When we had a carpentry project, she was very likely to grab the hammer from me and say, “Here, let me do it,” when I was making a mess of it. Well we had a group of cousins who we were very close to and did a lot of projects at this point. She played football with us and was very much a tomboy.\n\nColeman:\n\nAnd where did she go to college?\n\nAnderson:\n\nShe went to Illinois, joined my mother’s sorority. So my mother, my wife, and my sister all belonged to the same sorority under different circumstances. But my sister fought like a, bucked like a steer, but equally was a lady, and was always interested in the intellectual things and in doing male jobs including being in the WAVEs. But she did get married in graduate school. She went to Wisconsin, which was the premier biochemistry department in the world at that time, and had a very good professor and did a very good Ph.D., but unfortunately the twins arrived the same month that she got her Ph.D. and she didn’t go back to biochemistry really ever. She tried teaching at Haverford for a while later on. Her husband was a biochemist who became fairly high up in the Smith, Klein, & French pharmaceutical firm. It was Smith-Klein at that time. He shepherded several of the better known drugs through the regulatory process. It was highly regarded, but eventually he had to basically testify against some of his superiors in a scandal they had. I don’t think he was punished for that. He didn’t volunteer, he was just testifying. My sister then retrained herself as a librarian and information assistant, basically information side of it and had a fairly distinguished career after raising the twins and another son and daughter. She had a fairly distinguished career as a library doctor, rescuing libraries that were being mismanaged. She rescued the library of the Hagley Foundation; the Dupont Company’s History of Science division. She rescued the library of the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. She rescued the library of the SUNY, Binghamton at various times. And she and her husband both have an interest in the history of technology and have published papers in that field, and a book.\n\nColeman:\n\nGiven that she was ahead of you and also doing science, did you have much of a dialog with her as you were growing up?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI was a little guy who hung around. I was five years younger. Of course I was a younger sibling and she and her friends would brush me off when they could and occasionally would be very nice. We were always close. We never really fought more than siblings do. We were part of a group of four very close cousins. I had two cousins in Crawfordsville and there were the two of us, and we always vacationed together for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, and so on, and we did everything together. My cousin Dick became Lieutenant Governor of Indiana. I was close to my cousin Jim, who also was the same age and was very close. And the four of us got along just fine. We did a lot of things together.\n\nColeman:\n\nSo let’s get back to the war essentially, and go back to the Naval Research Lab. What made you decide to go back to Harvard?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI went back to Harvard because I felt I’d been cheated out of an undergraduate education in physics. And I met Van Vleck on a couple of occasions during the war. After we got through designing countermeasures, I guess I covered that in the other interview when I was talking about the war. But after we got through the main effort, we got interested in what was going to happen after the war in propagation, and well, the programs that the Naval research lab actually did do after the war in rockets and space. We got interested in propagation and propagation of microwaves and radio waves in general. So I went to some conferences on propagation. I saw two of my Harvard professors, Van Vleck and Furry again, and some of the people I was later to know at Cambridge took part in this meeting. I was very, very impressed by these guys and various phenomena of propagation of microwaves and wave guiding effects where we’d get enormously long propagation over water and things like that. So I looked at it and I thought, “This kind of thing I can develop happened at Harvard.” Really interesting stuff, and I wanted to go back. You can see I wasn’t very imaginative. I went back, slept on Tom Kuhn’s couch, and Van Vleck said, “Fine.” So I came back. I was discharged in October and one week later went off for my Ph.D. Schwinger arrived in, let’s see, I started in October. Schwinger arrived I guess in February, the second semester. I was taking quantum mechanics with Furry and statistical mechanics from Furry, and simultaneously Schwinger was giving this marathon course starting in February for three semesters, a fascinating course because essentially he talked about everything that he had learned in his life for three semesters of hour and a half lectures, and you just had to be prepared to miss lunch because he started normally at noon to 12:15 when he walked in to give the lecture, prepared for what he was going to say. He never had notes to lecture. He’d be writing with both hands for an hour and fifteen minutes, and then we would rush and maybe were late for lunch. And all of us, everyone took that. There was a lot of physics, variational techniques for solving partial differential equations and variational techniques for solving a deuteron. So we were already in good physics, what are nuclear moments about, how do you do nuclear moments? What about symmetry? Angular momentum and how you deal with it in nuclear physics. A little bit of fission. The second half you have Bethe. We used his article in Revs Modern Physics as our textbook. Furry taught out of Pauli’s Handbuch article, and the gang was trying to translate that. I must say I think I did a pretty good job with my chapter, but most of the chapters were absolutely abysmal because most of the kids didn’t even understand physics, so it wasn’t much help. So we learned German. The next year I took Group Theory from Van Vleck, and I still have an annotated copy of Wigner in German. Then we had some terrible courses. There was a course in elasticity which was supposed to be taught by Hildebrandt but he was busy worrying about the elastic properties of bomb casings and never showed up at all and von Mises gave it. He was in the Applied Physics department. He was in fluid dynamics and he taught elasticity very badly. The courses in general were good, and we worked over the summer. In the summer, Goudsmit came out and taught a course in “Fun with the Variational Method.” It was supposed to be classical mechanics, but he did it on the variational method, and he had these wonderful examples in which with a Dutch accent he would talk about the bug going on a wheel, and they would be crawling around the edge of a wheel and the wheel would be going in such and such a way. He was a marvelous teacher. The only solid state physics I ever had was... I had two very good approaches to solid-state physics, neither was solid-state physics per se. Gorter came and told us all about magnetic relaxation. He talked about how they worked during the war. And the other was Brillouin who came and gave this beautifully precise explanation of periodic structures using his book. These were all kind of extra summer courses. Another thing was Furry didn’t do statistical mechanics, Furry did kinetic theory. That was what Furry liked to teach.\n\nColeman:\n\nWho were some of your fellow students, names you know of?\n\nAnderson:\n\nThey were very high quality people, a lot of them working with Schwinger. Bob Karplus, Walter Kohn, Lew Branscomb. Rolf Landauer was younger. He was a close friend of Wendell Griffith from Urbana. There was a group of younger guys who I interacted with some. Bloembergen was really a post-doc, but was in some of the classes. Tom Kuhn, of course. Ken Case and Tom and I took analysis together. It was an awful course by a mathematician called D.V. Widder in which he undertook to do all of complex analysis without ever doing a single contour integral. He did it all by Mittag-Leffler Series and Taylor Series and all of the possible kinds of series and continued products. Ken and Tom Kuhn and I worked very hard. We would always look at the grades on the homework papers, but we had all gotten 5 pluses. It was very competitive.\n\nSondhi:\n\nSpeaking of Tom Kuhn, I mean at this point did he already have some inklings to the kind of work he’s done in the history stuff?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNo, he was doing a very good thesis with van Vleck. He was much more mature, a much more mature physicist. I knew very little. For instance, I was very surprised when I looked up from the roof at the Naval Research Lab and saw the first jet plane some time in 1944 when it was still secret. That was one of the first tips in the war in what was going on in the Army Air Force station next door. I said, “Oh my god, what was that?” It could have been something bad for all we knew.\n\nColeman:\n\nSo to set the stage for your choices, the thesis problem and so on, a graduate student entering today faces in the physics department fairly well-defined specialties, groups. What was your sense of physics as you began to come to grips with the research project?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, there certainly was no group structure. I mean everybody was either a theoretical physicist or experimental physicist. I took what I had to take in physics and I enjoyed it. There was a wonderful course by Oldenberg in which he made it a point of rescuing historic experiments from the dustbin — Bainbridge’s first mass spectrometer. He had an oil drop experiment, I don’t think it was the original one, but it was the first generation after that experiment. One of my closest friends was Al Sachs. He was working for Purcell and did NMR. He became a particle physicist. My roommate was Rod Cool, who became a particle physicist. He was working on spark chambers, but he was taking the same courses, doing the same routine. And a lot of my friends were working in chemical physics where many of them worked with Ken Wilson’s father, E.B. Wilson in microwave spectroscopy. So we didn’t differentiate. All of us who could manage had Schwinger’s course together. I made my choice because I kind of liked van Vleck. Schwinger had far too many people outside his door. He had about ten minutes for each of his students every week or so, not that I saw Van that much, but if I wanted him, he would have been there. He was available when he wasn’t on sabbatical or in Europe somewhere, but when he was there he was there. So I more or less chose on the basis that I wanted to work with the guy who was around and was available. The other thing that I had become fascinated by was the Gorter course and learning about my friends who were doing microwave. So I guess when I went and saw Van, I said, “Well, have you heard about the good things with microwave spectroscopy? Maybe I’d like to do something with that.”\n\nColeman:\n\nYour thesis work, you were starting to tell us about the problem that happened close to you, spectral line problem. Could you tell us a bit more about that, what the state of your knowledge was and how the problem was disposed?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell the spectral line problem, he gave me essentially all of the literature that there was on spectral line breadths, where anyone had made any effort to do a quantitative job; this consisted of basically there was a long paper by Weisskopf who was trying to do it semi- classically using quantum physics and WKB. There was the old Debye-Lorentz collision literature which was kinetic theory, molecules banging against each other. And then there was a paper by an obscure Swede named Lindholm who worked in the forest products laboratory. But he had actually done the most advanced thing ever done in line broadening because he actually thought about how the forces influence the line and how the molecules approached each other and modulated the spectrum of the light that you were getting from it. So kind of in principal the starting point was Lindholm. And then there was a paper by Margenau who had done what he called the statistical theory and that was very puzzling. He got roughly right answers, but he had the molecules sitting absolutely still, and that was a hint from which a lot of things followed later on. But I didn’t pay much attention. I didn’t worry too much about it in the thesis. But you know there were literally thousands of new data in this field. Before the war people had done sodium atoms and the sodium lines, and people had done stuff comparing Doppler broadening with pressure broadening. And then there was a little data on a couple of vibrational bands of simple molecules. And now all of a sudden you could do say 100 lines in the ammonium inversion spectrum and each one had a different breadth and then they had systematic variations of the breadths, and there were literally thousands of lines in the water spectrum, which was much more complicated because asymmetric.\n\nSondhi:\n\nIt was the fact that a certain frequency range had become available that had caused these variations?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, it really was just microwave techniques. In the past we had always done the incoherent spectrum because light sources, thermal light sources had only incandescent bulbs, not lasers. All of a sudden we had coherent sources and we could study a line by taking the frequency of our transmitter and running through the line, or if it was a magnetic resonance line, you would keep the transmitter fixed and move the magnetic field. And Bloembergen was doing a similar thing with the magnetic resonance spectrum, thinking really physically about what caused the shape of a line. I was close to the gas spectrum, all of the gases that we were working with over in Bright Wilson’s lab, and Charlie Townes was busy doing it all here at Bell Labs and at Columbia. Bleaney was doing it all at Oxford, it was all taking place at the same time. And so there was lots and lots of data, and Van was smart enough to realize that it was going to happen and it was time we had a theory of line broadening. He could take care of the frequencies involved with lines, and that was the quantum theory of the 1930s with a lot of bells and whistles. But all he knew of to worry about actual details of the line shape was this strange thesis of Lindholm. He handed that to me, and told me a few facts about the names to look up for some facts about molecular interactions. And I was busy. I was very much involved at that time with a group, Tom Lehrer, Dave Robinson and so on, having a very good time playing bridge and doing double crostics and singing, generally not really carousing but doing all kinds of extracurricular things. And in the summer of 1947 I went home and met a girl, who had actually been the closest friend of the cello player in our quartet that I had in high school, but for some peculiar reason, neither of us can figure out how we never met. And a month or two after we met, maybe six weeks after we met we were married. She had come to New York with a recommendation and was in training to be a junior executive in the Coca Cola Company, and they were determined that they were going to give her a training job in the new South American concession. She could have been a millionaire. Instead she moved to Boston and set to work for 35 cents an hour, the typical Harvard wage, in the bursar’s office and we got married and lived in this miserable hovel near the Square. But then she went home to Urbana, lived with my parents for a semester to make enough money so that we could afford to have the baby, and concealed her pregnancy successfully from the English Department because they still had anti- nepotism rules at that time. Anyhow, so I set to work on my thesis, and at the same time Van Vleck called me in and said, “Are you doing anything?” and I said, “Well, yes sir I have been,” and he said, “Write something up for me.” So I quickly wrote up a few sheets of paper, and on the cover I wrote, “Dear Van, you old bat,” and tore it off. I wrote some things about molecular interactions, and that was enough writing to let me go on with the thesis. But then in that semester I had the basic ideas of the thesis and by the time Joyce came back and had the baby, it was ‘48 and we typed it all out in the fall of ‘48 and then went off to Bell in ‘49.\n\nSondhi:\n\nLet me sort of ask the more precise sort of physics questions. So this Swedish work that you alluded to, so when you came to the problem, what was understood about line broadening? What were the sort of technical and conceptual obstacles that you had to deal with?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI wouldn’t say it was understood. Lindholm had this idea that when two molecules get close together, they modulate the frequency of the lines that one of them is emitting because that frequency modulation starts out with a new phase after the collision. So that makes the phase change by a certain amount. You can call that a collision. So he had this idea that phase modulation is the crucial thing. What I had to do was two things. One was to generalize this to degenerate levels. There were rotational levels of course in a gas. There is very little vibrational degeneracy, so you’re going from a J equals something level to a J prime equals plus or minus one level where you have all of those rotational degeneracies. So what you have is a scattering matrix. So my basic idea was, instead of this change in phase, there is a scattering matrix. That’s the unitary transformation of the state of the molecule that it undergoes after the course of the collision. Then I had to figure out how that unitary transformation affected the line. The first place I would calculate that unitary transformation in terms of the integral of the interaction in the collision. And Lindholm had only a primitive way of doing that. I mean he said that to really do it with phase alone, we had a pretty good approximation for two molecules which are passing each other on approximate paths, and that I borrowed from Schwinger’s course because he taught me about how to use the unitary time development matrix, and that what you really wanted was T, the S matrix, which is the change in the T matrix in the course of the collision. Then the question was how does that affect the lineshape? So I figured that out and worked out an expression for it, and then I figured out some very good approximations that I could use to give the complicated sum of these matrix elements over the entire range of impact parameters. I used a classical path approximation, and realized that what I needed was the correlation function of the dipole moment. I figured out some good approximations for that, so then I could calculate, I knew the forces between an ammonium molecule say and a argon atom, which are just given by the van der Waals’ attraction between the polarization formed on the atom and the dipole on the ammonium. Then I got the cross section. And I did the ammonium spectrum, and I looked at these results and it agreed, actually, in considerable detail with the results. The only thing is I said, “Well, these two lines he got wrong.” And that was amusing because Bleaney of course was the senior professor, the Clarendon professor, the professor of experimental physics at Oxford, and he came and visited us at Bell Labs a few months after I had gotten to Bell Labs, with Miss Plumpton, who was soon to become Mrs. Bleaney, and I explained this to him and I said, “Well I’m sorry I got these two lines wrong,” and he laughed at me, and he went back and measured them and indeed he had been wrong. But he never told me. He did tell me much, much later when I got to know him fairly well that I had got it right. I was this green, green kid and I couldn’t be telling the great Bleaney that his experiment was wrong. I had grown up with this bunch of senior professors and I was used to telling them things. I should have been afraid, but I wasn’t afraid.\n\nSondhi:\n\nThe totality of the data that you explained was that presumably there were systematics for the gases and different things?\n\nAnderson:\n\nYes, I did that ammonium spectrum I did, I think with a rare gas. For infrared I’d get a couple of the classic vibrational lines that had been done in old- fashioned spectroscopy. And then I said, “Well, I’ve done it in principle. I’ll do a couple of others.” Some estimates on a couple of others. I had those things done in principle, and there was enough detail on the ammonium, so that was complete.\n\nSondhi:\n\nLooking through your thesis papers written out front, there is a stochastic idea that you used. Was it wide spread at that time?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNo, I was inventing a lot of this stuff. Original proofs without knowing it. I was using fluctuation- dissipation theory without knowing it. Well, there wasn’t a fluctuation dissipation theorem. There were only the Einstein coefficients, but actually the Einstein coefficients really do contain the entire fluctuation dissipation theorem. If you think about it, Einstein was very bright. Back in 1905 he figured out there was a fluctuation dissipation theorem, and he found the ratio of spontaneous to induced emission. He showed that the dissipation, which he deduced conceptually, can be calculated from the spontaneous emission with these fluctuations. So I was calculating spontaneous emission. Of course you can’t measure that in the microwave region. Just take B over A and that will be part of the induced absorption. So I was doing that. And the other thing was I really was doing a statistical stochastic sum over all possible collisions averaging over the impact parameters for the velocities and so on. I was doing it in a rather crude way. And those spontaneous emissions, well, spontaneous emission was actually, the spontaneous fluctuations of the dipole when we looked at the whole sample. Actually that was the case. So I realized that the point in principle, that the spectrum is the result of the spontaneous fluctuation of the dipole moment of the whole sample. I was kind of fascinated by that. I remember Joyce asking me, “Well you’re doing this very niggly little problem that seems very, very specialized. What general meaning does it have?” and I said, “Well, I can really understand what’s going on in a real sample of gas.” That stands for a real substance and I thought that was important, because not many people had ever done that that I knew of.\n\nSondhi:\n\nSchwinger was in fact the very influence of, along with Paul Martin, in the development of the sort of modern apparatus, the correlation function. Was this work already in progress that you interacted with that string of development at all?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNot really, well, I’d heard me of it in his course essentially. I don’t think I actually talked with him. Well, there was Schwinger and Karplus. They did a theory of line broadening in magnetic resonance, and it was a kind of general theory of line broadening. I guess I must have talked with Bob Karplus. Mark Karplus was the younger brother who still is a successful chemist. Bob went off and got interested in high school education. He was probably brighter, Bob was, but he never amounted to very much in terms of research: I met him later in Berkeley which is of course where the project for high school education came from. So he and Schwinger had done some work along these lines. They had kind of a generalized formula for line breadths which was related to this. But of course, the S matrix stuff I just borrowed straight from Schwinger’s course. And in order to do this problem, you had to take an S cross S, an S that is a direct product of the S matrixes and one for the initial state and one for the final state. So it was a little trickier than that at this point. But no, the general formalism was later — I was basically the first.\n\nSondhi:\n\nSo what happened in solution to this problem from the time that you ended up at Bell, how did that go?\n\nAnderson:\n\n(There were two — many — papers by chemical theorists about my methods.) Well, I went to Bell twice. The first time was during the gestation period. Joyce was in Urbana teaching elementary English. And I went on a tour of various laboratories looking for jobs, and recruiters had been around about jobs in these various places. I had put down in some sort of questionnaire that I wanted an industrial job since I was married and post-docs didn’t go to married students.\n\nChandra:\n\nCould you elaborate on that for me?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI don’t think in those days you got married and went off to a post-doc. You postponed what plans you had until you’d finished your education. So post-docs were out of the question. I could go and become an assistant professor, and assistant professor jobs were not out of the question, or I could take an industrial job but I couldn’t do a post-doc.\n\nChandra:\n\nWas this a question of salary or was it more than that?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI think there would have been a prejudice against us. I think some people did have problems. The standard thing was, you finished your Ph.D., went off to Europe for a year in some place or another, and then you came back and got married. But I didn’t finish half of my Ph.D. so I didn’t have a choice of a professorship and an industrial job, and my mother thought that since she had lived on an academic salary all of her life, that an industrial job could pay better and I didn’t disagree because I admired Bell enormously. But I went there and I didn’t have much to say. I just had this little bit of stuff that I had done. I was just thinking, I remembered actually on the train on the way back, three or four basic ideas of my thesis and really not very much more, and how to do this cross section. Some part of that came to me on the train on the way back, but I had just had to sort out the problem and see how the interactions affected the line. I couldn’t say I had solved the problem. And they were very polite to me and I sat and failed to hear John Bardeen say anything because he never said anything, even in interviews. I talked to two or three other people, like Charlie Kittel, but I didn’t impress them. And later on I went on a recruiting trip to GE, Westinghouse and Brookhaven. And by this time I had my thesis and was writing it up, and both Westinghouse and GE were quite interested in my career. John Holloman was in charge of hiring at GE. He couldn’t persuade his management, Harvey Brooks that I was worth hiring, so Harvey Brooks turned me down there. Sam Goudsmit turned me down at Brookhaven for the reason that, when I was asked what I wanted to do now, I said, “Well I finished my thesis. I want to do something else.” And he said, “This man can’t have really done a very difficult thesis if he finished it.” Well the fact was I had creamed the thesis. There was no more obvious interesting stuff to do. I had done all of the interesting stuff, and I was sure I had done all of the interesting stuff and I needed new problems, new worlds to conquer, but Sam Goudsmit actually refused to believe that, even though he rather liked me and I had been a recruit to when he spent an evening with a case of beer of talking about the Alsos expedition when he was at Harvard. He turned me down. Westinghouse wanted me because Ted Holstein was there and he had been interested in what we’d done. But Ted couldn’t persuade Westinghouse to let me work for him. They insisted that I should go and work in transistors, and they had a big room and they had eight chairs in which I would have been the first to be occupied, and there was a tray of transistors and I was given them, and I was supposed to figure out how these damned things work. This is the level at which they were. So I had that offer, and then I had an offer from Pullman State College in Washington, which wasn’t the University of Washington; it wasn’t a real institution and had no graduate program. Nonetheless, I chose to go to Washington and we borrowed money from my parents and bought a car and we were going to drive across the Rockies in the winter and get to Pullman, Washington when Van finally called me in and said, “What do you want to do?” and I said, “I want to go to Bell. It’s got Bardeen and it’s got Kittel, it has everybody I ever heard of. They actually invented this thing that Westinghouse wants me to work on, which I knew about, and they have Charlie Townes, and they’re working in my field. I want to go to Bell.” And then Van went to Bell, on the Phoebe Snow (the Lackawanna railroad’s crack train). It is not an apocryphal story. He actually did ride in the cab of the Phoebe Snow because railroads loved him so much because he kept their schedules straight at that time as a hobby. And he rode in the cab, got off at Summit, went and talked to Bill Shockley and he said Bill Shockley would hire me. And Shockley came up to in Boston and interviewed me, and he said would I work as a post-doc for him, they didn’t have any room for regular jobs and I said no, and he said, “Well we’ll hire you anyhow.” And of course I didn’t know that all of the contracts at Bell Labs were annual so that he was quietly in his head reserving the right to fire me after a year as a post-doc. So I went to Bell.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWhat in your thesis did Van like?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI don’t know, except that, first he insisted that I rewrite it; he said it was all Germanic English. Then he insisted that I put in a chapter in which I explained how you could get my result semi- classically, and I thought I had figured that out, but in fact that chapter is entirely wrong. You can’t explain these results semi-classically. But I put it in anyhow. But then he brought in Schwinger and Weisskopf, and I should have known when he did, that my thesis committee was the indication that he was proud of it, because he wouldn’t have exposed himself to Schwinger and Weisskopf... And I think then when he decided on the thesis committee he decided he’d better find out where I was going to work.\n\nSondhi:\n\nHow did your thesis defense go?\n\nAnderson:\n\nThey just didn’t know beans about what I was doing. [laughs]. It was very easy.\n\nSondhi:\n\nSo much for that. So that brings us to that. We turn to arriving at Bell Labs. So there are a number of questions here. Can you just give us an impression of what is was like when you first arrived at Bell? Who were the people who were there? Who were the main players, and who inspired you?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, I was thinking about that last night. That’s when I said well we should think about social groups. In the first place when I arrived, we were two people over what’s called nose count. It was the number of desks you were supposed to have, jobs you were supposed to have. In that same month they brought in Bernd Matthias, John Galt, and Gregory Wannier, and myself. Gregory and I, I believe, were the two who were over nose count. So we were put temporarily in a room together which had previously been a conference room. What I didn’t know was that he was busy getting rid of John Richardson, who was a very nice fellow, who for some reason failed totally to resent my presence even though I was obviously his replacement. And then I got an office to myself. Things went very fast. For one thing, a lot of us were new, so we got to know each other fairly quickly. There was a little orientation course we had to take in which we were shown the telephone switches going click, click, click. Of course they were all relays at that time, and they explained how all of this happened, but it wasn’t too important. (I guess I didn’t mention taking the radar course yet at the Naval research lab). But very soon, I don’t remember exactly how it happened, I got into a little group of people who went to lunch together, and the kind of a leader was Alan Holden who was a non-Ph.D. chemist who had been at the labs ever since 1925 or 1926 in various jobs, but had only joined the research department relatively recently. He was the man who did all of the preparatory chemistry for Charlie Townes’s molecular spectroscopy. He also did a lot of preparatory chemistry for later work in magnetic resonance. But there was this little group, and Alan insisted on actually having a sit-down lunch in the service dining room. So we would go every day and have a sit-down lunch. Somehow we got Gregory in on it. Gregory and Betty Wood and Alan and I were the core of this group, but a number of people joined us very often. Stan Morgan was a department head. Charlie Kittel often came with us. Charlie was close friends with Alan Holden because he was building a house in Harding Township near where Alan lived. Bernd Matthias often worked with Betty Wood who was a crystallographer and he needed her skills as a crystallographer because he was not strong theoretically, to say the least.\n\nAnderson:\n\nAnd we also needed her to look at his crystals that he grew, what their quality was and so on. I remember people joining us, and when Hal Lewis came, which was a couple of years later, there’s a complicated history involving refusing to sign the oath in California. He was going to the Institute and going to Bell Labs where we didn’t care if he signed the oath so long as he kept his clearance, which he did. So he joined Bell Labs, and he was very much a member of this group. So this was a group and again this was not the follow-your-nose, work hard, do-good- things-for-the-company, and do experimental things. It was not that many people. At lunch we talked about politics, we talked about art and music, and whatever the hell we pleased and sometimes about science and when we talked about science we were generalizing questions about how, for instance, was a quantum solid? Gregory was interested in wiggly bands, why didn’t diamonds conduct electricity. So it was kind of a broader group, and also very, very politically active. From that table came the only three people who refused to sign the oath, which was a “security” questionnaire sent to all of the people at Bell Labs, Gregory and Alan and me. So that was part of my socialization and it was very useful for me because I didn’t know beans about either solid state physics or solid state chemistry or crystallography. Alan and Betty knew all about that. So that was very helpful. Charlie appointed himself more or less my mentor once I disengaged from Bill Shockley. And Bernd of course was always a very close friend and we had a kind of love/hate relationship, but there was much more love than hate. But he had that relationship with everyone. Bob Shulman eventually joined this group later on. He was more involved in the Chemistry Department at that time. At the same time I got to know fairly well Bardeen and Brattain particularly. We were bridge players and we formed a team of four. That was with John Hornbeck and Walter Brattain. I think we even came in second in the lab’s bridge tournament. And well there was really no problem with socializing. I mean we worked very well, had the journal club, politics, science, and it was very informal. There was also plenty of pressure to pay attention to the experiments that were going on, and it was welcome pressure. I mean I was very interested in the kinds of things that were going on. I was very interested in Bernd’s work on ferroelectrics; I wasn’t that interested in Bill Shockley’s ideas on ferroelectrics, but I was interested in what he was doing. I was interested in the magnetic resonance work that was just being set up at that time. Alan was providing the crystals and Charlie was thinking about it and Bill Yager was doing the experiment to begin with. So there was no problem with being interested in the experiments, but very quickly somehow I got to be quite good at talking to experimentalists and being interested in what they were doing. So I fit in fairly well. Shockley, well, for a year I worked hard on Shockley’s ideas on ferroelectrics, and honestly did think about ferroelectrics and in particular with Gregory we thought hard about phase transitions. Gregory was obsessed with Onsager’s work in the Ising model. He was in some ways a little undervalued]. He was not the best known of the theorists who were there, but he was the most conceptual of the theorists who were there. He was really interested in how exactly do you define position in the Brillouin Zone or in a band rather than the position operator of a real electron? How do you define the position of what we would now call a quasi-particle rather than a real particle? And that’s the Wannier function. He was really aware of all of the Wannier function questions that later on would become things that add up. I should have said Walter and Quin were very much in this lunch group.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWould come in, in the summers?\n\nAnderson:\n\nThey were there summers, most of the years, certainly after I got back from Japan, Walter and Quin were part of this gang of people. It was interesting that in the center was Alan Holden who was really almost an unknown. He was co-author in a number of famous papers, but not well known, co-author on the early work on magnetic resonance at Bell Labs.\n\nSondhi:\n\nSo I had a number of follow up questions with that. Actually I noticed that you wrote a number of papers with Richardson, who you were there to replace in fact. Can you tell us a bit of the particulars, it is a very nice paper on general theory of phase transitions, discussion of the theory of phase transitions? So the two of you must have discussed together?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, Gregory really was the instigator of that. He and Richardson went to a conference on phase transitions that I didn’t go to, and when they came back they discussed it. Well, I guess at that conference Tisza had presented his general theory of phase transition, that the phase includes the Landau order parameter. Landau never admitted that the Tisza theory was the same as Ginzburg Landau, but it was the same and the principle was an analytic expansion of the free energy as a function involving macroscopic parameters, and you predicted phase transitions to be where the free energy became unstable to go over to another phase. It was very similar to Ginzburg-Landau. We didn’t know of Ginzburg-Landau at that time because that was the period of blackouts in communication. But we had Tisza and Ginzburg-Landau. Gregory and John had discussed this and Gregory said, but Onsager has this phase transition that doesn’t satisfy this transition theory and they got to talking to me, and I said, of course it doesn’t, and we resumed discussion among the three of us after we decided Onsager is a very good example of the fact that analytic theory, just doesn’t work. And I think this is maybe the first published reference anywhere that says, because of Onsager, the standard theory doesn’t work. Now Gregory knew that, so it actually wasn’t because of Onsager, it was because of Kramers-Wannier, because Gregory had deduced from general arguments that in fact they have a symmetric logarithmic specific heat. a logarithm that diverges. That predated Onsager and that was Kramers-Wannier. And so we looked at it and we decided, well, the free energy wasn’t going to be analytic. Really nothing was going to be analytic. The critical point was not an analytic point, and we actually pounded on the table and said, contrary to the thesis statement, the critical point isn’t analytic. And I think this was the first published version of that. But it’s just a comment.\n\nSondhi:\n\nAnd I noticed that.\n\nAnderson:\n\nBut John was still there at the time, and it was a common point with Gregory.\n\nSondhi:\n\nNow suddenly we see the evolution of your interests, ferroelectrics you mentioned, but also suddenly we see a new interest in magnetism with the rise of your interest in super exchange. How did you get interested in super exchange, in exchange and anti-ferromagnetism? What were the motivating experiments out then?\n\nAnderson:\n\nThat was Charlie Kittel, straightforward. Well, Gregory and I were still in the same office. He walked in the office door one day and said, “There is this new thing called anti-ferromagnetism. Are you interested in it?” And Gregory was interested in it because he thought, “Well, let’s do an Ising model with anti-ferromagnetic interaction,” and he realized that for the square lattice it’s the same model because it’s also the Bragg-Williams problem. He tried the triangular. It looked much more interesting, and he played with that for a long time. And actually I think it was Charlie who said there is this funny paper by Kramers a long time ago that says, interactions happen between magnetic atoms quite far apart, and I realized through Charlie that if MnO was antiferromagnetic, if you drew atomic radii for MnO, you have a great big oxygen, making the manganese quite far apart. So I set to work to think about Kramers’ paper and how did it happen, what was responsible for interactions between atoms that were really quite far apart, exchange interactions. And I wrote a paper, superexchange number one. There is this Neel paper about anti- ferromagnetism, and then we discovered Van Vleck’s old paper. I said, “But of course if exchange interactions are the way that Kramers’ theory suggests that they are, then the interaction between next nearest are comparable to the interaction between nearest atoms, and if we set these up in a certain way, the strange ratios of thetas to TCs will fit very nicely. This was stimulated by Charlie. Charlie saw to it that Shull was invited to give a colloquium and we also listened to him and he talked to me in detail. This was the second point: that there was a certain amount of friction between me and Shockley because the friction came between Charlie and Shockley. Charlie was usurping his post-doc. And here I was doing these things in anti-ferromagnetism instead of doing what I should have been doing which was working on Shockley’s ideas on ferroelectrics. So that caused some friction. Well, I talked about all of those political things for the other interview. But then that was Charlie’s stimulation, and the fact that I realized very quickly that this little quirk of the Neel theory as explained beautifully by Van Vleck back in the ‘30s that you can get any ratio of theta to TC you like even though both were perfectly good measurements of the exchange interaction. We had a way of quantifying the exchange interaction just by comparing theta to the TC.\n\nSondhi:\n\nTheta being the Weiss temperature?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWeiss temperature. That was kind of my first Bell denominated success because I was invited to give a paper at the Oak Ridge meeting and once I had an invited paper, I was immune to whatever Shockley thought about me. I was safe. Then Morgan could protect me after that.\n\nSondhi:\n\nThis was spring 1950?\n\nAnderson:\n\nSpring 1951 that I was writing this paper. Van Vleck came and listened carefully, and then he went off to one of his ubiquitous meetings in Europe, and it may have even been the Solvay Conference. His talk featured entirely all of the work I’d done on anti-ferromagnetism and the fact of that got back to management. And after receiving a minute raise, which I was very proud of, in the first year, all of the sudden I got a respectable raise the second year and then we could afford to buy the house that we then bought. Before that we were scraping along just barely because we had borrowed to pay the deposit and rent and we had borrowed from my parents to buy a car. I guess for quite a period what we had was a card table and four chairs, and then I remember entertaining Shockley, inviting Bardeens, an awkward evening sitting at the card table and four chairs.\n\nSondhi:\n\nAnd so your second paper on anti-ferromagnetism, actually the lead up to that was the limits on the energy of the anti-ferromagnetic ground state, and you presumably start to think about zero point fluctuations somewhere along the way there. What led you to start thinking about the quantum fluctuations there?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI don’t know. Somebody reported, maybe Charlie again brought it to my attention. I don’t know. I must have read Martin Klein’s paper about ferromagnetics, and we were interested, various of us, in spin waves and ferromagnetics and spin wave theory in general. I think it was a question of Charlie, “What about spin waves and interferromagnets?” And he I guess had developed a theory of the frequency for ferromagnetic resonance, and I got interested in the theory and the frequency of anti-ferromagnetic resonance and I realized that that was a special case of the general question of ferromagnetic spin waves, found this paper of Martin Klein’s actually referred to a Kronig paper about classical theory of spin waves, the fact that all spin waves are a purely classical phenomenon to begin with. The ion has a classical spin. We calculated the classical equation of motion just using M dot equals M cross H, and put the exchange field in there and then classically interpret the function. Martin Klein had taken that proto-theory and said, “Look, it even fits in the case of ferromagnetism if you do the quantum mechanics right.” Except for a smidgeon, including the zero point fluctuations of the spin waves makes the classical theory of ferromagnets the same as the quantum theory of ferromagnets. We realized, “Ah, you have to do anti-ferromagnetism,” and that was the quantum theory of the anti- ferromagnetic state. We had been worrying about the anti-ferromagnetic ground state, Gregory had, I had, Charlie had, and I realized when I looked carefully at the nuts and bolts of Peter Weiss’s theory where he had tried to do classical cavity theory on anti-ferromagnetism and he got an answer which didn’t make sense. So I realized how the quantum theory didn’t work because it had a divergence in the zero point fluctuations. And that was the other paper that became important because of the ground state. But I had been thinking, “How does Weiss’s cavity theory compare with classical?”\n\nSondhi:\n\nWhat was Weiss’s cavity theory?\n\nAnderson:\n\nHe did a quantum theory on Bethe-Peierls. It gives you a rough approximation at Tc. But it makes nonsense with the anti-ferromagnet. The mean field disappears at low temperatures because the fluctuations diverge, and so when T = 0, the quantum fluctuation destroys the point of that theory.\n\nSondhi:\n\nSo we’re convening again for the second time interviewing Phil Anderson now for his period at Bell Labs in the ‘50s. Phil, last time we spoke we’d been talking about your note with Gregory Wannier and Richardson about the realization that mean field theory wasn’t good enough to explain phase transitions. Just when we finished you made some interesting remarks about your efforts to look at non-linearities in Landau Ginzburg equations.\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, for two summers, Jim Talman, who is now a fairly eminent relativist, I believe wrote a book together with Wheeler and Kip Thorn, something like that anyhow, he is quite eminent in general relativity. But for light recreation in the summers he came up to Bell Labs. I didn’t know at all what he was doing.\n\nSondhi:\n\nThis was Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler?\n\nAnderson:\n\nI guess it was Misner and it wasn’t Talman, but Talman worked with Misner and with Thorne. Anyhow, he was another Wheeler student and became a relativist. And the first year he worked with me on a problem in line broadening, which was amusing in itself and was nice because, again, we really clobbered that one, and the solution we found was rediscovered 20 years later by Ulrich Frisch and he made quite a thing of it. The second summer I thought I could relax and do something interesting. By that I had become very interested in this problem of a critical point and phase transitions. We fooled around with several things, but particularly we used as a model essentially the same models that eventually Ken Wilson used to actually solve the problem, essentially Phi to the fourth theory in classical form, soft spins. And I developed a diagram series for it which was essentially the diagram series that various people later used. We didn’t get very far with it. Basically I identified the diagrams which diverged in low dimensionality, but I never found a way to add them up in any sensible way, nor did Jim. But essentially we realized that they didn’t diverge in five dimensions. We weren’t as smart as Pokrovsky and Padashinsky who realized that they could be converged logarithmically in four dimensions. So we didn’t get that far, but we did show that they didn’t diverge in five dimensions. But we never published anything on that. At the same time I was very interested in the reaction field, the local field and tried to find some formal way, some way of formalizing in a better way what Onsager had done in developing his version of the local field. Again, I didn’t succeed. That’s just a lot of stuff in notebooks, but there was an interest in this general field and realized that things hadn’t really been properly solved, but I just wasn’t able to do much with it.\n\nSondhi:\n\nThank you. Just as an aside, actually, you mentioned diagrams. What kinds of diagrams did you draw, Feynman diagrams?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell the diagram series had very legitimate classical foundations in the idea of cluster expansions. Gregory Wannier had essentially pioneered that particular art. He at least realized that Mayer’s diagrams that he used in classical statistical mechanics were essentially equivalent to Feynman diagrams. And Gregory, without actually formalizing the linked cluster theorem, had long since developed a method for demonstrating by just playing games with powers on the size of the system that the unlinked clusters dropped out. There was always a cancellation between numerator and denominator, a cancellation of the diagrams against the Z in the denominator. That was all his business, not mine, but I was using essentially these diagrams and realizing I wasn’t going to run into trouble with the unlinked clusters.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWe wanted to turn to ask you a bit about your interest in ferroelectrics. In particular, it seems that looking at your paper on the theory of ferroelectric behavior in barium titanate that many ideas that foreshadow later developments took place in this paper. In particular some of your early ideas about broken symmetry applying, a symmetry breaking field are to be found in the paper and I wondered whether you could tell us a bit about that.\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, there wasn’t anything very sophisticated in any of this stuff. I guess I learned about free energies. I had taken thermodynamics in graduate school, but unfortunately I took it from Percy Bridgman. Bridgman had the most soporific voice of anyone I have ever heard. But he insisted on lecturing at 8:30 in the morning, and by 8:35 I was asleep and most of the rest of the class was asleep. So I learned essentially nothing about thermodynamics. Furry had never done statistical mechanics. Well he said, “Statistical mechanics is easy, and so I’m going to do kinetic theory,” and spent most of his time doing kinetic theory, which was very useful and it was nice to know. But I never understood what free energies were or any of that stuff. So I learned my statistical mechanics from Conyers Herring and Gregory, and so coming at it anew, Conyers had already seen the relevance of the free energy undergoing a singularity and breaking into a two -well potential and so on. He’d seen how phase transitions go, so without knowing about it, we understood the Ginzburg-Landau theory and I was playing with things like that. Otherwise I don’t think there was anything that wasn’t basically in the air at the time and much of it I would have ascribed to intuitions that Conyers particularly had.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWhen you said you learned things off people such as Conyers Herrings, what was the mode for learning? Did you pick it up on the fly as you were trying to do research or did you actually sit down and go through things together?\n\nAnderson:\n\nOh it was strictly on the fly in discussions of various kinds. Or I would wander into his room and ask him and he would say, \"Well maybe this kind of point of view would be.\" Gregory and I talked a lot because we were rooming together for that relatively brief time. Otherwise it was all extremely informal.\n\nSondhi:\n\nAll right, let’s move on. Now it was around this time that you went to Japan.\n\nAnderson:\n\nYes, well that was a consequence of the anti-ferromagnetic spin wave theory, more or less. Well two things, that and my NMR work.\n\nSondhi:\n\nMaybe we should touch on the anti-ferromagnetism then.\n\nAnderson:\n\nAnd actually the magnetic resonance work was relevant too.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWe touched a little bit on the anti-ferromagnetism last time.\n\nAnderson:\n\nI think I talked about that.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWell we already touched on that last time, so let’s go on and talk a little bit about it. Well we talked a little bit about the beginning of your interest in it, but I don’t think we got as far as your work that’s in the ground state with anti-ferromagnets.\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, let me make the connection to Japan first. There was a meeting in Maryland, I believe, was it held? I don’t remember, maybe the Naval Ordinance Lab in Maryland, somewhere in Washington, but not at the Naval Research Lab. It was a fairly well known meeting. It was reported in the Reviews of Modern Physics. One of my anti-ferromagnetic papers, anyhow there is some magnetism paper at that meeting. Kubo came and talked about spin waves and anti-ferromagnets also, but Kubo had a lovely, formal way of doing it and he was estimating the energy, but he really hadn’t seen the relevance to what we would now call broken symmetry. He really hadn’t realized how all of that went and he hadn’t seen the relevance of the zero point motion to the magnetization. He was just interested in producing a formal spin wave theory and estimating the spin wave energies and things like that. So he kind of did the same thing, but he didn’t think what the more general context was.\n\nSondhi:\n\nAnd he was thinking about anti-ferromagnets?\n\nAnderson:\n\nYes, he was talking about anti-ferromagnets. I think that may have been where I came to the attention of the Japanese because he certainly talked to me at that meeting about this anti- ferromagnetic work. When I got to Japan, also, I learned that he and Tomita had been working on the problem of exchange narrowing, and there is a fairly well known Kubo -Tomita paper which appeared just about the time I got to Japan. But I think it must have been Kubo who called me to the attention of his seniors over in Japan, and at a later meeting, I think there was an APS meeting in Pittsburgh where Kaya, who was then the president of Tokyo University, and Kubo approached me and said would I come to Japan. This was in 1951, very early. They said they could arrange to get me a Fulbright. That would have been the very first year that they had Fulbrights in Japan because they only signed the Peace Treaty in 1951 so they now knew that they could get Fulbright money for a job in Japan and they actually asked me would I come and be the first Fulbright, in physics at least. And we had just bought a house which was very old and very much in need of repair. The furnace had had a big crack in its boiler and all the cooking was done on a coal stove which also had a crack in it, and a few other minor things, and so we were quite busy trying to get this house together which was much more than we could possibly afford anyhow, or thought we could possibly afford. So I said no. I didn’t even really want to go. Japan was obviously still recovering from the war. It sounded like a very difficult adventure. I didn’t know enough to realize that this was a come on rather than otherwise, so I said, “Well, maybe I’ll come next year and maybe only for half a year.” And by return mail they said, “You’re on. You’re coming next year for half a year.” So we went. And by this time Kubo and Tomita had done this kind of formalization of the general idea that I had done in exchange narrowing so we had two overlaps, two very closely related interests, both in magnetism. I’m only speculating about the aegis of their interest in me. It was a very strange thing for them to do. After all, when they first approached me I was two years out of graduate school, and this was a full professorship essentially, the equivalent of a full professorship. And there were lots of better known people, I suspect they could have gotten a lot more people much more famous. Without knowing it, I’m sure that David Pines would have jumped at the chance; he was by that time much better known than I was. David Bohm might even have jumped at the chance just to get out of the United States at that particular time, but they chose me and I went.\n\nSondhi:\n\nProbably because of your overlapping interests in anti-ferromagnetism.\n\nAnderson:\n\nBecause of the overlapping interests with Kubo. I guess in Todai they didn’t have such a very strong group in particle physics. The particle physics group was in the Tokyo University of Education, which was when it was quite separate.(Note, at this point I was a bit annoyed about my questioners’ ignorance of my work on exchange narrowing etc., which really was as important at the time, or more so, than the AF work — and still has relevance, eg in cuprates!)\n\nSondhi:\n\nWhere was it that you went?\n\nAnderson:\n\nTodai, Tokyo University, Tokyo. There were nine essentially imperial universities, pre-war universities, and Tokyo was the senior one of those, it still is. Then there were a number of private universities, second string in various ways and it just happened that Tomonaga and his group centered around one of those and a good university, but not with the reputation of Todai. And Yukawa, of course, was in Kyoto, Kyoto Imperial University.\n\nSondhi:\n\nI gather that Kubo took credit for discovering you.\n\nAnderson:\n\nYes, much, much later. When I went back there in 1970, I believe, I had dinner with Kubo and I said, “Well, I practically discovered you,” he said, “No, I discovered you.” He had been in the states for a couple of years. He had been at Chicago and I guess I had met him there and went always to the Chicago meeting in order to see parents, and he came to Bell Labs a couple of times, although, well, he was gradually learning English. He never did learn English terribly well, but eventually we got so that we could communicate well enough. But we already knew each other, in other words, when I got there.\n\nSondhi:\n\nTell us a little bit about response functions. This was a developing field at the time, the idea of linear response theory. How much did you know about this and how much did you learn in going to Japan of response theory?\n\nAnderson:\n\nMy thesis, as I said, was all about response. I mean, we used the fluctuation dissipation theorem without knowing it, or I did. Then, actually, that was another interest of Kubo's, of course, and later on the Kubo formula was one of the many results from that. And at this meeting where we were in Pittsburgh, which I’m afraid I cannot remember what the aegis was. There was one of the big sessions in which a group of very senior people got together, sat on the podium and had a panel discussion of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and one member of that session in particular was Uhlenbeck who was talking in great length about master equations and slave equations. I guess Kirkwood was also on that panel because he’s a master equation guy. But they were talking about essentially perturbative approaches to solving the Boltzmann equation and going down from the master equation to kind of the Boltzmann equation and all that kind of nonsense. I remember I was sitting with Kubo, and we went out and before we actually got to talking about my going there I remarked to him, or perhaps he remarked to me, that all of this was kind of silly because why didn’t they just use the fluctuation dissipation approach and get response functions as correlation functions of the relevant operators, relative moments and so on, and we’d been doing all that. He, of course, had his theory of line breadths, and I had done the exchange narrowing work and other work on line breadths, and I was very much aware of the connection. So it was rather interesting. We both knew that there was an easier way to do linear response theory.\n\nSondhi:\n\nI’d like to ask you more on the anti-ferromagnets before I ask you more about Japan. One of the things that striking to me reading the paper on the ground state of the anti-ferromagnet was that he was struggling with fairly basic questions in the definition of broken symmetry, quantum systems, fluctuation in the ground state, what it meant to develop a broken symmetry state as you went to work in thermodynamic climate, I find there’s a notion of an infinitesimal symmetry breaking field. Was this really the first system in which these questions were sharply posed?\n\nAnderson:\n\nAs far as I know. I remember very explicitly two things. One was listening very carefully when during that one and a half year marathon course of Julian Schwinger’s, he stated firmly that it was impossible for a quantum state to have an electric dipole moment. He said it will have various angular momentum states zero, one, two, and so on, and he derived the restrictions for the nuclear case and the molecular case and said, “Look, molecules don’t have dipole moments.” And I thought, “That’s odd.” And in my other course, Van Vleck is telling me that molecules have dipole moments, and I filed that one away. And so when I got to the antiferromagents, there was this theorem that I dug out or was given, various literature, Bethe’s original paper, Waller’s paper doing numerical calculations and verifying Bethe’s results, and some of Waller’s papers. There was a Kramers-Kastelejn paper in which they had been trying to do two dimensional antiferromagents by numerical calculation. And one of the things that Waller, I guess, proved was that the ground state of the anti- ferromagnetic Hamiltonian had to be a singlet. I checked this with Kramers and he said yes, it has to be a singlet. Actually, I guess at various times he had waved his arms and said, “If you just average over all possible directions, in some sense there has to be a singlet in there.” So he had some understanding of these difficulties, but he never wrote it down either. But then I discovered this representation in which the zero mode, the bottom mode, was just a rigid rotor, just a Hamiltonian of a rigid rotor. And I walked around and talked to various people and I said, “But people must realize these things, people must know these things. All our seniors are very much brighter and wiser than we are,” people like Pauli and Kramers and so on and so they must understand this and I found no response whatsoever. Kramers was interested in the problem, and I think eventually he invented coherent states, or some of the mathematics for coherent states in response to these questions I was posing to him. But eventually I derived essentially the things that are actually in the paper about the rigid rotor, about the long time the rigid rotor would take to turn over, and that it had presumably a hierarchy of angular momentum states. And I really had done something of a search to find out whether anyone knew anything about that, and as far as I know, they didn’t. I don’t think anyone ever did the same thing for the solid. I was aware, of course, that basically the same mathematics applied to solid crystals. But I don’t know, I guess I didn’t look up the deBye-Waller factors and things like that. I think deBye-Waller merely assured themselves that sums converged at zero at the low end and then ignored the question of exactly how it happened.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWhat about in ferroelectrics?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNo, I didn’t think about this in connection to the ferroelectric because the ferroelectric wasn’t really a quantum phenomenon.\n\nSondhi:\n\nOne more connection I’d like to explore a little bit. C. N. Yang carried out this celebrated calculation of the magnetization using the Onsager solution, and if I understand this right he did this essentially by imagining that he was going to perturb by switching on a small field conceptually. Were you aware of this calculation?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNo. I guess Wannier was. He thought it was fairly miraculous. Apparently it was fairly miraculous, but no, I was not aware of that.\n\nSondhi:\n\nActually it might even have been published right around that time.\n\nAnderson:\n\nIt probably was, yes. Wannier had been talking to me about it.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWe could move forward a bit and let’s start talking to you about your interest in NMR and spin lattice relaxations. How did that interest begin to grow?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, we had beautiful cases experimentally of exchange narrowing. When the electron paramagnetic resonance group began to — well, in the first instance, I think Charlie Kittel stimulated the experimentalists to buy a magnet and we needed to do things with it so we needed to test samples. The first samples we tested were these things that Alan-Holden found in an old handbook, an old Landolt-Bjornstein, which we called POV because in Landolt-Bjornstein, it was called a Paramagnetische organische verbindung!. These were these paramagnetic compounds, organic compounds, free radicals in the solid state. And so we looked at them, and my God, there was this enormous, beautiful sharp spectrum. These things are now still standard in the trade because they are the best standard G-values. They have this really nice, easily measurable, enormous single, very sharp lines. And we wondered why the lines were so sharp, so we looked up the literature and there was this paper by Van Vleck and Gorter saying it’s exchange narrowing. And somebody asked me to think about exchange narrowing and why did it happen. So that was the first, I think, almost the first thing I did. I got involved in exchange narrowing, and then I read, of course, because I’d been at Harvard I knew about nuclear magnetic resonance and therefore I read whatever Bloemberg had produced, and we were all familiar with the giant paper of Bloemberg and Purcell and Pound, and they had this picture of motional narrowing which I think, well, again, just qualitatively, they qualitatively described the possibility that lines can narrow because a molecule is rotating or moving around in one form or another. And Van Vleck and Gorter had described in it terms of the moments of the line. Van Vleck always used the moment method, Waller’s moment method to estimate line breadth, and then he said in these exchange narrowed things the fourth moment is much bigger than it should be, given the second moment. And they said if the line is Lorenzian, then you can show that such a line has a much bigger fourth moment than it has second moment. And so I puzzled about that, and then I figured out a way to formalize the idea that there were hidden degrees of freedom. In the first place, why the moments worked out the way they did because of the commutation relations between the different parts of the Hamiltonian; and the second, that you could basically think of this as causing motion in the frequency of the line without changing intensity. So I developed a rather heuristic more or less frequency modulation model saying that the exchange degrees of freedom caused random frequency modulation of the correlation function. So there was an exponential decay of the correlation of the frequency without an exponential decay of the correlation of the amplitude. And then you can show that this gives you indeed the Lorenzian line with the cut off on the tails that agrees with Van Vleck and Gorter. Well, the physics isn’t all that important (2014 — Too modest!), but basically it gave you a kind of a formal way of thinking about these narrowing phenomenon, and started me out thinking about magnetic resonance in general and applying some of the things I’d learned about pressure broadening to the magnetic resonance problem. Most of the papers on magnetic resonance follow on from that. The reason why Peter Weiss is on my paper on exchange narrowing was that he had done about a quarter of the problem, but completely independently and I thought it would have been very messy for us to have published one paper which gave it all and one paper which gave a quarter of it, and so then I suggested that we write it together.\n\nSondhi:\n\nI notice you gave some lectures on all of this when you were in Japan as well as lectures in magnetism. Just as a side of it, in this period, what was it like to lecture to an audience that was largely literate presumably in Japanese rather than English? You said that even Kubo was struggling with this.\n\nAnderson:\n\nI imagine that they didn’t understand a word that I said.\n\nSondhi:\n\nDid you have a translator?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNo, I simply gave them my books, my lecture notes. I wrote out my lecture notes in some detail and they transcribed the lecture notes in English. Maybe they even just photostated, I don’t remember. But eventually the result was what they called the Little Red Book, of which I have some copies.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWell, I see your magnetism.\n\nAnderson:\n\nThat’s it. There were two sets of lectures. Actually one set, the notes on magnetism, were done the way I just said. The seminar on the stochastic methods, I actually made each one of them read a paper and report on it, and they did a fairly good job. So that was basically a seminar. I gave the first talk, and then after that I asked them to talk.\n\nSondhi:\n\nAnd the other people lecturing did so in English?\n\nAnderson:\n\nYes, they did it in English, and of course they were very happy to do that because they all were working like mad on their English. That was a very good seminar. It had many of the people who later became quite eminent in Japan. Yoshida, Moriya, Kanimori, Hasegawa, I don’t remember all the names, but they were in my seminar, not necessarily in class. Nagamiya came up quite often for the seminar from Osaka, presumably on the bullet train, which already existed but it went much slower than it does now.\n\nSondhi:\n\nWhat was your sense of that? You went from Bell Labs with its distinctive style, to Japan. What was it that most struck you about organization in the Japanese physics community or science community in general?\n\nAnderson:\n\nWell, of course it was totally, totally, totally different. On a professional level it was fairly easy to work with them. They were, of course, very competent, many of them, and we wrote some quite interesting papers together. Kubo and I did quite a bit of work in tandem, although I think only one of our papers was actually joint, but I was looking over his shoulder while he was working and he was looking over my shoulder while I was working, so we had strong influences on each other. We lived in neighboring offices and spent a lot of time back and forth. Kubo’s group was very different from most Japanese groups; it was not very hierarchical. In fact later on things got worse, and there is this tremendous pressure for no individual to stand out, to do everything as a group and take group responsibility, and that happens even in the science community. But that was not the case with Kubo’s group. They were willing to be individuals, scientifically at least. There was even a woman in it, which was unheard of in those days, Mrs. Ono. What happened when we went to Japan, I got permission from Bell Labs to go, and they gave me leave for the period. They were not yet socialized to allow sabbaticals, they gave me leave. I actually earned no credit, no seniority credit for the six months I was there. There was a month of meeting, and that did count as Bell service. They had this grand international meeting on theoretical physics, where everyone was. They invited all of the existing Nobel Prize winners, none of whom came, and what they compensated by was inviting — I once looked at the photograph and as I remember I counted something like 17 future Nobel Prize winners in the foreign invitees, which were on the order of 50. But it was a very flashy conference and very much not something the Japanese could afford, but they had chosen. They wanted to do it. It was only one year after they had signed their Peace Treaty and they wanted to do this to announce that they were now an independent power, an independent country, and they were going to be as scientifically eminent as they had been before the war. So I listened to a lot of talks in that meeting, and the real contrast was not in the science that was reported in the talks, but in the presentation. Japanese presentations are still not marvelous, but they had just absolutely not realized how to present material either experimental or theoretical. So a big difference was in presentation; not that much difference in the quality of the science. But as you know, in particle physics, Tomonaga and his whole group were right up with the rest of the world, but not in condensed matter, but there was good condensed matter also.\n\nSondhi:\n\nYour generation and the very nature of science in the United States have been certainly strongly affected by the whole wartime experience. Did you find among your Japanese counterparts, people who had somehow been involved in research? Was there a comparable impact on science in Japan?\n\nAnderson:\n\nNo, not much. There had been some disastrous things, like the one cyclotron they had was thrown into Tokyo Bay by the occupying authorities. There had been some expertise developed in radar and radio, not a lot. But of course they had been visiting the States and they were busy taking back what was being done in the States.\n\nSondhi:\n\nScientists, this is essentially a pre-war academic tradition that continued.\n\nAnderson:\n\nYes, it was a pre-war academic tradition with big insertions of modern equipment. But they didn’t, for instance, have lots and lots of more surplus equipment lying around that could be immediately applied the way our people did it.\n\nSondhi:\n\nHaving touched a little bit on NMR, I wanted to move ahead and hear a little bit about how your interest in NMR and line width broadening led you to become interested and formulate the ideas of localization.\n\nAnderson:\n\nThat’s a fairly long way ahead. Let’s see. I really have to think over life and how things went. I got back from Japan. During the time that I had been in Japan, things had changed very rapidly in the academic world, the academic world specifically, partly while I had been in Japan, partly prior to this. The funding system had gotten set up, so if you were an assistant professor in a reasonable university, you had funding from the US Government and that funding was usually through the military. So you were free to travel at will. You took MATs (Military Air Transport System). Of course if you wanted to get to Europe you maybe went by way of Newfoundland, then to the Azores, then to some miscellaneous airport in the back stretches of the Fens. But everyone traveled all the time. People were taking sabbaticals in Europe, having wonderful times in Paris. Of course I later heard there were people who envied me this wonderful Japanese experience, and they should have, because in terms of networking it was the most wonderful thing that ever happened. So they had begun to increase the starting salaries at Bell Labs because people had been turning them down for these very cushy assistant professorships that you can get anywhere. So when I got back there were a lot of new people around. George Feher was there, and his salary was not supposed to be known, but I learned what it was, and it was 20% more than I had earned when I left and it was still 10% more than I earned then, but I swallowed my pride and went to work and worked with George Feher, went to work as more or less the house theorist for George Feher and his group. Well, I was the house theorist for the entire magnetic resonance establishment. There was also a magnetism group that was established about that time under Clogston with Suhl, Walker, Joe Dillon, Jack Galt. They were doing ferromagnetic resonance, and ferromagnetic resonance had been another area that we’d all studied back in the course of this time. So I was very busy consulting with all of these people who were doing magnetic resonance and I became interested in their various problems, and some of the results were important physics and some were not. Feher picked up something that had already happened I guess while I was in Japan, which was the discovery that there was a nice fat magnetic resonance that you could do on the impurities in silicon or germanium, but silicon was now the preferred semiconductor. So you could study the shallow impurity levels of silicon. Bob Shulman was doing NMR, and he was interested in NMR on a various magnetic materials, magnetic oxides and magnetic fluorides, and doing transferred hyper-fine interactions in the magnetic fluorides. There was an interesting group doing ferromagnetic resonance of various kinds, and one theme that was picked up was the experiments of Bloemberg and Wang where they discovered intere"
