        "text": "John counsels companies and individuals facing government investigations that can profoundly impact a clientâ€™s financial health and professional reputation. John draws on his experience as a senior official in the Department of Justice to guide clients through the process of state and federal government investigations from handling document subpoenas to preparation for interviews, grand jury testimony, and trial.\n\nClients benefit from his close working relationships with U.S. Attorneys and other Justice Department offices nationwide, as well as with numerous other federal and state government agencies.\n\nJohn also regularly works with clients at all stages of complex civil litigation, including discovery, dispositive motions, trial, and appeal on disputes involving natural resources, antitrust, tort and contract liability, and federal securities issues.\n\nBefore serving as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico from 2008 to 2013, John practiced at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP in New York City. He also served as a law clerk for the Hon. Paul J. Kelly, Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n\nUnless you are a current client of Holland & Hart LLP, please do not send any confidential information by email. If you are not a current client and send an email to an individual at Holland & Hart LLP, you acknowledge that we have no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any information you submit to us, unless we have already agreed to represent you or we later agree to do so. Thus, we may represent a party adverse to you, even if the information you submit to us could be used against you in a matter, and even if you submitted it in a good faith effort to retain us."
