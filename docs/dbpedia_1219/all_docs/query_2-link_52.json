        "text": "Notes\n\nDate: 7/23/00 From: [email protected] (Ann Beeler)\n\n\"According to his great-great grandson, Boon Anderson, John Anderson was born in Scotland and brought to this country as a boy. He married Sarah Carney in 1752 in Overwarton Parish, Stafford County, Virginia.\n\nHe and Sarah moved their family from Stafford County to Greenville County, South Carolina before the war with England. John served his country from here in Benjamin Roebucks Company. He was killed in the Battle of Augusta in 1781.\n\nAbout 1795 virtually all of Sarahs children left South Carolina and moved to Warren County, Kentucky. She went with them. Over the next thirty years these children and their children scattered and settled in western Kentucky, Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas where most of them still have descendants. Sarah died in Kentucky in 1811.\n\nMy webpage at http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/b/e/e/Ann-L-Beeler/index.htm l\n\nhas this line with documentation.

About. 1763\n\nFrom Don' Raney's files: \"John Anderson died in the Revolutionary War.\"\n\nFrom Milton Scott's Files: \"Killed at Camden, North Carolina in the Revolutionary War. He served as a Minute Man in Roebuck's regiment, Pendleton District, South Carolina. He fought in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia.\n\nDescendant--Miss Mary Hunter--Bonham, Texas. \"THE GEORGIANS\" Jeanette Austin.\n\n\"Their three eldest children were born in Overwharton Parish, Stafford County, Virginia.\n\nDuring the revolution, they went through North Carolina and after the war, they lived on the Pacolet River, Greenville County, South Carolina. Mrs. Anderson, widow, listed on the Greenville County, census: 1 male over 16 years; 4 males under 16; 3 females under 16. This is listed in the \"South Carolinians in the Revolution\" by Sara Sullivan Ervin. Also, Sara stated that John Anderson was a Minute Man entitling him to 250 acres of Georgia bounty. Sarah drew his pension in 1786.\n\nDAR Application of Mrs. Dena Henslee Singleton, Nat'l #526822 - I received a copy of this application which DAR had corrected to show that her ancestor John Anderson who married Sarah Carney was born January 13, 1724 in New York. I wrote the Lineage Research Committee of NSDAR in Washington, D. C, regarding this entry, explaining the controversy over John's birthdate, etc. On August 15, 1979, they sent a letter stating - \"The birthdate written in on National No. 526822 Is completely incorrect. That is the birthdate for John Anderson, son of Rev. James Anderson, but this man is not your Revolutionary ancestor. This man was married to Ann Irvin, From your records we know that your ancestor John Anderson was married to Sarah Carney. ...A date of circa 1730 has been given to your Revolutionary ancestor since we have no specific date for his birth.\"\n\nMaxwell History and Genealogy by Florence Wilson Houston - 1916\n\n\"The descendants of our John Anderson say he was the son of the Rev, James Anderson of Donegal, Penn, and so far we have found nothing to disprove this, while there is much that makes it conclusive, though it has been claimed by some historians that he was the son of John or James Anderson of Augusta County Virginia.\"\n\n\"In the will of James Anderson he mentions by name only his wife, a niece, his daughter, Susanna, and the youngest son, Thomas, who was still a child and yet to be educated.... After mentioning these he directs that his remaining property be 'divided among all my children'.\"\n\n\"John, the seventh child of Rev. James Anderson, was born January 13, 1724. It is recorded that he was born in New York, while his mother was visiting at the home of a relative, His early years were spent in Pennsylvania, but when still a youth he went to Virginia and the greater part of his active years were spent there.\"\n\n\"By various records-especially the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography and the Chalkley Records, his path is made clear, For the more minute and intimate details, as to his family, we have the long line of descendants given from the personal knowledge of his granddaughter Martha (Anderson) Baugh, near the middle of the last century....\" (here follows a brief history of the Old Stone Church of Augusta Co., Va.)\n\n\"Reverting to John Anderson: He married, about 1750, Anna Irvine (Erwin). The following list of their descendants is from Court Records and from data given more than fifty years ago, by their granddaughter Martha (Anderson) Baugh, a daughter of their son, William.\".... (There is no question but that this is a completely different line from ours.)\n\nWhat it all come down to is that (unless there is some documentation that I don't know about) is there is NO proof that our John Anderson who married Sarah Carney is the son of the Rev. James Anderson and very substantial proof that the Rev. James' son, John, married Ann Irvine (Erwin).\n\nIf you have anything that would contradict this, I would be very interested in hearing about it.\" Ann Beeler\n\nNotes\n\n1st..
