John cared deeply about others; he was giving and always ready to help someone in need. If someone was sick, he was always the first one there to cheer them up. One of John's favorite pastimes was watching the freighters on Lake Superior and watching the kids play on the beach. This was a tradition started by his father and John has passed it on to his family. Most of all, John loved his family and treasured the time spent with them.\n\nJohn is survived by his wife Dorothy, 3 children: Lori (Eric) Mills of Brimley, MI, Joe (Ashley) Anderson of Potterville, MI, and Lisa Gruber of St. Johns, MI; 7 grandchildren: Collette (fianc√© Nick), Danny, Evan, Luke, Myles, Elizabeth, and Lily; and 1 great granddaughter Aryia.
