ISAAC BASHEVIS SINGER

Author ISAAC BASHEVIS SINGER wrote his great novel The Slave in 1962. Singer was a Jewish Polish-American writer who wrote in Yiddish. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978. His over five dozen short stories are published by the Library of America, and many of his novels have been made into stage plays and motion pictures, including Enemies: A Love Story, The Magician of Lublin and Yentl. He is widely considered one of the great writers of the 20th century, whose works combine witchcraft, mystery, and legend with a modern sensibility and ironic consciousness.

Although written in a relatively simple style, his tales are often complex, based on the belief that story (like melody) is the prime vehicle for revealing the inner being of his characters and the unusual places they find themselves.
