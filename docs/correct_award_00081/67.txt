Isaac Bashevis Singer

Completing his rabbinical studies at a Warsaw seminary, Isaac Bashevis Singer worked as a proofreader and translator in his native Poland before publishing his first novel, Satan in Goray, and immigrating in 1935 to the United States. A Crown of Feathers received a National Book Award in 1974, and Singer was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature four years later. About the use of biographies, Singer remarked, “When you are really hungry, you don’t look for the biography of the baker.”
