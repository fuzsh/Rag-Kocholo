        "text": "For this reason, in 2004 the centenary of his birth was celebrated. However, his actual date of birth was most likely November 11, 1903.\n\nSinger was the son and grandson of rabbis and brother of the novelists Israel Yehoshua Singer and Esther Kreitman. He grew up in the Jewish quarter of Warsaw - surrounded by a recurring scene of anti-Semitic violence in the form of pogroms - where Yiddish was spoken. Singer also spent several years in Biłgoraj, a town steeped in Jewish tradition, where his maternal grandfather was a rabbi. He received a traditional Jewish education and studied biblical texts in Hebrew and Aramaic. Everyone in his family told stories about him and when he was young he began to invent his own stories about him.\n\nIn 1908 the family moved to Warsaw, on Krochmalna Street, where he became friends with a young woman named Shosha, who awakened his tenderness. In the meantime, however, she read a lot, studying languages ​​and the Talmud. When the First World War broke out, her family once again took refuge in her mother's town. His brother Israel Yehoshua went to kyiv, got married and began working for several newspapers as a proofreader and author.\n\nIn 1920 he entered the Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary, but soon returned to Bilgoray, where he continued teaching Hebrew. In 1923 he moved to Warsaw, where he worked as a proofreader for the magazine Literarische Bleter, published by his brother Israel upon his return. Isaac translated works by Knut Hamsun, Gabriele D'Annunzio (the novel Pleasure, in 1929), the Danish Karin Michaelis and Stefan Zweig, as well as Thomas Mann and Erich Maria Remarque, and he became friends with Aaron Zeitlin and other young writers.\n\nIn 1929 his father, who had moved to Stary Dzików, died and Isaac helped his brother in the historical research of the novel Yoshe Kalb. In those years he had a relationship with Runia Shapira, from whom his son Israel was born. In 1932 his brother settled in New York.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935 Isaac was co-director of the magazine Globe, where he published short stories and serial novels Satan in Goray (January to September 1933). It is a novel written in the medieval style of Yiddish chronicles. The story begins with the events of the XNUMXth century that relate to the false messiah Sabbatai Zevi and offers a picture of the messianic fever that spread among the Jews in those years. In later work, The slave (1962), returned to the XNUMXth century, with a love story between a Jewish man and a Christian woman, whose relationship is tormented by their different traditions.\n\nIn 1935 Singer joined the staff of the Jewish Daily Forward as a foreign correspondent. Fearing the Nazi offensive, to escape the anti-Semitic threat he emigrated to the United States, he separated from his wife, who became a communist, and his son, who went to Moscow and later to Palestine. . Singer after a difficult journey through Germany and with a stay in Paris, finally settled in New York, where he worked for the Jewish Daily Forward with different pseudonyms. He published the novel Der zindiker Meskiekh, The Fisher Messiah, by deliveries for 5 months. The novel was not translated into English, but the theme is similar to Satan in Goray, this time telling the story of Sabbatai Zevi's 18th century successor, Jacob Frank.\n\nIn 1940 he married Alma Haimann (married and divorced Wassermann), a German immigrant who worked in a prestigious clothing store, with whom he lived until his death. She already had two children and did not speak Yiddish. Isaac received news that his first wife Runia, denounced as a Zionist, was expelled from the USSR and was in Turkey, with the intention of moving to Tel Aviv.\n\nIn those years the first translations of his stories began to appear, when Isaac had the opportunity to rewrite entire parts and received the help of several friends and relatives (a habit that he would maintain throughout his life, even when he spoke perfect English and could have avoided it. ).\n\nIn 1943 he became a US citizen. The following year his brother Israel died of a heart attack. His mother and his other brother Misha during the Russian occupation of Poland were deported to Kazakhstan, where they died. Her only sister, Hinde Esther, married Kreitman, also a writer, lived in Antwerp (she saw her only once in England in 1947, where she died in 1954). As for his son Israel, she would like to adopt him, but Runia refused.\n\nIn 1945, after the war, he began serializing in the newspaper The Moskat family (November 1945 to May 1948). The novel was also read on the radio, and had some success in the New York Jewish community. It was published, with cuts and variants, in English in 1950 (officially translated by Abraham and Nancy Gross). His first collection of stories in English, Gimpel the fool, was published in 1957; The story that gives the collection its title was translated into English by Saul Bellow. Some of the stories that were published in the Daily Forward, were later collected in the works In my father's court (1966) and New stories from my father's court (2000). In this memoir of family life, Singer's father appears as a devout and serene man as he studies the Talmud; her mother as a practical woman who wants her husband to pay more attention to money and everyday problems.\n\nHe began wintering in Florida and traveling (he visited Europe in 1947 and Cuba in 1951, Israel and France in 1969, for example) and began to be known in the English-speaking world. In 1954, critic Irving Howe included two of his stories in a collection of Yiddish stories. Collections of short stories and novels followed one another regularly, and translations into other languages ​​also began to appear (at first in French and Spanish, later in Italian). In 1955, his son Israel, on a trip organized by his kibbutz, visited him in New York.\n\nAppointed to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1964, Singer is the only American member to write in a language other than English. “Yiddish is the wise and humble language of all of us, the language of a scared and hopeful humanity.” In the mid-sixties he became a firm supporter of vegetarianism.\n\nSinger published 18 novels, 14 children's books, numerous essays, articles and reviews, but in the United States he is known mainly as a writer of short stories (The edition of his stories collected in 3 volumes in the “Library of America” includes 184 of them ).\n\nThe Wizard of Lublin (1960), translated into several languages, tells of a lustful magician and his transformation toward atonement through self-seclusion. With Hurry up (1978), tells a love story in Poland in the XNUMXs, retelling the Krochmalna street where he grew up. Among the collections of stories we must also remember A friend of Kafka (1970) The death of Methuselah and other stories (1988). Among the autobiographical stories and novels: In my father's court (1966) and Love and Exile (1984)\n\nSinger's is a realistic narrative interwoven with historical and social dynamics that are vividly evoked. Singer pays attention to the plot and the inner world of the characters, highlighting the tribulations and weaknesses, their desire for glory and their need for love, the problem of identity in the struggle between a traditional value system and the inexorable process of secularization. and the assimilation of Jews into the dominant culture. As a writer he considers his role little influential: “writers can stimulate the mind, but they cannot direct it. “Time changes things, God changes things, dictators change things, but writers can’t change anything.”\n\nDuring the last fourteen years of his life, he was assisted by Dvora Telushkin, whom he met in 1975, when he was twenty-one years old. Telushkin talks about her transition from secretary to translator in her book master of dreams (1997). He died on July 24, 1991.\n\nOther key works about him are: The Wizard of 86th Street by Paul Kresh (1979), the Conversations edited by Richard Burgin (1986) and the film Isaac in America by Amrak Nowak (1986).\n\nIn addition to the Nobel, he was awarded the National book award in 1973.\n\nJudaism\n\nSinger's relationship with Judaism was complex and unconventional. He identified himself as a skeptic and a loner, although he felt a connection to his Orthodox roots. Eventually, he developed a view of religion and philosophy that he called “private mysticism.” In his own words: “Since God was completely unknown and eternally silent, he could be endowed with whatever traits one chose to attribute to him.”\n\nSinger was raised Orthodox and learned all the Jewish prayers, studied Hebrew, and learned the Torah and Talmud. As he recounted in the autobiographical story “At My Father's Court,” he separated from his parents at the age of twenty. Influenced by his older brother, who had done the same, he began spending time with non-religious bohemian artists in Warsaw. Although Singer believed in one God, as in traditional Judaism, he stopped attending Jewish religious services of any kind, even on the High Holidays. He struggled all his life with the feeling that a kind and compassionate God would never support the great suffering he saw around him, especially the death in the Holocaust of so many Polish Jews from his childhood. In an interview with photographer Richard Kaplan, he said, “I'm angry with God for what happened to my brothers.” Singer's older brother died suddenly in February 1944, in New York, of a thrombosis; His younger brother perished in Soviet Russia around 1945, after being deported with her mother and his wife to southern Kazakhstan in Stalin's purges.\n\nDespite the complexities of his religious conception, Singer lived among the Jewish community throughout his life. He didn't seem to feel comfortable if he wasn't around Jews, especially European-born Jews. Although he spoke fluent English, Hebrew and Polish, he always considered Yiddish his natural language. He always wrote in Yiddish and was the last notable American author to write in this language. After achieving success as a writer in New York, Singer and his wife began spending winters in Miami with their Jewish community, many of them New Yorkers.\n\nOver time, now elderly, they moved to Miami. They identified closely with Ashkenazi Jewry. Following his death, Singer was buried in a traditional Jewish ceremony at a Jewish cemetery in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\nVegetarianism\n\nSinger was a prominent vegetarian for the last 35 years of his life, and often included vegetarian themes in his work. In his last story, The Slaughterer (The slaughterer), described the anguish of a designated slaughterer trying to reconcile his compassion for animals with his task of killing them. He considered that the ingestion of meat is a denial of all ideals and all religions: “How can we talk about law and justice if we take an innocent creature and its blood is shed?” When asked if he had become a vegetarian for health reasons, he replied: “I didn't do it for my health, but for the health of the chickens.”\n\nEn The Letter Writer, wrote: “In relation to animals, all people are Nazis; For animals, this is an eternal Treblinka.”\n\nIn the prologue to Food for Spirit: Vegetarianism and the World Religions (1986) by Steven Rosen, Singer wrote: “When a human kills an animal for food, he is neglecting his own hunger for justice. The man prays for mercy, but he is unwilling to extend it to others. Why then should man wait for God's mercy? It is unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give. It is incoherent. I can never accept inconsistency or injustice. Even if it's about God. If a voice from God came saying: 'I'm against vegetarianism!' I would say: 'Well, I'm for it!' That's how I feel strongly about it.”\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
