        "text": "From the Archives of The New York Times\n\nABOUT 'SHADOWS ON THE HUDSON'\n\nRichard Bernstein's review of ''Shadows on the Hudson'' (December 31, 1997)\n\n''One tends to think of posthumously published works as mainly of historic interest, brought out for the sake of completeness, and this would certainly be justified in the case of Singer, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978. But this book, translated by Joseph Sherman with skillful editing by Jane Bobko and Robert Giroux, is a significant event, a major addition to the English-language Singer oeuvre. It is a startling, piercing work of fiction, a book with a strong claim to being Singer's masterpiece.''\n\nJust Like a Singer Tale: Questions for a Yiddish Sprite (January 14, 1998)\n\nIn a follow-up to his review, Richard Bernstein considers why other critics--and Singer himself--were less enthusiastic about ''Shadows on the Hudson.'' Bernstein suggests that it may be the unusually dark tone of the work that has caused such an ambivalent reaction.\n\nNEWS, INTERVIEWS, AND SPEECHES\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer Takes Success in Stride (January 6, 1970)\n\nAs a Yiddish author, Singer had expected to write in relative obscurity. But to his pleasant surprise, his novels became widely translated and he earned a comfortable income.\n\nNobel Prize to I. B. Singer (November 6, 1978)\n\nA notice in The Times after Singer was awarded the Nobel Prize calls him a master of ''the tradition of such Yiddish story-telling masters as Mendele, Aleichem, Peretz and Asch.''\n\nText of the Nobel Lecture by Isaac Bashevis Singer (December 8, 1978)\n\nIn his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Singer says that authors, in addition to being entertainers, must be critical of the loss of spirituality in the modern world. He also thanks the Nobel Committee for recognizing a body of work in the Yiddish language, which he says still has ''treasures that have not been revealed to the eyes of the world.''\n\nOf Providence, Free Will and the Future of Learning (June 17, 1984)\n\nThis is the text of an address delivered by Singer at the opening of the New York Public Library's exhibition area, Gottesman Hall. Singer expresses an optimism in the future of learning, though he warns against an ''overflow of mediocre publications.''\n\nI. B. Singer, Narrator of Jewish Folkways, Dies (July 25, 1991)\n\nThe Times obituary of Singer recounts the life of a writer whose ''vivid evocations of Jewish life in his native Poland and of his experiences as an immigrant in America won him the Nobel Prize in Literature.''\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\"Satan in Goray,\" reviewed by Meyer Levin (1955)\n\n''This black-mirror narrative of miracles and cabala, of a hamlet in seventeenth-century Poland and a false Messiah, is in the tradition of such classics as 'The Dybbuk' and 'The Golem.' Poetically conceived, it captures the fever of longing, the folk-frenzy for salvation, that possessed the Jewish population of central Europe after the dark decade of the Chmielnicki massacres, three centuries before Hitler.''\n\n\"Gimpel the Fool\" (1957)\n\n''Isaac Bashevis Singer is the last of the great Yiddish fiction writers. His novels, 'The Family Moskat' and 'Satan in Goray,' were hailed as major literary creations, but it is in 'Gimpel the Fool and Other Stories' that Singer takes his place with the epic storytellers, transcending geographical and chronological boundaries.''\n\n\"The Magician of Lublin\" (1960)\n\n''All of Singer's work is characterized by a surprising nimbleness of wit. His prose, at least in the Yiddish original, is stripped, hard and bright in the best modern manner, and, fortunately, a good deal of his original power survives in English.''\n\n\"The Spinoza of Market Street\" (1961)\n\n''Singer's great strength as an artist is that he never lets us forget for a moment that, to quote Gimpel the Fool: 'The world is entirely an imaginary world, but it is only once removed from the true world.' He is aware that 'whatever doesn't really happy is dreamed at night.' It is this awareness that bathes his pages with a mysterious poetic light and an air of symbolic suggestiveness.''\n\n\"The Slave\" (1962)\n\n''Reading 'The Slave' is a moderately interesting intellectual experience. Mr. Singer's accounts of demons, werewolves, vampires, dibbuks and even smoks are fine. His picture of the state of life in Poland 300 years ago is a revelation. Nevertheless, the necessities of his allegory, its folk-story simplicity, insure that 'The Slave' always seems a little unreal and very far away. The life in 'The Slave' is general to all humanity, not the kind of fictional life that readers can share vicariously.''\n\n\"The Family Moskat\" (1965)\n\n'' 'The Family Moskat' was praised in these pages 15 years ago, and it ought to be praised again now, though in somewhat more judicious terms, because a book that solicits our attention after the lapse of so much time cannot be read in quite the same way that it was read before. 'The Family Moskat' is very different from the series of fantastic, supernatural and grotesque stories which have lately given Mr. Singer something of a vogue. [Singer has] proceeded from naturalism to supernaturalism.''\n\n\"In My Father's Court\" (1966)\n\n'' 'In My Father's Court' is no more a book about court cases than Turgenev's 'A Sportsman's Sketches' is about hunting. For what Mr. Singer has done is to recreate that boiling, God-haunted world of Russian and Polish Jewry that existed within the larger world of Czarist Russia--a sphere that must have seemed to their neighbors puzzling, queer and impenetrable.''\n\n\"The Seance\" (1968)\n\n''There is nothing unbelievable in Singer. 'Modern man was as fanatic in his nonbelief as ancient man had been in his faith,' a character says in one of the stories in this new collection. The mysterious is the extension of reality into another realm. The inexplicable may also be the comprehensible. Mr. Singer does not apologize or defend the mysterious. It is enough that his people experience it.''\n\n\"The Estate\" (1969)\n\n''If Singer's work can be said to have a single unifying theme, it may be something like this: Don't understand the world, or yourself, or anyone else, too quickly. No matter how much you think you know, there is more, always more.''\n\n\"A Crown of Feathers,\" reviewed by Alfred Kazin (1973)\n\n''Isaac Bashevis Singer is an extraordinary writer. And this new collection of stories, like so much that he writes, represents the most delicate imaginative splendor, wit, mischief and, not least, the now unbelievable life that Jews once lived in Poland. But Singer is also a rarity among Jewish novelists. Though necessarily secularized, he still has access to the mystical Jewish theology in which he was brought up by the rabbis on rabbis who were his father, grandfathers, uncles.''\n\n\"Shosha\" (1978)\n\n''Reading Singer is an easy experience, something like reading the bare outline of a Bellow novel, without the latter's intense fleshing out. Singer has always remained a journalist of character--catching surfaces rather than depths--and of style, too, in which simplicity and tidy formulas of description prevail.''\n\n\"The Collected Stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer,\" reviewed by Cynthia Ozick (1982)\n\n''On one flank Singer is a trickster, a prankster, a Loki, a Puck. His themes are lust, greed, pride, obsession, misfortune, unreason, the oceanic surprises of the mind's underside, the fiery caldron of the self, the assaults of time and place. His stories offer no 'epiphanies' and no pious resolutions; no linguistic circumscriptions or Hemingwayesque self-deprivations. Their plenitudes chiefly serve undefended curiosity, the gossip's lure of what comes next.''\n\n\"The Penitent,\" reviewed by Harold Bloom (1983)\n\n''Unfortunately, the reader can develop no interest in Shapiro because the author develops none. Shapiro is only a voice: negative, intense, apprehensive, fascinated by lust yet filled with revulsion toward it. The voice is indistinguishable from Singer's own, and there is no way to read this book except as Singer's tirade.''\n\n\"The King of the Fields\" (1988)\n\n''Mr. Singer's favorite genre has always been the fable. But in this late book, he turns to even more primitive sources of storytelling. He doesn't seem interested in narrating anything anymore. What fascinates him are images and words leading him to a Stone Age wonderland--a Polish cave of childhood.''\n\n\"Scum\" (1991)\n\n''In relating these developments, Mr. Singer displays his usual verve for storytelling. His energetic prose, his exuberant imagination, his ability to make familiar plots yield an endless supply of new twists--all are joyously undiminished. His vision of the world, however, has grown increasingly somber and angry in recent years, and 'Scum'--as its blunt, judgmental title indicates--emerges as a moralistic tale filled with disgust for the contemporary world and its self-indulgent citizens.''\n\n\"The Certificate\" (1992)\n\n''In the end you follow David Bendinger's adventures only halfway engaged. At moments you are moved to mild panic over his romantic and spiritual entanglements. But a certain detachment in Singer's prose always keeps you at arm's length. Nothing can really touch David after all. Even in the depths of hungry and despairing youth, he seems to know that he will grow up to become a Nobel laureate in literature.''"
