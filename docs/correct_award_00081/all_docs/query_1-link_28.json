Isaac Bashevis Singer was a Polish-born Jewish American author who won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Literature. He was born in 1902 in what was then Congress Poland and emigrated to the United States in 1935 due to the rising Nazi threat. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish and was a leading figure in the Yiddish literary movement. He published many short stories and novels that drew on his experience growing up in a Hasidic Jewish community in Warsaw and explored themes of Jewish life, mysticism, and the Holocaust.",
