Because that is how life is - full of surprises.\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer\n\n3/30\n\nA story to me means a plot where there is some surprise. Because that is how life is - full of surprises.\n\nQuotes Interpret\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer, a celebrated author, once professed that in his eyes, a story must possess a plot infused with surprises. According to him, such a essence mirrors the essence of life itself - a tapestry woven with unexpected turns and unpredictable events. Singer believed that the element of surprise is what keeps readers engaged and connected to the narrative, just as life's unpredictability captivates and intrigues individuals. A story, in his view, serves as a reflection of the enigmatic and ever-changing nature of existence, reminding us that beneath the surface, there is always an unanticipated twist waiting to unfold. Through this profound quote, Singer encapsulates the significance of surprises in both fiction and reality, revealing the intrinsic connection between storytelling and the kaleidoscope of life."
