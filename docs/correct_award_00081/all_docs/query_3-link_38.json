But who was Isaac Bashevis Singer? Well, we’ve put together a list of 10 random facts about this phenomenal writer.\n\n1. You will probably know him mostly as the author of Yentl, the Yashiva Boy. The short story was made into a play and then filmed in 1983. It was directed by and starred Barbra Streisand. It won an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards.\n\n2. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978 “for his impassioned narrative art which, with roots in a Polish-Jewish cultural tradition, brings universal human conditions to life.”\n\n3. He was born Isaac Zynger in Poland in 1902 and died in Florida in 1991.\n\n4. He wrote all of his books and short stories in Yiddish and is, therefore, the only author to ever have won the Nobel Prize for works in the Yiddish language.\n\n5. IB Singer published 18 novels, 14 children’s books, essays, articles and 7 memoirs.\n\n6. He was a vegetarian.\n\n7. He moved to New York City from Poland in 1935 at the age of 33.\n\n8. New York’s West 86th Street is named after him.\n\n9. His words were translated into 58 languages, but he was saddened that nearly all of his readers read his words in translation, due to the decline in popularity of Yiddish.\n\n10. Zlateh the Goat, one of his most popular short stories, will be a part of our livestream event on 20th February 2021 at 7.30 p.m.\n\nFor more information and for the link for the livestream, please visit\n\nhttp://www.Goldbekhaus.de\n\nPlease ‘follow’ us at the bottom our of website and you will automatically get updated on all our productions."
