        "text": "Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904–1991) was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978. An immigrant from Poland, he arrived in New York following the steps of his older brother, Israel Joshua Singer. He wrote essays, stories, and other writings for the Forverts, at times under pseudonym. For years Singer published his stories in The New Yorker, where he developed a distinct style. His work has been translated into dozens of languages."
