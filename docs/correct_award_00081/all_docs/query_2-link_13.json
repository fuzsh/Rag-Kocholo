        "text": "Call for papers: Special Issue for Studies in American Jewish Literature\n\nBeyond Canonization: The Contested Legacy of Isaac Bashevis Singer\n\nSubmission Deadline: August 15, 2023\n\nAs we are celebrating Isaac Bashevis Singer’s 120 anniversary (1903-1991), the time has come to reconsider the legacy of one of the greatest Yiddish writers of the post war era. As the recipient of the Nobel Prize in literature in 1978, his work has received great critical acclaim and has been widely translated into English and from the English versions into more than thirty languages. Bashevis has become a cultural icon signifying diverse notions such as the exotic ghosts-ridden shtetl as well as the American Jewish experience and universal skepticism.\n\nThis special issue of Studies in American Jewish literature aims, firstly, to analyze Bashevis’ academic and public reception, and discern major controversies, tendencies and shifts in the ongoing debate about this canonical and yet contested world writer. Secondly, we aspire to bring Bashevis into contemporary discourse, including 21st century gender and queer theories, the politics of canonicity, world literature, translation studies, and digital humanities. We also wish to promote interdisciplinary approaches that offer a broader consideration of Bashevis’ reverberations in world culture, including his manifold theatrical, cinematic and pop-culture adaptations.\n\nWe welcome articles that rely on a wide range of primary sources in the Yiddish press and the Singer archive, employ current critical methodologies in a diverse range of fields, and examine Bashevis’ bilingual corpus in its totality (Warsaw 1925-1936, New York 1935-1991 and posthumous work). We also welcome contributions concerning his works published in the Yiddish press, which have still not been translated or critically accessed.\n\nMore specifically, we encourage articles that address questions such as:\n\nWhat were the conditions that contributed to Bashevis’ canonical status, and what are the implications of this position for Yiddish and American Jewish Literary studies? What shifts in his academic or public reception can be discerned? Are there significant differences between his reception among scholars of Yiddish and/or American literature, and/or those who view him within a broader Jewish context and within a world literature framework?\n\nHow do Bashevis’ untranslated works in the Yiddish press open new critical approaches?\n\nHow can current perspectives help us better understand Bashevis’ ubiquitous depictions of same-sex romance, gender fluidity and reversal of gender roles ? By what means have readers and scholars dealt with charges of male-chauvinism – in Bashevis’ work, private life, or their conjunction in the translation of his work into English? And how do these two tendencies in Bashevis’ oeuvre and reception intersect?\n\nHow does Bashevis’ conservative politics and aesthetics inform readings and evaluations of his works?\n\nIn what ways has Bashevis’ self-exoticization promoted his career as a world writer and an icon of Yiddish culture? What new light can his unique status as a bilingual world author shed on the world literature vs. untranslatable controversy?\n\nSpecial Issue guest editors:\n\nJan Schwarz, Lund University and Zehavit Stern, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n\nPlease submit a short abstract of 200-400 words to:"
