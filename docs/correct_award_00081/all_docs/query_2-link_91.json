        "text": "I met the late Isaac Bashevis Singer only once, briefly but unforgettably, in 1963. It was in Manhattan, at the apartment of one of his early translators. He was then fifty-nine, no kid, but only just coming into his own in a serious way as a writer now frequently published in English. I had read everything of his I could find. I admired him without qualification—thought him the possessor of a powerful artistic talent, a man touched by magic and thus greatly blessed and to be revered. Captivating on the page, he was not disappointing in person.\n\nTwelve or fourteen people were in the apartment that evening—literary intellectuals, academics, editors. Singer did most of the talking, not in any unpleasant or pushing way but instead by general agreement. He was obviously more distinguished than anyone else in the room, had lived a more interesting life, had more to report. He told, as no doubt he would subsequently retell hundreds of times, about the mildly comic situation of being, then in his late fifties, still the youngest contributor to the Yiddish-language Jewish Daily Forward; he talked a bit about Jewish intellectual and literary life in Warsaw; I recall his saying that he had translated Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain into Yiddish. He reported that he did not read the New York Times but instead preferred the Daily News, which, with its extensive coverage of murders, kidnappings, rapes, divorces, and scandals, was so much richer fare for a novelist. All this was set out in a calm, slightly creaking voice, heavily accented, without any show of unseemly pleasure at being the center of attention.\n\nOne of the things Singer happened to mention that evening was the loss of his parakeet. A rather birdlike man himself—the once little boy with blue eyes and red earlocks described in his memoirs was now bald, without eyebrows, slightly beaky, and somewhat avian in his physical delicacy—he was quite mad for birds. With his penchant for the mystical and the pantheistic, he thought birds were possessed of some obvious if undefined spiritual qualities. I forget the name of his lost parakeet; it was endearing rather than grand or comical; it might have been something like Farfele.\n\nIn any case, the morning after that evening my wife happened to find a parakeet in a park near our apartment. I called Singer, who grew quite excited. “My darling Farfele has two dots over its beak. Does dis boid?” The telephone balanced between my head and shoulder, my wife nearby holding the parakeet gently in her hand, I checked it for dots over the beak. None. “Farfele has a bright yellow spot at the tip of his right wing. Does maybe your boid have such a spot?” No such spot. Great writers put you in their world, and here I was, in my own kitchen, suddenly become a character in an Isaac Bashevis Singer story. We went through another few checkpoints, when we both concluded that the parakeet my wife had found was not the dear and esteemed Farfele, he should only live and be well. I remember being disappointed that this was not Singer’s bird, for it would have been a fine way for me to repay him, however partially, for all that I felt I owed him.\n\n_____________\n\nOne of the things I owed him was—and remains—the important debt of helping to put me in touch with my own almost entirely lost historical past. My guess is that many of his readers were in the same condition as I, and that this was at least part of the profit we all derived from him and part, too, of the explanation for his popularity among American Jewish readers. What this condition might be called is Jewish historical blackout. I know I was not alone in suffering it. Brought up in a nonobserving but nonetheless proudly Jewish home in Chicago, I was sent to Hebrew school, where I was instructed in the pronunciation of Hebrew letters and vowels and in the meaning of a few words, and from which I was freed at my bar mitzvah. Later I took pride in the formation of the state of Israel. Athletes, actors, writers who happened to be Jewish always had special pull with me. I enjoyed an uncomplicated, happy Jewish chauvinism.\n\nYet I knew very little about Judaism and even less about my own background as a Jew. And by my own background I mean my own family’s relatively recent history in Eastern Europe. My father’s father was very serious about his Judaism, and about his Jewishness, too, having been an early Zionist and, I am told, one of the important figures in Hebrew education in Montreal. He spoke very little English, and on the four or five occasions we were together—the last when I was eighteen—we were hardly able to communicate at all, which is one of the great regrets of my life. I should have liked to have learned not only more about him but about our family history in Bialystok, whence he came to settle first briefly in St. Paul, Minnesota, and then finally and not very successfully in Montreal.\n\nBecause I was never really able to cross the barrier of our different languages to speak with my grandfather, I never learned about his (and hence my own) forebears, and so my own personal family history stops, dead and very incomplete, with him. (My other grandparents had died either before I was born or in my infancy.) My mother and my father, both the children of immigrants, were unable to tell me anything about their parents’ parents. In bustling, crowded lives, hungry for success and assimilation, neither apparently ever bothered to ask. I have found that a vast preponderance of my Jewish friends and acquaintances, at least those of East European ancestry, are in the same condition of ignorance. To be so oddly pastless has always seemed extraordinary to me, especially for Jews, curious, talkative, endlessly self-analyzing people that they tend to be.\n\nThrough fiction, Isaac Bashevis Singer—and I.J. (Israel Joshua) Singer, his older brother, who was also a novelist—filled in some of the gaps in my ignorance in a way that reading history and scholarship was never quite able to do. The brothers Singer made the world of East European Jewry come alive for me like no one else; their portrayals of life among Jews in backwater shtetls and in cities like Warsaw, Lublin, and Lock had a vividness that surpassed—not that there needs to be a competition about this—anyone else I had read. Isaac Bashevis Singer wrote about Warsaw the way Theodore Dreiser wrote about Chicago. When you read him you felt you had been there, walked the city’s streets, “come into possession of it,” as Henry James might have said. And what one came into possession of was a world much richer than one had hitherto imagined.\n\n_____________\n\nIf part of Isaac Bashevis Singer’s success derived from his putting many of his readers in touch with a past that had hitherto been closed off to them, perhaps a larger part was owing to his sheer powers of storytelling. In interviews, lectures, public statements, Singer insisted over and over that writers must, on some level, give their readers pleasure. For him this pleasure was to be had through narrative. In his Nobel Lecture in Stockholm, after reading a paragraph in Yiddish about how the honor bestowed upon him was also a recognition of the Yiddish language in which he wrote, Singer said:\n\nThe storyteller and poet of our time, as in any other time, must be an entertainer of the spirit in the full sense of the word, not just a preacher of social or political ideals. There is no paradise for bored readers and no excuse for tedious literature that does not intrigue the reader, uplift his spirit, give him the joy and escape that true art always grants.\n\nSinger not only wrote entertainingly but did so for a wider audience than most serious writers any longer even hope for. The distinction between high or sophisticated and popular art was wiped out in his work. He won the acclaim of critics and the devotion of true though not necessarily university-educated readers. Many years ago a cousin of mine, a very intelligent woman then in her early forties, who had never gone to college and who had no particular literary interests, mentioned that she and her husband were off for a week-long holiday in Bermuda and asked if I had anything in the apartment that she might take to read on the beach. Much that was in my personal library—poetry, criticism, history, philosophy—seemed inappropriate. What I eventually offered her was Isaac Bashevis Singer’s novel, The Slave. She loved it. “A marvelous book,” she reported to me upon her return. “By the way, this Singer, in what century did he live?”\n\nEmbedded in that question, I thought, was a fine compliment—a compliment with a touch of unconscious critical wisdom behind it. For not the least attraction of Singer’s fiction is its timelessness. He could write about the Upper West Side of Manhattan in its current state of sad decay and ring just the right note of contemporaneity; he could also drop back a lengthy fifty or seventy years, as in The Family Moskat, or a full century, as in The Manor, or three full centuries, as in Satan in Goray. He could write outside time, as in his famous story, “Gimpel the Fool,” which has the feel of a tale passed down from generation to generation in the manner of pure folk art. No modern writer in any literature that I know is so adept at setting his stories anywhere he wishes temporally. This ability sets much of Singer’s writing finally beyond time, which is of course where everyone who thinks himself an artist wishes to be.\n\n_____________\n\nThe timeless quality in Singer’s work comes from his having grown up in something very near a time warp. Singer was born in 1904, in the village of Leoncin, in the province of Warsaw, the second of four surviving children of parents with long lines of rabbis on both sides: his father claimed an ancestor who was a disciple of the 18th-century founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov. Singer’s father was himself a man of impressive piety (as readers of In My Father’s Court know), superior in his learning, and a bit aloof from the world, a Jew who wore the clothes and practiced the customs of the Hasid and who as a boy and young man had wished to live with the kind of purity that would allow him to become saintly and enable him to perform miracles. In Love and Exile, one of his autobiographical works, Singer describes his father as “good-natured, full of faith in almost all people. His only desire was to have time and strength to serve God and study His Torah.”\n\nSinger’s mother was a very different story. The daughter of the rabbi of Bilgoray, she is said (in Paul Kresh’s Isaac Bashevis Singer: The Magician of West 86th Street) to have taught herself to read Hebrew and to have known the Bible “almost by heart.” She was sharp, doubting, penetrating: worldly where her husband tended to be otherworldly, pessimistic where he tended to be optimistic, arguing with God where he tried only to understand Him. Of his mother Singer wrote that\n\nshe suffered not only her own afflictions but also those of mankind. I could see in her eyes great compassion when she read in the Yiddish newspaper about those who were run over, robbed, raped, beaten. Every news item made her wince in resentment against the Creator who could see all this misery and remain silent.\n\n“In our house,” Singer noted, “the coming of the Messiah was taken most literally.” Not, however, by everybody. Not by his sister Hinde Esther, thirteen years older than Singer, and especially not by his brother Israel Joshua, his elder by eleven years. Like many others of his generation, Israel Joshua had been won from their father’s ways by the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. Extreme piety and contempt for that piety existed side by side not only among the Jews of Warsaw but in the Singer home itself. So did superstition and rationality. After a brief stint as a rabbi in Leoncin, for example, Singer’s father was hired to run a yeshiva in the town of Radzymin, where he was also to serve as an assistant to the rabbi, whose specialty was making barren women fertile through the use of magical charms.\n\nAround this time, I. J. Singer had already begun to read forbidden books—and, in the Singer household, anything that was not the Bible or a commentary on the Bible was forbidden. It was I. J. Singer, swept up by the Haskalah, who reacted most strongly to what he took to be the medieval world of his father and the Hasidim. In his memoir of his boyhood in the shtetls of Poland, Of a World That Is No More, a memoir that is a useful counter to any temptation to sentimentalize the life of ultra-Orthodox Jews in that setting, I. J. Singer emphasizes the superstition, coarseness, and sheer difficulty of shtetl life.\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer never needed to be the rebel that his brother was, though of course he, too, would eventually leave the ways in which he was raised. Outwardly at least he was milder than his brother, less angry, more open to experience. And experience, living where and when he did, came at him with a great roaring whoosh. Within the Singer household and without, tumult was a staple of daily life. The house in Krochmalna Street in Warsaw where the Singers lived was also where Rabbi Singer conducted his beth din, which, as Singer has described it, “was a kind of blend of court of law, synagogue, house of study, and, if you will, psychoanalyst’s office where people of troubled spirits could come to unburden themselves.” As for Krochmalna Street, it “was full of people, and they all seemed to be screaming.” The Jewish section of Warsaw, he remarks in The Family Moskat, “was like a bit of Baghdad transplanted into the Western world.”\n\nWhen Singer was thirteen years old, Warsaw was more than 40-percent Jewish. Krochmalna Street teemed with the color and multifariousness of Jewish life, which included rabbis and thieves, artisans and con men, peddlers and prostitutes, hawkers of fruit, vegetables, and radical ideas, fanatics religious and secular. What a lovely enticing prospect for a future novelist to view from the balcony of his parents’ apartment! Yet Singer, when young, could only consider it from a distance. As the apparently autobiographical narrator of his novel Shosha puts it, “From the time I can first remember, I heard him [his rabbi father] repeat the phrase, ‘It is forbidden.’ Everything I wanted to do was a transgression.”\n\nLess rich but no less rewarding to the future novelist were Singer’s trips, with his mother and younger brother Moishe, to his mother’s family in the then Austrian-occupied town of Bilgoray on the Polish-Austrian border. There, during World War I, they stayed for fully four years, and there Singer saw Jewish life as it had been lived for centuries. The day was clocked by ritual and prayer. Modernity was for the most part locked out; as Singer noted, “the common people were even more devout than the scholars.” Although pockets of the Enlightenment existed, such as at the home of Todros, the hunchbacked watchmaker whom Singer later used as a character in The Family Moskat, “on Yom Kippur eve,” as Singer wrote in In My Father’s Court, “the whole town wept.” Here Singer was able to witness aspects of Jewish life that had not changed for centuries. “In this world of old Jewishness,” Singer wrote, “I found a treasure trove.”\n\n_____________\n\nLife, it seems, conspires to supply great artists with the material they require. But what is impressive about Singer is how early he knew what kind of writer he wanted to be. He quickly determined that the literature of political and social concern, a vein that his already famous brother had been working, was not for him. He knew straightaway that the delimitations of modernism in literature—with its difficulties, its determination not to worry about any audience but that of fellow artists, its concentration on the problems of art quite as much as if not more than those presented by life—were not for him. “One Kafka in a century,” he would later say, “is enough.” If Singer was in any way aesthetically radical, it was in the sensuality of his stories and in the use he made in his fiction of the celestial and nether worlds of the occult, the world of spirits.\n\nAlthough singer attempted briefly to write his stories in Hebrew, nothing he did in that language pleased him. Neither, at first, did his writing in Yiddish. But it was not long before he hit his stride and his prose caught its correct and confident cadence. He published his first stories, in Warsaw journals, in his early twenties. After he emigrated to America in 1935, Singer stopped writing fiction for a period of five years or so, in despair about both the future of Yiddish and his own then-uprooted life. But once he resumed, he never looked back, and his flow of work—novels, stories, autobiographies, children’s tales—ceased only with his death earlier this year.\n\nPaul Kresh, in his biography of Singer, quotes a Yiddish journalist, Samuel L. Shneiderman, who worked on the same Warsaw journal, Literary Pages, with the young Isaac Bashevis Singer and who recalled his early mastery:\n\nHis style—ah that style. From the beginning it was the envy of other Yiddish writers. His mastery of transition, for example—how gracefully he glides from description to dialogue, from the ambience of a place to the action happening there. What a storyteller! The literary world of Warsaw saw it right away—the richness of the language, the imaginative blending of the absolutely real and the totally fantastic—all absolutely new in Yiddish writing.\n\nThere are no Mozarts in literature, no true child prodigies, but Singer was apparently as much a natural as a writer can hope to be. As an artist he seems to have come into the world fully formed, so good at his craft so young, so able to vary his style from realistic family chronicle to novels and stories nearly surreal in their dalliance with mysticism to fiction strongly folkloric in its feeling. One does not have the sense of development in Singer’s work. He started strong and stayed strong, except for a tailing off toward the end, when his fiction began to lose its imaginative energy and turned very dark. It is much to the point that so knowledgeable a critic as Ruth R. Wisse considers Satan in Goray, Singer’s first novel, also his greatest.\n\n_____________\n\nSinger’s work, though not all of the same quality, is bound together by his central concerns, which are at their heart religious. Other modern writers may talk in their fiction about man’s soul and his relation to God, but they cannot keep their minds on the subject the way that Singer did throughout an entire career. He could never stop thinking of it. It is what his books, however sexy, charming, or strange they may separately be, are always and finally about.\n\nYet what exactly do Singer’s many novels and stories mean? “I find myself full of faith and full of doubt,” he once said. A lifelong student of Spinoza, Kant, and Schopenhauer, a ceaseless reader in the literature of the occult, more than a browser in the wisdom literature of Judaism, Singer always possessed the literary appetite of the quester after ultimate meanings. Did he, it seems fair to ask, find any?\n\nIt is easy to ignore this question because Singer’s stories and novels provide so many subsidiary rewards. He recreated—or, perhaps better, reimagined—a world, that of East European Jewry, razed by the monstrousness of history; and the death of that world, as many have commented, seems to make Singer’s recreation of it all the more potent in its magic. Within it, he found an almost endless number of stories to tell, stories of piety and impiety, tradition and the flouting of tradition, stories of derring-do, comedy, sadness, horror, and love—always and endlessly love.\n\nOver and over again Singer insisted that at the heart of all good novels is a love story. “All stories,” he said, “are love stories.” And all Singer’s love stories dealt with sex, for he was a writer who gave ample credit to sex as a drive, a source of human pleasure and trouble, and (most useful for a teller of tales) complication. Some of Singer’s more old-fashioned readers used to complain about the sex in his fiction, but most of this sex, it must be stressed, is described with fine economy. Singer is never pornographic but instead powerfully suggestive. In Scum, his last, also very sex-ridden, novel, how this works is nicely on display early in the book when Singer notes merely about his forty-seven-year-old hero, Max Barabander: “What he could do with women no one, except the women involved, would believe.” La Rochefoucauld said that a filthy mind never sleeps, and here, surely, is a sentence for it to consider in the late night hours.\n\nOver the years critics have argued a fair amount about which are Singer’s greatest strengths and which his greatest weaknesses. Many are ready to jettison his two ample family-chronicle novels, The Family Moskat and The Manor. Neither of these books, it is true, is nearly so well-shaped or powerful as I. J. Singer’s The Brothers Ashkenazi, a great novel at whose center is perhaps the most extraordinary villain in all of literature, the entire country, no less, of Poland, which, I. J. Singer concludes, deserves all that it has suffered because of its horrendous treatment of the Jews. True enough, Isaac Bashevis Singer did not have his brother’s powers of construction, and The Family Moskat and The Manor are sometimes cumbersome, often creaky—both were written, as were all of Singer’s novels with the exception of Satan in Goray, for serialization in the Jewish Daily Forward. But both nevertheless contain magnificent things: characters, cityscapes, the sense of a destiny spun out of control, the feeling of life becoming unmoored without the anchor of tradition.\n\nOthers think Singer at his best in the mid-length novel—in such books as The Slave, The Magician of Lublin, or Enemies: A Love Story. Singer himself claimed to prefer the short story over all other forms, since in the short story “a writer can reach for perfection—more than in a novel.” Though there seems to be no critical unanimity on which are Singer’s best novels, there is general agreement on which are his best stories. A collection of the latter would include “Gimpel the Fool,” “The Gentleman from Cracow,” “Yentl the Yeshiva Boy” and “Taibele and Her Demon” (both of which originally appeared in COMMENTARY), “The Little Shoemakers,” “The Spinoza of Market Street,” perhaps “The Slaughterer” and “A Friend of Kafka.” Few of these stories, it is worth noting, have directly to do with the spirits from the nether world that are sometimes a strong element in his fiction.\n\nMany readers identify Singer with, and they think the less of him for, those novels and stories where this element, what Dan Jacobson once nicely termed “the brimstone area,” prevails.1 By the brimstone area, Jacobson means those supernatural elements—dybbuks, demons, imps, on occasion the devil himself—that usually are evoked by Singer to symbolize the power of evil. An admirer of Singer though he is, Jacobson’s is easily the best criticism of this element in Singer’s fiction. He argues that\n\nreaders who do not share his predispositions are entitled to find that the “symbolization” to which he refers is sometimes too easily brought about, too lovingly and lengthily dwelt upon, insufficiently used or explained in any subsequent action, and insufficiently distinguished from other symbols of the same kind in many other stories.\n\nDid Singer truly believe in such spirits? He often claimed that he did. At the same time, knowing how the world regards such beliefs, he was not above making fun of them, as when he told his biographer that demons were unlikely to flourish in Israel: “They like overcast skies, old houses. I have looked for demons in the Jewish state, but I have found very few.” Elsewhere he said that he would pay half a year’s income actually to see a ghost. Yet Singer, a man who distrusted and did not often use metaphors, was quite ready to avail himself of these most extravagant of all metaphors, creatures whom few but the mad have ever seen. He must have been agnostic yet hopeful on the subject. More important, he felt them useful to his fiction. “In a way demons express the human subconscious,” he told an interviewer. “But to me the demons also symbolize a life without any faith altogether.”\n\n_____________\n\nWhat Singer did believe in, without any question, was God. But to believe in God is not to claim to understand Him. Critics for whom the question of God is not, so to say, a lively one, attribute Singer’s power to other factors, from modernist technique to the glory of his storytelling. Still others hold that behind and beyond all the talk of God there is something else in Singer’s work that makes it appeal to the modern reader, suffused as that work is, as one critic has it, “with the prevailing contemporary sense of isolation, disintegration, alienation, and dread.” But what makes both the technique and the storytelling possible, why Singer is able to seem at once modern and traditional, is his interest in the endless question of what God has in mind, both for us and for the universe.\n\nThe persistent attention to this question gives Singer his right to be considered a major artist. Dan Jacobson touches on this point, in a somewhat skeptical way, when considering the absence of “place” in Yiddish writers:\n\nTheirs is the literature of a people without power (and all its accompanying evils and guilts), without the possession of land, without statehood or political organization, without the freedom to pursue a wide variety of occupations—the literature of a society that was in many immensely important respects maimed and deprived.\n\nAll this is quite true and to the point. Yet if your subject is the ways of God toward man, as it indubitably was Isaac Bashevis Singer’s, then the Jews of Eastern Europe, for all the reasons Jacobson mentions, are unquestionably your people. After a history of almost unremitting disenfranchisement and persecution, punctuated by pogroms and ending cataclysmically with Nazism, the Jews, above all people, have earned the right to ask certain fundamental questions of God.\n\nMany people in Singer’s stories and novels do ask. Asking itself, however, comes near to constituting a transgression. Asa Heshel Bannet, the central character in The Family Moskat, is a freethinker who, it turns out, is not very free after all. This same Asa Heshel, toward the end of the novel, reflects bitterly of God: “He creates easily and destroys easily. He has his own laboratory.” All Singer’s characters have free will—“without free will what is the difference between the throne of glory and the depths of the nether world?” asks a rabbi in the same novel. (Singer himself, during the question-and-answer sessions of his many lectures and readings, used to reply to the question of whether he himself believed in free will by answering: “Of course I believe in free will. What choice have I?”) Of Asa Heshel, his first wife observes: “He was one of those who must serve God or die. He had forsaken God, and because of this he was dead—a living body with a dead soul.” The simple if devastating point of The Family Moskat is that, without God, all of the novel’s characters are dead souls, walking corpses. The unforgettable last line of the novel, delivered by a subsidiary character, himself a freethinker, as he awaits the entry of the Nazis into Warsaw, is: “Death is the Messiah. That’s the real truth.”\n\nFree will, in an Isaac Bashevis Singer novel, usually comes down to little more than the freedom to choose God’s way—or to perish. Modern thought will avail a man nothing. As Rabbi Dan Katzenellenbogen tells his grandson Asa Heshel apropos of modern thinking, “The sum and substance of it is that any sin is permitted. That is the root of the matter.” Men—and less often women—in Singer’s novels and stories are tossed about by their doubts, dreams, desires. Singer’s characters suffer from Pascalian restlessness; they cannot sit, alone, quietly in a room for even an hour. “The main thing,” says Max Barabander in Scum, “was not to remain passive.” Singer himself once said: “We run away from boredom into wickedness, and there is almost nothing in between.” Well, there is one thing in between—subjects for the novelist.\n\n_____________\n\nSinger made nearly limitless use of the material that issues from this spiritual restlessness. As he told an interviewer in the Saturday Review as long ago as 1968:\n\nTo me, in my work, the religious question and the eternal question—why do we live, why do we exist?—are identical. I am not completely a religious writer, but neither am I secular. In my writing religion is always there—even when I write sexy.\n\nTo another interviewer he said:\n\nThe supernatural is always in my writing and somehow I always wanted to say to the reader that even though life looks to us chaotic, it is not as chaotic as we think. There is a scheme and design behind it.\n\nWhat was the scheme, which the design?\n\nSinger was never certain enough to say. In The Penitent, the narrator is told by the chief character whose story is at the center of the novel: “If you took one step farther, you’d become a full-fledged Jew.” To which he adds: “You also know all the good traits of the real Jew.” To this the narrator, clearly speaking for Singer, answers: “That’s not enough either. For this you must have faith that everything stated in the holy books was given to Moses on Mount Sinai. Unfortunately, I don’t have this faith.” One can only conjecture in so profound a realm, but my own guess is that Singer wanted this full faith, wanted it ardently, and never found it.\n\nHe looked for God, in whom he believed, everywhere. God is in the details, a famous remark has it, and so He lurks in many passages in Singer’s novels and stories. In a passage late in The Family Moskat, a spy is hung from a tree. “His bare feet dangled above the ditch. A butterfly danced about the fur shako.” Birds and cats go about their business in Singer’s pages as stars twinkle and the moon cleaves its way through clouds, and the heavens remain eternally the same as people struggle to get through their lives, writhe in their sleep under the burden of their small—though not small to them—worries. There must be a plan behind all this. As Singer writes in The Penitent, echoing an old philosophical staple:\n\nIf someone found a watch on an island and said it had been made by itself or that it developed through evolution, he would be considered a lunatic. But according to modern science, the universe evolved all on its own. Is the universe less complicated than a watch?\n\nBecause Singer was always interested in the larger design, he was for the most part dismissive, even contemptuous, of politics, especially utopian left-wing politics. In one of his stories, “Guests on a Winter Night,” he remarks that, of anarchists and radical students, his mother told him, “these sinful creatures had lost both their world and the world to come.” Abram Shapiro, the licentious, contradictory, and finally most winning character in The Family Moskat, asked his opinion of who is to blame for the crisis of the Jews in Poland with Hitler at the borders, replies:\n\nHuman nature. You can call a man capitalist, Bolshevik, Jew, goy, Tartar, Turk, anything you want, but the real truth is that man is a stinker. If you beat him, he yells. And if the other fellow is beaten, then he develops a theory. Maybe it’ll be better in the next world.\n\nAs for this world, Singer, from the outset, has always seemed to favor the modest, the traditional, the pious among his characters. Men and women who have accepted life in the full harshness of its terms, who go about their business, their prayers, their unquestioning routines—these Singer admires above all. “It’s these little nobodies who for two thousand years have carried all of Jewry on their backs,” says Asa Heshel in The Family Moskat, “as well as all of Christendom. It is they who have always turned the other cheek.” Where things go wrong for characters in a Singer story or novel is precisely at the point where they desert the faith and ways of their fathers, be it in the shtetl of Frampol, in Warsaw, in New York, Israel, or Buenos Aires. That way lies Gehenna.\n\nThat way, too, lies some superior fiction. Singer unlooses his magicians, his yeshiva boys rattled by enlightened ideas, his women swept away by vanity, and the games begin. Almost always they are sex games. Because the possibility of redemption must be present in his fiction, Singer works best with philanderers. Breaking the seventh commandment makes for better fiction anyway than breaking the sixth: redemption from murder seems distinctly less convincing than redemption from adultery. Besides, adultery, as in the bad old joke about incest, is a game the entire family can play. It is perhaps the most human of sins. As a writer, Singer played a great many variations upon it. Only toward the close did the game begin to run down.\n\n_____________\n\nA Dark vein had always run through Singer’s writing (“man is a stinker,” etc.). But for the better part of his career he was best thought of as a tragicomedian. Comedy is possible even on the road to perdition, and Singer was adept at wringing high-spirited laughter from his depictions of characters as various as Gimpel the Fool and Yasha Mazur, his magician from Lublin. But in his later years the laughter was not even hollow; in fact, it was not there. Singer claimed not to be interested in preaching or sending messages, but reading the flat stories in The Death of Methuselah (1988) one could conclude only that its author’s view of human beings ended with the observation that men are animals and women whores—case closed. In his last published novel, Scum, the redemption of Max Barabander is not even considered. “Oh, Mama, I’m sinking into filth up to my neck,” he cries toward the close of the novel. Singer just lets him go under.\n\nHow account for this? What could have happened to make Singer, in his last years, so dark—and, one must add, so much less interesting—a writer? For the last twenty years of his life, the world treated him as a great man, showering every sort of pleasing attention upon him, ending with the Nobel Prize, which he won in 1978. He had money, critical acclaim, adoring readers, longevity, every reason to feel a sense of impressive achievement. Yet however playful he may have been at lectures, or with interviewers, or among friends, his late work reveals a writer who found people more disgusting than interesting. Why had his skies become so clouded? Critics used to complain that Singer often had problems with his endings: there is a problem with the ending of his own career.\n\nThe inclement Isaac Bashevis Singer is nowhere more evident than in The Penitent, a brief novel of 1983. That book, which tells the story of Joseph Shapiro, turns out to be an unrelieved philippic against modernity. Modern culture, Joseph Shapiro claims, is good for breeding only “cynics and whores.” Modern philosophy, he avers, has a single theme: “We don’t know anything and we cannot know anything.” Newspapers pay “tribute to every idolatry and spit at the truth.” Crime is on the loose and it is the job of lawyers to see that criminals go free. Animals, God’s creatures, are slaughtered in the most hideous ways; when it comes to animals, says Joseph, “every man is a Nazi.” The sum total of psychoanalysis is always “that someone else was guilty.” And Jews, at least Jews without faith, are no better than anyone else. “Every few months they find a new idol, a new illusion, a new vogue, a new madness. They revere all kinds of murderers, whores, false prophets, clowns. They go wild over every little scribbler, every ham actor, every harlot.” But enough.\n\nIn an author’s note at the end of this novel, Singer makes plain that it was not possible for him to share Joseph Shapiro’s belief in “a final escape from the human dilemma, a permanent rescue for all time” where Joseph finds it: in a “return to Jewishness, and not merely to some modern arbitrary Jewishness, but to the Jewishness of my grandfathers and great-grandfathers.” But it is plain enough that Singer did share much of his character’s unrelenting diagnosis of the hideousness of modern life. At one point in this novel, recounting a relapse into sin after his pledge to return to purity, Joseph says to the narrator, “That’s how it is with adultery, with theft, with murder, with a craze for honors or for revenge. There is always a letdown. I don’t have to tell you about that.”\n\nDid life let Singer down in some fundamental way that turned him so against it at the close? He insisted that one could be religious and rebellious simultaneously, believing in God and arguing with Him at the same time: “Those who dedicate their lives to serving God have often dared to question His justice, and to rebel against His seeming neutrality in man’s struggle between good and evil.”\n\nIn the end, it was the prevalence of evil that Singer found overwhelming. He was too good—which is to say, too honest—a writer to report things other than precisely as he found them. Why this dark and troubled truth, coming from a powerful writer at the end of his career, should make for not very interesting art is another question.\n\nWhat is not in question is that Singer’s stories and novels figure to have as long a life as those of any other writer of the past 50 years. He was one of the last living links with the Jewish past in Poland. He wrote in a language that had been given up for dead almost from the time he began to use it and into which he pumped impressive new life. That he survived, endured, triumphed, is as astonishing, even miraculous, a story as any he himself could have written."
