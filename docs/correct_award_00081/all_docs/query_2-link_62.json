        "text": "About the Book\n\nTranslation of: Der Ã²kenig fun di felder.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nA fictional exploration of primitive history, Singer's novel portrays an age of superstition and violence in a country emerging from the darkness of savagery. Part parable of modern civilization, part fascinating historical novel, it reaffrims the author's reputation as a master storyteller.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"[Singer's] vision and imagination are stronger than ever, and whether one reads the book as a parable of modern civilization and its discontents or as unadulterated fantasy, one is indelibly transfixed.\" --Library Journal\n\n\"The strength of I. B. Singer's novel comes from the language, as it constantly undermines the flow of the narrative by infusing into the text - written in Yiddish and translated into English by the author - Polish words and phrases.\" --The New York Times\n\nAbout the Author"
