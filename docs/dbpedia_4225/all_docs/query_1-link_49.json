        "text": "June grew long. I listened for the cicada when all along, the sun was held inside you like a stone holds heat - the memory of something good. Summer rain. The wet that holds the pavement before fading (like winter is forgotten) and so far away, youâ€™re listening for words I sent to you. How red the bloom that comes from deep inside of you How blue the moon that comes from all the seas in you In the street, I watch how people say goodbye to those they need. They speak it all from shiny eyes in weighted heat, we cut through it like children half asleep. Dark falls. I see you in the window with a furrowed brow, I walk a little closer till I see just how you always want to find a better way. How red the bloom that comes from deep inside of you How blue the moon that comes from all the seas in you How red the bloom How blue the moon How red the bloom How blue the moon\n\nWhere are you going, on foot or on wing? Feathered and weary in your wandering I've kept a quiet place here for you It's all I could do Up with the crackle of radio news Up with the creak in the wood as you move I dreamt a year disappeared in one night Time was unwinding Love is a pale thing darkened by dreaming Love is a soft thing sharpened by seeing Love is a light thing lifted by sighing Love is a dark thing How do you listen, in dusk or at dawn? Do you hear more when the daylight is gone? I've spoken thousands of words just for you It's all I could do I know how your hand holds the pen to your jaw I know how your fingers will curve toward thought You are a question I keep for myself All this unwinding Love is a pale thing darkened by dreaming Love is a soft thing sharpened by seeing Love is a light thing lifted by sighing Love is a dark thing"
