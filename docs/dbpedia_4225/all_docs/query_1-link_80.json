Introduction Russell McDougall and Iain Davidson Figure 0.1 This book is a product of one of those happy pieces of serendipity that can occur in universities. Both editors had an interest in the work of members of the Roth family, Davidson as an archaeologist interested in the documentation of the material culture of 19th-century Aborigines, and McDougall as a scholar of postcolonial literatures encountering the Roth name and legend through the fiction of Caribbean novelist and essayist Wilson Harris. We discovered our mutual interest through competition for the same books in the library, and, our curiosity piqued by the coincidence of interest by people of such apparently distinct disciplines, we began to talk. It soon emerged that the grand theme in studies of the Roth family was the question of the relation between a nascent anthropology and a colonial administration. We convened a conference and might have been content with that. But it established a dialogue among scholars working on the Roths across a remarkable number of different disciplines, and we wanted not only to continue but also to provide some broader access to that dialogue. Seven descendants of Mathias Roth, the Hungarian founder of this remarkable family, also attended the conference. Some had not met or even known of each other before. All were intrigued that their family should excite scholarly interest and attract people from overseas to attend a conference in Australia. For both of us, one of the highlights was to be greeted in the foyer of the hotel adjacent to the conference venue with a cheery 'Hello, my name is Walter E Roth', a mere hundred years after Wally's grandfather of the same name was Chief Protector of Aborigines for Queensland. Family One of the themes of this book, then, is family. How did one family produce two great names - Henry Ling Roth (1855-1925) and Walter Edmund Roth (1861-1933) - in one discipline, anthropology, at a time when the discipline itself was so young? And how did so many others of the family - Felix Norman Roth (1857-1921), Vincent Roth (1889-1967) and George Kingsley Roth (1903-60) - come to make their own contributions to the same discipline? Part of the answer is provided in the figure of Mathias Roth. Hungarian by birth, Jewish yet from a town where Jews were not allowed to live, he left his homeland after the failed Hungarian revolution of 1848. Henry, Walter and Felix were three of his seven sons and two daughters, all born in England after his marriage to a Christian woman, Anna Maria Collins. In an atmosphere of pluralistic religious pragmatism, and a household that provided the focus of a cosmopolitan society of liberal-minded people from all over Europe, the Roth family 'made otherness the norm' as Judit Brody - herself a refugee from Hungary to England after the Russian invasion of 1956 - phrases it in Chapter 1 of this volume. Mathias was a medical doctor, a follower of the approach to healthy living of the Swedish gymnast Per Henrik Ling (from whom Henry got his second name). Among Mathias's sons, Bernard (1852-1915), Felix, Reuter (1858-1924) and Walter all qualified medically, while Alfred died before qualifying. Further details of the family are set out in Chapter 2 by Barrie Reynolds, who has been researching a biography of Walter Roth for 20 years. Travel Henry initially entered business as an accountant with the Austro-Hungarian Bank and then with Kann, Roth and Co. in London, but in 1875 he accepted an offer to help manage a sugar plantation in British Guiana. He stayed only six months in the West Indies, as his employer failed to honour the agreement. For two years after that he managed the estates of Munro Butler-Johnstone in the Samara province of eastern Russia. Following publication of his Notes on the Agriculture and Peasantry of Eastern Russia in 1878, he was commissioned by English businessmen to investigate the Queensland sugar industry (HL Roth 1880). He had an uncle in Australia, his mother's brother, and he leapt at the opportunity. Felix followed him out a few years later. He was a ship's engineer at this stage, trading for tortoiseshell and other exotic items up and down the east coast of Australia[RF4]. Around the southern parts of New Guinea he traded flatiron for spearheads and knives and cartridges for old Snider rifles in return for bird of paradise skins. Sometimes too he was engaged on the 'coffin ships' (tramp steamers) and mail boats, but he preferred to avoid these if he could. In Brisbane for a while he helped a black Barbadian friend, Jack Dowridge ('The Black Diamond'), run his boxing saloon. In later life Felix was full of wild tales of pearl prospecting, shark fishing, cargo broaching, shipwrecks and native attacks in the islands. But in 1881 he married, and returned to England to study medicine. Bernard by this time had joined his father in orthopaedic practice, specialising in the treatment of lateral curvature of the spine, although he also published on medical gymnastics and the sanitary aspects of dress (Plarr 1930:246). But Reuter had only just matriculated when Felix arrived home from the South Seas, and no doubt his brother's tales of adventure assisted his own decision to emigrate. Reuter spent most of his life in Sydney, and was one of the founders of the St John Ambulance Association in New South Wales, as well as being prominent in establishing the Royal Life-Saving Society and the Red Cross Society in Sydney ('Obituary' 1914:1083). Henry was Honorary Secretary of the Mackay Planters' and Farmers' Association (Queensland) from 1881 to 1884. He worked in Mackay as an agent for the wealthy agricultural scientist and founder of Rothamstead Experimental Station in England, Sir JB Lawes. But after Felix's departure, he too returned to England. Next he accepted a commission to France, reporting to British interests on the dairy-farming industry, peasant proprietorship and continental systems of irrigation (see HL Roth 1882, 1885a, 1885b). Then Walter decided to emigrate, leaving his marriage to elope with a woman who died soon after their arrival in the colony in 1887. Reynolds provides the detail of Walter's early years in Australia in Chapter 2. In 1894 Walter was appointed government surgeon attached to hospitals in far western Queensland first at Boulia then at Cloncurry and Normanton, and in 1898 he became the state's first Northern Protector of Aborigines. He served in that position until 1904, when he was made Chief Protector. In 1904 he was seconded to head the Royal Commission into the condition of Aboriginals in north-west Western Australia. Henry married, settled in Halifax and acquired the part-time position of Curator of the Bankfield Museum in June 1890, graduating to its part-time and finally to full-time Keeper. He built the previously chaotic institution into a model teaching museum of prime importance. Felix's marriage was less happy, and he escaped it by entering the Medical Service of the Niger Coast Protectorate in West Africa, where he was stationed from 1892 to 1898. Henry writes: 'When Benin was captured the King [ie the Oba] escaped and my brother with three officers was sent after him into the bush. The hardship was so great that these three officers died within twelve months, while my brother got blackwater fever and was incapacitated whereupon the grateful Government gave him the Noble Order of the Boot' (Norman-Roth nd:3). Returning to England, Felix discovered that he had already been reported dead in the press. In fact, he died of heart failure on 11 November 1921 in Monte Carlo, aged 65. Anthropology Henry Ling Roth The family's [RF5]first contributions to anthropology were made by Henry Ling, who like many British ethnologists of his time saw no necessity to visit the peoples and places that he wrote about. Thus he never visited Tasmania, although the heavily revised second edition of his first book, The Aborigines of Tasmania (1899), remained the basic source until publication of George Augustus Robinson's journals in 1966. The first edition of Henry's book was published in 1890 in a limited edition of 200 copies. In his Preface, Edward Tylor praised Roth's picture of 'the extinct native race of Tasmania' as approaching 'absolute completeness' (HL Roth 1890a). In the recent controversy surrounding attempts to downplay the degree of settler violence against the Tasmanians, attention has turned again to Henry's work (see McDougall forthcoming). Henry also did not visit Sarawak or Benin, although he wrote major works about the indigenous cultures of both places. Robert Hampson considers the Sarawak material in Chapter 3, and Russell McDougall discusses the West African work in Chapter 4. While Henry's principal contributions to early anthropology were based on careful scholarly synthesis of the observations of others - Great Benin: Its Customs, Arts and Horrors (1903) is partly based on first-hand accounts by his brother Felix, The Natives of Sarawak and British North Borneo 2 Vols. (1896) is based chiefly on the papers of Hugh Brooke Low - it cannot be said that his approach was simply derivative. Henry enunciated the principle that anthropology is 'essential to every civilised community which trades with, or is called upon to govern native communities' (quoted by Hampson in Chapter 3 of this volume). He believed that colonial administrators, in their management of indigenous peoples, needed to take account of the level of civilisation they had achieved. Body marking, in his view, was one way to determine that level. Alice Gorman discusses Henry's various studies of body marking in Chapter 5. Henry's published output was as prodigious as it was culturally and geographically diverse. Great Benin was republished as recently as 1969 in the US. He extended his work on Sarawak and Borneo into a book entitled Oriental Silverwork, Malay and Chinese ... A Handbook for Connoisseurs, Collectors, Students and Silversmiths (1910). It was revived for publication in 1966 and again in 1993, and remains 'a standard reference' for scholars and collectors of antique Malay and Peranakan silver (Fraser-Lu 1993:vii). His writings about Pacific cultures also were extensive (see McDougall & Croft 2005), although he was not able to complete before his death the major work on tattoo and the decorative arts that he planned. The Maori Mantle (1923) was said by Sir Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hiroa) to contain 'the most intensive work that has so far been published on any Polynesian craft' (1924:77). Perhaps the most ambitious of his many writings on weaving, spinning and handmade textiles, it was reprinted in 1979. Studies in Primitive Looms (1918) was reprinted in 1934, 1950 and again in 1977, and remains an important source for contemporary artisans. Henry also established the long and successful Bankfield Museum Notes series of publications, 23 numbers in all, primarily based around the museum's own ethnographic collections (now dispersed and lost forever) and financed entirely from his own pocket. Walter Edmund Roth Figure 0.2 But it is Henry's younger brother, Walter, who is probably the most remarkable figure in the history of anthropology. Reynolds in Chapter 2 provides the outline of his life, and John Mulvaney lays out the intellectual roots and contexts of his pioneering work in anthropology in Chapter 6. One of the motivations for this book, and the conference that preceded it, was the claim that Baldwin Spencer and Frank Gillen were the founders of fieldwork-based anthropology (Morphy 1997), systematising a discipline that has otherwise been based on unsystematic observations and anecdotes from travellers and geographers. Yet Walter's first great work, Ethnological Studies among the North-West-Central Queensland Aborigines (1897), preceded their first book, and it too was based on fieldwork. Mulvaney shows how enmeshed were the lives and careers of Spencer and Roth and goes some way toward providing the re-assessment of Roth that he proposed in his 1985 biography of Spencer (Mulvaney & Calaby 1985:387). Mulvaney's chapter is the first chapter by an archaeologist. In Chapter 7 Iain Davidson, also an archaeologist, deals directly with North West Central Queensland. Davidson shows that despite the dreadful destruction of Aboriginal societies - people for whom Walter cared as a doctor, and studied as an anthropologist - there is both oral knowledge and archaeological evidence to fill the gaps in his account. In another example of survival of oral history, Larissa Behrendt's (2003) assessment of the accounts of Eliza Fraser's shipwreck and survival on Fraser Island in the 1830s and Olga Miller's (1998) oral history of the Aboriginal perspective on the same events suggests the more recent evidence is the more accurate. This enables us to understand better the constraints under which Walter Roth undertook his anthropological investigations. Whatever the constraints and however deep the destruction of people and society, those who survived still spoke the languages they had been brought up with - and some still do. Walter made every effort to record the languages of the peoples he worked with. In Chapter 8 Gavan Breen, himself an authority on a number of these same languages, synthesises and assesses all of Roth's linguistic work. This will doubtless become a standard starting point for considering North Queensland languages, and it has only been possible because, as Breen says, of Walter's ability 'to elicit vocabulary correctly from an unfamiliar language was as good as that of a competent modern linguist'. Walter's other great contribution to Australian Aboriginal studies was through his material culture collections - often the focus of interest for archaeologists. In Chapter 10 Richard Robins considers the importance of his collections in the Queensland Museum and something of their original motivation; and in Chapter 11 Kate Khan discusses the larger collection that Walter controversially sold to the Australian Museum. Robins emphasises the importance of Walter's documentation of his collections through his publication. He also stresses that the collections had little impact in raising awareness of Aboriginal culture in Queensland. Khan considers the reasons why Walter sold the bulk of his collection to the Australian Museum - an act that formed one of the ostensible pretexts for political opposition to him in Queensland. Colonial Administration and Controversy From the publication of his Ethnological Studies in 1897 to his departure from Queensland in 1906, Walter's life was increasingly taken up with colonial administration and controversy. This history is determined to large degree by another significant 1897 publication: the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act. In the following year Walter was appointed Protector of Aboriginals for the Northern and Central Division, which involved a move to Cooktown, in Cape York Peninsula. This was a position created and defined by the 1897 Act. Perusal of Walter's annual reports shows that he was concerned about the implementation of the Act, and he records the instances in which Aboriginal people in each town were in court for offences relating to alcohol and opium - a practice not followed by his successors. Boulia, where Walter had originally been posted as medical officer, was the centre of a region where the endemic, nicotine-based drug pituri was traded (Watson 1983). Here he recorded no instances of opium abuse in the courts, partly because there may have been fewer Asians selling opium, but perhaps because the indigenous [RF6]trade he documented was still going on - as, indeed, knowledge of it continued into the 1970s. Because of its sections about the sale of opium, the Act affected people of Asian origin as well as Aborigines. As Regina Ganter shows in Chapter 9, interactions between Aborigines, non-Aborigines and Asians were complex in relation to both employment and intermarriage. Walter clashed with the Southern Protector, Archibald Meston, who was one of the architects of the Act, over the removal of Aboriginal people to reserves. Walter's approach was apparently more sympathetic to their remaining on their ancestral lands. When Meston was removed from office, Walter became Chief Protector, and Meston became his enemy, campaigning publicly against him. The opposition of Queensland's pastoralists may have been a point in favour of Walter's appointment to head Australia's first Royal Commission into the treatment of Aborigines. So might the fact that he had never been to Western Australia before. He was generally well informed, fearless and impartial. As President of the anthropological section of the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science (1902) and an honorary member of both the Berlin Anthropological Institute and the Anthropological Society of Florence, his credentials also were impeccable. Curiously, the Governor of Western Australia at the time was Sir Frederick Bedford, who had led Walter's brother Felix in the attack against Chief Nana in the Niger Coast Protectorate several years earlier. In Chapter 13 Geoffrey Gray explores the effects of Walter's actions as Royal Commissioner, investigating the much publicised and debated condition of Aboriginals in Western Australia. The recommendations of the Roth Royal Commission were for the most part intended to bring race relations more securely 'under the rule of law', granting greater powers to the Chief Protector (in part to prevent sexual relations between black and white), but they also included some measures aimed at preserving traditional lifestyles - such as the establishment of native reserves. Predictably, the Report caused a furore when it was tabled in the Western Australian parliament, and generated great debate in the local press, and Walter again was the subject of ridicule, particularly from the pastoralists. But it was discussed much more favourably in the British House of Commons, and so could not be ignored. Roth's recommendations led directly to the many reforms of the 1905 Aborigines Act, including the abolition of neck chains for native prisoners. But the Roth Report did little substantially to alter the condition of the Aboriginal population in Western Australia. And the international attention it received proved ironically counter-productive in other areas of darkness[RF7]. After hearing of the harsh treatment of Aborigines in Western Australia, King Leopold of Belgium, for example, 'refused to accept British strictures on Belgian atrocities in the Congo' (Healy 1979:209; see also The Sadness of a Dying Race). Gray's view is that the negative impact on Aborigines of a number of the policy outcomes of the Commission could not have been envisaged by its author, who stated unambiguously in his Report that 'the cruelties and abuses met with in the unsettled areas cannot be longer hidden or tolerated' (quoted by Gray, Chapter 13). Back in Queensland, Walter was under fire from influential people in the white society of Cooktown, who petitioned the state Member for Cook against his reappointment as Chief Protector. This was tabled in the Legislative Assembly in November 1905. Walter answered each of the accusations, and the petition was rejected. Within a year, however, he resigned his post and left Australia forever. Ann McGrath and Helen Pringle discuss the dirty campaign against Walter in more detail in Chapter 12 and in Chapter 14. Although, as McGrath documents, the opposition was fierce from white men outraged at being forced by the Act and the Protector to pay Aboriginal workers and to refrain from sexual relations with Aboriginal women, Walter was also accused of peddling pornography. He had used the word himself in the famous final section of his 1897 monograph, although as Pringle says, the subject matter was hardly the stuff we would call pornography today. While Walter was away conducting the Royal Commission into the condition of Aborigines in Western Australia, the argument became heated. It turned upon a photograph he had taken, apparently to prove a point made by a small line drawing in the 1897 book, which had subsequently been disputed. McDougall points out in Chapter 4, in his discussion of Felix's West African photographs, that photography had been an important ethnographic tool at least since the 1850s. Yet the history of anthropological photography is so chequered, particularly in relation to its apparent fetishising of sexual subjects, that many modern anthropologists remain uneasy about its validity. Certainly Walter was not alone in showing an anthropological interest in sexual matters. After all, Malinowski's Sexual Life of Savages (1932) is one of the founding texts of modern anthropology. Pringle observes that Walter was particularly interested in genital cutting. The contentious photograph, of an Aboriginal man and woman in coitus, was intended to demonstrate an unusual sex position as important evidence that the cutting of the penis did not prevent fertilisation. In Walter's view, however, the photograph was simply the proof of a scientific argument. However, we have chosen not to reproduce the offending photograph in this book. It is clear from Pringle's and McGrath's evidence that there was a systematic campaign against Walter, purportedly beating up a moral controversy, yet in reality responding to his attempts to curb both the economic and sexual exploitation of Aborigines. Still, by present standards, McGrath suggests, Walter's photograph places him ironically among those many other white men in colonial Queensland whom he opposed as sexual opportunists. In effect, he compromised the integrity of his own efforts to protect the Aboriginal subjects in his care, depriving them of their dignity before the camera lens. When Downing Street requested a report on Walter's services, and upon the circumstances leading to his resignation, the Governor of Queensland, Lord Chelmsford, wrote ungenerously: 'Although Dr. Roth during the time he held the position of Chief Protector of Aborigines did valuable work there were a number of complaints with regard to the manner in which he, at times, performed his duties'.i So ended Walter Roth's career in Australia. British Guiana The official reason for Walter's resignation as Chief Protector of Aborigines in Queensland was ill health. But then why would he have applied immediately to the Imperial Government for a post in British Guiana (now Guyana)? He spent 23 years in the British Colonial Service there, first as the government medical officer, magistrate and Protector of Indians in the Pomeroon district, then as Stipendiary Magistrate of the Demerara River District. He was later Government Archivist and Curator of the Georgetown Museum. He wrote three major works, all published by the US Bureau of American Ethnology: An Inquiry into the Animism and Folklore of the Guiana Indians (1915), An Introductory Study of the Arts, Crafts, and Customs of the Guiana Indians (1924) and Additional Studies of the Arts, Crafts, and Customs of the Guiana Indians, with Special Reference to those of Southern British Guiana (1929). He also translated a number of the important earlier works of the region's ethnographic and travel literature from the Dutch and German sources (Van Berkel 1925; MR Schomburgk 1922-23; RH Schomburgk 1931). Neil Whitehead gives an overview in Chapter 15 of Walter's ethnology of British Guiana. While understandable, it is a shame that his Guiana work is so little known in Australia, or for that matter that his Australian writings are not better known in Guyana, Venezuela and Surinam. The Walter Roth Papers in Georgetown suggest, for instance, that shortly before his departure from Australia he must have met the German anthropologist Hermann Klaatsch (1863-1916), as a number of Klaatsch's photographs are held there. Walter's Queensland fieldwork undoubtedly laid the foundation for his subsequent[RF8] Amerindian researches. In British Guiana, whenever a difficulty of interpretation presented itself, Walter naturally searched his Australian experience for some clue or point of reference (see McDougall 2002, 1998). He contrasts Amerindian powers of visual mimicry - the use of visual camouflage or decoys as a hunting skill - with Queensland Aboriginals' use of smell to make an inanimate object imitate the presence of a human being (by placing a spear moistened with sweat in the path of a kangaroo, for example, to turn the animal in the direction of the hunter). More importantly, perhaps, the comparison moves him to conclude that fraud and imposture (unlike mimicry) are a result of colonisation: they come as a result of the Indian's envy of the white man and his aping the low-caste European with whom it usually was his unfortunate lot to come into contact (WE Roth 1921:34; see also, in Roth 1903:16, his 'Suggested explanation of the \"black jump-up white-fellow\" idea'). He concludes: I find great consolation in knowing that though the principle which governed my efforts on behalf of the North Queensland aboriginals could not be carried out in its entirety, owing to the scarcity of first-class upright conscientious missionary men and women willing to sacrifice their lives for the benefit of the savage, I strained every point to secure immense Reserves where the natives are confined, where fire-arms, trade, clothes, and Europeans are not permitted, with the result that the race is allowed to work out its own destiny and suffered to live and die in peace' (WE Roth 1921:34). This hints at the degree of influence Roth's Australian experience must have had upon his framing of the Aboriginal Protection Acts in British Guiana. Remarkably, in both countries he worked towards conditions similar to those suggested by the Act in Queensland, with regulated wages, reserves and removals of children for their protection. In Chapter 16 Janette Bulkan and Arif Bulkan explore the legacy of Walter Roth's colonial administration in British Guiana, and observe its continuing influence upon legislation affecting the lives of Amerindians in modern Guyana. AP Elkin credited Walter Roth as the founder of social anthropology in Australia, and the obituary published in the Georgetown Daily Chronicle dubbed him 'the father of Ethnology in British Guiana' (WIG 1933:2). He was, at the time of his death in 1933, the sole life member of the American Anthropological Association. The Next Generation Vincent Roth, OBE 1951 Walter had a number of children from different marriages and other relationships. Only Vincent Roth, born in Brisbane, followed in his father's footsteps. In 1907, when he arrived in British Guiana to join his father, Vincent was 18. He spent the next 30 years in the interior, working as a surveyor and magistrate, and then only departed for Barbados after the blackwater fever had nearly killed him. Folklorist, historian, legislator, naturalist and long-serving Honorary Secretary of the Royal Agriculture and Commercial Society, Vincent contributed immensely to the development of Guyana. He was also the author of many works of natural history and wildlife, including Fish Life in British Guiana: A Popular Guide to the Colonial Fishes (1943), Notes and Observations on Animal Life in British Guiana, 1907-1941: A Popular Guide to Colonial Mammalia (1943), Path-Finding on the Mazaruni: The Journal of Six Expeditions on the Banks of the Mazaruni River in British Guiana in Search of an Alignment for a Road or Railway during the Years 1922, 1923 and 1924 (1949), A Plea for the Better Conservation and Protection of Wild Life in British Guiana, together with a Comparative Schedule of the Wild Life Protection Laws in other English-Speaking Lands and a Proposed Wild Life Protection Ordinance (1949) and Tales of the Trails (c 1960). Michael Bennett, Vincent's son-in-law and the editor of his diaries (Bennett 2003a, 2003b), provides a sketch of Vincent's life and his contribution to the cultural history of Guyana in Chapter 17. George Kingsley Roth, OBE 1957, CMG 1954 Henry Ling Roth married Nancy Harriette Haigh at Lightcliffe in June 1893. They had two sons, Alfred Bernard (1898-1951) and George Kingsley (1903-60), named after the famed African traveller Mary Kingsley. Alfred took a degree in colour chemistry at the University of Liverpool and devoted most of his working life to managing John Bright and Co.'s carpet mill at Rochdale (near Halifax). George Kingsley studied initially at the University of Liverpool, but after his father's death in 1928 he applied for a position with the Colonial Office in the Far East. In 1928 he joined the colonial administration in Fiji, and except for a short stint at Zanzibar (1937) he served there more or less continuously from that time. He produced two important books: the fourth edition of Fiji: Handbook of the Colony (1936), which described in detail the history, economy, culture and administrative organisation of the colony; and Fijian Way of Life (1953), which celebrated both the traditional culture and the contemporary administrative and social structure. It is the latter that provides Julian Croft's focus in Chapter 18. George Kingsley was Secretary for Fijian Affairs from 1954 until his retirement in 1957, when he returned to England and became Honorary Keeper of the Fijian Collection at Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. His brother, Alfred, willed his estate to the Museum; and the George Kingsley Roth Fund, established at Christ's College, now supports scholarship at Cambridge in East Asian, South Asian and Pacific Basin studies. As George W Stocking (1993) pointed out over a decade ago: 'Ironically, as the link between anthropology and colonialism became more widely accepted within the discipline during the 1960s and 1970s, serious interest in examining the link diminished'. More recently the relationship between anthropology and colonial administration has become the subject of contentious discussion (eg Thomas 1994; Cheater 1986). But there has been little sustained biographical or empirical focus to the discussion. This book aims to examine the relationship between colonial administration and anthropology, across a range of colonial and cultural contexts, through consideration of the multiple contributions of the remarkable Roth family. We emphasise Walter Roth's contribution in particular because of the importance of his empirical contributions and the depth of his involvement in colonial administration. Between 1901 and 1906, apart from his regular administrative reports to the Police Commissioner in Brisbane concerning Aboriginal welfare, Walter published 18 bulletins on northern Queensland ethnography. He laid the foundation for ethnography in northern Queensland; and in British Guiana his work was similarly foundational. Walter's ethnography of Guyana's Indians has a cross-cultural potentiality built into it that extends beyond Latin America and the Caribbean to northern Queensland. Yet he did not attempt any grand overarching theory. Rather he simply brought into juxtaposition materials not cross-referenced before so that they might resonate intellectually and excite the curiosity of those who followed - as they did, for example, the novelist Wilson Harris in Guyana. Of the family members considered here, only Henry was not active in colonial administration. Yet his anthropological work on Benin and Sarawak relied heavily on the first-hand experience of those who were involved - his brother Felix with the Niger Coast Protectorate and Hugh Brooke Low with the Sarawak Government Service. In any case, a number of the theoretical issues suggested by Henry's anthropology also are part of the context for Walter's work, underscoring the philosophy that made his protection of Aboriginal people unpopular in Queensland and led to his departure for British Guiana. In part at least, Henry's lack of profile in modern anthropology is a result of the ideological embedding in his work of an evolutionist 'hierarchy of races'.ii This was the dominant paradigm of Victorian anthropology, and while it was discredited in the early 20th century by Franz Boas and others working away from alleged biological fixities and categories of 'race' and toward a more 'plastic' conception of cultural identity, it did not entirely disappear. Rather, it found its métier through Europe's need to manage its empires, in a hugely diverse range of cultural contexts where anthropology functioned in the service of colonial administration, and by the similar needs of the United States with its 'internal colonialism' of American Indians (O'Flaherty & Shapiro 2002). Henry questioned the relativities of some of the racial types yet embraced the overall system of physical anthropology (see McDougall 2002). And his son, Kingsley, took into the field the lingering hierarchies of that earlier science as they appeared in the new salvage anthropology. Confined to armchair anthropology by health and marriage, Henry was in many ways proto-Boasian, recording in as much detail as possible the supposedly vanishing races and their cultures. There is now an intellectual suspicion of those whose emphasis was on gathering information, rather than on assisting the cultural survival of the peoples they studied. Yet the same racial typologies were at work in the cultural anthropology of empire management. In British Guiana as in Queensland, the protectionist agenda that Walter administered (and indeed helped to establish) contributed dramatically, though unintentionally, to the racialising of colonial society. In Queensland, Walter had been pleased by the opportunity for fieldwork that colonial service gave him. So, when things went bad there, his main reason for accepting the Imperial Government's offer of a post in British Guiana was to conduct an 'ethnographical survey' of its indigenous peoples.iii After some years, however, he began to think that the 'official life' of administration was 'scientifically wasteful', and he looked for 'some congenial billet' in the US.iv Failing that, he hoped the Smithsonian Institute might be induced to engage him at least on some temporary 'piece of South American work' that would be of 'mutual advantage'.v But when the US decided to enter the war the financial commitment involved in that decision dashed all his hopes. He was caught permanently then on the horns of a dilemma: reviewers of his anthropological works regretted that he did not say how he came by his information; but if he answered their objection, he risked the authorities thinking that he neglected his official duties.vi In the first 16 years, he took hardly a single holiday from colonial service.vii Yet his anthropological achievements are enormous. As modern scholarship continues to unpick and re-work the complex colonial entanglements of colonial administration and anthropology the work of the Roth family - Henry, Felix, Vincent, George Kingsley and especially Walter - deserves a new focus.
