        "text": "Description\n\nGEO2_LS identifies the household's constituency within Lesotho in 2006. Constituencies are the second level administrative units of the country, after districts. A GIS map (in shapefile format), corresponding to GEO2_LS can be downloaded from the GIS Boundary files page in the IPUMS International web site.\n\nThe full set of geography variables for Lesotho can be found in the IPUMS International Geography variables list. For cross-national geographic analysis on the first and second major administrative level refer to GEOLEV1, and GEOLEV2. More information on IPUMS-International geography can be found here.\n\nComparability â€” General\n\nWhere officially-defined constituencies have populations less than 20,000, they have been regionalized (combined) with neighboring constituencies.\n\nConstituencies for 1996 are not included in this spatially harmonized variable due to substantial changes in boundaries, specifically containing constituencies entirely within districts in Lesotho. Year-specific values are available for GEO2_LS1996."
