        "text": "Geography\n\nLesotho is an enclave in the mountainous regions of South Africa. The land has a total area of 30,360 km² (11,722 mi²). This land area is approximately 121% of the area of Maryland. Lesotho is thus one of the smallest countries in Africa by area and ranked 142nd worldwide. Most of the population (70%) resides within rural regions.\n\nLesotho lies at an average elevation of 2161 m above sea level and is therefore one of the highest countries in the world. The highest mountain peak (Thabana Ntlenyana) is at 3,482 meters. There is no access to the open sea. Lesotho is fully enclosed by South Africa. The distance between New York City and the Capital Maseru is about 13,000 km (8,078 mi)."
