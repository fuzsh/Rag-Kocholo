        "text": "The capital of the small kingdom of Lesotho in southern Africa is Maseru. It is the country’s only large city. Maseru lies on the left bank of the Caledon River near the border with South Africa’s Free State province. Maseru is a center of transportation, and farmers from the surrounding area sell their crops in the city. The National Assembly chamber buildings and the High Court buildings of Lesotho are located in Maseru, as are Radio Lesotho, a technical school, and the Lesotho Agricultural College, founded in 1955. The National University of Lesotho, established in 1975, is in nearby Roma.\n\nIn the 19th century the Sotho people took control of the area that is now Lesotho. The chief of the Sotho, named Moshoeshoe, founded Maseru in 1869. In 1871 Great Britain made the area into a colony, with Maseru as the colony’s capital. When Lesotho became an independent country in 1966, Maseru remained the capital. Since then the city has grown rapidly. Population (2016 census), 330,760."
