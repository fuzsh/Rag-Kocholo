        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe period of January-March marked a great period in the history of BVBI in Maseru and the church in Lesotho as the school had its first graduation. One of the students was ordained as an elder. Donnie Estep visited and 7 baptisms were recorded. These and more are reported hereunder.\n\n1.0 ORDINATION\n\nOn the 7th of January 2024, Likhama Leuta, one of the students was ordained in the office of Eldership. Likhama is a serving member of the Lesotho Defense Forces and holds the rank of Warrant Officer Class 1. During the ordination, the army delegation came to witness the occasion and they were pleased to see their serviceman ordained. The school and the church were praised by the army delegation for the good work of producing such great preachers like Likhama Leuta. Maseru church of Christ has 4 Elders now.\n\n2.0 GRADUATION\n\nThe graduation ceremony was a historic event in the churches of Christ in Lesotho, the first of BVBI in Maseru. This took place on the 10th of March 2024 at Maseru church of Christ premises. The main reason the graduation was held on a Sunday was to motivate church members to join the school and also to pass the message to other congregations that this is a serious school, not Bible study. This has attracted several people who promised to enroll in April. 9 men and a lady graduated with an Advanced Diploma in Biblical Studies. The names are as follows:\n\n1. Moalosi Solomon Monyane\n\n2. Likhama Peter Leuta\n\n3. Moshe Libe Ts’oene\n\n4. Neo Johannes Ramonyenyane\n\n5. Mekhoa Phiela\n\n6. Tsokolo Anthony Moliko\n\n7. Tankiso Raphaelo Rahlao\n\n8. Tankiso Edwin Mohono\n\n9. Motse Christe Kolobe\n\n10. Paballo Mateboho Ramokhele\n\nThe school would like to thank Brother Donnie Estep for donating the funds to buy the graduation gowns. The students looked great in those gowns. The gown remains the school property.\n\n2.1 VISITOR\n\nThe school was privileged to have a brother Donnie Estep as the guest speaker at the graduation ceremony. BVBI in Maseru appreciates the services he rendered and the sermon he preached at the Maseru church of Christ. Lesotho welcomes you all.\n\n3.0 CURRICULUM\n\nThree courses have been covered: In January Brother Robert taught the epistles of John, in February, Tawanda taught the New Life Behaviour, and in March Brother Tawanda also taught Old Testament 1. On average 15 students attended each of these three courses.\n\n4.0 EVANGELISM\n\nStudents are engaged in evangelism. The school is planning to establish two more congregations in Maputsoe about 80-100km from Maseru and Sebalabala village about 75km from Maseru. The students and the instructors have gone to these two places several times for evangelism and the response is overwhelming. In Maputsoe there are about 6 Christians who are not meeting for worship. The school is mobilizing these Christians and other prospects so that they can start meeting on Sundays. If the funds allow, BVBI in Maseru would want to send four students, two to each of these congregations to help conduct services and as a way to practice what they are learning. The school is eager to have more campaigns and plant more congregations provided funds are available.\n\nAs a result of the evangelism the school is doing locally, 7 souls were added to the church through baptism.\n\n5.0 BOREHOLE\n\nThe school requested a borehole and thank God, in March, Healing Hands International drilled a borehole at Maseru church of Christ premises where the school is operating. The school would like to thank Brother Keith for liaising with the HHI. The school and the church have access to clean and drinkable water.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe school is thankful to God and the sponsors for the great work of partnering with us to train preachers in Lesotho. Thank you all involved, the school's prayer is to engage in more evangelism and plant more congregations in Lesotho. Pray for Christians as Lesotho is currently experiencing drought.\n\n--\n\nGod bless you\n\nIn His arms,\n\nTawanda Mwadiya\n\nThe period from January to April has been a blessing. Two BVBI International directors visited the school. 4 baptisms were recorded. Four more students have joined. The students testify about how the school has changed their lives.\n\nIn January the school was blessed to host Brother Mark Reynolds. He had time to encourage and motivate the students. In March, Brother Keith Kasarjian visited the school and had a wonderful time with the students for two days. Both Mark and Keith had an opportunity to preach at Maseru church of Christ on a Sunday. According to Sesotho culture, every visitor is supposed to be given a Sesotho name. Mark was named Lerato (Love), after preaching a wonderful sermon on love. Keith was named Karabo (Answer) because it had been a long time since Lesotho prayed for a Bible School and God answered through Brother Keith. It was indeed a blessing to have them in Lesotho and the school hopes to host you again soon.\n\nFour more students have joined the school. Palamang Litsie from Sehlabeng church of Christ, that’s about 20km from Maseru. Litsie is one of the leaders at Sehlabeng church. BVBIL students have been instrumental in the inception of this congregation, thus every Sunday two students are sent there to lead the services. Makhotla Mafatle and Ramatsitsi Khothatso are from Hamamathe church of Christ which is about 55 km from Maseru. Again this congregation was started by the efforts of BVBIL students and instructors. Matiisetso Tlhabi is from Maseru church. The school plans to train these men from Sehlabeng and Hamamathe so that they can be preachers of their respective congregations.\n\nThe school is jubilant to report that four souls have been saved during this period. 64 prospects have been engaged by the students, and over 200 WBS introductory lessons have been distributed. Denominational Doctrines, Bible Geography, and Personal Evangelism 3 were taught during this period. The book of Revelation was taught in December 2022, but because students need to fully understand it, the instructor decided to increase the course time to the first two weeks of January. Thus, from January to April, only 3 courses were taught.\n\nThe school instructor, Robert, was involved in a car accident, even though the car was badly damaged, thanks to God, Robert came out alive with just minor scratches.\n\nThis is what the students have to say concerning the impact BVBIL has on their lives:\n\nMoses Tsoene, “The BVBI has made me realize that I have to work more upon my spirit for this has shown how much I really don’t know my Christian belief and therefore I must work even harder to become more understanding of God and His intentions upon myself. It’s an inspiration to serve Him the way and effectively tell others about this amazing God.”\n\nLikhama Leuta, “BVBIL lessons have taken me to another level in terms of spiritual growth. I am now more rooted in Christ than before. But what amazes me more is the feeling and desire to learn more that the school has arisen inside me. That is something I did not have before. Like at work, I have improved so much that positive things are happening for me. I thank God for this opportunity. I went to this school for God’s work but I get the bonus of positivity in my personal life.”\n\nMotse Kolobe, “Khotsong bana’beso.ruri ha ke tsebe moo ke lokelang ho qala teng ha ke bua ka seo sekolo see see entseng bophelong baka, leseli Leo ke le fumanang sekolong Mona le mpha t’sepo ea hore thuto ea nnete ekeke ea timela..ruri ke motlotlo ka Bear valley Institute.” Translation “Peace be with you, brethren. I really don't know where to start when I talk about what this school has done in my life, the information I get from school here gives me hope that true education will not perish…really I am proud of Bear Valley Institute.”\n\nMapule Kaeane, “The school has transformed my life a lot! It helped me to know the depth of reading the Bible and praying to God with a clear mind. Bear Valley helped me to discern the truth from lies or heresy. Whether I listen to or read religious articles, I can differentiate a true Christian or just a joker pushing his or her interest. I thank God and our teachers who work hard to see that we students are filled with truth and will never blame anyone but ourselves for not doing what is expected of us as Christians.\n\nThato Leuta, “The school has greatly impacted me in a positive and somehow negative way. POSITIVELY: I now appreciate a healthy Christian Life more. I appreciate what Jesus The Christ did for me on the cross. I have learned that there is more to scripture than just a written message. I now understand my obligation as a Christian (Great Commission). I now understand that God’s commands are not optional; love one another, forgive others, do good to others, etc. I now understand that the Bible has a lot in it. That it covers every aspect of our daily lives. I wish I could learn the Word of God till the end of time. NEGATIVELY: I have become too judgmental. It saddens me a lot when; the “brothers” misinterpret the scriptures because they are hesitant to come to school. Church ladies see school as something for the brothers only. When Christians seem to be spiritually malnourished and when we have all the necessary nutrients at our disposal. The school is the best.”\n\nMakhotla Mafatle, “Bear Valley Bible Institute has helped me to discern the Truth and the Error, it has fueled my devotion to God and passion for Sharing the Gospel to others, (the great commission). It has helped me to use the knowledge to Glorify God and help the lost. I developed passion, interest, and hunger to study and read the Bible and appreciate the holy Scriptures. It has helped me to defend my faith and spiritual growth. It has helped how to minister in a congregation. It has helped to put in practice the examples of Conversations in the book of Acts.”\n\nThank you for the financial and spiritual support.\n\n--\n\nGod bless you\n\nIn His arms,\n\nTawanda Mwadiya\n\nSEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2019 REPORT\n\nGrace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. I would like to thank God and everyone who is behind the success of BVBIL, your support both spiritually and materially is well appreciated. BVBI-Lesotho had a visiting instructor, the school also held its first outreach. One soul has been won to Jesus. Students are doing well in their studies and personal work, teachers are impressed with their performance in and outside class. One of our students lost a mother and the other one lost a grandmother.\n\nOn the 31st of August 2019, brother Donnie Estep visited the school, he taught the Scheme of Redemption on the 31st and the 1st of September, Brother Tawanda took over the class for the remaining weeks. Brother Donnie also preached on the 1st September at Sehlabeng church of Christ, one of the newly established congregations which is well looked after by our students. BVBIL and the church appreciate his visit and the work he did in Lesotho.\n\nOn the 28th of September the school had its first outreach at Sekamaneng village in Maseru. The students under the supervision of brother Tawanda Mwadiya had door to door evangelism for 6 hours. 35 lessons were taught, 46 people were engaged and one obeyed the gospel through baptism. Students are making the follow ups to the potential prospects on their own time. The school is planning to have another outreach in Sehlabeng village before the year ends.\n\nOne of our students (brother Moliko Moliko) lost a mother, she was 84 years old and Khauhelo also lost a grandmother in October. The students led the prayer services starting from Wednesday up to Saturday on both funerals and 8 sermons were preached during these two funerals. From September to October BVBIL students taught 28 Bible classes on Sundays, 10 Sunday School lessons, 25 lessons on giving and Lord’s supper and 30 sermons were preached in 5 congregations.\n\nThe teachers are impressed with the performance of the students in and outside class. Most of the students are matured, hence, they are committed with school work, so as in spreading the gospel in Lesotho. Among the students is an elder at Maseru church of Christ who has been greatly impacted by the school, he has become an instrument in spreading the good news.\n\nThis is what other students have to say about the school:\n\n“The school helped me to understand that God is real and everything am facing, like any kind sin surrounding me am going to defeat it because I am given power by Lord Jesus. It also helped me understand that my duty is to obey God’s instructions and His duty is to keep His promise”- Ltlhare.\n\n“I thought I knew the Bible up until my first day in class, that is when I realized that I don’t know anything. Thank you Bear Valley Bible Institute Lesotho.”- Moliko\n\n“I can’t believe that we are now able to go to other congregations to preach and well received. Thank you brother for making it happening, thank you for bring the Bible school in Lesotho”-Ramphielo\n\n“Bear Valley Bible Institute will unite churches (Congregations) in Lesotho, one day the church is going to be big and strong as you always tell us that the church is big and strong in Zimbabwe. I am seeing it coming, thank you BVBIL”- Khauhelo\n\n“My brother in Christ, I am grateful for all your efforts in making sure that we now have Lesotho Bear Valley Bible Institute, after every class I thank God that I have the opportunity to learn His Word, the interaction with brothers from our sister congregations as scholars is very importantly narrowing the gap which for a long time existed between us, and it is promoting the fellowship amongst us, thank you brother, our chief Shepherd is aware of everything and will reward you at the right time.”-Likhama Leuta.\n\nThe church in Lesotho has not been united for about two decades, to the point where by congregation A cannot fellowship with congregation B and one from congregation C cannot be invited to preach at congregation D, not because of doctrinal issues but matters of opinions. Thank God, BVBIL has imparted unity among the students, hence, the congregations are starting fellowshipping with one another.\n\nAnother method of evangelism that would be effective for our students and our community, more especially those who are busy, is the distribution of WBS booklets. Some prospects are busy to the point that they cannot give our students a chance to sit and discuss the Word of God and some prefer to study alone. Despite the fact that someone is busy that should not deprive that person to hear the gospel, hence, WBS would be of great benefit in this regard. The World Bible School courses would also be issued to High schools, colleges and prisons. BVBIL students will be making the follow ups and as a result, one on one Bible study can be initiated. In addition, this will also broaden the base for prospects.\n\nIf the school can have access of the WBS materials that would accelerating the spread of the gospel in Lesotho. The current challenge is that there is no WBS office in Lesotho and the school does not know where to get the materials, therefore, if there is a church or individual or an organization that can provide us with WBS materials, BVBIL will greatly appreciate that.\n\nIn conclusion, BVBIL is impacting the students, teachers, congregations and the community at large. On behalf of BVBIL, I am grateful to participate in what God is already doing in Lesotho. The school is kindly requesting for WBS materials. Once again, I would like to thank everyone who is behind the success of the school.\n\nIn His arms,\n\nTawanda Mwadiya\n\n2019 (August-September) Southern Africa Report\n\nThe work in southern Africa is going very well. I was greatly encouraged as I was able to visit five of our Bear Valley schools, including one of our newest schools which began in May of this year in Maseru, Lesotho! The other schools in addition to Lesotho were Gweru, and Harare in Zimbabwe, Luanshya, Zambia and Ekwendeni, Malawi. Although it was a busy, full schedule it was also very productive. I am so thankful and appreciative to all who have contributed to our efforts in training local preachers to teach the Gospel as we seek to fulfill our Lord’s commission to make disciples in all the world (Matthew 28:19-20).\n\nThe first school I visited was in Maseru, Lesotho. This school is one of our newest extended programs, meeting every weekend on Saturday and Sunday. This allows the student to work full time while attending the Bible school on the weekends. Although it will take twice as long to complete the course work it allows the student to continue to support his family as he pursues a Bible education. I have found these students are often more mature in age and in their faith. In addition, many are already leaders within the local congregations having a desire to grow and mature in their knowledge of God’s word and in their service for the church. I was very pleased to discover one of the elders in the Maseru congregation attending my class. What a great example for others to see the need to grow in their knowledge of God’s Word.\n\nTawanda Mwadiya is our director at BVBI-Lesotho and is doing a great job in teaching and directing the school. Tawanda, additionally, works with and preaches for the Maseru church of Christ along with Vincent M. Shata. Vincent teaches for the school, but he is also the preacher and one of the elders of the congregation in Maseru. This congregation has graciously allowed us to use their building to operate the school. I taught the Scheme of Redemption to 17 students on August 30th and September 1st. In addition, I had the privilege that Sunday to preach in a young congregation, that the students and preachers have established, just outside the city limits of Maseru. The congregation is called the Sehlabeng church of Christ. I was very impressed with the unity of all these brethren and work being done by the school, staff, students and churches in Lesotho. I am excited about the work and growth in Lesotho!\n\nFinishing there, I traveled to Gweru Zimbabwe, via Johannesburg, South Africa to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, then driving the 2 hours to the school in Gweru. Although the students were not in school that first week in September, as they were all out in the local congregations getting much needed practical work, nevertheless it was a productive visit. Matthew Muchingami, our director, met me at the airport, and we were able to visit some of the students that were working near Bulawayo. This is part of their work and training as preachers. This work is reviewed and assessed as a prerequisite in order to graduate from the program. The local churches provide housing for the students and feed them as they evangelize and conduct Bible studies day to day. It is a win/win for the school and the local churches as the students get much needed practical work and the local churches are encouraged and helped as their membership increases in number and in faith!\n\nI was able to visit with Matthew and discuss with him the work in general, in addition, we visited the property that was given to the school by the government where there is much work and planning being done. Two wells (bore holes) have been drilled complete with solar powered pumps. Much of the land has been/is being cleared. A small guard house has been constructed along with a larger building that may serve as a classroom and library in the near future. The foundation for the school is now completed that will house the students as well as classrooms. This has all been accomplished with a minimal amount of funding.\n\nSome of the benefits of moving to this property will be additional space that will allow us to increase the student enrollment to 20 students or possibly even more in the future. The 600 dollars monthly rent that is currently being paid can go toward finishing the construction of the property. Once that is completed there will be a savings of 7200 dollars a year. Having such a large piece of land (8 Hectors) allows the school to grow much of their own food as well as raise livestock. The students can learn farming and agricultural techniques in addition to getting a good Bible education. I was excited to see all that is being done and the hard work that has been invested by the staff, students, board and local congregations as they partner together!\n\nThe financial situation in Zimbabwe continues to be a major challenge and, if anything, seems to have worsened since the removal and now death of its leader, Robert Mugabe. It is nearly impossible to get more than 20-50 dollars a day from the bank. The lines are much too long, often taking hours to withdraw even a small amount of currency. Because of this, I carried with me three months support sent to me by Woodland Oaks the overseeing congregation. Despite the difficulties these Christians are facing, they are working hard and continue to plan and develop strategies for the future. The church continues to grow in number and in faith as they go forth evangelizing!\n\nOn Thursday September 5th Matthew and I drove the 4 hours to Harare to visit our sister school and meet with, our director, Howard Suwari and his family. I wanted to see how things are progressing with the school and the students, and as I suspected, they continue to do extremely well. As I mentioned earlier, the students in the extended programs, overall, seem to be more mature in their faith and generally make up the leadership in the local churches. It is always impressive to me to see these men and woman continue to want to grow and develop in their faith and love for God. The school is doing well consisting of about 27 students overall, 20 men and 7 ladies. And, of course Howard and his lovely family continue to work hard serving the local church and directing the school. I always enjoy visiting this family, their love for the Lord is evident. I am so grateful for their hospitality that is shown to me. Even though my stay was brief, I so much enjoyed being with this godly family.\n\nFollowing my visit to Zimbabwe my next stop was to Zambia to teach during the second week of September. Luanshya, Zambia is in the northern part of the country near the border of the Congo. I taught 2 Corinthians this time, already having taught 1 Corinthians early this year (February). The students all did very well, and they seem to be growing and maturing in their faith and in their teaching and preaching. I always enjoy attending chapel services in the morning and hearing the students present lessons and lead the worship in song. They are doing an outstanding job as they continue to grow! Fred and Cephas along with Kennedy have done a good job teaching and developing these young men and leading them on evangelistic campaigns throughout the year. I was very pleased to see them growing and moving forward. I had time to talk with Fred and Cephas about the work and their future plans and it seems they are making extra efforts to be more evangelistic in the community, in the local churches, and throughout the copper belt region. It was a pleasure being there during the second week of September.\n\nOn Saturday September 14th I flew from Ndola, Zambia to Lilongwe, Malawi where Ephron Mbano, our director, was there to meet me. We drove the 4 ½ hours north to Ekwendeni where the school is located, and I stayed with Mbano and his family. I am so thankful for him, and his wife Beauty, and their 2 children, they always take such good care of me. I taught the Prison Epistles that week and the students all did outstanding. They were even more enthusiastic than usual seeing they were graduating that Saturday. I have so much enjoyed and appreciated these 13 students. They have done well having transitioned from the school in Mzuzu and moving 30 minutes north to Ekwendeni. We started with 15 students but 2 of them dropped out along the way. However, these men I am confident will go forth preaching Gods Word as they extend and defend the faith. Mbano and Clergynton have well prepared these men to be faithful Gospel preachers!\n\nOn September 21st the students received their Advanced Diplomas in Biblical Studies from BVBI-Ekwendeni, Malawi. The ceremony went very smoothly, and we had guests from 2 other schools of preaching and representatives from 4 or 5 of the local congregations as well as former students who made up the first graduating class. The students and all who were in attendance was very pleased with the ceremony as we enjoyed a delicious meal afterwards.\n\nDuring my time in Malawi I also had the opportunity to preach in Mbano’s home village. I loved meeting these good folks and the local preacher is doing an outstanding job. He is a former graduate of Mzuzu Bible College. The churches in Malawi, although impoverished, are strong and growing spiritually. The potential is tremendous!\n\nWhen I think of the work in Africa, overall, I am reminded of our Lord’s words when he said, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore, pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” (Luke 10:2). I am truly thankful to all those who support me both financially and, in your prayers, as we work together to fulfill God’s purpose in saving souls. Thanks to Woodland Oaks church of Christ, Williamson Area church of Christ, Main Street church of Christ (Pikeville KY), Otsego church of Christ and Ben Creek church of Christ as well as individual Christians.\n\nI left Johannesburg, South Africa on September 24th and returned home on the25th. I could not have asked for a better or more pleasant trip. Everything went smoothly and the weather was ideal during my time there. I am also grateful to be working with Bear Valley Bible Institute in Denver Colorado, we now have 40 extension schools throughout the world as we train men to preach the Gospel.
