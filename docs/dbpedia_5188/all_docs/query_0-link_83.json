        "text": "By Matšeliso Phulane\n\nThe newly-completed Maseru District Hospital and Eye Clinic hospital which is funded with assistance from the People’s Republic of China government was officially opened yesterday by prime minister Sam Matekane.\n\nThe over M800 million facility took three years to complete and the construction was undertaken by Shanghai Construction Group. It is an initiative by former prime ministers Thomas Thabane and Pakalitha Mosisili who worked tirelessly for the success of the project.\n\nAmong others, the hospital is equipped 10 functional buildings, modernised supporting facilities and medical equipment, office furniture and kitchenware as well as the renovation of the dormitory of the Chinese Medical Team.\n\nMatekane said the hospital will provide services such as dialysis, ICU, CT-scan and histopathology laboratory services, dermatology, eye testing, and many others.\n\n“I ‘m convinced that this facility is equipped to provide quality outpatient and inpatient health services to Basotho thereby significantly reducing the need to receive medical treatment outside the country.\n\n“The hospital will also have training facilities and dormitories for trainee doctors and nurses. We are very thankful to the people and the government of the People’s Republic of China. The nature of this collaboration will certainly go a long way in strengthening our friendship. Let this also be a sign of unity as we celebrate 200 years as a nation,” he said.\n\nAt the same occasion, the acting Chinese ambassador to Lesotho, LYU Liangzhong said he was truly happy to attend the official opening of the ceremony.\n\nHe said the China-aided project is a gift to the government and the people of Lesotho.\n\n“I believe this brand-new state-of-art hospital will help improve the medical services of Lesotho and significantly increase Basotho’s well-being and health,” he noted.\n\nLiangzhong revealed that medical and health care forms an important part of China-Lesotho practical operations, and through their joint efforts, they have achieved tangible result in this field.\n\nChina has been sending medical teams to Lesotho since 1997.\n\nSo far, 18 Chinese medical Teams and over 180 doctors from China’s Hubei province have come and provided free medical and health care services to Basotho.\n\n“I am happy to know that the 18th Chinese medical team which has been working at Motebang government hospital is going to transfer to Maseru District Hospital and play a bigger role.\n\n“On our joint battle against the Covid-19 pandemic, China and Lesotho have stood side by side and shoulder to shoulder from the very beginning,” Liangzhong indicated.\n\nIn 2020, a Chinese medical expert group came to share their skills and experience with their Lesotho counterparts.\n\nFurther, China donated seven batches of PPEs as well as vaccines to during pandemic.\n\nLiangzhong assured that in future China will support Lesotho’s health policies and help in strengthening the prevention and control system of communicable diseases.\n\nIt will also help improve medical research, develop traditional medicine, and improve medicine accessibility and affordability.\n\n“This year marks the 30th anniversary of the resumption of the diplomatic relations between China and Lesotho. It’s also the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\n\n“In light of the increasing political mutual trust, economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two countries, let’s take it as a new starting point, join hands together to break new ground and promote relations to new light,” Liangzhong added."
