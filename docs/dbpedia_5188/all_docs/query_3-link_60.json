        "text": "Rural Health Initiative\n\nIn 2006, Lesotho’s Ministry of Health and PIH launched a comprehensive, integrated primary health care program to bring HIV care to more than 90,000 people served by seven mountain clinics, in the most remote areas of the country. The program, known as the Rural Health Initiative, has since enrolled thousands of people in long-term HIV treatment, while also improving access and utilization of quality primary health care in all seven regions.\n\nTuberculosis Care\n\nIn response to Lesotho's high prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)—a deadly form of the disease—PIH in 2007 launched the country's first treatment, care, and support program for MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), an even more severe strain of the deadly disease. The national TB program is based at PIH-supported Botšabelo Hospital in Maseru, Lesotho’s capital.\n\nBotšabelo primarily serves critical patients who need intensive monitoring and care. The hospital has an outpatient clinic and a nearby temporary housing facility that provides a safe place to stay for people receiving extended care at the hospital.\n\nThe TB program also is community-based, with significant outreach across the country, targeted education efforts in schools and vulnerable business sectors, and outpatient or in-home care for stable TB patients.\n\nNational Health Reform\n\nThe multi-year success of the HIV and TB programs helped build a foundation for a comprehensive reform of Lesotho's health system. That reform began in 2014, with PIH as the government’s primary technical advisor. It supports more than 70 health centers across four of Lesotho’s 10 districts and reaches about 40 percent of the country’s population.\n\nWork is underway to scale the reform nationally. Three main goals include:\n\nimproving primary health care delivery,\n\nstrengthening Lesotho’s health system, and\n\nimplementing a professional community health worker program."
