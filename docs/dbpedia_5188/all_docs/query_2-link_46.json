        "text": "Table 1 provides key indicators on children's work and education in Lesotho. Data on some of these indicators are not available from the sources used in this report.\n\nTable 1. Statistics on Children's Work and EducationChildrenAgePercentWorking (% and population)5 to 1430.1 (Unavailable)Attending School (%)5 to 1493.8Combining Work and School (%)7 to 1432.1Primary Completion Rate (%)90.7\n\nSource for primary completion rate: Data from 2019, published by UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2023. (1)\n\nSource for all other data: International Labor Organization’s analysis of statistics from Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 6 (MICS 6), 2018. (2)\n\nBased on a review of available information, Table 2 provides an overview of children's work by sector and activity.\n\nTable 2. Overview of Children's Work by Sector and ActivitySector/IndustryActivityAgricultureHerding animals, including cattle† (3-8)Farming, including planting, applying pesticides, and harvesting (5-7,9,10)ServicesDomestic work (3-7)Street work, including vending and trading (5,7,9)Categorical Worst Forms of Child Labor‡Commercial sexual exploitation, domestic work, and animal herding, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking (3,4)Use in illicit activities, including burglary and theft (7,9)\n\n† Determined by national law or regulation as hazardous and, as such, relevant to Article 3(d) of ILO C. 182.\n\n‡ Child labor understood as the worst forms of child labor per se under Article 3(a)–(c) of ILO C. 182.\n\nLesotho is a source, transit, and destination country for human trafficking. Children involved in animal herding are exposed to harsh weather conditions, sometimes leading to death. (3,4,11-13) Children, especially orphans, also sometimes voluntarily travel to other countries, including South Africa, for domestic work, and upon arrival they are subsequently detained in prison-like conditions and sexually exploited. (3,4,12) In addition, due to the high rate of HIV among adults, many children in Lesotho become orphans and are vulnerable to human trafficking. (3,4)\n\nIn Lesotho, primary education is free; however, secondary education incurs a fee that is cost prohibitive for many families. (3,5,14,15) Many children face limited access to education due to a shortage of teachers and schools, which causes them to travel long distances. In addition, the absence of sanitation facilities in schools remains a barrier for many children to access education, especially girls who are unable to access sanitary pads. (5-7) Children with disabilities also encounter difficulties with ill-equipped educational facilities and untrained teachers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many children dropped out of school to support their families. (7,13) These factors increase a child's vulnerability to the worst forms of child labor, such as human trafficking. (3,13) According to the Ministry of Social Development, children must produce copies of birth certificates to qualify for the Orphans and Vulnerable Children program that provides school fees and uniforms for orphans and vulnerable children. Research suggests that the low number of birth registrations results in children becoming stateless, making them more vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. (6,16)\n\nThe government has established institutional mechanisms for the enforcement of laws and regulations on child labor (Table 5). However, gaps exist within the operations of enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate enforcement of their child labor laws.\n\nTable 5. Agencies Responsible for Child Labor Law EnforcementOrganization/AgencyRole & ActivitiesMinistry of Labor and Employment (MOLE)Enforces minimum age requirements under child labor laws, including for hazardous occupations, and assesses compliance with child labor laws as part of general labor inspections. Assigns labor inspectors to operate a Child Labor Unit within the Ministry and provides recommendations that support the expansion of labor inspections. (22)National PoliceInvestigate criminal child labor violations and work in conjunction with MOLE to enforce child labor laws, including those related to hazardous and forced child labor. Manage all trafficking in persons-related cases within the Lesotho Mounted Police Service and refer cases for prosecutions to the Public Prosecutor's Office. (7,22,23)\n\nLabor Law Enforcement\n\nIn 2022, labor law enforcement agencies in Lesotho took actions to address child labor (Table 6). However, gaps exist within the operations of the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE) that may hinder adequate labor law enforcement, including insufficient resource allocation.\n\nTable 6. Labor Law Enforcement Efforts Related to Child LaborOverview of Labor Law Enforcement20212022Labor Inspectorate FundingN/A (6)$151,036 (7)Number of Labor Inspectors27 (24)29 (7)Mechanism to Assess Civil PenaltiesNo (17)No (17)Training for Labor Inspectors ProvidedNo (6)No (7)Number of Labor Inspections Conducted at Worksite940 (6)875 (7)Number of Child Labor Violations Found1 (6)2 (7)Number of Child Labor Violations for Which Penalties Were Imposed0 (6)0 (7)Number of Child Labor Penalties Imposed that Were Collected0 (6)0 (7)Routine Inspections ConductedYes (6)Yes (7)Routine Inspections TargetedYes (6)Yes (7)Unannounced Inspections PermittedYes (17)Yes (17)Unannounced Inspections ConductedYes (6)Yes (7)Complaint Mechanism ExistsYes (6)Yes (7)Reciprocal Referral Mechanism Exists Between Labor Authorities and Social ServicesYes (6)Yes (7)\n\nLesotho has a referral mechanism that is maintained through the collaboration of different ministries. When a case of child labor is found by MOLE, the Ministry’s inspectors refer the case to NGOs and the Ministry of Social Development. (5) NGOs usually provide immediate material assistance, such as food, cash, or shelter, and the Ministry of Social Development conducts site and family visits and assists eligible children to register for a child grant program. (5) MOLE also receives walk-in complaints daily as well as whistleblower complaints. In addition, the Ministry of Social Development has a child helpline that addresses general child protection issues. (6)\n\nReports indicate that funding is inadequate for the labor inspectorate to carry out inspections and a large share of the money was used to pay for salaries. In addition, labor inspections are not conducted in high-risk sectors, including the informal sector in which child labor is known to occur. (5-8,22)\n\nCriminal Law Enforcement\n\nIn 2022, criminal law enforcement agencies in Lesotho took actions to address child labor (Table 7). However, gaps exist within the operations of enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate criminal law enforcement, including limited funding.\n\nTable 7. Criminal Law Enforcement Efforts Related to Child LaborOverview of Criminal Law Enforcement20212022Training for Criminal Investigators ProvidedNo (6)No (7)Number of Investigations1 (6)2 (7)Number of Prosecutions Initiated0 (6)0 (7)Number of Convictions0 (6)0 (7)Imposed Penalties for Violations Related to the Worst Forms of Child LaborNo (6)No (7)Reciprocal Referral Mechanism Exists Between Criminal Authorities and Social ServicesYes (6)Yes (7)\n\nIn 2022, four girls were rescued by the National Police Forces from traffickers in South Africa and were referred to a local NGO in Lesotho. (7) Although research could not determine the budget for criminal law enforcement during this reporting period, there is evidence that funding and resources were insufficient. (7)\n\nThe government has established a key mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address child labor (Table 8). However, gaps exist that hinder the effective coordination of efforts to address child labor, including efficacy in accomplishing mandates.\n\nTable 8. Key Mechanism to Coordinate Government Efforts on Child LaborCoordinating BodyRole & ActivitiesProgram Advisory Committee on Child Labor/National Task TeamLed by MOLE's Child Labor Unit, includes representatives from government ministries, trade unions, NGOs, and international organizations. (5) During the reporting period, held two meetings to review the report on the National Action Plan on the Elimination of Child Labor and its Implementation Plan. (7)\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Multi-Sectoral Committee on Combating Trafficking in Persons organized 17 radio programs that informed listeners about the issue of human trafficking and provided trainings for 22 diplomats in South Africa. In addition, students at 39 schools throughout the country were educated on human trafficking issues. (7,25) The government also finalized a report with recommendations on how to improve the criminal justice system's response to human trafficking, and outlined the strengths and weaknesses of their response. (25)\n\nCross‐border enforcement mechanisms exist between Lesotho and the Republic of South Africa, and during the reporting period, both governments held two sensitization trainings on trafficking in persons for their respective staffs. (6,25,26) The enforcement entities are coordinated by different ministries—Home Affairs, Local Government, or Police and Public Safety. (6) There is, however, a lack of coordination between these bodies, which negatively impacts implementation as some efforts are duplicated, while unclear lines of responsibility mean that other efforts are not undertaken.
