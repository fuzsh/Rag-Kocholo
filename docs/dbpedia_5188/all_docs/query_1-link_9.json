        "text": "My name is ‘Mamokoena Malaka, I am a caregiver and a patient at Baylor College of Medicine Children’s Foundation – Lesotho. Services that I get at Baylor Foundation Lesotho are of high-quality standard. Clinical staff really care for caregivers and patients. They love and respect their clients. They help everyone and no one goes home without being seen or getting services they need. They also refer patients appropriately if necessary. The approach of staff towards caregivers and patients is so sweet, kind and lovely. Really Foundation staff are doing amazing job and that is why Baylor Foundation Lesotho is called Center of Excellence.\n\nI also work at the COE as a Treatment Literacy Liaison. My job is to ensure good understanding of medication by patients and caregivers. As an employee the Foundation gave me an opportunity to be part of Baylor Foundation Lesotho family. The Foundation offered me the chance to use my skills and knowledge to help caregivers and patients. At Baylor Foundation Lesotho we work as a team and share work hence there is no work fatigue or stress. It gave me an opportunity to improve my knowledge and skills by attending Psychosocial Support (PSS) workshops. It allowed me to grow up and be the person I am today. Thank you very much Baylor Foundation Lesotho for providing me so much.\n\nI am Matsitso Mohoanyane working at the Ministry of Health as a Pediatric HIV Coordinator. I wish to express my profound appreciation to Baylor Foundation Lesotho for the highest level of quality preventive, care and treatment services, patient monitoring, education and training for health professionals, and operational research to improve patient care for children and adolescents as well as their families in the country. Although at its inception Baylor Foundation Lesotho was primarily focused on providing pediatric HIV services, its scope has expanded over the years.\n\nTheir continued engagement and support to the Ministry of Health as it strives to improve the health and lives of the children and adolescent and their families in Lesotho is tremendous. Baylor Foundation Lesotho expanded its clinical and educational efforts to Lesotho at the time when the expertise to manage pediatrics in Lesotho was challenged and had bearing on the children survival and health outcomes., Today, I can confidently say Lesotho has reached the 90-90-90 milestones through the immense support of the Foundation. The Baylor Foundation Lesotho satellite clinics that are in the districts of Lesotho have further enabled the children in the remote areas to access health services from the expert and have contributed to the universal coverage. Furthermore, some of the Foundation staff members participate in Ministry of Health technical working groups that develop, review and amend National Health policies, priorities, and guidelines.\n\nIn order to optimize treatment for people living with HIV in Lesotho and continue to simplify treatment and improve clinical outcomes, Lesotho introduced Dolutegravir based antiretroviral therapy for adults and children whose weight is more than 20kg, and expanded access to lopinavir/ ritonavir pellets for children below 20kg. Baylor Foundation Lesotho clinicians were involved in drafting the National ART guidelines addendum to this effect developing the training materials as well as job aides for health personnel. The overall health system will never be the same with the presence of Baylor Foundation Lesotho."
