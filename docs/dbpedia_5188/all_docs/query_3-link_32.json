        "text": "edit\n\nIntroduction\n\nMaseru is the capital and largest city in Lesotho. It has approximately 250,000 inhabitants and is located in the northwest of the country on the Mohokare River, bordering South Africa, at an altitude of around 1,600 metres above sea level. The place has been the capital since Lesotho became independent in 1966 and the name of the city actually means 'place of the red sandstone'. Nowadays, it is the administrative centre of the country and has good facilities for travellers. It also functions as a transportation hub to and from South Africa and the rest of the country, although roads outside Maseru deteriorate the further you go inland.\n\nedit\n\nWeather\n\nClimate in Maseru is rather harsh and mainly because of its elevation quite different from many other surrounding countries. In summer it is mostly warm to hot with occasional showers. Temperatures are between 30 °C and 35 °C during summer days and around 15 °C at night. Winters are relatively dry with temperatures around 10 °C to 15 °C during the day and below 0 °C at night from June to August. Sometimes, some snow is possible but not often.\n\nedit\n\nGetting Around\n\nThe bus stop on Moeshoeshoe Rd is the main taxi station,but private cabs are available from the price of M50\n\nPublic cabs travelling around the city cost M6.50 and they are available in stations around town.\n\nFor information on catching taxis in Lesotho and Maseru, call Comfort Taxis and speak to Khosana on +266 6274 5199.\n\nFor information on catching taxis in Lesotho, Moonlight taxis are on +266 22312695\n\nedit\n\nSleep\n\nUpscale\n\nedit\n\nKeep Connected\n\nInternet\n\nIn Maseru, there are several internet cafes, although fairly cheap (usually LSL0.20-0.50 per min) they are pretty slow at best.\n\nPhone\n\nSee also International Telephone Calls\n\nLesotho's international telephone code is 266.\n\nThe cellphone network is OK in the towns, but pretty poor out in the countryside. There are two mobile operators in Lesotho, Vodacom and Econet Ezicel. Vodacom has the widest coverage outside the towns. You can buy a Vodacom or Ezicel Buddie pay as you go sim card for under LSL50 in Maseru - worthwhile if you are staying for a while. Cellphones are available for hire in Maseru. Lesotho uses GSM900.\n\nIf you have a South African Vodacom Sim Card, you can use it in Lesotho only on the Vodacom network. Be sure to enable roaming."
