        "text": "Gender-based violence (GBV) is a pervasive and pernicious social problem that hampers the socio-economic development of nations\n\nglobally. In Lesotho, the pervasiveness of GBV is associated with patriarchy, and unequal social and economic power between males and females. The overall aim of this study was to establish the major forms of GBV in Lesotho. The study objectives were to: ascertain the social relationships of GBV perpetrators and survivors; establish the dominant forms of GBV perpetrated by men against women, in Maseru rural areas and find out the main forms of GBV perpetrated by men against women, in Maseru urban areas. Primary data were gleaned from a sample of 20 participants, using in-depth interviews. Hagan, Gillis and Simpson's (1985) power-control theory foregrounded the theoretical framework for this study. The study unearthed that the dominant forms of GBV in Maseru rural areas are rape, inclusive of marital rape, incest and concurrent sexual relationships. In Maseru urban areas, the dominant forms of GBV are rape, inclusive of marital rape, concurrent sexual relationships, death threats and femicide. I argue that forms of GBV in most societies are linked to relationships between perpetrators and victims, poverty as well as inherent and structural gender inequalities between males and females. The study recommends stiffer sentences as a deterrent measure for perpetrators and to curb recidivism; crafting and implementation of GBV mitigation strategies that target economic empowerment and harmful socially constructed norms."
