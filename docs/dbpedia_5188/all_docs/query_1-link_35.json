        "text": "Lesotho is a very small country, in both geographical area ( 30,355 km2 ) and in population. Land locked within the bounds of south africa and the only independent state that lies above 1000 metres above sea level. It is known for its abundance of white gold and some of the finest diamonds in the region of southern africa.\n\nFamous also for its beautiful mountains, the likes of Thabana Li ‘mele, Thaba Putsoa, Thabana Ntlenyana, Qiloane and many others, hence the name the Mountain Kingdom. Divided into 10 districts, this is the home of the Basotho people, a place where I hail from, my motherland.\n\nI live in the capital town of Lesotho, Maseru. The heart of the whole country. The administration centre. The location where most resources and services are situated. The most populated district in the country, a place where many Basotho have found their livelihoods, due to a better infrastructure and the standard of living as a whole compared to other 9 districts. Area of 138 km 2 (53 sq mi) and elevation of (5,200 ft) above sea level. Welcome to Maseru “Ha bo lilamuni”.\n\nWith cheesy introductions laid down, I should probably just get to the point. The above photo and a few others to follow contain the core message of this writing. Even if I were to just post the photos here and refrain from uttering a single word, I don’t have the slightest doubt that my message would still be moved across; Maseru bus stop areas are filthy stinking. Honestly, speak of a health hazard, these areas are exactly that. Im speaking of places in town you never see in photographs, areas they never show on tv, let alone even loudly speak of, yet everyone in Maseru is in one way or the other affected by them. Someone needed to break the silence, and fortunately or unfortunately (depending on how you look at it) it just had to be me.\n\nOver flowing sewage drainage, pungent smell of public toilets, and urine spots all over: Maseru taxi ranks, places that Basotho men, women and children board into every single day. A working environment for some people; places where you will find among other things, food markets, fruits and vegetables shacks, clothing shacks, but an environment far from being conducive for life and well being of any human being.\n\nToday as I walked around taking these photos, I thought to myself, where is the Maseru City Council? Where are the people responsible for this town? Where are people who have been elected into office and are paid to take care of matters like these? Does it mean they are not aware of these conditions, or could they be turning a blind eye and are busy swinging on chairs in comfortable offices some where? Or in a lexus or land cruiser, or whatever thing they may be busy with besides doing their job. Surely anyone witnessing these circumstances would have one or two questions to himself, all of which seeking the answer to the “who is responsible and where are they? ” question.\n\nHao batho ba Molimo…These areas have been like this for as long as I can remember. Age around half the quarter of a century, I grew up seeing these circumstances my whole life, and instead of witnessing their end, situation keeps getting worse everyday. Basotho why are we letting ourselves live in such conditions? There are greater national issues we should be worrying about, like the booming HIV/AIDS stats, corrupt government officials, and the freeing of detained soldiers, not this.\n\nWho is to be blamed?\n\nIn the above photo, let’s all take a moment to witness the cause of our town’s problem. The reason why uptown is filthy and revolting. I pass through this area every day to and from work, and people who also have, will agree with me that the stench here is unbearable. I used to think the enemy of Lesotho is only those guys in high seats with suit and ties,or those in uniforms with devouring machine guns… but today I realised, even the ordinary Basotho are their own enemy. Do we need to be reminded that how we handle our environment is directly proportional to how our environment will handle us? Do we not know that good health begins with a healthy environment? Do we not realize that this could be the reason why Queen Mamohato Memorial Hospital otherwise known as Tshepong is flooding with patients day in and day out? Our level ignorance towards our environment is appalling. We are to be blamed for all this filth.\n\nThe blame is also on the head. People who should be passing strict environment regulations and ensuring their enforcement are not doing so. In Maseru one can freely litter or pass out where ever they want like the man in the above photo, without the fear of anyone or anything. That’s the problem, it shouldn’t be like that. Not when our fingers are dipped In ink every five years for people whom we trust will safeguard the town against issues like these, and not when LRA chows huge chunks of Basothos’ hard earned taxes, surely something needs to be done.\n\nIf I were to receive 5 minutes of conversation with the Minister of Health and social welfare, or the chief at Maseru city council, or who ever is in the position of great influence on issues affecting the welfare of our environment, I would in a few words say to him; my kind sir, our bus stop areas are not any different from ha ts’osane dumping area. They are a threat to the lives of Basotho passing and living in them everyday. Also my good sir, I advice that environment issues be regarded as national concerns and thus be dealt with immediately and completely. Here are a few possible actions that can be taken that I recommend:\n\n1. Drafting and passing of clear regulations that will control street vendors and effort be taken in their implementation. Where they are located, what they sell, and how they do so.\n\nPublic health inspectors should be seen to do their work in these areas. Their continuous visits to these areas and making Basotho accountable for them would change a lot of things. (My mind is on the vendors who cook and sell food in these areas, surely there’s work to be done there oh you kind inspectors. )\n\nStrict regulations be passed and enforced that will curb the issue of littering. Board signs haven’t been helping all these years, if penal stick method will be of great help so be it. Let examples be made of people who misuse this environment, so that many may understand the seriousness of protecting our environment.\n\nOffenders of these environment regulations should be dared to clean it. This will also deter other Basotho from doing things that will render them into the same position.\n\nEmploy more town cleaners and let their job be monitored closely.\n\nFor the love of God, my country and the Basotho people. #keepmaseruclean #it starts with you. Please share."
