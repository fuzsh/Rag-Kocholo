Parents need to know that Guardians of the Galaxy is a Marvel sci-fi action adventure about a group of outlaws led by Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) who band together to defend the universe against a murderous villain. Expect a lot of hand-to-hand combat and a few deaths (or near deaths) that are heartbreaking for other characters and viewers alike (one involves a child's loss of a parent). There's also grand-scale action violence with explosions and weapons. Peter has a reputation as a ladies' man and jokes about his past conquests; Peter and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) also have a lot of chemistry and almost kiss a couple of times. Language isn't frequent but includes "s--t," "bulls--t," "bitch," "ass," "bastard," and "d--k"; at one point, the Guardians also drink an unidentified liquid that makes them drunk. There's unfortunate, casual sexism throughout the film: Gamora is the token woman among the group, several dead women exist to provide backstories for male characters, the camera objectifies Gamora (e.g., lingering on her butt as she climbs up stairs), and she and her sister are pitted against each other. Still, given that it has a little less edge than Iron Man or The Avengers -- as well as themes of teamwork and friendship -- this adventure may be a good fit for a slightly younger crowd than some other superhero movies.
