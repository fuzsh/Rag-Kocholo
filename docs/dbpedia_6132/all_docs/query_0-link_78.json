        "text": "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, one of the most successful movie franchises of all time was born. The year 1977 saw the release of the very first \"Star Wars\" film, \"Episode IV - A New Hope,\" which generated over 775 million U.S. dollars at the global box office and introduced moviegoers to some of the genre's most recognizable characters. Created by George Lucas, the science-fiction saga quickly became one of the highest-grossing film franchises worldwide and continues to capture the attention and affection of audiences to this day. As of 2022, the series spans nine star-studded films and a variety of prequels, sequels, spin-off films, and TV shows. On top of that, the \"Star Wars\" multimedia empire also features video games, comic books, toys, and theme park attractions, highlighting its astronomical pop cultural impact and long-lasting legacy.\n\nThe rise of the blockbuster\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" universe is not only one of the most popular film franchises in cinematic history but also one of its most profitable. While not every title from the multiverse fared equally well, even \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" (2018), the least successful film date, still scored more than 390 million U.S. dollars in box office takings. With that said, it also boasted some of the highest production costs. As of 2022, \"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\" (2015) remains the highest-grossing \"Star Wars\" movie of all time while also ranking among the five most successful movies worldwide. It was the franchise's first installment to be directed by J. J. Abrams and gross more than two billion U.S. dollars at the global box office. Its follow-up \"Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi\" (2017) drew the series' second-highest revenue.\n\nThe age of Disney+\n\nThe Walt Disney Company purchased the \"Star Wars\" franchise as part of the conglomerate's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012. Before becoming a subsidiary, Lucasfilm had already cooperated with the House of Mouse to create \"Star Wars\"-themed attractions for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. Today, the partnership primarily plays out in the digital sphere as fans of the franchise can watch the first three trilogies alongside their spin-offs exclusively on Disney+ or under the Disney umbrella in theatres. Not only that, but even after the main storyline of the Skywalker Saga has been wrapped up, audiences still have plenty of new content to look forward to. Disney is constantly expanding the brand, and in the last few years, original productions like \"The Mandalorian\" or \"The Book of Boba Fett\" have become some of the streamer's most sought-after titles. This hype reached new heights in 2022 as Ewan McGregor reclaimed his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the highly anticipated series of the same name celebrated the most successful launch in Disney+’s history."
