        "text": "WE LOVE MOVIES. Not exactly a bold statement to make on the entertainment section of a website, but something we want to reiterate once again: we love movies. A movie can be a lot of things, sometimes at separate times and sometimes simultaneously: an escape, an expression of a feeling, a thrill, a spectacle, masterful storytelling, and far more. Movies bring things to life visually in a way that, frankly, sometimes feels like it should be impossible. What Christopher Nolan did this year with Oppenheimer, for example, probably far exceeds with J. Robert Oppenheimer himself ever would've imagined to be possible on the silver screen.\n\n2023, looking back, turned out to be one of the best years for film in years, providing incredible feats of cinema on all different levels. Sure, \"Barbenheimer\"—the simultaneous release of Nolan's film and Greta Gerwig's Barbie—was the cultural event of the year, but movies big and small stood out from the very start to the very end of the year. Stories intimate and cozy and stories grand and massive dominated multiplexes and independent theaters alike.\n\nTom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese, Emma Stone, and Keanu Reeves are just a handful of the big-screen titans who made a major impact in 2023, putting out movies that you'll want to see, talk about, and maybe even rewatch again and again.\n\nBelow, we've compiled a list of the best movies of the year—ones that can and should fit whatever mood you so happen to be in.\n\nAre you ready to be disturbed? Are you ready to be shaken to your core? Are you ready to leave a movie theater thinking \"what the hell did I just watch?\" Ari Aster (Hereditary, Midsommar) is without question one of the most brilliant writers/directors in modern horror, and his new A24 behemoth of a film Beau is Afraid—coming in at 3 hours and 15 minutes—is poised to be one of the most polarizing movies of the year. And while it absolutely will not be for everyone, it was, in fact, for me.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix stars as the titular Beau, in a movie that tells its audience immediately that they're watching a heightened world where everything for its sad-sack protagonist is at its horrifying and anxiety-inducing most. You'll spend much of Beau is Afraid wondering how much of the movie you're watching is really happening, and how much is a hallucination, eventually seeing things devolve into what's almost a David Lynch-esque abstraction of real life and pure nightmares.\n\nLess a horror than a surreal existential dread bonanza, Beau is Afraid is also quite funny throughout. It's hard for a 3 hour and 15 minute movie to not be boring, but this movie somehow makes that time fly. By the end, you may love it, and you may very well hate it—but either way, it's a ride worth taking.\n\nStream It Here"
