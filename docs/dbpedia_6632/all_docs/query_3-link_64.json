        "text": "The Television Academy has received a significant gift for its New Destination Campaign and its reimagined NoHo Arts District campus from noted philanthropists Cheryl and Haim Saban and The Saban Family Foundation. In recognition of this gift, the new building for the expanded campus will be named the Saban Media Center.\n\n\"We are deeply appreciative of this extremely generous gift from the Saban Family Foundation,\" said Television Academy Chairman and CEO Bruce Rosenblum. \"Cheryl and Haim are clearly dedicated to educational and cultural philanthropy which is the focus of our new Saban Media Center. It's a place to house and support our Academy Foundation, celebrate creative excellence, and host industry game-changers and leaders in related fields for the exchange of ideas and the introduction of new technologies, concepts and business models.\"\n\nHaim Saban, founder of Saban Entertainment and Fox Family Worldwide, and currently the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Saban Capital Group and Chairman of the Board of Univision Communications Inc., said, \"Television is constantly evolving and Cheryl and I are honored to play a meaningful role in that evolution in partnership with the Academy. We share the Academy's passion for encouraging and providing thought leadership through education, collaboration, and the spirit of community. We're also excited to help the Academy's Foundation thrive and expand its work and educational outreach.\"\n\nThe 30,000 square foot LEED-certified Saban Media Center will be a state-of-the-art home for the Television Academy and its Foundation, enhancing the organization's ability to support and educate its 20,000 above and below-the-line members and creating a nurturing environment to educate the next generation of television leaders through internships, scholarships, professional training and recognition programs like the College Television Awards. The Saban Media Center will also include a technology center and pocket studio where interns placed by the Academy's philanthropic Foundation and other young professionals can hone their skills.\n\nThe Academy is currently more than halfway towards its $40 million fundraising goal for the redesign of its campus, which also includes a $10 million endowment for its Foundation.\n\nThe Television Academy is the only organization that represents all aspects of the creative process of developing and producing television content: its 29 professional peer groups include writers, directors, costume designers, performers, sound editors, special visual effects and cinematographers among others.\n\nThe Saban Family Foundation was established in 1999 by Haim and Cheryl Saban to support medical, children's and education programs in the United States, and to address unmet societal needs in Israel. To date, Haim and Cheryl have given over $225 million to a number of causes.\n\nAbout The Television Academy\n\nThe Television Academy seeks to constantly expand the horizons of television excellence. It strives to empower the storytellers who shape the constantly evolving television space through the programs publications and events of the Academy and its Foundation. And it celebrates those who have led excellence by recording their stories and recognizing their achievements through accolades and awards, including television's most coveted prize, the Primetime Emmy Award. For more information please visit TelevisionAcademy.com.\n\nAbout The Saban Family Foundation\n\nBased on the belief that in order to reach their full potential, young people need healthy starts, caring adults, safe spaces, education for marketable skills, and opportunities to contribute to their communities, The Saban Foundation provides grants for a select number of organizations engaged in providing high-quality healthcare, social services, and K-12, education. Foundation grants are given for program initiatives as well as policy and advocacy efforts on behalf of children whose needs in these areas are not being met. The Foundation has a particular interest in mentoring programs and efforts to serve children in foster care.\n\nIn Israel, the Foundation partners with local organizations to develop creative solutions to critical needs. The Foundation bestows grants in two primary areas: promoting the well being of those serving in the military and addressing the problems of domestic violence and child abuse. In addition, the Foundation supports U.S. organizations committed to strengthening the relationship between the U.S. and Israel.\n\nSince its inception, the Foundation has made numerous contributions to a variety of worthy initiatives and organizations, including: the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Saban Free Clinic in Los Angeles, The Saban Pediatric Medical Center at Soroka Hospital, The Saban Birth & Maternity Center at Soroka Hospital, the John Wayne Cancer Institute, American Israel Education Foundation, William Jefferson Clinton Foundation, and the United Friends of the Children, amongst many others.\n\nThe Saban Family Foundation is based in Los Angeles and led by Executive Director Dr. Cheryl Saban.\n\n# # #\n\nContact:\n\nJim Yeager\n\nbreakwhitelight (for The Television Academy)\n\njim@breakwhitelight.com\n\nOffice: 424-644-0225\n\nCell: 818-264-6812"
