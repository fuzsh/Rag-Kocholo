        "text": "Saban, a long-time supporter and donor of many pro-Jewish and Israel causes, has stated his main goal in multiple interviews: \"I'm a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel.\"[28][6]\n\nSaban became involved in politics in the mid-1990s when he felt that support for Israel was slipping in the United States.[8] He says his views have shifted over the years:[1]\n\nI used to be a real leftist. I remember Arik Sharon [the leader of Israel's right-wing Likud Party] coming here, to my house, a few months before Camp David, when he was still leader of the opposition. He told me there would be no deal because [Yassir] Arafat would not sign. I told myself that there was nothing to be done—these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right…When there is a terrorist attack, I am [Avigdor] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality. Look, I don't see a solution today.[1]\n\nSaban has been a consistent donor to the United States Democratic Party according to his mandatory Federal Election Commission filings. Mother Jones, in an analysis of the major donors to the campaigns of 1998 election cycle, ranked Saban 155th among individual donors.[29] Amy Paris noted that Saban's Clinton-era \"generosity did not go unrewarded. During the Clinton administration, the entertainment executive served on the President's Export Council, advising the White House on trade issues.\"[29] The New York Times reported that Haim and his wife \"slept in the White House several times during President Clinton's two terms.\" Saban remains close friends with the former president. Clinton described Saban as a \"very good friend and supporter.\"[8] Saban contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the William J. Clinton Foundation.[30]\n\nDuring the 2000 presidential election, Saban increased his rank to 5th among individual donors with a combined contribution of $1,250,500.[29] Matthew Yglesias wrote that \"Saban was the largest overall contributor to the Democratic National Committee during the 2001–2002 cycle.\"[31] Saban's donations during that 2001–2002 period exceeded $10 million, the largest donation the DNC has received from a single source up to that time.[citation needed]\n\nIn September 2004, Hillary Clinton described Saban as a very good friend, supporter and adviser: \"I am grateful for his commitment to Israel, to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East and to my foundation's work, particularly on reconciliation issues.\"[8] In May 2007, Haim publicly declared his support for Clinton in 2008 presidential election.[23] In June 2007, Saban and Steven Spielberg co-hosted a Hillary Clinton fundraiser at the house of Peter Chernin, the president of News Corporation.[32] According to the Los Angeles Times,[32] the fundraiser brought in over $850,000.[citation needed]\n\nIn March 2008, Saban was among a group of major Jewish donors to sign a letter to Democratic Party house leader Nancy Pelosi advising her not to run in the Democratic presidential primaries.[33] The donors were upset by Pelosi's statement that the party 'superdelegates' should heed the will of the majority in selecting a candidate.\"[33] The donors, who were strong supporters of the DCCC, implied that Pelosi could lose their financial support in upcoming congressional elections.\n\nIn May 2008, it was reported that Haim Saban had offered $1 million to the Young Democrats of America and urged the endorsement of Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee for president.\"[34]\n\nSaban has also made donations to members of the Republican Party including a 2003 contribution to George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign.[8]\n\nSaban supported Hillary Clinton for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Between June 2015 and June 2016, he and his wife donated US$7 million to Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton Super PAC. Meanwhile, Saban has called Republican candidate Donald Trump \"a danger to America\".[35]\n\nSaban has said that Keith Ellison, who ran for the leadership of the DNC, \"is clearly an anti-Semite and anti-Israel individual.\"[36][37][38] Saban also called Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \"an anti-Israel person.\"[39]\n\nIn 2006, Saban discussed his views on the Middle East and Persian Gulf region in an interview with Haaretz. Commenting on Iran, he said: \"When I see Ahmadinejad, I see Hitler. They speak the same language. His motivation is also clear: the return of the Mahdi is a supreme goal. And for a religious person of deep self-persuasion, that supreme goal is worth the liquidation of five and a half million Jews. We cannot allow ourselves that. Nuclear weapons in the hands of a religious leadership that is convinced that the annihilation of Israel will bring about the emergence of a new Muslim caliphate? Israel cannot allow that. This is no game. It's truly an existential danger.\"[40] If Obama strikes a \"bad deal\" with Iran that would put Israel at risk, \"I would bomb the living daylights out of these sons of bitches,\" Saban said at a meeting of the Israeli American Council.[41]\n\nIn 2005, Saban spent $100,000[42] to oppose California's 2005 Proposition 77 redistricting reform. Saban contributed $100,000[43] to pass California's 2008 redistricting reform, Proposition 11, which created a Citizens Redistricting Commission to redraw California's state political boundaries, but not U.S. Congressional districts. Saban contributed $2,000,000[44] to support Proposition 27, California's proposed 2010 repeal of Proposition 11, the 2008 redistricting reform – the same reform that Haim Saban previously supported with a $100,000 contribution. He joined list of other well-connected, big-money donors to the Democratic Party in supporting Proposition 27.[citation needed]"
