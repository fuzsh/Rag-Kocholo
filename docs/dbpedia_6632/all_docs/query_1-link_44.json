        "text": "The News Team's SweetShop209 has a new review on the front page of AnimeSuperhero.com:\n\n\"Review: “Barbie: Princess Adventure”: A Flawed, But Still Solid Movie\"​\n\n\"When it comes to the world of big doll franchises, Barbie is definitely among the most iconic. Though I’ve known about Barbie since I was a kid, I didn’t take much interest in the franchise until I was an adult when I started watching Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures. It’s a show that I find pretty charming given how fun and likable the cast is and how well written the messages are. Of course, it’s not exactly for everyone given how it does go for a more down to earth style that people don’t usually associate with Barbie. The fact that future movies and TV shows take place in the same continuity as the show might not be for everyone because of this, but I personally don’t mind it as long as said projects capture what makes the show great. Admittedly, it’s more because of how this is the Barbie I’m most familiar with, but I’ve seen some early 2000s and and 2010s movies. Anyway, I feel that the subject of today’s review, the movie Barbie: Princess Adventure, captures what makes the show great, albeit with some issues. Spoilers are ahead.\"\n\nRead the full review here."
