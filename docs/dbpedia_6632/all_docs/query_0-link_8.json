        "text": "This is a petition for Haim Saban to purchase most of the currently mismanaged Fox Kids library back from Disney, so it can have more exposure again, both on TV and DVD.\n\nhttp://www.petitiononline.com/SabanFox/petition.html\n\nI know this won't do any good, but ever since Saban bought back Power Rangers and failed to buy HiT Entertainment, he needs to pay for this library and buy it back from Disney's much underexploited BVS Entertainment division so he can exploit it more than before.\n\nIf you are a Fox Kids fan, please sign this petition right away. I'd be glad for it to get much support.\n\nUm.......has Saban put his most popular property, Power Rangers, on DVD yet?\n\nThe answer is no. So why would he do the same for any of these?\n\nI'm thinking he needs to hammer out a deal with a DVD company, and that could take some time. I mean consider that Nickelodeon bought the TMNT in October of 2009, yet it wasn't until April of this year (2011) that IDW announced that they had acquired the comic book license to that property.\n\nThe problems with buying back the old Saban library are threefold:\n\n1) A lot of the older Saban anime titles are owned by outside studios, most notably Nippon Animation. Nippon more or less reclaimed their titles around 2001, after the Disney deal. Stuff like Grimm's Fairy Tale Theater, Tom Sawyer, Li'l Bits, Noozles, and Maya the Bee are no longer under the thumb of Disney. Same thing with Tatsunoko's Cat Ninja Legend Teyandee(Samurai Pizza Cats) and Nina Wolmark's The Engulfed World (Spartakus and the Sun Beneath the Sea).\n\n2) The Marvel library that Saban owned aren't going anywhere. Disney owns Marvel and all Marvel series outright save Spectacular Spider-Man, Ultraforce, and Men in Black, and they're not giving that up. Which brings me to this point:\n\n3) Disney's not selling anything to Saban after being snookered. The only reason Saban got Power Rangers back was because Disney was told Saban was trying to get a deal with The Hub. Had Disney known that Saban was planning to bring Power Rangers to Nickelodeon instead, Disney would still own Power Rangers. It would be nice if Disney sold a lot of the Saban stuff that Saban/Fox Kids actually owned outright, like Xyber 9, Mad Jack and Diabolik, and the non-Saban fare that was a part of Fox Kids like Peter Pan and the Pirates., but they're in a box somewhere at Disney that will do nobody any good.\n\nShame.,\n\n2) The Marvel library that Saban owned aren't going anywhere. Disney owns Marvel and all Marvel series outright save Spectacular Spider-Man, Ultraforce, and Men in Black, and they're not giving that up. Which brings me to this point:\n\nDisney/Marvel doesn't own the Hanna-Barbera Fantastic 4 cartoon from the 1960s or the Thing portion of Fred & Barney Meet the Thing, or do they?\n\nAlso, do they the own the DePate/Freleng-produced shows (F4 '78, Spider-Woman, and Spidey '81)?\n\nAnd doesn't Sony own the CGI Spidey cartoon from 2003 that aired on MTV? And isn't the Fantastic 4: World's Greatest Heroes owned by Fox in the states, and WB overseas?\n\nAnd finally, who owns the granddaddy of obscure Marvel cartoons: The Japanese Dracula and Frankenstein anime films?\n\n3) Disney's not selling anything to Saban after being snookered.

Nippon more or less reclaimed their titles around 2001, after the Disney deal. Stuff like Grimm's Fairy Tale Theater, Tom Sawyer, Li'l Bits, Noozles, and Maya the Bee are no longer under the thumb of Disney. Same thing with Tatsunoko's Cat Ninja Legend Teyandee(Samurai Pizza Cats) and Nina Wolmark's The Engulfed World (Spartakus and the Sun Beneath the Sea).\n\nBut in that case, wouldn't Disney still own the master materials and some rights for the actual Saban dubs for those show?\n\nThat would create issues even if the Japanese companies WANTED to reissue those shows in the US again.\n\nDisney/Marvel doesn't own the Hanna-Barbera Fantastic 4 cartoon from the 1960s or the Thing portion of Fred & Barney Meet the Thing, or do they?\n\nNope, forgotten about that.\n\nAlso, do they the own the DePate/Freleng-produced shows (F4 '78, Spider-Woman, and Spidey '81)?\n\nConsidering DePatie/Freleng became Marvel Entertainment, yeah, they have those too.\n\nAnd doesn't Sony own the CGI Spidey cartoon from 2003 that aired on MTV? And isn't the Fantastic 4: World's Greatest Heroes owned by Fox in the states, and WB overseas?\n\nForgot about the former. Sony owns distribution rights just as they do for Spectacular.Taffy Entertainment owns the latter, Cartoon Network International distributes it globally.\n\nAnd finally, who owns the granddaddy of obscure Marvel cartoons: The Japanese Dracula and Frankenstein anime films?.\n\nDracula: Sovereign of the Damned was produced by Toei, but I think it, like the Spider-Man sentai series, is also owned by Disney via Marvel. Those foreign rights are sticky to say the least.\n\n1) A lot of the older Saban anime titles are owned by outside studios, most notably Nippon Animation.

Same thing with Tatsunoko's Cat Ninja Legend Teyandee(Samurai Pizza Cats)\n\nI came across some info that seems to contradict this. Around the time Capcom was preparing the International port of Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom for the Wii, they specifically asked to use the Pizza Cats characters but at the very last minute Tatsunoko backed out of the deal for no reason given. Sources here and here.\n\nI came across some info that seems to contradict this. Around the time Capcom was preparing the International port of Tatsunoko Vs.

Sources here and here.\n\nNot really a contradiction. While the rights were being held up because BVS International had some rights to the franchise, that's in the past. The distribution rights they had are either now expired or set to expire later in the year. Same with Technoman (Tekkaman WAS in the game as well, and that series was also a Tatsunoko/Sotsu joint venture much like SPC). So, yeah, not a contradiction."
