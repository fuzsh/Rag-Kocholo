        "text": "Dubs Silly Eulogy For Fox Kids!\n\n**walks up to podium in preachers robe and lays a rose on Fox Kids coffin**\n\nAHEM\n\nDub's Nifty Spiffy Eulogy for Fox Kids! ^_______^\n\nladies and gentlemen, I sit in my dormitory room and I watch the tattered remains of the once great empire of Fox Kids. Fox Kids lived to a ripe old age where it became cranky, ornery and overall just not any good at all. Fox Kids started mild in its years not having done much with its life, but was known quite often in the community for taking overseas orphaned Sentai children under its wing. Renaming these disturbing beings of Humanity \"Power Rangers\" fox Kids raised these freakish giant robot Sentai children to be the head of its empire. The first set known among the Neighborhood kids as \"Mighty Morphin\" produced over 220 memorable quips and episodes and fought valiantly to protect the its citizens from badly dubbed asian women actors who hurled magic wands to make thier monsters grow. After this teh creepily dubbed asian women married a man with its insides on the outside and they produced many more perversions of Sentai. (Fox Kids led a weird life to be sure)\n\nBut its life was not all Rangers and Rita. many cartoons graced its doorstep such as The Animaniacs (who often made fun of thier hosts ineptitude, the ungrateful brat children that they were ), and Batman and Robin (who left the show early when Robin began to lay eggs much to the dismay of Fox Kids executives). And let us not forget Goosebumps...no one really cared about goosebumps and the poor child left Fox kids never to be seen again. Rumor has it that his original father R.L. Stine ditched his child for a more sophistiicated ire of stupid teeny bopper horror books.\n\nAfter a while Fox Kids let the Mighty Morphins go and sent them on thier way. They changed personalities many times, suffering many identity crisis at the hands of thier father, the malicious Haim Saban, and have currently gone wild (i.e. PLUM LOCO)\n\nAfter Fox Kids became infested with a disease of odd bugs called Digimon, it was all over. Fox Kids died at a ripe merry old age and is succeeded by its red headed stepchild 4 Kids who shall carry on its legacy.\n\nIn short Fox Kids lived like a dog and he died like a dog\n\nAnd thus conluding my eulogy I say to you all - \"MAGIC WAND: MAKE MY MONSTER GROW !!!!!!!!\"\n\n**grows to the size of a large building, stomps the coffin, and cackles away madly**\n\nGawd I'm bored......that was so wrong of me....I think I'll go watch an ep of Transformers now to ease my pain. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo. ^_________^\n\n**dont mind me, I'm feeling stupid ^__^**\n\n(Walks up to the podium....)\n\nI'll keep it brief: Started off sort of lame....I mean, \"Tom and Jerry *KIDS*?!\"...then rose to greatness with Batman, A!, Taz-Mania, Beetlejuice, and picking up TTA from syndication (sounds of the younger, 90's-raised members of this board muttering \"syndication? What's that?\" and \"since when were cartoons ever *syndicated*?!\")(Frowning) *Ahem*.... *anyway*, after this, the WB started up, and they sucked away all their WB-made shows....then Spider-Man ended, and with its departure, came the cruddy anime-onslaught. Quite frankly, I'm not much of an anime fan, I admit...seeing characters with eyes enormous and saucer-like enough to resemble Buddy's never did much for me... (sounds of the anime-fans on the board getting annoyed), but anyway, still doesn't explain *why* we needed *digital* monsters---didn't realize the old-fashioned *analog* kind I grew up with were somehow obsolete. Anyway, soon after this, KWB, with its Poke-onslaught, easily defeated Fox Kids, sending the weekday afternoon lineup packing, to be replaced by local FOX affiliates by... (checks his local affiliates' schedule) ah, yes: Maury Povich, Seventh Heaven, and Jenny Jones. Apparently, my affiliate decided that stuff like \"my boyfriend cheated on *both* his other girlfriends\" is OK to put on at 3 PM against \"Pokemon\"... but anyway, eventually came the death blow: 4Kids buys out Fox Kids, and is set to reprogram its ailing Sat. morning lineup. Meaning lots of shows similar to that \"Yu-Gi-Oh\" thingamajig, I figure... (muttering) \"Yu-Gi-Oh\"...sounds like a second-rate imported automobile... (shakes his head) Anyway, looks like for next fall, with Discovery Channel programming NBC and CBS still airing \"Blue's Clues\"-type stuff, that leaves Kids' WB (Holds up a picture of Scooby), or ABC's all-Disney, all-the-time lineup (holds up a picture of \"Teamo Supremo\"; looks at it, then tears it up and throws it away). Anyway, I'm done... (hears whispering off-stage) Yeah, so this *wasn't* brief.... (shrugs, and walks off)\n\n-B.\n\nEulogy to A Fallen Block\n\nI come here as a long time viewer, witnessing the evolution of the block from a block full of weird shows to a golden age of animation to succumbing to a viral mix of bad politics and foreign bodies.\n\nI don't want to dwell on the final days. Afterall, there were so many factors that led to its demise. Instead, I want to reflect on the good times.\n\nFox Kids was the K-Beast's first child, one that he left behind in good hands with its mother, Margaret Loeche, formed in the spring of 1990 before coming to life that fall. The block had some awkward phases with weird shows like Pigsburg Pigs, Zazoo U., Little Shop, and very ambitious shows like Peter Pan and the Pirates. Fox Kids actually brought the animation studio of Warner Bros. back to life by not only placing Tiny Toons on their lineup, but by also allowing the creation of other fine programming, including TazMania, Batman: The Animated Series, and Animaniacs. Fox Kids also knew how to let the creative mind behind the Press Your Luck Whammys and One Crazy Summer, Savage Steve Holland, let loose with Eek! The Cat, gave Marvel Comics a new home to spotlight their creations Spider-Man and X-Men, and made Haim Saban's name famous with the Power Rangers franchise. Fox Kids also gave the independant comic creators have a voice on their network with The Tick, Sam and Max, The Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot, and Cybersix, not to mention greenlighting miniseries like Red Planet and Dark Water.\n\nAlas, after mother Margaret left, Fox Kids fell into hard times, particularly under the thumbprint of Saban, with a lot of outside shows disappearing and more Saban-made shows cluttering the block. Of course, following the lead of the K-Beast's acquisition of Pokemon, Fox Kids followed with Digimon, a series with a better plot but not a lot of fan support in the mass market. Ill-fated acquisitions like The Family Channel, and ill-fated projects like bChannel and gChannel also led to the premature demise. After the latter two networks bombed miserably, the two Fox Family outlets (Fox Kids and Fox Family Channel) took the ill-conceived genderizations. Growing disapproval by affiliates, News Corps' dream of owning DirecTV, and Saban's willingness to get out of the network with a profit were the final gasps of the Fox Kids Network, dying the moment Fox Family Worldwide was bought by Disney.\n\nSo, today, I'm mourning the network that was, not the husk that it became. So long Fox Kids. It's been real."
