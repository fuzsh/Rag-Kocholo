Will they be picking up with Shinkenger or skipping to Goseiger?\n\nBack to top\n\nSaban is still around? I thought they got bought out by Disney or something.\n\nBack to top\n\nHaim Saban is still around, he recently bought Univision (The US #1 Spanish Language Network), So I guess getting one of the things that made him a lot of money back then isn't that strange for him as apparently Disney wanted to let it loose.\n\nBack to top\n\nRomuska wrote:\n\nSaban is still around?

Same with Harmony Gold.\n\nQuote:\n\nDisney had purchased the franchise in 2001, but decided not to place it underneath the Disney brand umbrella after focus group research showed that mothers disliked the violence. Disney has been shopping for a new owner for the franchise for more than a year.\n\nand it's things like these they gave the rise to companies like nelvana & 4kids. Cause if parents,especially mothers go midevil for the content of power rangers of all things, then you cant really blame 4kids or nelvana for it's massive editing of series otherwise they would faced the same thing.\n\nEither way I am not happy it's gonna be on nick. cause though I dont have that. Also other PR fans who only have local channels are cringing right now. It would have been better if they had given it to CW for it's sat morning run now that Kamen Rider is not longer there.\n\nBack to top\n\nNaruto on Disney\n\nDBZ on Nicktoons and 4Kids\n\nAnd now this\n\nThe world is not what it used to be.\n\nBack to top\n\nI am still waiting on a Power Rangers anime. Am I the only one who thinks that is an awesome idea?\n\nBack to top\n\nGood for him. I loved this show (well, when it first started) for its complete campy and ridiculous premise. It's definitely one of my guilty pleasures. One of these days, I'll buy the series.\n\nAnd yes, I went to see the movie in theaters when it came out. I thought it was okay, though I felt the larger budget actually took away some of the elements which made the TV show.\n\nI may just have to set my DVR to start recording the series again, just for old times sake.\n\nBack to top\n\njr0904 wrote:\n\nEither way I am not happy it's gonna be on nick. cause though I don't have that.

Kamen Rider was routinely the lowest rated show on the CW4Kids, and Ultraman completely fell on its face.

And the network that broadcasts new Supernatural episodes and used to show Reaper.\n\nOtherwise, yes, the network 'still' blows. Vampire Diaries, Gossip Girl, the apparently god awful 90210 remake and many other horrendous productions.\n\nOnce Supernatural finishes next year though... Hopefully, the network can finally die in peace with it's god awful audience as well.\n\nBack to top\n\nHave you guys seen what's be done to the \"re-versioned\" Mighty Morphin Power Rangers that's been airing recently? Added a bit more special effects and comic book-like things (sound effects when hitting enemies). Seriously, totally unnecessary.\n\nCan't wait for more Power Rangers.

Disney barely aired it and no one has put it on DVD except, IIRC, the Germans for $70 a set. X.x I don't have the time or money to track down the 50 something VHS tapes either\n\nBack to top KabaKabaFruit\n\nJoined: 20 Sep 2007\n\nPosts: 1882\n\nLocation: Winnipeg, Manitoba\n\nPosted: Thu May 13, 2010 10:18 am\n\nIf this means that Power Rangers can air again with its original FOX broadcast version, then I'm all for Saban re-acquiring this series. However, I'm also surprised that Haim Saban is getting back into the children's broadcast game again considering that he decided to pull out after the turn of the century.\n\nI'm also hoping that this move will finally get Power Rangers on DVD and Blu-Ray. But, I'm not too sure considering that Haim Saban is a notoriously stubborn businessman and whether Toei is willing to let the series get released on DVD.\n\nBack to top agila61\n\nJoined: 22 Feb 2009\n\nPosts: 3213\n\nLocation: NE Ohio\n\nPosted: Thu May 13, 2010 10:58 am\n\nRomuska wrote:\n\nSaban is still around?

Haim Saban and Shuki Levy were former execs for DiC entertainment. In the Spring of 1984, they were commissioned to do a live-action saturday morning cartoon called \"Kidd Video\". http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bJrDb6KS8g\n\nBack to top"
