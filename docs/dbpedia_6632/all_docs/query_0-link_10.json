        "text": "Saban Brands could still get licensing for the dub still. Remember, Xros Wars has been available, subbed, by Crunchyroll since November of 2011. Saban Brands got it dubbed and it aired almost two years later. Saban is usually interested in dubbed anime.\n\n^_^\n\nThe difference with tri. is that it's the first Digimon anime product to not be aimed primarily at children. It's aimed at adult fans, which puts it outside of Saban's target marketing demographic.\n\nSaban's aware of their products having adult fanbases, but their products are still aimed predominately at children. And since tri. isn't, they might not concern themselves with dubbing tri. into English if either they can't market it to kids or if it wouldn't be successful enough with kids.\n\nExactly this.\n\nI actually disagree entirely.\n\nThey're clearly aware of how their brands market's have expanded. Those fancy PR boxes they did with Shout that cost hundreds of dollars weren't aimed at kids. Nor are the subtitled Super Sentai boxes.\n\nI expect this is them working with Toei in something Toei really wanted to do for marketing purposes (thus far there has not been a premium animation that hasn't had an English release on day 1.)\n\nIt lets fans build up the hype themselves for an eventual 'full' American release.\n\nIt also gives Toei and Saban a ton of delicious and valuable demographic data on a brand that Toei clearly wants to build up.\n\nYou made a point here. You guys remember that Power Rangers Legacy Collection? You know, the one with the helmet sized DVD case? That had an original MSRP of US$650.00 shipped (which I bought by the way.....discounted). If you were to order that, you'll be directed to a shopping cart page with the \"Saban Brands\" logo in the top left corner. Saban understands to an extent what it's fanbase of the MMPR series is like even if they've all grown up. Besides, I can't think of any problems for Saban in bringing a dubbed tri. miniseries to television. From what I understand, Haim Saban has had experience before in trying to bring a series, which was more mature than tri., to a kids oriented programming block (Escaflowne).\n\n[From what I understand, Haim Saban has had experience in trying to bring a series, which was more mature than tri., to a kids oriented programming block (Escaflowne).\n\nEscaflowne was a bit of an odd take. As I recall... Fox licensed it to air on Fox Kids because they got wind that Toonami was interested in it and they decided to jump on it to try and 'outfox' Toonami.\n\nFox didn't directly produce content for their kids block at this time (they co-owned Saban via their business dealings in Fox Family Worldwide) and left it to them to deal with.\n\nSaban Entertainment tweaked the show as Fox requested to try and make it fit the aimed goals of Fox Kids (which was never realistically going to happen.)\n\nVery quickly when it became obvious it wasn't going to work Fox pulled the plug and Saban could stop dealing with a show they never would have dealt with if it hadn't been handed to them and told to make it fit.\n\nHaim Saban is listed as a producer on the 'Fox' edited version, but it's unlikely he had much (if anything) to do personally with it.\n\nAnd of course, there is no guarantee tri. would be pushed to a kids block. Saban Brands has various distribution channels that could work (various digital streaming solutions, home video, a very limited theatrical run, or even trying to air it as a special somewhere as a 'franchise that has grown up', etc.)"
