        "text": "Cheryl Saban is well-known for her dedication to pediatric medical research, foster care education sponsorship, and affordable health care for everyone.\n\nDr. Saban is the author of WHAT IS YOUR SELF-WORTH? A Woman’s Guide to Validation, for which she appeared on many national television and radio shows, including Today, The Early Show, The View, Larry King Live, Charlie Rose and the Jim Bohannon Show.\n\nShe has written numerous articles about women, children, marriage, parenting and socio-political issues and is a regular blogger for HuffingtonPost.com.\n\nHer previous books include New Mothers Survival Guide, Miracle Child, Sins of the Mother, Griffin’s Play Group, 50 Ways to Save our Children, Recipe for a Good Marriage and Recipe for Good Parenting.\n\nDr. Sabans first-hand experience working with chronically ill children and their parents primarily mothers was instrumental in her decision to write a book about the value of women.\n\nObserving the dedication, multi-tasking and endless devotion required of the mothers, as well as the difficulties and roadblocks many of them faced, helped fuel Dr. Sabans interest and involvement in women’s health and well-being issues not only in Los Angeles, but all over the world.\n\nDr. Saban was raped as a teenager, married for the first time at age 20, a mother at 21, again at 23 and divorced for the first time at 25. A second failed marriage followed.\n\nAs a result of these and other experiences, she doubted her own worth. Despite outside influences and difficult circumstances, she learned how to feel good about herself, and her life was forever changed.\n\nShe met and married multi-billionaire philanthropist and humanitarian Haim Saban, CEO of Saban Capital, with whom she had two more children and to whom she has been happily married for more than twenty years. Dr. Saban reflects on the lessons she learned along her path to happiness in WHAT IS YOUR SELF-WORTH?.\n\nReaders can relate to Dr. Saban because she understands what theyre going through. She is at once a teacher, a counselor and a student, for she knows from experience that there are few absolutesthat life is about change and adaptation.\n\nIn her book, Dr. Saban bravely shares her own foibles, tragedies and triumphs in order to send a message of hope and possibility to others.\n\nBorn and raised in San Diego, California, Dr. Saban attended San Diego State College before moving up to Marin. Eventually relocating to Los Angeles, she gained wisdom in the school of life before going on to earn her Ph.D. in Psychology in 2005.\n\nA member of the American Psychological Association, Dr. Saban is also on the board of Trustees of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, The Los Angeles Free Clinic and The Marc & Jane Nathanson Mental Health Resource Center at UCLA. Her other affiliations include The Everychild Foundation, The Los Angeles Rape Center, Plan International, Women for Women International, Women’s Funding Network, PeaceKeeper Cosmetics and the Saban Center for Middle East Studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nA frequent keynote speaker, Dr. Saban and her husband host numerous political and charitable salons and functions each year and believe in giving back to the community.\n\nIn conjunction with the release of WHAT IS YOUR SELF-WORTH?, Dr. Saban has formed the non-profit Womens Self-Worth Foundation, through which 100% of her author proceeds will benefit multiple womens philanthropic funds in the U.S. and abroad, many of them under the umbrella of the established Womens Funding Network.\n\nSeveral charity partners are onboard to help promote her message, including Women’s Funding Network, Heifer International, Women for Women International, Cancer Schmancer, CARE, Plan USA, Saban Free Clinic and the International Women’s Media Foundation."
