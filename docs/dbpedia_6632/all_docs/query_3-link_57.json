I'm trying to think of which series would be the best and worst for this to work.\n\nBoondocks and Black Dynamite: Already drawn in an animesque style. Probably won't get anime adaptations. The former definitely wouldn't work because the show relies heavily on satirizing African American social issues.\n\nVenture Bros: show heavily inspired by the American action cartoon Jonny Quest. An action (er... more action) version of Venture Bros. doesn't sound like a bad idea on paper, but it is based on a highly American style of action cartoon.\n\nRobot Chicken: Japanese copyright law is a lot stricter and they probably couldn't do the blatant parodying the main show does. The stop motion is integral to its identity and it wouldn't be Robot Chicken in 2D animation. Also being a sketch show, it will be impossible to translate into a plot driven anime. Yes, sketch comedy exist, but I'm thinking all anime adaptations are going to be story driven action versions of Adult Swim cartoons.\n\nSmiling Friends: Isn't violence kinda antithetical to the Smiling Friends mission of spreading happiness? I don't know how to turn Smiling Friends into an action cartoon without it being Smiling Friends in Name Only.\n\nMetalocalypse: Metal and action cartoons exist and would probably be fine AMV material. If executed properly, could maybe work.\n\nAqua Teen Hunger Force: Because of it's surreal nature, impossible to turn into a dramatic, story driven series without it being Aqua Teen Hunger Force in name only. An action/comedy series might be absurd enough to work if it keeps the comedy.\n\nSpace Ghost Coast to Coast: Wouldn't work as it is a talk show, which wouldn't work as an action show. You can adapt the 60s Space Ghost into an anime with more luck.\n\nMaking a comedy cartoon into a non comedy is removing the reason people love said show. Making action versions of comedy cartoons seems like a terrible idea. I hope Adult Swim calls quits on making anime versions of their comedy cartoons. There are tons of great action cartoons out there and we don't need to have actionized versions of comedy cartoons. Let the comedies stay comedies."
