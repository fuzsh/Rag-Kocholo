        "text": "Notable philanthropists Dr. Cheryl Saban and husband Haim Saban have been set as honorees at the third bi-annual Rebels With a Cause gala, scheduled for May 11 at Santa Monica’s Barker Hangar.\n\nMore than 500 guests are expected to attend the event, which benefits research led by David B. Agus, M.D., director of the Westside Cancer Center and the Center for Applied Molecular Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.\n\nJames Corden has been tapped to emcee the gala, a month ahead of his next major event outing as the host of the 70th annual Tony Awards. Joining the host of The Late Late Show will be Grammy winner David Foster, who returns as musical director, and Don Mischer, who will produce. Sandy and David Ellison along with Skydance Media serve as the night’s co-chairs. USC president C.L. Max Nikias is an honorary co-chair.\n\nMusical performances have yet to be announced.\n\nThe USC Center for Applied Molecular Medicine was founded at the Keck School of Medicine in 2009 by Agus to develop new cross-disciplinary approaches to treating and preventing cancer. Of the Sabans‘ upcoming honor, Agus said that it’s a challenge to think of a deserving charity in Los Angeles that “has not been touched by the generosity” of the couple. He added: “The designation of Rebels With a Cause speaks not just to what the Sabans do, but how they do it. As individuals, they have each carved out incredible careers … as a couple, their compassion for humanity and making a difference in the lives of others knows no bounds and we are all richer for their myriad contributions.”\n\nCheryl Saban, Ph.D., is a writer, psychologist, former Public Delegate to the United Nations, philanthropist and advocate for women and children. She has penned 14 books and is a regular contributor to The Huffington Post. She founded a non-profit organization, The Cheryl Saban Self-Worth Foundation for Women and Girls, and serves as president of the Saban Family Foundation.\n\nEntertainment tycoon Haim Saban serves as chairman and CEO of Saban Capital Group, a private investment firm established in 2001. SCG’s current private equity investments include Saban Brands LLC, Saban Films, Saban Ventures, Univision Communications, Celestial Tiger Entertainment, MNC and Partner Communications."
