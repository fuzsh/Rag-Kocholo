        "text": "Cable and satellite channel Fox Kids and Saban Entertainment, which\n\nmakes children’s live action programme Power Rangers, have decided to\n\ncombine their PR accounts.\n\nBoth businesses are owned by Fox Family Worldwide, a joint venture\n\nbetween Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Broadcasting Company and Haim Saban’s Saban\n\nEntertainment.\n\nThe companies saw pitches from four agencies, and a final pitch was held\n\nthis week between Peter Noble PR and Harrison Cowley. An appointment is\n\nexpected within days.\n\nThe agency will work to promote programmes to be broadcast on Fox Kids\n\nand new programmes from Saban with existing and potential viewers. The\n\nwork with Saban will be designed to help boost its UK licensing and\n\nmerchandising business.\n\nBy publicising Saban programmes, the agency will help support existing\n\nlicensees and attract new ones.\n\nThe agency will work alongside Fox Kids’ PR and publicity head Katie\n\nBourne and Saban Entertainment UK managing director Jackie Ferguson.\n\nPR for Fox Kids was previously handled by Firefly Communications, while\n\nSaban retained Richard Dennis on a project basis.\n\nSaban makes and acquires animated and live-action children’s TV\n\nshows.\n\nFox Kids UK reaches more than one million children every month."
