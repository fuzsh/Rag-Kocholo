        "text": "The Television Academy has received a significant gift for its New Destination Campaign and its reimagined NoHo Arts District campus from noted philanthropists Cheryl and Haim Saban and The Saban Family Foundation.\n\nIn recognition of this gift, the new building for the expanded campus will be named the Saban Media Center.\n\n\"We are deeply appreciative of this extremely generous gift from the Saban Family Foundation,\" said Television Academy Chairman and CEO Bruce Rosenblum.\n\n\"Cheryl and Haim are clearly dedicated to educational and cultural philanthropy which is the focus of our new Saban Media Center. It's a place to house and support our Academy Foundation, celebrate creative excellence, and host industry game-changers and leaders in related fields for the exchange of ideas and the introduction of new technologies, concepts and business models.\"\n\nHaim Saban, founder of Saban Entertainment and Fox Family Worldwide, and currently the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Saban Capital Group and Chairman of the Board of Univision Communications Inc., said, \"Television is constantly evolving and Cheryl and I are honored to play a meaningful role in that evolution in partnership with the Academy.\n\n\"We share the Academy's passion for encouraging and providing thought leadership through education, collaboration, and the spirit of community. We're also excited to help the Academy's Foundation thrive and expand its work and educational outreach.\"\n\nThe 30,000 square foot LEED-certified Saban Media Center will be a state-of-the-art home for the Television Academy and its Foundation, enhancing the organization's ability to support and educate its 20,000 above and below-the-line members and creating a nurturing environment to educate the next generation of television leaders through internships, scholarships, professional training and recognition programs like the College Television Awards.\n\nThe Saban Media Center will also include a technology center and pocket studio where interns placed by the Academy's philanthropic Foundation and other young professionals can hone their skills.\n\nThe Television Academy is the only organization that represents all aspects of the creative process of developing and producing television content: its 29 professional peer groups include writers, directors, costume designers, performers, sound editors, special visual effects and cinematographers among others."
