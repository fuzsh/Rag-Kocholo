        "text": "Objectives: To compare seizure burden between newborn infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and those that were not and to compare the need for antiseizure medications (ASM) in a cohort of infants who were diagnosed with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).\n\nMethods: This was a retrospective cohort study on infants born after 35 weeks' gestation, diagnosed with moderate to severe HIE, monitored with amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and eligible for TH. Infants born before the implementation of TH in 2008 were compared with infants born thereafter who received TH. Seizure burden was assessed from aEEG as total time in minutes of seizures activity per hour of recording. Other clinical and demographic data were retrieved from a prospective local database of infants with HIE.\n\nResults: Overall, 149 of 207 infants were included in the study: 112 exposed to TH and 37 not exposed. Cooled infants had a lower seizure burden overall (0.4 vs 2.3 min/h, P < 0.001) and were also less likely to be treated with ASM (74% vs 100%, P < 0.001). In multivariable regression models, not exposed to TH, having a depressed aEEG background, and having higher Apgar scores were associated with higher seizure burden (incidence rate ratio: 4.78 for noncooled infants, P < 0.001); also, not exposed to TH was associated with a higher likelihood of multidrug ASM (odds ratio: 4.83, P < 0.001)."
