        "text": "HILVERSUM, Netherlands, March 30, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Music Group N.V. (\"UMG\" or \"the Company\") today published its 2022 annual report and the agenda for its 2023 annual general meeting of shareholders (\"AGM\"), which is to be held on May 11, 2023, starting at 2:00 p.m. CEST, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nThe agenda for the 2023 AGM and other meeting materials, including the 2022 annual report, are available at: https://investors.universalmusic.com. The 2022 annual report has also been filed with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (the AFM) in European Single Electronic Format (ESEF).\n\nOn the agenda for the 2023 AGM is the proposed re-appointment of Sir Lucian Grainge as Executive Director for a five-year term (as set out in the press release of March 30, 2023, available at: https://investors.universalmusic.com/), the proposed appointment of Haim Saban as Independent Non-Executive Director for a two-year term as well as the proposed re-appointment of Sherry Lansing, Anna Jones and Luc van Os as Non-Executive Directors for a two-year term.\n\nAlthough each of Sherry Lansing, Anna Jones and Luc van Os has previously been appointed for a period until the close of the 2024 AGM, the Board proposes that each of them is re-appointed early at the 2023 AGM to ensure the continuity on the Board and avoid a situation whereby all of the Non-Executive Directors retire at the same time, such in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Company's Retirement Schedule for the Non-Executive Directors.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board has made a non-binding nomination for the (re-)appointment of the following Non-Executive Directors:\n\nAppointment of Haim Saban\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\n\nHaim Saban, 78, is an American citizen and an entrepreneur with more than four decades of experience building successful media and telecommunication businesses. He is the Chairman and CEO of Saban Capital LLC, a private Los Angeles-based investment firm that spans operations in real estate, venture capital, film and music.\n\nA native of Alexandria, Egypt, Mr. Saban immigrated at 12 to Israel, attending agricultural school and serving in the Israeli Defense Force. In Israel, Mr. Saban built the country's premier tour promotion business. After the Yom Kippur War, Mr. Saban relocated in 1975 to France, where he started a successful independent record company that sold more than 18 million records in eight years.\n\nIn 1983, Mr. Saban moved to Los Angeles where he built a chain of recording studios that rapidly became the top supplier of music for television programs. By 1988, Mr. Saban ventured into television production, forming Saban Entertainment, an international production, distribution and merchandising company that produced X-Men™ and additional shows and products based on Marvel Comics characters. Mr. Saban introduced \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\"™ to the U.S., which remains a pop culture phenomenon.\n\nIn partnership with News Corp. and Rupert Murdoch, Mr. Saban co-founded Fox Family Worldwide in 1996, creating a global television, broadcasting, production, distribution and merchandising company. In 2001, Walt Disney Co. acquired Fox Family for an enterprise value of USD 5.3 billion.\n\nMr. Saban founded Saban Capital Group (\"SCG\") and led an investor group in 2003 to buy a controlling stake in ProSiebenSat.1 Media, Germany's largest broadcaster. He served as Chairman of its Supervisory Board and in 2007 oversaw the sale of the controlling stake to KKR and Permira at a USD 7.5 billion valuation, representing five times the initial investment.\n\nIn 2005, SCG and Apax Partners acquired a controlling stake in Bezeq, Israel's largest telecom company, which they sold to Eurocom Group at a valuation of more than four-and-a-half times the initial investment five years later.\n\nSCG led the acquisition in 2007 of Univision Communications, the leading Spanish-language media company in the U.S. for which Mr. Saban served as Chairman.\n\nExpanding outside of media, SCG launched Saban Real Estate in 2009, acquiring commercial real estate globally with a transaction volume exceeding USD 4 billion, and Saban Brands in 2010 to purchase and manage media consumer brands. SCG sold the majority of the portfolio for nearly five times the initial investment to Hasbro for more than USD 500 million.\n\nSCG continues to make minority and controlling investments in early stage private and public companies, including Epic Games, Keshet, Kite Pharma and Roblox, among others; feature film projects through Saban Films; and private equity investments in companies, including Celestial Tiger. In 2019, SCG launched Saban Music Group, a global independent recorded music and publishing company, which partnered in 2020 with UMG for distribution.\n\nMr. Saban and his wife Cheryl started the Saban Family Foundation in 1999, which supports medical, children's and education programs across the U.S. and Israel. The Saban family has been featured on BusinessWeek's list of the 50 most generous U.S. philanthropists.\n\nRe-appointment of Sherry Lansing\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\n\nSherry Lansing, 78, is an American citizen and the founder and CEO of The Sherry Lansing Foundation, an organization dedicated to funding and raising awareness for cancer research, health, public education, and encore career opportunities.\n\nDuring a nearly 30-year career in the motion picture business, Ms. Lansing was involved in the production, marketing, and distribution of more than 200 films, including Academy Award winners Forrest Gump, Braveheart, and Titanic.

Ms. Lansing previously served on the boards of Qualcomm (from 2004 to 2014), Dole Foods (from 2009 to 2013) and RealD (from 2010 to 2014).\n\nIn recognition of her philanthropic endeavors, Ms. Lansing has received the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Science's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame, the American Association for Cancer Research Public Service Award, the Horatio Alger Humanitarian Award, the UCLA Women in Philanthropy Icon Award, and the Stem Cell Action Leadership Award, among many other honors.\n\nShe graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern University in 1966.\n\nRe-appointment of Anna Jones\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\n\nAnna Jones, 48, is a British citizen and an active angel investor and strategic advisor to large and small companies.
