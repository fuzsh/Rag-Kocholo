        "text": "At first, Haim Saban—the billionaire entertainment mogul best known for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers—had no interest in giving to the forthcoming Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. The Saban family foundation, run by Haim and his wife Cheryl, typically gives to causes focused on children, education and women’s health.\n\nBut Saban agreed to meet with Bob Iger, the Disney chief who chairs fundraising for the museum along with Tom Hanks and Annette Benning. Iger and Saban had long been friends, knowing each other from the industry—at one point, Disney had owned Power Rangers. The pair even cohosted a large fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n“Bob Iger, who chairs the fundraising, came to see me and we had breakfast. After a while he gave me a whole presentation and asked for $50 million,” Saban remembers, telling the Disney chief he’d talk to his wife. “I told her I am going to say no, and she said, ‘Are you crazy?’ I said ‘Why am I crazy; what did I do?’ She said, ‘It's such an important endeavor and your legacy, you cannot say no to this.’ So, of course, I said yes.”\n\nPledged in September, that $50 million gift is Saban’s largest single gift ever, and the May Co. Building, one of the museum’s main buildings, will be renamed the Saban Building.\n\nWhile the Academy has long intended to build a museum (it is even mentioned in a 1949 report), the modern museum is the brainchild of former president of the Academy Frank Pierson, film producers Sid Ganis and Hawk Koch, and the Academy's current CEO Dawn Hudson. While the Academy is still in charge of the museum, its board of trustees includes NBC Universal Vice Chairman Ron Meyer, Tom Hanks, Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos and Kathleen Kennedy.\n\nThe Renzo Piano-designed museum, which will be in in the heart of Los Angeles, will not only celebrate the Sabans’ hometown, but also the industry that has made Saban a billionaire. It will, almost unbelievably, be the first museum to celebrate motion pictures in Los Angeles.\n\nDue to open sometime next year, the museum will house an educational studio, two theaters, an observation deck and 50,000 square feet of exhibition space. While the collection will include all sorts of artifacts, such as Judy Garland’s red slippers from The Wizard of Oz and the typewriter Joseph Stephano used to type Psycho, as well as information about the history of film, there will also be a focus on the process of filmmaking and film’s impact on culture.\n\n“People can get inside of what it takes to make a move, what it takes to bring that magic life— from the spark of an idea, to writing a script to really making it happen with the scenery, the costumes, the sound, the set,” says Cheryl, adding that without film, she and Saban wouldn’t be where they are today.\n\nHands-on workshops will be offered for teenagers by industry mentors focusing on all aspects of filmmaking, and they will be made available to people from across Los Angeles’ wide demographic landscape. Additionally, there will be school tours and programs for school-aged students, fitting in with the Sabans’ larger dedication to education.\n\nThe museum is one of many causes that the Sabans have supported in their adopted home of Los Angeles.\n\n\"This is our home. We live here, and we feel a duty to participate in enhancing the lives of people less advantaged than us right here,\" says Cheryl.\n\nMainly focusing on children’s and women’s health initiatives and educational programs, they have given tens of millions to the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles and Saban Community Clinic, a free clinic open to members of the Los Angeles community.\n\n“One of the reasons we were so profoundly happy to give the gift to the clinic was because way before I ever met my husband, I was a patient there,” says Cheryl, who, at the time, was a single, working mother without insurance or the financial resources to pay for her own medical care. “I understand viscerally how it feels to go out looking for medical treatment.”\n\nSaban’s home has been Los Angeles for over three decades, but part of his heart is still in Israel, where he grew up. So for every dollar given in Los Angeles, he says he hopes to give a dollar away in Saban’s home country. The couple has given tens of millions to the Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces (Saban served in the Israeli army) and various hospitals in Israel that focus on the needs of women and children. In total, the Sabans have given $350 million to various initiatives around the world—mainly in Israel and Los Angeles.\n\nBorn in Egypt to Jewish parents, Haim Saban immigrated to Israel as a child, his entire family living in a one room flat in Tel Aviv. There wasn’t enough food for the family, but while giving money, food or clothing may not have been an option, the importance of giving back was still ingrained in him.\n\n“For me, it was about giving back to those I am close to...more than reaching out to the community. We didn’t have any money to give, so it was about the spirit of supporting, in our closest circle, those that need our support,” Saban says."
