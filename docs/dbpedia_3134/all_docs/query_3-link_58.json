        "text": "Morley is a market town and a civil parish within the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, in West Yorkshire, England. Morley is the largest town in the borough after Leeds itself. Morley forms part of the Heavy Woollen District.\n\nIt lies approximately 5 miles (8 km) south-west of Leeds city centre. It was built on seven hills: Scatcherd Hill, Dawson Hill, Daisy Hill, Chapel Hill, Hunger Hill, Troy Hill and Banks Hill. In 2011, the town and civil parish had populations of 44,440 and 27,738 respectively.\n\nThe town is split between the Morley North and Morley South wards (containing the town centre) of Leeds City Council, both making up part of the Leeds South West and Morley parliamentary constituency.\n\nHistory\n\nMorley was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as Morelege, Morelei and Moreleia. Morley means \"open ground by a moor\", from Old English mōr \"moor, clearing, pasture\" + lēah \"open ground, clearing\". It gave its name to Morelei Wapentac, a wapentake which probably met at Tingley.\n\nHowley Hall was built during the 1580s by Sir John Savile, a member of the great Yorkshire landowners, the Savile family. The house was besieged during the English Civil War in 1643 before the Battle of Adwalton Moor but appears to have sustained no serious damage. It continued to be occupied during the 17th century but fell into disrepair. The hall was demolished in 1730 but ruins exist including the cellars of its great hall.\n\nThe town became famous for its textile industry, notably the cloth, shoddy, which was worn by both sides in the American Civil War.\n\nOn 7 October 1872, 34 people were killed in an explosion at the Morley Main Colliery.\n\nGovernance\n\nHistorically, Morley was the centre of one of two divisions of the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley. Morley became a Municipal Borough in 1889 and under the Local Government Act 1972, was incorporated into the City of Leeds Metropolitan District. Morley is represented on Leeds City Council by three wards (namely Morley North, Morley South and Ardsley and Robin Hood) each with three councillors. At the 2010 general election, Morley and Outwood was won by Ed Balls of the Labour Party, who had been MP for Normanton since 2005, and served as Labour's Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2011 until 2015. Balls narrowly lost the seat at the 2015 general election to Conservative Andrea Jenkyns. In the 2024 General Election, Mark Sewards won a majority and ousted Andrea Jenkyns from the MP position after the constituency boundaries were redrawn to change Morley and Outwood to Leeds South West and Morley.\n\nA town council was established in 2000, though it does not cover Drighlington, Gildersome, Tingley and East and West Ardsley – areas formerly part of the municipal borough.\n\nFollowing a review of parliamentary representation in West Yorkshire, the Morley and Rothwell parliamentary constituency was abolished at the 2010 election and replaced by the Morley and Outwood constituency.\n\nThe town's coat of arms featured the symbolic principal industries of the municipal borough: textile manufacturing, coal mining and quarrying.\n\nGeography\n\nNeighbouring areas Bradford Armley Churwell, Leeds city centre Drighlington Rothwell Morley Batley Dewsbury Wakefield\n\nPresent\n\nMorley Town Hall is sometimes used for music recordings.
