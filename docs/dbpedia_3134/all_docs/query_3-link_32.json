        "text": "John Major was born on March 29, 1943 in London. He was the son of Tom Major-Ball, a retired circus performer who was 65 when John Major was born. He attended Cheam Common Primary School and Rutlish Grammar School, where he had an undistinguished academic career. In the mid '50s, his family was forced to move to Brixton, a poor neighborhood in South London and live in a cramped flat on Coldharbour Lane. John Major did not do well in secondary school and dropped out at age 16. Much later, he said that he could have been a better student and wished he had stayed in school.\n\nThroughout the early 1960s, John Major worked odd jobs, but was unemployed for much of the time. He occupied himself by joining the Young Conservatives. He finally found steady employment in 1963, working for the London Electricity Board. He also took a correspondence course in banking, which would become his main career. He took a job as an executive at the Standard Charter Bank, which sent him on a business trip to Nigeria in 1967. Nigeria was in the middle of the Biafra War and John Major almost died in a car crash there. He survived the car accident, but lost a kneecap. He married his wife, Norma Wagstaff, in October 1970 and they have two children.\n\nIn the 1979 General Election, John Major was elected Conservative MP for Huntington. He served in Parliament for twenty-two years. When neighboring MP John Wakeham was badly injured in the 1984 Brighton bombing, John Major acted as substitute MP for Wakeham's constituency. The following year, John Major was appointed Minister for Pensions and Social Security. He was appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 1987 and in 1989, was appointed Foreign Secretary. He accompanied Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the trip to Malaysia to meet with heads of other Commonwealth Countries. But after being Foreign Secretary for only three months, he was moved to the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nIn November 1990, Michael Heseltine contested Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Margaret Thatcher did not win the required two-thirds majority to remain leader, so a second ballot was held. Margaret Thatcher's cabinet all told her that she would lose a leadership ballot to Michael Heseltine and encouraged her to resign. So on November 22, 1990, Margaret Thatcher stood down as Prime Minister. But the Conservatives still had to elect a new leader. Michael Heseltine was in for the second ballot. John Major now entered the contest, as Margaret Thatcher's preferred candidate. So did Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary. John Major won the second ballot and went on to become Prime Minister.\n\nJohn Major had some giant shoes to fill on becoming Prime Minister. At first, people welcomed his quiet, low-key and modest public manner, but it quickly became clear that John Major was just not up to the job. Nonetheless, he narrowly won the 1992 General Election for the Conservative Party. Major's term in office brought Britain's humiliating withdrawal from the ERM in late-1992. He tried to steer a middle course on Europe, but only angered both the pro-Europeans and the Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party. His failure to ratify the Maastrict Treaty in Britain cost him. He tried to re-focus the Conservative Party on \"basics\"--rule of law, police, family values, education--but this backfired as the media was encouraged to start digging for scandal, and they found it.\n\nHis authority was so badly diminished that in 1995, he brought matters to a head by calling a leadership ballot for July and vowing to step down if he did not receive the required majority. His line to his opponents was \"Put up or shut up.\" He won the ballot, but it resolved nothing and he spent his last two years in office marking time. The Conservative Party lost its majority in Parliament in December 1996, but John Major managed to stay in office for a few more months.\n\nFinally, his term ran out and he called a General Election for May 1997. It was a long campaign, in which he hoped to stave off defeat and give the Labour Party, now led by Tony Blair, enough time to trip up and lose the election. But on 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered its worst-ever defeat. Labour won by a landslide, with a 179 seat majority in Parliament. John Major held his seat, but a number of cabinet ministers went down to defeat. John Major resigned as leader of the Conservative Party immediately after the election, but he remained in Parliament until he stood down in the 2001 election.\n\nAs Prime Minister, John Major engaged in the first real negotiations with Sinn Fein to bring about peace in Northern Ireland and lay the groundwork for the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which ended the thirty years of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nMargaret Thatcher was born on October 13, 1925 in Grantham, England, the younger daughter of Alfred and Beatrice Roberts. Her father was a greengrocer and respected town leader, serving as lay-leader with their church, city-alderman and then as mayor. He taught Margaret never to do things because other people are doing them; do what you think is right and persuade others to follow you.\n\nShe attended Oxford University from 1943 to 1947 and earned a degree in Chemistry, but it was clear from early on that politics was her true calling. She stood as a Conservative candidate from Dartford in the 1950 and 1951 elections. She married Denis Thatcher in December 1951 and they had twin children, Mark Thatcher and Carol Thatcher. She practiced tax law for a time in the 1950s, but was elected to Parliament from Finchley in 1959. Two years later, she was appointed to the cabinet as Minister of Pensions. In 1970, she was appointed Minister for Education and earned the title \"Thatcher the Milk Snatcher\", for eliminating free milk for schoolchildren in a round of budget-cutting. After the Conservative Party lost both general elections in 1974, she defeated Edward Heath for the leadership of the party.\n\nShe was elected Prime Minister in May 1979 and served for eleven and a half years, longer than any other British Prime Minister in the 20th Century. As Prime Minister, she was staunchly capitalist and bent on wiping socialism from the face of Britain. During her tenure, she cut direct taxes, spending and regulations, privatized state-industries and state-housing, reformed the education, health and welfare systems, was tough on crime and espoused traditional values. Her time in office was eventful, having to contend with an economic recession, inner-city riots and a miners' strike.\n\nHer first great triumph in office was the Falklands War in 1982, when she sent British troops to reclaim British possessions off the coast of South America that had been invaded and occupied by Argentina. The British won that war and it showed the world that Britain was once again a power to be reckoned with. Her time in office saw unprecedented economic prosperity among the middle and upper classes, but this was contrasted by unemployment levels not seen since the 1930s, a rise in homelessness and the end of Britain's major industries. She was a staunch political ally of Republican American President Ronald Reagan. They both advocated tough foreign and defence policies, but they also developed a constructive relationship with reforming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev which helped to bring the Cold War to an end. Thatcher also persuaded President George Bush to send troops to Saudi Arabia right after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990.\n\nHer staunch advocacy of the Poll Tax and her refusal to endorse a common currency for Europe led the Conservative party to force her out of office in a bloody internal coup. She was forced to resign as Prime Minister in November 1990. Since she left office, she was introduced to the House of Lords in 1992 as Baroness Thatcher. She travelled the world, touring the lecture circuit promoting her causes and was president of numerous organizations dedicated to her causes. In the last few years, her health suffered and she no longer spoke in public.\n\nJim Callaghan was born on 27th March 1912 in Portsmouth, Hampshire, to a Catholic father and Baptist mother. He was the only son and younger of 2 children. His father was a Royal Navy Chief Petty Officer of Irish ancestry, who died when Callaghan was aged 9. His father died when he was 9, plunging the family into poverty. They received no pension until Labour came into office in 1931 and paid the Callaghans a weekly pension of 10 shillings (then worth about $2).\n\nHe had an unspectacular education at Portsmouth Northern Secondary School, and left at 16 to work as a clerk for the Inland Revenue and became involved with the union (Staff Federation). He later met Harold Laski, the Chair of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee. Laski encouraged him to stand for Parliament. Callaghan served in the Royal Navy Patrol Service in World War II from 1943, but while on leave he was able to get selected as a Parliamentary candidate for Cardiff South, later Cardiff South East. He won the seat in the 1945 UK general election. He rose steadily through the party in Opposition, and stood for the leadership after Gaitskell's death in 1963.\n\nIn 1964 as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he decided not to devalue the pound, which proved to be a disastrous decision. He was forced to do so three years later and felt obliged to resign as Chancellor and became Home Secretary, where he was able to partially restore his reputation. During this time there was worsening violence in Northern Ireland and in 1969 he sent troops to the province, initially to protect the Catholic minority.\n\nIn Opposition Callaghan became Shadow Foreign Secretary, and in government after 1974 it was his job to renegotiate the terms of Britains EC membership. When Harold Wilson resigned unexpectedly, Callaghan was not the favourite to win the leadership, being the oldest candidate at 64. However, he was the least divisive candidate, and won the vote.\n\nHe was Prime Minister from 1976 to 1979. As a PM he presided over a sterling crisis, which led to negotiations with the IMF for a rescue package. However, problems became more difficult when Labour lost its overall small majority in 1977, following a succession of by-election defeats. They became dependent on the support of the Liberals to survive. However, Callaghan persevered in office even when this pact broke down.\n\nDuring the 'Winter of Discontent' in 1978, industrial action over pay policy severely damaged the governments authority. Following a loss of a confidence motion on 28 March 1979 by just one vote, Callaghan was obliged to hold a general election, which was won by Margaret Thatcher 's Conservative Party. He resigned as leader of the Labour party in September 1980, shortly after the 1980 party conference.\n\nIn 1983, he became Father of the House as the longest continuously serving member of the Commons and one of only two survivors of the 1945 general election. The other one was Michael Foot , who, however, had been out of the House from 1955 to 1960. Callaghan remained an MP until the 1987 general election when he retired after forty-two years as a member of the Commons. The same year, he was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Callaghan of Cardiff.\n\nIn 1988 his wife Audrey spotted a letter to a newspaper which pointed out that the copyright of Peter Pan was about to expire. Callaghan moved an amendment to the Copyright Bill then under consideration in the Lords to extend it permanently, and this was accepted by the government. (Royalties from Peter Pan go to the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital)\n\nHe was married for 67 years to Audrey Elizabeth Moulton. They had a son and two daughters. Margaret, born in 1940, became Baroness Jay of Paddington and was Leader of the House of Lords from 1998 to 2001. Julia was born in 1943 and Michael in 1946.\n\nHe died at his farm in Ringmer, East Sussex on 26 March 2005 on the eve of his 93rd birthday and just 11 days after the death of his wife Audrey.\n\nEdward Heath was born in 1916 in Broadstairs, Kent. His father was a carpenter, his mother was a maid and his background was very modest. He attended Balliol College at Oxford, where he earned a second-class degree in philosophy, politics and economics. He got active in Conservative Party politics while at Oxford, but opposed Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement.\n\nHe served in the military during World War II, in the Royal Artillery. After the war, he entered the Civil Service in the Ministry of Aviation. In 1950, he was elected Conservative MP for Bexley. He would represent that constituency for more than fifty years. His rise through the ranks was rapid, being appointed a junior whip in 1951 and was promoted to Chief Whip in 1955. He was appointed Minister of Labour in 1959. He was also appointed Lord Privy Seal in 1960 and President of the Board of Trade in 1963.\n\nThe Conservative Party lost the 1964 election and its leader, Alec Douglas Home, stepped down shortly thereafter, but not after changing the leadership election rules, which made it easier for the rank and file to win the leadership. Edward Heath was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1965, being the first commoner to lead the party. Edward Heath then went on to unexpectedly win the 1970 General Election for the Conservative Party on the 'Selsdon Platform', calling for more aggressive pro-growth economic policies.\n\nEdward Heath's tenure as Prime Minister was very turbulent. His main accomplishment was to admit Britain into the European Community, which it joined in 1973. That was about his only major accomplishment as Prime Minister. The rest of Heath's time in office was not so happy. His Chancellor of the Exchequer, Iain McLeod, died within a month of winning the election and his successor, Tony Barber, was not nearly as capable. His Minister for Education, Margaret Thatcher, proved extremely capable, but attracted controversy when she abolished free milk in the schools, earning her the name 'Margaret Thatcher, the Milk Snatcher.'\n\nEdward Heath's efforts to tame the power of trade unions did not match the rhetoric. The Industrial Relations Act did not deliver on its promises to curb trade union abuses. Northern Ireland was a source of continuing trouble. British soldiers fired on unarmed civilians in the Londonderry Massacre in 1972. The violence and disorder in Northern Ireland got so bad that Heath was forced to suspend the local government there and impose direct rule from London.\n\nBack in Britain, the government caved before a miner's strike in 1972, after especially violent clashes between striking miners and police at Saltley Coke Depot; the police were withdrawn 'for their own protection' but it was a victory for the Miners' Union and thereafter, they had the power to make or break governments in Britain. Britain, like the rest of the Western World, was badly affected by the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, but Britain was especially hard-hit as the miners struck again. Heath put the country on a three-day workweek to conserve energy, and break the will of striking miners. This backfired and hurt Heath's government more.\n\nIn early 1974, Heath called an election on the question of 'Who Governs Britain?' The electorate had lost confidence in Heath and it showed. The election of February 1974 was inconclusive. The Conservative Party lost its majority in Parliament. The Labour Party won the most seats, but not a majority--therefore, it could not really form a government. But Ted Heath was no longer Prime Minister and he handed power over to Harold Wilson in March 1974. Because the result of the February 1974 election was so inconclusive, another election was soon called for October.\n\nLabour won the October 1974 election by a tiny majority. This did not make Heath look good; he had lost three out of four elections. The mood of the Conservative Party was intense rage. Yet none of the Conservative Party establishment dared to cross him. However, Margaret Thatcher, his Minister of Education did challenge Heath for the party leadership in the next party election. On February 4, 1975, she defeated him in the party leadership election. Heath won only 119 votes to Margaret Thatcher's 130, but he had lost his grip on the party. He resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party on February 11, 1975, having handed it over to Margaret Thatcher.\n\nFrom that point on, Heath refused to serve in the Shadow Cabinet or the front benches. Heath never recovered from his defeat, settling for being a glowering presence on the back benches of Parliament. He remained in Parliament for another twenty-five years. In late-1990, he flew to Iraq in an effort to bring about a diplomatic solution to the Invasion of Kuwait and met with Saddam Hussein; he was unable to persuade Saddam Hussein to pull out of Kuwait, though he did return home with a handful of British hostages.\n\nIn 1992, Edward Heath became the longest-serving MP in Parliament and thus became Father of the House, a position he held until he retired from Parliament in 2001 at the ripe old age of 85. Edward Heath was a lifelong bachelor. He never married. Politics was his main interest, but he had other hobbies which included sailing yachts and music. His favorite instruments to play were the piano and the organ. Edward Heath died at age 89 in 2005.\n\nBorn in Blenheim Palace, the residence of his grandfather, the 7th Duke of Marlborough. His father was the Duke's third son, Lord Randolph Churchill. His mother, Jennie Jerome, was the daughter of an American financier.\n\nAfter passing through famous English public schools such as Harrow, he went on to fulfill his ambition for a life in the army. He fought in various parts of the British Empire until in 1900 when he won the Conservative seat in Oldham in the general election. From here until 1929 he held various offices in British Parliament.\n\nThe 1930s saw fascism grow in strength throughout Europe with dictators such as Italy's Benito Mussolini, Germany's Adolf Hitler and Spain's Francisco Franco. When the UK and France declared war on Germany in 1939, Neville Chamberlain was British Prime Minister. On May 10, 1940 Hitler's forces invaded Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg in order to invade France. Chamberlain was widely blamed for the failed British invasion of Norway, although realistically Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty was largely to blame for the failure of the Norwegian Campaign. Chamberlain recommended the King should ask Churchill to succeed him as Prime Minister. He made a speech on 13 May: \"You ask: 'What is our policy?' I will say: 'It is to wage war by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us: to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalog of human crime.' That is our policy. You ask: 'What is our aim?' I can answer in one word: 'Victory! Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival.'\"\n\nThe United States officially entered the war after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The US's participation was excellent news to Churchill and after success on D-Day and as the Nazi forces were gradually forced back, the war in Europe gradually drew to a close. He lost the 1945 General Election by a landslide, lost again in 1950, but was re-elected as Prime Minister in 1951 despite receiving fewer votes than Labour. Due to deteriorating health he retired in 1955. He died at Hyde Park Gate, London, on January 24, 1965 at the age of 90. He had succeeded in the uniting of thought and deed. He had succeeded in uniting everyone in the common purpose, inspiring them with fortitude and strength to face whatever hardships that would have to be incurred in the process of first surviving and ultimately winning the war. His daughter Mary wrote to him on his death bed: \"I owe you what every Englishman, woman, and child owes you - liberty itself.\"\n\nAs one of the most significant British politicians of the 20th century, Churchill remains one of the country's most widely recognized figures. He has been played by an almost incalculable number of actors on screen, but three of the most notable and acclaimed screen portrayals were by Robert Hardy in Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981) (which covers Churchill's life from 1929 to 1939), Albert Finney in Churchill - The Gathering Storm (2002) (also set in the 1930s before he became Prime Minister) and Gary Oldman in Die dunkelste Stunde (2017) (set in May 1940).\n\nAs well as a politician, Churchill was also an author and a prolific artist, who painted over 500 canvases, exhibited at the Royal Academy and at Paris, and sold paintings."
