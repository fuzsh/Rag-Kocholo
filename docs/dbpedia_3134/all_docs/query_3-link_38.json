The Ist Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel G. H. Soames) of the 18th Infantry Brigade, 6th Division, held front line trenches in the Cambrai sector, just south of the La Bassée Canal, at this period a comparatively quiet part of the line. The 2nd Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel J. L. Jack) was undergoing an uncomfortable existence in Priez Farm, just west of Rancourt, in support of the front line units of the 23rd Infantry Brigade, 8th Division. The Division had but recently relieved the 4th Division and the condition of the sector is thus described by an officer of the 1st Somerset Light Infantry, which battalion had handed over its “‘ trenches ” to the 2nd Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment :—‘‘ The conditions beggar description, the trenches are flooded and have fallen in. There is no cover either in front, support or reserve lines, and men are being evacuated sick with frost-bite and exhaustion by the hundred. To-day four men were dug out of the mud who had been unable to move for three\n\ndays. The conditions were so bad that we were unable to see the actual\n\nThe four battalions of the Regiment which formed the 146th Infantry Brigade, 49th Division, were located : 1/5th (Lieut.-Colonel H. D. Bousfield) and 1/7th (Lieut.-Colonel C. H. Tetley) at Bouque Maison; the 1/6th (Lieut.-Colonel W. A. Wistance), 1/8th (Lieut.- Colonel J. W. Alexander) at Le Souich. The goth Division was then out of the front line, training and reorganising. The 9th Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel F. P. Worsley) of the 32nd Infantry Brigade, 11th Division, occupied reserve dug-outs amidst the mud and horrible surroundings of Beaumont Hamel, whilst the 1oth Battalion (Lieut.- Colonel P. R. Simner) was in Camp No. 22, Carnoy with other units of the soth Infantry Brigade, in 17th Divisional Reserve. The\n\nB 1\n\n2 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\n11th West Yorkshires (Lieut.-Colonel M. C. H. Barker), 69th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Division, were at Ypres in the Hospice, supplying working parties whilst not in the front line. The 12th Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel R. C. Smythe), in the oth Infantry Brigade, 3rd Division, was billeted in Louvencourt. The ‘“‘ Bantam” Battalion —the 17th (Lieut.-Colonel F. St. J. Atkinson), 105th Infantry Brigade, 35th Division, was at Ternas. The three West Yorkshire battalions of the 93rd Infantry Brigade, 31st Division, 7.e., the 15th (Lieut.-Colonel S. C. Taylor), the 16th (Lieut.-Colonel A. Croydon) and the 18th (Lieut.-Colonel H. F. G. Carter) were located in the Hébuterne area, in Authie, Couin and Hébuterne Keep—Sailly-au-Bois respectively. The Leeds and Bradford ‘“‘ Pals ” were engaged with the enemy early in the year (at Rossignol Wood, which action will be described later)\n\nthough they were relieved in the first line before the advance to the Hindenburg Line was completed. The 21st (Lieut.-Colonel Sir E. H. St. L. Clarke, commanding) the Pioneer Battalion, serving with the 4th Division, was at Maurepas, erecting camps and cutting tenches. The Division had been relieved by the 8th Division in the front line on 29th December, 1916, and on Ist January was located in Chipilly and neighbourhood. The 22nd (Labour) Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel J. S. Stewart) was still in the Somme area, one company at Mametz and three companies\n\nat Fricourt, chiefly engaged on road-making.\n\nFour more battalions of the Regiment, the (Lieut.-Colonel J. Josselyn), 2/6th (Lieut.- Colonel J. H. Hastings), 2/7th (Lieut.-Colonel Hon. F. S. Jackson) and 2/8th (Lieut.-Colonel W. Hepworth) left England for France between sth and 8th January. They formed the 185th Infantry Brigade (Brig.-General V. W. de Falbe) of the 62nd (W.R. Division— Major-General W.P Braithwaite). ‘These new arrivals were second line Territorial troops.\n\n1917\n\nTHE ADVANCE TO THE HINDENBURG LINE, 1917 Actions of Miraumont\n\nHE advance should not be confused with the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. Inthe former the Allies advanced in the face of fierce opposition from the enemy, while in the latter there was very little severe fighting, action being confined practically to rear-guard affairs. And yet the two operations cannot be entirely separated one from the other, for the German plan—the ‘“ Alberich Movement” as it was called by Ludendorff—was interrupted and the retirement actually began some days before it was due to begin; both French and British had discovered the enemy’s carefully guarded secret. The general situation in January, 1917, was by no means satisfactory either for the Allies or for the enemy. The French and British Armies were suffering from exhaustion after the Somme battles of 1916 and their condition was only a little better than that of the enemy, whose depleted ranks were indeed causing him grave concern. ““ The enemy’s strength,” said Sir Douglas Haig, ‘‘ had been considerably reduced by the severe and protracted struggle on the Somme battlefield, and so far as circumstances and the weather would permit, it was most desirable to allow him no respite during the winter.”” The Battle of the Ancre, 13th-18th November, 1916, was the outcome of this decision, and by the time bad weather put an end to offensive operations, valuable positions had been gained from which to begin the spring campaign of 1917. The principal gain was a footing on the Beaumont-Hamel spur, commanding ground which overlooked the Ancre and Beaucourt valleys, the possession of which was most desirable and necessary before any extensive advance could be made. The latter part of November and all December was spent in improving trenches and in repairing the roads and communications to them. Early in January, 1917, operations again became possible and a number of small attacks by the 3rd, 7th and 11th Divisions were 7\n\nOTH BATTALION. 17TH JAN.\n\n20TH FEs.\n\n8 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\ncarried out with the object of securing the remainder of the Beau- mont-Hamel spur. On the 11th of the month the 7th Division attacked a system of hostile trenches extending for some 1,500 yards along the crest of the spur east and north-east of Beaumont-Hamel. The attack was completely successful and all objectives, together with over 200 prisoners, were captured, whilst the enemy’s counter- attack was broken up. The attack by the 11th Division was launched at 6-35 a.m. on the 17th January, the 9th West Yorkshires supporting the 6th York and Lancaster Regiment and the 6th Yorkshire Regiment. The point of attack was the enemy’s trench system just north of Beau- court, dug amidst sunken roads, and in every way difficult to get at. The 9th West Yorkshires apparently did little fighting: ‘‘ Left sector was ordered to advance its line, taking some German dug-outs around Artillery Alley and Puisieux Road and establish posts at heads of long banks in R.1.d. Attack commenced at 6-35 a.m. The battalion being in support .. . all objectives were taken and consolidated, no counter-attack was made by Germans.” The battalion, however, did splendid work in supplying carrying parties. On the 18th the 32nd Infantry Brigade was relieved by a brigade of the 63rd Division and left the Beaumont sector without any regrets whatsoever, the 9th West Yorkshires finding themselves successively in Rubempre, Berneuil and Domléger ; in the latter place the battalion remained until 20th February. The possession of the Beaumont-Hamel spur gave splendid scope for artillery action. The whole of the Beaucourt valley and the western slopes of the spur beyond from opposite Grandcourt to Serre, hitherto hidden from the British gunners, now lay exposed. Accordingly the guns got to work as quickly as possible, the infantry advancing to clear the remainder of the valley south of the Serre Hill. On the night of the 3rd/4th February an important section (a front of about three-quarters of a mile) of the enemy’s original second line system north of the Ancre was captured by the 63rd Division. The enemy’s hold on Grandcourt, and his more western defences south of the river, were now very precarious. On the 6th February he evacuated the latter and the same night withdrew from Grandcourt, which was occupied by the 63rd Division. On the night of the 7th, Baillescourt Farm, half-way between Beaucourt and Miraumont, was captured. On the 9th February the Germans began the devastation of the area occupied by them between Soissons and Arras. Under\n\n1917 ** It was necessary to shorten our Front ”’ 9\n\nthe rubric ‘“‘ Alberich ” the “‘ Army of the Crown Prince Rupprecht ” said Ludendorff, ‘“‘ had made out a programme for the work of clearance and demolition, which was to spread over five weeks. If an attack on the part of the enemy made it necessary, we could at any moment interrupt this programme and begin our retreat. Our first object was to avoid a battle, the second to effect the salvage of all our raw material of war and technical and other equipment that was not actually built into the positions, and finally the destruction of all high roads, villages, towns and wells, so as to prevent the enemy establishing himself in force in the near future in front of our position.” The German retreat in 1917 was one of the results of the Battles of the Somme, 1916. The appalling losses sustained by the enemy in the Somme operations and the shaken moral of his troops had produced a situation of considerable gravity in the German Army. The enemy had been so terribly weakened by the terrific blows dealt him by the Allies that his line in places was held only by worn-out and exhausted divisions, and he was fearful lest the Somme battles should break out afresh. “ The general situation made it necessary for us to postpone the struggle in the west as long as possible in order to allow the submarine campaign time to produce decisive results.! Tactical reasons and a shortage of ammunition provided additional reasons for delay. At the same time it was necessary to shorten our front in order to secure a more favourable grouping of our forces and create large reserves. In France and Belgium we had 154 divisions facing 190 divisions, some of which were considerably stronger than In view of our extensive front this was an exceedingly un- favourable balance of forces.2 Moreover we had in certain sectors of our line to endeavour to avoid heavy enemy attacks as long as possible, by preventing our adversaries from concentrating strong forces in front of them. At the same time we secured positions in which weaker divisions, wearied by fighting, could be employed. These considerations, taken in close connection with the opening of the submarine campaign, led to the decision to straighten our front by withdrawing to the Siegfried (Hindenburg) Line, which was to be in a state of defence by the beginning of March,\n\n1 The German submarine-cruiser ca mmpaign opened on ist February, 1917, and its immediate result was the breaking off, on the 3rd ebruary,, of diplomatic relations between the United States of America and Germany on account of the ‘‘ unrestricted submarine warfare.”\n\n2 And many considerably weaker. 3 The statement of the ‘' balance of forces’ must be received with caution.\n\n10TH—11TH FEBRUARY.\n\n10 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\nand methodically to carry on the work of demolition over an area of fifteen kilometres in breadth in front of our position... The decision to retreat was not reached without a painful struggle. It implied a confession of weakness, bound to raise the moral of the enemy and lower our own. But as it was necessary for military reasons, we had no choice ; it had to be carried out. On February 4th the order was given to carry out ‘ Alberich’ according to plan. The first ‘ Alberich ’ began on February 9th. The retreat was to\n\nbegin on March 16th, but under enemy pressure might start at any earlier Thus, Ludendorff ! On the night of the roth/11th February the enemy was driven out of 1,500 yards of a strong line of trenches on the southern foot of Serre Hill, only the strong points (which held out for a few days longer) remaining in the hands of the enemy. The attack was carried out by the 32nd Division. Three enemy counter-attacks were broken up and were entirely unsuccessful. It was in this sector (Beaumont-Hamel) and about this period that four more battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment came into\n\n2/sTH, 2/6TH the line of battle. They were the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/8th\n\n2/7TH, 2/8TH BATTALIONS.\n\nBattalions, constituting the 185th Infantry Brigade of the 62nd (W.R.) Division. The West Riding Division landed in France in the beginning of January and for a month had received instructions in trench warfare and active service conditions generally, in the front line, support and reserve sectors held by the 19th and 32nd Divisions. They were keen soldiers, these men of the West Riding of Yorkshire, who since 1914 had been training in England and getting ready for service overseas. The 62nd Division was a second line Territorial Division, the first line Division being the 49th, which contained the four Territorial battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment, 1.e., the 1/5th, 1/6th, 1/7th and 1/8th. The arrival in France of the four West Yorkshire battalions of the 62nd (W.R.) Division brought the number of battalions of the Regiment serving overseas in a theatre of war up to twenty. To meet the wishes of French G.H.Q., Sir Douglas Haig, early in January, had begun to extend his right flank from a line drawn between the villages of Lesboeufs and Le Transloy, as far south as a point about five miles west of Roye. By the 26th February the new line had been taken over completely and the British divisions\n\n1 It is perfectly obvious that the retreat did begin before the 16th March; it had begun before February was out.\n\n1917 “ Alberich” Plans Interrupted II\n\nwere hard at work improving and making more habitable the wretchedly inadequate trenches into which they had marched.' That the enemy was unable to carry out his “ Alberich ”’ pro- gramme without a good deal of interference is obvious from the number of attacks of a local nature which took place before the retreat to the Hindenburg Line. And in these local attacks several battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment were concerned. On the night of 8th February, two companies (“ B’’ and **D’’) of 10TH the roth West Yorkshires had acted as “ carrying parties” in an attack pA; yn made by the 7th Yorkshire Regiment of the soth Infantry Brigade, 17th Division, on the enemy’s trenches just east of Sailly-Saillisel. The attack was completely successful, and the Yorkshire battalion was later relieved by the West Yorkshires—the companies of the latter being disposed as follows: ‘“‘C”? Company in Green Howard Trench : “A” Company, Old Front Line: ‘“ D” Company in Cane Alley (three platoons): ‘“‘ B”’ Company, Chateau and ‘“‘ strong points. The relief took place on the oth. Now, although the enemy’s front-line divisions had received orders not to engage in actions involving the employment of large numbers of men, they obviously had to maintain their forward positions until the area behind the lines had been cleared and devastated as laid down in “ Alberich,” and the new formidable position—the Hindenburg Line—completed. At this period, also, the German was a good enough soldier to resent the continued grabbing by his opponents of a little bit here and a little bit there of his front line trenches ; and as a consequence counter-attacks were not infrequent. At I-1§ a.m. on the morning of the 1oth February, the enemy put down a very heavy barrage on the front and support lines and the strong points taken over by the West Yorkshiremen from the 7th Yorkshire Regiment. The back areas were also violently shelled. For three-quarters of an hour all positions occupied by the West Yorkshiremen and the supporting troops, were deluged by a constant stream of shells of all calibres. Simultaneously, bombing attacks against both flanks of Green Howard Trench—the new position held by ““C”” Company—were launched by the enemy. But all his attempts to reach the trench were frustrated and he was met by such a torrent of bombs and rifle grenades and streams of bullets from rifle, machine- gun and Lewis gun that he retired to his own trenches, having\n\n1” This alteration entailed the maintenance by British forces of an exceptionally active front of 110 miles, including the whole of the Somme battle front.\"\"—Official Despatches.\n\n12 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War I9I7\n\naccomplished nothing. A bombing attack against the centre of Green Howard Trench met with similar results. The hostile bombardment had completely severed communication with British Headquarters, and the artillery and the West Yorkshires were entirely without means of signalling their distress. Lamp signalling had been tried but had failed to attract notice. So the gallant fellows stuck it out. Towards morning the enemy again opened fire, shelling the battalion’s right. Several of his shells, however, fell short into his own trenches. When this occurred it was noticed that the enemy’s troops sent up a single red light. This information was valuable, for on occupying the position the West Yorkshires had found in an old German dug-out several of these red flares. When, therefore, the enemy shelled the West Yorkshiremen, the latter promptly sent up a red light and the hostile shelling ceased immediately. On the 11th the battalion was relieved and marched back to Combles, in Brigade Reserve, having lost six other ranks killed, four died of wounds and twenty-four wounded during the tour.! Terribly hard was life in the front line sectors, and the mud and filth of the trenches were truly awful. Violent shell-fire blew in dug-outs and demolished shelters. Tours in the trenches lasted only 48 hours, yet in that short period the average number of casualties was from thirty to forty. Although it was poor satis- faction, the troops were heartened by the knowledge that the enemy was in no happier condition and that his casualties were not less heavy. By the middle of February, Serre formed a very prominent salient in the enemy’s line, and any further advance along the Ancre valley would render the retention of the village almost impossible. Accordingly, operations were begun which, if successful, would carry the British line forward along the spur running northwards from the main Morval-Thiepval Ridge above and gain possession of the high ground which not only commands the approaches to Pys and Miraumont, but affords observation over the upper valley of the Ancre, in which many hostile batteries were situated, defending the Serre sector. Arrangements were also made for a smaller attack along the northern bank of the river with the object of securing the approaches to Miraumont from the west. These attacks were entrusted to the 2nd, 18th and 63rd Divisions\n\n1 After this action the roth West Yorkshires were not engaged again in the advance to, or German retreat to, the Hindenburg Line. ‘The battalion, with its Brigade and Division, moved in stages to the neighbourhood (and west) of Arras.\n\n1917 ** A Horrible and Loathsome Place” 13\n\n(in the orders given from right to left) and were delivered simul- taneously at 5-45 a.m. on the morning of the 17th February.! Into all the details of the attack it is not possible to go, but south of the river guns were run to within a few hundred yards of Petit Miraumont, whilst along the northern banks of the Ancre complete success was obtained and several counter-attacks, delivered by considerable enemy forces, were completely broken up. On the left flank of the 63rd Division, the 62nd (W.R.) Division 2/5Tn, 2/6TH had begun the relief of the 32nd Division on the 13th February, 2/ 7TH, 2/8TH three battalions (2/5th, 2/6th and 2/7th West Yorkshires) of the , Fee. four forming the 185th Infantry Brigade, having taken over the line held by the 97th Infantry Brigade ; the 2/8th West Yorkshires were in Brigade Reserve. The 2/5th Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel J. Josselyn) had two companies in Ten Tree Alley, one in Lager Alley and one in Munich Trench ; this was the right sub-sector. The 2/6th Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel J. Hastings) held the left sub-sector, with one company in Ten Tree Alley and the Axle Group of posts, in support, one in Wagon Road in support, and two companies in reserve. The 2/7th Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel Hon. F. S. Jackson) was in the centre sub-sector, two companies holding the front line, one in support and one in reserve. The 2/8th Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel W. Hepworth) was in Y Ravine, in Brigade Reserve. The Beaumont-Hamel sector, which this newly-arrived West Riding Division had taken over, was little more than a line of posts and shell-holes situated in the midst of slough and quagmire which beggars description. The continual heavy shelling to which the line had been subjected had reduced the trenches to a state which can only be described as appalling. A few weeks previously Ten Tree Alley, Lager Alley and Munich Trench, had indeed some semblance to properly constructed defences, but when the West Yorkshires moved into them they were battered and broken, filthy with viscous mud, gaping pools of dirty and evil-smelling water and pock-marked with huge shell-holes. A horrible and loathsome place in which to live and fight. Ration parties and reliefs often failed to find those whom they sought to feed or relieve. At all times of the day and night the enemy’s guns kept the sector under heavy shell-fire ; snipers pursued their activities with intrepidity and at first with loss and annoyance to the West York- Shires ; machine-guns swept the area and trench-mortar bombs fell\n\n1 The official title of these attacks is ‘‘ The Actions of Miraumont, 17th and 18th February \"\n\n2°§TH, 2/6TH 2/7TH, 2/8TH BATTALIONS. 17TH FEB.\n\n14 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\nin and about the shell-hole posts, churning up the already rudely disturbed earth.! In taking over the line from the 97th Brigade several casualties were suffered by the 185th Infantry Brigade. The 2/5th West Yorkshires lost four other ranks killed and eighteen wounded ; the 26th Battalion five wounded and the 2/7th Battalion one other rank killed and one wounded. The first officer casualty in the 185th Brigade was Capt. Nevitt of the 2/8th West Yorkshires, wounded on 15th whilst with a working party in Station Road. On the 17th the four West Yorkshire battalions had forty casualties killed, wounded and missing. But fortunately the line soon ceased to be stationary, and troops of the 62nd (W.R.) Division were a few days later in Miraumont and the neighbourhood. The 185th Infantry Brigade (less 2/6th West Yorkshires) was relieved on the night 20th/21st February and moved back in Divisional Reserve. The men had had a terrible time. In less than a week and without being engaged in active operations, the West York- shiremen had suffered three officers wounded, thirty-eight other ranks killed, 110 wounded and six missing. On the night of the 19th ‘20th Major F. A. Lupton and one other rank, both of the 2/8th West Yorkshires, went out to look for a post and were not heard of again until Major Lupton’s body was found some days later. Lieut.-Colonel W. Hepworth relinquished command of the 2/8th West Yorkshires on 22nd, being physically unable to stand the severity of winter conditions. He was succeeded by Major R. E. Negus of the North Staffordshire Regiment. Meanwhile the enemy was gradually being forced to evacuate his forward positions. Pys, Miraumont and Serre were evacuated by him, patrols entering the third village on 24th Febuary without encountering resistance. By the evening of the 25th, the enemy’s front system of defence from north of Gueudecourt to Eaucourt, Pys, Miraumont, Beauregard, Dovecot and Serre, had fallen into British hands. At this period the 187th Infantry Brigade of the 62nd Division held the front line, with the 186th in support and 185th in reserve. For two days the 187th Infantry Brigade felt its way cautiously\n\n1 Extract from Infantry Brigade Diary, 16th February, 1917: ‘' B.G.C. and B.M. visited battalions in the line.

Gudgeon Trench and Orchard Alley were occupied and an advance on Puisieux had been begun when, on the 27th, the 185th Infantry Brigade again came into the front line (right sub-sector), relieving the 190th Infantry Brigade of the 63rd Division, whilst the 186th Brigade relieved the 187th in the left sub-sector. On the 28th 28rx Fas. February, at 11-10 a.m., both the 185th and 186th Infantry Brigades reported Puisieux “in our hands.” It is necessary, however, to look north and south of the West Riding Division, up and down the British line, where other battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment had, with their divisions, been playing their part in this great act of the war drama. Whilst the advance on the southern flank of the Gommecourt Salient was in progress, several battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment were in and out of the trenches north and south of Gomme- court village. North, the four battalions of the 146th Infantry Brigade (49th '/STH. 1/ 6TH Division), i.e., 1/5th, 1/6th, 1/7th and 1/8th West Yorkshires had none” relieved the 21st Brigade (30th Division) in the Ransart sector, on a 11TH Fes. two-battalion front. Little happened during the remainder of January, and it was not until 11th February that any item of interest is mentioned in the records. On this date, however, the diary of the 1/8th Battalion reports a raid on the enemy’s trenches carried out by the battalion, in order to obtain an identification. It was unsuccessful. A week later (on the 19th) the 146th Brigade was relieved and by the end of February the 49th Division had returned to its old sector of 1915—Fauquissart.\n\nJust south of Gommecourt, in the Hébuterne sector, the 15th, 15TH, 16TH, 16th and 18th Battalions West Yorkshire Regiment (93rd Infantry\n\nBrigade, 31st Division) having been relieved by the 92nd Infantry BATTALIONS. Brigade on 2nd January and having spent just over a month out of the front line in the Doullens and Bernaville areas, came back again on the 21st February, the 15th Battalion taking over reserve position 2'St Fes. in Bayencourt, the 16th Battalion the right sub-sector (L.3) and the 18th Battalion the left sub-sector (L.4.). On the 22nd, numerous fires broke out in different parts of the enemy’s line ; the Germans were burning their dug-outs preparatory to the retirement. This, however, was not known to the West Yorkshires until a few days later. Active patrolling had begun on the Brigade taking over the front\n\nline, the enemy’s wire being closely watched.

Company Commanders were summoned immediately to Battalion Headquarters and two platoons each of “* C’’? Company (right) and ** A’? Company (left), supported by two platoons each of “ B” and ** D”’ Companies were ordered to “‘ go over” at § a.m. on the 25th and enter the enemy’s trenches. If the latter were successful, patrols were to be pushed forward to “ act with vigour.” The 16th West Yorkshires were also ordered to send out patrols into the enemy’s line. The two patrols of the 18th Battalion got across ‘“‘ No Man’s Land” without incident and entered Gommecourt Park. Here Opposition was encountered, and after a severe bombing fight in which both sides suffered casualties, the West Yorkshiremen with- drew to their own trenches, having established the fact that the enemy’s forward positions were but lightly held. At 2 p.m. the 18th West Yorkshires were relieved by the 18th Battalion Durham Light Infantry. The patrols sent out by the 16th Battalion also entered the German trenches, encountering only five of the enemy, who were speedily driven off. A post was established and consolidated in the German front line about 100 yards north of the Hébuterne-Bucquoy Road, but later, under instructions, was evacuated: the reason is not given. The 15th West Yorkshires then relieved the 16th Battalion, which marched back to Bayencourt. During the early morning of the 25th, ‘““C” Company of the 15th Battalion entered the German first line without opposition, and several hours later occupied the second and third lines. On the 26th, ‘‘ D ’’ Company of the battalion pushed out posts into the 4th German line. On the night of the 26th/27th the 16th West Yorkshires marched back again into the front line, t.e., the Hébuterne sector. The battalion had been detailed to carry out an attack on Rossignol Wood at 6-30 a.m. on the 27th. The attack was carried out on a two-company front with the two remaining companies in support. The leading companies, as ordered, were clear of the line of posts which had been formed along the Gommecourt-Puisieux road by 6-30 a.m. The right company reached the southern edge and entered by the trenches. A desperate struggle now ensued. The wood was a maze of trenches,\n\n1917 Rossignol Wood 17\n\nin fact a very strong system which stretched from Puisieux to Gomme- court. The trenches which the right company had entered were subjected to a very heavy enfilade machine-gun fire and very soon the whole of three platoons were killed or wounded. The fourth platoon, however, took cover in shell-holes just west of the Wood, where it remained all day, rejoining its battalion at night. The Company Commander and the Second-in-Command were both missing, the platoon commanders were wounded, and one managed to crawl out of the wood when darkness had fallen and reported at Battalion Headquarters at 10 p.m. Meanwhile, the left company had met with better luck. Having cleared the old German third line about 5-20 a.m., it deployed in No Man’s Land, and, preceded by scouts well in advance, reached the Puisieux-Gommecourt road without incurring heavy casualties. The Company Commander then sent one platoon up towards Pioneer Graben to occupy the high ground in the neighbourhood. But on reaching the trench the platoon was counter-attacked and driven back towards the Crucifix. A bombing party was then sent forward and succeeded in killing one and wounding several of the Germans, driving the remainder back 150 yards. The bombers then established blocks in Moltke Graben and Pioneer Graben and a bombing post at the junction of these two trenches. The remainder of the left company then advanced, several men entering Rossignol Wood, but the majority dug themselves in in Stump Alley and Pioneer Graben, south-west of the Crucifix. Two platoons from the reserve companies of the battalion were then sent forward and these assisted in consolidating the position won. The left company was shelled all day (it had indeed been under continuous fire from about 6 a.m.) but gallantly hung on to its position until relieved at night. On the 28th, the 18th West Yorkshires relieved the 15th Bat- talion in forward positions and the 18th Durham Light Infantry took over the line occupied by the 16th Battalion. At the conclusion of the above operations the line of the 93rd Infantry Brigade followed approximately the Gommecourt-Puisieux road from a point about 200 yards south-west of Gommecourt cemetery to a point about 100 yards south of the south-west corner of Rossignol Wood.! On the 28th also, Puisieux was reported in the hands of the British.

The capture of Rossignol Wood and the enemy’s trenches in the immediate neighbourhood was therefore the next step forward. The Wood, the trench system in the vicinity and Garde Stellung were vigorously shelled by the Divisional Artillery, to which the enemy replied with equal vigour, and life in the front line became horrible. The trenches were by this time appalling and deep in mud, tumbled and blown about by shells and trench-mortar bombs, and it was fortunate that an advance, though of a piece-meal nature, was in progress. The enemy’s wire still presented formidable obstacles, even though the guns pounded it regularly from morning till night. An attack by the Durham Light Infantry, which should have taken place on 2nd March, had to be postponed owing to the hostile wire-entanglement being insufficiently cut. On this date both the 15th and 16th West Yorkshires were relieved, the former marching off to billets in Coigneux and the latter to Magnolia Camp. The 18th Battalion was still in the line, and in conjunction with the Durhams, attacked the enemy on the 3rd March. The latter battalion, at dawn, under cover of a magnificent barrage, attacked and captured the 1st and 2nd Garde Stellung, the troops keeping so close to the barrage that they were in the German trenches before the enemy could get out of his dug-outs. The 18th West Yorkshires attacked Rossignol Wood with great gallantry, and although met by heavy rifle and machine-gun fire and the annoying activities of snipers, quickly broke down all opposition and established a line east of the wood. Nearly twenty prisoners were taken, and a Lewis gun which had been lost by the 16th West Yorkshires in their attack on Rossignol Wood a few days previously, was recaptured. The casualties of the battalion were slight. The 93rd Infantry Brigade had now obtained all its objectives. On the night 3rd/4th March the 18th West Yorkshires and Durham Light Infantry were relieved by the 13th York and Lancaster Regi- ment and 12th York and Lancaster Regiment respectively, the 94th Brigade thus completing the relief of the 93rd. Both battalions, on relief, marched back to Rossignol Farm, and so far as the three\n\n1917 Hard Conditions of the Advance 19\n\nWest Yorkshire Battalions (15th, 16th and 18th) of the 21st Division were concerned they had played their part in the advance to the Hindenburg Line, for at the end of March the 93rd Brigade (with the exception of the 16th West Yorkshires at Beuvry) was billeted in Béthune, attached to the XIth Corps in reserve to the 66th Division. Meanwhile, the 62nd Division (after the Actions of Miraumont 17th/18th February), had been steadily pushing its way forward. The four West Yorkshire battalions (185th Brigade) of the Division on the last day of February were holding the right sub-sector of the , , STH, 2/6TH Divisional front, with the 2/5th and 2/8th Battalions! in the front 2/7tH, 2/8TH line, 2/6th in reserve and 2/7th in support; the left Divisional BATTALIONS. sub-sector was held by the 186th Infantry Brigade. ane SEB.

Water was scarce in the front line and had to be carried up on pack mules ; in fact, pack transport was the only possible way of supplying the needs of the troops in the forward areas.

Moreover, the enemy, though obviously preparing for a general retirement (and was indeed retiring along certain parts of the front), still contested the advance of the 62nd Division and the Vth Corps. Although the official despatches stated that an extension of the British front as far northwards as a point opposite the town of Roye “* was decided on in January, 1917,” it is evident that the line had already begun to extend by the end of 1916. For during the evening of the 29th December the 23rd Infantry Brigade (8th Division) relieved a Brigade of the 4th Division in the La Priez Sector, some three or four miles south of the line Lesboeufs—Le Transloy, the old dividing line between the British and French fronts. This Le Priez sector, when the 8th Division took it over from 4th Division, consisted only of a line of posts both in the front and support lines with a short length of support trench known as Bar Support and a Reserve line. It was divided into two sub-sectors— ** Castor” on the right and “ Pollux ” on the left. The main feature of the sector was the ridge running from Rancourt to Sailly-Saillisel, the possession of which, on account of the observation it conferred, was of the greatest importance. At present it remained with the 8th Division, but it was such a valuable feature that attacks might be expected at any moment, as the St. Pierre Vaast Wood and the valley running up through it from Moislains provided covered lines of approach and places of assembly for an attack on the ridge. This was the front taken over by the 23rd Infantry Brigade, and on the Ist January the Diary of the 2nd Battalion, West Yorkshires, records (the battalion being then in Brigade support): “‘ A shell struck one of the ‘D’ Company’s shelters last night, killing five men and wounding three.”’ It was a bad beginning, but not surprising in a portion of the line which both sides desired to possess. At 3-15 p.m. on 2nd January the battalion moved off from Priez Farm at 100 yards intervals between platoons towards the front line in order to relieve the 2nd Devons. Keeping to the left of Priez Farm the march was by way of Frégicourt cross-roads, then by the Combles-Frégicourt road to the light railway (which ran south-east\n\n1 Major C. K.

Wire was put up and when relief came on 6th the line had been vastly improved. This tour proved the only period spent in the front line by the 2nd West Yorkshires during January, for after relief the battalion moved into camp at Maurepas, thence to Camps 111 and 112, Sailly- le-Sec, and Camp 117, Suzanne. The supply of working and fatigue parties and general training occupied the battalion until 31st of the month. On roth February the West Yorkshiremen marched back to Camp 112 and on the following day to Corbie, where the battalion billeted. On 19th and 20th February the battalion marched to Camps 117 and 17 respectively. On 21st the battalion moved in twenty-two motor lorries to the Crucifix near Maurepas, thence by march through Craniar to the front line, #.e., the northern sub-sector of the Buchavesnes sector. and “‘ C” Companies were in the front line and ‘‘ B” and ““D” Companies at Andover in dug-outs in reserve.

The battalion marched out of Linger Camp at 4 a.m., arriving at Asquith Flats at 5.15 a.m.—* Zero” hour for the attack. Here the West Yorkshiremen waited in support all day until 3-30 p.m., when they came under the orders of the G.O.C., 24th Brigade, and were ordered to move at once to Andover. From Andover the battalion went forward to Aldershot, arriving at the latter at 6-30 p.m. The attack of the 24th Brigade on Pallas and Fritz Trenches had been successful and at 7-15 p.m. the West Yorkshiremen were ordered to take over the latter trench and consolidate it. The strength of the 2nd West Yorkshires at this period had sunk very low: ‘‘ We were only 340 strong all ranks,” said the Battalion Diary, “‘ and therefore one company of the rst Sherwoods was left in Pallas Trench in support to the battalion.” The relief was not completed until 12-30 a.m. on 5th, but no sooner were the men in possession of the trench than they set to work to consolidate Fritz Trench, which had been captured by the 24th Brigade. There were, however, two short communication trenches leading to Bremen Trench, which was still held by the enemy. Both of these short trenches (one of which was Fritz Cut) had to be blocked. The whole area was called the Tirangle, and before it passed into the hands of the 24th Brigade desperate fighting had taken place. 2ND The West Yorkshiremen therefore worked hard in order to BATTALION. strengthen their position, out of which they expected the enemy would try to turn them.

On the 7th the Lincolns relieved the 2nd West Yorkshires, companies marching back to Albany Priez Farm, Asquith Flats and Hospital Wood.! Several days (from 8th to 11th inclusive) were spent by the battalion in a well-earned rest and in “ cleaning-up ”’ and training, during which Lieut.-Colonel J. L. Jack rejoined from hospital and assumed command. On the 12th all companies moved to Cranier for ‘‘ trench feet prevention,” and later at 4 p.m. marched off to relieve the 2nd Middlesex in the Rancourt sector, a miserable line of posts, wet and uncomfortable. Fortunately their stay here was of short duration, for two days later the enemy began to evacuate their trenches in front of St. Pierre Vaast Wood and moved back towards the Hinden- burg Line. Meanwhile, on the 26th February, another battalion of the\n\n12TH MARCH.\n\n17TH\n\nregiment, the 17th West Yorkshires (106th Brigade, 35th Division) BATTALION,\n\nhad moved into the Lihons sector of the line, immediately west of 7° Chaulnes, towards the southern extremity of the new front taken over a few hours previously from the French. The battalion had been out of the line for nearly two months, but during that period had been completely re-organised. Origin- ally the 17th West Yorkshires were one of the “‘ Bantam ”’ battalions, but it had been found that owing to the wastage of war it was im- possible to keep up the supply of reinforcements of the requisite standard, that many of the men were physically unfit, and complete re-organisation of all ‘“‘ Bantam ” units became necessary. The 106th Brigade Diary briefly summarises the change in the following words: ‘“ Ist-31st January: During this period the rejection of all units and men of the ‘ Bantam” standard was under- taken, drafts of full-sized men being received in their place.”” The drafts, when they arrived in France, were badly in need of training,\n\n1 As far as can be gathered the casualties of the 2nd West Yorkshires between 1st and ath March, 1917, were as follows; Officers—one killed, two wounded; other ranks—seven killed, fifty- four wounded, eleven missing.\n\nTH FEB.\n\n17TH BaTTALION. 3RD MARCH.\n\n14TH MARCH\n\n24 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War I9I7\n\nand thus a prolonged period out of the front line was necessary in order that the Division might train and re-organise thoroughly before it once more took over a front line sector. The 17th West Yorkshires left the Ternas Area on 6th February and, moving by marches and train journeys, reached Marcel Cave on 2oth, receiving orders on the following day to move to Caix, south of the Somme river, On 22nd. From Caix the battalion marched forward to the Camp de Ballon, occupying some old French wooden huts in a wood. In this camp the battalion remained until 11 a.m. on the 26th, when the West Yorkshiremen marched to Rosiéres, halting until dusk, but moving forward again at 5-30 p.m. up to the front line trenches in the Lihons sector. The battalion from A.15 a.7.5 on the right to A.4. ¢.2.0 on the left.! Shelling, sniping and trench-mortar activity, during the intervals of which work was done on the defences, occupied the battalion for several days. On the 3rd March, under cover of an intense artillery bom- bardment, the enemy raided the trenches of the West Yorkshiremen, the battalion’s casualties being one man killed, one wounded and five missing. Relief took place on the roth, when the battalion marched back to Rosiéres and billeted, where the next day (11th) was spent in giving the men a rest after the terrible condition of the trenches and in “‘cleaning-up.”’ On the 14th the battalion marched to Decauville Camp.\n\n' Ref: 66 (E) N.E., 66 (d) N.W.

Both dates are open to question, for as early as the 3rd March the enemy found it necessary to issue frequent reports of the ‘‘ success ” of his movements. One (bearing the date of the 3rd) stated: “‘ The fact that our move- ments have been universally successful during the last few days, and have cost us practically nothing, is due to the skill and bravery of our troops. Regimental historians will tell us in the future how delighted our officers and men were to return once again to open warfare.” The Germans (especially during the Great War) were never gifted with a sense of humour, and the “ delight ” of their soldiery having to retire from hard-won positions, soaked with the blocd of their comrades, is difficult to picture. Queer mentality that could find cause for jubilation in an enforced retirement ! Up to the 14th March, the enemy’s principal retirement appear to have taken place within the area hitherto referred to as the Gomme- court Salient, or along the front of the old British line, which ran from east of Lesboeufs to just south of Arras. But on and after that date the enemy seems to have retired from, or he made prepa- rations to evacuate, other parts of his line, south of Lesbeoufs. No less than ten battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment took part in the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line: 17th, 2nd, 2/sth, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/8th, from right to left. The 17th West Yorkshires (Lieut.-Colonel H. R. H. Drew) 1771 having arrived in Decauville Camp on 14th March, began prepara ~ tions for practising the assault, but at 10 p.m. on the night of 15th the battalion was ordered to relieve the 23rd Manchester Regiment of the 104th Brigade in the Chilly sector, on the night of 16th. The battalion, in motor lorries, left camp at 2-30 p.m. on the latter date and, on arriving at Vrely, there found guides waiting to conduct the relief parties to the front line. The relief appears to have been 25\n\n17TH BATTALION. 29TH MARCH.\n\n2ND BATTALION.\n\n14TH MARCH.\n\n26 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\ncarried out without incident, the West Yorkshiremen coming temporarily under the orders of the G.O.C., 1ro4th Brigade. Throughout the night of the 16th/17th March, red lights were observed burning in the enemy’s lines. They were not the ordinary flares which suddenly grew brilliant and then flickered out, but a steady red light, and they were seen all up and down the enemy’s line. They were German signals for the general retreat to the Hindenburg Line. The battalion pushed out patrols, and as a result of their reports the West Yorkshiremen, at 2-30 p.m. on 17th, entered the enemy’s front line which had been evacuated. An officers’ patrol worked south and entered Fransart, which was also found clear of the enemy. On 18th the battalion advanced to Mamelas Trench and later reached Hattencourt. The railway in front of the latter place had been destroyed, and the village bore unmistakeable signs of “the beast’’; the houses had been demolished and the place heavily wired and mined, and great care had to be taken not to fall into the enemy’s “‘ booby traps.” On the 19th, however, the battalion moved north to Hallu and rejoined its Brigade (106th). For several days now, the 17th West Yorkshires with other units of the Brigade, were engaged on the repair of roads in the neighbourhood of Hallu, from which area no move forward was made until 29th, when the 17th Battalion marched forward to Potte. Work on roads, the filling-in of huge craters, formed by the enemy at every cross-roads, and the repair of canal and river bridges, occupied the West Yorkshiremen until sth April, when the battalion moved to Ennemain : and on this date the retreat officially ends. Thus the 17th West Yorkshires had actually had no fighting, though the battalion was complimented by the G.O.C., 106th Brigade, on being the first battalion of the 35th Division to enter the enemy’s lines at the beginning of the advance. Two officers of the battalion, Lieut. H. F. O. Jenkins and Second-Lieut. A. D. Rose, were specially congratulated for their patrol work. Meanwhile the 2nd Battalion Yorkshires had hardly settled down in the Rancourt sector, after relieving the 2nd Middlesex on the night of 12th March, when all ranks that could be spared were set to work on wiring the front line, or rather the posts. About 6 p.m. on the 14th, however, a Guards Brigade (of the Guards Division) on the left of the West Yorkshires sent a message to the latter that the Brigade was going to move at dusk to the German front line—\n\n1917 ** Booby-Traps ” 27\n\nDrossen Trench—as the enemy had vacated it. ‘‘This astounding news,’ said Colonel Jack (commanding 2nd West Yorkshires) “was promptly followed by patrols from ‘ B’ and ‘ D’ Companies entering the German front line, Drossen Trench—the patrols of Second-Lieuts. May and Hall being in about half an hour after orders to move and, as subsequently transpired, from a document captured by the battalion, only one hour after the enemy had left, about 8 p.m. ‘ C’ and‘ B’ occupied the Drossen Trench, gaining touch soon afterwards with Guards on left and 2nd Devons on right. And patrols were pushed forward at once to gain touch with the enemy. Front, 1,500 yards.”” In this manner began the German retreat along the front of the 2nd Battalion, and as the diary is of considerable interest extracts will be given from it. At Ir a.m. on the 15th Capt. Palmes, under orders, advanced and occupied the south-east side of “the wood.”' Several groups of Germans witnessed this manceuvre, but were fired on and imme- diately withdrew. The left of the battalion was then about 2,000 yards in front of the Guards on the left, and well advanced in front of the unit on the right. Night found the battalion occupying about 4,000 yards of front with “ A” on south-east edge of Wood, “‘ C ” (Lieut. Myers) thrown back to left, ‘‘ B”’ (Capt. Alexander) in old German front line and ‘‘ D” (Second-Lieut. Ingham) in old British line. Some good patrol work was carried out during the night. lower lying than ours, the hostile trenches were deep and dry and contained large numbers of dug-outs, mostly blown in. And in some cases holding traps of various kinds which our troops had previously been warned about. Except for a number of hand- grenades little material was here left behind.” On the afternoon of the 16th the 2nd West Yorkshires were 2xp relieved by the 2nd Middlesex and marched back to Hospital Wood. Batration. The 17th was spent in “‘ resting and cleaning-up,” but on the 18th the battalion again moved up to Apollo, near Rancourt, arriving at 5 p.m. During the night, orders arrived for the battalion to move on the following morning to Moislains (which in the meantime had been occupied) and arrive in the village by 9 a.m. on roth. 19TH MARCH. At 7 a.m. the West Yorkshiremen, moving via south-east corner of St. Pierre Vaast Wood and Moislains Wood, set out for the village. ‘* Curious,” records the Battalion Diary, ‘‘ to be now moving glibly Over enemy’s trench system with chargers, flags and all.

On the night of the 19th the battalion patrols crept forward towards Nurlu, which was found to be still occupied by the enemy. But about dawn on the 20th “ D’”’ Company entered the village, with very little opposition from the enemy, and at 11 a.m. the whole battalion advanced about 1,000 yards, with its right on the south-east end of Nurlu Wood, and left about Nurlu including the village. Only enemy snipers were encountered, and these were soon dealt with. ‘““ A few shells. Yeomanry scouts in vicinity. Battalion officers riding their chargers. Nurlu in ruins, houses demolished, dug-outs blown in, furniture smashed, trees destroyed. Every conceivable damage planned by the enemy. Good many enemy to be seen in groups, but out of rifle range and our guns not yet much forward on account of broken bridges and mined roads, and red glares all over horizon point to further damage and withdrawal.” At 3 p.m. on 21st the 2nd Middlesex again relieved the 2nd West Yorkshires, and the latter “ retired to cellars and holes in débris in Moislains.”’ ‘“‘ Cleaning-up,” bathing in an improvised bath-house and kit inspection took place on the 22nd: on that date also another event, duly recorded in the Battalion Diary, took place: ‘“ Battalion furnishes BEER, carefully hoarded by Quartermaster Hinchcliffe since The manna which fell from the heavens to feed the famished Israelites was not more welcome than that “ carefully hoarded ” beer! It goes without saying that the “‘ Quarter Bloke ” on that day was more popular than ever ! On the 23rd the battalion was back in Nurlu and 1,000 yards south of the village. The weather was still bitterly cold—“ perishing cold ” as the records have it—and the enemy not only sniped with rifles, but was obviously using up his dump of artillery ammunition, seeing that he was engaged in firing shots with 8-in. howitzers, even at single men. Battalion Headquarters had a narrow escape, a shell bursting four feet above the door: ‘‘ The door and entrance, I may add,”’ said Colonel Jack, “‘ faced the wrong way for us, so as to admit more easily these things.’” Gradually the 8th Division pushed its way forward, following\n\nHattalion Headquarters had vacated this dug-out charge of explosives was found just behind the mess store, intended for blowing dug-outs 1n and failed to explode.\"\n\n1917 ** Excess of Zeal” 29\n\nclosely on the heels of the retreating enemy. On the 27th the 2nd West Yorkshires occupied a line on a ridge almost 1,000 yards south- west of Hendecourt. At dawn on 28th an N.C.O. and six other ranks, 28TH Marcu. on patrol, approached within 200 yards of German posts and had to retire, through excess of zeal on the part of some company posts spent a miserable day in hole between lines, sniped by both sides.” On the 29th a brisk little affair took place: ‘‘ At dusk Second- 2xp Lieuts. May and Yorke proceeded, each with fifteen men and a Lewis Battation. gun, to enter and occupy Hendecourt. The latter and his men got close to a hostile post just south of village, and there met heavy rifle and machine-gun fire which caused about seven casualties and stopped the operations of that patrol. Second-Lieut. Yorke was severely wounded and carried away with difficulty. All others got back except one man. Second-Lieut. May was more fortunate and entered Hendecourt, but opening fire on enemy machine-guns to assist Lieut. Yorke’s party, the enemy began closing in on him from all directions and in superior numbers. On these groups he opened a lively fire and did some damage, and then was obliged to withdraw his men adroitly. In view of other operations further enterprise was abandoned for the time.” Relief followed this little adventure and the battalion withdrew to Moislains. Hendecourt was captured on the following day by the Middlesex and Devons. The 1st April found the 2nd West Yorkshires in Divisional ist Apriv. Reserve in Nurlu and the battalion seems, at last, to have obtained some measure of comfort: ‘‘ Men in cellars, dug-outs and remains of barns, and all fairly comfortable. There was ample fuel and each little billet had its own fire.” Here the battalion remained until the 11th of the month, by which time the enemy was practically settled in his new line of defence. The four West Yorkshire Battalions of the 185th Infantry Brigade (62nd Division), after relief on 6th March, had on the 7th 2/STH, 2/6TH\n\n. . , (9TH, 2/8TH moved into the following quarters: 2/5th to No. 4 Camp; 2/6th\n\nOldham Camp; 2/7th Lytham Camp; 2/8th Mailly Wood Camp, 7TH Marcu. where also the Brigade established Headquarters. The 62nd Division, after a tortuous advance, had halted in front of the Roc- quigny-Bapaume-Ablainzevelle line and had begun preparations for an attack on Achiet-le-Petit. With this intention the West York- shire battalions set to work on the construction of a theatre in which to practise the attack. The latter, however, was not destined to take place for the enemy within the next few days began to evacuate\n\n16TH—17TH MARCH.\n\n2/5TH, 2/6TH 2/7TH, 2/8TH BATTALIONS. 4TH APRIL.\n\n30 The West Regiment in the War 1917\n\nhis positions and fall back in front of the Vth Corps. The capture of Irles by the 18th Division on the roth March! and the subsequent evacuation of the Loupart Line on the 16th were followed by still more extensive retirements along the whole front. For here, also, on the night of 16th/17th the sky was illuminated by red flares, the enemy’s signal to his troops for the general retreat to the Hinden- burg Line. The 185th Infantry Brigade was not, however, called upon to enter the front line of the Division during the remainder of March, and it was not until the night of the 4th April that the Brigade relieved the 22nd Brigade of the 7th Division in the Ecoust-St.- Mein sector, which had been captured by the latter, together with Croisilles and Longatte on the 2nd of the month. During the interval, the West Yorkshiremen had experienced most trying conditions in the gradual move forward. Large working parties had to be supplied each day in order to repair the damaged roads and communications and collect stores of rations and ammunition for the new ‘‘ dumps.” The weather was atrocious, accommodation for the men awful and the troops, with not three months’ service in France, suffered greatly. But their spirit was fine, and speaking generally the men were in splendid fettle and eager for their first real battle with the enemy.’ Thus, so far as the regiment was concerned, ended the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line, a retreat, be it remembered, forced upon the enemy by the successful tactics of the Allies. The general Situation was admirably summarised in a divisional report in the following terms: ‘‘ The German retreat on the German front proceeds. No such war of movement has taken place on the Western Front since the days of the Marne. From Monchy, south-west of Arras, to north of Soissons, a distance of seventy miles, and allowing for convolutions of the line—about 120 miles—the German armies are retiring towards the Belgian frontier with British and French forces, including cavalry, in close touch. Not only Bapaume and Péronne, as already reported, but Nesle, Chaulnes and over eighty villages have come into British hands in the last few days. The enemy has been laying the country waste and has poisoned the wells\n\n1 Major C. K. James, 6th Border Regiment, took over command of the 2/7th West York- on the tith March, vtce Major O. C.

He had been killed by a bomb and had been missing since the night or tgth February.\n\n1917\n\nTHE ARRAS OFFENSIVE, 1917: The First Battle of the Scarpe, 1917: 9th—r14th April\n\nURING the British advance, and the German retreat, to the Hindenburg Line, the Allies had been completing arrangements for their offensive, planned to take place in the Spring of 1917. The role assigned to the British was first an attack on the salient between the Scarpe and the Ancre, into which the enemy had been pressed as a result of the Somme battles of 1916. This, for convenience sake, had always been referred to as the Gommecourt Salient. The German retreat, however, from the southern face of the salient, though in no way delaying Sir Douglas Haig’s plans, necessitated a slight modification of his scheme of attack, which subsequently resulted in the Fifth Army (having followed up the retreating enemy from the Ancre front) keeping a heavy pressure on the enemy, so as to contain his forces whilst the Third and First Armies, north of the river, attacked from Croisilles to the Scarpe and the Vimy Ridge. The Arras Offensive was to be followed by an offensive along the Flanders front, Sir Douglas Haig’s scheme being “ to strike hard in the north before the enemy realised that the attack in the south would not be pressed further.”’ ** Zero ” had been fixed for 5-30 a.m. on 9th April, but for three weeks prior to that date the systematic cutting of the enemy’s wire was begun and the hostile trenches and communications were subjected to a tremendous bombardment. This period of prepara- tion exceeded in fury even that carried out on the Somme during\n\nthe previous summer, and captured German prisoners gave terrible details of the destructive and moral effect of the British artillery fire. Twelve divisions of the Third Army and four Canadian divisions and one British Brigade of the First Army took part in the initial Stages of the operations, but with only three divisions, 3rd, 4th and 17th, is this story concerned. In the 3rd Division were the 12th West Yorkshires, in the 4th, the 21st Battalion, Pioneers, and in the\n\n17th Division the roth West Yorkshires. The former division was 37\n\n12TH\n\nBATTALION.\n\nIst JAN.\n\n28TH FEB.\n\n4TH APRIL.\n\n38 The West Yorkshire Regiment tn the War 1917\n\njust north of the Scarpe, the latter south of it (just south of the Arras- Cambrai road), whilst the 1oth Battalion was in Talavera Camp, Agnez, on the evening of 7th April. On the 1st January the 12th Battalion West Yorkshires was at Louvencourt, mostly engaged in furnishing working parties, though regimental classes for Lewis gunners and bombers were held when- ever possible. On the 7th the battalion marched to Raincheval, moving on the goth to Fieffes, where training was carried out until the 27th, when another change was made, the battalion marching via Neuvilette and Beauvois to Dieval. Here, several days were spent in training before a further move was made, this time to Houvin-Houvigneul. The last day of February saw the battalion taking the road to Liencourt, where after nearly three weeks’ training a definite move forward to the front line was carried out, the 9th Brigade having taken over I.1 sector, just east of Arras. On the 22nd the battalion took over front-line trenches, relieving the Ist Northumberland Fusiliers. Intermittent shelling was responsible for six casualties incurred by the 12th West Yorkshires on taking over this new sector and, until 27th, when the battalion was relieved, there were several casualties daily, though the enemy’s reply to the heavy bombardment to which his line was being subjected was comparatively feeble. In accordance with the general plan of attack the 12th West Yorkshires marched into Arras on 4th April and were billeted in cellars during the concluding stage of the preliminary bombardment. Small parties of men were sent up each night to improve the assembly trenches, cut wire, etc. On the night of 8th April the battalion paraded and began to move forward at 10.10 p.m. to its assembly trenches between Iceland and Twenty Street. By 2 a.m. the West Yorkshiremen were in their allotted positions, having suffered no casualties. On their right were the 4th Royal Fusiliers and, on their left, the 13th King’s Regt. The 76th Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Division was to attack at “‘ Zero”? and having captured the Black Line, the 9th Brigade was to go through and capture the Blue Line. The village of Tilloy lay in the line of attack to be carried out by the 12th West Yorkshires, and the Battalion Diary gives the following disposition of com- panies prior to the attack : ‘* Battalion Headquarters (Lieut.-Colonel R. C. Smythe) No. 5 assembly trench; two platoons of ‘C’ Company and two platoons of ‘B’ Company (who were to form\n\n1917 Fury of the British Guns 39\n\nthe first wave) No. 6 assembly trench; two platoons of ‘D’ Company and two platoons of ‘ A’ Company (first line of ‘ moppers- up ’) No. 7 assembly trench ; two platoons of ‘C’ Company, and two platoons of ‘B’ Company (second wave) No. 8 assembly trench ; two platoons of ‘D ’ Company and two platoons of ‘A’ Company (second line of ‘ moppers-up’). Battalion Headquarters were situated in the old German front line at G. 36. Strength 720 all ranks.” The general attack north and south of the Scarpe was launched 12TH at §.30 a.m. under cover of a most effective artillery barrage, behind BATTALION. which the British infantry ‘‘ poured like a flood across the German ” lines, overwhelming the enemy’s garrisons.”’ Of the 3rd Division, west of the village of Tilloy-les-Mofflaines, the 76th Infantry Brigade attacked and captured the first hostile system of trenches from G. 36 c. 9.1 to H. 31 a 4.4. At 7 a.m. the 9th Infantry Brigade was launched against the second German system of trenches from Noisy Redoubt, N.1.a.3.0 to H.32.c.8.5., the 12th West Yorkshires being in the centre of the line of the three attacking battalions. The battalion left its assembly trenches in columns of sections in single file, maintaining this formation until the enemy’s fire com- pelled a change; the men then advanced in extended order. The effectiveness of the artillery barrage was evident as the troops reached the broken and tumbled German wire, behind which the enemy’s trenches resembled masses of churned-up earth, with here and there a blown-in dug-out, the planks flung in all directions bespattered with blood and mud. On all sides lay dead and wounded, and smashed machine-guns and trench-mortars. As the troops came upon the almost obliterated trenches, from the bowels of the earth, where they had been crouching in a few still-habitable dug-outs, there emerged Germans, their hands up, too terrified almost from the awful bombardment to utter the words ‘‘ Kamerad, Kamerad.” These men told the West Yorkshiremen that for four days prior to the attack the relentless fury of the British artillery fire had kept them below ground; they were afraid to venture out even for food or water. The battalion, without meeting with serious opposition, ad- vanced to Tilloy. Pushing on through the village they emerged from the eastern exits, but here came to their first halt; the 13th King’s Regt., on the left, had been held up by the enemy who, between Tilloy and the Cambrai-Arras road, had put up a determined fight.\n\n21ST BATTALION.\n\n8TH MARCH.\n\n40 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\nLewis guns and bombers, however, soon broke down the enemy’s resistance, and, the temporary check thus overcome, the West Yorkshiremen pushed on to their objective (the Blue Line), which was reached about 8-30 a.m. Without interference from the enemy the battalion consolidated its gains, Battalion Headquarters being first in Hastings Trench, but later moved to Tilloy.1 Heavy casualties had, however, been suffered by the 12th West Yorkshires. Two officers (Capt. W. C. Skeet and Second-Lieut. G. F. Parkin) had been killed and six other officers wounded, whilst of ‘‘ other ranks’”’ nineteen were killed, 119 wounded and five missing. Most of these casualties were the result of the enemy’s artillery fire, which caught the battalion in its assembly trenches preparatory to the advance for, after the attack had been launched, the enemy’s barrage was very weak, owing to the splendid counter- battery work of the Briush artillery. North of the Scarpe, the 9th Division had first captured St. Laurent Blangy and then Athies. The 4th Division now leap- frogged the 9th, directing its advance on Fampoux, which, with the Hyderabad Redoubt, was speedily captured. The 4th Divisional Pioneers (21st Battalion West Yorkshires), however, do not appear to have gone forward with the attacking battalions, but were set to work on making the roads eastwards passable for artillery and transport. The 21st Battalion (Lieut.-Colonel Sir E. H. St. L. Clarke) had, for a month before “‘ Zero’ day, been working under XVIIth Corps at Etrun, St. Catherine and St. Nicholas, preparing roads and tram- ways for the expected advance. Now, although pioneer work behind the lines, compared with life in the front line trenches, was far less dangerous and less un- bearable, it was by no means as free from risk as was popularly supposed. Long-range hostile guns and the enemy’s bombing aeroplanes continually searched the roads upon which any signs of life appeared, and a working party was invariably marked down as a good target for a storm of shells and bombs. Thus the West Yorkshire Pioneers had a fair number of casualties in officers as well as other ranks whilst at work in the Arras area. Second-Lieut. Richardson was wounded on 30th March and Capt. Gott was killed on 4th April, whilst many other ranks were also killed and wounded. The battalion had arrived in the Arras area on the 8th March,\n\n' Three machine-guns, two broken trench-mortars, two new trench-mortars complete with forty-one boxes of ammunition, fifteen boxes of bombs and other miscellaneous articles were captured by the battalion.\n\n1917 Of the Pioneers 4!\n\nhaving moved up gradually from the Somme area—the New Year having found the West Yorkshiremen at Maurepas. February had been a particularly hard month for these Pioneers, used at all times to a strenuous existence. There was one night (15th) which will probably be remembered by all who served with 21st Battalion and came through the war. A move had been made from camp near Curlu to Marriéres Wood dug-outs. Following a period of hard frosts and frozen ground, a thaw had just set in, and when at night the men set to work on the trenches the ground beneath the three- inch covering of mud and slush was found to be solid ice. In vain the men, using picks, endeavoured to penetrate the stubborn soil and, after a night of terribly hard work, carried out almost in inky darkness, very little had been done and everyone was worn out. On the 3rd 3rp Marcu. March the battalion, then in Camp 12, Chapilly, began to move north to the Arras area and, on the 8th, “A” and “ B ”’ Companies arrived in Etrun, taking over work from a Pioneer Battalion, Nor- thumberland Fusiliers, whilst Battalion Headquarters and “‘ C”’ and ““D” Companies moved into Arras, relieving a Pioneer Battalion of the Royal Scots. Then ensued a month of strenuous labour in preparing for the offensive. On “ Zero” day (9th April, 1917) the Ban Battalion Diary has the following entry—“ Battle of Arras. ‘A’ ott APRIL. and ‘B’ Companies extending light railways from Roclincourt to old German line towards Nine Elms, ‘C’ Company making Bailleul road passable for guns and wheeled traffic over British line and No Man’s Land up to Clarence Crater, ‘ D ’ Company making St. Laurent Blangy road similarly passable from the British line, over No Man’s Land and the German line to St. Laurent Blangy Church. “The advance began at 5-30 a.m. and was so successful that the companies could commence work at 7-30 a.m. with very little inter- ference from the enemy’s guns, and the only casualties were four men From rst March the 17th Division, in which the roth Battalion 10TH West Yorkshires was contained, had been resting and training for the Arras offensive, first in the Warloy area and then in Willerman and neighbourhood. The Division was to be attached to the Cavalry Corps, with orders to follow the cavalry when the latter moved forward after the initial attack. The soth Brigade (in which the West Yorkshires were contained) was to follow the 3rd Cavalry Division, moving along the main Arras-Cambrai road. On the afternoon of 9th April, after the offensive had been\n\n12TH BATTALION. 10TH APRIL.\n\n11TH APRIL\n\n12TH APRIL.\n\n13TH APRIL.\n\n42 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\nlaunched and was in progress, the roth West Yorkshires (in Brigade) marched via Agnez-les-Duisans to the main Arras-Cambrai road. On reaching the outskirts of Arras at dusk and owing to the dense block of traffic, it was impossible to get any further and the Brigade was ordered to bivouac for the night, the West Yorkshires passing the night in a field to the south of the road. Snow fell heavily and no cover was available. This, so far as the Regiment was concerned, ended the first day of the Allied offensive. On roth the 12th West Yorkshires (3rd Division) continued work on the new trenches, ‘‘ A” Company being detailed to carry up S.A.A. to the 8th Brigade for an attack on the Brown Line. The weather was at its very worst—hail, rain and snow swept the trenches —and without shelter of any description the battalion had a most trying time. Even in fine weather an advance was horrible enough, for on all sides mangled and torn bodies lay unburied and amidst the shell-craters and blasted earth the most ghastly sights met the eye ; added to the dull misery caused by filthy, muddy trenches, it may well be imagined that the position of the 12th Battalion was not one to be envied. At 4-30 a.m. on the 11th, in a blinding snowstorm and half- frozen, the battalion moved off to a position of assembly, described in the Diaries as ‘‘ N.3.a.”” The battalion had been ordered to occupy a portion of the Brown Line that night, and for this purpose first two officers (at 9 a.m.) and later the C.O. and the Brigadier, set out to reconnoitre the new position to be taken over from two battalions of the 76th Infantry Brigade (3rd Division). It was 10 p.m. before the 12th West Yorkshires marched into the trenches in relief of the above units and 2 a.m. on the morning of the 12th before the relief was complete. Thus for sixteen hours the West Yorkshiremen had spent ‘‘ a most trying and miserable time ”’ at N.3.a. before moving up. ‘“C” and “ B” Companies occupied the front line which ran immediately south of the Cambrai-Arras road, east of Les Fosses Farm. ““A” and “‘ D” Companies were in the Brown Line, and Battalion Headquarters were at Point 52. Throughout the 12th the battalion consolidated the line, under intermittent shell-fire, during which, however, only one man was killed and four wounded. The morning of the 13th still saw the battalion in the same position. But at 10-30 a.m. the C.O. attended a conference at 9th Brigade Head- quarters, when an attack on Guémappe was arranged. The 12th\n\n1917 The Attack on Guémappe 43\n\nWest Yorkshires and 1st Northumberland Fusiliers were to form the leading line, the 4th Royal Fusiliers and the 13th King’s Regt. being in support. “Zero” hour was to be 6 p.m. South of the gth Brigade the soth Division was attacking the high ground south of Guémappe, whilst north of the latter the 29th Division was to capture the high ground east of Monchy, which village had already fallen into British hands. At 6 p.m. “‘ A” and “ D ” Companies of the West Yorkshires, r2tx in artillery formation, left the Brown Line and advanced to the BATTALION. support of “C” and “B” Companies. The latter advanced to 137 the attack at 6-29 p.m., the two supporting companies being then some 200 yards in rear, as ordered. The Northumberland Fusiliers went forward in similar formation. As the two battalions advanced the enemy put down a very heavy artillery barrage, but casualties were not severe until the crest, just west of the sunken road running through N12 and N.18, was reached. At this point a murderous machine-gun and rifle fire was met with and the line wavered. In spite of the British artillery barrage, which was very heavy, from the direction of Guémappe and Wancourt the enemy’s fire was intense and, although with great gallantry the left company of the Northumberland Fusiliers and the West Yorkshiremen pushed on a little further, they were eventually held up and could do nothing against the storm of bullets which met their advance. So until darkness fell, the West Yorkshiremen and Fusiliers crouched in shell-holes, taking whatever cover presented itself. After dark the 18th received instructions to withdraw to the sunken road and the original front line and consolidate. The battalion’s casualties had again been heavy: four officers were wounded ; twelve other ranks were killed, eighty-five wounded and twelve missing. Throughout the night the enemy persistently bombarded with gas shells the line held by the West Yorkshiremen. On the morning of the 14th, at about 5-30 a.m., the battalion was 14TH APRIL. relieved by the South Wales Borderers of the 29th Division, and marched back to Arras where billets were occupied in the town. Meanwhile the 21st Battalion was still engaged on the roads 21sT in and about Arras and it was not until a later phase of the operations BATTALION. that this battalion carried out work in the front line.

The 17th Division had now been ordered to join the VIth Corps and all previous instructions as to following the cavalry through had been cancelled, the soth Brigade being ordered to relieve the 44th Brigade (15th Division) north and south-west of Monchy-le- Preux during the night r1th/12th. The roth West Yorkshires relieved the 7th/8th King’s Own Scottish Borderers and small detachments of eight other units of the 15th Division, the relief being completed by 5 a.m. on 12th. The West Yorkshires held the right of the Brigade front with the 6th Dorsets on the left. The line taken over by the battalion (in H.36 a.c. and d. and N.6.b.) consisted of small lengths of trench facing in all directions where the advancing troops had dug themselves in. The best possible line was chosen, though thin, and the battalion ‘“‘ dug in” with its right resting on Monchy and its left meeting the 6th Dorsets at H.36 a.2.6. At 2 p.m. orders were received that the 9th Division was going to attack north of the Scarpe against the Roeux-Gavrelle road, with Roeux as a second objective, and that the soth Brigade was to co-operate south of the river. The roth West Yorkshires and 6th Dorsets were to advance in conjunction and capture a line following the road from Monchy to I.25.d.7.9. and push strong patrols thence to the Scarpe. The West Yorkshiremen got into position and strong patrols were sent forward and established themselves on the Monchy- Pelves road, but as the operation north of the river had failed the intended attack was cancelled and the battalion returned to its original trenches. The 13th was a trying day for the battalion; all day long the enemy, assisted by his aeroplanes, heavily shelled the front line trenches of the soth Brigade and casualties in the roth West York- shires were severe. Four officers were killed by this shell-fire— Lieuts. A. G. Titley and H. Parsons and Second-Lieuts. H. Marshall and C. W. Andrews. No figures are given of the losses in other ranks, but they were heavy. At midnight on 13th orders were received to co-operate with the 88th Brigade (27th Division) in an attack to be made eastwards at 5-30 a.m. on the 14th. The West Yorkshires were to cover the flank of the 88th Brigade by pushing forward northwards of Monchy during the night and occupying the spurs with a series of strong points. Strong patrols were immediately sent out by the battalion and a series of posts were dug with the left on the Pelves road (Harness\n\n1917 Reasons for continuing the Offenstve 45\n\nLane ?) and the right on Bit Lane; a support trench was also dug inside north edge of Monchy Wood (between the two roads). The posts contained a garrison of 100 men with six Lewis guns and one machine-gun. The attack of the 88th Brigade apparently coincided with a counter-attack by the Germans (3rd Bavarian Division), the latter having orders to retake Monchy at all costs. Throughout the day the West Yorkshiremen’s posts were heavily engaged with the enemy, and although pressed hard the roth Battalion succeeded in beating off all attacks from the north, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. By 3.30 p.m. the enemy’s attack had been definitely broken, but for four hours his artillery shelled Monchy intensely. During the night 14th/rsth the soth Brigade was relieved by the 52nd Brigade and marched back again to the Caves in Arras, well pleased to be out of the inferno going on in the front line.\n\nThe Second Battle of the Scarpe, 23rd-24th April.\n\nFrom the official despatches it is apparent that the operations round Arras should have stopped on 14th April, for Sir Douglas Haig stated that: “‘ At the end of six days’ fighting our front had been rolled four miles further east and all the dominating features, forming the immediate objects of my attacks, which I considered it desirable to hold before transferring the bulk of my resources to the north, had passed into our possesston.”’ But owing to weather conditions the French offensive had been delayed and as it was important that the full pressure of the British offensive should be maintained in order to assist the French, the operations were continued, the next phase of which was the Second Battle of the Scarpe. Although the official despatches make no mention of it (though mentioning the other divisions engaged) the 17th Division took part in this battle. For two days (16th and 17th April), after relief from the line on torn the 15th, the roth West Yorkshires remained in the Caves in Arras. BATTALION. On the 18th, however, the battalion moved to dug-outs in Railway 18TH APRIL. Trench and on the following day marched up to the Brown Line (H.28) for work as carrying parties to the front line ; Battalion Head- quarters were in a railway cutting at Feuchy. Until the evening of 21st, when it was relieved and marched back to Museum cellars in\n\n23RD APRIL.\n\n10TH BATTALION.\n\n25TH APRIL.\n\n46 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\nArras, the battalion “‘ carried’ for other troops, but the 22nd was a rest day. At midnight, 22nd/23rd April, the roth West Yorkshires (in Brigade) moved up to the White (or Orange) Line, behind the crest of Orange Hill, for the attack on Bayonet Trench—a trench running north of Monchy down the slopes of the hill towards the River Scarpe—was to be made by the 51st Brigade. At 4-45 a.m. on 23rd the battle opened on a front of about nine miles from Croisilles to Gavrelle. The attack of the 51st Brigade failed and at 2-30 p.m. the soth Brigade was ordered to repeat the attack—the roth West Yorkshires on the right and 6th Dorsets on the left. A hundred men of the West Yorkshires had already been engaged during the day in carrying bombs and ammunition for the first attack on Bayonet Trench through constant shell-fire and machine-gun fire. The roth West Yorkshires received orders to attack at 6 p.m., the objective allotted to the battalion being Riele Trench, whilst the 6th Dorsets were to attack the northern half of Bayonet Trench. As the two battalions of the soth Brigade advanced the enemy put down a very heavy barrage. The West Yorkshires, who had to advance down the slope of the hill, were at once perceived by the Germans, who opened a hurricane barrage consisting mostly of 5.9 and 8-in. shells, whilst from the northern bank of the Scarpe a murderous concentrated machine-gun fire swept the ranks of the Yorkshiremen. In spite, however, of heavy losses the roth Battalion with splendid pluck and tenacity struggled on and finally dug in about 200 yards in advance of and to the east of Lone Copse, in touch with the Dorsets. Here they hung on until relieved by the 7th East Yorkshires. The battalion then withdrew to the original front line, supplying parties for the East Yorkshiremen throughout the 24th. The failure to capture the objective allotted to it was no fault of the roth Battalion, or indeed of the soth Brigade. The situation north of the river had changed when the attack began, and Roeux was no longer in the possession of the British. As a result the enemy was able to bring a deadly enfilade fire on the West Yorkshiremen as they advanced. Capt. P. K. Allen was killed on 23rd. On 25th April the roth West Yorkshires returned to Arras, entraining on the following day for Saulty. From the latter place the battalion marched out to Sombrim and went into rest billets, where all ranks were speedily engaged in “‘ cleaning-up ” after the strenuous period through which they had passed.\n\n1917 Five Battalions in Action 47\n\nBetween roth and 25th April the roth West Yorkshires had lost five officers killed and eight wounded ; in other ranks the losses were thirty-eight killed, 264 wounded and eleven missing.\n\nThe Third Battle of the Scarpe, 1917, 3rd-4th May.\n\nIn}the Battle of Arleux (28th-29th April) no battalion of the Regiment was engaged, and it was not until the 3rd and 4th May, in the Third Battle of the Scarpe, that the West Yorkshires again exchanged blows with the enemy. In this battle, however, no less than five battalions of the Regiment took part, t.e., 12th, 1§th 17th, 18th and 2Ist. The 12th Battalion (3rd Division) after relief in the trenches on 12TH the night of 14th April, had moved back to Arras, moving out to BATTALION. Duisans on 21st. Only two days were allowed at Duisans, and then the battalion returned to Arras unul the night of rst May, when the gth Brigade, having received orders that it was to attack the enemy on Z” day—(3rd May)—the West Yorkshiremen marched to trenches near Tilloy. On 2nd May all Company and Platoon Commanders recon- 2np May noitred the route to the assembly positions, the battalions moving forward by companies at9 p.m. “A” and “‘ D”’ Companies were to occupy Shrapnel Trench from left to right, whilst ““ B ” and “‘C ” Companies had to dig cover for themselves in rear of the trench. On the way up the enemy put down a very heavy barrage of gas shells and shells of different calibre, on Monchy, and on the track leading up to the assembly positions allotted to the West Yorkshiremen. This barrage unfortunately caused casualties and disorganised the advance, thus delaying the assembly. By “ Zero,” however, in spite of losses, the 9th Brigade was formed up as follows : In the front line 4th Royal Fusiliers (R), 13th King’s Regiment (L). In support 12th West Yorkshires (R), 1st Northumberland Fusiliers (L). ‘“ A” and “‘ D”’ Companies of the West Yorkshires formed the two leading waves of the battalion, followed by “B” and “C” Companies, the distance between waves being 75 yards and between lines 50 yards. The battalion was ordered to move at 200 yards distance in rear of 4th Royal Fusiliers. “ Zero” hour was 3-45 a.m. on 3rd May. 10TH, The 15th, 16th and 18th West Yorkshires (93rd Brigade, 31st Battations.\n\n15TH BATTALION. 3RD May.\n\n48 The West Yorkshire Regiment in the War 1917\n\nDivision) had been but a few days in the Arras area when they were ordered to take part in the operations of 3rd/4th May. On 29th April the 93rd Brigade relieved the 188th Brigade (63rd Division) in the front line in the Gavrelle sector. The 15th West Yorkshires had taken over the right sub-sector—C.19.c.7.4- C.25.b.8.2 ; the 16th West Yorkshires the left sub-sector B.18.d.4.5- C.19.c.7.3. ; the 18th West Yorkshires were in support, one company at Hill 80, two companies in B.30.C.49-H.6.a.4.7. and the remaining company at C.25.c.8.2.-C.25.c.3.9.! Brigade Orders issued on 2nd May stated that the 31st Division would attack the enemy’s trench line—Gavrelle Support, Windmill Support and Oppy Support trenches—with the 93rd Brigade on the right and 92nd Brigade on the left. To the former Brigade a frontage of over 2,500 yards from a point south of Oppy (junction of Windmill and Link Trenches) to Gavrelle, had been allotted. The three West Yorkshire battalions were assembled for the attack in the following positions : 15th on the right, 18th in the centre and 16th on the left; the 18th Durham Light Infantry were in support. There were to be two attacks, the Southern and Northern ; the 18th West Yorkshires were to be divided into two half-battalions—the half on the left of the 15th Battalion co-operating with that battalion in the Southern Attack, and the half on the right of the 16th Battalion co-operating with that battalion in the Northern Attack. ‘*¢ Zero ” hour was 3-45 a.m. on the 3rd May. The 15th West Yorkshires (Lieut.-Colonel S. C. Taylor) numbered only 547 officers, N.C.O.’s and men when the battle opened, the battalion having to attack on a frontage of 250 yards from I.1.a. 9.9 to C.25.a.6.6. ‘““ D ” was right front Company with “ A” in support and “ B” left front Company with ‘‘ C” in support. Each company went over in two waves of single line. Battle Head- quarters of the battalion were in the Cemetery, south of Gavrelle. About 2 o’clock on the morning of 3rd the enemy appeared nervous and put down a very heavy bombardment on Gavrelle and its en- vironments. For three-quarters of an hour he continued to plaster the village and the neighbourhood with sheel of all calibre, but all was quiet just prior to “ Zero.” At 3-45 a.m. the British barrage opened and the troops at once went forward to the attack. Up to 5-30 a.m. no information reached\n\n1 Without maps or any other means of describing these positions, it is impossible to avoid the use of co-ordinates. ‘The diaries generally during the Arras offensive of 1917 are lacking in detailed descriptions of the operations, and the positions of the various battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment are at times extremely difficult, if not impossible, to locate.\n\n1917 Terrible Losses of 15th Battalion 49\n\nBattalion Battle Headquarters of what had happened in the front line, but at that hour wounded men began to dribble in, and from these it was learned that the first objective, an irregular line running through Gavrelle Trench, the Windmill and Windmill Trench, had been captured.
