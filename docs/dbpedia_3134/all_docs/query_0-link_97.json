        "text": "The annual meeting of the Saltaire Institute Club was held on Wednesday evening at the Saltaire Institute. Prior to the meeting, Mr E C Fry (chairman of the committee) entertained the members of the Free Libraries Committee of the District Council and the officials of the club to tea. Mr Fry presided at the meeting which followed.\n\nIn presenting the annual report and balance sheet, Mr F White (hon. sec. and treasurer) said that there was a decrease in membership of ten. There were 122 members, and in all probability this number would decrease still further during the present year. Twenty four members had joined Hi Majesty’s Forces, and out of that number two had obtained commissions after serving in the ranks, namely Second Lieutenant A R Jukes and Second Lieutenant T R Ibbetson. The committee heartily congratulated both of them upon their promotion.\n\nThe usual billiard handicaps had been played, and the club had only lost one match up to the present in the Shipley Billiard League, and were hoping to carry off the cup this year.\n\nThe club had been in existence about eight years, and during that time £315 had been handed over to the council from the profits. The amount paid in rent was £80, and in addition a new billiard table was bought at a cost of £57 to replace one taken for the use of the members of the Fire Brigade, making in all a total of £452. £102 had been paid to the council for gas, and £115 had been spent on billiard requisites and recovered billiard tables. The financial statement for this year showed a balance in the bank of £1 8s 6d, whist the cash in hand amounted to 13s 0d.\n\nMr J Walker was appointed hon. sec. and treasurer, and the following elected to the committee: Messrs. E C Fry, T Oxley, E N Armitage, H Feather, J Stringer and S Holdsworth.\n\nMr Fry, who presented to the club a framed roll of honour containing the names of the members with the colours, asked the executive committee to accept the gift which he had prepared, and to have it placed in the club room so that visitors might read, mark and learn who the men were who had sacrificed so much for the sake of their country.\n\nA vote of thanks to Mr Fry was proposed by Councillor Thos. Hill (chairman of the District Council), who complimented the committee on the business-like manner in which they conducted the club.\n\nCouncillor C E Learoyd seconded and remarked that he was a member of the Institute club before he was eight years of age. (Laughter). The opinion had been expressed that some use might be made of some portion of the building, but whether the idea was practicable or not remained to be seen. It was the duty of the Libraries committee to try and popularise the Institute and to get people to take appreciate more the advantages of the reading room, and library. He was convinced that when the war was over, a great future awaited the Institute, and the Victoria Hall, as well as the buildings generally.\n\nCouncillor E Cowgill, who supported the resolution of thanks, said that the gift presented to the club by Mr Fry, would be a memento more valuable in his opinion, than anything else hanging in that room. A man could do no more than offer his all to the service of his country as those men had done.\n\nMr Fry briefly responded, and added that the welfare of the Institute club, had become part of his life interest, and almost part of his very being.\n\nThe first meeting in public of the Shipley Recruiting Tribunal was held last Friday (25th February) at the District Council Offices (Somerset House). Councillor Thomas Hill (chairman) presided and other members of the Tribunal present were Councillors C E Learoyd, T F Doyle, F F Rhodes and Mr Ernest Illingworth. Mr J A Burton J.P. attended (military representative).\n\nTwenty-two applications by or on behalf of men who had attested under Lord Derby’s scheme were considered. Of these, ten were refused, eight were granted postponements, and three were declared to be exempt through their being at present engaged in reserved occupations, whilst one application was withdrawn.\n\nAppeals were made by Sir Titus Salt, Bart., Sons and Co. Ltd., on behalf of Mr Joseph H N Roberts (described as managing director), Mr Harry Griffiths (chief clerk, and foreman in the worsted coating department), Mr James A Midgley, (designing room clerk) and Mr Percy G Baker (clerk of works).\n\nMr C H Briggs was present on behalf of the firm.\n\nWith respect to Mr Griffiths, the chairman said that the Tribunal had carefully considered the appeal but from the particulars given they were unable to find sufficient grounds to grant the application.\n\nMr Briggs: I am sorry to hear you say that Mr Chairman. This man is indispensable to us on the manufacturing side of the business. Several men have gone out of this department, and if Mr Griffiths is not allowed to remain, the business will be dislocated. I appeal to you to grant him exception. It takes some time to train a man for this particular work and we cannot put a woman in. Neither can we get a man to take his place. Mr Griffiths is present, and will answer any questions you care to put to him.\n\nThe Chairman: He is not the chief man in this department?\n\nMr Briggs: No, but one man cannot do everything.\n\nThe Chairman: There is a head of the department?\n\nMr Briggs: Yes, but he is not always at Saltaire. He goes to Bradford every day and has a multitude of other duties to perform. Therefore there must be someone to take up certain particular parts of his work.\n\nThe Chairman: The point that weighed with the Tribunal was that he was not the head of the department. Cannot you bring another man in to do his work or lift someone up into his position?\n\nMr Briggs: You cannot lift them up because we have not men to lift up.\n\nThe Chairman: How many men have you lost out of your department?\n\nMr Griffiths: Four out of a total of nine\n\nMr Burton: I do not find this man’s name in the list you supplied me with of men likely to require consideration. When did you discover that he would be indispensable?\n\nMr Briggs: The name had been overlooked, but we sent a special request to you afterwards.\n\nThe Chairman: I am very sorry that the tribunal cannot allow this appeal.\n\nMr Briggs remarked that if the company took a different view he supposed they would be able to make a further appeal. The Chairman replied that he understood there is a district tribunal, but the clerk (Mr I Lindow) will give you full particulars.\n\nIn regard to Mr James Arthur Midgley, Mr Briggs said the former held an important position, and the company could not well do without him.\n\nThe Chairman: How many men are there in the department?\n\nMr Midgley: There were nine, but three have already gone, three were called up under the Derby scheme, and one is awaiting orders from the Navy. I am the only one for whom the firm is appealing.\n\nThe Chairman: You have replaced these men with girl clerks. I suppose there will be a head of the department?\n\nMr Briggs: Mr Harry Roberts is the head of that department.\n\nThe Chairman: So that Midgley is in charge under Mr Roberts\n\nMr Briggs: Mr Harry Roberts wished me to especially his name. He appeals to you to grant this application.\n\nMr Burton: May I ask, are the circumstances likely to be easier in a month’s time than they are now?\n\nMr Briggs: I am afraid from the way in which you are handling these cases, the circumstances are going to be worse. You have got my back against the wall now, and I have to fight for these men because if we do not get them excused there is going to be a dead-lock in our business such as never ought to arise or be threatened. We must have somebody else to manage matters at corners or else, where are we going to be – I cannot tell you where.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: There will be dislocation all round, Mr Briggs.\n\nMr Briggs: I was told that there is inconvenience all round.\n\nThe Chairman: In this case we appreciate the fact that this department has done a good deal to help the cause for which we are all fighting, and the Tribunal will grant the he should be put back to May 1st so that arrangements may be made in the meantime to ease the situation.\n\nWith respect to Mr P Gordon Baker, Mr Briggs said that the Tribunal had already received a good many particulars. With the Tribunals permission he would add some more facts.\n\nThe Chairman intimated that they were fully alive as to the man’s duties and while they admitted that he held an important position they were of the opinion that he could be replaced by a man who was ineligible for the Army.\n\nMr Briggs observed that that was hardly the proper way to look at the matter. In his opinion the man who occupied the position today was the best man and should be allowed to remain. “We should not be asked to go back” added Mr Briggs, “We want to go forward.”\n\nThe Chairman: We have a duty to perform and we are only following out our instructions. If the position can be filled by a man ineligible for the Army it should be so filled.\n\nMr Briggs: This man was put into his present position three years ago because he was a capable man\n\nThe Chairman: We know for a fact that a position such as he holds can be easily filled, temporarily by a component man.\n\nMr Briggs: I must differ from you with respect to it being easily filled.\n\nMr Illingworth: I should like to ask if they have a staff of mechanics at the mill.\n\nMr Briggs replied in the affirmative and at the same time, he would remind them they owned about 850 houses in addition to the mills, and it would take a man years to make himself familiar with the duties that are now being carried out by Mr Baker.\n\nMr Burton: But you must make an effort\n\nMr Briggs: We have made an effort.\n\nMr Burton said he was urged to impress upon everybody the need for personal service to the nation.\n\nThe application was refused.\n\nThe application on behalf of Mr Joseph Greenwood, (warehouseman in the Yarn Department at Sir Titus Salt Bart., Sons and Co. Ltd.) was withdrawn.\n\nMr Briggs said that Mr J H N Roberts was unable to appear personally as he had to go to London.\n\nThe Chairman: Mr Roberts must be fully acquainted with the Lord Derby scheme, and also with the fact that all available men are necessary. The Tribunal wonders what reason he had for thinking that the regulations under the Derby scheme did not apply to him.\n\nMr Briggs said that Mr Roberts was the managing director of the company, and also the manager of the wool department and the dress goods and linings department. He was of the opinion that Mr Roberts should be classified under the reserved occupations.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: What do you mean by saying he is the manager of the wool warehouse?\n\nMr Briggs: He is the manager of that department.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: There are men who do the work under him?\n\nMr Briggs: Yes\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: But that department would go on without him\n\nMr Briggs: No – Mr Harry Roberts is the manager practically of the whole concern, in his father’s absence.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes repeated that the department could go on as well without Mr Roberts.\n\nMr Briggs: I think you would not say so if you knew anything about it.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: I know a good deal about it.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd suggested that Mr Roberts could scarcely be expected to be responsible for the various departments referred to by Mr Briggs.\n\nMr Briggs: Do not attempt to depreciate Mr Roberts in my presence!\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: There is no question of depreciation whatever. We are trying to get to the facts of the case. We are here to do our duty, and we have to be exceedingly careful. Mr Roberts is an attested man and there are lots of people watching this case. That remark was uncalled for.\n\nMr Briggs: I beg your pardon if I have made a mistake.\n\nThe Chairman: You have put on your appeal form that he is in a reserved occupation.\n\nMr Briggs: Well I thought, being so closely in touch with the wool trade, he might be designated as such.\n\nThe Chairman: We cannot trace his position amongst the reserved occupations.\n\nMr Burton: If he had been described as the head of the wool sorting he might have come within the list.\n\nMr Briggs: If a mistake has been made in the wording, there remains the means of amending it. Undoubtedly he is the head of the wool department, the dress goods and lining department, and spinning.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: It is utterly impossible for one man to be the head of all those departments.\n\nThe Chairman: What proportion of the managers in the employ of the firm, have joined the colours.\n\nMr Briggs: We have none; they are nearly all over military age.\n\nThe Chairman: The application is refused.\n\nMr Briggs: The clerk must take our notice to appeal against your decision. I must tell you gentleman that you are seriously interfering with the management of our business in taking the line of action you have done. You cannot make a managing director out of anybody.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: I think these remarks should not be allowed\n\nMr Burton: You cannot address the Tribunal now after they have given their decision.\n\nMr Briggs: Very well sir.\n\nA “cramper” at Sir Titus Salt Bart., Sons and Co., Ltd., applied to be put back for domestic reasons, stating that he was the only support of an aged aunt, the latter being in receipt of the old age pension.\n\nMr Burton: You are asking the Tribunal to exempt you from being called up as a soldier because your absence would cause great distress and trouble to your relative?\n\nThe Cramper: Yes\n\nMr Burton: If you joined the Army and paid your aunt 6d. a day, she would receive a grant from the government of 9s. – It is a question whether I could allow her 6d. per day.\n\nThe application was refused.\n\nA meeting of the Shipley Military Tribunal was held last night (Thursday 2nd March), at Somerset House. Councillor Thomas Hill (chairman) presided, and in addition to the clerk (Mr I Lindow) were Councillors F Rhodes, C E Learoyd, T F Doyle, and Mr Ernest Illingworth.\n\nThe Clerk said that he had received the following letter, under date Feb 28th, from the firm of Sir Tuts Salt, Bart., Sons and Co., Ltd.,-\n\n“Dear Sir, - I have to say that no further appeals will be made to your Tribunal for reservations in regard to names submitted to you on the 21st February, being the fourth lot of groups. I am instructed by senior principal to say that these works will be closed as soon as possible after Mr J H N Roberts has gone (as he is summoned to report himself at Keighley on the 8th March), as he – my senior principal – does not feel equal to carry on this undertaking alone. The strain would be unbearable.\n\nWe have been asked by the Board of Trade to do what was possible to keep up our export trade, and with this object in mind our Russia representative returned to Russia at the end of December and orders are being sent on by him regularly, which we cannot execute, and we are recalling him. The same remarks applies to our Buenos Aires representative. It is impossible for us to continue trading if our office, and particularly our shipping clerks are withdrawn. – Yours faithfully C H Briggs, Sec. Sir Titus Salt, Bart., Sons and Co., Ltd.\n\nAfter that letter, proceeded the clerk, he received notices of appeal to go to the Central Appeal Tribunal to object to the decision of the Shipley Tribunal. The appeals were in respect of Mr J H N Roberts, Mr P Gordon Baker and Mr James Arthur Midgley. In the case of the first two, the Tribunal refused exemption, whilst in regard to the other he was granted exemption until May 1st. He had that day, in respect of those appeals, received the following letter from Sir James Roberts, Bart. :-\n\nMilner Field, Bingley March 2nd, 1916\n\nDear Mr Lindow, - I was asked this morning if I had any objection to the letter written by Mr Briggs on the 28th ult. going into the newspapers. Not having seen the letter since it was written, I had not a clear idea of its contents, and I sent word to the mill asking for a copy, which I have before me.\n\nSince that was written a notice of appeal has been given, and should the decision of your Tribunal be upheld, the letter will again apply. It must not be thought that the decision to close down has been lightly come to. It has taken too many years of laborious effort to build up a business like ours for that to be the case.\n\nThere is no unwillingness on my son’s part to serve. Early on in the war he pressed me hard to consent to his enlistment. I pointed out to him that that was impossible, that if I could not have my frequent holidays in Scotland I could not do my work, and if he were not at Saltaire the business would have to shut down.\n\nI was warned two years ago by Dr Brein Russell that I must take my holidays if I wished to continue long in business, and at the same time he told me that humanly speaking I could with care expect a long life. I said I was anxious to live, to bridge over the interval until my two grandsons could take a hand in my business. If this prospect was removed, one of the main incentives would be gone.\n\nYou must not take this appeal that it is to be made as being made by my son. It is being made for my benefit, for the benefit of Saltaire, and of the country. My son says that two members of your Tribunal are West Ward, and therefore Saltaire representatives on the District Council and he assumes that in voting against exemption in his case, they consider that they are acting in accordance with desires of the Saltaire people. I think we have shown no disinclination to do our bit.\n\nAt the beginning of the war when we were on short time, we intimated that the rent collector would not be paying any calls, and no arrears of rent would accrue. We promised that in cases where heads of families were in service, the income of the family would be maintained. Since October 1914, my place in Scotland has been given over to the reception of wounded soldiers at my own entire cost.\n\nMr Briggs’ letter of the 28th ult. looks rather bald. I am informed that its contents were widely known within an hour or two after it was written. You may cause that letter to be published if you think any useful object is to be attained, but if you do, let the contents of this letter be published along with it in their entirety.\n\nI learned of the decision of your Tribunal with much surprise, as Mr Burton had told me that the Advisory Committee (including himself) were unanimous that my son’s was a case for exemption.\n\nI ought to have been present at the Guildhall meeting yesterday, but instead I was forced home by ominous premonitions of pneumonia. I have read the speeches made there, through the whole of which the importance is insisted upon, not only of providing the men, but of keeping up our industries.\n\nThe necessity of closing down at Saltaire I contemplate with horror, the loss would be enormous, to me and others, and I need hardly say that physical limitations are the only ones that could cause this step to be taken. What I wish to do is to clear myself of responsibility for taking such a step.\n\nYours very truly, JAMES ROBERTS\n\nP.S. – I am rather tired with writing this letter – too tired to take a copy of it. May I ask you to be good enough to let me have a typed copy.\n\nThe Clerk added that copies of the first letter had been sent to the London Authorities, but no reply had yet been received.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd observed that the receipt of the letters did not affect that Tribunal at all. They had made their decision according to the evidence placed before them and to the best of their judgement, and the matter was finished so far as they were concerned.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes said that if there was an appeal to the Central Tribunal it would be necessary for the Tribunal to state on the application form the reasons for their refusal of the application at Shipley.\n\nThe Clerk: These appeals are here, and this Tribunal before separating tonight will have to decide upon the reasons for the decision before the reasons for the decision before these forms can be sent to London.\n\nThe Chairman: I take it that after all the talk there has been, these two letters should be published.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: I take it they will be published.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: There is no objection.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: The letters have nothing to do with our work, and when that is done our responsibility finishes.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: We have no power to reconsider anything now.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: We have no power nor any desire.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: Even if we had, we have no power.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: There was no dissentient voice. The Tribunal was absolutely unanimous in arriving at the decision.\n\nThe Chairman: I quite agree with what Councillor Learoyd says. We have done our work to the best of our ability, and we cannot undo it now. The letters have now been read, and I propose that they be handed to the Press.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: I second that with pleasure.\n\nThe Chairman: That they be given to the Press to do what they like with them.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: I think they ought to be handed over. It makes no difference to us what the Press do with them.\n\nSir James Roberts and His Son\n\n(Report in the Yorkshire Evening Post – Wednesday 29 March)\n\nA good deal of interest centres in the appeal of Mr J H N Roberts which came before the Appeal Tribunal of the West Central District of the West Riding of Yorkshire at Bradford this afternoon.\n\nMr Roberts, who is the son of Sir James Roberts, is managing director of the firm of Sir Titus Salt, Bart., Sons and Co. (Ltd.), of Saltaire Mills, which employ some 2,500 people and pay something like £10,000 per annum in rates to the Shipley District Council. Over a month ago a claim was laid before the Shipley Military Tribunal, which refused the application.\n\nMr C H Briggs, who made the application at the Shipley Tribunal a month ago, said that Mr Roberts, in addition to being managing director, was also manager of the wool department and of the dress goods and linings department.\n\nSir James Roberts in a letter to the Tribunal said: “There is no unwillingness on my son’s part to serve. Early on in the war he pressed me hard to consent to his enlistment. I pointed out to him that that was impossible, that is I could not have my frequent holidays in Scotland I could not do my work, and if he were not at Saltaire the business would have to shut down. You must not take this appeal that is to be made as being made by my son. It is being made for my benefit, for the benefit of Saltaire and of the country.\n\nI think we have shown no disinclination to do our bit. At the beginning of the war, when we went on short time, we intimated that the rent collector would not be paying any calls, and no arrears of rent would accrue. We promised that in cases where heads of families were in service, the income of the family would be maintained. Since October 1914, my place in Scotland has been given over to the reception of wounded soldiers at my own entire cost.”\n\nSir James Roberts in making the appeal to-day, said that having regard to the publicity which had been given the given to the case, and to certain allegations which had been made against himself, he should be glad to make a short statement.\n\nAt the present time, when most people were doing everything possible, and were given their best in order to win this war, he had felt the allegations rather severely to the effect that he had threatened to close the Saltaire works if his son was not relieved from military service. He need hardly say that unless he thought his son indispensable to the Saltaire business his son would have enlisted a year ago.\n\nSir James said he observed to his son at the time that he would not deserve the name of Englishman if he was not anxious to go to into the Army at that time. But without his son’s assistance it would be impossible for him to carry on the business at Saltaire. During the previous two tears he had found it necessary, in order to keep himself fit, and in condition, to spend something like one third of that time in Scotland.\n\nSir James said the he had difficulty in persuading his son that it was his duty to give up the idea of enlisting, which he did with considerable reluctance. When the group system was adopted, his son said he supposed there would be no objection to his attesting, and Sir James agreed; and his son attested within a few days of the adoption of the system.\n\nWhen the application for exemption came before the Advisory Committee, which was composed of gentlemen all over the Shipley Parliamentary Division, Sir James saw the military representative within a few days after the meeting, at which the application was considered, and he was informed there was no demur on the part of any of the members of the Committee that his son was indispensable to the business. These representations he supposed would be made to the Shipley Tribunal, and Sir James considered the matter so far as any suspense or anxiety as to what would happen to his son was at an end, because under Rule 17 –\n\nThe military representative at this point interrupted, and asked Sir James to confine himself to the facts of the case.\n\nSir James, proceeding, said he was asked, after the application had been refused by the Shipley Tribunal, what was to be done in the case of additional applications for exemptions that would shortly come before the Tribunal, and he told Mr Briggs that, having regard to the fact that his son was called up on the 8th of March, they might be withdrawn. He told Mr Briggs that he could not carry on the business without his son, and that he could repeat that if he thought proper to the Shipley Tribunal.\n\nAt this point, the military representative suggested that he should examine Mr Roberts, who stated that in the original notice the claim was that he was in a reserved occupation, but the appeal notice was on different lines.\n\nMr Roberts said he was 29 years of age, and had been in his father’s business for 12 years, holding a responsible position for eight years. He was an active managing director.\n\nThe Military Representative: Do you consider in the national interests that it is necessary for you to remain with your father?\n\nMr Roberts: Yes\n\nThe Military Representative: Would it be possible to carry on your father’s business, if you were not there?\n\nMr Roberts: I don’t think so. It usually depends on my father’s health.\n\nThe Military Representative: Is your father not in good health?\n\nMr Roberts: Not particularly.\n\nThe Military Representative: Does your father regularly attend the business?\n\nMr Roberts: He is at the mill about two-thirds of the year.\n\nThe Military Representative: Do you regularly attend the Saltaire mills?\n\nMr Roberts: Yes\n\nThe Military Representative: What holidays are you in the habit of taking?\n\nMr Roberts: A fortnight in September and probably another seven or eight days.\n\nThe Military Representative: To come down to the bed rock, are you indispensable in the business or are you not? Are you the controlling mind when your father is not at the works?\n\nMr Roberts: Yes\n\nThe Military Representative: But your father is only away for about three months in the year?\n\nMr Roberts: Four\n\nThe Military Representative: Would it not be possible for your father at a time like this not to go away for so long?\n\nMr Roberts: I don’t think so.\n\nAnother member questioned Mr Roberts, who said there were two directors of the firm, his father and himself. He agreed that was less than the usual number in a large firm.\n\nAnother member: You say that no efficient substitute could be obtained to take your place?\n\nMr Roberts: Yes\n\nAnother member: Why do you say that?\n\nMr Roberts: It would take considerable training.\n\nAnother member: But there are people in the mill who know the work besides you?\n\nMr Roberts: No, not the work, the general supervision.\n\nAnother member: They could easily learn it?\n\nMr Roberts: I don’t think so.\n\nAnother member: Is there any serious hardship to yourself or the firm if you left?\n\nMr Roberts: I would not suffer myself, but the business would lack control.\n\nThe Tribunal retired to consider a batch of cases, including Mr Roberts’s, and on returning to court they intimated that no statement was to be made as to the result of appeals in individual cases.\n\n(Author’s note – The tribunal was presided over by Mr Duncan Law and the Military Representative was Second Lieutenant E M Molesworth.)\n\nAppeal Refused\n\n(Report in the Yorkshire Post – Thursday 30 March)\n\nThough the decision was not officially announced separately, our Bradford correspondent understands that the tribunal refused Mr Roberts’ appeal. As no application was made for leave to make further appeal in case of an adverse decision, it is assumed that further application will have to be made if another appeal is to be made.\n\nMrs Skirrow, who lives with her parents, Mr and Mrs H Wainwright, of 7 Dove Street, has received intimation of the death of her husband, Harry Skirrow. He was with the 20th West Yorkshire Regiment and he died from injuries accidently received when training at a grenade school.\n\nCorporal Skirrow, who was 24 years of age, and joined his regiment a year ago, had previously served for five years in the Shipley detachment of the Royal Army Medical Corps. His wife is left with two little children. He was formerly employed by Messrs. Waite Bros., painters, of Shipley, from whom the widow has received a letter of sympathy.\n\nHis last letter home, posted the day before he met his death, and addressed to his wife stated that he had been moved up the line some 12 miles. He added:-\n\n“I am on the firing line, but at present am going through a course of bombing behind the trenches. The farmers go on working within three-quarters of a mile from the firing line as if nothing was amiss and the big guns boom out and shake the whole country-side. It is rare fun to watch old Fritz trying to bring our airman down, and every shot they fire is further off than the previous one.\n\nI am in danger, but cheer up I know God will watch over me and bring me safely back to ‘Blighty’ . I am all right so far.\n\nYou know what thunder is like; well it is a thousand times worse than that out here. The first time you hear the noise of the guns it makes you shake all over like a leaf, but you soon get used to it.\n\nIt is funny that when a man is in danger his thoughts fly straight to his loved ones at home, and many a man gets down and prays – men even who never think of when at home, and those who think there is no God want to come out here. It will be soon be proved to them there is. The war will be over this summer, and with a bit of luck I will be soon back in ‘Blighty’ .”\n\nThe Rev. F G Goddard (the chaplain of the battalion) writing to Mrs Skirrow says:-\n\n“I may be the first to write to you the sad news of the death of your poor husband Corporal H Skirrow. Apparently he came out her as one of a new draft and was attached to the 12th West Yorkshire battalion, of which I am chaplain. The poor fellow was killed at the grenade school on Thursday (May 4th) through an accidental explosion. The funeral took place at 5.15 pm., and I officiated at the last rites.\n\nYour address was found among his letters. Whenever possible I write myself to the relatives. Poor souls! You must have had an anxious time, and must have often have dreaded the arrival of such a letter as this. I write to tell the relatives what I can and to assure them that though away from home their dear ones are looked after, and given every sympathetic attention.\n\nIt is additionally sad when our poor boys get killed in this way, but still you must always realise for your comfort that he did his duty and died doing it, and one cannot do more. He was new to the battalion, so I had not got to know him beyond perhaps a general glimpse. Still he was one of “ours”. In all sincerity I pray that God’s presence and comfort may be with you in this, your hour of trial. I can write from experience of the staying and steadying power of the realisation of the presence of Christ in times of stress and danger. I have so often seen it, and may you experience it too.”\n\nSergeant J O’Brien wrote:-\n\n“It is, with deepest regret I send a few details concerning the unfortunate accident which befell your husband. He was at the bombing school receiving instruction in grenade-throwing when a grenade exploded and killed him instantly.\n\nIt was my sad duty to convey his body to the camp, where he received a soldier’s funeral. I can assure you that everyone here and at the school express their deep sympathy with you. Although accidently killed, he gave his life none the less for his country. He could have done no more had he been killed actually in the firing line. He was buried with full military honours, comrades from various units acting as mourners.”\n\nIn moving the minutes of the School Staff Sub-Committee, Councillor F Rhodes referred to the fact that an epidemic of diphtheria had broken out in the in the neighbourhood of the Albert Road Council School in Saltaire. On visiting the school he found that five cases had occurred in one class, a fact which he considered rather singular.\n\nThe sub-committee had been in consultation with the Medical Officer of Health (Dr Foster), and in consequence the whole class of forty-five scholars had been sent home, and the classroom was isolated.\n\nThe epidemic had caused quite an alarm in the neighbourhood, and several of the mothers had taken their children away from the school. In addition to the forty-five sent home, thirty had been taken away by their parents.\n\nAn impression had got abroad that the school was going to be closed until after the Whitsuntide holidays, but that was not correct. At the same time the committee would have seriously to consider the advisability of closing the school if any more cases were reported. As they had all occurred in one classroom, it made one think the condition of the classroom was largely the cause of the outbreak. Some of the scholars had sisters in other classes, who were in their usual health.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the children had died. The sub-committee had taken what steps they could to prevent the spread of the epidemic, and if they were not sufficient, more drastic action would be taken.\n\nCouncillor Doyle: Will the classroom be closed until after the holidays?\n\nThe Chairman replied that it would be closed to the children. As soon as the matter was brought to his notice, the classroom was immediately closed. It was not known really that the classroom was at fault, and it ought to be possible to find out what was the cause of the outbreak. If the room was not at fault, it should be cleared of any suspicions. It was better that the outbreak should have been confined to one classroom, than have the whole school affected. It was only natural that the parents should be alarmed.\n\nCouncillor Doyle wanted to know how many scholars there were in the class that was affected.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: Forty-Five.\n\nCouncillor Doyle: Is that the exact number? I have heard today that the class is much larger, and that there were about 60 scholars attending. It was only a small room.\n\nCounty Alderman Dunn remarked that he was glad the outbreak was confined to one class, and he did not think the infection came from the classroom. There was an outbreak not many miles away from Shipley, some months previously, and in the schools in the area affected, every child had a swab taken from its throat, this being sent to the bacteriologist at Wakefield. If Dr Foster would do the same in the present instance, it might be possible to prevent the spread of the epidemic. It should be done without the slightest delay and investigations should be made with respect to the sanitary conditions of the houses in which the children lived.\n\nWhatever the cause was, it must be traced and stopped. There was nothing wrong with the classroom and he did not think there was any risk of any of the children still attending the school being affected.\n\nMiss Unwin said it was a very serious matter. All the pens and pencils ought to be burned, for the disease was largely spread by contact. One child would put a pen or pencil in its mouth, and then another child would do the same thing afterwards. That was how the disease was spread. The same remarks applied to the books which had been used. The children wet their fingers and turn the pages over. It was a bad habit amongst children, and matters of that nature should be looked into. The germs were not so much in the air as in the case of scarlet fever.\n\nIt was stated by the Chairman that steps were being taken to cope effectively with the epidemic.\n\nAt the last two sittings of the Shipley Tribunal there were forty-three cases down for hearing, including sixteen from Sir Titus Salt Bart., Sons and Co. Ltd., and eight from Windhill Co-operative Society which were considered in camera. Of the nineteen that remained, six made claim for exemption on conscientious grounds.\n\nThe first of these was William Lonsdale, a weaving overlooker, employed by Sir Titus Salt Bart., Sons and Co. Ltd. The applicant said that he appealed on conscientious grounds, and also for business reasons. His trade was in the reserve list.\n\nThe Chairman (Councillor Thomas Hill): The question of your being engaged in a reserved occupation rests with the Tribunal – Decidedly.\n\nAnd what about the other grounds – As a Christian I do not feel that I can bring myself to such a state of mind as to enable me to train in order to kill a fellowman.\n\nMr Burton (military representative): How long have you held these views – Practically all my life.\n\nYou have a wife and two children? – Yes\n\nWell would you not take any steps to defend your wife and children? – Yes I would.\n\nSupposing you were placed as our Allies in Belgium were placed and you had no chance, the power of the Germany being what it was and the villages and towns being over-run, would you invite them into your house or would you strive to protect your wife and children? – One can scarcely tell what one would do.\n\nWhat do you think you would do? – I would do my best to protect them.\n\nThat is all you are asked to do now – It is a different thing altogether. You are asking me to prepare myself to slay my fellow men.\n\nNo it is making yourself fit to protect them – I am not going to prepare beforehand for an emergency of that kind. I believe if everybody would accept my views such wars as this would not be possible.\n\nBut you see they have not accepted your views. The country is in danger, and the Germans have not accepted your views. On the contrary they have been preparing for war during 30 years. Do you seriously tell the Tribunal that, as an Englishman, you wish to remain at home in England enjoying the freedom of an Englishman and will not lend a hand to those hundreds of thousands of men who are fighting your battles and mine today?\n\nThe Applicant: I think I am lending a hand in trying to create a better opinion. I have nothing more to say.\n\nThe Chairman: Are you basing your appeal on your conscientious objection or on your trade? – No, I am claiming for –\n\nThe Chairman (interrupting): Either yes or no.\n\nThe Applicant: Well, I am claiming on both grounds.\n\nMr Burton: Your business claim is not before the Tribunal.\n\nThe Chairman: Your appeal will be refused, and you will be sent to non-combatant service.\n\nThe applicant was in accordance with his request handed an appeal form.\n\nHerbert Bayliffe, a weaving overlooker, also employed at Saltaire Mills, sought exemption for conscientious reasons.\n\nThe Chairman: How long have you held these views? – Oh, a good many years. I was brought up with them.\n\nMr Burton: You heard the questions I asked Mr Lonsdale? – Yes, sir.\n\nDo you feel the same conscientious objections to taking part in helping your country? – Yes\n\nAre you married? – Yes.\n\nHow would it be with regard to your own household? Do you think there was ever a better time when man could use the muscle and strength that God had given him, than when he is called upon to defend those who are near and dear to him? Do you think God has given you muscles in order that you may stand by and see how other people use theirs? – They are not to fight with.\n\nYou have made up your mind? – Oh yes.\n\nI suggest that the Tribunal find you some work that will give you an opportunity of using your muscles while the other men are fighting.\n\nThe Chairman: Your appeal is refused, but you will be given a certificate for non-combatant service – Can I have an appeal form please?\n\nYes, but I should like it to be understood that it is not necessary for us to give those forms when asked for. The Tribunal have the power to refuse to do so if they think fit.\n\nJames Ince, employed at Saltaire Mills as a spinning overlooker, asked the Tribunal to excuse him from serving with the colours because of his conscientious objections to war. He had been teaching children a knowledge of Jesus Christ he said, and to take up arms would be inconsistent with that teaching. In his opinion the Tribunal would be acting disloyalty to the country if they sent conscientious objectors to the army. In any case he would not kill; he could not after the stand he had taken during his life. Furthermore, if he had to attend a military or civil court, he would be obliged to swear by the Bible, the latter, however told him he had not to –\n\nMr Burton (interrupting): I would not go into that sort of thing I were you for everybody who has read the Bible knows that a very large part of the Old Testament describes the courage and soldiery qualities of the Jews – I was referring to the New Testament.\n\nYou said the Bible – Further I have a pledge which I took in the presence of 400 men to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. If you would like to see it, it is there.\n\nNo, I do not want to appear to be wanting in respect to your conscientious objections. I would like you to look at the matter for a moment in this light. You are living in England and earning your living in England – I suppose.\n\nAs a Christian you have been taking sufficient interest in your country’s affairs to know that there is a terrible war going on – Yes.\n\nYou know how the war arose, and what the result will be if we are not successful along with our Allies in beating the enemy. You know that, and you also know that hundreds of thousands of men answered the call of their country and are now fighting on the battlefield like men. Others who are not fighting, are doing work of national importance while you remain here gathering your living as usual. Christians always show gratitude. How do you wish to show as a Christian that you appreciate the efforts of those who are maintaining the safety and freedom of this country? – I cannot take part in killing.\n\nMr Burton (interrupting): Then what else would you do? – To go into the R.A.M.C. would be to pass under military authority. I am quite willing as a Christian to give up my present occupation if the Tribunal consider it is not of national importance, and help to nurse soldiers who have been discharged from the army. Once these soldiers are well again they can re-enter the army and I shall not be responsible.\n\nMr Burton: There are plenty of ways in which you can serve, but the man who wants to tell himself what he has to do, and when he has to do it, is not of much use. When the country is in straits and fighting for its life, there must be some organisation, and it cannot be left to you or any other Christian, to say what you will do. You must be told like thousands of others. You are asked to do work which is not killing, and suggest the Tribunal should ask you to join the army.\n\nThe Applicant: You have not said whether my work is of national importance or not yet.\n\nDo you appeal on business grounds? – I claim as a conscientious objector, but my work is of national importance. I should not have a conscience if I refused to do work which the tribunal thinks is of national importance.\n\nThe Chairman: Your appeal will be postponed to November 1st seeing that you are engaged as a spinning overlooker.\n\nA meeting of the Shipley Military Tribunal was held at Somerset House last Friday evening. The applications included the following from employees at Saltaire Mills:-\n\nJames Ince, described as a spinning overlooker, based his appeal on conscientious grounds, and added he was employed upon work of national importance. A previous application had been granted on business grounds. (Colin’s note see diary 21 July 1916).\n\nThe Chairman: Have you been medically examined?\n\nThe applicant: No\n\nThe Chairman: You are still in the same occupation?\n\n– Yes\n\nMr Burton: Although you are a conscientious objector, you will quite understand that the country has a claim now upon the services of every man of military age? – I would rather not discuss the war, Mr Burton.\n\nHave you ever thought of the war at all? I do not wish to show any disrespect to your conscientious objections, but I want you to tell the tribunal how you can do your “bit” as the phrase it. Have you made any sacrifices?\n\n– My life has been all sacrifice. It has never been anything else.\n\nMr Burton: But that does not answer my question. Have you thought of any way in which you can do your “bit” along with the millions of others who are now making sacrifices of all kinds in the trenches? – According to Tribunal’s decision on my last appeal, they decision was I was engaged upon work of national importance. Therefore as a conscientious objector I appeal on grounds of national importance.\n\nI wish you would answer my question. I asked you to tell me of the way in which you can take your place alongside the thousands of men and woman throughout the United Kingdom, who are making sacrifices to for their country. Have you thought it worthwhile to consider the matter? – I stated on my last appeal that I did not.\n\nMr Burton: I will not trouble you anymore.\n\nThe Chairman: You state here one or two reasons, but the point is are you claiming on conscientious grounds, or on the occupation you are in? – I am claiming under the provisions of the Military Services Act. It distinctly states that a conscientious objector – Councillor Rhodes (interposing): We want an answer, yes or no. We get no nearer to an answer.\n\n– Oh yes we do. Under the Military Service Act, and also on account of my work, which is of national importance I claim exemption. I am still in the same occupation for which I was given postponement before.\n\nMr Burton: It was granted upon the firm’s application – No it was not\n\nAre you sure?\n\n– My appeal was made under the Military Service Act.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: What are you claiming on now? – As a conscientious objector, and on account of my work.\n\nThe Chairman: No that is not the point\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: You are wanting to appeal on both. Will you take one or the other?\n\n– I am taking the Military Services Act.\n\nCouncillor Rhodes: You want both.\n\nMr Burton: I ask the Tribunal to study the natural interests in either case. Whether you claim as a conscientious objector, or as a being in a certified trade, it is immaterial. I put it to the Tribunal that the needs of the nation over-ride both.\n\nCouncillor Doyle (addressing the applicant): You have just said that when you before the Tribunal on the last occasion, they gave you exemption because they were engaged upon work of national importance.\n\n– The applicant: Yes, I said that in my appeal.\n\nCouncillor Doyle: Then why have you found it necessary to do anything further than appeal on those grounds now?\n\n– I have entered my appeal according to instruction, and it is left for you to judge. I have a few words to add, if you will allow me.\n\nMr Burton: Yes if you have any facts.\n\n– I was going to say that since my last appeal I have had two managers from other firms, who have promised me exemption, and one has promised me 6s a week more.\n\nMr Burton: Promised you exemption! Will you give me the gentlemen’s name?\n\n– I shall give you no names.\n\nMr Burton: In any case, I will make a note of it, and if it is required, will you substantiate that statement?\n\n– Well, they promised to appeal (laughter).\n\nMr Burton: Ah! That is different. It is no use saying anything more. I wish you would try to be frank. Whether you are a conscientious objector and engaged in a reserved occupation or not, you are certainly not frank. I am not going to trouble you further. For you to say that someone has promised to get to you exempted, and then to say that someone has promised to appeal for you, are two different things.\n\nThe Chairman: Your appeal will be refused, but you will be granted a certificate for non-combatant service only.\n\nThe applicant intimated that he would appeal against the decision of the local Tribunal.\n\nApplication was made by the firm of Sir Titus Salt Bart, Sons and Co. Ltd., for Thomas Arthur Briggs, described as the foreman over the wool department. Mr Charles Briggs, father of Thomas and a manager at the Saltaire Mills made the application. He said that he had been unable to bring T. M. Briggs with him, as he was at the London Wool Sales. In this case exemption was asked for until Jan 1st.\n\nHe (Charles Briggs) had been instructed by Sir James Roberts to tell the Tribunal that firm had wired off to Port Elizabeth in South Africa to release T. M. Briggs, their wool buyer. The latter had received the wire and had replied that he would return to England at the earliest opportunity, which would not be before the end of the year. When this man arrived, Thomas Arthur Briggs would join the army. He would give the Tribunal an undertaking that his son should join up on January 1st.\n\nPostponed to Dec 31st.\n\n(Colin’s note – we have no record of whether Thomas joined the army or not.)\n\nThe decisions of other cases from workers at Saltaire Mills were as follows:-\n\nAlfred Bartle, a plumber – adjourned a week\n\nA Wigglesworth, warp twister – Feb 20th.\n\nThe death took place on Thursday last of Mr William Fry, who for forty years, was chief librarian at the Saltaire Institute. Born in May 1837, he was in eightieth year, and not until less than three years ago did he fail to carry out his duties at the Saltaire Institute. He lost the sight of the left eye, and resigned his office, but in view of his long service and accumulated experience, he was given a position by the Shipley District Council as consulting librarian. In the meantime his strength had gradually failed and yesterday morning, about an hour after he had partaken of breakfast, he passed away.\n\nMr Fry was the son of Mr Humphrey Fry of Wellington (Somerset). He came first to Otley, where he was employed on the railway. There he was brought into association with Mr John Scriven, who pointed out to Mr Titus Salt the qualifications of Mr Fry for the management of the fine educational trust which was being established by Sir Titus Salt. From that time forward, Mr Fry was closely associated with all the educational affairs of Saltaire – the High schools, the Institute and the Technical School. For a considerable period he also discharged the secretarial duties of Sir Titus Salt’s Charity.\n\nDuring comparative recent years, in which the management of educational affairs has been passing through various changes, there have been consequent alterations at Saltaire. For a time Mr Fry retained secretarial control at the High schools, then later the whole of the educational affairs of Saltaire passed into the hands of the Shipley Educational Committee, with Mr Popplestone as secretary and Director of Education. Mr Fry, however, continued to render useful service at the Institute.\n\nMr Fry married Miss Mary A Dunn, also of Wellington. There are five sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Mr Arthur Fry, is an artist in at Belfast; Mr Ernest Fry is in business in London; Dr Percy Fry is in practice at Sowerby Bridge; Mr Clifford Fry is secretary of Messrs John V Goodwin and Co., Bradford; and the Rev Cecil Fry is curate of Beeston (Notts.).\n\nAt the meeting of the Shipley Educational Committee on Tuesday, Councillor C E Learoyd (chairman), made a reference to the death of Mr William Fry. The deceased gentleman’s work had been the subject of satisfaction to those who had employed him in a public capacity. All were sorry he had been taken away even though he was ripe in years and full of honours. He moved that a letter of condolence be sent to the relatives. The members signified their approval of the resolution by rising in their places.\n\nMr B Allsop, chairman of the Governors of Sir Titus Salt’ Hospital alluded sympathetically at a meeting of that body on Wednesday night to the death of Mr William Fry, who was for many years secretary to the Governors. Although, he said, Mr Fry had reached a ripe age, the Governors, he was sure were all very sorry to learn of the death of an old servant who had done so much useful and conscientious work for the town for over forty years. The family, he was sure, would have the deep sympathy of every member of the Board.\n\nCouncillor E Cowgill (chairman) at the last meeting of the Libraries’ Committee, pointed out that Mr Fry had held a public position in the town for the past 44 years, and been in the service of the Council since 1902. He referred in appreciative terms of the way in which Mr Fry had served the town in various capacities, and he moved an instruction to the clerk to forward a resolution of sympathy with the family on the death of Mr Fry. The resolution was unanimously agreed to by the members signifying their by rising in their places.\n\nThe funeral took place at Nab Wood Cemetery, on Saturday afternoon. The service was conducted by the Rev P Drummond Pringle, pastor of the Saltaire Congregational Church.\n\nThe principal mourners were Mrs G L Armstrong and Miss Fry (daughters), Mr W Arthur Fry, Mr Ernest B Fry, Dr. Percy V Fry, Mr E Clifford Fry and the Rev G Cecil Fry (sons), Mr G L Armstrong (son in law), Mrs E C Fry (daughter in law), Mr Alfred Marshall (Otley), Miss Brearley (housekeeper), Nurse Henslaer, and Miss Bell (for many years chief assistant at the Shipley Libraries).\n\nThe monthly meeting of the Sir Titus Salt’s Hospital Board was held at the Hospital on Wednesday evening, Mr B Allsop (chairman) presiding and others present were Miss Dunn, Councillor C E Learoyd, Mrs Frances Lister, Mr Walker Cryer, Mr E L Baumann, Mr Clifford Fry (hon sec) and Mr Thomas Luxton (clerk).\n\nIt was stated in the monthly report that the number of out-patients at the last meeting was 56 and in-patients 20. There had since been admitted 22, making a total of 42, of whom 20 had been discharged, leaving 22 in hospital up to date.\n\nThere has been some difficulty in obtaining a sufficient quantity of sugar, and the members were advised to get in touch with the Royal Commission. Articles had been given to the Hospital as follows:-\n\nThe Windhill Spiritualist Church, rest chair\n\nBritish Red Cross Society, 36 rugs, to be used in place of blankets\n\nMr Coulter, Nab Lodge, large turkey\n\nSir James Roberts, none couples of rabbits\n\nMrs Clifford Roberts, two fowls\n\nA Large number of gifts had also been sent in, and a full list supplied to the Soldiers’ Comforts Sub-Committee.\n\nApplication was made by a ward maid for war bonus.\n\nIn the general accounts it was reported that the Hospital Sunday collections were:-\n\nSt Peter’s Church, £2 2s.\n\nProvidence Wesleyans, £2\n\nBethel Baptist Church, 11s\n\nRosse St. Baptist Church, 11s\n\nTotal £5 18s\n\nFrom the following employees:-\n\nT Webster and Co., £1\n\nSir Titus Salt Bart., Sons and Co. Ltd., £9 11s 2d\n\nMessrs. Lee and Crabtree, £1 5s\n\nTotal £11s 16s 2d.\n\nOther donations were:-\n\nI.O.O.F. (M.U.), Shipley, £7 7s\n\nMrs A Northrop, £5\n\nCryer Bros., £1 1s\n\nTotal £13 8s.\n\nThere was a grand total of £31 2s 2d.\n\n(Colin’s note - £31 is worth c£2.5k in 2016)\n\nMiss Dunn pointed out that whilst the members of the Ladies Committee had decided not to provide a bottle of rum for the inmates of the hospital for Christmas Day, one had been secured.\n\nThe Chairman: Well, it is the usual thing.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd said the question was one of principal and if the Ladies’ Committee had agreed not to supply the rum, the officials of the hospital had no right to over-ride that decision.\n\nMr Baumann: But you would not spoil the Christmas dinner, would you?\n\nCouncillor Learoyd said it made no difference to the principle involved whether the puddings were spoiled or not. When the members of a committee had spent their time voluntarily in considering a question, their decision ought to be respected. It was not a matter of whether or not the supplying of rum was advisable or inadvisable, when the Board had said that rum should not be supplied, it should have never been supplied.\n\nMr Baumann said that rum was absolutely essential for Christmas puddings and mince pies, and no doubt the matron had thought the committee had overlooked the item.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd said in doing so on her own the matron would be doing so on her own responsibility, and the Board should have an explanation of the whole matter.\n\nMr Fry said that the explanation given to him was that Mrs Northrop had handed the matron £5 with the observation that £3 was to be placed in the hospital accounts, and the rest could be disposed of as she (the matron) thought fit. That being the case, the matron had bought a supply of rum. Mr Fry added that when the committee had decided not to supply the rum their ruling should have been obeyed.\n\nThe Chairman remarked that the matron could have obtained the rum in some other way. It was customary to supply rum every year.\n\nMr Baumann repeated that the rum was absolutely essential.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd protested that when the committee had decided against rum the officials had no business to run counter to their orders. He would refuse to sit on a committee if what was passed was not carried out.\n\nMr Baumann said that doubtless the matron thought the committee had overlooked the item.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: She is not paid for thinking in that way. She is paid for doing as she is told.\n\nMr Baumann said the matron was not, and should not be, an automaton.\n\nMr Cryer said that if the matron had received the balance of the £5 referred to, to spend as she wished, she was quite in order in spending it as she had done.\n\nMr Baumann said he held no brief for the matron, but they would all agree that she filled the position splendidly. If they continued giving those little “pin-pricks,” they might be losing her someday, and then it would be up with the whole show.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd said that should not alter the question. The Ladies’ Committee had the right to be obeyed.\n\nMr Baumann: She could have kept the money.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd said if Mrs Northrop had given £5 on the stipulation that £2 of it might be used for some other purpose than given to the hospital funds, the amount should not have appeared in the accounts.\n\nThe Chairman said he did not exonerate the matron from blame. She should have carried through the decision of the Ladies Committee.\n\nMr Baumann: You must give her a little latitude.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: I should not bother anymore\n\nMr Baumann said it would not look like Christmas without a drop of rum.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: Then move a vote of censure upon the Ladies Committee\n\nMr Baumann: Very well, I will do; they deserve it.\n\nMiss Dunn said that many of the wounded soldiers were mere boys.\n\nMr Baumann said the men in the trenches received half a tumblerful of rum every day, and the drop they would get in the hospital would not hurt them.\n\nThe Chairman said the rum was used for cooking purposes.\n\nMr Baumann observed that the Ladies should not have decided against supplying the rum.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: In that case the Ladies Committee was wrong, and the matron was right (laughter).\n\nMr Cryer moved that the accounts be passed subject to the matron being invited to discuss the question with the Board at the close of the public business.\n\nMr Baumann said that the Ladies Committee had done wrong in prohibiting rum.\n\nCouncillor Learoyd: You have no power to censure people who do public work without being paid for their services.\n\nThe motion was seconded by Mr Lister, who remarked that if anyone ordered poison without authority they should pay for it (laughter).\n\nThe motion was carried, Councillor Learoyd and Mr Baumann being the only dissentients."
