        "text": "Margot Asquith was the sharp-tongued and provocative turn-of-the-century British socialite who married (and scandalized) British Prime Minister HH Asquith.\n\n1. She Was Scathing—And Doomed\n\nMargot Asquith was the British socialite whose quick wit and caustic sense of humor burned through Victorian high society with the fury of a scandal through the tabloids. Even her marriage to the future British Prime Minister HH Asquith couldn’t muzzle her controversial mouth. No amount of wit, however, could save her from a tragic ending.\n\n2. She Had A Charmed Childhood\n\nEmma Margaret Tennant (aka Margot) had a charmed life from the beginning. She was born in Peeblesshire, Scotland in February of 1864 as the sixth daughter and eleventh child of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet. Growing up in the picturesque family estate, The Glen, her childhood was basically one never-ending party.\n\n3. Her Life Was One Big Party\n\nMargot and her sisters entertained her father’s guests at The Glen in what became epic soirées of the Victorian Era. Famously, writer and socialite Mary Gladstone described the Tennant’s evening parties as “the maddest, merriest whirl from morn til night”. Growing up in that party atmosphere, it’s little wonder that Margot was the troublesome kind of child she was.\n\n4. She Craved Adventure\n\nThe Glen was a wild place with sprawling grounds just begging to be explored. And explore them, Margot did. Her contemporaries described her as a “venturesome child” who often set off on her own “roaming the moors” and “climbing to the top of the roof by moonlight”. She even rode her horse right up the front steps of The Glen.\n\nSadly, she would have to leave her open-air playground behind.\n\n5. She Made Her Big Debut\n\nAs Margot aged into a charming young woman, she had to take her place in society. As such, Margot and her sister/best friend, Laura, moved to London after their father bought a house in prestigious Grosvenor Square. However, he could take the girl out of The Glen, but he couldn’t take The Glen out of the girl. Margot was about to set London society on fire.\n\n6. She Had Many Proposals\n\nWith their wild, untamed spirits, both Margot and Laura became prominent figures in London society. Compared to the stale culture of Victorian society, Margot dazzled everyone with her wit, irreverence and charm. In fact, Lady Frances Balfour even said, “It was unnatural if every man did not propose to them after a few hours’ acquaintance”.\n\nMargot’s behavior, however, made marriage a little difficult.\n\n7. She Crashed The Gates\n\nMargot brought all of her wild ways from Then Glen to the front steps of London society—literally. Just as she had at The Glen, the brash young woman once rode her horse up the steps of her London townhome—and the consequences were disastrous.\n\nAfter crashing through the front door, the horse reared back, knocking down the chandelier and sending Margot flying. That was, somehow, not the most scandalous thing she had done.\n\n8. She Swore Like A Sailor\n\nFrom the minute she arrived in London, Margot upset just about every unspoken rule and turned London society on its head. A history professor remarked that Margot turned gender norms on their head with a careless ease by smoking and swearing “self-consciously and copiously”. Her wild ways attracted some very curious eyes.\n\n9. Her Sister Married First\n\nMargot famously “danced with the Prince of Wales” and “sat on Tennyson's knee”. However, despite both Tennant sisters being the toast of the town, it was Laura who managed to bag a husband first. She married Alfred Lyttelton in May 1885 at their family estate, The Glen. Margot’s happiness for her sister would be short-lived.\n\n10. She Lost Her Best Friend\n\nDuring Laura’s first pregnancy, Margot’s worst nightmares came true. Her sister complained about her health throughout the pregnancy, openly saying that she feared she wouldn’t survive it. Tragically, she was right. Eight days after she gave birth, Laura passed away. Then, two years later, Margot also lost her nephew. She found solace in a curious place.\n\n11. She Was Part Of A Gang\n\nReeling from the loss of her sister, Margot found comfort (and raucous good times) in the company of her friends and remaining sisters. The group coalesced after Laura’s passing, and developed something of a reputation. Before long, everyone in London society was referring to Margot’s new group as “the Gang”. But they were a lot more than that.\n\n12. She Was All About The Pleasure\n\nMargot’s new found friendships consisted of London’s finest aristocrats and intellectuals. William Scawen Blunt, a prominent poet and writer and frequent member of “the Gang”, described them as “a group of men and women bent on pleasure”. But Blunt wasn’t referring to the usual kinds of pleasure. The Gang was into something different.\n\n13. She Found Her Soul Mates\n\n“The Gang” developed a reputation for “pleasure of a superior kind”. They were, primarily, an intellectual group. In fact, their intellectualism earned them some criticism. Lord Charles Beresford famously complained, “You are always talking about your souls”.\n\nFrom then on, they became known as “The Souls”. But they pursued pleasures of the flesh as well.\n\n14. She Was Developing A Reputation\n\nAccording to Blunt, The Souls didn’t just focus on the pleasures of the mind. They pursued pleasures of the heart as well. He stated that the group looked for “their excitement in romance and sentiment”. In no time, The Souls and their most prominent members (ie, Margot) had developed something of scandalous reputation.\n\n15. She Was Fashionable\n\nWith her popularity in high society circles, Margot became a frequent figure in gossip columns. Most of the mentions of her name were positive and she was often described as “fashionable”. But not everyone had glowing things to write about her. In fact, she provided the rumor mill with tons of scandals to churn through.\n\n16. She Was A Social Climber\n\nThe gossip columns described Margot and her sisters as “social climbers” given that they were minor aristocrats. But the insults didn’t end there. Stories began circulating that Margot “[entertained] mixed company in her bedroom” with the tabloids describing her as “fast”. It would, however, take more than a few harsh words to shame Margot.\n\n17. She Did What She Wanted\n\nMargot resented the accusations about her, shall we say, “looseness” throughout her life. Despite this resentment, however, she never stopped doing what she wanted to do. She continued hosting guests behind closed doors well into the predawn hours. However, her scandalous reputation nearly cost her her chance at true love.\n\n18. She Found A Good Man\n\nIn early 1894, Margot became romantically entangled with the Liberal Member of Parliament and future prime minister, Herbert Henry Asquith (AKA, HH Asquith). The two had traveled in somewhat similar circles but Asquith had recently, tragically, become a widower. Far from appearing like a saving grace, Margot’s romance with Asquith scandalized high-society\n\n19. She Was Too Fast For Some\n\nMargot’s reputation as a somewhat “fast” society girl clashed with her new role as the fiancée of a serious politician—and put her romance in peril. Asquith’s friends and colleagues warned him against marrying her, saying that she would ultimately lead to his demise. (Spoiler alert: she would). Nevertheless, Margot and Asquith defied the odds in favor of love.\n\nBut she had some stiff competition.\n\n20. Her Husband Had A Harem\n\nIn all fairness, Margot wasn’t the only one in her new relationship with a reputation. Famously, Asquith also kept the company of many intellectual and beautiful women. But Margot never felt threatened by it. Using her acerbic wit, she dubbed these women Asquith’s “harem”. With self-deprecating humor in their hearts, the couple were ready for their happily ever after.\n\nThere were just five little problems.\n\n21. She Became A Mother\n\nMargot and Asquith got married in May 1894. For Margot, it would have been wedded bliss…had it not been for Asquith’s baggage. With a kiss on the lips and the stroke of a pen, she was no longer a carefree socialite. Thanks to the five children from Asquith’s previous marriage, Margot had become an “unenthusiastic” stepmother.\n\nHer new family didn’t exactly welcome her with open arms.\n\n22. She Was Like A Bird Of Paradise\n\nViolet Asquith, the youngest of Margot’s new stepchildren and her only stepdaughter, was the most taken aback by Margot’s arrival. “She flashed into our lives like some dazzling bird of paradise,” Violet later recalled. But it was far from paradise. In fact, Margot and Violet set off sparks in the Asquith household that threatened to burn the family down.\n\n23. She Caused A Storm\n\nHH Asquith lamented the often “stormy” relationship between his wife Margot and his children, with Violet in particular. As much as he loved Margot, he couldn’t deny that she wasn’t necessarily a great stepmother. He wrote that Margot and Violet were “on terms of chronic misunderstanding”. He wasn’t far off—and it made for a dramatic incident.\n\n24. She Made Everyone Uneasy\n\nDecades after Margot joined the Asquith family, Violet later claimed that she had always been somewhat uncomfortable around her stepmother. She said that the society woman left her “with a vague uneasiness as to what she might do next”. However, Violet wasn’t alone in that regard. Margot’s next startling move would have been anyone’s guess.\n\n25. She Was Too Opinionated\n\nMargot entered this new stage of her life as disruptively as she had entered London society more than a decade earlier. Asquith’s colleagues described Margot as being the opposite of what an MP’s wife should be, calling her “outgoing, impulsive, extravagant and opinionated”. But Margot was, above all else, a society woman.\n\nAnd she wasn’t about to let anyone forget it.\n\n26. She Became The Prime Wife\n\nWhen HH Asquith became Prime Minister in 1908, Margot Asquith moved with him into 10 Downing Street. But she stubbornly refused to give up her role as a glittering—if sometimes scathing—socialite. She was determined to maintain her role as a society woman above all else and continued hosting weekend soirées. Pretty soon, everyone wanted to dine with the Asquiths.\n\nBut not everyone could.\n\n27. She Hosted The Best Of The Best\n\nTo entertain her guests, Margot Asquith and her husband built a residence in Oxfordshire called The Wharf. Their infamous evening soirées became the meeting point for London’s leading “literary, artistic and political luminaries”.\n\nMuch to Asquith’s chagrin (and amusement), however, Margot simply couldn’t hold her tongue. And it was about to get them into trouble.\n\n28. She Didn’t Suffer Suffragettes\n\nMargot Asquith brought her scathing sense of wit and unpredictability with her into her husband’s staid world of politics. But her unconventional views didn’t always go down smoothly. Despite bucking conventional gender roles her whole life, Margot became one of the most powerful opponents to Women’s Suffrage.\n\nHer views rocked polite society.\n\n29. Her Opinions Were Controversial\n\nMargot never made any efforts to conceal her unpopular—but well-worded—opinions. But only her inner circle of British aristocracy ever knew what she thought. That is, until she wrote in a letter that “women have no reason, very little [humor], hardly any sense of [honor]...and no sense of proportion”. When her controversial words came out, it nearly cost her her life.\n\n30. Her Enemies Followed Her\n\nAs Margot’s opposition to Women’s Suffrage became public knowledge, she faced a new kind of danger. While vacationing in Clovelly Court, Devon with her husband, she nearly met her demise. Prominent suffragettes Elsie Howey, Jessie Kenney, and Vera Wentworth menacingly followed her around. No one could have predicted what they would do next.\n\n31. She Had Strange Gardeners\n\nThankfully, for Margot’s sake, it seems like the suffragettes who had been following her only had peaceful intentions. After tracking her back to her vacation residence, they hid in her garden and covered her plants with their movement’s colors: purple, white and green. Given what she did next, however, Margot was never scared anyway.\n\n32. She Thought Suffrage Was Funny\n\nIn 1911, Margot Asquith did something unprecedented for a prime minister’s wife; she attended one of the debates over women’s suffrage. She sat comfortably (and perhaps a little smugly) without saying a word and “seemed highly amused at the earnestness” of the suffragettes, arguing their case. Her haughtiness only made matters worse.\n\n33. She Was “Unpleasant And Sarcastic”\n\nMargot’s passive aggressive taunting of the suffragettes only made her and her husband’s position more difficult. Constance Lytton and Annie Kenney, two prominent suffragettes attending the 1911 debate, for example, had hoped to strike a conciliatory tone. By the end of the discussion, however, they called Margot “unpleasant and sarcastic”.\n\nIt sounds like Margot finally got the message.\n\n34. She Had To Travel In Secret\n\nThanks to her caustic wit and haughty attitude, Margot Asquith had to spend much of the rest of her time in 10 Downing Street dodging suffragettes. When traveling to Ireland, for example, she had to make a “stealth journey”, avoiding getting seen by the suffragettes awaiting her arrival at the dock. But some angry activists were least of her concerns.\n\n35. She Feared The Worst\n\nThe outbreak of WWI changed Margot Asquith considerably. She involved herself much more in the intrigues of Downing Street, becoming staunchly opposed to her husband’s efforts that escalated the fighting. Her primary concern, however, was that WWI would bring an end to her cultural influence and social status. Sadly, she would lose a lot more than that.\n\n36. She Was Simply Inhumane\n\nMargot’s stepsons participated in the fighting, right on the frontlines. They were facing the worst things a human can experience—but her reaction was disturbing. The calamity they faced didn’t soften her heart towards them.\n\nIn fact, Raymond Asquith, HH Asquith’s eldest son, even wrote to his own wife, complaining about Margot’s “inhumanity towards her stepchildren”. Her next move made it clear that she didn’t care what happened to them.\n\n37. She Didn’t Care For Veterans\n\nWhen Herbert Asquith, HH Asquith’s second son, returned from the frontlines, Margot’s cool reception stunned British society. The things that Herbert had seen had left him shell-shocked. Instead of embracing him, however, Margot accused the decorated veteran of being plastered out of his mind. Surprisingly, that wasn’t her biggest WWI blunder.\n\n38. She Downed Downing Street\n\nPerhaps in an effort to rehabilitate her image, Margot Asquith made the decision to visit a German POW camp. However, the move backfired horribly. The society pages portrayed her as being out of touch with the common folk. The combined scandals and her continued rude remarks eventually contributed to her husband’s fall from power in 1916.\n\n39. She Cheered Her Husband’s Defeat\n\nUltimately, Margot was happy to leave the stuffy and stifling world of Downing Street behind. But Asquith was not. Against her wishes, Asquith sought to regain power in 1918. She later recalled calling the Liberal Party headquarters for the election results. When the pollster read out the tallies, she exclaimed, “Asquith beat? Thank God!”\n\nShe celebrated too early though.\n\n40. She Started To Lose Her Money\n\nOut of office, HH Asquith’s income was severely diminished. However, Margot’s infamous extravagance was not. Even her inheritance money became entangled, leaving her and Asquith to watch helplessly as their resources—and lifestyle—dwindled. Slowly but surely, she began to fade from the society pages. Except, that is, when her sharp-tongue cut another scandal.\n\n41. She Corrected Jean Harlow\n\nMargot allegedly met the American actress Jean Harlow at the height of her fame. But Harlow, having never heard of Margot, kept mispronouncing her name. Exasperated with the actress’ poor manners, Margot finally interjected. “No, no,” she mused, “the 't' is silent, as in 'Harlow'”. Margot decided to share more tidbits like that in her scandalous memoirs.\n\n42. She Was Out-Witted\n\nMargot Asquith tried to recoup some income by publishing her memoirs. However, critics panned the writing style. Margot even found herself out-witted for the first time in her life. The equally sharp-tongued Dorothy Parker reviewed Margot’s autobiography, writing: “The affair between Margot Asquith and Margot Asquith will live as one of the prettiest love stories in all literature”.\n\n43. She Was A Walking Parody\n\nAs if Parker’s scathing review hadn’t been enough, the famed author and satirist Barry Pain took aim at Margot Asquith as well. He published a book titled Marge Askinforit as a parody of Margot’s memoirs. “There was a quality in that autobiography,” he later explained, “which seemed to demand parody”. But there was nothing funny about Margot’s final years.\n\n44. She Sold Everything Off\n\nIt wasn’t long before Margot’s extravagant lifestyle far exceeded her means. She even admitted to being thousands of pounds in debt. It had gotten so bad that she had resorted to pawning her pearls. But even that wasn’t enough. She and Asquith had resorted to begging their old friends for money. The embarrassment was too much for someone.\n\n45. Her Stepdaughter Called Her Monstrous\n\nViolet Asquith, Margot’s stepdaughter, leveled criticism at the aging society woman for bankrupting her father. “It is monstrous,” Violet raged, “that other people (should) be made to foot Margot's bridge bills. How she has dragged his name through the mud”! Margot was just about ready to do anything for money. Including selling the only services she could.\n\n46. Her Husband Left Her Nothing\n\nWhen HH Asquith passed away, he left Margot with the meager sum of just £300—not nearly enough to settle her mounting debts. The bulk of his life insurance went to his surviving children, who were only too happy to leave Margot high and dry. There was just one thing left that she knew she could sell—even if it lowered her standards.\n\n47. She Sold The Only Thing She Had Left\n\nIn her final years, Margot Asquith managed to make a meager income by providing her services. No, thankfully, it wasn’t in doing anything too undignified. Margot advised people on “matters of taste” pertaining to interior design and sometimes advertised commercial products. But it wasn’t enough money and she resorted to even more desperate measures.\n\n48. She Started Paying In Promises\n\nForced to resort to unconventional measures, Margot Asquith began issuing IOUs to stave off her creditors—a stark contrast to her former opulence. The grand dame of wit and charm was humbled by the harsh realities of economic downfall. It was a cruel twist in her fate but, sadly, there was an even crueler one just around the corner.\n\n49. Her Daughter Was Trapped\n\nThe real tragedy for Margot came at the outbreak of WWII. Her daughter, Elizabeth, had married Antoine Bibesco, a Romanian prince. Sadly, when the fighting started, Elizabeth became trapped in Bucharest. The stress of having her daughter trapped behind enemy lines, coupled with her own financial stresses, pushed her right over the edge.\n\n50. She Passed Away Penniless"
