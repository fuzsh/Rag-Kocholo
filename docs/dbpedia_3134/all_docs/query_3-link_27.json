        "text": "Firth's War Memorial:\n\nAfter World War I, T. F. Firth & Company created a memorial. This lists 318 names of employees who served and 38 names of those who died in World War I.\n\nThe Memorial was situated in the Company Showroom at Clifton Mills, but, at some time during the ownership of the Company by Readicut, the Memorial was removed to the ground floor of the building.\n\nAround 2002, at the demise of Firth Carpets, the Memorial was rescued and following renovation it was repositioned on the upper floor of The Rydings, Brighouse Municipal Library.\n\nThe following document was written and submitted by Ivor Davies\n\nPlease email me if you can add any information about any of the people mentioned here\n\nT. F. FIRTH & SONS\n\nThe Great War 1914-1918\n\nIn memory of the employees of this company\n\nwho served their King and Country\n\nT. F. Firth & Company carpet manufacturers of Bailiffe Bridge, Brighouse – later known as Firth Carpets – created, as did many companies, a war memorial following the First World War. This Memorial commemorated not just those employees who were killed, but also all other employees who had also served during the war and survived\n\nFor many years the memorial was situated in the Company Showroom at Clifton Mills in a building built in 1909 which still exists today, now called Clifton House. However, at some time during the ownership of the Company by Readicut, the memorial was removed and stored, many would say dumped, in the ground floor of the building. During this time parts of the memorial, a carved stag's head, the company trade mark, and two crossed swords with red silk tassels were lost. The stag's head has recently been located and will be reunited with the Memorial\n\nAround 2002, at the demise of Firth Carpets, the Memorial was rescued and following renovation it was repositioned on the upper floor of The Rydings, Brighouse Municipal Library. In 2008, during the renovation of the Library by Calderdale M.B.C, the Memorial found a temporary home in my garage. This led me to consider researching those who featured on it. This document is the result of my research to date\n\nContents:\n\nThe Names of Those who Served Those Killed in Action Those Killed in Action: Clifton & Victoria Mills, Bailiffe Bridge Those Killed in Action: Flush Mills, Heckmondwike Those Who Served Statistics A Family Company The Aykroyd of Lightcliffe Baronetcy\n\nPrepared by Ivor Davies\n\n(One time Commercial Manager Firth Carpets)\n\nBRIGHOUSE : March 2009 The Names of Those who Served\n\nPanel 1 Panel 2 Panel 3 Panel 4 Adams H\n\nAllen H\n\nAllinson A\n\nAllinson A\n\nAnson F\n\nArmitage F\n\nAsworth D\n\nAspinall L\n\nAspinall W\n\nAtkinson H\n\nAykroyd A H\n\nBailey A\n\nBailey A\n\nBarker G\n\nBarker J W\n\nBarlow A\n\nBarlow H\n\nBarraclough J H\n\nBarrett G\n\nBartlett P\n\nBeaumont A\n\nBeaumont W\n\nBeverley A\n\nBinns C\n\nBintcliffe E D\n\nBlackburn E\n\nBlackburn J\n\nBooth F\n\nBooth J\n\nBooth L\n\nBoothroyd H\n\nBottomley E\n\nBottomley G\n\nBower H\n\nBradley J E\n\nBraham W\n\nBrayshaw G\n\nBrazey A\n\nBridgeman F\n\nBriggs J W\n\nBriggs L\n\nBriscall J\n\nBroadley F\n\nBroadley H\n\nBrockless A\n\nBrockless F\n\nBrockless J\n\nBrook A\n\nBrook E\n\nBrook J O\n\nBrooke H\n\nBrooke M\n\nBrownridge F W\n\nBruce F\n\nBuckley H\n\nBuckley W\n\nBurnley W\n\nBurrows S\n\nBurton F\n\nBurton G\n\nBywater W\n\nCarr A\n\nCartwright T\n\nChappel J\n\nCheetham H\n\nChild E\n\nClegg S\n\nClough F\n\nClough N\n\nClough R\n\nCollins G W\n\nCollins S\n\nCopley F\n\nCordingley L\n\nCrowther C\n\nCrowther W\n\nDavis B C\n\nDay J\n\nDawson H\n\nDewar M R U\n\nDrake J H\n\nDrake L\n\nDutton H\n\nEastwood A\n\nEastwood A\n\nEastwood I\n\nEllis D\n\nEllis P\n\nEmpsall M\n\nFielding J\n\nFirth E\n\nFirth G H\n\nFirth J\n\nFisher W\n\nFoulkes T\n\nFrance A\n\nFrance E\n\nFrankland H\n\nFrost G F\n\nGledhill J H\n\nGledhill N\n\nGlover F\n\nGlover F\n\nGlover L\n\nGlover P\n\nGlover W\n\nGoddard C\n\nGoldthorp R H\n\nGoodhall E\n\nGreen E L\n\nGreen G A\n\nGreenwood A V\n\nGreenwood F\n\nGreenwood F\n\nGreenwood J\n\nGreenwood J J\n\nGreenwood W\n\nGriffiths R\n\nHaig J\n\nHale E J\n\nHale E\n\nHall J E\n\nHammond G\n\nHanson G\n\nHarpin R\n\nHarris W\n\nHarrison R\n\nHartley H\n\nHearse H E\n\nHeppleston J\n\nHepworth T\n\nHey G H\n\nHicks W\n\nHitchliffe W\n\nHirst H\n\nHirst J\n\nHirst W A\n\nHobson H\n\nHobson J A\n\nHoey J A\n\nHoldsworth H\n\nHoldsworth H\n\nHoldsworth H\n\nHoldsworth S\n\nHoldsworth W V\n\nHolroyd C M\n\nHolt W H\n\nHopkinson A\n\nHorner C\n\nHuggins W\n\nHughes A H\n\nHutton S\n\nIngham H\n\nJackson S\n\nJarrard G\n\nJenkinson F J\n\nJohnson E\n\nJones T B\n\nJoy H\n\nKay J\n\nKellett A\n\nKellett H\n\nKendrew T\n\nKnight F\n\nLambert W\n\nLeadbeater W\n\nLeaman A\n\nLeaman D P\n\nLee W\n\nLeighton H\n\nLittle N\n\nLodge J\n\nLund H\n\nMacGowen J\n\nMack J E\n\nMallinson W S\n\nMarney D\n\nMarney E\n\nMason L\n\nMaude W H\n\nMedley E\n\nMetcalfe J W\n\nMitchell F\n\nMitchell H\n\nMoore C\n\nMorton B\n\nMorton F A\n\nMorton P\n\nNaylor J\n\nNelson W\n\nNewsome P\n\nNoble F\n\nNorth E\n\nNorth G\n\nNorth L\n\nNorth P\n\nOates P\n\nOates P\n\nOlver W C\n\nOraman C\n\nOrme F\n\nO'Sullivan C D\n\nOwen J W\n\nOwen W\n\nPadgett F E\n\nPalmer F\n\nPamment E\n\nPamment R\n\nParker J H\n\nPatrick J H\n\nPatterson A\n\nPeacock C\n\nPearson C\n\nPearson H\n\nPearson J A\n\nPearson S\n\nPepiers J\n\nPickles A\n\nPinder A\n\nPinder H\n\nPinder H\n\nPollit A\n\nPopplewell J B\n\nPriestley C\n\nPurdy G\n\nRace J W\n\nRandall C H\n\nRastrick H\n\nRastrick H\n\nRastrick R\n\nRastrick W\n\nRay W\n\nReeds R\n\nRenshaw H\n\nRenshaw J\n\nRiding F\n\nRoberts W\n\nRobinson F H\n\nRushton I J\n\nRushworth J W\n\nRushworth W\n\nSaunders D J G\n\nSchofield R\n\nSenior F\n\nSharp J W\n\nShaw W\n\nSimpson A\n\nSimpson J C\n\nSimpson R A\n\nSmith W\n\nSoothill W\n\nSpender W W\n\nSpivey F\n\nStainforth H G\n\nStamp C J\n\nStocks F\n\nStott A\n\nStott A\n\nStott N\n\nStott W\n\nStubbs H\n\nSturgess C C C\n\nStyles P\n\nSugden H\n\nSutcliffe O\n\nSutcliffe S\n\nSwales H G\n\nSykes E\n\nSykes F\n\nSykes G\n\nSykes G\n\nSykes R\n\nSykes R\n\nTain T\n\nTate J\n\nTate M\n\nTattersfield W\n\nTaylor J\n\nTaylor J\n\nTaylor V\n\nThompson A\n\nThornton J\n\nThornton J\n\nThornton N\n\nTodd H\n\nTurner J R\n\nVarley J\n\nWaddington J\n\nWaddington R\n\nWade E\n\nWade H\n\nWadsworth C\n\nWalford E\n\nWalker A\n\nWaller J W\n\nWalls J W\n\nWaring G\n\nWatson E\n\nWeavers R H\n\nWestern W H\n\nWhitehead L\n\nWhitehead N\n\nWhitehead T\n\nWhiteley E\n\nWhiteley H\n\nWhittel A\n\nWilby B\n\nWilby J\n\nWilkinson H S\n\nWilkinson R\n\nWilson G\n\nWind R\n\nWinn C\n\nWomersley A\n\nWood A\n\nYates R\n\nThose Killed in Action The names of T.

Where this resolved an identity for me, it is noted in the text\n\nEmphasised italic entries are my own comments and / or additional information\n\nPrior to World War I, many younger Firth Employees were volunteer part time soldiers, members of the Territorial Force created for Home Defence in 1908, now known as the Territorial Army. Therefore, Firth's had employees who were members of the 4th Battalion DUKE OF WELLINGTON'S (WEST RIDING REGIMENT) TF\n\nThis battalion served with the BEF in France and the Ypres Salient Flanders (Belgium) from 14 April 1915 to the armistice and through to 8 June 1919. They took part in the Somme Battle July / September 1916 where on one day, Monday 3rd July 1916 their casualties totalled 101 dead, 463 wounded and 155 missing\n\nFour of those killed in action that day, all original pre-war volunteers, I would think, were Firth Employees. The second name on the Memorial, see below, Herbert Aspinall followed by Frank Atak, Austin Arthur Hitchen and Horace S. Shaw\n\nI have obtained my knowledge of this battalion and Firth Employees serving with them from\n\nThe History of the 1st/4th Battalion Duke of Wellington's (WR) Regiment 1914-1919\n\nBy Captain P G Bales MC\n\nPublished in Halifax and London [1920]\n\nThose Killed in Action: Clifton & Victoria Mills, Bailiffe Bridge\n\nASPINALL H.

Father George a retired Publican\n\nHistory of The Bradford Pals by David Raw 2005\n\nIn February 1915, William joined the Bradford Pals 2nd Battalion. He was the 123rd volunteer to do so. This battalion later became the 18th Battalion the West Yorkshire Regiment. Hence his regimental number 18/123. (The 1st Bradford Pals became the 16th West Yorkshire Regiment.)\n\n13 May 1915 Bowling Park Bradford, a tented camp\n\n20 May 1915 Marched to the then new Army base at Ripon.

Thus, William just qualified for the 1914/14 Star. He would posthumously also qualify for both the War and Victory Medals, the full set later known as Pip, Squeak and Wilfred\n\nThe Division originally intended for Gallipoli now spent two months as a part of the Imperial Reserve in case of a second Turkish attempt to close the Suez Canal\n\nMarch 1916 The Division moved to France where the 18th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment initially\n\nOccupied a reserve position at Citerne in the Albert Arras area\n\n25 March 1916 The Battalion marched to Mailly Maillet just behind the front line arriving there 31st March\n\n24th April 1916 18th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment served in the front line for the first time.

Near the Ravenbeke, a bullet Lodged in his steel helmet, fortunately without wounding him. As he could find no other way of crossing, he waded through the stream, the water coming above his waist\n\nHe then advanced straight towards Peter Pan, across awful mud, and with Machine gun bullets whistling all around. Soon he met a party of the 1/6th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, but they could tell him nothing of the situation. So he determined to reconnoitre as far as Peter Pan itself before returning to report\n\nNot a dozen yards from the ruined building, (Peter Pan) he was severely wounded. One bullet shattered his jaw whilst another went right through his left shoulder and fractured his arm. That was the end of his reconnaissance\n\nApp 2 Page 303 – Joined the Battalion as a 2/Lt on 21 September 1916. He was an Instructor at the Third Army S O S School (Signals?)

Any remaining errors or omissions are mine\n\nSir Thomas Freeman Firth : 1st Baronet\n\nThe Founder and first Chairman of T. F. Firth & Sons Limited was Thomas Freeman Firth. He was born in Heckmondwike\n\nIn 1861, he was living at Westfield House Heckmondwike a Merchant and Manufacturer. By 1871, he had moved (next door) to Flush House No 3, and was a JP of the West Riding Bench employing 430 men and 70 boys and girls. By 1871, he had moved again to Westgate House Heckmondwike and was now employing 863 hands\n\nThomas Freeman Firth married Hannah Maria Willans [1829-1907] the daughter of a Huddersfield Wool Merchant William Willans [1800-1863]\n\nHannah Maria's elder sister Emily Willans [1828-1888] married a Joseph Asquith their eldest son being Herbert Henry Asquith [1852-1928], born at Morley, first Earl of Oxford and the Asquith who in 1914, was Prime Minister of the UK. Herbert Asquith when Prime Minister stayed at Lightcliffe with his cousin, his mother's sister's son, Algernon Freeman Firth\n\nThomas Freeman Firth and Hannah Maria Willans had several children:\n\nEdwin born Heckmondwike [1855-1872]\n\nAlgernon Freeman also born Heckmondwike, 15th September 1857 (Algernon Freeman was to succeed to the Baronetcy and also to succeed his father as the Chairman of T. F. Firth & Sons Limited)\n\nFrederick Willans [1858-1858]\n\nHenry Willans [1858-18??] He died before 1861\n\nHenry and Frederick twins?\n\nTwin girls Annie Maria and Edith [born 1860]\n\nThere may have been another son William Eustace in 1861, later a JP, who married Ann Maria Collier?\n\nSarah [1863-1???]\n\nAmy Beatrice [1865-1873]\n\nIn 1867, Thomas Freeman Firth went into partnership, manufacturing carpets, with his brother-in-law John Wrigley Willans [1832-1910] this was Firth Willans & Company Limited\n\nIn 1875, John Wrigley left this business in order to become the proprietor and joint editor of the Leeds Mercury. At this point, the Company was renamed T. F. Firth & Sons Limited.\n\nSir Algernon Freeman Firth : 2nd Baronet [1856-1936]\n\nIn 1871, then aged 14, Algernon was a boarding pupil at the Cedars School in Rickmansworth\n\nAlgernon was responsible for setting up the Firth Carpet Company in the United States in 1888. This factory was in Orange County near Cornwall on the Hudson, New York State, called Firthcliffe, as was the village built there to house the workers\n\nPreviously published in the New York Times July 25 1886 is an article stating that the Samuel Bunting Manufacturing Company had purchased all the Machinery of T. F. Firth's of Brighouse with the intent of setting this up in the old Broadhead Factory in Montana Orange County. Furthermore they expected many of Firth's Brighouse workmen to come to the States to continue their work. I wonder what happened here!\n\nHowever, Firth's at Firthcliffe was established two years later and operated independently as a wholly owned subsidiary of T. F. Firth & Sons Limited. By 1908, it had a turnover of one million dollars and employed nearly 600. In 1908, the company had difficulties with the authorities for violations, since 1902, of US Labor Law, when 24 workers were ordered to be deported. One US press cutting of the time states that those deported were strike leaders and their families as, following a strike settlement, the Strike Leaders were not re employed\n\nDuring WW2 this operation was sold in order to raise dollars for the UK war treasury. It then continued to operate, according to past employees very much as a family and community oriented business up to 1962, when it closed\n\nIn 1881, Algernon Freeman Firth married Janet Gertrude Lindsay [1860-1???]. They had one Child, Dorothy Gertrude\n\nTherefore when Sir Algernon died the Firth Baronetcy became extinct\n\nSir Algernon lived at Holme House, Lightcliffe\n\nAt one time he was the President of the local Liberal Association\n\nDuring World War I, Lady Firth was the Commandant of Priestley Green VAD Hospital and received a Mention in Despatches\n\nFor a period up to 1918 Sir Algernon was the President of the British Chamber of Commerce\n\n1922/3 Yorkshire High Sheriff\n\n1921 Sir Algernon retired to Scriven Park, Knaresborough where he died in 1936\n\n1929 He received an honorary LLD from Leeds University\n\nIt is said that, when he retired, the work people of Bailiffe Bridge wept\n\nHowever, perhaps this was selective as their feelings for him did not prevent a three week strike at T. F. Firth's, Bailiffe Bridge in March 1917\n\n(Brighouse & Elland Almanac 1918 page 108)\n\nSir William Henry Aykroyd : 1st Baronet [1865-1947]\n\nWilliam Henry Aykroyd was born in Manningham on the 8th May 1865\n\nHis father was Alfred Aykroyd [circa 1841], a cotton dyer and bleacher. The family lived at Oakwood Villas, Toller Lane, Bradford\n\nOn 29 January 1890, he married Emma Louisa Hammond, daughter of Ezra Waugh Hammond, a gentleman brewer of Horton Hall Bradford (The Hammond Brewing Family) .
