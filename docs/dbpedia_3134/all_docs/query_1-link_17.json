        "text": "Looking to the fact that peace has for several days past been regarded as virtually concluded, the intelligence of the formal signing of the treaty of peace by the plenipotentiaries in Paris was received at Leeds yesterday with a greater amount of enthusiasm than might have been anticipated. Still, as compared with the day of the reception of the new of the fall of Sebastopol, the state of Leeds yesterday was calm and quiet in the extreme. That, however, was a day the like of which few of us in Leeds may look upon again. When the news became pretty generally known in Leeds … flags and banners began to show themselves over or in front of public buildings, warehouses, mills, offices, shops, and other places of business. Prominent in this display were the new town hall, the board of works, the court house, and places of business and private houses in Briggate, Kirkgate, Albion Street, Commercial Street, Boar Lane, Park Row, Park Lane, Wellington Street, Woodhouse Lane, and other leading thoroughfares; and as the day advanced these signs of rejoicing increased in number and fluttered in abundance in all parts of the town. Nor were the good folks without their noisy demonstrations of joy. Cannon of almost every calibre were extemporised in all quarters, and belched forth their harmless powder to welcome the advent of “Peace and Plenty.” When evening set in, and the working classes were released from toil, the streets became filled with promenaders, and bands of music appeared, adding by their enlivening strains to the gaiety of the scene. In Briggate, Mr. Peacock, draper, illuminated his premises; but his was, so far as we saw, the only demonstration of that kind. Generally the feeling amongst the people appeared to be one of not unmixed rejoicing. Almost every man was asking his neighbour what were the terms of peace? – what guarantees had been obtained from Russia? – when would the precise terms be known? – whether they were really satisfactory, and such as would ensure a safe and a lasting peace? Of course, “Nobody” could answer the questions which “Everybody” was asking: and then “Everybody” shook his head, and made up his mind to exercise the Englishman’s much-loved privilege of grumbling – first grumbling that the terms were not at once disclosed, and next grumbling by anticipation at those terms, in the full belief that if they were really and truly good, they would have been stated at once. Others, again, would have dearly liked “another slap at the Russians,” because they were persuaded that in the next campaign England would have been able to show what she can do when once thoroughly roused and fully prepared for the fight – that she would, in fact, be “A1,” in 1856-7, which she was not in 1854-5. But upon reconsideration, all agreed that it is best as it is – that it would be unchristian and inhuman to sacrifice the lives of our fellow creatures merely for the military glory of our country. So it was agreed on all hands that the restoration of peace is really a subject for hearty rejoicing; and the rejoicing commenced in Leeds last evening accordingly. (Leeds Mercury 1856/04/01)"
