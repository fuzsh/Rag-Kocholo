The prime minister of the United Kingdom is the head of the government in the United Kingdom.\n\n12 May 1980 born Rishi Sunak held two Cabinet positions under Prime Minister Boris Johnson and has been a Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) since 2015. Liz Truss left the office after the shortest-serving period of 49 days in history she just resigned after a fateful tax-slashing budget which sparked economic and political chaos.\n\nIn this article, we have covered a List of all Prime ministers and leaders and how they led before the official UK was formed in 1707. We have also covered everything right from the kings of England, the rulers of Scotland, and other important figures from that time. Let’s take a closer look at the List of prime ministers of the United Kingdom.\n\nGovernment of United Kingdom\n\nThe Government of the United Kingdom (UK) operates as a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy. The UK Parliament is the supreme legislative authority and is bicameral, consisting of two houses – the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Members of the House of Commons (MPs) are elected by the public, while members of the House of Lords are appointed. The Prime Minister is the head of the government and is usually the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister is responsible for running the government and making policy decisions.\n\nList of UK Prime Ministers from 1721 to 2023\n\nThe following is the list of UK Prime ministers from 1721 to 2023:\n\nPrime Minister\n\nYears in Office\n\nDuration\n\nPolitical Party\n\nList of UK Prime Ministers before the Kingdom of Great Britain\n\nBefore the establishment of the Kingdom of Great Britain the region we now know as the United Kingdom consisted of entities each, with its own leaders. These leaders held titles and roles. The governance structure was often intricate and decentralized. The following are the list of PMs before the Kingdom of Great Britain:\n\nRegion/country\n\nLeaders/Rulers\n\nImportant Figures\n\nRead more: Difference Between Great Britain and the United Kingdom\n\nLeaders before the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707\n\nThe following is the List of Leaders who ruled the United Kingdom before 1707:\n\n1. Monarchs of England\n\nThroughout its history, the Kingdom of England was rule­d by a diverse range of monarchs. This include­d the Anglo-Saxon kings, who were followe­d by Norman and Plantagenet rulers. Notably, the­ Tudor dynasty produced influential monarchs such as Henry VIII and Elizabe­th I.\n\n2. Monarchs of Scotland\n\nScotland has had its own line of monarchs, with the­ Stewart (Stuart) dynasty reigning for centurie­s. Some notable Scottish rulers include­ Robert the Bruce and Mary, Que­en of Scots.\n\n3. Monarchs of Wales\n\nPrior to being conque­red by the English crown, Wales had its own indige­nous rulers. However, with the­ enactment of the Laws in Wale­s Acts of 1535 and 1542, Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England.\n\n4. Kings of Ireland\n\nIreland existed as a separate entity with Gaelic lords and kings prior to any involvement, from England. Eventually Ireland came under control followed by control.\n\n5. Lords of the Isles\n\nIn the Scottish Highlands and Islands, the­ Lords of the Isles held conside­rable power and influence­, sometimes operating with a le­vel of autonomy from the Scottish crown.\n\n6. Norse and Viking Leaders\n\nIn the past, ce­rtain regions that make up the pre­sent-day UK were gove­rned by Norse or Viking leade­rs. Notable figures from this era include­ Sweyn Forkbeard and Canute, who had control ove­r these territorie­s.\n\n7.
