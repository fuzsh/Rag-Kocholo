The town centre has much neoclassical Victorian architecture. An example is its railway station, which is a Grade I listed building described by John Betjeman as \"the most splendid station fa√ßade in England\".[2] It won the Europa Nostra award for architecture.\n\nHuddersfield hosts the University of Huddersfield and three colleges: Greenhead College, Kirklees College and Huddersfield New College. The town is the birthplace of rugby league with the local team, Huddersfield Giants, playing in the Super League. It also has a professional football team called Huddersfield Town, that currently competes in the Championship, as well as two Rugby Union clubs Huddersfield R.U.F.C. and Huddersfield YM RUFC.
