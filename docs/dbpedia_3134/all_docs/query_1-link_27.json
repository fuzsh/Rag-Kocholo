        "text": "This article is designated as vetted, meaning that it is up-to-date and accurate. Please ask before making changes.\n\nThe Great Slump - also known as the Turbulent Twenties, the Troubled Twenties, and the Great Upheaval - was a period of political coarsening, economic decline and popular unrest in the United Kingdom, as well as the rest of the British Empire and Commonwealth realms. The period of economic decline ultimately culminated in the breakout of the British Revolution and the greater collapse of the British Empire following the fallout from the civil war of 1925.\n\nThe period derived its most popular name from the \"economic slump\" which emerged in Britain after the end of the Great War. Britain struggled to adjust to demobilisation, domestic political troubles and the new post-war world in which British exports had drastically fallen and would never truly recover. Unemployment became a chronic issue in the pre-Revolution years, as ex-serviceman struggled to reintegrate into the civilian workforce and staple industries suffered from a collapse in demand and competition with foreign exports. The emergence of competition in German industry and the rise of the Mitteleuropean economic project further damaged Britain's already suffering export economy. The economic downturn contributed to unrest in the political sphere, already exacerbated by the Irish War of Independence, with British trade unions and the labour movement as a whole became increasingly militant in response to an unresponsive political system and an increasingly radicalised right-wing. Conservative-controlled governments dominated the period and controversially attempted to use several unpopular, authoritarian wartime measures past the initial demobilisation in order to curtail the threat of revolution. Inspired by the success of the French Revolution, both the far-left and and far-right became increasingly bold and proactive, as a wave of unprecedented strikes and political violence polarised the nation.\n\nPolitical History[]\n\nInstability & Polarisation: 1919 - 1920[]\n\nThe \"New\" Democracy[]\n\nFollowing the disastrous ‘Last Offensive’ of the French Generals, by August of 1919 France requested British support for signing an Armistice with the Central Powers due to its own mutinies and strikes. This was not initially perceived as an overall end to the conflict, with French leadership hoping for a temporary relief from the ongoing political and military quagmire that could potentially lead to a turnaround on the war front. The Armistice of Chantilly soon took effect, but with the French domestic situation showing no signs of recovery and increasing calls to end the war at home, Britain exerted tremendous pressure on their French allies to sign the Treaty of Versailles, ending the war once and for all. Britain now feared continuous warfare on the continent would weaken its own economic and geopolitical influence alongside further bankrupting the Empire. Britain thus also refused to back the Empire of Japan’s claim to seize the presently occupied German concession of Tsingtao, causing the Japanese delegation to leave Versailles after the British diplomat, Philip Kerr, was reportedly overheard disparaging Japan’s contributions to the war in a conversation with British delegate, Lord Summer. Nevertheless, the Treaty of Versailles was signed and the British government deemed this as a \"Peace with Honour\" - a term proposed by German delegate, Johannes Bell, to Lord Cunliffe, as a deliberate reference to the 1878 Treaty of Berlin. Cunliffe would go on to popularise the term among the British establishment and aristocracy.\n\nAt home, political tensions were brewing amid widespread criticism of Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, and his Liberal-Tory coalition government. Now derided as the \"Man Who Lost the War” - Lloyd George's once great firebrand reputation was in tatters. Faced with the possibility of a vote of no confidence in the government, Lloyd George opted to call elections for the end of the year and resigned with immediate effect. Not seeking to harm its own reputation, the Conservative Party took immediate steps to distance themselves from Lloyd-George and his ill-fated government, with Conservative aligned newspapers publishing misleading allegations their ministers had been locked out of major decision making by the Coalition Liberals. Lloyd George and some of his allies had initially mooted the possibility of the \"Coalition Liberals\" forming some kind of continuity coalition with the Conservatives as a means of maintaining political stability and fending off an upsurge in support for the Labour Party. Though these hopes were dashed when the little-known Conservative MP, Stanley Baldwin, publicly attacked Lloyd George in the Commons, referring to the man as a \"conniving wastrel\" who had allowed corruption in Parliament to become deep-rooted and sabotage the war effort. Already looking for an excuse to abandon his erstwhile partners, Law confirmed the Conservatives would rule out any further coalitions with any party for the foreseeable future. Following Lloyd George's resignation, he was quickly replaced by Arthur Balfour of the Conservatives who agreed to lead a brief caretaker government until the elections could be held. Parliament was dissolved on the 24th of November, with elections held on the 13th of December.\n\nThe 1919 General Election saw the beginning of major political instability in British politics amid growing radicalism and polarisation among the public, but also among the most enlarged electorate to date. The Representation of the People Act 1918 had extended the franchise to cover all women over the age of 30, and all men over the age of 21, giving the vote to the working classes. Military veterans and a scarred public had become bitter and angered by Britain's failure in the Great War and the humiliating Peace with Honour; many sought to vent their frustrations in the electoral process. Labour saw an immediate groundswell in support with other left-wing ventures such as the National Socialist Party, British Socialist Party and National Democratic Party all returning candidates to Parliament. Likewise, the Conservatives were able to make an electoral breakthrough in securing 320 seats, a slim but workable majority with increasing backing from an insurgent far-right, taking the form of the breakaway and Germanophobic National Party. Much of this came at the expense of the Liberals who saw their vote share implode to one of its worst electoral results in the Party's history though it remained the second largest party in Parliament by a razor margin and as such was granted the position of the official opposition. Andrew Bonar Law was consequently appointed Prime Minister, forming the Law Ministry on the 14th of December.\n\nLaw had inherited leadership of a nation that was becoming increasingly polarised and in the midst of a war in Ireland. Sinn Féin had launched an insurrection the previous year following a landslide victory in the Irish Parliamentary Elections with its members meeting to convene in the revolutionary Dáil Éirreann. Fighting had now been ongoing for just over a year and British authority in Ireland had all but broken down with the Royal Irish Constabulary haemorrhaging members, courts unable to reliably hand down or enforce judgements and the Dublin Castle administration all but losing its grip on the island. A Dáil-backed quasi-state was gradually taking shape to supplant its British counterpart with Sinn Féin controlled councils levying taxation among sympathetic citizens and Dáil backed courts handing out judgements, to be enforced by an Irish Republican police force. Of Ulster-Scots descent and a close ally to the Irish Unionist political leader, Sir Edward Carson, Law was deeply opposed to the proposals of Irish Home Rule and like his contemporaries, fiercely opposed to the notion of an independent Ireland. The Prime Minister instructed the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Edward Turnour, the Lord Winterton, and the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Viscount French, to intensify counter-insurgency activities but still refused to fully commit towards the use of the military. Martial law was used intermittently across the island, though it was only ever consistently used and applied within Munster. Neither Winterton or French believed British authority was sufficiently threatened and to actively use troops would acknowledge a state of war in Ireland. Law agreed that this would be disastrous - not least because IRA prisoners would have to be treated as prisoners of war - and instead called on his Irish ministers to intensify the use of special policing units to supplement the RIC. The loathed \"Temporary Constables\" - the Black & Tans - and the \"Auxiliary Division\" of the RUC - the Auxiliaries or 'Auxies' - had been created on the suggestion of the prior Liberal Secretary for War, Winston Churchill, and had since garnered a reputation for brutal conduct. Nonetheless, their usage was now being seriously expanded to increasing outrage in Ireland and sections of British society.\n\nRed Flags & Silver Badges[]\n\nAt home, early political unrest was characteristic of the labour movement, with socialist forces riding a wave of popular discontent at the humiliating conclusion of the war. Protests were common in major cities and regional strikes sporadically occurred as workers became fearful of an influx of demobilised men depressing wages. Their fears were well-founded, as the increasingly worsening domestic economic environment combined with industries stepping back from a war footing created a prospect of mass unemployment. Workers were already being laid off and sudden return of men from the front lines swelled unemployment figures. Only the shipping industry reported a short-lived boom to recoup lost shipping capacity but this quickly led to a glut of oversupply and the industry was soon caught in the recession. This was felt particularly hard in the Scottish city of Glasgow, where shipbuilding on the Clyde was a staple industry. The city was no stranger to political radicalism and had already seen the rise of the \"Red Clydeside\" period, a term used to denote the growing left-wing radicalism among Scottish workers along the Clyde banks. Strikes in the area had been ongoing since 1911 and morphed into anti-war activism at the outbreak of the Great War before seeing the emergence of women-led rent strikes in 1915. Amid the demobilisation in late 1919, the Scottish TUC and Clyde Workers' Committee (CWC) sought to increase the availability of jobs open to demobilised soldiers by reducing the working week from a newly-agreed 47 hours to 40 hours along with general improvements to working conditions.\n\nStrikes had began on boxing day and as many as 40,000 workers, and many discharged serviceman from the Glasgow shipbuilding and engineering yards had joined, along with solidarity strikes which broke out among local power station workers and miners from the nearby Lanarkshire and Stirlingshire pits. A delegation of the strike leaders met with the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Sir James Stewart, to discuss the matter. Stewart informed the strikers he would telegram the government for further instructions and the strikers declared they would reconvene the following Monday. The Sheriff of Lanarkshire, Alastair Mackenzie, had already telegraphed the government to request military assistance should the protest get out of hand. The Russian Revolution was in recent memory and civil war was ongoing in France amid unrest in Germany, with Law's cabinet fearing events in Scotland could spiral in a similar manner. Instructions were sent to Scottish Command informing of the situation and to be prepared to deploy government troops if requested, to act on behalf of the civil authorities.\n\nOn the 29th December, the strikers returned in a massive rally organised by trade unions, taking place in George Square at Glasgow's city centre. As many as 30,000 people were present and Red Flags were flown among the crowd. While initially peaceful and present to hear the response from the Lord Provost, the gathering quickly descended into a riot as the police launched a baton charge in the early afternoon prompting the workers to retaliate. Mackenzie was present, and attempted to read the Riot Act, but it was snatched out of his hands before he could finish. Within the Glasgow Corporation Chambers (the City Hall), the CWC leaders of David Kirkwood, Manny Shinwell and Willie Gallacher were heading an official strike deputation but opted to leave upon hearing the news and unrest outside. Upon leaving, the men were attacked with Kirkwood being knocked to the ground by a police baton. The three men were promptly arrested and charged with \"instigating and inciting large crowds of persons to form part of a riotous mob\", though Kirkwood was later acquitted. After the baton charge, the outnumbered police retreated from George Square though fighting between the strikers and police, some mounted, spread into the surrounding streets and continued into the night. The Secretary for Scotland, Lord Clyde, was keeping abreast of the events and informed the cabinet he had reason to believe a \"Bolshevist uprising\" had broken out in Glasgow. Fearing an army mutiny, troops from the local Maryhill barracks were not deployed because it was feared that men there might have sided with their neighbours. Instead, units from the North of England were deployed, while the Maryhill barracks were locked with the soldiers inside. General Sir Charles Harington, the Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the meeting that 6 tanks supported by 100 lorries were \"going north that evening\". It was stated that up to 12,000 troops could be deployed.\n\nThe first troops arrived on Monday evening, with their numbers increasing over the next few days. The six Medium Mark C tanks, of the Royal Tank Regiment arrived from Bovington, the following week. A military presence descended on the city centre with troop patrols established, and most controversially, machine gun nests were placed in George Square. The Observer newspaper reported that \"The city chambers is like an armed camp. 'The quadrangle is full of troops and equipment, including machine guns.\" Sandbags and military fortifications were erected around the City Chambers and other important municipal locations with military garrisons established. Future Scottish Chairman, Campbell Stephen, described it as like \"witnessing the city under siege by some foreign invader.\" Despite its stated purpose, the military arrived after the rioting was over and they played no active role in dispersing any protesters. Instead, the troops guarded locations of importance to the civil authorities throughout the period of the strike, which lasted until January 9. The troops and tanks then remained in Glasgow and its surrounding areas until January 18. In the aftermath, of the rioting, the strike eventually failed with the workers forced to accept the 47-hour work week. While regarded as an immediate failure, Manny Shinwell commented that it greatly increased revolutionary awareness among the Glaswegian populace and substantially strengthened worker solidarity in the face of state repression.\n\nWhile this early unrest is often characterised as the realm of an increasingly militant labour movement, much of the growing agitation came from disgruntled ex-serviceman and the unions that had formed to represent them out of the Great War. By 1919, these had largely coalesced around four groups: the National Association of Discharged Soldiers & Sailors, the National Federation of Discharged & Demobilised Soldiers & Sailors, the Comrades of the Great War and the much maligned, National Union of Ex-Serviceman. The first three groups had formed across 1917, each with differing political affiliations, and attitudes towards the government. The NADSS, formed by James Howell, was born out of the trade union movement and maintained close connections to the Labour Party whereas the NFDDSS was formed by the left-liberal MPs, James Hogge and William Pringle, with assistance from veterans' campaigner, F.A. Rumsey, and was tenuously aligned with the Liberal Party. The Comrades were the final group to be formed and one done-so with tacit government backing, as it had been formed by the Secretary-of-State for War, Lord Derby, in response to the NFDDSS running against his son in a by-election. Nominally apolitical, the Comrades were informally allied with the Conservatives and most popular in the rural South of the country. While the NADSS and NFDDSS enjoyed warm relations, both were more hostile to the Comrades, as they did not pressure for statutory support and bribed potential recruits with food and beer, a practice Hogge particularly despised. Despite their left-ward tendencies, the NADSS and the NFDDSS were explicitly aligned with the established British political system and the monarchy, though their membership was often-times more radical. This disunity with the leadership in the NFDDSS - which had now overshadowed the NADSS - led to the formation of the National Union of Ex-Servicemen (NUX) in the middle of 1919, as an explicitly socialist organisation and one formally affiliated to the Labour Party and ILP. Unlike the other groups, the NUX was more politically active and militant, seeking to organise ex-serviceman to unite to improve society as a whole rather than campaign solely on veterans' issues.\n\nWhile the NFDDSS were nominally open to the labour movement, the dominant association's leadership had soon grown suspicious of its openly left-wing counterpart, and its socialist aspirations. Hogge described it as a \"bitter and brooding group\" and one of Marxist persuasion, while the high-profile member and former NFDDSS parliamentary candidate, Frederick Lister, regarded it with a degree of suspicion, believing it agitated returning serviceman for cynical political ends rather than satisfying their imminent needs. The distrust of the NFDDSS was not purely out of concern for ex-serviceman being used politically, but Hogge and Pringle feared that the NUX was actively undercutting it. While the executive committee was dominated by a mixture of Asquithian and New Liberals, of one mind on the matter of veterans' welfare, the membership was described by Ernest Thurtle, a NUX executive committee member, as \"distinctly proletarian\" with a brooding sense of radicalism. Disagreements between head office and district branches were common, particularly as local branches (especially in London) organised joint ventures with their NUX-counterparts such as the opening of soup kitchens for the needy and public demonstrations on behalf of the veterans' movement. To counter the rising influence of the NUX, Hogge proposed the formation of a unified political force, a veterans' party, to contest the 1919 elections. While no formal political party was established, the NFDDSS and the NADSS agreed to run candidates with the sponsorship of their selective organisations under a unified label, adopting the recognisable Silver War Badge, rendered to men who had been discharged for services rendered, for this purpose. In the run-up to the election, 30 Silver Badge Party candidates were endorsed, 4 from the NADSS and 26 from the NFDDSS, with only 5 of the NFDDSS candidates being put forward by the Executive Committee with the rest being selected by local branches. Of these, only 3 of the NFDDSS candidates and 1 one of the NADSS candidates managed to be elected. The sole NADSS MP, Robert Hewitt Barker, had been elected with unofficial Unionist support after local political feuding and opted to sit as an Independent Conservative, repudiating the Silver Badge label shortly after taking his seat. What remained over the movement quickly became the political wing of the NFDDSS, and in Parliament it began to align itself broadly with the Liberals and to a lesser extent Labour. Nominally, moderately left-wing, the Silver Badge endorsements ran the gauntlet of the political spectrum radical leftists such as the future Labour politician and republican, Ernest Thurtle, but also the far-right with future Loyalist dissident, Hamilton Beamish, securing an endorsement. While no whip was enforced, it largely followed the Liberals and at times Labour. Facing pressure over its dire finances and poor success, Howell resigned as NADSS President following the election, being replaced with the more right-wing Arthur Jackson. The new leadership severed its ties to the trade union movement and began to push the organisation in an increasingly right-wing direction.\n\nTensions between ex-serviceman and the government would soon be inflamed following the announcement that the 19th December was to marked as \"Peace Day\" and made a national holiday. In lieu of victory parades, \"Peace Marches\" were to be celebrated and held all across Britain to mark the end of the Great War and celebrate the return to peace on the Continent. While formulated with good intentions, the celebration was regarded as a mockery by ex-serviceman and calls were by both the NUX and NFDDSS to call it off in favour of a more general remembrance day to honour the war dead. These calls were ignored though the government promised that it would \"be both a day of solemn remembrance for those who sacrificed their lives so that today we may celebrate this hard-fought peace.\" Nevertheless, a range of local NFDDSS branches repudiated the government's declaration and planned to hold \"memorial marches\" with or without the approval of head office. The NUX soon followed, and in a statement authored by the young Labour councillor, John Beckett, declared that local branches were given the autonomy to \"decide whether to conduct joint marches with fellow societies upholding the interests of ex-servicemen.\" Fearful of violence, additional police were posted in major cities, with the NFDDSS and NUX organising marches, public gatherings and protests in all major cities. The Comrades of the Great War organised counter \"marches of remembrance\" though these were smaller and rarely interacted with their counterparts. Small-scale skirmishes with the authorities broke out across towns and cities in the North but these were quickly overshadowed by events in the South. The Comrades of the Great War, were more prominent across the South of England though in London and nearby industrial towns, the NUX and NFDDSS were more dominant. Within London, the Woolwich branch of the NFDDSS announced its intentions to organise a march on Parliament Square to demand for better conditions for soldiers, serving and former, though Hogge warned them this would not be tolerated and demanded they call off the march. The branch executive refused and continued regardless, leading to a baton charge by the police as they attempted to enter Parliament St. where the Peace Day Parades were being held near the Temporary Cenotaph. With the marches beaten back. events in Westminster quickly turned into a riot as other NFDDSS branches and the NUX learned of what was happening and sought to intervene to support their comrades. The police were successful in suppressing the marchers for long enough that they were able to push events away from Parliament, leading to the bloody Battle of Victoria Street. The Parade continued as expected though supplementary speeches were cut short with attending crowds swiftly dispersed. The Woolwich branch was officially expelled, and promptly defected en masse to the NUX.\n\nOutside of London, the violence was replicated in Luton following a bureaucratic clash between local veterans and the town council. The local NFDDSS branch had requested that it be allowed to hold a drumhead mass in Wardown Park. The request was denied by the town council and the NFDDSS were not permitted to send formal delegates to the parade in the town centre or a private banquet to be hosted by the Mayor to follow afterwards. In a letter to local newspapers, Deputy Mayor C. Dillingham, further inflamed the situation by quoting Henry Wilson, and in a letter to the local papers, claiming that \"the constant demands for more, more, more by the local branch of the Discharged Serviceman's Federation [sic] should not at all be seen as indicative of those who fought for King and Country. Of those men who cannot help themselves, their needs are amply provided for by very generous charities. A man who asks for anything else is not asking for help, but just another dole.\" Local veterans and serviceman were allowed to attend informally, and the NFDDSS encouraged its members to attend anyway despite fears of a \"riotous atmosphere among the rank-and-file.\" This atmosphere would only worsen when the lavish parade (with the mayor pulled in a gold-covered horse drawn carriage) was heckled and booed by attendees. The riot started when the Luton Town Mayor, Arthur Bennett Attwood, was interrupted during his reading of the Peace Proclamation and attendees began to violently clash with the police. Officers were diverted to fight back against the crowd but the police cordon was broken through and the rioters stormed the town hall, eventually setting it alight. Order was restored by midnight but by now the fire brigade were unable to save what remained of the building and by the next morning only rubble and a burnt façade remained. The ruin of the building was demolished the next year and a new town hall was built on the site of the old in 1931.\n\nEconomic Downturn & the NUR Strike[]\n\nUpon taking power, Law and his Ministers sought to overturn the \"draconian\" state of affairs that had arisen to meet the demands of the period. Wartime regulations such as state direction of industry, price controls, the control of raw materials and foreign trade were abolished, and trade unions resurrected practices that had since been restricted. However, food rationing remained until early 1922 amid struggling imports. Prices increased twice as fast during 1920 than they had during the war and succeeding wage increases worsened the growing recession. Despite promises to bring down government expenditure and slash taxation, these policies were not immediately forthcoming and amid pressure to make good on the Coalition's promises of \"Homes Fit for Heroes\", the government was forced to agree to a plan of house-building. The President of the Local Government Board, Auckland Geddes, was tasked with drawing up plans and a programme of limited subsidies for private house-builders was launched to moderate approval by the public. Following Geddes leave of the cabinet, the plans were taken over by the Viscount Astor. The plans did little to alleviate the shortage for returning veterans and the programme served to only inflame the public mood. Under foreign pressure, the government submitted to a renewed Dreadnought Race which did see a fall in unemployment in the shipping industry though wages did not necessarily keep up and poverty was still immense.\n\nWidespread poverty, already an issue, was exacerbated by the post-war malaise and was particularly visible among returning veterans. Small-scale protests were common but soon attracted national attention with the National League of the Blind organised the so-called \"March of the Blind\" in April. The NLB had been calling for better provisions for the visually impaired since the 1890s and organised its first strike in 1912, efforts which had seen little success. During the Great War, the NLB's services had been stretched due to an influx of men who had been blinded by poison gas or shells, with as many as 20,000 of the 35,000 blind people in the country living in poverty. At the initiative of the NLB, on the 5th of April, Easter Monday, 104 blind men began marching from Manchester, Leeds and Newport to London. By the time they had reached London, their numbers had swelled to 600. The march was led by Ben Purse, the NLB General-Secretary; David Lawley, the NLB North West organiser; and Patrick Neary, the Dublin branch secretary. The marchers were ill-equipped, instructed to carry only their white canes and with no change of clothes or provisions. Any members that had served in the armed forces were asked not to wear any distinguishing medals or uniforms, so as not to illicit \"misguided patriotic sympathy\". The men marched arm in arm and four abreast or else held onto a rope to avoid getting separated with sighted guides marching with them to direct them on the path. In some municipalities, the local police provided an escort for the marchers or supplied buses for transport. Accommodation was provided by trade unions and cooperative societies and in some instances, the marchers were allowed to sleep in police cells. The marchers arrived in London on the 25th April and the NLB leaders were invited to meet the Prime Minister. Bonar Law declared he was deeply sympathetic to the NLB's aims and declared \"something must be done\" but made no pledges to meet their demands of better education, more work opportunities and a financial grant to all blind persons. Taking pity on the marchers, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Austen Chamberlain offered to pay for their rail fares home.\n\nThe situation in 1920 was further complicated by the presence of the Coal Industry Commission, popularly known as the Sankey Commission, and the publishing of its findings in Summer. The royal commission, led by John Sankey, was called to examine the future of the mining industry with its membership being drawn from leading businessmen, mine owners, trade unionists and leading economists. Members included: Mr Justice Sankey, Chair of the Commission; Frank Hodges, Herbert Smith and Robert Smilie, trade unionists; Leo Chiozza Money, R.H. Tawney and Sidney Webb, economists; Sir Adam Nimmo, Sir Alan Smith, Sir Evan Williams and Sir Arthur Duckham, businessman; R.W. Cooper, a journalist and Arthur Balfour, the Lord President of the Council. All three of the economists were affiliated to the Labour Party (though Chiozza Money had only recently defected) and they, along with the trade unionists and Sankey, supported nationalisation. However, while Sankey had proposed this with compensation, the rest had proposed it without, an unacceptable possibility for the colliery owners. Balfour had led the opposition, arguing that instead of nationalising the industry, all coal mined would be nationalised instead and purchased by the government at a fixed rate, to be handled by a new Coal Commission. Duckham was the sole dissenter of both plans, proposing Balfour's approach be adopted but the CMB should be a joint-stock company in private ownership as opposed to a public corporation. Despite objections from the left-orientated members of the board, Balfour convinced Law and Chamberlain to adopt the reorganisation proposal and it passed through parliament in July. Nimmo was made the Chairman of the newly-formed Coal Commission, shortly after its creation with Sir Ernest Gowers as controller.\n\nTrade union militancy was also on the rise, with a notable flashpoint occurring on the 13th of May when London dockers refused to load armaments bound for service in Russia, onto the SS Jolly George. Agitation from the Hands Off Russia Movement, and its organiser Harry Pollitt, gained the backing of the transport unions, who threatened to call a dock strike if the workers were forced to load the offending cargo. Ultimately, the police and owners backed down, and the SS Jolly George sailed without the weaponry. Likewise, the issue of privatisation and wages became a major issue for the government with Law having promised that nationalisation of industries would end. For the course of the war, the railways and mines had been nationalised and while this had previously been seen as a temporary measure, calls to keep the nationalisations in place were beginning to rise. The issue of privatisation of these industries was particularly tricky and much negotiation with mine owners and labour leaders was necessary to avert major incidents. Despite party calls for an immediate and swift \"divorce of state and industry,\" the Triple Alliance - an alliance of the largest Railway, Mining and Transport unions - threatened a general strike if this was done and Law's Chancellor, Austen Chamberlain, sought to calm labour leaders with promises to discuss continuity of wages in place of nationalisation. Likewise, the Minister of Labour, Robert Horne, felt that a mass privatisation immediately would cause mass outrage from the trade unions and so proposed that a staggered timetable be adopted. Henceforth the government proposed that of the two main industries under nationalised control - the railways and the mines - the railways be privatised first in 1920 and the mines a year later in 1921. Despite dismay from the trade unions, much of their leadership were still prepared to enter talks with the government about the future of their industries. However, inflation was also another long-term cause of the strike. The closing days of 1919 saw a brief post-war industrial optimism as men who had been serving at the Front were quickly absorbed into what few employment opportunities were available but this in turn led to the displacement of women who had worked in industry during the war. By 1920 alone, fewer women were working in industry than there had been in 1913. The sudden and rapid shift in the labour force, coupled with chronic unemployment and government policy of lifting wartime controls on prices, profits and wages led to dramatic inflation and increases in the cost of living for the working class.\n\nInitial talks were forthcoming, with the government pledging to pass legislation to prevent wage cuts. The railways were relinquished into private ownership over the summer but tensions immediately broke out due to the railway industry's leadership reporting that rapidly rising maintenance costs (made worse by a long-term lack of maintenance and investment) and a fall in revenues meant that, in September, they would initiate wage cuts in contravention of the government's promises. While Horne had hoped to uphold the wartime rates, Conservative backbenchers rejected this compromise and the government was forced to announce it would not stand in the way of the proposed cuts. In retaliation, the National Union of Railwayman (NUR) - a member of the Triple Alliance - and the smaller, Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) announced plans for strike action in response. The sharp and unexpected reduction in wages had been met with equally rapid strike action but the railwayman's response caused a split response across British society. Political forces on the left were broadly supportive, with the Labour Party's executive coming out in support of the NUR and ASLEF but warning against further intervention by the Triple Alliance, a point the NUR General Secretary, Jimmy Thomas, conceded to. The Silver Badge Party was more cautiously supportive and ultimately split over the issue however with the more sympathetic NFDDSS coming out in support of the strike (at least publicly) and the now increasingly right-wing NADSS' leader, Arthur Jackson, calling on the government to \"not bend to labour tyranny.\" The NADSS officially abandoned the Silver Badge label, making it the political arm of the NFDDSS. Likewise, the National Democratic Party found itself crumbling in the first test of its identity. While the party's informal leader, Clement Edwards, was somewhat supportive of the strikers and called for compromise, one of the NDP's founders and major figures, Victor Fisher, led an internal opposition in publicly opposing the strike and declared in Parliament that \"a small but wicked cabal of Bolshevist infiltrators seek to capture the working men of Great Britain for their perverse machinations.\" His words were echoed more famously by David Lloyd George in his first post-war public engagement, declaring that \"a small but active body of men has wrought tirelessly and insidiously to exploit the labour organisations of this country for subversive ends.\"\n\nOn the right, the strike was widely opposed with the only real division being on whether to back Horne's compromise or instead crush the strikers outright, though the National Party experienced a brief crisis of its own. While representing the far-right of British politics, the Nationals were still at this time committed to anti-sectarianism and nominally held sympathies for the labour force even it called for strikes to be banned. The party leadership under Croft was deeply opposed to the strike and made repeated calls to \"make an example of the Bolshevist upstarts\" in the NUR, but the reaction among the public was more mixed. At a National Party rally in London amidst the strike, Croft and his co-speaker, The Lord Ampthill, were booed by a crowd when Ampthill warned that \"if this abuse of privilege continues then we will have no choice but to take them away again\" in regards to the right to strike. The Party's official policy later moved to a more lukewarm condemnation of the NUR, and called on the government to \"resolve the matter justly and equitably.\" Commentators have argued that this early \"upset\" would lead to the party's aristocratic backers eventually opting into supporting Rotha Lintorn-Orman's rival political ventures over fears that the Nationals were too \"soft\" on the issue of labour disputes.\n\nFrom midnight on the night of the 26th of September until the 6th of October, NUR and ASLEF affiliated workers officially went on strike bringing much of the nation's rail transport to a grinding halt. Attempts to bus in blackleg labour was blocked when the NUX veteran's group provided ex-serviceman as anti-strikebreakers and stewards for picket lines. Disruption was immediate with the Bowes Park Weekly News reporting, ‘Wood Green people have become proficient in the ancient and almost forgotten art of walking’. Across the country, coal carts were utilised, cycling re-entered vogue, and horse riding became common. The people of Muswell Hill organised a two-horse wagonette service to the City and tram and bus queues became long. In further drastic measures, London Councils sent round notices that vigorous rationing would be enforced and only six ounces of sugar and four of margarine were allowed per head a week. Public recreation was inevitably disrupted, with the Alexandra Park Racecourse stewards deciding to abandon the following Saturday’s race meeting. Nevertheless, spirits among the public remained high and supportive of the strikers. As a gesture of goodwill, many employers opted to shorten the working day rather than organise private transport, causing even more disruption to the economy. In a shock twist, the MFGB announced its intentions to ballot miners on conducting their own strike on the 1st of October, partially in solidarity with the railwaymen and partially to upend any potential future plans to cut their own wages. Balloting had commenced quickly and returned a narrow majority of 56% in favour of action, with striking soon beginning on the 4th October, causing further disruption. Unlike the rail strikes, those of the miners' strikes were less enforced and more sporadic, though the government was fearful that the \"half-penny strike\", as it was termed, could soon snowball.\n\nAfter the 10-day period, the government conceded and the rail strikes were called off amid a victory for the railwaymen. It was announced that the government would enforce the provision of the wartime pay rates for another year with the NUR securing further legislation guaranteeing and standardising an 8-hour workday for all railway workers. The government had taken a bruising and talks began to float in Conservative circles about replacing Law, with the much smaller Miners' Strike still ongoing. While the MFGB's own action was losing the little steam it had to begin with, Law now felt ready to take a hard line and sought to pass the Emergency Act of 1920 - coalescing provisions of the Defence of the Realm Act and other wartime legislation into one, single document that could be used in peace as well as war. Fearful of the potential repercussions of the new legislation, morale among the miners was lacking and on the 10th of October, a snap poll to continue the strike resulted in a ballot of only 24% approval for continuing. The strike came to a halt though the government did not cease continuing with the Emergency Act, which was passed into law in December. The new Act allowed the government to declare a state of emergency and use the military in peacetime roles. While particularly useful in crushing and blocking potential strikes, it was also seen as a potential boon for shoring up Britain's position in the ongoing Irish affair. While the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 - passed in August - had granted British forces more draconian powers such as replacing trial by jury with courts-martial, there were hopes the provisions of the Emergency Act could help supplement the pre-existing powers though a state of emergency was never declared.\n\nRevolution Too Close to Home: 1921 - 1922[]\n\nEscalation in Ireland[]\n\nDuring the latter period of 1920 and throughout 1921, the violence in Ireland began to rapidly escalate out of control with martial law proclaimed in Counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary in Munster during the Autumn. In January 1921 martial law was extended to the rest of Munster in Counties Clare and Waterford, as well as counties Kilkenny and Wexford in Leinster. All coroners' courts were suspended and replaced with \"military courts of enquiry\". The powers of military courts-martial were extended to cover the whole population and were empowered to use the death penalty and internment without trial; Government payments to local governments in Sinn Féin hands were suspended. Privately, Law made clear his continuing commitment to putting down the rebellion in Ireland by force of arms rather than negotiate with the republican leadership. As a result, violence escalated sharply after November 1920 until the summer of 1921. It was in this period that a mutiny broke out among the Connaught Rangers, stationed in India. Two were killed whilst trying to storm an armoury and one was later executed. At home, events that dramatically escalated the conflict unfolded with the Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney, dying on hunger strike in Brixton Prison in London in October, while two other IRA prisoners on hunger strike, Joe Murphy and Michael Fitzgerald, died in Cork Jail.\n\nSunday, 21 November 1920, was a day of dramatic bloodshed in Dublin that became known as Bloody Sunday. In the early morning, \"the Squad\" under Michael Collins, attempted to wipe out leading British intelligence operatives in the capital, in particular the so-called Cairo Gang, killing 16 men and wounding 5 others, rapidly damaging British intelligence in the city. In response, RIC men of the Black and Tans drove in trucks into Croke Park (Dublin's GAA football and hurling ground) during a football match, shooting into the crowd. Fourteen civilians were killed, including one of the players, Michael Hogan, and a further 65 people were wounded. Later that day two republican prisoners, Dick McKee, Peadar Clancy and an unassociated friend, Conor Clune who had been arrested with them, were killed in Dublin Castle. The official account was that the three men were shot \"while trying to escape\", which was rejected by Irish nationalists, who were certain the men had been tortured then murdered. IRA ambushes increased in intensity and in response, the government sanctioned \"official reprisals\" that amounted to house burnings. In December, the centre of Cork City was burnt out by the Black and Tans, responding to an ambush that had killed one of their own and wounded several others. Firefighters trying to tackle the blaze, and civilians who protected them, were shot at by the auxiliary forces. Lurid news of the atrocities shocked the liberal and left-wing sections of British society, with the Liberals and Labour both furiously attacking government conduct. When questioned in 1921 by the dissident Tory MP, Oswald Mosley, the Attorney-General for Ireland, Denis Henry, admitted before Parliament that he was informed by Commander-in-Chief Nevil Macready that 191 houses were destroyed in official reprisals in the area under Martial Law since January of that year. Buckling under pressure, Law agreed to open talks for a truce in late December of 1920 but these were soon scuppered when he and Lord Winterton declared the IRA must surrender their weapons first.\n\nUntil the Truce of November in 1921, there was a spiralling of the death toll in the conflict, with 1,000 people including the RIC police, army, IRA volunteers and civilians, being killed in the months between January and July 1921 alone, representing approximately 70% of the total casualties for the entire conflict. In addition, 4,500 IRA personnel (or suspected sympathisers) were interned in this time. In the middle of this violence, the Dáil Éireann acknowledged the state of war with Britain in March 1921 - it was not met with a response by the British government. This period of 1921 saw one of the worse escalations in the violence but in turn the IRA was gradually losing the material ability to continue the independence campaign with its Dublin forces seeing five men die and over eighty captured after their occupation of the Customs House. By July, IRA units on the ground were now chronically short of the necessary supplies to continue fighting and carrying out ambushes. IRA leader Richard Mulcahy commented that even when properly armed and supplied they could \"only take over a sizeable police barracks\" and actual military operations were out of the question. Nevertheless, the island itself remained in chaos from the IRA's successful guerrilla campaign and British authorities on the island acknowledged that defeating the IRA militarily was becoming increasingly infeasible. In response, the IRA opted to switch tactics and began targeting mainland Britain with Michael Collins wagering that the British government would not attempt to implement martial law at home and that even if it tried, the British public (and Opposition) would not tolerate it. While plans were drawn up, only two attacks were ever carried out; an unsuccessful prisoner rescue of IRA soldier, Frank J Carty, from Glasgow and the bombing of the Liverpool Dockyards. In both cases, IRA agents were shielded by local Irish and Catholic populations, sympathetic to the nationalist cause.\n\nFinally buckling to growing pressure, the government and IRA finally signed a truce on the 14th of July, going into effect on the following day, to later be known as the \"Assumption Truce\". Negotiations were frantic and initially not forthcoming with Conservative politician, Austen Chamberlain, commenting that if the government was seen as attempting to negotiate before \"a Republican dismissal\" they would be able to improve their standing. Law himself was not keen on the negotiations and was under the impression that the Republicans themselves would quickly withdraw giving his government a pretext for a reconquest of Ireland but by now both sides were wary of the war and at a breaking point. The Irish were rapidly running out of military material and now struggling to amount effective offensive operations whereas in Britain, the constant and lurid newsfeed of horrendous atrocities and bloody conduct shocked and outraged much of society, with the prospect of a \"War in England\" terrifying the rest. Law privately vented to his ministers that he felt \"his hand had been forced into making this wicked deal with the Irish Devils\" but Chancellor Austen Chamberlain claimed that Law was \"at least relieved to be rid of this Irish escapade.\" On November 10th, 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed amid much controversy in both Great Britain and Ireland. Law was only able to narrowly fend off a confidence vote from the Conservatives despite hostility from so-called \"Diehards\" within the party who felt Law had betrayed the Empire. The territories that had formally constituted \"Southern Ireland\" were now an independent republic, in association with and nominally allied, to the Commonwealth, while those territories that constituted \"Northern Ireland\" had been officially split off to form a devolved territory within the United Kingdom and the Northern MPs took their seats. Minor IRA campaigns continued in the North but the Irish chapter had, at last, been closed.\n\nAusterity & Recession[]\n\nWhile the events of the Irish war dominated the headlines, the economic situation in Great Britain continued to decline with the Ministry of Labour reporting that unemployment had officially hit 1,000,000 in early February. This number would peak in June, with over 2,500,000 reported as unemployed, over 24% of the workforce and the highest it had ever been since records began. Minor protectionist tariffs had been levied in 1920 though these were aimed nearly exclusively at the Mitteleuropa economic bloc and were largely punitive in nature; as such they did little to alleviate the general economic situation and Law faced increased calls from the Tariff Reformers of the Conservatives to either levy higher (and more widespread tariffs) or, more preferably, finally embrace the cause of tariff reform. Law was suspicious of both proposals and felt that he lacked a popular mandate to do so, particularly in light of the ongoing crisis in Ireland. On the suggestion of First Lord of the Admiralty and arch-tariff reformer, Leo Amery, Law endeavoured to establish the Empire Marketing Board as a substitute for further tariffs. To Law this was an ideal compromise: he himself was not a proponent of protectionism, rather he sided more with Lord Derby, though he felt it could appease the ardent supporters of Imperial Preference and Tariff Reform; for Amery it was just the beginning of a wider programme of protectionism as he wagered the projected success of the Board would soon make an \"indisputable case\" for Tariff Reform. The Board did not have the ability to introduce, propose or enforce tariffs but rather promoted intra-Empire trade via advertising and propaganda campaigns with the goal of persuading consumers to 'Buy Empire' alongside supporting scientific research towards improving imperial food production. The Marketing Board quickly garnered the support of the pro-Imperial Preference press barons, Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere, who believed this was simply the beginning of a wider and more interconnected Imperial economy.\n\nRothermere quickly folded support of the Marketing Board into his other, recently established, political campaign: the Anti-Waste League. Earlier in the year, Rotheremere publicly attacked the government's economic record amid the Depression and claimed that \"government waste\" was to blame for the lagging fortunes of British finances. A manifesto was quickly published under the auspices of the Anti-Waste League, attacking the retention of high income taxes and calling for radically decreased government expenditure at the national and local levels. \"Slothful civil servants\" and \"penny-pinching Ministers\" were condemned for their mishandling of the economy, particularly President of the Local Government Board, Lord Astor and the Homes Fit for Heroes Scheme. Despite promises of 500,000 homes being built in a three-year period, less than 100,000 had been built with pessimistic predictions unable to see even half the target being met by the end of the scheme's timeline. The creation of the Coal Commission also caught the League's ire as it was repeatedly publicised that savings in its first year had been negligible. The League quickly fought in multiple by-elections and allied with Horatio Bottomley's Independent Parliamentary Group. Nevertheless, the group was quickly mired by crisis when, during the 1921 Westminster Abbey by-election, all three candidates purported to be anti-waste, despite only one Anti-Waste candidate being endorsed. Brigadier-General Nicholson, theoretically the official Unionist nominee, described himself as 'Constitutional and Independent Conservative Anti-Waste', as opposed to Lieutenant R.V.K. Applin, Anti-Waste's official candidate, and Sir Arnold Lupton, a former Liberal MP who stood as an 'Independent Liberal and Anti-Waste'. Nicholson won and took the government whip, with junior minister Stanley Baldwin describing it as a \"glorious victory against Bottomleyite crankery.\" It was followed by another bizarre contest in West Lewisham of London where Sir Philip Dawson, Conservative and Anti-Waste, defeated Lieutenant-Commander Windham, the Anti-Waste candidate, by just 747 votes. Despite little electoral success (though they did elect some Independent Conservatives) the government opted to nip the issue in the bud and formed the Committee for National Expenditure, led by Eric Geddes, with the aim of cutting spending on the advice of leading businessmen. Though it did not publish its findings until late 1922 and was wound up by MacDonald, it was recalled in 1924 by the National Government of Austen Chamberlain.\n\nLikewise, the government was fearful of developments on the Continent with the victory of Communard France in the French Civil War and started to take a hard-line anti-Socialist stance in 1921. Britain's allies in the Republic had now been forced to flee the mainland and establish themselves in the North African city of Algiers, though the government remained publicly committed to supporting their French allies. Law and his ministers were deeply fearful of Communard interference over the channel, particularly amid rising industrial unrest by the miners and talks of the domestic socialist movement, still split between various outfits and ideological tendencies, apparently preparing to organise following assistance from Communard handlers. Furthermore, Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon was forced to privately allay the fears of his French counterpart, Alexandre Millerand, when the latter raised objections to the negotiations of an Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement, between Britain and the nascent RSFSR, the prior year. Millerand asked if the British would do the same for Red France; Curzon claimed that it was a \"domestic matter\" and necessary to curtail the influence of the Hands Off Russia movement - a thinly-veiled socialist campaign opposed to British intervention in the Russian Civil War - though Millerand was not convinced and accosted Curzon for his \"English duplicity.\" Curzon responded by referring to Millerand as a \"stinking toad\".\n\nStrike Season[]\n\nMain article: 1922 Miners Strike\n\nDespite wartime era forecasts by the Board of Trade, hopes of a post-war boom in the coal industry failed to materialise and it was the largest industry to experience its exports declining in both value and volume. Already caught up in the ongoing recession, the coal industry was particularly hard hit with unemployment and prices fluctuating. The industry continued to be under temporary state control and the government was set to surrender all wartime controls on the expiration of the present contracts, on March 31st. The plans for industry reorganisation prescribed by the Sankey Commission were still partially underway; the Coal Commission's bureaucracy was not entirely assembled and so far it had proven ineffective. Prices on the market for coal did not keep up with the Commission's estimates and it announced that it would be forced to lower the rate it would purchase coal at, in line with general austerity. In response, mine owners announced they would have no choice but to introduce wage cuts to make the mines profitable (the government had agreed to maintain the wartime wage levels for fear of a general strike) leading to a hostile reaction from the miners' unions and calls for a general strike. On April 1st, any miners who refused to accept the reductions were locked out of employment.\n\nFollowing the imposition of the reductions, it was widely expected that the transport and rail unions would strike in support of the miners with Herbert Smith, President of the MFGB calling upon the Triple Alliance to begin strike action. The government took immediate preparations in declaring a state of emergency by invoking the Emergency Act - its first ever use - and beginning the rationing of coal. However, on 15th April, the executives of the NTWF and NUR announced that they would not recommend or endorse strike action. The day was hereafter known as Black Friday and regarded as a deep betrayal by the miners. In his defence, Jimmy Thomas of the NUR cited comments made by MFGB General-Secretary, Frank Hodges; Hodges had, in talks with the government, admitted that the miners were \"prepared to consider a temporary settlement of wages, encompassing a living wage\" as opposed to their earlier demands of a \"National Pool\" to keep wages uniform across pits. This had not been accepted among the miners themselves, let alone the Triple Alliance and the three unions were soon mired in internal dispute and dissent. The railway and transport union leaders felt Hodges - and to a lesser extent, the miners altogether - would readily accept \"Tory Gold\" without consulting their comrades but yet expected their unconditional support in repeated industrial disputes. Union loyalty had become brittle and union leaders doubted they had the unity to force a national strike.\n\nDespite the decision against fully-fledged strike action, the miners nevertheless went on strike for some three months, with transport and rail workers ordered not to handle imported coal by their unions. Many workers were unhappy with this limited action, however, and unofficial strikes broke out across the country. In Glasgow, for example, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers broke with the policy of the Transport Workers' Federation and called its members out on strike on 7 May. On the same day, wage reductions were imposed on merchant seamen, leading to a well-supported general strike at the docks which lasted for over a month. Transport and rail leaders were widely criticised for their actions, with Thomas of the NUR and Robert Williams of the NTWF being singled out for particular criticism. Thomas again came to his own defence by claiming that during a time of high unemployment, it could not be expected that workers should jeopardise their livelihoods for \"ephemeral paypackets\" and that ultimately, there was simply little sympathy among the rank-and-file. Following the events of Black Friday, the Triple Alliance was severely weakened and all but destroyed. Solidarity between the three unions seemed more theoretical than real and following the events of the spring, relations were cold. Hodges had effectively destroyed his career and was widely regarded as a \"Judas\" by his colleagues for their betrayal. Austen Chamberlain commented that the \"miners needed a sacrificial lamb and Hodges was particularly woolly.\" In the Autumn of 1921, Hodges resigned facing the possibility of being forcibly ousted, no longer having the backing of his nominal superior in Smith. To replace Hodges, the Welsh militant and syndicalist sympathiser, A. J. Cook was elected as the new General-Secretary the next February. Cook would seek to rebuild relations between the Triple Alliance, making an unlikely - and uneasy - ally in Ernest Bevin, who sought to do the same. Nevertheless, in the absence of three-way solidarity, the General Council of the Trade Unions Congress had taken precedence in the handling of intra-trade union relations. Bevin was deeply suspicious of the Council's \"radicalism\" though Cook later commented it was, \"this solidarity of working men, of all the jobs and all the trades, that delivered the goods in our hour of need.\"\n\nIn a rare victory for the government, mass strike action had been averted and the miners had been thoroughly humbled, taking on even worse conditions than they had been offered in the initial cuts. Anger filled the pits and collieries and while it would not fully bubble over into the new year, it would see growing political developments on both the right and left. Shortly after Black Friday, reactionary activist, Rotha Lintorn-Orman claimed that she had a \"most enlightening epiphany\" and sought to stop an alleged socialist infiltration of the nation. Out of these fears, and a growing desire to fight back against the tide of socialism, she formed the paramilitary organisation and political party, the British Legion. The Legion quickly garnered interest among the societal elite and was able to siphon off support from the crumbling National Party, though it would not come to major prominence until its participation in labour clashes later on in 1922. To complement the disparate organisation of the far-right, the far-left too had been organising with talks of forming a \"united communist party\" beginning as early as mid-1921. The British Socialist Party, the largest of the far-left parties and the only one with representation in parliament (counting three MPs after Cecil L'Estrange Malone crossed the floor) functioned as a proto-communist party but it was increasingly rivaled by the De Leonist Socialist Labour Party. The leadership of both parties agreed to a tripartite merger with the South Wales Socialist Society to form the Syndicalist Party of Great Britain. The party was fraught with internal factionalism and division at first, particularly over leadership. Albert Inkpin of the Leninist British Socialist Party made a bid for leadership but was defeated by the SLP organiser, Tom Bell, who was declared General-Secretary. Bell had Arthur MacManus appointed Chairman and offered Inkpin the position of Treasurer, which he accepted. Unity had prevailed and a policy campaign of revolutionary syndicalism, internationalism, pacifism and \"cooperation of opportunity\" towards the Labour Party was agreed on. All three BSP MPs switched to the SPGB and the party quickly absorbed the \"Guild Communist\" faction of the National Guilds League, assorted shop stewards' and workers' committees, socialist clubs and many former branches of the Hands Off Russia campaign. Numerous branches of Independent Labour Party also affiliated with the growing party. Sylvia Pankhurst's Communist Party (British Section of the Third International), and Willie Gallacher's Scottish Syndicalist Party were absorbed over the summer. However, \"left-communists\" within the party led by Sylvia Pankhurst had grown discontent at the policy direction of the SPGB - particularly its intention to stand parliamentary candidates - and so she and a group of her supporters splintered to found the British Communist Party as a more orthodox Marxist rival to the SPGB, albeit one that never surpassed 1,000 members.\n\nWhile the Autumn and Winter had brought a slight lull in industrial unrest, with the miners now begrudgingly accepting the new rates, Law's administration was beset by another political cause célèbre during the Poplar Rates Rebellion. Poplar Borough was one of the poorest in London and as such, it had to collect increasingly high rates from its residents (as they were calculated against rents) to match the same payments that more affluent boroughs could receive. The Labour Mayor of Poplar and future revolutionary leader, George Lansbury, had overseen a policy of charging high rates to provide direly needed municipal services for Poplar's residents. Nevertheless, the Council was still expected to pay precepts for cross-London services such as London County Council such and the Metropolitan Police. Facing further rate increases crippling an already impoverished borough, Lansbury - with the backing of 30 Poplar Councillors - refused to pay the precepts. The County Council sued in the High Court and the council's response was to organise a procession of 2,000 supporters from Bow in a march to the Strand, as led by Lansbury. Lansbury and the councilors were swiftly arrested for being held in contempt of court. The issue rapidly spiraled out of control when it emerged that one of the councilors, Nellie Cressall, was pregnant. The Home Secretary, the Viscount Cave, took much of the brunt of the ensuing outrage with John Wheatley, a Labour councilor in Glasgow calling for the Home Secretary to \"hang his head in shame at this rank injustice.\" Imprisoning a heavily pregnant woman became a political embarrassment with the councilors gaining much sympathy. Lord Cave intervened and Cressall was offered release on compassionate grounds though she refused until her colleagues were also released. Cressal was only convinced by Labour leader in London, Harry Gosling and her colleagues were released after public pressure some weeks later. The \"Rebellion\" and the advent of \"Poplarism\" inspired similar protests across the country by left-wing councils. Law remarked to Chamberlain, \"I fear this year is just the beginning of some Hellish gauntlet to come.\"\n\nIndeed, the next year would bring about more industrial unrest with the formation of the Transport and General Workers Union in January. The formation of the TGWU saw the amalgamation of 14 separate trade unions across its respective areas. By membership itwas one of the largest trade unions in both Britain and the world. A power struggle for leadership emerged but was quickly won out by radical labourite, Ben Tillett. A powerful figure in the dockers' unions, Tillett had become notable for his leadership in the London dock strike of 1889 and had been critical of the dockers' refusal to support the miners. Having placed his deputy, Ernest Bevin, in charge of rebuilding relations with the Triple Alliance, the path to leadership of the TGWU laid open and Tillett was elected on a campaign described as \"loud-mouthed demagoguery and furious inferno dressed up as radicalism and righteous outrage,\" by Clement Attlee. Tillett was not a syndicalist himself - he nominally belonged to the Labour Party - but he held close ties to the party on account of his deep friendship with Tom Mann, who reportedly tried to convince him to take membership. Control of one of the most powerful unions in the hands of an SPGB member was a terrifying prospect for Law's cabinet but they would not have to wait long for it to be made reality. Just over a month later in the middle of February, Arthur Cook, a man described as a \"raving communist\", had been installed as the MFGB General-Secretary.\n\nFears of industrial action became more widespread when Cook announced in the Spring that he would be seeking a \"new settlement\" regarding the state of mining in the country. Preparations for coal rationing were debated and eventually implemented by April with the Coal Commission announcing its plans to stockpile some 2.5 million tonnes of coal by the end of the Summer. However, despite relative quiet from the miners, disaster would strike on the 18th of May when a pit explosion was reported at the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Colliery in Barnsley, West Yorkshire. Over 120 men died in the initial incident and a further 12 men died across multiple rescue attempts in what would become the worst mining disaster in Yorkshire history. By the end of the month, over 1,000 miners in Barnsley had signed on for unemployment and an outpouring of public support swept the nation. The Mayor of Barnsley on behalf of the YMA, Sam Jones; the Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding, Henry Lascelles and the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Edward Moore, all set up relief funds that alone raised £500,000 in aid, with smaller private schemes being setup. The Prince of Wales was publicly outspoken in favour of the miners and made a private donation to the relief fund. A highly controversial and emotive inquiry was established at the West Riding Police Court at Barnsley though it was ultimately judged that the cause of the explosions was inconclusive and no wrongdoing could be proven by the courts.\n\nEven during the inquiry, sympathy strikes (and some lockouts) had erupted across Yorkshire but following the results that cleared the mine owners of wrongdoing, industrial tensions flared. Herbert Smith, President of the MFGB immediately attacked the inquiry for perceived bias and aiding in a cover-up by the mine owners. Balloting of the YMA was swift and returned an 87% majority in favour of strike action. Fearful of nation-wide strike action, or worse - a general strike - Law announced that coal would enter a state of limited rationing. Secretary for the Mines, William Bridgeman, assured Law that \"large-scale strike action is not likely,\" and that \"the incident in Yorkshire is but a small outburst and a purely provincial problem.\" On this advice, the government held off from full-scale rationing or invoking the Emergency Act though it did open secret talks with Canada and Norway to ensure that coal imports could keep the nation afloat. The situation quickly turned dire when by the mid-summer, strike action had quickly spread out from Yorkshire to the North of England with sympathy strikes in Wales and Scotland soon becoming full-blown strike action. By mid-August, a ballot in favour of nation-wide strike action by the MFGB received a majority of 72% in favour. The Miners Strike had now begun in earnest.\n\nIn retaliation, the government invoked the Emergency Act and the military was deployed to striking areas to reinforce police activities. Coal rationing was implemented in full and employers began to cut the hours of work available to their staff. Initially, the TUC had not mandated strike-action for other unions - the miners had not requested it - and the other members of the Triple Alliance initially remained outside of the strike. However, by the end of the summer, MFGB Secretary Cook had managed to deftly negotiate both the dockers and railwaymen into joining the strike. The General Council of the TUC did not endorse a General Strike of all workers but gave its support to those members of the Triple Alliance that announced their intentions to strike, TUC General Secretary, C. W. Bowerman and TUC President, Robert Walker both giving their 'utmost support to the plight of the miners.' Bowerman, while suspicious of \"syndicalist interference\" and the motivations of Cook, called on the government to host a new inquiry after the fallout of the first. Those railwaymen and dockers involved initially led a period of collective picketing known as the Week of Discontent in which essential services were halted. Law's government had prepared rationing for a miners' strike but had not expected wider industrial action leading to economic disruption. Following the Triple Alliance strike, fears of a wider general strike did not materialise and it was agreed that the railwaymen and dockers would - rather than picketing - refuse to handle imported coal, forcing the government to rely exclusively on the Coal Commission's stockpiles. The Commission announced further rationing measures and less coal was made available to the market. The strike came to a halt at the end of the year amid a truce in which the government offered to establish a commission to investigate the conditions of the mines on what became known as Red Friday. Cook had wished to continue the strike in an attempt to secure better wages as well, but this was an unpopular proposal and it was agreed the miners would take time to regroup.\n\nDespite the end of this crisis, the Law government, already on shaky ground, finally collapsed in the winter of 1922. Amid rumours of further strike action planned for after the winter, now for better pay, Law called a snap election for January in an attempt to catch the miners off guard. While the miners had courted much sympathy, Conservative HQ contemplated that public solidarity would have declined over the course of a harsh winter and by campaigning on a platform of \"ending trade union tyranny to end public strife\" would serve as a mandate for curbing the miners' power. Initial predictions were optimistic for the Conservatives, with even Labour and trade union officials worrying this could turn into a \"black election\" that would go far beyond the crushing defeat of Black Friday. Beatrice Webb wrote in her diary that it was an example of \"wicked strategy\" and worried that the Conservatives would increase their slim majority. But in a shock upturn of events, just weeks before the election - scheduled for the 4th January 1923 - the President of the Board of Trade, Stanley Baldwin returned to Great Britain from America. Baldwin had headed to Washington in November, returning on the 12th of December, to negotiate the repayment of Britain’s war debts and also, more informally, attempt to rebuild relations with the Americans. Owing to a multitude of factors such as the Franco-Italian financial situation vis-a-vis debt repayments; the war with Ireland and the rebuilding of the Royal Navy, the government estimated that annual repayments of around £16 million a year were possible at most, provided Russia serviced her debts properly.\n\nHowever, Baldwin was at this stage a relatively inexperienced Trade minister who had already blundered through recovering from recent aftershocks of the strike. His inexperience already doing him no favours, he is reported to have \"taken a harsh approach at first and offended the American hosts\" before eventually being talked into increasing payments to appease them. By the end of the negotiations, Baldwin had been persuaded to agree to £40 million a year instead by the American delegation. The cabinet had not been informed of this sudden upswing in projected payments nor been consulted on it before it was signed; senior ministers learned alongside the public at large when Baldwin announced the deal to the press on the docks at Southampton and was quickly skewered in the press for his naivety and further damaging of British finances. Upon learning of the new terms, the cabinet was horrified and Law reportedly took Baldwin to one side and informed him that \"with regret\" Baldwin's already lacking career had come to an abrupt end. Law did not even have the ability to sack Baldwin owing to the incoming election and privately informed top cabinet officials he intended to resign immediately. He was only narrowly talked down and convinced not to follow in the footsteps of Lloyd-George, but he made it clear in no uncertain terms this election would be his last. Law's only recompense in the Baldwin debacle came in the form of a series of anonymous letters written to the Times in which he chastised Baldwin from the perspective of a \"concerned citizen.\" Already suffering from rapidly deteriorating health and now expecting a battering in the elections, the Prime Minister had all but lost the fight and prepared for the final humiliation of his career.\n\nThe MacDonald Government: 1923[]\n\nDiscontent & Crisis[]\n\nMain article: Curzon Crisis\n\nThe 1923 British General Election was held on the 4th of January, 1923, resulting in a hung parliament. The Conservatives won 240 seats while Labour won 191 and polled the highest popular vote. Neither party could form a majority and as per convention, Law was briefly allowed to continue his Premiership but his government collapsed on the 10th of January following the Liberals and Labour voting together to reject the Conservative-prepared King's Speech. Law announced his intention to resign but caused the so-called \"King's Dilemma\" when he was unwilling and unable to provide advice on who his successor would be. The leading man in the Commons, Chancellor Austen Chamberlain, would be an unacceptable candidate to the Liberals on account of being the leader of the quasi-protectionist, Tariff Reform movement, making the choice all the more difficult. Speculation emerged that Lord Curzon, long believed to be the most likely candidate, was now slated for the Premiership. Curzon - a member of the House of Lords - had previously served as the Viceroy of India and was the current Foreign Secretary, though despite his administrative talents he was widely disliked for his arrogant personality. Furthermore, it remained unclear (and was regarded as unsensible) if a Lord could become Prime Minister. While his name had been acknowledged by Law, Balfour - who was also advising the King - warned against him and the King shared Balfour's personal prejudices against the man. Fearful of the lack of a suitable alternative 'binding the King's hands', an anonymous figure in the Conservative Party leaked correspondences relating to the affair in the so-called 'Cato Letters' warning against the appointment of a Lord to the Premiership. In the aftermath, a week of public outrage followed with a latent republican and anti-establishment sentiment coming to the surface. Protests against Curzon, the Peerage and the state of the nation filled major cities as the public vented their discontent with the Tory government and the political establishment.\n\nAmid the constitutional crisis, Asquith and the Liberals had been leading quiet negotiations with Labour about the possibility of forming a government. Labour, now the official opposition, was tipped to lead and found its support swelling from discontented workers and radical agitators, both eager for change. Believing that Labour would stumble in office and prove its policy programme unworkable, Asquith committed the Liberals to supporting a Labour government on the basis of a confidence-and-supply agreement. All other bills would be handled on a case-by-case basis though these were terms amicable to MacDonald who was eager and willing to form an administration. Unemployment continued to rise and the nation was still recovering from the immense disruption of the 1922 Miners Strike; to Labour this was now ample time to prove their programme and reverse the economic downturn. MacDonald himself was cautiously worried about Labour's chances at passing meaningful reform but nevertheless felt ready to take the opportunity. After some negotiation, the Liberals informed the King they were prepared to support a Labour government and urged him to send for MacDonald. The first Labour government was formed on the 6th of February, 1923 and Ramsay MacDonald was formally appointed Prime Minister. At this time, Law continued as the de jure leader of the Conservative Party and so took the position of Leader of the Opposition in the interim though he was ultimately succeeded by Balfour's protégé and leader of the tariff reform campaign, Austen Chamberlain.\n\nDespite jubilation throughout much of the Labour Party, the political left was also marked by discontent at MacDonald's appointment. Robert Smillie, the Labour MP for Morpeth, believed that MacDonald had made a serious mistake in forming a government: \"At last we had a Labour Government! I have to tell you that I did not share in that jubilation. In fact, had I had a voice in the matter which, as a mere back-bencher I did not, I would have strongly advised MacDonald not to touch the seals of office with the proverbial bargepole. Indeed, I was very doubtful indeed about the wisdom of forming a Government. Given the arithmetic of the situation, we could not possibly embark on a proper Socialist programme.\" G.D.H. Cole pointed out that MacDonald was in a difficult position. If he refused to form a government \"it would have been widely misrepresented as showing Labour's fears of its own capacity, and it would have meant leaving the unemployed to their plight.\" Left-wing members of the Labour Party, such as James Maxton and Smilie, suggested that MacDonald should accept office and then immediately invite defeat by putting forward an openly socialist programmeme that would antagonise not only the Conservatives but their Liberal partners. The proposal was declared impossible on the basis that the party could not financially afford another election and would be able to stand few candidates. MacDonald caused further dismay among the increasingly militant ranks of Labour when he arrived at his first meeting with the King in full court dress. The Private Secretary to the Sovereign, Lord Stamdfordham, commented that it posed a humorous situation in which the King, believing he would cause offense to MacDonald, opted to dress in less formal clothing. After a stunted start, the two men received each other cordially and MacDonald was formally requested to form a government by the King.\n\nLabour in Downing Street[]\n\nThe MacDonald Ministry was announced shortly after his appointment, though the Prime Minister was faced with the immediate challenges of running a government on unstable ground; benches that lacked the necessary ministerial experience to make up a cabinet and the growing outburst of radicalism among Labour's left which was exacerbating factional tensions. MacDonald would be forced to tread carefully, not wishing to cause a civil war in his government or antagonise his Liberal backers. Furthermore, the government had only three Lords (though some more were created upon taking office) which led to speculation that a future showdown between the government and the Lords would erupt, as had done in 1911. While MacDonald was sympathetic to the egalitarian policy of ridding Parliament of the Lords, he predicted this would never be permitted by the Liberals and that instead, Labour should show the nation it was 'fit to govern'. This was not necessarily in the form of concrete policy-making but allaying fears that Labour were preparing to dismantle the country and install a Communard regime. To the dismay of the Labour left, acting 'respectably' meant that policies such as nationalisation and the capital levy tax were ignored while programmes for public works were downplayed so as to garner Liberal support. Rather than indulge in sweeping changes that ran the risk of inviting political turmoil and a backlash against Labour, MacDonald sought to use more incremental reforms to ease the tremendous plight of the working class but not antagonise the nation, paving the way for more ambitious plans in the future.\n\nDespite lacking a parliamentary majority, the First Labour Government was able to introduce a number of measures which made life more tolerable for working people. Provisions for the unemployed and sick were increased with unemployment benefit payments increased from 15 shillings (75p) to 18 shillings (90p) a week for men, and from 12 shillings (60p) to 15 shillings (75p) for women, while the children's allowance was doubled to two shillings. Means testing on households and the \"gap\" between when one could be on benefits were both abolished, with the time permitted to be on benefits extended. However, a clause was added enforcing those receiving the benefits to be \"genuinely seeking work\" which drew critique from within Labour. The restrictions which prevented people from other countries, short-time workers, married women, and single persons residing with relatives from claiming uncovenanted benefits were abolished. Increases were made in both old-age pensions and the pensions of ex-servicemen and their widows and children. Small incomes from savings were now disregarded in calculating pensions and as a result of this change, 60,000 elderly people, whose meagre savings had previously reduced their pension entitlement, received the full state pension. Eligibility for the state pension was also extended so that it covered 70% of the over-seventies, and 150,000 elderly people who had never received pensions before were now entitled to them. Furthermore, the Old Age Pensions Act 1923 guaranteed a weekly pension of ten shillings (50p) to people over the age of seventy who earned under 15 shillings (75p) a week. For the first time, Miner's silicosis was included in the provisions for workmen's compensation and the entitlement of sickness allowances to war widows and orphans was extended. Higher spending on education and health was carried out, while sickness grants (which had been abolished under Law's administration) were restored. For war pensioners, new pensions were provided \"in deserving cases at the rate of over three hundred a week\" and military pay was increased. The Boards for Agriculture and Local Government both became full Ministries, for Agriculture and Health respectively.\n\nLikewise, the government endeavoured to extend educational opportunities for children, and adults via a major overhaul under the oversight of President of Education, Charles Philips Trevelyan. Local authorities were empowered, on their own accord, to raise the school-leaving age to 15; the adult education grant was tripled; maintenance allowances for young people in secondary schools were increased; state scholarships (which had previously been in suspense) were restored; the proportion of free places in secondary schools was increased; approval was given to forty new secondary schools and a survey was carried out to provide for the replacement of insanitary and obsolete schools. Later in the year, forty pupils was set as the maximum class size in elementary & primary schooling. Restrictions on education spending imposed by the previous government were removed, while local authorities were encouraged to increase the number of free secondary school places. In addition, the Education Act 1923 was passed which created an English secondary school system between the ages of 11–14. The restriction on maintenance allowances given by Local Authorities was removed; the previous rule was that 20% of the expenditure was given as a grant by the Board to the Local Authorities, and this law raised it to 50%. In addition, restrictions on grants for providing meals for children were removed. Spending on adult education was increased, with the grant-in-aid increased from £20,600 to £30,500 pounds. Furthermore, a 5% reduction on admissions to training colleges (imposed in 1922) was withdrawn.\n\nThe restrictions imposed by the previous government on spending by the Poplar Board of Guardians were removed, while the National Health Insurance (Cost of Medical Benefit) Bill revised the capitation fee paid to doctors. Restrictions introduced by the previous government on state grants to the principal public health grant earning services (including maternity and child welfare, tuberculosis, and venereal disease) were removed. This was followed by a circular issued to local authorities to this effect and enabling them \"to carry out more effectively their public health powers under the law.\" Child welfare and maternity services were extended, while ex-service patients who had been treated as \"pauper lunatics\" under former Governments were removed from being treated in that way. As a result of this change, they were now paid for out of public funds. A circular was issued that removed restrictions on grants for health services, an action which led to the extension of welfare schemes for childhood and maternity. 70 new infant welfare centres were opened; more health visitors had been appointed; many more beds had been provided in homes for mothers and babies; and the milk supply was extended in 16 cases. As a result of the circular, for TB, about 1,500 new beds had been arranged by the local authorities. The new Scottish Board of Health also withdrew the restrictions imposed under the previous Conservative government upon the expenditure to be incurred in the public health services, and consequently there were developments affecting port sanitation, tuberculosis, the welfare of the blind, and maternity and child welfare. The Board also extended grants to local authorities for the purpose of slum clearance.\n\nAddressing the issue of unemployment was a major project of the government, though particular focus was placed on the fall of wages for those still employed. Minimum wages for agricultural workers were restored and county committees were established with the power to fix wages, and together with a central wages board to supervise the county awards. The act helped bring about a substantial improvement over most of the country, with agricultural wages being quickly increased to 30 shillings a week (a higher level in certain counties) under the wage committees. Conservative plans to attenuate trade board powers were dropped and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden oversaw cuts to both direct and indirect taxation via lifting duties on foodstuffs though he never pursued a capital levy. Snowden described the programme as representing \"the greatest step ever taken towards the Radical idea of the free breakfast table.\" Free trade became a central policy of the government and, to fight unemployment, subsidies were given to agricultural cultivation and municipal works while schemes for roads and bridges, land reclamation and drainage, and afforestation in rural areas were extended. A scheme for beautifying St. James’ Park was carried out with a large measure of success, while additional areas of parkland were allocated for games in Bushey Park, Richmond Park, and Regent's Park. Lawn-tennis courts were opened in Bushey Park, while two more playgrounds were provided for children in Regent's Park and one in Greenwich Park. To the dismay of more pacifist-inclined members of the cabinet, the government opted to continue the Dreadnought Race as a means of keeping unemployment under control. Unfortunately, Snowden and Jowett's schemes did little to alleviate the problem, with unemployment dropping less than 2% by 1924.\n\nUltimately, the main achievement of the government was the 1923 Wheatley Housing Act, which MacDonald dubbed 'our most important legislative item'. This measure went some way towards rectifying the problem of the housing shortage, caused by the disruption of the building trade during the Great War and the inability of working-class tenants to rent decent, affordable housing. Wheatley, the President of the Local Government Board and then Minister of Health, scrapped the Geddes-Astor programme of limited subsidies for private house-builders and shifted towards a policy of providing public housing to council tenants and general slum clearances in the urban centres. The act was repealed the next year but re-instituted in 1926 by the Union of Britain and estimated to have overseen the construction of over 550,000 rented homes at controlled rents by 1933, when the Act was amended. Furthermore, Wheatley saw laws introduced which modified the right of a landlord to obtain possession of a house for his own family's use, where unnecessary hardship would be caused to the tenant. The Protection from Eviction Act of 1923 provided some degree of protection to tenants \"in the face of landlords seeking vacant possession and rent rises.\" This legislation protected tenants from eviction by landlords who attempted to obtain \"decontrolled\" status for their properties to raise rents. In addition, government funds were allocated for the repair and modernisation of 60,000 government built houses.\n\nMacDonald's Downfall[]\n\nThe downfall of the Labour government can ultimately be blamed on red-baiting and fears of interference by Communard Paris. Even prior to MacDonald's ascension to office, Lord Rothermere and the Daily Mail ran political pieces urging the King not to appoint a Labour government lest he wish to put himself in peril. MacDonald's appointment promptly caused dismay among the political right and much of the hardliners of the Conservative Party who distrusted MacDonald and his cabinet, believing they were in the thrall of Paris to varying degrees. The National Party formally abandoned any notion that it would work with Labour and formally pegged itself to the Conservative Party via the creation of the National Constitutional Association, a right-wing pressure group within the Conservatives, that allowed National Party members to hold dual membership. The far-right British Legion was openly hostile to the concept of a Labour government and its leadership spoke out against MacDonald, notably at a rally in Kensington Gardens in the spring of 1923. Despite this, during the dockers strike of the summer, Rotha Lintorn-Orman and R.B.D. Blakeney penned a joint letter to Arthur Henderson, the Home Secretary, offering him the services of the Legion in suppressing the strike. Henderson did not respond and the strike ended before Legion involvement.\n\nOne of the often invoked attacks against MacDonald was his alleged passivity against strikes. With the trade unions sympathetic to his administration, and many of their own now in government, there were no major strikes and among those minor ones that did break out, they were quickly ended, usually by giving into the strikers demands. MacDonald was tempted to use the Emergency Act during the Southend Tram Strike, in May. One of the conductors, a Mr. L. Loyd, was struck off for allegedly allowing passengers to ride without paying despite evidence he had attempted to stop them. Angered at such a trivial matter, and already bitter over poor wages, the tram drivers declared a strike bringing public transport in the area to a grinding halt. Initial talks collapsed and to prevent the strike from spreading to other public transport workers - as well as train drivers - the government weighed in to ensure Mr. Loyd was returned to work. While the incident was minor, MacDonald was lambasted in the press for his \"surrender to trade union tyranny\" and allegations emerged of Loyd being a member of the Syndicalist Party. Despite being a trivial matter, the event invited attacks on the London Traffic Act 1923 - which regulated privately owned public transport in the city - and it survived a near defeat in the Lords, passing after Lord Parmoor convinced the opposition to abstain rather than vote it down.\n\nThe month would also see the Labour government face its first major crisis following a diplomatic fiasco involving the two French governments. The previous Conservative government had upheld the Entente Cordial and continued to recognise the French Government-in-Exile, the Algiers Government over its Communard rival in Paris. Nevertheless, Anglo-French relations remained cold between the two allies and the Algiers regime remained suspicious of their British counterparts, particularly over the handling of relations with the defunct Soviet Union. The Labour Party held little sympathy for Algiers, which had grown increasingly unstable and reactionary in nature, despite the veneer of remaining a democratic republic. Foreign Secretary E.D. Morel, a French-born but naturalised British citizen, held a particular hostility for Algiers and encouraged MacDonald to instead switch British diplomatic allegiance to the Communards. Privately, Morel's interests were personally and racially motivated, but he justified his proposal on the basis that Algiers was becoming an increasing liability for British interests and its revanchist character would see Britain dragged into a chaotic international war. The government informed Parliament of its plans to negotiate two treaties pertaining to Anglo-Communard trade and the possibility of regaining compensation for British property that had been nationalised. Both the Conservatives and Liberals were hostile to the proposed treaties, with the Conservative MP, William Joynson-Hicks, leading angry rebuttals against MacDonald's \"stab in the back\" of British allies. The Algiers government openly condemned MacDonald and the treaties were abandoned in June.\n\nThe government was further shook by the events of the Campbell Case in early August. On 25th July 1923, the Daily Worker, the official SPGB newspaper, published an \"Open Letter to the Fighting Forces\" that had been written anonymously by Harry Pollitt. The article called on soldiers to \"let it be known that, neither in the class war nor in a military war, will you turn your guns on your fellow workers, but instead will line up with your fellow workers in an attack upon the exploiters and capitalists and will use your arms on the side of your own class.\" After consultations with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General, Sir Patrick Hastings, MacDonald reluctantly decided to arrest and charge, John Ross Campbell, the editor of the newspaper, with incitement to mutiny. The following day, Hastings had to answer questions in the House of Commons on the case. However, after investigating Campbell in more detail, Hastings discovered that Campbell was only acting editor at the time the article was published; Hastings began to have doubts about the success and fairness of a prosecution, warning MacDonald that even if it did pass through the courts, it would be a \"grave legal injustice.\"\n\nThe matter was further complicated when, some days later, the ILP notable and left-wing MP, James Maxton, informed Hastings about Campbell's war record. In the Great War, Campbell was posted to the Clydeside section of the Royal Naval division and served throughout the war. Wounded at Gallipoli, he was permanently disabled at the battle of the Somme, where he was awarded the Military Medal for conspicuous bravery. Hastings was now deeply troubled about the possible reaction to the idea of a war hero being prosecuted for an article published in a small circulation newspaper and decided that he had no stomach to carry out a potentially spurious prosecution or face the potential backlash. At a meeting on the morning of the 6th of August, Hastings told MacDonald that he thought that \"the whole matter could be dropped\". MacDonald agreed that the issue was \"certainly overblown\" but replied that prosecutions, once entered into, should not be dropped under political pressure. At a Cabinet meeting that evening, Hastings revealed that he had a letter from Campbell confirming his temporary editorship. Hastings also added that the case should be withdrawn on the grounds that the article merely commented on the use of troops in industrial disputes. MacDonald agreed with this assessment and agreed the prosecution could now be safely dropped.\n\nOn 13th August, the case was quietly withdrawn by the Attorney-General's office but the matter was quickly picked upon by the right-wing Liberal MP, John Simon who brought its attention to parliament. Simon and Joynson-Hicks joined together to issue a stinging condemnation against the government for being soft on syndicalism and refusing to prosecute \"open mutineers and purveyors of seditious material.\" MacDonald, who had a history of being on the left of the ILP but had since moved more right-ward, told King George, \"you have never seen me as a Minister without making me feel that you were also seeing me as a friend. I ask you now to trust my judgement, for honesty compels me to tell you I am no syndicalist.\" The King weighed in and attempted to afford his support, calling for calmness and for the opposition to allow MacDonald to handle the affair but the the damage had been done and MacDonald was painted in the press as a syndicalist sympathiser. The Daily Worker and Campbell publicly gave their thanks to MacDonald for stopping the prosecution, but this simply made the situation worse as Conservative MPs took this as a sign that MacDonald was in league with the SPGB. Edward Stanley, the Earl of Derby, attacked MacDonald in parliament and asked, if forced to speak under oath, would MacDonald declare his loyalty to London or France.\n\nThe final, and most serious crisis occurred in the latter half of the year when, on the 20th October 1923, MI5 received a copy of a letter, dated the 15th of September, allegedly sent by Marcel Cachin, a high-ranking politician in France, to Arthur McManus, the British rep"
