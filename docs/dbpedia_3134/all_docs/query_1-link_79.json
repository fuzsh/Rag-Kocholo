The following excerpts cover the author's treatment of land as a factor of production and rent as wealth:\n\n\" Rent is defined as the share of the produce which can be secured (under free competition) by those who are allowed to exercise rights of proprietorship over natural objects and forces.\"\n\n\"... it is evident that all wealth comes ultimately from the land.\"\n\n\"...The fundamental cause which enables landowners to obtain rent is the difference in fertility and utility that exists between the various portions of the earth's surface. ...It may be stated as a general truth, that whatever tends to bring fresh and inferior lands under cultivation, tends also to raise the rents of all land previously cultivated. Tus when a community advances in wealth and population there is a rise in rents, unless some counterbalancing force is operating.\"\n\n\"...The rent of land for building purposes in towns is subject to the same law as that of agricultural land; only that we should have to speak of the difference in convenience instead of the difference of produce.\"\n\n\"... in reality all rent in the politico-economic sense is 'unearned'; for it is by its very definition a payment made for gifts of nature, and not for the produce of labour.\"\n\nToynbee,\n\nArnold England\n\n1852 - Born, 23 August, in Syria\n\n1873 - Entered Oxford University to study political economy\n\n1878 - Joined the faculty of Balliol College\n\n1883 - Lecture, A Criticism of Mr. Henry George\n\n(Part 1), January\n\n1883 - Lecture, A Criticism of Mr. Henry George\n\n(Part 2), January\n\n1883 - Died\n\n1909 - Review (unsigned) of the book:\n\nIndustrial Revolution of the Eighteenth Century\n\nThe Public, 7 May\n\n1913 - Comment by Frederick Rogers in Labour, Life and Literature regarding the reason for Toynbee's decline in health:\n\n\"As [Toynbee] saw the book [Progress and Poverty, by Henry George] it was full of economic heresies, and he resolved to answer them. Of weak physique, but full of a poassionate spiritual enthusiasm, he gave two lectures at St. Andrews's Hall, Oxford Street, against the book and the effort ended his career.
