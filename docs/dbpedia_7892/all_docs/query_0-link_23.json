Problem is, all but one are still awaiting the nod from Beijing to formally run in the Asian financial hub.\n\nHong Kong’s chief executive will be chosen by a 1,200-member election committee in March, a process that inspired the Occupy protests in 2014. Known locally as a “small-circle election,” it involves less than 0.2 percent of the city’s 7.3 million people ."
