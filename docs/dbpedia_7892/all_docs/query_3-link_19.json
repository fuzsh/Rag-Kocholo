        "text": "Some senior officials, academics, political and business figures agreed that Mr Tung would change his style and strategy of governance in his second term.\n\nBeyond Lower Albert Road, Liberal Party chief James Tien Pei-chun will play a pivotal role in the Legco cross-party coalition in their powerplay with the administration.\n\nAs Democratic Party chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming is ready to stand down as chairman, as required under its party constitution, vice-chairman Lee Wing-tat has emerged as the likely successor of the democratic flagship.\n\nDemocratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong's Tsang Yok-sing appears to be one of the top contenders for a seat in the new Tung team if Mr Tung decides to build a ruling coalition with the participation of major political parties. Both he and Mr Tien are tipped to be a candidate for the new Exco.\n\nECONOMY\n\nFinancial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung faces a defining year with his first budget to be delivered at a time of unprecedented strain on the public purse. The former banker faces a harsh task with falling tax revenues, rising expenditure and a sickly economy that remains hostage to global recessionary forces.\n\nHe faces widespread calls for economic relief in the shape of tax breaks and reduced service charges but is hemmed in by a budget deficit that in December was projected to hit HK$60 billion for the full financial year.\n\nHis predecessor, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, avoided radical changes to Hong Kong's simple tax code and Mr Leung has remained on the fence over contentious issues such as the introduction of a sales tax.\n\nAny move to raise taxes in such a weak economic environment will be fraught with political trouble. His alternative is to cut spending with particular focus likely to fall on large scale infrastructure projects and public housing programmes. Much will depend on the quality of Mr Leung's budget speech performance. He has yet to carve out a strong public persona and seriously address Hong Kong's tax conundrum that has hitherto seen the government bank-rolled by property-linked tax returns.\n\nAs financial secretary Mr Leung has much scope to set policy and dictate the overall economic direction taken by the SAR. As the first non-civil service appointee he was expected to bring fresh air and new thinking to stuffy government corridors. He has thus far avoided bold initiatives, but this will be the year that tests Mr Leung's mettle under trying circumstances.\n\nSuccess will see Mr Leung stamp his authority. A muddled message could fatally dilute his political authority in moving Hong Kong towards serious change. There is a lot riding for the man who, come March, must finally climb off the fence and take the limelight.\n\nCHINA\n\nThe Year of the Horse will witness momentous changes in China. Politically, the ruling Chinese Communist Party will brace for a leadership change that promises to elevate a new crop of officials to take over the country of 1.3 billion people.\n\nEconomically, this will be the first year for China as the 143rd member of the World Trade Organisation, ushering in a new era of reform expected to bring sweeping changes to vault the country into the ranks of economic superpowers.\n\nIn another display of its national strength, the mainland's soccer team will, for the first time, play in the World Cup Finals in Japan and South Korea later in the year.\n\nThe following three people, including a Yugoslavian, are most likely to wield great influence over those changes.\n\nThe first is Zeng Qinghong who is the most trusted aide of the President and Party Secretary General Jiang Zemin.\n\nMr Zeng, who currently holds the title as the head of the Communist Party's Organisation Department, is widely expected to be inducted into the all-powerful standing committee of the politburo, the party's highest decision-making body.\n\nThe party is scheduled to hold its 16th party congress in October when the leadership changes will be decided. Mr Zeng is likely to share power with Hu Jintao, the current vice-president and a standing committee member of the politburo. Mr Hu is tipped to succeed Mr Jiang as the president of the country when the latter retires in 2003.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao is another person to watch. Mr Wen is widely expected to replace Zhu Rongji as the country's next premier when Mr Zhu retires in 2003. Mr Wen is also rumoured to become a member of the standing committee of the Politburo at the 16th congress. He is most likely to continue Mr Zhu's reform drive.\n\nHowever, the man who is most likely to grab full attention of millions of Chinese is the head coach of the mainland's soccer team, Bora Milutinovic, affectionately known as 'Milu' or 'Uncle Mi'. Milutinovic has already become a hero on the mainland after leading the Chinese team to advance into the World Cup Finals for the first time ever. Millions of football fans in the country will hang on to every word from their beloved Uncle Mi, regarding everything about the team. And Uncle Mi could become an even bigger hero, as the draw has given China a reasonable chance of qualifying for the second stage of the tournament.\n\nPROPERTY\n\nIf you want to announce your arrival on the Hong Kong property scene, what better way than to buy the most expensive house in the world? The HK$230 million paid for Genesis is reputedly the world's most expensive private residence, but it brings mainland tycoon Hui Wing-mau plenty of cachet.\n\nNot much is known about Mr Hui, except that he is one of China's richest real estate magnates. Mr Hui was listed as China's fifth-richest man with estimated wealth of US$700 million (HK$5.5 billion) by Forbes magazine last October.\n\nHe began by exporting textiles and then moved into real estate development in the late 1980s, developing important property sites in Fujian, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n\nIn October, he acquired a listed presence in the SAR by taking over small technology company Dong Jian Tech.com, which has been renamed Shimao China Holdings.\n\nIn China, Shimao Group's biggest project is the US$850 million Shimao Riviera Gardens Development in Shanghai.\n\nIn the media industry, all eyes will be on James Murdoch, chairman of Star TV, now that the company finally appears to have prised open the mainland market.\n\nYears of courtship of China by Mr Murdoch's father Rupert appeared to pay off last year when Star was given the right to broadcast a 24-hour Putonghua channel in Guangdong, the first time Beijing has approved a foreign channel sight unseen. While the Murdochs got into Beijing's good books, another media tycoon - Jimmy Lai Chee-ying - has made a career out of doing the opposite.\n\nThis year will test Mr Lai's ambitions to expand in Taiwan. He succeeded in injecting his profitable Next magazine and Apple Daily newspaper into his Hong Kong-listed Next Media last year. He has launched a Taiwan version of Next and plans to introduce Apple Daily. But analysts doubt whether his racy formula of sex, celebrities and hard-hitting news will be a winner on the island.\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn Hong Kong, stars and celebrities usually require more packaging than real talent to succeed. But every now and then a select few emerge with real potential. Eason Chan Yik-shun may not have the looks of Canto-pop king Aaron Kwok Fu-shing, and his voice is probably not as enduring as Jacky Cheung Hok-yau, but he is steadily moving up the Canto-pop ladder. Increasingly sought after as an actor, Chan garnered rave reviews for his performances in Lavender and Visible Secrets last year. A sell-out concert tour followed, helping to put him in the spotlight. With his rivals doing less visible work, he is likely to be the one to get all the action this year.\n\nSome of Hong Kong's brightest stars - Andy Lau Tak-wah, Chow Yun-fat and Stephen Chiau Sing-chi - all had humble beginnings doing bit roles for TVB. To this day, television remains an important launch pad for sparkling careers. A few years ago, Louis Koo Tin-lok was a minor actor with TVB. But since acquiring a bronze tan and muscles from working out at the gym, he has become television's favourite leading man, poised to become even more popular now that many stars are pursuing more lucrative movie careers.\n\nHis starring role in the wildly popular series A Step Into The Past , a mega-epic about China's first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi, had housewives and teenagers glued to their TV sets every night. Although he signed a musical contract with the now defunct United Artists Group, record companies are reportedly queueing up to sign him on.\n\nHong Kong has never been short of divas. There was Anita Mui Yim-fong in the 1980s and Faye Wong in the '90s. But this decade belongs to singer and actress Kelly Chen Wai-lam, whose face is visible everywhere, from CD covers to movie posters and advertisements. Part of the reason she is so popular is that she has no attitude problem. With two more albums set to be released this year, we should be hearing a lot more from her.\n\nTHE ARTS\n\nIn Hong Kong, there is a common link between art and business - bottom lines. So it is no surprise that one's popularity has much to do with how much the works can be marketed to collectors. It is hard to say if an artist whose works sell like hotcakes are neccessarily better. In fact, some of Hong Kong's most promising artists are in the field of alternative art.\n\nSomeone to watch out for is Warren Leung Chi-wo. A Hong Kong-bred multimedia artist, Leung achieved international fame in the arts world when he was chosen to create an installation for the Hong Kong pavilion at the Venice Biennial, which took place last June to November. Leung's cheeky style, laced with social commentary, goes down well with the critics, and they are close enough to daily realities that the average man in the street can appreciate them. He is a regular at the ParaSite Artspace in Sheung Wan, with many on-going projects.\n\nArt-watchers should also keep an eye out for installation artist Kum Chi-keung, whose signature material - bright red bird cages - has become a regular sight in and around Hong Kong. 2001 was a busy year for Kum. His installations - birdcages of all sizes, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, arranged in patterns simply suspended in mid-air, strike a very local chord.\n\nKum has featured in several major shows, including Art Windows last September and the Hong Kong Art Biennial last month.\n\nWith a new studio at the Cattle Depot Art Village in To Kwa Wan, Kum now has a place to call his own. No doubt he has grand, bold, original plans for 2002."
