        "text": "Liberal Party heavyweights James Tien Pei-chun, Selina Chow Liang Shuk-yee and Miriam Lau Kin-yee have withdrawn from the pro-Beijing party in protest against the cancellation of their honorary chairman titles.\n\nIn a surprise move, the three party co-founders announced their formal resignation at the party's central committee meeting yesterday.\n\nThey addressed their resignations letters to chairman Peter Shiu Ka-fai - who is also a lawmaker - expressing their disappointment with the party leadership.\n\nAccording to Tien's letter in Chinese, it came out at a central committee meeting on Wednesday afternoon that the party planned to remove the position of honorary chairmen. Tien said he understood that the leadership had previously acquired authorization letters from members of its central committee, confirming that it would vote unanimously to pass the motion to abolish the honorary chairmanship.\n\nThe party said it had held numerous discussions on the matter since the beginning of the year, with some calling for a review of the arrangement.\n\nBut the four honorary chairmen - including Vincent Fang Kang - had no knowledge of the motion prior to yesterday's meeting, nor was it discussed in committee meetings, Tien said.\n\nFang has not announced whether he will resign.\n\n\"This is a complete deviation from the Liberal Party's traditions, and a violation of trust between party members,\" Tien said.\n\n\"Since the party leadership doesn't think our contributions and opinions are of any value, I have no choice but to step down, effective immediately, as honorary chairman and all posts held within the party.\"\n\nLau, who was made chairman of the party after Tien's resignation, wrote in English: \"I must say that I am disappointed at the way the title of honorary chairman [has been abolished].\n\n\"The reasons given to me for this move are untenable, to say the least.\"\n\nChow, appointed chairman in December 2012, wrote that the party's unilateral decision to remove all honorary chairmen was made without any consultation and explanation.\n\n\"As no reason was ever discussed or given for this unilateral decision, one could only assume that the executive committee - which had up to now invited each and every past chairman to take on the role of honorary chair as recognition of his or her leadership, service and contribution to the party - has now concluded such a gesture of appreciation to be redundant,\" she said.\n\nChow said any recommendations made by a member of the party should be open to discussion and consideration as long as it is for the benefit of the party.\n\n\"I find such a callous move to be inappropriate and unbecoming of our party and therefore totally unacceptable,\" she said.\n\nLiberal Party leader Tommy Cheung Yu-yan defended the move after the committee meeting.\n\nHe said: \"This was never a personal issue. We aren't targeting anyone as individuals. This is for the development of the party. You should check Facebook.\"\n\nIn a two-sentence statement on the party's Facebook page, Cheung expressed deep regret at the resignation of the three veterans, adding that Shiu had tried to persuade them to stay.\n\nTien, Chow, and Lau co-founded the Liberal Party in 1993 with founding chairman Allen Lee Peng-fei and former lawmaker Stephen Cheong Kam-chuen, both of whom have passed away.\n\ncjames.lee@singtaonewscorp.com"
