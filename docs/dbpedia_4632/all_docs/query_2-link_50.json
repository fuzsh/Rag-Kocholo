        "text": "TV actress Sanaya Irani, known for starring in Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon and Miley Jab Hum Tum, recently recalled a casting couch incident. Irani said she has been typecast because of her complexion while opening up about an event where a big Bollywood director was extremely rude to her. Recalling a different incident, Irani revealed how a director in the South told her, “We need fuller people.”\n\nIn an interview with Hauterrfly, Irani was asked whether she ever faced a casting couch experience. Recalling an incident in the South, she said, “Long ago, a person from the South wanted to meet me for a film. At that point, I didn’t want to do films. But, this person was hellbent on meeting me. So I just went, and after the meeting, he was like ‘We need a little fuller person.’ And I was, like, ‘Then I’m not the fuller person.’” She then added, “A lot of times, I feel that people meet girls in the industry to meet them, to suss it out, is she the kind who slept or hasn’t slept?”\n\nSoon Irani recalled another incident when she called a big Bollywood director after his secretary’s request. “There was a lot of misunderstanding. I was told I was auditioning for a music video, but this was a film. I told the secretary, ‘I won’t do it.’ She was, like, ‘Please, sir will get angry, just speak to him once.’”\n\n“I made a call to him after his secretary asked me to call him. When I did, he said, I’m entering into a meeting, call me after half an hour. So I called him after 45 minutes thinking I will give him some time. And when I called, he was, like, what’s the time? I just blurted out the time. And he was, like, what time did I ask you to call me? I was, like, you asked me to call at 11:30, and again he was, like, what’s the time? Now this time, I was, like, is he really throwing an attitude at me? Because I’m not buying this. So I said, ‘Is this what we are talking about, or are we moving forward? I just gave you a little bit of grace that I shouldn’t be calling exactly in half an hour,’” she added.\n\n“So he was like, ‘I’m making this big film, there are many big heroes in it and you will have to wear a bikini.’ And I was, like, ‘And my character is?’ and he was, like, ‘Are you okay wearing a bikini?’ He was getting a little rude, and I hung up on him.”\n\nFor those who don’t know, Sanaya Irani made her acting debut in 2006 with a cameo appearance in Aamir Khan and Kajol’s Fanaa."
