        "text": "They may be best friends in real life, but the media and janta just can’t stop pitting them against each other\n\nDrashti Dhami and Sanaya Irani are one of the biggest stars in tellyland today. But, only one person is entitled to hold the Numero Uno spot.\n\nIt’s a tough choice to make, as both Drashti and Sanaya are great actors, gorgeous looking and even have a perfect love story in real life. So, with these two actors competing against each other for the No.1 slot, BollywoodLifers, we declare you the best judges. Here are a few parameters to make it easy. We’ve give you a low down on their career, sex appeal and personal lives and you tell us who reigns on TV…\n\nTelly Career\n\nDrashti: The actor has been a part of three prominent shows on small screen – Dill Mill Gayye (supporting actor), Geet Hui Sabse Parayi (lead) opposite Gurmeet Choudhary, which was her claim to fame. She shot to the top spot with Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon and her successful stint still continues even after the 20-year leap. Dhami has reinvented her career and her chemistry with her new co-star Gunjan Utreja. Before her TV career, Drashti has been part of several music albums and advertisements. The babe participated in the celebrity reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 6 and even went on to win the coveted trophy with her choreographer Salman Yusuf Khan. Drashti was apparently even approached by Rohit Shetty to play the lead in his Singham 2, but the actor rejected the offer to stay back in telly land and continue her magic spell on her ardent fans.\n\nSanaya: Ms Irani started her career with a blink and miss appearance in Aamir Khan-Kajol starrer Fanaa. The actor has been a part of six shows till date. She started off as one of the leads in Left Right Left where she shared screen presence with five other lead actors. She experimented with Radhaa Ki Betiyaan Kuch Kar Dikhayengi, by playing a negative role. It was Miley Jab Hum Tum, that got Sanaya under the spot light, she played the sweet and innocent girl next door. Post which, she was seen in Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon opposite Barun Sobti. The show catapulted her popularity and her fans base grew larger than most TV heroes. Fans and followers of IPKKND were left heartbroken when Sobti walked out of the show to pursue his Bollywood career, leading to an untimely end of the show. Sanaya bounced back with Chhanchhan, she played a very different character from her earlier ones, but failed to impress. The show earned a lot of flak and was soon taken off air. This gorgeous babe is now seen as the demure Paro in Rangrasiya and so far the viewers have had no reason to complain.\n\nOur verdict: Well we believe both are brilliant actors and have done justice to each of the characters they’ve ever portrayed so far. While Sanaya has more number of shows and flops than Drashti (who has done only three shows), wethinks Drashti definitely has had a better career graph than Sanaya. However, one can’t ignore the fact that Sanaya has experimented to some extent with her roles. BollywoodLifers, who is a better actor – Sanaya Irani or Drashti Dhami? Vote now!\n\nStyle\n\nDrashti: Her curly long hair and dimples make Drashti look simply gorgeous. She loves comfort clothes and is often seen in a casual avatar. Drashti’s sense of style is not exactly great, in fact some of her fashion statements can easily be ignored. However, drape Madhubala in a saree and she would look perfect. Nobody can carry off sarees the way Drashti does, at least not in telly land. The actor has not gone glamourous or sexy in her onscreen avatars yet, instead when she appeared wearing some revealing outfits on the dance reality show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 6, she faced a lot of criticism from her fans.\n\nSanaya: This Parsi babe is beautiful beyond belief; she can light up a room with her smile and can pull off any look with panache. She can slip into a sexy mini or a revealing LBD (little black dress) with as much ease as a saree or an Indian attire. In fact, she is one of the few TV actors to have had a variety in her onscreen appearances. She showcased her glamourous side in Chhanchhan and Miley Jab Hum Tum , but none did enough justice to her looks.\n\nOur verdict: Wethinks Sanaya has fared better on our style-o-meter as compared Drashti, both on and offscreen. BollywoodLifers, who is more stylish – Sanaya Irani or Drashti Dhami? Vote!\n\nLove Life\n\nDrashti: Drashti has been dating NRI bussinessman Neeraj Khemka for as long as we can remember. Rumours suggest that Gurmeet Choudhary and Drashti were dating each other briefly during the shoot of Geet Hui Sabse Parayi. This apparently caused a rift between Drashti and her real life boyfriend. However all’s well between the couple now, who might just announce a wedding date sometime soon, at least that’s what the reports floating in the media suggest.\n\nSanaya: The actor fell head over heels in love with her Miley Jab Hum Tum co-star Mohit Sehgal and the love affair has been strong and steady ever since .Both Mohit and Sanaya seem settled in their personal lives. When quizzed about their wedding plans, they never say no, however fail to give a confirmation.\n\nOur verdict: Wethinks Sanaya and Drashti’s love lives are at its best time and it’s better leave these things private. However you tell us – Who makes the perfect couple – Sanaya-Mohit or Drashti-Neeraj?\n\nWhile many may disagree, but we think Drashti Dhami is currently ruling the roost. Nonetheless, BollywoodLifers, it’s time for you to pick television’s No 1 heroine – Who will it be – Drashti or Sanaya?\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Rishab Kundra is back albeit with a new name and character, confirms the producer\n\nAbhinav Shukla’s Nautanki Films has rehired Vivian D’Sena in Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon owing to public pressure and dipping numbers, but the producer says that they got him back ‘coz the story demanded.\n\nThe promo has been shot; we wonder what Vivian will look and behave like? “Yes we shot the promo yesterday, but I cannot reveal anything about the character. If I tell you anything, where’s the surprise element then? You will get a glimpse of him when the promo goes live tomorrow,” said Abhinav.\n\nGuess it was always decided to get the actor back as the main lead and make Gunjan Utreja the antagonist, right? “We did not decide this in the start. However, the story demanded an exciting twist and that’s how we creatively planned to get DSena back in the show.”\n\nThe producer says that Vivian’s proximity to the show and the production house convinced him to comeback. And the rumours of his absurd demands are all untrue. “Vivianis a good friend and has been closely associated with Madhubala since the beginning. He was very excited to hear the change in his character and the new role we offered him. The excitement and attachment to the daily soap, production house and channel is what compelled him to come back. I know there are rumours suggesting that DSena made astronomical demands, but that’s not true. Everything has been done fairly. Everyone gets what they deserve. All this allegations are baseless and false. He has never made any demands to me and nor has he asked anyone else. There will be some remuneration changes, but that is extremely confidential.”\n\nGuess with the hero coming back, Gunjan will become the third wheel in Drashti Dhami and Vivian’s love story. “The story will not revolve around these three pillars – Madhubala, Abhay Kapoor and the new Vivian. We will soon disclose the name of DSena’s character. Utreja was very welcoming and excited about the change in his character. Love triangle or not for that you have to wait. I really cannot reveal anything about the storyline.”\n\nApparently, Vivian’s character is still being shaped and once the plot is in place, the actor will start shooting for Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon.\n\nBollywoodLife too welcomes Vivian and hopes that Gunjan continues his work the way he did!\n\nWinning Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa was a turning point in Drashti Dhami’s career – but was it really? Will this Madhubala girl step into a successful Bollywood career? Our in-house tarot reader, Shruti Chopra talks about Drashti’s future..\n\nBollywoodLife (BL): Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon has been an important exposure in Drashti Dhami’s career, but will this remain a good show for her? Will she quit?\n\nShruti Chopra (SC): The character Madhubala will receive a lot of growth and maturity, but over a course of the next 30 days, Drashti will begin to lose interest in the show. Somewhere she feels it is stagnating the sort of potential she can have if she is not a part of it. The Five of Wands does warn her of getting into trouble through arguments and minor avoidable agitations. In fact a little bit of calm will actually help her resolve her concerns and hence it’s important that she doesn’t take any hasty decisions.\n\nBL: Could it be possible that she quits for a Bollywood opportunity?\n\nSC: A Bollywood offer will not be the reason to quit, but it will be the desire to pursue films more openly that will want her to do so. November 2014 brings with the right type of offers, but until then, small issues will cause unnecessary obstacles. She will eventually do well in Indian cinema – not just as an actor but as a brand identity too. The Nine of Pentacles shows her financially comfortable and in a commanding position. Her understanding of how to propel her career and make things work for her will grow in a steady fashion.\n\nBL: But in all of this will she get time for love or possibly marriage?\n\nSC: Not really. She will demand more from life on all fronts and love/marriage will be no exception. It will be important for her to feel at ease with a person before she commits – this will take some time. Possibly a good two years.\n\nBL: How are things looking for her this year?\n\nSC: Generally 2014 is year of risk taking but also understanding what she wants from her career and life. Her family’s support will see her through a short rough patch which may include an personal disappointment. Sleep may not come easily to her, and hence this maybe an indicator of over thinking and stress. A little further patience will be a major help.\n\nThe dishy actor claims that he is unaffected by the return of Vivian DSena ‘coz the change in the script has not changed or eliminated the importance of his character\n\nGunjan Uterja talks about his character in Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon – Abhay Kapoor, becoming a superstar, working with Drashti Dhami, Vivian DSena’s return, and his plans for the future.\n\nDo you think you’ve achieved the status of being a superstar with this show ?\n\nIt’s a dream for every actor to be a superstar. However, I would not call myself a superstar. That tag is for people like Amitabh Bachchan, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. They have an excellent body of work since ages and have proved themselves repeatedly. They are superstars; I have just begun my journey.\n\nHow similar or different is Gunjan from Abhay Kapoor?\n\nSame but different! The similarity is that like Abhay I believe two things are very important in my life – my family and my work. Like Abhay, I am dedicated to my craft. Thirdly, Abhay and I are humble. In spite of everything I have achieved, I have never changed as a person. I was brought up that way. The only dissimilarity is that Abhay has a big emotional baggage on him. I am someone who does not carry that kind a load on me.\n\nAre you saying that tomorrow, if you become a superstar you will not change as a person?\n\nI believe you will be at a better position to judge, ‘coz you have seen the other side of people before and after stardom. It is natural for people to change, but that doesn’t mean I will become arrogant. I would never be inhuman nor will I disrespect anyone. That’s a promise!\n\nHow did you prepare for this role?\n\nJust before I got the offer, I was rather healthy. I lost ten kilos and toned up my body just when I got the role. I am glad, I worked out religiously and got myself into shape. I think it is important to look and feel fit when you are playing such glamorous roles.\n\nWhat was your first reaction when you met Drashti Dhami?\n\nI met her for the first time on the sets of Madhubala during the screen test. She is very beautiful and sweet. She would come, learn her dialogues and deliver it to perfection. I saw her and realised that’s where they are getting the TRPs from. I told this to her and the creative head sitting next to her. She is fast and gets into the skin of the character effortlessly.\n\nHow has the response been to your character Abhay Kapoor and Gunjan?\n\nThe response has been great. I get messages, tweets and Facebook comments constantly. Frankly, I do not handle any of it. Until a few days back, I didn’t even know how to handle twitter. My first day, I almost retweeted everything I saw. I really do not have time for all it. My Facebook page is rather personal and I have my close friends on it. I still get about 300 requests every day, just goes to show that people love my work.\n\nDo you regret taking up Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon?\n\nNot at all. It is an interesting concept unlike the other things that were offered to me at that time.\n\nWhen did you get to know that Vivian DSena is coming back?\n\nI was informed about it a day before he shot the promo.\n\nFrom playing the hero, now you are be playing the villain – How do you feel about that?\n\nI am doing Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon for the character of Abhay Kapoor and the shades he has. Since the beginning, I was told that Abhay would be a very sweet boy with some great qualities. As an actor, I always knew that Abhay could not remain the same. He will fall in love and then something will happen that will change and alter his character. It was obvious that I will change when I learn that Madhubala was Rishab Kundra’s daughter. And that’s exactly what has happened. The only thing no one really knew about was Vivian’s return. Nothing has changed even if Vivian has come back.\n\nHow do you find Vivian DSena as a person and co-star?\n\nI met him thrice before we began working together. I was just ten days into shoot, Vivian had come on the sets and we met then. We chatted for about 25 minutes about the show, our characters etc. It was great talking to him and we share a good rapport…\n\nWhile the story will now be a triangle love story, Vivian will still get Madhubala in the end, right?\n\nIt does not matter who gets the girl. The story is the hero here. Abhay Kapoor, RK and Madhu are nobody if there is no story. The time for hero and anti-heroes are over. Not everyone can be the same all throughout his life. Like in real life, situations change a character; it is similar in daily soaps as well. Similarly, Abhay has several sides to his nature as well.\n\nDo you think the TRPs were affected when Vivian left the show and did it change much when you came on board?\n\nThey say statistics are the best means to tell the story. I joined on February 13, check the TRPs before and after that, I am sure you will see the numbers. In the history of television, no show has climbed the charts overnight. Everything takes its own time. For two years, people were used to seeing Vivian. Overnight the makers changed the show into a romantic comedy. Of course, the numbers dipped, but it picked up again. We are doing better than Rangrasiya and Beinteha. The only shows which are above Madhubala, is Balika Vadhu and Sasural Simar Ka, which is again ‘coz of the loyal fan following since ages.\n\nHow has your family and friends reacted to Vivian DSena’s return?\n\nIt does not matter to anyone. When I got Madhubala they did not react, they were happy for me. They know I am talented and I will get bigger and better opportunities. I think the whole thing about Vivian coming back has been blown out of proportion. What is the big deal if he came back? He has been a part of this show for the last two and half years. He hasn’t taken anything away from me. See AK and RK may be rivals but Gunjan and Vivian are not. We are here to do a job that is about it. I think he quit because he was not happy playing a father. There is no hero and anti-hero angle here.\n\nIf given an opportunity would you take up a role on any other channel if they offered you the protagonist?\n\nWhy would I do that? I am part of such an interesting project. I am not an opportunist."
