        "text": "Interview with female lead\n\nSanaya Irani might play coy roles on TV, but she is known to be arrogant, rude and difficult. Riding on the success of her hit show Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon, Sanaya talks about her co-star Barun Sobti quitting the show and how her success has not affected her relationship with boyfriend Mohit Sehgal.\n\nHindustan Times: What do you think of your image as a difficult person?\n\nSanaya Irani: I have heard that, but I am not a difficult person. People who know me would laugh if they read that I was arrogant. I don't need to prove that to anyone. I am working long hours and I am in every shot (in the serial). I am a simple person who leads a simple life. When people try to make me more than I am, that puts me in a shell which people think is rude.\n\nHindustan Times: But that's part of what comes with being a star.\n\nSanaya Irani: Yes I know, but that doesn't mean I have to be cool with it. I love acting and I didn't become an actor for fame or money. I want people to not bother me. Yet I get the point of fans, who want autographs and photographs regardless of the fact that I am eating or relaxing with friends. I try to make them happy but I also hope that they understand me.\n\nHindustan Times: What do you think of your character Khushi?\n\nSanaya Irani: As an actor, I needed growth and I knew this role would be different from Gunjan in Miley Jab Hum Tum. I found it hard to play the simple Gunjan as I am a complete psycho in real life. Later, I wondered if I would be able to break out of it. When I got the role of Khushi, I was worried whether I could do it well. As my Hindi is weak and Khushi is a fast talker with chaste Hindi, the role helped me explore everything as an actor.\n\nHindustan Times: What is your reaction to the news that Barun is quitting the show?\n\nSanaya Irani: I don't know about it. Obviously, it will be a big loss to the show, but I believe life goes on. If Barun has taken this decision, it will be for his good. I think no one should get negative about it, right from the audiences to the team.\n\nHindustan Times: There are rumours that the show might end after he leaves.\n\nSanaya Irani: I have been hearing the same rumours but I think it is speculation."
