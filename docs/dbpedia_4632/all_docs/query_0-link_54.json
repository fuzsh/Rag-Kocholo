        "text": "Why Blue Carpet?\n\nAttendees of the 11th Indian Telly Awards would have been surprised to note a blue carpet rather than a red one when they entered the venue of India’s leading television performance recognition ceremony. Not many knew what it was about.\n\nThe decision behind having a blue carpet came about to bring to people’s minds the increasing degradation and pollution of India’s rivers and the government’s apathy towards this rising menace.\n\nFounder of The Indian Telly Awards, Anil Wanvari tweeted: “Why was the red carpet at the 11th Indian Telly Awards blue? Because it was moaning the polluted state of India’s holiest river – Ganga.”\n\nThe initiative clearly indicated how even trademark and leading events can be used to highlight certain social issues and causes.\n\nLets find out who turned out to be the Winners:\n\nBest Child Artist (Female)– Anchal Munjal (Parvarrish – Kuchh Khattee Kuchh Meethi, DJ’s A Creative Unit, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nBest Child Artist (Male)– Raj Mange ( Jai Jai Jai Bajrang Bali, Sagar Arts, Sahara One)\n\nBest Anchor– Amitabh Bachchan (Kaun Banega Crorepari season 5, Big Synergy Media Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nBest Actress in a Comic Role– Kavita Kaushik (FIR, Edit II, SAB TV)\n\nBest Actor in a Comic Role– Dilip Joshi (Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltha Chashma, Neela Telefilms, SAB TV)\n\nBest Actress in a Supporting Role– Rupal Patel (Saath Nibhana Saathiya, Rashmi Sharma Telefilms, Star Plus)\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role– Anoop Soni (Balika Vadhu, Sphere Origins, Colors)\n\nTelevision Personality – Male– Ronit Bose Roy (Adaalat, Contiloe Entertainment Pvt Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nTelevision Personality – Female-Ankita Lokhande (Pavitra Rishta, Balaji Telefilms Ltd, Zee TV)\n\nActress in a Negative Role– Kanika Maheshwari (Diya Aur Bati Hum, Shashi Sumeet Mittal Productions Pvt Ltd, Star Plus)\n\nActor in a Negative Role– Karanvir Bohra (Dil Se Di Dua… Saubhagyavati Bhava, UTV Software Communications Ltd, Life OK)\n\nFresh New Face (Female)– Aakanksha Singh (Na Bole Tum Na Maine Kuch Kaha, Sunshine Productions, Colors)\n\nFresh New Face (Male)– Kushal Tandon (Ek Hazaaron Mein Meri Behna Hai, Cinevistaas Limited, Star Plus)\n\nActress in a Lead Role– Giaa Maanek (Saath Nibhana Saathiya, Rashmi Sharma Telefilms, Star Plus\n\nActor in a Lead Role– Ram Kapoor and Samir Soni (Bade Acche Lagte Hai/Parichay, Balaji Telefilms Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television/ Colors)\n\nEnsemble– Parvarrish Kuchh Khatti Kuchh Meeth (DJ’s A Creative Unit, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nProgramme with a Social Message– Afsar Bitiya (Village Boy Production, ZEE TV)\n\nDaily Serial– Diya Aur Baati Hum (Shashi Sumeet Mittal Productions Pvt Ltd, Star Plus)\n\nWeekly Serial– Adaalat (Contiloe Entertainment Pvt Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nContinuing TV Programme– Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai, (Director’s Kut Production, Star Plus)\n\nDrama Series– Balika Vadhu—Kachchi Umar Ke Pakke Rishte (Sphere Origins Multivision Pvt Ltd, Colors)\n\nThriller Programme– C.I.D and Crime Patrol (Fireworks Productions/ Optimystix Entertainment India Pvt Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nKid’s Programme -Bournvita Quiz Contest (Derek O’Brien & Associates Pvt Ltd, Colors)\n\nSitcom/Comedy Programme– Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah (Neela Telefilms Pvt Ltd, SAB TV)\n\nReality Show– Bigg Boss (Endemol India Pvt Ltd, Colors)\n\nGame Show – Kaun Banega Crorepati – Season 5 (Big Synergy Media Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nDance Talent Show – Dance India Dance – Season 3 (24 Frames, ZEE TV)\n\nSinging Talent Show – X – Factor India 2011 (Fremantle India Television Productions Pvt Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nComedy Talent Show– Jubilee Comedy Circus (Optimystix Entertainment India Pvt Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television)\n\nMythological Series – Veer Shivaji (Contiloe Entertainment Pvt Ltd, Colors)\n\nJudge panel on a TV Show– Dharmendra, Kiron Kher, Sonali Bendre (India’s Got Talent Season – 3, Fremantle India Television Productions Pvt Ltd, Colors)\n\nYouth Show – Fiction – Dil Dostii Dance (Cinevistaas Limited, Channel V)\n\nYouth Show– Non Fiction– MTV Hero Honda Roadies 8 Short Cut To Hell (Viacom 18 Media Pvt Ltd, MTV)\n\nTelevised Awards Show – STAR Parivaar Awards 2012– (Sol Production Pvt Ltd, Star Plus)\n\nTelevised Entertainment Show– Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Lil Champ Finale (Big Productions, Zee TV)\n\nOn Screen Couple– Barun Sobti & Sanaya Irani ( Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon, Panglosean Entertainment Pvt Ltd, Star Plus)\n\nProduction House of the Year– Optimystix Entertainment India Pvt Ltd\n\nGary Bhinder Most Promising Young Director– Shoojit Sircar\n\nSpecial Award (breaking into films)– Ekta Kapoor\n\nWell, seems like there was a lot of FUN and hoo-haa at the grand event!

Every year, everyone exclusively waits for the Indian Telly Awards. Fans vote for their favorite stars and make them win. Jury spends a lot of time watching almost all shows, to just give out the award to the most deserved candidate. Well, at the end, it’s all about the Telly game. Or how about call it a “Tally” game!\n\nCheers to all the winners! And do catch the event on Colors TV channel soon.\n\n(Sources: Tellychakkar.com and @Colors TV on twitter)\n\nFIR…These 3 letters are known as “First Information Report” which the Indian police prepares for each case to be investigated. But the Indian Television audience might disagree with this. For them FIR is a super hit serial that has been aired on SAB TV since 2006. Yes it’s been on the television screen since 2006. And guess what? This sitcom was also nominated for the “Best Sitcom/Comedy Programme” category at the Indian Telly Awards in 2009.\n\nLet’s get back to the main characters of the show that make it successful. Chandramukhi Chautala role played by Kavita Kaushik, the moment you take this name there is a sense of a no-nonsense cop. Well she is actually a no-nonsense cop but manages to play this fun-loving, romantic Haryanvi cop. She is young, educated, informed and well-built and not to forget beautiful. She plays the role of a police sub-inspector in the Iman Chowki and has a central role in solving the cases. She is known for her manly nature and bossy attitude towards her colleagues. Did you know Kavita Kaushik’s father was a police officer in real life? In the serial she is from Haryana who speaks with a Haryanvi accent.\n\nThe best part is that she never fails to solve a case. And does not miss a chance to boss around with her 2 juniors and not to forget her boss, the police inspector. This character is played by Aamir Ali who is known as Inspector Bajrang Pandey in the show. This character was earlier played by Ali Asgar for last 2 years. This character has a unique role as he is one who is interested in girls, but has to stay away from them as his guru told him that he would die if he got married. The police inspector’s role is later played by other actors as the inspectors keep on getting transferred to other police stations.\n\nWho can miss the 2 craziest characters in the serial ie Gopinath Gandotra played by Gopi Bhalla. He plays the role of an aged constable and rarely plays an important role in solving the cases. He is often scolded by Chandramukhi upon his silly comments and mistakes while he tries to speak in very bad English.\n\nSome of his most used phrases are-\n\n“Ya this one”, “carry on” 🙂 Following are some of his crazy dialogues: “What is the problem is the, Delhi me airport palam is the”, “What is the matter is the, can I send you letter is the”, “Hame karni chahiye iski sahayata is the, warna phail jayega raita is the”, “What is the name is the, Kanpur me traffic jam is the” and many more.\n\nThe second constable is Mulayam Singh Gulgule, played by Kiku Sharda. He is the one who always ends up being slapped by Chandramukhi Chautala. As and when the serial progresses there are some of the most rowdy characters that enter the show and this in turn ensures that the audience have a laugh riot.\n\nSo what makes FIR so Special? Is it Chandramukhi Chautala or Inspector Bajrang Pandey or the 2 constables or the rowdiest characters? As always looking forward to your views on the same.\n\nHappy Viewing!!!\n\n18.618679 73.803749"
