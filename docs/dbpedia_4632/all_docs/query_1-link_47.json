        "text": "Being an ardent fan of my heart-throb Barun Sobti, it really pains my heart to write this blog post with such a title to it! But Gul Khan and the other makers of ‘Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon-Season 3” have left me with no other option but to write something about the disappointment I faced after watching the show for the past three weeks. I must say, at this juncture, that I am also thankful to the producers for one reason- they have irritated me so much by ruining Barun’s comeback on television that I had to express my displeasure by adding a post to my blog after three long months, in spite of being caught up in multiple activities.\n\nNow, coming back to “Iss Pyar Ko…“, this serial is actually the third season of one of the most celebrated shows on Star Plus as well as on Indian television in the last ten years, “Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon“, starring Barun Sobti, in the role of an arrogant businessman, Arnav Singh Raizada, and Sanaya Irani, in the role of a chirpy girl from Lucknow, Khushi Kumari Gupta. Though it was aired during 2011-2012, the first season still features in the list of “Most Popular Shows” on Hotstar. The craze and enthusiasm surrounding Arnav-Khushi pairing never seems to die down even after so many years of the serial going off air. I was and still am a great fan of the crackling onscreen chemistry between Barun Sobti and Sanaya Irani as ‘Arnav’ and ‘Khushi’.But this was not the only reason for which the season 1 of “Iss Pyar Ko..” franchise has left an indelible mark on the hearts of many Hindi serial viewers. A relatable story line, some wonderfully etched-out characters and a fantastic set of actors portraying those characters- all these factors, coupled with the unbeatable chemistry between the lead couple, led to its successful run over a period of one and half years.\n\nSome of my favourite Arnav-Khushi moments from “Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon-Season 1“. Have a glimpse of their passionate romance:\n\nThe season 3 of “Iss Pyar Ko..” was launched with great pomp and show, highlighting the comeback of the superstar of Indian Television, Barun Sobti, after 5 long years! But only after a few days of the first look launch, the makers received serious backlash when it was announced that Shivani Tomar, and not Sanaya Irani, has been cast opposite Barun Sobti as the female lead. Barun-Sanaya fans lost their cool and vehemently expressed their discontent on various web platforms and social networking sites, so that the makers are forced to rope in Sanaya Irani into the show. But Gul Khan preferred to stick to her decision of casting Shivani as “Chandni”, in spite of knowing Shivani’s past track record of being replaced from quite a few television shows due to her poor performance and unimpressive TRPs. Though I was unhappy with the fact that the makers of the show did not bother to recreate the magic of Barun and Sanaya in the new couple ‘Advay Singh Raizada’ and ‘Chandni Yash Narayan Vashishth’, I was ready to give Shivani a chance to prove herself as the best ‘Chandni’ one could ever think of, without just rejecting her completely in the first place.\n\nMy disappointment with the show started creeping into my heart and mind just after watching the first few episodes. Shivani Tomar as “Chandni” is just a minor factor in this debacle – the desperate attempt on the part of the creators of the show to make it ‘over-the-top‘ and ‘something which has never been seen on Indian television before‘ has completely ruined the simplicity and poise, associated with the brand name “Iss Pyar Ko…”.\n\nThe character of Advay Singh Raizada, played by Barun Sobti, has been etched out in such a way as if he is a mysterious super-hero, who can come in and go out of a scene even more swifty and unexpectedly than Harry Potter on his magic broomstick! The element of mystery is understandable, but what I could not understand was why the makers are hell bent on portraying him as someone who is a super-human! In the first episode itself, Advay Singh Raizada makes a spectacular entry into the life of the Vashisth family by saving the huge Shiva Idol from falling down, just before the highly-anticipated “Maha-Aarti”- the entire scene has been a ditto copy of the statue inauguration scene of Bhallaldeva from the film “Bahubali- The Beginning” , where Bahubali comes to the rescue and saves the 50ft idol from collapsing on the ground! This is where the script writers have misconstrued the audience’s likes and dislikes. The charisma of Arnav Singh Raizada, the protagonist of “Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon- Season 1″ remained in the fact that the viewers could relate to the onscreen portrayal of his character- all his raw emotions of love, hate, helplessness, anguish and anger were very human and completely in sync with the narrative. But too much artistry seems to have spoiled the broth in Season 3 – every single entry and exit of Advay Singh Raizada in the serial has been forcibly made ‘grand’ , to bank upon the popularity of Barun Sobti. The makers need to understand that we love Barun the way he is and you do not need to add those unnecessary special effects and loud Indo-Western background music, to make him look more ‘heroic’.\n\nMakers have experimented a lot with Barun Sobti’s look in the first three weeks of the launch- from a thick bearded look to a light stubbled one, quite similar to his appearance as Arnav Singh Raizada in the the first season. Have a look at Barun AKA Advay’s varying yet charming looks, this season:\n\nThe excessively extravagant set of the Vashisth House, in which the serial’s plot is unfolding in every episode, is a complete contrast to the simply beautiful Raizada mansion in Season 1, “Shantivan” ,with a home decor that was soothing to the eyes and yet very classy. We are told that the Vashisth family is suffering from a great financial crisis, and they are looking forward to get the secret ‘khazana’ that is supposedly lying behind the closed doors of the ‘Mandir’ for the last 16 years! In such a scenario, why the entire house is literally covered in streams of fancy lights, that are generally used to decorate one’s house only during Diwali or any other celebration? I wonder who is paying the bill for such unrequired wastage of electricity throughout the year!\n\nAll the women in the house- be it Chandni and her sisters, or her mother Indrani Vashisth, along with her two dumb confidants- are dressed up in such a comical fashion, as if they have no other objective in their lives than to forcibly establish a new ‘fashion trend’. The never-ending winged eyeliner of Chandni and her sisters,the glittering eye-shadow of multiple colours, clubbed with layers of heavy make up and mindlessly gross accessories, make them look nothing better than dolls of a puppet show!\n\nMy God! How can I miss this? The Special Effects! I really want to tell the producers that we know you have loads of money and you do not know where to waste it!But please do not challenge our patience by incorporating meaningless special effects at all the wrong places, without making any good use of your logical faculties. Even S.S. Rajamouli sir’s creativity would have fallen short if he had seen the ‘flying‘ tea, the ‘magnetic dupatta‘ or the remote-controlled pigeons, conceptualised by the overtly fertile and imaginative minds of “Iss Pyar Ko..3” writers!\n\nThe casting of Shivani Tomar as “Chandni” puts the final nail into the coffin. On the day of the launch of the serial, producer Gul Khan had said in a press conference that no one but Shivani was perfect for the role of Chandni and she was totally confident about the choice she has made! She also said that she did not consider Sanaya Irani ‘fit’ for this role, and hence she was kept away from being cast as the female protagonist in the third season of that very serial, in which Sanaya as ‘Khushi Kumari Gupta’ was one of the most important reasons behind its unprecented success, a few years back. Though Sanaya Irani has repeatedly proved her mettle as a versatile actress in so many of her shows- be it “Miley Jab Hum Tum“, “Rangrasiya” or “Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon” – the casting directors and the producers seem to have been on opium while committing such an unpardonable mistake in the casting of the lead pair! Even if not Sanaya, they could have selected someone who could have atleast reciprocated Barun’s emotions on screen and be at par with him in her acting skills! Before writing this, I waited for three weeks to see whether Shivani improves as an actor. But every single time Barun looks into her eyes with so much passion and love, she make me furious with her expressionless eyes and weird body language. She shivers and cringes away from Barun in such a way as if he is suffering from any contagious disease. I really empathise with Barun Sobti for being such a terrific actor and trying his level best to create a chemistry with a co-star, who is contributing nothing in return to sizzle up their pairing!\n\nIt is high time that the makers of the show and the concerned officials of the Channel Star Plus have a serious discussion over the dipping TRPs, that should shake them up from their complacent attitude. It is also important for Barun Sobti, as a senior and successful actor, to express his concern regarding this issue to the show officials, not only for the sake of his own hard-earned popularity, but for the sake of his millions of fans all across the world, who love him for all the amazing characters that he has played onscreen- right from ‘Swayam in “Shraddha” to ‘Haider‘ in the recent fantastic web series “Tanhaiyaan” on Hotstar! As fans of the “Iss Pyar Ko…” franchise and Barun Sobti, we are thankful to Gul Khan for gifting us such a beautiful show that still gives us happiness when we see some of the passionately romantic scenes between Arnav and Khushi. But this time, she has committed a blunder by trying to make the third season too much “artistic” and “poetic”, as if the entire set and characters have come out from a fantasy fiction.\n\nOn behalf of all the fans who are sentimentally attached to this brand name for the last 6-7 years, I would like to make a request to all the concerned officials of the show that we do not want “Iss Pyar Ko…3” to turn into a debacle! We want it to become as huge a hit as the first season- please do not try to embellish the narrative and the characters with too much superficiality! As you have named the serial “Iss Pyar Ko Kya Naam Doon”, then you have to keep up to the expectations associated with this name. You can change the context and the storyline, but you cannot take way the essence of simplicity from the plot and the portrayal of the characters. It is a humble request! Give a thought in this regard, before it becomes too late…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
