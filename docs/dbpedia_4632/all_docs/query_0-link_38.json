        "text": "Category: Uncategorized\n\nKhichdi- Parekh Parivar is coming back and we can’t stop thanking Bhagwaaan\n\nAlmost after a decade, popular comedy TV Show, Khichdi, is back to make us ROFL with its third season. The ‘Parekh parivaar’ has to be one of the craziest bunch of characters ever to be seen on Indian television. We binged on ‘Khichdi’ before we watched ‘F.R.I.E.N.D.S’. No matter how much we love Chandler, when it comes to colloquial humour, Praful tops the list!\n\nThere’s khichdi , the easy-to-digest ,bland dish for infants, old peeps and the ill. And then there’s Khichdi, the comic television show that is something of a chatpata middle class theory put to life.\n\nHere is why TV Ji is waiting for the new season Khichdi and can thank Bhagwaaaan-\n\nPraful…. What is?\n\nThe classic Hansa-Praful jokes from the evergreen show still tickle our funny bone no matter what.\n\nKisiko pata nahi chalega\n\nHimanshu played by JD Majethia was goofy and also an amazing cook. The explanation for his stupid behaviour was always “Aye bapu kisi ko pata nahi chalega”.\n\nPraful tu toh gadha hai gadha\n\nBaabuji and Praful’s arguments were rib-tickling to say the least.\n\nKhabar me toh aaj kaamwali bai nahi aayi\n\nJayshree Bhaabhi was perhaps Indian Television’s only bhaabhi who wasn’t plotting against her devrani. She was the ultimate gossip queen. She was a breath of fresh air for viewers in that sense.\n\nBade log Bade log\n\nWhile other serials destined child artists as the future Mihirs and Tulsis, the Khichdi kids Jacky and Chakki always remained kids. They were the smartest members of the family, but as naughty as kids could be.\n\nThe Parminder family\n\nAnd who can forget the Parminders! Unlike other serials, where it is hard to remember the names of characters, the makers made it easy for us by naming the whole family Parminder!\n\nMai toh thak gayi bhaishaap!\n\nTV Ji can’t wait any longer for the Khichdi to back on air. The best thing about this latest season of Khichdi is that the show is retaining all major actors from the previous season. Supriya Pathak, Anang Desai, Rajeev Mehta, Vandana Pathak and JD Majethia, all major actors have been renewed for this new season. The show will also have guest appearances of Ratna Pathak Shah, Renuka Shahane and Deepshikha Nagpal.\n\nKhichdi is coming back on Star Plus from 14th April.\n\nWatch the promo here-\n\nWe want the show to start Naav naav!\n\nFor more blogs on Indian Television, follow TV Ji Gharpe Hai\n\nFollow TV Ji on Instagram & Twitter\n\n‘Finite’ end to the never ending saas-bahu dramas\n\nPakistani dramas are extremely popular in Asia and America because their shows run up to maximum 25 episodes whereas our Indian soaps go on forever. Indian writers on the other hand are forced to introduce lame antagonists, add all sorts of nonsensical unnatural stuff, take limitless leaps, and do what not to stretch the show as long as the TRP’s keep coming in.\n\nIn 2003 ZEE TV made its presence felt with a concept called as Chausath Panne, 64-episodes of a serial. The series included serials such as Dil Na Jaane Kyon (DNJK), Lipstick, Astitva and Miit. Chausath Panne challenged the producer, director and writer and gave the viewers good content without pointlessly stretching the shows. But this concept didn’t last for long.\n\nWe had YRF shows like Rishta.com, Mahi Way, Khottey Sikkey, Seven,Powder with limited episodes, they were great in terms of content but weren’t accepted by the mass viewers. The never ending saas-bahu show saga took over the Indian Television until recently when TV channels came up with good finite shows. Daily soaps start promisingly but after some time they go downhill. They lose their charm, the characters change, the story gets haywire and what not.The only solution to stick to the script is by making finite shows. Interestingly, a lot of Bollywood filmmakers are now evincing interest in the small screen by coming up with fiction-based shows.\n\nTV Ji has listed her favorite finite shows on Indian Television from the recent past-\n\nEk Hasina Thi\n\nEk Hasina Thi was a Crime thriller television series created by Cinevistaas Limited for the channel Star Plus from 14 April 2014 to 20 December 2014. It was loosely based on the American series Revenge. The series has Sanjeeda Sheikh and Vatsal Sheth as leads, and, Simone Singh and Ayub Khan in supportive roles. The show was acclaimed by critics and viewer and it was one of the most successful show of Star Plus at that time.\n\nEverest\n\nYouth shows like this should often be made and TV industry is surely in dire need of such varying approaches for its ingratiating to see such out of the box shows coming up which are rather motivational and on an optimistic note. The story was about youngsters in an mountaineering institute getting trained to climb mount Everest and about the challenges, ambitions, passion, dreams and trials and tribulations in their lives.\n\nReporters\n\nReporters was an Indian fiction newsroom drama television series based on The Newsroom (U.S. TV series), which premiered on 13 April 2015 on Sony Entertainment Television. The show stars Rajeev Khandelwal as Kabir and Kritika Kamra as Ananya, playing television reporters on the. Not only did the show maintain its pace, but the content kept consistently evolving. The script and screenplay seemed tightly knitted together with no scope for any squeezing- in of a redundant scene whatsoever. And like the icing on the cake, the story is being presented in layers, with one layer opening to reveal another.\n\n24\n\n24 is a series based on the American series of the same name, made in the Hindi language. The show, primarily written by Rensil D’Silva and directed by Abhinay Deo, stars 24 season 8 actor Anil Kapoor, also a producer, in the lead role. 24 premiered on October 4, 2013 on Colors channel, airing twice-weekly, and concluded on December 21, 2013. The first season of 24 was a massive success, garnering accolades and high viewership.\n\nP.O.W- Bandhi Yuddh Ke\n\nUnlike the usual practice, POW is commissioned as a series by Star with a finite number of episodes – 126 to be precise. P.O.W. – Bandi Yuddh Ke (Prisoners of War India) a drama about three Indian soldiers who were captured seventeen years ago while on a mission with their unit in the Kargil conflict in Kashmir.

It has altogether a fresh take on love and is very realistic in its treatment. ‘Dahleez’ conveys the most beautiful expressions of love in a very relatable manner.\n\nFor more blogs on Indian Television, follow TV Ji Gharpe Hai\n\nFollow TV Ji on Instagram & Twitter\n\nWhy Indian Television stopped Imagine(ing)? – Imagine TV and the shows we miss\n\nOn 12 April 2012, it was announced that Imagine TV would close, as the channel struggled for ratings amidst competition from rival Hindi entertainment channels, where it was even beaten by the newly launched Life OK. The channel which gave us some great shows suddenly went off air. All the shows ended abruptly which left fans disappointed. Even after 6 years of the channel going off air, TV Ji feels that Indian Television needs the shows that Imagine TV aired. Here are 5 shows which prove why we miss Imagine TV\n\n1.Jasuben Jayantilaal Joshi Ki Joint Family\n\nThe show, produced by Hats Off Production, tells the story of Jasuben Jyantilal’s joint family, their beliefs and morals, and the different circumstances they face. It depicts the values of the family under Jasuben and Jyantilal Joshi. It takes all kinds to make a family, but only love to keep it together, is the philosophy of Jasuben and Jayantilaal Joshi’s family who live in their ancestral home in Junagadh, Gujarat where even the smallest news makes headlines! With not a moment of dullness, Jasuben’s joint family is full of characters that have their own quirks and eccentricities which makes this show extremely entertaining.\n\n2. Kitani Mohabbat Hai\n\nThe Ekta Kapoor show, which was one of the most romantic and popular shows of its time, is still remembered for many a reason. The show marked the debut of two of the very popular and talented actors–Karan Kundra and Kritika Kamra. Arjun was an arrogant businessman who hated women while Arohi was an aspiring singer. The two completely opposite individuals meet and sparks fly. It’s said that love can change a person and Arohi’s love changes Arjun, who leaves all the luxuries of life to encourage Arohi’s ambition. The title track of the show was soothing, melodious and very catchy. It’s still fresh in our minds!\n\n3. Ek Packet Umeed\n\nAnother show from Hats Off Production, the show focuses on Ambika Dharamraj and 15 other members who have all chosen to make a change. Despite having undergone so much misery they now live a happy life in a home they can call their own and with a family of their choice! With a never-say-die attitude, each of the characters have taken it upon themselves to bring joy and happiness through the packets of food like masalas, aachar, papads, jams that they make and sell every day. Just like the other Hats Off Production shows, Ek Packet Umeed was real, relatable and refreshing.\n\n4. Radhaa Ki Betiyaan Kuch Kar Dikhayengi\n\nThe story of the show revolves around a widow named Radha and her three daughters, who were forced by circumstances to move from Meerut to Mumbai for survival. However, Mumbai didn’t greet them with green carpet, and in no time the family of four found that you need to have a lot of courage and patience to survive in the city of dreams. As the show continues, it reveals how circumstances try to suppress the girls and how Radha as a mother and mentor helps her daughters cope with every situation and to live their dreams. This is the kind of women empowerment we need on Indian Television.\n\n5. Nachle Ve with Saroj Khan\n\nHow can you dance on Bollywood songs and not remember Saroj Khan’s choreography? She gave us so many popular hook steps which never get old. Watching Nachle Ve with Saroj Khan made all of us feel like professional dancers. Saroj Khan aka Masterji teaching us the choreography on her popular songs made her show one of the most popular dance reality shows at that time. Let’s admit it, we’ve all performed at least one choreography that we learnt from the show in our school or building functions! To bring back the memories of the good old days, here is one of the most popular episodes of the show. Don’t be surprised if you remember the whole choreography already!\n\nFor more blogs on Indian Television, follow TV Ji Gharpe Hai\n\nFollow TV Ji on Instagram & Twitter\n\n5 progressive Indian Television shows that you should be watching\n\nFor today’s audience who is a Netflix addict and has a world of options to choose from for their entertainment, what plays on our Indian Television screens is quite a setback. Unrealistic and women-centric is how we can describe it best. But then there are few the soaps with more social stories and messages. With more meaningful plots, these TV shows also helped in shaping and changing the perceptions of the people who were still webbed in the items of old faiths, stereotypes and taboos!\n\nTV Ji has listed 5 progressive Indian Television shows that you should be watching-\n\nMain Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon\n\nMain Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon, which airs on Doordarshan has become one of the most watched TV shows in the world, with a viewership of over 400 million across 50 countries. Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon is the story of a young woman named Sneha Mathur (played on-screen by Meinal Vaishnav), who is a doctor by profession, and how she quits her job in Mumbai to go to her native village Pratappur and work there. She comes across many challenges and addresses various taboos like menstruation, contraceptives and masturbation. Through this show, the audience vicariously sees and understands the plagues of the society around them and how they need to be looked at and dealt with.\n\nGangaa\n\nGangaa is a series which got launched on March 2, 2015 and took up the serious issue of child widow custom in India. The plot revolves around Gangaa, a child widow played by Ruhana Khanna, who has an indomitable will to survive and live her life to the fullest, against all old age norms and beliefs the society is trying to impose on her. She plays a strong protagonist with an aim to abolish the child widow culture still rampant in many parts of India.\n\nStories by Rabindranath Tagore\n\nAnurag Basu‘s Stories By Rabindranath Tagore is a breath of fresh air for Indian Television viewers. ‘Stories by Rabindranath Tagore’ is based in the early twentieth century of the undivided Bengal. They are set in a politically volatile period in Calcutta where the protagonists pour in from their diverse rural, social and cultural backgrounds to encourage an upcoming new world. It’s noticed that Tagore portrayed his women characters as chance takers who would almost always resist the family and the social rules. The show is a perfect blend of Tagore’s words and Basu’s visualisation which would transport you to a complicated yet beautiful world where women took bold steps under trying situations in the nostalgic old Bengal.\n\nKya Qusoor Hai Amala Ka?\n\nKya Qusoor Hai Amala Ka is a Television Show aired on Star Plus which is an Indian remake of the well acclaimed and famous Turkish series “Fatmagul Sucu Ne” which means “What was Fatmagul’s fault?” Kya Qusoor Hai Amala Ka is the story of a rape victim Amala and her fight for justice against her wealthy culprits. Rape is a highly important and paramount issue in India and having a show focusing on this sensitive and salient issue should be a matter of pride for the channel. Women having faced such atrocities look for solace in storylines like these that highlight and understand their struggles and anguish. The show is excellently portrays the trauma and terror of a rape victim.\n\nDahleez\n\nA finite series, ‘Dahleez’ is an unconventional love story of two fascinating individuals, Swadheenta Ramakrishnan (Tridha Chaudhary), a young aspiring lawyer from a South-Indian middle-class household, and Adarsh, a North-Indian bureaucrat from a powerful and influential family.

But what are shows without soundtracks and sound effects? Would Komolika be the same without the ‘Lika Lika Lika’ playing in the background? Would Sodhi be as funny without the ‘O Papaji?’ You can’t think of Kyuki Saas bhi kabhi bahu thi and not sing Rishto Ke Bhi Roop Badalte hai! Title tracks of Indian Television Shows have stay with us even years after the show goes off-air\n\nHere are TV Ji’s favourite title tracks from Indian Television-\n\nKitni Mohabbat Hai\n\nThis title track was as fresh as the show. Arjun and Arohi made a fantastic pair on the show and were a total hit. And so was the show’s title track.\n\nKahin Toh Hoga\n\nOne of Star Plus’s most successful shows, Kahin To Hoga’s title track was very popular when it was first launched and TV Ji loves it even today.\n\nBalika Vadhu\n\nEven though we got annoyed with the show not ending, we still loved the title track and remember it even today. “Choti Si Umar Mein” is orginally singed by Shobha gurtu Rajasthani folk singer.\n\nSon Pari\n\nDekho aayi aayi aayi\n\nSona sonpari aayi….And now you’re already singing the whole song. The show aired 17 years ago and we still know the song as if it was yesterday.\n\nRemix\n\nTia, Ranveer, Anvesha and Yuvi formed the band Remix in the show and gave us a host of foot-tapping numbers. The original soundtrack was by Asma and we still can’t help but hum the song along even to this day.\n\nMiley Jab Hum Tum\n\nHulchul ho dil mein, miley jab hum tum! This song certainly brings back a lot of memories!\n\nJungle Book\n\nStraight out of our childhood memory box, this song gives us some serious nostalgia. The Jungle Book film released in 2016 remade this song but the original still remains more special.\n\nDil Mil Gaye\n\nHum toh chale the dost banke, jaane kahan dill mill gayye! These lines do ring a bell, don’t they? Just like the doctors kept falling in love with each other on the show, we also fell for this song. It was sung by none other than Sonu Nigam, along with Indian Idol contestant Prajakta Shukre.\n\nShararat\n\nJust like the show, the title track was equally shararti! Why do we still know the lyrics? Duh? Because we loved the and still do!\n\nStar parivaar\n\n*Special meantion* Even though it isn’t a serial but how can we forget title track of Star Parivaar Awards? Every year they have a different song but none of them can be as popular and special as the first one. Aap jo humko apnate nahi To banta nahi hamara Star parivaar…….. *BRB Crying*\n\nFor more blogs on Indian Television, follow TV Ji Gharpe Hai\n\nFollow TV Ji on Instagram & Twitter\n\n8 Pakistani shows which were loved in India\n\nPakistani TV serials on Indian Television might have just become a thing of the past, after ZEE TV banned Pakistani shows from airing in India. But that doesn’t erase the history. Indian viewers have consumed content from Pakistan for the past 30 years, starting from 1980s. Though Indian TV shows offer a wide variety of content in all genres, there is something about Pakistani shows that appeal to Indian viewers. With limited number of episodes of each show. a format diligently followed by the West, and a specific story line, these shows are certainly capturing the audience’s attention, worldwide. The plots aren’t dragged, the background music is minimal, and the language, well, it’s just poetry. TV Ji has listed 8 Pakistani shows which were loved in India-\n\nDhoop Kinare\n\nDhoop Kinare was a 1987 Pakistani television serial. The show centers on a team of doctors in a hospital in Karachi and revolves around their routines at the hospital and their private lives at home. The show starred Rahat Kazmi and Marina Khan in lead roles, was directed by Sahira Kazmi and written by Haseena Moin. In the early days of PTV, drama serials were usually applauded for being richly diverse in their plots and direction. They were appreciated in Pakistan and their quality content was cherished over the border in India as well. There were no torrentz or video streaming apps at that time. The viewers in India watched this show on VCR and fondly they talk about it even today. Sony TV made a remake of the show after 25 years which was called ‘Kuch Toh Log Kahenge’\n\nZindagi Gulzar Hai\n\nThis was the show that made Pakistani actor Fawad Khan a popular face in India. The show that premiered in 2012 on Hum TV in Pakistan was based on a novel by Umera Ahmad and was also inspired from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. It was a love story of Kashaf played by Sanam Saeed and Zaroon played by Fawad Khan. It was a classic poor girl and a rich boy love story and focussed on women’s struggle in the orthodox Pakistani society. The show instantly became a hit in Pakistan. And when the show travelled to India two years later, it re-created the history. The charms of the male protagonists, played by Fawad Khan floored TV Ji and many Indian female fans.\n\nHumsafar\n\nStarring Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan, Humsafar is probably the most popular Pakistani drama in the recent times that gained immense success when it aired on television in India. The story revolves around Khirad (Mahira) and Ashar (Fawad) who are compelled to marry each other to fulfil the wishes of their parents. They eventually fall in love and have the most beautiful bond. Sara (Naveen Waqar) had always imagined her life with Ashar but when that fails to happen, she makes it her top priority to separate the loving couple. This epic love saga is aptly cast and each episode is better than the previous. Not to forget, the title track was beyond beautiful.\n\nDastaan\n\nDastaan is about a love triangle set during the partition period of India and Pakistan. It was aired in India on Zindagi under the title Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam. Bano (Sanam Baloch) and Hassan (Fawad Khan) fall in love but are separated due to the partition. Bano is kidnapped by a man in India who she believes will take her to Pakistan one day. In their time apart, Hassan gets engaged to Rabia (Mehreen Raheel). When Bano returns, she feels disheartened by the state of Pakistan as someone tries to rape her. The show beautifully captures the tragedy of those who suffered massive losses during the partition.\n\nAunn Zara\n\nAunn Zara was a first feel good TV serial from Pakistan that became quite popular in India as it was very similar to Indian shows. The context of Pakistan and a new milieu gave the show a different flavour. It was a family comedy show of two people with different personalities–Aunn and Zaara, who are married to each other. Much like Indian serials, this show had dance, music, comedy, romance and the drama in equal measures. Also, Indian audiences loved the lead pair Maya Ali and Osman Khalid Bhatt’s love-hate chemistry. But the real stars of the show were two cute senior actresses, Nasreen Qureshi–the grandmother and Hina Bayat–the mother-in-law.\n\nGul-e-Rana\n\nGul-e-Rana’s (Sajal Ali) constant struggle to change the mindset of a conservative society makes the plot of this show. She fights for the rights of women and the sacrifices they are expected to perform once they are married. By matter of circumstances, she is married to a narcissist, chauvinist man who refuses to change his ways.\n\nMere Quatil Mere Dildar\n\nThe Pakistani show, starring Pak superstars Ahsaan Khan and Mehwish Hayat was the story of love, re-marriage, betrayal and revenge. Due to certain misunderstandings, Umar ends up divorcing Maham but she is not the one to take it quietly. She sets out to take revenge from this family and emerges triumphant. The show first aired in Pakistan in 2011 on Hum TV; it came to India on Zindagi, three years later in 2014.\n\nDaam\n\nDaam is a tale of friendship which reflects that the selfish decisions we make can impact many lives and the damage, is irreparable. Zara (Sanam Baloch) and Maleeha (Aamina Sheikh) are best friends despite the huge class difference between them. When Maleeha’s brother Junaid (Adeel Hussain) returns to Pakistan, he shows interest in marrying Zara. Maleeha gets extremely uncomfortable with this arrangement as she feels her best friend has manipulated her all these years just so she could enjoy their luxurious lifestyle.\n\nFor more blogs on Indian Television, follow TV Ji Gharpe Hai\n\nFollow TV Ji on Instagram & Twitter\n\nP.O.W Bandi Yuddh Ke- A New Beginning For Indian Television\n\nIt is difficult for a show that does not belong to the hit supernatural or saas-bahu category to survive on the Indian television screens, but if given a fair chance, then a show like ‘P.O.W. – Bandi Yuddh Ke’ had the potential to break stereotypes on Indian Television and rule the charts.\n\nNikkhil Advani’s POW – Bandi Yuddh Ke is mounted like a feature film. At a reported cost of about Rs 35 crore, it is budgeted like one too. It is the official remake of the Israeli TV drama Hatufim aka Prisoners of War and is one of the most expensive television shows ever produced in India. Shot in 90 locations with a crew of about 150 members, POW was poised to change the way Indian TV produced and consumed content. But according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council’s (BARC), the ratings of POW started low and didn’t really pick up till the last episode. Perhaps the audience which is looking for more subtlety and nuance has moved on to Netflix and Hotstar, binging on shows like Narcos, Black Mirror and Stranger Things.\n\nThe basic plot of the show is inspired by an Israeli drama series called Hatufim (Prisoners of War), upon which the hit American TV series Homeland is based. Two men, Naib Subedar Sartaj Singh (Purab Kohli), and Squadron Leader Imaan Khan (Satyadeep Mishra) go missing in action during the 1999 Kargil war, while their respective families struggle to lead their lives normally. But things take an interesting turn when the men finally return 17 years later to their homeland after escaping from the clutches of the Pakistani army.\n\nHere’s what TV Ji liked about the show-\n\nLimited number of episodes– Most shows forget about the plot they started with and become never ending with no story at all. Unlike the usual practice, POW was commissioned as a series by Star with a finite number of episodes – 126 to be precise.\n\nDirection– The show, directed by Nikhil Advani, needs to be rewarded for bringing something new and fresh on Indian Television, something that’s never been done before. More than a war and a political thriller, P.O.W is a show that focuses on family drama and emotions. It helps you connect to the show and the characters better. Sartaj’s middle class living in Patiala is way different from Imaan’s affluent family in Delhi which makes the show more complex and engaging.\n\nStrong Female Characters– The show portrays both the lead female characters as strong individuals. Imaan’s wife, Nazneen Khan (Sandhya Mridul) is trying to move on with her life and after much insistence from her two grown-up children agrees to marry Imaan’s brother, Salim. Whereas Sartaj Singh’s wife, Harleen (Amrita Puri), looks after her family and is still hoping for her husband who had immediately left for war right after they had tied the knot to return.\n\nActors- Sandhya Mridul, Purab Kohli, Satyadeep Mishra, Amrita Puri, and Manish Chaudhary have given brilliant performances. The complexity of emotions like staying away from your loved one and meeting him after 17 years and the dilemma that follows is shown so beautifully that our heart is filled with conflicting emotions.\n\nP.O.W Bandi Yuddh Ke won the Special Jury Award at the Seoul Drama Awards held in Korea. In addition, actor Satyadeep Mishra also won Best Drama Actor for essaying the role of Capt. Imaan Khan in the show. This is the first time that a show from India has been felicitated at these awards. The show has a IMDB ranking of 9.3 and ranks 5th on ‘The Highest Rated Hindi-Language TV Series’ on IMDB. TV Ji highly recommends all her readers to watch this show.

Promoting sad stories of the contestants to gain TRPS, dramatizing situations and forced controversial fights, the reality shows these days are hitting new levels of nonsense. But before the concept of reality shows entered Indian television screens, we had game shows which were simple, entertaining and we all wanted to be a part of them! TV Ji grew up watching these shows and would always dream to participate in them when she grows up. Little did she know that shows like Bigg Boss would take over the Indian television.\n\nHere are TV Ji’s favourite 5 Indian game shows and championships –\n\nBournvita Quiz Contest\n\nIf you were a ’90s kid like TV Ji, Sunday mornings would have included switching on Zee TV at 11am to see Derek O’Brien walking from behind psychedelically designed sliding doors and throwing general-knowledge questions at confident school kids from different parts of the country. It was the sole reason why our parents let us watch television. Derek O’Brien became every kid’s favourite host and the show went on to become one of the most iconic game shows in India. Seeing your friends go to the show and kick every other school’s reputation on television was quite thrilling.\n\nAntakshari\n\nDinner time meant ‘Antakshari’ time with the family. We vividly remember how Annu Kapoor and Pallavi Joshi entertained the audiences as the ‘Deewane’, ‘Mastane’, ‘Parwane’ competes against each other for the final cash prize. Though the format of the show was simple, it kept the viewers involved. Music lovers waited for the show–that spanned for 1.5 decades–every week with bated breath. It was such an original concept! With different rounds of antaras and mukhdas, this show was played by all of us, in many different versions.\n\nKaun Banega Crorepati\n\nSharp at 9 pm every day, we would be right in front of the TV and ready to answer the question before the contestant did. KBC, made Amitabh Bachchan the best host of the Indian television. His commentary and way of carrying the entire show was so appealing, that even Shah Rukh Khan couldn’t create the same magic, when he took over in KBC 2. Amitabh Bachchan’s husky voice made KBC the highest watched reality show of our times. “Phir milenge agle episode me tab tak ke liye Shabba Khair, Shubh Ratri Good Night!”\n\nKhullja Sim Sim\n\nTrue to its name, Khullja Sim Sim was based on the concept of choosing doors and getting luxurious prizes behind it. Much like a lottery, the game would be to choose between three doors, and the chance of winning really expensive items made this game so addictive. While a lot of participants took away great prizes, many could only get, TAI TAI FISH. With Aman Verma’s charming commentary, this show was a definite hit.\n\nBoogie Woogie\n\nToday every channel has its own dance reality show but back then Boogie Woogie is all we had. India’s first original dance show, winning the Boogie Woogie championship was considered huge unlike today where there are so many dancers winning so many shows. Javed Jaffery would tell the contestants that Boogie Woogie is just a show and winning or losing here doesn’t change how successful they will eventually become in life. He would mentor them like a good teacher does and would make you yearn for such a figure in your life. And of course, that didn’t come without a joke or two — the kind that might sound silly today but were perfectly amusing for us growing up back then.\n\nFor more blogs on Indian Television, follow TV Ji Gharpe Hai\n\nFollow TV Ji on Instagram & Twitter\n\n10 youth based shows from the 90s and early 2000s that taught us about love, life and friendship\n\nRemember the shows you used watch after school and discuss it with your best friend?

Here are TV Ji’s favourite youth based shows from the 90s and early 2000s that taught us about love, life and friendship-\n\nRemix\n\nWho knew that four students in the 12th standard of Maurya High School could change our lives, right? ‘Remix’ revolved around the lives of 4 teenagers – Tia, Yuvraj, Avnesha and Ranveer and their music group ‘Remix’. Karan Wahi aka Ranveer Sisodia was every teenage girl’s crush! Tia Ahuja, Anvesha Ray Banerjee, Yuvraaj Dev and Ranveer Sisodia met us through Remix, twelve years ago and have never left our hearts and minds since then. I know your singing the title track in your mind right now coz how can you not? ‘Remix hai apna jahaan!’\n\nLeft right left\n\nThe 2006 hit series Left Right Left swooped in to the Indian television audiences’ rescue with something truly hatke back in 2006. ‘Left Right Left’: A huge rage of it’s time this show celebrated the friendships between six confused, disoriented cadets in an Indian Army academy, who face many obstacles, yet stand still. The cast included Rajeev Khandelwal, Priyanka Bassi, Arjun Bijlani, Sanaya Irani and Vikas Manaktala who in no time became our favourite cadets.\n\nBanegi apni baat\n\nFrom pimples to pre-marital sex, Banegi Apni Baat covered it all! Banegi Apni Baat was on air for four years. It focused on college life, family drama, young romance and complicated relationships. It also had many kissing scenes, “which was novel”. The show starred actors such as Irrfan Khan, R Madhavan, Shefali Shah, Anita Kanwal, Divya Seth, Achint Kaur, Raman Trikha, Roshini Achreja, Firdaus Dadi, Sadiya Siddiqui, Varun Badola, Rakhee Tandon and Rituraj, among others.\n\nJust Mohabbat\n\nHey don’t worry fy ,simply karo fy Just Mohabbat Just Mohabbat…….’Just Mohabbat’: Loosely based on ‘The Wonder Years’, the show revolved around the life of Jai and his relationship with his friends Madhur, Roma and Sanjay and his imaginary friend Gautam. Growing up means problems. Just Mohabbat was one show that focused on all those little issues with families, friends, relationships.\n\nMahi way\n\nIn a country plagued with problems like casual body shaming, Mahi Way was centred around an overweight girl who would make no compromises when it comes to finding her Mr. Right. The cliff-hanger it ended on still haunts us.\n\nHip hip hurray\n\nHip Hip Hurray was a story of a bunch of high school students studying in the 12th standard. The show focused on their hopes, dreams, adventures, peer-pressure, fears and many different relationships, including parent-child. The concept of the show was fresh and novel for its time. They used slangs like ABCD- American Born Confused Desi, remember? They dealt with a lot of issues like drugs, addictions, exam stress, dark effects of internet and body-consciousness which today’s shows don’t even dare to address.\n\nDhoom Machaao Dhoom\n\n‘Dhoom Machaao Dhoom’: The musical drama was an ultimate tale of friendships and dreams. The story revolved around Priyanka Sethi and a band which she formed with her friends, the Pink Band. Let’s admit it- We all wanted to be a part of the pink band. The show gave us Vikrant Massey and most of had a huge crush on him which by the way hasn’t vanished yet. If you did not sing the title track with your friends in your classroom did you even have friends? *Mushkil hai raahein par,humko hai kis ka dar? Nazrein hai manzil par,kadmon mein hai duniya…Dhoom Machaao Dhoom Machaao..*\n\nKitni mast hai zindagi\n\n‘Kitni Mast Hai Zindagi’ was a fiction serial that showcased the talents of the ‘super seven’ (three boys and four girls) who were discovered in a countrywide talent hunt conducted by MTV and Balaji. It was MTV’s first fiction soap and was based on the story of a small town girl who comes to a large city to fulfill her dreams. The girl, who is alone in the city with no family to support her, faces many difficulties. The super seven included Karan Singh Grover, Panchi Bora, Barkha Bisht Sengupta, Manasi Parekh Gohil & Yash Tonk. All them started their careers with this show and went on to become successful actors in the industry. The show was telecasted on MTV India in the year 2004.\n\nSanjivani\n\nAmidst the plethora of K serials in the mid-2000s, there were a few shows which managed to catch our attention just because they were different from the regular saas-bahu drama. One such promising show was Sanjivani: A Medical Boon which revolved around the lives of 5 doctors who learn everything about life and love on the job. You might remember Dr. Rahul, Dr. Juhi, Dr. Omi and Dr. Simran in the lead roles with Dr. Shashank mentoring them to become ace doctors of the Sanjivani hospital.\n\nKya mast hai life\n\n‘Kya Mast Hai Life’: A musical Disney show focused on the lives of five teen friends: Ragini, Zeeshan (‘Zee’), Zenia, Ritu and Vir.

She started watching the show, unaware of what she was in for. Watching the show opened up doors in her minds that she didn’t know existed.\n\nStar Bestsellers was an Indian television series that was originally telecasted on Star Plus in 1999–2000. Each episode in the series was a separate story written and directed by young and upcoming writer-directors and it carried the special intensity for a different feeling but all about proper human condition and indicating that each person has something great at heart (love, affection etc.). Writers and directors who worked in creating the episodes of the series included Anurag Kashyap, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Imtiaz Ali, Sriram Raghavan, Anurag Basu and Hansal Mehta. Reading this, I’m sure like TV Ji, even you could not believe how you haven’t ‘t watch this show!\n\nIn an interview with the Hindustan Times last year, Tigmanshu Dhulia revealed how many current directors learnt their techniques from ‘Star Bestsellers’. He said that they all wanted to make movies eventually and that is what they moved on to doing. Popular actors like Irfan Khan, Rajit Kapoor, Tisca Chopra, Saurabh Shukla, Sonali Kulkarni and Ashish Chowdhary featured on the show in different stories. Click here to watch one of the most popular episodes, ‘Ek Shaam Ki Mulakaat,’ starring Irrfan Khan and Tisca Chopra and directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia.\n\nWatching this show made TV Ji realise how progressive the television content was back then. So, was the show popular at that time? TV Ji doesn’t think so. Very few people watched it. Yes, the show was beautiful and proved beneficial to the directors who are now famous filmmakers. Each episode was like a film, 40-45-minute short stories.\n\nIn the time of heroes and villains, ‘Star Bestsellers’ showed the viewers that people cannot be cleanly divided into good and bad and that grey takes up a lot of space in the human psyche. It showed people that no one is purely good or evil, and that everyone is a mix of both. In today’s time where stories revolve around snakes, gorillas and black magic, TV Ji longs for a show like ‘Star Bestsellers’ which was about real human emotions and relationships. Because, the current television shows are only driving people away from Indian serials.\n\nFor more blogs on Indian Television, follow TV Ji Gharpe Hai\n\nFollow TV Ji on Instagram & Twitter\n\nEverybody should love Sumit Sambhal Lega\n\nThe Indian adaptation of American sitcom Everybody Loves Raymonds, Sumit Sambhal Lega premiered two years ago but still resonates with the audience, even though it never fared well on the TRP charts. People criticised the show because it was an adaptation. As if Indian shows have always been original! So, despite the producers’ request, under the norm of the industry, low TRPS are reason enough for the channel to not green-light the show’s sequel.\n\nIndian audience is so used to unrealistic saas-bahu dramas that realistic stories have no place for them. For a leading channel like Star Plus to air a family comedy like Sumit Sambhal Lega in the prime-time slot was applaudable. Because of the amazing cast which included Satish Kaushik, Bharti Achrekar, Namit Das and Manasi Parekh, the series became popular in a matter of few episodes. In the times of over dramatized daily soaps, Sumit Sambhal Lega was a breath of fresh air for TV Ji. The show was directed Parmeet Sethi and produced by Deeya and Tony who have produced cult shows in the drama-comedy genre like Banegi Apni Baat and Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin in the past.\n\nSumit Sambhal Lega is the story of Sumit Walia, a sports journalist who constantly finds himself in a tug-of-war between his wife, Maya and his mother Dolly. The show throws light on a married man’s predicament of managing multiple relationships post marriage. The show revolves around the Walia family and how Sumit finds himself in situations that are sticky and twisted, yet somehow manages to escape them in a comical way. Here’s what TV Ji loved most about the show-\n\nClean comedy– Unlike most shows, Sumit Sambhal Lega did not use slapstick or cringe humour. The jokes would make the whole family laugh. TV Ji can watch the show over and over again, knowing each joke, yet laughing each time.\n\nCharacterization– It is very rare on Indian Television that the writers focus so much on characterization. We all think that every friend of ours resembles some character from the American sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S. After watching Sumit Sambhal Lega, you will relate your family members with the characters! The casting was spot on and all the actors did a phenomenal job at making their characters relatable.\n\nSomething for everyone– The quality of content was so good that it would keep the entire family hooked on the television screen. Every member of the family felt connected some character on the show. As a viewer TV Ji never felt disconnected as all the episodes were based on what we see in our family lives but with a generous hint of humour.\n\nThe show has an IMDB rating of 9.1 while the Highest Rated Hindi-Language TV Series has a rating of 9.4. Yet, the show failed to gain TRPS and in India we judge a show based on TRPs. There are umpteen examples of how the fear of TRPs either don’t offer room for experimentation on television or if at all something out of the box does emerge, the same ‘number mania’ kills it sooner than later. Sumit Sambhal Lega had similar fate. TV Ji thinks Indian TV is slowly dying for such niche audiences and that is the reason why directors are going digital. On digital platforms content can be available without the burden of TRPs.\n\nFor loyal fans like TV Ji, Hotstar remains a saviour as even today, we can binge watch shows like Sumit Sambhal Lega to refresh our mood!\n\nFor more blogs on Indian Television, follow TV Ji Gharpe Hai\n\nFollow TV Ji on Instagram & Twitter\n\n9 things which can happen only on Indian Television\n\nYou think you know what Indian Television Shows are capable of doing?
