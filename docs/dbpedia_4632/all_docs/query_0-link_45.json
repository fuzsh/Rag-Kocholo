        "text": "I am blogging on Barun Sobti, again. Well, having done one post on Sobtians, I did not want to repeat the same thing, but late in the night, when I’m off to bed and sometimes check in on twitter, my entire Timeline is FILLED or maybe Captured or conquered? By / With all things Barun. So there’s no way I can stop myself from thinking about him, or his Sobtians! So here’s telling you a few reasons why Barun has the world’s greatest fans!\n\nI know I know, anyone who’s a Sobtian, can easily write a book on why they love him so much or why are they such extremely loyal fans! But but, there’s one more side to it! Even though they can write a book, they will never do it! Reason? Well, as filmy as it gets; Pyaar Toh Nibhaaya Jaata Hai. So, they are not the ones who’re going to come out and boost about how much love him, they’re just standing by him. Quietly, and patiently.\n\nAccording to me, there are 2 types of celebrities:\n\n#1 – Who keep posting their selfies/pictures/etc etc every now and then, with a super-boring-yet-extremely-inspiring quote or a simple “Good Morning”. Their fans get pictures every morning or after every party they attend.\n\nAnd then there’s number 2 – Who do not share as many pictures. Keep their personal life away from professional life. They know where the line ends. And! They’re mostly not found on social media (sorry for bad joke!)\n\nClearly, Barun falls in the 2nd category and also, there’s a 3rd category called Barun, which means he is hardly seen anywhere. If your luck permits and you bump into him, he’s not combed his hair, has a hoodie, and is still ready to get a picture with a fan! (Which I suppose just happened very very recently!)\n\nCan you imagine? You’re either a fan of the celebrity who posts their pictures every morning, night or maybe the entire day? Or Barun who just joined Twitter but is not tweeting? Which sounds more interesting? Okay, that last paragraph was just random stuff.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that he’s not that social and stuff, in fact, I actually like such people; a lot. I like it when ‘celebrities’ don’t act exactly act like celebrities. And Barun is probably the world’s sweetest ever celebrity. I mean I recently read a fan post which said that he even offered his chair to that girl’s mother! I mean how sweet is that? (Lets just say, Khushi Ke Aansoon :’) ) I have already (like many of his Sobtians) mentally awarded Barun with the “Most Humble Person Alive” Award!\n\nHis fans are as sweet, generous, loving, accepting and helpful as him. They respect your likes and dislikes, BUT you say someting against him, they’re not leaving you! (I SWEAR BY THAT) Most importantly, I guess they’re just a family of really sweet and humble people. (Now Barun can say, “I have 3 families! My family, My friends, and My Sobtians!)\n\nKeeping in mind the “I’m Offended” thoughts, incase you’re offended by any of views in this post, feel free to comment, tweet or anything else, because I don’t care! And! Tell me if you liked it! I hope I didn’t bore you, (just say no!)\n\nHere’s my first post on the Sobtians – http://www.meinekanjaanipaheli.wordpress.com/2014/06/14/sobtians-name-is-enough-eh/\n\nFollow me on Twitter – @meinekpaheli\n\nMail me – meinekpaheli.anjaani@gmail.com\n\nP.S. – I don’t know why did I do another post on Sobtians, but I just saw a few tweets that kinda made me wanna to something on you guys. I know I’ve probably been ‘maska maro-ing’ you guys (maybe some people are thinking that way) but clearly, I just really really love and get inspired? by your fandom/family/sobti-wala-pyaar (sorry for implied joke) and it makes me wanna do something on him. I hope I didn’t ‘offend’ you in anyway. And incase I did, sorry not so sorry 😛\n\nNamaste Hashtag Sobtians!\n\nTo be extremely honest, I was in the mind frame to start off with some ‘Spiritual’ or ‘Real-Life-Problem-Solver’ , BUT then, I came across this Ah-Favionically-Fantastically-Mazing ‘fandom’ called the “SOBTIANS” ! ( The name is kind of fascinating I must say 😀 )\n\nBasically, I was just going through a few interviews of Celebrities (All kinds of them : Actors, Actresses, Sportsmen, Business Tycoons, etc etc.) and came across an Interview of John Abraham, with “Team SaRun” (Trust me all this while I have been wondering what “SaRun” actually means! Incase you know, do let me know, please. Thankyou.) What actually makes me want to publish this blog post is the kind of words and phrases John TheAmazinglyLovely Abraham (Yeah right, I love him!) used to describe this “Cute – Babyish – Handsome Boy” Barun Sobti.\n\nLet me first tell you my reaction when I saw his pictures.\n\nAfter I was done with watching the interview and drooling over John’s expressions, voice etc etc (practically everything) I was intrigued and self-committed to see this actor “Barun Sobti” AND the Sobtians, well for butt-obvious reasons! Like an extremely normal person, I opened up Google and went on to first read about this guy (I tell you, his fandom has observed EVERY-BIT of his body, life, career, etc etc!) I tried to read a few articles, but honestly for some reasons, I just couldn’t read on any further! One of them being that there is so much about him online, be it on social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr or elsewhere, that I was awestruck! To be honest, I haven’t seen such a fandom ever before! It’s a whole big family in itself called the “Sobtians” ! Hence, i believe calling them a fandom is somehow, unfair. They’re a complete whole big Family!\n\nMoving on, after I was finally done reading about “Asia’s 3rd Sexiest Man” I moved onto check up with his career and all other aspects that surprised me beyond any boundaries! His first show, “Shraddha” I managed a few rushes of the show and was in a dilemma, “how did John even like such an actor?” ( No Sobtians, don’t start to hate on me so soon. I have a lot for you guys in store!) honestly, I did NOT like him in that show, for some reason. But I still wanted to watch more him, a tad bit more. So I started off with his second show “Dill Mill Gayye” and BAM! Here I changed my opinion to some extent! I somehow, like how he portrayed Raj’s character and did just enough justice to it. That was just the one thing I needed to watch another “tad bit” of him. Moving on to his next show, “Baat Hamaari Pakki Hai” ( Which is still very talked about on the internet and social media! ) And I must say, that this guy, JUST GOT BETTER with every episode I saw (Well I did not watch the complete show because honestly, hindi dramas are not my cup of tea, but Barun Sobti was somehow one reason I was able to tolerate those few rushes of a few daily soaps!)\n\nBy the end of that day, I had completed reading almost every aspect about him, going through (stalking) a few tweets and Sobtians, and watching a bit of him. I had now added a new task to my “day planner board” for the next day which was “WATCH HIS NEXT SHOW” ! I slept more peacefully that day, I have no idea why am I even saying this, but somehow, I slept with this one excitement to wake up and read and see more of Barun and that finally after so long, I was upto something interesting 😛 !\n\nI woke up, XD and after all the daily work and daily dose of family love and talk and all that, I was finally on my desk, investigating about Barun Sobti again. I opened my diary and the first thing I saw was “WATCH HIS NEXT SHOW” written in exactly the same way it shows here. There, I was watching him, tad bit of him, yet again.\n\nI’ll confess, I know I said that “daily soaps aren’t my cup of tea” and all that, but this show (Iss Pyaar Ko Kyaa Naam Doon) was kind of interesting and kept me glued to my laptop screen until that Hut / Cabin scene between Arnav & Khushi ( Damn that scene was HAWT! ) I have to say this again, but Barun Sobti was completely WOW in the show. So much, that when I stopped watching it, I had already started to use a few phrases from the show in my daily life. I said the much conjectured “what the!” everytime I was in a dilemma or angry at my brother. “Hello Hi Bye Bye” was the new “kitty obsession” with my mum and her friends! All her kitty members entered our house saying “Hello Hi Bye Bye” and left me just -_-. “Tum theek ho” were another set of “3 magical words” for my cousin sister (Gosh she now wants a life partner who would ask that to her every now and then!)\n\nAfter completing those episodes, I moved on to watch a few of youtube’s suggestions about Barun & IPKKND (How & What the Sobtians call it ;)!) Well, I watched Off-Screen segments, and once I finished those, trust me I sat down with an extremely bad stomach ache. The segments were, let me sum up in one word, EPIC. I couldn’t stop laughing! That gave me another answer to my question that “Why do Sobtians love Barun Sobti SOO much?” 😛 I was very definite by then that “This guy Barun, is one special kind” His interviews are so frank and honest that it made me a small little fan of his, honestly.\n\nI have met a few TV actors ( Reason: My granny watches a lot of daily dramas and she loves to visit the locations and see what’s gonna happen next on her favrouite show! ) I didn’t see any such “Oh I am a star and I should get a lot of importance” kind of behavior in ANY of those segments. He was just like any other casual guy, who is working, enjoys his job, has a set of great friends, enjoys his work, loves his wife, lives his life on the edge! Easy. On the contrary, I remember visiting a few sets and waiting for long hours with my Granny to meet those actors and all that crap which I hated, completely. Anyways, I think he is totally awesome. Infact, the complete cast of the show is awesome. I know this is nothing new for the Sobtians, but to me, it was A WHOLE BIG NEW TOPIC to work on.\n\nJust after I was done with his career investigation, I moved onto his personal life. Honestly, when I was done with reading all my drafts and saved Interviews of his on his personal life, I was kind-of teary-eyed. Starting off, I read his personal life on Wikipedia first 😛 which was clear, but NOT all what I actually to know! So I went on and read a few more Interviews, heard and watched a lot of them. What I loved about his, was that he ALWAYS made a point to mention his wife wherever and whenever possible. I think that’s one quality every girl needs in her apparent “Mr. Right” 😀 ( I am an extremely practical creature, hence I would never think of or even dream of a “Mr. Right” but I also know that once a girl crosses this one age mark of 21, she is bombarded with questions asking “What qualities do you want in your Mr. Right?” and I probably am the one who is left with a poker face, when it comes to answering this.) Anyways, this one quality really hit me hard, and I was head over heels in love with him at THAT moment. I saw those few pictures of his marriage and the fact that he had a TYPICAL PUNJAABI marriage got the inner emotional monster out of me! ( This being the first time I actually got emotional for someone I don’t even know, or maybe I never even heard of keeping in mind the kind of anti-social and weirdass person I am )\n\nMoving on, I then stalked twitter for like 17 days? I used my best friend’s account and stalked it day in-day out! I think, it was 6th of June when the I came across extremely extremely extremely creepy and highly fascinating tweets and hashtags o_O. For Example, #IPKKNDHamesha #IssPyaarKoKyaNaamDoonLivesOnForever #Sankadevi ( Good lord, what on earth does that mean? I heard that when I watched the show, but again, I still haven’t found out its meaning! ) #LaadGoverner etc etc etc. But all that, managed a HUGE HUGE HUGE grin on face! I read those overflowing tweets at around 8pm IST with so much awe! I was left speechless, because those tweets were just so awesome, I mean WOW. It was only later, that I listed out a few of the Sobtians and stalked their twitter accounts bad! I listed around 29 of them? Trust me, it was treat to actually go through all those 29 accounts! Be it in 140 characters, or pictorial edits, or Video Mixes, or anything else based on him, or the show, was completely mesmerizing (No am not done yet!) While I was going through those accounts, I got to know that it was a trend that day for the show’s 3rd anniversary! Also, that this Sobtian Parivaar (Family) has hosted numerous such trends! Man that was just above and beyond my expectations! Such love for an actor is commendable! The whole Sobtian family, is just 3 words, WOW. I saw a few accounts that were named after his body parts, his laugh, his dance style, and his BUTT. (No offence, but dude THAT made me laugh my ass out, I was also very surprised and elated that people can ACTUALLY love someone so UNCONDITIONALLY!) Then I saw this one account for “besharmi” (shamelessness) and *seals mouth* I didn’t know what to say. This family, was just too great and amazing to even handle!\n\nFurthermore, never forgetting FEMALE POWER! I knew / had heard about Sanaya Irani a lot. I had seen her paper ads, done the croma ad with her, and that my friend was a fan of her show “Miley Jab Hum Tum” I knew a lot about her already. Sanaya did a fabulous job as Khushi Kumaari Gupta Singh Raizada. She too is a sensation among the Sobtian Family. I think no one, could have done the role of Khushi like how she did it. Totally amazing, and honestly, I think my cousin brother should get a wife like Khushi because he too is kind of unemotional and all that stony person. Keeping my family aside LOL, Sanaya Irani is an amazing actress and did complete justice to the character of Khushi. I am in all praises of her after this stint of hers. Also, she then was in the list of my “Women Crush Wednesdays” because she is one women I THINK I could crush on maybe ;).\n\nOkay, after I read and saw so much, I FINALLY figured out what “SaRun” actually meant and how precious it/they is/are for the Sobtian Family. I think this pair NOW will be one of MY OPT (One True Pairing). SaRun, for those who didn’t know (like me) is the shipname for Sanaya Irani and Barun Sobti. On the otherhand, ArShi is the shipname for Arnav and Khushi.\n\nI think this was the cutest and most overwhelming post I was working on!\n\nI couldn’t have ended without having posted/inserted a WHOLE IPKKND (Iss Pyaar Ko Kyaa Naam Doon) Family photograph. The complete cast was fabulous and the off-screen segments showed them like a big family in real, which I haven’t seen on many shows, for obvious reasons. I also got to know the “war” and “drama” the IPKKND twitter family had with the channel airing the show when Barun Sobti left the show to pursue his career on the silver screen. (Sorry, but I am still not clear whether he quit the show or what because different sites gave different reasons.) How the show had to be ended because the fans did not want ANYONE else apart from Barun Sobti as Arnav Singh Raizada. I think that was the most amazing part, I mean I still can’t imagine the amount of love the viewers actually gave to this show, commendable!\n\nDaljeet was great as Di. Nani was awesome. Gupta family perfect. Mami was TOO CUTE. Mamaji was hardly seen. Akash was good. Amma was always afraid of something or the other. Babuji, well that character must have been the most relaxed one. Jiji was nice too. Hari Prakash, Om Prakash were another jaans of the show. Everybody and every character in that show was perfectly written, conceptualized, and shown, no more, no less.\n\n[RANDOM – NESS ATTACK !! ]\n\nThe picture below is my favorite! Barun and Sanaya look totally amazing with that baby boy.\n\nOh also, I came across a few err… a lot of Fan Fictions and a few of them were totally amazing! I mean the people who’ve actually written them, are fabulous! I applaud you guys! *Stands and claps!* I think the one I really liked was “Unconscious Love” and I have no reasons to put forward for that “Why?” popping in your head at the moment.\n\nWith Barun Sobti soon making his debut in the Bollywood Industry, I am waiting for Sanaya’s entry in the industry too! So to end it all.\n\nGo watch Satra Ko Shaadi Hai, 22 Yards, and Main aur Mr. Right starring Barun Sobti ( Whenever they release ) make sure, you watch first day, first show, because, Barun Sobti.\n\nP.S Tell me who edited this picture, because I want to sue that person to court and get them hanged to death for making this edit.\n\nThis edit made no sense, because this picture was perfect with Barun and Pashmeen and was NOT REQUIRED TO BE EDITED IN THIS WAY EVEN IF YOU LOVE “SaRun”!\n\nP.P.S : I also got to know that Barun and his wife are shipped as BarMeen (Barun and Pashmeen) which sounds too cute.\n\nP.P.P.S : Oh also that Sanaya and Mohit are shipped as MoNaya which again is cute!\n\nP.P.P.P.S : THE WHOLE SOBTI PARIVAAR (family) IS AMAZING and am glad I worked on this post and spent so much time putting it together! I totally enjoyed my time with this post!\n\nP.P.P.P.P.S : I would to work on another post soon! VERY soon! I hope you guys liked it!\n\nP.P.P.P.P.P.S : I really liked the concept of a contract marriage XD\n\nP.P.P.P.P.P.P.S : Follow my blog, okay?\n\nLeave your feedback here.\n\nMail me at : meinekpaheli.anjaani@gmail.com for any blog requests!\n\nFollow me on twitter : @meinekpaheli\n\nDo comment and show your love if not for me, for Barun and Sanaya perhaps 😛 😀\n\nNamaste!"
