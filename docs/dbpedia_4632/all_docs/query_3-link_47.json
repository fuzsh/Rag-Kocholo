        "text": "Popular show Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon's lead pair Barun Sobti (Arnav Singh Raizada) and Sanaya Irani (Khushi Kumari Gupta) are really thick in real life.\n\nBarun, who is making a comeback to TV with the show's third installment, will now be seen with Kasam actress Shivani Tomar in Season 3. However, the actor has stayed in touch with former co-star Sanaya. And their stormy reel relationship has over the years blossomed into a beautiful friendship.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThey play stupid pranks, and constantly pull each other's legs\n\nLike best friends do. Both Sanaya and Barun met each other on the sets of Gul Khan's show Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon, and they quickly became friends. In fact, they are so close to each other that even during joint interviews their chemistry and affection they have for each other shines through. Adorable.\n\nThey hang out, and even spend their birthdays together\n\nAccompanied by their lovely and supportive partners of course. Here are a couple of sweet pictures of them for you to sigh at:\n\nThey have each other's back at all times, and are loyal to the core\n\nHere is a video of Barun and his wife Pashmeen Manchanda howling for Mohit Sehgal and Sanaya Irani's victory in Nach Baliye 8.\n\nAnd Sanaya in turn had only good wishes for his former co-star and current best friend. Here is what she had to say on Barun Sobti's return to the small screen:\n\n\"I am really looking forward to season three and what the storyline shapes up to be. Barun has been one of my most favourite co-stars, and continues to be an amazing friend even today,\" Sanaya said in a statement to IANS.\n\nShe added, \"Now that he's back on TV, I'm really excited for him. Barun is a crazy person and I wish him all the craziness and good luck for the third season.\"\n\nAww.\n\nWhen Barun said he misses working with Sanaya Irani\n\nBarun recently told DNA that not having Sanaya on sets of IPKKND Season 3 sucks.\n\n\"Sanaya and I are really good friends. As a co-star and for the kind of talented actor she is, I will definitely miss her on the show since our chemistry was highly appreciated. We continue to be good friends after the show, and we do meet often!\"\n\nBe still, my thundering heart.\n\nEvery single time they grace our screens together\n\nInterviews, promos, award functions, random pictures. All of it. They are goals af.\n\nThank you for existing, both of you."
