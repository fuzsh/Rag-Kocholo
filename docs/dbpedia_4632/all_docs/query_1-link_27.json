        "text": "Wagle Ki Duniya\n\nStreaming on SAB TV, Wagle Ki Duniya is based on characters created by famous cartoonist RK Laxman, and a remake of Shah Rukh Khan’s 1988 show of the same name. It is a refreshing sitcom featuring the very talented Sumeet Raghavan as Rajesh Wagle, a courier company manager caught between the everyday shenanigans of his middle-class family that spans three generations. From scriptwriting to comic timing to vividly portraying issues familiar to the middle-income diaspora, the show surely stands out on its own, and will hopefully continue to dominate Indian screens with its sheer quality of content.\n\nBade Ache Lagte Hai 2\n\nA sequel to Ram Kapoor and Sakshi Tanwar’s much-acclaimed show, Bade Ache Lagte Hai 2 has been grabbing eyeballs for its dramatic and romantic storyline on Sony TV. Nakkul Mehta and Disha Parmar have perfect chemistry as Ram and Priya, two polar opposites who come together as a compromise but later fall in love. The show has elements from both its previous season and Star Plus serial, Pyaar Ka Dard Hai Meetha Meetha Pyaara Pyaara, which boasts of the same lead pair. So far, the show has sustained its coherent plot, peppered with cute banter and romantic moments between protagonists.\n\nAnupama\n\nA household name, Anupama is one of the best shows Star Plus has ever made. Rupali Ganguly, who is recognisable as Monisha from Sarabhai VS Sarabhai, plays a middle-aged woman who tries to constantly go against societal expectations, to fulfil her dreams. Hers is an inspiring story for many mothers looking for courage to step out of their homes and give wings to their unfulfilled passions.\n\nYe Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai\n\nThirteen years and three generation later, Star Plus’ Ye Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai stresses on the idea of keeping one’s marriage and family above everything else. Despite its overstretched and sometimes dated plot, the show is a favourite among many, and sports the handsome Harshad Chopra as its lead male protagonist. Moreover, with its perfect aesthetic backdrop and stellar cast, the show promises to transport you into a world of family, love, conflict and emotional reconciliation—all wrapped under a grand celebration of every festivity possible.\n\nKaun Banega Crorepati\n\nA hit since its inception in 2000 on Star Plus, the latest season of Kaun Banega Crorepati will go on-air around mid-August on Sony TV. Helmed by Amitabh Bachchan aka Big B, Kaun Banega Crorepati has been disseminating knowledge while entertaining and (quite literally) enriching generations of Indians. Be ready with your current affairs notes and trivia books before the next season hits screens as it is going to be a ‘mind’ blowing affair for sure.\n\nUdaariyan\n\nWith its authentic Punjabi background and sinister villain stuck between ambition and obsession, Udaariyan has all the markings of a typical ‘masala’ show. Streaming on Colors TV, Udaariyan follows the story of Jasmine, a village belle with dreams of flying abroad. After she ditches her boyfriend Fateh on the altar, he ends up marrying her nicer, more docile sister Tejo. Out of jealousy, Jasmin starts plotting against the couple and chaos ensues. The plot feels heavy at times, but a talented cast gives a fresh outlook to the stereotypical female vamp angle.\n\nMere Sai, Shraddha aur Saburi\n\nNow showing on Sony TV, this serial encapsulates the life of famed 19th century religious saint, Sai Baba from Shirdi, Maharashtra. Full of devotion and stories from his life, Mere Sai, Shraddha aur Saburi is a feel-good show about Sai Baba’s kindness, generosity and selflessness. Tushar Dalvi as Sai is the perfect mixture of composure and thoughtfulness in a show that is less of an appreciation of Sai, and more of a historical drama that introduces you to people and their faiths back in the day.\n\nNaagin\n\nA Colors TV flagship project of sorts, Naagin has its own fanbase despite the memes and jokes made at its expense. Six seasons later, it is one of those shows you can watch if you are in no mood to devote your intellect to deciphering a plot. Filled with snakes, lizards, spiders, and every possible reptile, this supernatural fiction show is a hit among Indian audiences, and regularly features Bollywood celebrities who mix up with the cast as part of film promotions.\n\n(Edited by Zoya Bhatti)"
