Many actresses gave us some amazing inspiration with their journey in the industry, one such actress we are talking of today is none other than Sanaya Irani.\n\nBorn and brought in the Parsi family in Mumbai, Sanaya Irani was a normal student opting for her studies. She was simple but that’s what caught the eyes of Boman Irani who then was a photographer. He did the first modeling portfolio of Sanaya Irani. Sanayi rani debuted in Bollywood with Aamir Khan and Kajol’s Fanaa where she played Mehbooba.\n\nSanayi rani debuted on television with Left Right Left. She then played a negative role in Radhaa Ki Betiyaan Kuch Kar Dikhayengi. It was 2008 and that was the best day of her life, she got the college romance show Miley jab Hum Tum which also starred Mohit Sehgal, Arjun Bijlani and Rati Pandey. The show made the couple Gunjan played by Sanaya and Samrat played by Mohi Sehgal popular. They also started dating after the show and even hosted a show, Zara Nachke Dikha together.\n\nIt was Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon? Which gave Sanaya Irani major fame. She played the lead protagonist Khushi who falls in love with business tycoon Arnav Singh Raizada played by Barun Sobti. The show took her to the new heights as the chemistry shared by both of them was the catch of the show.\n\nAfter marrying her boyfriend Mohit Sehgal in 2016, she appeared in Nach Baliye with Mohit Sehgal and ranked 3rd. the show was a little controversial as the fans trolled both for being the fixed winners.
