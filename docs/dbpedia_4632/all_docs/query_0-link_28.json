The story had always been familiar but Imtiaz said he found details he didn't know while reading it in an anthology of love stories, propelling him to write some scenes that eventually became a full-fledged film. While reading it, I had this feeling that the characters were similar. It is something that you often get with Shakespeare. You feel he is talking about your emotions. I wrote some of the scenes and subconsciously placed those scenes in Kashmir, he said during a visit to the PTI office this week. \"Laila Majnu\", a modern-day adaptation of the legendary story, is co-produced and co-written by Imtiaz.

The proposal, announced just a month ago, was met with a backlash from the movie industry and film reviewers, who said it would create a two-tier system of 'popular' and 'unpopular' films. \"There has been a wide range of reactions to the introduction of a new award, and we recognize the need for further discussion with our members. We have made changes to the Oscars over the years, including this year, and we will continue to evolve while also respecting the incredible legacy of the last 90 years,\" Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said in a statement.
