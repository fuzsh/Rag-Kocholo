        "text": "Rangrasiya is an upcoming show that will replace Bigg Boss in December. Produced by Saurabh Tewary, who is behind the hit show Madhubala, Rangrasiya stars Sanaya Irani, last seen in Chhanchhan and Ashish Sharma best known for his role inGunahon Ka Devta. He was last seen in Rab Se Sona Ishq. The promo ofRangrasiya has been shot in the Rann of Kutch, and the episodes will be filmed in Jaisalmer. Says Saurabh, \"It's a passionate, edgy love story and Rajasthan provides the best backdrop for the scale and grandeur of the show. It is an ideal place to shoot romance, passion and aggression.\" The serial is about Rudra (Ashish), a border security personnel and Parvati (Sanaya), an orphan girl, who are ideologically different. While Parvati believes in love, Rudra hates anyone who invests in that emotion, and yet they get attracted to each other. Both Sanaya and Ashish will be banking on this show as their last outings did not exactly stirke a chord with the viewers.\n\nhttp://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-first-look-1920059\n\nHome / TV / BREAKING: Bigg Boss 7 To Be Replaced By...\n\nBigg Boss 7 will have it's Grand Finale on December 29, 2013. Post this Colors is ready to launch two dailies - one at the 9:00PM slot, and the other one at the 9:30PM slot.\n\nThe shows in question are, Beintehaa and Rangrasiya.\n\nBeintehaa: The show is centered on Islam. It is a passionate love story and will be produced by Farhan Salaruddin's Fortune Productions. The lading lady for the show is Amrita Rao's younger sister Preetika Rao.\n\nA film journalist by profession, Preetika had her own Bollywood column with South Side Movie Magazine in Chennai and in Banaglore, where she contributed to from Mumbai. During her stint as a columnist, Preetika has contributed to film articles in leading papers across Bangalore and Mumbai.\n\nWith this show, Preetika marks her debut on television. She made her debut in Tamil cinema in December 2010, with the romantic film, Chikku Bukku, with Arya and Shriya Saran. Beintehaa is currently shooting across the exotic locales in Bhopal.\n\nBeintehaa premieres on December 29, 2013 at the 9:00PM slot.\n\nThe second show is Rangrasiya: Once again a love story, set in army background, is being produced by Nautanki Films.Ashish Sharma and Sanaya Irani play the main leads of this drama series. The show is tipped to be on the lines of Yash Chopra's magnum opus Jab Tak Hai Jaan.\n\nRangrasiya premieres on December 29, 2013 at the 9:30PM slot.\n\nMost of the recent launches on Colors have really not faired well except for Comedy Nights With Kapil. Colors is striving hard to maintain their number two position and faces stiff competition from Zee TV.\n\nBigg Boss 7 has really not given the required boost to the channel's staggering TRPs.\n\nSanaya Irani to strike back on small screen with Rangrasiya'!\n\nPost her disastrous stint with Chhanchhan', Sanaya Irani was becoming labeled as invisible, when she decided to get back once again. Bang! Here comes another hot shot power packed high octane love story called Rangrasiya', featuring Sanaya Iraniin main leads.\n\nJust in case you thought that it would bomb too, let's give a small intro of the male lead, starring opposite Sanaya, in this love project. He's handsome and rocked in his small screen debut as the love sick goon in his love cum action small screen prime time show called Gunahon Ka Devta'. Yes, it's the dashing, suave and uber handsomeAshish Sharma, who has already been known to strike a chord with his female fan followings.\n\nThe show, loosely based on the works of Shakespeare's masterpiece Othello', will have Ashish Sharma as Rudra Sharma', an Army officer, who does not believe in love, while Sanaya, named Parvati', will portray the role of a girl, for whom love is eternal and divine. Their paths will cross and voila! What we would see will be a high voltage drama of love vs hate in a new avatar, in what you can call a cross border love story. The show, Rangrasiya' is all slated to take the prime time slot of Bigg Boss 7, along with Beintehaa' in the pipeline.\n\nWith popular shows like Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon' and Mile Jab Hum Tum' in her kitty, we know Sanaya has the looks and skill to woo fans like never before. With a good looking pairing of Sanaya and Ashish, the new project by Viacom 18, is all set to go for the kill!\n\nThe promos of the show have already garnered a lot of interest and show potential for a devoted audience during the prime time. Rangrasiya' will have Rajasthan' in its background. The makers Saurabh Tewari and Nautanki films have been heard to shoot the episodes in the harsh deserts of Rajasthan and Rann of Kutch for the appropriate look and feel of the show. Tewari, known for his hit Madhubala' on Colors, will mark his second innings with Rangrasiya'.\n\nAccording to sources, the current season of Bigg Boss 7, is all set to end next month, paving way for Rangrasiya' and Beintehaa'. The two will fight with the other leading prime time shows on other channels.\n\nSlated to go on air from 30th December, 2013, the show, considering the sparkling fresh chemistry of Sanaya and Ashish, is all looking promising. Let's hope it retains the freshness and is able to garner the expected TRP's, as expected from a popular Sanaya prime time show.\n\nSanaya Irani and Ashish Sharma starrer Rang Rasiya to bring Shakespeare on Colors!\n\nThe first look of Sanaya Irani and Ashish Sharma starrer Rang Rasiya on Colors' has been released with a great response coming its way. Produced by Saurabh Tiwari andAbhinav Shukla's Nautanki Telefilm, which is popular with Madhubala-Ek Ishq Ek Junoon of Colors, the show is said to be on the lines ofWilliam Shakespeare's celebrated tragedy Othello.\n\nIt looks like our entertainment industry has been under the impression of this legendary novelist. As recently director Sanjay Leela Bhansali presented Shakespeare's popularRomeo and Juliet in his film Ram Leela. And now it's Saurabh Tiwari, who is set to display a passionate love-story of the writer on television screen.\n\nAccording to the sources, the story of Rang Rasiya would revolve around Rudra and Parvati. \"Rang Rasiya is a story of Rudra (played by Ashish Sharma) an army official, who does not believe in love and Parvati (played by Sanaya Irani), who always dreams of love. The story will further narrate Rudra and Parvati's strong, passionate and aggressive love story despite having different ideologies in life.\"\n\nThe story will have a Rajasthani backdrop, as you can notice in it promos. It has been extensively shot in the beautiful locations of Bikaner and Jaisalmer.\n\nThe show is expected to go on air after the closer of Bigg Boss 7. The time slot of 9-10pm would be filled by two new shows-Rang Rasiya and Beintehaa.\n\nSource: TNN\n\nBREAKING: Bigg Boss 7 To Be Replaced By...\n\nBy BusinessofCinema News Network on November 19, 2013\n\nBigg Boss 7 will have it's Grand Finale on December 29, 2013.
