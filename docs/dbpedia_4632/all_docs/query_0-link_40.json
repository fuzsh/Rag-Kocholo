        "text": "Category: Television\n\nWill Tanveer disrupt Imran-Nazma’s wedding?\n\nZee TV’s popular show Qubool Hai to be witness a high voltage drama in upcoming episodes. Now as per the ongoing track, we know that Imran is set to marry Nazma. Read Much…..\n\nWhich is the most romantic on-screen couple of television?\n\nAbout a decade ago, there was a rage of saas-bahu soaps; however today the scenario is different as television widely caters the youth, providing numbers of romantic shows, which are earnestly loved by its viewers. Pairing of Gautam Rode and Jennifer Winget in Star Plus’ Saraswatichandra is most loved, while others are Asad-Zoya (Karan Singh Grover-Surbhi Jyoti) of Qubool Hai, RK-Madhu (Vivian Dsena and Drashti Dhami) in Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon and Yash-Aarti (Gurmeet Chaudhary and Kratika Sengar) in Punar Vivah. So, today it’s time to tell us which of the TV on-screen couple would you like to be paired up for other shows as well? Read More…\n\nWho will Gunjan choose among Mayank and Rajeev in Sapne Suhane Ladakpan Ke?\n\nBubbly Gunjan (Roopal Tyagi) first fell in love with Mayank (Ankit Ghera), however misunderstandings separated the two and now it’s Rajeev (Zohaib Siddiqui), who is trying to win her hearts in Zee TV’s daily soap Sapne Suhane Ladakpan Ke. On the other end, Mayank also is aiming to return to Gunjan despite being married to Charu. Now that she has two men who love her unconditionally, what will be Gunjan’s decision in this situation? Whom do you think she will choose among Mayank and Rajeev? Who is best for Gunjan as per you?\n\nDo you think Sanaya Irani will bag success being part of Sony Tv?\n\nSmall Screen beauty Sanaya Irani, there is no doubt over the fact that post Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon, has been in demand and producers are waiting to sign her for their projects. She was even offered a love story by Madhubala-Ek Ishq Ek Junoon makers, Nautanki Telefilms. But she chose to go for Optimystix’s next for Sony Entertainment Television. The shows on Sony have never scored well as far as the TRPs are concerned with only exception being Ram Kapoor, Sakshi Tanwar’s Bade Acche Lagte Hain. Do you feel Sanaya has taken a wise decision? Will she bag success being part of Sony?\n\nWho do you think is the hottest actress of small screen?\n\nIndian television actresses are always seen dressed in traditional look especially saris and salwar suits as this fit their on screen image of ideal bahu, beti and of course wife. However, off screen they too are no less than any Bollywood hottie and can give many a run for their money. Be it Ankita Lokhande (Pavitra Rishta), Hina Khan (Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai), Krystal Dsouza (Behna), Mouni Roy (Devon Ke Dev…Mahadev), Drashti Dhami (Madhubala), Sanaya Irani (IPKKND) or Sukirti Kandpal (Rab Se Sohna Isshq), all have come up with their diva like look. Who happens to be the hottest actress on screen? Who is your favorite among all?\n\nDo you think Akanksha Singh is the right choice for best TV personality 2012?\n\nThere is no hidden fact that TV actors enjoy a great fan following and people adore them wholeheartedly. Now as year 2012 is gone and everyone is busy finding out as to which TV star (female) stood as the best throughout the year. Surprisingly, Akanksha Singh of Colors’ Na Bole Tum Na Maine Kuch Kaha has stood as the best TV personality of 2012 defeating the much popular Sanaya Irani aka Khushi from Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon. Do you favor this result? Is Akanksha truly the best TV personality for 2012?\n\nDo you think Harshad Chopra can make a good pair with Sanaya Irani on small screen?\n\nTelevision heartthrob Harshad Chopra has won many female hearts given his chocolate boy looks with a masculine touch. He has worked with many pretty gals like Additi Gupta ( Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil), Anupriya Kapoor (Tere Liye), Aasiya Kazi (Dharampatni) and Sriti Jha (Saubhagyavati Bhav). If given a chance, do you think he can make a great pair on screen with Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon fame Sanaya Irani? Do they click together? Do you like them on screen couple?\n\nWill Ram Kapoor’s weight loss mission add more to the show’s popularity?\n\nRam Kapoor who plays the lead role in Sony TV’s Bade Acche Lagte Hain has easily got on the top notch. People love him the way he is. However, he is soon to start the on screen weight losing mission. There is no doubt that fit stars ruling the small screen. Will this add more to the show’s popularity?\n\nDo you think Michelle Obama will prove to be the next chat show queen?\n\nAs reported that First Lady of United States, Michelle Obama might step into a new career as a talk show host if her husband president Barrack Obama loses the election. She has even been compared to powerful woman Oprah Winfrey, the queen of chat show hosts and one of the most recognizable names in show business. Do you think Michelle can prove her mettle as a chat show host?\n\nWill Smriti Irani be successful as a crime fighter?\n\nReturning on small screen after a hiatus doesn’t always bring success to TV actors. It is indeed a gamble and is ruled by TRPs. TV actors are mostly known by the character they play and a switch from fiction to non-fiction calls for great risk. As reported that TV’s favorite bahu Tusli (Smriti Irani) of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi is to return with Life OK’s Savdhaan India. Do you think she will stand successful? Will she get good response by audience?"
