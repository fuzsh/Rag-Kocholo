        "text": "In Actors and the show that placed them in the BIG LEAGUE'; Telly Tadka brings you some of the superstars of TV-pur and the shows that made them the star they are today\n\nWords would fail to describe this lovely actress. Sanaya who debuted with YRF's Fanaa is nothing in short of a National Sensation today. With a strong and huge fan Indian and Int'l fan it wouldn't be wrong to say that Sanaya Irani is undoubtedly one of the reigning queens of the Television Industry today.\n\nThough Sanaya Irani did several shows both fictional and reality, including the very famous youth drama Miley Jab Hum Tum (Star One) where she gained more prominence; the show that placed Sanaya in the big league is Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon' - One of biggest and most popular romantic saga the country has ever seen.\n\nSanaya's stunning portrayal of Khushi Kumari Gupta Singh Raizada helped her win the hearts of millions around the globe and made Sanaya Irani a hot favorite in no time. As a simple girl who loves simple things in life Khushi was not only an enigma to Arnav Singh Raizada but also to the viewers.\n\nThe ease with which Sanaya got into the skin of the character and lived it to the fullest left the audience wanting more. When Khushi laughed the audience wanted to laugh with her, when she cried they wanted to be there for her, pani puri and jalebi's never appeared more tempting ever and love never looked more beautiful and real in a fictional show as it did in IPKKND and there is only one person who made it possible- Sanaya Irani.\n\nEver wondered what would have happened if the producer who was advised Don't consider Sanaya for the role of Khushi Kumar Gupta' had decided not to watch Sanaya's audition tape which made its way into the Rejected Category'?\n\nA famous celebrity once said that \"An actor does not choose a role but a role chooses the actor\". Looks like Sanaya was always meant to play Khushi and we love her for that.\n\nAuthor: Vijitha Rajan\n\nTelly Tadka\n\nhttp://www.telly tadka.net/actors-show-placed-big-league-5-sanaya-irani/"
