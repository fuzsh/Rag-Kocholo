        "text": "It's not the age-old love-hate premise of the show that entices you in the first place. It's not even the enthralling beauty visible in every frame and discourse that's not only aesthetically pleasing but also innovative in its own way. It's the beautifully presented take on relationships that forces you to be a part of Arnav and Khushi's never ending spats, their inexplicable and undeniable attraction towards one another that makes you sit back in awe and lets you appreciate the fact that even the unlikeliest people can do wonders when they fall in love. Arnav Singh Raizada is like a sea shell. Tough, unyielding and unmistakeably beautiful. He is egoistic, unabashedly arrogant and taciturn. He attributes his success to no one. He can be ruthless, unemotional, cunning, brilliant all at the same time. Yet it's not unless you place your ear close to the shell that you realize how many secrets it hides. Arnav has created impenetrable physical and emotional boundaries around himself. His elder sister Anjali, who has been his sole companion through thick and thin (their parents died when Arnav was about eleven and their uncle threw them out of their house) is the only person who knows him inside out. Both share an immeasurably deep bond. Khushi is nothing short of a storm in Arnav's apparently calm and controlled life. Her effervescence, enthusiasm and love for life is completely at odds with Arnav's. She's a born trouble-maker; even her in-deliberate actions sometimes spell trouble for her and people around her. Yet she's full of love and compassion, always ready to help others and despite her loud and colorful exterior, in essence she's a simple and humble person. What happens when two lightnings strike each other? Sparks fly. A classic tale of opposites attract, Arnav and Khushi are a stark contrast in every possible way. Arnav is a diabetic- not only is he allergic to sugar, he's allergic to attraction and love as well. Khushi is born in a family of sweet-makers. Arnav is stubbornly taciturn and inexpressive, Khushi is a complete chatter-box. Arnav's doesn't like changes - even his black and white clothes reflect his control-freak attitude. Khushi is like a walking rainbow - from clothes to handbags to shoes. Khushi blasts Arnav's ego from Day One. And despite trying hard not to, both of them are fascinated by each other. Harder they try to be apart from each other, more the situations pull them closer. Khushi discovers facets of Arnav that no one knows. The pain and insecurity due to his troubled past that has made him so hard to figure out. The love that he bestows on people when he wants to. However, each time they come too close, a big misunderstanding erupts and yanks them apart. The day Arnav realizes his love for Khushi, he also discovers a terrible secret. His brother-in-law Shyam (Anjali's husband) is in love with Khushi. Due to a series of miscommunication and misunderstandings, Arnav is driven to a conclusion that Khushi and Shyam were having an affair behind everyone's back. He's broken by disappointment and betrayal. To seek revenge as well as to save his sister's marriage, he forces Khushi into a six-month contract marriage. More misunderstandings follow. Both are torn between love and hatred for each other. Though the plot isn't new, the unique narration - romance sprinkled with spicy humor is delightful and pleasant. Their fights are adorable, their romance is delectable and their pain tugs at your heart. Beside excellent presentation, the awesome acting prowess of the lead as well as supporting actors and the unmistakeably crackling on-screen chemistry of the protagonists are some of the many factors which make this show rock not only in India but throughout the world. After a long time, some quality entertainment with predictable but palatable twists that sweep you off your feet.\n\nThat's IPKKND for you."
