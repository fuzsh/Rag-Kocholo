(¬‿¬)\n\nThe Shadow Beneath the Light\n\n[Part 1 of 3 ]\n\nWen Qing - Wen Huiyang 回阳 - the new Sect Master of Qishan Wen was an orphan, the people said. Her parents died young, killed by an evil statue spirit at Dafan mountain, after which she and her brother Wen Ning were brought to be raised at Nevernight along side Wen Ruohan’s own sons. Wen Ruohan praised her for her quick wit and calm demeanor and recognized her potential as a cultivator. Wen Qing was deadlier than Wen Chao with sword, and more eloquent than Wen Xu with a brush, but she was unambitious and taciturn and preferred the steady workflow of medicine, which Wen Ruohan indulged and allowed her to pursue.\n\nHe never referred to her as Wen Huiyang, only Wen Qing, like an un-grown child, and he never saw either her or her brother Wen Ning as a threat to his rule.\n\nThis was his firm belief, right up until Wen Qing’s sword pierced his heart and severed his head from his neck.\n\nBy the time the Nies, the Lans, a small group of Jins and a throng of minor clansmen stormed Nevernight, well, Wen Huiyang had already torn down her predecessor’s throne and was waiting for them with the 1000 Wen disciples who bowed to her rule.\n\nWhen the great sects assembled, Wen Qing had taken Wen Ruohan’s three pieces of the Yin Iron and led a cautious Lan Xichen, a suspicious Nie Mingjue and a chagrined Jin Guangshan to Xue Chonghai’s desolated palace in Yiling. There, she proposed the only solution she could think of which would be acceptable to all parties. As the irons themselves could not be destroyed by the likes of them and Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen were both uncomfortable with the idea of taking guardianship of one such pieces, they must be sealed away by blood (something she learned from Wen Ruohan): a seal that is forged with a drop from each of them and so could only be broken by blood from all of them. A mutual guarantee.\n\n“It’s unfortunate,” said Wen Qing as she cast a knowing look to Jin Guangshan. Without evidence she could not blatantly accuse him, but he would be wise not to move against her. “That the fourth piece remains missing. This would be a perfect opportunity to lock away them all. If you find Xue Yang, please remember to search him for the remaining piece.”\n\n“Unfortunate indeed,” replied Jin Guangshan, face hard and eyes cold.\n\nWen Ruohan had been defeated, the Yin Iron subdued. There will be no war, declared Wen Qing, and so the Sunshot Campaign ended before it could really begin.\n\nBut what of the 300 Wen disciples who fled, demanded the Nies. Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu were still at large.\n\nAnd that… well that was where the real problems started, though technically it was no longer Wen Qing’s problem. After the hostility towards Qishan had been dosed by Wen Qing’s cold and swift overtake of the situation, she planned to close the borders of her land and reorganize the sect that was now hers. Her plans for the outside world were two fold. On one hand she sent men and resources to Cloud Recesses to help them rebuild with explicit instructions to be courteous and genuine and make it known nothing was expected in return. On the other, she delegated her team of healers to go to Qinghe. Wen Qing’s one true passion had never deviated from medicine, and she particularly had a fascination for the strange and unusual. If she could solve Qinghe Nie’s tendency to qi deviate, then surely the animosity between their families would be a thing of the past. What the rest of the cultivators wanted to do with her cousin Wen Chao and his followers was no business of hers.\n\nEverything proceeded according to plan. That is, until the Jiangs reappeared\n\nSpecifically, three Jiangs: Jiang Yanli, Wei Wuxian and Jiang Wanyin, seemingly rising from the dead and raising the dead in their wake.\n\nWen Qing recalled meeting them at Cloud Recesses, and had even helped them and Hanguang-jun when they encountered that stone fairy in Dafan (which was incidentally how she regained her childhood memory and details surrounding her parents’ death which she had not thought of prior). Wen Qing had found Jiang Yanli beautiful, and found her brother Jiang Wanyin even more so, but that was the last she’d seen of the beautiful family. She heard from the Wen disciples that after Lotus Pier had been sacked, the Jiang boys had had their cores melted and along with their poor sister were tossed into the Burial Mount.\n\nAll assumed the Jiangs had perished, their lineage exterminated. All were mistaken.\n\nEnshrouded in smoke with vengeance-tainted eyes of red, the Jiang children bathed Yiling and Yunmeng’s supervisory offices in blood. Not one of the three hundred Wen disciples who fought under Wen Chao’s flag were left alive or in one piece. Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu’s corpses were especially butchered, so much so that they were barely recognizable.\n\nSuddenly, the eyes and weariness of the public turned to new threats.\n\nBut Wen Qing turned away, for she knew what would come next. With not one spiritual cultivator remaining, Lotus Pier was devoid of leadership and an able body to carry on their ancestral teachings. While the Nies and Lans still recuperated from their extensive damage, two equally-measured powerhouses loomed over the bountiful and beautiful Yunmeng. Qishan was vast and self-sufficient; Wen Qing had no need nor desire to take advantage of others’ tragic loss to annex new lands for her sect. She would not lead her clan into a new age with rewards reaped through such underhanded methods.\n\nThe Jins and their subsidiaries however, true to their merchant origins, practically salivated. It was in a way disgusting. Only Jin Zixuan seemed embarrassed by his clansmen’s behaviour, though to expect him to stand up to his father was a fool’s hope.\n\nIn early spring, Wen Qing’s disciples brought her news from the outside world. Jin Guangshan had intended to renew Jiang Yanli’s marriage with Jin Zixuan but was refused by the lady. If Wen Qing were to wager (she wasn’t the betting type, but she enjoyed a good show when it presented itself) Jin Zixuan much preferred that right hand woman of his - Luo Qingyang. Mianmian’s sweetness and fierceness had caught even Wen Qing’s eye when she’d been sent to Gusu to spy for Wen Ruohan. It’s too bad that the Jin disciple preferred boys.\n\nHm.\n\nA month later, her disciples reported that Jin Zixun had been cursed to death by Wei Wuxian via The Thousand Punctures technique. An insidious and vicious curse, an awful death, not…something she thought Wei Wuxian capable of, though of course she could be wrong.\n\nHm.\n\nThey tried to persecute him. Wei Wuxian fought back, which would’ve turned ugly had Wen Qing not discreetly sent a medical text to Zewu-jun and Chifeng-zun detailing the type of reflexive marks the curse would have left on the caster’s body. Wei Wuxian’s body bore no such evidence.\n\nThe Jiangs may not be evil casters, but their demonic cultivation left its mark on them nonetheless. They were all ill, gravely so, and Wen Qing - who swore she would not mingle in others’ business - reached out with a scholar’s curiosity and a physician’s good will. She was, after all, perhaps the only doctor under the sun who could even come close to tempering their particular condition.\n\nWei Wuxian, the strongest of the them three, didn’t trust her, but Jiang Yanli was the sickest and Jiang Cheng, whose gaze always lingered a little too long on Wen Qing at Cloud Recesses, made a leap of faith.\n\nIn this universe, Wen Qing might not have committed the egregious sin of operating on a non-consenting patient, but the fact that both Jiang Yanli and Jiang Wanyin subsequently ended up in her bed (not at the same time, you scoundrels, she’s not that depraved no matter what the rumours spread) is also wildly unprofessional, if not unethical.\n\nWen Qing wasn’t exactly sure if the Jiangs had plotted secretly to invade her life, or if folks from Yunmeng were all born naturally attractive to a fault, but ultimately she was a victim to their river clan ways.\n\nOh well, it can’t be helped. Wen Qing emerged from Jiang Yanli’s room one morning after a week of alternating company between the oldest and youngest Jiang and was struck by a sudden realization. As all honorable sect masters should, now that she has bedded them, the reasonable next step would be to wed them…right?\n\nThe Jiangs were good people, though marred by trauma and loss they were. Wen Qing saw the souls that still shined underneath their dark clouds of smoke, and she knew only Qishan would be able to offer them solace and help them maintain Yunmeng’s regional independence from Lanling’s ambitions. It seemed ironic, after all that’s happened.\n\nSo she offered, as was her duty, bearing in mind that if they refused, that was their right.\n\nExcept they didn’t refuse. Jiang Yanli had blushed and cried as if Wen Qing’s curt “I would like to honour you as my partner in life” had been the world’s grandest romantic gesture. Jiang Wanyin had picked her up and laughed for the first time since… well …since.\n\nTheir only condition, once they ushered her to sit between them, was to accept their dearest brother Wei Wuxian as well, because they swore after everything that’s happened, they would always be together.\n\nNothing was expected of him that he did not wish, Wen Qing explained to the third Jiang. “You are a free man, Wei Wuxian. You may go if you wish, but as long as you stay in Qishan you shall always be under my protection, marriage or not.”\n\nWei Wuxian agreed readily, desperate to stick together to the only families he’s got left. “Besides”, he shrugged twirling Chenqing between his fingers. “Where would I go? Who would have me now?”\n\nIt was not ideal that nothing sparked between Wei Wuxian and herself, but they respected and grew to trust each other. Many marriages these days were built on less (Jin Zixuan was due to marry a girl from Laoling Qin, according to Wen Qing’s intelligence sources. Huh).\n\nThus, Wen Qing set out to treat Wei Wuxian kindly, and in the future…who knows? If he wanted, she was not opposed to giving him a child in addition to the ones she would definitely be making with the Jiang Cheng. Wen Qing wasn’t particularly motherly, but heirs were heirs and she needed them and so did Jiang Wanyin. Not to mention Jiang Yanli explicitly requested (demanded) babies to spoil. Wei Wuxian seemed to like children as well and would be a good father, judging from the way he took to Wen Yuan right away.\n\nIt could work, decided Wen Qing. Yes it could. Even A-Ning thought so; he was so excited to get an expansion to the family.\n\n… though in hindsight, she really ought to have remembered Lan Wangji’s death glare of sexual frustration from their school days.\n\nWhen Lan Xichen’s letter arrived on her desk two months after Wen Qing quietly established her harem, she realized this was going to be a problem."
