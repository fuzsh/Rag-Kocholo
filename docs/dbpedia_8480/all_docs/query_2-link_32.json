        "text": "I think Wen Xu is a very pro-active and loyal member of the Qishan Wen, Anon!\n\nJust to get it out of the way up front: I do not believe Wen Chao was being groomed to be the next sect leader. I think he was being trained for a leadership and management role suiting a child of the Qishan Wen clan. The first time we meet him, he is a junior who is organizing the juniors of the Qishan Wen for an archery event that only allows juniors to participate. When he heads the indoctrination camp, he is a junior who has been given a role of authority over his junior cohort. (It is basically Lord of the Flies and Wen Chao has the conch lol) When he goes to Lotus Pier, we know that he is not the only member of the Qishan Wen to be sent out to establish a supervisory office considering Wen Qing has taken over Yiling.\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve seen around, a lot of people forget Wen Chao is a junior and thus the popular opinion is that he is coddled and made front-and-center because he is more important than Wen Xu. But that doesn‚Äôt seem right to me. Babies just get more coddling than older children lol Wen Xu is out in the world taking care of business because he is an adult while Wen Chao stays closer to home under the watchful eye of adults. It‚Äôs only when Wen Chao ‚Äúproves‚Äù himself at the indoctrination camp and kills the tortoise of slaughter (who is going to tell Wen RuoHan that he lied? nobody) that he‚Äôs sent on his first mission to Lotus Pier, which he messes up immediately and spectacularly by delegating the meet-and-greet to his very vengeful mistress. Wen Xu at least handled Cloud Recesses beautifully (what happens matches with what he reportedly announced he came to do) before finally meeting disaster with the Qinghe Nie.\n\nTheory 1: Wen Xu could be the son of a concubine or mistress! But I don‚Äôt think who Wen Xu‚Äôs mother is would make a difference? A child of Wen RuoHan is a child of Sect Leader Wen, and Wen RuoHan is NOT Jin GuangShan (I beg everyone to say that last part with me until it sinks it lol). Wen ZhuLiu shows us that heritage and blood-lines aren‚Äôt actually all that important to Wen RuoHan when it comes to what makes a family, otherwise he would still be Zhao ZhuLiu. Wen Xu is also plainly identified in canon as Wen RuoHan‚Äôs eldest son with no other side remark. The rest of the cultivation world freely call them Wen-dogs, so if Wen Xu was anything less than whatever he was supposed to be, I‚Äôm sure people would have jumped on it.\n\nMore so, that other people in canon talk about how they hope Wen Qing will take over the Wen Sect and how Wen RuoHan does not do things normally actually suggests, to me, that Wen RuoHan wouldn‚Äôt feel all that contained by which child was born to which wife per tradition. There are work-arounds anyway. Wen Chao has a servant for a mistress, which looks questionable, so how do they fix that? They give Wang LingJiao her own clan and raise her status. Wen Xu is Wen RuoHan‚Äôs oldest son. By all means he‚Äôs a loyal and hardworking son, so he‚Äôs going to be heir as he deserves.\n\nPerhaps if Wen Chao was more competent and his cultivation higher, maybe he could challenge the position for heir? Just like outsiders want Wen Qing to do so? But for now, I don‚Äôt see any reason why the heir wouldn‚Äôt be Wen Xu.\n\nTheory 2: I disagree. Although if the things Wen Xu was interested in include doing big Wen Sect things and reinforcing Qishan Wen dominance, then I do agree! We don‚Äôt see Wen Xu at home because he‚Äôs the older brother. He has already done all the stuff we see Wen Chao practicing how to do. It‚Äôs similar to how Lan WangJi was at the Cloud Recesses school while Lan XiChen was off in the Unclean Realm at first, helping Nie MingJue prepare for the discussion conference. Wen Xu isn‚Äôt a sect leader yet, so he still has the ability to roam and throw his weight around.\n\nWen Xu does exactly what he was arguably meant to do at Cloud Recesses and injuring Lan WangJi was because Lan WangJi was getting in the way of his work. Like it‚Äôs weird to say, but Wen Xu ordering his men to break Lan WangJi‚Äôs leg wasn‚Äôt personal. It was strictly business. Wen RuoHan and Wen Xu, of what little we see of them, both possess a composure and maturity that keeps them from going overboard with an excessive use of power. Sadly, Wen Chao lacks that sense and restraint, which is why he shouldn‚Äôt have been let lose into the world in the first place‚Ä¶!\n\nAlthough Wen Xu might actually have been too diligent in his work considering he went to Hejian later. We know that had to have been his own decision considering Wen RuoHan told everyone to, basically, just leave Nie MingJue and the Unclean Realm alone. But Wen Xu ran over there anyway, possibly hoping to take advantage of what the Wens presumed was overconfidence of the Sunshot Campaign. It should have been an easy win in that case, but instead he ended up biting off more than he could chew.\n\n(Maybe he should have listened to his father??)\n\nTheory 3: I‚Äôm feeling like a broken record at this point (lol) but I do not believe there is evidence that any Wen had a strained relationship with Wen RuoHan. That is to say no Wen ever accuses Wen RuoHan of being cruel or difficult or threatening or domineering. Wen Qing is proof that Wen RuoHan doesn‚Äôt give out unreasonable orders, lest she would have thrown in the towel long ago.\n\nCould Wen Xu have issues with Wen RuoHan for other, personal reasons? Yeah, of course. Look at Lan WangJi who makes Lan QiRen pull his hair out later over breaking the rules. Look at Jiang FengMian, who just neglects what any of his kids wants and makes decisions for them without asking. Considering how Wen RuoHan treats Meng Yao, however, that whole ‚Äúdo as you please‚Äù fits perfectly with Wen RuoHan‚Äôs personality and the behavior of all the rest of the Wen kids. They are all obedient to the sect but, at the end of the day, they really do as they please‚Äìand end up either starting a war or getting their head cut off.\n\nWen Xu not getting along with the other members of his family is more possible considering how both Wen Qing and Wen ZhuLiu explicitly do not like Wen Chao. Would having an annoying little brother who has an even more annoying mistress keep Wen Xu out of the house? Yes, that‚Äôs likely! lol\n\nBut I do think Wen Xu was simply absent because, as I said, he was off doing Big Important Wen Sect Business out in the world. Like not only did he deal with Cloud Recesses and try to deal with the Qinghe Nie, I suspect Wen Xu might have been our guy who pushed the waterborne abyss towards Caiyi Town, amongst other things. He is in the background keeping the region around Qishan clean and the sects outside of Qishan on their toes.\n\nNonetheless, I do like him as an antagonist and as a part of the Wen family!"
