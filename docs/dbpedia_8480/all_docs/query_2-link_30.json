        "text": "Umm‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs a goof. It‚Äôs my goof üòÖ üôè. I meant to type Wen Zhuliu but made a typo and typed Wen Zhuli instead. Sorry if I gave you the wrong idea!\n\nHow about I write out what I know about Wen/Zhao Zhuliu instead?\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the name!\n\n1. The ancient, obscure meaning of a fairly common surname:\n\nWen Zhuliu‚Äôs birthname is Zhao Zhuliu ËµµÈÄêÊµÅ. Zhao Ëµµ is a common Chinese surname. This is what most people would know it as. However, according to the Kangxi Dictionary (1716), Zhao Ëµµ also means ‚Äòto repay.‚Äô The Kangxi Dictionary attributes this ancient meaning to a specific legend in the Yunbu, an even older Song dynasty text published in the 12th century. This specific legend in the Yunbu is about Qi Huayi repaying Zhao (the kingdom) by giving Zhao the territories of Ganluo and Tongya. The legend is from a pre-Qin era (so in the BCE).\n\nIn other words, the Zhao surname is a discrete nod to Wen Zhuliu character being defined by his ‚Äòdebt‚Äô to Wen Ruohan and his life as Wen Zhuliu being all about repaying Wen Ruohan‚Äôs ‚Äòwen‚Äô to him to the point of death.\n\nJust like Qin Huayi repaying his debt by slicing off long-held territories and giving it to Zhao. Zhao Zhuliu gave up his own life and fate to the Wen, Wen Ruohan specifically, to repay his debt.\n\n2. The name that signifies how out of place the person is:\n\nZhuliu ÈÄêÊµÅ means ‚Äòracing current‚Äô or ‚Äòchasing current.‚Äô\n\nBut liu ÊµÅ is also used to denote a ‚Äòclass of people,‚Äô or ‚Äògrades of people.‚Äô Words like Shangliu ‰∏äÊµÅ literally mean the upper echelon / upper class. And ‚ÄòZhu‚Äô can also denote ‚Äòseparate‚Äô or ‚Äòseparated,‚Äô or ‚Äòexiled.‚Äô\n\nSo Zhuliu ÈÄêÊµÅ can also be understood as a ‚ÄòClass of itself,‚Äô or ‚Äòseparated from the rest.‚Äô\n\nZhuliu ÈÄêÊµÅ reflects Wen Zhuliu‚Äôs situation among the Wen, separated from the rest and a class of himself. Wen Ruohan bestowed the surname Wen on him. This should be an incredibly high honor, especially in this particular time period. It is an act that symbolically adopts and accepts Zhao Zhuli as kin, as blood, as inseparable relation. And yet Wen Zhuliu is effectively treated as a servant by the Wens around him.\n\nHe has no official authority of himself. He is neither retainer ÂÆ¢Âçø (Keqing, a retainer can carry out missions, act in a House‚Äôs interest, and get a monthly payment and all sorts of benefits of being a member of a House, but has no power to decide a House policy. Su She, after being banished from House Lan, spent some time as a low-ranking retainer of House Jin. Mian Mian also worked to become a low-ranking retainer of House Jin before rejecting the actions of House Jin, taking off her House robes and abandoning her status as a retainer of Jin), nor elder ÈïøËÄÅ (Zhanglao, an instated member of a House whose seniority or accomplishment allows him to become Zhanglao, and thus gains a say in a House policy and all sorts of diplomatic relations).\n\nThis confusion of Wen Zhuliu‚Äôs official position among the Wen is most glaring in his interaction with Wang Lingjiao. Wang Lingjiao may be Wen Chao‚Äôs favorite mistress. However, her official position is still either a female servant (as she was first introduced in the novel as Wen Chao‚Äôs wife‚Äôs handmaiden/close servant), or at most a mistress (not even a concubine as the concubine position requires specific rites not dissimilar to a kind of wedding to be carried out). If Wen Zhuliu had any actual official position beyond ‚Äòhonorary Wen,‚Äô then Wang Lingjiao wouldn‚Äôt be able to just boss him around like that. Because the official position in a House is not something even the second young master of the House can disrespect without serious repercussion.\n\nIn terms of ability and personal integrity, Wen Zhuliu is also in a class of himself, especially when compared to Wen Chao and the bootlickers he surrounded himself with. Wen Zhuliu never once insulted another person for their background or social station. Wen Zhuliu also protested and refused to desecrate Yu Furen‚Äôs corpse, very much against Wen Chao‚Äôs order. During the Jiang massacre, he very obviously did not want to go through with it, going so far as to apologize to Yu Furen for his having to face her this way at all.\n\nConsidering the Jiang massacre probably wasn‚Äôt even in the Wen‚Äôs original plan in the first place, and only happened because Yu Furen decided her ego was bigger than the lives of everyone else in House Jiang, down to young disciples not even 10 years old. Had the Wen truly wanted to wipe the Jiang out, Jiang Fengmian (who went to House Wen to ask for the swords back right before the massacre) wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get back to Lianhuawu in the first place. Wen Zhuliu probably wanted nothing to do with the whole ordeal and only went through with it because Wen Ruohan ordered him to take care of Wen Chao.\n\n3. About Wen Ruohan Ê∏©Ëã•ÂØí:\n\nIf you are going to write extensively about Wen Zhuliu, then you probably will want to know about Wen Ruohan as well. As I said before, MXTX character names tend to foreshadow or hint about certain things in their characters, their positions, or their story arc. Wen Ruohan is no exception.\n\nThe word Han ÂØí signifies his status as the last leader of House Wen. Why? It‚Äôs all to do with heat.\n\nThe surname Wen Ê∏© means ‚ÄòWarm,‚Äô or ‚ÄòWarmth.‚Äô Yet the name Han ÂØí means ‚Äòfreezing.‚Äô So Wen Ruohan can be understood as ‚Äòwarm like freezing.‚Äô In modern Chinese slang, cold also means ‚Äòdead.‚Äô So saying things like I‚Äôm going cold, or it‚Äôs cold, are also ways to say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm dead,‚Äô I‚Äôm dying,‚Äô ‚ÄòHe/she is dead.‚Äô\n\nThe middle part of the name Ruo Ëã• is also very interesting, because while it can be understood as ‚ÄòAs,‚Äô or ‚Äòlike,‚Äô the ancient meaning of Ruo is ‚Äògod.‚Äô Specifically, Ruo is the name of a sea god in Zhuangzi (5th century BCE), one of the oldest and founding classical texts of Chinese culture and Daoism. In Zhuangzi, it is said that there is a sea god in the North named Ruo. One day, after a particular incident, Ruo said: ‚ÄúYou cannot speak to a toad stuck at the bottom of a dry well of the vastness of the ocean.‚Äù\n\nSo the word Ruo in Wen Ruohan‚Äôs name is another discrete nod to the character‚Äôs status in relation to those surrounding him, that as a god who has much better foresight and vision. When you really look into the details of the novel, you will find Wen Ruohan really did tower over the rest of the cultivation world not only in terms of power (he was the strongest cultivator in the cultivation world) but also in vision. His plan to unite the cultivation world and lay down actual laws and rules of conduct is eventually enacted and seen as necessary and natural to the development of the cultivation world. His plan to build Supervisory Offices ended up being plagiarized by Jin Guangyao and given a different name (Far-seeing Towers). In the novel, Jin Guangyao won high praise from regular people, other Houses, and even Wei Wuxian (after resurrection) for the Far-seeing Towers. You can say that if it weren‚Äôt for the other Wens (specifically Wen Ruohan‚Äôs own sons) being morons in executing his plan, and for the existence of Wei Ying (who was effectively an entire army during the Sunshot War), then Wen Ruohan would have had a very different ending.\n\n4. Other Miscellaneous things:\n\nSince you want to write a story about Zhao/Wen Zhuliu, you can dig further into history, particularly the Zhao Kingdom, which was one of the seven Kingdoms of the Warring State Period. Zhao and Wei were historical peers, as they both belonged to the same seven kingdoms and were embroiled in the same events of the period. (You can check my post on the historical basis for WWX for that)\n\nAnother avenue would be‚Ä¶ to look at Wei Ying himself. Because Wen/Zhao Zhuliu is a mirror image of Wei Ying, especially in Wei Ying‚Äôs first life. I haven‚Äôt really dug deep into the history and genealogy of the Zhao Kingdom, but I‚Äôm not gonna be surprised if there‚Äôs an actual historical basis for Zhao/Wen Zhuliu in there, the same way there is a historical basis for Wei Ying."
