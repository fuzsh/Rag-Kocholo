        "text": "Very few are confirmed in-text. The rest must be inferred based on the events of the story. Ages are more commonly given for past events, so maybe when we have the entire story revealed it will become clearer.\n\nThe senior-junior dynamics are fairly straightforward in this story and mostly go by age. For example, Lan Sizhui calls Mo Xuanyu/Wei Wuxian (who is in his mid 20s) “Senior” because Sizhui himself is under 20.\n\nFor now, here’s what we know:\n\nYounger Cast Members\n\nAll under 20 years old.\n\nJin Ling: The only confirmed one in the present timeline. He is 14 at the start of the story, but closer to 15. By the time the Discussion Conference at the Lanling Jin Sect starts, he is already 15.\n\nLan Sizhui: He is at least 16 when the story starts. Early chapters confirm that he is older than Jin Ling and flashback chapters will confirm how old he was when Wei Wuxian died.\n\nLan Jingyi: He is around Sizhui’s age.\n\nMo Ziyuan: At least 17 when he dies.\n\nA-Qing: She is fairly young, but I don’t remember her approximate age.\n\nOlder Cast Members\n\nEveryone around Wei Wuxian’s generation.\n\nJiang Cheng, Lan Wangji, and Nie Huaisang are probably in their early thirties when the story starts.\n\nWei Wuxian: He was 5 when his parents died, 9 when Jiang Fengmian picked him up and brought him home. He was 15 when they went to the Cloud Recesses and 17 during the “Poisons” arc. He is confirmed to be older than Jiang Cheng as well as the eldest disciple of the Jiang clan when he was a member (not that important for this story, but technically the eldest disciple can be chronologically younger than the others if he/she became a disciple first).\n\nMo Xuanyu: full explanation with in-text citations here. He is about 24, give or take a few years. (Mo Xuanyu’s mother was 16 when she gave birth to him.)\n\nJiang Cheng: He is slightly younger than Wei Wuxian. When Wei Wuxian came to live with the Jiang clan, Jiang Cheng was 8 or 9 - the text doesn’t specify which. When they go to the Cloud Recesses, Jiang Cheng is 15. During the “Poisons” arc, Jiang Cheng is 17.\n\nLan Wangji: In the Cloud Recesses flashback, Nie Huaisang says that he is the same age as Wei Wuxian and himself, which would be 15. Wei Wuxian calls him Wangji-xiong at some point, so this probably means he is older than Wei Wuxian by a bit.\n\nNie Huaisang: In the Cloud Recesses flashback, is around the same age as Wei Wuxian, which is 15.\n\nJin Zixuan: In the Cloud Recesses flashback, he could be 15 or 16, since the narrative says that the young masters who went to study there ranged from 15 to 16.\n\nLan Xichen: Lan Wangji’s older brother. I dunno by how many years though.\n\nJin Guangyao, Nie Mingjue: They are around Lan Xichen’s age. I don’t remember if the novel states who is older amongst the three.\n\nJin Guangyao’s wife Qin Su was around his age, I believe.\n\nJiang Yanli: She was older than Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng.\n\nWen Qing & Wen Ning: Wen Qing is Wen Ning’s older sister.\n\nWen Xu & Wen Chao: I assume they’re in this relative age range. Wen Xu is the older brother, Wen Chao is the younger.\n\nUnknown, but probably in this range: Mianmian, Wang Lingjiao\n\nEven Older Cast Members\n\nMooost of these are dead but they are all older than the above. In no particular order because I’m not sure of their relative ages.\n\nLan Qiren, Cangse Sanren, Wei Changze, Jiang Fengmian, Yu Ziyuan, her maids Jinzhu and Yinzhu, Jin Guangshan, Nie Mingjue’s father, Wen Ruohan, Qingheng-jun (Lan Wangji & Lan Xichen’s father, Lan Qiren’s older brother)\n\nBaoshan Sanren is older than the rest.\n\nYi City Peoples\n\nThis arc confused me so here is what we know:\n\nXiao Xingchen: Was 17 when he left Baoshan Sanren’s mountain. He was 18 when the whole Chang clan massacre and Xue Yang business happened. And probably in his early twenties when he died, it’s never confirmed just how many years he lived with Xue Yang and A-Qing, just “a few”. Song Lan was probably around Xiao Xingchen’s age."
