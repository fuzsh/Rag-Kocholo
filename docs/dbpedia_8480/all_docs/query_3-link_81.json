        "text": "Wen Chao Chen was a remarkable leader, a skilled strategist who worked behind the scenes for the benefit of Kalamazoo. A true local statesman, he stayed out of the public spotlight, at first because he felt Kalamazoo was not ready for a Chinese leader. Clearly, Kalamazoo has changed since Chen's early days in the city.\n\nI grew in Kalamazoo and graduated with the Kalamazoo College class of 1965, and I benefited from his mentoring as a student at Kalamazoo College and throughout my adult life. He and his wife Lilia warmly welcomed my family â€” though my young son was stunned when Chen beat him at table tennis, many years ago. Kalamazoo is so fortunate to have had Chen's dedicated leadership.\n\nELLEN COLINGSWORTH/Leven, Scotland\n\nFor more Kalamazoo Gazette opinion pieces and letters visit\n\n."
