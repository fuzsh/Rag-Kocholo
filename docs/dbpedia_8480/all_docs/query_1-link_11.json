        "text": "Wang Lingjiao (王灵娇, Wáng Língjiāo) is the mistress of Wen Chao.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nWang Lingjiao is described as glamorous in appearance, with a slim stature, long brows, large eyes, and lips of fiery red. Her only blemish is a black mole above her upper lip.[1]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWang Lingjiao is arrogant and seems to enjoy commanding others, as she frequently insists that servants need to know their place despite being a servant herself.[1] She makes up words due to her own poor education.[2]\n\nShe is petty enough to request Wei Wuxian's hand be cut off as revenge for his role in the scuffle in the cave of the Xuanwu of Slaughter,[2] and carefully guards her status as Wen Chao's favorite, taking actions to eliminate any perceived competition.[3]\n\nWang Lingjiao is also somewhat romantic and idealistic, as she originally believed that she could capture the promiscuous Wen Chao's heart forever. In the final days of her life, however, she faces the reality that he does not love her and makes plans to leave him behind.[4]\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigins[]\n\nWang Lingjiao originally arrives in Nightless City as a servant of Wen Chao's principal wife. Her beauty presumably attracts the lecherous Wen Chao's attention, and they begin an affair at the encouragement of her lady. As a result of their relationship, her family is allowed to form their own clan, the Yingchuan Wang Clan.[3]\n\nXuanwu of Slaughter[]\n\nWang Lingjiao accompanies Wen Chao as he leads the Qishan Wen Clan's indoctrination of other clans' disciples. She notes with loathing that her lover has begun to harass the beautiful Mianmian. Once Wen Chao suggests that someone be strung up and bled as bait for the Xuanwu of Slaughter, Wang Lingjiao suggests Mianmian to eliminate her competition.[3]\n\nAfter a fight breaks out when Lan Wangji and Jin Zixuan defend Mianmian, Wang Lingjiao manages to find the other woman and orders two Qishan Wen servants to hold her down while a third servant brands her face. Mianmian is saved at the last moment by Wei Wuxian, who pushes Wang Lingjiao away and takes the brand to his chest instead. Jiang Cheng attempts to strike her, but Wen Zhuliu saves her. Wang Lingjiao, Wen Chao, and the other Wen cultivators then escape and trap the rest of the trainees in the cave with the Xuanwu of Slaughter.[5]\n\nMassacre of Lotus Pier[]\n\nOnce Wen Ruohan orders Supervisory Offices set up in all the cities of the cultivation world, Wang Lingjiao targets Lotus Pier due to her continued grudge against Wei Wuxian. She immediately arrests the Sixth Shidi of Lotus Pier, claiming that the kite he shot down represents the Qishan Wen Clan due to a red circle that barely resembles their sun motif.[2]\n\nWang Lingjiao then informs Yu Ziyuan that Wei Wuxian should be punished for his actions in the cave, prompting Yu Ziyuan to whip Wei Wuxian with Zidian to pacify the Qishan Wen Clan. However, Wang Lingjiao is unsatisfied with a whipping, requesting that Yu Ziyuan permanently maim Wei Wuxian by cutting off his hand. When Yu Ziyuan initially seems to comply, Wang Lingjiao delightedly informs Yu Ziyuan that she looked forward to working with her once the Supervisory Office was established.[2]\n\nYu Ziyuan responds with a resounding slap to Wang Lingjiao's face. With the help of her servants Jinzhu and Yinzhu, Yu Ziyuan declares her intent to kill Wang Lingjiao, who screams for help.[2]\n\nWen Zhuliu comes to her aid, as Wen Chao had commanded him to protect his mistress. As he fights Yu Ziyuan, Wang Lingjiao escapes and sends off a signal that summons the massacre of Lotus Pier.[6]\n\nAfter Yu Ziyuan's death, Wang Lingjiao mocks her as too aggressive for her husband Jiang Fengmian. When Wen Zhuliu reprimanded her attempt to mock Yu Ziyuan's body, she unsuccessfully attempts to convince Wen Chao to punish his bodyguard.[7]\n\nWang Lingjiao is present when Wen Chao captures Wei Wuxian and throws him into the Burial Mounds for a torturous death.[8]\n\nDeath[]\n\nUnlike her lover, she views Wei Wuxian's threat to return as a vicious Ghost as more than talk. When it becomes clear that the Qishan Wen Clan's situation in the Sunshot Campaign is weaker than they had assumed, and that Wen Chao is growing tired of her, she plans to escape with the jewelry he had given her.[4]\n\nUnfortunately, Wei Wuxian attacks with Demonic Cultivation before she can escape.[4] Wang Lingjiao goes mad, attacking Wen Chao and biting off his penis,[9] before killing herself by stuffing a stool leg down her own throat.[4]\n\nAbilities[]\n\nBranding Iron: Wang Lingjiao's spiritual power is weak enough that she is incapable of using high-level swords. As a result, her principle weapon is a spiritual branding iron common to all the Qishan Wen Clan's servants.[3]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nWen Chao[]\n\nWang Lingjiao's affair with Wen Chao lasts six months, about as long as his typical relationships.[4] He initially adores her coquettish behavior ,[3][7] but he eventually tires of her and keeps her around solely for sex.[4]\n\nWang Lingjiao had initially hoped to capture his heart forever, but in the end, she acknowledges that she is no different from any previous mistress and makes her own plans to escape.[4]\n\nWen Zhuliu[]\n\nWen Zhuliu considers Wang Lingjiao petty and cruel. He only defends her from Yu Ziyuan because he wishes to please Wen Ruohan by obeying his son Wen Chao.[6]\n\nFor her part, Wang Lingjiao seems to sense his dislike, as she unsuccessfully tries to convince Wen Chao to punish Wen Zhuliu, complaining about his reprimand for disrespect of Yu Ziyuan's body, and his slowness in aiding her.[7]\n\nWei Wuxian[]\n\nWang Lingjiao resents Wei Wuxian's interference in the cave of the Xuanwu of Slaughter, where he not only took her lover Wen Chao hostage, but also interrupts her attempt to brand Mianmian. As a result, she journeys to Lotus Pier to request him whipped and his hand removed to permanently remind him of his place as a servant.[2]\n\nDue to her role in the massacre of Lotus Pier, she is one of the three people Wei Wuxian initially targets with Demonic Cultivation.[4]\n\nAnimation Divergence[]\n\nThe animation portrays her death differently due to censorship: Wang Lingjiao dies at the hands of the Fierce Corpses of the Wen cultivators originally assigned to guard the Supervisory Office she is hiding in. Wei Wuxian then turns her into a fierce corpse and uses her to attack Wen Chao before tearing her apart with resentful energy.[10]\n\nAudio Drama Divergence[]\n\nIn a scene added to the Audio Drama, Wang Lingjiao is portrayed as the crafty mastermind behind the massacre of Lotus Pier and Wen Chao's seizure of the credit for killing the Xuanwu of Slaughter.[11]\n\nOnce she realizes her relationship is failing and that the war looks poor for the Wens, she tells a member of the Yingchuan Wang Clan to prepare to flee with her. In the novel, she prepares to flee alone.[12]\n\nWeb Series Divergence[]\n\nThe Web Series also portrays her death differently: Wang Lingjiao is compelled to scar her face before hanging herself.[13]\n\nGallery[]"
