        "text": "Previously:\n\n\"Clan Leader Lan, you are wrong, I'm not here for the lecture. I'm just escorting someone here\" he said smiling while Wang Lingjiao kept on clinging into his arms \"Besides Wen Clan of Qishan is always educating others, surely we have no need for a lecture of yours\" he smirked while Lan Wangji glared at him but he saw his brother lightly shook his head as Nie Huaisang fanned himself\n\n\"How arrogant\" Nie Huaisang whispered\n\n'Shall we begin?' Wei Wuxian thought making him smirked\n\n______________________________________\n\nPresent:\n\n\"In that case, may I asked what brings Childe Wen to the Lans Lecture if their Sect is always educating others?\" Wei Wuxian asked as the attention turned to him \"Oh could it be... Your here for something else?\" He said looking at Wen Qing which made Wen Qing gulped\n\n\"Who is this f#¢ker?\" Wen Chao said in a irritated tone\n\n\"Aiyoooo I can't be called as a 'f#¢ker'\" he said putting his feet in the desk which is his own habit\n\n\"Oh then what's your name\" Wen Chao said\n\n\"Why don't you guess?\" Wei Wuxian looked at him and smirked while the others was shocked\n\nWen Chao got irritated \"Why y– Don't you know who I am?!\" he said loudly while Wei Wuxian just shook his head\n\n\"Then why don't you use that tiny brain of yours and remember who the f#¢k you are\" he cussed while the others are even more shocked that he cuss in the cloud recesses not only that, he cussed to the Second Young Master of the Wen Clan!!\n\n\"Excuse me?!\" Wen Chao said loudly as he grip his sword\n\n\"Your excuse\" Wei Wuxian smiled making Wen Qing smirked well as for the others they were dump founded\n\n\"How rude of you!\" Wang Lingjiao shouted, interrupting them\n\n\"Oh look a b#tch spoke\" Wei Wuxian smiled leaving Wang Lingjiao embarrassed \"Beside don't you think it's not very nice to cut someone who's saluting\" he said\n\nWen Chao then changed the topic \"Y-you actually dared to insult us?!\" Wen Chao claimed with a vein in his forehead\n\n\"Who said I'm insulting you all? I'm just describing the truth?\" He asked innocently putting his hands in his chin\n\n\"Y-you!!!\"\n\n\"I'll forgive you if you and along with your clansmen get in their knees and beg for my forgiveness\" he innocently said smiling\n\n\"Who are you! To make me kneel into your lowly position!!!\" Wen Chao shouted\n\n\"Oh dear it looks like your memory isn't right, let me remind you .. I am your Great Great Great Grand Uncle\" Wei Wuxian claimed, well it's true though not gonna lie, all in the room was still shocked about Wei Wuxian's shameless act\n\n\"Stand up! You lowly peasant! And fight me!\" He threaten unsheathing his sword and pointing to Wei Wuxian\n\n\"Sorry but I don't pick a fight to those who's much more weaker than me besides that'll be animal abuse\" he said shooking his hands\n\n\"Oh are you scared? Since no one would want to stand up to you!\" He laughed\n\n\"Who? Me? Scared? To the likes of you? Hah! Don't make me laugh!\" Wei Wuxian said loudly \"And as for those who are willing to stand up for me... I would like to thank my Middle Finger who's always doing it for me\" he stick his left middle finger up making all even more shocked while Wen Qing would only hide her smirked\n\n\"Y-you! For a mere peasant who doesn't even have a complete Golden Core! Dare to talked like that!\" He shouted and he was satisfied to learn that he doesn't even have a complete golden core, which make the room full of whispered\n\n\"Qui–\"\n\n\"Hah! To think that you'd lose to this peasant! Who still doesn't have a complete golden core!\" He interrupted Lan Qiren's word as he smirked, well he did disguise it to a much weaker one.\n\nWei Wuxian grabbed a leaf in the pouch of his right leg \"Beside one leaf is enough to beat you... Even worse it can also kill you\" he claimed as he showed the leaf\n\n\"You? And that leaf? Hahhahaah!!\" He laughed and the other wen also joined in \"I bet that'll even can't kill a bug\" he laughed as he opened his arms \"Here why don't you show me what that leaf can do?\"\n\n\"So... Is no one gonna stop me? I might really do it\" he stood up\n\n\"That's enough!\" Lan Qiren shouted slamming a scroll\n\n'What happened to the no shouting rule?\" Wei Wuxian thought\n\n\"Do not interrupt!\" Wen Chao shouted\n\n\"Yo–!\"\n\n\"300 hits\" Wei Wuxian interrupted making Wen Chao go 'hah?' \"You will get flogged by 300 hits while I'll have 500\" he smiled\n\n\"Are you an Idiot? I'm not a Guest Disciple\" Wen Chao said frowning his brows\n\n\"That's right you are not a Guest Disciple but a Intruder\" Wei Wuxian said\n\n\"Ha—\"\n\n\"No invitation no entry, No Jade pass no entry, Coming late no entry, No Trespassing, No Shouting, Do not bully the weak, No Cussing, Do not threaten, Do not interrupt when one is talking, Do not have too much Pride and much...much...more, so I think you can still survive from the 300 hits... well barely... I think? But since your the son of Wen Ru–I mean Sect Leader Wen you'll have 150 hits\" he said smiling while the Lans are quite shocked to think someone can remember their rules but as Wen Chao's gonna speak Wei Wuxian got first dibs \"And for me I'll take 500 hits to be fair since I'm the one who started this\" he smiled innocently which made the Students widen their eyes. No one has ever survived being flogged 500 times\n\nA vein popped in Wen Chao's forehead, \"I am not letting that happen!!\" He shouted. \"You'll have to go through him first! If you want me to get flogged!\" He pointed behind him which is his Body Guard, Wen Zhuliu.\n\nLan Qiren spoke, \"Second Young Master Wen as this Young Lad had said... You shall receive 150 flogs and he cannot interfere for this is our Clan's Rule\"\n\n\"Are you trying to make flogged to death!!?!\" He shouted\n\n\"Oh c'mon at least yours is 150 while mine is 500 besides I heard that 500 flogs could make a cultivator go cripple?\" Wei Wuxian said. 'Aim for the bait!' he thought\n\n\"Oh? Really? Then I'll do it!\" He said with pride.\n\n'What an Idiot' Wei Wuxian thought, \"So where's the ancestral hall?\" He said\n\n\"Wangji... Show them and also since it's your first day in Lecture reduce 100 for him\" Lan Qiren said as Lan Wangji nodded.\n\nEnd of Chapter 3: Making Wen Chao angry\n\n______________________________________"
