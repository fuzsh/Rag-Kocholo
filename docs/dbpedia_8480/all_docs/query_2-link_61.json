        "text": "Huang Chao\n\nChinese rebel\n\nQuick Facts\n\nWade-Giles romanization:\n\nHuang Ch’ao\n\nDied:\n\nJuly 884, Laiwu, Shandong province\n\nHuang Chao (born, Chaoxian, Shandong province, China—died July 884, Laiwu, Shandong province) was a Chinese rebel leader whose uprising so weakened the Tang dynasty (618–907) that it collapsed a few years after the rebellion ended.\n\nAlthough well-educated, Huang Chao failed to pass his civil-service examinations and turned to salt smuggling, defying the government-granted salt-manufacturing monopoly. In 875 he collected a group of several thousand followers and joined the numerous rebellions then sweeping the country. His forces pushed into the south and in 879 occupied the rich trade city of Guangzhou (Canton). Huang then swept back north, capturing the capital at Chang’an (now Xi’an) in 881. He proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Daqi dynasty, but he was unable to organize the food supply to the capital. In 883 the government, aided by an alliance with a group of nomadic Turkish tribes, the Shatuo, drove him from the capital. The following year Huang’s troops were defeated, and Huang himself died in Shandong, but Tang’s control over the country had been destroyed by the 10-year revolt, and the dynasty rapidly crumbled. Zhu Wen, the man who finally usurped the Tang throne, was one of Huang’s former generals.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
