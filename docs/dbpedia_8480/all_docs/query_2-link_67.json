        "text": "Wen Ning was a member of the QiShan Wen Sect while alive. After death, Wen Ning became the first fierce corpse to regain consciousness thanks to Wei WuXian. He became known as the Ghost General, and served as second hand to the Yiling Patriarch.\n\nAppearance\n\nWhile alive, he was handsome with young, delicate features and pitch-black eyes. He wore the sun robes of the Wen Sect.\n\nAfter death, he retained his delicate features, though he was much paler than in life, and had quite a melancholy air. Like all other fierce corpses, Wen Ningâ€™s eyes lack pupils, and he has black lines that resemble cracks stemming from his neck up to his face. His clothes are tattered and torn at the end of his hems and sleeves, with black chains connected to handcuffs around his wrists and ankles. There were two black, iron nails had been driven into his head by Xue Yang, which were later removed by Wei WuXian.\n\nPersonality\n\nWhile alive Wen Ning was very shy and nervous, suffering from a stutter.\n\nUnlike many members of the Wen Sect, he had a strong sense of humor, kindness, and loyalty. He was very grateful to Wei WuXian for encouraging his archery, as a result causing him to risk his life to help Wei WuXian and Jiang Cheng after the massacre of the YunMeng Jiang Sect of Lotus Pier.\n\nWen Ning deeply cared for others. During a tense moment with Jin ZiXun, he had attempted to reason with the other to protect his family. Moreover, Wen Ning willingly sacrificed himself to the LanLing Jin Sect to ensure the safety of his family and friends, as well as those who hated him.\n\nAfter he died, he became a very strong fierce corpse due to his tendencies to hold his negative emotions inside himself while he was alive.\n\nHe remained sensitive to the bloodshed of his hands after he died, expressing guilt and sorrow for those he killed when Wei WuXian would lose control due to his anger.\n\nDespite lacking the ability to cry after his death, he still showed deep emotions when the remaining members of the Wen Sect that Wei WuXian had protected came out of the Blood Pool to protect those in the cave during the Second Siege of the Burial Mounds. He also seemed to be very protective of children, shown when he fought against Nie MingJue as a fierce corpse to save the children that were originally being targetted.\n\nEventually, Wen Ning learned to stand up for the people that he cared about, even if it meant breaking a promise, and to follow his own path."
