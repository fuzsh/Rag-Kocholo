Despite genetic influences on MDD and the brain, it is unclear how genetic risk for MDD is translated into spatially patterned cortical vulnerability. Here, we initially examined voxel-wise differences in cortical function and structure using the largest multi-modal MRI data from 1660 MDD patients and 1341 controls. Combined with the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we then adopted transcription-neuroimaging spatial correlation and the newly developed ensemble-based gene category enrichment analysis to identify gene categories with expression related to cortical changes in MDD. Results showed that patients had relatively circumscribed impairments in local functional properties and broadly distributed disruptions in global functional connectivity, consistently characterized by hyper-function in associative areas and hypo-function in primary regions. Moreover, the local functional alterations were correlated with genes enriched for biological functions related to MDD in general (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitogen-activated protein kinase, histone acetylation, and DNA methylation); and the global functional connectivity changes were associated with not only MDD-general, but also brain-relevant genes (e.g., neuron, synapse, axon, glial cell, and neurotransmitters). Our findings may provide important insights into the transcriptomic signatures of regional cortical vulnerability to MDD. Our combined large-scale neuroimaging and brain transcriptome study demonstrates genetic substrates underlying cortical functional abnormalities in depression, suggesting transcriptomic decoding of regional cortical vulnerability to depression.",

        "text": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, severe, disabling mental disorder that affects millions of people of all ages worldwide1,2,3. While substantial progress in the domain of psychiatry has been made over the past decades, the etiology of MDD is still largely elusive. With continuing improvements in the precision of brain imaging techniques, it is increasingly feasible to use this tool to in vivo study brain function and structure in unprecedented detail. In this context, a wealth of evidence from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has established the presence of cortical functional and structural abnormalities in MDD4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24, by adopting the most commonly used functional measurements including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF, indexing local spontaneous neural activity strength)25, regional homogeneity (ReHo, reflecting local functional synchronization degree)26, and graph-based degree centrality (DC, characterizing global functional connectivity)27,28 derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) as well as by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach to structural MRI to obtain gray matter volume (GMV)29. However, these previous investigations have produced inconsistent findings, which may be partially due to limited statistical power from relatively small samples. Notably, a large-scale study has examined ALFF, ReHo, and DC abnormalities in MDD by comparing 848 patients and 794 controls in the REST-meta-MDD project by the Depression Imaging REsearch ConsorTium (DIRECT) in China30,31,32. Despite this effort, independent replication in a much larger sample using more elaborate methodologies correcting for potential biases (e.g., site effects) is greatly needed to help reconcile these heterogeneous neuroimaging reports, which may refine our understanding of the neuropathology underlying MDD.\n\nMDD has modest heritability estimated at ~40%33,34,35. Large-scale human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found a range of risk variants, genes, and gene sets in relation to MDD36,37,38,39,40,41. By use of transcriptomic profiling, moreover, Gandal et al. demonstrated that subjects with MDD had brain gene expression changes42, yielding an updated framework for our thinking regarding how genetic variants interact with epigenetic and environmental risk factors in the brain to confer risk for MDD. In parallel, numerous neuroimaging genetics studies have documented that genetic variations influence cortical function and structure43,44,45,46,47,48, which may contribute to predisposition to mental disorders. Despite these important findings, our knowledge about how genetic risk translates into the spatial pattern of altered cortical function and structure in MDD remains sparse. Clarifying factors that shape regional cortical vulnerability to genetic risk would help to advance the translational medicine of MDD.\n\nThe current availability of whole-brain, genome-wide expression atlases, such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA)49, has created new opportunities to unravel the microscale molecular substrates underlying macroscale cortical organization. This correspondence can be achieved by examining the spatial correlations between gene expression patterns and regional variations in cortical phenotypes measured by neuroimaging techniques50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60, including functional and structural abnormalities in MDD61,62,63,64,65,66,67. Instead of making inference on thousands of genes directly as well as for the sake of facilitating biological interpretation, gene category enrichment analysis (GCEA) is typically pursued to identify functional gene categories that drive these multi-scale relationships based on gene-to-category annotation systems like the Gene Ontology (GO)68. Nevertheless, conventional GCEA methodology is affected by substantial false-positive biases introduced by within-category gene-gene co-expression and strong spatial autocorrelation, such that nearby cortical regions show more similar profiles of gene expression and neural phenotypes than distant regions53,54. These methodological challenges call for new sophisticated methods to permit more valid and interpretable inference of GCEA. In response, more recent work from Fulcher and colleagues develops a flexible ensemble-based null model that can account for the effects of gene co-expression and spatial autocorrelation69. This ensemble-based framework has the advantage of overcoming false-positive gene category enrichment, and thus allows researchers to better interpret the results of applying GCEA to spatially embedded transcriptional data and cortical phenotypes.\n\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate the transcriptomic signatures of regional cortical vulnerability to MDD. To realize this goal, we initially examined voxel-wise differences in cortical ALFF, ReHo, DC, and GMV using the largest multi-modal MRI data from 1660 MDD patients and 1341 healthy controls collected by the DIRECT consortium. In combination with the AHBA dataset, we then adopted transcription-neuroimaging spatial correlation and the newly developed ensemble-based GCEA to identify GO categories with gene expression related to cortical functional and structural changes in MDD patients. A schematic overview of the study design and analysis pipeline is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nOur neuroimaging data represent a large, multi-site effort to examine cortical functional and structural abnormalities in MDD. With respect to functional measurements, MDD patients showed an overall consistent pattern of increase in higher-order, transmodal associative areas subserving cognition and emotion as well as decrease in lower-order, unimodal primary regions with sensory and motor functions. However, the nature and spatial extent of changes differed across these functional measurements, with ALFF and ReHo in a relatively localized fashion and DC in a widely distributed manner. Further transcription-neuroimaging spatial correlation, coupled with the ensemble-based GCEA, revealed that ALFF, ReHo, and DC changes in MDD were negatively correlated with genes enriched for some biological functions related to MDD in general; and there were also positive correlations between DC changes and many brain-relevant biological functions. As to cortical structure, however, MDD patients exhibited cortical atrophy in the medial prefrontal cortex and insula, which was not associated with any gene categories.\n\nThe current observation of hyper-function in transmodal associative areas and hypo-function in unimodal primary regions in MDD is largely coherent with prior rs-fMRI investigations and meta-analyses5,6,11,18,70,71,72, especially with the earlier large-scale effort comparing 848 patients and 794 controls in the REST-meta-MDD project32. The finding of cortical atrophy in the medial prefrontal cortex and insula is also coincident with previous reports13,15,16,20,21,22,23,24,73,74. Moreover, the largest sample size could increase statistical power and stabilize effect estimates, which is a primary advantage of the present study given the inherent noisiness of neuroimaging data and the high heterogeneity of MDD. This advantage may enhance our confidence in interpreting our findings, which may reconcile prior heterogeneous neuroimaging reports. Various functional measurements from brain rs-fMRI have been widely employed to study psychiatric disorders75. We adopted three most commonly used functional measurements (ALFF, ReHo, and DC) to capture distinct yet complementary aspects of cortical functional abnormalities in MDD. ALFF measures the total power of the BOLD signal in the low-frequency range25, thus indexing local spontaneous neural activity strength. ReHo assesses the relationship between a given voxel and its nearby voxels26, thereby reflecting local functional synchronization degree. DC is a graph theory measure that evaluates the resting-state functional connectivity of each voxel with all other voxels across the whole brain27,28, frequently characterizing global functional connectivity. Our findings of localized ALFF and ReHo changes and widespread DC alterations suggest that disruptions in global functional connectivity are more prominent than impairments in local functional properties in the brains of patients with MDD, endorsing the dysconnectivity hypothesis of this disorder. Notably, our results revealed an overlap between hyper-function and cortical atrophy in the medial prefrontal cortex and insula. In light of the evidence that brain function is typically shaped and constrained by the underlying anatomy76,77,78, a possible explanation is that structural impairment could potentially affect the function of the implicated brain regions. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that structural damage may be followed by functional reorganization, reflecting a compensatory neuroadaptive mechanism in MDD.\n\nFurther transcription-neuroimaging spatial correlation, in conjunction with the newly developed ensemble-based GCEA, showed that ALFF changes in MDD were negatively correlated with expression measures of genes enriched for GO categories involving ER stress, MAPK, and NK cell. The ER is an important organelle implicated in multiple biological processes, particularly the synthesis, folding, maturation and transport of proteins. ER dysregulation can be triggered by internal and external factors, resulting in the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, referred to as ER stress. Several clinical and preclinical studies have shown a strong relationship between ER stress and depression79,80. To restore ER homeostasis and prevent apoptosis, the adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) mechanism is activated81, which is observable in patients with MDD82. More recent research suggests that UPR signaling pathway activation in astrocytes may serve as a novel target for antidepressant drugs83, emphasizing the importance of ER stress in the potential therapeutic strategies for MDD. The MAPK is an essential family of serine/threonine protein kinases, which function to regulate cellular growth, differentiation, and survival in proliferative cells. Increasing evidence supports a pivotal role of the MAPK, in particular the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subclass of MAPKs, in the pathogenesis, symptomatology, and treatment of depression84. In both depressed humans and animals, the ERK signaling has been found to be significantly downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, core brain regions implicated in depression85,86. Direct inhibition of the ERK pathway in the brain can induce depression-like behavior87. There is also empirical evidence that a variety of antidepressants exert their effects in part via normalizing the downregulated ERK activity88,89,90. It is well established that MDD is reliably associated with a reduction of NK cell activity91,92. A large-scale gene expression study demonstrated that the genes downregulated in MDD patients were enriched for NK cell pathways93. These previous reports, taken with our finding of the association between local neural activity changes and NK cell-related genes, are largely consistent with the immune dysregulation hypothesis of MDD94.\n\nReHo and DC changes in MDD were negatively associated with gene expression of GO categories implicating histone acetylation, DNA methylation, glucose metabolism, and VEGF. Dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of histone lysine residues control the packing of genomic DNA, thereby influencing DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression95. Recent studies have documented that histone acetylation may occur in the human brain in response to severely stressful events, resulting in transcriptional changes and the development of MDD96. In clinical settings, histone acetylation status has been considered a potential diagnostic biomarker for depression, while inhibitors of histone deacetylases have garnered interest as novel therapeutics97. DNA methylation is a process in which a methyl group is added to the nucleotide base pair cytosine where it is found next to a guanine, a region of the gene referred to as a CpG site98. DNA methylation can drive sustained changes in gene expression, such as gene silencing and active gene transcription. There is convergent evidence that DNA methylation modifications are associated with the etiology of depression99,100,101. Although less consistent, the relationship between antidepressant treatment and DNA methylation of several genes has also been reported101. These findings indicating significant contributions of histone acetylation and DNA methylation to MDD jointly advance our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of depression and antidepressant action102. Additionally, extensive research has established impaired cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with MDD103,104,105. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), originally described as a negative regulator of glycogen synthesis, is a molecular hub linking numerous signaling pathways in a cell. This multifaceted protein has been suggested to be engaged in the pathogenesis of MDD, and to act as an emerging target and/or modifier of antidepressants’ action106,107. VEGF is an angiogenic cytokine as well as a neurotrophic factor, critically involved in neurogenesis, neuroprotection, synaptic transmission, neuronal development regulation, and the differentiation and formation of vessels in the brain108,109,110. Numerous studies have demonstrated that MDD is linked to VEGF-related gene polymorphisms, elevated blood VEGF levels, and high VEGF mRNA expression111,112,113, highlighting the important role of VEGF in the pathophysiology of depression and antidepressant action of therapeutic interventions.\n\nContrasting with ReHo alterations showing no positive correlations with any GO categories, DC changes were positively associated with gene expression of a range of brain-relevant GO categories involving neuron, synapse, axon, glial cell, and neurotransmitters such as serotonin and glutamate, which are all key components of the cerebral cortex. On the one hand, global functional connectivity is crucial for the effective segregation and integration of information processing in the brain. Neural communication that underlies global functional connectivity is largely dependent on the integrity of these essential cortical components. On the other hand, solid evidence shows that MDD is associated with abnormalities in neuron114, synapse115, axon116, and glial cell117. The relationship between serotonin dysfunction and MDD has been arguably the most well-characterized, giving rise to the serotonin hypothesis of depression118. Prior work has also suggested that glutamate neurotransmitter deficits may contribute to altered connectivity and network function in the brains of depressed patients119, which might be reversed by novel treatments120. Combined, our findings work jointly to favor the notion that widespread disruptions in global functional connectivity are a more prominent neural characteristic of MDD, which may be modulated by a complex interaction of polygenes involving not only MDD-general, but also brain-relevant biological functions.\n\nOur neuroimaging data from large, multi-site Chinese Han samples add to the human brain mapping literature on MDD, which is typically skewed towards western samples. This is a major strength of the present study, but our results must be viewed in light of some limitations. First, the clinical complexity of MDD together with the differences in patient populations, scanners, and study protocols across sites may have biased our results. Here, appropriate and specific methodologies (e.g., ComBat harmonization) were adopted to rule out the possible effects of these confounding factors. Second, the brain gene expression data were derived from six post-mortem donors devoid of MDD and of non-Chinese ethnicity, whereas the neuroimaging data were obtained from MDD patients and healthy controls of Chinese ethnicity. These differences were ignored during the transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial correlation analyses. The inter-individual variability should be captured and considered in future work. Third, we focused our analyses solely on the cerebral cortex and excluded subcortical regions. The relationship between gene expression and subcortical abnormalities in MDD will be part of our future investigations. Fourth, our transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial correlation analyses were performed on four cortical MRI measurements separately. Additional correction for the number of the cortical MRI measurements yielded no significant correlations. Therefore, we reported the results that only corrected the number of gene categories as type II error control is equally important in exploratory research. Fifth, we found no genetic associations with cortical atrophy in MDD. This may be due to the use of GMV, which could confound effects specific to cortical thickness or surface area. As these structural measures have been shown to be genetically and phenotypically independent121, cortical thickness and surface area should be further examined in future studies. Finally, although the AHBA dataset offers an excellent resource to allow researchers to examine transcription-neuroimaging spatial correlations, future experimental animal studies are needed to validate and interpret our findings.\n\nIn conclusion, our large-scale neuroimaging data demonstrated that MDD patients had relatively circumscribed impairments in local functional properties (ALFF and ReHo) and broadly distributed disruptions in global functional connectivity (DC). These cortical functional abnormalities were consistently characterized by hyper-function in transmodal associative areas and hypo-function in unimodal primary regions. Moreover, transcription-neuroimaging spatial correlation revealed that the local functional alterations were correlated with MDD-general genes; and the global functional connectivity changes were associated with not only MDD-general, but also brain-relevant genes. Apart from helping reconcile prior heterogeneous neuroimaging reports, our findings may provide important insights into the transcriptomic signatures of regional cortical vulnerability to MDD.\n\nParticipants\n\nA total of 1660 MDD patients and 1341 healthy controls were recruited by twenty-three research groups from the DIRECT consortium. The studies were approved by local Institutional Review Boards, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All ethical regulations relevant to human research participants were followed. Participants were excluded if they had no information on age or sex. Both groups had demographic features including age, sex and education. For MDD patients, clinical characteristics included onset age, illness duration, first-episode or recurrent status, episode number, medication use, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA).\n\nImage acquisition and quality control\n\nDetails of MRI acquisition parameters across 23 sites can be found in Supplementary Table 6. Image quality control was performed by a well-trained researcher (J.Z.) who had previous expertise in inspecting neuroimaging data. For functional data, all the images were visually inspected to exclude those with visible artifacts (e.g., ghosting artifacts, metal artifacts, susceptibility artifacts, and blooming artifacts) and incomplete brain coverage. During fMRI preprocessing, we additionally excluded the images with excessive head motion during fMRI scanning (i.e., translational or rotational motion > 3 mm or 3 °) and bad spatial normalization. For structural data, manual quality control strategies are considered the current gold standard for quality control, although several options for automated quality control (e.g., Euler number) have provided potential time efficient and reproducible alternatives122. Therefore, we adopted two manual quality control strategies for the structural MRI images: (1) visual inspection with exclusion of visible artifacts, organic brain abnormality and inaccurate segmentation, and (2) visual inspection with manual editing where the inaccurate segmentation was manually edited. The quality control procedure brought the final sample to 1571 MDD patients and 1309 healthy controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the samples across 23 sites are shown in Fig. 2 (for more details see Supplementary Table 1). With the participants pooled together, we found that the two groups were comparable on age, but patients were preferentially female and had a lower educational level relative to controls (see Supplementary Table 7 for detailed information).\n\nImage preprocessing\n\nThe preprocessing of rs-fMRI data was conducted using the toolbox for Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging on Surface (DPABISurf)123, which is based on fMRIPrep124, FreeSurfer125, ANTs126, FSL127, AFNI128, SPM129, PALM130, dcm2niix131, GNU Parallel132, MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, US), Docker (https://docker.com), and DPABI133. The preprocessing pipeline included: (i) discarding the initial 10 time points; (ii) converting data into BIDS format134; (iii) calling fMRIPrep 20.2.1 docker; (iv) conducting anatomical data processing as follows: the T1-weighted image was corrected for intensity nonuniformity using N4BiasFieldCorrection135; the corrected T1-weighted image was then skull-stripped with ANTs; fast (FSL 5.0.9)136 was adopted to segment brain tissue into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); recon -all (FreeSurfer 6.0.1) was used to reconstruct brain surfaces; ANTs-derived brain masks and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical GM were reconciled using a custom variation of the method of Mindboggle137; nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.3.3) was performed for the volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym)138 using brain-extracted versions of both T1-weighted reference and the T1-weighted template. (v) Functional data preprocessing was conducted as follows: a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1-weighted reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer)139. Head motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) were estimated using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9). BOLD volumes were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI. Next, the functional datasets were normalized to the MNI152NLin2009cAsym standard space using the deformation parameters estimated during the anatomical data preprocessing. Several confounding time courses were calculated and regressed out from the data: the estimated head motion parameters based on the Friston-24 model140, the linear drift, DVARS, and BOLD signals of the WM and CSF. In addition, Jenkinson frame-wise displacement (FD) was computed as relative root mean square displacement between time points127, and mean FD was used to address the residual effects of motion in subsequent group-level statistical analyses. Finally, the functional datasets were band-pass filtered in a frequency range of 0.01 to 0.1 Hz.\n\nCortical MRI measurements and statistical analysis\n\nTo calculate ALFF, a Fast Fourier Transform was initially performed to transform the BOLD time courses into a frequency domain and obtained the power spectrum. ALFF was defined as the averaged square root of the power spectrum in a specific low-frequency band (0.01–0.1 Hz)25. ReHo was computed as the Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (KCC) of the time course of a given voxel with those of its nearest neighbors (26 voxels)26. To compute DC, we first calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the BOLD time courses of all pairs of voxels within the whole brain and obtained the whole brain functional connectivity matrix. For a given voxel, DC was defined as the sum of positive functional connectivity above a threshold of 0.25 between that voxel and all other voxels across the whole brain27,28. Finally, GMV was derived from the FSL-fast segmentation of the T1-weighted images during the anatomical data processing.\n\nThe resultant ALFF, ReHo, DC, and GMV maps were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 × 6 × 6 mm3full-width at half maximum. For the purpose of standardization, the value of each voxel in the ALFF, ReHo, and DC maps was divided by the respective global mean value, yielding standardized ALFF, ReHo, and DC maps. To reduce potential biases and non-biological variability induced by site effects, we applied ComBat141, a harmonization technique previously shown to successfully remove site effects in multi-modal imaging measurements142,143,144, to the ALFF, ReHo, DC, and GMV maps. ComBat harmonization approach makes use of a multivariate linear mixed effects regression with terms for biological variables and site to model imaging measurements. In this framework, empirical Bayes methods are adopted to improve the estimation of the model parameters for small samples. Note that we included group, age, and sex as covariates in the ComBat model to preserve important biological trends in the data and avoid overcorrection. After these procedures, cortical ALFF, ReHo, DC, and GMV differences between 1571 MDD patients and 1309 healthy controls were examined using two-samplet-tests in a voxel-wise manner, with age and sex as nuisance covariates for GMV and mean FD as an additional covariate for ALFF, ReHo, and DC. The statistical analyses generated four t maps for ALFF, ReHo, DC, and GMV, representing inter-group differences in these imaging measurements. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the cluster-level FWE method, resulting in a cluster defining threshold of P < 0.001 and a corrected cluster significance of P < 0.05, following current standard145.\n\nCortical gene expression data processing\n\nBrain gene expression data were obtained from the downloadable AHBA dataset (http://www.brain-map.org)49,146. The dataset was derived from six human post-mortem donors (Supplementary Table 8). The original expression data of more than 20000 genes at 3702 spatially distinct brain tissue samples were processed using a newly proposed pipeline54. Specifically, we first updated the probe-to-gene annotations based on the latest available information from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the Re-Annotator package147. With intensity-based filtering, we excluded probes that did not exceed the background noise in at least 50% of samples across all donors. As multiple probes were used to measure the expression level of a single gene, we further used the RNA-seq data as a reference to select probes. After removing genes that do not overlap between RNA-seq and microarray datasets, we computed the correlations between microarray and RNA-seq expression measures for the remaining genes. After excluding probes with low correlations (r < 0.2), a representative probe for a gene was selected based on the highest correlation to the RNA-seq data. Here, only the tissue samples in the left cerebral cortex were included. For one, all six donors had expression data in the left hemisphere, whereas only two donors had samples in the right hemisphere. For another, the inclusion of subcortical samples might introduce potential biases given the considerable differences in gene expression between cortical and subcortical regions49. To account for potential between-sample differences and donor-specific effects in gene expression, we conducted both within-sample cross-gene and within-gene cross-sample normalization by using the scaled robust sigmoid normalization method. Differential stability (DS) is a measure of consistent regional variation across donor brains. Previous research has reported that genes with high DS scores demonstrate more consistent spatial expression patterns between donors146. As gene expression conservation across subjects is a prerequisite for the transcription-neuroimaging spatial correlations, we only selected genes with relatively more conserved expression patterns for analysis. To achieve this goal, we ranked the genes by their DS values and chose the genes with the top 50% highest DS for the main analysis. After these processing procedures, we obtained normalized expression data of 5013 genes for 1280 tissue samples. To ensure accuracy, we further focused our analyses on the tissue samples within a cerebral cortical gray matter mask, generating a final sample × gene matrix of 753 × 5013.\n\nTranscription-neuroimaging spatial correlation and gene category enrichment analysis\n\nTo derive group differences in imaging measurements of the above-mentioned 753 tissue samples, we drew a spherical region (radius = 2 mm) centered at the MNI coordinate of each sample and extracted the average t-value of voxels within the sphere from the statistical t maps for ALFF, ReHo, DC, and GMV, respectively. Then, cross-sample (753 samples) Pearson’s correlations between gene expression and t-values were performed in a gene-wise manner (5013 genes), yielding 5013 spatial correlation coefficients (henceforth referred to as gene scores). In accordance with the Fulcher et al. study69, we conducted neuroimaging-spatial ensemble-based GCEA for these gene scores in the following way. First, updated GO term hierarchy and annotation files were obtained from the GO (http://geneontology.org/) on 11th July 2022. Second, direct gene-to-category annotations were performed for the 5013 AHBA genes, and we restricted our analyses to GO categories with 10–200 annotations. Third, the gene scores were agglomerated at the level of GO categories as a mean score of genes annotated to each GO category. Fourth, we adopted the brainSMASH toolbox (https://github.com/murraylab/brainsmash), based on the spatial-lag model148, to generate 10,000 surrogate maps with spatial autocorrelation matched to that of the ALFF, ReHo, DC, and GMV t maps, respectively. Fifth, spatial correlations between gene expression and the 10,000 spatial autocorrelation-preserving surrogate maps were carried out to construct a null distribution (i.e., neuroimaging-spatial ensemble-based null model) of mean gene scores for each GO category. Finally, statistical significance of a GO category was assessed by comparing the GO category score derived from the real data to the neuroimaging-spatial ensemble-based null. The significance level was set at two-sidedP < 0.05 (i.e., higher or lower than the null), Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple testing.\n\nStatistics and reproducibility\n\nAll statistical tests used, the sample sizes, the number of replicates, and how replicates were defined are described in the corresponding methods.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article."
