        "text": "Anonymous asked:\n\nopinions about wen chao?\n\nHe’s a dork ass loser and his death was the single most satisfying moment of the story. Fuck him.\n\nOkay that aside, I think Wen Chao is an interesting plot device character, from a writing perspective. He was very obviously meant to be a despicable character for us to hate enough that we wouldn’t mind him dying. Actually for the most part, the Wen Sect as a whole (minus the Wen Remnants) are written like this, but Wen Chao is the embodiment of that.\n\nWen Chao and his Sect were never meant to be the main antagonists. They were the main set-up device of the story. The Wens directly caused Wei WuXian’s descent into demonic cultivation. The Wens’ defeat revealed the evil (or at least wilfully ignorant) side of the other sects. But because of how “black-and-white-Evil” the Wen Sect was, it was easy not to think about the other problems of the world before they were defeated.\n\nA lot of this comes down to Wen Chao’s character. Aside from Wen Qing, Wen Ning, and A-Yuan, Wen Chao was the most notable Wen Sect member within MDZS, and also happens to be (initially) the most hate-able character in the story. He’s trash on every level - an arrogant fuck despite being unable to do anything himself, lusts after women but doesn’t respect them in the slightest, rude ass bitch, steals the glory of killing the XuanWu when in reality he ran away like a coward, kills (or tries to) whoever he wants just cuz he thinks he can, and doesn’t take responsibility for his actions. This bitch has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and with his status as the son of the leader of the Wen Sect, whic canon CONSTANTLY reminds us is evil, Wen Chao is a shining representative of the “Evil” Wen Sect.\n\nWhat he does as a character is make us hate him and the Wen Sect as much as possible as we make our way through the story, pushing us to cheer on literally anyone else in the war against them. Also, Wen Chao being so hate-able makes us less horrified at how inhumane Wei WuXian had become after the Burial Mounds. Think about it, regardless of how much we hate Wen Chao, what Wei Ying did is nothing short of demonic. He intentionally drove Wen Chao insane in an extremely cruel way, causing Wen Chao to literally EAT HIMSELF ALIVE, among other things. If Wei Ying had done this to literally anyone less hate-able than Wen Chao or his bitch Wang LingJiao, we as the audience might’ve been a lot more horrified at what he’d done. Wen Qing & Wen Ning were the opposite to this, showing kindness to those who suffered at the hands of their own sect, but ultimately we didn’t have a strong enough connection (in terms of their roles in canon) to them before the end of the war, so it was easier to focus on the hate we had for the Wens, which was much more intense, as a whole and make our mindsets be something along the lines of “The entire Wen Sect deserves to die, except Wen Qing and Wen Ning”.\n\nBasically, I hate Wen Chao. Boy do I fucking hate this greasy son of a bitch who made his entire sect look like trash. But as a character I think he was a really well done example of “how to misdirect the audience using hate”. For that, I have to appreciate him to some degree."
