        "text": "Wen Chao (温晁, Wēn Cháo) is the youngest son of Wen Ruohan, the leader of the Qishan Wen Clan.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nWen Chao's looks are described as barely passable for handsome and a little greasy, like his hair.[1]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWen Chao is a pompous man who considers it natural for others to yield to him. He enjoys attention, flaunting himself before other clans at various events.[1]\n\nDespite this arrogance, Wen Chao is unskilled in both sword work and archery, and tends to panic in dangerous situations.[1][2]\n\nWen Chao is promiscuous, choosing a new lover about every six months despite his marriage.[3]\n\nLike his father, Wen Chao also displays a sadistic streak, expressing enjoyment at Jiang Cheng's anguish when his Golden Core is melted, and delighting in the idea of giving Wei Wuxian a slow, torturous death.[4]\n\nHistory[]\n\nArchery Competition[]\n\nWen Chao fully expects to win the archery competition at the Qishan Wen Clan's grand Discussion Conference. When Wen Ning asks to participate, Wen Chao insists that he prove his skills and mocks him when his nerves failed. However, Wen Chao's archery skills are quite dismal, though he refuses to exit the field. In the end, Lan Xichen, Wei Wuxian, Jin Zixuan, and Lan Wangji place among the top four, causing Wen Chao to resent them.[1]\n\nIndoctrination[]\n\nWen Chao is assigned to manage the Qishan Wen Clan's indoctrination for other clan's disciples. With his personal bodyguard Wen Zhuliu backing him, all of the guest disciples' swords are confiscated on the first day of training.[1]\n\nWen Chao proves to be an exasperating taskmaster. He gives daily speeches and requires the trainees to cheer for him, while singling out Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji, and Jin Zixuan for public humiliation. Moreover, he forces the disciples to be on the front lines during night hunts. Wen Chao appears only at the last moment to kill the prey the trainees had already weakened through battle, and then take all the credit.[1] Despite the presence of his mistress Wang Lingjiao, Wen Chao also turns his lecherous gaze towards Mianmian, and harasses her constantly.[2]\n\nNight-Hunt of the Xuanwu of Slaughter[]\n\nWen Chao forces his trainees to search for the cave of an undisclosed creature on Mount Muxi. After locating the cave, he becomes impatient waiting for the beast to appear and commands someone to be strung up and bled as bait.[2]\n\nSensing an opportunity to rid herself of the girl she considers a rival, Wang Lingjiao suggests Mianmian. Wen Chao is originally hesitant, as he has not \"had the chance to have her yet.\" However, Wang Lingjiao's flirtations manage to convince him. Lan Wangji and Jin Zixuan then protect Mianmian, and a fight breaks out in the cave.[2]\n\nWei Wuxian disarms Wen Chao with ease and holds a sword to his throat. He quotes the warning of the Qishan Wen Clan's Wen Mao that \"those who abuse their power should be killed. Not only that, they should be beheaded for tens of thousands to revile so that those to come would beware.\" Naturally, Wen Chao reacts with fury, not recognizing that those are the words of his ancestor.[2]\n\nAfter the Xuanwu of Slaughter makes its appearance during the furor, Wen Chao panics. Wen Zhuliu rescues him, and they and the rest of the Wen disciples escape, leaving their trainees trapped in the cave with the murderous creature.[5]\n\nMassacre of Lotus Pier[]\n\nWen Chao sends Wang Lingjiao to the Yunmeng Jiang Clan's Lotus Pier to continue Wen Ruohan's plan to establish supervisory offices in every city, and orders Wen Zhuliu to protect her. After she demands Wei Wuxian's hand cut off as a punishment for his actions in the cave, Yu Ziyuan attempts to kill Wang Lingjiao. Once Wen Zhuliu rescues her, Wang Lingjiao sends a signal to the nearby Qishan Wen Clan cultivators to incite the massacre of Lotus Pier.[6][7]\n\nAfter his victory, Wen Chao mocks Jiang Fengmian and Yu Ziyuan for their deaths, though he remarks that Yu Ziyuan was beautiful.[8]\n\nWen Chao then declares Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian fugitives. When Jiang Cheng is captured, Wen Chao tries out the Yunmeng Jiang Clan's Discipline Whip, forever scarring his chest, before ordering Wen Zhuliu to melt Jiang Cheng's core.[8]\n\nOnce he captures Wei Wuxian, who had rescued Jiang Cheng from him not long before, Wen Chao expresses delight in the idea of torturing Wei Wuxian to death. Wen Chao is only dissuaded perturbed when Wei Wuxian vows to become a vicious Ghost and curse the Qishan Wen Clan once he died.[4]\n\nWen Chao then brings a beaten Wei Wuxian up to the Yiling Burial Mounds, gleefully detailing how no one has been able to tame its resentful energy. He throws Wei Wuxian from his sword into the Burial Mounds, fully expecting him to die a gruesome death.[4]\n\nDeath[]\n\nAbout three months after the launch of the Sunshot Campaign, Wen Chao receives a letter detailing his elder brother's death. After reading it, he is irritated when Wang Lingjiao awakens with a scream and orders her out of his presence.[3]\n\nWang Lingjiao leaves, but begins screaming again. By the time Wen Chao approaches her to \"shut her up,\" she has already gone mad from the influence of Wei Wuxian's Demonic Cultivation.[3] Though Wen Chao screams for Wen Zhuliu to save him, his penis is bitten off by Wang Lingjiao. He eventually falls victim to the same madness, eating the flesh off his own legs and fingers. To save his life, Wen Zhuliu takes Wen Chao and flees the scene.[3][9]\n\nWei Wuxian, Jiang Cheng, and Lan Wangji locate their hiding spot. Though Wen Zhuliu applies medicine and attempts to coax Wen Chao to eat, Wen Chao is in a pathetic state of mind, too terrified of meat to eat. After the three reveal themselves, Wen Chao babbles and drools onto his fingerless hands, while Wen Zhuliu struggles in vain to save him.[3][9]\n\nWen Chao dies after prolonged torture, kneeling in the direction of Yunmeng.[9]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nWen Ruohan[]\n\nWhile severely wounded and hunted by Wei Wuxian, Wen Chao expresses a desire to reach his father, implying that he associated some level of safety and trust with Wen Ruohan.[3]\n\nWen Xu[]\n\nWen Chao becomes extremely irritable after he received a letter detailing his elder brother's demise, implying some level of care.[3]\n\nWen Zhuliu[]\n\nWen Zhuliu is not fond of Wen Chao's character, but obeys him without question for the sake of Wen Ruohan.[7] Wen Chao, however, considers Wen Zhuliu a bodyguard of rare value who has saved him from multiple assassination attempts. Moreover, he appreciate that Wen Zhuliu does not speak much. Wen Chao refuses to punish him at Wang Lingjiao's request.[8]\n\nAfter Wei Wuxian's initial attack, Wen Chao lashes out at Wen Zhuliu, but when Wen Zhuliu steps back, he begs Wen Zhuliu not to leave him, even offering him a place as his brother.[3]\n\nWang Lingjiao[]\n\nWen Chao is initially smitten by his mistress's beauty and coquettish behaviors, though that does not keep him faithful to her, as he starts taking interest in Mianmian at the indoctrination not long into their relationship.[2]\n\nHowever, by the end of his life, Wen Chao tires of Wang Lingjiao. He only keeps her around for sex, as he fears that any new woman he found could be an assassin sent by another clan.[3]\n\nWife[]\n\nWen Chao chose a new mistress every six months, implying he did not care much for his wife.[3]\n\nWen Qing[]\n\nWen Qing expresses a desire to avoid Wen Chao as best she can, and also harbors disgust for his mistress.[4]\n\nWen Ning[]\n\nAfter Wen Ning's shyness leads to a subpar archery demonstration, Wen Chao laughs at his expense.[8]\n\nWei Wuxian[]\n\nWei Wuxian was one of the four young men Wen Chao begrudges for winning the archery competition he had expected to win.[1]\n\nInitially, Wei Wuxian merely considers him arrogant and irritating, and enjoys using Wen Mao's words to embarrass Wen Chao in the cave of the Xuanwu of Slaughter. After Wen Chao massacres Lotus Pier and melts Jiang Cheng's golden core in revenge for his humiliation, Wei Wuxian despises Wen Chao.[7][8]\n\nWhen Wen Chao captures Wei Wuxian, he declares his intent to torment him for a long while before killing him. Wei Wuxian, in turn, vows that after he died, he will \"definitely become a ferocious ghost and haunt the Qishan Wen Clan day and night, cursing all of you!\"[4]\n\nWhen Wen Chao throws him into the Burial Mounds for a torturous death, Wei Wuxian invents demonic cultivation in order to escape. After escaping, Wei Wuxian's first task is to obtain brutal revenge upon Wen Chao, Wen Zhuliu, and Wang Lingjiao.[3][9]\n\nAnimation Divergence[]\n\nWen Chao attempts to sexually assault Mianmian during the night-hunt in the animation, which does not occur in the novel. Wei Wuxian distracts him with an offer of pornography to save her.[10]\n\nHis relationship with Wang Lingjiao is also less developed, shown only brief scenes of Wang Lingjiao constantly clinging over Wen Chao.\n\nDue to censorship of graphic content, Wen Chao also dies in a different manner. Rather than being driven insane at a supervisory office after learning of Wen Xu's death, he leaves Wang Lingjiao at the office while he participates in the animation–only battle at Chongyang. Wen Chao's near-victory is upended by Wei Wuxian's arrival, whereupon Wen Chao is mauled by the feral ghost of Wang Lingjiao and impaled by materialized resentful energy before being torn to pieces.[11]\n\nWeb Series Divergence[]\n\nWen Chao is intricately involved in his father's search for the Yin Metal, which is unique to the Web Series.[12]\n\nThe full extent of Wen Chao's injuries before his death are also censored in the Web Series.[13]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nChao (晁) is normally used exclusively as a surname, but this character can also mean \"dawn\" and is often associated with the sun.[1]"
