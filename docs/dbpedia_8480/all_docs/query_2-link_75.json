        "text": "When Wen Ruohan took Wei Ying back to QishanWen he knew many things could happen but he never thought...\n\nHe never would have imagined that Wen Ruohan would take him back to the sect and announce to the sect that he would now be Wen Ruohan's son.\n\nHe knew that Wen Ruohan craved power, but he didn't think he'd go this far to ensure his loyalty.\n\n\"Your name is now Wen Ying, the courtesy name I gave you, Wen Ye.** You are now the third son of Sect Leader Wen.\" Wen Ruohan told Wei Ying and Wei Ying smiled brightly.\n\n\"Thank you, father!\" Wei Ying said 'cheerfully'.\n\n\"Come, I'll take you to meet your brothers.\" Wen Ruohan said, leading Wei Ying by the hand.\n\nWei Ying nodded 'enthusiastically' as they walked down the hall and to a room where Wei Ying saw a younger Wen Chao and who he assumed to be\n\nWen Xu.\n\n**Ye (é‚ª) meaning evil, wicked; misfortune; strange.**\n\nTo think he that he'll have to call that pig Wen Chao his brother. It disgusts him but he'll bear with it if it means he can help the people he cares about.\n\n\"Wen Ying, this is my first born Wen Xu and my second born Wen Chao. They will now be your older brothers.\" Wen Ruohan said introducing the two.\n\n\"Nice to meet you my name is Wen Ying, courtesy name Wen Ye.\" Wei Ying said with a kind smile that would surely rival the sun.\n\n\"Hmph.\" Wen Chao said turning up his nose to Wei Ying, his inferiority complex showing.\n\n\"What is your reason for suddenly adopting a child?\" Wen Xu asked, and it was obvious that him and Wen Chao were very different.\n\nWei Ying had never met Wen Xu personally in his previous life but based off what he's seeing, he seems to take after his father.\n\n\"Wen Ying is a unique child that can't be found anywhere else.\" Wen Ruohan said and when Wen Xu gave him a questioning look, he called for a servant to bring someone from the dungeon.\n\nIt didn't take long for the a servant to come in with a man in metal shackles on both his hands and feet, wearing rags.\n\nThe man was forced to kneel to Wei Ying's height and he looked like he was about to pass out at a moments notice. The mans heart beat is slow and his breaths shallow, he was most likely on the verge of death.\n\n\"He's all yours Wen Ying.\" Wen Ruohan said and Wei Ying knew what he wanted him to show his sons.\n\n\"Thank you!\" Wei Ying exclaimed 'cheerfully' before sinking his teeth into the mans neck. His eyes glowed red as the sweet bliss of blood filled him. When Wei Ying was finished he dropped the mans body to the floor.\n\nWei Ying looked up smiling and the two brothers wore very different expressions. Wen Chao looked like he was trying not to show how he was scared and put on a look of disgust.\n\nWen Xu was looking at him with a calculating gaze much like his fathers. He was most likely weighing Wei Ying's pros and cons.\n\n\"You are both to treat Wen Ying well, understood?\" Wen Ruohan said.\n\n\"Yes, father.\" The two said in unison but Wei Ying noticed the slight change in Wen Chaos heart beat and breathing. Wen Chao was lying.\n\n\"Wen Ying will stay in one your two rooms, I will let you three decide who he will stay with for the time being. I have some business to attend to for now.\" Wen Ruohan said as he left and the moment that he was out of earshot Wen Chao opened his foul mouth.\n\n\"Why do I have to share my room with a dirty street rat like him!\" Wen Chao complained, his prepubescent voice shrill and downright annoying.\n\n\"I want to room with first brother!\" Wei Ying said ignoring Wen Chao as he went over to Wen Xu. If he had to sleep in the same room as Wen Chao he doesn't think he'd be able to hold back from killing him gruesomely.\n\n\"Are you sure? There are no toys in my room like there are in my brothers room.\" Wen Xu said out of what Wei Ying thought was curiosity.\n\n\"That's okay, I've never had toys.\" Wei Ying said like it was only natural.\n\n\"Hmm... I see, then come with me and I'll show you to my room where you'll be sleeping.\" Wen Xu said turning to leave, obviously expecting him to follow. Wei Ying didn't hesitate to slide his hand into Wen Xu's. He expected Wen Xu to say something or pull away but there was nothing. Wen Xu silently held his hand till they reached a room Wei Ying assumed to be Wen Xu's.\n\nWei Ying wasn't sure what he expected his room to look like but it was surprisingly empty aside from a bed, table, and a beautifully painted screen to separate the bath from the rest of the room. The screen was painted with chocolate sunflowers and Wei Ying couldn't help but think it was beautiful.\n\n______\n\nWei Ying wasn't surprised he found himself face to face with Wen Chao and his disgusting friends.\n\n\"Why has brother come looking for me?\" Wei Ying asked innocently like he didn't know that Wen Chao wanted to bully him.\n\nHe'd rather die than let that idiot bully him.\n\n\"A rat like you isn't my brother, so get lost.\" Wen Chao said condescendingly as tossed a few coins at his feet.\n\nWei Ying's smile dropped and his eyes narrowed as he said, \"No.\"\n\n\"Fine, then don't blame me for being rude.\" Wen Chao said, a ugly smirk on his face.\n\nWen Chao and his friends all went to attack him, their intention to beat him up clear as day. However Wei Ying's strength was inhuman for his age and he easily beat Wen Chao and the other 4 kids. All five of them laid on the ground, Wen Chao being the least injured. Wei Ying didn't want to make Wen Ruohan mad over something like that.\n\nWei Ying headed to the healers and when he got there approached one of them.\n\n\"Excuse me mister, my brother and his friends need some medical attention.\" Wei Ying said politely with a smile.\n\n\"Eh, can't you see we're busy kid?\" The man said clearly annoyed and Wei Ying couldn't help but think 'busy? With what? Taking that stick out of your ass?'\n\n\"Ow!!??\" The man yelled as a woman hit him in the back of the head pretty hard.\n\n\"Sorry, my idiot of a husband just got back from visiting his family's graves and didn't know of you're arrival Third Young Master Wen.\" The Woman said and Wei Ying smiled kindly.\n\n\"It's ok, but my brother and his friends do need medical attention.\" Wei Ying said, with no intention to abuse his status like most would.\n\n\"What'd he do to need medical attention?\" The woman asked as Wei Ying brought her to where Wen Chao and his friends were still on the ground.\n\n\"They picked a fight and lost.\" Was all Wei Ying said as she examined the 5 boys.\n\nThe woman paled slightly saying, \"who'd they pick a fight with that would be able to break their bones?\"\n\n\"....me.\" Wei Ying said and when the woman's expression slowly morphed into fear, he knew it'd be best to distance himself from others.\n\nThere aren't many people who wouldn't feel either fear, greed or envy towards his strength..."
