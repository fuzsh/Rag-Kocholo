When he was young, Fengmain made a sword for him. When Wei Wuxian asked Fengmian what to name his sword, Fengmian said ‘Whatever’, so Wei Wuxian’s sword is named ‘Whatever’.\n\nBows and Arrows - Wei Wuxian knows how to use bows and arrows, even upon horseback.\n\nMagic - he is able to use his natural energy, like all cultivators, as well as use dark magic to summon zombies from the dead.\n\nManipulation of the Dead - Wei Wuxian brings a flute along with him, upon playing can summon the dead and do his bidding. However, it had downsides…. [spoiler. ask me if you wish]. The name of his flute is Chenqing.\n\nSummary:\n\nPreviously a well-known necromancer who has killed more than 3000 soldiers, Wei Wuxian died a terrible and violent death. 13 years later, he was forcefully summoned by another cultivator, Mo XuanYu who used a forbidden curse. The curse was for the evil spirit summoned to grant its contractor a wish, and the price was for its contractor to offer his/her body to the evil spirit. Mo XuanYu’s wish was for Wei Wuxian to take revenge on his family on his behalf. After that, Wei Wuxian was given a chance once more to live, except he is now using Mo XuanYu’s body. Wei Wuxian remembers everything from his previous life. However, due to his violent and terrible death that left his soul a bit broken, he couldn’t remember how he died.\n\nPersonality:\n\nWei Wuxian is an easy-going, carefree, full-spirited and highly-skilled cultivator, a prankster with a heroic and humble heart. Due to his background with Fengmian’s wife and the mother of Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli, Yu Ziyuan’s hatred towards him and Jiang Cheng’s jealousy for him, Wei Ying sought to take up the facade of a clown to appease everybody. However, he managed to grow up having a good relationship with Yanli and Jiang Cheng, and his adoptive siblings also cared for him in return.\n\nThough Wei Wuxian is a good man, circumstances in his life forced him to take the necessary steps and cultivate the dark arts, exploring his theory of summoning ghosts to fight ghosts. The event provoked him to undergo a massive personality change, causing chaos and destruction in his wake, killing more than 3000 people and some of his loved ones. The last event which caused Jiang Cheng to hate him for life, and everyone that previously loved him to abandon him.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nbirth - 3 years old. Born as Wei Ying, he was the son of a Wei Changze, as servant, and a rogue cultivator, Cangse Sanren. When Cangse was pregnant, his parents retreated from Yunmeng to the forests of Yiling where he was born. They led a happy albeit short life. On a night-hunt, Wei Changze and Cangse Sanren were killed, leaving 3-year-old Wei Ying to wander around the streets a beggar.\n\n3-6 years old. Life in the slums were not kind to him. Often he had to fight stray dogs for food, resulting in being chased by packs and bitten all over his body, ultimately instilling an intense fear for dogs. For three years his life pass in this manner until Jiang Fengmian found him by the streets. Wei Ying during that time was riddled with diseases, until Jiang Fengmian took him back to Yunmeng and nursed him back to health. Jiang Fengmian also bestowed upon him a courtesy name: Wei Wuxian.\n\n6-15 years old. In Yunmeng he became adoptive siblings to Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng. Due to their parents often arguing between themselves, the trio took comfort in each other, with Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng often looking up for Jiang Yanli’s guidance and doting. Wei Wuxian was incredibly close to Jiang Cheng, and both of them incredibly protective of Jiang Yanli.\n\n15 years old. Wei Wuxian, along with Jiang Cheng, were sent to Gusu Lan, a neightbouring sect, to study for a year. There he met Nie Huaisang and Gusu’s second young master Lan Wangji. Wei Wuxian became good friends with Nie Huaisang and took fancy to Lan Wangji, seeing him as an interesting individual. Later on, after beating up Jiang Yanli’s fiance for being disrespectful to her, Wei Wuxian was expelled and sent back to Yunmeng.\n\n17 years old. Abandoned by the Wen Chao to die in a cave with a monstrous turtle with Lan Wangji. Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji both teamed up and defeated the 5000-year-old creature on one fell swoop and became famous overnight. However, Wei Wuxian feels a sickening feeling in his stomach as he realized that he has offended Wen Chao, the heir to the tyranny Wen Sect that dominates the cultivational world.\n\nWHEN ALL TURNS TO ASHES\n\n17 years old. Wen Chao took an army to raze his home, Yunmeng Jiang, to the ground and killed everyone in it. Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian fought and wallows in agony for one entire night over the death of their parents. The fact the Madam Yu died saving them was no comfort to them.\n\n18 years old. Wounded fatally by Wen Chao, Wei Wuxian was tossed into the Burial Mounds, a land of death and decay, said that even ghosts and spirits were unable to escape from. Wei Wuxian cries at the anguish that he has yet to exact revenge and only to fall into the very same hands who murdered his family and destroyed his home. A voice answers to him, grants his wish, with a price.\n\n3 months later. He emerges as the Yiling Patriarch, manipulator of the dead with ghostly music. All those who knew him feared him, Lan Wangji alone who dared to scold him for picking up the Path of the Ghost.\n\n22 years old. The remaining four sects gathered their forces against him when they realized he uncontrollable and would bend no knee. Those in his care were robbed and murdered. Even Wei Wuxian himself was unable to protect himself. He died.\n\nREBIRTH AND SECOND CHANCE.\n\n35 years old. 13 years later a voice calls to him. A young man, the bastard of his killer, urges him to exact revenge on his behalf if he lets him live. Wei Wuxian had no choice but to obey, as the young man has used a curse that forcibly summons a spirit. Once again he was ressurected into this world."
