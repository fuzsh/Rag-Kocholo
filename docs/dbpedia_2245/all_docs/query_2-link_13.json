        "text": "Work on the implementation of the Future Expansion and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP-WPMP) at the Tengiz field is progressing behind schedule and is scheduled for completion at the end of 2024, said Kazakhstan’s Energy Minister Almassadam Satkaliyev.\n\n“The reasons why there was a delay in the implementation of the project and the safety of the work carried out are objective, related to ensuring the quality of the work. We plan to complete it at the end of this year,” Satkaliev said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier, the Ministry of Energy of the Republic reported that the launch of the FGP of the Tengiz oil and gas field is postponed until the second quarter of 2025, and the wellhead pressure management project – to the second quarter of 2024.\n\n“On December 15, 2023, Tengizchevroil LLP sent a request to partners for approval, providing for the postponement of the launch of WPMP facilities to the second quarter of 2024 (from December 2023) and the FGP to the second quarter of 2025 (from June 2024),” explained at the Ministry of Energy.\n\nIn October 2023, Satkaliev reported that the launch of the Tengiz FGP-WPMP was postponed for six months.\n\nThe Tengiz oil and gas field is one of the largest in Kazakhstan, with oil reserves amounting to 3.2 billion tons. Located in the Atyrau region (west of the country).\n\nThe field is being developed by Tengizchevroil (TCO), which is implementing a production expansion project and a wellhead pressure management project in Tengiz with a total cost of $46.7 billion (previously estimated at $45.2 billion). The project was planned to be completed at the end of 2022, but due to work being behind schedule, the launch was postponed to 2024. The project will increase TCO production by 12 million tons per year.\n\nThe participants of Tengizchevroil LLP are Chevron (50% participation share), ExxonMobil Kazakhstan Ventures Inc (25%), Kazakhstan through KazMunayGas (20%), LUKOIL (5%)."
