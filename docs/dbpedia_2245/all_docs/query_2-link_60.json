        "text": "Silk Road Treasures: The Wild Beauty of Mangistau\n\nUnder the banner of \"Silk Road Treasures\", TCA's people -journalists, editors, authors - share their personal experiences of Central Asia and her people, and by listing their favorite places, literature, films, art, architecture and archaeological sites, alongside encounters and customs, provide pointers for readers wishing to visit the region. Aliya Haidar, Journalist Kazakhstan's Mangistau Peninsula (Mangyshlak) is far from fit for human habitation. Fresh water is scarce, the air is filled with dust raised by searing desert winds, huge waves roll over the turbulent Caspian Sea, and only camels can feed on its vegetation. Mangistau is a symbol of the triumph of nature and, simultaneously, a symbol of victorious industrialization. The balance between the two, however, is very fragile, as events on the peninsula have repeatedly confirmed. In 2000, the peninsula's landscape still retained its wild, natural beauty but just a decade later, it was a place plagued by social conflict. The remains of ancient nomadic sites and necropolises of Sufi missionaries illustrates that people have long been determined to tame and develop this remote and barren land but its explosive growth only occurred with the discovery of oil and uranium. In the 1960s, geologists settled in the desert. Within ten years, cities appeared and hundreds of enterprises were established, making Mangistau one of the gems in the Soviet Union's crown. Colossal desalination plants near the regional center of Aktau (former Shevchenko) resembling spaceships, are a legacy of the era of rapid development when the world's first industrial nuclear reactor on fast neutrons, the BN-350, was built on the peninsula. The reactor was shut down after independence in the late 1990s, but conservation is ongoing. Today, few people are allowed into the gloomy catacombs, to the heart of the reactor, but the memory of the power of the atom and the payback has remained. BN-350 is part of the Mangistau Atomic Energy Combine (MAEC), and the giant desalination plants now supply most of the peninsula with water from the Caspian Sea. But there is still insufficient capacity, and the presence of the endless row of desalination plants warns: \"Beware, man. You will have to fight for every drop.\" Even in the regional center of Aktau, water cuts are not uncommon, and intensive farming is out of the question. In the bazaars of Mangistau, most of the products, especially fruit and vegetables, are imported and far more expensive than elsewhere in Kazakhstan where they grow in abundance. And although salaries in the oil industry are higher than the national average, locals pay triple the price for just about everything. Irresistibly attracted by the glitter of “black gold,\" the population in the peninsula continues to rise. Almost 800 thousand people currently live in the Mangistau region, making it the ninth most populous region in the country. The load on the peninsula's natural resources however, is now so disproportionate that it has become the cause of constant conflicts. But outside the cities, it is easy to forget the harsh reality of the industrial age. In the port of Bautino, whitewashed houses rise out of the yellow desert haze like a set from a movie. Still bearing the name of a Bolshevik killed by the White Guards in 1919, the port also houses the Kazakhstani fleet and oil companies' ships. A small icebreaker swings by the pier, poised to deal with the capricious Caspian sea when it freezes in winter. Melting and shimmering in the grey haze of the 50-degree heat, the 150 kilometer highway separating Aktau and oil zone of Zhanaozen, is devoid of settlements and roadside stores, and the only signs of life are the silhouettes of camels - “desert ships”- floating by in the distance. Apart from a modest signpost, nothing tells you that you are passing Karagye, one of the deepest dry depressions in Asia (132 meters below sea level). Also known as \"Black Mouth\", it is easy to imagine that in times immemorial, the spirits of the local deserts rose from the canyon. [caption id=\"attachment_22442\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1142\"]\n\n@Lada.kz. Karagiye is the deepest natural depression in Kazakhstan (132 meters below sea level) [/caption] Zhanaozen is another legacy of the Soviet era. Given the dry climate, the neighborhood accesses fresh water transported hundreds of kilometers from the Volga River; the result of a bold innovation by engineers after the fall of the USSR which almost turned into a disaster. In 2000, every faucet in the city was wrapped in gauze, and the water looked like rusty liquid mud. Even in expensive hotels and oil company offices, washing was a problem. In 2011, thanks to the reconstruction of the water pipeline, the water situation improved somewhat, but nevertheless, did not deter residents from rioting. Like all desert cities, Zhanaozen seems to appear from nowhere. There are no suburbs or groves, just cube-like houses that suddenly rise from the desiccated earth. The town is encircled by kilometers of “shakes” of the Novy Uzen (Zhanaozen) deposit, one of the oldest in Kazakhstan. Today, supplies of Novy Uzen are close to exhaustion but that does not stop the influx of those wanting to work in the oil industry. Due to the high cost of food, poor living conditions, and dissatisfaction with wages, a protest broke out in the town in December 2011. Protesters spent over half a year camping in tents where under the scorching sun and winter winds, they defended demands that the management of the oil company and the Akimat (mayor's office) could not satisfy. Finally, on December 16, during Kazakhstan's Independence Day celebrations, angry protesters started riots in Zhanaozen Square. Fifteen people died, hundreds were arrested, and dozens were convicted. [caption id=\"attachment_22443\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"910\"]\n\n@Denvistorii. Crackdown on protesters in Zhanaozen (2011) [/caption] The oil region remains shaken. But despite the harsh nature and social cataclysms, Mangistau holds fast. In red rocks on windy plateaus, in fishing fields, in rare oases behind a rich dastarkhan, the peninsula's inhabitants welcome guests, and the region remains the pearl of Kazakhstan.\n\nTop Nuclear Expert in Uzbekistan Dies at Age 79\n\nBehzod Yo'ldoshev, a prominent Uzbek scientist who was deeply involved in international efforts to ensure the safe use of nuclear power and was a key player in Uzbekistan’s ongoing drive to build a nuclear power plant for energy generation, has died. Yo’ldoshev, president of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, worked as a scientific adviser at the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency and “received wide international recognition in the field of high-energy physics,” the office of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said in a statement. After Yo’ldoshev died at the age of 79 on Wednesday, Mirziyoyev visited his family at their home, where mourners prayed and recited verses of the Quran. The Uzbek scientist collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, an international center in the Moscow region where he earned his PhD in physics and mathematics, and also had teaching jobs at Stanford University and the University of Washington. Yo’ldoshev published several hundred scientific papers on particle and nuclear physics and other topics, and held more than 20 patents on nuclear applications, according to Stanford. “Uzbek science has suffered a heavy loss,” the Uzbek sciences academy said on social media. Others paying tribute to Yo’ldoshev included the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics of the National University of Uzbekistan, as well as Gennady Krasnikov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Uzbekistan has been planning to build a nuclear power plant with Russian help for years, but the project has encountered delays. The project got a boost in May when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tashkent and signed a new deal to build a smaller plant than previously envisioned. Yo’ldoshev was involved in the fitful efforts to deliver nuclear power in Uzbekistan. In 2019, he was in Vienna to inform the International Atomic Energy Agency that the plant would be built in line with the U.N. watchdog’s requirements. In 2020, Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, gave Yo’ldoshev a medal for his contributions to the use of atomic energy. Over his decorated career, Yo’ldoshev contributed to international non-proliferation work, such as upgrading research reactors, developing ways to stop illicit trafficking of nuclear material, as well as the transport and securing of highly enriched spent fuel. His other roles included director of the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan and as a member of parliament.\n\nAs Kazakhstan Marks Constitution Day, What Does the Occasion Really Symbolize?\n\nKazakhstan marks Constitution Day on August 30, an event inaugurated by the country's second president, Kasym-Jomart Tokayev. The day has taken on a new meaning since the events of January 2022, when violent unrest throughout the country put Tokayev's authority under the spotlight. This newer version of the country's laws is still being tested for strength. The new constitution was adopted following a national referendum in 2022, after the mass riots. The main change within it is the limitation of presidential terms. Under the new law, the president in Kazakhstan is elected once every seven years, and the same person cannot hold the post for consecutive terms. In 2022, when Tokayev was re-elected early under these new norms, there was a lot of talk about political tricks. His presidential term expires in 2029; there is hope that he will fulfil his obligations and simply stand down. The first constitution of independent Kazakhstan was adopted in January 1993. It incorporated laws on people's sovereignty, the independence of the state, recognition of the Kazakh language as the state language, recognition of the President as the head of state, and recognition of the judicial bodies -- the Supreme, Constitutional, and Higher Arbitration Courts. The 1993 constitution was based on the model of a parliamentary republic. The current constitution was adopted on 30 August 1995, again following a national referendum. However, since 1995, it has been amended five more times: in 1998, 2007, 2011, 2017, and 2019. The most significant changes took place in 2022, after the mass unrest of that January. On May 5, Tokayev announced a referendum on amendments to the constitution. According to him, the purpose of the amendments was to transition to “a new state model, a new format of interaction between the state and society ... from a super-presidential form of government to a presidential republic with an influential parliament and an accountable government.” Amendments to 33 articles were prepared. The referendum was held on June 5, 2022, and 77% of those who voted supported the amendments. It is these amendments that are being celebrated today: the constitution that represents the new path that Tokayev's Kazakhstan is taking.\n\nJadids in Germany: Uzbekistan Looks to Past to Inspire Young People\n\nAt the Tashkent City Mall, a new Greek restaurant promises what it calls an “unforgettable adventure” for foodies. Superhero fans can check out the Deadpool & Wolverine movie at the mall’s cinema. But it’s not all fine dining and pop culture – a multimedia exhibition there traces the saga of students from Central Asia who studied in Germany and fell victim to Stalinist purges in the 1930s. Why was the exhibition, featuring visual and sound installations, installed in a glitzy shopping complex where lots of people, especially young people, relax and mingle? A clue lies in the Uzbek government’s enthusiasm for highlighting the history of the “Jadids,” members of a progressive movement of pious Muslims who pursued secular education, openness to the outside world and early ideas about independence, even as they faced restrictions and oppression under Russian colonial and then Soviet rule. A century later, the Jadids are a model for Uzbekistan, which seeks new international partners as it searches for ways to train and harness its growing population of young people. The three-month exhibition, titled “Jadids. Letters to Turkestan,” was supported by the state Uzbekistan Art and Culture Development Foundation. It opened on July 18 and coincides with upcoming days of national commemoration on Aug. 31 and Sept. 1. One prominent visitor was Saida Mirziyoyeva, daughter of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev and one of his senior aides. Mirziyoyeva said on the X platform that she was impressed by the exhibition’s account of about 70 Jadid (“new” in Arabic) students, “who made significant contributions to our people's science and culture during their short lives.” The students came from Turkestan, an old name for Central Asia. They included Uzbeks as well as Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Turkmen and Tatars. In 1922, as the Soviet Union was taking shape, they traveled to Germany and studied agriculture, textiles, chemistry, electrical engineering, mining, philosophy, teaching and medicine. “At the root of all this was the dream and goal of achieving national development and national independence,” scholar Naim Karimov wrote. The Stalinist regime saw the students’ education abroad and exposure to different ideologies as a threat to Soviet control. Most of the students who returned to Uzbekistan were falsely accused of espionage and executed or exiled. There was a particularly brutal period of repression in October 1938. The exhibition focuses on the letters, many hopeful and idealistic, that the students wrote while they were in Germany. One haunting section is dedicated to the persecution that they suffered when they returned home. There is a display of the names of Jadids who were shot in 1937-1938 – some had gone to Germany and others helped them travel there. An audio segment plays excerpts from the interrogation of a sponsor of the Jadids, who is accused of treason and says: “I want to live, don’t kill me!” One installation depicts a pile of books that were seized by Soviet authorities and set on fire. A father's appeal can be heard: \"Don't burn my daughter's books! Her only fault is that she studied in Germany.\" ------- One of the students whose story is told in the exhibition at Uzbekistan’s biggest mall is Khairiniso Majidkhanova, who studied in Germany for five years and worked as a doctor on her return to Uzbekistan. “I was lucky enough to send the first Uzbek girl to a distant country for knowledge!” Majidkhanova’s father wrote in a letter. Kholida Kadirova, Majidkhanova’s niece, said in a documentary shown on Uzbek television several years ago that Majidkhonova was imprisoned on September 15, 1937. Soldiers searched her room, confiscated books, newspapers, magazines and letters, and burned them in the yard. Majidkhonova, 32, was shot and killed on Oct. 9, 1938. “Unfortunately, my aunt had big dreams,” said Kadirova, tears in her eyes. “She started translating various medical manuals brought from Germany from German into Uzbek, and started working on scientific research. She encouraged me to study in this field in the future, she made me enjoy the light of enlightenment.” ------- Another student was Sattar Jabbar, known as the first Uzbek chemist. Under the pseudonym Ertoy, he wrote about German hospitality: “When we first arrived in Germany, many reporters were excited to meet us. Any German opened his doors to welcome us into his family. From ordinary teachers to doctors and professors, they spared no effort to help us learn the language. As Germans love the world, they are also very interested in Turkestan. They know our country, our history, our prospects better than Turkestan people.” Jabbar returned to Uzbekistan in 1931 and gave lectures on chemistry at the Central Asian State Medical Institute (now the Tashkent Medical Academy). In 1936, Jabbar received the title of professor. In 1937, he was arrested and accused of anti-Soviet activities. He denied the accusations but was executed. ------- Saida Sherahmedova was among students who learned about the repression back home decided to stay in Germany or other countries. Her brother Nasriddin and nephew Fuzail had gone with her to Germany and went home to work – Nasriddin as an economist and Fuzail as a water management specialist, helping to construct the Great Ferghana Canal project in the 1930s. But they were rounded up and killed in the purges at the end of that decade. So, Sherahmedova moved to Turkey after finishing her studies. She taught at a girls’ lyceum in Istanbul and died at age 87 in 1992, one year after Uzbekistan gained independence when the Soviet Union collapsed. -------- Each Aug. 31, at a Tashkent memorial site called Shahidlar Xotirasi (Memorial to the Victims of Repression), the government leads a ceremony for the thousands of Uzbek people who were killed during repressive periods under Russian colonial and Soviet rule. Uzbekistan celebrates its Independence Day on Sept. 1.\n\nU.S. Think Tank Calls on American Politicians to Make Uzbekistan a Valued Partner\n\nDaniel Runde, a senior vice-president at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has called on American politicians to strengthen the U.S.'s relations with Uzbekistan. He believes that Uzbekistan, a key partner for the United States in Central Asia, deserves more attention from the West. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing competition with China, the U.S. could strengthen ties with Uzbekistan to promote regional stability and counterbalance Russian and Chinese influence. “Uzbekistan seeks more engagement with the United States through bilateral efforts and the “C5+1” (the five Central Asian countries plus the United States) diplomatic platform. We might never become Uzbekistan’s best friend. However, we could become better and more reliable friends. Uzbekistan has five bordering countries, and at one point in the early 2000s, it considered the United States its ‘sixth neighbor,’” Runde mentioned. “When the U.S. government was active in Afghanistan, we supported Uzbekistan’s efforts to develop its economy and invest in its security. With our disengagement from Afghanistan, we need to look at Uzbekistan as the valued partner that it could be and re-engage. We should work towards the day that Uzbekistan considers the United States its ‘sixth neighbor’ again.” According to Runde, there are several goals that the US could assist Uzbekistan in achieving. While some are significantly more difficult to handle, others are relatively straightforward: 1) Uzbekistan wants U.S. support to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), a goal it has pursued for almost 30 years. The U.S. has provided some technical help, and during a recent visit, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai reaffirmed America’s support. For further progress, Uzbekistan could benefit from greater involvement from U.S. institutions like the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Export-Import Bank (EXIM), and U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to strengthen trade ties with the U.S. 2) Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries want the U.S. to repeal the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which restricts regular trade with them. This amendment, initially targeting Soviet-era policies, is now outdated and seen as disrespectful, as it treats these nations as if they are still part of the Soviet Union. Repealing it would show that the U.S. respects their independence and is ready to treat them as equal partners. “Jackson-Vanik now restricts normal trade relations with several existing and former nonmarket economies, including Uzbekistan. For countries like Uzbekistan, Jackson-Vanik is a sign of disrespect that encourages them to take their business to China, Russia, Turkey, or the Gulf,” Runde argues. 3) He notes that many developing countries, including Uzbekistan, would like to see Congress successfully renew the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a trade preference program. “The GSP benefited many developing countries by providing duty-free treatment for their products. With the absence of this program, trade volumes between Uzbekistan and the United States have not been as impressive as they might have been. Compare U.S. trade with Uzbekistan and Uzbekistan’s trade with China, Russia, or the EU. The lapse of the U.S. GSP has had a real impact on our influence in places like Uzbekistan.” As explained by Runde, in countries like Uzbekistan, not renewing the U.S. GSP program signals that the U.S. doesn’t care about them. Without this program, Uzbekistan is more likely to trade with China or Europe. 4) “One way or the other, it is in the United States’ interest to be seen as helping Uzbekistan sort out its logistics and connectivity issues,” Runde states. Uzbekistan is a quickly growing country with an enormous industrial base and abundant mineral reserves. Strengthening U.S. ties with Uzbekistan and Central Asia is beneficial, regardless of U.S. elections. 5) The U.S. could have had a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with Uzbekistan. Still, it was delayed due to issues in 2005 when the Uzbek government crushed riots in a regional city and retaliated by kicking the U.S. out of the “K2” military base used for the Afghan War. From Runde's point of view, a new administration might revive and complete the BIT.\n\nPublic in Uzbekistan Concerned About Pavel Durov’s Arrest\n\nThe arrest of the founder of the popular Telegram messaging app, Pavel Durov, in Paris on August 24 on charges of illegal activities including enabling drug trafficking, crimes against minors, and fraud has caused public discussion and unease in Uzbekistan, where use of the platform is widespread. Durov’s visit to Uzbekistan in June highlighted the platform’s deep integration into daily life in the country. “Uzbekistan loves Telegram: over 70% of the country’s 37 million people are on Telegram, and their entire economy is run on our platform - every business in the country has a Telegram bot or channel. We are proud of this popularity and love Uzbekistan,” Durov stated during his visit. Across the nation, people are now worried that Telegram may be switched off, and are talking and writing about the need to choose an alternative messenger to share files and communicate. Comments such as “Free Durov” can be found under an abundance of news and social media posts, whilst another group of users believes that such an extensive network cannot be destroyed so easily. Political scientist Hamid Sadiq told the Firkat analytical program that Durov’s arrest could be part of a more extensive planned program. Describing Durov as Telegram's “face” and his brother Nikolai as its “brain,” Sadiq noted that no one has yet been able to crack Telegram's encryption, and today, the messenger continues to work without bans in Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and even China. The political scientist describes Durov as an \"anarchist,\" unlike Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Steve Jobs. Stating that Durov disagrees with Putin’s regime and pointing to the conflict with Vkontakte in Russia in 2014, Sadiq states that he considers the accusations against Durov to be absurd, and that Durov was granted French citizenship in 2021 “for his great political services.” As the situation develops, the impact of Durov’s arrest on Telegram’s future remains unclear. Yesterday, the Times of Central Asia reported on the reaction to this event in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Both the Russian and Ukrainian military use Telegram, with Russia’s war machine particularly reliant, and any cracks in its encryption could prove particularly disastrous to Russia’s war effort. However, as Telegram messages are not end-to-end encrypted as they are in Signal and WhatsApp – meaning they can be read by Telegram’s staff - the platform has been left open to requests to cooperate in the dissemination of data to state actors. It seems that what sets Telegram apart, attempting to bridge the gap between being a messenger app and a social media platform, may prove to be its downfall. As this story develops, it appears the public in Central Asia are right to have cause for concern.\n\nSkyward Ambitions: Navigating the Growth and Challenges of Kazakhstan’s Aviation Industry\n\nAccording to the Concept for the Development of the Transport and Logistics Potential of the Republic of Kazakhstan by 2030, the development of the country's civil aviation industry should be conducted in three key areas: flight safety, route network development, and infrastructure modernization. So, how do things stand today in regard to fulfilling these tasks? As previously reported by TCA, Uzbekistan has far surpassed Kazakhstan in direct air routes to key countries; from Tashkent, one can even fly to New York, which remains an elusive dream for Kazakhstanis. In 2011, Air Astana approached Boeing regarding the purchase of three 787 Dreamliner aircraft. However, when approached by TCA in August 2024, Air Astana stated that \"since 2011, there have been several macroeconomic, global changes, which affected the market situation, and the timing of aircraft deliveries has been revised, including delays on the part of the manufacturer.\" Safety In July of this year, a landmark event for the aviation industry occurred when President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev vowed to open the Permanent Mission of Kazakhstan to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This was another step towards introducing advanced standards in the aviation industry, and a decision which is in line with the trend of removing all restrictions for domestic carriers on flights to the European Union from Kazakhstan. The issue was discussed at a meeting of the EU Flight Safety Committee, with the participation of representatives of the aviation authorities of 27 countries. Unfortunately, however, cases of safety violations in civil aviation in Kazakhstan are not decreasing. According to the Bureau of National Statistics, in 2023 there were 58 accidents in air transportation, compared to 47 in the previous year. In the last month alone, three incidents involving damage to planes occurred at Astana Airport alone. The causes were weather conditions, as well as the actions of the air harbor operator. Fortunately, there were no casualties. One of the most hotly debated problems in the aviation industry for many years has been the issue of construction in areas surrounding airports. Law enforcement are now taking measures to bring these areas into compliance. According to data from the Aviation Administration of Kazakhstan, in 2023, during an inspection by the General Prosecutor's Office, it was revealed that within the boundaries of airport safety zones, local executive bodies had allocated approximately 1,200 plots for the construction of residential, commercial and other facilities, on which more than 900 buildings have been erected. Over 100,000 different structures have been built within the territory of airfields without the approval of airport commissions (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.). The cities of Almaty, Shymkent, Atyrau, and Aktobe have seen the most serious cases of illegal construction. In order to establish clear requirements for the use of airfield territories, legislative amendments have since been introduced regarding the procedure for granting rights to plots located on such land. Air geography The air transportation market in Kazakhstan is growing: 8.3 million passengers traveled by air between January-July 2024. This constitutes a 14% growth when compared to the same period in the previous year. Airlines in Kazakhstan purchased eleven new aircraft last year, which increased the capacity of their fleets by 28% to around 15,400 seats. From Kazakhstan today, it is possible to fly to 28 countries on 121 routes with a frequency of 567 flights per week. The largest number of flights is in the direction of the Russian Federation (139 flights per week on 31 routes), Turkey (125 flights per week on 18 routes), the United Arab Emirates (58 flights per week on six routes), and the People's Republic of China (43 flights per week on nine routes). Flights to Vietnam, Thailand, Egypt, and Georgia have also increased significantly. The deployment of the “Open Skies” policy will also continue. The National Development Plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2029, recently signed by the Head of State, states that liberalization of the air transportation market based on the EU's experience will facilitate the emergence of new low-cost airlines, which will be able to compete effectively with national carriers. Recently, representatives from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) arrived in Kazakhstan to conduct a technical review into the long-mooted possibility of opening direct flights to the United States. If the FAA audit is successful and long-haul airliners are delivered to Kazakhstan, direct flights between the U.S. and Kazakhstan will be launched in 2025. Take-off points and stumbling blocks During the years since independence, a total of 22 airports have had runways constructed and reconstructed, and 16 airports have had passenger terminals constructed and reconstructed. The erection of new passenger terminals at Shymkent and Kyzylorda airports is being finalized. Modernization of air harbors is carried out at the expense of private investors. For many years, experts have been calling attention to a shortage of aviation fuel in the domestic market and its exorbitant cost as one of the major constraints to the development of the civil aviation industry. For this reason, domestic airports are losing out to those in neighboring countries in terms of attracting and servicing transit companies. The production capacity of domestic refineries does not cover the demand for jet fuel, and it is therefore necessary to import fuel from neighboring Russia. In order to solve this problem, it would be necessary to increase the production of jet fuel, thus eliminating the dependence on imports. In addition to the aforementioned, there remains the long-standing personnel problem. About 20,000 people in Kazakhstan work in the aviation industry, and the need for additional staff (500-600 annually) is continuing to grow. The Civil Aviation Academy is the only higher education institution for aviation which trains personnel in the Republic of Kazakhstan and Central Asia. However, graduates of this institution are not in demand due to its non-compliance with ICAO standards and other international requirements. Therefore, aviation enterprises are forced to train personnel independently. Without a systematic solution to these issues, it will be difficult to approach the tasks set for the industry by the National Development Plan, according to which Kazakhstan should become a regional aviation hub. This stipulates the urgent need for the introduction of a flexible tariff system, further development of the network of regional airports and the country's aviation infrastructure, and ensuring favorable conditions for attracting specialized human resources, and optimizing customs procedures for transit cargo."
