        "text": "In a move to bolster its energy sector, the Government of Kazakhstan has unveiled plans to ramp up oil supplies along the Trans-Caspian route, aiming to reach 3 mn tons within the next two years. This strategic initiative is part of Kazakhstan's broader commitment to fortify its oil and gas industry, modernize electricity infrastructure, and enhance renewable energy capacity.\n\nMajor expansion projects are already underway at key oil fields, including Tengiz, Karachaganak, and Kashagan. The throughput capacity of the Kazakhstan section of the CPC pipeline has been substantially increased from 54 to 72.5 mn tons per year. The first oil supplies have commenced along the Trans-Caspian route, and authorities are determined to scale up this volume to 3 mn tons over the next two years.\n\nSimultaneously, the Shymkent oil refinery is undergoing expansion efforts, with its capacity set to double from 6 to 12 mn tons annually. This increase aims to meet the growing demands of the domestic fuel and lubricants market.\n\nGas production is also on the rise, with successful operations at the Rozhkovskoye, South Aksai, and Anabay fields, boasting recoverable reserves exceeding 31 bn cubic meters. The launch of the Urikhtau Central, Western Prorva, and Kalamkas gas fields is anticipated in the medium term, contributing an additional 69 bn cubic meters of recoverable gas reserves.\n\nTo support the petrochemical industry's growth, a $1bn Butadiene project is set to commence construction this year. Concurrently, ongoing large-scale investment projects, totaling $13.7bn, are progressing for the production of polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and urea in the Atyrau and Aktobe regions.\n\nIn the electric power sector, Kazakhstan is committed to eliminating shortages and creating advanced capacity for the economy. In 2023, approximately 500 MW of capacity was commissioned, and a further 825 MW is scheduled for commissioning in 2024 through 14 projects, including 12 focused on renewable energy, with a combined capacity of 260 MW.\n\nThe construction of thermal power plants with flexible generation modes is underway in the Turkestan, Almaty, and Kyzylorda regions. Plans include the modernization of the 3rd and 4th power units at Ekibastuz GRES-2 and the construction of a new GRES-3. New thermal power plants are also in the pipeline for Kokshetau, Semey, and Ust-Kamenogorsk.\n\nKazakhstan is actively collaborating with strategic investors, including Total, Masdar, Acwa Power, and Unigreen Energy, to implement renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 4 GW, marking a substantial leap towards a more sustainable and diverse energy portfolio."
