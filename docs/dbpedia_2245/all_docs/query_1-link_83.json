        "text": "The performed analysis of the geological and geophysical data of the subsalt complex on the eastern side of the Caspian basin allows us to look with optimism at the exploration possibilities of new areas at great depths.\n\nHigh prospects may be associated with organogenic constructions of the inner parts of the paleobasin. In addition, of particular interest is the search for lithological and stratigraphic types of reservoirs, which have not been properly studied.\n\nBased on the results of the previous works performed at the studied oil field, a significant potential for increasing initial oil reserves was established. Three wells were drilled in the edge zone of the field at the end of 2019, which confirmed the potential in the undrilled area of the northern flank of the filed. Until these wells were drilled, the edge zone was considered unpromising.\n\nThe authors have been tasked to assess perspectives of development of edge zones and build a detailed geological model for that area. The detailed model is intended to forecast the evolution of elements of the fluvial system for based on drilling data and results of seismic researches in undrilled parts of field.\n\nIn order to forecast the distribution zones of channel complexes, high-resolution 3D seismic data of 2019 were used. Based on the dynamic analysis, interpretation of the distribution zones of channel complexes and their classification within the studied reservoir layer were performed. The main focus was on identifying and mapping of small channels in the boundary zone of the reservoir with the aim of further detailed geological modeling and assessment of the development potential, taking into account new data.\n\nThe article describes a method for training a convolutional neural network for rock lithology recognition based on images of core material. High Resolution (Hi-Res) photos were used for training models. The principles of convolutional neural networks and their practical application in geology are considered. As an outcome of this work, the model of neural networks for recognizing rock lithology was created and applied in practice using a smartphone. It was established that many ML and DL technologies potentially can be applicable for oil and gas industry.\n\nDue to reducing volumes of light oil reserves, oil companies are increasingly focusing on hard-to-recover reserves, in particular, deposits with high-viscosity oil. Shallow-lying oil deposits are mainly concentrated in the Cretaceous horizons, in the western region of the country, along the Caspian coast. One of them is a highly viscous oil reservoir, consisting of 3 Cretaceous horizons of the Moldabek Vostochny section of Kenbai field, where 54.5 million tons of oil are concentrated, of which 19.5 million tons are recoverable. The current produced reserves makes up 5% of the initial recoverable reserves, and the approved design oil recovery factor implies the full-scale application of thermal oil recovery enhancement methods. The aim of this work is to select the most suitable method of thermal impact and assess the prospects for implementation with the calculation of economic feasibility. Taking into account the geological features of the reservoir, the cyclic treatment of the wells was chosen as the optimal method for increasing oil recovery. According to the results of calculations on the hydrodynamic model, the starting production rates using the technology of steam-cyclic treatment of producing wells are 2–3 times higher than the production rates for “cold production”: the difference in accumulated\n\nproduction over 5 years will be 20–30%.\n\nThis article analyzes the impact of an actual trajectory of a J-Type directional well with an early kick-off point on the values of torque and drag along the bore hole.\n\nThe actual data collected while drilling the directional SU-2 well with a target depth of 5000 m (South Urikhtau field) was used for the analysis: trajectory survey data results of the well, actual bottom hole assemblies applied (dimensions, material and characteristics of the elements), the actual drilling mud parameters according the control acts, actual drilling parameters according the daily drilling reports and mud logging curves, etc.\n\nCalculations of torque and drag were performed on a specialized software Landmark, a comparative analysis was carried out with the design values of parameters and appropriate recommendations were issued.\n\nThe article describes a unified approach to the assessment of resources and business planning. As an example, the paper considers oil and gas resources of the Pechora Sea. Based on the specifics of the problem (the quantity and quality of the available data and their nature), the methods of multicriteria fuzzy clusterization are used. The assessment of the prospects for the development of oil and gas fields was carried out using 3 criteria, namely: availability of resources (natural and climatic conditions of the region); hydrocarbon resources and their degree of exploration; economic assessment of the development. The results of such an analysis are presented in the form of maps of the Pechora Sea area, illustrating the most important and accessible areas and the sequence of their development. Such a stepwise development based on minimizing the risk and maximizing the benefits can be the basis for the successful and troublefree development of the resources of the entire region.\n\nThis article presents «geochemical atlas of oil» for 18 fields of Embamunaigas JSC based on the results of fingerprinting carried out in the Central Scientific Research Laboratory (CSRL) of the Atyrau branch of KMG Engineering LLP. This type of geochemical analysis allows to classify oil by chemical composition and provides additional information on productive pay zones and fields. To carry out the study, high-tech equipment and modern tools for data interpretation were applied. The data obtained can be used to deal with issues during field development and orient the areas of prospecting, evaluation and exploration work to promising oil and gas complexes. The article summarizes the results of geochemical studies of Embamunaigas fields and presents further vision for geological exploration.\n\nTraditional approaches for justification the properties of reservoir oil, used in calculating reserves often lead to errors in estimation of reserves and the impossibility of high-quality modeling and forecasts of hydrocarbon production.\n\nThe article gives examples where the method of averaging the properties of reservoir oil has led to errors in estimating the reserves of reservoir oil and dissolved gas. To qualitatively substantiate the properties of reservoir oil, methods based on physical parameter correlations should be used. Article also provides criteria for dividing the fluid into regions, which must be taken into account when analyzing the data, as well as tools for checking the quality of the received parameters.\n\nNowadays water-soluble polymers play a significant role in many branches of science and can be used as flocculants for wastewater treatment, as well as biocidal materials for inhibiting the growth of corrosive microorganisms, in particular against sulphate-reducing bacteria. The objects of research are synthesized new polymeric surfactants (poly-surfactants) – copolymers of N, N-dimethyl-N, N-diallylammonium chloride with N – [(3-trimethylamino) propyl]methacrylamide (DMDAAH –TMAPMA). The molar composition and structure of the synthesized copolymers were proved by methods of conductometric titration, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy."
