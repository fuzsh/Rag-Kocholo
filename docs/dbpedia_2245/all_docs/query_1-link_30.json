May 10 (Interfax) - JV KazGerMunai LLP, a joint venture of KazMunaiGas and PetroKazakhstan Kumkol Resources, has started operations at the Aksai Yuzhny gas condensate field in the Kyzylorda region, the KazMunaiGas press service reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe active phase of the project's development has begun, which will increase gas supplies for residents of the Kyzylorda region from 200 to 300 mcm per year.\n\nIn addition, by the end of 2023, KMG intends to start supplying gas from the Rozhkovskoye field in West Kazakhstan.\n\n\"In the medium term, in 2024-2025, the plan is to launch supplies from the Central Urikhtau field in the Aktobe region, which will provide an additional 1 bcm of gas per year. In addition, we expect to produce 2.1 bcm of marketable gas from the Kalamkas fields in the Mangistau region and Zapadnaya Prorva in the Atyrau region by 2027-2030. All this will allow KMG to additionally ensure the supply of about 6 bcm of gas for the domestic market through 2030,\" the report says.\n\nKazMunaiGas and PetroKazakhstan Kumkol Resources each owns a 50% stake in KazGerMunai. The joint venture has licenses for the development of, and production from, three oil fields in the South Turgai basin: Akshabulak, Nuraly and Aksai.\n\nThe shareholders of the PetroKazakhstan group are China's CNPC and KazMunaiGas.
