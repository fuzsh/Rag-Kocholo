        "text": "Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, China has significantly increased its economic presence in Central Asia thanks to leading Chinese institutions such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI), and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank AIIB. Now on the course, China is one of the most significant partners for Central Asian states. China has opened up to private business and foreign investment. State-owned banks turned saving into financing infrastructure facilities such as roads and rail links. Foreign firms were asked to set up alongside a local partner, encouraging to transfer of technology. For decades, as a result, China's economy has grown. This paper will focus on Kazakhstan as a case country in Central Asia. Diplomatic ties between Astana and Beijing developed shortly after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, with both countries moving on to co-found the Shanghai five, which later turned into the SCO. From Kazakhstan's point of view, the country's geopolitical situation leaves it no choice but to cooperate with Russia and China, Kazakhstan's two most potent and closest neighbors. Currently, Kazakhstan's strategy provides the path to China's economic outreach, while Beijing's growing investments provide Kazakhstan's path to modernization. Kazakhstan and China have extended their diplomatic ties since 1991, and since the launch of the BRI in 2013, they even furthered their economic relations are thriving. Financial integration is vital to supporting the BRI; therefore, the AIIB was established. Along with the significant growing economic influence, two main challenges require feasible solutions one is the Russian reaction to China's growing economic presence, and the other is the anti-Chinese sentiment that causes demonstrations in Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan's regional position, its “neighborhood factor,” is more than just a historical and geographical fact (“we didn't choose our neighbors”), but a situation in which both opportunities and limitations are present. Kazakhstan's immediate neighborhood becomes more than important in over-coming its continental landlockedness, turning geographical limitations into opportunities for successful economical development. This has far-reaching economic and social effects for the entire Eurasian region given recent interstate conflicts between neighboring post-Soviet states. The paper reviews the specifics of Kazakhstan's relations with each of its neighbors in terms of both the opportunities and the constraints (economic, political and social) they present. The significance of each of the five neighbors (China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan) to Kazakhstan, as well as their economic and political well-being, are analyzed. Finally, some potential strategies Kazakhstan may pursue to foster mutually beneficial relations with these countries are suggested.\n\nBy focusing on the impact of Chinese engagement in Uzbekistan, this article promotes an understanding of the motivations of CA states such as Uzbekistan in strategically engaging China. Although China’s BRI initiative has received wide coverage, few details of other Chinese projects and their impacts have been made available and analyzed. In this sense, this article aims to fill-in this gap by outlining the latest project details of Chinese engagement and their impact in this region."
