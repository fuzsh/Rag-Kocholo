With a staggering 5 GW of untapped #hydropower potential, the region is poised to reduce its reliance on #LNG imports. The draft RUPTL 2024-2033 outlines an ambitious plan, allocating 586 MW of hydropower for North Sumatra and 1,200 MW for scattered projects across Sumatra. This strategic move not only promises enhanced electricity access for Aceh and North Sumatra but also opens up significant opportunities for private sector involvement in energy infrastructure.

Located in South Sumatra, this project is set to boost Indonesia’s Natural Gas production with an estimated capacity of 135 million cubic feet per day. The KBD field, part of the Sakakemang production sharing contract, includes the installation of a central processing facility, CO2 and produced water pipelines, and the drilling of two new production wells. This development underscores Repsol’s commitment to advancing Indonesia’s Energy sector, with first Gas expected by early 2028. 🚀💼 To learn more about this development, click the link in the comments below! ⬇️ #OilAndGas #EnergySector #Indonesia #Repsol #SynergyEngineering #NaturalGas #EnergyDevelopment #FEEDContract #GasProduction #SoutheastAsiaEnergy\n\nThe #InternationalPtX Hub, funded by PNUD Mauritanie, has conducted four pivotal trainings on renewable energy and renewable Power-to-X, in Mauritania. These sessions took place from 6 to 15 May and included around 60 decision-makers from the Ministry of Petroleum, Mines and Energy - Mauritania . The EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) Mauritania hosted one of the trainings. #Mauritania is one of the most promising countries in Africa to produce low-cost green hydrogen and renewable PtX. Here is why: ➡Optimal conditions: Excellent hybrid sites with high wind and solar potential ➡Strategic location: Proximity to European markets enhances export potential ➡Established mining industry: Opportunities for green steel and iron ore production, supporting domestic #defossilisation and economic growth ➡Government initiative: Several giga-watt scale export projects announced for #greenhydrogen, ammonia, and direct reduced iron ➡Challenges: Infrastructure, water scarcity, and workforce skills In terms of outcomes, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Petroleum, Mines and Energy - Mauritania , Mr. Ahmed Salem Ould Bouhedda, highlighted the sector’s strategic importance and its potential for economic and social transformation. Additionally, the participants emphasised the need for more renewable PtX trainings.

With energy the priority sector for development in Uganda, her policy on local content is unlocking many attractive opportunities for international business and investment with drilling underway at both of the country’s two commercial oil development areas - the Kingfisher and Tilenga production projects, and progression is on track for first oil production in 2025. According to the Uganda Investment Authority, the oil and gas sector has significant potential to contribute to inclusive growth in the country as it is expected to bring in investments of between US$15 to US$20 billion in the next three to five years. The summit, which featured various panel sessions and photo sessions with Prime Minister of Uganda, Rt. Hon. Robinah Nabbanja, also had an international exhibition to showcase capabilities of African players in the energy, oil and gas industry.\n\n𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐉𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐄𝐠𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐧-𝐄𝐮𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐂𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐨 𝐨𝐧 𝐉𝐮𝐧𝐞 𝟐𝟗-𝟑𝟎! 🇪🇬🇪🇺 Prime Minister Dr. Mostafa Madbouly witnessed the signing of a landmark agreement for a green ammonia production project in Damietta. This project, involving the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company, Misr Fertilizers Production Company (MOPCO), Norway's Scatec, and Yara, represents a major step forward in sustainable energy and investment. The project, with an initial investment cost of around $890 million, aims to produce up to 150,000 tons of green ammonia annually. It will generate renewable energy with a total capacity of 480 megawatts from wind and solar power. The green ammonia produced will be secured by a long-term agreement with Norway's Yara. In addition to the green ammonia plant, the project scope includes the construction of a seawater desalination plant and a marine jetty for exporting green ammonia from Damietta Port, with operations expected to commence in 2027. This initiative is a significant part of Egypt's energy sector strategy, aiming to enhance the use of new and renewable energy sources, reduce carbon emissions, and establish Egypt as a green hydrogen hub. The state has provided numerous incentives and advantages to attract further investment in this promising sector. The foundation of the project company, Damietta Green Ammonia Company, marks the first company to be established electronically in Egypt, with the shareholders' agreement signed in December 2023. We're proud to be part of this innovative step towards a sustainable future! #GreenEnergy #ikshanh #echem #hydrogen #SustainableDevelopment #AmmoniaProduction #Egypt #Investment #RenewableEnergy #Innovation\n\nThe ministerial panel this morning featured key insights on the growth of climate-focused projects in the Southeast Asian region, as H.E.
