        "text": "Ural Oil & Gas LLP - shaping the energy sustainability Celebrating a significant milestone in Kazakhstan's energy sector, the commencement of gas production at the Rozhkovskoye field underscores the nation's commitment to strategic partnerships and sustainable development. This achievement, a result of collaborative efforts between KazMunayGas, MOL Group and SINOPEC signifies a potent blend of international expertise and regional investment. With $534 million invested in the project to date, it not only propels Kazakhstan towards energy self-sufficiency but also contributes significantly to the national and local budgets. The project's socio-economic impact extends beyond revenue streams, with a commitment to allocate 1% of investments for local personnel training and over 3.1 billion tenge for regional development. This collaborative endeavor serves as a testament to Kazakhstan's proactive engagement in 12 promising geological survey projects alongside international partners. It reinforces the country's position as a key player in the global energy arena. Looking ahead, Kazakhstan envisions a dynamic landscape with multiple gas projects in the pipeline, including Urikhtau Centralnyi, Zapadnaya Prorva, and Kalamkas. Chairman of the Board of JSC NC KazMunayGas Magzum Mirzagaliyev, Vice President of MOL Group Zsombor Marton from Budapest and Chairman of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production Corporation Guo Yueliang from Beijing participated in the ceremony in a videoconference format.\n\nENERGY Review, Learnings from ADIPEC 2023 - The UK's offshore energy sector could spend about $250 billion by 2030 on managing oil and gas production effectively and on initiatives that reduce carbon emissions - Norway's production of oil and gas could peak by 2025 because the country focuses more on gas production. - Three key UK projects are awaiting investment decisions by 2024: RoseBank, Cambo, and Clair Phase 3. - USA Shale reinvestment is at a 3 year high, Texas Crude oil production reached a record high of 5mbpd. - Saudi Arabia and Russia (OPEC+) will extend oil supply cuts until December 2023. The Saudis will cut 1 million barrels per day and the Russians will cut 0.3 million barrels per day - Crude oil prices could reach $100 per barrel by 2024 if supply cuts continue - OPEC expects the Oil demand to grow by another 2.2 Million bpd Vs 2023 lead by China, India and Middle east. - In an attempt to reduce Carbon emission and with the vision to become Net Zero by 2045, ADNOC announced final investment decision to develop one of the largest Carbon Capture project in the Middle east. The Habshan Carbon Capture Project will have capacity to permanently store 1.5 million tons of CO2 deep underground - For every One US$ spent on Fossil fuels, now about US$1.7 is going to renewable energy. The ratio was 1:1 in 2017 - Currently, it cannot be Oil & Gas Vs renewables, we need both to contribute together to meet the growing energy demand. Stopping Oil & gas investment would bring global economies to grinding halt.\n\nMubadala Energy announces 'substantial' offshore gas find in Indonesia Mubadala Energy, the oil and gas unit of Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company, on Monday announced a “substantial” gas discovery off Indonesia. The discovery was made from the Tangkulo-1 exploration well, which was drilled in South Andaman, about 65km offshore from North Sumatra, Mubadala Energy said in a statement. Despite limitations imposed by testing facilities, the well's estimated capacity is between 80 million to 100 million standard cubic feet a day and more than 2,000 barrels of condensate, the company said. Mubadala Energy’s latest find follows the company's major deep-sea gas reserve discovery in Indonesia's South Andaman block last year. Coal consumption is projected to fall by 2.3 per cent in 2026, driven by a major expansion of renewable energy capacity in the next three years, the agency said in its annual coal market report in December. https://lnkd.in/gWuwd53P\n\nAzule Energy secures operatorship for three additional offshore blocks in Angola through risk service contracts with the National Agency for Oil, Gas, and Biofuels. The 8,700-sq-km area in the Lower Congo Basin includes Blocks 46, 47, and 18/15. Azule, aiming for exploration and leveraging existing facilities, holds interests in partnership with Equinor and Sonangol P&P. CEO Adriano Mongini emphasises the potential for new plays in Block 18/15. AVEVA supports Azule with digital initiatives for cost reduction and improved safety. This marks Azule's second licence since its formation in August 2022.

This well reached a depth of 3400 meters in waters 1200 meters deep. This comes shortly after Mubadala's substantial discovery at the Layaran-1 well within the South Andaman PSC. Layaran is estimated to contain over 6 trillion cubic feet of gas, with some industry sources hinting at even larger quantities. This underscores Indonesia's LNG capabilities and highlights the ongoing discoveries in ultra-deepwater settings, emphasizing the critical importance of mastering offshore seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation."
