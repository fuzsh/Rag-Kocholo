        "text": "According to all companies who can came to Iran and could cooperation with Iranian company. Subject: Request for cooperation Dear All PEDCO is approved by the Iranian Ministry of Petroleum as a qualified E&P company to join partnership with international oil firms in developing oil and gas projects. Purpose: We wish to set out in this Letter of Intent (LOI) a proposed joint venture in the field of 2D AND 3D Seismic exploration oil and gas. We aim to establish a PROPORTION joint venture to achieve our mutual best interests. While we recognize that various arrangements will require careful review, both parties will endeavor in good faith to agree on the detailed terms of the joint venture based on the principles outlined in this LOI. Our goal is to take all necessary actions successfully to establish the joint venture. There are many projects and opportunities in the field of geophysics and seismic for oil and gas exploration. We are currently bidding for three projects. If you are owner of recording equipment and vibrators and skilled Expert personnel, you are invited to cooperate with PEDCO for the next steps. Feel free to tailor this document to your specific needs, and I wish you success in your joint venture endeavors!\n\n\"Second gas discovery in a row in #BarentsSea region east of #Wisting field.\" \"A second consecutive gas discovery has been made in Norway’s #BarentsSea waters in the same area as the planned development of the very large #Wisting oil and gas discovery. The well on the #Hassel prospect has a preliminary recoverable resource estimate of between 3.23 million and 4.42 million barrels of oil equivalent, according to the Norwegian Offshore Directorate.\" https://lnkd.in/geXJwsS7\n\nPROBLEM: Understanding Conventional vs Unconventional Oil and Gas CONTEXT: Exploring the differences in resource extraction methods REASON: To make informed decisions in the industry BODY: - Conventional resources occur in discrete accumulations or pools. - They are developed using vertical well bores. - Unconventional resources require horizontal well bores and hydraulic fracturing. - Conventional pools are categorized based on trapping mechanisms. - Prior to 2006, conventional pools were the primary exploration targets. - British Columbia has abundant conventional oil and gas resources. - Unconventional resources have low permeability and porosity. - They require multistage hydraulic fracturing for economic production. - Virtually all wells in the province are now classified as unconventional. SUMMARY: Understanding the differences between conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction methods is crucial for informed decision-making in the industry.\n\nLifecycle of an Oil & Gas Field: -Exploration -Appraisal -Development -Production -Decommissioning Exploration is about finding the oil and gas fields. The main goal is to identify and deliver commercially viable field development opportunities. Appraisal involves surveying and obtaining information about reservoirs in order to decide whether or not to proceed with the development of a field. Development involves assessing the production and process facilities and constructing the production platform. Production is targeted at bringing well, fluids to the surface and preparing them for use in a refinery or processing plant. Decommissioning happens at the end of a life of a field when it’s no longer economic for the operator to continue production. By: Esveraldo Galiano.\n\nIndia offers numerous opportunities for 2D-3D seismic surveys in the oil and gas exploration processing interpretation business. With approximately 200,000 SQKM of offshore and onshore projects, there is a significant demand for companies that can provide high-quality and timely work. The absence of offshore exploration processing and interpretation companies in India further emphasizes the need for reliable and efficient service providers. By establishing a reputable company in this sector, you can contribute to the growth and development of the industry. With a focus on delivering quality work within specified timelines, your company can become a trusted partner for oil and gas exploration projects in India. By leveraging advanced technologies and experienced professionals, you can ensure accurate data interpretation and efficient processing. Furthermore, by maintaining strong communication and collaboration with clients, you can establish long-term relationships and secure a steady flow of projects. Building a reputation for reliability, professionalism, and excellence will be crucial in establishing your company as a leader in the industry. India's vast potential for oil and gas exploration presents an exciting opportunity for companies willing to invest in this sector. By providing top-notch services, you can contribute to the growth of the industry while reaping the benefits of a thriving market."
