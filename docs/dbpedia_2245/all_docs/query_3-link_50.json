        "text": "The gas export pipeline will eventually connect the FPSO P-57 in the deepwater Jubarte field to the Petrobras onshore installation in Anchieta, Espirito Santo. Offshore pipeline installation will take place during 2009, and he project is planned for completion during 2010. The engineering and project management work will be conducted at the contractor’s office at Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, and the fabrication of the rigid pipeline will be carried out at its spoolbase at Ubu in Brazil. The Jubarte Field, discovered in 2001, is located about 80km off the Espirito Santo State coast, SE Brazil, in water depths of between 1,000 and 1,500m.\n\nThe TAP project envisages transportation of about 30bn cum/yr of gas from the Dauletabad gasfields in SE Turkmenistan to consumers in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and possibly India. The cost of the project is estimated at about $3.3 billion, and the project is expected to take about five years to implement, after the co-operating countries and other partners finally agree on the project parameters (political and otherwise).\n\nThe heads of state of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan met in Islamabad on 29-30 May, 2002, and decided to cooperate on project implementation. A steering committee consisting of the oil and gas ministers from the three countries was established to follow-up and supervise project development. At its first meeting, on 9-10 July, 2002, at Ashgabat, the steering committee requested the ADB to be a development partner. The bank subsequently agreed to finance an initial techno-economic feasibility study to cover pipeline routeing, preliminary design, cost estimates, and rapid environmental impact assessment, and to assess volume-price sensitivity. ADB also agreed to carry out a market study on demand for natural gas in Pakistan and northern India, and a risk analysis and risk mitigation study on concerns of gas-consuming countries and of consumers in case gas supply is disrupted along its route.\n\nThe project is seen as being able significantly to boost the economies of the countries involved, and to increase political stability and improve living standards in Central and South Asia. This pioneering effort to link the gas-rich Central Asian economies with the energy-deficient economies of South Asia is also the first attempt to find an outlet for gas from Central Asia to new markets in the East. However, those involved in the project realization are aware that it faces significant political and technical challenges. Nevertheless, the steering committee has already met nine times, and the participating\n\ncountries have exhibited a strong spirit of co-operation and determination to advance the project.\n\nOne of the driving forces behind the development of Corr MD was a study conducted by DNV CCT and NACE International on the enormous cost of corrosion in the US. The study estimated that corrosion is costing pipeline operators a breathtaking $7 billion/year. Acknowledging this reality, the pipeline industry has long been asking for an integrated decision tool that can manage corrosion data and data for integrity assessments.\n\nOperators need to know what information to collect in order to ensure that corrosion activities, such as monitoring and mitigation, are managed properly. The new tool provides both guidance for collecting the data, and directions for proper usage and data management. DNV CCT points out that – unlike current risk-management and corrosion-assessment tools – its new process is able to manage information from a multitude of corrosion-monitoring and test results, including gas analysis, coupon monitoring, liquid composition, pig residues, inhibitor and biocide use, operational conditions, etc. The tool includes interactive data entry forms, and can be used both as a stand-alone application and with network-wide usage, providing centralized data management with multi-user access. It also offers tiered security levels and image-storing capacity, and is compliant with Pipeline Open Data Standard (PODS), Orbit+Pipeline, and other industry-recognized risk- and integrity-management systems.\n\nThe first release of the program focuses on internal corrosion management, but subsequent releases will target key integrity tools required for corrosion management, activity planning, and budgeting.\n\nPUMPING 1,800cum/hr of diesel and gasoline 75m uphill through two pipelines each 650m long, from a marine off-loading point into nine storage tanks with a combined capacity exceeding 60,000cum is quite a standard task around the world. What makes this installation at Hvalfjordur in Iceland different is that instead of using a steel pipeline, the fuel will be pumped through 12-in diameter UPP Extra high-density polyethylene pipe supplied by PetroTechnik of Ipswich, UK (see photo).\n\nInstallation of the 1,500m of HDPE pipe at the coastal site just north of the capital Reykjavik was undertaken by fuel distribution and service company Oliudreifing ehf.\n\nWhen the design work began, steel would have been the natural choice for the underground pipe; however, in this case two factors modified that choice. Steel pipe was in short supply around the world, meaning high prices and long lead times, and Oliudreifing had experience of working with PetroTechnik Ltd since its first collaboration in 1999. As Arni Ingimundarson, Technical Manager at Oliudreifing put it: “We first used UPP Extra in 1999 when we refurbished the 6-in fuel lines at our Patreksfjordur depot. Over the past eight years we have enjoyed a leak-free and maintenance-free existence. With a life expectancy in excess of 50 years, we expect to reap the benefits of non-corroding polyethylene pipe for many more years to come.”\n\nThrough its subsidiaries Texas Gas Transmission and Gulf South Pipeline Co, Boardwalk operates over 21,450km of interstate gas pipelines in the southern and central United States, and the company’s underground storage fields have a total working gas capacity of approximately 143Bcf (see map).\n\n“We are pleased that Skip is joining Synergy as head of sales and marketing at this key period in our growth,” Mark Mattox, president of Synergy Services, said. “Skip’s broad experience, particularly in the oil and gas industry, strengthens our ability to capitalize on the unprecedented opportunities in all of our market sectors.”\n\nSynergy is a leading provider of a wide range of vertically-integrated asset-management services to the oil, gas, and industrial market sectors that includes pipeline management services, turnkey pipeline cleaning, production and specialty chemicals, energy and water management, hydrotesting, vessel cleaning and data management services. Synergy’s patented Powdersolv has become an industry standard for safely eliminating black powder (ferrous pipeline debris) in natural gas pipelines and ‘rouge’ in product and crude systems.\n\n“We plan to begin construction in second quarter 2008 to achieve an in-service date of fourth quarter 2009 in order to move the growing supply of Canadian crude oil to key US markets,” he continued.\n\nKeystone received Canada’s National Energy Board approval last year for two major regulatory applications to construct and operate the Canadian portion of the project. Applications for other US regulatory approvals at the state level are proceeding, and decisions are expected to be received imminently.\n\nFollowing the award of its final environmental impact statement, on 14 March the US Department of State issued the Presidential Permit to Keystone authorizing the construction, maintenance and operation of facilities at the US and Canada border to transport crude oil between the two countries.\n\nThe new 3,456-km pipeline will transport crude oil from Hardisty, Alberta, to US Midwest markets at Wood River and Patoka, Illinois, and to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Canadian portion of the project involves the conversion of 864km of the existing Mainline pipeline from gas to crude oil transmission, and construction of 373km of new pipeline, along with pump stations and terminal facilities at Hardisty. The US portion of the project includes construction of 2,219km of pipeline and pump stations. It is expected that, on start-up in late 2009, Keystone will be capable of delivering 435,000brl/d to Patoka; it is to be expanded to 590,000brl/d and extended to Cushing in late 2010.\n\nThe pipeline diameter will be 30in from Hardisty to Illinois, and 36in from the Nebraska/Kansas border to Cushing. The new sections of the pipeline will operate at 9930kPa (1,440psi), while the converted section will be operated at its current approved allowable operating pressure of 6,067kPa (880psi).\n\nThe acquisition is intended to enable WorleyParsons to accelerate Intec’s growth and at the same time secure for Heerema continuing access to leading engineering and project management capabilities. The acquisition also improves WorleyParsons’ position in the deepwater hydrocarbons market and complements the company’s existing capabilities to now provide services across the entire spectrum from subsea to export facilities.\n\nIntec – with offices in Houston, London, Delft, Kuala Lumpur, Perth, Rio de Janeiro and Lagos – is well known as a provider of engineering services to the offshore exploration and production, and transportation, sectors of the energy industry worldwide. Its technical expertise includes offshore field development, offshore pipelines, marine production risers, subsea and floating production systems, and flow assurance and operability.\n\nAs well as the overall management of the local contractors, Penspen’s services will include reviewing the technical feasibility study, route confirmation, preparation of the design basis, hydraulic studies, overall SCADA and telecommunications, GIS, and preparation of tender packages for the next phase. The planned Nabucco gas pipeline constitutes a dedicated gas transit and transportation pipeline from Turkey to Austria via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. The aim is to create a pipeline system for natural gas transmission from different sources in the Caspian Sea Region and the Middle East to Central Europe.\n\n“We have allocated three months for the creation of the company, and another 18 months for the feasibility study,” Gazprom’s spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told reporters in Belgrade. “We expect construction to start no later than 24 months after the feasibility study has been completed,” he added.\n\nThe $14.65-billion project being planned by Gazprom and Italy’s ENI is designed to carry 10bn cum/yr of gas to Western Europe. Transit fees could bring an annual $200 million to Serbia. Under the deal, Serbia has joined the South Stream project, and has allowed Gazprom to buy a controlling stake in the Serbian oil monopoly NIS, widely seen as a politically-motivated agreement in appreciation of Russia’s support for Serbia on the issue of Kosovo.\n\nOn 28 February, Russia also signed an agreement with Hungary on the new natural gas pipeline to supply Europe. This follows an agreement signed with Bulgaria earlier this year, leaving Romania as one of the only southern European countries still loyal to the Nabucco pipeline project, which has been a US and EU top priority.\n\nThe South Stream project will consist of two branches diverging from Bulgaria: one to run south through Greece and Italy, while the other will run northwards, passing through Serbia and Hungary.\n\nIndia imports about 70% of its oil, a dependence that may increase to over 91% by 2020. About 45% of present needs comes from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE) according to Indian Planning Commission figures, and if oil imports from other parts of the Middle East are included, the region accounts for about 67% of India’s oil imports.\n\nTurkey’s offer to India is seen to have considerable potential. The Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline, also known as the Trans-Israel pipeline or Tipline, has been functioning for several years. Built in 1968 to transport oil from Iran to Israel, it was latterly largely unused except to carry relatively-small quantities of Egyptian oil from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. The direction of the flow was reversed a few years ago when Russia began transporting oil through Israel to the Gulf of Aqaba and onwards to Asian markets.\n\nUsing the pipeline and the Gulf of Aqaba would let India’s supplies avoid the Suez canal route, with several advantages. Israeli ports, already supplied by super tankers, accommodate larger vessels than those that can pass through the Suez Canal, and tariffs for the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline are lower than those charged by Egypt for shipping through the Suez, itself a more congested route than the Gulf of Aqaba. Costs could fall further if a proposed subsea pipeline connecting Ceyhan with Israel goes ahead. Mr Babacan said in Delhi that a feasibility report on the project will be conducted soon.\n\nThe supply deal with Turkey would extend India’s links with both that country and with Israel. The Indian Oil Corporation has bought a 12.5% share in Botas’ Samsum-Ceyhan pipeline, while India’s ties with Israel have been significantly extended over the past decade or so.\n\nMr Odusina said Nigeria would be setting aside between 13 and 15tcf of gas for the project for the first 25 years.\n\nNigeria’s gas reserves are estimated at 184tcf, but industry officials have expressed doubt the country can produce adequate gas for TSGP given the current shortage of gas for domestic use. Mr Odusina confirmed, however, that gas for TSGP has been earmarked, and will be available. Chabib Khelil, Algeria’s Minister of Mines and Energy, said the three countries had the capacity to finance the project and said the European market would need the gas produced by TSGP by its start-up date.\n\nThe pipeline route will run for 330km south from the Mangala field to a pump station and oil take-off point at Viramgam. From Viramgam, the route continues for a further 261km southwestwards to Salaya. An 8-in diameter line will be laid alongside for transporting gas from the Raageshwari fields to the Salaya receiving facility, for fuelling the gas generator sets located at 32 sites along the route. These gas generator sets will primarily be used to power the heat-trace system in order to maintain the pumpability of the waxy crude.\n\nL&T’s Pipeline Engineering Centre L&T Gulf is located at Faridabad, and is a joint venture between L&T and Gulf Interstate of Houston. It will provide complete engineering services for the cross-country pipeline and the intermediate facilities for this project. Completion of this pipeline is anticipated by mid-2009.\n\nThe Perma-Pipe subsidiary of MFRI Inchas been chosen to provide the factory insulating and jacketing services for the pipeline. The $60-million pre-insulation contract will be carried out at a new Perma-Pipe facility to be located in Mundra, on the site of Jindal Saw Ltd, who will produce the linepipe for the project under a $200-million contract.\n\nThe main line will run for 4,843km from Khorgos in NW Xinjiang to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province. Its western segment is planned for operation by 2009, and the eastern segment would start by June 2011, according to Jiang Jiemin, general manager of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), woi is responsible for the pipeline’s construction.\n\nGas supplies for the new pipeline network will come mainly from two contracted fields in Turkmenistan, and will be supplied to civilians, public facilities and producers for combined heat and power generation. Two domestic gas regions – Tarim and Changqing – are understood to have resources be available for emergency supplies if there are problems in Turkmenistan.\n\nKazakhstan is a big oil producer but depends on gas imports from neighbouring countries such as Uzbekistan to generate electricity. Uzbekistan raised concern in southern Kazakhstan in January when it briefly cut flows due to higher domestic consumption.\n\nThe new 1500-km pipeline, which could be built by 2011, will connect Beineu in the west with Samsonovka in the south, and is expected to initially supply 5bn cum/yr of gas, increasing to 10bn cum/yr from 2014. However, some analysts have expressed doubt over the project’s feasibility due to Kazakhstan’s limited gas reserves, currently estimated at 2T cum.\n\nMr Masimov is reported as saying that the government had yet to decide how the project would be financed, going on to say that the government would also give state energy company KazMunaiGas a licence to develop the Urikhtau gas deposit with estimated reserves of 40bn cum.\n\n. Dana Gas and Emarat each have a 50% share in the construction, ownership and operation of the pipeline, and the first phase of the project was completed in May, 2006, and has since been delivering gas to the SEWA power station at Hamriyah.\n\nThe main pipeline of the joint Hamriyah gas pipeline project is a 32-km long, 48-in diameter gas pipeline that connects the Sharjah gas hub at Sajaa to the fast-growing industrial area at Hamriyah, with a capacity of 1bn cuft/d.\n\nUS ethanol output capacity has increased by over 45% to nearly 8bn gal/yr in the last 12 months as Washington offers producers millions of dollars in incentives. The new energy law of late last year calls for the blending of 36bn gal/yr of biofuels like ethanol by 2022. The pipeline from the Midwest could lower costs for both ethanol producers and consumers because sending fuel by pipe is cheaper than sending it by road, rail or barge, all of which are currently used for transporting ethanol from the Midwest to the coasts.\n\nHowever, pipelines have struggled to obtain new rights-of-way in recent years amid community opposition, but the proposed ethanol pipeline would link into an existing Buckeye right-of-way in Indiana that runs to New Jersey , according to a map of the proposed project. A spokesman for Magellan said obtaining rights-of-way from the agricultural states to Indiana should be feasible as it could benefit farmers. He said the pipeline could be built within three or four years, once the companies made a decision. Several hurdles would need to be cleared first, such as securing federal loan guarantees and ensuring that ethanol was taxed in the same way oil products are, he added.\n\nIn addition, experts have long said ethanol may corrode pipelines because it absorbs water. The companies are engaging in research with the US Department of Transportation and pipeline industry groups into ethanol stress-corrosion cracking on fuel ducts. Upon completion, the pipeline could have the capacity to supply about 4.5bn gal/yr from ethanol production facilities in Iowa , Illinois, Minnesota, and South Dakota to serve terminals in major markets such as Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York, the companies said.\n\nFrom Guararema, the pipeline route runs to the Sao Sebastiao terminal, on the Northern Coast of Sao Paulo and to the Ilha d’Agua terminal, in Rio de Janeiro, via the already existing OSRIO pipeline, which will now be used solely to transport ethanol. Between Paulinia and Guararema, the ethanol pipeline will be capable of transporting up to 12 million cum/yr of ethanol per year, around 4,000m cum/yr via the Ilha d’Agua terminal, and 8m cum/yr through the Sao Sebastiao terminal.\n\nThe Castoro Sei is one of the flagship vessels owned by the Italian oil and gas industry contractor, Saipem, a global leader in building subsea infrastructure. The vessel has been used on numerous construction projects around the world during the last 25 years, noteworthy being the Greenstream natural gas pipeline between Libya and Italy and the GME pipeline connecting Morocco and Spain.\n\nThe construction method will be by S-lay, which involves welding pipe sections of 12m horizontally and continuously feeding the jointed sections over the barge’s stinger in such a way that the pipeline forms an S shape from the barge’s exit-point up to the touchdown point on the seafloor. Overall, the construction process in shallow water (up to a depth of 550m) will last roughly four months. A second semi-submersible vessel, the Saipem 7000, will take on the pipelay operations in the deepwater areas (down to 2,160m) during this year’s third quarter. The pipeline is due for commissioning next year.\n\nThe final shipment of linepipe arrived in AlmerÌ_a on 8 February from Japan. The pipes, which were manufactured and coated by Japan’s two leading steel producers Mitsui and Sumitomo, were delivered in three shipments: the first arrived in Almeria in October, 2007, and the second in December, 2007. The pipes are coated with three layers of propylene for corrosion resistance, and those for the shallower water are additionally covered with a layer of concrete.\n\nThe total budget of the coating and logistics contract is about $953 million, around $100 million of will be used to establish the coating and logistics infrastructure around the Baltic Sea. The remaining budget covers raw materials, transhipment, and labour costs.\n\nThis decision on logistics made by Nord Stream represents an important step for the project’s efficient and timely implementation. To ensure that the pipes are properly coated by the time pipelaying starts, Nord Stream is making preparatory investments in the facilities and infrastructure needed for the coating, handling and storage of pipes in several locations.\n\nPrior to the tender, Nord Stream prepared a comprehensive logistics concept for implementing the pipeline project. To ensure the pipeline is laid in the most efficient manner possible, in terms of costs, timing and to protect the environment, a customized logistics’ infrastructure in the Baltic Sea region comprising weight coating plants, interim stock yards, and transshipment facilities is required. As Nord Stream is the first pipeline to be implemented in the region, with several other pipeline projects being planned, a logistics’ infrastructure still needs to be developed.\n\nWith the aim of minimizing transport distances, Nord Stream has assessed potential locations along the Baltic Sea coast that are technically feasible and environmentally viable. Kotka in the Gulf of Finland and Mukran on the German island of Rugen have been selected as the locations for concrete weight coating and interim stock yards. Slite on the island of Gotland in Sweden is selected as main interim stock yard. The port Hanko on the South of Finland and Karlshamn in Southern Sweden are envisaged as additional interim stock yards in order to reduce transport distances to less than 150km. EUPEC, as Nord Stream’s logistics’ partner, will hold further discussions with the relevant authorities at these locations about the facilities required to ensure delivery of comprehensive weight coating and logistics services.\n\nCurrently, the Phoenix area relies solely on the El Paso gas system, which has struggled to keep-up with rapidly-increasing demand, FERC noted.\n\nGas to be transported on the Transwestern expansion would come from Rocky Mountain and San Juan Basin production regions, and would be used primarily to fuel power plants around Phoenix. The expansion also is designed to increase gas supply reliability and flexibility for customers in central and southern Arizona.\n\nThe proposed pipeline is a 989-km long, 42-in diameter, pipeline with capacity of up to 1.2bn cuft/d. The project, which is proposed for service in 2011, would involve constructing the new line substantially parallel to the existing Williams Northwest Pipeline system between the Opal hub in Wyoming and Stanfield, Ore. Williams’ Northwest system interconnects at Stanfield with TransCanada’s Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) pipeline system.\n\nThe project provides the option to deliver gas to markets served by the Northwest and GTN pipeline systems. Sunstone’s open season will commence on 17 March and run until 30 April. GTN will hold an additional open season to offer existing capacity available on its pipeline system between Stanfield and its terminal near Malin, Ore., near California’s northern border.\n\nSYRIA’S Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Sufian Al-Alaw has confirmed that the Syrian Petroleum Co has completed work on the Arab gas pipeline in Syria, and that the pipeline is now ready to transport gas from Egypt through Jordan and to the terminals at Tishreen and Deir Ali. During a field visit to the gas-reception station on the Syrian-Jordanian border, Mr al-Alaw said that the Arab pipeline was connected to the Syrian gas network at Tishreen, and that the gas pressure was enough for calibration and tests, expressing hope that the Jordanian side will finalize work on the pipeline in Jordan within the coming weeks.\n\nMr Al-Alaw stressed the importance of gas in generating electricity as an efficient and nature-friendly source of energy, adding that the Syrian Petroleum Co will now begin work on the second stage of the Arab pipeline – from Aleppo to the Turkish border\n\n– estimating that work will take a year and a half to complete. He added that Egypt will pump 900m cum of gas to Syria within the first year, and that the amount will increase gradually to meet Syria’s increasing demand for gas.\n\nThe Arab gas pipeline is one of the most important Middle-Eastern projects, as it connects Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, transporting and marketing gas through these countries and to Turkey and Europe.\n\nEGL said the line would cost an estimated $2.2 billion, and is subject to a final investment decision in the second half of 2009. Its planned initial capacity is 10bn cum/yr from 2011 at the earliest, with the option to expand to 20bn cum/yr.\n\nStatoilHydro’s significance in the project is as the owner of a 25.5% stake in the Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan; the company is also the commercial operator of the South Caucasus pipeline which transports Shah Deniz gas to Turkey via Georgia. The parties involved in the Shah Deniz production-sharing agreement (PSA), which was signed in June, 1996 are: BP (operator – 25.5%), StatoilHydro (25.5%), the State Oil Co of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR – 10%), Lukoil (10%), NICO (10%), Total (10%), and TPAO (9%). Gas production from Shah Deniz commenced in December, 2006.\n\nLanka IOC (LIOC)is to extend its bunker business once new pipelines connecting the Colombo port with storage terminals are completed. The pipes are to be laid by common infrastructure firm Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd (CPSTL), which is jointly owned by LIOC, the state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and the Sri Lankan government. LIOC, a unit of Indian Oil Corp, started bunkering ship fuel in the eastern port of Trincomalee last year, but believes there is more potential in Colombo, LIOC managing director K. Ramakrishnan said. But Colombo’s port infrastructure needs to be upgraded so that other players can enter the market and challenge the dominance of the entrenched player, Lanka Marine Services (LMS), the former state monopoly now owned by the John Keells group.\n\nBunker suppliers need to be able to receive fuel and send it to tank farms north of the port for storage and then to deliver it back to vessels, Mr Ramakrishnan said. For this, there is a need to lay pipelines as the only fully-equipped land storage terminal now is the one owned by LMS. “For others to enter the market, the infrastructure should be improved for efficient delivery. The existing pipeline network needs to be revamped and new lines laid,” Mr Ramakrishnan said. The investment and work to lay new pipelines connecting the port with two major oil storage facilities is to be done CPSTL: under the project new pipelines will be laid to connect the port and the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela oil terminals north of the harbour, and 12 secondary depots. CPSTL has also proposed to lay a new submarine pipeline from Muthurajawela to a mooring bouy 5-6km offshore.\n\nThe 865-km cross border pipeline from the Temane gasfield to Sasol’s synfuels plant at Secunda, near Johannesburg began operations in February, 2004, when the first gas arrived at Secunda on 21st of the month. The capacity-expansion project primarily involves the installation of a new compressor station, including two new gas-turbine-driven compressor units and ancillary equipment to increase the pipeline gas flow rate, at Komatipoort in South Africa. The existing pressure protection system at Secunda will also be upgraded to accommodate the increased gas flows."
