In addition, the Board of Directors demanded details of a HSE incidents investigation procedure and to develop an activity plan to minimise the incidents in the KMG Group. The Board of Directors instructed the KMG Management Board to prepare an activity plan describing negative factors of the changed environment (COVID influence, falling oil prices, reduced gas export and resulting losses from supplies of gas to the domestic market), activities to respond to such factors, dates and involvement of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors takes active part in the handover of KazTransGas JSC to Samruk–Kazyna JSC, and in discussion of potential risks for KMG.\n\nDuring the quarterly discussion of the Risk Report, it was instructed to prepare suggestions to arrange a simulation of unknown risks and scenarios. The Board of Directors also instructed to analyse reputational risks and liquidity risks in view of the current fall of oil prices and risk management measures. The Board of Directors was informed how COVID influenced activities of KMG.\n\nWhen discussing financial and business performance reports of KMG, the Board of Directors instructed to identify reasons for the reduced net profit.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors weekly receive information about impact of COVID-19 on activities of the KMG Group.\n\nThe Board of Directors received the results of benchmarking for competitive analysis of the main indicators of KMG refineries and situation with employment in Zhanaozen.\n\nRemuneration policy\n\nRemuneration for the members of the KMG Board of Directors is established based on resolution of the Management Board of Samruk–Kazyna JSC as agreed with the member of the KMG Board of Directors.\n\nRemuneration of the members of the Board of Directors includes a fixed salary and extra remuneration.\n\nThe extra remuneration includes remuneration for chairing the Board of Directors, chairing a committee of the Board of Directors, participation in a committee of the Board of Directors, participation in a meeting initiated by the Chairman of the KMG Board of Directors and/or representative of the Samruk–Kazyna Management Board, Chairman of the KMG Management Board.\n\nOn August 17, 2020, Samruk Kazyna JSC resolved to pay only the fixed salary and extra remuneration for chairing the Board of Directors. This resolution cancelled the extra remuneration for chairing a committee of the Board of Directors, participation in a committee of the Board of Directors, participation in a meeting initiated by the Chairman of the KMG Board of Directors and/or representative of the Samruk Kazyna Management Board, Chairman of the KMG management Board.\n\nRemuneration establishing process\n\nIn accordance with the Corporate Governance Code, “remuneration for members of the Board of Directors shall be sufficient to attract, keep and motivate each member of the Board of Directors of a level as required for successful management of the company. Remuneration for a member of the Board of Directors of a company is established using a method developed by Samruk–Kazyna JSC in view of the expected positive effect for the company from participation of this person in the Board of Directors. Also, in accordance with the Corporate Governance Code, no one shall be involved in making a decision regarding his/her own remuneration.\n\nRemuneration establishing procedure is defined by Samruk Kazyna JSC. Resolution of Samruk–Kazyna JSC dated 26 September 2016 (minutes No.35/16) approved the Guidelines for Selection of Boards of Directors of Companies within Samruk–Kazyna JSC, which describes, among other things, how to establish remuneration for members of the Board of Directors. According to Section 3 of the Remuneration and Compensation Guidelines, remuneration is established according to responsibilities of a member of the Board of Directors, scale of company activities, long-term goals and objectives. Remuneration is paid to independent directors. Remuneration for representatives of Samruk–Kazyna JSC in the Board of Directors of a company is based on resolution of the Samruk–Kazyna Management Board.\n\nKMG does not involve advisors to establish remunerations.\n\nWith that, following the independent corporate governance assessment for KMG in 2018, which was procured by the KMG shareholder represented by Samruk–Kazyna JSC, the advisor gave the following recommendation” “During the Board of Directors performance review, consider how remunerations of members of the Board of Directors are consistent with their individual contributions to improvement of performance of the Board of Directors. Arrange an information session involving members of the Board of Directors to have an open discussion of remuneration of the Board of Directors. Clearly identify consequences of inadequate performance of duties and communicate them to the members of the Board of Directors. For example, low efficiency of members of the Board of Directors may result in early termination of their authority or not being able to be re-elected.”\n\nThis recommendation was reflected in one of the DCGIP activities, which in 2020 included an information session for the members of the KMG Board of Directors as a part of the meeting of the Committee of the KMG Board of Directors Committee for Nomination and Remuneration on April 25, 2020 (Minutes No.6/2020). The agenda of the Committee included suggestions to revise composition and remunerations of members of the KMG Board of Directors. Results of the discussion of the Board of Directors were communicated to Samruk–Kazyna JSC in a letter from KMG. The Company intends to take further measures to fulfil the advisor’s recommendation in 2021, after KMG Board of Directors performance review, as a part of the independent KMG corporate governance assessment procured by the main shareholder of KMG.\n\nInvolvement of stakeholders in salaries\n\nRemuneration establishing procedure is based on resolution of Samruk–Kazyna JSC Management Board. According to the Guidelines for Selection of Boards of Directors for Companies within Samruk–Kazyna JSC, which among other things, describe how to establish remunerations for members of the Board of Directors, remuneration is established in view of the duties of a member of the Board of Directors, scale of company activities, long-term goals and objectives. Remuneration is paid to independent directors. Remuneration for representatives of Samruk–Kazyna JSC in the Board of Directors of a company is based on resolution of the Samruk–Kazyna Management Board.\n\nWhen deciding on remuneration for members of the KMG Board of Directors, the Committee for Nomination and Remuneration, according to the Corporate Governance Code, shall have the right to recommend remuneration for members of the KMG Board of Directors.\n\nSee more details about GRI 102-15, 102-30, 102-35,102-36,102-37,102-38,102-39 (risk management, remuneration of the board of directors) in the KMG 2020 annual report on the KMG website athttps: https://kmg.kz/eng/investoram/reporting-and-financial-result/\n\nDIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\n\n2020 results\n\nKMG understands that digitalization is not a matter of far future, it is a necessary element of any industrial company today. The Company is intending to continue digitalization, but in a selective and reasonable manner, where it will have a considerable effect.\n\nIn 2020, Samruk–Kazyna JSC identified production improvements as the focus of the Digital Transformation Programme. This approach defined structure of a new KMG Transformation Portfolio and launched the search for new projects.\n\nTargeted Digitalization strategy will be developed to support necessary transformations to reach the SDG. Digital technology will help automate work processes, analyse and optimise use of energy and materials to minimise climatic impact, ensure safe work conditions for employees.\n\nAs the global economy is declining due to the COVID, digital transformation is seen as one of the lines within the anti-crisis strategy of KMG. The current Programme Portfolio includes projects intended to cut expenses, enhance transparency of business processes, develop a culture of continuous improvement and introduce digital solutions in work. The Programme is focused on exploration, production and processing of oil.\n\nIn 2020, the digital transformation project portfolio included four projects: “Introduction of ABAI Information System” for production assets, “Introduction of Engineering Simulation System at RoK Refineries”, “Establishing a Multifunctional KMG Shared Service Centre and “Journey Management”.\n\nFor example, ABAI is an information system which uses big data analytics and artificial intelligence to be able to cut costs for core exploration and production processes. In 2020, technical solutions were developed for 5 modules, which will be introduced in subsidiaries starting from the next year. For example, it is planned to launch a system for continuous corrosion monitoring of aboveground equipment to be able to cut costs for chemicals and reduce the accident rate.\n\nThe Journey Management project is intended to introduce a single system to acquire and process data from sensors on vehicles and special equipment by 9 parameters including the use of safety belts. This project also includes a motivation system for drivers, which will promote better safety and driving culture.\n\nLean 6 Sigma is aimed at sustainable development. The programme provides conditions to motivate employees and suggest improvements for current processes. Therefore, Lean 6 Sigma promotes the culture of lean management and changes people’s attitude to their daily work. 50 such projects were introduced in KMG in 2020. For example, consumption of fuel and energy at Pavlodar Refinery was reduced by selecting an appropriate duty for the furnace. The economical effect from this project amounted to 76.9 mln tenge.\n\nGoals and objectives for 2021\n\nAccording to company development priorities, Digital Transformation will be focused on the following initiatives:\n\nEnvironment – emissions control and resource saving;\n\nHealth and safety – preventing injuries and control of COVID-19;\n\nReliable and stable production – introduction of digital initiatives to maintain work processes at refineries;\n\nInitiatives to cut costs – improving profitability of production.\n\nSearching for new digital transformation initiatives according to the identified areas will be done through the Bank of Ideas, the single platform which is expected to be launched for all KMG employees. The main objectives of the Bank of Ideas is to involve employees in resolving current issues, use creative potential of innovators to address socioeconomic and work tasks.\n\nDigital transformation of KMG supports transformations as required to reach SDGs through upgrades of infrastructure and retrofitting industrial facilities by making them resilient by improving efficiency of resources and increased use of clean and environmentally friendly technologies and production processes (SDG 9).\n\nDigitalization projects of Oil Refining and Petrochemistry Division\n\nPC-based training simulators\n\nTo improve quality of employees’ work in normal and abnormal situations, improve reliability of units and prevent unscheduled shutdowns, the RoK Refinery Personnel Training and Qualification Project Using PC-Based Training Simulators (TS) has been implemented since 2019. The project is aimed at development of a dynamic process model based on a mathematical process model and visualization of a process unit. Visualisation is provided by: 1) Fully replicated interface and logic of distributed control systems (DCS) 2) Displaying the actual equipment in 3D or panoramic interface. Unit operators regularly master abnormal and normal conditions (shutdown/start) in the simulated conditions of the training simulators.\n\nUpgrade and retrofitting of PKOP included commissioning of TSs for residual fluid catalyst cracker (RFCC), catalyst cracking hydrotreater (Prime G+), desulphurization of saturated and unsaturated liquefied petroleum gas (Merox), short cycle adsorption (SCA-2) and sulphur production units.\n\nThe project, which was initiated in 2019, covers eleven process units at AR, nine POCR units and one PKOP unit.\n\nIn 2019–2020, the project included commissioning of TSs for delayed cokers, isomerisation unit and naphta splitter, diesel hydrotreater and cerosene hydrotreater of POCR, catalyst reformer of PKOP, catalyst crackers (FCC), catalyst reformers (CCR) and aromatic hydrocarbons production complex (PX) of AR.\n\nGuidelines were also developed and approved to apply TSs for training and knowledge assessment of refineries personnel. The refineries appointed trainers in charge of the training simulators, training, development of scenarios and knowledge assessment using TSs.\n\nProduction personnel of refineries pass regular trainings using TSs under the approved training curricula, training schedules, ready scenarios of emergencies and normal conditions.\n\nAdvanced process control system\n\nA pilot project of advanced process control system was commissioned for ELOU-AT-2 unit of AR to implement the business objective of unit process automation. This system is known worldwide as the Advanced Process Control (APC).\n\nThe APC acts as an auto pilot, maintaining process conditions of the unit within the pre-set limits. It automatically monitors constant parameters of unit load, temperatures of columns and furnaces, quality parameters of flows leaving the unit. This reduces human factor in process control.\n\nAfter introduction of the APC, dispersion of quality parameters reduced by 67 % for gasoline and by 73 % for diesel. The APC increases gasoline yield by approaching the gasoline boiling temperature as close as possible, and increases diesel yield by approaching the target pour point.\n\nThe project lasted for about a year: since April 2019, the AT-2 unit was inspected, equipment was designed and installed, the APCS was tested and integrated with the distributed control system (DCS). Dedicated AR specialists and unit operators were trained in work with the system. The system operates around the clock, it is now an integral part of the unit control, just as the DCS.\n\nIntroduction of the APCS on AT-2 unit had considerable effect. Yields of gasoline and diesel increased by 0.32-0.36 % (to 6.5 thousand t), which amounted to about 350 mln KZT/year.\n\nSince the pilot is so successful, the system will be introduced at AVT-3 unit of AR in 2021, and at the catalyst cracker in 2022. After that it will be introduced for other AR units. In 2022–2023, the APC is scheduled to be replicated at PKOP.\n\n3D plot plan Refinery engineering data management system\n\nDigital Plot Plan and 3D Model of RoK Refineries is being implemented to build a high precision, digital refinery plot plan as a basis for a “digital twin”.\n\nThe project includes:\n\nLaser scanning of all facilities,\n\nDigitalization of all technical documentation for refineries,\n\nBuilding a digital 3D model of plants based on point clouds,\n\nIntroducing “Digital Plot Plan” software, a multifunctional information system intended to store, analyse, process and visualise engineering data.\n\nThe project is not only intended to introduce a standalone digital plot plan and 3D model of a refinery. The main goal is to integrate the 3D model into daily business processes of the refinery. The future users of the product include not only employees of production assets upgrade department, but also process engineers, mechanical engineers, repair schedulers, reliability experts. In the process of implementation, the initial scope of the project was expanded and included an engineering data management system and an informational standard. It also includes integration of the new system with the repair scheduling system – IBM Maximo.\n\nThe digital plot plan will allow the system users to get updates about production assets, cut time and costs for engineering, increase production safety and reliability of assets.\n\nIntroduction of the digital model and plot plan at AR and POCR is scheduled on the first half of 2021.\n\nDigitalization of Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries\n\nSince July 2018, JSC NC “KazMunayGas” has been constructing the first gas chemical complex in Atyrau region – Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries (KPI).\n\nThe polypropylene production plant (KPI LLP) is the first phase of the Integrated Gas Chemical Complex (IGCC), which is scheduled for start-up in 2021. It will produce 500,000 tonnes of products per year. The second phase is the polyethylene production plant.\n\nKPI is a new industrial facility which can be built from scratch, as a completely digital asset.\n\nThe majority of major downstream and chemical companies (BASF, BP, ADNOC) have digitalised their assets progressively, over a long period of time. Kazakhstan does not yet have examples of a fully digitalized facility. KPI is targeting to reach the level of Digitalisation 4.0. In future, after basic automated and digital solutions have been introduced, a remote Process Control Centre is considered to be built to control processes at IGCC from Atyrau.\n\nKPI will be digitalised in two stages. The first stage is scheduled to end in quarter 4, 2021 (parallel with the start-up of IGCC). The second stage will start after the IGCC is commissioned.\n\nThe first stage (before commissioning of IGCC) will include introduction of the following elements and systems: instrumentation and controls (I&C), emergency shutdown system (ESD), distributed control system (DCS), repair scheduling system, laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), manufacturing execution system (MES), employee training process automation (PC-based training simulators), plant 3D model; SAP S4/HANA includes not only the basic modules (ERP), but also manufacture scheduling systems, integrations with manufacturing systems (MES, LIMS) and the repair scheduling system, and a single digital window (a business analytics tool).\n\nThe goal of SAP/HANA project is to implement the latest versions of corporate and production SAP modules at KPI. All business processes for the project are based on best international practices and international experience for petrochemical facilities, the target organisational chart of the plant is based on best practices and benchmarking.\n\nIn addition to integration with the internal plant systems (MES, LIMS, IBM Maximo, EDCS), it is also integrates with external systems: electronic VAT invoices, client bank, zakup.sk.kz procurement system.\n\nSAP core modules have been started since 01 January 2021: FI, TR, CO, MM, SD, HCM. Accounting, Procurement and Supplies, controlling and HR Management business operations are already implemented in SAP.\n\nThe second stage of KPI digitalisation includes introduction of an equipment reliability management system (AWS system), advanced automation with the advanced process control system, development based on SAP S4/HANA modules.\n\nDigital technologies and solutions will increase efficiency of IGCC business: minimise equipment downtimes and production failures, reduce rejection rates, increase productivity of work, cut operational expenses (current repairs, raw materials, products, chemicals, utilities), increase income through better product yields as a result of the optimisation."
