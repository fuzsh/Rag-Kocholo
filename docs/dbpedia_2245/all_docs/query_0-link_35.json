        "text": "This paper analyses cooperation between state institutions and state-owned energy companies of the Russian Federation on the basis of three examples of outward foreign direct investments (OFDI): the acquisition by nuclear power company Atomstroyexport of Nukem Technologies in Germany; the gas giant Gazprom and its South Stream investment package in Hungary; and the oil company Zarubezhneft’s acquisition of the Optima Group in Bosnia-Herzegovina . The research is based on the analyses of media reports, official state and company documents, and interviews conducted with representatives of the state-owned energy companies and state officials. The analysis suggests that Russian state-owned energy companies only initiate cooperation with state institutions when the circumstances require certain financial and diplomatic support to conduct OFDI. This paper reveals that, despite usually being portrayed as channels for Russian political influence, the drivers for the OFDI of Russian state-owned energy companies in fact represent a complex range of commercial considerations.\n\nConflict in Ukraine and global oil price volatility has led to falling Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) not only in Russia, but also in Kazakhstan. Moreover, increased political tensions between Russia and Kazakhstan has led to concerns that the Republic of Kazakhstan could see a repeat of the Ukrainian scenario involving confrontation with Russia. However, the case of Kazakhstan is more complex due to the growing role of China, including as a source of FDI. Inward FDI is of considerable importance for Kazakhstan’s oil-dependent economy, hence this article’s focus is on the most recent trends of FDI flows from Russia and its other economic partners to examine its impact on shaping relations among the powers involved in the region following the Ukraine Crisis. The article points to the significant role played by FDIs that are routed through off-shore centres\n\nThis study aims to propose that how Kazakhstan plays a role in the context of China's energy security and in which situations the existing problems such as Kazakhstan's nationalization policy in the energy sector or the lack of mutual trust and rising interdependence in the direction of bilateral energy cooperation could be overcome and new opportunities could be provided. Although Kazakhstan has a very small import ratio in China's energy supply, the reason why it attracts multi-faceted investments from China will be highlighted. This study firstly tries to clarify how China's energy security problem has emerged, and in this direction, and what kind of approaches has been adopted in its foreign policy is probed. Later, these approaches are tested and evaluated in the case of Kazakhstan. It is concluded that on the one hand Kazakhstan is a reliable location in terms of energy security as there are less geopolitical risks when compared to high seas and narrow passages; and on the other hand, China is aware that it cannot benefit enough from the energy sources without first achieving economic stability in the country. In this regard, it is also revealed how non-energy investments in the context of Belt and Road Initiative have a direct relationship with the energy security policy of China.\n\nRussian outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) has been showing a very promising performance in recent years. The Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have become a key destination, but this is often viewed with suspicion by host countries. The paper begins with the quantity and geographical distribution of Russian capital investment, pointing to differences between estimates and official OFDI data reported on a balance-of-payments basis by the Central Bank of Russia, which are frequently revised. In some years, OFDI has exceeded the FDI inflows into Russia, which is very unusual for an ex-communist transformation country. It is also paradoxical that FDI from relatively poor and less developed Russia should be supporting the economies of relatively more developed countries. When the destinations are examined, it emerges that some of the FDI is round-tripping and trans-shipping, as a significant proportion of the investment is conducted indirectly, through third economies. The paper investigates the companies behind the transactions and their various motivesfor expanding abroad. The bulk of the OFDI has been coming from natural resource-based companies, Russia’s largest exporters, earning well from high world market prices for energy sources and raw materials. Having presented the Russian FDI position in the CEE region through the statistics of the host countries, the paper sets out to describe the main Russian-origin investments and trends in selected CEE countries. Special attention is paid to the strategic investments in the gas and oil industries and the alarming dependence on Russian natural gas and crude oil. It is stressed that Russian FDI is managed by mature strategies. The paper also looks at the usually negative attitude taken in ex-socialist CEE countries to companies with Russian capital. The reasons for resistance include memories of earlier Soviet policies, fear of losing control over the commanding heights of the economy, and so-called oil and gas diplomacy, as well as cultural, productivity and efficiency issues. Five case studies are cited to shed light on the probable acquisition methods. Finally, attention is turned to the prospects for Russian FDI in the CEE countries and to some actual privatization opportunities."
