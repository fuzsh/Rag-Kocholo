        "text": "Significance\n\nKazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev announced on February 8 that oil production was expected to fall to 89.5 million tonnes this year from 90.3 million tonnes last year. Bozumbayev attributed the dip to scheduled shutdowns at three major oilfields, which will help Kazakhstan meet its commitment to cut output as agreed with OPEC members and non-members."
