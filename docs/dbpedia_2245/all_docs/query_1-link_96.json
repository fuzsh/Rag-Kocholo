(U) KazMunayGas (KMG), Kazakhstan's state-owned oil and gas\n\ncompany, is a vertically integrated company holding 25 subsidiaries\n\nin oil and gas exploration, extraction, processing, transportation,\n\nand sales. KMG produces 16% of Kazakhstan's oil output, transports\n\n65% of its oil, and manages 100% of the country's gas trunk\n\npipelines, 50% of its tanker transportation, and 30% of its oil\n\nrefining facilities. End Summary.\n\nBackground Information\n\n----------------------\n\n2. (U) KMG was founded in February 2002 from a merger of two\n\nnational companies, KazakhOil and Transportation of Oil and Gas\n\n(itself a result of the 2001 merger of KazTransOil and KazTransGas).\n\nIn 2006, KMG became a 100%-owned subsidiary of the newly organized\n\nState Assets Management Holding Company \"Samruk.\" Kazakhstan's Law\n\non Subsoil Use gives KMG the pre-emptive right to acquire 50% stakes\n\nin new and existing projects in the case of an equity transfer.\n\nKMG's Relationship with Energy Ministry and Samruk\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n3. (U) The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources provides policy\n\nsupervision for KMG, establishes development priorities in the oil\n\nand gas sector, and identifies the role of KMG in this development.\n\nMoreover, the Energy Ministry dictates the rules of Kazakhstan's\n\nenergy market, regulates the market of oil products, keeps a\n\nregister of subsoil users, and controls the compliance of subsoil\n\nusers with technical standards.\n\n4. (U) Samruk coordinates the work of KMG and is responsible for\n\nits strategic management. Samruk does not interfere with the\n\noperating activities of KMG, but establishes its strategic\n\ndevelopment priorities, such as corporate management, budgeting, and\n\nsome aspects of the relationship with investors and the state.\n\nSamruk has the right to include its representatives on the KMG board\n\nof directors.\n\n5. (U) Samruk plans to restructure KMG. According to Samruk\n\nchairman Kanat Bozumbayev, KMG is affiliated with over 190\n\ncompanies, 40% of which are classified as non-core assets (not\n\ndirectly related to the company's profile operations) in education,\n\nmass media, construction, etc. Examples include Kazakhstan-British\n\nTechnical University, Rauan Media Group, and KazMunayGas-Service.\n\nHe envisions that in 2008-2010, about 100 such companies will be\n\nsold. In 2002-2006, KMG sold some of its non-core assets such as\n\nKazTransCom, KazStroyService, KarakudukMunay, KazakhstanCaspiShelf,\n\nKMGPromGeoPhizika, KMG Consulting, and others.\n\nKMG Major Projects\n\n------------------\n\n6. (U) Of major oil and gas projects, KMG holds a 20% stake in\n\nTengizChevrOil operating consortium, represents state interests in\n\nthe Caspian Pipeline Consortium and in the Karachaganak project, and\n\nhas increased its share from 8.33 to 16.81% in the consortium\n\ndeveloping the Kashagan field.\n\n7. (U) KMG also holds a 50% stake in KazakhOil-Aktobe (the other\n\n50% belongs to Russia's LukOil Overseas company), a 51% stake in\n\nKazakhTurkMunay (Turkish Oil Corporation holds 49%), 33% in\n\nPetroKazakhstan company (China National Petroleum Corporation CNPC\n\ncontrols the other 67%), and a 34% stake in the KazakhOil-Ukraine\n\njoint venture.\n\n8. (U) KMG has several projects connected with the Karachaganak\n\nfield. The company owns a 50% stake in KazRosGas, a joint venture\n\nwith Russia's Gazprom company based at Orenburg Gas Processing Plant\n\n(GPP). The plant refines and then exports Karachaganak gas. As a\n\npart of this joint venture, KMG is seeking a 50% stake in the\n\nOrenburg GPP. KMG is also completing a feasibility study to build a\n\nKarachaganak-supplied gas refinery at Aksai that will meet the\n\ninternal demand for gas.\n\nKMG Subsidiaries\n\n----------------\n\n9. (U) Among the most significant of KMG's 25 subsidiaries,\n\nExploration&Production KazMunayGas carries out production projects,\n\nKazMunayTeniz manages offshore projects, the Kazakhstan Oil and Gas\n\nInstitute assesses all KMG field exploration and hydrocarbon\n\ntransportation projects, KazTransOil supervises oil pipeline\n\ntransportation, KazTransGas manages domestic and international\n\npipeline shipments of gas, KazMorTransFlot ships oil across the\n\nASTANA 00001210 002 OF 004\n\nCaspian Sea via tankers, and Trade House KazMunayGas processes oil,\n\nexports oil and oil products, and sells oil products to the domestic\n\nmarket.\n\nKMG Production Subsidiary Assets\n\n--------------------------------\n\n10. (U) KMG owns 61% of Exploration&Production KazMunayGas (EP\n\nKMG), while the remaining 39% is traded on the London and Kazakhstan\n\nstock exchanges. In 2007, EP KMG acquired a 50% stake in\n\nKarazhanbasMunay, which is developing the Karazhanbas oil field\n\n(403.15 million barrels of oil in probable reserves) in Mangistau\n\nOblast, and a 50% stake in KazGerMunay, which is developing the\n\nNuraly, Aksai, and Akshabulak oil fields (317.38 million barrels of\n\noil in proven reserves) in Kyzylorda Oblast. EP KMG also has two\n\nproduction subsidiaries, EmbaMunayGas and UzenMunayGas, which hold\n\nmore than 1.5 billion barrels of recoverable reserves.\n\n11. (U) EP KMG also holds a 50% stake in Kazakhstan Petrochemical\n\nIndustries (KPI), with SAT & Company holding the other 50%. KPI is\n\nconstructing in Atyrau Oblast the Karabatan petrochemical complex,\n\nwhich will have an annual capacity of 0.8 million tons of\n\npolyethylene. The facility will receive 6 billion cubic meters\n\n(bcm) of gas from Tengiz, and 3 bcm from Kashagan. On May 28, 2008,\n\nEP KMG provided 4.8 billion tenge ($40 million) to select\n\nengineering and construction contractors.\n\n12. (U) After a new tax code comes into effect on January 1, 2009,\n\nEP KMG will reportedly seek to buy 50% shares in KazakhOil-Aktobe,\n\n51% in KazakhTurkMunay, 33% in PetroKazakhstan from KMG, and at\n\nleast a 51% stake in MangistauMunayGas (MMG) from Indonesia's\n\nCentral Asia Petroleum Corp. (Note: EP KMG is waiting for the new\n\ntax code in order to measure the effect on its revenues and\n\nexpenditures. In the second half of 2008, EP KMG will start due\n\ndiligence of upcoming acquisitions. End Note.) MMG, the fifth\n\nlargest oil producer in the country (accounting for 9% of\n\nKazakhstan's oil output), possesses 36 associated fields with 7.03\n\nbillion barrels of oil in estimated reserves. MMG owns Helios brand\n\ngas stations and holds a 54.8% stake in Pavlodar Oil Refinery.\n\n13. (U) In 2009, EP KMG plans to launch the production of road\n\nbitumen at the Aktau Plastic Products Plant, in which it owns a 50%\n\nstake (SAT & Co is the other shareholder). In 2010, EP KMG will\n\nstart production of aromatic hydrocarbons at the Atyrau Polyethylene\n\nPlant. EP KMG owns a 50% stake of the plant.\n\n14. (U) In June 2008, EP KMG expressed interest in purchasing a 50%\n\nstake in Turgai Petroleum Joint Venture, currently owned by LukOil\n\nand PetroKazakhstan (controlled by CNPC), soon after LukOil\n\nannounced its intention to buy out CNPC's share. Turgai Petroleum\n\nis developing the Kumkol oil field, which has approximately 170\n\nmillion barrels of oil in proven reserves.\n\nAssets of KMG Offshore Project Managing Subsidiary\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n15. (U) The 100%-owned KMG subsidiary KazMunayTeniz (KMT) holds a\n\n40% stake in Caspi Meruerty Operating Company B.V. (CMOC), which is\n\nexploring the Zhemchuzhina oil field along with Shell and Oman\n\nPearls Company Ltd, and a 25% stake in the Zhemchuzhina Production\n\nSharing Agreement (PSA).\n\n16. (U) KMG intends to establish a joint venture with Lukoil and\n\nGazprom to develop the Tsentralnaya section of the Caspian shelf\n\nwith 300 million tons of hydrocarbons in estimated reserves. KMG is\n\nclose to signing with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources a\n\ncontract for exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons at the\n\nMertvyy Kultuk offshore section with estimated reserves of 1.2\n\nbillion barrels of oil, 97.5 bcm of gas, and 5.1 million tons of gas\n\ncondensate.\n\n17. (U) The first drilling results of the Atash field jointly\n\nexplored by KMT and LukOil showed no oil and gas reserves present\n\n(the field was expected to have 1.03 billion barrels of oil). This\n\nis the third failure of KMT, following the Tyub-Karagan and\n\nKurmangazy offshore projects. Moreover, according to some experts,\n\nthe Khvalynskoye field explored by the KMG-LukOil Joint Venture,\n\nCaspian Oil and Gas Company, was also not as promising as had been\n\nexpected. EP KMG seeks to replace KMT as operator of offshore\n\nprojects, as it claims to possess more technical expertise in field\n\ndevelopment.\n\n18. (U) In May 2008, KMG signed a contract to explore the Zhambyl\n\nsection of the Caspian shelf, which has over 120 million tons of\n\nhydrocarbons in probable reserves. KMT will have 73% of the\n\nproject, and Korea National Oil Corp. the remaining 27%. In January\n\n2008, KMG also signed a PSA with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral\n\nASTANA 00001210 003 OF 004\n\nResources to explore the promising N (or Nursultan) section of the\n\nCaspian shelf (600-700 million tons of hydrocarbons in probable\n\nreserves). (Note: This is the block that ConocoPhillips and Shell\n\ncompeted for. ConocoPhillips and Shell both hope that they will\n\neventually be provided an opportunity to participate.)\n\nProjects of KMG Oil Pipeline Transportation Subsidiary\n\n--------------------------------------------- -----\n\n19. (U) The 100%-owned KMG subsidiary KazTransOil (KTO) has a 50%\n\nstake in the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline Ltd, with the other 50%\n\nbelonging to China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development\n\nCorporation. In 2006, KTO started oil shipments via the first stage\n\nof Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline Atasu-Alashankou. Kenkiyak-Kumkol,\n\nthe second stage of the pipeline, is to be launched at the end of\n\n2009.\n\n20. (U) In December 2006, KTO and its partners, Naftrans (owned by\n\nDanish Greenoak Holdings Ltd and ENR Russia Invest) and French bank\n\nBNP Paribas, established a joint venture based at Georgia's Batumi\n\noil terminal. In 2007, KTO acquired the stakes of its partners and\n\nbecame the sole owner of the terminal. KMG is interested in\n\nincreasing its transit volumes of oil to 10 million tons a year via\n\nGeorgia's railroad and oil pipelines.\n\nProjects of KMG Gas Pipeline Transportation Subsidiary\n\n--------------------------------------------- -----\n\n21. (U) The 51%-owned KMG subsidiary KazTransGas (KTG) owns\n\nIntergas Central Asia company, Amangeldy Gas company (gas extraction\n\nand processing in the Amangeldy field), and KazTransGas LNG\n\n(operator of Zhanazhol gas field), and also holds a stake in the\n\nKazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan joint venture KyrKazGas. In 2006, KTG bought\n\nGeorgian Gas Distributing Company Tbilgasy.\n\n22. (U) KTG holds a 50% stake in the Asian Gas Pipeline LLP, a\n\njoint venture with the CNPC affiliate, Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Ltd.\n\nThe joint venture was established in February 2008 to build a\n\nKazakhstan-China gas pipeline with an annual capacity of 40 bcm of\n\ngas. To ensure gas supply to this pipeline, the Government of\n\nKazakhstan transferred to KMG the Urikhtau gas field in Aktobe\n\nOblast with probable reserves of 40 bcm of gas.\n\nOperations of KMG Tanker Transportation Subsidiary\n\n--------------------------------------------- -\n\n23. (U) KazMorTransFlot (KMTF) owned by Samruk (50%) and KMG (50%)\n\nis the national maritime trade fleet. KMG seeks to increase its\n\nstake in KMTF to 100%. KMTF has its own support fleet, including\n\nthe tankers \"Astana,\" \"Almaty,\" and \"Aktau,\", and ships oil via\n\ntankers to the sea ports of Makhachkala (Russia), Baku (Azerbaijan),\n\nand Necca (Iran).\n\nAssets of KMG Processing and Sales Subsidiary\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n24. (U) The 100%-owned KMG subsidiary Trade House KazMunayGas (TH\n\nKMG) holds stakes in three oil refineries, Atyrau (99.09%), Shymkent\n\n(50%), and Pavlodar (42%). KMG seeks to increase its stake in the\n\nPavlodar Oil Refinery after the planned acquisition of at least a\n\n51% stake in its co-owner, MangistauMunayGas. KMG owns 20.2% of\n\nUkraine's Kherson Oil Refinery, but wants to raise its share to at\n\nleast 50%.\n\n25. (U) TH KMG sells oil products via the 156 gas stations of its\n\ndaughter companies KMG-Alatau, KMG-Astana, and KMG-Zhaiyk. By 2010,\n\nKMG plans to have 330 gas stations, or 15% of all gas stations in\n\nthe country. In 2007, TH KMG acquired a 75% stake in Rompetrol\n\nGroup N.V., which has two oil refineries in Petromedia and Constanta\n\nand 630 gas stations in Romania, France, Spain, Moldova, Ukraine,\n\nand Bulgaria. Rompetrol ships oil to Turkey, Ukraine, Croatia, and\n\nMoldova, and has a five-year contract for lease of tankers.\n\nComment\n\n-------\n\n26. (U) KMG employs over 30,000 employees and accounted for 8.55%\n\n(or $1.58 billion) of Kazakhstan's 2007 budget revenues. A\n\ndiversified structure with both core and non-core assets makes KMG a\n\nlow-risk and solvent client in the eyes of potential lenders as its\n\nassets are well diversified, and hence losses of a company in one\n\nsector can easily be compensated with gains of those in another.\n\nHowever, the heavy bureaucratic structure of KMG also creates a\n\nnumber of problems - a lack of financial and operational\n\ntransparency, potential misuse of funds (e.g. funds allocated to a\n\ncore company can be used by a non-core company), difficulties in\n\ncontrolling cash flow, high interdependence of companies, and\n\nASTANA 00001210 004 OF 004\n\nreduced efficiency of operative management. KMG is awaiting further\n\nrestructuring and administrative reforms to make it more easily\n\nmanageable, transparent, and more streamlined.\n\n27. (U) Maksat Idenov has briefed USG officials on several occasions\n\non his plans to restructure KMG along the lines of an integrated\n\nIOC, based in part on his experience as a senior executive with\n\nShell. With the removal of KMG President Karaballin, after\n\nKaraballin's unsuccessful attempt to force Idenov out, and with the\n\napparent backing of the President and Prime Minister, Idenov has at\n\nleast some room to implement his restructuring plans.\n\n1"
