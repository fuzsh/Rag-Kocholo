        "text": "Exploration\n\nExploration costs totalled KZT 18 bn (excluding shares) in 2020, down KZT 29 bn year-on-year. However, the funds were sufficient to maintain the current production level and replenish reserves in the medium term. The cost reduction was mostly driven by CAPEX optimisation as part of COVID-19 crisis response initiatives.\n\nIn 2020, hydrocarbon reserves increased by 16 mln tonnes, primarily due to further exploration and re-appraisal of the fields operated by Embamunaigas, OzenMunaiGas, Kazakhturkmunay, and others.\n\nA major highlight of 2020 in our ongoing exploration projects was a natural flow of up to 85 tonnes per day of water-free Jurassic oil produced from an exploration well on the Bekturly Vostochny block.\n\nThe highlight in further exploration of existing projects in 2020 was a natural flow of 70 tonnes per day of water-free Triassic oil produced from NSV-11 well in the north-west flank of Embamunaigas’s Sagidulla Nurzhanov field.\n\nThe coastal areas of the Caspian may hold large potential discoveries, with about 90% of Kazakhstan’s total hydrocarbon reserves concentrated in the region. In 2020, KMG’s portfolio was comprised of 15 exploration projects (8 offshore and 7 onshore), of which six projects are carried out under carry financing arrangements.\n\nProcessing and interpretation of seismic data in 2020 led to an estimate of total petroleum in place for six projects of more than 2 bn toe. Seismic acquisition for these projects commenced in 2019.\n\nKMG is routinely conducting comprehensive studies of Kazakhstan’s sedimentary basins to assess their oil and gas potential and build a portfolio of promising blocks for subsoil use. In 2020, geologic evaluation of more than 15 projects was completed.\n\nThe Company also continues building and updating models of sedimentary basins. Basin modelling includes a comprehensive prospect analysis using all available historical data, which significantly mitigates the risks related to decision-making on further exploration. In 2020, KMG updated the models of the Ustyurt-Bozashin basin, Mangyshlak basin and the flanks (norther, eastern and southern) of the Caspian sedimentary basin and built models for the South Turgai and Shu-Sarysu sedimentary basins.\n\nIn early 2020, as part of its exploration cooperation with the government, KMG initiated a process to include 16 exploration projects in the National Acreage Management Programme and seven areas in the scope of state geological surveys in accordance with the Kazakhstan’s Subsoil and Subsoil Use Code. However, the list of projects had to be optimised due to the fall in global energy prices and as part of the crisis response strategy developed by the Company, with only three projects eventually included in the National Acreage Management Programme in 2020.\n\nExpansion of partnership projects\n\nIn 2020, KMG continued to strongly focus on expanding its cooperation in exploration with international oil and gas companies:"
