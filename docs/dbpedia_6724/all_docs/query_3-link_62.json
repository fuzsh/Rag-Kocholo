        "text": "People usually ask me how leadership can emphasize the importance of cybersecurity across all levels. The key is for everyone to act as a CRO, the Chief Repeating Officer. Make sure that the story is being told and repeated effectively so everybody understands the importance of what's at risk. Some of the qualities that make an effective cybersecurity leader are making wise and timely decisions, and making sure that you're not taking too long to decide since some decisions can have dire consequences if you take too long.\n\nThe SonicWall SonicWall MSS teams are headed to Toronto this week for another AMAZING The ASCII Group #ASCIIEDGE 😍 Michael E Crean, Julian Agapitos and Elizabeth Reynolds will be there in full force - We look forward to seeing you there! #roadwarriors #bettertogether #WeLoveASCII #NeverAlone #RelentlessSecurity #CyberExperts #MDR #SOCaaS #ThoughtLeadership #WeLoveMSPs\n\nPeople usually ask me why small to medium businesses struggle with cybersecurity. It's often about limited resources and the need for solid processes. Put the right people in place and make sure that the processes are solid, well thought out, and executed. You have to make not just changes in your technology, but you have to change people's beliefs in how they will operate. Most importantly, everyone must believe that the change is their responsibility. #Cybersecurity #MSP #MSSP\n\n“Teaching is a mission that unfolds the potential of young minds” -unknown The SonicWall MSS SonicWall team is having a blast this week with and are so lucky to have such a #FutureLeader join us this week for his first CompTIA #ChannelCon in Atlanta!

Many business owners think, \"I'm too small,\" or \"I know what I'm doing.\" The truth is, no one is as effective alone as they are with a team.
