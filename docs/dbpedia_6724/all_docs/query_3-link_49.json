This curated list features endpoint security and network monitoring vendors such as AppOmni, SonicWall, Fortinet, and more.\n\nKeeping tabs on all the most relevant endpoint security and network monitoring news can be a time-consuming task. As a result, our editorial team aims to provide a summary of the top headlines from the last month in this space. Solutions Review editors will curate vendor product news, mergers and acquisitions, venture capital funding, talent acquisition, and other noteworthy endpoint security and network monitoring news items.\n\nEndpoint Security and Network Monitoring News for the Week of July 19\n\nRoutine CrowdStrike Update Leads to Global Microsoft Outage\n\nA routine software update caused cascading chaos Friday that has engulfed global businesses from airports and banks to retail and law enforcement. It wasn’t a cyberattack, but was caused by one of the world’s largest cybersecurity companies deploying a flawed update while trying to keep their customers safe from hackers. CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company based in Austin, Texas, that’s widely used by businesses and government agencies that run on Microsoft computers, said that a defect in one of its updates for computers running the Windows operating system had caused the issue. The result was arguably the largest global information technology outage in history.\n\nRead on for more.\n\nAppOmni Brings Aboard Industry Veteran Joel Wallenstrom\n\nAppOmni, a pioneer of SaaS security posture management (SSPM), this week announced that industry veteran Joel Wallenstrom joins the company as General Manager. In this new role, Joel will lead a united function that brings together the Product, Engineering, and Customer Success disciplines. Joel brings a unique set of credentials to his new role. He was previously CEO of Wickr, a secure communications provider that was acquired by Amazon Web Services (AWS). He led the transformation of the company’s key offering from a consumer messaging app to an end-to-end encrypted collaboration platform used by Fortune 100 companies and critical commands across the Five Eyes and NATO allies. Previously, he served as President & CEO of iSEC Partners, a professional services firm highly respected for its cutting-edge independent security research and incident response in high-profile cyber cases. In 2010, security consulting firm NCC Group acquired iSEC Partners, and he subsequently served as GM of North America for the parent company. During this period, NCC Group acquired leading security players, notably Matasano, Intrepidus, FOX-IT and VSR. He began his career in tech security in late 1999 as Director for Strategic Alliances, @stake, one of the first information security providers.\n\nRead on for more.\n\nKnowBe4 Launches BreachSim, a Free Tool to Aid in Detecting Network Security Weaknesses\n\nKnowBe4, a security awareness training and simulated phishing platform and solutions provider, this week announced the release of BreachSim, a free tool designed to help organizations identify and address network security vulnerabilities from the lens of a hacker. BreachSim enables IT security professionals and network administrators to uncover weaknesses in their security infrastructure and demonstrate the critical importance of employee training.

Using publicly available information and proprietary analysis, this report provides a comprehensive view of planned attacks, such as third-party breaches, infostealers, phishing, and malware, including ransomware. Beginning the second half of 2023, FortiGuard Labs has observed a significant increase in darknet activity targeting France and resources being gathered for the Paris Olympic Games, especially those targeting French-speaking users, French government agencies and businesses, and French infrastructure providers. This 80 percent to 90 percent increase in activity has remained consistent across 2H 2023 and 1H 2024. The prevalence and sophistication of these threats are a testament to cybercriminals’ planning and execution, with the dark web serving as a hub for their activities.\n\nRead on for more.\n\nExpert Insights Section\n\nWatch this space each week as our editors will share upcoming events, new thought leadership, and the best resources from Insight Jam, Solutions Review’s enterprise tech community for business software pros. The goal? To help you gain a forward-thinking analysis and remain on-trend through expert advice, best practices, trends and predictions, and vendor-neutral software evaluation tools.\n\nSecurityScorecard CEO Offers Commentary on Microsoft Global Outage\n\n“When I used to work at Goldman Sachs, the policy was to get tools from multiple vendors. This way, if one firewall goes down by one vendor, you have another vendor who may be more resilient.\n\nToday’s global outage is a reminder of the fragility and systemic ‘nth-party’ concentration risk of the technology that runs everyday life: airlines, banks, telecoms, stock exchanges, and more. SecurityScorecard, in collaboration with McKinsey, produced research showing that 62 percent of the global external attack surface is concentrated in the products and services of just 15 companies.\n\nAn outage is just another form of a security incident. Antifragility in these situations comes from not putting all your eggs in one basket. You need to have diverse systems, know where your single points of failure are, and proactively stress-test through tabletop exercises and simulations of outages. Consider the “chaos monkey” concept, where you deliberately break your systems—e.g., shut down your database or make your firewall malfunction to see how your computers react.\n\nWhether caused by a malicious DDoS attack or a faulty patch update, the end result of an outage is the same: Users are denied access to critical systems.\n\nThis disruption creates a fertile ground for exploitation, as attackers prey on the vulnerability of users seeking solutions. The timing of this event and how public it is happens to be exactly what attackers look for to craft targeted attacks. Threat actors may use social engineering tactics to disguise malware as legitimate restoration tools to gain unauthorized access to systems. Vigilance is paramount, as organizations must not only address the outage but also fortify defenses against opportunistic attacks that exploit the chaos.”"
