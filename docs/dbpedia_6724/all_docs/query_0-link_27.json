        "text": "(AP) -- Computer maker Dell Inc. said Tuesday that it agreed to buy network and data security provider SonicWALL Inc. for an undisclosed sum.\n\nRound Rock, Texas-based Dell said that SonicWALL's lineup of firewalls complements its security solutions portfolio and broadens its product lineup.\n\nThe company has more than 130 patents, registered and pending, and develops its own security products. More than 300,000 customers use SonicWALL products, including firewalls and secure remote access, along with email security, backup and recovery, Dell said.\n\nSonicWALL was founded in 1991 and is based in San Jose, Calif. Its 950 workers are expected to join Dell, the company said.\n\nThe deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions, was approved by the boards of both companies. It's expected to close in the second quarter of Dell's fiscal year 2013.\n\nDell's stock rose 11 cents to $17.07 in morning trading Tuesday.\n\nÂ©2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
