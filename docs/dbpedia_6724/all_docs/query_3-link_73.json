        "text": "Cybersecurity is more crucial now than ever. With so much business being conducted online, organizations need a way to know that all their important data is protected. Your business may be vulnerable to a cyber-attack if you are not properly prepared to defend yourself against malicious agents.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recently published a report that warns the public that COVID-19 is being used by bad actors to carry out phishing and malware scams. All it takes is one member of your organization clicking on a suspicious link to compromise your entire organization.\n\nA study conducted in 2018 found that 60% of small businesses that suffer a data breach go under within six months. Larger corporations often have entire divisions in place to handle cybersecurity. But for a small business or new startup, cybersecurity is something that is often neglected until it’s too late. However, the numbers show that besides a lack of cash flow, a data breach is the biggest threat to a new business.\n\nBut there’s no need to panic. It’s easier than ever to secure your small business from cyberattacks. At Advantage Industries, we’re a SonicWALL Firewall partner and we’re proud to bring IT resources to businesses of all different sizes. We offer the most secure and technologically advanced methods of securing your private business networks and we’re happy to equip your business with the necessary protections.\n\nTo a business in the 21st century, data is your most sacred commodity. If you had all your company funds in a safe, would you leave that safe wide open for anyone to access? Any savvy business owner would say no, and yet it’s surprising how many do the equivalent with their important business data. If you’re ready for an IT solution that will keep your business safe from any potential threats, fill out our contact form or give us a call today. We offer affordable IT solutions and cybersecurity products for business owners who understand the value of protecting their precious data."
