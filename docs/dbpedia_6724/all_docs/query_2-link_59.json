        "text": "This collection includes Ansible core modules, network resource modules, and plugins needed to provision and manage Dell EMC PowerSwitch platforms running Enterprise SONiC Distribution by Dell Technologies. Sample playbooks and documentation are also included to show how the collection can be used.\n\nThe SONiC Ansible collection supports network_cli and httpapi connections.\n\nCLICONF plugin\n\nName Description network_cli Use Ansible CLICONF to run commands on Enterprise SONiC\n\nHTTPAPI plugin\n\nName Description httpapi Use Ansible HTTPAPI to run commands on Enterprise SONiC\n\nName Description Connection type sonic_command Run commands through the Management Framework CLI network_cli sonic_config Manage configuration through the Management Framework CLI network_cli sonic_api Perform REST operations through the Management Framework REST API httpapi\n\nListed are the SONiC Ansible network resource modules which need httpapi as the connection type. Supported operations are merged, deleted, replaced and overridden.\n\nName Description sonic_aaa Manage AAA and its parameters sonic_acl_interfaces Manage access control list (ACL) to interface binding sonic_bfd Manage BFD configuration sonic_bgp Manage global BGP and its parameters sonic_bgp_af Manage global BGP address-family and its parameters sonic_bgp_as_paths Manage BGP autonomous system path (or as-path-list) and its parameters sonic_bgp_communities Manage BGP community and its parameters sonic_bgp_ext_communities Manage BGP extended community-list and its parameters sonic_bgp_neighbors Manage a BGP neighbor and its parameters sonic_bgp_neighbors_af Manage the BGP neighbor address-family and its parameters sonic_copp Manage CoPP configuration sonic_dhcp_relay Manage DHCP and DHCPv6 relay configurations sonic_dhcp_snooping Manage DHCP Snooping sonic_fips Manage FIPS configurations sonic_image_management Manage installation of Enterprise SONiC image, software patch and firmware updater. sonic_interfaces Configure Interface attributes sonic_ip_neighbor Manage IP neighbor global configuration sonic_l2_acls Manage Layer 2 access control lists (ACL) configurations sonic_l2_interfaces Configure interface-to-VLAN association sonic_l3_acls Manage Layer 3 access control lists (ACL) configurations sonic_l3_interfaces Configure the IPv4 and IPv6 parameters on Interfaces sonic_lag_interfaces Manage link aggregation group (LAG) interface parameters sonic_ldap Configure global LDAP server settings sonic_lldp_global Manage Global LLDP configurations sonic_lldp_interfaces Manage interface LLDP configurations sonic_logging Manage logging configuration sonic_login_lockout Manage Global Login Lockout configuration sonic_mac Manage MAC configuration sonic_mclag Manage multi chassis link aggregation groups domain (MCLAG) and its parameters sonic_mgmt_servers Manage management servers configuration sonic_ntp Manage NTP configuration sonic_ospf_area Configure OSPF area setting sonic_ospfv2 Configure global OSPFv2 protocol settings sonic_ospfv2_interfaces Configure OSPFv2 interface mode protocol settings sonic_pim_global Manage global PIM configuration sonic_pim_interfaces Manage interface-specific PIM configurations sonic_pki Manages PKI attributes sonic_poe Manage Power over Ethernet PoE configuration sonic_port_breakout Configure port breakout settings on physical interfaces sonic_port_group Manage port group configuration sonic_prefix_lists Manage prefix list configuration sonic_qos_buffer Manage QoS buffer configuration sonic_qos_interfaces Manage QoS interfaces configuration sonic_qos_maps Manage QoS maps configuration sonic_qos_pfc Manage QoS PFC configuration sonic_qos_scheduler Manage QoS scheduler configuration sonic_qos_wred Manage QoS WRED profiles configuration sonic_radius_server Manage RADIUS server and its parameters sonic_roce Manage RoCE QoS configuration sonic_route_maps Manage route map configuration sonic_sflow Manage sflow configuration settings sonic_static_routes Manage static routes configuration sonic_stp Manage STP configuration sonic_system Configure system parameters sonic_tacacs_server Manage TACACS server and its parameters sonic_users Manage users and its parameters sonic_vlan_mapping Configure vlan mappings sonic_vlans Manage VLAN and its parameters sonic_vrfs Manage VRFs and associate VRFs to interfaces sonic_vrrp Manage VRRP protocol configuration settings sonic_vxlans Manage VxLAN EVPN and its parameters\n\nThe playbooks directory includes this sample playbook that show end-to-end use cases.\n\nName Description BGP Layer 3 fabric Example playbook to build a Layer 3 leaf-spine fabric\n\nRecommended Ansible version 2.14 or higher (This is required for enterprise_sonic collection version >= 2.4.0).\n\nEnterprise SONiC Distribution by Dell Technologies version 3.1 or higher\n\nRecommended Python 3.9 or higher (This is required for enterprise_sonic collection version >= 2.4.0.).\n\nDell Enterprise SONiC images for releases 3.1 - 3.5: Use Ansible Enterprise SONiC collection version 1.1.0 or later 1.m.n versions (from the 1.x branch of this repo)\n\nDell Enterprise SONiC images for release 4.0 and later 4.x.y releases: Use Ansible Enterprise SONiC collection version 2.0.0 or later 2.m.n releases (from the \"2.x\" branch of this repo).\n\nIn general: Dell Enterprise SONiC release versions \"R.x.y\" are supported by Ansible Enterprise SONiC collection versions \"R-2.m.n\" on branch \"R-2.x\".\n\nNOTE: Community SONiC versions that include the Management Framework container should work as well, however, this collection has not been tested nor validated with community versions and is not supported.\n\nTo use the Enterprise SONiC collection in Ansible 2.9, it is required to add one of the two available environment variables.\n\nOption 1: Add the environment variable while running the playbook.\n\nOption 2: Add the environment variable in user profile.\n\nInstall the latest version of the Enterprise SONiC collection from Ansible Galaxy.\n\nTo install a specific version, specify a version range identifier. For example, to install the most recent version that is greater than or equal to 1.0.0 and less than 2.0.0.\n\nVLAN configuration using CLICONF\n\nsonic_network_cli.yaml\n\nVLAN configuration using HTTPAPI\n\nsonic_httpapi.yaml\n\nConfiguration using network resource modules\n\nsonic_resource_modules.yaml\n\nhost_vars/sonic_sw1.yaml\n\ninventory.ini\n\nThis collection follows Semantic Versioning. More details on versioning can be found in the Ansible docs.\n\nWe plan to regularly release new minor or bugfix versions once new features or bugfixes have been implemented.\n\nEnterprise SONiC Ansible Modules deprecation cycle is aligned with Ansible.\n\nSource control branches on Github:\n\nReleased code versions are located on \"release\" branches with names of the form \"M.x\", where \"M\" specifies the \"major\" release version for releases residing on the branch.\n\nUnreleased and pre-release code versions are located on sub-branches of the \"main\" branch. This is a development branch, and is not intended for use in production environments.\n\nThis repository adheres to the Ansible Community code of conduct\n\nJoin the Ansible forum:\n\nGet Help: get help or help others.\n\nSocial Spaces: gather and interact with fellow enthusiasts.\n\nNews & Announcements: track project-wide announcements including social events.\n\nThe Ansible Bullhorn newsletter: used to announce releases and important changes.\n\nFor more information about communication, see the Ansible communication guide.\n\n(c) 2020-2021 Dell Inc. or its subsidiaries.
