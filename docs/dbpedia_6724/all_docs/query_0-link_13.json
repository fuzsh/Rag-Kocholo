        "text": "Dell SonicWALL has unveiled a redesigned partner programme to offer more for partners, including better rewards and more products for them to resell.\n\nThe Reward for Value partner programme opens up the company's full portfolio of products to network security partners in North America. It's designed to help partners not only generate more revenues, but also train their staff as security advisors for customers.\n\n\"Customers are facing a fast-paced world of ever changing security threats and mounting requirements for industry compliance,” said Steve Pataky, vice president, worldwide sales, Dell SonicWALL.\n\n“It’s imperative that we help our valued partners reinforce their roles as trusted advisors to their customers. A cornerstone of supporting our partners is our new partner program designed to enable partners to deepen and broaden their security practices.”\n\nThe Reward for Value partner programme offers more technical enablement for partners, as well as a new sales accreditation programme and online learning tools and training around all products and services in the SonicWALL portfolio.\n\nThose who meet Dell SonicWALL's requirements will also be able to generate more money from each sale thanks to enhanced programme features. These includie incremental discounts for seeking out new customers, delivering proof of concepts and implementing solutions for customers to help them leverage their network security.\n\n“As security challenges and compliance requirements in the retail industry continue to evolve, our team realized there was a need to enhance our security infrastructure in our 700 convenience stores across the southern United States,” said Ben Leggett, network engineer at RaceTrac Petroleum.\n\n“After a competitive review of security vendors, we selected Dell SonicWALL next generation SuperMassive and TZ series firewalls. We have been very pleased with the resulting deployment, which has been supported by the impressive features in the Global Management System (GMS) to provide a comprehensive security solution.”"
