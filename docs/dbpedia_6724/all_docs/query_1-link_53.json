Next up: SonicWall, formerly owned by Dell, is launching a renewed channel partner program initiative called the SecureFirst Partner Program.\n\nAmid the change of ownership, Bill Conner is now president and CEO of SonicWall. Conner previously was CEO of Silent Circle, CEO of Entrust, president of Data Networks and president of Enterprise Networks at Nortel Networks. He'll focus the company on SonicWall's branded Capture Advance Threat Protection Service -- essentially is an advanced threat protection and sandboxing approach to stopping zero-day attacks.\n\nConner offered up these comments to employees, partners and customers:\n\nVideo link\n\nMeanwhile, the new SecureFirst Partner Program features improved partner rewards, deal protection and expanded technical enablement on the SonicWall portfolio, the company said. Dell EMC also will continue to resell SonicWall's entire portfolio.\n\nEven ahead of the deal, SonicWall says it has achieved several milestones on the technology and channel fronts. They include:\n\nStill, SonicWall in some ways is making up for lost time. During a partner conference in August, the company conceded that its partner communications were occasionally slow and/or challenging under Dell's former ownership. Also, the company conceded that it needed to close the feature-function gap on a few items."
