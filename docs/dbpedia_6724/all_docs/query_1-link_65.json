        "text": "Dell has acquired software security outfit SonicWall, continuing to expand its software business under the direction of former CA Technologies CEO John Swainson.\n\n\"We're very pleased to have John Swainson as the leader of our software group,\" said Dell senior vice president of strategy Dave Johnson during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, \"and SonicWall will be a cornerstone of his software group -- from a security perspective.\"\n\nSonicWall sells \"unified threat management\" software -- software for overseeing a wide range of security tools, from antivirus applications to virtual private networks to intrusion-detection tools -- as well as its own firewall software. The company boasts over 300,000 active customers, and it sells through a network of over 1,500 channel partners. Over the past year, the company raked in about $260 million in revenue.\n\n\"Dell is building a software portfolio focused on highly profitable and fast-growing segments,\" Swainson said. \"SonicWell ... positions us well in a fast-growing segment of the security business, and the SonicWall team ... is a great cultural fit with Dell.\"\n\nLast month, Dell purchased backup software outfit AppAssure, and its software business also spans tools it acquired with the purchase of SecureWorks, another security outfit; patch-management company Kace; data center management outfit Scalent; and Boomi, a Philadelphia outfit offering software and services for integrating a business' various back-end applications. Dell already offers security tools under the AppAssure and Kace names as well as the SecureWorks brand.\n\nSonicWall is based in San Jose, California, not far from what Dell calls the Dell Silicon Valley Research and Development Center -- a new office that houses the former employees of Scalent, storage outfit Ocarina, and desktop management player Everdream as well as other new Silicon Valley staff.\n\nDell began life as a PC company, but it has since morphed into a company that seeks to tackle the entire IT landscape, from servers to storage to networking to software to services. The acquisition of SonicWall -- the latest step along that road -- is expected to close sometime in the second quarter.\n\nHow IT Departments Scrambled to Address the CrowdStrike Chaos\n\nSystem administrators and their teams sprang into action last Friday and worked tirelessly to get their companies back online amid one of the worst digital blackouts ever.\n\nWe Asked AI to Take Us On a Tour of Our Cities. It Was Chaos\n\nWe had a specialty chatbot to curate perfect days out in London and New York for under $100 each. We're still recovering from our journeys.\n\nBitcoin Bros Go Wild for Donald Trump\n\nAt Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Trump is finally telling crypto enthusiasts what they want to hear.\n\nYou Won’t Believe What Car Headlights Have in Store\n\nNew technology and a drive toward electrified powertrains have converged to create a flashy new car-lighting landscape. What comes next could be an international light language.\n\nGoogle DeepMind’s Game-Playing AI Tackles a Chatbot Blind Spot\n\nGoogle’s new advance combines a large language model with a self-learning AI. The technique could address some shortcomings with AI—although there’s a catch.\n\nOpen Source AI Has Founders—and the FTC—Buzzing\n\nDC went to YC to talk OS.\n\nMeta's New Llama 3.1 AI Model Is Free, Powerful, and Risky\n\nThe newest version of Llama will make AI more accessible and customizable, but it will also stir up debate over the dangers of releasing AI without guardrails.\n\nNew Jersey’s $500 Million Bid to Become an AI Epicenter\n\nThe Garden State has enacted a hefty new tax credit specifically for AI businesses. But tax incentives—particularly for data centers—don’t always create a lot of jobs."
