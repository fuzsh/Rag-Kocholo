        "text": "Dell Inc. said Tuesday it has agreed to buy SonicWall Inc., a California company that makes advanced network security and data protection software.\n\nDell officials said SonicWall's advanced firewalls complement its own portfolio of security solutions.\n\nThe move is part of Dell's ongoing effort to transform its business and become a complete information technology and hardware and services company for corporate customers.\n\nDave Johnson, Dell's senior vice president for corporate strategy, called the acquisition an important step in broadening Dell's software portfolio in the \"critical area of security.\"\n\nSecurity \"continues to surface as one of the biggest concerns\" of Dell's customers, he said in a Tuesday conference call with reporters and analysts.\n\n\"The combination of Dell's reputation as a trusted adviser to our customers, our distribution and sales capability, combined with SonicWall's innovative solutions in the security space, addresses these customers' needs,\" Johnson said. \"It's really a great fit strategically, operationally and culturally for our two companies.\"\n\nNo terms of the deal were released. SonicWall had revenue of about $260 million in the past 12 months, Johnson said.\n\nThe boards of both companies have approved the acquisition, which should be complete by early in the second quarter of Dell's fiscal year, he said. The quarter starts in May.\n\nThe acquisition adds to Dell's previous purchase of the SecureWorks security service last year and the acquisition of Dell Kace, which delivers technology to detect and repair system vulnerabilities.\n\nJohn Swainson, president of Dell's software group, said that security is an important issue for Dell's customers and that the company is building a software portfolio to address those needs.\n\n\"SonicWall gives us access to best-in-class resources and technology and positions us well in a fast-growing part of the software security business,\" he said.\n\nFounded in 1991, SonicWall is headquartered in San Jose, Calif., and serves customers in 50 countries. It has 950 employees, who will be added to the Dell team.\n\nDell said it plans continued investments to expand the business.\n\nMatt Medeiros, SonicWall's president and CEO, said his team is \"looking forward to being an integral function enabling Dell's software and security vision.\"\n\nHe said the acquisition is good for SonicWall and its customers.\n\n\"We believe that taking this step with Dell is a very natural progression of our business and offers our customers and channel partners some great advantages that are not available today, given our size and scale,\" Medeiros said. \"It's exciting to think about the potential of integrating SonicWall's technology, R&D capabilities with Dell's reach, existing solutions and reputation.\"\n\nAnalysts at Robert W. Baird & Co. said they didn't expect Dell's shares to be affected by the purchase due to the \"relatively small size\" of the acquisition.\n\n\"We consider network security one of the most strategic categories within IT today and view the SonicWall acquisition as a good fit with Dell's product portfolio, customer base and enterprise solutions strategy,\" the firm said in a news release.\n\nContact Kirk Ladendorf at 445-3622 and Brian Gaar at 912-5932"
