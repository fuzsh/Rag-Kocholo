        "text": "Today, SonicWall announced a massive slate of hardware and software updates. SonicWall announced plans to release several new firewall appliances. The software updates are even more extensive and include several new software-defined firewall products. SonicWall was founded in 1991. The current CEO, Bill Conner, has been in that position since November 2016. SonicWall was a Dell subsidiary from 2012 to 2016 and currently focuses on network security.\n\nToday, SonicWall announced a massive slate of hardware and software updates. SonicWall announced plans to release several new firewall appliances. The software updates are even more extensive and include several new software-defined firewall products. SonicWall was founded in 1991. The current CEO, Bill Conner, has been in that position since November 2016. SonicWall was a Dell subsidiary from 2012 to 2016 and currently focuses on network security.\n\nSonicWall announced several new firewall appliances today. Based on their names, the new TZ570 and TZ670 will probably be mid-cycle updates up of their existing entry-level TZ500 and TZ600 appliances. Both new TZ firewall appliances support 5G and secure SD-Branch. SonicWall also announced a larger NSsp 15700 firewall appliance. Unlike the smaller models, there is no existing 15000 line. Instead, the NSsp 15700 will be joining the existing NSsp 12400 and NSsp 12800 models. The NSsp 15700 will have multiple 100/40/10 GbE interfaces and integrated TLS 1.3 support. All of the new appliances will be running the latest, and also just announced, 7.0 version of SonicWall’s operating system.\n\nSonicWall also announced that both their SonicWallOS and SonicWallOSX operating systems will be updating to version 7.0. In the same announcement, SonicWall told us that they’d be updating Network Security Manager (NSM) to 2.0. The company told us that all three software version changes come with all-new user interfaces that the company hopes will increase visibility, management, and control. According to the company, NSM has had particularly drastic changes. They said that NSM 2.0 had been rebuilt from the ground up to address some of the speed and scaling issues they’d been having. The new version can supposedly monitor and manage tens of thousands of network security devices, including firewalls, managed switches, and wireless access points.\n\nSonicWall’s announcement today didn’t end there. The company is also updating its NSv virtual firewall lineup. Unfortunately, SonicWall did not share any details about their upcoming NSv 270, NSv 470 & NSv 870 virtual firewalls. We do know that all three will have integrated TLS 1.3 support.\n\nSonicWall wrapped up their announcement by telling us that their new SonicWall CSa 1000 would be an on-premise unit with RTDMI technology.\n\nSonicWall Main Site\n\nEngage with StorageReview"
