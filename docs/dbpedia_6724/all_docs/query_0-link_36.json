Dell has decided to sell Dell Software Group, its division dedicated to software, to the investment fund Francisco Partners and the venture capital firm Elliott Management. A definitive agreement between the three parties was announced in an official press release on June 20.\n\nSeeking money to fund its $67 billion EMC acquisition, Dell should be able to cash more than $2 billion, information not confirmed by the Texan company yet.\n\nSince announcing the acquisition of EMC , Dell has engaged in several divestments that are essential for financing the deal, which is based mostly on indebtedness. In March, the Japanese NTT Data Corp acquired Dell’s consulting division for more than $3 billion."
