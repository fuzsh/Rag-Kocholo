        "text": "After many months, the $67 billion dollar Dell / EMC / VMware merger deal has regulatory clearance, making way for the biggest tech merger ever to become official on September 7th, 2016.\n\nThe newly combined, privately-held Dell Technologies will employ 140,000 people around the world and bring many popular lT product lines under a single roof. According to Michael Dell, who will remain CEO after the merger, this union will give the resulting company \"unmatched scale, strength and flexibility, deepening our relationships with customers of all sizes.” In terms of future product direction, Dell said the company will focus on the “most strategic areas of next generation IT including digital transformation, software-defined data center, converged infrastructure, hybrid cloud, mobile and security.”\n\nReading between the lines, the deal is a move to better insulate Dell against the trend of companies turning to public cloud providers such as AWS and Azure to host IT services instead of buying on-premises infrastructure. The new company will own more pieces of the entire data center, and in theory should be able to better vertically integrate the various pieces of the solution stack by combining Dell’s server and networking hardware, EMC’s storage portfolio, and VMware’s virtualization / software defined networking layer.\n\nRegarding the push for the merger , EMC CEO Joe Tucci perhaps said it best: “The waves of change we now see in our industry are unprecedented and, to navigate this change, we must create a new company for a new era.”\n\nWhat’s your take on the merger? Are you more optimistic about the combined company being able to deliver the products, services, and support that will to help solve your IT challenges, or are you wary of change?\n\nAlso, do you have any IT experiences to share from prior tech mergers?"
