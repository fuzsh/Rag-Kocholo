        "text": "The rising number of cyberattacks we’ve witnessed in the past years have given way to some new technology on the market. The SonicWall Gen 7 is a great example of this, and it’s helping to protect small and medium-sized businesses during these tough times. Buy a SonicWall Firewall here today to help your business stay ahead of the competition and avoid cyberattacks. Let’s take a look at the benefits of this new product range and how it will help your business in the future.\n\nWhat is the SonicWall Gen 7 Firewall?\n\nThe SonicWall Gen 7 firewall range is some of the newest products on the market. This range of products is powered by SonicOS 7.0, which offers many benefits over other products out there today. It offers high-level performance for small and medium-sized businesses, and you’ll find that the high port density and other features make it a great value for money solution for most businesses. Any SonicWall firewall will protect you from even the most stealthy attackers. With the advancements in technology, these attacks are only becoming more and more difficult to avoid. However, SonicWall hardware is designed to protect your business and ensure you keep doing what you do best for many years to come.\n\nSonicWall TZ Series\n\nThe incredible SonicWall TZ Series offers great performance levels for companies of all sizes. You’ll find that the automatic breach detection helps to avoid anything from getting into your system, as does the exceptional malware protection. With thirty years of experience in the industry, it’s no surprise the company has managed to create such a great product. It works at a very high speed and offers advanced threat prevention for businesses. We love that it offers up to 10 ports and can be expanded to provide up to 256G of storage. Finally, while it does offer all of these benefits, you’ll find that it’s very user-friendly. It has a single glass management pane, which you can learn to use very quickly once it’s installed.\n\nThe New SonicOS 7\n\nTo power the new SonicWall Gen 7 products, the SonicOS 7 system is one of the most high-tech operating systems in the cybersecurity world. It was built to deliver a modern user interface while keeping intuitive workflows in mind. You’ll find that it offers multiple features to facilitate workflows and is easy to manage. This allows businesses of any size to improve their efficiency, operations, and security. Any of the products that use this OS are incredible and will help you with sandboxing technology, Real-Time Deep Memory Inspection, and URL filtering.\n\nIt’s an excellent solution for businesses that have yet to invest in a firewall.

We highly recommend that you buy a SonicWall firewall if you don’t have one already. If you are using one of the older options on the market, it may be time to consider an upgrade.

But as cybercriminals have grown more sophisticated and successful, they’ve also grown more ruthless — many of the high-profile ransomware attacks in 2021 looked more like acts of war than ever before, endangering our food supply, our water supply, our fuel supply, our hospitals and our municipalities.\n\nThat the courts ultimately decided cyberattacks such as NotPetya do not, in fact, constitute acts of war is irrelevant: Fed up with cybercriminals growing rich off their constituents, leaders around the world — from the local level to the international stage — have brought the war to them.\n\nThe UN Cybersecurity Open-Ended Working Group in March 2021 endorsed a report containing cybersecurity recommendations, the first time that a process open to all countries has resulted in consensus on international cybersecurity.\n\nIn May 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a sweeping executive order on cybersecurity, which unifies cybersecurity standards across government agencies, emphasizes zero-trust principles and provides specific timelines for action.\n\nIn July, INTERPOL held its forum on ransomware. Advising that effectively preventing and disrupting ransomware would require “adopting the same international collaboration used to fight terrorism, human trafficking or mafia groups,” the group called for police agencies worldwide to form a global coalition with industry partners to stop ransomware’s exponential growth.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest testament to the threat ransomware poses to national security is the involvement of the U.S. military. In an interview with The New York Times, U.S. Cyber Command head Gen. Paul M. Nakasone explained that, while he once saw ransomware as the responsibility of law enforcement, attacks such as Colonial Pipeline and JBS represented a big enough threat to the nation’s critical infrastructure to warrant a more aggressive approach.\n\nBut this approach likely won’t include boots on the ground — an option that proves challenging given that a vast majority of these ransomware operators are in other countries, most of which are not U.S. allies and tend to only go after cybercriminals when it serves their agenda.\n\nWhile high-profile arrests of cybercriminals continue, such as the REvil takedown in early 2022, they have been largely ineffective in stemming the tide of ransomware itself. The amount of time and resources required for each bust means that the criminal justice system is unable to keep up with the huge number of ransomware operators. And due to the lucrative nature of ransomware, as soon as one group is taken down, new ones rise to fill the void.\n\nInstead, this approach will look a lot like their most ruthless attacks on civilians: a direct assault on their infrastructure. Pressure on the U.S. government to deploy intelligence and military solutions to attack the servers, networks and more used for cybercrime, dissemination of stolen data on the dark web and storing cryptocurrency payments is growing.\n\nWhile he refrained from giving details, Nakasone confirmed that the military has taken an offensive stance against ransomware groups. One known example is when Cyber Command assisted in the recovery of millions in ransom that Colonial Pipeline paid to attackers.\n\nThough recoveries such as this have historically been rare, this may be the first in an emerging trend. A major factor credited in this recovery is the work of a recently formed Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force. In an interview with Reuters, a senior U.S. DOJ official said the formation of this task force “elevates investigations of ransomware attacks to a similar priority as terrorism.”\n\nAs the amount of media attention and government involvement in the wake of high-profile attacks increases, these groups have grown wary, with many laying low or disappearing altogether. This could lead to groups lowering ransom demands in hopes of flying under the radar and continuing to hack another day — which could contribute to fewer attacks if success no longer means netting a life-changing fortune for the entire syndicate.\n\nIn other words, in the end, the most lethal shots to ransomware may well be the ones that hit where it hurts most: the wallet.\n\nRead the full 66 page report here: https://www.sonicwall.com/medialibrary/en/white-pa...\n\nhile you might have heard the term disaster recovery plan used in reference to other areas of your business before, you also need to think about this in terms of cybersecurity. A disaster continuity plan will help to protect you should a major disaster occur. Check out our firewall page here for more information about the products, which will be a huge part of this plan. They’ll help to avoid issues in the first place, offering your business years of protection during the most challenging of times.\n\nWhat is a Disaster Recovery Plan?\n\nA disaster recovery plan is sometimes referred to as an IT disaster recovery plan. It’s designed to help a business to execute their recovery process quickly and efficiently if any form of issue was to occur within their workplace. It is needed within any business that has an IT infrastructure, which is pretty much every business in the world today. It promotes speedy recovery, which is why a disaster continuity plan is so important to help your business get back on its feet following a disaster of any type.\n\nThe disaster recovery plan will lay out what your team should do before, during, or after the attack. As well as cybersecurity attacks, these plans can help you to recover following a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or tornado. You’ll also find these are used to discuss terrorism backup plans, which are sadly becoming more of a concern for businesses. No matter what situation your team find themselves in, a network disaster recovery plan can help to get you back to work as soon as possible.\n\nWho Should Have a Disaster Recovery Plan?\n\nBusinesses of all shapes and sizes need a disaster recovery plan in order to manage their data. A lot of this data is critical for a business to survive, so you need to ensure the right steps are taken to avoid these issues. No matter how secure you believe your business is, cyberattacks are becoming more complex year after year. This plan can help provide a backup plan for any type of attack. It will be part of your wider business continuity plan, which discusses every element of your business and how you’ll react after a disaster.\n\nMost companies have a plan in place for other types of issues, but they often don’t touch on the IT elements of the business. These are now so crucial to businesses, which is why a separate plan is needed with your IT systems in mind. You’ll need to analyse how your business operations will be impacted if you lose any of your data or hardware. In this situation, you’ll then need to have a backup plan ready to implement, which you can use to get back to the most important tasks you have to do. You can learn from past issues and lessons in order to create this plan, as well as read case studies from other businesses in your industry.\n\nAs well as focusing on the recovery after a disaster, you’ll find that business continuity and disaster recovery is something you need to think about before anything even happens. You need to train your team to ensure they know what to do each day to avoid issues. From there, they also need to be briefed about how to react if an emergency was to occur. The more people who know how to look out for cyberattacks, the more likely you’ll be to protect your company in the future. Products such as the SonicWall Gen 7 are here to support you and your BCDR with that task and minimise the chance of an attack in the first place.\n\nGoals in Your Disaster Recovery Plan\n\nA huge part of your business continuity strategy is writing down the goals you have in mind for your disaster recovery plan. You’ll find that these should state what you hope to achieve following a disaster. This should focus on your recovery time and the objective of recovery. You’ll want to state how much data you can afford to lose and how quickly you need to get everything back up and running to avoid disrupting your business. A network firewall is a huge part of this process and will help to reduce the chance of extensive downtime for your business. For small and medium-sized businesses, we highly recommend investing in a SonicWall firewall, which will protect your business from potential disasters.\n\nBy creating a disaster recovery plan, you’ll help to prepare yourself for any potential issues in the future. We encourage you to invest in a SonicWall firewall, which will be one of the main components of this plan. No matter what size of business you operate, it’s never too late to take action to avoid future issues and protect your business for years to come.\n\nNational Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) explains the logic behind its long-standing password advice for the first time\n\nUsing three random words is more secure than traditional advice built around ‘password complexity’, experts argue\n\nApproach allows creation of passwords to ‘keep the bad guys out’ whilst remaining easy to remember\n\nCyber security experts have today (Friday) revealed in depth for the first time the logic behind their advice to use three random words when creating passwords.\n\nIn a new blog post, experts at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) – which is a part of GCHQ – said a key reason for using three random words is they create a password which is easy to remember and strong enough to keep online accounts secure from cyber criminals.\n\nThe blog post noted that using three random words to coin a password is more effective than traditional advice to create complex passwords, which can be difficult to remember and yet guessable for criminals.\n\nOther reasons for choosing the three random words approach were:\n\nLength. Passwords made from multiple words will generally be longer than passwords made from a single word and therefore meet minimum length requirements.\n\nImpact. 'Three random words' contains all the essential information in the title, and can be quickly explained, even to those who don't consider themselves computer experts.\n\nNovelty. A password containing multiple words encourages a range of passwords that have not previously been considered.\n\nUsability. It’s easier for users to enter a three random word password than one which contains a complex range of characters.\n\nNCSC Technical Director Dr Ian Levy, said:\n\n“Traditional password advice telling us to remember multiple complex passwords is simply daft.\n\n“There are several good reasons why we decided on the three random words approach – not least because they create passwords which are both strong and easier to remember.\n\n“By following this advice, people will be much less vulnerable to cyber criminals, and I'd encourage people to think about the passwords they use on their important accounts, and consider a password manager.”\n\nRocio Concha, Which? Director of Policy and Advocacy, said:\n\n“Ensuring you use strong yet memorable passwords online and with smart products is more important than ever – our research has repeatedly highlighted poor security practices in a range of connected devices, from routers and wireless cameras to apps.\n\n“There’s a reason why new legislation announced by the government to improve standards for smart devices includes a ban on generic default passwords – these can make it easy for hackers to take control of devices or even your home network.\n\n“Strong passwords can stop cyber criminals in their tracks, and we’d urge everyone to ensure they adopt good practice to safeguard their data and privacy.”\n\nCreating passwords using three random words is one of the six key steps recommended by the cross government Cyber Aware campaign to protect accounts and devices from most cyber crime.

These vulnerabilities have only worked to show how critical cybersecurity protection is for businesses of all shapes and sizes. Go to the homepage here to learn more about how to protect yourself as we face these mounting concerns surrounding Log4Shell. Keep reading as we share with you the top tools to face these issues and protect your business in 2022.\n\nWhat is the Issue with Log4Shell currently?\n\nLog4Shell is the nickname that’s been given to the current vulnerability found within Log4j. As Log4j is used within so many applications, this has disrupted the software development industry more than anyone could have ever anticipated. With people reporting that their system has been hacked, it’s more important than ever to consider SonicWall products for your workplace.\n\nThe current issue with Log4j impacts laptops, mobile devices, and desktop computers using this software. However, many systems are at no risk whatsoever if they aren’t using anything which involves Log4j in its development. We are finding that companies that use web-based applications and internet-facing services are experiencing the most issues currently, but the Log4Shell vulnerability can be exploited by anyone to gain access to your system.\n\nHow to Overcome the Log4j Flaw\n\nThe good news is that help is at hand for anyone who fears they might be impacted by the Log4j vulnerabilities. You’ll find that SonicWall software and SonicWall firewalls are a good way to protect your business from both this current issue and further cyberattacks we may experience in 2022. This is the best way to secure your business and ensure you don’t lose precious data from your system this year. Another top tip for anyone who is concerned about whether Log4j was used in their applications is to keep everything up to date. If you are using Log4j in software development projects, make sure you update this to the most recent addition. They are working to make updates and overcome this issue, so you can continue safely using it.\n\nThe biggest issue with the current Log4j flaw is that it’s more of a back-end issue which isn’t so obvious to most business owners. Of course, your IT team may be more informed about these issues, but many people just keep working as usual without realising they might be risking their systems. The attackers are still trying to get through these huge gaps in the systems, which means they are causing havoc for companies around the world. There have certainly been some worrying reports about this flaw, and we encourage you to act quickly to avoid any further issues for your business.\n\nWhat to Do If You Use Log4j\n\nIf your business is a direct user of Log4j, you need to take immediate action to overcome this issue. We recommend updating to the current version, which should have some of the flaws fixed. With older versions, make sure you go ahead and disable the lookup functionality. From there, you’ll need to restrict outbound connections, which will offer you an allow list that filters through anyone using your system. We highly recommend thinking about a long-term solution for security though, as it is likely this will be an ongoing issue throughout 2022.\n\nThe Benefits of SonicWall Products\n\nTo help overcome the Log4j flaw, we recommend looking into SonicWall products if you don’t already use them. They are some of the best options on the market to protect your business from cyberattacks this year. Even if you don’t feel too concerned about the Log4j flaw, we recommend taking this action anyway to ensure you are protected within your business.\n\nThe great thing about SonicWall is that it’s suitable for businesses of all shapes and sizes. Many small business owners think they don’t need to worry about these solutions, but that isn’t the case at all. You are just as vulnerable to an attack as a large corporation, and in most cases, this could completely devastate your business.\n\nThe Log4j flaw is something that we encourage all business owners to keep up to date with over the next few months. We hope this issue goes away soon, but sadly, it’s already caused a lot of problems for companies around the world. The sooner you put a system in place to protect yourself from cyberattacks, the more likely you’ll be to enjoy years of success within your business.

While there have already been some updates to Log4j, you’ll find that there are still some things you need to be aware of when using this tool. Keep reading to discover what Log4j is and how sonicwall-sales.com can help you to remain secure within your business this year.\n\nWhat is Log4j?\n\nLog4j is used to create modern software, and it’s something that many organisations rely on for this task. It’s often part of the software library that you’ll use instead of writing endless code for your new software. Modern software is incredibly complex, and so the more tools that are used to make this process simpler and quicker, the better it is for everyone involved. These building blocks all come together to make powerful software without having to commit endless hours to the task. Instead of one author taking control of the full project, they can pull from other resources to find the right solutions to speed up this work.\n\nThe main purpose of Log4j for software developers is to help them keep on top of what happens within their online services and applications. It’s quite similar to a notes page or journal, which tracks and monitors all of your activity. The logging process will help to identify any issues you are experiencing, which gives the users of the application or software a better overall experience.\n\nIssues With Log4j\n\nAs you can see, Log4j is a useful tool for software developers across the country. However, in recent times, we’ve heard about Log4j vulnerabilities, which have been a huge source of concern for users. This vulnerability means there’s an increased chance of hackers getting into the system and stealing crucial data from businesses. If they manage to extract this data, they can infect the network and wreak havoc for the businesses they’ve targeted. Log4j is used by companies around the world, so as you can imagine, news of this concern has spread quickly in the software development community. Over the upcoming years, you’ll find that this issue may only get worse, so it’s important to know if you are potentially affected by this concerning issue.\n\nWho Should Be Concerned About the Issues with Log4j?\n\nIf you aren’t sure if the Log4j configuration issues will impact you, it’s important to learn how the Log4j properties which are vulnerable could impact your business. Any software has some type of log attached to it, and many software products rely on Log4j for this purpose. As a business owner, you need to think about whether your web applications and software use Log4j. We highly recommend you work with our team to find a way to protect yourself in the future and ensure you have SonicWall items in place to protect businesses of any size. For individual users, you need to make sure you stay up to date with your software updates. This will help to overcome any issues in the upcoming months with Log4j. If you are operating a business from home, SonicWall products may also be worth considering during this time.\n\nIf you know for certain that you are using Log4j within your business, make sure you update to the most recent edition of the product. Keep all other applications up to date as well, as these may use Log4j within them. As companies figure out whether they are impacted by these issues, they’ll likely release patches and updates to overcome any security concerns. Ask your software developers or suppliers if you are unsure whether you are impacted by these issues. We can advise you about SonicWall products which will also help to overcome any future concerns about Log4j properties and the way in which they could disrupt your business. We know that this isn’t the type of thing that any business wants to deal with, but it’s important you protect yourself and get the new year off to a good start without any concerns.\n\nThere are so many concerning stories floating around online about Log4j and the current issues, but you need to make sure you find a solution that works for your business.

Contact our team today for more information about how we can help you to overcome cyberattacks and the current issues with Log4j.\n\nWhen a cyberattack occurs within your business, you need to be prepared to act immediately. One of the most common questions we receive is when should a cyberattack be reported, and today, we’re here to ensure you know how to react within the first 24 hours of this incident. Keep reading as we share our top tips for reacting quickly to cyberattacks to help protect your business this year. Our firewall page will give you a good idea of some of the tools on the market which are designed to help protect your business from this happening in the first place.\n\nThe Cyberattack Crisis\n\nOne of the most shocking statistics we hear in regard to cyberattacks is the lack of a plan that most companies have. Roughly 77% of businesses don’t have a response plan in place should an incident occur on their property. These cyberattacks can cost you millions of dollars, and over half of businesses will cease trading within just six months of a cyberattack. For that reason, you need to ensure you have a plan in place to react to a cyberattack. No matter how big or small your company is, finding a solution that will protect your systems is crucial for your ongoing success. Make sure you take this really seriously, as this might be the one thing that saves your business this year.\n\nThe first thing to keep in mind is the types of firewalls on offer for your business. A SonicWall firewall is the first line of defence that everyone needs. Products such as the Soho firewall and the Sonic firewall will try to stop these issues from taking place in the first place. By having the right security on hand at all times, you can be sure you will keep threats out before they take their toll on your business operations. However, in the small chance that a cyberattack will take place even with a firewall in place, make sure you know how to react immediately in order to have the best chance of survival.\n\nReact Quickly\n\nThe first 24 hours are the time that’s most important for responding to a cyberattack. At this time, you can work quickly to try and reduce the damage that’s taking place within your business. You’ll need to have a plan in place for who to contact and how to restore your security as soon as possible. If you can fully contain your breach within just a few days or the first month, you’ll find you save a fortune during this time. Try to find where the issue occurred and put measures in place straight away to stop this from ruining your business further.\n\nAn Incident Response Team\n\nOne of the key parts of cyberattack preparation is knowing when a cyberattack should be reported to senior management. You need to have a clear chain of command within your organisation should this type of incident occur. Have an incident response team in place at all times, and make sure you only have active employees with experience in this area on the team. Everyone in your organisation needs to know when a cyberattack should be reported so that you can do your best to prepare for this type of incident. When there is a clear chain of communication, you’ll find that you can quickly respond to any issues.\n\nTraining Within Your Team\n\nWhile you might think that how to prepare for a cyberattack in the future is only important for your IT team, this isn’t the case at all. Anyone who uses a computer or device within your business is at risk of being the victim of a cyberattack. You need to ensure that everyone knows how to respond and isn’t afraid to talk about this openly with senior management. People often fear that they will get the blame for doing something wrong, but cyberattacks occur out of the blue for no reason at times. Don’t make your employees afraid to report a cyberattack, so ensure your management will react calmly and be considerate to anyone who has concerns about your computer systems. By getting everyone on board, you’ll have more eyes and ears at all times looking out for the signs of cyberattacks.\n\nWhen your business has a plan of action in place to overcome cyberattacks, you’ll find you are much more likely to respond quickly to this type of issue. Ensure that everyone in your business is trained in this area and that they know how to respond to issues that appear. Make sure communication is clear at all times and that everyone knows who they can turn to in the future if any issue is to come up. Our team will be here to support you on your cybersecurity journey and ensure you have all the tools in place to minimise the chance of an attack happening in the first place.\n\nRead next article: The Best Year Yet for SonicWall\n\nCybersecurity is something that every single employee in your organisation needs to be aware of. This includes the new intern through to the CEO of the company. When it comes to cybersecurity for boards, you’ll want to ensure you have a SonicWall firewall by SonicWall-Sales in place as the first step before talking to them about the ways you can get everyone in your organisation on board with cybersecurity. Keep reading as we share our top tips for cybersecurity for businesses in any industry this year.\n\nIdentify the Critical Systems\n\nBefore even starting to discuss cybersecurity with your CEO and board, you’ll want to ensure you have a SonicWall firewall in place. Without SonicWall firewalls, you’ll find that you don’t even have anything to show that you are making the first step to protecting the organisation. Your CEO needs to be aware of the benefits of SonicWall firewalls so that they know there is protection in place at all times for your business. No matter the type of business you work for, the more involved your CEO is with cybersecurity, the more likely this will be to filter down your organisation. They need to look at how systems will help protect your revenue and ensure that confidential information is kept safe at all times.\n\nOnce you’ve identified your critical systems within IT, also look at any systems you have for manufacturing or other areas of your business. You’ll find that they are equipped with technology too, which could become the victim of a cyberattack. Make sure your supply chain is safe at all times so that you don’t risk losing any of your business or customers should a cyberattack take place.\n\nDiscuss the Risks to the Business\n\nFor many IT teams, they are concerned about having open conversations with CEOs and boards about their critical systems. Cyberattack preparation can be a tough topic to bring up with the board, but it’s important to be open and honest about this issue. Cybersecurity for boards needs to be treated differently than your cybersecurity IT team would talk to your employees. That’s why some companies opt to use cybersecurity consulting. This is a good way to break down cybersecurity for CEOs and make it more applicable to their top concerns within your business. Once the CEO and board are more aware of the risks of cyberattacks to your daily operations, they’ll be far more likely to support you with training your employees and responding to incidents.\n\nHave a Plan in Place for Attacks\n\nWhen you first start working with the CEO and board to make them more aware of cybersecurity, you need to ensure your IT team has a plan in place for a potential attack. When an attack occurs, you need to try and respond within just 24 hours so that you have the best chance of recovery for your organisation. You should have an emergency team that everyone knows to contact and who the CEO and board will be familiar with talking to about these issues. You’ll find that when everyone knows who to call if they notice an issue, you’ll be much more likely to respond quickly and save your business from potential ruin.\n\nPlan Cyberattack Practices\n\nWhile this might sound a little silly to some businesses, the best way to test out your current setup is to plan a mock attack. You can get everyone on board in your organisation in the way you would with a fire alarm test. You’ll be able to see who notices the attack and how they respond to it. This is an exercise in cybersecurity for business that everyone should adopt. It will help to keep you prepared and ensure all of your team knows how to respond in an emergency. The more often you start doing these drills, the smoother your operations will become. Everyone will feel confident responding to an attack, from the CEO down to the newest employee in your business.\n\nBy following these top cybersecurity tips, you can ensure everyone in your business remains dedicated to cybersecurity this year. Your CEO and board need to support this movement at all times so that you remain in compliance and stop anything from entering your system. When they start to see the financial impact it could have on the company, you’ll find they are much more likely to pay attention to the protection you have in place for your systems.

We’ll be happy to work with your employees to find a solution that’s right for your business and support you during this concerning time when we see more cyberattacks than ever before on businesses.\n\nNo matter how complex, every business and network must be protected from vulnerabilities, cyber threats and attacks as soon as they occur, not minutes, hours, or days afterwards.\n\nThere are always new and evolving threats to networks, and often, many of these threats go unnoticed or undetected as hackers continue to try and insert destructive malware, attack system infrastructures and steal sensitive data.\n\nHowever, with the right firewall and the implementation of continuous monitoring, businesses can be confident that their security levels remain high, and teams can act quickly when a threat is detected.\n\nThere is a vast range of types of firewalls currently on the market, and at www.sonicwall-sales.com/firewalls, you will find everything you need to know as well as a helpful team on hand to answer your questions.\n\nThe importance of continuous security monitoring\n\nVulnerability management\n\nContinuous security monitoring is the ongoing monitoring of networks and checking their security status 24/7, identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting network vulnerabilities.\n\nWith servers, desktops, cloud, virtual, and containerised assets needing to be scanned for vulnerabilities, security monitoring is required so actual or attempted security attacks are found, with appropriate processes in place to respond.\n\nUltimately continuous monitoring helps businesses manage risk better.\n\nLooking at the activity that could negatively impact your network assets and systems\n\nAlways monitoring threats\n\nReporting unnecessary exposure\n\nMonitoring unauthorised changes and misconfigurations\n\nDetecting security vulnerabilities\n\nProviding you with compliance to industry standards and regulations\n\nIdentifying threats and missed security issues in set policies\n\nProducing detailed reports\n\nProviding policy documentation to meet compliance requirements\n\nDecertifying all mandated firewall rules and configurations\n\nProviding greater depth security intelligence.\n\nSonicWall's firewalls matched with continuous processing delves into sets of rules, comparing these against any proposed changes to internal network and system checks.\n\nAll regulated businesses held to the standard must include continuous monitoring as part of their security processes.\n\nContinuous monitoring of best practices\n\nRegulatory standards require constant compliance, which means you must continually check your systems for potential security threats a there is no network time off!\n\nFor businesses, continuous monitoring helps avoid data breaches, potential penalties, legal action, and even loss of reputation.\n\nThis is why maintaining visibility into network changes is essential, providing businesses with a greater understanding of what is happening to the network and why. Knowing, with confidence, that your data and intellectual property are safe, your security protocols are adequate, and your policies and processes can be followed and indeed work.\n\nTo help, some of the best practices you could implement into your processes include:\n\nRisk assesses your systems and data, adding values to assets that allow you to prioritise and quantify risk in a more manageable way, providing you with a clear picture of your network environment.\n\nChoose the right security solution for your network and apply the right policies and processes that directly affect the identified risks.\n\nEnsure that when you buy the SonicWall firewall, it integrates seamlessly with all vulnerability scanners and more.\n\nProvide adequate controls that work with your security policies.\n\nContinue to assess and review all controls to ensure 100% protection at all times.\n\nTrack all changes and any impact these changes may or may not have.\n\nMaintain tight security controls to ensure full compliance with policies.\n\nLook for collaboration and influence from peers and leadership teams, using a common language with shared objectives.\n\nIntegrate your vulnerability risk management processes with internal tools and processes, so remediation efforts can seamlessly flow through all existing networks, finding and fixing vulnerabilities instantly.\n\nThe perfect solution\n\nTo provide you with the best visibility, security, and flexibility, look for a firewall solution that can offer you:\n\nReal-time monitoring and security analysis\n\nPolicy search options\n\nTraffic flow analysis (understand network behaviour and firewall policies)\n\nModelling and testing (impact of potential changes)\n\nCustomisable reporting with flexibility based on context\n\nCollection of live vulnerability data from all identified endpoints.\n\nDynamic dashboards that showcase behaviour trends and allow you to track the progress of security programmes easily.\n\nAnd so much more.\n\nThe focus is on making networks more secure at the moment, accessing actionable intelligence through continuous and historical data.\n\nContinuous monitoring analyses millions of vulnerabilities in seconds, so you can proactively secure your networks and make the best and informed decision for your security requirements.\n\nToday, as working from home becomes more of the norm, it has become even more challenging for security teams to manage and control their networks, let alone defend them from attacks.\n\nWe need to understand risk at every level, understand the complete IT landscape and business environment, and have a clear picture of overall risk from existing to new assets joining the network.\n\nFirewalls and security processes and policies should be reviewed regularly to ensure that they still provide the level of security required and that they meet the business needs.\n\nTo find the right firewall for you and your business network, call our team today on 0330 1340 230 or email enquiries@sonicwall-sales.com.\n\nWhile the internet offers us a wealth of incredible information and advice, youâ€™ll find there are so many online security myths out there today. When you start to believe thesemyths, you put your business and systems at risk. Today weâ€™re here to debunk some of the top myths our team of SonicWall Sales experts has seen over the years. Weâ€™ll put your mind at rest and help you find the best SonicWall firewall solution to fit your business needs.\n\n1. Small Businesses Wonâ€™t Be Attacked Online\n\nThe internet is a massive place, and no one is safe from hackers today. You might think that just because your company only has a few devices or you just work on your phone, you donâ€™t need to protect yourself with a Sonic firewall. Thatâ€™s not the case at all. Regardless of how many computers and pieces of software your business uses, you need to ensure you are protecting yourself from attacks. Each year, these attacks are getting more and more complex, meaning anyone is open to these issues. These hackers are becoming even more advanced, which is why you need to start protecting yourself now before itâ€™s too late.\n\n2. All You Need is a Firewall and Antivirus Software\n\nUsing SonicWall firewalls is one of the best ways to protect yourself from hackers and other issues. We also recommend looking into antivirus software to make it less likely for an intruder to access your system. However, that doesnâ€™t mean you can do anything online and just have no concerns about security. As a business owner, we recommend that you make sure you keep your software up to date and educate your team about online security. So often, these attacks occur as a result of someone not understanding the risks involved with clicking links or opening attachments online. The more business online security you can offer your employees, the more youâ€™ll protect your organisation in the future. On top of that, also think about endpoint protection if you have a lot of your team working from home still to protect your business wherever itâ€™s operating from.\n\n3. Mac vs Windows\n\nWhen it comes to using different types of computers, most people naturally think that Apple products are completely protected from intruders. However, youâ€™ll be surprised by how much risk is still out there for Mac users. While they are usually more secure than Windows devices, this doesnâ€™t mean they are immune from any issues. Youâ€™ll find that as this type of device has become used more often, there is more risk for Apple users. This is one of the top cyber security myths and one you should keep in mind when purchasing new devices for your workplace in the future.\n\n4. The Cloud is Too Risky for Businesses to Use\n\nThe cloud is one of the newer inventions that businesses are now relying on each day. We have started to hear more news stories about hacking in the cloud, but that doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t a great option for your company. In fact, when you offer yourself the right protection, youâ€™ll find that itâ€™s a great way to store data away from your hardware. Make sure you compare cloud services before selecting the one thatâ€™s right for your company. For the most secure option, try and find one with a private server, which will offer you full security without sharing your server with anyone else. There are different options for any type of business, so research the solutions out there and discuss with our team how we can help you to protect yourself when working in the cloud.\n\n5. Protecting Your Computer Will Slow It Down\n\nA reason that some companies tell us they arenâ€™t interested in using a firewall is that it might slow down your computer. With the advanced technology on offer today, youâ€™ll find this isnâ€™t the case at all. You donâ€™t need to worry about your software or hardware working slower, as this just isnâ€™t an issue with modern SonicWall firewalls. Youâ€™ll still be able to complete your work at the same speed as before while also knowing you are fully protected from malware and hackers. This is one investment you shouldnâ€™t skip over and it will ensure you give yourself the protection you need for many years to come.\n\nThese are just five of the top online security myths we are constantly hearing today. If you have thought one of these myths is true for a while now, itâ€™s time to start protecting your systems from potential attacks. With options on offer for companies of any size, itâ€™s never too late to start protecting your work further.
