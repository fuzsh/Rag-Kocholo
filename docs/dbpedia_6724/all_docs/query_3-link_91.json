        "text": "Ratios valuation of SonicWALL Inc. ( SNWL | USA)\n\nThe N/A ratio (also called EBITDA multiple or enterprise multiple) is a well-known company valuation metric that compares a company's overall value to its operational earning power. The N/A ratio is very commonly used for business valuation as it indicates whether a company may be undervalued or overvalued compared to industry peers. The N/A ratio is a more precise measure than the P/E ratio because it takes into account both the company pure operational earning measure (EBITDA vs. Net Profit) and a company overall value indicator that also includes financial debt, cash position and minority interests which are key indicators when valuing a firm market value. (Enterprise Value vs. Market Capitalization)\n\nThe N/A ratio of SonicWALL Inc. is significantly lower than the median of its peer group: around 9.00. According to these financial ratios SonicWALL Inc.'s valuation is way below the market valuation of its peer group.\n\nThe N/A ratio of SonicWALL Inc. is significantly lower than the average of its sector (Telecommunications Equipment): 9.32. According to these financial ratios SonicWALL Inc.'s valuation is way below the market valuation of its sector.\n\nThe N/A ratio of SonicWALL Inc. is significantly lower than its historical 5-year average: N/A. The (current) company valuation of SonicWALL Inc. is therefore way below its valuation average over the last five years."
