        "text": "Led by former President and CEO Bill Conner, SonicWall experienced more than six years of record growth and profitability. Conner, whose tenure as Executive Director of SonicWall’s Board of Directors concluded at the close of January 2023, has dedicated years of his career to cybersecurity — with many more likely to come — and laid out the path for the company’s future growth.\n\n“I am passionate about security and the positive impact that security has protecting people, data, information, governments and economies,” Conner once told Authority Magazine.\n\nAnd the impact of that passion is clear. Conner’s leadership helped reshape SonicWall at a pivotal time. It included:\n\nRelaunching the SonicWall brand in 2016\n\nRebuilding the global channel ecosystem\n\nInnovating critical virtual and cloud capabilities, including a 15% increase in cloud revenue and key subscription services\n\nIntroducing the progressive Boundless Cybersecurity model\n\nReleasing SonicWall’s market-leading RTDMI™ technology, which discovers hundreds of thousands of never-before-seen malware variants each year\n\nSuccessfully delivering a full suite of Generation 7 cybersecurity products and solutions\n\n“During my time with SonicWall, I was fortunate to lead an incredible team that delivered unprecedented financial performance, including more than eight consecutive quarters of double-digit top-line and bottom-line growth,” said Conner. “I couldn’t be happier with what was built at SonicWall while I was here, and the path that is now set for the company’s customers and partners for many years ahead.”\n\nWith a career spanning more than 30 years across high-tech industries, Conner is a seasoned global leader in cybersecurity, data protection and network infrastructure. He has re-engineered product lines, built world-class service organizations, re-aligned global sales organizations, and created industry-leading marketing campaigns.\n\n“The SonicWall team is grateful for Bill’s tenacity, leadership and vision,” said SonicWall President and CEO Bob VanKirk. “Personally, I can’t thank Bill enough for his dedication to the company, but also sharing his experience with me for over 20 years working together.”\n\nA staunch supporter of public-private cybersecurity partnerships, Conner regularly shares expertise with global leaders at major financial institutions, enterprises and governments. Conner has been quoted or featured in major global publications and television programs including The Financial Times, BBC News, Forbes, The Register, VentureBeat, The Hill and the Dallas Morning News.\n\nKey Milestones:\n\nNovember 2016: SonicWall formally spun out of Dell Software and acquired by Francisco Partners and Elliott Management.

The program, which launched in November 2016, grew 500% with more than 21,000 registered partners, 7,700 of which were new to SonicWall at the time.\n\nMay 2018: SonicWall continued to surpass the expectations set, which facilitated a recap accelerated by aggressive growth of the SonicWall Capture Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) service. Year-over-year, the multi-engine cloud sandbox service saw 188% revenue growth and a 150% increase in attachment rates.\n\nJanuary 2019: SonicWall announced plans to expand its global sales team and increase its marketing investment as the company continued to generate significant business momentum. SonicWall continued its launch of a range of new products and service enhancements.\n\nApril 2020: Already in position to help organizations remain operational during the COVID-19 pandemic, Conner introduced SonicWall’s Boundless Cybersecurity model designed to secure organizations that are increasingly remote, mobile, and less secure, and empower organizations and businesses to close the growing cybersecurity business and skills gaps.\n\nNovember 2021: Filling an urgent need for greater cybersecurity, SonicWall launches SonicOS 7 and 17 new firewalls in less than 18 months.\n\nApril 2022: The SonicWall Capture ATP service earned its fifth consecutive perfect score in independent ICSA Labs Advanced Threat Defense (ATD) certification testing across the last five quarters. At the time no other vendor currently participating had ever achieved two consecutive perfect scores.\n\nMay 2022: Bill Conner was nominated by SC Awards as a Security Executive of the Year Finalist.
