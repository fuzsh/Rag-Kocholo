        "text": "I received a response from SonicWall but it is a disappointing one.\n\nApp Visualization license is REQUIRED to send IPFIX data to an external collector.\n\nWe purchased this device based on the features. Had we known you need to pay extra to actually use those features we would have bought something else. We will be replacing this Sonicwall with a Cisco device.\n\nBelow is the actual response from Sonicwall:\n\nS:\n\n-customer mentioned that app flow data is going to the external collector on just one tid of 555\n\nA:\n\n-checked through the device\n\n-app visualisation was not licensed\n\n-informed customer that he needs to have the app visualisation license for the app flow data to be pushed across or activated\n\nP:\n\n-keeping case on pending closure\n\nI have emailed Dell on this but no response yet.\n\nI found another post which matches what I am experiencing. Read it here. https://answers.splunk.com/answers/512018/why-does-searching-indexsonicwall-only-returning-t.html\n\nThe jist of it is that Sonicwall seems to be only sending IPFIX template ids of 555 (tid=555). So it would seem that this is an issue with the device its self. Syslogging seems to work fine but if we don't get this resolved before our next purchase window we will probably replace this SonicWall with a Cisco ASA device. If I get a response from Dell I will add it as an answer."
