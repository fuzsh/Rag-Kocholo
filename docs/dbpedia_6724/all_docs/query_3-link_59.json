        "text": "Today’s society relies heavily on technology to make our lives easier. Occasionally we may experience growing pains in doing so, but the benefits surpass the struggle.\n\nOrange County Computer® is here to help. In recognition of our 10 year company anniversary, we will be covering topics each month via this eNewsletter. Our goal is to better educate our customers about technology related issues that are relevant to your needs. The topic this month will cover content filtering.\n\n” Routers and Security:\n\nHow do I keep my employees, spouse and children away\n\nfrom compromising websites?”\n\nAre you concerned about what your children are viewing on the Internet?\n\nAre your employees spending too much time online?\n\nDo you have issues with the security of your wireless network?\n\nIs someone in your home or office browsing porn-related sites like myspace.com, etc?\n\nAre you frustrated and not sure how to tackle these problems?\n\nWe are here to help\n\nWhen low quality, low cost Routers, (ex: Linksys, d-Link, Netgear) first hit the consumer marketplace, there were some concerns about the security of our information, but that was temporarily resolved by more secure updates and newer technology that was developed by the manufacturers. This made consumers feel safer and the sales and use of Routers became as mainstream as having internet access.\n\nSome of the issues that Orange County Computer® INC. has encountered over the last few years regarding the use of these residential grade routers is with the increased amount of virus infection, Spam and the piggybacking of unauthorized Internet users utilizing Internet connections of unknowing consumers or small businesses wide open internet browsing with no security on-site’s view.\n\nThere is a more secure solution for your home internet security, called a SonicWALL. A SonicWALL is a much more secure solution than the traditional Router in that it has customizable services that you can subscribe to that specifically meets the needs of your home or office network. The SonicWALL Routers are mutually beneficial to parents, home offices, small businesses and more!\n\nThe function of the SonicWALL is to allow the owner to customize the type of content allowed to be viewed over the internet by blocking websites that contain specific content that you feel is inappropriate. The SonicWALL also functions as a filter to block inappropriate spam such as “Male Enhancement” and “Lonely, Want to Talk?” emails. Parents can also block specific websites such as myspace.com.\n\nAdditional features available include blocking internet browsing during certain hours of viewing for children with homework, etc.\n\nBusiness Owners can benefit from the use of a SonicWALL to also help cut down on unnecessary Internet Browsing, Instant Messaging and lost work productivity due to browsing, streaming music, lowering network congestion and traffic. Some of the optional SonicWALL services available includes customizable reporting of internet activity use of every computer user in our office.\n\nHow Do I Know If a SonicWALL is Right For Me?\n\nIf computer users in your home or office continually subject you or themselves to viruses and hundreds of porn related email spam.\n\nIf you have children that are using the internet and want parental control.\n\nIf you have a wireless router (i.e. Linksys, D-Link, Netgear)\n\nIf you consistently lose your wireless connection due to a poor signal (the traditional routers and range expanders do not carry the same signal strength as the SonicWALL Routers do.)\n\nIf you experience slow network response times due to unproductive network traffic.\n\nAdditional product information is available by contacting Orange County Computer® at (949) 699-6619 or email news@orangecountycomputer.com\n\nOrange County Computer® also offers special financing options through Microsoft’s SmartPay Program. IT projects over $3000 are eligible for financing regardless of the type of job or product purchased.
