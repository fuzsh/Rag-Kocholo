Trends force changes in the way you do business. A changing IT landscape = security challenges = RISK Trends Security Challenges Cloud BYOD Virtualization & new technologies Patchwork of vendor solutions => disjointed & siloed Explosive data growth $ Limited budget and expertise Time & complexity of management & reporting Insufficient visibility and counter measures Compliance Advanced persistent threats, breaches, attacks, malware\n\n10.

Does Dell Have an Answer and Why Dell? - Of course because Dell’s in the problem solving business. Let’s talk about why Dell for IT security. Dell Solutions Tour Dell Solutions Tour\n\n20. Dell belief: there is a better way Silos and layers add stress to your resources • Difficult to get to work together • Limited security resources Individual job done well in silos • Solutions often don’t work together • Solutions don’t work across the business The problem: Today, layers and silos get the security job done but often have gaps = business risk\n\n21. Our POV: Connected Security for a connected world Connected Security is security that… • Shares and applies intelligence • Works with the business, end- to- end • Maintains flexibility and open architecture • Enables broad contextual awareness with dynamic control Security to enable business while also meeting the needs of security Protect information everywhere Effective Work with the business Efficient\n\n22. Firstly: Dell security and business solutions are recognized in the Gartner Magic Quadrants 2011 to 2013 • Managed Security Service Providers • Unified Threat Management • User Administration and Provisioning • Identity and Access Governance • Enterprise Network Firewalls • Secure Email Gateways • Enterprise Backup/Recovery Software Challengers Niche Players Visionaries Leaders Security Solutions • Mobile Data Protection • E- Class SRA SSL VPN\n\n23.

Securing & Monitoring Data and Access KACE DDP|E SonicWALL Applications Data SecureWorks\n\n26. Connected Security: Competitive landscape What is our unique positioning? Security niche providers IT solution providers They can only address part of the problem. You’re left with no choice but to manage an increased number of vendors’ solutions. This leads to a more complex, expensive and fragmented IT and security environment and presents an intolerable level of risk. They want to impose a large, complex, rigid and expensive platform on you. They lack Dell’s breadth, requiring integration of multiple solutions from multiple vendors. This means more customization and coding– -all at a greater expense to you. Dell is the only provider that can protect the entire IT landscape, enabling both visibility and security from the inside- out, as well as the outside- in. This simpler, more unified approach scales at your pace by delivering flexible and modular solutions. Limited Expensive & Inflexible Sweet Spot: Comprehensive & Flexible\n\n28. Gartner defines the unified threat management (UTM) market as multifunction network security products used by small or midsize businesses (SMBs). Typically, midsize businesses have 100 to 1,000 employees, with revenue ranging from $50 million to $1 billion. Gartner recognizes Dell as a Leader in network security.
