Terms were not disclosed for the acquisition, which Dell said it expects to close in its second fiscal quarter.\n\nThe acquisition will be used by Dell to expand its enterprise security portfolio, adding more than 130 registered and pending patents. SonicWall has 300,000 customers in 50 countries. All 950 employees of the company, which is based in San Jose, California, will join Dell, which also pledged to keep investing in SonicWall’s security products.Dell already has an extensive security portfolio, called Dell SecureWorks. Under that flag the company offers firewalls, security monitoring and threat intelligence services, among other things, to organizations of all sizes.\n\nSonicWall also has a channel program with 15,000 resellers. Dell plans to integrate that program with its own PartnerDirect program. Resellers from both parties will be able to sell Dell’s and SonicWall’s security portfolio when the deal is closed."
