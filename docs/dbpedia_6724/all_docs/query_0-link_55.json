        "text": "Computer maker Dell said overnight it has agreed to buy network and data security provider SonicWALL for an undisclosed sum.\n\nTexas-based Dell said that SonicWALL's line-up of firewalls complements its security solutions portfolio and broadens its product line-up.\n\nSonicWALL has more than 130 patents, registered and pending, and develops its own security products.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers use SonicWALL products, including firewalls and secure remote access, along with email security, backup and recovery, Dell said.\n\nDell has acquired some 18 companies in the software, storage, networking and security areas in recent years as it tries to move from a hardware vendor to a one-stop-shop for all IT services including software, security and consulting.\n\nIt already owns SecureWorks which provides data encryption and cloud security, and KACE which provides vulnerability and patch management.\n\nThe company's shopping spree also saw it buy AppSure, a provider of backup and replication software, only last month.\n\nThe strategy is paying dividends for the world's No.3 PC maker as demand for traditional PCs shift towards mobility.\n\nJohn Swainson, president of the recently created Dell software group, said the company was \"building a strategic software portfolio to address the needs of our customers with key assets in fast-growing and highly profitable IT security solutions business.\"\n\nSonicWALL was founded in 1991 and is based in San Jose, California. Its 950 workers are expected to join Dell, the company said.\n\nThe deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions, was approved by the boards of both companies. It's expected to close in the second quarter of Dell's fiscal year 2013.\n\nLoading\n\nAP Digital with Lia Timson\n\nFollow IT Pro on Twitter"
