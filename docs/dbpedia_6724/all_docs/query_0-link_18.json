The move is the latest in a series of deals designed to beef up the company's presence in IT software and hardware, further reducing its reliance on the increasingly commoditized PC segment.\n\nDell notes that SonicWall has more than 130 registered and pending patents, and more than 300,000 customers.\n\nSonicWall, founded in 1991 and based in San Jose, was acquired in 2010 by the buyout firm Thoma Bravo and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan for $717 million.\n\nTerms of Dell's acquisition of the company were not disclosed, but it would be fair to guess that they likely paid more than Thoma Bravo, given the quick flip...don't you think?\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the fiscal second quarter ending July.\n\nDell this morning is up 4 cents, to $17."
