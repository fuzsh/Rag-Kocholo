        "text": "I'm working with a company that has a need for a backup/failover internet connection and I'm looking into options.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with Sonicwall or Cradlepoint when it comes to 4G, mainly in the areas of reliability and speed?\n\nThey currently have a Comcast cable modem bridged to a Cisco ASA (static IP). They are too far from the Verizon CO so DSL isn't an option [not 100% true, but I don't consider 768/128Kbps an option). Two possibilities I am going between are:\n\n1) Add a Cradlepoint Adapter with a modem (CBA750B-LPE-VZ). Connect the Cradlepoint modem to the ASA and do failover with IP SLA.\n\n-OR-\n\n2) Replace the Cisco ASA entirely with a Sonicwall TZ215 router that supports 4G modems (USB) and can also do load balancing.\n\nThe Sonicwall setup was suggested by someone else, but I don't really think I'd want to do load balancing when one of the connections is metered - even if I could adjust the usage ratio between the two. The main connection has been very solid so I don't think the failover would get a ton of use, but it's a medical facility so the need is there.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\n\nWe used the Cradlepoint units for emergency access for remote offices, providing one of AT&T, Verizon, or Clearwire modems depending on the site and how long they were going to need access. A few days for a cut line or something like that would be Verizon, or AT&T depending on who had better signal in the area, we used Clearwire at a few sites that needed 2-3 months of coverage when they opened an office without contacting IT and failed to realize that telcos can take 60-90 days routinely after an order is completed to provide service. At one site Clear wasn't available and they needed an extended setup, we ended up buying a large pooled account and only attaching the one device, very very expensive way of providing bandwidth but it worked.\n\nI have one client using a TZ215 with the 4G adapter. Their primary internet is slow and flaky but works well enough generally. I have the 4G adapter setup as failover for them. I don't bother with any load balancing, but I did setup specific routes for their one business application to use the 4G card by default. They use it to upload information from field devices. The extra upload/dowload bandwidth that the 4G gives worked really nicely for that.\n\nI don't know if all carriers do this, but we were able to get a static IP for our 4G adapter for a little extra a month. I think it was only like $5 extra.\n\nI work with Sonicwalls all the time and generally like them. But they do have their peculiarities. They try to do a lot of extra stuff that can sometimes get in your way.\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=28067975#p28067975:3co1o9ae said:\n\nGohanIYIan[/url]\":3co1o9ae]I've been somewhat disappointed with the failover on my Sonicwall (or I'm disappointed in my cable provider). The failover monitoring is super bare bones. There's a host & a port and optionally an alternate host & port. I would love to have a tunable timeout option so a WAN link could switch to failed when it's technically still up but running extremely slow. This is only a TZ100 so it's possible the higher end models have more extensive options.\n\nThat's something not even high end Cisco or Checkpoint units can do, and frankly I'm not sure how you'd do it in a robust way (ICMP echo is often de-prioritized, bandwidth can be filled without their being any problems with a connection, etc)\n\nThanks for all the great input.\n\nI have set up Cisco IP SLA failover before at another client and tested it but it was always for basic web browsing etc.\n\nThis company pretty much does everything over Citrix, they log onto a website that starts up their Citrix Receiver, log in and all the hosted Office apps are there. It's their lifeblood basically. There is a short delay when it switches to another connection with with IP SLA (anyone know how long?) - would that short delay kick them out of their session?\n\nThe Sonicwall can do full time load balancing but I don't know if that provides an advantage over the ASA in that regard or not.\n\nI'd really like to stick with the Cisco ASA/Cradlepoint route but the Sonicwall option is from their parent company's managed IT services provider, who shockingly enough appears also be a Sonicwall reseller. It's probably just \"easier\" for them to stick with them than to let an in-house person do it. The other downside is that it would most likely be fully managed by them (no touchy) so even though I live 5 minutes away, they'd still have to wait for tech support to clock in.\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=28068065#p28068065:7ch9bgbf said:\n\nafidel[/url]\":7ch9bgbf]\n\n[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=28067975#p28067975:7ch9bgbf said:\n\nGohanIYIan[/url]\":7ch9bgbf]I've been somewhat disappointed with the failover on my Sonicwall (or I'm disappointed in my cable provider).

Connect to the specified host on the specified port, then wait for it to send a FIN. Presumably there's a timeout setting or two involved but they aren't user-editable."
