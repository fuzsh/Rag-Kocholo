        "text": "Computer maker Dell has signed a definitive agreement to acquire internet security solutions provider SonicWALL, Inc, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nSonicWALL’s Next-Generation Firewalls and Unified Threat Management (UTM) Firewalls complement Dell’s security solutions portfolio, enabling it to offer customers a broader range of enterprise offerings, Dell said.\n\nSonicWALL expands Dell’s security portfolio, which includes cloud security solutions, data encryption solutions, and vulnerability and patch management.\n\n“We are building a strategic software portfolio to address the needs of our customers with key assets in the fast-growing and highly profitable IT security solutions business,” said John Swainson, president, Dell Software Group. “Our customers see security as a key IT concern for the foreseeable future.”\n\n“SonicWALL gives Dell access to unique intellectual property resources and technology that position us well in fast-growing parts of the software security business.”\n\nSonicWALL also has a channel programme that includes 15,000 resellers providing global coverage. Dell plans to take the best of the SonicWALL channel programmes and combine them with Dell’s PartnerDirect programme to bring the best to channel members. Likewise, Dell’s existing PartnerDirect members will be able to sell SonicWALL solutions to meet their customers’ IT security needs.\n\nSonicWALL, founded in 1991, is headquartered in San José, California, and serves customers in 50 countries worldwide. The company employs about 950 people who will join the Dell team under the deal.\n\nThe acquisition is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of Dell’s FY13.\n\n“This transaction aligns well with Dell’s mid-market design focus and allows us to accelerate growth of our flagship SuperMassive Next-Generation Firewall solutions with large enterprise customers,” said Matt Medeiros, president and CEO, SonicWALL.\n\n“Dell’s phenomenal breadth and reach into small and mid-size companies provides a significant opportunity to expand our customer base.”"
