        "text": "I lead the Program Management group at Smashing Ideas, a digital agency in Seattle. We use Jira and Confluence extensively for both client and internal projects and communications. I've been a Jira fan since 2010, followed by Confluence in 2012.\n\nOutside of work, I can be found hanging out in West Seattle with my family and doing everything I can to raise awareness and funding for breast cancer programs.\n\nI've also been your Seattle Atlassian user group (AUG) leader since 2014 :)\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI'm Mikael and I am a principal applications specialist at FUJIFILM SonoSite located in Bothell where I am the admin for Bitbucket, Confluence and Jira. We also have a subsidiary in Canada that is using Fisheye that I am the admin for. I am also one of the 130+ champions that you can find on this community.\n\nOutside of work you will find me in Lake Stevens with my family at the local brewery.\n\nHello Seattle AUG!\n\nMy name is Nicholette and I am a Sr. Program Manager projekt202, a software design and development consultancy. We use Confluence, Jira, Slack, and Jira Service Desk. I suppose you could call me a Confluence fangirl. I LOVE IT!\n\nI am your Seattle AUG co-leader, next to the fearless and fierce (yet quite friendly) Lisa Dawson.\n\nOutside of work, you will find me in my local CrossFit gym with my Boston Terrier, Piglet, by my side. When the rain stops and the sun comes out, I'm in the mountains.\n\nHello!\n\nMy name is Samantha. Prior to Lisa being the AUG-lead (which I am forever grateful to her picking up the mantel-and now Nicholette too!), I assisted the previous leader for a while as AUG Lead helper.\n\nI have been using JIRA and Confluence since 2013. I first helped stand up an instance with a couple of co-workers from my Seattle team at Dell-SonicWALL. It was love at first site/use.\n\nThese days I am a contracting Scrum Master trying to teach the masses about how great JIRA and Confluence are and admin'ing on the side. :)\n\nIn my spare time I am a Scifi book fan and run a book club with a lot of nerdy fun people. I also spend as much time as I can with my cat Boris in my lap.\n\nThank you,\n\nSamantha\n\nHello All,\n\nMy name is Sreedevi and I work with TechMahindra in Redmond, USA. As a Technical PM, I have been using JIRA for over 5 years now and am loving the tool and learning every single day.\n\nSince I work with a team that use multiple tools for reporting, it is challenging to convince them to use JIRA and I spent most of the time, advocating the perks of the tool and getting team members to visually represent their deliverable s in Jira.\n\nIn my free time, I like to read (fiction/non-fiction/self-help) and swim.\n\nHi Seattlites!\n\nMy name is Jonathan and I'm a Systems and Projects Analyst with MCG Health. We are in the process of moving most of our documentation into Confluence and already use Jira quite extensively. I've been creating custom workflows, setting up automation and building templates since 2018. I love the new confluence editing experience and can't wait to start converting everything to it!\n\nOutside of work, you're likely to find me at my local coffee shop in Belltown or at trivia night at the pub.\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nI just started w/ Artemis Software which builds Apps. We work in Confluence, Jira core, & Jira support desk. I have just started here and am very new to all of the products of Atlassian. I work from home in Bremerton but Aretimis is based in Denver so I am looking for some local support.\n\nMy fun is mostly geeky things; tabletop games, reading/writing urban fantasy, & crafting! always looking for new experiences and friends."
