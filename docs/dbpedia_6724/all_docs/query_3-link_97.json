        "text": "Joining Merlin’s comment: what part of the management is the problem / too difficult / driving you mad / …?\n\nIf that question is not cleared, you are in big danger, that you might have the same problem(s) with the next firewall solution you install as well.\n\nWhile some people just favorize for the solution they are using and like (I like/recommend WatchGuard, by the way…), I don’t think this is a question of “what product”.\n\nSetting up a firewall, maintaining it and supporting it, requires a pretty special skill set and talent. If one doesn’t have it…possibly he will find a solution that is ‘simple enough’, but than he won’t have any idea, what that solution is actually doing with his traffic.\n\nWhen you are looking at the simplest firewall, than having NO firewall at all, is the simplest solution. But I don’t believe, this is what you want?\n\nI also always warn people, they should try out different firewall solutions. Each has a slightly different management approach. Depending on the type of admin you are, you may get big friend with one solution and be deeply frustrated by another one. Could be, that this is the case with SonicWall and you - possibly it’s not the management approach that fits you. It’s like with a pair of shoes. Some look nice and fit very well, while others may cause you blisters and drive you crazy. You need to try them on, to find out how they will fit. And even than there is no guarantee, that you won’t get some blisters in the first weeks of wearing them. Not much different with firewalls.\n\nSo listing brands and vendors doesn’t make real sense. It’s just like asking people what kind of ice cream they like. That doesn’t mean, you will also like the same as the majority. If you want to see, how ‘effective’ firewalls were in the latest independent tests, you can have a look at the latest NSS Labs report. But even that is more about how many miles you may walk in these shoes before they fall apart and nothing about the blisters you might get wearing them.\n\nLook at NSS Labs and Gartner as lists of vendors, that you should have a look at. Check out what you can get close to you (including local support!!!) and what fits into your budget. Than ash the chosen resellers from your area for some demo. Face them with the problems you have and let them show how their solution solves them. That should pretty fast give you a feeling about the fit of the product management and your management habits/preferences/likes/dislikes.\n\nOnce you have seen al the demo’s, pick one or two favorites and request an appliance you can play with for a couple of days/weeks. Set up a test network and throw some real traffic at the box to see, how it behaves when you turn on all the security services you plan to purchase.\n\nThere is no other way to really select the RIGHT product for YOU.\n\nI left SonicWALL for WatchGuard about ten years ago and I am SO GLAD that I did. It took a while to get used to the WatchGuard setup, but I think I would rather be hit in the face with a baseball than have to deal with SonicWALL again. I have also used Fortinet and MUCH prefer WatchGuard.\n\nOne huge thing I like is the ability to block executable file downloads in FTP/HTTP/HTTPS traffic. For example, try to download a random printer driver EXE file such as https://download.brother.com/welcome/dlf004709/DCP-330C-inst-win7-A2.EXE\n\nIf I try to download that file, simulating a random web site with a drive-by malicious file or someone who got suckered by an email and tries to download a payload, that download gets blocked. My custom Deny message has a method for authorized users to bypass the block if the file is needed.\n\nAnother thing I like is the free management suite that comes with all WatchGuard firewalls. With WatchGuard System Manager and its included Policy Manger and Firebox System Monitor, I can create configs ahead of time and go live with them as needed. If it’s a massive screw-up, I can restore the previous config in a few seconds. FSM has Traffic Monitor in it that shows live firewall traffic so I can see what is denied, or if I choose, what is allowed as well. It also has a free download of WatchGuard Dimension logging server that one can install in a VM.\n\nGregg"
