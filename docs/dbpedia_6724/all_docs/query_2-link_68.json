It really does feel like the GUI version of a CLI, but at least with a CLI you can paste in the batch commands you want.

But then they got bought, chewed up and spit out by Dell.\n\n100% THIS! Dell ruins small & mid-sized solutions. I bought into the Sonicwall ecosystem in a major way, right about the time they got sucked in by Dell. Ditto the KACE KBOX and EqualLogic SANs. (Dell was on a buying spree around 2005-2009)\n\nAll 3 products were great up-and-coming solutions for small and mid-sized businesses with easy configuration & management, a good feature-set, and great performance for the price.\n\nIn the first year of ownership all seemed to prosper under Dell - expanding their product offerings and accelerating development. Then the Dell-specific software hooks started getting inserted. Next, the products began being twisted into specific niches - either around other Dell products or into areas that Dell figured they \"needed\" to be. ALL of the products' development and support either stalled out or became poor. A terrible shame!\n\nSonicWall could've rivaled Meraki or Aruba if development had continued. They had next-gen firewall features before most others, with easier administration and easy VPN clients than the major name-brands at the time.\n\nKBOX as an all-in-one IT support solution (licensing/asset-tracking, deployment, automation, helpdesk, etc) that outclassed products like ManageEngine, Spiceworks, Zoho, LANSweeper, PDQ, and Ninite - then stalled and fell behind most of them around 5 years ago.\n\nAnd EqualLogic could have gone toe-to-toe with Nimble or Pure if they'd evolved forward into the SSD space instead of being relegated to a Dell backwater (to avoid cannibalizing sales of Dell's other - less good - SAN solutions).\n\nUpvote\n\n17 (18 / -1)\n\nFeb 1, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#18\n\nFirst ZyXEL, now SonicWall.

They went downhill over time, as the dev teams seemed to get starved out and new releases were just stacking crap on top of crap; rather than cleaning things up, fixing bugs and incompatibilities, and improving the system (as earlier releases seemed to do).\n\nAnd it sounds like you're an experienced Cisco ios user? The point of the SonicWall (at least, originally), was never to outclass a heavy-duty Cisco solution or be targeted at security experts. It was there for small to midsized businesses who didn't have much IT staff, who didn't have a ton of network-engineering experience. It allowed those businesses to easily set up something that could do limited NAT & forwarding, some Layer 7 content filtering, a few site-to-site VPNs if necessary, and easily enable some endpoint VPN clients (or an SSL-VPN portal that was... meh...).\n\nSolutions like that are *never* going to be as comprehensive as a CLI-driven enterprise product with ultimate controllability. But those products take time to learn and expertise to manage properly. In Business, expertise costs money and time is a finite resource you can never regain. A lot of businesses cannot afford to dedicate a body to network engineering and need a handful of jack-of-all-trades sys admins to cover a wide variety of work that shifts on a daily basis. Giving those kinds of folks something they can pop into once every few months, easily grok via a GUI, make a few small tweaks, and then let it run \"hands off\" is valuable. ...And, in the early days, the SonicWall provided that. I just wish Dell hadn't slowly rotted them out.\n\nUpvote\n\n6 (9 / -3)\n\nFeb 1, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#20\n\nDan - The headline is incorrect. SMA 100 Series are for SSL VPN and remote access, they're *not* firewalls. Firewalls are unaffected by this, nor the completely separate SMA 1000 series (different product line).\n\nUpvote\n\n16 (16 / 0)\n\nFeb 1, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#21\n\nWith SolarWinds and now this, are these proprietary security products? Or are they a mix of proprietary and open-source?\n\nThere was a time I dabbled in some network engineering and learned about some of the open-source solutions like pfSense and iptables and the like. Frankly, I was rubbish at them, but all the serious network security folks were using open source or Cisco products.\n\nHas this changed?

It will crush any \"router\" without even trying and it is based on Hardened BSD so fairly secure too (automatic updates are there and for remote access you have wireguard plugin so you are exposing a minimal amount of hardened code to the outside).\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (1 / -1)\n\nFeb 2, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#27\n\n15 years ago I was running an openBSD firewall router with my cable modem at the time.

I was using a home Atom box (I think maybe a D550?) to firewall gigabit Internet for about five years, and it worked beautifully. Until it suddenly failed completely, anyway, which I gather is a thing that happened a lot with some generations of Atom. They just ... failed after four or five years, and that bit me too.\n\nAt the time, Atoms had weak floating point, but strong integer performance and a ton of bandwidth, so they ran iptables and routing code really fast. That was a sweet little firewall, and could comfortably push a gigabit both ways. I think it cost about $500 at the time(2010ish) but that was in a 1U rackmount case with an extra two-port NIC on a riser cable.

Perhaps not as good as a Linux distro with auto updates, but the complete lack of effort to have content filtering, anti-malware, and parental controls with a high WAF has been priceless to me.\n\nEx. I just checked and the most current firmware date for my AC66-B1 is 2/1/21, pretty good =)\n\nPrevious release was 1/18/21 so it's more than just a fluke.\n\nThis is totally legit. A good router, how rare!!!\n\nHowever, I'd also like to throw out that OP should consider OPNsense. It's like pfSense, but less sucky!\n\npfSense works just fine for me. I had tried OPNSense and it was kind of buggy and it seemed easier to just use pfSense than to try to resolve the issues I was having with OPNSense.\n\nI know people that are running both and I'd say that either one is a good choice. Try them and see which you like better.\n\nI found pfSense to be easy to install and setup. I really like pfBlockerNG too, and I use other plugins to track my data usage, interface with my APC UPS, run arpwatch and darkstat, etc.\n\nI was using a Mikrotik router before this and pfSense does everything that RouterOS did for me and then a lot more.\n\nA Mikrotik router or Ubiquiti EdgeRouter are already a big improvement over the consumer routers that many people get at their local big box store. I think that pfSense or OPNSense are better in some ways, but something like a Mikrotik hAP ac2 or an EdgeRouter-X sure are excellent and inexpensive devices.\n\nNetgate's pfSense appliances are also a pretty good value, and might be better for people that don't want to fiddle around with building hardware to run their firewall on.\n\nUpvote\n\n1 (1 / 0)\n\nFeb 2, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#35\n\n15 years ago I was running an openBSD firewall router with my cable modem at the time.

If it's not listening on any external ports, and you're administering it via SSH on the internal interface, by the time anyone can get in to modify it, your network is thoroughly compromised anyway.\n\nOr, of course, there's a zero-day in the Linux networking stack. But if that bites you, it will also bite hundreds of millions of juicier targets, so you might have time to get patched before getting owned. Maybe.\n\nYou can use an old desktop in that role, or you can choose from quite a number of small x86 boxes with a fairly fast CPU and multiple network ports, often in a NUC-like form factor. I was using a home Atom box (I think maybe a D550?) to firewall gigabit Internet for about five years, and it worked beautifully. Until it suddenly failed completely, anyway, which I gather is a thing that happened a lot with some generations of Atom. They just ... failed after four or five years, and that bit me too.\n\nAt the time, Atoms had weak floating point, but strong integer performance and a ton of bandwidth, so they ran iptables and routing code really fast. That was a sweet little firewall, and could comfortably push a gigabit both ways. I think it cost about $500 at the time(2010ish) but that was in a 1U rackmount case with an extra two-port NIC on a riser cable. You can get much nicer all-in-one units now, for a fair bit less.\n\nThe PC Engines APU2 is also worth looking into. They're inexpensive and quite reliable. With Linux, OpenBSD, pfSense, or OPNSense installed they make very good firewalls for a lot of home and small business uses.\n\nUpvote\n\n1 (1 / 0)\n\nFeb 2, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#36\n\nWe have been a happy sonicwall customer for some time now. Being a smaller site we needed something reliable and at a good cost and it seems to fit the bill. We needed devices that could handle routing, intrusion detection along with large a large set of ACLs between all our vlans and found most similar priced firewall solutions (smooth wall, etc) could not handle more than 15-20 vlan/zone designations without major performance impacts. Our Nsa series device easily handles 50+ vlans all with IDP and advanced routing and ACLs without an issue.\n\nI have always thought their support was quite good, and they are always willing to help out with configuration and design related queries and you can usually speak to someone in under 30minutes...\n\nAs someone else pointed out, this appears to not be an issue with their firewall line, so maybe the article title is a bit misleading...\n\nThere was a pretty big vuln on their firewall VPN as well a few months back.\n\nI heard they were good under Dell then when their own way and got bad again. I really dislike using their support. They will help but I can't do the language barrier. Not sure who they've subcontracted out their call center to. East Asia is my guess but they're not super quick and again; broken english is just too hard to understand over the phone so it's constant 'huh' and 'please say again'.\n\nBring support back to the states and I think it'd get better. Then again their gateway AV and stuff is pretty bad so whatever. They are fairly easy to manage though and I heard from my Boss that SonicOS 7x is much better than 6.5. I'm not a network engineer so I got stuck managing these things and hate managing network stuff so that's probably some of my saltiness.\n\nMy impression of Dell's ownership of Sonicwall was that they rapidly iterated hardware and dropped support for models as soon as one year after release, and that they had an overwhelmed support crew that wasn't even as familiar with the model line as I was.\n\nThat's not terribly unexpected in the enterprise space, of course. But SonicWall was an upstart that was disrupting traditional models of firewall hardware with a combination of unique hardware and software, and even if their interface wasn't the best in the market, it was a lot of firewall for almost nothing. Once you had to pay thousands of dollars a year for basic features like VPNs, all of that ancient design became a bit of a farce.\n\n(Meraki was mentioned earlier -- before they were bought out by Cisco and ruined, they were the same. Nothing great is suffered to live long.)\n\nUpvote\n\n1 (1 / 0)\n\nFeb 2, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#37\n\nSomeone's pulling out the big guns to get access these days. That's a lot of zero days in a very short period of time.\n\nA point of minor interest is that some security experts actually trace the Solarwinds hack to the FireEye breach. But FireEye has already stated that the red team toolkit that was exfiltrated did not have any zero-day hacks included.\n\nThat doesn't prove anything, so I won't speculate. It got my attention all the same.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nFeb 2, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#38\n\nThere was another zero-day being exploited just weeks ago. I was already not a fan of SonicWall's support, but this absolutely seals the deal on never again, for a company whose entire reputation lives and dies on security.\n\nI talked my org into SMA, although we went with the 1000-series, not 100. One of the sellers for us was to be able to manage multiple appliances from a central location/server. And the management server can also apportion licenses between appliances. With Pulse Secure, for example, you have to load the licenses into each appliance, and there the licenses stay. If you want your (again, for example) 200 VPN users to be able to access either appliance, you have to buy 400 licenses.\n\nBut, yeah, we've noticed the support shortcomings, too. Slow, to say the least. We've established a relationship with a consultant that helped us implement it, and that has been awesome.\n\nUpvote\n\n1 (1 / 0)\n\nFeb 2, 2021\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#39\n\nPlease explain what Dell did to degrade quality of SonicWall, if you know?\n\nI understood they were a wholly owned subsidiary and they would operate separately, like Secure Works. I might have old data but I use these products and have been fat and happy as the CTO. I deal with government compliance, security, a small budget and an active workforce that can't allow productivity impacts due to security issues.\n\nI applaud SonicWall for being responsive. I am saddened to read that these issues are getting closer to my type/brand of technology stack. Time to budget for some additional redundancy for the VPN capabilities.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)"
