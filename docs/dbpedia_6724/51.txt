When Dell sold SonicWall and other software assets to Francisco Partners in June, ChannelE2E noted that Francisco Partners also owned WatchGuard -- a key SonicWall rival. It begged the question: Might the private equity parent ultimately merge SonicWall and WatchGuard?

Fast forward to present day, and some pundits worry that Francisco Partners' ownership of both SonicWall and WatchGuard could trigger conflicts of interest. As Bloomberg notes:

Same Parent, Similar M&amp;A Targets?

But here's where the situation gets extra interesting. Let's assume a super-hot startup called Acme Co. emerges in the security market. What if both SonicWall and WatchGuard want to bid to buy Acme?

During that scenario, Bloomberg wonders:

SonicWall Partners

Those are important questions -- though they are bridges that Francisco partners doesn't need to cross right now. Instead, the far bigger priority -- at least for channel partners: SonicWall's new owners need to prove the company remains committed to its partner ecosystem. We'll be watching for updates on that front in the days and weeks ahead.
