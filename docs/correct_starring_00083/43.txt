Talk of a direct follow-up to 1984’s Ghostbusters – which starred Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and the late Harold Ramis as the titular ghost-catchers – and 1989’s Ghostbusters II has persisted for some time, with Aykroyd giving fans a hopeful update as recently as November.

A sequel set in the same universe as the two original movies was then confirmed in January, with Jason Reitman hired to direct and co-write the new movie that is being called Ghostbusters 2020.

Aykroyd was originally rumoured to be starring in the sequel but the actor has now confirmed his involvement.

“It’ll be all or most of the original people. And then young stars […] It’s gonna be great.

“I’m so excited about it, and it’s just wonderful to be able to [go] back and revisit that. I don’t do the pictures anymore much, and I’m in that one.”
