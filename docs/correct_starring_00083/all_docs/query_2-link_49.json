        "text": "GHOSTBUSTERS became a cult classic after its release in 1984.\n\nThrough its hilarious script and use of expensive special effects, it spawned a billion-dollar franchise complete with board games, comic books, and haunted attractions.\n\nThis week it was reported some of the original cast will make a big return for a new sequel.\n\nSigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray are all set to make a cameo in the film, which is said to be set in London.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"Studio bosses are taking a classic franchise, setting it in a new location but keeping the magic of the original. It’s going to be brilliant.”\n\nWith production due to begin in March, we take a look at where the main cast has ended up since appearing in the film.\n\nBill Murray\n\nGhostbusters was Bill Murray's first main role in a big-budget blockbuster.\n\nThe 72-year-old took the part of Peter Venkman in a bid to raise funds for his own project The Razor's Edge - which ended up being a flop.\n\nStraight after the film was shown in 1984, Bill took a break from acting - frustrated that his own project had tanked.\n\nBut he remerged on the Hollywood scene to star in Groundhog Day, Mad Dog and Glory, Larger Than Life, and The Man Who Knew Too Little.\n\nPrior to Ghostbusters he married Margaret Kelly in 1981 and they had two sons, Homer and Luke.\n\nBut in 1996 the pair divorced over Bill's affair with Jennifer Butler - who he married a year later.\n\nThe couple had four sons together - Caleb, Jackson, Cooper, and Lincoln - but divorced in 2008.\n\nThanks to his extensive movie work, Bill is thought to be worth £135million according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nHe's scooped a Golden Globe award, two Emmys and a BAFTA for his work.\n\nHe has gained a reputation for his mood swings and has been involved in a number of controversies and feuds throughout his illustrious career.\n\nHe's been said to have clashed with a number of people he's worked with including Scarlett Johansson, Anjelica Huston, and his Charlie's Angels co-star Lucy Liu.\n\nLucy, 54, is said to have thrown punches at Bill after he enraged her by saying she couldn't act, among other things.\n\nThe actress said in an interview that the language he used was \"inexcusable\" and she does not regret standing up for herself.\n\nIn April 2022, producers had to halt filming of Being Mortal when Bill was accused of inappropriate behaviour after he allegedly straddled a female production assistant and kissed her on the lips.\n\nHe said the incident was a joke, but the woman, believed to be much younger than him, said it was sexually motivated and ended up receiving a $100,000 compensation from him.\n\nShortly after the report, Geena Davis alleged in her memoir that she had been harassed and yelled at by Bill during the filming of Quick Change, and that he once tried to pull down the strap of her dress.\n\nSigourney Weaver\n\nSigourney, 73, had already started making a name for herself as a lead actress thanks to roles in Alien and The Year of Living Dangerously.\n\nBut it was her role as Dana Barrett in Ghostbusters which brought her widespread critical acclaim.\n\nShe went on to star in Gorillas in the Mist and Working Girl, noted as her two most memorable performances which secured her two Golden Globes.\n\nSigourney took a brief break from acting in 1990 to have her daughter and returned with the third instalment of the Alien franchise.\n\nShe went on to win a BAFTA for her role in The Ice Storm and Jenny Carver.\n\nShe also starred in Avatar and is returning for the film's sequel and third instalment.\n\nSigourney has been married to director Jim Simpson since 1984 and the couple share daughter Charlotte.\n\nSince appearing in Gorillas in the Mist she has supported the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund and is currently the charity's honorary chairwoman.\n\nIn 2009 she controversially signed a petition calling for Roman Polanski's release after he was arrested in Switzerland on a 1979 charge of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.\n\nShe returned for Ghostbusters: Afterlife and starred in Stephen Spielberg's The Good House.\n\nLast year she said sexism in the movie industry prevented her from being able to direct a movie.\n\nDan Aykroyd\n\nDan Aykroyd, 70, was the brains behind the concept for Ghostbusters and starred in it as Ray Stantz.\n\nHe had originally envisioned it as a film in space starring him and pal John Belushi but this was canned when Belushi died.\n\nThe Canadian actor, who is a self-described spititualist, went on to star in Spies Like Us, Dragnet and Driving Miss Daisy.\n\nHe won an Emmy in 1977 for his work on Saturday Night Live and was nominated for an Oscar in 1990 - making him the second SNL cast member to be up for the honour, after Joan Cusack.\n\nThroughout the 90s his film work widely flopped and was dismissed by critics.\n\nIn 2009 he wrote the Ghostbusters video game, and he is an executive producer on Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\n\nOutside of film he owns Crystal Head Vodka, and started House of Blues, a chain of live music concert halls and restaurants, to promote blues music and folk art.\n\nHe had a short-lived engagement to Star Wars legend Carrie Fisher before marrying Donna Dixon, with whom he has three children including singer Vera Sola.\n\nThe couple announced their separation last year in April.\n\nHe has spoken out against offensive comedy and is in favour of people cancelling comedians who cause offence.\n\nHarold Ramis\n\nHarold Ramis co-wrote the screenplay for Ghostbusters with Dan and starred as Egon Spengler.\n\nLike Dan, he was also a regular contributor on Saturday Night Live and also appeared on the sketch comedy series SCTV.\n\nPrior to Ghostbusters he spent a few years dabbling in TV, before pursuing a career in film.\n\nHarold made his directorial debut with Caddyshack which was a commercial success in 1980.\n\nAfter Ghostbusters he rarely acted, opting to stay behind the camera; he directed Groundhog Day.\n\nWhile he was pals with Bill Murray, they had the occasional heated dispute; on one occasion Harold is said to have thrown Bill against a wall after grabbing him by the collar.\n\nBy 2005 he was able to charge a directing fee of £3.8million.\n\nSadly, in 2010 Harold contracted an infection that resulted in complications from autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis and lost the ability to walk.\n\nHe re-learned but in 2011 suffered a relapse of the disease.\n\nOn February 24, 2014, Harold passed away aged 69, leaving behind two sons and a daughter from two marriages.\n\nRick Moranis\n\nGhostbusters launched Rick Moranis' career and saw him land leading roles in Little Shop of Horrors, Spaceballs and The Flintstones.\n\nHe stepped back from his career after his wife of five years, Anne Belsky, died from cancer in 1991, at the age of 34. Six years later he took time out to raise their two children.\n\nRick, 69, didn't appear in another film until 23 years later when he signed up for a sequel to Honey I shrunk the Kids, called Shrunk.\n\nDuring his hiatus from screen, he occasionally provided voice-overs including for Disney's Brother Bear.\n\nIn October 2020, Rick was assaulted in New York City and suffered minor injuries to his head, back, and hip.\n\nAnnie Potts\n\nAnnie, 70, was already on her way to being a fixture in Hollywood when she landed the role of Janine Melnitz in Ghostbusters.\n\nShe went on to star in Pretty in Pink and voiced Bo Peep in Toy Story as well as Toy Story 2 and 4.\n\nAnnie moved into TV and held leading roles in Designing Women, Dangerous Minds, and Any Day Now.\n\nShe's been nominated for an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a SAG award.\n\nThe actress, 69, is currently appearing in Young Sheldon as Connie Tucker - Sheldon's Meemaw.\n\nShe has been married three times and has three grown-up sons.\n\nWilliam Atherton\n\nPrior to appearing in Ghostbusters, William, 75, had starred in Steven Spielberg's debut film The Sugarland Express.\n\nHis role in the cult classic was Walter Peck, who critics dubbed the \"real villain of the film\" and was hated so much that William was harassed in the street.\n\nHe went on to play Richard Thornberg in Die Hard and its sequel, as well as appearing in other blockbusters and TV series including Desperate Housewives, Law & Order, and Murder, She Wrote.\n\nWilliam has been married to Bobbi Goldin since December 1980 but controversially claimed he was once a homosexual but changed due to the teachings of philosopher Eli Siegel.\n\nHis most recent work is on Netflix's thriller Clinical and he works with young adults to help with their productions of Shakespeare.\n\nErnie Hudson\n\nWinston Zeddemore was Ernie's breakout role which set his career in Hollywood on the right path.\n\nThe 77-year-old star went on to star in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, HBO series Oz, and later played Sandra Bullock's FBI boss in Miss Congeniality.\n\nA year after Ghostbusters he married former flight attendant Linda Kingsberg.\n\nThey have two sons, and he has two sons from his previous marriage to Jeannie Moore.\n\nHe reprised his role as Winston in Ghostbusters: Afterlife."
