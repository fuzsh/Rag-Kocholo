        "text": "Two more actors have been cast in the upcoming James Brown biopic Get On Up. Dan Aykroyd will portray Ben Bart, the president of the agency that represented Brown for four decades, according to The Hollywood Reporter, and Scott will play a role written specifically for her as one of Brown’s wives. As previously reported, the actor playing the music icon will be 42 star Chadwick Boseman. The film will begin shooting this month.\n\nSee Where James Brown Falls on the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time List\n\nThe movie’s script traces Brown’s life from growing up in poverty to becoming the Godfather of Soul in the Sixties and Seventies and all of the tribulations that accompanied his rise, including drug addiction and money troubles. The film, which Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger is co-producing, will also feature Walking Dead album Lennie James as Brown’s father Joe, as well as actresses Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. It will be directed by Tate Taylor, who previously helmed The Help and Winter’s Bone.\n\nTrending\n\nJagger’s co-producer, Brian Grazer, has been attempting to make a Brown biopic since the late Nineties. Over the years, actors like Eddie Murphy and Wesley Snipes were rumored to play Brown. At one point, Spike Lee was rumored to be the director. The singer even helped out in the development of the film before his death in 2006. Now the film is back on track, after the producers secured the rights Brown’s songs."
