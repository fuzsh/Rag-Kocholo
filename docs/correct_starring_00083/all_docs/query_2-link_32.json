        "text": "It's been 40 years since Ernie Hudson found his breakout role in \"Ghostbusters,\" but fans of the franchise don't think the prolific actor has aged much since the '80s.\n\nAs Hudson, 78, travels the world promoting \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,\" social media users have spent the week feeling befuddled about Hudson almost being an octogenarian.\n\nOn Monday, the actor shared photos from the \"Frozen Empire\" international press tour on Instagram, saying he's had a \"wonderful time in New York and London.\"\n\n\"I am GENUINELY confused…Ernie is two years shy of 80?!?! What in the Twilight Vampire ... is going on?????\" one comment under his post reads. Another claimed, \"Ernie Hudson doesn't age. How can he look better than he did in the 80's?!\"\n\nOne U.K. YouTuber wrote on X that Hudson \"needs to be studied,\" showing a side-by-side photo of the actor in 1980 and 2024.\n\nAt a London photo call for the latest \"Ghostbusters\" film, Hudson sported a fitted black T-shirt that showed off his biceps, straight-legged dark wash jeans and close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair. The photos from this event in particular prompted several people to take to social media and marvel over his age-defying looks.\n\nFor comparison, Bette Midler, Helen Mirron, Goldie Hawn, Tom Selleck, John Lithgow, Henry Winkler, Steve Martin, Liza Minnelli and Mia Farrow are fellow celebrities who can also gloat about being 78.\n\nHudson, a father to four, was born on Dec. 17, 1945. He's been acting for nearly 50 years, since appearing in 1976's \"Leadbelly,\" and has more than 200 acting credits to his name, per IMDB.\n\nHudson has played Winston Zeddmore in four \"Ghostbusters\" films – 1984's \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Ghostbusters II,\" \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" and \"Frozen Empire\" – and made a cameo as a new character, Uncle Bill, in Paul Feig's 2016 \"Ghostbusters,\" which starred Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones.\n\nFrom worst to best: Every 'Ghostbusters' movie, ranked\n\nIn the first film, Winston Zeddemore walks into the Ghostbusters firehouse off the street needing a job and soon finds himself battling an ancient Sumerian god. This latest installment sees Winston having become a wealthy businessman who's founded a paranormal research center and even helps buddy Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) pay rent on his occult bookstore.\n\n\"Ghostbusters\" has been a part of Hudson’s existence for \"over half my life,\" he recently told USA TODAY, and it’s always nice “getting the old gang back” and playing hero with his friends.\n\nSpoilers! How that 'Frozen Empire' ending, post-credits scene tease 'Ghostbusters' future\n\n\"I want to do this as long as God blesses me to do it and people are willing to pay me,\" he said on the \"Jennifer Hudson Show\" earlier this month. \"The best gift you can give is be an example of what's possible. If I'm going to be on old man, an old Black man, I don't want to be an old, broke, Black man. You know what I mean? I don't want to be the guy who's in bad health.\"\n\nAs for his future in the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise, he said, \"I'm not sure if I'll be in it,\" but he wants fans to know if he doesn't have a role \"it won't be because of me.\"\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt"
