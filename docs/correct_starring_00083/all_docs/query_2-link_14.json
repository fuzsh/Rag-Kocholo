        "text": "Vigo From Ghostbusters II Died Eight Years Ago! (And Other Things You Didn't Know About Him)\n\nBy Andrew Blumetti\n\n\"Vigy, Vigy, Vigy, you have been a bad monkey!\"\n\n-Dr. Peter Venkman\n\nAmen brotha Billy... in fact you don't even know the half of it. Vigo the Carpathian, main antagonist in 1989's summer comedy spooktacular, Ghostbusters II, was a 17th Century Moldavian genocidal tyrant, so horridly sadist and blood-curdlingly malevolent, he earned a shopping list of jolly nicknames, including but not limited to: \"Vigo the Cruel\", \"Vigo the Torturer\", Vigo the Despised\" and \"Vigo the Butch Unholy\". Of course, when Ivan Reitman yelled \"Cut!\", the evil Vigo took off the armor plated threads and was nothing more than regular 20th Century human and German-born actor, Wilhelm von Homburg.\n\nWilhelm von Homburg? True, not the most household of names, especially here in the States. Much like I was, you'd be mighty surprised to see the surprising tales of the life of the man who played the painting who tried to steal the baby to come back and kill the men who captured ghosts for a high fee.\n\nCLEAN SWEEP!\n\nI guess they were low on janitors on set. During the filming of Ghostbusters II, he lost a bet and had to clean up after those sloppy Scoleri Brothers.\n\nLET'S WRASSLE!\n\nIn the 1950's, he wrestled in the United States with his father under his birth name, Norbert Grupe. Due to people incorrectly pronouncing his last name, \"Groupie\", he changed his name to the much more roll-off-the-tongue, Wilhelm von Homburg. A few years later, he'd switch over to a different kind of ring, as boxing came calling his name. If he had kept at wrestling, one couldn't help but think he could've been the 60's version of Doink the Clown.\n\nPUT UP YOUR DUKES!\n\nFrom 1962 to 1970, Homburg was a successful boxer, nicknamed \"Prinz\" in order to create a sense of royalty surrounding him. He was once called \"The Boxing Beatle\" due to his longer hair, and \"The German Answer to Muhammad Ali\". He ended his career with a record of 29 wins, 11 losses, and 6 draws. But to be fair, half of those victories came against Rick Moranis.\n\nIn 2002, a documentary about Homburg's life, entitled The Boxing Prince, was released.\n\nJUST YOUR AVERAGE AWKARD GERMAN TV INTERVIEW\n\nThe day after a lost boxing match against Oscar Bonavena in 1969, Homburg appeared for a tv interview on a German talk show. He sat silent and smirking for the entire 10 minutes as the interviewer made snarky comments about Homburg's boxing loss and his flashy lifestyle. Very low brow, Slimer would never behave in that manner.\n\nYEE-HAW!\n\nDespite his most prominent role in Ghostbusters II, Homburg also had a minor acting career, appearing in hit movies starring Carl Winslow, such as Die Hard, and non-hit movies without Carl Winslow, such as Diggstown, and John Carpenter's 1994 horror, In the Mouth of Madness.\n\nVIGO HAD THE SCARIEST ACTION FIGURE EVER.\n\nThis thing's got more guyeliner than Adam Lambert.\n\nVIGO'S VOICE? DUBBED...\n\nThanks to stupid self-righteous Sean Penn beating out Bill Murray's brilliant performance in 2003's Lost in Translation, we can't say Ghostbusters II included an Oscar-winning actor. At least we can say Bill Murray has good company with another Academy Award nominee in the film. Max von Sydow, a Swedish actor, best known for playing Father Lankester Merrin in The Exorcist, and who's appeared in Hannah and Her Sisters, The Diary of Anne Frank, and most recently, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, provided the few voiced lines of Vigo the Carpathian in the film.\n\nVIGO THE CONVICT\n\nIt wasn't all fun times in the ring and bro-down pow-wows with Dan Aykroyd for Homburg though. Paparazzi hounded him, and his descent into darker times. He became involved in drugs, drug dealing, pimping and extortion, spending a chunk of time with a Hell's Angels chapter. After many run-ins with Johnny Law, he spent five years in jail for charges on the previously mentioned. Which was a major pleabargin after his initial sentence of being sprayed endlessly with pink slime.\n\nADIOS 'OL VIGY...\n\nUnfortunately, after a troubled and turbulent life, Homburg passed away on March 10, 2004 from complications from cancer. And with him, we said goodbye to the second best Ghostbusters villain.\n\nWait, let me think...\n\n1. Stay Puft Marshmallow Man\n\n2. Vigo\n\n3. Walter Peck\n\n4. Zuul\n\n5. the old lady ghost in the library\n\n6. Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's assistant\n\n7. Female Gozar (who actually should count as Stay Puft as well...)"
