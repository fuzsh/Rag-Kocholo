        "text": "If Ghostbusters is ever remade , which actors do you think should play the roles of the following, in a potential remake,\n\n\"The Wisecracking\" Dr Peter Venkman\n\n\"The Heart of the Team\" Dr Ray Stantz\n\n\"The Brain of the Team\" Dr Egon Spengler\n\n\"The Voice of Reason\" Winston Zeddemore\n\n\"The Secretary & Confidante of the Team \" Janine Melnitz\n\nAnd any good ideas for a new Supernatural Villain?\n\nIf you like, you can change the original ethnicity/sexual orientation/gender/belief of the 5 characters but not their personality.\n\nI wouldn't mind seeing a new Ghostbusters with a new cast, but I'd rather they play different characters than the originals. If they had to recast, though, I'd like to see...\n\nBradley Cooper as Dr. Peter Venkman. He's cocky, but he's also funny. I can see him being the skeptic amongst the Ghostbusters who, when provided proof, can do the wheeling and dealing to get the business started. Plus, he'd also be the ladies man that Venkman is. I would also consider Paul Rudd for this role.\n\nJeff Goldblum or David Duchovny would be perfect for Dr. Egon Spengler. They're both scientific, kind of awkward. Both play smart people very well.\n\nEd Helms would be good as Dr. Ray Stantz, the heart of the Ghostbusters. Ray means well and is also a comic character. Steve Carell could also play this role.\n\nWill Smith could play Winston Zeddemore, the everyday man looking for a job and gets caught up in the paranormal happenings.\n\nJanine Melnitz would be kind of hard to cast. She's sassy, smart, and also pretty sexy (more so in Ghostbusters II). I could maybe see Sarah Silverman. Although if Jeff Goldblum were cast, it'd be pretty weird seeing her hitting on him. I guess maybe she's into older dudes.\n\nSeveral of these guys have worked together before, like Paul Rudd and Steve Carell, as well as Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, so they have chemistry together, which would be hard to replicate the chemistry of Ramis, Murray, Aykroyd and Hudson.\n\nPeter Venkman played by Woody Harrelson\n\nWoody has that southern charm and i can see him being a ladies man and making wisecracks as well. He is a worthy successor to Bill Murray.\n\nRay Stantz played by Charlie Day\n\nI liked him in Horrible Bosses and he will certainly bring a lot of heart to this role.\n\nEgon Spengler played by Seth Rogen\n\nHe can play deadpan roles and he is certainly looks smart enough to be Harold Ramis replacement.\n\nWinston Zeddemore played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.\n\nThe poor man 's Will Smith. He can play it straight like he did in Pearl Harbor.\n\nJanine Melnitz played by Allison Scagliotti\n\nI like her in Warehouse 13. She has spunk and i can see her getting into verbal sparring matches with Woody Harrelson's character and having a crush on Seth Rogen's character.\n\nSupernatural Villain = Rasputin\n\nRasputin was creepy as hell when he was alive and he certainly died a horrible death. I certainly do see him returning as a dangerous & vengeful spirit.\n\nGood call on Jeff Goldblum as Egon. I've always felt Egon was the oldest of the 4. He seems to be the perfect fit.\n\nI was kind of thinking about this the other day while watching something as I thought I saw the perfect actor to play one of the guys, but I don't remember who he is now.\n\nPaul Giamatti as either Ray or Peter, however I'm leaning towards Ray. Don't really have any ideas for the others at the moment. They don't necessarily have to play the same characters, but have have similar personas for a new generation of ghostbusters.\n\nWell going with the idea of a modern-day take on the characters/\n\n\"reboot\" then we must go with the idea of younger actors playing these parts. So previous mentions of people like Jeff Goldblum wouldn't quite fit. \"Established\" actors with something of a solid career and may not fit into a new franchise of movies may not completely fit either. (Like Woody Harrellson and Will Smith.) Nor would actors with something of an \"established persona\" like Stephen Colbert. It'd be hard to watch him in playing anything other than the Stephen Colbert he is on the Colbert Report. (That being a mockery of right-wing hyper-partisan political talking head.)\n\nSo...\n\nFor the new Peter Venkman-like character I agree with the idea of Bradley Cooper fitting that part.\n\nFor a new Ray Stanz-like character I'd go with Jonah Hill. I think he could have the best balance between comedic timing while also showing Ray's \"serious\" and smart side.\n\nEgon and Winston I can't think of right now.\n\nWell going with the idea of a modern-day take on the characters/\n\n\"reboot\" then we must go with the idea of younger actors playing these parts.\n\nHaving a reboot doesn't automatically mean you have to bring in young actors. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But the original guys weren't all that young to begin with when they appeared in Ghostbusters, and I think most of us are thinking in parallel terms to that when thinking of casting choices.\n\nI think there are two parts to the question.\n\n1. Who would I like to see in a NEW Ghostbusters movie?\n\nAnswer: All the original actors. They are not that old and are all still in the business.\n\n2. Who might I cast in a reboot/remake?\n\n\"The Wisecracking\" Dr Peter Venkman\n\nBill Murray (I just can't replace him.) or, if forced to, Benedict Cumberbatch\n\n\"The Heart of the Team\" Dr Ray Stantz\n\nColm Meaney\n\n\"The Brain of the Team\" Dr Egon Spengler\n\nBrent Spiner\n\n\"The Voice of Reason\" Winston Zeddemore\n\nTony Todd\n\n\"The Secretary & Confidante of the Team \" Janine Melnitz\n\nNicole deBoer\n\nVillians: Some duo played by Robert O'Reilly and Jeffrey Combs\n\nIf Ghostbusters is ever remade , which actors do you think should play the roles of the following, in a potential remake,\n\n\"The Wisecracking\" Dr Peter Venkman\n\n\"The Heart of the Team\" Dr Ray Stantz\n\n\"The Brain of the Team\" Dr Egon Spengler\n\n\"The Voice of Reason\" Winston Zeddemore\n\n\"The Secretary & Confidante of the Team \" Janine Melnitz\n\nAnd any good ideas for a new Supernatural Villain?\n\nIf you like, you can change the original ethnicity/sexual orientation/gender/belief of the 5 characters but not their personality.\n\nJohn Cho for Venkman\n\nJason Segal for Stantz\n\nThomas Gibson for Spengler\n\nSimon Helberg for Zeddemore\n\nEllen Page for Janine\n\nAmanda Seyfried, Dule Hill and Idris Elba as Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis and miscellaneous actor playing Gozer.\n\nThe Sta-Puft Marshmallow Man should be replaced by Barney, though.\n\nI think there are two parts to the question.\n\n1. Who would I like to see in a NEW Ghostbusters movie?\n\nAnswer: All the original actors. They are not that old and are all still in the business.\n\n2. Who might I cast in a reboot/remake?\n\n\"The Wisecracking\" Dr Peter Venkman\n\nBill Murray (I just can't replace him.) or, if forced to, Benedict Cumberbatch\n\n\"The Heart of the Team\" Dr Ray Stantz\n\nColm Meaney\n\n\"The Brain of the Team\" Dr Egon Spengler\n\nBrent Spiner\n\n\"The Voice of Reason\" Winston Zeddemore\n\nTony Todd\n\n\"The Secretary & Confidante of the Team \" Janine Melnitz\n\nNicole deBoer\n\nVillians: Some duo played by Robert O'Reilly and Jeffrey Combs\n\nWhy didn't I think of Brent Spiner as Egon. Doh! That's perfect He also kind of has a similar timber to his voice.\n\nDoesn't matter who's suitable, they'll get Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Seth Rogan (already mentioned) and Chris Rock (or worse, one of the Wayans).\n\nAs for good casting ideas:\n\nAubrey Plaza as Janine Melnitz\n\nAubrey is brilliant. Thank you.\n\nAs for the rest of your point, the thing is: If the right writers and directors were attached (ie, the guys who did \"Tropic Thunder,\" for example) I could actually live with that cast and think it might actually work."
