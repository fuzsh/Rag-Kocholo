        "text": "Spies Reminiscent of Us\n\nStewie and Brian are suspicious when two guys move into Cleveland's old house, and when they find out Dan (guest voice Aykroyd) and Chevy (guest voice Chase) are spies and they have dossiers of all the people in Quahog they follow them on a mission to Russia and end up in hot water.\n\nChuck Versus the Dream Job\n\nChuck's life seems to be coming together, his long-absent father has returned and he landed his dream job. Unfortunately for Chuck, neither turns out to be quite what he expected.\n\nBlue Harvest, Part 1\n\nIf you think you know Star Wars, you don't know Sith... The laughs come full Force when the Griffin clan puts a freakin' sweet spin on the greatest sci-fi saga ever told! Peter is hilariously fat as Han Solo, Lois reeks of royalty as Princess Leia, Chris walks funny as Luke Skywalker, Brian makes the fur fly as Chewbacca - and Stewie plots world domination, of course, as a diminutive (but still deadly) Darth Vader. Filled with outrageous gags, spaced-out droids and more intergalactic satire than you can shake a lightsaber at, this double-length episode is a must-own for every fan of Star Wars and Family Guy!"
