        "text": "Dan Aykroyd is definitely appearing in Jason Reitman’s Ghostbusters 2020 film, according the THR.\n\nAykroyd himself confirmed his involvement in the project on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast this week.\n\n“We’ve got the Ghostbusters movie that we’re working on now and I will have to be performing in that,” he said. “Ivan Reitman’s son Jason has written a new movie called, well, it’s gonna be Ghostbusters, the third movie. It will be all, most of the original people and then young stars.”\n\nThe actor also appeared in Paul Feig’s 2016 Ghostbusters film in a cameo role. He played a New York cab driver that utters the classic line: “I ain’t afraid of no ghosts.”\n\nIn Ivan Reitman’s original film and sequel, Aykroyd starred as Ghostbuster Ray Stantz, alongside Bill Murray as Peter Venkman, Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler, Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore, Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett and Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz. Hudson, Weaver and Potts are all also set to return for the new film.\n\nOther cast members confirmed for Ghostbusters 2020 include Paul Rudd (Ant-Man, Wet Hot American Summer), Mckenna Grace (Captain Marvel, Annabelle Comes Home), Logan Kim, Celeste O’Connor, Bokeem Woodbine (Fargo) Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things, It) and Carrie Coon (The Leftovers, Gone Girl).\n\nGhostbusters 3 is being directed by Jason Reitman, the son of Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989) director Ivan Reitman, and will take place in the same universe as the first two films. Reitman co-wrote the script with Gil Kenan.\n\nGet all the latest sci-fi news with every issue of SciFiNow.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nNo related posts."
