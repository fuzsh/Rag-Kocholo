He co-founded the House of Blues concert venue/restaurant chain and launched Crystal Head Vodka in 2007.\n\nCheck out the top grossing movies Aykroyd has appeared in over the course of his career.\n\nConeheads â $21 Million\n\nWhile it wasnât a blockbuster, the film led by Aykroyd and Jane Curtin follows aliens that crash-land on Earth and comedy ensues. Based off of a popular SNL skit, other famous comedians like Adam Sandler and David Spade can also be spotted throughout the film.\n\nSpies Like Us â $60 Million\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, the film was written by Aykroyd and starred himself and Chevy Chase as two government employees used as decoys for nuclear war. Just one year after the blockbuster Ghostbusters, Aykroyd once again proves his talent in writing some classic comedy and adventure.\n\nThe Great Outdoors â $41 Million\n\nOpposite the late comedian John Candy, Aykroyd plays the obnoxious brother-in-law ruining the family vacation Candy so desperately wants to go smoothly. Racoons, a large bear and a steak eating contest keeps audiences laughing.\n\nRELATED: 10 Richest Stand-Up Comedians Of All Time\n\nThe Blues Brothers â $57 Million\n\nAykroyd and John Belushi take their wildly popular SNL skit about two brothers reuniting their former R&B band to save a Catholic home where the men were raised. Blues Brothers spawned additional films, a real band with successful albums and even a restaurant, House of Blues, owned by the star.\n\nDragnet â $57 Million\n\nOpposite Tom Hanks, Aykroyd plays Joe Friday, a unique and laid-back detective. The two pair up to solve a crime in the film written by Aykroyd, but Hanksâs character can barely stand his partners antics throughout the investigation.\n\nMy Girl â $60 Million\n\nThe stars of the film are a young Macaulay Culkin and Anna Chlumsky and an unlikely friendship. Aykroyd takes a supporting role as Chlumskyâs father, a funeral home director with a unique perspective on life and guiding his pre-teen.\n\nChristmas with the Kranks â $73 Million\n\nHe plays the nosy and somewhat controlling neighbor to Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtisâ lead characters in a classic Christmas story about appreciating family, friends and those that support you during the crazy holiday hum drum.\n\nTrading Places â $90 Million\n\nAccording to IMDb, a snobbish investor played by Aykroyd and a con artist (Murphy) find their positions reversed in a classic Freaky Friday-like film. They learn about the trials and situations the other life leads, helping each other along the way.\n\nDriving Miss Daisy â $106 Million\n\nAn old Jewish woman played by Jessica Tandy and her chauffeur (Morgan Freeman) have a relationship that grows stronger over the years. Aykroyd plays Boolie Werthan, the older son of Tandy who cares for his mother, but not necessarily in the way she would like.\n\nGhostbusters II â $112 Million\n\nIn the second of a massive franchise, Aykroyd and the original team return to fight ghosts in a comedy and action film audiences had anticipated for five years after the first film. According to Looper, Aykroyd has always been passionate about the paranormal, claiming he believes in UFOâs, spiritual encounters and even Bigfoot.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom â $180 Million\n\nAykroyd took a small role in the 1984 film as Art Weber, the airport personnel who secured a flight for Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) that was carrying live poultry. The film follows Jones on an adventure in India as he stumbles upon a secret cult with human sacrifices and the hero finds a mythical stone despite the wild ride.\n\nPearl Harbor â $198 Million\n\nAs Captain Thurman, Aykroyd displays his serious side in an epic historical drama starring Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett. The film follows two friends and a beautiful nurse caught up in the horror of the morning of 1941.\n\nGhostbusters â $238 Million\n\nHe wrote the screenplay for himself and best friend John Belushi. Upon Belushiâs untimely death, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray joined the team, creating a cult classic that has spawned additional films, merchandise and a following unlike weâve seen before in 1984.\n\nREAD NEXT: 10 Highest Earning Comedy Movies, Ranked\n\nSources: Celebrity Net Worth, IMDb, Looper\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMqKmin5mjrq15xqGmrKySqsC1sdFmaGxlmJ60qbHSrWSgqp%2BowKq6xmadoqSdqHq0wMCrqaKml2KxorqMmrCkqp%2BusXA%3D"
