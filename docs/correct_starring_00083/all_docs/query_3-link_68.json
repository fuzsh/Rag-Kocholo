        "text": "Dan Aykroyd knows he couldn’t get away with blackface nowadays like he did 40 years ago alongside Eddie Murphy in 1983’s “Trading Places.”\n\nThe 70-year-old actor spoke with The Daily Beast about the film, which follows his character, a wealthy investment broker, switching places with a broke con artist (played by Murphy, 62).\n\nIn one scene of the R-rated comedy, Aykroyd appears in blackface while wearing dreadlocks and speaking in a Caribbean accent.\n\n“I was in blackface in that film, and I probably couldn’t get away with it now,” Aykroyd told the outlet last week.\n\n“Eddie and I were improvising there. Eddie is a black man, and his entourage were all black people, and I don’t think they batted an eye. There was no objection then; nobody said anything. It was just a good comic beat that was truthful to the story.”\n\nAykroyd continued: “I probably wouldn’t choose to do a blackface part, nor would I be allowed to do it. I probably wouldn’t be allowed to do a Jamaican accent, white face or black. In these days we’re living in, all that’s out the window. I would be hard-pressed to do an English accent and get away with it. They’d say, ‘Oh, you’re not English, you can’t do it.’”\n\nThe Post has contacted reps for Aykroyd and Murphy for comment.\n\nIn another memorable “Trading Places” scene, Aykroyd sits on a bus dressed as Santa, eating a piece of salmon through his dirty beard hair.\n\nAykroyd claimed he really did taste the nasty fish.\n\n“Of course I ate the salmon through the beard,” he told the Daily Beast. “Absolutely. Take after take, I can tell you.”\n\nJamie Lee Curtis, who also starred in the film, presented Murphy the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes in January. She called him “one of the most talented, funniest and charismatic artists working today.”\n\n“[Eddie] was just starting out and developing his comedic gift and comedic voice. To see and be a part of a talent emerging like that was part of film history,” Aykroyd told the Daily Beast of their time on “Trading Places.” “Jamie Lee Curtis and I became good friends too, and we remain so to this day.”\n\nAykroyd and his wife, Donna Dixon, announced their split last year after 39 years of marriage. They claimed they would remain legally married and maintain a “loving friendship.”"
