Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis take up their proton packs once more to battle the forces of evil in Manhattan! After waging a war on slime that cost New York City millions, the Ghostbusters find themselves out of business until an ancient tyrant, preparing a return to the Earthly domain through his portrait at the Manhattan Museum of Modern Art, sets his sights on Dana Barrett's baby as the new home for his wicked soul! With the help of the Museum's possessed curator, he plans to turn New York into a really scary place to live! Now only the Ghostbusters can save New York City, by turning paranormal pest control into an art form!",

        "text": "Murray's character sits firmly at the center of the film, and makes it part of a series, rather than just another sequel.\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nIn general, it has the same look and feel, but the energy and enthusiasm have waned.\n\nSeptember 6, 2020\n\nMurray's in his prime here as one of four fearless slime fighters in a sequel that is just about as funny and entertaining as the original.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nThe sequel is, on the whole, a fairly mechanical spook show, filled with grinning ghosts that are definitely ghoulish but hardly menacing.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nAn almost uniformly substandard follow-up that, since the original film remains so beloved by so many people, still gets to be disappointing even two decades and change later.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
