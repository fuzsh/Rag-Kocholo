        "text": "Wolfhard is set to play an NBC page in the upcoming movie 'SNL 1975,' which will chronicle the series premiere of 'Saturday Night Live'\n\nFinn Wolfhard had a front row seat to stories about the early days of Saturday Night Live courtesy of his legendary Ghostbusters: Frozen City costar, Dan Aykroyd.\n\nOn Thursday night, Wolfhard, 21, walked the red carpet at the New York City premiere of the sequel to 2021's Ghostbusters: Afterlife. At the screening, the Stranger Things star revealed to PEOPLE that Aykroyd, 71, has helped him prepare for his role in the upcoming SNL 1975 movie, which chronicles the hours leading up to the Oct. 11, 1975 premiere of the NBC sketch comedy series.\n\n\"He told me stories just about how none of them were famous yet, and there was a time where they were all normal people that were in the world and trying to make a living as being comedians and just hearing about just how Dan lived as a guy before SNL and his daily life,\" Wolfhard tells PEOPLE, noting that \"it was really incredible and very insightful.\"\n\nWolfhard's addition to the SNL 1975 cast was first announced by Deadline on Tuesday. The actor is set to play an NBC page who is trying to convince people to come see the network's new sketch comedy series during its first live taping.\n\nRelated: Original Ghostbusters Stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson Join Paul Rudd at Frozen Empire Premiere\n\nThe It actor added at the premiere that working alongside so many veteran comedy actors in the latest Ghostbusters film was \"very surreal.\" He tells PEOPLE, \"You've watched them growing up and so it's incredible — you learn a lot from them and it feels very dream-like for a long time and then it becomes a job, which is insane.\"\n\nSNL 1975's ensemble, meanwhile, also includes Dylan O'Brien as Aykroyd, Cory Michael Smith as Chevy Chase, Nicholas Podany as Billy Crystal, Nicholas Braun as Jim Henson, Lamorne Morris as Garrett Morris, Ella Hunt as Gilda Radner and Matt Wood as John Belushi and Kaia Gerber as Jacqueline Carlin.\n\nRelated: Garrett Morris Reveals the Advice He Gave Actor Who Will Play Him in Upcoming SNL Film (Exclusive)\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Wolfhard shared that even though his role in the film is a small one, he's just excited to be part of the cast. \"I’m not a main character, but just to be a part of the ensemble is a gift,\" he said.\n\nWolfhard continued, \"I’m so excited for people to see it. A lot of the interiors and stuff like that are going to be shot in Atlanta, but the other night, we shot outside of 30 Rock, for real, and on film, with a bunch of old ‘70s picture cars. Looking up at the top of 30 Rock while filming was the most surreal experience.\"\n\nSNL 1975 also serves as a reunion of sorts for the young actor, since it's written and directed by Jason Reitman, who also directed Ghostbusters: Afterlife and is a writer-producer on Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.\n\nFilming on SNL 1975 is currently underway. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire premieres in theaters on march 22.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
