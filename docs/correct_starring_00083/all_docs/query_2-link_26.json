        "text": "Ross Niebergall\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nI cannot say that I was overly impressed by the first \"Ghostbusters\"\n\nmovie. It was amusing and entertaining up to the point when the giant\n\nmarshmallow man appeared, and then it just became too silly to be\n\nentertaining anymore. Now after seeing \"Ghostbusters II\" I would have to\n\ngive it a similar criticism. Both writers of the film, Harold Ramis and\n\nDan Aykroyd, started their careers as writers with Second City, and Aykroyd\n\nwent on to write for Saturday Night Live, while Ramis wrote for SCTV.\n\nWhile doing this both proved that they are very capable of writing episodes\n\nand skits. What appears to be lacking is their ability to come up with a\n\nplot that remains reasonable for two full hours. \"Ghostbusters II\" has some\n\nvery funny scenes, but it seems as though they treat the climax of the film\n\nas though if were just another scene with a bigger gag, and more special\n\neffect than the rest.\n\nThis is not to say that the film does not have any redeeming qualities.\n\nIt is well directed by Ivan Reitman (\"Twins\") and the opening scene with\n\nSigourney Weaver chasing a possessed baby carriage through New York's streets\n\nis particularly well done. Bill Murray livens up the picture with his\n\npresence, and it is with his character that Ramis and Aykroyd's writing\n\nstyles are particularly suited. Murray's character has little to do with the\n\nplot, but he is the center of attention of every scene he is in, and\n\ndeservedly so. He is entertaining enough to diffuse the weak plot. Clearly\n\nhe uses his ability to improvise, and this is seen well in the scenes he\n\nplays with Weaver's characters baby. Ramis and Akyroyd also perform their\n\nacting jobs adequately, and the dialogue between the three stars is excellent.\n\nCertainly Akyroyd is the best actor there is at speaking \"techno-gibberish\".\n\nThe only place where the film fails is in the lack of an encompassing\n\nplot, and if one is willing to forgive this, the movie is\n\nentertaining, if only to see Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis."
