Like a ghost from the franchise's past, Dan Aykroyd will appear in the new "Ghostbusters." The 63-year-old actor, who played Dr. Raymond Stantz in 1984's "Ghostbusters" and 1989's "Ghostbusters II," will make a cameo in Paul Feig's version starring Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Kristen Wiig.

Aykroyd co-wrote the first two "Ghostbusters" movies, which co-starred Ernie Hudson, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. It's unknown whether Hudson or Murray will pop up in Feig's female-led series revamp.

Indie Revolver reported Tuesday that Aykroyd was on set with Wiig in Boston Monday night. In the scene, Columbia University professor and paranormal expert Erin Gilbert (Wiig) tries in vain to Hail Aykroyd's cab. Aykroyd threw out the iconic line, "I ain't afraid of no ghosts!" and drove off with Wiig yelling something along the lines of "That's a double negative! That means you are afraid of ghosts!"

Aykroyd confirmed his cameo appearance via Twitter, telling fans, "On GB set shooting my scene with funny beautiful Kristen Wiig lady GB'S are adorable, hilarious and badass Exhilarating! #ghostbusters."

Though Aykroyd later deleted the tweet, the actor's reps confirmed his casting to Entertainment Weekly. No other details were provided.
