        "text": "By Elena Sanz\n\nIf receiving a Nobel Prize is the highest recognition for a scientist, being awarded twice by the Swedish Academy of Sciences is an extraordinary fact that, so far, only four people can boast: Frederick Sanger, Linus Pauling, John Bardeen and Marie Curie.\n\nMarie Curie\n\nThe first person in history to achieve the feat of receiving a double Nobel was the Polish Marie Skłodowska Curie, laureate first in Physics and, later, in Chemistry. What few know is that she was about to not receive the first of the awards. And it is that in 1903, the French Academy of Sciences proposed only Henri Becquerel and Pierre Curie as candidates for the Nobel Prize in Physics. Outraged to learn of the nomination, the mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler warned Pierre, and he was emphatic in his response: \"If it is true that someone is thinking of me [for the Nobel Prize], I would like to be considered along with Madame Curie for our work in radioactive bodies […] his part is very large in this discovery (he has also determined the atomic weight of radium)”, he wrote in a letter.\n\nAfter pulling some strings, Marie was added to the candidacy. And in December 1903, the three scientists (Becquerel and the Curie couple) were awarded the prestigious award. In the mention of the Curies, their discovery of polonium and radium was voluntarily excluded, since the chemists of the nominating committee insisted that it deserved a future Nobel Prize in Chemistry..\n\nSo it was. Curie's second prize came on December 10, 1911, although, following Pierre's death in 1906 in an unfortunate traffic accident, this time it fell to Marie alone. As the experts had already anticipated, she was awarded \"for her contribution to the advancement of chemistry with the discovery of radium and polonium\", two elements that were much more radioactive than uranium (the first known radioactive element).\n\nLinus Pauling"
