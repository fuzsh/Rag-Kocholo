        "text": "Nearly five decades ago, Peter Higgs sent physicists on a chase to find a particle that gives the universe its mass. Today, at age 84, he, along with physicist François Englert, received the Nobel Prize in physics for their work.\n\nThe video above comes from the day last July when scientists at CERN made the announcement that they believed they had finally found that particle, the Higgs Boson. At minute 0:50, the camera pans to Peter Higgs, where you can see him tearing up at the news.\n\nBut what is really lovely is what Higgs later told The Guardian's science correspondent Ian Sample, as he recalled that day:\n\nAs Sample tweeted this morning,"
