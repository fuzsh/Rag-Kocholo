        "text": "Renowned physicist Peter Higgs, best known for proposing the existence of the Higgs Boson, has passed away at the age of 94 after a brief illness. His groundbreaking work revolutionised the field of physics and earned him the prestigious Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013. He shared the award with fellow physicist François Englert.\n\nIn the 1960s, Higgs introduced the concept of the Higgs Boson as part of his theory explaining how particles acquire mass. This elusive particle, often referred to as the \"God Particle,\" plays a crucial role in the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the fundamental building blocks of the universe and their interactions.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs Boson holds profound significance for our understanding of the cosmos. It helps to answer fundamental questions about the origin of mass and the fundamental forces that govern the universe. Without the Higgs Boson, particles would remain massless, and the universe as we know it would be vastly different.\n\nHiggs' Nobel Prize-winning discovery culminated in 2012 when scientists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland confirmed the existence of the Higgs Boson by detecting its signature decay products. This landmark achievement validated Higgs' decades-old hypothesis and confirmed a cornerstone of modern physics.\n\nALSO SEE: CERN's Large Hadron Collider Is Looking For Dark Photons. But... Why?\n\n\"Peter Higgs was a remarkable individual – a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us,\" said Peter Mathieson, Principal and Vice Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, where Higgs was a physicist.\n\n\"His pioneering work has motivated thousands of scientists, and his legacy will continue to inspire many more for generations to come.\"\n\nCERN's Director General, Fabiola Gianotti, also paid his tributes by acknowledging Higgs's \"outstanding contributions to particle physics.\" Gianotti called Higgs a very special person who was \"a man of rare modesty\" and \"a great teacher.\""
