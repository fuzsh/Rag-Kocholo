        "text": "Professor Peter Higgs CH FRS has joined the ranks of Charles Darwin, Humphry Davy and Albert Einstein by winning the world’s oldest scientific prize, the Royal Society’s Copley Medal, for his work on the theory of the Higgs boson, discovered at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012.\n\nHiggs receives the Copley Medal for his fundamental contribution to particle physics with his theory explaining the origin of mass in elementary particles, confirmed by the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nThe Copley medal was first awarded by the Royal Society in 1731, 170 years before the first Nobel Prize. It is awarded for outstanding achievements in scientific research and has most recently been awarded to eminent scientists such as theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, DNA fingerprinting pioneer Alec Jeffreys and Andre Geim, for his discovery of graphene.\n\nModern physics suggests that matter consists of a set of particles that act as building blocks and that between these particles lie forces that are controlled by another set of particles. A fundamental property of the majority of particles is that they have a mass.\n\nIn 1964, Peter Higgs proposed a theory about the existence of a particle that explains why these other particles have a mass. At the same time, yet separately, François Englert and Robert Brout proposed the same theory. The existence of the Higgs boson was confirmed by two experiments carried out at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. The Nobel Prize in Physics 2013 was awarded jointly to Peter Higgs and François Englert.\n\nAs well as the Copley Medal, the Royal Society has today announced all of the recipients of its awards, medals and prize lectures. The scientists receive the awards in recognition of their achievements in a wide variety of fields of research.\n\nCommenting on his receipt of the Copley Medal, Professor Peter Higgs CH FRS, said:\n\n“It is an honour to be the recipient this year of the Copley Medal, the Royal Society’s premier award.”\n\nSir Paul Nurse, President of the Royal Society, said:\n\n“Peter Higgs is a most deserving winner of the Copley Medal. I congratulate him. His work, alongside that of François Englert, has helped shape our fundamental understanding of the world around us. The search for the Higgs boson completely ignited the public’s imagination, hopefully inspiring the next generation of scientists. The Copley Medal is the highest honour the Royal Society can give a scientist and Peter Higgs joins the ranks of the world’s greatest ever scientists.”\n\nThe winners of the following Royal Society Medals and Awards are announced today:\n\nPremier Awards\n\nCopley Medal\n\nProfessor Peter Higgs CH FRS for his fundamental contribution to particle physics with his theory explaining the origin of mass in elementary particles, confirmed by the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nRoyal Medals\n\nDame Jocelyn Bell Burnell DBE FRS for her pivotal contribution in observing, analysing & understanding pulsars, one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the 20th century.\n\nProfessor Elizabeth Blackburn AC FRS for her work on the prediction and discovery of telomerase and the role of telomeres in protecting and maintaining the genome.\n\nSir Christopher Llewellyn Smith FRS for his major contributions to the development of the Standard Model, particularly his success in making the case for the building of the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nCroonian Medal and Lecture\n\nProfessor Enrico Coen CBE FRS for his work resulting in a new theoretical and experimental foundation for understanding how the shapes of biological structures arise through development and evolution\n\nBakerian Medal and Lecture\n\nProfessor Andrea Ghez for her acclaimed discoveries using the techniques of optical astronomy, especially her sustained work on the motions and nature of the stars orbiting the black hole in the centre of our Galaxy\n\nMedals\n\nDavy Medal\n\nProfessor Gideon Davies FMedSci FRS for his field-defining work in determining the reaction chemistry of enzyme-catalysed carbohydrate transformations with major applications in medicine and biotechnology.\n\nBuchanan Medal\n\nProfessor Irwin McLean FMedSci FRS for his major contribution to our understanding of the genetic basis of heritable skin diseases.\n\nHughes Medal\n\nProfessor George Efstathiou FRS for many outstanding contributions to our understanding of the early Universe, in particular his pioneering computer simulations, observations of galaxy clustering and studies of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.\n\nGabor Medal\n\nProfessor Benjamin Simons for his work analysing stem cell lineages in development, tissue homeostasis and cancer, revolutionising our understanding of stem cell behaviour in vivo.\n\nPrize lectures\n\nClifford Paterson Medal and Lecture\n\nProfessor Russell Cowburn FRS for his remarkable academic, technical and commercial achievements in nano-magnetics.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Prize and Lecture\n\nProfessor Andrew Hattersley FRS for his work on genetic and physiological studies of patients with common subtypes of monogenic diabetes revolutionising treatment for these patients.\n\nMichael Faraday Prize and Lecture\n\nProfessor Katherine Willis for her excellent work in science communication.\n\nRosalind Franklin Award\n\nProfessor Lucy Carpenter for her scientific achievement, her suitability as a role model and her project proposal to promote women in STEM.\n\nFrancis Crick Medal and Lecture\n\nDr Madan Babu Mohan for his major and widespread contributions to computational biology.\n\nMilner Award 2015\n\nProfessor Thomas Henzinger for fundamental advances in the theory and practice of formal verification and synthesis of reactive, real-time, and hybrid computer systems.\n\nMilner Award 2016\n\nDr Xavier Leroy in recognition of his exceptional achievements in computer programming which includes the design and implementation of the OCaml programming language.\n\nAwards\n\nPfizer Advanced Award\n\nProfessor Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum for his seminal work on viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, generating the foundation of our understanding of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and control of outbreaks of these viral infections.\n\nPfizer Early Career Award\n\nDr Gordon Awandare for his achievements in molecular and cellular studies of malaria, including how malaria parasites invade red blood cells and cause disease."
