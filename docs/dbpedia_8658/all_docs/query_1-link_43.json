        "text": "In Memoriam: Peter Higgs (1929 – 2024)\n\nWolfgang Bietenholz and José Antonio García-Hernández\n\nInstituto de Ciencias Nucleares\n\nUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)\n\nApartado Postal 70-543, 04510 Ciudad de México, Mexico\n\nPeter Higgs was a British theoretical physicist, famous for his work published in 1964, where he proposed a mechanism that can generate masses for elementary particles, while respecting gauge invariance. Half a century later, two experiments at CERN confirmed that this mechanism is realized in nature. On April 8th, we received the sad news of the passing of the great pioneer of elementary particle physics. This article is dedicated to his memory, and to the mechanism and particle that bear his name.\n\n1 Biography and historical context\n\nPeter Higgs was born in 1929 in Newcastle, England, spending his youth partially during World War II, circumstances that somewhat complicated his schooling. After the war, he studied in London, first mathematics, then physics. In 1954, only 25 years old, he completed his Ph.D. at King’s College.\n\nHe then worked temporarily at the University of Edinburgh, University College, and Imperial College, both in London. In 1960, he returned to Edinburgh – a city he loved and where he had first arrived in 1949, as a hitchhiking student – to take up a professorship and stay there for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1964, at the age of 35, he wrote his two famous papers (and another on the same subject in 1966) [1] that attracted attention and led to invitations to present seminars at Princeton and Harvard in 1966. He had to deal with critical audiences; Sidney Coleman later commented that at Harvard, “they had been looking forward to tearing apart this idiot who thought that he could get around the Goldstone Theorem” [2]. It turned out that his concept stood, but still without phenomenological application (his papers dealt with a toy model). Additionally, he learned from Yoichiro Nambu (the referee of one of his papers) about a similar work [3], published 15 days before Higgs’ first paper on the subject. The authors were François Englert and Robert Brout, who worked in Brussels, Belgium. Two months later, yet another related paper appeared, written in London by Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, and Tom Kibble [4], but they knew and cited the earlier works of Englert, Brout, and Higgs.\n\nThe mechanism proposed in these three articles was not entirely new: it had been established in 1962/3 in the context of condensed matter physics by Philip Anderson [5]. He applied concepts of Julian Schwinger [6] for the theoretical explanation of the mass of a gauge particle to the theory of superconductors. Englert, Brout, and Higgs presented an extension to relativistic models.\n\nIndependently, in Moscow in 1964, two 19-year-old boys, both named Alexander (or Sasha), with surnames Migdal and Polyakov, discussed in great detail what the breaking of a symmetry means [7]. They wrote another article, very different but with equivalent conclusions, which was published in 1966 [8]. In 2010, Migdal visited Mexico and narrated about the difficulties they had in publishing this article, as the established physics community in the Soviet Union – under the leadership of Lev Landau – rejected the Quantum Field Theory, which was still very controversial also in the Western world. Finally, this article got published somewhat late, but even later both Sashas became famous for other works — in particular, Polyakov is known for discovering topological excitations that we now call instantons.\n\nThe explanation of how gauge particles – and certain particles coupled to them – can have mass soon became known as the Higgs mechanism, the subject of Section 2 of this article. Its application to the phenomenology of elementary particles emerged in 1967/8 by Steven Weinberg [9] and Abdus Salam [10]. They incorporated this mechanism into the model of electroweak interaction that Sheldon Glashow had proposed in 1961 [11] during his stay in Copenhagen. In fact, Glashow was present at Higgs’ seminar at Harvard, and he appreciated his “nice model” [2], but it did not come to his mind that this mechanism could be the remedy to save his model, which he had already abandoned.\n\nHowever, this theory – now known as the electroweak sector of the Standard Model – was still not generally accepted as it was considered “non-renormalizable”. In Quantum Field Theories, divergences almost always appear at high energies, so they require a “regularization”, a mathematical manipulation that turns divergences into finite values. A theory is called renormalizable if, at the end of the calculation, the regularization can be completely removed and finite predictions for observables can be obtained (this definition is slightly simplistic).\n\nThe physics community changed its view in 1971/2, thanks to the work of Gerard ’t Hooft, a brilliant PhD student in Utrecht, Netherlands, who presented evidence in favor of the renormalizability of this model (partially alongside his advisor, Martin Veltman). These works [12] were a sensation at that time that caused a paradigm shift.\n\nThe key to this milestone was a new method, the dimensional regularization, which is among the main achievements of physics in Latin America: it was first proposed by two Argentinians, Carlos Bollini and Juan José Giambiagi in 1971, although the publication [13] was delayed until 1972. They worked in La Plata, under difficult circumstances during the military dictatorship [14].\n\nWe add that nowadays less importance is given to the question of whether or not the Standard Model is renormalizable: the trend is that it is considered as an effective theory, and its validity in over a large energy range – which does not need to extend to infinity – is sufficient.\n\nShortly thereafter, in 1973, the Standard Model of elementary particles was completely established, with the electroweak sector [9, 10] and another sector of the strong interaction [15]. The Higgs mechanism is essential to provide masses to a large part of the elementary particles. This was a revolution in high-energy physics as we have not seen it anymore in the following half-century; ever since, progress was relatively slow.\n\nIn the 21st century, it is popular to speculate about physics beyond the Standard Model. However, for now, none of these proposals have solid support from experimental data. On the other hand, experiments have confirmed the predictions of the Standard Model again and again: often it comes out in the news that the Standard Model has been “refuted” by new results, but at the end of the analysis, and the repetition of the experiments, its predictions have always triumphed.\n\nThe Standard Model is somewhat incomplete to describe the universe (in particular gravity, dark matter, and dark energy are missing), but even so: it is nothing less than the most precise and – in this sense – the most successful theory in the history of science.\n\nHiggs no longer participated in this rapid development. He was already so famous that he could afford to hardly publish research results anymore from the age of 40.\n\nHe was known as a quiet and modest person, almost shy, who did not seek media attention or to be in the spotlight at events. With his mindset of abstaining from the show, he can be characterized as the opposite of Feynman. This characterization corresponds to the impression of one of the authors (WB) who participated in a conference in Edinburgh in 1997. Higgs – who had been emeritus since 1996 – appeared at the banquet, but very discreetly, simply to sit at a table without any spectacle.\n\nThis does not mean that Higgs did not have convictions: he was temporarily an activist for nuclear disarmament and for the environmental movement as a member of Greenpeace.\n\nOnce the Standard Model had been established, its exploration progressed with intense work in multiple countries. In the year 2000, all of its particles had already been experimentally found, except for one: the famous “Higgs particle”, involved in the corresponding mechanism, as we will describe in Section 2.\n\nAgain, the nomenclature is perhaps a bit unfair to Englert and Brout, but this is the convention of the community. Higgs did not invent this term (this was first done by Ben Lee [2]), but he was also uncomfortable with the absurd nickname “god particle” that does not make the slightest sense. This term was proposed by the editor of a popular science book [17], obviously with a commercial objective, but fully irresponsible. This term became popular and led to endless confusion, for example, the Catholic Church of Spain believed that the work at CERN had something to do with theology [18]. We have to be careful with the terms we use!\n\nIn the 21st century, we witnessed an exciting race in the search for the Higgs particle. In its final phase, it was a competition between Fermilab (near Chicago) and CERN (near Geneva, in a bordering region between Switzerland and France). After initial indications in 2011, in 2012 the Collaborations ATLAS and CMS, both working independently at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, presented indirect but compelling evidence for the observation of the so wanted Higgs particle [19].\n\nWith this, the entire set of particles of the Standard Model was observed. Thus it was confirmed that the Higgs mechanism is realized in nature, 48 years after its theoretical proposal. This took almost twice as long as the observation of the neutrino (predicted by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, and detected by Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines and collaborators in 1956), we see that sometimes it is worth being patient.\n\nIn particular, it was worth it for Englert and Higgs, who received the Nobel Prize in 2013 for their correct prediction [7]; sadly, Brout had died shortly before, in 2011. In April 2024, we received news of Higgs’ passing away, at the age of 94, after a brief illness.\n\n2 The Higgs Mechanism\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the world consists of elementary particles, which are indivisible, and occur in a few types (say 25, but it depends a bit on how one counts). Famous examples are the electron and the photon (the particle of light).\n\nTheir relativistic description is based on “fields”, abstract quantities, present throughout the universe, at any time. At some space-point, a field can take different states, depending on time. If the fields in a region are in their ground states, we perceive the vacuum. Excitations are quantized and manifest as elementary particles; this is the idea of the Quantum Field Theory.\n\nThere is a field for each type of elementary particle, and their excitations can move (like waves), interact, generate, and destroy particles (this is a requirement for compatibility with Special Relativity, which is lacking in Quantum Mechanics).\n\nA central concept is symmetry: symmetry means the invariance of physical properties under a group of transformations of one or more fields. We distinguish between global and local symmetries:\n\n•\n\nIf a symmetry is global, a field transforms in the same way everywhere. One can imagine a group of people doing collective gymnastics, all making the same movement, which could be synchronized with music. (The image is a bit simplistic because the fields transform in the same way even throughout space-time.)\n\n•\n\nThe case of a local symmetry can be imagined as chaotic gymnastics: each person moves as he/she wishes, independently. This means that the fields can be transformed independently at each point in space-time.\n\nIt is clear that this type of symmetry allows many more transformations. Achieving local symmetry is far more difficult but leads to stronger restrictions, and therefore to a powerful ability to make predictions.\n\nTechnically, an additional field is introduced, known as the gauge field, which transforms in such a way as to compensate for the relative change between nearby points in a simultaneous transformation. This successful concept describes the transmission of interactions, but it only works if local symmetry is exact.\n\nAn important category of particles is known as “fermions”: the (known) elementary fermions have spin 1/2121/21 / 2 in natural units. Spin is an internal degree of freedom that manifests like an angular momentum. The fermions of the Standard Model are the electron, its two heavier “cousins” (the muon and the tauon), neutrinos (much lighter and electrically neutral) and quarks (constituents of composite particles, such as the proton and the neutron).\n\nA fermion can exist in two variants, with “chirality” left or right; it can be imagined as hands, or gloves, which are left or right, but for fermions in an abstract sense.\n\nSuppose e.g. an electron without mass: in this case, the left (eLsubscript𝑒𝐿e_{L}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and right (eRsubscript𝑒𝑅e_{R}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) electron are independent, and their spin points against (for eLsubscript𝑒𝐿e_{L}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) or in (for eRsubscript𝑒𝑅e_{R}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) their direction of motion (a particle without mass cannot be at rest). This is symbolically illustrated in Figure 10.\n\nIncluding a mass term requires a product of the fields of the left and right electrons (one can imagine the two hands holding onto each other). Then they are no longer independent, and under symmetry they have to transform in the same way.\n\nThis is, however, not the case in Glashow’s electroweak theory [11]: this theory allows, for example, local (“gauge”) transformations that only affect eLsubscript𝑒𝐿e_{L}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, but not eRsubscript𝑒𝑅e_{R}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Here was the problem: this theory seemed to be incompatible with the mass term of the electron (and other fermions), but we know that the electron does have a mass of Me≃0.511⁢MeVsimilar-to-or-equalssubscript𝑀𝑒0.511MeVM_{e}\\simeq 0.511\\ {\\rm MeV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≃ 0.511 roman_MeV (still in natural units).\n\nIn fact, the situation was even worse. The gauge particles that transmit weak force are called W±superscript𝑊plus-or-minusW^{\\pm}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, Z0superscript𝑍0Z^{0}italic_Z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (with electric charge ±1, 0plus-or-minus1 0\\pm 1,\\,0± 1 , 0), for example, the W𝑊Witalic_W are responsible for radioactive decay. This force has a very short range (about 10−17superscript101710^{-17}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 17 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT m) that can only be explained if W±superscript𝑊plus-or-minusW^{\\pm}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, Z0superscript𝑍0Z^{0}italic_Z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT have large masses (they are among the heaviest elementary particles we know, with masses of MW=80.4⁢GeVsubscript𝑀𝑊80.4GeVM_{W}=80.4\\,{\\rm GeV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_W end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 80.4 roman_GeV and MZ=91.2⁢GeVsubscript𝑀𝑍91.2GeVM_{Z}=91.2\\,{\\rm GeV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 91.2 roman_GeV). But just like the mass of the electron, it seems that gauge symmetry, which has to be exact, requires mW=mZ=0subscript𝑚𝑊subscript𝑚𝑍0m_{W}=m_{Z}=0italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_W end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.\n\nThe puzzle of where the masses of gauge particles could possibly come from was a “killer question” with which Wolfgang Pauli ruined a seminar by Chen-Ning Yang in Princeton in 1953 on gauge theories with a non-Abelian symmetry group (now known as Yang-Mills theories). Without knowing the Higgs mechanism, Yang could not answer, but Pauli insisted so much that Yang sat down, frustrated. Finally, Robert Oppenheimer had to encourage him to continue his talk [24].\n\nSo, how does the salvation of this theory, the Higgs mechanism, work? First, another field is added, the Higgs field, we use the notation ϕ⁢(x)italic-ϕ𝑥\\phi(x)italic_ϕ ( italic_x ). The variable x𝑥xitalic_x is a point in space-time, and ϕitalic-ϕ\\phiitalic_ϕ is a scalar field, its fluctuations represent particles with spin 0. To establish an electron mass term, now a product of three fields is formed, eLsubscript𝑒𝐿e_{L}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, ϕitalic-ϕ\\phiitalic_ϕ, and eRsubscript𝑒𝑅e_{R}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. The Higgs field also transforms under local symmetry, in such a manner that the term as a whole is gauge invariant.\n\nSo in this way, a permissible term (gauge invariant) can be added, but does this provide mass to the electron? Possibly yes, it can work with the following scenario.\n\nAt low energies, the Higgs field “freezes” to its ground state, manifesting almost as a constant. This constant does not have to be zero: indeed, ϕitalic-ϕ\\phiitalic_ϕ has 4 real components, but we can imagine there to be only 2, ϕ1,ϕ2∈ℝsubscriptitalic-ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ2ℝ\\phi_{1},\\,\\phi_{2}\\in\\mathbb{R}italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ blackboard_R, parameterizing a plane. This field comes with a potential V⁢(ϕ1,ϕ2)𝑉subscriptitalic-ϕ1subscriptitalic-ϕ2V(\\phi_{1},\\phi_{2})italic_V ( italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) shaped like a Mexican hat, with zero value at the center, but there is a ring of minima corresponding to a value |ϕ|2=ϕ12+ϕ22>0superscriptitalic-ϕ2superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ12superscriptsubscriptitalic-ϕ220|\\phi|^{2}=\\phi_{1}^{2}+\\phi_{2}^{2}>0| italic_ϕ | start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_ϕ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT > 0, as illustrated in Figure 11. This “vacuum expectation value” takes on the role of the electron’s mass that the model needs (up to a coefficient), Me∝|ϕ|proportional-tosubscript𝑀𝑒italic-ϕM_{e}\\propto|\\phi|italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∝ | italic_ϕ |, and similarly, the masses MWsubscript𝑀𝑊M_{W}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_W end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and MZsubscript𝑀𝑍M_{Z}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are obtained, all in agreement with gauge symmetry (we will return to this point).\n\nIt seems all fine, but there is still another problem, and this is the point that Coleman referred to in his comment on Higgs’ seminar at Harvard, which we quoted in Section 1. The Mexican hat potential has a symmetry under rotations about the central axis. We assume the field ϕitalic-ϕ\\phiitalic_ϕ to choose one of the minima: the process of this choice is denoted as “spontaneous symmetry breaking”: from the perspective of a specific minimum, the rotation symmetry is no longer apparent. In Ref. [22], we described this process with the analogy of the Buridan’s Donkey, which is thirsty and surrounded by a water trough but has to decide which direction to walk in order to drink water.\n\nSmall fluctuations of the field beyond its minimum state correspond to particles. If a fluctuation is radial, it costs energy because the potential rises – this is a massive particle (the curvature of the potential in the radial direction corresponds to its mass squared). On the other hand, a tangential fluctuation does not require any energy, as the field stays at its energy minimum. This is an example of a massless particle, known as a Nambu-Goldstone boson [25, 26]. According to the Goldstone Theorem [27], these bosons appear when a continuous symmetry (such as rotation in this example) is spontaneously broken.\n\nIf the mechanism works as described above, the question remains: where is this Nambu-Goldstone boson? Being massless, it should play a relevant role and dominate physics at low energies (where very heavy particles are not visible). But no particle of this kind has been observed. So, to justify the mechanism, one has to “get around the Goldstone Theorem”, as Coleman put it, but the physicists at Harvard doubted whether this was possible. They were not alone; for example, Klaus Hepp, a prominent mathematical physicist, warned Higgs that this might not work because the Theorem was proven using C∗ algebra, a formalism that Higgs was not familiar with, but he expressed doubts about the assumptions in this proof [2].\n\nWe now know that the Theorem is indeed correct, but it only refers to the breaking of a global continuous symmetry – this assumption was hidden. The crucial observation was that the situation is different in the case of a local symmetry: in this case, the minima are connected by local transformations, or gauge transformations, thus they are physically identical. So there are no physical fluctuations between the minima, and there are no Nambu-Goldstone bosons. What happens – and this completes the Higgs mechanism – is that the gauge boson acquires mass, meaning that the degree of freedom of the Nambu-Goldstone boson turns into the longitudinal degree of freedom of the gauge boson (without mass, it only has transverse degrees of freedom). In popular language, it is said that the gauge boson “eats up” the Nambu-Goldstone boson: the latter is no longer there, but the former becomes “fat”.\n\nThis had been observed by Anderson before in a typical superconductor: inside it, at very low temperature, the photon acquires mass, hence it can hardly penetrate the superconductor – a phenomenon known as the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect. Brout, Englert, and Higgs extended this effect to relativistic models [3, 1], and Weinberg and Salam to the phenomenology of electroweak interaction [9, 10]. We mentioned that the Higgs field has 4 real components: there is always one massive radial fluctuation, and thus 3 Nambu-Goldstone bosons if we are dealing with a global symmetry. When it is promoted to a local symmetry, the bosons W+superscript𝑊W^{+}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, W−superscript𝑊W^{-}italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, and Z0superscript𝑍0Z^{0}italic_Z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT “eat up” these Nambu-Goldstone bosons and acquire masses, while the photon remains massless (under normal circumstances) and describes long-range electromagnetism.\n\nWe have seen that the mechanism also provides a mass to the electron, and it similarly applies to the muon, tauon, and all the quarks. And what about the Higgs field? We know that 3 of its 4 components would be Nambu-Goldstone bosons that disappear, but the fourth component remains, corresponding to the radial fluctuation, i.e., to a massive particle. Its existence is a prediction of the Higgs mechanism, and in this respect, the second article by Higgs from 1964 was somewhat more explicit than the other original works. This was still in the context of toy models, but once applied to a phenomenological model, one concluded that such a Higgs particle has to be observable.\n\nThe theory does not predict the mass of the Higgs particle, MHsubscript𝑀HM_{\\rm H}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (only bounds could be derived, which were a topic of discussion over many years), so its experimental search was challenging. At the beginning of the 21st century, the experiments of the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN showed that it must have a mass MH>114⁢GeVsubscript𝑀H114GeVM_{\\rm H}>114\\,{\\rm GeV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 114 roman_GeV. So it was known to be very heavy (if it exists), requiring high-energy collisions for its creation. This also implies that its lifetime is very short, decaying on average in 10−22superscript102210^{-22}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 22 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT seconds, so it cannot leave traces in any detector.\n\nAn experiment has to capture the products of its decay that allow the reconstruction of the Higgs particle as an intermediate state, or “resonance” – for a very short time – in a high-energy collision. The analysis of the particles resulting at the end of the process enables the reconstruction of the Higgs particle properties, in particular its mass of MH≃125⁢GeVsimilar-to-or-equalssubscript𝑀H125GeVM_{\\rm H}\\simeq 125\\,{\\rm GeV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≃ 125 roman_GeV and its spin 0, confirming it to be a scalar particle.\n\nIn the cleanest channel observed, the decay of the Higgs particle ends with two photons, a final state that would not be possible if, for example, the original particle had spin 1, as Landau had proved [28]. But the ATLAS and CMS experiments studied (independently) many more decays in great detail – such as, for instance, with a final state of four leptons – leaving no doubt about the existence of the Higgs particle, and the corresponding mechanism.\n\nThis represents a spectacular success of elementary particle physics. Nevertheless, not everything is resolved yet. From a conceptual perspective, the hierarchy problem remains, and regarding phenomenology, the Higgs mechanism does not explain the origin of all masses we observe. We end with brief comments on these issues:\n\n•\n\nHierarchy problem: If we start with a classical system (without quantum effects) and assume a mass mH(0)superscriptsubscript𝑚H0m_{\\rm H}^{(0)}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( 0 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT on the order of masses of other particles, it is natural that quantum corrections drastically increase this mass to a value mHsubscript𝑚Hm_{\\rm H}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT on the order of the “Planck scale” (determined by the gravitational constant). But this leads to a huge mass mHsubscript𝑚Hm_{\\rm H}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, typically about 1017superscript101710^{17}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 17 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT times its observed value.\n\nOne could assume an extremely negative value of mH(0)superscriptsubscript𝑚H0m_{\\rm H}^{(0)}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( 0 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, so that the quantum effect is almost entirely canceled out, leaving a tiny remainder of 125 GeV. But this approach – with a cancellation between two tremendous contributions leaving a tiny remainder – does not seem natural. This is known as the “hierarchy problem”. However, it is not a paradox, one can consistently arrive at 125 GeV, and the question of how severe this problem is, is somewhat philosophical. The extent of the hierarchy gap also depends on the regularization that one applies.\n\n•\n\nNeutrinos (denoted by ν𝜈\\nuitalic_ν) play a special role: the traditional form of the Standard Model assumed them to have mass zero, Mν=0subscript𝑀𝜈0M_{\\nu}=0italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0, and only the left-handed neutrino, νLsubscript𝜈𝐿\\nu_{L}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, to exist.\n\nThis is consistent in theory, but at the end of the 20th century, it was observed that neutrinos do have a small mass, mν>0subscript𝑚𝜈0m_{\\nu}>0italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ν end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 0 – we reiterate that Ref. [20] provides a semi-popular review of the topic.\n\nAt first sight, according to our previous description, it seems inevitable that the right-handed neutrino, νRsubscript𝜈𝑅\\nu_{R}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, exists. This allows the application of the Higgs mechanism to neutrinos, and also another type of mass, only for the νRsubscript𝜈𝑅\\nu_{R}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, known as “Majorana mass”.\n\nHowever, the νRsubscript𝜈𝑅\\nu_{R}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is not observed, and its existence is not truly inevitable: we can construct a mass term involving only the νLsubscript𝜈𝐿\\nu_{L}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT field [30]. This term is non-renormalizable, but we mentioned in Section 1 that the importance given to of this property is diminished. So this scenario would be the alternative, within the framework of the Standard Model interpreted as an effective theory that works in a certain energy range.\n\n•\n\nUp to this point, the Higgs mechanism explains the masses of elementary particles (with the possible exception of neutrinos), and there are other particles like the photon that remain massless. It seems like a complete picture of the origin of mass.\n\nHowever, the real world is different: in reality, the mass of a macroscopic object in our everyday life originates only to 1⁢…⁢2%1…percent21\\dots 2\\,\\%1 … 2 % from the Higgs mechanism, which leads to the masses of quarks.\n\nThese everyday masses consist mainly of nucleon masses (protons and neutrons), which essentially consist of energy from gluons (other gauge particles, which transmit the strong interaction): they have zero mass, but are confined inside a nucleon (or another particle composed by the strong interaction). Their energy manifests as almost the entire mass of the nucleon, while the masses of quarks only provide the aforementioned contribution of ∼1⁢…⁢2%similar-toabsent1…percent2\\sim 1\\dots 2\\,\\%∼ 1 … 2 %.\n\nThe interior of a nucleon is a very, very complex system, for a long time it seemed impossible to calculate anything conclusive about it. However, a little over a decade ago, it became possible to compute, for example, the mass of the nucleon, MN≃939⁢MeVsimilar-to-or-equalssubscript𝑀𝑁939MeVM_{N}\\simeq 939\\,{\\rm MeV}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≃ 939 roman_MeV, from first principles, up to an uncertainty of the order of 1 %. This calculation captures the hyper-complicated mess of gluons (and “sea quarks”, unstable pairs of a quark and its anti-quark), and the result is compatible with experiments. The question of how these calculations are possible would be a topic for another article ……\\dots…\n\nAcknowledgments: We thank Yeslaine Hernández-Hernández, Víctor Muñoz-Vitelly and Jaime Fabián Nieto Castellanos for reading the manuscript.
