        "text": "Prof Peter Higgs, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, has died at the age of 94.\n\nProf Higgs worked on subatomic particles in the 1960s and theorised the existence of a particle that was essential in keeping the fabric of the universe together by giving other particles mass.\n\nScientists working at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, used the Large Hadron Collider to prove his theory correct almost 50 years later.\n\nThe 2012 proof of the existence of the boson, which was named after Prof Higgs, was a seminal moment for subatomic physics as it validated the Standard Model theory upon which the entire knowledge of the universe is built.\n\nProf Higgs, from Newcastle, won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Physics alongside Francois Englert for his work, which found that a particle, now the eponymous boson, was the one responsible for giving all other particles mass.\n\nThis essential role of creating mass, done in conjunction with the Higgs field, allows for the creation and function of the universe as we know it, from planets and stars to entire galaxies.\n\nIt can not be easily found and needs to be created by smashing particles together at almost the speed of light. However, the ethereal particle decays almost instantly and is hard to detect.\n\nIt can only be created in around one in a billion collisions at CERN and the detectors had to accurately find the particle, which had a spin of zero – a unique trait and a telltale sign of the Higgs boson.\n\nThe evidence of the existence of the Higgs boson allowed scientists to confidently work from the bedrock provided by the Standard Model and is a central dogma in all forms of physics, from quantum mechanics to astrophysics, to this day.\n\nHiggs, whose father was an BBC sound engineer, was a publicity-shy individual who hid in his local pub in Edinburgh on the day of the Nobel announcement so that the Nobel committee would not be able to find him.\n\nEdinburgh University said in a statement on Tuesday: “It has been confirmed that Prof Peter Higgs has passed away at the age of 94. He died on Monday, April 8, peacefully at home, following a short illness. His family has asked that the media and public respect their privacy at this time.”\n\nProf Sir Peter Mathieson, the university’s principal, said: “Peter Higgs was a remarkable individual – a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us.\n\n“His pioneering work has motivated thousands of scientists, and his legacy will continue to inspire many more for generations to come.”\n\n‘Inspirational and a true gentleman’\n\nParticle physicist Brian Cox, a professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester, said Prof Higgs’ name “will be remembered as long as we do physics”.\n\n“Very sorry to hear Peter Higgs has died,” the science programme presenter said posting on X.\n\n“I was fortunate enough to meet him several times, and beyond being a famous physicist - I think to his embarrassment at times - he was always charming and modest.\n\n“And of course his name will be remembered as long as we do physics in the form of the Higgs Boson. RIP Peter.”\n\nThe First Minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf said: “My thoughts are with Professor Higgs’ family, friends, colleagues and generations of students.\n\n“A visionary whose idea, and its discovery some 48 years later, is transforming our understanding of the universe.\n\n“His life and work will inspire generations of scientists to come.”\n\nOther scientists paid tribute to Prof Higgs, with Professor Joel Goldstein, from the School of Physics at the University of Bristol, calling him a “quiet and modest man” who “never seemed comfortable with the fame he achieved even though this work underpins the entire modern theoretical framework of particle physics”.\n\nAlan Barr, professor of particle physics at the University of Oxford, said: “He was also a true gentleman, humble and polite, always giving due credit to others, and gently encouraging future generations of scientists and scholars.”"
