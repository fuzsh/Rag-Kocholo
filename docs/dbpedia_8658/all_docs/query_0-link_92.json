        "text": "Peter Higgs, the University’s Emeritus Professor of Theoretical Physics, has been awarded a 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nThe prize recognises his 1964 theory of how elemental particles achieve mass, and its effect on our understanding of physics.\n\nProfessor Higgs’ theory was confirmed through the identification of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider in 2012.\n\nThe prize is shared with Professor François Englert, a retired professor at the Free University of Brussels and one of several co-authors of the theory.\n\nProfessor Higgs’ association with Edinburgh began in 1954, when he moved to the University for his second year as a Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Senior Student.\n\nIn 1960 he returned to Edinburgh from London to take up a lectureship in Mathematical Physics at the Tait Institute.\n\nHis groundbreaking 1964 paper demonstrated how elemental particles achieved mass through the existence of a new sub-atomic particle, which became known as the Higgs boson.\n\nHe was promoted to Reader in 1970, became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1974 and was promoted to a Personal Chair of Theoretical Physics in 1980.\n\nHe was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1983 and Fellow of the Institute of Physics in 1991. Professor Higgs retired in 1996.\n\nHis contribution to physics has been recognised by numerous academic honours.\n\nHe has received honorary degrees from 11 UK universities including Edinburgh (1998), Swansea (2008), Cambridge (2012), St Andrews and Manchester (2013).\n\nHis achievements have also been recognised in a major new research centre, the Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics, based at the University’s King's Buildings campus.\n\nIn the 2013 New Year Honours List he was appointed a Companion of Honour."
