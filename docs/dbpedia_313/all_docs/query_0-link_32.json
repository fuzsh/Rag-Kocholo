ON 16MM\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 17: ILSA, HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 18: MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 24: MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 25: ILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN\n\nMIDNIGHT SERIES: FEMME DOMME BABYLON, A TRIBUTE TO ILSA: THE KOMMANDANT, THE KADIN, AND THE WICKED WARDEN\n\nThe name Ilsa is synonymous with the image of a dominant female. Since her first appearance as the Kommandant of a “medical” camp in the controversial ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS, Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne), has gained a major cult following as one of the most notorious characters of the nazi exploitation genre. Throughout the course of her “lifetime”, Ilsa has been everything from a harem keeper to a warden at a womens’ prison. Legions of her fans have plastered her image in everything from songs to S&M club flyers. The first film in the series was so popular that it won an AVN award and ushered in a series of sequels, one of which was directed by the legendary Jesus Franco. This midnight series brings together three of the greatest Ilsa films. All hail the Kommandant!\n\nILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS\n\nDir. Don Edmonds, 1975\n\nUSA, 96 min.\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 3 – MIDNIGHT\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 17 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“You are strong, stronger than HE.”\n\nThe period between 1974-1978 was the golden age of Nazi exploitation. Films such as SALON KITTY, THE NIGHT PORTER, RED NIGHTS OF THE GESTAPO and more were very popular across Europe and North America. Nazi exploitation is a type of exploitation film that explores the subject of Nazi cruelty during WW2. These films were usually highly sexualized, highly fetishistic, and rampant with sadomasochistic themes. The majority of Nazi exploitation films were made in Italy, but some were made in France and the United States.\n\nOne of the most notorious Nazi exploitation films is ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS. Whereas its other counterparts had story-lines that were considered to be more “historical accurate”, ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS is considered to be rooted in pure fantasy. The film is said to be based on a combination of the life of Ilsa Koch, the wife of a concentration commander, and Stalag novels. Stalag novels were a popular type of pulp novel in Israel during the 50s and 60s that depicted sadomasochistic episodes between men and female members of the SS. Over the years the film has generated a lot of controversy due to its subject matter. Despite the controversy, the film has a huge cult following mainly due to the image of female dominance that Ilsa represents. To fetishist Ilsa is the ultimate goddess that they want to worship and worship they do in countless S&M clubs where Ilsa’s infamous uniform is popular attire with Dominatrixes. To feminists Ilsa is a symbol of a strong woman holding a typically male dominated role. Actually, the theme of “proving” herself to be just as good as any man at her job is a theme that is explored in several of the Ilsa films. Ilsa is a despicable villain to some, a hero to others, but one thing is for sure, she stands as a dominant, confident woman who is out to prove that not only can women easily hold typically male dominated roles, but they are in fact better than men. This is why the film is such a rarity in the Nazi exploitation genre and why some 40 years after its release it is still being talked about by such diverse groups of individuals.\n\nIlsa (Dyanne Thorne), is the Kommandant of Camp 9, a 3rd Reich “medical” camp tasked to sterilize women. During the day Ilsa works on various “experiments” to help with the German war effort. Her nights are spent with the company of male prisoners who she uses to try to satisfy her sexual desires. Ilsa seeks to advance her career and ranking in the 3rd Reich by working on a side “experiment”, an “experiment” that she believes will help Germany win the war. She wants to prove that “the carefully trained woman can withstand pain better than any man”. A theory which her male superiors take as a joke. All she needs is a subject to prove her theory, enter prisoner 332 aka Anna, the subject Ilsa has been looking for all along, a woman who does not fear pain. Will Ilsa break Anna? Will Anna prove Ilsa’s theory or will she bring about the downfall of the Kommandant?\n\nILSA, HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS\n\nDir. Don Edmonds, 1976\n\nUnited States, 87 min.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 4 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“Welcome to my company of eunuchs!”\n\nSheik El Sharif is a powerful man. What makes El Sharif so powerful you say? He owns land that is capable of producing millions of gallons of oil! Yet Sheik Sharif is only interested in extracting as little oil as he can. Enter Dr. Kaiser and Commander Adam Scott from the USA! They are looking to employ some “personal diplomacy” aka black mail to get El Sharif to produce more oil. What they didn’t count on was ILSA! After bidding farewell to the Fatherland, Ilsa fled to Arabia where she found a new job as a harem keeper and advisor aka Kadin to Sheik El Sharif. Ilsa along with her henchwomen Satin and Velvet, do everything from spying on foreign powers to training the women of the harem on how to use their tongues. What will Ilsa do to the Americans? Will she remain loyal to El Sharif or will she use this opportunity to usurp his kingdom?\n\nILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN\n\naka Greta, The Mad Butcher\n\nDir. Jesus Franco, 1977\n\nUnited States, 90 min.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 25 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“You know her wound is like a kiss to her body.”\n\nILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN is the prodigal daughter of the Ilsa series. Originally, the film was not meant to be part of the series at all, but due to the popularity of the first three films, the producers took a film named GRETA, THE MAD BUTCHER and changed the title to ILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN. ILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN was directed by the legendary Jesus Franco and co-stars his wife and lifetime collaborator Lina Romay as Ilsa’s lover/informant/patient. WICKED WARDEN has a plot that is very similar to the other Ilsa films so it fits perfectly with the rest of the series. What makes it unique is that for the first time in the series Ilsa holds a position of absolute power. Ilsa’s “mental health clinic” is for women and run by a woman. Finally, Ilsa got the position she wanted and deserved.\n\nAmy Phillips is desperately searching for answers in the death of her sister Rosa Phillips. Rosa was committed to Las Palomas, a clinic for the treatment of sexually deviant behavior in women, and died under mysterious circumstances. Amy enlists the help of her friend Dr. Arcos to get herself checked into the clinic under false pretenses so that she can investigate Rosa’s death. Unbeknownst to Amy the Las Palomas clinic is run by none other than Ilsa aka Dr. Greta! Dr. Greta is an expert at treating everything from sexual to political deviations. She uses a combination of electro-shock therapy, a leather whip, and the help of Juanna, her lover/patient, to keep her patients on the “right” path. Will Dr. Greta become wise to Amy’s plot? Will Amy ever find out what became of her sister?\n\nTWO THOUSAND MANIACS!\n\nDir. Hershell Gordon Lewis, 1964\n\nThe Southern United States, 87 min.\n\n16mm Print Courtesy of Brian Darwas\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 11 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“This centennial is a centennial of blood vengeance!”\n\n“YEEEEEEEEE-hooooo! / Oh the South’s gonna rise again!”\n\n“There’s a story you should know from 100 years ago,” begins the infectious, self-penned title song to Herschell Gordon Lewis’s TWO THOUSAND MANIACS!—which turned 50 last year. In fact, this April 12 marks the exact 150th anniversary of the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter, which ignited one of the bloodiest chapters in American history: The Civil War.\n\nSo to that end, as the clock strikes midnight on Saturday, April 11, we’ll screen one of the bloodiest chapters in cinematic history: TWO THOUSAND MANIACS!, HGL’s outrageously bonkers and indescribably gory 1964 trashterpiece about bloodthirsty southern rednecks unleashing Hell on unsuspecting passersby during the centennial commemoration of their town’s destruction by Union forces. The Yankee tourists, while initially charmed by the kind hospitality of their hosts, soon find themselves maimed and dismembered one-by-one through a series of cartoonish grand guignol games including live barbecuing, drawn-and-quartering by horses, and nail-filled barrel rolls. Will any of them survive the nightmare?\n\nThough unabashedly lurid, grotesque, irreverent, and exploitational, TWO THOUSAND MANIACS! is one of the most compelling historical revisionist fantasies about the Civil War ever filmed, acknowledging the deep wounds, cultural rift and racial tensions that still existed one hundred years after the fact—and persist to this day. Unlike recent films like DJANGO UNCHAINED or TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE, racial violence is not depicted, and yet the evil racial underpinning of the white-on-white violence is clearly understood. There is also the difference that this film’s resolution leaves little catharsis or reassurance that this evil has been in any way defeated.\n\nIn the spirit of conservative values, we’ll forgo high definition projection in favor of sterling 16mm, the people’s film format, based on photocehmical technology that dates to approximately the same time as the Civil War, the first major conflict to be extensively photographed. Rise again!\n\nMILL OF THE STONE WOMEN\n\nDir. Giorgio Ferroni, 1960\n\nItaly, 90 min.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 18 – MIDNIGHT\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 24 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“All I wanted to do was go on dreaming I wanted the dream to continue I never want it to end.”\n\nThe 60s brought about the resurrection of all things “Gothic” in Horror Cinema.\n\nWhereas many films from the decade looked toward to the future, “Gothic” films reminisced about a torturous past. Gothic Horror is typified by old stately mansions, haunted corridors, torture devices straight out of the crusades, phantasmagoric dream sequences, and phantoms galore. The Gothic style was like a cinematic plague that spread throughout Europe and North America. In the UK, Hammer Studios and Christopher Lee brought us a new vision of Dracula. In the US, Roger Corman and Vincent Price were resurrecting the tales of Edgar Allan Poe to much fanfare. In Italy, Mario Bava and Barbara Steele were haunting every corridor with elaborate optical illusions and spiderwebs galore.\n\nWhich brings us to Italy’s own Giorgio Ferroni who directed the gorgeous film MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN. MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN centers around a young man named Hans who is tasked to assist in writing a piece about the centennial of a waxwork carousel that features statues based on murderesses, martyrs, and queens aka “The Stone Women”. Hans is sent to the studio of Professor Wahl, the grandson of the carousel’s creator, to gather information about the history of the carousel . In true “Gothic” fashion Professor Wahl’s studio just happens to be a labyrinthian windmill near a cemetery. While working at the studio Hans is distracted by the attentions Professor Wahl’s daughter Elfy, a statuesque young lady who suffers from a strange disease that keeps her from leaving the windmill. Also completing for Hans’s attentions is Lisa Lotter, Hans’s childhood friend who is a student of Professor Wahl. Strange things begin to happen as Hans starts hearing screams coming from basement of the windmill and some of his friends begin to disappear, including the lovely Lisa Lotter. Who is behind these disappearances? Has Elfy’s love for Hans turned into madness or is Professor Wahl hiding a dark secret in the windmill?\n\nMILL OF THE STONE WOMEN is a beautiful film. One of the things that makes the film so alluring is its usage of color. The usage of the color red throughout the film is like a nod to the “gore” films of the era. The interior of the windmill is a dark foreboding red. The roses Elfy leaves for Hans are a rich bright blood red that appear as though any minute they would begin to drip. The reds are rivaled by the usage of sickly jaundice-like yellows that are scattered throughout the film in the form of flowers and gowns. This film is truly a feast for the eyes and essential viewing for fans of Gothic horror.\n\nONE WEEK ONLY! APRIL 9 – 15 – Filmmaker in attendance at most screenings!\n\nThis April, Spectacle is pleased to present the first retrospective of film and video artist James Fotopoulos in over a decade—an eternity relative the supernatural profligacy of Fotopoulos’s label-defying output. Perhaps no other moviemaker so categorically denies compartmentalization, falsifying dichotomies of underground and art film, narrative and abstraction, and black box and white cube, while unabashedly appropriating, celebrating, and upturning the conventions of the horror, sci-fi, hardboiled, and melodramatic genres.\n\nFor this retrospective, which only scratches the surface of Fotopoulos’s filmography, we focus primarily on narrative work, including all five of his feature-length 16mm films, four hybrid-narrative videos, and the four-part back-and-forth 16mm/video feature CHRISTABEL, included in the 2004 Whitney Biennial yet unseen in its original formats since its 2001 premiere. Peppered throughout in night-at-the-movies style we’ll also showcase various shorts programmed alongside features and other bits of audiovisual mood-enhancing odds-and-ends.\n\nOrganized in close collaboration with the artist, the series features personal film prints and brand-new video transfers made directly from the masters. Skewing toward early works, it comes on the heels of a solo show at Microscope Gallery, which included the premieres of recent works THE GIVEN (2015) and THERE (2014). Along with DIGNITY (2012), a feature that premiered at Spectacle last year, they represent a sort of full-circle return to the formal approaches of the early films in this retrospective.\n\nThis retrospective is also preceded by a selection of feature-length abstract works presented at Millennium Film Workshop on April 2. Details on show here.\n\nSpecial thanks to The Film-Makers’ Cooperative and Rebecca Cleman.\n\nZERO\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 1997\n\nUSA, 142 min. 16mm.\n\nScreening on 16mm for the first time in New York since its premiere!\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 9 – 8:00 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\nMade when the director was still in his teens, ZERO is a highly disturbing (and deadpan hilarious) portrait of a mentally unhinged loser biding his time shitting, unravelling, ranting, and sharing moments of tenderness with a mannequin head, his only friend and lover. Placed throughout are highly affecting and evocative sequences of toned, hand-painted imagery and highly unconventional film processing representing death, disease, decay, and sex, and pastoral interludes that suggest a state of mental tranquility that’s already too far gone.\n\nThe director describes ZERO as a “a two-and-a-half-hour endurance test,” but for better or worse, that might be an overstatement: ZERO is as hideous as it is riveting in its rhythm and pacing. Yet it is by no stretch appropriate for the easily offended.\n\nZERO has been essentially unseen—and not shown at all on 16mm—in New York since it’s sparsely attended premiere. This is an unmissable chance to catch one of Fotopoulos’s most important yet rarely seen films.\n\nMIGRATING FORMS\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 1999\n\nUSA, 80 min. 16mm.\n\nScreening on 16mm!\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 10 – 7:30 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 10 – MIDNIGHT – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 15 – 10:00 PM\n\n“A kind of stripped down ERASERHEAD … MIGRATING FORMS has a formal purity and obsessive power that’s all too rare these days.” –Amy Taubin, Village Voice\n\nA movie about a man, a woman, and a room in which they habitually engage in deeply uneasy coitus—sex both rote and fever-pitched, which seems somehow motivated by the paradoxically repulsive and magnetic draw of a phallic tumor extruding from the woman’s back. It’s a pulverizingly minimalist masterpiece of finely-tuned anxiety.\n\nMIGRATING FORMS justly earns comparison to David Cronenberg for its psychosomatic representation of disease and body horror, as well as the uncanniness of the banality in the work of David Lynch. But, particularly in light of Fotopoulos’ subsequent profusion of work, one might also draw comparisons to ceaselessly prolific trash-row auteurs like Joseph Sarno and Andy Milligan, in comparison to whom the arthouse, experimental cinema, and gallery is Fotopoulos’s 42nd Street. For some, the greatest virtue of sexploitation is its hypnotic, drone-like banality, which is here consciously perverted into avant-garde extremes. It’s often said that as the exploitation film dried up its techniques of sensationalism and salesmanship were assimilated by Hollywood; it’s less often noted that, removed from any established market—this is the tail-end of the decade that saw the sanitization of Times Square—the weirdness of marginal cinema truly broods in uncompromising movies like MIGRATING FORMS.\n\nMIGRATING FORMS literally redefined the underground. It was a sensation at its New York premiere, with Amy Taubin writing that “[MIGRATING FORMS] alone gives the Underground Film Festival a reason for being.” The statement was prophetic: in 2008 the name of the festival was changed accordingly to reflect the kind of protean, hybrid, relentlessly unclassifiable cinema Fotopoulos had ushered in.\n\nBACK AGAINST THE WALL\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 2000\n\nUSA, 94 min. 16mm.\n\nScreening on 16mm!\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 10 – 10:00 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 15 – 7:30 PM\n\n“The term ‘noir’ only begins to describe the malignant atmosphere that seeps like a poison gas through James Fotopoulos’s grimy, clanging film.” –Stephen Holden, The New York Times\n\nBack Against the Wall presents an atmosphere of ever-increasing doom, as a woman named June seems to engage in a grotesque personal experiment that involves hitching herself to defective men. Each of the film’s three chapters is devoted to one of them; Levey is a speed-reading rage freak prone to seizures and melancholy, pornographer or pimp Vince is friendlier but his professional contacts keep knocking out his teeth, and finally we encounter Ed, a truly singular creation who is stricken with a terminal disease and spends long moments whispering nonsense. The backdrop is a menacing and featureless Middle America with its shitty drugs, prefab motel rooms and mediocre towns. A generic mud-stained farmhouse is the depressing setting for a porno shoot where June and other women dress up as a sexy cowgirl, a sexy cow and a sexy child holding a teddy bear, respectively.\n\nThe film’s sorrows are particular and finely tuned, focusing on the impending stage of all sorts of disasters we can only imagine, with incredible grace and humor in long silences, grim non sequiturs and a surreal air of decay.\n\nCHRISTABEL\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 2001\n\nUSA, 74 min. 16mm/video.\n\nScreening for the first time since its premiere in its original alternating 16mm/video back-and-forth format!\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 11 – 7:30 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\n“Christabel is an abstract interpretation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s unfinished Gothic poem about female possession. Adhering to the poem’s structure the film is presented in four parts – Two digital video half hour segments and then two short 16mm conclusions. The contemporary relevance of the poem’s symbols and themes is underlined using performance combined with heavy image and sound layering.” —JF\n\nFAMILIES\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 2002\n\nUSA, 97 min. 16mm.\n\nScreening on 16mm!\n\nSUNDAY, APRIL 12 – 7:30 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\n“The experience of this rich film is a completely unique mix of alienation and empathy, horror and bemusement—it should go in the time capsule, as a token of life on earth at the turn of the millennium.” —Rebecca Cleman, Screen Slate\n\nA hybrid film that intentionally clashes techniques and syntaxes, FAMILIES is a series docufictional vignettes in a rural industrial town as portrayed through Fotopoulous’ singular eye.\n\n“Life in a rural industrial town: a teenage boy, his family, friends and failed attempt at love are investigated through stark black-and-white photography and static long takes. Filmed in a fusion of authentic and staged documentation, with robotic performances by actors and non-actors, the piece meditates on the mundane existence of human and animal life.” —JF\n\nHYMN\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 2002\n\nUSA, 90 min. Video.\n\nMONDAY, APRIL 13 – 7:30 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\n“A digital poem of the flesh unfolding in near mathematical structural precision.” HYMN borders upon abstraction, voyeurism, and pornography, presenting digitally processed video of copulation interpolated with flicker, painting, sound, and sculpture. Bathed in teal hues and uncanny glimmers, HYMN is one of Fotopoulos’s most hypnotic and seductive works. It also speaks latently to pre-broadband Internet sex culture, based as it is upon footage commissioned from Fotopoulos by a teenage couple who had discovered his work online and invited him to film them as part of a tape-trading ring.\n\nTHE NEST\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 2003\n\nUSA, 78 min. 16mm.\n\nScreening on 16mm!\n\nSUNDAY, APRIL 12 – 10:00 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\n“THE NEST suggests that other great suburban tract of the ‘80s, Don DeLillo’s WHITE NOISE, but rather than being about a toxic airborne event, THE NEST simply is one.” —Spencer Parsons, Cinematexas\n\n“Filmed in saturated colors on out-of-date film stocks with an aggressive soundtrack, the story of The Nest is told – The marriage of two young professionals unravels after an unnamed accident physically and emotional traumatizes the wife. Government agents, shadowy investigators and transgender beings appear, trying to solve the nervous-breakdown-mystery of secret alien forces that chose the couple as their target. In-camera tricks, drawings, derelict optical printing, miniatures, puppets and prosthetic makeup effects convey the dual collapse of the protagonists’ lives and the film structure as one unified entity.” —JF\n\nESOPHAGUS\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 2004\n\nUSA, 70 min. Video.\n\nMONDAY, APRIL 13 – 10:00 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\n“The origins of the universe told through the lens of an experimental film and video sci-fi horror-show fusion: Alien women trapped in a colorfully hand-scratched film-textured hotel room, genetically mutated men slowly driven mad in a white digital prison, the high contrast landscapes of Mars, and a futuristic tribe of a giant, an elf and a witch in their decaying suicide-home.” —JF\n\nOn the bleeding edge of narrative, abstraction, and pure experimentation, ESOPHAGUS is a hypnotic multi-part film/video hybrid. In the beginning, rhythmic, undulating pulses of color give way to scratched images of lovemaking. In amateurish digital video, a group of imprisoned men are driven mad by repetitious digital computer voices. The computer vocals continue in a profane, sing-songy back-and-forth over images of a dark elf and witch before the pair depart for Mars, bringing the narrative full circle into a brooding digital soup.\n\nTHE ANT HILL\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 2004\n\nUSA, 60 min. Video.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 11 – 10:00 PM – Filmmaker in attendance!\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 14 – 10:00 PM\n\n“At the center of this video, one of Chicagoan James Fotopoulos’s strongest works, is a cult founded by a man who says he’s obeying instructions from a forest apparition. The sparse narrative follows the usual cult arc—the leader requires obedience, the followers perform revolting tasks (most, thankfully, offscreen), and two plan an escape. But this is less realistic storytelling than contemplative satire—the leader wears a hokey beard and crown, and the actors speak like automatons. In a prologue the leader writhes nude, almost epileptic, alongside a woman, suggesting Fotopoulos’s key theme: our bodies, and existence itself, are the real traps.” —Fred Camper, The Chicago Reader\n\n“When a cult leader’s vision of the end of the world is not fulfilled he beings the systematic humiliation and destruction of his followers. The derelict play unfolds on a barren stage with bursts of animation, field recordings of sound, alien creatures and dime store costumes – a high school production aesthetic of the most extreme nature.” —JF\n\nTHE SKY SONG\n\nDir. James Fotopoulos, 2007\n\nUSA, 127 min. Video.\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 14 – 7:30 PM\n\nRemember your suspicion that the Microsoft Paperclip and your 56k modem were agents of Interzone working in tandem to surveil our collective dreams? In 2007, Fotopoulos unearthed one of their communiques and refashioned it as THE SKY SONG, an unsettling Western melodrama submerged in a seething vat of pixelated noise.\n\nAccording to Fotopoulos, the film concerns a “quest for revenge” that takes a man “on a journey to reconcile the horrors of his past — illness, murder, lost love and war.” Ostensibly accurate, that synopsis does little to prepare viewers for the phantasmagoric succession of video effects or the comically flatlined dialogue that orbit some obscure truths about our fixation with the old west. A wry digital primitive, Fotopoulos costumes his actors in K-Mart halloween kitsch and surrounds them with graphics sketched in MS Paint. The resulting work lashes against your nerves before summoning sounds and images of sublime surreality.\n\nStripped of all majesty, this is where the Western belongs in the 21st century: reduced, exploded and crudely refabricated.\n\nLast month’s JUCHE YOUR ILLUSION I surveyed films made in North Korea. For the second part of the series, Spectacle presents three films about North Korea made by filmmakers outside the country.\n\nNorth Korea’s seclusion results in a peculiar dichotomy; films emerging from within reflect a disconnectedness from the outside world, while works about North Korea made elsewhere must contend with the country’s deliberate attempts at obfuscation. These films largely rely upon brief glimpses, piecemeal second-hand information and, paradoxically, North Korea’s own propaganda, which outside filmmakers parse according to, or in spite of, their own subjectivity. Cinema from each side, generally oppositional to the other and informed by respective biases, can obscure as much as it reveals. It can also serve as a useful reminder of our own subjectivity vis a vis the more familiar propaganda inherent in our own domestic art and discourse.\n\nThe films in JUCHE YOUR ILLUSION II both reinforce and undermine the portrait of North Korea presented in the first part of the series. JUCHE II includes a work completely indebted to propaganda (in which upstate NY stands in for NK); a meticulously redesigned vacation video by a French tourist; and the video diary of a woman conflicted by her own familial ties to North Korea.\n\nDEAR PYONGYANG\n\nDir. Yonghi Yang, 2005\n\nJapan, 107 min.\n\nIn Korean and Japanese with English subtitles\n\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 1 – 10 PM\n\nMONDAY, APRIL 6 – 7:30 PM\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 24 – 7:30 PM\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 28 – 7:30 PM\n\nYonghi Yang is one of nearly a million zainichi, Koreans living in Japan. Beginning in 1959 and lasting 20 years, many zainichi, even of South Korean nationality, left Japan for North Korea as part of a widespread repatriation movement inspired by North Korea’s economic growth and the promise of Korean reunification. These returnees have never been allowed to leave.\n\nThree of those who went were Yang’s brothers, sent in the 1970s by their father, the leader of the pro-North movement in Japan. Yang documents several family trips to Pyongyang to visit her brothers, now grown and with families of their own, who survive in large part due to supplies shipped to them from Japan by their parents, who remained there along with Yang. Despite his sons’ poor living standards, Yang’s father remains staunchly loyal to North Korea, an ideological dilemma for Yang, who struggles to comprehend why her father broke apart his family and wishes to officially change her nationality to South Korea. Though he reproaches his daughter for what he considers her disloyalty to his life’s work, over the ten-year filming period, his steadfastness gives way to indications of regret and a willingness to compromise.\n\nDEAR PYONGYANG received prizes at Berlin and Sundance and is at once an intimate portrait of a family divided by borders and ideology, a rare firsthand glimpse into daily life in North Korea’s capital and an unflinching meditation on the long shadow cast by Korea’s tragic past.\n\nThanks to Tidepoint Pictures\n\nINTERNATIONAL TOURISM\n\naka Tourisme International\n\nDir. Marie Voignier\n\nFrance, 48 min.\n\nNo dialogue; English intertitles\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 4 – 7:30 PM\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 7 – 10 PM\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 18 – 7:30 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 22 – 10 PM\n\nHow does a dictatorship exhibit itself to the tourists visiting it? What kind of narration, actors, and staging does it summon? INTERNATIONAL TOURISM has been shot as a recording of a show on the scale of a whole country, North Korea. Museums, painters’ studios, cinema production houses, or a chemical factory are presented to us by North Korean guides whose voices we never hear—for the film has been completely dubbed in at the editing stage in order to create anew a sonorous universe completely disconnected from the official discourses: all sounds have been rerecorded in order to restore the density of spaces, the murmur of tourists, the gestures of the guides, with the exception of the voices. The guides do speak, but we never hear them, and paradoxically, this muteness reveals in a better, enfolded way the coercion of the regime on the spaces and the bodies.\n\nThe journey is interspersed with title cards, in which we learn that the President himself is concerned with every detail, that painting seems to replace photography, that all movies are overdubbed for fear of any excess. The film questions the way the nation fabricates its images, between politics, mythology and imagination. Amidst this confrontation between the images of power and the gaze of tourists, we perceive the silent choreography of the touristic guides—those rigid but gracious actors of a country in perpetual self-representation.\n\nCourtesy of Marie Voignier\n\nTHE JUCHE IDEA\n\nDir. Jim Finn\n\nUSA, 62 min.\n\nIn Korean and English with English subtitles\n\nSUNDAY, APRIL 5 – 5 PM\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 21 – 10 PM\n\nSUNDAY, APRIL 26 – 5 PM\n\nYoon Jung, a South Korean video artist, moves to a collective farm & artist colony in North Korea with the hope of revitalizing Juche cinema for the 21st century. Jim Finn’s ingenious satire THE JUCHE IDEA is told through interviews with Yoon Jung at work on the farm (actually upstate NY), the films she makes as part of her residency (“The Tiny Dentures of Imperialism”, “English as a Socialist Language”), and a sampling of real North Korean propaganda and state-sanctioned films set against quotes from Kim Jong-il’s “On the Art of Cinema.”\n\nTHE JUCHE IDEA, one of Finn’s “utopian comedies,” and the final part of his Communist Trilogy, is a wildly inventive and experimental hybrid of mockumentary, satire, agitprop, science fiction and reality, which mocks and illuminates the concept of Juche and the cult of personality surrounding Kim Jong-il, while slyly pointing the finger at capitalism and America, itself a peculiar country in which movie stars, not film theorists, become beloved leaders.\n\nThe name Ilsa is synonymous with the image of a dominant female. Since her first appearance as the Kommandant of a “medical” camp in the controversial ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS, Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne), has gained a major cult following as one of the most notorious characters of the nazi exploitation genre. Throughout the course of her “lifetime”, Ilsa has been everything from a harem keeper to a warden at a womens’ prison. Legions of her fans have plastered her image in everything from songs to S&M club flyers. The first film in the series was so popular that it won an AVN award and ushered in a series of sequels, one of which was directed by the legendary Jesus Franco. This midnight series brings together three of the greatest Ilsa films. All hail the Kommandant!\n\nILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS\n\nDir. Don Edmonds, 1975\n\nUSA, 96 min.\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 3 – MIDNIGHT\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 17 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“You are strong, stronger than HE”\n\nThe period between 1974-1978 was the golden age of Nazi exploitation. Films such as SALON KITTY, THE NIGHT PORTER, RED NIGHTS OF THE GESTAPO and more were very popular across Europe and North America. Nazi exploitation is a type of exploitation film that explores the subject of Nazi cruelty during WW2. These films were usually highly sexualized, highly fetishistic, and rampant with sadomasochistic themes. The majority of Nazi exploitation films were made in Italy, but some were made in France and the United States.\n\nOne of the most notorious Nazi exploitation films is ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS. Whereas its other counterparts had story-lines that were considered to be more “historical accurate”, ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS is considered to be rooted in pure fantasy. The film is said to be based on a combination of the life of Ilsa Koch, the wife of a concentration commander, and Stalag novels. Stalag novels were a popular type of pulp novel in Israel during the 50s and 60s that depicted sadomasochistic episodes between men and female members of the SS. Over the years the film has generated a lot of controversy due to its subject matter. Despite the controversy, the film has a huge cult following mainly due to the image of female dominance that Ilsa represents. To fetishist Ilsa is the ultimate goddess that they want to worship and worship they do in countless S&M clubs where Ilsa’s infamous uniform is popular attire with Dominatrixes. To feminists Ilsa is a symbol of a strong woman holding a typically male dominated role. Actually, the theme of “proving” herself to be just as good as any man at her job is a theme that is explored in several of the Ilsa films. Ilsa is a despicable villain to some, a hero to others, but one thing is for sure, she stands as a dominant, confident woman who is out to prove that not only can women easily hold typically male dominated roles, but they are in fact better than men. This is why the film is such a rarity in the Nazi exploitation genre and why some 40 years after its release it is still being talked about by such diverse groups of individuals.\n\nIlsa (Dyanne Thorne), is the Kommandant of Camp 9, a 3rd Reich “medical” camp tasked to sterilize women. During the day Ilsa works on various “experiments” to help with the German war effort. Her nights are spent with the company of male prisoners who she uses to try to satisfy her sexual desires. Ilsa seeks to advance her career and ranking in the 3rd Reich by working on a side “experiment”, an “experiment” that she believes will help Germany win the war. She wants to prove that “the carefully trained woman can withstand pain better than any man”. A theory which her male superiors take as a joke. All she needs is a subject to prove her theory, enter prisoner 332 aka Anna, the subject Ilsa has been looking for all along, a woman who does not fear pain. Will Ilsa break Anna? Will Anna prove Ilsa’s theory or will she bring about the downfall of the Kommandant?\n\nILSA, HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS\n\nDir. Don Edmonds, 1976\n\nUnited States, 87 min.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 4 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“Welcome to my company of eunuchs!”\n\nSheik El Sharif is a powerful man. What makes El Sharif so powerful you say? He owns land that is capable of producing millions of gallons of oil! Yet Sheik Sharif is only interested in extracting as little oil as he can. Enter Dr. Kaiser and Commander Adam Scott from the USA! They are looking to employ some “personal diplomacy” aka black mail to get El Sharif to produce more oil. What they didn’t count on was ILSA! After bidding farewell to the Fatherland, Ilsa fled to Arabia where she found a new job as a harem keeper and advisor aka Kadin to Sheik El Sharif. Ilsa along with her henchwomen Satin and Velvet, do everything from spying on foreign powers to training the women of the harem on how to use their tongues. What will Ilsa do to the Americans? Will she remain loyal to El Sharif or will she use this opportunity to usurp his kingdom?\n\nILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN\n\naka Greta, The Mad Butcher\n\nDir. Jesus Franco, 1977\n\nUnited States, 90 min.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 25 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“You know her wound is like a kiss to her body.”\n\nILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN is the prodigal daughter of the Ilsa series. Originally, the film was not meant to be part of the series at all, but due to the popularity of the first three films, the producers took a film named GRETA, THE MAD BUTCHER and changed the title to ILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN. ILSA, THE WICKED WARDEN was directed by the legendary Jesus Franco and co-stars his wife and lifetime collaborator Lina Romay as Ilsa’s lover/informant/patient. WICKED WARDEN has a plot that is very similar to the other Ilsa films so it fits perfectly with the rest of the series. What makes it unique is that for the first time in the series Ilsa holds a position of absolute power. Ilsa’s “mental health clinic” is for women and run by a woman. Finally, Ilsa got the position she wanted and deserved.\n\nAmy Phillips is desperately searching for answers in the death of her sister Rosa Phillips. Rosa was committed to Las Palomas, a clinic for the treatment of sexually deviant behavior in women, and died under mysterious circumstances. Amy enlists the help of her friend Dr. Arcos to get herself checked into the clinic under false pretenses so that she can investigate Rosa’s death. Unbeknownst to Amy the Las Palomas clinic is run by none other than Ilsa aka Dr. Greta! Dr. Greta is an expert at treating everything from sexual to political deviations. She uses a combination of electro-shock therapy, a leather whip, and the help of Juanna, her lover/patient, to keep her patients on the “right” path. Will Dr. Greta become wise to Amy’s plot? Will Amy ever find out what became of her sister?"
