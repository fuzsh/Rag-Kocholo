This year’s works explore the universality of shared ideals, as well as the diverse challenges we all face. Among the program highlights is the very funny computer animation The Green Bird, winner of a 2018 Gold Student Academy Award® International Animation, which harks back to classic cartoons of the mid-20th century.

One Small Step, Bobby Pontillas and Andrew Chesworth’s inspiring story of a Chinese-American girl’s dream of being an astronaut, centers on her evolving relationship with her father.
