        "text": "Welcome back, kind readers and weird little freaks! Once again I’m obsessively cataloguing all the year’s new horror fiction, for my benefit and yours. I really enjoy building and maintaining this list every year. It gives me an incredible birds’ eye view of the landscape of horror publishing, and I’m delighted it’s proven useful to so many of you as well.\n\nI like my horror inclusive, not exclusive–I take a broad view of what counts as horror fiction. Alongside traditional horror, here you’ll find all things gothic, dark, weird, and thrilling–and, hopefully, your next favorite scary book. I’ll be discussing some of my most anticipated 2024 releases on the ARC Party podcast in early January – keep an eye out!\n\nLooking for previous years’ lists? 2023 is here, and earlier years are at the Nightfire site: 2020, 2021, 2022. Would you rather look at these lists broken down by month? Right this way. Did I miss something? Let me know here.\n\nWithout further ado, here are all the new horror books coming in 2024, featuring an array of slashers, ghosts, vampires, cults, monsters both human and otherwise, and all manner of nebulous eldritch terrors.\n\nPlease note that publication dates are subject to change – I’ll be updating the release dates below and adding new books as I hear of any changes, but publisher and retailer websites will always have the most up-to-date info.\n\nMany titles publishing later in the year don’t have concrete release dates yet – I’ve listed those at the very bottom under “Date TBD” – and if the publisher or Bookshop don’t have a dedicated page for a book yet, I’ve linked to Goodreads or to the book announcement elsewhere. Descriptions below are adapted from the publisher’s synopsis. Books publishing in a given month that don’t have a specific date assigned yet are at the bottom of that month’s list.\n\nJanuary\n\nThe Curse of Eelgrass Bog, Mary Averling (Jan 2, Razorbill): Dark secrets and unnatural magic abound when a twelve-year-old girl ventures into a bog full of monsters to break a mysterious curse.\n\nEye of a Little God, A. J. Steiger (Jan 2, Severn House): After losing his delivery job – the last thing binding him to an empty life – Eddie Luther, veteran and drifter, drives into the snowy woods with a bottle of sleeping pills. But instead of eternal silence, Eddie hears a whisper inside his damaged ear: Help me. He follows the call and finds a cryptic journal filled with loneliness and longing, a journal whose words seem written for him alone. Guided by the clues in its pages, he embarks on a journey into a shadowy world beneath the small town of Devil’s Fork, Nebraska – a world where girls become cats, televisions whisper prophecies, and only those cast out of society can see and use magic . . . Or maybe Eddie’s sanity is slipping. All he knows for sure is that he’s falling in love with someone he’s never seen, someone who may be more than human – and who will change everything he thinks he knows about the world and his place in it.\n\nRabbit Hole, Kate Brody (Jan 2, Soho Crime): A twisty, sexy debut exploring the dark side of true crime fandom and the blurry lines of female friendship, perfect for fans of Gillian Flynn, My Favorite Murder, and Fleabag.\n\nCold, Drew Hayden Taylor (Jan 9, McClelland & Stewart): A tragic plane crash that leaves two women stranded and fighting for their lives kicks off this sweeping and hilarious novel from award-winning writer Drew Hayden Taylor that blends thriller, murder mystery, and horror with humor and spectacle.\n\nThe Djinn Waits a Hundred Years, Shubnum Khan (Jan 9, Viking): Rebecca meets Fatima Farheen Mirza in this sweeping, gorgeously atmospheric novel about a ruined mansion by the sea, the djinn that haunts it, and a curious girl who unearths the tragedy that happened there a hundred years prior.

People look to the stars to read the future, but sometimes the stars conceal stories from the past.\n\nStone Gods, Adam Golaski (Jan 9, NO Press): This new collection of strange stories marks Adam’s long-awaited return to horror, following the now cult-classic Worse Than Myself (Raw Dog Screaming, 2008).

His partner Tara Fitzgerald, meanwhile, has secrets of her own, and when the couple are pushed to their limits, they must join together to overcome the darkness… In the tradition of the classic speculative fiction of Richard Matheson, Ira Levin, and Ray Bradbury, Hamelin Bird’s Ambrosia is a genre-defying deep dive into the mysterious and uncanny.\n\nThe Best Horror of the Year Volume 15, ed.

Together with Clay, his research assistant Sylvia, and Dylan’s boyfriend Luke, Dylan is going to document her achievement on Instagram and finally cement her place as the next rising star in rock climbing. Seven months later, three bodies are discovered in the trees just off the highway. All are in various states of decay: one a stark, white skeleton; the second emptied of its organs; and the third a mutilated corpse with the tongue, eyes, ears, and fingers removed. But Dylan is still missing—and no trace of her, dead or alive, has been discovered. Were the climbers murdered? Did they succumb to cannibalism?
