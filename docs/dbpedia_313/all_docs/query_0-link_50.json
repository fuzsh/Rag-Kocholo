        "text": "A guide to movies playing in the New York City area, as well as select festivals and film series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n‘Anomalisa’ (R, 1:30) Directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson, this sad, stirringly painful stop-motion puppet whatsit centers on a floundering soul (voiced by David Thewlis) who, while on a business trip, has an affair with a stranger (Jennifer Jason Leigh). An invaluable Tom Noonan voices everyone else. (Manohla Dargis)\n\n★ ‘April and the Extraordinary World’ (PG, 1:45) A tricky, eccentric, visually ravishing alternative-history animated sci-fi film from France. Marion Cotillard voices the title heroine, an intense young woman trying to find out who is abducting the great scientists of early-20th-century Europe. (Glenn Kenny)\n\n‘Baskin’ (No rating, 1:37, in Turkish) This stylish, shape-shifting horror film from Turkey morphs from a sinuous psychological thriller into a buffet for gore enthusiasts, without ever totally losing its elegance — unless your definition of that word could never encompass a graphic disembowelment or an unexpected stabbing of an eye. (Ben Kenigsberg)\n\n‘Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice’ (PG-13, 2:31) They fight. You lose. (A. O. Scott)\n\n★ ‘Born to Be Blue’ (No rating, 1:38) In this moody biographical fantasia, Ethan Hawke gives what is arguably his deepest performance, playing the self-destructive jazz trumpeter and singer Chet Baker, who died in 1988 following years of heroin addiction. The portrait he creates is of a wounded boy genius who lives for only two things: his trumpet and his drugs. As a young man, Baker was movie-star beautiful (“the James Dean of jazz,” some called him) and the romantic fantasy of scores of women, powerfully embodied by Carmen Ejogo as a fictional composite named Jane. (Stephen Holden)\n\n‘The Bronze’ (R, 1:48) This sour comedy stars Melissa Rauch as a former Olympic bronze medalist in gymnastics who reluctantly agrees to coach her small Ohio town’s next big star in the sport. Ms. Rauch’s character, spoiled and vulgar, is so repellent that she’s hard to stomach for the length of a feature film. (Neil Genzlinger)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
