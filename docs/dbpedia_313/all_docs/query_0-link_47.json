Whether it is a simple tale told over a campfire or 500 pages of world-building expository writing, fantasy allows us to escape the confines of our own daily lives and experience something truly uncommon. Here are 340 fantasy writing prompts to help spark your creativity and give you the ability to create your own reality from the ground up.\n\nThis material is copyrighted by ServiceScape and is designed to be used for writing inspiration. Please feel free to use our ideas as a starting point for your next story! If you use one of our prompts as a basis for a story, you don't have to credit us, but it would be much appreciated if you do. A simple link to ServiceScape is the best way to do that. One caveat: Please do not publish our writing prompts as-is, in their entirety without attribution. This is not the intended use.\n\nAlternate History\n\nThere is an alternate interpretation or outcome for a nonfictional event within the past, establishing a new fictional historical setting for the characters. This redefined historical timeline incorporates elements of magic and the supernatural.\n\nYou wield the magic of the four elements, making you one of the most powerful wizards in the world, but you don't take well to your archmage title and isolate yourself in a small remote village in Tibet. You develop friendships with the local townsfolk and, over time, are able to find peace and hone your powers without the constant interruption that comes with a position of leadership. When your mountain town is invaded during the Annexation of Tibet, you are forced to come out of hiding and use your powers to liberate Tibet from the occupation.\n\nInstead of the British industrial revolution, a magical revolution takes place in the late 1700s that results in the United States never becoming a superpower. Britain engages in a policy of isolationism, keeping all magical technology locked within its borders, while maintaining a dominant position on the world stage. As a British magic dealer, an opportunity presents itself in 1834, so you start illegally transporting bottles of elixirs into the United States and turning a huge profit—until something unexpected happens.\n\nIt is 1969, and you are one of the first astronauts to walk on the moon. As you take the first steps on the moon's surface, you and your crew discover stones with magical properties. You collect a few and take them back to Earth for additional research. The Soviet Union immediately sends a group of cosmonauts to the moon to gather their own source of magic. Tensions between Russia and the U.S. reach their peak, and a magical arms race ensues between these two superpowers.\n\nAs a historian, you are tasked with deciphering the inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone after it is surrendered to the British in 1801. You translate several inscriptions and discover that you now understand enough of the language to decipher the hieroglyphs you copied during a recent Egyptian archeological expedition. While reading the incantation aloud, it awakens all embalmed Egyptians, who had preserved themselves as well as their civilization using powerful magic. They now wish to resume their dominant role in the world.\n\nYou are a witch by trade, and you also just happen to be the mistress of a young playwright named William Shakespeare. Your coven dwells deep within the Forest of Arden and is ruled by your sister, Ophelia, who is the opposite of the sweet wilting flower you and William concocted thanks to the magic spell you placed on his quill. When the play Hamlet premieres, your sister casts a spell on the audience to make them clamor for a story about the young Ophelia. You confront your sister, and she implores you to use your skill to write another play about her namesake — this time without William. You refuse, as you do not want to stand in William's way and prefer to stay in the shadows. But when your once-powerful sister falls ill, you change your mind. You must honor her and — as she has you promise at the foot of her deathbed — make yourself known to the world. You fulfill your promise with the premiere of the soon-to-be world-renowned play Ophelia and are set to challenge your one-time lover's title as the greatest playwright in history.\n\nUsing your magical powers, you conjure a sea monster to attack the Christopher Columbus expedition during their initial voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. They survive the encounter and return to Spain with only a tall tale to show for it. Although a few in the royal court believe the story, most dismiss it and consider the expedition to be an embarrassing failure. With European powers uninterested in funding a new transatlantic expedition, you can now sail across the ocean yourself and claim the entire territory as your own. You become the first explorer to land in the New World, bringing your inherited magic with you.\n\nYou barge into the theater looking for the president. You see John Wilkes Booth approaching him, his Deringer pistol drawn, and you know you have only one chance to save Abraham Lincoln. You close your eyes and quickly recite a spell. When you hear the gunshot, you are startled by the noise and the screams from the audience. You run to Lincoln's box, finding Booth knocked out cold by a man who accompanied the president. However, the president is nowhere to be found. \"Where is he?\" the First Lady screams as she frantically looks around. A smile spreads across your face. Your spell worked, transporting the president out of harm's way… but where is he? You walk downstairs to search the theater. Then you review the spell in your mind and realize you forgot one important word, making his location more about \"when\" than \"where.\" You think more, do a few calculations in your head, and determine that you sent the president to 1965 — 100 years into the future. You visited that point in history many years ago and remember it being a tumultuous time for the United States at the height of the civil rights movement. Unfortunately, there is nothing else you can do. With your powers greatly diminished after performing such a powerful spell, you decide to leave Lincoln there and see what becomes of it.\n\nThe Huns race over China. In a last vain attempt to save the outermost borders, the emperor calls for the armies to assemble. Everyone knows you to be a clothier, but your family has a history older than recorded time. Your great grandfather used his magical gifts to counsel emperors, as his ancestors did before him. Your family has never ruled, but their influence could be seen in the very heart of China's history—that is, until the emperor's daughter accused your great grandfather of dealing in all things \"unnatural.\" In fact, such an accusation was the farthest from the truth. Your family's gifts come from the heart of China, the very soul of the country. As the Huns press further into your country's borders, you know that China is calling for you to fulfill the oath of your ancestors. You may have to stand alone and defeat the invaders without help, but you will face the Huns. China gives you no other choice.\n\nAfter Julius Caesar declared himself dictator for life in 44 B.C.E., conspirators began plotting his assassination. Seeing the dictator's demise in a vision of the future, a soothsayer close to Caesar warns him of this betrayal. Caesar then thwarts the assassination attempt, arresting the conspirators and sentencing them to death. After foiling the plot, Caesar moves to aggressively expand the Roman Empire to every corner of the Earth. This expansionism continues throughout the centuries. Whether it was Alaric the Visigoth, Wu Zetian, or Genghis Khan, no leader could withstand the might of the Roman military. The Romans were even able to traverse the Atlantic Ocean and add the Americas to their massive empire, subjugating the native inhabitants in the process. Today, the entire world suffers under the boot of authoritarianism, ruled by the descendants of Caesar.\n\nYou are in command of British forces during the French and Indian War. After your forces suffer a sound defeat at the Battle of Fort Bull, rumors emerge among the British soldiers that the French are being led by a woman with magical powers. You write it off as an imaginary falsehood and continue strategizing with your fellow commanders until a mysterious stranger bursts into your tent, asserting to be a witch hunter. He tells you that the French have been bewitched by a woman who claims dominion over all of the New World. He offers to help you defeat this mystical warrior before she lays waste to the 13 British colonies and becomes Empress of the Americas.\n\nThe year is 1830, and the American railroad system is beginning to snake its way across the country. As a surveyor hired under Colonel John Stevens, you have been sent to a remote part of the western territories to scope out the land. During your journey, the landscape starts changing in unexpected ways. The desert sands are now forming hard, sharp peaks, and the reptiles seem to be getting larger the further west you go. The people seem different as well. The settlers you to talk to refuse to make eye contact and are wary of you, regardless of how friendly you are. One older woman warns you not to go too far west, or you might get too close to him. You ask who \"he\" is, but the old woman shushes you, shakes her head, and shuffles away. Her warning plays over in your mind as you keep riding west, not knowing what lies ahead. Eventually, among the sharpened sand peaks and unspeakable creatures, you see a dark and jagged tower on the far horizon. Soon thereafter, you are captured and brought to the court of the Desert Magus, an ancient warlock with immeasurable power who reveals that he has been the one reshaping the West to his will—and he intends to continue.\n\nYou are a member of the most powerful monarchy in the world: the Danish royal family, who has ruled for centuries with dragons by their side. On your eighteenth birthday, you finally learn the family secret. Instead of being gifted a dragon, you turn into one.\n\nIn April 2010, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig located in the Gulf of Mexico caused the largest marine oil spill in history. With hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil seeping into the natural habitats of animals daily, you and your team of researchers and marine biologists have volunteered to help. You quickly realize that this oil spill is not like any other. Some of the creatures you treat have large, oily looking leeches attached to them and, no matter what you do, you cannot remove them. As the days progress, the affected animals magically transform into oily monstrosities that you no longer recognize. Without warning, they migrate, spreading their affliction to every living thing in the world's oceans. Now humanity is under the constant threat of these oceanic monsters, who increasingly venture out onto dry land to feed their insatiable hunger.\n\nFor generations wizards kept their knowledge to themselves, practicing their magical arts far from those who should never wield such power. They are convinced that forbidden esoteric knowledge should remain forbidden at all cost. However, in 1450, a wizard peering into the future foresees a world where knowledge is not forbidden, and it spreads like wildfire throughout the land. It all starts with an inventor named Johannes Gutenberg, who builds a machine called the printing press, allowing books to be published and distributed on a massive scale. A renaissance then overtakes the world, with knowledge of every form being distributed amongst the people. However, with the power to enlighten the masses, the wizard-seer fears it is only a matter of time before everyone knows the magical secrets that he and his brethren possess. So, with a snap of his finger, the wizard kills Gutenberg and all those who would dare use machines to distribute knowledge. Soon thereafter, Europe falls into a second dark age, and wizards become the puppet masters of kings and emperors throughout the world, ensuring that their knowledge remains theirs alone.\n\nAn airborne virus released in 1989 by the Russians during the Soviet–Afghan War infects millions of people worldwide, turning them into winged, gargoyle creatures. Modern technology is wiped out. As one of the unaffected humans, you must hunt the infected humans if you are to survive.\n\nAs an alchemist in China during the Tang dynasty, you have spent many years researching how to create an immortality elixir. However, despite countless hours of experimentation, all of your attempts so far have failed. After gathering a new set of ingredients, you decide to try again, hopeful that your latest experiment will be more successful. You mix saltpeter, charcoal, and sulfur in an attempt to extend the life of the mayflies that you trapped that morning. Unfortunately, the flies drop dead one by one, and you conclude that the experiment is yet another failure. When nightfall comes, you light a few lamps and pack up what remains of your experiment. Suddenly, you are thrown to the floor by an explosion. You look up to see your laboratory engulfed in flames. Then, out of nowhere, water rains down from inside your home, extinguishing the fire in the process. Confused and shaken, you don't know what to make of it all. When a knock sounds on your front door, you open it to find an old man who introduces himself as a shaman. He explains that he is the one who saved you from the flames after you inadvertently invented gunpowder — a highly dangerous substance that can be used to commit unspeakable atrocities in warfare. You don't believe him and brush him off, but before you can close the door, he waves his hands and sends you to the future, where you witness several wars. Once you truly understand what gunpowder can do, you are returned to your time. You thank the shaman for opening your eyes and reassure him that you agree that this knowledge should be forbidden. Satisfied with your response, the shaman walks away, and you quickly close the door. Once alone, you remove a handheld gunpowder weapon from underneath your tunic that you snatched from a fallen officer during your travels through time. You decide to ignore the shaman and discover how this future technology works so you can produce hundreds more weapons for the warriors of your age.\n\nThe sudden appearance of ghastly, goblin-like creatures in the late 1800s forces a drastic social change in gender roles when certain women are gifted with the ability to destroy the creatures. As one of these gifted women, you are selected to join a private agency that hunts down the creatures. Your husband disapproves, but you have always believed that you are destined to be more than a housewife.\n\nThe great army of Genghis Khan surrounds your home city of Bukhara. The location is not heavily fortified, with just a mere moat and a single wall separating you from the tens of thousands of soldiers preparing for siege. You know what awaits your people: execution for all who resist, and either military conscription or enslavement for the rest. You have only once chance to save the city. You convince the city leaders to allow you to negotiate peace on their behalf. They agree, knowing that you are their best chance for survival. They open the gates, and you leave the confines of the city, approaching a white tent the Mongolians set up that morning. When you enter, you are surprised to see Genghis Khan himself waiting for you, along with a bevy of advisors. At first you plead for mercy from the emperor, yielding nothing but disdain and laughter. After being dismissed as nothing more than a stalling tactic, you decide to reveal what you have to offer in return. Closing your eyes, you take a dead mouse from your pocket, cup it in your hands, and begin to chant, causing ire amongst the Mongolian court. You open your hands, and the mouse has turned to dust. Out of nowhere, a shadowy figure appears beside you holding a sword and shield. Genghis Khan quickly grabs his nearby mace, but you tell him that this is just a mere demonstration of your power. You are a necromantic conjurer who can turn the dead into whatever you wish, including soldiers. All you need are the recently deceased to perform your work. The shadowy figure soon disappears due to the small lifeforce that the mouse provided, but that is all Genghis Khan needs to see. He agrees to spare Bukhara. In return, you are put to work during the siege of Samarkand, creating an army of invincible soldiers from the corpses of Genghis Khan's slain enemies. Soon, the Mongolian's military quintuples in size, and Genghis Khan now has the power to overtake the entirety of Europe and Africa.\n\nIt's early in the 20th century, and you're leading an expedition to one of the most inhospitable places in the world: Antarctica. The strong winds and bone-chilling cold make the journey across the desolate landscape an absolute misery. After hours of slowly traversing the frozen wasteland, frustrated by your lack of progress, you decide to set up camp and continue your expedition the next day. A few hours later, you are awakened by the ground shaking. After 30 seconds or so, the tremors subside, and you scramble from your tent. In the distance, the ground has been torn asunder. Surprised, your team decides to investigate the newly formed ravine. As you approach, you hear your colleague yelling that he sees something moving at the bottom of the chasm. You initially ignore his assertion, but he continues to insist that something is in fact down there. You decide to investigate and unpack the rock-climbing rope. After descending down the chasm, you can make out the faint flicker of torchlight and a group of people gathered below. You move closer and realize their scale: Each person is at least 20 feet tall! These giants have lived under the South Pole for generations, trapped below ground during the last ice age. Lucky for you, they are for the most part friendly, although very suspicious of you and your kind. You decide to spend several weeks living amongst the giants, learning their customs as well as a few basic words of their language. One morning, you notice that most of the men are gone. You inquire and are stunned to learn that the giants have decided to invade the surface world, ordering their warriors to climb up the ravine and attack whoever opposes them. With an abundance of food and natural resources, and with little standing in their way except for puny humans, the giants see the surface world as theirs for the taking — and your fear they might be right.\n\nYou're sitting beneath an ancient tree whose trunk is so wide you cannot reach around it. The sun is hot on your skin, and you can hear the sounds of the birds in the foliage over your head. This is the place you like to come to be on your own and connect with the land around you. It makes you feel closer to your ancestors, which is essential for a Karadji shaman such as yourself. Suddenly, you hear the cries of your people, and you jump to your feet to see them gathering along the shore, thrusting their spears in the air. You race to the top of the sand dune and see what looks like a strange, white cloud drifting across the water toward the shore. You walk across the sand, and your people part to let you through. They're looking to you to know what to do. As the white cloud nears, you see that it's something else entirely: a vessel of some sort bringing a group of strange looking men to your shores. You close your eyes, focus your mind, and try to perceive the future. When the vision strikes you, you fall to your knees. These men will bring sickness and destruction to your land. They will label you and your kind \"Aboriginal Australians\" and will subjugate your people for generations. You now know what you must do. You get up and call forth the powers of ancestorial spirts, who surround your homeland with an impenetrable barrier. The vessel crashes into this wall, causing it to sink and drowning the invaders in the process. Your homeland is protected for now, but you don't know how long this will last. All you do know is that you must stop at nothing to prevent these invaders from stepping foot on your soil.\n\nChildren's Story\n\nWritten for younger audiences, these stories usually teach child-appropriate life lessons within the framework of fantasy storytelling. Adult-oriented themes, such as violence, are either downplayed or removed altogether.\n\nYou are the son of a farmer who stumbles across a large egg in the woods. You take care of the egg until one day it hatches and a cute little dragon pops out. Through trial and error and your parents' guidance, you learn how to become a responsible pet owner.\n\nOn your eleventh birthday, your father gifts you a book about a magical world. You are reading a chapter about three children trying to overthrow an evil ruler when you get sucked into the book and find yourself in that world, standing in front of the characters you were just reading about. All three children stare at you. One of them asks, \"Are you the magical hero we summoned to help us save our land?\"\n\nWhile waiting for the school bus on a rainy day, you notice a set of tiny red eyes peeking out at you from a bush. From that day forward, wherever you go, the eyes seem to be there, appearing in dark corners or under furniture. When you finally confront the mysterious eyes in the shadows, a small white mouse wearing a tunic reluctantly appears. He tells you that it is time to go home. He toots on a strange looking trumpet, and you are transformed into a mouse who must fulfill your destiny as ruler of the mouse kingdom—but all you want is to be home in time for dinner!\n\nYou are spending the summer at your aunt's home in the middle of nowhere, helping her with her farm as punishment for misbehaving. She warns you to stay inside the stone walls of the farmstead. You do not listen. As you explore the stone wall, you discover a strange silver locket nestled between the rocks. You take it home and pry it open. A gust of air and bright light erupt from it. You have opened a portal to another world, and it quickly sucks you inside. There you find all of your aunt's farm animals, but now they can speak to you and some even possess magical powers. With the help of your new-found friends, you try to find a way back home.\n\nYour older brother is about to go off to college, and you are feeling left behind. Over the years, the two of you have grown apart, and he has traded quality time with you for quality time with his friends and girlfriend. While exploring an antique shop with your parents, you find an old, fancy mirror. A woman appears in the mirror, offering you your heart's desire. You wish that there was a way to make your brother stay forever. She smiles and grants your wish. The next morning, you go into your brother's room to find that he has been trapped inside a mirror himself. You go back to the shop and find that the magic mirror has disappeared.\n\nYou have moved to a small oceanside town. Your mother, a librarian, takes you to work with her each day in the summertime. Unfortunately, you hate reading. Impatient, you begin to explore the library's dustier shelves and discover an old journal. It speaks of half-fish, half-human creatures. One day, while out riding your bike, you spot one such creature beached on the sand. She seems to be about your age. You help her and make an unlikely—and forbidden—friend.\n\n\"Please help us,\" a lion says to you during a field trip to the zoo. Shocked, you realize you can now understand and communicate with all animals. Sympathizing with the animals who want to escape the zoo, you hatch a plan to help them.\n\nYour father is always coming home with unusual souvenirs from his travels abroad. His most recent trip took him to the pyramids, where he acquired a painting of ancient Egypt. As you study it one evening, you are pulled into the painting and find yourself in ancient Egypt. You decide to explore this world, learning about Egyptian culture and society.\n\nOne day, a strange old man gives you a mysterious bag containing a piece of string, a broken chess piece, a piece of hard toffee, and a feather. You soon learn that each item is magical and that you were chosen to use the items to help four people in need.\n\nWhen you were seven years old, your mother would take you out into the fields to catch fireflies. She used to tell you that the moon imbues them with magic, and if you find the right one, it will grant you one wish. Now that you are ten years old, you don't believe in such silly stories or your annoying mom—until you catch the right firefly and accidentally wish your mom away.\n\nYou attend a wizard school for children and are eager to participate in a contest of magical power against your peers. You feel confident that you will win the trials, but fall short and come in at second place. Although you are frustrated with losing, you learn how to deal with disappointment and the importance of good sportsmanship.\n\nSmall valuables have slowly been going missing, and your parents keep blaming you. But you know it is not your fault. Deciding to get to the bottom of things, you stake out the living room, setting a silver spoon from your mother's hutch out as bait for the thief. You awake in the middle of the night and lock eyes with a white cat, the spoon in its mouth. It darts off, scrabbling through an open window, and you follow it, eventually discovering a small city of cats in the middle of the woods. To your surprise, they speak to you, explaining that they only steal to break the curse and that, with enough offerings to the forest's fairies, they may become human again. They ask you to help them.\n\nYour grandpa gardens to keep the gnomes away. That's what he tells you, and you believe him. One weekend, while he's away at a farmer's market, he asks you and your older sister to house-sit and care for the garden. Your sister throws a party, resulting in the smashing of grandpa's pumpkin patch, and the very next night, the gnomes arrive and wreak havoc in the house. It's up to you to stop them.\n\nYou are in fifth grade when the dreams begin. You find yourself in a version of your hometown that is not quite your hometown. The people are the same, but they dress wildly, in colorful gowns and suits. The town itself is the same, but the buildings are different; the library is a castle, and the local supermarket is built into a large tree in the center of town. When you are in the dream world, no one pays you any mind until one day a boy your age whom you have never seen before realizes that you are not from here. He tells you he isn't either. In fact, he's been trapped here for years. It's up to you to help him—without getting trapped yourself.\n\nYou and your family have just moved into a new house in a sleepy little town. The small garden in the backyard is decorated with a fairy village. Finding the village endearing, you begin to add items here and there. One night, you notice the lights in the homes are on. When you go outside to investigate, you see that actual fairies have moved into the village. They tell you that they need your help, so you do your best to keep them safe.\n\nYou are a shy boy who is new in town with no friends to speak of. At a fair, you win one of the games and receive a wooden unicorn as your prize. In the middle of the night, you awake to find a real unicorn curiously staring down at you.\n\nYour mother is an animal trainer who is constantly travelling for work. The summer of your eighth birthday, she takes you on a road trip across the countryside to remote towns you've never even heard of. You have no idea what sorts of animals she trains until you sneak out of the hotel room to follow her. In a clearing within a mossy pine forest you find your mother… with a dragon.\n\nYou are a child growing up in a small town. Every evening, bunnies come out in your yard to eat grass and play. You always enjoy watching them, but one day you notice a fox hiding in the bushes, creeping up to get them. You close your eyes and make a wish that the bunnies will be protected. You open your eyes to find the fox running away from the bunnies, who are now the size of your mom's car.\n\nYou deliver papers for a local newspaper publication that your family owns. The last house on your route is an old, vine-covered cottage on a dead-end street. Your family has told you to avoid the woman who lives there at all costs. But when the newspapers start piling up on her doorstep for days on end, your curiosity gets the best of you. You knock on her door and soon meet the town witch.\n\nThe night that you lose your first tooth is the night you meet the tooth fairy. She is kind and bears gifts for you from her world. You become good friends with her. She says that not every kid can see her, which makes you feel rather special. Years go by, and teeth are lost. Eventually, you lose your last adult molar. She visits you one last time and presents you with a very special gift. She hands you the tiniest jar you have ever seen, which contains a tiny tooth. She says goodbye, and you put the tooth under your pillow. When you wake up in the morning, you are in her world and enrolled in the Tooth Fairy Academy.\n\nComedy\n\nFantasy tropes are parodied, satirized, and subverted within this subgenre. The plot usually borders on the ridiculous, and characters often have quirky personalities and exaggerated idiosyncrasies.\n\nAs the newly coronated queen, you grow tired of the silly games women must play to keep heroes satisfied. You especially dread the annual hike to the dragon's lair, having to yell for help all day long until a hero shows up to \"save\" you. Throughout the kingdom, women and make-believe villains want to put an end to this farce once and for all. Therefore, you enact the Princess Act, which declares that women are no longer required to carry out damsel-in-distress scenarios to boost the egos of heroes. Shocked to hear that women were pretending this entire time, heroes must now find a new way to prove themselves.\n\nWhile out walking one night, you come across a comic book store that you've never seen before. You enter, and the odd man behind the counter offers you a free, limited-edition Deeds and Dwarves Campaign book, the game that you and your friends play every weekend. You take it, envisioning yourself as the champion of your friend group who will be applauded for showing them exclusive content for a game they all love. After planning a campaign, you gather your friends in your mother's basement, which is home to your family's four cats and their respective kitty litter boxes. But the moment you finish filling out the character sheet, the room begins to rumble, and suddenly your mother's basement is plunked down in the middle of Dwarfguard, the fictional land of the game. Even worse, your friends are transformed into their dwarven characters, the cats are transformed into horses, and you have become an old wizard with arthritis. None of you will be turned back until you beat the campaign, so you slowly climb onto your meowing horse and set forth into a world of adventure.\n\nThe Lord of Hiccups is known as such due to the never-ending hiccups inflicted upon him at birth. Your sadistic uncle forces you into a marriage with the cursed lord and, after one long year, you have had enough of your husband's never-ending ailment. You go on a quest to find the only known cure for such a curse: The Holy Dixie Cup.\n\nYou work the night shift at a local 24-hour grocery store in your small town—a job you have because no one else would take it. You are the only one in the store, and hardly anyone sets foot in the place after 11 pm. One night, a rather tall man walks in. He wobbles when he walks, and his face remains obscured by the high collar of his trench coat and the wide brim of his hat. He utters a gruff \"hello.\" Curious, you begin to mop the aisles only to get a glimpse of him. When you get to his aisle, you are shocked to see several small hands peeking out of the trench coat, grabbing cans of beans and corn before returning back into the depths of the coat. You call out to the strange thief, and the trench coat drops. You see a stack of goblins staring back at you, looking as equally as bewildered as your feel.\n\nUnfortunately, your father is about to croak. As the leader of your clan of frogs, he reveals a shocking secret to you on his deathbed: All the males in your family can turn into a human—but only if they can convince a human to fall in love with them.\n\nAs the evil Black Knight, you are feared throughout the land as a brutal and ruthless warrior. Although many have tried, no one has bested you in battle. You agree to serve a dark warlock and lead his army of the undead to wreak havoc and destruction across the land. One day, while you are fighting a hero during a great battle, the hero's mace strikes a might blow against your armor and your helmet flies off. The empty helmet hits the ground, and the battle comes to a standstill as everyone is astonished to see that the Black Knight has no head. The hero slowly approaches the still-standing knight and looks down into a seemingly empty suit of armor. Waving away some smoke, he sees you, a small fairy, at the bottom, using a series of gears, levels, and other contraptions to control the knight's arms and legs. The hero picks you up by the wing and shows you to everyone. He begins laughing, and soon everyone on the battlefield, including your army of the undead, join in.\n\nAs the jester of the court, your job is to keep the royals laughing. In fact, it was the job of your father, your grandfather, and his father before him. You sing, you dance, and you roast the royals without consequence. But when one of your puns makes King Gerald laugh himself to death, the tables turn. You are sentenced to life on the Island of Fools, a remote island where bad comedians are sent to live out the rest of their days. Armed with an arsenal of jokes and a set of curled toed shoes, you are forced to live among the unfunny for the rest of your days—unless you can find a way off the island.\n\nFerrying souls across the River Styx is an unpleasant and monotonous business. One day, a living human shows up demanding to speak to the manager.\n\nFrustrated that local townsfolk are being promised untold riches but instead being fooled again and again, a king has finally had enough and places a bounty on a mischievous leprechaun for his never-ending pranks and misconduct. As a reputable bounty hunter, you are determined to capture the leprechaun and claim the reward from the king—not to mention the leprechaun's pot of gold. However, the trickster is on to you and traps you in a series of hilarious scenarios, each of which you must escape before he turns you into a duck.\n\nOn the night before graduation, you and your best friend try to conjure up a unicorn in the basement of the mage's school. You're thrilled when it works… then quickly panic when five unicorns appear, then 10, then 20. Soon, the entire castle is overrun by unicorns doing everything from raiding the castle kitchen for apples to chewing on tapestries and knocking over priceless magical artifacts. Knowing that daylight is only a few hours away, you and your friend have to find a way to send these clumsy magical horses back to their world before the headmaster wakes up.\n\nYou and your friend are at a carnival when you come across a booth challenging you to test your strength by pulling a sword out of a stone. The sign promises great fortune. Your friend, who is much more athletic than you, gives it a try without success. The carnival workers poke fun at you, daring you to give it a try. When you do, the rusty old sword comes loose from the rock with ease. Suddenly all eyes are on you, and people begin bowing before you, hailing you as their new king. In fact, anywhere you go now, sword in hand or not, people worship you—so much so that it gets in the way of your everyday life. When someone begins following you around town and bangs coconuts together to mimic the sound of a horse galloping, you have had enough. You are now on a quest to break this strange carnival curse and relinquish the crown you never asked for in the first place.\n\nAfter your great-great grandfather rejects a powerful witch's love, she places a curse on your entire family that forces one member to have the head of a hamster from birth. As the member of the family born with the curse, you must find someone who will love you in order to break the curse forever. You start attending furry conventions around the world in the hopes of finding your true love.\n\nYou are a knight on the way to save a princess, which is something you do on a weekly basis. Unfortunately, no princess has been interested in marrying you, even after witnessing your heroic acts. These weekly trips have become a complete dead end, and you are becoming increasingly frustrated with your loveless life. During your latest quest, you stumble upon a potion shop. Inside, an old blind woman is selling concoctions of all kinds, with effects ranging from \"chicken breath\" to \"immortality.\" She shows you a potion with the promise of making you irresistible, but says that it is not for sale because no one would like that sort of attention. While she's out of the room, you steal it, thinking it's a surefire way to ensure that you'll find a wife. However, when you drink it, you find that it does make you irresistible—but only to flies. Your stench becomes known throughout the land, and you have even less luck in your efforts to find a partner.\n\nYou are the last of your kind, a dragon whose lineage has been terrorizing mankind for generations. When you come of age, you consider going into the family business of burning down buildings, eating knights, and spitting out their armor. However, you are hesitant and instead spend much of your time in your cave hiding from others—until, that is, the invention of pizza. You find your calling, from heating brick ovens to delivering food across the land, and you quickly become a legend. But as the centuries drag on and you enter the modern age, people begin to see you as a washed-up mascot, no better than the likes of those horrendous animatronic characters from the 1980s. Feeling the loss of respect from those who once revered you, the choice is yours: live out the rest of your life in shame or show the people how fearsome you can truly be.\n\nThe battle for the end of days is waging, and your angel brethren are called to arms. However, you are comfortable in your human form and are more interested in puttering around in your garage than caring about the state of existence. What is the point of being a fallen angel if you still have to show up to work every time there is an apocalypse? You just want to be left alone.\n\nWhen your human kingdom places a toy and cookie embargo on the neighboring elf kingdom, they retaliate by unleashing a curse that turns all men into trolls and goblins and all woman into pixies and selkies. Now completely comprised of fantasy creatures, the once human inhabitants of this kingdom must deal with all baggage and annoyances that come from being a fantasy character.\n\nYou are enjoying your breakfast when you hear a knock on the door. You open it to find an elf, a wizard, a goblin, and a kangaroo standing outside, saying they received your invitation. You have no idea what they're talking about, but before you can object, they proceed to make themselves at home.\n\nYou've waited for decades for your prince to come, but to no avail. You are now 60 years old and tired of waiting for other people to solve your problems. You cut off your long gray hair, don some less ornate clothing, and sneak out of your tower to head off in search of adventure. As you near a town, you spot another tower and decide to investigate. Inside is another princess, although she is much younger than you. You help her escape, and together you make it your mission to free the other princesses who share in your plight. Eventually you form a roving gang of ex-princesses and pillage the kingdoms that trapped you.\n\nYou and your neighbor have been at odds for years over the state of his front yard. You can't stand how it looks and are convinced that he is a complete slob. Meanwhile, the neighbor believes that one of your kids is tearing up his yard. One day, in the middle of yet another argument, you both witness a gnome come out from behind a bush, rip up a piece of the lawn, shake his fist at both of you, and run away. After a little investigating, you learn that a small colony of grumpy gnomes is responsible for all of the damage, but no matter who you talk to or how much evidence you provide, no one believes your story. When you find your house covered in dirt one day, you decide enough is enough. Reluctantly, you and your neighbor put your differences aside and decide to track down the gnomes before they wreck your entire neighborhood.\n\nYou are weak, unathletic, uncoordinated, and scared of anything bigger than you. Considering you are 5'1'', that's basically everything in your small town. Your name is Tim, but everyone in your village calls you Timmy the Timid. You laugh it off, yet deep down you know that no one in town respects you. Whether it was that one time you fell into the chicken coop and got covered in feathers or that other time you lost an arm-wrestling match with a sprite, you always end up as the butt of a joke. One day you hear that your king is searching for knights to fight against the invading horde from the shadowlands and is holding a contest to find the bravest and strongest warriors in the kingdom. You decide to participate.\n\nContemporary\n\nThe setting takes place within a modern-day time period. Magic exists within this framework, but it is usually either indiscernible to most or has a logical, fact-driven explanation for its existence.\n\nYour grandmother's dog has always bothered you. It's small and white, rather prim, and always sits and stares at you with its unblinking eyes. It's been around since you were a kid, and you feel as if it should have died years ago, but it keeps on living to your dismay. When your grandmother passes on, her dog becomes yours. You begrudgingly take it to your suburban home and, despite your displeasure, realize it really isn't too bad of a house guest. Until the night of the full moon, that is. You wake up to a horrible growling noise and rush downstairs. In place of the dog sits an old man. He wears a nicely pressed white suit and has a thinning patch of curly hair on his head. He smiles at you and introduces himself as your grandfather, who was cursed years ago by your grandmother. She did it to keep the family safe, he tells you with a wicked grin. And with that, he vanishes.\n\nYou've never been particularly good at school. You get mostly C's and sometimes even D's, no matter how much you study and prepare for exams and in-class essays. With applying to college on the horizon, your parents are becoming frustrated with you and tell you that you must improve your grades. You walk into your English class, feeling more stressed than ever and nervous about the essay questions on your test. Instead of the old lady who usually teaches your class, there is a young and beautiful substitute teacher with auburn red hair. When you approach the desk to retrieve your test, she can see that you are anxious. You tell her your worries about doing poorly, and she smiles. She reaches into her bag and pulls out a black pen, telling you that the pen is magical and writes only the correct answers. You take the pen and, sure enough, you ace your test. You continue to use the pen on every test or essay, and soon you advance to the top of your class. Things are great until, one day, your pen does not write the answers to your math test. Instead, the pen writes down that it desperately needs your help. You discover that the pen is bound to the soul of a straight A student who ran afoul of a witch with auburn red hair. There is a way to undo the curse, but it requires a single strand of hair from the witch who captured the soul in the first place.\n\nCGI is all the rage, but your special effects makeup studio is still in high demand due to your unnatural ability to make actors look like anything that the script requires in just a few shakes of a tail feather. Your secret? Witchcraft—more specifically, the ability to bend and mold latex and other practical effects to your will. Your coven has allowed this even though practicing magic outside the covenstead is frowned upon. However, when your director suddenly needs 30 zombies ready to go in two hours, not even your magic transformation skills are up to the task. The only solution you can come up with is going to the local cemetery to perform a necromancy spell, which is strictly forbidden by your elders. But will anybody really notice the difference between 30 actors in makeup and 30 real decaying corpses under your control? You decide to take the chance, making sure to place at least three pine scent car fresheners around each zombie's neck.\n\nYou download a dating app that you've never heard of after your friend recommends it. She met her current boyfriend through it and, according to her, he's perfect. She warns you that the sign-up process is a little bit strange, but completely worth it. You shrug and fill out the information, thinking nothing of it. The very next day, a box arrives on your doorstep. You take it inside hesitantly and open it to find an odd array of items inside: a pink elixir, a rose, and some chalk. A notification is sent to your phone shortly after. The app requests that you open it and follow the instructions on the screen: draw a small circle on the floor, think of the perfect partner, and drink the liquid. You do as instructed and, in a gigantic poof of pink smoke, a man appears in your living room, standing inside the circle. In a few days, you get used to him. He is perfectly nice and makes an effort to plan dates as well as bring you gifts, but you soon realize that he barely eats, doesn't sleep, and doesn't seem to know anything specific about his past. You try to shake off the odd feeling, but then see his face, with a different name, on a missing person poster.\n\nIn Manhattan high society, you are known as one of the most successful psychiatrists south of 42nd Street. People especially talk about your famous hypnotherapy sessions, which can cure anything from cigarette smoking to arachnophobia. What they don't know is that you are also a shaman and one of the last practicing dreamwalkers, being able to enter the dream state of hypnotized patient and work directly with the subconscious. One day, a patient comes in and asks for your help to get rid of a facial tic he has had since childhood. After the hypnotherapy session, the patient is amazed with the results, but you feel off. You look in the mirror to find that your face is now twitching. You look up and scream as you see a small spider on the ceiling. You didn't know it at the time, but you were aiding your patients by absorbing their mental states. Now that your inner dam has been broken, you are overflowing with negative emotion, and you don't know how to make it stop.\n\nYou're brushing your teeth when you realize your bathroom sink has a slow drip you've never noticed before. You reach out and tighten the handle, but the drip continues at a rate of about one drip every three seconds. You continue brushing, watching the drip the entire time. The water droplets are stunning. Even against the white porcelain sink, each droplet seems to shimmer with an opal haze. It feels hypnotic to watch them fall to the drain. Your eyes focus on a single droplet hanging from the tip of the faucet spout. Out of nowhere, you feel a rush of water hit the back of your neck, as if a bucket has been dumped over you. Suddenly, you are falling into a dark, watery tube, flying headfirst like you would in a closed water slide flume, plummeting down into an unknown void.\n\nYou've been at your new job for a few weeks and, after five interviews and a grueling vetting process, you are finally feeling comfortable in your new role. You have enjoyed the work so far as well as all of the perks that come along with it, especially the view from your high-rise corner office. One day after lunch, you enter the elevator, swipe your badge, and hit the button for the fiftieth floor, where you are meeting with 12 top executives in the boardroom. You are not exactly sure what the topic of the meeting is, but hopefully they will fill you in when you arrive. The digital number counts up, lighting the number for each floor. When 50 lights up, the elevator stops and makes a bell sound. Then the doors open. Instead of a hallway, entryway, or any other office setting, before you is a vast, empty tundra. You hear a sound in the distance and, as you squint toward the horizon, you barely make out the shape of 12 people riding horses straight toward you.\n\nYour wife has recently taken up a job as a pharmacist in your small town. It's a straightforward job, and she's well beloved by the locals, but you sense that she is unhappy. A few months into the job, she starts staying later and later at work, sometimes coming home in the wee hours of the morning. You become suspicious, thinking the worst. One restless night, you decide to pay her a visit at work. You roll into the parking lot near midnight and see that the lights are on inside the pharmacy. You go through the back door and find your wife behind the counter mixing some sort of concoction in a huge cauldron while the other pharmacists stand around her. You have just discovered the local coven.\n\nYou come from a long line of elven warriors who crossed an ancient rift to live in the human realm ages ago. They fought ferocious beasts, established civilization, and stayed successfully hidden from the developing human race as it evolved into the modern day. Your ancestors were trailblazers in industry and trade and, with their wit, intelligence, and determination, they paved the way for both human and elven generations to come. And now? You work at a greasy fast-food joint in the busiest part of the city. Your grandmother once told you that the rift back to the elven realm will open once more for those who seek it. You have always kept her words close to your heart. The day a customer spits in your face, you decide to start your search.\n\nTired and burnt out from your 12-hour nursing shift, you are more than ready to jump in your car and head home. You log out of your computer at 7:02 and collect your things. However, as you are leaving, you glance at the monitor and something catches your eye: You are listed as a patient. Your name and date of birth are right there as someone who has just been admitted to the emergency room. You open the chart, which indicates that you were brought in after a motor vehicle accident. You go to the trauma room listed and see a body on the procedure table, surrounded by medical staff doing CPR. You can't make out a face — there's blood everywhere — so you run back to your computer and look at monitor again. It's definitely you on the board. Then you look at your watch and see that it is 8:15. You shake your head, knowing that you haven't spent more than an hour trying to figure this out. It couldn't have been more than just a few minutes since you saw your name. Confused, you look at your watch again. It begins to slowly wind backwards until the hands point to 7:02. When you look up at the monitor, your name is nowhere to be found. Shaken, you decide to wait a bit before hitting the road.\n\nGenerations ago, humanity begged the Fae to leave this world in order to preserve reality. The Fae agreed to leave, but demanded that humanity never practice magic in return because, from their perspective, magic was theirs alone to possess. The leaders of men agreed, and the Fae disappeared from our existence. Humanity then banned the practice of magic, and tales of such power faded into stories of folklore and legend. However, as technology progressed over the centuries, the Fae came to believe that mankind has broken this sacred covenant, mistaking human technological advancement for magic. They have witnessed mankind flying in the skies, talking to one another over great distances, and even creating golem-like creatures called robots to do their bidding. The Fae have decided to come back to our world and put an end to this, reestablishing the covenant at all cost.\n\nYou run a bookshop in a quiet part of town. You don't get many customers from foot traffic, which you're grateful for, but you have a very particular customer base who pay well and, in turn, keep your store running. You don't know much about them other than they seem to have an obsession with first-edition books and are often very old. You figure that they're just regular people with a particular hobby. One day one of your patrons comes into the store toward the end of your workday in a panic, asking if you have any first editions left. You tell him you just sold your last one an hour earlier. He rushes out of the store. The following week, you find out he has gone missing. The next day, the first edition you sold turns up on your doorstep, burnt. Worried, you seek out your patrons one by one and discover that most of them have disappeared. The only one left is an old woman who explains to you that the will-o'-the-wisps who reside in the town sewer promised them immortality, but at the expense of something precious—in this case, books. But these sprites are suddenly going back on their promise, the old woman says, and she fears she is next. And she is. You decide to seek out the will-o'-the-wisps yourself, but first must face several trials in order to gain an audience with them and find out where your missing patrons have gone.\n\nYour parents passed shortly after you were born, but you still keep of photograph of them in your pocket. Although your aunt raised you, you do not speak to her much. You are content avoiding her because she is quite ill-mannered. One day, your aunt tells you that she is traveling to another town to meet a friend; she will be staying overnight, leaving you alone. Happy to be by yourself for the night, you settle in to watch some TV. Suddenly you hear a thump from inside the house. You do not know what could possibly have made that sound. Moments later, you hear several other thumps, and you quickly follow the sounds all the way to your aunt's bedroom door. You have never entered this room, which she always keeps locked. Hesitantly, you twist the doorknob and are surprised when it opens. You peek inside the dimly lit room. Nothing appears out of the ordinary, so you open the door all the way and enter. Directly across from you is a line of dolls on a shelf, all staring blankly forward. Upon closer inspection, the dolls appear suspiciously humanlike. Suddenly, one of the dolls turns her head toward you. You fall to the floor and scream. Then, all of the dolls turn their heads toward you to shush you. You cover your mouth with both hands. You hear a faint \"thank you\" as the dolls go back to their original positions and the room becomes dead quiet again. You slowly get up to take a closer look. The dolls remain still. Perhaps it was all just in your head. Then you notice that two of them look oddly familiar. You remove the photograph of your parents from your pocket and look at their faces, then back at the two dolls, then back at the photo. They are identical.\n\nYou have heard something calling to you for weeks on end. It's not a voice, so much as it is a melody, though you feel you understand what it wants from you: to understand the pain it feels. You ignore it for the most part. You are a busy woman on her own in the city, with bills to pay and problems of your own. But when you decide to finally heed the call and follow the melody to a park on the north side of the city, you are met with your true calling. Within an overgrown thicket of thorns, you find a unicorn. It is badly wounded and, though it makes no sound aloud, the mournful melody in your head becomes more painful by the moment. You sit with the unicorn, placing your hand upon its side over the wound and, within moments, it begins to close. When healed, the gentle beast rises and lowers its glowing horn to you. A chorus of \"celestial guardian\" rings in your head; as it does, more unicorns appear from beyond the thicket, and you realize that it is a title that has been given to you.\n\nInstead of working at Mambo Burger with your friends, you have decided to take a summer job as a lighthouse keeper on an island off the coast of New England. It is quiet work, and you don't see many people on a daily basis, so you often take breaks down at the small dock near the lighthouse's private beach. One day while swimming, you discover an underwater tunnel beneath the dock. Curious, you swim through it and end up in a cave beneath the lighthouse. Following another tunnel off of the cave, you end up in a smaller room, in which you find a golden medallion atop a stone pedestal. You take it, slip it around your neck, and jump back into the water in order to return to the surface. As you swim you realize that the medallion allows you to breathe underwater. Excited, you swim using the medallion daily. But as the weeks pass on, you notice some fishy side effects: Scales appear on your legs, and gills on your neck. You fear that if you don't find a way to reverse these effects soon, you may have to live underwater forever.\n\nMost say they don't exist. Some say they do, showing a grainy YouTube video of a man in a gorilla costume as evidence. However, you know better. You know that the Sasquatch keep to themselves, hidden among the sequoias and other surrounding forests. Myth says they tend to the trees, and their magic makes the forests grow despite the ever-encroaching shadow of human civilization. You even tried to track one down once years ago, but ended up with nothing to show for it. It is almost as if the forest protects them as much as they protect the forest, somehow covering up tracks and camouflaging them from the outside world. One day during hunting season, you come across a deer deep within the forest. You line up your shot and fire. As the blast echoes through the early morning haze, you see the massive buck fall in the distance. When you approach your kill, you are shocked to find a sasquatch standing beside the fallen beast with pure rage in his eyes. You quickly lift your rifle, aim it at the growling creature, and slowly back away.\n\nYour estranged mother has recently passed. In her attic, you find strange artifacts and books. Nestled in one of them is an old United States Road Atlas marked with red dots in various places. You and your brother decide to take some time off work and go on a cross-country road trip to visit these places in the hopes of feeling closer to your mother. But as you arrive at each location, you realize she was hiding an entire second life from you. She had been cataloging magical creatures, making a map of their locations across the country, and you are now seeing them for the first time in your life.\n\nAs one of three heiresses to a multibillion-dollar fortune, you have never really questioned where the money has come from over the years. Sure, your great grandfather was an oil tycoon and your grandfather was a real estate tycoon and your father was an internet tycoon, but how they became so successful in their respective careers never really dawned on you until recently. As you enter your father's boardroom, you and your two siblings sit down as your father begins to speak. \"Do you know why we are here on the top floor of a skyscraper built by your grandfather? Magic, plain and simple. Our family has a gift to read and influence minds, along with a host of other powers. This has helped us amass a great fortune. Now it is time to pass the business on to the next generation, and I need to know which one of you has the gift.\" He then hands a letter to each of you that explains the test: a series of challenges that will determine who among you can wield magic and bend financial reality.\n\nGrowing up as the daughter of two veterinarians, you were always surrounded by animals. You loved to go to work with your parents and watch them help dogs, cats, bunnies, and even the odd reptile. Your favorite part of all, however, was the interesting conversations you would have with dogs. Unlike the other animals, dogs would respond back to you. Nobody else could hear them but you. It was as if dogs saw something in you that was different than the rest and let you understand their innermost thoughts. Your parents always believed you were just silly and liked to play pretend, but they didn't realize that you could actually communicate with the dogs in their care. As you got older, you feared that people would find you odd if you said you could talk to dogs, so you only ever communicated with the canines when you were alone. One day, a little pup was brought in by a tall, slender man with glasses. The man was fidgety and kept avoiding eye contact with you, your parents, and the entire vet staff. When you started a conversation with the dog, you couldn't believe what he said. The man who brought him in was a kidnapper and was hiding several missing children in a secret room in his basement. Despite the police's best efforts, nobody knew where the missing children were. Even though you now knew where the kids were being held, you also knew nobody would believe you because you got your information from a dog. You only had so much time with the dog, so you used your power to spread the news to every dog that came into the clinic. Perhaps having a group of them helping you would be enough to find the missing children.\n\nAs a botanist, you combine your passion for science with your natural born magic. You grow all sorts of fruits and vegetables, each with different attributes, and sell them at the local farmer's market. Your mother, an old-fashioned magic user, tells you to be careful when mixing the two, as the combination of magic and chemistry can often yield disastrous results, but you pay her no heed. You continue your experiments, adding magical health benefits to otherwise normal fruit, and life goes on. However, one of your experiments seems to have grown a mind of its own, something you have never seen. Initially you are proud of this breakthrough. But when your magical plant begins hiding around the house, your mother's warning echoes throughout your thoughts. Of course, by then, it is already too late. Your plant escapes and quickly drops its seeds around town. Within weeks, the neighborhood has turned into a massive sprawling jungle with thousands of plants, and you must find the plant that started it if you ever want to return to normal.\n\nDark Fantasy\n\nA brooding, foreboding tone and an overall sense of gloom permeate these fantasy stories. Noble heroes fighting for the greater good are replaced with grim, morally ambiguous characters who are usually motivated by self-preservation.\n\nIn a forsaken empire, a once-powerful royal family has ruled the land for more than ten generations. Yet the lineage is cut short when the queen's fifth pregnancy ends in another stillbirth. Fearing that this was a sign of God's damnation, the royal council meets in secret and decides to kill anyone who has a right to the throne. The best assassins are given their targets and, after the massacre, the royal council takes control of the empire and rules with an iron fist. The sin of such treachery curses the empire, and the land is plunged into darkness. Years later, rumors emerge of a powerful sorcerer in the north, protected by an enchanted barrier no one can break. The royal council sends you, the assassin who killed many of the nobles that fateful day, to destroy the barrier using dark magic and then kill the sorcerer. When you break the barrier and reach the sorcerer, you find that he bears a striking resemblance to the royal family.\n\nYou stoke the campfire with a stick, causing embers to dance around and fly up into the night sky. It has been months since you have had a moment of clarity such as the one you're experiencing now. You feel calm and at peace. Then, in the surrounding woods, you hear a rustle. Something is approaching behind you. You turn your head to see a large white wolf emerging from the wilderness. Before you can do anything, the wolf transforms into a slender woman with flowing white hair. She walks over and sits next to you near the campfire. \"What brings you here, mortal?\" she whispers as she gazes into the flames. \"Damnation,\" you respond. \"Why would a man such as you seek out damnation?\" You look up at the stars as tears well up in your eyes. \"I was once a married man, and we had two children. While I was at the market, our house caught fire. When I came home, I could hear my family screaming for help. I did not try to save them. I let our home burn to the ground.\" The woman turns her head toward you. \"So that is why you seek damnation — because you are a coward?\" You look down and respond. \"I was not a coward that day. I let my family burn because I wanted to escape. I hated my family. I wanted them all gone, so I let everything burn.\" The woman smiles and takes your hand. \"Then you have come to the right place, my dear. Follow me.\" You and the woman walk together into the dark wilderness, leaving your campsite behind.\n\nFor years you were known as \"Stallion Jack,\" a highwayman by trade who gallantly relieved carriage passengers of their worldly possessions. The stories often describe you as a daring and dashing gentleman of the road whose swashbuckling heroism was matched only by your chivalrous respect for all of your well-to-do victims. But little could be further from the truth. In reality, countless travelers were harmed or even murdered by your hand. It was all just part of the job from your point of view—until you accidentally killed a well-known priest who many claimed had dabbled in dark magic. Fearing the repercussions, you decided you'd had your fill of highway robbery and fled to the countryside to lay low for a while. Strange nightmares have plagued you ever since. In the dreams, a shadowy figure appears at the end of your bed. One night, you awake in a cold sweat and are terrified to find the shadowy figure standing right where you envisioned him. As you scramble to find a way to defend yourself, the figure speaks to you in a rattling voice: \"Repent your sins, my child.\"\n\nEvery person is a puzzle. Some are missing a few jigsaw pieces; others are missing almost everything. But each and every person can be harvested to construct a totus anima mea, or \"whole soul,\" which provides everlasting life to whomever possesses it. You travel across the country every year murdering strangers and collecting souls with specific traits in the hopes of one day becoming an immortal. You are an amateur at best, but you enjoy the annual road trip as well as the people you meet along the way. On your most recent journey, you bump into an enchantress working at a diner who is on the same mission. As you talk, you get the sense that a whole soul is almost within her grasp. Eventually she mentions that all she needs is one last jigsaw piece contained within a soul that only a soul harvester can possess. You run for the door.\n\nYour bare feet are caked with mud as you stand in the center of the city square, eyes pinned to the executioner's gleeful smile. It takes all your willpower not to lunge for him. Your mother is about to be hanged. It has been revealed that she is the Red Witch, a powerful mage who has freed hundreds of elves from captivity and enslavement. Unfortunately, you know this is not true as you are the Red Witch. Your mother has sacrificed herself for you and sworn you to silence. Above your head, your phoenix flies, circling as if he knows what you have done. He will not land on your shoulder like he normally does as he sees you have betrayed your destiny and your blood. Tears well in your eyes. No, you cannot let this happen. You will not let this happen! You close your eyes as a tear slides down your cheek and whisper a forbidden spell—one to bring about unbridled destruction. After hearing the sounds of terrified screams and the tearing of flesh, you open your eyes to find the executioner and the guards eviscerated. You are relieved, almost happy, until you look around your surroundings and realize the horror you have unleashed. Everyone is dead, including your mother. Your hatred and anger corrupted the spell, amplifying its power far beyond your ability to wield it. You fall to your knees, knowing that you have laid waste to a city of millions.\n\nThe demon king and his vast army march across the land and devastate everything within their path. As kings and lords argue amongst themselves, with even a few choosing suicide over confronting this seemingly unstoppable force, you decide to follow a different path. You ride to the Spire, a tower constructed generations ago to imprison an evil sorceress who threatened the land during her time. Her army of the dead nearly consumed the world until she was defeated and sealed inside this magical tower. You climb the stairs to the top of the Spire and look through the bars. To your amazement, she is not only still alive but also looks as if she has not aged a day. She floats over to you, her feet not touching the ground, and introduces herself. Hearing her kind voice, you begin to doubt all the tales of her wickedness and cruelty. However, you manage to shake off her alluring personality and give her a choice: \"My forefathers constructed this prison and therefore, by blood, I have dominion over you. Either aid me in my quest to defeat this foe and you will be freed or rot for all eternity within this cell.\"\n\nYour family and friends were overjoyed when you were selected to become the apprentice to the town mage — a high honor given only once a generation. You graciously accepted the role and swore to protect the village. You were soon studying the ways of magic and, in time, you became an effective and dependable apprentice. You helped your master with a wide variety of tasks, from mixing potions to fertilizing crops to curing the sick of their ailments. You even helped your master defend the village when the undead invaded your province. However, the town mage's unnatural longevity eventually became your burden, as you waited decades for him to pass his title on to you. It seemed like you would never become a master and take on your own apprentice. However, one day the opportunity finally arrived in a most unexpected manner. While the two of you were collecting ingredients in a nearby forest, your master suddenly lost his footing and fell down a ravine. You rushed over when you heard his cries for help, but as you looked down from the cliff at his mangled body, you decided that this was your chance to take his mantle. Tears welled in your master's eyes when he realized your betrayal and, out of sheer desperation, he began casting several spells, at first to preserve his own life, but then just to harm you in a last-ditch attempt at revenge. Nearly every destructive spell your master knew was cast upon you, but you easily blocked his attacks as they ricocheted off your deflection spell one by one. Eventually, the old mage fell unconscious and bled out. Walking back home, you were practicing your story about the unpreventable demise of your former master when you realized your village was ablaze. Fire swept throughout the land, and pure unmitigated horror engulfed the residents in your hometown. Some were covered in open sores and vomiting; others were overcome by madness. Then it dawned upon you: fire, plague, insanity — these were some of the spells cast by your former master against you as he was dying. You deflected them, but somehow the dispersed spells made their way to your village, causing outright chaos. With nothing left for you but the unintended consequences of betrayal, you collected your belongings and abandoned the doomed people you had sworn to protect.\n\nAfter your mother dies and leaves you all her possessions, you take a liking to her ornate brass mirror. You hang it in your bedroom but are shocked to learn that the mirror is magical and speaks to you. It shows you all the amazing things you can possess, but each comes at a dark price. As the magic mirror consumes you, blighting your soul with unquenchable greed, you wonder if it was the true cause of your mother's sudden death.\n\nYou try to remember who you were before you perished. It was so long ago. There was a great war. Humanity was on the brink. You remember an army of gigantic befouled creatures that wanted to conquer and consume all of mankind. You were… a soldier. An imperial legion archer — a part of the final line of defense. What was left of humanity gathered within your nation's capital. A wall was built around the city. It reached higher than anything anyone had ever built. But it didn't matter in the end. The wall fell, and humanity was no more. Now you roam the battlefield as a bound spirit — a ghost that cannot let go of the past. All of your dead brethren have moved on; some ascended while others descended. However, you are not ready. Over time, you have watched your once bustling city crumble into ruins. You have also witnessed the gigantic creatures turn against each other after all of the people were consumed, fighting and eating one another until only a few remained. You sit on what's left of the city wall and watch one those monstrosities roam the countryside. You look around at your surroundings and suddenly remember that you died here. You were terrified when the creatures attacked. You abandoned your post and fled the battle. When the wall fell, it crushed you, and then you were no more. Now you can remember every detail of your life, providing you an unexpected moment of clarity. If you could only interact with the world, perhaps you could make it right. Perhaps you could have your revenge. But you are just a mere shadow of yourself, without form or ability. You hit the wall out of frustration. Pain shoots through your fist, which is unexpected. Even more curious are the pebbles that were scattered from to the impact.\n\nAfter three long years of searching throughout the known world, you have finally found it: a weapon of immense power that could strike down a god. The ruinous journey, however, has left many scars upon you—some just on your body, others much deeper. When you began your quest, you were a naive squire, a member of a conroi tasked by the king to find this ancient and powerful weapon. The group comprised the finest knights from throughout the kingdom, including your father and brother. Following a rumor about the weapon's whereabouts, your conroi was exploring a cave when they came upon a witch coven. Many died that day, including your friend and fellow squire, but the weapon was nowhere to be found. Later, your group headed into the mountains, believing that the weapon was at the highest peak. When you climbed to the top, you found nothing but frostbite. While climbing back down, your brother slipped and fell into a ravine, never to be seen again. You took his place as a knight and led your devastated father, along with what was left of your conroi, down the mountainside. Months later, someone or something began hunting your group, picking off knight after knight until only you and your father were left. You saw pure madness in your father's eyes as he revealed that he had killed the remaining members of your conroi because he blamed them for the death of your brother. Your father then accused you of being part of the murderous plot. He aggressively approached you, his sword drawn, and you had no choice but to defend yourself. You won the fight but felt nothing but sorrow afterwards. Now, after so much time and sacrifice, you have finally found the most powerful weapon in all the land. You are a champion in every sense of the word, but it means nothing to you. You stare at the weapon blankly, then turn around, remove the armor from your body, and walk away.\n\nWhen the moon turns blood red and the cries of wolves can be heard echoing throughout the land, a young woman must be sacrificed to appease the ancient god who lays dormant under your village. Otherwise, this being from a time before men will rise and decimate the world. You wake up in the middle of the night to find the villagers binding your hands and feet before dragging you out of your bed. You have been chosen as the next sacrifice. Although you beg for your life, the villagers ignore your pleas for mercy. You are carried to the pit, a chasm where, deep within, the beast resides. As you are held over the pit, with a void of pure darkness beneath you and sulfur permeating your nostrils, you realize that you will have but one chance to escape. You wrench your head to one side and whisper an incantation to a villager who is holding you. He places you gently on the ground and walks over to another villager to whisper the same spell into that villager's ear before walking into the pit. The second villager whispers into the ear of another villager, walks to the pit, and falls in as well. The pattern repeats over and over again as one by one the confused mob sacrifices themselves. Finally, you are by yourself, tied up on the edge of a pit with an angry ancient god digesting an unvirginal meal that he never wanted.\n\nWhen you first heard of the falling star that destroyed the Shrine of the Infinite, you were saddened by the unfortunate but unavoidable event. However, after further rumination, you slowly come to the conclusion that this news seems oddly familiar. As archmage and advisor to the emperor, you are well versed in the prophecies of old. Some come to fruition, but most are either proven wrong or so vague that they could apply to almost any situation. This specific incident seems different somehow. After a few days of pondering, you remember reading a scroll decades ago describing this event in detail. You rummage through your personal library, then travel to the imperial archives to research further. Eventually, you find the parchment, which also prophesies the birth of the Prime Heretic in the capital city on the day of the shrine's destruction. According to the prophecy, this person will bring about the corruption of the empire and an end to the royal line you have served for generations. A millennium of darkness will follow, during which all monsters wiped from the face of the world will rise once more and ravage the land. You race to the records chamber and ask for the names of all who were born on that fateful day in the capital, obtaining a list of 12 newborns. You stare at the list, contemplating the unthinkable. Sacrificing innocents because of what one man wrote thousands of years ago is truly repugnant. After all, a prophecy is only words. Even if the Prime Heretic was born on that day, are you prepared to kill 11 others needlessly to ensure you prevent the prophecy from coming true? You can't bring yourself to do it. You close your eyes, rip up the list, and decide to live with the consequences of denying destiny.\n\nWhen the corruption enveloped your village, you thought that it was simply a passing storm. You were confident that the ominous dark clouds would eventually dissipate and the sun would once again shine bright upon the land. Nothing could be further from the truth. Heavy rains have flooded everything as far as the eye can see, making your once idyllic town into an insect-ridden mire of muck and mud. Desperate for any respite, the village elders order you — a former scout of the King's army — to ride north on horseback to the source of the corruption in order to determine its origin. You do as commanded and ride toward the red swirling skies and streaks of lightning at the far horizon. The high winds and belting rainfall make the journey miserable, and the sounds of rolling thunder become an ever-present and unnerving reminder of what potential horrors lie ahead. Eventually you come upon another flooded village. The land is ravaged just as in your hometown. However, the villagers have been corrupted as well, with their skin covered in weeping lesions and their minds twisted. One man manages to tell you that this was caused by a wizard's descent into madness: \"The wizard — insanity took hold of him, so he lanced it off. Ripped the madness right out, so to speak, and poured his chaos into the world. We pay the price for his newfound sanity. We pay the price!\" The man grabs your arm and pleads for death, but you shove him away and quickly ride off. As you leave the town, you try to contemplate what just happened, but your thoughts are scattered. Something feels wrong. Your skin begins to throb in pain. You take off your glove and find lesions on the palm of your hand. As you stare at the wounds, you realize you are forgetting who you are and laugh out loud for no reason. Wait, what am I doing? \"No, no, no…,\" you mumble to yourself. You close your eyes and shake it off. You can't lose control — not now! You must reach the heart of the storm, to the source of the corruption, no matter what takes hold of you.\n\nAfter the Necromantic Wars, anyone caught practicing dark magic is condemned to living out the rest of their days in a prison unlike any other. Carved out of the mountainside at the outskirts of the realm, no one who has entered this prison has ever been seen again. A mounted guard now escorts you, a man found guilty of conjuring the dead, toward the prison entrance along with eleven other sorcerers accused of similar crimes. When you arrive, the large stone doors slowly open to reveal a poorly lit cavernous room. Your fellow travelers plead for mercy but the unresponsive guard simply shoves your party into the room one by one. As the large doors slowly begin to close behind you, the guard makes his way outside, turns around, and tosses a single dagger which lands near your feet. \"Here's something to cut your magic restraints — and each other eventually. Welcome to hell, boys!\" The doors close with a thunderous sound. You grab the dagger, cut yourself loose, and help the other prisoners with their restraints. One of the imprisoned sorcerers casts a light spell, but catches on fire instead. Another prisoner calls upon the elements to force open the doors, only to be ripped apart himself. For whatever reason, the prison reflects magic back upon the caster. With the dagger still in your hand and the other sorcerers following, you travel deeper into the prison, not knowing what horrors lie within.\n\nYou are a demigod, born from a goddess of darkness and a mortal man of little renown. For years you trained in the ways of warfare, knowing that someday the time would come for you to prove yourself worthy on the battlefield. The day finally comes when your mother tells you how one ascends to godhood: by slaying all the other demigods and absorbing their unnatural powers. You then set out to hunt down your own kind, intending to slay the half-gods one by one until you are granted godhood like your mother. However, your mother has not told you the truth. During your journey, you discover that the death of demigods does not bless you with pure divinity, but instead satiates the hunger of the Elder Titan, a primordial god that sired existence at the beginning of time. Although thoughtless and empty, this god has the power to snuff out what it brought forth and must be fed the carcasses of divine beings in order to be appeased. At first, the gods sacrificed themselves to satisfy the Elder Titan. However, as their numbers dwindled, the gods soon realized that it was easier to give birth to demigods and have them slay one another until the last demigod standing is struck down by his parent, thereby ending the Elder Titan's divine feast and setting the stage for a new generation of demigods to be birthed. You tell the other half-gods what you have learned, and you all decide to pursue the path of vengeance. You and your fellow demigods will satiate the appetite of the Elder Titan not with your own blood, but with the blood of your parents.\n\nAll was lost when the beasts came out of the woods, seeking to take over the tower of the ancient mage that kept your realm safe. Winged abominations with row upon row of teeth, hundreds of eyes, and sprawling limbs descended upon the world with horrible, unearthly war cries. They started with the cities, turning royals and peasants alike into minced meats and eviscerating village histories with a swipe of their gnarled, clawed hands. Any who survived the destruction of mankind were forced underground, eventually being blinded by centuries of darkness during which they scrounged for worms and beetles to feed their young. You are one of the few blessed with the power of sight prophesized to take back the world from the beasts above and reclaim the power over the tower that the beasts took so long ago.\n\nWhen the new king rose to power, the immortal and bloodthirsty warrior's first order of business was to kill those who opposed him on the royal council. The king sought to put their heads on pikes as a warning to all who dared speak against him. Hunted and battered, the royal council dissenters were thinned out one by one, until seemingly the only member left was you. You desperately want to murder the king, but killing an immortal requires a magic far beyond your comprehension. You journey to the other side of the world to seek the help of a witch once shunned for her practice of necromancy. She agrees to help you and gives you a simple dagger with a crimson blade, which she says is the embodiment of your vengeance. You thank her for the weapon and return to the king's palace. At nightfall, you sneak into the royal bedchambers while the king is sleeping and slit his throat with the crimson dagger. The king grabs his gushing neck but does not bleed out. Instead, the king begins to rot, his immortal youth giving way to decay. Hearing the commotion, the king's guardsman rushes into the bedchamber. Without warning, the king lunges at him and bites him, initiating the same horrible transformation. The cursed blade did not kill the immortal king but rather made him both living and dead at the same time. Now, through your act of revenge, you have unleashed a living dead plague upon the land that will bring your kingdom to its knees.\n\nYou rip the head off of your latest victim and feel the surge of warmth as the victim's soul is consumed by the dark magic that preserves you. But as always, the cold creeps back in as you hunger for yet another soul. You were once a warrior, a champion among men who defended your kingdom against the forces of evil. Injured during a great battle, you were taken back to the stronghold and told that you would never walk again. You accepted your fate, but your king would have none of it. He implored his court mage to cast a spell—any spell—that would grant his greatest warrior the ability to fight again. The mage went through his spell book, found something that would do as the king asked, and then tried to explain the consequences. Uninterested in the details, the king ordered the mage to begin the ritual. When the mage was done, you felt strong yet empty, as if you were just a husk of who you once were. Then the hunger set in and, in an instant, you ripped the king apart, quickly followed by the mage and anyone else who dared cross your path.\n\nWhen the monsters descended upon your kingdom, they brought an infectious plague. They poured from portals, slimy bipedal beasts with no eyes and too many teeth roaring through the streets. Their single touch killed instantaneously, leaving behind bodies just as infectious. With the king dead and the beasts on the prowl, you quickly realize that you must protect yourself and your fellow villagers. As the local blacksmith, you armor your neighbors as heavily as you can, making sure that they have enough coverage on their bodies to kill these beasts with no contact. But as supplies run short and their numbers grow, you and your small group must find a way to kill these beasts at their source, journeying beyond the safety of your barricaded base.\n\nFor two long years you searched deep within the Fagaras Mountains for what many thought was just legend: a simple door standing alone in the middle of a clearing. Before you embarked on your search, you were a blacksmith with a loving wife and three children. You had become a prominent and respected member of your village, but nothing was never enough. You always wanted more than what you were due, so one day you decided to throw your stable life away. You abandoned your wife, your children, and everything else you once held dear to search for the door. But when your supplies were running short, you returned to town in the dead of night and stole whatever you could get your hands on. When one of your former neighbors cornered you, you killed him in cold blood and ran back to the mountains. However, all of it was worth it now that you have found the door. According to the legend, if you open the door and enter, you will be granted what you truly deserve. Knowing deep down that you deserve it all, you open the door.\n\nFairy Tale\n\nMotifs from fairy tales, particularly those from the Brothers Grimm, are reinterpreted with a new perspective. Redefining traditional fairy tale roles, such as the humble protagonist and the evil villain, are mainstays for these types of stories.\n\nThere was an old lady who lived in a shoe until its owner returned. After a long hibernation, the giant came down from the mountain to find his forgotten left boot inhabited with pests. Enraged, he gave the old woman and her many children three days to vacate the shoe. Panicked, the mother didn't know what to do. However, her children hatched a plot. They attacked the giant when he returned in three days and demanded that he let them keep their beloved—albeit stinky—home.\n\nYou are a 20-year-old woman working with your uncle at his logging company during the summer. It's not your ideal choice for spending your time, but it is a refreshing change in scenery for you. On your days off, you explore the nearby town and the surrounding woods, although you have been warned not to go out after dark due to the increasing number of wild animal attacks in the area. For the most part, you heed this warning. There isn't much to do anyhow, so you spend most of your time reading in the local diner. You make friends with one waitress who works there, a punk-looking girl with bright red hair and a combative attitude who wants nothing more than to leave the town. You become close. But a few weeks later, your friend goes missing. Despite your search, people have no idea where she's gone, some even claiming that they don't know her entirely. When she suddenly returns the following month, with a different attitude and an unfamiliar wardrobe, you are naturally suspicious. The more you look at her, the more unlike herself she looks. Where there once were freckles, there are none. The piercings she had are completely gone and have even healed without a trace. The worst part? Her eyes are an entirely different color. Convinced that this is not your friend, you decide to find out what exactly happened to her in an attempt to get her back — if she's not already gone forever.\n\nThere are many things that you take pride in: your success, your possessions, your beauty. But the one thing you take the most pride in is your Tinder desirability ranking. A friend of yours who works at Tinder has been letting you look at the desirability rankings of everybody in your city. A couple of months ago, you decided to start using a powerful glamour charm that you found on Etsy and, after week of wearing it around town, your desirability ranking shot up to the number one position. You have felt like the belle of the ball ever since. Today, however, your heart sinks when your friend sends over the latest rankings with a sad emoji. You have fallen to number two. A girl who has just moved into the city has taken the top spot. You look her up online and find out that she works at an animal shelter and rents a townhouse with seven male roommates. What a weirdo! You vow to take back your top spot by any means necessary.\n\nYou and your brother are the children of a notorious thief who became famous by stealing everything from pocket change to valuable jewels. After a particularly risky job gone south, your father retired from the thieving business, teaching you and your brother to steal only when you absolutely need it. But when your father falls ill with a fever and there is no one else to provide for your small family, you and your brother take up the forbidden family business. It starts with small things from the market—fruits and vegetables, an occasional loaf of bread—but you and your brother become greedy and, despite your father's warnings, take things you don't need, such as odds and ends from travelling merchants and even finer items from the marketplace. One day with your pockets already sufficiently stuffed with stolen goods, you and your brother venture to the a little goldsmith shop run by an old lady on the edge of the marketplace. Her shop's walls are lined with expensive trinkets and jewelry; any of them would provide enough coin to buy medicine for your father and put food on the table for months to come. You decide on an ornate golden candy jar in the shape of a gingerbread house and silently slip it into your bag. As you are leaving, the old woman tuts at you, waving her hand and slamming the door shut. She cackles as you look at her with shock, hobbling toward you with magic crackling at her fingertips. You have stolen from the wrong witch.\n\nThe king has invited every young lady to attend a ball being held at the castle tonight. You are brimming with anticipation for the evening, but your stepsister, Cinderella, is heartbroken as your mother has forbidden her to go to the ball. You sympathize with Cinderella, but you fear your mother's cruelty and hold your tongue. Your thoughts are elsewhere, anyway. You met the king's son, Prince Charming, by chance a few days ago, and the two of you felt the first stirrings of love. Perhaps if you dance with the prince at the ball tonight you will secure your future as his bride. When you arrive at the castle, you enter the ballroom to find the prince already dancing with a young woman in an exquisite blue gown. You immediately recognize her as Cinderella. You approach the dance floor and notice Cinderella blowing a shimmering pink dust into the prince's face. He gazes at her with a vacant expression. Prince Charming has been captured by a love spell, and you must do everything in your power to break the spell before the prince marries your evil stepsister.\n\nVirtual reality has taken the world by storm, making anything that can be imagined possible in a simulated existence. For some, this is a form of entertainment; for others, it becomes a lifelong obsession. Your wife is determined to live in a fantasy world. She develops a virtual reality system called Maleficent that not only ties directly into the nervous system, but also handles all basic human needs while the person is engaged in the system. In other words, this platform allows an individual to live within a virtual environment in perpetuity. She tests her invention on herself and lives inside her virtual fantasy existence for weeks on end. You are determined to pull your wife out of her virtual reality slumber and shut down the Maleficent platform once and for all.\n\nYou are the son of a wealthy divorced couple who own a well-known stuffed toy brand. Despite being divorced, your parents' opposite natures make them excellent business partners. Your father has always been able to strike a deal with his strong, imposing nature, while your mother is able to forge and maintain business relationships using her soft, kind demeanor. You yourself are a perfect mix of the two and, as their only child, you have not only tested hundreds of stuffed toys, but are also next in line to inherit their plushie empire. But trouble strikes when you hear news of a spy infiltrating your boardroom. You make it your mission to follow the trail of evidence to ferret out the traitor. Your parents are sure the spy has been tampering with things in their offices, giving you enough evidence to host a stakeout of your own. After hours of waiting, you finally catch the perpetrator on the CCTV: a middle-aged attorney on the board of directors whom you've only met in passing. You watch as she paws through your files, looking through the stuffed animal prototypes and finding the ones that were deemed \"just right.\" Then her bracelet falls off accidentally, causing her appearance to suddenly change. You zoom in on her face and discover that she is the curly haired CEO from a competing company. She quickly puts her bracelet back on and leaves the room. You try rewatching the video and find that nothing was recorded, as if the entire incident never happened. You must gather evidence and make sure that her plot to steal these prototypes comes to an end.\n\nYou're the eldest of three brothers, if only by two minutes. But it counts enough that it puts you in charge. As triplets, you do everything together, including running this city — not legally, of course, but where's the fun in that? Prohibition is a godsend, making you and your brothers incredibly rich and powerful almost overnight, and you're affectionately known as the Three Little Pigs, which also happens to be the name of your speakeasy. But being on top doesn't come without its problems. There's always some hotshot who thinks he can take on the Three Little Pigs. Until now, you and your brothers have made a meal out of anyone stupid enough to try, further cementing your reputation as the most dangerous men in the city. Yet, there are whispers of one who could be your undoing. All you know of him is that he goes by the name of Frank \"The Wolf\" Corozzo. To some, \"The Big Bad.\" He's left a long line of bodies in his wake while taking over gin joint after gin joint, and now he's coming your way. You and your brothers have worked hard to get where you are. The last thing you want is some mafia outsider taking over your territory.
