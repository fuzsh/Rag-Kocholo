        "text": "Scene 3\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe three witches greet Macbeth as “Thane of Glamis” (as he is), “Thane of Cawdor,” and “king hereafter.” They then promise Banquo that he will father kings, and they disappear. Almost as soon as they are gone, Ross and Angus arrive with news that the king has named Macbeth “Thane of Cawdor.” Macbeth contemplates killing Duncan in order to become “king hereafter” as the witches have called him.\n\nThunder. Enter the three Witches.\n\nFIRST WITCH 0092 Where hast thou been, sister?\n\nSECOND WITCH 0093 Killing swine.\n\nTHIRD WITCH 0094 Sister, where thou?\n\nFIRST WITCH\n\n0095 A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap\n\n0096 5 And munched and munched and munched. “Give\n\n0097 me,” quoth I.\n\n0098 “Aroint thee, witch,” the rump-fed runnion cries.\n\np. 15\n\n0099 Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ Tiger;\n\n0100 But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,\n\n0101 10 And, like a rat without a tail,\n\n0102 I’ll do, I’ll do, and I’ll do.\n\nSECOND WITCH\n\n0103 I’ll give thee a wind.\n\nFIRST WITCH\n\n0104 Th’ art kind.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\n\n0105 And I another.\n\nFIRST WITCH\n\n0106 15 I myself have all the other,\n\n0107 And the very ports they blow;\n\n0108 All the quarters that they know\n\n0109 I’ th’ shipman’s card.\n\n0110 I’ll drain him dry as hay.\n\n0111 20 Sleep shall neither night nor day\n\n0112 Hang upon his penthouse lid.\n\n0113 He shall live a man forbid.\n\n0114 Weary sev’nnights, nine times nine,\n\n0115 Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.\n\n0116 25 Though his bark cannot be lost,\n\n0117 Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.\n\n0118 Look what I have.\n\nSECOND WITCH 0119 Show me, show me.\n\nFIRST WITCH\n\n0120 Here I have a pilot’s thumb,\n\n0121 30 Wracked as homeward he did come.Drum within.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\n\n0122 A drum, a drum!\n\n0123 Macbeth doth come.\n\nALL, ⌜dancing in a circle⌝\n\n0124 The Weïrd Sisters, hand in hand,\n\n0125 Posters of the sea and land,\n\n0126 35 Thus do go about, about,\n\n0127 Thrice to thine and thrice to mine\n\np. 17\n\n0128 And thrice again, to make up nine.\n\n0129 Peace, the charm’s wound up.\n\nEnter Macbeth and Banquo.\n\nMACBETH\n\n0130 So foul and fair a day I have not seen.\n\nBANQUO\n\n0131 40 How far is ’t called to ⌜Forres?⌝—What are these,\n\n0132 So withered, and so wild in their attire,\n\n0133 That look not like th’ inhabitants o’ th’ Earth\n\n0134 And yet are on ’t?—Live you? Or are you aught\n\n0135 That man may question? You seem to understand\n\n0136 45 me\n\n0137 By each at once her choppy finger laying\n\n0138 Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,\n\n0139 And yet your beards forbid me to interpret\n\n0140 That you are so.\n\nMACBETH 0141 50 Speak if you can. What are you?\n\nFIRST WITCH\n\n0142 All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!\n\nSECOND WITCH\n\n0143 All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!\n\nTHIRD WITCH\n\n0144 All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!\n\nBANQUO\n\n0145 Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear\n\n0146 55 Things that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truth,\n\n0147 Are you fantastical, or that indeed\n\n0148 Which outwardly you show? My noble partner\n\n0149 You greet with present grace and great prediction\n\n0150 Of noble having and of royal hope,\n\n0151 60 That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.\n\n0152 If you can look into the seeds of time\n\n0153 And say which grain will grow and which will not,\n\n0154 Speak, then, to me, who neither beg nor fear\n\n0155 Your favors nor your hate.\n\np. 19\n\nFIRST WITCH 0156 65Hail!\n\nSECOND WITCH 0157 Hail!\n\nTHIRD WITCH 0158 Hail!\n\nFIRST WITCH\n\n0159 Lesser than Macbeth and greater.\n\nSECOND WITCH\n\n0160 Not so happy, yet much happier.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\n\n0161 70 Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.\n\n0162 So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\n\nFIRST WITCH\n\n0163 Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!\n\nMACBETH\n\n0164 Stay, you imperfect speakers. Tell me more.\n\n0165 By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis.\n\n0166 75 But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives\n\n0167 A prosperous gentleman, and to be king\n\n0168 Stands not within the prospect of belief,\n\n0169 No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\n\n0170 You owe this strange intelligence or why\n\n0171 80 Upon this blasted heath you stop our way\n\n0172 With such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you.\n\nWitches vanish.\n\nBANQUO\n\n0173 The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\n\n0174 And these are of them. Whither are they vanished?\n\nMACBETH\n\n0175 Into the air, and what seemed corporal melted,\n\n0176 85 As breath into the wind. Would they had stayed!\n\nBANQUO\n\n0177 Were such things here as we do speak about?\n\n0178 Or have we eaten on the insane root\n\n0179 That takes the reason prisoner?\n\nMACBETH\n\n0180 Your children shall be kings.\n\nBANQUO 0181 90 You shall be king.\n\np. 21\n\nMACBETH\n\n0182 And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?\n\nBANQUO\n\n0183 To th’ selfsame tune and words.—Who’s here?\n\nEnter Ross and Angus.\n\nROSS\n\n0184 The King hath happily received, Macbeth,\n\n0185 The news of thy success, and, when he reads\n\n0186 95 Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,\n\n0187 His wonders and his praises do contend\n\n0188 Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,\n\n0189 In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day\n\n0190 He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,\n\n0191 100 Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,\n\n0192 Strange images of death. As thick as tale\n\n0193 ⌜Came⌝ post with post, and every one did bear\n\n0194 Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense,\n\n0195 And poured them down before him.\n\nANGUS 0196 105 We are sent\n\n0197 To give thee from our royal master thanks,\n\n0198 Only to herald thee into his sight,\n\n0199 Not pay thee.\n\nROSS\n\n0200 And for an earnest of a greater honor,\n\n0201 110 He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor,\n\n0202 In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,\n\n0203 For it is thine.\n\nBANQUO 0204 What, can the devil speak true?\n\nMACBETH\n\n0205 The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me\n\n0206 115 In borrowed robes?\n\nANGUS 0207 Who was the Thane lives yet,\n\n0208 But under heavy judgment bears that life\n\n0209 Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was\n\n0210 combined\n\np. 23\n\n0211 120 With those of Norway, or did line the rebel\n\n0212 With hidden help and vantage, or that with both\n\n0213 He labored in his country’s wrack, I know not;\n\n0214 But treasons capital, confessed and proved,\n\n0215 Have overthrown him.\n\nMACBETH, ⌜aside⌝ 0216 125 Glamis and Thane of Cawdor!\n\n0217 The greatest is behind. ⌜To Ross and Angus.⌝ Thanks\n\n0218 for your pains.\n\n0219 ⌜Aside to Banquo.⌝ Do you not hope your children\n\n0220 shall be kings,\n\n0221 130 When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me\n\n0222 Promised no less to them?\n\nBANQUO 0223 That, trusted home,\n\n0224 Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,\n\n0225 Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange.\n\n0226 135 And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,\n\n0227 The instruments of darkness tell us truths,\n\n0228 Win us with honest trifles, to betray ’s\n\n0229 In deepest consequence.—\n\n0230 Cousins, a word, I pray you.⌜They step aside.⌝\n\nMACBETH, ⌜aside⌝ 0231 140 Two truths are told\n\n0232 As happy prologues to the swelling act\n\n0233 Of the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.\n\n0234 ⌜Aside.⌝ This supernatural soliciting\n\n0235 Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,\n\n0236 145 Why hath it given me earnest of success\n\n0237 Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\n\n0238 If good, why do I yield to that suggestion\n\n0239 Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair\n\n0240 And make my seated heart knock at my ribs\n\n0241 150 Against the use of nature? Present fears\n\n0242 Are less than horrible imaginings.\n\n0243 My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\n\n0244 Shakes so my single state of man\n\n0245 That function is smothered in surmise,\n\n0246 155 And nothing is but what is not.\n\np. 25\n\nBANQUO 0247 Look how our partner’s rapt.\n\nMACBETH, ⌜aside⌝\n\n0248 If chance will have me king, why, chance may\n\n0249 crown me\n\n0250 Without my stir.\n\nBANQUO 0251 160 New honors come upon him,\n\n0252 Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mold\n\n0253 But with the aid of use.\n\nMACBETH, ⌜aside⌝ 0254 Come what come may,\n\n0255 Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.\n\nBANQUO\n\n0256 165 Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\n\nMACBETH\n\n0257 Give me your favor. My dull brain was wrought\n\n0258 With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\n\n0259 Are registered where every day I turn\n\n0260 The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.\n\n0261 170⌜Aside to Banquo.⌝ Think upon what hath chanced,\n\n0262 and at more time,\n\n0263 The interim having weighed it, let us speak\n\n0264 Our free hearts each to other.\n\nBANQUO 0265 Very gladly.\n\nMACBETH 0266 175Till then, enough.—Come, friends.\n\nThey exit."
