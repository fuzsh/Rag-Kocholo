Harboring a grudge against all men (and not without reason), Anne becomes \"Captain Providence,\" one of the most notorious pirate leaders of the Spanish Main. Anne is pursued by French captain Pierre la Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), who intends to bring her to justice. To this end, La Rochelle makes romantic overtures to Anne, but she gloms onto his scheme and abducts the captain and his wife Molly (Debra Paget). After leaving her victims to die on a desert island, Anne relents and rescues them. She later fully redeems herself (at great personal cost) during a battle with her fiercest rival, Blackbeard (Thomas Gomez). Few actresses could have pulled off the contrarily-written title character in Anne of the Indies with as much determination and conviction as Jean Peters; surprisingly, the actress was reportedly never comfortable before the cameras, often insisting that she'd rather be a schoolteacher! ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1961\n\nMade in: Italy\n\nLength: 87 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: Italian (English version is dubbed)\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Romance\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Redhead Mary is a girl who dresses like a man to better approach, and rob the jewels worn by the pretty ladies of her time. The King's Guard captures her, and she finds herself in the same cell with Peter Goodwin, a nobleman - who pretends to be a robber like her, to flirt with her. After her evasion, Mary goes up the ladder in her criminal life - becoming a good pirate under captain Poof. When the captain dies, the only 'man' aboard who is respected by every faction among the pirates is... Mary. She represents a menace to the Florida Governor, who invites a nobleman to lead the King's naval forces against the pirates: Peter Goodwin.\n\nReleased: 1926\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 85 Minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nFormat: Colorized\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: The Black Pirate is a 1926 adventure silent film shot entirely in Technicolor which tells the story of a young nobleman who infiltrates a ship full of pirates to avenge his father's death.\n\nThe film stars Douglas Fairbanks, Donald Crisp, Sam De Grasse and Billie Dove. In one long, dramatic scene, Fairbanks acting alone seizes a merchant ship. In another famous scene, he sticks his dagger into the mainsail and rides it all the way down from top to bottom, cutting the sail in half as he goes.\n\nWorth noting, the film features many special effects, including some spectacular models of sailing ships. The Black Pirate was the third feature to be filmed in an early two-color Technicolor process that had been first introduced in the 1922 feature Toll of the Sea. This reproduces a limited but pleasing range of colors. The script was adapted by Jack Cunningham from a story by Fairbanks, who used his middle names \"Elton Thomas\" as a pseudonym.\n\nThis film was directed by Albert Parker and has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nReleased: 1926\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 6 Reels\n\nRated: G\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Tod and Tom Pembroke (both Ince) are twin brothers who are divinity students. Both of them love Ruth Featherstone, the dean's daughter (Dorothy Dunbar), but Tod is expelled and since he knows Ruth loves Tom, he leaves for China. Years later, after Tom has graduated and married Ruth, he travels to the island of Paroa to establish a mission. But difficulties arise when he catches island fever and the ship is captured by the notorious pirate, Blaze Devine. Devine, however, turns out to be Tod, and when he discovers his brother's plans, he goes to Paroa in his place. Bully Rawden, the head trader on the island (Alphonz Ethier), is determined to keep any missionaries away. While Tod is busy trying to vanquish him, his daughter, Marietta (Margaret Livingston), falls in love with him. After a lot of fighting between Tod and Bully's men, they come to an agreement -- Bully will allow a missionary on the island if Tod's pirate crew stops pillaging his ships. Tom, fully recovered, takes his place on the island and when Tod leaves, he finds that Marietta has stowed away on his ship. ~ Janiss Garza, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1924\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 20 Minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: The silent, two-reel Our Gang comedy The Buccaneers was originally released on March 9, 1924.\n\nAs the film's title suggests, the gang decides to become pirates, but their jerry-built galleon sinks to the bottom of the harbor the moment it's christened with a ketchup bottle. Undaunted, the kids stow away on Captain Whelan's scow and before long find themselves on the high seas. Rescued by a passing Navy battleship, the kids are immediately put to work by the captain, who intends to discourage the youngsters from yearning for a life at sea.\n\nAlthough the kids manage to elude the captain and the crew, they're not so lucky when their parents catch up with them. A subplot involves the efforts by fat Joe Cobb to deliver a package of fish -- which mysteriously disappears thanks to a pack of hungry felines. An abbreviated version of The Buccaneers, re-titled The Pirates, was included in the Mischief Makers TV package in 1960. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1960\n\nMade in: Italy\n\nLength: 111 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Good swashbuckler set in France by the time King Louis XIII was just a teenager. It seems that nobody wants to see him sitting on the throne, including his lovely mother. But there is a loyal nobleman who will fight bravely to put things in order.\n\nLegendary French actor Jean Marais is a bit too old to play the hero but he tries hard and really does a good job. As the comic relief, comedian Bourvil plays the street artist who helps Marais in his mission. Fencing and action sequences don't look as great as in Errol Flynn's classics but the old castles are real and \"Le Capitan\" provides a good fun for its audience. By the way, English title \"Captain Blood\" makes no sense; this captain has no relation neither to 1935 Hollywood classic nor to Rafael Sabatini's novel (this one is based on Michel Zevaco's histories).\n\nReleased: 1924\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 110 Minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Although the Warner Bros. version of Rafael Sabatini's novel made Errol Flynn a star in 1935, it wasn't the first time the romantic adventure was made into a film.\n\nJ. Warren Kerrigan starred as Peter Blood, the physician turned pirate in this silent Vitagraph version. Peter Blood gets lumped in with a group of rebels who have plotted against King James and is sent to the island of Barbados as a slave. He is purchased, along with his friend, Jeremy Pitt (James Morrison), by Colonel Bishop (Wilfred North), at the request of his willful niece, Arabella (Jean Paige).\n\nWhen a Spanish ship takes over the town, Blood leads the slaves and captures the vessel. After becoming the terror of the seas (but never attacking an English ship), Blood and his men rescue Lord Wade (Allan Forrest) and Arabella from a burning ship. When William III ascends to the British throne, Blood aligns himself with the new king, defeats the French fleet and saves Port Royal. He is appointed governor of Jamaica for his heroic deeds, and finally wins the hand of Arabella. ~ Janiss Garza, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1935\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 119 Minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: This is one of my favorite pirate movie & the film that helped Errol Flynn make a name for himself. And, it's an earlier teaming of Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and director Michael Curtiz than The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) too. The film was Oscar nominated, as was Curtiz and its Writing. Also see Guy Kibbee as one of Flynn's compatriots. Dr. Peter Blood (Flynn) is convicted of treason for treating an enemy of the king. He is sold into slavery where he meets, and is temporarily saved by a beautiful woman (de Havilland), the daughter of the man (Lionel Atwill) in control of the island where he is taken. But Blood leads the other slaves on an escape. They steal a boat, and become successful pirates with Blood as their captain. Of course, he must be pursued, and he must rescue de Havilland from Rathbone, and eventually the pirates become involved on the right side of the war between their former Britain and France. The film is a must see for ANY pirate enthusiast!\n\nReleased: 1936\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 66 Minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: In the South Seas, Bill Jones (George Houston), captain of the schooner \"Marigold\", is known as Captain Calamity as he is quick to fight or frolic. Stone broke on the island of Quica and with his ship in need or re-stocking, Bill accepts an ancient Spanish doubloon from a young Australian named Carr (Barry Norton)in exchange for taking him to Tapillo, where Carr can take a ship to Sidney.\n\nBill gives the doubloon to trader Joblin (Louis Natheaux)for supplies, and does not bother to correct the trader's impression that he has found a fabulous horde of pirate gold. With Madame Gruen (Margaret Irving), a slatternly jade who runs a waterfront boarding house, and Samson (the ever-oily Roy D'Arcy), her paramour, Joblin schemes to seize Captain Bill's supposed treasure trove.\n\nTogether, they gather a a crew of cutthroats, led by Black Pierre (George J. Lewis), leader of the scum of the waterfront dives, to seize the treasure. Bill also meets Dr. Kelkey (Crane Wilbur), loser in many bouts with a brandy bottle, and his ward, Madge Lewis (Marian Nixon), on a mission to find the man who murdered and robbed her father in Australia. Bill agrees to help her, but does not remember her as the young girl he had saved from a sinking ship a dozen years before.\n\nReleased: 1922\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 31 Episode Serial\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Serial, 31 reels\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: One of few surviving examples of a once-prolific serial king's work. First, Captain Kidd and his pirates in a shipboard battle, then, a thrilling modern-day fire sequence as Eddie tries to rescue a lady from a burning building. I'm assuming that this serial included action in both the past and the present; otherwise this scene must be from another Polo serial. It's still exciting though, no matter where it originated.\n\nSurvival Status: Prints exist in the Library of Congress film archive [episodes 1, 2, 5, 13 and 14], in the International Museum of Photography and Film at George Eastman House film archive [episode 13], in the UCLA Film & Television Archive film archive [episode 2], in the Academy Film Archive film archive [unidentified episode, 16mm reduction positive], and in the Filmoteca Espanola film archive [unidentified episode, 35mm positive]; the film is presumed lost.\n\nReleased: 1954\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 89 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: What a great title...but it all goes downhill pretty fast from there on out. Anthony Dexter, who had essayed the title role in the 1951 biopic Valentino, plays a beardless Captain Kidd. Eva Gabor, who would later costar with Arnold the Pig on TV's Green Acres, is the slave girl.\n\nGabor has been dispatched by the villains to seduce Kidd and determine the whereabouts of the pirate's legendary buried treasure. She falls in love with him instead, standing by his side as he fights his way through reels and reels of stock footage from old Hollywood swashbucklers. Captain Kidd and the Slave Girl was produced by Edward Small--and is \"small\" in every sense of the word. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1992\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 100 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Comedy, Family\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: I fully realize that no-one else in the world liked this movie but me, but I loved it. The only thing I would have done differently is replace Martin Short with anyone else - maybe Chevy Chase?\n\nAfter Martin Short's character inherits a yacht, he totes his dysfunctional family from suburban Chicago to the Caribbean to claim it. Not having any skill at boating, he hires long-haired, one-eyed low-life Captain Ron to pilot the heap to Miami. During the journey, the somewhat inept sailor frequently loses his way while becoming a hit with everyone in the family - except Martin.\n\nKurt Russel is phenomenal as the grizzled sea captain in this movie - Hollywood should definitely make a pirate film with him in it!\n\nReleased: 1963\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 91 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Carry On Jack was the first historical epic in the \"Carry On\" series, but was also probably the most forgettable. Its not so much that it is a bad film, but it lacks the spirit of the later Carry On's, probably as there are so many of the regulars missing - there's no Sid James, Joan Sims, Barbara Windsor, Hattie Jaques or Kenneth Connor. Only Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey are the main regulars to be featured in this chapter, though Jim Dale (starred in many of the 1960's Carry On's) has a cameo role.\n\nBernard Cribbins blends in with the cast as though he'd always been a regular, plays Albert Poop-Decker, an unlucky man, who after years of struggle, finally wins his commission only to have his identity, rank and uniform stolen from him by Sally (Juliet Mills) who he soon falls in love with.\n\nThe historical accuracy is impressive with the sets and the costumes but this Carry On film misses its mark slightly though Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey are on fine form throughout. An adequate comedy.\n\nReleased: 1925\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 90 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: After his impressive screen debut in Sally, stage comedian Leon Errol became a full-fledged film star with this picture, set in New England's colonial days. Tidd (Errol) is a henpecked tailor who secretly dreams of being a pirate. In fact, he even makes himself a pirate costume, which unnerves his wife, Betsy (Dorothy Gish). He winds up hiding in a small boat, where he is found by a rough crew and mistaken for notorious pirate chief Dixie Bull. He is taken on board where he gets to live out his dreams. Betsy and Tidd's niece, Nancy Downs (Edna Murphy), board the Frolic in their search for Tidd, and their vessel gets in a battle with the pirate ship. Tidd wins and demands that the women be handed over -- of course, they are Betsy, Nancy, and a vamp, Madame LaTour (Nita Naldi). Tidd finally comes face-to-face with the real Dixie Bull (Walter Law) and he agrees to a duel. When Bull trips and falls, Tidd leaps on him and declares himself the victor. The truth is he is more than happy to go back to his normal, bland life, with one change -- now he can order his wife around. Dorothy Gish's then-husband, James Rennie, has a supporting role as Nancy's sweetheart. ~ Janiss Garza, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1985\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 100 Minutes\n\nRated: R\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure, Comedy\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Filmed on location \"Somewhere in France\", this umpteenth version of Dumas' The Corsican Brothers stars the zoned-out comedy team of Cheech and Chong. Perhaps inspired by the Ritz Bros.' spin on The Three Musketeers, the duo retains enough of the original story (about twin brothers who feel one another's pain) to keep the plot going, but try to inject their own peculiar brand of humor throughout. The film's highlight is a duel with two loaves of stale bread. Yes, that's the highlight. Just as the 1930s comedy team of Wheeler and Woolsey lost their audience when they dropped their risque humor and Prohibition gags, so too do Cheech and Chong falter when not indulging in the drug-oriented comedy which made them famous in the early 1970s. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1952\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 104 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure, Comedy\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Released well after Douglas Fairbanks's and Errol Flynn's heydays, this way too cheesy good-natured Burt Lancaster vehicle is, nevertheless, a good example of the classic (albeit a little campy) swashbuckler film genre.\n\nSet in the 16th century, along the Spanish Main, this lusty adventure both expands on and explodes genre conventions. Lancaster, a circus acrobat before turning to movies in the '40s, gives what may be his most physical performance as sword-for-hire Captain Vallo, a.k.a. the Crimson Pirate.\n\nNick Cravat, Lancaster's real-life circus buddy, matches the star leap for leap, somersault for somersault as Vallo's mute sidekick. The fetching Eva Bartok causes Vallo to throw over the Spanish for rebel forces, and a young Christopher Lee demonstrates the swordsmanship that would later make him a natural in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.\n\nDirector Robert Siodmak, known for his claustrophobic noir thrillers (1946's The Killers), handled most of the interiors, while Lancaster coordinated the tongue-in-cheek humor and macho derring-do. The broadly played action scenes, including the climactic 18-minute battle aboard a frigate, wouldn't be improved on for another three decades--by Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark. The big difference: Harrison Ford needed a stunt double, Lancaster didn't.\n\nReleased: 1995\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 123 Minutes\n\nRated: PG-13\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: A lot of people have some very negative things to say about this movie, but in the end I want to give it credit for single handedly reviving the dead industry of high-budget full blown Pirate movies. Plus if you get past the holes in the plot and terrible ending it's actually a pretty fun movie to watch.\n\nMorgan Adams (Geena Davis) and her slave, William Shaw (Matthew Modine), are on a quest to recover the three portions of a treasure map. Unfortunately, the final portion is held by her murderous uncle, Dawg (Frank Langella). Her crew is sceptical of her leadership abilities, so she must complete her quest before they mutiny against her.

Daphne La Tour (Gish), is the daughter of a destitute French nobleman in the early 18th century. Because he is the favorite at the king's court, Philip de Mornay (Elliot Dexter) can probably have any woman he wants, but he likes Daphne's audacity. So he orders his men to kidnap her and take her to the home of Franchette, a popular madam (Lucile Young). But before he can fetch her, he is forced to flee and is captured by pirates. Meanwhile, Franchette's place is overtaken by soldiers who are rounding up women to send to Louisiana, where wives are sorely needed. Daphne is among the young ladies captured, but the ship they are on is attacked by the pirates. Daphne helps save the day for the Frenchmen, and as a result, she saves Philip's life. Although she has been sold to Jamie D'Arcy (Walter Long), she nevertheless manages to marry Philip when they reach Louisiana. ~ Janiss Garza, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1976\n\nMade in: UK\n\nLength: 81 Minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nFormat: Color (Technicolor)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Action, Suspense\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: It is surprising that Dick Deadeye has largely disappeared without a trace.

The story is fine for a cartoon, but there are a LOT of musical moments with updated versions of well known G&S songs, plus a few new ones. 'The Moon & I' sung by Linda Lewis was even a minor hit in 1976, but this didn't seem to help the film receive greater viewing audiences.\n\nIt did not receive a full UK distribution, but did play in selected 'art house' cinemas, then disappeared without a trace.

While recuperating, Michael learns that his father has been executed by the Spaniards. Devastated, he flees home to England in a rickety fishing boat and reports the news to Queen Elizabeth, urging her to attack Spain. Queen Elizabeth is impressed by the young man's patriotism and sends Michael back to Spain with orders to enter King Philip's court as a spy. Once here, he uncovers a plot to assassinate Elizabeth, but is eventually recognized by the Spaniards and imprisoned. Once again, with help from his captors, Michael escapes -- making it back to England just in time to warn the Queen and participate in an attack on the mighty Armada.\n\nReleased: 1985\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 114 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Children, Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: The Goonies tells the tale of a group of young teens who are desperate to find a way to prevent their homes from being gobbled up by an obnoxious local developer in order to build a golf course on the site.

Sir Joseph Porter, who is fully aware of his own importance, is an arrogant snob who feels that Josephine is far beneath him on the social scale. However, contemptuous though he feels about this factor, he will overlook the fact that she is just a humble Captain's daughter and that he would therefore be marrying beneath his rank.

Originally telecast in the United States as a three-hour TV film on January 31, 1984, the production subsequently aired on Scottish television as a six-part miniseries, 25 minutes per episode. On this occasion, the roles of rival siblings Henry and James Durrie were played by Richard Thomas and Michael York. The basic story remained the same: In 18th century Scotland, a toss of the coin determined that Henry would enlist in the service of Bonnie Prince Charlie, while James would stay behind as temporary master of Ballantrae Hall. Reported killed in battle, Henry spent the next several years trying to reclaim his birthright from his covetous brother.

Reeves mistakenly embraces her in a barn and is sent packing to a Spanish war galleon by the governor as a result - presumably never to be heard from again. After leading a slave revolt on a ship, Reeves takes over and forms his own pirate band with him becoming the captain. On a raid Reeves discovers the governor's daughter has been captured on another pirate raid and he is smitten with her and \"wins\" her in a battle with another pirate captain.

After being set free by Reeves (Capt Morgan) she realizes she truly loves him and longs to see him again. After a failed attempt to capture the city of Panama in a raid, it appears Morgan has drowned.....alas..Morgan is alive and then in another back entrance raid he and his pirate band capture the city and reunites with Lagrange.

Clark Gable stars as Fletcher Christian, first mate of the infamous HMS Bounty, skippered by Captain William Bligh (Charles Laughton), the cruelest taskmaster on the Seven Seas. Bligh's villainy knows no bounds: he is even willing to flog a dead man if it will strengthen his hold over the crew. Christian despises Bligh and is sailing on the Bounty under protest. During the journey back to England, Bligh's cruelties become more than Christian can bear; and after the captain indirectly causes the death of the ship's doctor, the crew stages a mutiny, with Christian in charge. Bligh and a handful of officers loyal to him are set adrift in an open boat. Through sheer force of will, he guides the tiny vessel on a 49-day, 4000-mile journey to the Dutch East Indies without losing a man. Historians differ on whether Captain Bligh was truly such a monster or Christian such a paragon of virtue (some believe that the mutiny was largely inspired by Christian's lust for the Tahitian girls). The movie struck gold at the box office, and, in addition to the Best Picture Oscar, Gable, Laughton, and Franchot Tone as one of the Bounty's crew were all nominated for Best Actor (they all lost to Victor McLaglan in The Informer). The film was remade (badly) in 1962 and adapted into the \"revisionist\" 1984 feature The Bounty with Mel Gibson as Fletcher Christian and Anthony Hopkins as Captain Bligh. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1980\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 130 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: This fourth film dramatization of the 1789 mutiny aboard the H.M.S. Bounty is based not on the familiar Nordhoff and Hall book, but on Richard Hough's novel Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian. This time, the infamous Captain Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) is as strict a disciplinarian as ever. He is, however, no monster; faced with his crew's increasing laxity after an idyllic visit to Tahiti (the search for breadfruit takes second place to limitless sex with the island girls), Bligh is forced to resort to flogging and other such means to keep his men in line. Mr. Christian (Mel Gibson), formerly Bligh's friend, is of little use to the captain, having fallen in love with a native girl himself. Christian becomes the leader of the mutiny virtually in spite of himself; and when the mutineers try to seek refuge on Tahiti, they find that the local chief wants no part of them, which is why they settle for the nearly uninhabitable Pitcairn. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1983\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 100 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: After wiping out half a village of native South Pacific tribesmen, Captain Bully Hayes (Tommy Lee Jones) is eventually captured, put in prison, and the rest of this swashbuckling action film is told in a series of flashbacks as he remembers the recent past. The lead-in scene may be off-putting, but its larger context is soon revealed. Hayes had just left a young couple, Nate (Michael O'Keefe) and Sophie (Jennie Seagrove) on an island so they could set up housekeeping and follow in the missionary footsteps of an uncle, when the villain Ben Pease (Max Phipps) shows up, kidnaps Sophie and leaves her husband for dead. Pease runs into a German naval officer who feels it would be advantageous to join up with him -- so when Captain Hayes saves Nate and, the two go looking for Sophie, their enemies are formidable villains indeed. Laced with humor and acting in the grand pirate-movie tradition, Nate and Hayes has enough adventure and style to stay entertaining for its 100-minute running time. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1935\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 106 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Musical\n\nPK's Rating: s\n\nSynopsis: The first of MGM's phenomenally profitable Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy musicals, Naughty Marietta takes several beneficial liberties with the libretto of the original Victor Herbert operetta. MacDonald plays an 18th-century French princess who escapes an arranged marriage by posing as a \"cake girl,\" a mail-order bride sent to the New World to marry a colonist. En route, MacDonald and the other brides are captured by pirates, but are rescued by mercenary Eddy and his roistering companions. To avoid marrying some lowly farmer or frontiersman, simon-pure MacDonald intimates that she is a woman with a \"history,\" which makes her attractive to the glitterati of old New Orleans. Only Eddy sees through MacDonald's feigned \"naughtiness,\" and in the end claims her for his own. The most memorable of the Herbert songs retained for the film version of Naughty Marietta was \"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life\", which remained one of Jeanette MacDonald's signature tunes ever afterward. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1926\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 111 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Drama\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Long derided by film historians as a talented but visually unimaginative director, James Cruze made up for any and all past artistic sins with his rousing Old Ironsides.\n\nPer its title, this 11-reel silent film is set at the time of Stephen Decatur's defeat of the Barbary pirates in Tripoli. Decatur himself (played by comic actor Johnny Walker) is a secondary character herein: most of the screen time goes to the romantic leads, able- bodied seaman Charles Farrell and damsel-in-permanent-distress Esther Ralston. The acting honors go to those inveterate scene-stealers Wallace Beery and George Bancroft, cast respectively as Bos'n and Gunner.\n\nThe film accommodates everything from outsized sea battles to a daring rescue from the clutches of the lustful pirates. A life-sized replica of \"Old Ironsides\" (aka the \"Constitution\") was built for the film; it remained a useful piece of bric-a-brac for many a subsequent Paramount seafaring epic. When originally released, the film utilized a wide-screen technique during many of the battle sequences. The videocassette version of Old Ironsides is of course unable to convey this, but it does have the bonus of a rousing musical score by Gaylord Carter. This print, incidentally, is crystal clear, enabling sharp-eyed viewers to spot Boris Karloff in a bit as a menacing Saracen. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1918\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: Unknown\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Perhaps to avoid on-set confusion, pretty Peggy Hyland was cast as the \"Peg\" in Peg of the Pirates.

Barrie story, every actress in Hollywood wanted the role of Peter Pan, made famous on the stage by Maude Adams. Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, and even Gloria Swanson thought they were perfect for the role, but Barrie's own choice was Betty Bronson, a virtual unknown. The story is familiar to nearly everyone. When Mr. and Mrs. Darling (Cyril Chadwick and Esther Ralston) go to a party, they leave their children -- Wendy (Mary Brian), Michael (Philippe de Lacey), and John (Jack Murphy) -- in the care of their dog, Nana. But Peter (Bronson) shows up with the fairy, Tinker Bell (Virginia Brown Faire), and they take the children to Never Never Land. They have a series of adventures with the Lost Boys and defeat Captain Hook (Ernest Torrence) and his band of pirates. Finally, the children return home to Mrs. Darling, who is overjoyed to have them back. She adopts the Lost Boys and offers to take Peter in too, but he refuses to grow up and flies away after promising to visit Wendy every year. An interesting side note -- although she had no involvement in casting Brian as Wendy, Ralston had discovered her a couple of years earlier while judging a beauty contest. ~ Janiss Garza, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1953\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 76 minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Animated, Disney\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: A pet project of Walt Disney's since 1939, this animated version of James M. Barrie's Peter Pan reached full fruition in 1953. Eschewing much of Barrie's gentle whimsy (not to mention the more sinister aspects of the leading character), Disney and his staff fashioned a cheery, tuneful cartoon extravaganza, which cost $4 million and reaped several times that amount. The straightforward story concerns the Darling family, specifically the children: Wendy, Michael and John. Wendy enjoys telling her younger siblings stories about the mythical Peter Pan, the little boy who never grew up. One night, much to everyone's surprise, Peter flies into the Darling nursery, in search of his shadow, which Wendy had previously captured. Sprinkling the kids with magic pixie dust, Peter flies off to Never-Never Land (\"First star to the left and straight on till morning\"), with Wendy, Michael and John following behind. Once in Peter's domain, the children are terrorized by Captain Hook, who intends to capture Peter and do away with him.\n\nAfter rescuing Indian princess Tiger Lily from Captain Hook, Peter must save the children, not to mention his own \"Lost Boys,\" from the diabolical pirate captain. In addition, he must contend with the jealousy of tiny sprite Tinker Bell, who doesn't like Wendy one little bit. Breaking with several traditions, Peter had been played by a girl in all previous incarnations, Tinker Bell had always been depicted by a shaft of light, etc ... this \"Disneyized\" version of Peter Pan may not be authentic James Barrie, but it has never failed to enthrall audiences of all ages. Adding to the fun are the spirited voiceover performances by Bobby Driscoll (Peter), Hans Conried (Captain Hook and Mr. Darling), Kathryn Beaumont (Wendy) and Bill Thompson (Smee), and the sprightly songs by Sammy Cahn, Sammy Fain, Ollie Wallace, Erdman Penner, Ted Sears, Winston Hibler, Frank Churchill and Jack Lawrence. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1960\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 100 min\n\nRated: TV\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Animated, Disney\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Mary Martin originally starred in the Jules Styne/Carolyn Leigh/Comden & Green musical version of James M. Barrie's Peter Pan on Broadway in 1953. On March 7, 1955, Peter Pan was restaged for television, live and in color, on NBC's Producer's Showcase. The telecast was so popular that it was repeated, again live, the following year. Blessedly, Mary Martin returned to commit Peter Pan to videotape in 1960; this version was first telecast on December 8 of that year. Forty-seven years old at the time, Martin is utterly enchanting as Peter Pan, the little boy who won't grow up and who whisks Wendy Darling (Maureen Bailey) and her brothers Michael (Kent Fletcher) and John (Joey Trent) out of their London nursery and off to Never Never Land: \"First star to the left, then straight on till morning.\" Song highlights include \"I've Gotta Crow,\" \"I'm Flying,\" \"I Won't Grow Up,\" \"Neverland,\" \"Ugg-a-Wugg\" and \"Hook's Waltz.\" As with the Broadway version, the staging and choreography was in the more than capable hands of Jerome Robbins. Cyril Ritchard shamelessly hams it up as the wicked Captain Hook, and also doubles as the more benign Mr. Darling. Both Martin and Ritchard re-created their Broadway roles, as did Sondra Lee as the incongruously blonde Indian princess Tiger Lily. Martin's daughter Heller Halliday also appears in the minor role of Liza the maid, while the whole wonderful package is narrated by Lynn Fontanne. Repeated several times into the 1970s, this full-color version of Peter Pan was put into mothballs for several years, then retelecast (complete with the old NBC Peacock logo) in 1989. For this return engagement, the play was edited to accommodate extra commercials; happily, the complete version of the 1960 Peter Pan is now available on videocassette. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 143 Minutes\n\nRated: PG-13\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure, Action\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Gore Verbinski took on Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, the second of recent films to be based upon Disney theme-park rides (the first being The Country Bears).\n\nWhen Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight.

It seems that Sparrow owes a substantial blood debt to half-octapus sea captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and that the only way for the flamboyant sea rover to elude the wrath of his otherworldy pursuer is to seek the aid of mysterious and powerful Voodoo priestess Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), whose ability to resurrect the dead and gaze into the future may provide just the advantage needed to avoid a waterlogged fate in the locker of his legendary nemesis. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1961\n\nMade in: Italy\n\nLength: 87 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: A Spanish nobleman (Serato) runs afoul of the cruel and bloodthirsty Saracen pirate Drakut (Barker)after being provoked into swordplay. The Spaniard is allowed to become a prisoner rather then being put to death, because he is an artist. As a captive he is one among many, the others being a bevy of beautiful young women who are to be sold as slaves at the pirate's stronghold. How the longsuffering captive frees the girls, wins the love of the pirate's dangerous mistress, and faces him in a final duel to the death makes an exciting adventure film. The unusual casting of Barker as the vicious, brutal pirate along with Serato as the valiant, noble hero is a switch in roles that adds a filip to what otherwise would have been a standard entry in the pirate genre.\n\nReleased: 1948\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 102 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Colorized\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Musical, Dance\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: When Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne appeared in S. N. Behrmann's The Pirate on Broadway, there were no musical numbers whatsoever. But with Gene Kelly and Judy Garland in the leading roles of the 1948 filmization of The Pirate, the MGM production staff would have been drawn and quartered had they not managed to pump it full of song after song.\n\nThe story is merely serviceable: on a Caribbean isle in the early 19th century, sheltered young Garland comes to believe that travelling troubadour Kelly is in reality \"Mack the Black,\" a notorious pirate. Kelly realizes that the surest way to win Garland's heart is to impersonate the romantic buccaneer, and this is what he does--nearly getting himself hanged in the process.\n\nCole Porter's marvelous score yielded only one bona-fide hit: \"Be a Clown\", which has practically nothing to do with the storyline, but do you care? Highlights include the magnificently staged \"Mack the Black,\" a heady combination of Broadway glitz and Caligariesque nightmare. Seven MGM screenwriters toiled away on The Pirate, though only the team of Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich were credited.\n\nWhile The Pirate was not a huge moneymaker on its first release, it has since been embraced by the cultists, who apparently can never get enough of Judy Garland. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1982\n\nMade in: Australia\n\nLength: 99 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Musical, Comedy\n\nPK's Rating: Half a star\n\nSynopsis: I realize that I am going out on a limb with this statement, but in my humble opinion, this may actually be the worst Pirate film ever created...EVER.\n\nAn introverted girl who yearns for popularity (Kristy McNichol) attends a pirate festival in her seaside community, featuring a swordplay demo led by a curly haired hunk (Christopher Atkins). After selecting Mabel (McNichol) to participate in the act, the instructor invites her aboard his boat for a real ride on the high seas -- at which point a gaggle of her catty acquaintances latches on for the trip.\n\nSent to get hamburgers for the outing, Mabel is \"accidentally\" left behind when one of her \"friends\" pulls the anchor prematurely. Determined not only to fit in, but to track down her dream guy, Mabel steers a tiny sailboat into stormy waters in pursuit, and gets shipwrecked.\n\nThus begins a fantasy in which the unconscious Mabel imagines herself in a real pirate adventure, complete with her dashing pirate hero, a legion of his crusty shipmates, and dozens of unwed sisters who must rise to the altar before she can. The fantasy mixes film parodies, love songs, animation, and the score of Gilbert & Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance. The story also loosely follows the structure of said operetta. ~ Derek Armstrong, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1961\n\nMade in: France\n\nLength: 75 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: In the middle of the 15th century, Duke Manfred, the evil ruler of the Duchy of Monteforte in France, maintains his hold on the populace of Italy. He spreads fear through domination and terrorism at the hands of a band of Saracen pirates who rape, murder, and pillage coastal villages. When these same pirates (in the employ of Duke Manfred) murder the kindly former Duke of Monteforte whos in hiding, his daughter, Eleanor (ANDREA AURELI), escapes and rushes into the arms of the heroic Captain Richard (GERARD LANDRY) of the Black Hawk, a seaman whos been away defending his country. Richard, with the aid of his countrymen, attacks the pirates responsible for the wave of recent terrors, and sends word to the Duke that they will take their revenge on him... next. The Duke and his pouty mistress Eva, (MIJANOU BARDOT, sister of French sex Kitten Brigitte Bardot), plan to kidnap all of the surviving women of the pirate raids and bring them to the castle. There, they will be used as slaves unless Richard and his men surrender. The sinister Duke also kidnaps Eleanor and forces her to become his wife, a union that will stave off the hordes of rebelling citizens that oppose the Duke. And of course, in true time-honored fashion, Richard and his men will attempt to save the day.\n\nReleased: 1998\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 50 Minutes\n\nRated: TV\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: In the golden age of exploration, when Spanish ships loaded with New World gold struggled across the seas to their homeland, one sight was feared by all sailors the Jolly Roger.

I give it three stars, but that's really a gift in a lot of ways.\n\nCaptain Red runs a hardy pirate ship with the able assistance of Frog, a dashing young French sailor. One day Capt. Red is captured and taken aboard a Spanish galleon, but thanks to his inventiveness, he raises the crew to mutiny, takes over the ship, and kidnaps the niece of the governor of Maracaibo.

While the possibility of wealth and fame was real, so was the chance that they would be struck down by the guns and sabers of those they attacked, or done in by disease, malnutrition and the capricious seas.

It relies almost entirely on old movie clips & period illustrations to tell the violent history of pirates and buccaneers. The narration isn't bad but the music is TERRIBLE.\n\nPart 1 (Tape 1) focuses on the most famous early pirates such as Sir Francis Drake, Captain Henry Morgan, and \"Blackbeard\".\n\nPart 2 (Tape 2) focuses on the pirates and buccaneers of the 18th & 19th centuries such as Jean LaFitte, John Paul Jones (the \"father of the U.S. Navy\"), Mary Read, and Anne Bonny.

Utilizing plenty of stock footage from Joan of Arc (as he'd previously done in Thief of Damascus), producer Katzman offers the viewer a 16th-century swashbuckler, with John Derek as Robin Hood-like buccaneer Prince Roland. Having lost his throne to his evil older brother Stephan (Whitfield Connor), Roland forms a band of volunteers to oust Stephan and bring peace and harmony to his land (by busting several heads along the way). Barbara Rush co-stars as Nita, the daughter of a deposed count and a fine swordswoman in her own right. The film's best line is unintentionally funny: After being fetchingly attired in form-fitting blouse and slacks during most of the film, Nita is garbed in hoop-skirted feminine finery, whereupon Roland snickers \"At last, you look more like a woman!\" Far from a classic, Prince of Pirates is an agreeable time-passer. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1944\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 94 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure, Comedy, Musical\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: In his second film for producer Sam Goldwyn, Bob Hope is felicitously teamed with luscious Goldwyn contractee Virginia Mayo. Hope plays Sylvester the Great, a two-bit entertainer \"touring\" the West Indies in the 18th century. Mayo is Princess Margaret, who is kidnapped by a rough, tough buccaneer known only as The Hook (Victor McLaglen).\n\nThrough a series of unbelievable circumstances, Sylvester rescues Margaret, and the two of them pose as travelling troubadors in a treacherous Pirate colony, where people are stabbed and dumped in the ocean for nonpayment of rent and other such offenses. Disguising himself as The Hook, Sylvester is befriended by corrupt colonial governor La Roche (Walter Slesak), but only until the real Hook shows up.\n\nThings look bleak for Sylvester and Margaret, but salvation is on the way-as well as a surprising romantic denoument, when a \"bit player from Paramount\" (guess who?) shows up to steal the Princess away from Sylvester (\"Boy, this is the last picture I make for Goldwyn!\") No fewer than six writers teamed up for this Technicolor extravaganza, which though not as consistently hilarious as other Hope farces still holds up beautifully.

Milton Sills stars as Sir Oliver Tressilien, a wealthy English baronet who is framed for the murder of his fiancée's brother. The instigator of this outrage is Sir Tressilien's covetous half brother, who also arranges for Tressilien to be shanghaied and carried off to sea. When his ship is attacked by Spaniards, Tressilien is put to work as a galley slave. Escaping, he becomes the leader of a gang of Moorish pirates. Despite his now-fearsome reputation, Tressilien is able to win back the love of his fiancée, Lady Rosamund Godolphin (Enid Bennett), who has been compelled to marry his half brother. A thrilling climactic duel to the death brings this sure-fire audience pleaser to a rousing conclusion. The Sea Hawk may well be the best film ever made by the popular Milton Sills. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1940\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 127 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure, Romantic\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: In the 1580s, the Sea Hawks -- the name given to the bold privateers who prowl the oceans taking ships and treasure on behalf the British crown -- are the most dedicated defenders of British interests in the face of the expanding power of Philip of Spain. And Captain Geoffrey Thorpe (Errol Flynn) is the boldest of the Sea Hawks, responsible for capturing and destroying more than 50 Spanish ships and ten Spanish cities. His capture of a Spanish galleon, however, leads to more than he bargained for, in a romance with the ambassador's niece (Brenda Marshall) and the first whiff of a plan to put Spanish spies into the court of Elizabeth I (Flora Robson). Thorpe's boldness leads him to a daring raid on a treasure caravan in Panama which, thanks to treachery within Elizabeth's court, gets him captured and, with his crew, sentenced to the life of a slave aboard a Spanish ship. Meanwhile, Philip of Spain decides to wipe the threat posed by Elizabeth's independence from the sea by conquering the island nation with his armada. Thorpe, though chained to an oar, knows who the traitor at court is and plans to expose him and Philip's plans, but can he and his men break their bonds and get back to England alive in time to thwart the plans for conquest?\n\nThe Sea Hawk was the last and most mature of Flynn's swashbuckling adventure films, played with brilliant stylistic flourishes by the star at his most charismatic, and most serious and studied when working with Flora Robson, whom he apparently genuinely respected. Boasting the handsomest, most opulent production values of a Warner Bros. period film to date, The Sea Hawk was made possible in part by a huge new floodable soundstage. Another highlight was the best adventure film score ever written by Erich Wolfgang Korngold; and the script's seriousness was nailed down by various not-so-veiled references not to 16th century Spain but 20th century Nazi Germany. The movie was cut by over 20 minutes for a reissue with The Sea Wolf, and the complete version was lost until a preservation-quality source was found at the British Film Institute. Since then, that 128-minute version -- which actually contains a one-minute patriotic speech by Robson as Elizabeth that was originally left out of U.S. prints, as well as amber tinting in all of the Panamanian sequences -- has become standard. ~ Bruce Eder, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1962\n\nMade in: Italy\n\nLength: 102 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Set during the time of the brilliant Queen Elizabeth I of England, this adventure tale is loosely based on the exploits of Sir Francis Drake (Rod Taylor). He was one of the Queen's leading commanders in the battles with Spain over the gold of the New World. Drake is shown wearing several hats, so to speak. He is a pirate who has no problems about raiding Spanish gold arsenals. He is a military commander who plans and executes naval battles with the Spanish armada -- and wins. He is a diplomat who knows how to maneuver in courtly circles -- but that does not stop him from trashing a Spanish-backed plan to assassinate the Queen. Although this costume drama by Rudolph Maté is not without a few minor flaws, Drake's adventures should entertain most audiences, especially the younger set. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1947\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 116 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: In the RKO swashbuckler Sinbad the Sailor, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. nostalgically emulates his famous father. The first seven voyages of Sinbad have come and gone: now he is on an eighth mission, in search of the island where Alexander the Great allegedly hid his treasure. Participants in the proceedings are the incredibly gorgeous Maureen O'Hara as a feisty princess, Walter Slezak as a duplicitous green-skinned barber, George Tobias and Mike Mazurki as two of Sinbad's faithful seamen, and Anthony Quinn as the villain of villains, who meets a suitably fiery demise. If the plot seems well nigh impossible to follow at times, you can always wallow in the splendiferous Technicolor and the eye-popping stunt work of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (and, it must be admitted, his uncredited stunt double). Budgeted at nearly $3 million, Sinbad the Sailor was one of the few postwar RKO flicks to post a profit. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1998\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 101 Minutes\n\nRated: PG-13\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Action / Adventure / Romance\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Taking a romantic tropical island week off with her boyfriend, an ambitious, decisive New York girl agrees to help her magazine out by covering a story on a neighboring island. The only plane available is piloted by a laid-back heavy drinker (played by Harrison Ford) with whom she shares a mutual dislike. Ford is the only available pilot, so she has no choice but to hire him and he cannot refuse the money. Soon after, when the plane crash-lands in a storm on an uninhabited island with little chance of rescue, they begin an unexpected romance that is eventually interrupted by modern day pirates seeking to steal their (now repaired) airplane.\n\nSide Note: The plane that Harrison Ford flies is called a DeHavilland Beaver, and Ford actually owns one in his real-world, off-screen life.\n\nReleased: 1962\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 88 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: This sequel to the classic adventure, stars Sean Flynn, the son of the swashbuckling actor who played Captain Blood in the original. In this version, the son of the notorious pirate is raised by his mother. She wants him to be a doctor, but unfortunately, the lad has salt-water in his veins and adventure in his heart; he longs to sail the high seas of his father.\n\nEventually the mother gives in, and young Blood joins a crew.

Paul Henried is his usual stoic self as Laurent Van Horn, a Dutch sea captain shipwrecked on the coast of Cartagena, a Spanish-held island. Sentenced to be hanged, Van Horn and his crew escape from jail and take up piracy as revenge against Spain. Soon afterward, they capture a ship carrying Francisca (Maureen O'Hara), the fiance of Cartagena's corrupt governor Don Alvarado (Walter Slezak). Van Horn vengefully forces Francisca to marry him instead, which causes dissension at the Pirate colony of Tortuga. Naturally, Van Horn and Francisca eventually fall in love with each other, but the bad guys must be vanquished before a happy ending can be realized. Binnie Barnes steals the show as feisty female buccaneer Anne Bonney (who in real life looked less like Barnes and more like Walter Slezak!) The script is a cynical melange of pirate-movie cliches and the performances are generally routine, but The Spanish Main pleased the crowd in 1945, posting a profit of nearly $1.5 million and encouraging future Technicolor adventure films from RKO. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1918\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 50 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: Silent\n\nGenre: Adventure, Suspense\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Raised on the wild windjammer stories of her sea-captain grandfather Obadiah Wolf (Theodore Roberts), heroine Patricia (Lila Lee) yearns for a life on the high seas. Obadiah paints bold images of buccaneering and booty. In fact, he's got a tattoo on his breast of a map which leads to buried treasure. He plans to go get it just as soon as his makes his final payment on a ship which is being cared for by Rory O'Malley (Harrison Ford), a slightly crippled young seaman. However, the man he is paying, Ellory Glendenning (Forrest Seabury) intends to steal the ship and sell it to the government for a high price. The night Obadiah makes his final payment he celebrates a bit too heartily and in a drunken brawl rolls into a fire, scorching his map into obliteration. He also loses the receipt for the ship, so Glendenning refuses to give him the vessel. He boards the craft anyway with his draft-dodging son (J. Parks-Jones) and heads out to sea. But Patricia has snuck on board with her pet orangutan, Sinbad. The crew mutinies and Rory and Patricia take over. They get to the treasure just as Obadiah is being dragged to the same location by \"Bad Eye,\" a grimy old sea dog (Guy Oliver). Rory and Patricia save Obadiah, and Sinbad finds the receipt, so all ends well. This film was based on the novel Peggy, the Pirate, by James Oliver Curwood. ~ Janiss Garza, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1960\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 128 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure, Children\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: None of the many cinema adaptations of Johan Wyss' The Swiss Family Robinson are as relentlessly enjoyable as this 1960 Disney feature. The film wastes no time getting down to business, with the shipwreck of the Robinson family occurring as the credits flash across the screen. Fashioning a raft, the family heads to a lush tropical island. While the mother (Dorothy McGuire) isn't too happy about being a castaway, the father (John Mills) and the sons (James MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran) are thrilled at the prospect of carving out a new life for themselves.\n\nIn short order, the industrious Robinsons have constructed a treehouse with all the creature comforts and \"utilities\" of their home in Switzerland. Later on, the little party is joined by Janet Munro, the daughter of a sea captain who has been captured by pirate Sessue Hayakawa and his band. After a series of adventures calculated to arouse the envy of every man, woman and child in the audience, the film comes to a rousing conclusion as the Robinsons resourcefully fend off Hayakawa and his pirates with a variety of jerry-built booby traps. A box-office winner to the tune of $30 million, The Swiss Family Robinson proved beyond doubt that Disney's decision to emphasize the humor and adventure of the Wyss original, while downplaying the sociopolitical undertones, was a sound one. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1946\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 18 min\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Comedy, Short\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: This was Curly Howard's next to last film as a member of the Three Stooges. He would collapse from a stroke while filming Half-Wits Holiday, and his illness would end his career. Even though he wasn't well during his last few shorts, Curly's comic timing was usually flawless, and he's especially hilarious here disguised as a Rajah. The time is supposedly 1642, but when the Stooges are washed up onto Dead Man's Island from a wrecked garbage scow, they are dressed as sailors circa 1946 (when the film was made). Curly immediately displeases the governor (Vernon Dent) by flirting with his fiancée, Rita (Christine McIntyre), and he sentences all three of them to death. Rita doesn't want to marry the governor, so she gives the boys tools (including an electric drill) so they can escape from their cell. Unfortunately, they choose the wrong wall and wind up right back in their cell. So Rita disguises them as \"wayfarers from a strange land\" -- apparently somewhere around India. They talk in gibberish and offer the governor a raspberry lollipop, which he mistakes as a ruby (he's delighted because he's never been given the raspberry before). Only after they're gone does he discover that they are the sailors he wants dead. He enlists the help of Black Louie the pirate, and the boys wind up in a tense situation at a saloon. But they battle it out, and with Rita's help they emerge victorious. Moe, however, has decided he wants to stay; he proclaims himself emperor and a mallet immediately comes down and smashes him on the head. ~ Janiss Garza, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1934\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 105 Minutes\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: This fifth film version of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island boasts an all-star MGM cast, headed by Wallace Beery as Long John Silver and Jackie Cooper as Jim Hawkins. The screenplay, by John Lee Mahin, John Howard Lawson and Leonard Praskins, remains faithful to the Stevenson original...up to a point. The story begins when drunken old sea dog Billy Bones (Lionel Barrymore) drags himself into the seaside pub managed by Jim and his mother (Dorothy Peterson).\n\nAfter Billy is killed by the scurrilous Blind Pew (William V. Mong) and his henchmen, Jim discovers that the deceased ex-pirate carries a treasure map on his person. Together with Dr. Livesey (Otto Kruger) and Squire Trelawny (Nigel Bruce), Jim books passage on a ship captained by Alexander Smollett (Lewis Stone); their destination is the \"treasure island\" depicted on the map. Smollett doesn't like the voyage nor the crew, and not without reason: ship's cook Long John Silver has rounded up the crew from the dregs of the earth, fully intending to mutiny and claim the treasure for himself.\n\nA further plot complications awaits both treasure-seekers and pirates in the person of half-mad island hermit Ben Gunn (Chic Sale) who's already found the treasure and has stashed it away for himself. Towards the end, the plot strays from the Stevenson version in detailing the ultimate fate of ruthless-but-lovable Long John Silver. While consummately produced, Treasure Island suffers from overlength and a mannered performance by Jackie Cooper. Disney's 1950 remake with Robert Newton and Bobby Driscoll is far more satisfying. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1985\n\nMade in: France\n\nLength: 115 min\n\nRated: NR\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Jonathan (Melvil Poupaud) is an imaginative young man. This film unveils what goes on in his mind as he mulls over his recent reading of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic Treasure Island and the television adventure shows he is watching. This story device allows the highly regarded and very innovative Chilean-born director Raul Ruiz to transform Stevenson's classic adventure tale into a much darker and more complex depiction of treachery and hidden identities. Distributors and producers were not entranced by this transformation, and money for completing the film was withheld, so despite its completion date of 1986, this version, which evinces numerous technical and other problems, was not released until 1991. Gaps in the sometimes confusing storyline are dealt with in a voiceover narrative. Ruiz' work has usually met with a warmer reception, but in this case it received a great deal of (possibly well-deserved) ridicule. One high point of the film, however, is when Pedro Armendariz Jr., as Mendoza, recounts the story of Herman Melville's less-well-known novel Benito Cereno. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide\n\nReleased: 1990\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 131 Minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: Color\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Made for TV\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: A terrific telling of Robert Louis Stevenson's adventure, Christian Bale as the young Jim Hawkins and Charlton Heston as Long John Silver are both superb, and head a great cast: Richard Johnson, Oliver Reed, Clive Wood, and Julian Glover among the many actors that bring the story to life. Filmed in Jamaica, as well as the Hispaniola, a beauty of a ship, the scenery and cinematography by Robert Steadman are marvelous. The soundtrack is by Paddy Moloney and performed by The Chieftains, and is also very effective.\n\nChristian Bale, so moving two years earlier in \"Empire of the Sun\", is here courageous and strong; only fourteen at the time this was made, he is quite remarkable, and Heston does a turn as the bad guy, and is sensational as old wily Silver, saying things like \"I'll have yer liver for breakfast !\". Director Fraser Heston, who made his cinematic debut as the infant Moses in the 1956 \"The Ten Commandments\" his father starred in, keeps the pacing fast and though there are a lot of sword fights and shooting, it is mostly sound effects and there is very little in the way of gore, making the film suitable for children. The dialect of the sailors sounds foreign at first, but one soon gets used to it.\n\nOriginally made for television, this is rousing, exceptional story-telling\n\nReleased: 1916\n\nMade in: USA\n\nLength: 105 minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nFormat: B&W\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Adventure, Silent\n\nPK's Rating:\n\nSynopsis: Captain Nemo has built a fantastic submarine for his mission of revenge.
