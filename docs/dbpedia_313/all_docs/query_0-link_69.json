        "text": "Episode Notes\n\n#Pratchat79 Notes and Errata\n\nThese are the episode notes and errata for Pratchat episode 79, “Unalive from Überwald”, discussing Terry Pratchett’s 2002 short story “Death and What Comes Next”, with returning guest Tansy Rayner Roberts and new guest Karen J Carlisle.\n\nIconographic Evidence\n\nIf you also took photos of us at the convention, please get in touch – we’d love to see them and add a few here!\n\nYou can also find photos of the convention at the official website.\n\nNotes and Errata\n\nThe episode title refers to the theme for Nullus Anxietas IX, “Come Alive in Überwald”, but since we were talking mostly about Death, “Live from Überwald” didn’t seem quite right.\n\nNullus Anxietas IX is, as you probably know, the ninth bi-annual Australian Discworld convention. As mentioned at the end of the episode, the next convention will be in Sydney in 2026, and you can already get a supporting membership for the next convention. For details, plus information on past conventions and Discworld fan clubs across Australia, head to ausdwcon.org.\n\nOur previous live shows are:\n\n#PratchatNA7, “A Troll New World” from Nullus Anxietas 7\n\n“Book Discussion: The Carpet People” from the Virtual Discworld Fun Day (on YouTube)\n\n#PratchatNALC, “Twice as Alive” from Nullus Anxietas: The Lost Con\n\nLiz mentions two of her short stories:\n\nThe story about women turning into cleaning equipment is “Call Him Al”. You can read it in Meanjin, where it was published in 2020.\n\nThe story about an immigrant splitting into two people is “One’s Company”, originally published in the anthology Best Australian Stories 2017. It was published online at InterSastra in an Indonesian translation (“Cukup Sendiri”) by Nicolaus Gogor Seta Dewa; the original English version is also available there.\n\n“Pantsers and Plotters” are widespread terms for “the two types” of writers, embraced to varying degrees by writing communities and individuals. The classification is based on whether a writer works out a plot in advance (a plotter), or writes by the seat of their pants (a pantser), making it up as they go along. It’s not entirely clear where these terms originated, but these days some writers refer to themselves as “plantsers” (a combination of the two), and other terms exist for roughly the same ideas. For example, in 2011 George R. R. Martin used the terms architect (similar to a plotter) and gardener (a variation on pantser in which the emphasis is on the weeding, i.e. editing).\n\nTansy’s stories that get mentioned include:\n\nMusketeer Space, the gender-swapped Three Musketeers in space;\n\nTeacup Magic, the Regency-inspired fantasy mystery series (we’ve linked to the collection);\n\nWe don’t think Tansy has written “Beauty and the Beast with cyborgs”, but she has written Curse of Bronze, a novella which riffs on Beauty and the Beast. It’s available for free as an ebook via BookFunnel (you’ll need to sign up to Tansy’s mailing list), or in audio form on her podcast Sheep Might Fly.\n\nMore notes coming soon.\n\nThanks for reading our notes! If we missed anything, or you have questions, please let us know.\n\n#Pratchat44 Notes and Errata\n\nThese are the episode notes and errata for episode 44, “Cosmic Turtle Soup“, featuring guest Joel Martin, discussing the 2nd Discworld novel, 1986’s The Light Fantastic.\n\nIconographic Evidence\n\nYou can listen to the State Swim jingle right here:\n\nThe ridiculous fight between Xander and cheerleader-turned-vampire Harmony, occurs in Buffy: the Vampire Slayer‘s fourth season, in the seventh episode “The Initiative”. But you can see it on YouTube:\n\nNotes and Errata\n\nThe episode title is references Joel’s comments that this book is the “primordial soup” of the Discworld books yet to come, the analogy of the “cosmic ocean” put forward by Carl Sagan in his book and television series Cosmos, and of course Great A’Tuin the World Turtle himself.\n\nThe term “hat-trick” does indeed originate with cricket, where it means taking three wickets (i.e. getting the batter out) on three consecutive deliveries (i.e. a single bowl of the ball). It has since spread to other sports and to mean more generally three successful attempts in a row. (In football, it specifically refers to a player scoring three goals in one game.) The term dates back to 1858, when English cricketer Heathfield Harman Stephenson performed the first recorded hat-trick; fans collected up money for him and used it to buy a hat, which they presented to him to commemorate the achievement. While this story seems well-documented, if Helen Zaltzman (see below) has taught Ben anything, it’s to be suspicious of neat etymological explanations…\n\nThe custom of throwing hats in the air to celebrate a victory or achievement is said by multiple sources to be a military tradition: cadets graduating to officer status would be given new hats, or at least no longer need to wear their old cadet ones, and they would symbolically throw them away. At least one story says this started specifically at the US Naval Academy with the class of 1912.\n\nHelen Zaltzman is a comedian, writer and podcaster best known for the long-running comedy podcast Answer Me This? with fellow comedian Olly Mann, and her more recent show, The Allusionist, which explores language in as many different ways as possible. The Allusionist started out as part of the Radiotopia Network, but went fully independent in 2020 as part of Helen putting her money where her mouth was in backing diversity and inclusion in podcasting. If you enjoy the show, please consider supporting The Allusionist via Patreon. Oh, and we nearly forgot: Helen also makes a Veronica Mars recap podcast called Veronica Mars Investigations! Helen is the best.\n\n“Commitment to the bit“, or “commit to the bit“, is a common phrase in comedy circles. It means to stick with a joke or comic premise all the way to the end, rather than shy away from it because it it doesn’t immediately work, or is impractical or uncomfortable. It’s obviously not always a good tactic, as seen recently during Eurovision 2021. Iceland employed actor Hannes Óli Ágústsson to relay their jury’s points in character as Olaf Yohansson from the comedy film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. Olaf’s whole shtick is that he only likes one song, “Ja Ja Ding Dong”, which he awkwardly and angrily demands at every opportunity. At the contest, he tried to give Iceland’s 12 points to the song – twice. Few things are as hated at Eurovision as a country’s jury announcer talking too long before delivering the points, so this over-commitment to the bit did not go down well.\n\nThe Colour of Magic was first published on the 24th of November, 1983 (one day after the 20th anniversary of Doctor Who!), and so its 35th anniversary was two weeks before #Pratchat14, published on December 8, 2018. It originally had cover art of Great A’Tuin swimming through space painted by Alan Smith; the Josh Kirby art first appeared on the first UK paperback edition, published in March 1985. The Light Fantastic was first published on the 2nd of June, 1986, so we’re a bit closer to the anniversary this time around!\n\nLiz’s “double book” is the combined edition of The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic published in 2008, to tie in with The Mob’s two-part television adaptation The Colour of Magic, which also combined both books. They had previously been collected as a single volume in 1999 as The First Discworld Novels.\n\nLiz’s annoyance with the “cosmic turtle business” at the start of many of the earlier Discworld books is well documented in many previous episodes.\n\nIn The Colour of Magic, Krull’s spaceship the Potent Voyager is only vaguely described as being made of bronze and looking “like a great flying fish”. The graphic novel depicts it as fish shaped, but without the wing-fins of a flying fish.\n\nThe Rocket Clock is one of the clocks used by the Australian version of Playschool to help tell the time in the 1980s. (The other famous one is the Flower Clock.) As you might expect, it resembles a space rocket, with a clock on the top section, and a bottom section which rotates to reveal a small diorama connected to a theme explored in that episode. The original version of the clock, used from 1966 to at least the 1980s, is now in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.\n\nMr Squiggle was a long-running Australian children’s program starring puppet character Mr Squiggle, “the Man in the Moon”. It ran for forty years between 1959 and 1999. Mr Squiggle, who would arrive in “Rocket“, his smoke-belching impatient rocket ship, had a pencil for a nose. He would use it to turn “squiggles” – scribbles sent in by children – into pictures. Because he was a marionette, puppeteer Norman Heatherington was watching upside down from above, so a lot of his drawings were upside down. This led to him having to tell his assistant, who was holding the puppet’s hand to keep him still, that “Everything’s upside down, Miss Jane”. He would later inspire the title of #Pratchat55: “Mr Doodle, the Man on the Moon“.\n\nIn the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons, players create characters whose power is measured in “levels”. As they accumulate experience, they gain levels of power and new abilities. In the current edition all characters can reach up to level 20, with wizards learning more and more powerful spells as they level up. Ben has mentioned Dungeons & Dragons many times, as far back as #Pratchat4; his article “What Even Is Dungeons & Dragons?” is a good primer for the novice, though note it’s a little sweary.\n\nThe Necrotelicomnicon is mentioned in several books, including The Colour of Magic, Sourcery and Moving Pictures. It’s a pun on the Necronomicon, a fictional book of evil magic written by the “Mad Arab Abdul Alhazred” that appears in the stories of H. P. Lovecraft.\n\n“Vancian magic” is the sort used in older editions of Dungeons & Dragons, in which a wizard must study their spell book and memorise a spell, fixing it in their mind, before they can cast it. Once cast, the spell leaves their mind entirely, and they must memorise it anew to cast it again. The name comes from the source that inspired this form of spellcasting, the “Dying Earth” books by American writer Jack Vance.\n\nThe comic with several different Joker origin stories is probably 2020’s Three Jokers, by Geoff Johns and Jason Fabok, which reveals that three of the stories are correct – there have been more than one Joker all along. But he’s had many other origin stories; this article from Screen Rant runs through many of them.\n\nIn case the pun is lost on you, timber is wood that’s been prepared for building, usually by being sawn into planks. Timbre is the quality of tone of a sound, especially a voice or musical instrument. You can think of it as all the things that distinguish two sounds of the same frequency from each other.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy – well, one of them at least – plays a major part in Hogfather (#Pratchat24). Buggy Swires is a gnome exterminator living in Ankh-Morpork; he returns in several books, starting with Feet of Clay (#Pratchat24). The pictsies known as the Nac Mac Feegle first appear in Carpe Jugulum (#Pratchat36).\n\nToadstool houses are the traditional homes of Smurfs, small blue creatures invented in 1959 by Belgian cartoonist Peyo. We previously talked about them in #Pratchat9, “Upscalator to Heaven”, about Pratchett’s second tiny people book, Truckers; and in #Pratchat36, “Home Alone, But Vampires”, about the book that introduced the Nac Mac Feegle, Carpe Jugulum. (There’s more detail about the Smurfs in the show notes for #Pratchat36.)\n\nLonely Planet is a prominent publisher of travel guides for tourists on a budget. In the pre-smartphone days every backpacker bought a Lonely Planet guide to the country where they were headed, but in recent years – especially since the global pandemic – their business has waned. The company was started in Australia by Maureen and Tony Wheeler in 1972, but was later sold to the BBC and is now owned by Red Media, the company behind CNET, Metacritic and GameSpot, among other prominent online media outlets.\n\nPratchett writes about tiny people many times, including in his first novel The Carpet People, the Bromeliad trilogy (Truckers, Diggers and Wings), and the various tiny denizens of the Discworld, most prominently gnomes and pictsies.\n\nWhile houses made of food or confectionary date back further, the gingerbread cottage appears in the fairytale of “Hansel and Gretel”, collected and published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812. “Hansel and Gretel” is the archetypal story of Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 327A. Pratchett returns to the idea in the witches books, especially Wyrd Sisters (#Pratchat4). The witches refer to Aliss Demurrage, aka “Black Aliss”, as a witch who worked some of the greatest magic, but also as a cautionary tale: she built a gingerbread cottage, a sure sign she’d gone to the bad, and by the end was making poisoned apples before she was pushed into her own oven by children she was trying to eat. (Her cottage is also said to be in Skund, leading some Pratchett fans to suggest that Granny Whitlow was an alias she used to lure children.)\n\nThe Rite of AshkEnte is performed here, and also in Mort (when it summons Mort as well as Death), Reaper Man, and Soul Music (where it summons Susan). Death tends to show up without needing to be asked in later books.\n\nWe have a play with the famous “you have my sword” sequence from the film Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, which doesn’t appear in the book. (Frodo does say “I will take the Ring to Mordor!” and then “Though I do not know the way” in the book, but Elrond decides who will accompany him after the council is over.) Here’s the dialogue from the movie:\n\nFrodo: I will take it. I will take it. I will take the Ring to Mordor. Though… I do not know the way.\n\nGandalf: I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.\n\nAragorn: If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword.\n\nLegolas: And you have my bow.\n\nGimli: And my axe!\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring (2001, dir. Peter Jackson)\n\nYou can find Fury’s drawing of the Luggage as Trunkie from The Last Continent in the notes for #Pratchat29, “Great Rimward Land”.\n\nThe Last Continent was published twelve years after The Light Fantastic, in 1998, so Liz was pretty close with her guess of ten years.\n\nLiz suggests the Luggage might have “a chamber full of pigs?” in reference to the “having your enemies’ corpses eaten by pigs” method of getting away with murder. This features prominently in the television series Deadwood, and also Guy Richie’s film Snatch. You can find a list of uses as the “Fed to Pigs” trope on TV Tropes. Ben also mentions a bath full of (Hollywood style) acid, most famously used by Walter White in Breaking Bad.\n\nPratchett uses the Megalith pun in Lords and Ladies: “It was always cheaper to build a new 33-MegaLith circle than upgrade an old slow one.” This is a pun on MegaHertz (MHz), the unit used to measure the clock speed or clock rate of computer processors – in simple terms, how many instructions they execute per second. In the 1980s, home computers used chips like Intel’s 386, which had speeds of between 16 and 40 MHz. While it was used heavily in marketing, clock speed was not a sure measure of computer performance.\n\nPratchett moved to Broad Chalke in Wiltshire in 1993, seven years after The Light Fantastic was published. Before that he lived in the village of Rowberrow, Somerset, about 67 kilometres (or about 42 miles) to the northwest. He was never very far from many sites of ancient interest, but Broad Chalke was only a stone’s throw (sorry) from Stonehenge.\n\nThere are several stone circles better than Stonehenge, depending on who you ask and how you define “better”, but the one at Avebury is about 30km to the north and much, much bigger. Longtime British YouTuber Tom Scott made this video about it.\n\nThe Small Faint Group of Boring Stars is mentioned again in The Last Continent; the wizards travel quite far back in time, to an age when the stars were much closer and less faint (though possibly just as boring).\n\nThe Free and Sovereign State of Yucatán is one of the 52 states of Mexico. There are several theories behind its name, and there are two versions of the “Your Finger You Fool” type: one involves the Mayan phrase Ma’anaatik ka t’ann, or “I do not understand you”, and the other uh yu ka t’ann, or “hear how they talk”. Another involves the casava plant, known locally as yuca (see #Pratchat41, “The Adventures of Crab Boy and Trouser Girl” for more on this plant) which was cultivated in the area, the name Yucatá meaning “land of yucas”. A third one suggests the name comes from the local Chontal Maya people, who call themselves the Yokot’anob or Yokot’an, meaning “the speakers of Yoko ochoco”.\n\nCohen is not in fact mentioned in The Colour of Magic; this is the first time we meet him.\n\nThe famous “What is best in life?” dialogue was made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian, based on the Conan stories of Robert E Howard. The lines in full are below; they don’t appear in Robert E Howard’s stories, but are instead inspired by words attributed to Genghis Khan himself…\n\nMongol General: Hao! Dai ye! We won again! This is good but what is best in life?\n\nMongol Soldier: The open steppe, fleet horse, falcons at your wrist and the wind in your hair.\n\nMongol General: Wrong! Conan, what is best in life?\n\nConan: To crush your enemies, see them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of their women.\n\nConan the Barbarian (1982, dir. John Milius)\n\nThe people around the breakfast table in The Truth are Mr Windling and the other lodgers at Mars Arcanum’s guest house, where William de Worde lives. He doesn’t tell them he’s the editor of The Ankh-Morpork Times. (We covered The Truth in #Pratchat42, “Truth, the Printing Press and Every -ing”.\n\nThe cover art we’re talking about is the Josh Kirby art for the Corgi edition, still used for the Corgi edition (though the one currently in print uses a zoomed in subset of the image). You can find it on the official Josh Kirby website.\n\nThe “uncanny valley” describes the discomfort felt at seeing an artificial creature that is very like, but not mistakable for, the real thing. It can apply to anything living but is strongest – and most often used – to refer to the effect produced by androids and computer-generated representations of faces. There are many theories that try and account for why these things creep it out.\n\nIn Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film version of The Shining, based on Stephen King’s 1977 novel, a pair of creepy twins appear as ghosts. The “Grady twins” are not twins in the book, but sisters aged 8 and 10, and are only mentioned, rather than appearing as ghosts. In the film, they appear to the young psychic Danny Torrance, dressed identically and speaking to him in unison saying “Come and play with us” – now a famous classic line of horror cinema. Though Kubrick denied it was intentional, many have pointed out that the look of the twins in the film resembles the photograph Identical Twins, Roselle, New Jersey, 1967 by American photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nMort was published in November 1987, so about seventeen months after The Light Fantastic. Liz’s guess of seven months is spot on for the third Discworld book, though – Equal Rites was published in January 1987!\n\nIt was announced on the 28th of April, 2020 that Narrativia had made an exclusive new deal with Motive Pictures and Endeavour Content to produce “definitive” and “absolutely faithful” Discworld adaptations for the screen. So far no actual productions have been announced, but the Narrativia website now has sections for all of the major Discworld screen projects of the last decade or so. The page about the new Discworld deal still lists only the initial agreement.\n\nThe extra space in Death’s House is described near the start of Soul Music, when Death watches Albert flit from the edge of his impossibly large office to the edge of the carpet around his desk:\n\nDeath gave up wondering how Albert covered the intervening space when it dawned on him that, to his servant, there was no intervening space…\n\nPratchett, Soul Music (1994)\n\nBy season three of The Good Place, the humans who are at the centre of the show have been exposed to a lot of the weirdness that exists beyond the mortal, material world. Near the end of the season, an accident in the “Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes” sends Chidi briefly to another realm, and when he returns he describes it like this:\n\nChidi Anagonye: I… I just saw a trillion different realities folding onto each other like thin sheets of metal forming… a single blade.\n\nMichael: Yeah yeah, the Time-Knife. We’ve all seen it.\n\nThe Good Place, season 3 episode 12, “Chidi Sees the Time-Knife” (2019)\n\nThe Untempered Schism is “a gap in the fabric of reality from which can be seen the whole of the Vortex” of space and time. It’s introduced at the end of the third season of the revived Doctor Who in the penultimate episode, “The Sound of Drums”. The Doctor explains that it’s an initiation rite for young Gallifreyans, who at the age of eight must stare into it; according to him, “some would be inspired, some would run away, and some would go mad.” He says he ran away; the Master instead went mad, constantly hearing “the drumming”, though this is later revealed to be more than it seems.\n\nThe Doctor Who universe influencer jokes refer to the city of New New York, as introduced in the episode “New Earth”; the “EarPods” used by alternate universe Cybermen to control and convert humans, as seen in the two-part season two story “Rise of the Cyberman”/”The Age of Steel”; and the Adipose, a species of creatures whose cute babies could be incubated in a human body by accumulating fat tissue, under the guise of a diet pill, as seen in the season four opening episode “Partners in Crime”. The idea of influencers in the Whoniverse isn’t a million miles away from the later BBC fiction podcast Doctor Who: Redacted, published in April 2022, which features a gang of podcasters who follow a conspiracy theory about a blue box associated with mysteries throughout human history.\n\nIcelandic names are subject to some fairly strict conventions, overseen by the Icelandic Naming Committee. There’s a list of around 4,000 traditional Icelandic names which can be used freely, but new names must be approved by the committee. In addition, by convention Icelandic people take either their father’s or mother’s name as a surname, appended with -son, –dottir or (since 2019) –bur for son, daughter or child, respectively. Episode 87 of The Allusionist podcast, “Name v. Law”, covers some of this in detail, though note it was released in 2018, before the change allowing non-gendered suffixes. The Allusionist returned to Icelandic names in December 2021 for episode 147, the second of the two-part story, “Survival: Today, Tomorrow” about trying to change the Icelandic language.\n\n“That bit in The Hobbit” is Chapter II, “Roast Mutton”, when Bilbo is scouting ahead of the company of dwarves and comes upon three trolls named William, Bert and Tom. Bilbo is caught picking a troll’s pocket (Tolkien trolls wear trousers!), and he and the dwarves are caught. Gandalf manages to keep all three trolls arguing with each other, distracting them until the sun comes up and turns them to stone.\n\n5G, short for fifth-generation, is the name given to the newest mobile communications network technology being rolled out around the world. 5G is capable of far greater data transfer speeds than its predecessor 4G, at least at short range. It has been the subject of many conspiracy theories that claim it causes health problems in humans, despite a lack of any evidence that this is true. These theories mutated during 2020 to suggest that 5G caused or spread COVID-19, and they were believed enough that 5G towers in several countries were vandalised.\n\nLackjaw does indeed describe himself as “of the dwarfish persuasion“.\n\nThe magic shop trope can be traced back as far as H. G. Wells’ stories The Crystal Egg (1897) and The Magic Shop (1903). TV Tropes lists it as “The Little Shop That Wasn’t There Yesterday” and has many other examples. Pratchett revisits it in a more traditional way in Soul Music (discussed by us in #Pratchat19, “It Don’t Mean a Thing if It Ain’t Got Rocks In”), where Buddy buys his guitar. It’s not the same shop, though – the proprietor is an old woman who seems quite happy with her lot, and she seems to sell only musical instruments.\n\nWe keep mentioning Howl’s Moving Castle, so it’s probably a good idea for us to do that Diana Wynne Jones episode we keep talking about. Previous episodes where this book have been mentioned include #Pratchat17, #Pratchat26, #Pratchat30 and #Pratchat43. In a nutshell: Howl is a wizard who lives as a recluse in a castle that not only can move from place to place, but has a magical front door that can open in one of several fixed locations.\n\nCane toads, Rhinella marina, are native to the Americas and were introduced to Australia from Hawaii in 1935 for purposes of pest control on sugar cane farms. We previously talked about them in #Pratchat22, “The Cat in the Prat“, where we recommended in the episode notes the documentaries Cane Toads: An Unnatural History (1988) and its sequel, Cane Toads: The Conquest (2010). You can indeed still get various souvenirs made from dead toads; you can see examples at the website Souvenirs Australia (though it’s not a pretty sight).\n\nThe “critical Black Mass” pun is not about wizards or gods, but rather books of magic. It comes up in a description of the library as Trymon heads there to bribe the Librarian while the wizards are still speaking to Death.\n\nBethan is not mentioned in Interesting Times. Rincewind does mention in Sourcery that he was a guest at Cohen’s wedding to “a girl of about Conina’s age”, but Bethan isn’t mentioned by name and Rincewind gives no indication that he knows how the marriage went.\n\nWe looked up Echidna penises for #Pratchat12, “Brooms, Boats and Pumpkinmobiles“.\n\nRincewind will return in The Last Hero, The Science of Discworld II: The Globe, The Science of Discworld III: Darwin’s Watch and The Science of Discworld IV: Judgment Day. He’s also a minor character in Unseen Academicals, and mentioned briefly in Raising Steam.\n\nMichael Moorcock’s “Wizardry and Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy” is less an essay, and more of a book, first published in 1987. An expanded edition, now 206 pages long, was released in 2004.\n\nBlades in the Dark is a tabletop roleplaying game written and designed by John Harper and published in 2015. It’s set in an “industrial-fantasy” world, and players form a company of criminals who try to stake a claim for themselves in the inescapable city of Duskvol, surrounded by horror and haunted by deadly ghosts. Among its distinctive features are a system of retroactively planning heists and packing gear, which gets you into the action quicker. If industrial-fantasy isn’t your thing the system has also been used to make several other games in other genres.\n\nCampaign settings are the various fantasy worlds used for Dungeons & Dragons and other games which aren’t tied too much to a specific universe. D&D has a large number of these covering various sub-genres of fantasy, from the post-apocalyptic sword and sorcery of Dark Sun to the gothic horror of Ravenloft. There are too many to list them all, since aside from the dozens of official ones there are many more published independently. (Ben’s favourite is probably Planescape, which both ties together all the others in a weird multiverse, and introduces an interdimensional hub city on the inside of a ring in the theoretical centre of everything.)\n\nMage: The Ascension, first published in 1993, was the third game in the World of Darkness series of modern horror roleplaying games, following Vampire: the Masquerade and Werewolf: the Apocalypse. Mage is also effectively a sequel to the earlier game about medieval wizards, Ars Magicka, but in the modern world the rise of science and rational thought means magic doesn’t work like it used to.\n\nCavaliers of Mars by Rose Bailey is the latest in a fine tradition of games that seek to emulate the “planetary romance” genre of fiction. These were science fiction or fantasy stories from around the turn of the twentieth century in which the fantastic adventures take place on other worlds – either in our own solar system as in A Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs (adapted as the hugely underrated film John Carter), or in other galaxies entirely – for example, James Herbert’s Dune is sometimes classified as a planetary romance.\n\nThe Old-School Renaissance or Revival – usually abbreviated to OSR – is a movement in roleplaying game communities which prefers the early versions of Dungeons & Dragons and similar games from the 1970s and 1980s. There are now many games that seek to recapture the feel of those games, either by re-implementing the original rules (a genre known as “retro-clones”) or writing games with more modern rules but the old-school philosophy in mind. Exactly what that philosophy is varies according to who you ask, but it usually means a smaller set of rules, and more reliance on both player skill (as opposed to rules which emulate the skill of the characters being played) and rulings by the Game Master (who OSR games often call the referee). Famous examples include Torchbearer, The Black Hack, Dungeon Crawl Classics, the Old School Reference and Index Compilation (OSRIC) and Old-School Essentials. Dungeon World isn’t usually counted as an OSR game, but it has many similarities. (It’s a translation of D&D-like fantasy into the now super popular “Powered by the Apocalypse” framework, created by Meguey & Vincent Baker for their post-apocalyptic RPG Apocalypse World.)\n\nThe six flavours of quarks are up, down, charmed, strange, top and bottom. “Flavour” is the name given to unique combinations of other characteristics like spin and charge; it’s sometimes also called “species”. Quarks form other particles, like neutrons and protons, when three of them are combined in different flavour combinations.\n\nThe World War II realtime Twitter account is @RealTimeWWII. It tweets “on this day” war events from the years 1939 to 1945, and is currently up to 1943 on its second time around.\n\nIn Chinese numerology, four – 四 (Anglicised as sì or sei) – is inauspicious because it sounds like the word for “death”, 死 (sǐ or séi). This causes as serious an aversion as Europeans traditionally have to the number thirteen, and just as some might have triskaidekaphobia, in China and other parts of East Asia, tetraphobia is common enough that buildings do not number floors using the digit 4.\n\n#Pratchat78 Notes and Errata\n\nThese are the episode notes and errata for Pratchat episode 78, “One Step Beyond”, discussing Terry Pratchett’s final collaboration with Stephen Baxter, 2016’s The Long Cosmos, with returning guests Joel Martin and Deanne Sheldon-Collins.\n\nNotes and Errata\n\nThe episode title is from the song “One Step Beyond”, originally by Jamaican artist Prince Buster, who released it as a B-side on his single “Al Capone” in 1964. Coincidentally the version of the original we could find on YouTube features footage of exactly the kind of exoticised “Egyptian” dancing we imagined Fred and Nobby doing in our episode about Jingo. (We don’t necessarily recommend listening to all Prince Buster’s back catalogue; the music is great, but some of the lyrics are misogynist at best.) In the UK and Australia, ”One Step Beyond” is much better known via the cover by Madness, a ska band from Camden who also took their name and other early covers from Prince Buster. The song was the title track on Madness’ first studio album, One Step Beyond (1979), and their second hit single.\n\nWe’ve previously discussed the The Long Earth:\n\nThe Long Earth in #Pratchat31, “It’s Just a Step to the West” (May 2020)\n\nThe Long War in #Pratchat46, “The Helen Green Preservation Society” (August 2021)\n\n“The High Meggas” in #Pratchat57West5, “Daniel Superbaboon” (July 2022)\n\nThe Long Mars in #Pratchat57, “Get Your Dad to Mars!” (August 2022)\n\nA recap of the first three books in #PratchatPreviously, “The Long Footnote” (July 2023)\n\nThe Long Utopia in #Pratchat69, “Long Fall Sally” (July 2023)\n\nA recap of the first four books in #PratchatPreviously2, “The Longer Footnote” (July 2024)\n\nThe Long Earth timeline only gets a bit longer in this book; here’s an updated (and simplified) list of major events to help you keep it all straight:\n\n1848-1895 – the adventures of Joshua’s ancestor, natural stepper Luis Valienté, culminating in “the Fund”, an organisation that bribes steppers to interbreed.

(The Long Cosmos)\n\n2030 – Lobsang and Joshua go on “The Journey” and meet Sally Linsay; they also find the Cueball Earth. Lobsang’s “ambulant unit” is left behind with First Person Singular on the far side of The Gap. Joshua (M28) meets Helen (F17). Rod Green delivers the suitcase nuke to Datum Madison. (The Long Earth)\n\n2031 – Joshua and Helen get married.

Joshua and Sally help the Next escape from military prison, and Joshua successfully talks Maggie out of blowing them up; they leave to establish the Grange, and Lobsang destroys Happy Landings with a meteorite. (The Long Mars) Lobsang “dies” in late fall; his funeral is in December.

(The Long Cosmos)\n\n2071 – The Thinker nears completion and Maggie, Joshua, the new Lobsang, Sancho and friends take three big steps North. (The Long Cosmos)\n\nStella Welch is not a new character; she appears briefly in The Long Utopia, held up as one of the brightest “pre-Emergence” Next in the Grange. She is also one of the Next who answers Lobsang’s call for help about New Springfield, and reveals the plan to recruit Stan to seal off that Earth.\n\nBen refers to “Martin” from the Humble; this is due to a typo in his notes. The character is actually Marvin Lovelace, who (as Liz rightly remembered in a bit cut for time) is one of the Next who appeared in The Long Utopia. In that book he’s a gambler, an undercover agent for the Next who found Stan Berg, and later answers Lobsang’s call for help alongside Stella. He seems briefly conflicted about Stan’s fate.\n\nMore notes coming soon.\n\nThanks for reading our notes! If we missed anything, or you have questions, please let us know.\n\n#Pratchat69 Notes and Errata\n\nThese are the episode notes and errata for Pratchat episode 69, “Long Fall Sally”, discussing Terry Pratchett’s penultimate collaboration with Stephen Baxter, 2015’s The Long Utopia, with returning guest Deanne Sheldon-Collins.\n\nNotes and Errata\n\nThe episode title puns on the song “Long Tall Sally”, written and originally recorded by Little Richard (with Robert “Bumps” Blackwell and Enotris Johnson) in 1956. Fittingly for The Long Earth, “Long Tall Sally” was famously covered by both The Kinks and The Beatles in 1964. Why call it that? Well…it’s a bit of a spoiler, but it’s obviously a reference to Long Earth supporting protagonist Sally Linsay, and you’ll understand if you’ve read the book (or when you get to the end of the episode).\n\nWe’ve previously discussed the The Long Earth:\n\nThe Long Earth in #Pratchat31, “It’s Just a Step to the West” (May 2020)\n\nThe Long War in #Pratchat46, “The Helen Green Preservation Society” (August 2021)\n\n“The High Meggas” in #Pratchat57West5, “Daniel Superbaboon” (July 2022)\n\nThe Long Mars in #Pratchat57, “Get Your Dad to Mars!” (August 2022)\n\nA recap of the first three books in #PratchatPreviously, “The Long Footnote” (July 2023)\n\nThe Long Utopia adds a lot of new events to the Long Earth timeline; here’s a short(ish) reference to put them in context with some years from the previous books.\n\n1848 – Luis Valienté is recruited by Oswald Hackett into the Knights of Discorporea.\n\n1852 – Luis and the other Knights, including Fraser Burdon, assist the Underground Railroad in America, then get rich by plundering other Earths’ gold veins.\n\n1871 – the Knights go on their final mission in Berlin before Mr Radcliffe tries to murder them. They go into hiding.\n\n1895 – Hackett meets with Luis and Burdon and they form “the Fund” to set up marriages between stepping families and ensure more steppers are born.\n\n1916 (or 1917) – Percy Blakeney accidentally steps to a nearby Earth in the prelude to The Long Earth.\n\n2001 – Freddie Burdon is contacted by the Fund and given Maria Valienté’s details.\n\n2002 – Maria, now 15, gives birth to Joshua in stepwise Madison.\n\n2015 – “Step Day”, when humanity at large learns of the Long Earth. Joshua is thirteen.\n\n2026 – 117 pioneers, including the Green family, arrive on Earth West 101,754 and found the town of Reboot.\n\n2028 – Helen’s mother, Tilda Green, dies sometime between this year and 2030.\n\n2030 – “The Journey”, Lobsang and Joshua’s trip from The Long Earth. Rod Green (Helen’s brother) blows up Datum Madison this year, around the same time as Joshua (aged 28) meets Helen Green (aged 17).\n\n2031 – Joshua and Helen get married.\n\n2036 – Cassie Poulson is the first human to encounter the “silver beetles” in New Springfield on Earth West 1,217,756.\n\n2040 – Maggie’s mission captaining The Benjamin Franklin, Roberta’s trip with the Chinese East Twenty Million mission, and most of the rest of The Long War. The Yellowstone supervolcano erupts. Stan Berg is born.\n\n2045 – Maggie’s mission as captain of the Neil Armstrong II, and Sally’s trip to Mars with Willis and Frank. Lobsang dies in late fall this year, and his funeral is in December.\n\n2052 – Joshua turns 50 and does his 100,000 steps walk. Nikos finds the Gallery and meets the silver beetles.\n\n2054 – “George”, Agnes and Ben settle in New Springfield.\n\n2056 – Agnes realises something is wrong with the world and discovers the beetles. Stan is approached by Roberta Golding to join the Next in the Grange and declines.\n\n2058 – Lobsang and Joshua investigate Earth West 1,217,756 and uncover the beetles’ plans. Six months later in Fall, Joshua finds Sally and they retrieve the old Lobsang from Earth West 174,827,918, the home of the Traversers.\n\n2059 – Early in the year, Stan, “George” and Sally “cauterise” Earth West 1,217,756 just before it is destroyed by the beetles.\n\nThe new English translation of Journey to the West, the Chinese folk novel by Wu Chen’en, is Julia Lovell’s from 2021, titled Monkey King. The titular Monkey is a trouble-making immortal recruited to aid a Buddhist monk in fetching scriptures from a monastery in India. This is meant to redeem Monkey for his previous misdeeds, including upsetting the order of Heaven, but he refuses to behave. The monk, Tripitaka, tricks Monkey into putting on a cap that conceals a metal band, which he is able to tighten around Monkey’s head with a secret spell (referred to as the “headache sutra” in the famous Japanese television version of the story). This doesn’t injure Monkey – he is made of stone, it’s a whole thing – but it does cause him intense headaches which Tripitaka uses to rein in his violent impulses.\n\nJoshua was 13 on Step Day, not 14 as Ben guesses. He was born in 2002, not 2001.\n\nWhile we’re working out how to pronounce Nikos, Liz mentions “Nikolaj”, Charles Boyle’s adopted son in the police sitcom Brooklyn-99. The precise pronunciation of Nikolaj’s name is a repeated gag and character moment between Boyle and his partner, best friend and idol, Jake Peralta.\n\nAs we’ll mention next episode, the Valhalla Belt references Strata as the main characters live in an alternate universe where Erik Leifsson made it to the Americas, united with its indigenous peoples and formed a nation called Valhalla, which dominated the world through superior technology.\n\nJoshua is eleven years older than Helen, and first met her when she was 17. They got married in 2031, when he was 29 and she was 18. Freddie was 17 when he had sex with Maria, who was 14; she was actually 15 by the time she gives birth in May 2002, though this doesn’t change our opinions much.\n\nThe “10,000 steps” Ben mentions are actually the “Seven Thousand Steps”, a paved path that winds around the mountain known as The Throat of the World in the videogame The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Climbing the steps is an early part of the main quest; they lead to the monastery of High Hrothgar, where the Greybeards await the arrival of the player character, who is the Dragonborn – a prophesied hero with the power of the Voice, able to speak the magical language of dragons.\n\nWe put some of the dates in the timeline above, but Ben is correct about the history of the Green family, especially about her mother, Tilda, being the driving force behind their migration. They first tried settling in Madison West 2, but it wasn’t far enough away; they then invested heavily in the development of Madison West 5, but didn’t make enough money to leave their Datum jobs behind. Tilda wanted her own dream, not someone else’s, and convinced the family to head out into the further Long Earth, abandoning Rod and all their other ties to the Datum to join the group who founded Reboot in 2026. She died of cancer between 2028 and 2030, and no-one told Rod; he seemed to think she was still alive when he was captured by Monica, minutes before the bomb went off.\n\nLiz compares Willis Linsay to Tom Wambsgans from Succession, a character in the popular HBO series about a wealthy family, headed by Logan Roy (Brian Cox), who owns the global media empire Waystar. As the title suggests, a large part of the drama revolves around who will succeed the ailing Logan as head of the company. Tom (Matthew Macfayden) is a Waystar executive who marries Logan’s youngest child, Shiv (Sarah Snook); he is thus close to, but not truly part of, the family’s inner circle. The series ran for four seasons between 2018 and 2023.\n\nBen makes a joke about “love languages”, which we’ve mentioned before; in brief they’re a highly reductive, heteronormative and traditional theory about the ways in which people like to show and be shown affection. In the original version, invented by an American pastor, there are five, but really the useful thing to take from the concept is that different folks like to show and receive love in different ways.\n\nThe short story “The High Meggas”, Pratchett’s original exploration of the ideas behind The Long Earth, was written in the 1980s; he gives the year 1986, though that conflicts with some accounts of what else he was working on at the time. Ben compares Sally Linsay to Larry Linsay, the protagonist of that story, who is more or less a combination of Sally and her father Willis: one of the inventors of the “moving belt” (the story’s equivalent of the Stepper Box) who ends up living far from other humans in the High Meggers (which are spelt with an “a” in the story). We discussed the short story in #Pratchat57West5, “Daniel Superbaboon”.\n\nAs we’ve mentioned in our previous Long Earth episodes, complete drafts of the final three novels were finished in 2013, and were full collaborations up to that point. It is true that Baxter did the final polishing and tweaking after that, with only minimal involvement from Pratchett, who had moved on to Raising Steam and The Shepherd’s Crown. Relevant to this episode’s discussion, they did plan the series as a five-book arc right at the start, probably in 2010 or 2011. Thanks again to Marc Burrows, author of The Magic of Terry Pratchett, from which most of this information is drawn. (There’s surprisingly little about The Long Earth in A Life With Footnotes.)\n\nLiz’s reference to Nelson Azikiwe’s “sex barge” is his trip with Lobsang to meet Second Person Singular, a Traverser off the coast of New Zealand somewhere around Earth West 700. The society of islanders there has some things in common with the community of the Next in the Grange, included them being quite relaxed about casual sex. His encounter with Cassie for “a little wiggle” is recounted (subtly) in Chapter 60 of The Long War.\n\nThe Knights of Discorporea use their own terms for stepping, since no global consensus has been reached. Luis Valienté doesn’t have a name for stepping, but uses “dexter” and “sinister” for the directions, Latin words for right and left respectively (a clue to Luis’ more educated early life). Hackett calls stepping “Waltzing”, and uses “widdershins” and “deiseal” for the directions. Pratchett fans will be well familiar with widdershins, which as discussed in the episode notes for #Pratchat30 is an old English word (not an Old English word) which means anti-clockwise, or to move around something by keeping it on your left. Deiseal comes from Irish and means movement “to the right”, or clockwise, making it a good if oddly chosen opposite to widdershins. (A variant word, deasil, just means clockwise.) We presume widdershins and sinister map to “West”, and deiseal and dexter to “East”, since that’s how those compass directions appear on a European map in the usual orientation.\n\nX-Men: First Class is the 2011 prequel film showing the origins of the X-Men, a group of mutant superheroes recruited as teenagers by powerful mutant telepath Charles Xavier in his quest to appease the humans who hate and fear them. (That’s possibly a bit harsh, but we’ve been thinking about the superhero as upholder of the status quo recently.) The film was originally intended as a reboot of the X-Men film franchise, but the next film, X-Men: Days of Future Past linked it to the existing X-Men films and established it as a prequel.\n\nThe Chartists were a working class movement for political reform in the UK, founded in 1838. They demanded a number of changes to improve British democracy, including an expansion of suffrage (though not to women), secret ballots, and less restrictive requirements for who could stand for the House of Commons. The reforms were supported by millions of working class folks, who presented petitions to parliament, but they didn’t see any of their desired changes adopted until after the movement died out in 1857. The “uprising” of April 1848 was part of a renewed interest in Chartism following the French Revolution, and was really a peaceful meeting when a new petition was intended to be brought to parliament by a procession of Chartists. But the government, who strongly opposed the reforms, enacted old and new laws to make the procession illegal, and had huge numbers of police in attendance (including 100,000 special constables!). In the end the meeting ended without the planned procession, though it is true that many were moved to violently oppose the oppression of the government, and presumably those would have been the “agents” removed by the Knights. They are still working for the government agains the common folk, though.\n\nWhen Liz says that “in Doctor Who, Queen Victoria is a werewolf”, she is referring to the episode “Tooth and Claw” from season two of the revived series, when the Tenth Doctor and Rose encounter a recently bereaved Queen Victoria on a trip across the Scottish highlands where she is attacked by an alien werewolf. It is suggested that she may have been bitten by the wolf, and as Rose and the Doctor depart they wonder if this means the Royal Family are indeed all werewolves.\n\nPrince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, German Prince Consort to Queen Victoria, was a noted small-L liberal with great influence over the Queen. He had an interest in many progressive ideas and social reforms, including support of emancipation (as seen in The Long Utopia), technology, education, science and the welfare of the working class, including raising the working age. While this makes him sound pretty great, it’s important to remember this was all from a fairly paternalistic “we must care for those less fortunate than us” perspective, and he had no desire to lessen his own power or position, but his heart does seem to have been in the right place. His European ambitions seem to stem at least in part from a fear for his royal relatives, especially in the mid 19th century in the wake of the many revolutions in continental Europe. He’s perhaps best remembered for championing the Royal Exhibition of 1851, for which the Crystal Palace was built, and which probably wouldn’t have happened without his campaigning.\n\nQueen Charlotte is the monarch in the alternate reality “Regency”-era of the Bridgerton television series, based on the series of romance novels by Julia Quinn. The story of her marriage to King George III is told in the spin-off mini-series Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, released in May 2023. Ben edits a Bridgerton podcast, What Would Danbury Do?, who covered Queen Charlotte in episode 40, “Sorrows, Prayers and Enduring Love”, with guest Maxine Beneba Clarke.\n\nThere’s no directly Biblical evidence for Mary’s age at the time of Jesus’s birth, but based on marriage customs many historians have said she was likely to be a teenager. Sources we’ve found have suggested she was maybe 14 when Gabriel appeared to her to give her the news, but 15 or even 16 when Jesus was actually born. But there’s no official answer, and she is most often depicted as an adult woman, as she would have been in any case at the time of Jesus’ crucifiction.\n\nLiz mentions Joshua’s Tree, a reference to U2’s 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which itself is named after an actual species of tree native to the Mojave Desert in America. It was named by Mormon settlers, who thought it looked like Joshua raising his hands in prayer. It’s first three tracks are three of U2’s biggest hits: “Where the Streets Have No Name”, “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” and “With or Without You”.\n\nBill Chambers’ story about the Cueball is, in fact, word for word the same in The Long War chapter 58, and The Long Utopia chapter 1, save that in this book there are a couple of asides to remind us about the history of the Long Earth. The Cueball was first mentioned, very briefly, in chapter 28 of The Long Earth.\n\nThe Southern Vampire series – not to be confused with the Vampire Chronicles, which is a whole other thing – are a series of books written by American author Charlaine Harris. Also known as the Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries, they follow protagonist Sookie, a telepathic waitress living in the town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, in a world where vampires have made themselves public knowledge following the development of a blood substitute called “Tru Blood”. (Oh yes – it’s the series that spawned the TV show True Blood, though it’s a loose adaptation.)\n\nThe Book of Matthew pretty unambigiously states that Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’s twelve close disciples, did betray Jesus, identifying him to soldiers with a kiss in exchange for a bribe of thirty pieces of silver. Other Biblical writings say Judas was influenced by the Devil to do this, rather than the money being his motivation, and some say Jesus foresaw his betrayal and allowed it since it was part of God’s plan. This has led to something of a contradiction; was he following God’s plan, controlled by Satan, or exercising free will? Bertrand Russell and other philosophers have written about this.\n\nThomas Moore’s Utopia was first published in 1516, originally in Latin. The title is derived from Greek and literally translates to “nowhere” or “no place”.\n\nThe band that would become The Beatles first formed in 1956 as The Quarrymen, named after their school, Quarry Bank High School, and specifically the start of the school song, “Quarry men old before our birth”. Throughout their early career that went through several names, including in 1960 the Beatals, The Silver Beetles, and for the first time, The Beatles. They were also known for a brief time in 1961 as The Savage Young Beatles, hence Ben’s mash-up of “The Savage Silver Beatles”.\n\nBen mentions Star Trek being set “150 years in the future”, which would place it in the mid-23rd century. That’s about right for the original series of Star Trek, in which James Kirk becomes captain of the USS Enterprise from around the year 2265. However Ben is more thinking of Star Trek: The Next Generation, which takes place 100 years later in the 24th century: Jean-Luc Picard takes command of the newly launched USS Enterprise D in 2364.\n\nThe Cavern Club was a jazz club in Liverpool which opened in 1957, inspired by jazz clubs in Paris. As rock and roll began to take off in London, it became one of the central venues, and the Beatles played many of their early important gigs there as early as 1958, when they were still called The Quarrymen. The club is still open, though it closed for a time in the 1970s and 80s during the construction of an underground train route. There may well have been clubs called The Gallery or The Observatory, but they don’t seem to have played a big part in rock and roll history if so.\n\nWe mention a few other von Neumann replicators in fiction include:\n\nThe alien Replicators in Stargate: SG-1, who initially appear as insect-like robots made of multiple identical pieces. They first appear in the season 3 episode “Nemesis”, where they are the great enemy being fought in a war by the advanced alien Asgardians. They return many times in multiple forms in both SG1 and its spin-off Stargate: Atlantis. As Liz mentions, their origins are later explored, most notably in the fifth season episode of Stargate: SG-1, “Menace”.\n\nThe Slylandro Probes appear in the 1992 videogame Star Control II: The Ur-Quan Masters, recently re-released as Free Stars: The Ur-Quan Masters. The probes seem to be working for someone, though exactly who – and why they are so hostile – is one of many mysteries the player can choose to solve in the game.\n\nAnother example we didn’t mention comes from the weird 1990s sci-fi series Lexx, in which drones resembling flying robotic arms also act like von Neumann replicators.\n\nFreeman Dyson (1923-2020; no relation to the dude who invents vacuum cleaners) was a British-American physicist who contributed a lot of enduring ideas to science and science fiction. (One of them, thankfully, was not his skepticism of climate change.) The two here are:\n\nThe Dyson Sphere was a thought experiment about how a super-advanced species might efficiently capture all the energy it could need from its own sun. The basic idea – a huge spherical construction around a star – pre-dates Dyson, first appearing in the 1937 novel Star Maker by Olaf Stapleton, and also J. D. Bernal’s 1929 nonfiction book The World, the Flesh, and the Devil: An Enquiry Into the Future of the Three Enemies of the Rational Soul. Both of these were inspirations for Dyson, who wrote about the idea of a sphere in his paper ‘Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation’ for Science in 1959. He didn’t call it a Dyson sphere himself, and indeed didn’t imagine an actual sphere, but instead a spherical group of independent solar collectors. The idea took many sci-fi writers imaginations, with variations appearing in novels like Ringworld throughout the 1970s and beyond. Dyson thought the popular sci-fi depiction – of a literal solid sphere, as in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode ‘Relics’ – impossible.\n\nThe Dyson planetary spin motor seems to come from Dyson’s 1966 essay ‘The Search for Extraterrestrial Technology’, published in Perspectives in Modern Physics. The beetles use exactly his method, including how to accelerate the planet’s rotation.\n\nIn Star Trek: The Next Generation, the Borg Collective are faction of cybernetic organisms first encountered in the second season episode ‘Q Who’. The possess (more or less) a group consciousness and superior technology, and seek to “assimilate” all other forms of life into the Collective, mostly by infecting other humanoids with nanites which transform them into more Borg. Like the Silver Beetles, they generally ignore beings they do not consider a threat, prioritising their current tasks. The Cybermen in Doctor Who are a similar concept, though they are not often written as well.\n\nTaskmaster is a British comedy gameshow in which guest comedians compete to complete ridiculous “tasks” set by the hosts, Greg Davies, the taskmaster who judges the winner, and show creator Alex Horne, who acts as a meeker referee to make sure contestants follow the rules of each task. It debuted in 2015 on UK digital channel Dave, moving to Channel 4 in 2020, and has run so far (as of mid-2024) for 17 series and more than 150 episodes. Local versions have been created in many countries, including one for Australia and New Zealand on Channel 10 in 2023, hosted by taskmaster Tom Gleeson and referee Tom Cashman.\n\nThe trope of someone being eaten alive by tiny creatures – often until there’s nothing left, except maybe bones – appears in lots of places:\n\nThe X-Files episode Liz remembers with the glowing green bugs is “Darkness Falls” from the show’s first season in 1994.\n\nThe tiny dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are “compys”, short for Procompsognathus; they appear in the first novel, and then become one of several unused elements from that novel used in the sequels, in this case Jurassic Park: The Lost World.\n\nIn the 1999 film The Mummy (a guilty favourite of this podcast), one of the terrors in the Mummy’s tomb is a hoard of scarabs that can devour you in seconds.\n\nDefying Doomsday is a 2016 anthology from Australian publisher Twelfth Planet Press. It’s a collection of post-apocalyptic fiction featuring disabled and chronically ill protagonists, and won a Ditmar Award for Best Anthology; it includes the story “Did We Break the End of the World?” by friend of the show Tansy Rayner-Roberts, which also won a Ditmar for best novelette or novella. It was followed in 2020 by Rebuilding Tomorrow, a similar anthology with a more hopeful theme, which won an Aurealis Award for Best Anthology in 2021. (It’s not clear if these are still in print.)\n\nDeanne recommended the The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells, a series beginning with All Systems Red.\n\nThanks for reading our notes! If we missed anything, or you have questions, please let us know.\n\n#Pratchat77 Notes and Errata\n\nThese are the episode notes and errata for Pratchat episode 77, “How to Get Below in Advertising”, discussing the 1963 short story “The Hades Business” with guest Lucas Testro.\n\nIconographic Evidence\n\nThe specific Bob Newhart advertising sketch that Lucas was thinking of is this one about Abraham Lincoln. (See also the further note about Bob Newhart below.)\n\nNotes and Errata\n\nThe episode title refers to the 1989 British black comedy film How to Get Ahead in Advertising, starring Richard E Grant and written and directed by Bruce Robinson (both of Withnail and I fame).\n\nYou can find a digital copy of the August 1963 issue of Science Fantasy magazine at the Internet Archive here.\n\nThe Unfriendly Future was published in October 1965 by Four Square Books, edited by Tom Baordman, Jr. (As Ben guessed, Pratchett was indeed 17 at the time.) The book included the following stories, mostly previously published in John Carnell’s magazines:\n\nRusskies Go Home!, a 1960 novelette by Mack Reynolds\n\n“The Food Goes in the Top”, a 1961 short story by Will Mohler (as Will Worthington)\n\nDanger: Religion!, a 1962 novella by Brian W. Aldiss\n\n“Rescue Operation”, a 1964 short story by Harry Harrison\n\n“The Hades Business”, a 1963 short story by Terry Pratchett\n\nThe Seed of Violence, a 1958 novelette by Jay Williams\n\nMervyn Peake (1911-1968) is best known as the author of the fantasy novel Titus Groan and its sequels, Gormenghast and Titus Alone, usually referred to as the Gormenghast series. Peake intended to write many more books in this series, but only completed the three novels and a novella, Boy in Darkness, before he died from Parkinson’s Disease. which was republished in 2007 reconstructed from his handwritten manuscript (the original version having errors produced from misreadings of the manuscript). Peake was also a poet, playwright and illustrator, and illustrated editions of many books including his own, Alice in Wonderland, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.\n\nBrian Aldiss (1925-2017) was a prolific British science fiction writer best known for his Helliconia trilogy of novels (Helliconia Spring, Helliconia Summer and Helliconia Winter, published between 1982 and 1985) which chronicle the history of a civilisation on an otherwise Earth-like planet with incredibly long seasons. He also wrote the 1969 short story “Super Toys Last All Summer Long” which decades later inspired the Stanley Kubrick/Stephen Spielberg film A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Like Pratchett, his first published story was published by John Carnell in Science Fantasy, 1958’s “Criminal Record”, though he was considerably older, having spent his younger years in the army and working as a bookseller and editor. He was was a long-time collaborator with Harry Harrison, and the two were part of the “British New Wave” of science fiction. As related in A Life With Footnotes, Terry and his mate Dave met Brian Aldiss (and Harrison) at the 1965 Eastercon in Birmingham.\n\nWe previously mentioned Harry Harrison (1925-2012) in #Pratchat72, “The Masked Dancer”. Harrison was an American science fiction author best known for his character the “Stainless Steel Rat”, an interplanetary con man and rogue who first appeared in an eponymous novel in 1957. He also wrote the 1966 dystopian novel Make Room! Make Room!, which was adapted (very loosely) into the film Soylent Green in 1973. (If you know one thing about the film, it’s not in the novel.) Pratchett is known to have been a fan of Harrison’s work, considering Bill, the Galactic Hero to be the funniest science fiction novel ever written over The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (which he also rated, to be clear), considering that the former novel wasn’t a big hit because not enough readers were familiar with the source material being parodied. He also met Harrison at science fiction conventions as a teenager.\n\n“Stagger soup” doesn’t seem to be a Pratchett invention, but existing slang for whiskey – though most sources we could find say it’s from North America (some say it’s still in use in Canada), perhaps dating from the prohibition era. Our guess would be that Pratchett found it through American sci-fi writing. “Joy-juice” has similarly American origins, perhaps inspired by “Kickapoo Joy Juice”, a fictional beverage from the comic strip Li’l Abner, and which was later turned into a real life soft drink by the Monarch Beverage Company in 1965.\n\nThe Good Place is one of Ben’s favourite sictoms, following Eleanor Shellstrop (played by Kristen Bell), a terrible, selfish young woman from Arizona who dies and ends up in “The Good Place”, a heaven-like afterlife. Eleanor quickly realises she’s been swapped with someone else by mistake, and convinces her supposed soul mate, ethics professor Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), to help her learn to be a better person so she can belong there. Over it’s four short seasons the show evolves a lot and has many twists and turns it’s more fun to discover yourself, but it is a plot point in later episodes that there are many more people in The Bad Place than The Good Place.\n\nDonald Cotton (1928-1999), the subject of Lucas’ documentary Myth Maker: The Legend of Donald Cotton, was a British writer for radio, television and stage. He is best known for the early Doctor Who stories he wrote which took the show in a more comedic direction: “The Myth Makers”, in which the Doctor travels to the Trojan war, and “The Gunfighters”, in which he gets mixed up in the famous gunfight at the O. K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. He’d likely have written more, but the new producers of the show decided not to do so many historical episodes. He also helped create the television program Adam Adamant Lives!, a later project of Doctor Who co-creators Verity Lambert and Sydney Newman.\n\nBedazzled is a 1967 film written by Peter Cook in which George Spiggot (played by Cook), a man claiming to be the Devil, offers meek and depressed cook Stanley Moon (Dudley Moore) seven wishes. None of them, of course, go as planned – it’s more or less a parody of Faust. While there’s some very witty and clever stuff in there, it should also be said that the entire premise revolves around Moon wanting to date a waitress (played by Eleanor Bron) at the hamburger place where he works, and it has some very 1967 ideas which don’t really stand up today. A 2000 remake, also titled Bedazzled and directed and co-written by Ghostbusters’ Harold Ramis, starred Brendan Fraser as Elliott Richards, an equivalent to Stanley Moon who pines for a woman he works with at a computer company. Elizabeth Hurley played The Devil, who doesn’t go by an alias.\n\nBob Newhart (born 1929) is an American comedian who found fame in 1960 when his album The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart became the first comedy album to reach number one in the American charts (it also reached number two in the UK). The advertising sketch mentioned by Lucas is “Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue” from that album, and in a 2005 interview Newhart claimed it was his own favourite. Newhart went on to a successful screen career, with his own sitcoms The Bob Newhart Show (1972-1978) and Newhart (1982-1990), and subsequent appearances in films and other shows, including the recurring role of “Professor Proton” in The Big Bang Theory and its spin-off Young Sheldon.\n\nBewitched (1964-1972) is an American fantasy sitcom starring Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha, a witch who against the wishes and advice of her mother and community, marries a “mortal” man, Darrin Stephens (originally Dick York; he was replaced by Dick Sargent for the last three seasons due to illness). The series was created by comedy writer Sol Saks, based in part on the 1942 film I Married a Witch. Like the ad man in Newhart’s sketch, Darrin works on Madison Avenue for the fictional firm of McMann and Tate, his boss being one of the named partners, Larry Tate.\n\nWe get into a bit of business jargon familiar to Australian freelancers here, so let us explain. A sole trader – not a “soul trader”, though we considered that as a title for this episode – is a business classification used in Australia. It’s basically a one-person company, and costs very little to set up; the downside is that there’s no limited liability as there is in other structures. All Australian businesses require an Australian Business Number, or ABN, to identify them. GST is the Australian Goods and Services Tax, a 10% value-added tax introduced in 2000 on most goods and services sold in Australia. Companies (including sole traders) with revenue of more than $75,000 a year are required to register for GST, which means that they have to charge GST to their customers and pay that to the Australian Tax Office (ATO), but can also claim the GST they pay on good and services bought to run the business as a credit, reducing the GST payment they make to the ATO.\n\nThe story about Pratchett almost buying a DeLorean appears in chapter 15 of A Life With Footnotes.\n\nGeryon was a giant in classical mythology said to have three heads. The name was later used by Dante in his Inferno as the name of greater demon, the Monster of Fraud, who is more like a dragon; Dante and Virgil ride on its back into the eighth circle, where those who committed fraud in life are found.\n\nA “noodle incident” is a comedy fiction trope in which a past incident is referred to by characters but never explained. It takes its name from an example in the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip, in which the characters often refer to “the noodle incident” but writer Bill Watterson decided to never explain it since the readers’ imagination will always be better than than anything he could come up with. Pratchett is fond of them, the major Discworld example being what happened to Mr Hong’s restaurant, The Three Jolly Luck Takeaway Fish Bar, which seemingly disappeared from Ankh-Morpork after being build on an old Temple of Dagon.\n\nBertrand Russell (1872-1970) was a British public intellectual best known as a philosopher and political activist. A lifelong pacifist, Russell opposed Britain’s participation in the First World War, leading to him being convicted under wartime censorship acts in 1916. He was fined £100 and when he refused to pay, hoping to be sent to prison to further attention for the cause, his books were siezed and sold at auction; most were bought by his friends and returned to him, some stamped as confiscated by the police. He was subsequently dismissed from his position at Trinity College London, though this was an unpopular decision and he was reinstated in 1919. He generally regarded religion as a form of superstition and an impediment to moral and social progress, describing himself as an agnostic or atheist, publishing an essay “Why I Am Not a Christian” in 1927. His most famous work is Principia Mathematica, a book laying out the principles of mathematical and symbolic logic, written with Alfred North Whitehead and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913. It was a follow up to Russell’s earlier 1903 work The Principles of Mathematics. His other famous works include the essay “In Praise of Idleness”, and the books Power: A New Social Analysis and A History of Western Philosophy. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950.\n\nSatan in the Suburbs was Bertrand Russell’s first work of fiction, published in 1953 – rather earlier than Ben remembered. It collected three novelettes, Satan in the Suburbs or Horrors Manufactured Here, The Corsican Ordeal of Miss X (which had been previously published anonymously) and The Infra-Redioscope, plus two short stories, “The Guardians of Parnassus” and “Benefit of Clergy”. The book was apparently well-received at the time, but modern readers aren’t so kind. The titular story is more or less a variant on “The Monkey’s Paw”, in which four ordinary people respond to a plaque on the suburban house of the mysterious Dr Mallako, and don’t get what they bargained for. Russell’s journey to fiction writing was sort of opposite to Pratchett’s, coming near the end of his life – he was 80 when he wrote these stories.\n\nHades is a hit videogame developed by Supergiant Games, previously best known for their breakout hit Bastion. It’s a rogue-like game, meaning the player enters a series of randomised levels of increasing difficulty and likely dies before reaching the end, which sends them back to the start; but they improve in skill each time, making them able to get further on subsequent attempts. The player character is Zagreus, a reasonably obscure figure from Greek mythology who in some stories is the sone of Zeus, and in others the son of Hades. In the game he is the latter, and journeys through the Underworld in an attempt to find out how and why his mother, Persephone, has left. In the game, Cerberus is seen having a rest next to the desk of Hades where he receives new souls; the player is able to speak to him and pat and scratch his heads. A sequel, Hades II, is in early access; the player is no longer Zagreus, but instead his sister Melinoë, another character who is said to have been fathered by Zeus.\n\nHeck is a 2013 graphic novel by Eisner Award-nominated American comic creator Zander Cannon, published by Top Shelf Comix. It collects the original comic which first appeared in Top Shelf’s digital magazine Double Barrel. In the novel, protagonist Hector “Heck” Hammarskjöld inherits his estranged father’s house and discovers a portal to the Underworld in the basement. He initially uses it to settle disputes around wills by contacting the souls of the dead, but eventually gets drawn into a bigger adventure that sees him travel through the Circles of Hell. Cannon’s most recent series is Kaijumax for Oni Press, about a prison for giant monsters, published in six volumes between 2015 and 2022.\n\nWe discussed Faust Eric way back in #Pratchat7, “All the Fingle Ladies”, with guest Georgina Chadderton.\n\nWe discussed Good Omens (the novel) in #Pratchat15, “It’s the End of the World (and I feel Nice and Accurate)”, with guests Jennifer Beckett and Amy Gray.\n\nThe traditional marketing mix was introduced by American marketing professor E. Jerome McCarthy in his 1960 book Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach. The original version, itself an evolution of earlier ideas, was “the Four Ps of Marketing”: product, price, place and promotion. It was extended in 1981 by Booms and Bitner into the “Seven Ps”, adding not just “people” but “process” and “physical evidence”. Modern usage seems to vary with anything between four and seven “P”s, depending on who you ask and what industry is involved.\n\nMatt Damon’s 2021 crypto ad, “Fortune Favours the Brave”, featured the actor walking between exhibits of supposedly great human endeavour and exhorting the viewer to be bold…and invest in cryptocurrency using the exchange crypto.com. Damon later said he only did it to support the charity water.org, which tries to improve access to safe drinking water to communities worldwide. American actor (and ex-economist) Ben McKenzie, who wrote the book Easy Money about the crypto fad, gave his highly critical opinion about the ad (and what it was trying to sell) in many places, including a January 2022 episode of the Slate podcast What Next: TBD.\n\nThe “comma, for the use of” jokes are primarily seen in Men at Arms (as discussed in #Pratchat1, “Boots Theory”) when Fred Colon is handing out equipment to the new recruits, though it returns as a callback once or twice.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is the sixth game in the satirical post-apocalyptic Fallout series. The games are set in the wastelands of a future America, decimated by a nuclear war with China in 2077, though the pre-War America of the games was a 1950s retro-futuristic vision of nuclear-powered cars and household robots. The first couple of games were made in the late 1990s by Black Isle Studios (originally under a different name), but following a couple of spin-off games, the license for the franchise was acquired by Bethesda Softworks, makers of the hugely successful Elder Scrolls series of fantasy roleplaying games. They made Fallout 3 in 2008, the first game to have a modern first person perspective, but some fans thought it lost too much of the satirical tone of the originals. Obsidian Entertainment, another studio which included developers who’d worked on earlier Fallout games, pitched an idea for another game using the Fallout engine set in a different part of the game’s America; it was accepted and released in 2010 as Fallout: New Vegas. In the game, the player is a Courier given the job of delivering a special poker chip to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas, but they are waylaid by a gangster working with the Great Khans, a local tribe of raiders, who steal the chip, shoot the character and leave them for dead. They survive and try to find the chip and complete the job, along the way altering the future of the entire Mojave Wasteland, which is being fought over by the Khans, the New California Republic, and the mysterious Mr House, who controls New Vegas itself.\n\nMonty Python, as we’re sure you probably know, were a British comedy group formed in 1969, best known for their television sketch series Monty Python’s Flying Circus which ran from 1969 to 1974, and their films, which most relevantly here include Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), in which God appears to King Arthur as a cut-out animation of bearded man in a cloud, created like all the Python animations by Terry Gilliam. Their next film, Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979), follows the mis-adventures of a man born at the same time as Jesus and mistaken for a messiah; God does not appear, though Jesus is seen from a distance giving the Sermon on the Mount.\n\nRoland Emmerich’s Independence Day (1996) is an overtly patriotic American action film about an alien invasion starring an ensemble cast including Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman. When the immense alien saucers arrive in Earth’s atmosphere (launched from an even bigger mothership in high orbit), they create clouds to shield themselves from view.\n\nKevin Smith’s Dogma (1999) is a fantasy film in which two exiled angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) plan to re-enter Heaven by exploiting an open offer of indulgence from an American Cardinal. Early on in the film, protagonist Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) is visited by Metatron (Alan Rickman), a Seraphim who is the Voice of God. As he explains: ‘Human beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand the awesome power of God’s true voice. Were you to hear it, your mind would cave in and your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adams before we figured that one out.’\n\nPandæmonium – not Pandæmomium, as Ben mis-speaks it here – is the name invented for the capital city of Hell by British poet John Milton in his famous 1667 epic Paradise Lost. It draws on Greek, and translates roughly as “place of all demons”.\n\nThe “sand ropes” stories can be found in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther folktale index as type 1174, “Deceiving the Devil with a Rope of Sand”. Examples can be found in Scotland, England, Ireland and Germany. Some of the stories star Michael Scot, a thirteenth century mathematician and astrologer.\n\nThe issue of Science Fantasy in which the story first appeared was volume 20, number 60, published in August 1963. A digital version of the issue is available via the Internet Archive; the link will take you to the first page of “The Hades Business”.\n\nJanet is one of the major characters of The Good Place, played by D’Arcy Carden. While she frequently has to remind the human characters that she is “not a robot” and “not a girl”, Janet is the afterlife equivalent of a computer interface, able to access all knowledge and providing the means for Architects of the afterlife to create the Neighbourhoods in which human souls live out existence. Carden also plays other versions of Janet, including Bad Janet (the Bad Place’s ruder equivalent), and Neutral Janet (the very bland version who works in the “Accounting Department” responsible for deciding who goes where after death).\n\nBenidorm isn’t the kind of place Ben is thinking of – it’s not even in the UK! It’s a municipality on the southeastern coast of Spain. It became a major tourist destination in the 1980s, has three world-renowned beaches, and has a famous hotel which is one of the tallest buildings in Spain. There’s also a popular British sitcom set there, also called Benidorm, which ran on ITV from 2007 to 2018. It follows a large ensemble cast of British holidaymakers from various social classes who make repeat visits to an all-inclusive holiday resort in Benidorm, though the cast changed significantly over the ten series.\n\nSkegness is more the kind of place Ben is talking about. Located on the Lincolnshire coast on the East of Britain, Skegness was formerly one of the most popular holiday resort towns in the UK, but went into decline from the 1970s as overseas holidays became cheaper. It’s the home of the original Butlin’s holiday camp, now known as Butlins Skegness, and one of only three still in operation, the rest having closed in the 1980s and 1990s. It’s a bit fancier than our description makes it sound, with pools and activities and entertainment, and a range of different types of accomodation.\n\nBetter Than a Poke in the Eye is the British fantasy newsletter formerly known as Discworld Monthly. Its creators, Jason and Rachel, appeared in our special Discworld anniversary episode, “How Did Discworld Get to 40?” The Llamedos Holiday Camp now runs every two years, with the next one in 2026, themed as “The Llamedos Hogs Ball 2026”.\n\nThe Prisoner is a 1967 television series created by Irish actor Patrick McGoohan (1928-2009), best known at the time for starring as spy John Dake in the earlier spy series Danger Man. Danger Man initially only lasted one season in 1960, and afterwards McGoohan was offered the role of James Bond, and Simon Templar in The Saint; he turned both down on moral grounds, mostly because as a Catholic he objected to those characters’ promiscuity (he famously insisted on no kissing in Danger Man). The popularity of Bond led to a Danger Man revival in 1964 that made McGoohan the highest-paid television actor in the UK. The show was a hit in the UK and America, where it was re-titled Secret Agent and had the popular theme song “Secret Agent Man”. It inspired various copycats and spoofs, including the cartoon Danger Mouse. McGoohan’s star power also got him more control over the show, and when he was announced he was quitting, was able to negotiate to make a new series of his own devising: The Prisoner. The premise was that a spy angrily quits his job, but after leaving the agency’s office is abducted and taken to a weird, almost surreal holiday camp known as “The Village”, where everyone is referred to only by number – the protagonist is “Number Six”. The secret controllers of the camp use all kinds of bizarre gambits to try and find out why Number Six quit the agency, but he refuses to tell them, and makes repeated attempts to escape and discover who is in charge – the mysterious and never seen Number One. Each episode features a different Number Two, who acts on behalf of Number One. Though originally conceived as a mini-series of just seven episodes, The Prisoner was extended to seventeen episodes, broadcast in 1967 and 1968. It got behind schedule, though, and a final two colour episodes of Danger Man (shown in the US as a telemovie) were broadcast in the first two weeks of its timeslot, instead of after the finale as originally planned. The finale is…well, it’s a whole other discussion, but let’s just say opinion is fairly sharply divided on the ending. But the show itself is otherwise seen as something of a weird masterpiece, and Ben highly recommends you check out some of the best episodes.\n\nThanks for reading our notes! If we missed anything, or you have questions, please let us know.\n\n#EeekClub2024 Notes and Errata\n\nThese are the episode notes and errata for our special Glorious 25th of May episode, “Eeek Club 2024“, discussing topics chosen by our Eeek tier subscribers.\n\nIconographic Evidence\n\nNotes and Errata\n\nIf you need an explanation of the Glorious 25th of May, see #Pratchat54, “The Land Before Vimes”, our episode discussing Night Watch. As mentioned in our previous Eeek Club specials, the 25th of May is also Towel Day and Geek Pride Day.\n\nThis is our fourth Eeek Club special; the previous ones are Eeek Club 2021, Eeek Club 2022 and Eeek Club 2023.\n\n“Ramen hacks” are things you can add into your bowl of traditional Japanese noodle soup to make it even more delicious. (Not a lot of them are vegetarian, so Ben has given them a miss.) If you want to find some, you could look up the hashtag #ramenhacks on TikTok or Instagram, search YouTube, or do a web search, which will find a fair number of listicles.\n\nFind out all the details about the Australian Discworld Convention (12-14 July 2024 in Adelaide) at their website, ausdwcon.org.\n\n“Mad March” is the name given in Adelaide to the period of the year usually starting in late February and running through March when nearly all of their big cultural events occur: the Adelaide Fringe Festival (the second largest fringe arts festival in the world!), the Adelaide Festival, Womadelaide, the Clipsal 500 car race, and in some years even South Australia’s major horse race and a state election. It used to be not much else of note would happen there during the rest of the year, but as Liz mentions that’s no longer the case.\n\nMaid Marian and Her Merry Men was a sitcom pitched at kids created by Tony Robinson. It spoofed the Robin Hood myth by having Robin be a cowardly tailor mistaken for a rebel leader, when actually Marian is the brains behind the outfit. We’ve mentioned it before, though not for a long time – it was way back in #Pratchat7A, “The Curious Incident of the Dragon and the Night Watch”, and #Pratchat17, “Midsummer (Elf) Murders”. The episode Ben is thinking of here is “They Came From Outer Space” from the show’s third series in 1993. (Fun fact: Ben wrote the first – and for a long time only – website dedicated to the show way back in around 1994, and even corresponded with a couple of the writers and actors on the show. A lot of the information on modern Marian sites is plag- well, copied from his site, which no longer exists except in the Internet Archive.)\n\nThe “Keep your secrets, Gandalf” meme is from the scene where Frodo meets Gandalf as he arrives in the Shire at the start of The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nWe mention a few TV shows:\n\nThe Worst Witch was originally a series of children’s books written and illustrated by Jill Murphy, the first of which was published in 1974. It chronicles the adventures of Mildred Hubble, a student at Miss Cackle’s Academy for Young Witches; Mildred’s clumsiness gets her into all sorts of trouble and earns her the titular epithet. It’s actually been two different television series, one fairly low budget one in 1998 which was so popular it had two spin-offs, and a newer one in 2017. There was also a stage musical in 2018!\n\nDead Boy Detectives is on Netflix, and is based on characters created by Neil Gaiman for the Sandman comics, who later went on to star in more adventures in comics and appear briefly in the Doom Patrol television series before getting their own show. The titular dead boys are a pair of ghosts who solve supernatural crimes while hiding out from Death so they can stay together. The first season was released ion 25 April 2024.\n\nWednesday is also on Netflix. Created by Tim Burton, it’s a new version of The Addams Family focussed on Wednesday Addams, played by Jenna Ortega. After being expelled from a regular high school, Wednesday is sent to the much creepier Nevermore Academy. A second season is coming, probably in 2025.\n\nThe White Lotus is a black comedy anthology series on HBO. Each season takes place at a different hotel run by the fictional White Lotus chain. The third season is coming in 2025.\n\nThanks for reading our notes!

Each episode of the podcast covers a single episode, and includes an original song about the show; they have a whole album’s worth of new songs dedicated to the Buffy musical episode, “Once More, With Feeling”! (One of several things referenced in the title of #Pratchat49, “Once More, With Future“.)\n\nAs mentioned in the footnote, “Terry Pratchett in Conversation with Garth Nix” was a public appearance by Terry at the Sydney Opera House on 17 April, 2011. You can listen to to the whole thing via this MixCloud link.\n\nThe Colour of Magic, Pratchett’s fourth novel, was first published in the UK by Colin Smythe on November the 24th, 1983. As we noted for Richard Watts, our guest in #Pratchat49, who also read it when it was first available, In Australia this was probably in 1985, the year of the first Corgi paperback edition.\n\nPratchett’s first novel, The Carpet People, was first published by Colin Smythe on November 16th, 1971. This was a fairly small print run of 3,000 copies, which is why any that come up for sale routinely go for huge prices. (Garth did well to get a hold of one when it came out!) The later version – rewritten and edited by the older Pratchett – was first published by Corgi on the 30th of June, 1992. The original short stories from 1965 can be found in the collection The Dragons of Crumbling Castle, first published on the 11th of September 2014.\n\nThe Good Wife and The Good Fight are CBS legal dramas set in Chicago. The Good Wife follows Alicia Florrick (played by Julianna Margulies), a woman who restarts her legal career as a junior lawyer when her husband, a State’s Attorney, is jailed in a corruption scandal. A major theme of the show is what women are expected to give up to be “good wives” to influential husbands. The Good Wife ran for seven seasons from 2009 to 2016, and was followed in 2017 by The Good Fight, a sequel and spin-off that follows the character of Diane Lockhart (played by Christine Baranski). A year after the end of the earlier show, Lockhart – a named partner at Alicia’s law firm – is forced out when her life savings are lost in a financial scam that dupes her protege and god-daughter. The pair move to another Chicago law firm, where another former employee of the original firm now works, and take on a number of cases with political and social justice angles. The Good Fight is up to four seasons and still running.\n\nTiffany is 9 years old in The Wee Free Men – not 6, 7 or 8, as guessed by Garth and Ben. Everyone was wrong! In A Hat Full of Sky she is 11, and as discussed she turns 13 during Wintersmith.\n\nYou’ll find most of Liz’s complaints about Wentworth in #Pratchat32, “Meet the Feegles”, discussing the first Tiffany book The Wee Free Men. There might also be one or two in #Pratchat43, “Big Wee Hag: Far Fra’ Home“, about A Hat Full of Sky.\n\nThe “This is where you came in” thing is called by trope-listing websites “How We Got Here“. A famous example of Ben’s phrase for it is in Billy WIlder’s 1950 film noir mystery Sunset Boulevard.\n\nWe previously mentioned the film Mean Girls (2004, dir. Mark Waters) in #Pratchat37, “The Shopping Trolley Problem“. Written by Tina Fey and based on Rosalind Wiseman’s 2002 non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes, it follows new girl Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), who moves from an isolated life in Africa to the social jungle of of an American high school.\n\nBilbo Baggins’ age is a prominent point in The Lord of the Rings, when he chooses the occasion of his eleventy-first birthday to literally disappear by using the magic ring he stole from Gollum during the events of The Hobbit. It is noted that Bilbo has not aged normally for a hobbit, who usually live for around 100 years – a bit longer than the humans of Middle Earth.\n\nThe Pratchett interview in which he discusses Tolkien’s influence is his 2006 chat on Book Lust with Nancy Pearl, a production of the Seattle Channel, a community cable channel run by the City of Seattle. Appropriately enough it was during his promotional tour for Wintersmith! You can find the main Tolkien quote in his answer at around the 3:30 mark, which also includes his classic story about how and when he first read the books. An earlier – possibly the original – version of the same thought appears in Pratchett’s 1999 essay “Magic Kingdoms” for the Sunday Times, prompted by the publication of the third Harry Potter novel. It’s collected in A Slip of the Keyboard, and this version has been circulated in image form recently, so we include it here as text:\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien has become a sort of a mountain, appearing in all subsequent fantasy in the way Mt Fuji appears so often in Japanese prints. Sometimes it’s big and up close. Sometimes it’s a shape on the horizon. Sometimes it’s not there at all, which means the artist either has made a deliberate decision against the mountain, which is interesting in itself, or is in fact standing on Mt Fuji.\n\nTerry Pratchett, “Magic Kingdoms”, 1999\n\nPratchett’s other Tolkien references include a lot of stuff about dwarfs (and indeed the use of the plural “dwarfs”), the Gollum sequence in Witches Abroad, Mustrum Ridcully, aka “Ridcully the Brown” (a very different take on a Brown wizard who is close to nature), and his deliberately non-Tolkienistic takes on elves, orcs and goblins. In several interviews – including the one linked above – he also describes Discworld “in the short form” as “Middle Earth 500 years on, when everyone’s actually got to settle down and deal with one another.” (See #PratchatNA7, “A Troll New World“, for more on this idea.)\n\nLady Justice is the modern incarnation of Justitia, the Roman goddess of Justice, introduced by Emperor Augustus. Justitia herself is likely inspired by Dike, the Greek goddess of moral order and fair judgement, who also held a pair of scales, possibly influenced by earlier Egyptian gods like Maat and Isis. (Dike’s mother, Themis, is also described as a goddess of justice.) Justicia was also depicted holding a sword, but the blindfold worn by the modern version of Lady Justice seems to have been introduced in the sixteenth century. The earliest depiction of Lady Justice with all three elements seems to be the statue on the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (Fountain of Justice) in Bern, Switzerland, which was sculpted by Hans Gieng in 1543. Not all famous depictions of Lady Justice have the blindfold – for example the statue of her on the Old Bailey courthouse in London.\n\nAs Ben mentions, not everyone can or does visualise things in their imagination – in fact the ability to do so exists on a continuum, across all senses, not just sight. This kind of “blind” imagination is described as “aphantasia”, and around 3-5% of humans are estimated to think this way. This 2017 article from The Conversation does a pretty good job of explaining aphantasia, but there’s also a worldwide Aphantasia Network, established in 2020.\n\nNot only are personifications of fate often depicted as weavers – see previous episodes #Pratchat36, “Home Alone, But Vampires” and #Pratchat48, “Lu-Tze in the Sky with Lobsang” – but the moirai, the Greek fates, are the children of Themis, and sisters to Dike!\n\nTo be clear, we don’t hate any of the story teaching terms we groan about in this episode – Ben uses them in his teaching work a lot! – but they do take us back to school days we’re happy to have left behind us. In case you’re not familiar with any of them:\n\nThe “inciting incident” is modern writing jargon for the moment in a story where the protagonist’s regular world is disturbed. While it’s used by just about everyone who teaches Western-style writing (who often define it as having anywhere between three and seven defining characteristics), it can be fairly directly traced back to the work of story scholars like Gustav Freytag and Joseph Campbell.\n\nA “story graph” or “story arc” is a curved line meant to show time progressing in the story from left to right, and tension, excitement or some other measure of the story’s intensity going up and down. It demonstrates the same basic principles as Freytag’s Pyramid, which is to say the most tension or excitement etc goes somewhere in the middle, at least in standard Western story structures. In primary school creative writing it is sometimes called the “story mountain”.\n\nA “topic sentence” is a device taught in essay writing in which an early sentence in a paragraph – often the first one – gives the reader an expectation of what the paragraph will be about.\n\nThe Dark Morris is first mentioned – though not by name – at the very start of Reaper Man (see #Pratchat11, “At Bill’s Door“). Pratchett tells us that while all inhabited worlds of the multiverse have a Morris dance, only on the Discworld in one small village in the Ramtops is it danced it properly. Their secret is “the other dance”, which is described in more detail at the end of the book: that dance it’s danced without music, while dressed in black and wearing bells made of octiron, which make “the opposite of noise”. The award-winning Lancre Morris Men, led by Jason Ogg, appear in Lords and Ladies, but they don’t seem to be the ones who dance the Dark Morris; they mention that the Morris is “for every day”, whereas the dancers of the Dark Morris do the regular and correct Morris dance only once a year. This also correlates with the fact that Miss Treason’s steading is not in Lancre – which is well served by both Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax – just somewhere nearby.\n\nIn Joe Dante’s 1984 horror comedy Gremlins, teenager Billy Peltzer (Zach Gallagher) is given a mysterious Christmas present bought by his travelling salesman/inventor father from a weird little shop (you know the sort). It’s a strange, intelligent and very cute creature called a mogwai (the name is derived from the Cantonese word for devil, 魔怪), and it comes with three rules: keep it away from bright light, especially sunlight, which will kill it; do not let it come into contact with water; and – most famously – “never, no matter how much he pleads, no matter how much he begs, never ever feed him after midnight”. By the end of the film, of course, all three rules are broken. We previously discussed the film’s 1990 sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch, in #Pratchat34, “Only You Can Sav"
