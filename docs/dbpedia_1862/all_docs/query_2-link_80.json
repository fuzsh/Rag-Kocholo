        "text": "Get to Know Us\n\nThe team at Samaritans cares deeply about our mission to prevent suicide and provide hope. Some of us are connected to Samaritans because of our own losses to suicide. For others, it was our own mental health struggles which led us here. For some, it is a calling to help others who are in pain. Our staff, Board, and Council take great pride in being part of an organization that does such impactful work in the community.\n\nSamaritans Council\n\nThe Samaritans Council affords members an opportunity to engage more deeply with a mission important to them, contribute to widening the circle of supporters, establish an official relationship from which they can act as brand ambassadors, and engage with others who are similarly committed to the organization and its success. For Samaritans, the benefits include the opportunity to engage meaningfully with members of our community who value our work, increased visibility and financial support, and the ability to call on members for their personal or professional expertise or feedback.\n\nStewart Chapin\n\nCo-Chair, Bennett Family Foundation\n\nLindsay J.
