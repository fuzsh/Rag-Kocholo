        "text": "BC High Graduates Attending Top-Tier Colleges and Universities Worldwide\n\nBoston, MA: On Saturday, May 18, more than 2,000 members of the Boston College High School community gathered on McCoy Field to celebrate and honor the 249 graduates of the Class of 2024. Despite cloudy skies, the achievements and resiliency of the graduating class shone brightly.\n\nThe program included a student welcome address from Medford resident Ridge Noelsaint (Boston College) and a senior address from Marshfield native Daniel Moylan (Brown University). Both graduates spoke to the inclusive, welcoming, and supportive community of their fellow classmates, teachers, and administrators.\n\nIn her remarks, President Grace Cotter Regan P’12 challenged students to build upon their shared Ignatian values learned on Morrissey Boulevard to change the world, serve those on the margins, and act justly in a society that needs good people.\n\n“For a large portion of their lives, this campus has been the home of the Class of 2024, and this community, their family,” said President Regan. “I pray that they always know these connections do not end today. The unbreakable bonds of brotherhood with your classmates, and bonds of love and respect you share with everyone gathered here, will truly last your lifetime.”\n\nPresident Regan also recognized the Class of 1974, who as part of a time-honored tradition commemorating their 50th reunion, returned to BC High as Golden Jubilarians, the evening before.\n\nThe Honorable Jane Swift, former Massachusetts governor and current president of Education at Work, a work-based nonprofit serving institutions of higher education, then delivered the keynote address.\n\nIn her speech, Governor Swift urged graduates to embrace the unseen future. “Whatever happens,” she said, “make sure you take on life with hope and joy. If you live your life aligned with the mission of Boston College High School, finding hope and a future filled with purpose and passion seems assured: be a leader of competence, conscience, and compassion and seek to do all things for the greater glory of God.”\n\nThe accomplishments of the Class of 2024 are many, with more than 43 percent of graduating seniors being inducted into the National Honor Society. In addition, 11 Eagles earned recognition as National Merit Scholarship recipients and qualified for university scholarships. A testament to the global path of BC High, 37 young men graduated with the distinction of being a Hyde Scholar, signifying participation in international travel, commitment to a second language, and expanding concrete knowledge on global issues.\n\nThroughout an extraordinary high school experience, which began in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Class of 2024 remained dedicated in the classroom, athletics, and extracurricular activities. BC High’s Class of 2024 received acceptances to more than 250 colleges and universities in 41 states and 6 countries, including all eight Ivy League universities, as well as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, and Stanford University.\n\nIn addition, BC High students saw an above-average acceptance rates at Catholic institutions of higher education, including Boston College (21% above the national average), College of the Holy Cross (26% above the national average), Georgetown University (43% above the national average), and University of Notre Dame (33% above the national average). Other college acceptances included Colby College, Howard University, Miami University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Savannah College of Art and Design, Tulane University, Trinity College Dublin, and University of California Los Angeles.\n\nSaturday’s ceremony was the culmination of celebrations for the Class of 2024, which included a senior awards ceremony with student remarks from Colby Soutter of Charlestown (Dartmouth College) and a graduation mass, highlighted by student speaker Jack Reardon of Milton (Harvard University).\n\nBuilding on several years of remarkable growth and rapid expansions in innovation, BC High is eager to welcome the Class of 2028 to Morrissey Boulevard in the fall.
