        "text": "Our Most Momentous\n\nRelease In Years!\n\nFor Loren Schoenberg of the Jazz Museum of Harlem, it’s the discovery that capped nearly forty years of searching. For us at Mosaic, it’s the “find” that has us re-examining an era we thought we knew inside out.\n\nAnd now, for listeners, it’s an historic and fleeting opportunity to own a treasure trove of previously unknown music.\n\nMosaic Records presents “The Savory Collection” – six CDs with 108 tracks locked away for more than 70 years and finally available on CD for the very first time anywhere. The recordings are from the personal collection of Bill Savory, a quirky and secretive studio engineer in New York whose day job in the late 1930s and early 1940s was transcribing radio broadcasts for foreign distribution, and whose nighttime passion was turning on the disc recorders to pull in and preserve what was happening in the clubs of New York City and other cities.\n\nHidden Away. Until Now!\n\nIt was an era when TV didn’t exist yet, live music was everywhere, and radio stations would serve it to their audiences – in what everyone thought were once-in-a-lifetime experiences. But no one counted on a guy like Bill Savory being on the other end of a radio signal.\n\nSavory had always been cagey and unresponsive when asked about his collection. There were rumors it contained jewels. We’re here to report – it does:\n\n• Thirteen tracks from the original, under-rated John Kirby sextet featuring some of the finest soloists of the day: Buster Bailey, Charlie Shavers, Russell Procope, Billy Kyle and O’Neill Spencer.\n\n• Chick Webb, Ella Fitzgerald and Roy Eldridge as guest stars on the CBS radio hit of the day “The Saturday Night Swing Club”.\n\n• Broadcasts from the legendary Café Society, Famous Door, Panther Room, Onyx Club and regularly scheduled radio programs with a cream of jazz stars.\n\n• Joe Sullivan improvising at the piano – solo — during a private party. A chance for him to loosen up, stretch out, and experiment.\n\n• And an unknown version of “Body and Soul” by Coleman Hawkins, recorded live just seven months after his earth-shattering recording in 1939 that most listeners believe laid down an entirely new point of view about jazz soloing. As important as that original recording was, this newly-found version might be EVEN BETTER.\n\n• A wealth of classic Count Basie live when Lester Young, Herschel Evans and were with that classic, trendsetting orchestra making jazz and big band history.\n\nThe Sound of a City\n\nMost recordings in the collection were from dates in New York, the center of the world in jazz in that era. Other recordings in this collection were from clubs in Boston, Asbury Park, and Chicago, or from the radio studios of WNEW, CBS and NBC.\n\nSwing was still a significant factor, but the earliest strains and seeds of bebop were being planted. Everything was happening at once. At clubs such as Café Society, the Savoy Ballroom, and the Onyx Club. Or at a place called the Fiesta Danceteria on 42nd street, “the world’s first self-service nightclub,” where Hawkins topped his own recording of “Body and Soul” in a performance that was never meant to be immortalized. It was just a night like any other night, and there was magic every night.\n\nImagine Count Basie at the Famous Door with Lester Young, just three years after Lester’s recording debut. He was first heard on songs such as “Boogie Woogie” and “Lady Be Good” with Basie, and here he was performing them live. And alongside him was Herschel Evans, whose talent can now be reassessed.\n\nOr, revel in the showmanship and exuberance of Fats Waller from a place called The Yacht Club, where the fun and frivolity of a casual club date takes you deep in the world of these men and women who did this night after night.\n\nYou couldn’t see it at home – or Savory from his recording studio — but you can imagine the spotlight hitting the microphone and Ella Fitzgerald or Mildred Bailey stepping into the light to hold a room – and a radio audience – in their hands.\n\nThe Sound of an Era\n\nThose artists are all here on the Savory collection, along with Teddy Wilson, Albert Ammons, Benny Carter, Bobby Hackett, Chick Webb … the list goes on and on.\n\nSavory’s achievement in recording and preserving this material can’t be overstated. You could be at home around your radio, but you didn’t have the equipment in the studio where Savory tinkered and invented. The glory of these broadcasts in many cases heard here is that he was capturing live music without the limitation of a 3 or 4 minute 78 rpm recording. If the club version of a song went for six minutes, no matter. Savory got every note of it.\n\nLoren & Scott’s Excellent Adventure\n\nLoren Schoenberg, National Jazz Museum of Harlem\n\nI met Bill Savory in 1980, just after I started working for Benny Goodman. He appeared one day, and was bemused to answer questions about the great series of 1930s Goodman radio performances that had been culled from his collection, and issued on Columbia and MGM Records. When asked how he had picked the best of what he had recorded, he answered simply, “I didn’t. I just picked what was best in the first box.”\n\nBill gave me his phone number that day, and we began a series of conversations that lasted until the time of his final illness in 2004.\n\nCollectors shared my concern about the ultimate disposition of the discs – what would happen if there was a fire, a flood, or if Bill somehow lost possession or interest in them? Goodman discographer D. Russ Connor had been in touch with Bill over the years, had received a listing of what was there, and received a copy of a few of the performances. There had also been a release of some 1936 Goodman broadcasts from Chicago.\n\nBut the great bulk of the collection remained buried. After Bill’s death, hope was nearly gone that anything would ever appear from this fabled treasure trove. At a 2010 record collectors convention, someone approached me, and that was when serendipity arrived in the person of collector Sonny McGown. He overheard a conversation and said that had known Bill and was still in touch with his son, Gene.\n\nSonny’s introduction did the magic, and before long, a series of phone calls with Gene revealed that he had sent his daughter the discs. They were about to be consigned to the garbage dump by the people hired to dispose of Bill’s estate. Within weeks I made the trip to Malta, Illinois to visit Gene and found 50 boxes a-moldering in his living room.\n\nAs soon as I got into my rented car, I called the best man in the world for the job of restoring ancient discs, Doug Pomeroy. He tried to put me off even before I got to the meat of the matter. Having just retired, he’d be happy to recommend someone to take on whatever project this was. It was then that I mentioned the name Bill Savory, and the very next morning I was in his Brooklyn studio as he mounted the Basie aluminum disc on his turntable. A few spins in and Lester Young was in the house.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nScott Wenzel – Mosaic Records\n\n“What does the name Bill Savory mean to you?” Lauren asked. I can’t recall exactly what my response was but I did recognize him as the sound engineer whose name had become intertwined with those electrifying Benny Goodman radio broadcasts that surfaced on Columbia Masterworks in the early 1950s.\n\nLoren had been on a quest for years to obtain the record collection of Bill Savory which was this mythical mouthwatering collection of “off the air” broadcasts that were lovingly recorded by Savory back in the 1930s and 1940s. A deal had been made with Bill’s son Gene to acquire the collection for the National Jazz Museum In Harlem where Loren is the senior scholar and archivist.\n\nLoren explained that “…it’s a large haul – I’m flying out to Chicago to inventory and pack them up. Then we’ll rent a moving van and drive back with the goods. But I need someone who knows how to handle vintage recordings properly and box them up for the trip back to New York. Whaddya think?” “I’m in!” And off we went.\n\nWhat I saw was a collector’s dream.\n\nRecords, reel to reels, memorabilia and assorted ephemera were strewn all over the living room. But the real prizes were the hidden joys inside boxes upon boxes of water stained and moldy wooden crates with chalk numbers and other information written on them.\n\nA sofa, table and some chairs were ready for us and along with the sounds of trains passing through the back yard of this rural home, we began the mining and itemizing of these precious artifacts. Each day for about a week we would make the drive to Gene’s home, coffee in hand, and start the “task” of opening a crate – each one with treasures that would finally see daylight after decades of being cooped up in these coffins.\n\nSome of the discs were aluminum while others were lacquer coated aluminum and were in various stages of decay. We would open up a box and would gingerly extract disc after disc. I then read to Loren what was written on the sleeve or what was written on the label. Some information had been etched on the disc itself.\n\nThere were times when the smell of the mold was so unbearable we had to wear respirator masks for fear of inhaling some unknown fungus that had festered upon these grooves for decades and hours when we had to take a break and step outside to catch our breath.\n\nAnd then it seemed to all go so quickly…the week had passed and we were gingerly boxing up the discs in protective bubble wrap and walking them out to our rented U-Haul for the ride back. Once back in New York we took the discs to a storage facility where they would reside until the next chapter; audio engineer Doug Pomeroy’s magic of cleaning, transferring and restoring them for posterity.\n\nThe Savory Collection 1935-1940 (6 CDs)\n\nDiscography\n\nDISC I\n\nCOLEMAN HAWKINS\n\nBody And Soul (X) (5:51)\n\n(Heyman-Sour-Eyton-Green) Harms, Inc.\n\nBasin Street Blues (X) (5:50)\n\n(Spencer Williams)\n\nLazy Butterfly (X) (1:03)\n\n(Coleman Hawkins)\n\nELLA FITZGERALD\n\nA-Tiskit, A-Tasket (II) (2:22)\n\n(E.

Without his attention, his father’s collection would have disappeared. Without his generosity, the music would never have been shared with the world.\n\nThe National Jazz Museum in Harlem is a proud affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. Our mission is to preserve, promote, and present jazz by inspiring knowledge, appreciation, and the celebration of jazz locally, nationally and internationally.

However, the following discs presented problems that could not be eliminated in either the transfer or restoring process: The following is a list of some of the more problematic tracks:\n\nJohn Kirby – Minnie The Moocher’s Wedding Day – static throughout\n\nMildred Bailey / Stuff Smith – The entire “Swingtime At NBC” program was of particularly poor quality.\n\nStuff Smith – The Randall’s Island broadcast includes “Bleeding” from neighboring radio frequencies throughout.\n\nGlenn Miller – In The Mood – high frequency signal noises persist.\n\nScott Wenzel"
