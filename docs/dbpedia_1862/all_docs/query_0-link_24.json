        "text": "Larry Bly and Larry Dowdy in studio for “Two Larry’s and a Mic” podcast. Photo courtesy of Heather Rousseau/The Roanoke Times.\n\nWhen DJs retire from radio broadcasting, where do they go? For Roanoke, Virginia DJs Larry Bly and Larry Dowdy, they have started recording a bi-monthly podcast called Two Larry’s and a Mic.\n\nThen on alternating weeks, Dowdy produces a separate solo podcast called Larry Dowdy Mic Side.\n\nOver the course of the past 50 years, DJs Dowdy and Bly have been an important part of the Roanoke/Lynchburg radio market. With a wealth of radio broadcasting experiences, each new podcast installment creates unique perspectives by this duo.\n\nI spoke with DJs Bly and Dowdy via phone on April 29, just before they recorded episode 18 of Two Larry’s and a Mic. Their latest podcast features songs that were popular 50 years ago during 1971, along with interesting information about the golden age of Top 40 radio.\n\nThe idea for podcasting came from Dowdy, as he retired from radio last summer after hosting WLNI Lynchburg’s Morning Line show for the past five years. You can listen to the final words that Dowdy spoke before retirement on the clip below, along with some conversation with WLNI Morning Line co-host Kenny Shelton.\n\nJust after his farewell at WLNI, Dowdy contacted his former mentor Larry Bly about the possibility of recording a podcast together. The guys quickly formed a plan and the Two Larry’s and a Mic podcast became a reality.\n\nIn addition, Larry Dowdy’s Mic Side podcast was also started during the same time period. Debut of Mic Side occurred August 20 while Two Larry’s and a Mic maiden voyage happened August 25. Here is the link that came out on May 19, 2022, where I am the featured guest on a Mic Side episode.\n\nOn November 3, 2022, Larry Dowdy had me on as a guest for episode 61 of his Mic Side podcast. The audio link for that episode is below.\n\nMy connection with both guys named Larry was with WROV 1240 AM Roanoke when we were all employed at the station during the mid 70s.\n\nI started my first job in radio at age 18, working for WROV during April 1974. I was a student at Virginia Western Community College, obtaining an Associate Degree in Radio & TV Broadcasting.\n\nAt WROV, I was hired to be a remote engineer by the Top 40 radio station. My responsibilities at the station included setting up equipment for remote broadcasts, running the soundboard and playing records, while a WROV DJ was in charge of announcing duties.\n\nHere I am at my first radio job. Sound engineer for WROV Roanoke during 1974.\n\nDuring my first engineering remote assignment with WROV, I was fortunate to be paired up with Larry Bly. The morning drive DJ spoke words of encouragement, and made me feel comfortable during my first day working at the station.\n\nIt was also with WROV remote broadcasts where I first met Larry Dowdy, who was a part time employee like myself. While I was preforming engineering duties for WROV remote broadcasts, Dowdy would run the main studio board back at the radio station.\n\nLarry Bly and Wolfman Jack at the WROV Roanoke studio in April 1975.

However, both guys share similarities with their celebrated broadcasting experiences. Both guys named Larry:\n\nWorked at one major market top 40 station outside of Virginia\n\nWere on TV during 80s and/or 90s\n\nStarted radio careers at a young age\n\nLarry Bly’s radio career flourished as a young man when he was an announcer for the Armed Forces Network in South Korea. Once Bly left the military, he took a radio job with WHBG Harrisonburg, which was located in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.\n\nWROV Roanoke DJ Larry Bly and Music Director David Levine. Photo courtesy of the WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nNext in Bly’s radio career was a gig at WWWW (W4) FM Detroit, Michigan. Although W4 was a major market top 40 outlet, Bly wanted to get a job closer to his native home state of Virginia. With the help of his friend Dan Alexander, Bly was hired to work at WROV Roanoke during 1971.\n\nWhen Bly moved to Roanoke, he didn’t realize it would become his permanent home. After settling in at Top 40 WROV, Bly spent 3 years full time at the station, starting on the 7 pm to midnight shift and ending up doing the morning show for a couple of years.\n\nDuring 1974, Bly became a part time employee at WROV as he started working full time for an advertising agency called System 4. A business he co-owned with Marty Hall, who was a former WROV DJ himself during the 60s.\n\nEven though Bly became a weekend employee for WROV, he continuously worked at the station for 37 years and ended his employment there in 1998. According to the WROV History website: “The last live announcer on WROV-AM was Larry Bly, who ended its final show by playing Don McLean’s hit “American Pie” (with lyrics “the day the music died”).”\n\nThe other major activity that Bly was involved in during the 80s and 90s was a TV program called Cookin’ Cheap. Hosted by Laban Johnson and Bly for Blue Ridge Public Television in Roanoke, the program became a nationally syndicated cooking show.\n\nLarry Dowdy’s radio career began in 1973 while he was still in high school at combo WRIS AM/WJLM FM Roanoke. Dowdy moved across town the following year for another part time radio position with WROV.\n\nAfter high school, Dowdy worked at Beautiful Music station WLRG Roanoke 92.3 FM. At Midnight January 1st, 1980, WLRG switched call letters and music format, becoming Top 40 K92 (WXLK). Listen to the Music” by the Doobie Brothers was the first song played at K92.\n\nAt K92, Dowdy was part of a phenomenal Top 40 outlet which became the number 1 most listened to radio station in the Roanoke/Lynchburg market for next 15 years. Dowdy spent 3 different times employed at K92: 1980-1983, 1984-1992 and 1997-1999.\n\nIn 1983, Dowdy left K92 to land at job at Hot Hits WMAR Baltimore, working the midnight shift for his entire employment at that station. After a year working the overnight hours in Maryland, Dowdy came back to his Roanoke roots and once again played Top 40 hits on K92.\n\nPhoto of K92 Roanoke “K Crew” morning drive staff: Larry Dowdy, Mike Stevens & Bill Jordan. Dowdy provided his photo for this blog.\n\nTV was next up for Dowdy, as he transferred his radio skills to a new platform: Early morning television. He spent 5 years with WDBJ7 as host for the station’s Mornin’ Program (1992-1997).\n\nAt the end of his employment with WDBJ7, Dowdy jumped back over to radio broadcasting and held down morning drive DJ positions with 4 stations from 1997 until 2015. The first two stations Dowdy worked for after completing TV duties, were Mel Wheeler Media owned K92 and Star Country (94.9 FM) Roanoke.\n\nMorning radio DJ jobs continued for Dowdy in the 2000s as he moved across town and worked for a couple of stations owned by Clear Channel Communications (Now known as iHeartCommunications). First up was Magic FM (104.9 FM) which featured adult contemporary music.\n\nThe longest time that Dowdy spent with one station happened with Sunny FM (93.5), where he spent 14 years as the morning show host. Dowdy stayed at the classic hits formatted station until January 2015.\n\nAfter Dowdy’s departure from Sunny FM, he hooked up with WLNI FM (105.9) Lynchburg. The final radio destination for Dowdy was different for the radio broadcaster: He was host for a news/talk program called Morning Line. Dowdy completed 5 years at WLNI and his radio career was completed at the end of July 2020.\n\nK92 Roanoke DJs Tripper and Larry Dowdy inside the K92 studio. Dowdy provided his photo for this blog.\n\nIn my communications with Larry Dowdy, I asked him to give me a brief description about the topic content of the two podcasts that he is producing. Below are his quotes:\n\nTwo Larry’s and a Mic: Features Larry Bly and Larry Dowdy discussing what made radio fun to listen to and the incredible music that made it memorable.\n\nLarry Dowdy Mic Side: Is a one-on-one interview with movers and shakers in the Roanoke area and other guests of interest from around the country to podcast listeners.\n\nK92 Roanoke DJ Staff on the cover of Roanoker Magazine. From Left: Bill Jordan, David Lee Michaels, John Berry, Larry Dowdy, Vince Miller and Russ Brown. Photo courtesy of the WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nDowdy also gave me a breakdown on the number of total installments that are now available to download with his two podcasts:\n\nTwo Larry’s and a Mic: 18\n\nLarry Dowdy Mic Side: 22\n\nThe aspect that I like most about both podcasts: A person doesn’t need to be a radio geek to enjoy listening to the duo on “Two Larry’s” or to appreciate Dowdy’s warm and inviting interviewing skills on “Mic Side.”\n\nWith any “Two Larry’s and a Mic” podcast, the fellows talk on a featured music topic, that is chock-full of information and is fun-filled with laughter between the duo. On any given segment, one may hear radio airchecks, snippets of Top 40 hits, in-depth musical history and radio tales by “Uncle Lar” Bly.\n\nSome of the wonderful subjects that Two Larry’s and a Mic have tackled since last August include:\n\nOne Hit Wonders\n\nGreat Duets\n\nBritish Invasion\n\nElvis Presley\n\nCanadian Invasion Music\n\nPowerful Instrumentals on Top 40 Radio\n\n70s Music\n\nLove Songs\n\nOn “Larry Dowdy Mic Side” podcasts, a single person is interviewed by the host. The subject matter is wide open and much more than just discussions of radio or music topics. I appreciate the variety of guests that Dowdy interviews on his solo podcast.\n\nInterviews that I have most enjoyed on Larry Dowdy Mic Side:\n\nDavid Lee Michaels\n\nNelson Harris\n\nBill Jordan\n\nDr. Bob Denton\n\nSammy Oakey\n\nBrent Watts\n\nTommy Holcomb\n\nKenny Shelton\n\nLarry Bly and Larry Dowdy in studio for “Two Larry’s and a Mic” podcast. Photo courtesy of Heather Rousseau/The Roanoke Times.\n\nFor anyone wanting new listening experiences with podcasting, I highly recommend adding both “Larry Dowdy Mic Side” and “Two Larry’s and a Mic” to your playlist. Here are the main links for these superbly produced podcasts:\n\nI fondly remember the golden days of top 40 radio and I am glad that DJs Larry Bly and Larry Dowdy are bringing back musical memories from many years ago. It is also heartening to know about Dowdy’s labor of love producing two excellent podcasts for the world to enjoy.\n\nIf you are searching for new podcasting suggestions, I strongly advocate adding “Larry Dowdy Mic Side” and “Two Larry’s and a Mic” to your regular listening playlist. The retired DJs from Roanoke will not disappoint.

Following in those footsteps, is the recent success of the “1971: Superb One Hit Wonders” message that is soaring in popularity.\n\nNow I am going for the troika: 1969 one hit wonders.\n\nFrom my music collection of 45 rpm singles: “Good Old Rock ‘N Roll” by Cat Mother & the All Night News Boys and “You, I” by the Rugbys.\n\nWith this edition of my musical musings, I am concentrating on the best “one hit wonders” of 1969. I will be counting down the top songs in this category from 52 years ago.\n\nI have fond memories listening to Top 40 radio during 1969. I turned 14 that year living in Roanoke, Virginia. During daytime hours, I was a regular listener to a couple of local AM radio stations: WROV and WBLU.\n\nLegendary Top 40 WROV 1240 AM was the top-rated radio station in Roanoke. The DJs that I remember from the station during 1969 include Jack Fisher, Fred Frelantz, Bart Prater and John Cigna.\n\nWROV Roanoke Super Summer Survey 8/24/69. Courtesy of the WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nWBLU 1480 AM Salem was the other Top 40 outlet in the Roanoke radio market. WBLU DJ’s 52 years ago were Chris Shannon, Les Turpin and Bill Cassidy, while Dave Moran was the general manager of the station.\n\nAt sundown, WROV reduced their power and WBLU signed off the air, so I tuned in radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home. Since radio waves changed on a nightly basis, I would listen to a variety of 50,000-watt, clear channel AM stations on any given night.\n\nThe two main stations that I listened to during the nighttime were WLS 890 AM Chicago and WABC 770 AM New York. On the Big 89 WLS, Larry Lujack, Chuck Buell and Kris Erik Stevens were my favorite DJs. When listening to WABC, Dan Ingram and Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow) are the two radio DJ voices that I remember.\n\nWLS Chicago Hit Parade Surveys 7/14/69 (“In the Year 2525” is #1) & 12/1/69 (“Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye is #1). Courtesy of Pete Battistini: Author of AMERICAN TOP 40 WITH CASEY KASEM (THE 1970’S).\n\nOn nights that WLS or WABC were hard to pick up, I had other clear channel stations that I listened to after dark. Among those other stations: WOWO Fort Wayne, WCFL Chicago 1000 AM, CKLW Windsor, Ontario (Detroit) 800 AM, WKBW Buffalo 1520 AM and WKYC Cleveland 1100 AM.\n\nBecause of my love of listening to Top 40 radio during 1969, I set a goal that year of wanting to work as a DJ when I reached adulthood. My desire to work in radio became a reality for me at age 18, when I landed a remote engineer position with WROV Roanoke during 1974.\n\nFrom my music collection of 45 rpm singles: “In the Year 2525” by Zager & Evans and “Israelites” by Desmond Dekker & the Aces.\n\nWhat exactly is a “One Hit Wonder?” The basic definition: An artist has only one hit song during their career on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. This music blog message pertains solely to hit songs within the United States.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, here are the criteria that I am using to define a “one hit wonder”:\n\nNo other songs from an artist ever peaking at number 40 or higher on the Billboard National Pop Chart. (Chart positions from number 40 to number 1).\n\nOne hit wonders vary from country to country. An artist may have just one hit in the United States but may have multiple hits in another country.\n\nRegional hits are not taken into account: A second song must be a national hit and chart within the Billboard Top 40 pop survey.\n\nAny songs peaking outside of the Top 40, are always excluded for consideration.\n\nSongs that peak from numbers 41 through 100 on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart are never considered as second hits.\n\nFrom my music collection of 45 rpm singles: “Worst That Could Happen” by Brooklyn Bridge and “Smile a Little Smile For Me” by The Flying Machine.\n\nWROV Roanoke Survey June 29, 1969. Courtesy of the WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nThe rule that a second song must be a Top 40 Billboard National pop chart hit was established in 1998, by music historian Wayne Jancik in his definitive work on the subject, “The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders.”\n\nThe subject of “one hit wonders” has always been interesting to me: Leading me to research the reasons why some artists have only one hit song. Way before the advent of the Internet, my go to reference for this subject has been “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn. I consider Whitburn’s book to be the “bible” of Top 40 music reference and still proudly own a hard copy of this excellent book.\n\nBefore I start my “one hit wonder” countdown, I am listing the 15 biggest songs of 1969 according to Billboard Magazine. NONE OF THE FIFTEEN SONGS LISTED BELOW ARE ONE HIT WONDERS.\n\n1 “Sugar, Sugar” The Archies\n\n2 “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” The 5th Dimension\n\n3 “I Can’t Get Next to You” The Temptations\n\n4 “Honky Tonk Women” The Rolling Stones\n\n5 “Everyday People” Sly and the Family Stone\n\n6 “Dizzy” Tommy Roe\n\n7 “Hot Fun in the Summertime” Sly and the Family Stone\n\n8 “I’ll Never Fall in Love Again” Tom Jones\n\n9 “Build Me Up Buttercup” The Foundations\n\n10 “Crimson and Clover” Tommy James and the Shondells\n\n11 “One” Three Dog Night\n\n12 “Crystal Blue Persuasion” Tommy James and the Shondells\n\n13 “Hair” The Cowsills\n\n14 “Too Busy Thinking About My Baby” Marvin Gaye\n\n15 “Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet” Henry Mancini\n\nFrom my music collection of 45 rpm singles: “More Today Than Yesterday” by Spiral Starecase and “My Pledge of Love” by the Joe Jeffrey Group.\n\nAs I surveyed all the top 40 hits from 1969, I found 25 high quality singles that are on my countdown of one hit wonders for that year. These are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nI submit to you, my top 25 best one hit wonder songs from 1969. As Casey Kasem used to say on his weekly American Top 40 show: “Now on with the countdown.”\n\nFrom my music collection of 45 rpm singles: “When I Die” by Motherlode & “Jesus is a Soul Man” by Lawrence Reynolds.

This toe-tapping tune is my second favorite 1969 one hit wonder.\n\nNa Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye—Steam\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Chart: #1 Hot 100\n\n“Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” was written by Paul Leka, Gary DeCarlo and Dale Frashuer in the early 60s. In 1968, DeCarlo recorded 4 singles for Mercury Records as a solo artist. One of those singles needed a B-side so DeCarlo brought Leka and Frashuer into the studio to record “Kiss Him Goodbye.”\n\nThe trio didn’t have a group name for their newly recorded song, so they came up with the fictitious band they named “Steam.” “Kiss Him Goodbye” spent two weeks at number 1 during December 1969 and was still a top ten record on the Billboard Hot 100 during January 1970.\n\nMy 45 rpm single of “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” that I bought in 1969 and still own in 2021.\n\nThe popularity of “Na Na Hey Hey” has remained strong since the song was first a hit. The song is regularly heard at many professional, college and high school sporting events during the 21st Century. There is an excellent chance to hear (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye) at just about any type of sporting contest conducted in 2021.\n\nWithout a doubt, “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” is the best one hit wonder of 1969.\n\nNow that I have humbly submitted my thoughts on “one hit wonders” of 1969, I am curious to find out your opinion on the music from that year.\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique of the “one hit wonder” songs from 1969. The songs that you might feel are the best, maybe be completely different from my selections.\n\nFrom my music collection of 45 rpm singles: “Get Together” by the Youngbloods & “Love (Can Make You Happy)” by Mercy.\n\nI am asking for your opinion: What do you consider to be the best “one hit wonders” of 52 years ago? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart. I cherish and fondly remember my favorite “one hit wonders” of 1969.

If I asked 100 random people that question, I would come up with one hundred different responses. Obviously, there are no definitive answers with that type of inquiry.\n\nMy latest music blog message came after I read an article from USA Today online on 2/9/21, called “Motown hits: The 50 best and essential songs. This piece was a reprint of a story from the Detroit Free Press by Brian McCollum.\n\nIn 2016, pop music critic Brian McCollum of the Detroit Free Press, published a Top 10 listing of Motown best songs from Motown’s Detroit era (1959-1972), as selected by the newspaper and its readers to commemorate the label’s 55th anniversary.\n\n1. “What’s Going On,” Marvin Gaye\n\n2. “Dancing in the Street,” Martha and the Vandellas\n\n3. “My Girl,” the Temptations\n\n4. “The Tracks of My Tears,” the Miracles\n\n5. “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell\n\n6. “Stop! In the Name of Love,” the Supremes\n\n7. “Signed Sealed Delivered I’m Yours,” Stevie Wonder\n\n8. “I Heard it Through the Grapevine,” Marvin Gaye\n\n9. “I Heard it Through the Grapevine,” Gladys Knight & the Pips\n\n10. “War,” Edwin Starr\n\nFrom my music collection: 45 rpm single of “The Tears of a Crown” by Smokey Robinson & the Miracles.\n\nAnother Top 10 listing of greatest Motown songs of all-time is from Digital Dream Door Dot COM below:\n\nI Heard It Through the Grapevine–Marvin Gaye\n\n2. My Girl–The Temptations\n\n3. Reach Out I’ll Be There–The Four Tops\n\n4. Where Did Our Love Go?–The Supremes\n\n5. What’s Going On–Marvin Gaye\n\n6. Dancing in the Street–Martha & the Vandellas\n\n7. I Want You Back–Jackson 5\n\n8. Superstition–Stevie Wonder\n\n9. Please Mr. Postman–Marvelettes\n\n10. My Guy–Mary Wells\n\nWhile there isn’t anything wrong with either of the above lists, I prefer that a Top 10 best Motown songs of all-time listing be more inclusive, listing ten different artists, instead of being dominated by a single artist such as Marvin Gaye.\n\nWhat do I consider to be the best Motown songs from the early days? You probably have guessed already that I have come up with my own listing of greatest Motown singles.\n\nI will be counting down my top 20 top Motown artists and songs. Before I share my selections, I want to give a brief history of Motown Records from the Detroit years (1959-1972).\n\nBarry Gordy Jr. founded the company during 1959 which was known then as Tamla Records. The name Motown was incorporated the next year in 1960, and was a tribute to Detroit, which was known as “Motor City” due to it being the auto manufacturing capital of America.\n\nMotown helped to define “Soul Music” during the early 60s, with Black artists crossing over to audiences on Top 40 radio. From 1961 to 1971, Motown had 110 top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nSongs of note during the first years of Motown: The Miracles “Shop Around” was the first crossover hit for Tamla Records during 1960 and reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. A year later, Motown had its first number 1 record on the Billboard chart with “Please Mr. Postman” by the Marvelettes.\n\nIn addition to the Tamla name, there were a number of other sub record labels that were distributed under the Motown banner. Gordy, Soul, Rare Earth and V.I.P. were other prominent sub recording labels associated with Motown music during the Detroit years.\n\nThe showcasing of vocal talent for Motown songs was enhanced by a group of session musicians based out of Detroit: The Funk Brothers. These instrumentalists are credited with playing on a majority of Motown hit songs between 1959 and 1972. The excellent musicianship of the Funk Brothers helped to create “Motown Magic.”\n\nFor this music blog message, I will countdown what I consider to be the best 20 Motown songs by 20 different artists. Here are the rules and criteria that I set forth for this musical exercise:\n\nI have selected 20 different songs by 20 artists.\n\nOf the 20 artists, only Marvin Gaye has two songs. (first a duet with female singer and the second a solo song).\n\nOnly Motown artists are listed. That means superb soul artists like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke are not included on my countdown.\n\nI deem each of my selections to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nAll 20 songs are among my favorites from the time period of 1961-1971.\n\nMy reference for chart performances of the 20 songs on the countdown comes from “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn. Way before the advent of the Internet, Whitburn’s book has been my main reference guide and I consider it to be the “bible” for Top 40 music information. I still proudly still own a hard copy of this excellent book here in 2021.\n\nAnd as Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 weekly broadcasts, on with the countdown:\n\n20. Please Mr. Postman—The Marvelettes 1961\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, #1 R&B.\n\nFirst crossover number 1 song for Motown. On Billboard Hot 100: December 1961.\n\nMarvin Gaye played drums on tune. The Beatles and the Carpenters both had notable cover versions of the song.\n\n19. My Guy—Mary Wells. 1964\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, #1 R&B, 7th Biggest Songs of 1964\n\nWritten and produced by Smokey Robinson. First Motown female solo singer to reach number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Biggest hit song during the career for Mary Wells.\n\n18. It’s a Shame—The Spinners. 1970\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #14 Hot 100, #3 R&B, 76th Biggest Hit of 1970\n\nBiggest charting song for Spinners on Motown label. Co-written by Stevie Wonder, Syreeta Wright and Lee Garrett. Group went on to have 14 Top 40 hits. Billboard Hot 100 between 1972 and 1980.\n\n17. My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)—David Ruffin 1969\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #9 Hot 100, #2 R&B, 97th Biggest Song of 1969\n\nDavid Ruffin was a former member of the Temptations. First hit as a solo artist. The song with its melody and intro is based upon the classical music piece “Frühlingslied” by Felix Mendelssohn.\n\n16. War—Edwin Starr. 1970\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, #3 R&B, 5th Biggest Song of 1970\n\nOne of the best anti-war protest songs from the 20th Century. Edwin Starr earned a Grammy nomination for “War” in 1971. The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame during 1999.\n\n15. I Just Want to Celebrate—Rare Earth. 1971\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #7 Hot 100, #30 R&B, 66th Biggest Song of 1971\n\nBlue eyed soul. Rare Earth was the first all-white rock band signed to Motown. Barry Gordy created a subsidiary label called Rare Earth Records for the band. Had three Top 10 hits on Billboard Hot 100 during 1970 and 1971.\n\n14. What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)—Jr. Walker and the All Stars. 1969\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #4 Hot 100, #1 R&B, #20 Biggest Songs of 1969\n\nExcellent tenor saxophone solos and vocals by Junior Walker. Other instrumentation by the All-Stars with members of The Funk Brothers and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Last Top 10 hit for this Motown band.\n\nFrom my music collection: 45 rpm single of “What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)” by Jr. Walker & the All Stars.\n\n13. Smiling Faces Sometimes—The Undisputed Truth. 1971\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 R&B, #3 Hot 100: 14th biggest hit of 1971\n\nPsychedelic soul trio consisting of Joe Harris, Billie Calvin and Brenda Evans. The lyrics of the song are about “back stabbing” friends and the consequences of those actions.

What Becomes of the Broken Hearted—Jimmy Ruffin. 1966\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #6 B&B, #7 Hot 100\n\nJimmy Ruffin was the older brother of the Temptations lead-singer David Ruffin. One of Motown’s most enduring songs from the 60s. Was Jimmy Ruffin’s biggest record during his career.\n\n11. This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)—The Isley Brothers. 1966\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #6 R&B, #12 Hot 100, 98th biggest song of 1966\n\nThe Isley Brothers only major hit while on the Motown label. Group went on to have 9 Top 40 hits between 1969 and 1980. Rod Stewart and Ronald Isley peaked at number 10 on Billboard Hot 100 in 1990, with a cover of this classic Motown song.\n\n10. Dancing in the Street—Martha and the Vandellas. 1964\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100, 17th biggest song of 1964.\n\nRolling Stone magazine ranks this Motown tune as the “Best Summer Song of all Time.” The song also is considered by some as a civil rights anthem. Martha Reeves invites listeners where ever they may live, to celebrate, have a good time and to “Dance in the Street.”\n\n9. I Heard It Through the Grapevine—Gladys Knight and the Pips 1967\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #1 R&B, #2 Hot 100\n\nAs a response to Aretha Franklin’s song “Respect”, Gladys Knight used the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section to record a funk version of “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” Knight’s number 2 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 happened a year before Marvin Gaye’s 1968 number one smash cover of “Grapevine.” The song is a true Motown soul classic!\n\n8. Bernadette—The Four Tops. 1967\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #3 R&B, #4 Hot 100, 82nd biggest song of 1967\n\nOne of Motown’s greatest bass lines is found on this song. Levi Stubbs provides outstanding vocals on the Four Tops last top 10 hit of the 60s. A false ending and Stubbs shouting “Bernadette” creates a memorable lasting impression on this wonderful tune.\n\n7. The Tracks of My Tears—Smokey Robinson and the Miracles 1965\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 R&B, #16 Hot 100. 78th biggest songs of 1965\n\nCo-written by Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore, and Marv Tarplin, “The Tracks of My Tears” is among the most decorated songs in Motown history. The song has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and is considered one of the greatest songs of the 20th Century.\n\n6. Stop! In the Name of Love—The Supremes 1965\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, #2 R&B. 20th biggest songs of 1965\n\nThe Supremes are the most successful Motown artist of all time. The trio of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballad were golden with their vocal harmonies on this hit. “Stop! In the Name of Love” was the 4th of 5 consecutive number 1 songs for America’s top girl group during 1964 and 1965.\n\n5. I Want You Back—The Jackson 5. 1969/1970\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, #1 R&B, 28th biggest songs of 1970.\n\nDebut single from the Gary, Indiana Jackson family. It was the first of four consecutive singles to reach number 1 on Billboard Hot 100 during 1970. “I Want You Back” is known for the killer bass line played by Wilton Felder. Many music critics proclaim the tune has one of the greatest chord progressions in pop music history.\n\n4. Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours—Stevie Wonder. 1970\n\nPeak Position Billboard Charts: #1R&B, #3 Hot 100 31st biggest songs of 1970\n\nOpening up this pleasing toe-tapping tune is the distinctive sitar riff performed by Eddie Willis. Stevie Wonder produced his own song, and it was his first composition to feature 3 female backup singers. It was the beginning of Wonder’s influence as a musical pioneering maestro during the 70s decade.\n\n3. What’s Going On—Marvin Gaye. 1971\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #1 R&B, #2 Hot 100, 21st biggest song of 1971\n\n1971 was a troublesome time in America. Marvin Gaye’s socially conscious song “What’s Going On” accurately captured the pulse of turmoil that prevailed in our country. The message was relevant 50 years ago. Unfortunately, the issues of this song still hold true in 2021.\n\n“What’s Going On” is among the best and most loved tunes in Motown musical history. Rolling Stone ranks it at number 4 on their, “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” listing. Numerous other music publications place the tune among the best songs from the 20th Century. The “What’s Going On” single remains a crown jewel with Marvin Gaye’s solo discography projects.\n\n2. Ain’t No Mountain High Enough—Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell 1967\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #3 R&B, #19 Hot 100, 87th biggest song of 1967\n\nComing in at number 2 on my countdown, is what I consider to be the best Motown duet of all time: “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. With instrumentation by the Funk Brothers and Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Terrell/Gaye duo have a perfect pop song.\n\nThe song was written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Although Diana Ross’ cover version of Ashford/Simpson’s song was a number 1 crossover hit during 1970, I prefer the rich vocal harmonies of Terrell and Gaye’s original.\n\nWhenever I need a Motown music fix, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell is excellent medicine for my listening pleasure.\n\n1. My Girl—The Temptations 1965\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, #1 R&B, 10th biggest song of 1965\n\nWritten and produced by the Miracles members Smokey Robinson and Ronald White, “My Girl” by the Temptations is my number 1 selection as “Best Motown Song” from the Detroit years.\n\nDavid Ruffin was picked by Smokey Robinson to sing lead vocals on the tune, which became the first number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for the Temptations. “My Girl” is now considered a signature song for the vocal group.\n\nThe Temptations song “My Girl” is one of Motown’s most successful and well-known singles. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998 and placed in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress during 2017.\n\nWithout a doubt, the feel-good pop classic by the Temptations is my favorite Motown song of all time. “My Girl” is “Motown Magic” for me!\n\nNow that I have humbly submitted my thoughts on the best songs of Motown, I am curious to find out your opinion. What do you feel are the greatest singles with the Detroit era of Motown Records? I look forward reading your comments on this topic.\n\nI would also challenge you to come up with your own favorite top Motown songs music list. After compiling your own listing, maybe you can create your own playlist of favorite songs with this Motown category? On Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, Amazon or any other music platform outlet?\n\nI cherish and fondly remember the music of Motown during my youth. It was and still is magic to me. I leave you with lyrics to another legendary Motown magical song: “Sir Duke” by Stevie Wonder. Rock on!\n\n“Music is a world within itself\n\nWith a language we all understand\n\nWith an equal opportunity\n\nFor all to sing, dance and clap their hands\n\nMusic knows that it is and always will\n\nBe one of the things that life just won’t quit”\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nPhoto above by Julianne Woodson\n\nSince the earliest days of rock and roll music during the 1950s, one hit wonders have always existed on Top 40 radio. Artists who had one big hit and then faded into oblivion.\n\nWith this edition of my musical musings, I am concentrating on the superb “One hit wonders” of 1971. I will be counting down the top songs in this category from 50 years ago.\n\nWhat exactly is a “One Hit Wonder?” The basic definition: An artist has only one hit song during their career on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. This music blog message pertains solely to hit songs within the United States.\n\nObviously, there some other rules that should be included if an artist is to be included for consideration as a one hit wonder.\n\nNo other songs from an artist ever peaking at number 40 or higher on the Billboard National Pop Chart. (Chart positions from number 40 to number 1).\n\nOne hit wonders vary from country to country. An artist may have just one hit in the United States but may have multiple hits in another country.\n\nRegional hits are not taken into account: A second song must be a national hit and chart within the Billboard Top 40 pop survey.\n\nAny song peaking outside of the Top 40, are always excluded for consideration.\n\nSongs that peak from numbers 41 through 100 on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart are never considered as second hits.\n\nThe rule that a second song must be a Top 40 Billboard National pop chart hit was established in 1998, by music historian Wayne Jancik in his definitive work on the subject, “The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders.”\n\nPhoto of my 45 rpm single of “Here Comes the Sun” by Richie Havens. A record that I bought in the summer of 1971 and still own here in 2021.\n\nThe subject of “One hit wonders” has always been interesting to me and researching the reasons why some artists have only one hit song. Way before the advent of the Internet, my go to reference for this subject has been “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn. I consider Whitburn’s book to be the “bible” of Top 40 music reference and still proudly own a hard copy of this excellent book.\n\nI grew up in Roanoke, Virginia and have fond memories listening to Top 40 radio in 1971.\n\nDuring daylight hours, I would tune into a couple of Roanoke Valley stations: WROV 1240 AM and WBLU 1480 AM.\n\nWROV was the top-rated radio station in Roanoke and the DJs that I remember during this time period were Bart Prater, Larry Bly, Jack Fisher, Dan Alexander, Ron Tompkins and Phil Beckman.\n\nWROV Roanoke DJ Jack Fisher drinking milk at remote broadcast. Photo is courtesy of the WROV History Online Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nAt sundown, WROV reduced their power and WBLU signed off the air. I would then listen to a variety of 50,000-watt clear channel AM stations at night.\n\nThe two main stations that I listened to during the nighttime were WLS 890 AM Chicago and WABC 770 AM New York. On the Big 89 WLS, Larry Lujack, Chuck Buell, Kris Erik Stevens and Scotty Brink were my favorite DJs. When listening to WABC, Dan Ingram and Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow) are the two radio DJ voices that I remember from 1971.\n\nWLS Chicago Surveys from 1/18/71 and 8/23/71. Photo is courtesy of Pete Battistini: Author of the book, American Top 40 with Casey Kasem (The 1970’s).\n\nOn nights that WLS or WABC were hard to pick up, I had other clear channel stations for my listening pleasure. Among those other stations were, WOWO Fort Wayne 1190 AM, WCFL Chicago 1000 AM, CKLW Windsor, Ontario (Detroit) 800 AM, WKBW Buffalo 1520 AM and WKYC Cleveland 1100 AM.\n\nAt the end of 1971, Billboard Magazine published the top hits of the year. Below all the Top 10 hits from that year. All artists listed on the year-end Top 10 chart had more than one hit during their careers.\n\n1 “Joy to the World” Three Dog Night\n\n2 “Maggie May”/”Reason to Believe” Rod Stewart\n\n3 “It’s Too Late”/”I Feel the Earth Move” Carole King\n\n4 “One Bad Apple” The Osmonds\n\n5 “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” Bee Gees\n\n6 “Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)”\n\nPaul Revere and the Raiders\n\n7 “Go Away Little Girl” Donny Osmond\n\n8 “Take Me Home, Country Roads” John Denver\n\n9 “Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)” Temptations\n\n10 “Knock Three Times” Tony Orlando and Dawn\n\nPhoto of my 45 rpm single that I bought in 1971 and still own today. “Cherish What Is Dear To You (While It’s Near To You” by Freda Payne. This artist is not a one hit wonder.\n\nFor the remainder of this message, I will be focusing on the musical year of 1971 and the numerous excellent one hit wonder songs during this golden year of Top 40 radio.\n\nBefore I start my 1971 one hit wonders countdown, I will be sharing with you a band whom I thought only had 1 hit in America. However, the Canadian group is a “Two Hit Wonder.”\n\n“Sign, sign, everywhere a sign\n\nBlockin’ out the scenery, breakin’ my mind\n\nDo this, don’t do that, can’t you read the sign?”\n\nTrue Confession: Before I started writing this music blog message, I always assumed the song “Signs” by the Five Man Electrical Band as the best one hit wonder of 1971. However, that is erroneous information. The Canadian rock group from Ottawa, Ontario had a second 1971 hit with “Absolutely Right” which peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n“Signs” peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the 24th biggest record for the entire year of 1971. It’s an all-time favorite song for me and my selection as the best “Two Hit Wonder” from 50 years ago.\n\nBesides the excellent song “Signs” and the Five Man Electrical Band, there are a few other “Two hit wonders” that I want to highlight on this message. Another Canadian band in this category are the Stampeders. Formed in Calgary, Alberta, the band reached number 8 with “Sweet City Woman.” They had a second top 40 hit in America with, “Hit the Road Jack” during 1975.\n\nPhotos of 45 rpm singles that I own here in 2021: Both were two hit wonders. “Do You Know What I Mean” came from a jukebox, while “Sweet City Woman” is a single that I bought during the summer of 1971.\n\nI also want to share a couple of other prominent “Two hit wonders” from 1971. American rock musician Lee Michaels hit the top 40 twice that year: “Do You Know What I Mean” reached number 6 and his follow up hit, “Can I Get a Witness” peaked at number 39.\n\nWelsh singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Edmonds reached number 2 with “I Hear Your Knocking” during 1971. His song, “Slipping Away” peaked at number 39 during 1983 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nPhoto of my 45 rpm singles that I bought in 1971 and still own here in 2021. Both are one hit wonders.\n\nAs I evaluated the data from the Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitman, there are two outlier songs that are technically one hit wonders: But I refuse to place either of those artists and/or their songs in that category.\n\n“Me and Bobby McGee” by Janis Joplin. This posthumous number 1 song was Joplin’s only Top 40 hit. She did have two other solo just outside of number 40: “Kozmic Blues” reached 41 and “Cry Baby” peaked at number 42. Joplin also reached number 12 in 1968 with “Piece of My Heart” with Big Brother & Holding Company. In my humble opinion, Ms. Joplin should never be considered a one hit wonder.\n\n“Chicago” by Graham Nash. Is this really a solo song or a band hit? Peaking at number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100, “Chicago” is found on two albums: It was released first on the Crosby Stills Nash and Young’s, “4 Way Street” album during April 1971. Then one month later, it showed up on Graham Nash’s debut solo album, “Songs For Beginners.” With Nash having multiple hits with the Hollies and CSN&Y, he doesn’t deserve the title or status as a one hit wonder artist.\n\nMost of the true one hit wonders from 1971 are songs that I do not mind hearing 50 years later. However, there are a couple of novelty songs in this category that I never, ever want to hear again in my life:\n\nChirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep–Mac and Katie Kisson\n\nChick-A-Boom (Don’t Ya Jes’ Love It)–Daddy Dewdrop\n\nBefore starting the countdown of my favorite Top 13 “one hit wonder” favorites, here are five singles that peaked between numbers 26 and 40:\n\nI’d Love to Change the World—Ten Years After\n\nGames—Redeye\n\nHallelujah—Sweat Hog\n\nResurrection Shuffle—Ashton, Gardner and Dyke\n\n1900 Yesterday—Liz Damon’s Orient Express\n\nNow it is time for my countdown: A baker’s dozen of what I consider to be the best one hit wonders of 1971:\n\n13. I’ve Found Someone on My Own—The Free Movement\n\nPeak position on Billboard Charts: #5 Hot 100, #7 AC\n\nThe Free Movement was a soul/R&B ensemble from Los Angeles, California. Their mellow soft rock hit was the 27th biggest record of 1971.\n\n12. Timothy—The Buoys\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #17 Hot 100: 87th biggest hit of 1971\n\nPop/rock band from the Wilkes-Barre-Scranton, Pennsylvania area. This controversial song written by Rupert Holmes, featured lyrics about a coal mine disaster and cannibalism. The message of the song was problematic. Nevertheless, it was still a hit.\n\n11. Get It On—Chase\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Chart: #24 Hot 100\n\nBill Chase formed a jazz-rock fusion band named after himself. The song “Get It On” sounds similar to what rock bands Chicago or Blood Sweat & Tears recorded during the early 70s.\n\n10. Funky Nassau—The Beginning of the End\n\nPeak position on Billboard Charts: #15 Hot 100, #7 R&B: 75th biggest hit of 1971\n\nFrom Nassau, Bahamas, the Beginning of the End played a variety of musical genres: A hybrid of Funk, R&B, Calypso, Latin, Jazz and Pop. Band was known for their horn section.\n\n9. Mr. Big Stuff—Jean Knight\n\nPeak position on Billboard Charts: #1 R&B, #2 Hot 100: 17th biggest hit of 1971\n\nA sassy, upbeat soul song, that has an excellent bass line. Jean Knight’s song was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 1972 Grammy Awards.\n\n8. Here Comes the Sun—Richie Havens\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #16 Hot 100: 95th biggest hit of 1971\n\n1969 Woodstock singer-songwriter and guitarist Richie Havens performs a superb mid-tempo cover of this George Harrison song. The combination of accompanied conga drum playing, along with Havens’ excellent guitar riffs, makes for an outstanding musical performance.\n\n7. Put Your Hand in the Hand—Ocean\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100: 33rd Biggest Hit of 1971\n\nOriginally recorded by Anne Murray, the Canadian band Ocean had an international smash with their gospel song. “Put Your Hand in the Hand” has been covered by many artists over the years, including by Elvis Presley, Loretta Lynn, Lynn Anderson, Joan Baez and Randy Stonehill. The song was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\n6. One Toke Over the Line—Brewer and Shipley\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #10 Hot 100: 63rd Biggest Hit of 1971\n\nAmerican folk rock duo Brewer & Shipley had a contentious hit song during 1971, with lyrics mentioning Jesus and drug usage. According to Wikipedia: “U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew, tried to get the FCC to ban the song on American radio.” Obviously, Agnew wasn’t successful banning “One Tote Over the Line” and it can still be heard on U.S. radio here in 2021.\n\n5. Toast and Marmalade for Tea—Tin Tin\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Chart: #20 Hot 100\n\nMaurice Gibb of the Bee Gees produced the only hit for the Australian rock band. Tin Tin’s song features tight harmonies and starts off with a distinctive piano melody. The tune then builds by adding multiple guitars, bass, drums, brass and stringed instruments, making a pleasing crescendo at the end of the song.\n\n4. Rings—Cymarron\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts: #17 Hot 100, #6 AC\n\nCymarron was a band out of Memphis, Tennessee and they named their band after a 60’s TV show called, “Cimarron Strip.” Lyrics to the song mentions listening to “James Taylor on the stereo” and is considered a quintessential soft rock tune of the early 70s. Tompall & the Glaser Brothers recorded a cover version of “Rings” and it reached number 7 on the Billboard County Singles Chart. Their rendition mentions listening to “Merle Haggard on the stereo.”\n\n3. Woodstock—Matthews Southern Comfort\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #23 Hot 100\n\nA song that Joni Mitchell wrote during 1969, “Woodstock” had already been a hit for Crosby Stills Nash & Young during the Spring of 1970. British country folk/rock band Matthews Southern Comfort recorded another cover of Mitchell’s anthem, and their version became a hit in 1971. This newer version of the song featured a slower tempo and had a country/rock vibe. Ironically, Iain Matthews left his own band before “Woodstock” became a hit in America.\n\n2. Wedding Song (There is Love)—Paul Stookey\n\nPeak positions on Billboard Charts: #3 AC, #24 Hot 100: 92nd biggest hit of 1971\n\nNoel Paul Stookey first gain musical popularity with the folk-rock trio Peter, Paul and Mary in 1961. Their group broke up for the first time during 1970 and Stookey’s only solo hit came the following year. “Wedding Song (There is Love)” became a popular song played at weddings during the 70s and the tune is still performed at some marriage ceremonies nearly 50 years later.\n\nSmiling Faces Sometimes—The Undisputed Truth\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 R&B, #3 Hot 100: 14th biggest hit of 1971\n\nThe Undisputed Truth was a psychedelic soul/R&B Motown trio consisting of Joe Harris, Billie Calvin and Brenda Evans. The lyrics of the song are about “back stabbing” friends and the consequences of those actions. The Funk Brothers session band provides outstanding musicianship and the trio maintains excellent harmonies on this melodic tune. Without a doubt, “Smiling Faces Sometimes” is my favorite one hit wonder from 1971.\n\nNow that I have humbly submitted my thoughts on “one hit wonders” of 1971, I am curious to find out your opinion on the music from that year.\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique of the “one hit wonder” songs from 1971. The songs that you might feel are the best, maybe be completely different from my selections.\n\nSo I am asking for your opinion: What do you consider to be the best “one hit wonders” of 50 years ago? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart. I cherish and fondly remember my favorite “one hit wonders” of 1971. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\n“Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes. Time may change me but I can’t trace time.” David Bowie’s lyrics are an accurate description for me during 1985. Thirty-five years ago, I was engaged in July and then married the love of my life at the end of December.\n\nFast forward to December 27, 2020: The day I am publishing this message. Today is my 35th wedding anniversary with Priscilla. As I celebrate with my wife, I am thankful for our time together since 1985 and looking forward to many more years together. Priscilla: I love you!\n\nThe year of 1985 was also a transition year for me listening to music on radio. It was the last year that I actively listened to popular songs on a daily basis: On multiple radio stations playing current top-rated songs or watching music videos on MTV. My desire to keep up with American Top 40 and the latest hit songs, waned after this time period.\n\nLyrics for the Guess Who’s 1969 hit, “No Time” conveys my radio listening habits after 1985: “Seasons changed and so did I, you need not wonder why, there’s no time left for you.” The music being played on all-hit radio stations was slowly changing. By the end of the 80s decade, most of the top hits on the Billboard Hot 100, were no longer pleasing to my ears.\n\nSince 1985 is the last year that I can give a complete overview of hit music on the radio, I will be counting down what I consider to be my favorite bodacious singles from the midway point of the 80s decade.\n\nRadio & Records (R&R) was a trade publication providing news and airplay information for radio stations in America. During the early 80s, R&R coined the term Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR) as a new description to the format formerly known as Top 40. With the advent of the CHR name, most radio stations that had this format were located on the FM band.\n\nDuring the early to mid 80s, I was drawn to the CHR format as I had worked in the radio industry as a young man. My first radio position started in 1974 at Top 40 WROV 1240 AM Roanoke. After my radio career ended in 1980, I still had a keen interest with any radio station using a CHR or Top 40 hybrid format.\n\nA framed WROV Roanoke poster that is owned by Barry Michaels: Who worked as a DJ at WROV from 1978 through 1981 and provided his photo for my music blog.\n\nWhenever I traveled outside of my home of Roanoke, Virginia during the 80s, I would always seek out CHR/Top 40 radio stations, especially in major markets. Here are some of the CHR stations that I heard live in either 1983 and 1984, while I was on various vacations:\n\nWCAU Philadelphia\n\nZ100 New York\n\nWPLJ New York\n\nKISS 108 Boston\n\nWTIC Harford\n\nWPRO Providence\n\nQ107 Washington\n\nB104 Baltimore\n\nQ94 Richmond\n\nZ104 Norfork\n\nKDWB Minneapolis\n\nKITS San Francisco\n\nKMEL San Francisco\n\nKKHR Los Angeles\n\nKIIS FM Los Angeles\n\nB100 San Diego\n\nK92 Roanoke DJ Staff on the cover of Roanoker Magazine. From Left: Bill Jordan, David Lee Michaels, John Berry, Larry Dowdy, Vince Miller and Russ Brown.

My position title was Transportation Supervisor for truck dispatch activities with our third shift overnight operations. Each night while at work, I would listen to Roanoke Valley radio stations.\n\nOn a typical night during my shift, I would listen to a couple of radio stations while executing various job duties. My choice of radio stations was limited: Local Roanoke AM stations had weak night signals and the building structure prohibited clear access for those radio transmissions. WXLK (K92) and WSLQ (Q99) were the two stations I listened to nightly during 1985.\n\nQ99 had a hybrid CHR/Adult Contemporary radio format during 1985. I listened to Q99 throughout the night as they featured a live syndicated show via satellite called Nighttime America (NA). Legendary WCFL Chicago DJ Bob Dearborn was the host of NA and is known for his complete analysis of Don McLean’s epic song, “America Pie.” Dearborn played all of the current 1985 top hits during his live radio broadcast.\n\nK92 Roanoke morning “K Crew” staff. Larry Dowdy, Mike Stevens and Bill Jordan inside K92 studio. Photo courtesy of Larry Dowdy.\n\nThen at 5:00 am every morning, I would switch over my radio to K92, the leading station of the Roanoke/Lynchburg market. The morning drive “K Crew” of Bill Jordan, Larry Dowdy and Mike Stevens was always informative, entertaining and played all the current hits. I always enjoyed hearing the smooth presentation of DJs Jordan and Dowdy on K92, and had the pleasure of working with both guys, when we all were employed by WROV Roanoke during 1975.\n\nDuring my non-employment hours 35 years ago, I would alternate listening to WROV, K92 and Q99. My preference during daytime hours was listening to WROV and DJ Rob O’Brady: His vocal delivery style was personal, distinctive and warm. I also would tune in to part time WROV weekend DJs Larry Bly, Fred Frelantz and Jack Fisher during 1985.\n\nWROV 1240 AM DJ Rob O’Brady inside the station studio. Photo courtesy of Steve Nelson and the WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nThere were also a couple of other CHR FM stations out of North Carolina that I would listen to during day time hours, as both had strong signals that came in clearly at my Roanoke home: WKZL (107.5) Winston-Salem and G105 (105.1) Raleigh/Durham.\n\nK92 Roanoke DJs Tripper and Larry Dowdy inside the K92 studio. My thanks to Larry Dowdy for providing his photo to be used here.\n\nOn multiple weekends in 1985, I would travel to various locations inside the state of Virginia. The top five CHR stations I heard on these trips:\n\nZ104 Norfolk\n\nQ94 Richmond\n\nQ107 Washington (Northern Virginia)\n\nWAVA Washington (Northern Virginia)\n\nB106 Washington (Northern Virginia)\n\nIn June, I went on vacation with my sister Kathryn. By auto, we traveled to Canada from our Roanoke home. While Kathryn and I were in Toronto, we saw Don McLean in concert at Ontario Place amphitheater. Below are the stations I remembering hearing on this trip:\n\nWink 104 Harrisburg\n\nWGCL Cleveland\n\nCHUM Toronto\n\nCFTR Toronto\n\nB94 Pittsburgh\n\nWNCI Columbus\n\nWHYT Detroit\n\nMy photo capturing the rocky coast of Maine. Location is Acadia National Park.\n\nA couple month later in August, I made a trip to Union, Maine and met my future in-laws. With my fiancé Priscilla, I heard KISS 108 Boston, plus two CHR stations in Portland and Bangor. I remember first hearing “Cherish” by Kool and the Gang when Priscilla and I traveled to Lucia Beach at Birch Point Beach State Park, to view the rocky coast of Maine.\n\nThen on my honeymoon in Florida during the last week of December, Priscilla and I listened to Q105 Tampa and BJ105 Orlando. While in Clearwater Beach, we heard “Living in America” by James Brown for the first time on the radio.\n\nMy wife Priscilla and her pelican friend at Clearwater Beach, Florida. On our honeymoon December 1985.\n\nFor the remainder of this message, I will be focusing on what I consider to be the essential CHR songs of 1985. With my extensive knowledge and listening to numerous CHR stations 35 years ago, I have come up with a countdown with my quintessential 1985 favorite tunes.\n\nMy reference for this subject is, “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn. I consider Whitburn’s book to be the “bible” of Top 40 music reference and still proudly own a hard copy of this excellent book.\n\nBefore revealing my top songs of 1985 countdown, I have tabulated 10 other songs that are favorites for me but failed to crack my Top 20 listing. These selections are not ranked and placed in a random order:\n\nWalking on Sunshine—Katrina & the Waves\n\nI Want to Know What Love Is—Foreigner\n\nBetter Be Good to Me—Tina Turner\n\nPower of Love—Huey Lewis & the News\n\nSummer of ’69—Bryan Adams\n\nWhat About Love—Heart\n\nEvery Time You Go Away—Paul Young\n\nNo More Lonely Nights—Paul McCartney\n\nBorn in the U.S.A.–Bruce Springsteen\n\nDon’t You (Forget About Me)—Simple Minds\n\nStaring off my countdown are numbers 20 through 14. These are all excellent songs that I never get tired of hearing. As Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 show, “Now on with the countdown.”\n\n20.

Perfect pop/rock song for the 80s decade.\n\nNow that I have submitted my top 20 favorite CHR songs from 1985, I am curious to find out your thoughts on the biggest hits in America from the mid-point of the 80s decade.\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with the critique of my favorite songs from 35 years ago. Your top songs maybe be completely different than my selections. There are no right or wrong answers, just various opinions. What do you feel are the best, greatest or most significant CHR songs from 1985?\n\nMy reflections of the music from 35 years ago, reminds me of another excellent song that was a hit during the summer of 1985: “Glory Days” by Bruce Springsteen. Contemporary Hit Radio was strong, vibrant and alive during 1985. It was truly the glory days for the CHR format in America.\n\nLiving in the past is never a good thing but remembering the excellent music found on CHR radio during 1985 remains strong in my memory bank. I leave you with lyrics from my second favorite song from 1985: “The Boys of Summer” by Don Henley:\n\n“Out on the road today\n\nI saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac\n\nA little voice inside my head said\n\n“Don’t look back, you can never look back”\n\nI thought I knew what love was, what did I know?\n\nThose days are gone forever\n\nI should just let them go”\n\nLong live the quintessential CHR songs of 1985: Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nWithout any doubt, musician and singer-songwriter Sara Niemietz has made lemonade out of lemons during the year 2020. In a year where the COVID-19 pandemic reeked-havoc, music artists across America had to come up with new ways to make their music happen.\n\nObviously, Niemietz wasn’t the only person to have their world turn upside down, as all live concerts and performances ceased to occur. Despite the gloomy world outlook, Sara created new and different ways to bring music to her fans, with various online presentations.\n\nSo who is Sara Niemietz? Born in Chicago Illinois, Niemietz started her career as a child actress, performing in theatre productions, television shows, film roles and multiple musical performances. To read more about Sara’s many non-musical accomplishments, please go to her official website: https://www.saraniemietz.com/\n\nNow as an adult, Sara has focused exclusively on being a musician, singing and writing music. During the past decade, Niemietz has collaborated with W.G. Snuffy Walden, who is a musician and a composer. Walden has accompanied Sara on various music projects. Some are cover versions of songs, while other tunes are original compositions.\n\nThe other big activity for Niemietz is being involved with Scott Bradlee’s, Postmodern Jukebox (PMJ) group. PMJ is known for taking popular 21st century contemporary songs and rearranging those songs into a different musical style. Many of the PMJ songs are performed in 1920’s jazz or swing format.\n\nFor anyone interested in reading more about Sara’s musical accomplishments prior to 2020, I had the opportunity to write her musical story on DJ Dave’s Musical Musings during April 2019. You can view Sara Niemietz: Born For the Stage here: https://woodsonrva.com/2019/04/12/sara-niemietz-born-for-the-stage/\n\nPhoto of Sara Niemietz by Jeff Xander Photography\n\nWith this latest music blog message on Niemietz, I communicated with Sara multiple times via email about her musical activities over the past 9 months.\n\nAt the start of 2020, things looked promising for Niemietz. Plans to record a live album actually took place during February. Sara also had scheduled concert tours to take place in the spring and summer. However, Coronavirus changed all plans starting in mid-March.\n\nAs Scottish Poet Robert Burns once wrote, “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” All live concerts, shows and performances came to a screeching halt.\n\nI asked Sara about her quarantine and social/distancing engagements when lockdowns started happening in her home state of California. She outlined to me about the wide range of new ventures she participated in, which differed from normal musical activities prior to COVID-19 pandemic days.\n\nOver the course of the next 9 months, Niemietz utilized many new functions to keep active with her music fans on social media. Sara coped and survived during the Coronavirus crisis by implementing fresh alternatives to live concerts:\n\nLive virtual mini concerts\n\nAlthough Niemietz regularly performed mini concerts virtually prior to COVID-19, she ramped up the number of these online interactions on social media platforms. The vast majority of the mini concerts were in the comfort of her own home: With Sara playing a variety of instruments (guitar, bass, keyboard and kazoo).\n\nSixty Second Sara videos\n\nEarly on during the Coronavirus outbreak, Niemietz created short videos that lasted around 60 seconds. Some of the videos Sara generated were original compositions while other performances utilized cover versions of popular existing songs.\n\nSaraband\n\nWith a computer, sound board, musical instruments and various other audio equipment, Niemietz “cloned” herself and created “Saraband.” The Saraband video for the Smokey Robinson cover song, “You’ve Really Got a Hold of Me” is absolutely brilliant.\n\nWeekly Wacky Wednesday\n\nLike clockwork, every Wednesday afternoon during the COVID-19 pandemic, Niemietz holds a weekly virtual live stream on social media. With these Internet performances, Sara performs a wide variety of songs and she encourages major interaction with her fans during these weekly sessions.\n\nSaranade Podcast\n\nAt the beginning of November 2020, Niemietz produced her first podcast called Saranade. Her debut message featured the song, “Don’t Walk Me Home” which is the third song on Sara’s new, “twentytwenty” live album. I personally enjoyed listening to the first podcast: Niemietz did an excellent job imparting information and mixing in her music, for a pleasing balance of verbal communication and musical harmony.\n\nSaranade Podcast audio link: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1455049/6151573-episode-1-don-t-walk-me-home-the-411-on-twentytwenty\n\nAnother major project that Niemietz worked on during the summer months was putting together a new live album which came to be called “twentytwenty.” Sara, Snuffy Walden and a group of hand-picked musicians, performed two Santa Monica, California concerts in front of live audiences, during late February. The plan was to release a live album from these two shows, around the beginning of the summer.\n\nJust a couple of weeks after recording the February concerts, COVID-19 pandemic raged in America. Once again, Niemietz had to switch gears with music endeavors and postpone the release date of her new “twentytwenty” album until October.\n\nBefore I give my overview of the new “twentytwenty” album, I want to share some of my email conversations that I had with Niemietz and her responses to my questions on how she dealt with the Coronavirus shutdown as a musician.\n\nDJ Dave: Please share anything related about the two concerts during late February that resulted in the “twentytwenty” album?\n\nSara: It was a supreme joy to play with my friends, knowing this night would be captured forever! With that in mind, one could think the pressure would be high, but there was such a lovely, relaxed atmosphere in the room. The audience were close friends and select fans, so we could feel the love from the stage!\n\nDJ Dave: Can you tell me about the process of taking the live concert tapes and making them into the final product of a new album?\n\nSara: It certainly helped keep us occupied during COVID lockdown! There was a lot of excel sheet making and note taking on my end, as Snuffy and I listened to the shows and decided which takes from which nights we’d use. It was like living the show all over again! Many times, in fact. A first for me, we could not all be in the room during the mixing process. Snuffy, George Landress (our mixing engineer for a decade), and I passed many files back and forth. Plenty of FaceTimes later, we got it all finished!\n\nDJ Dave: Do you have any comments about the recording of individual songs on the “twentytwenty” album?\n\nSara: Our goal on this album was to capture a moment in time. Snuffy and I have been playing shows together for a decade and we wanted to capture the magic of a live show – really document this moment – and share it with listeners. I love studio recording and that environment is my second home, but there is something about playing live that is very hard to capture unless you’re there… in the room… with people… on a stage!\n\nDJ Dave: Describe being an independent musician/singer/songwriter without a major record label contract?\n\nSara: Yes indeed! I am in it for the long haul. Nothing against all of the different paths musicians take to get their songs out there, but the indie path has been good to me. Miraculously, the album landed on the Top 100 Albums list on Billboard, which is very rare for an indie. It is really thanks to those that listen. I know everyone says “I have the best fans… yada yada…” but seriously – these friends of mine are the best and I am so grateful for their support. I feel weird saying “fans” because I just feel like we are all a bunch of wacky music lovers hanging out together.\n\nSnuffy Walden and Sara Niemietz. Photo by Jeff Xander Photography\n\nThe day before “twentytwenty” was released on October 16, Sara and her musical partner Snuffy Walden, held a live stream virtual concert to promote her new album. Joining Niemietz and Walden at this show were Jonathan Richards, Martin Diller, Andrew Kesler, Alex Nester, Mollie Weaver, Mihi Nihil, MWO and Kiya Schafer.\n\nMost of the band members who played with Sara and Snuffy during the October 15th album premier concert, were also part of the two February shows, which culminated in Sara’s newest LP, “twentytwenty.” The album was recorded live at Apogee Studio, Santa Monica, California, and all songs were produced by Niemietz and Walden.\n\nFrom the “twentytwenty” liner notes, here are the artists and musicians who performed on the live compilation album:\n\nGuitar – W.G. Snuffy Walden\n\nGuitar – Sara Niemietz\n\nPiano – Andrew Kesler\n\nDrums – Martin Diller\n\nBass – Jonathan Richards\n\nVocals- Sara Niemietz\n\nBackground Vocals – Alex Nester\n\nBackground Vocals – Mollie Weaver\n\nThere are 17 songs on the “twentytwenty” album. Five of the selections are cover versions, while the other twelve songs on the live set are originals. Niemietz is credited with writing or co-writing all 12 of the original songs: Sara also shares co-writing credits with Snuffy Walden, along with a handful of other musical artists, on the outstanding compositions.\n\nHere is the song order listing for the “twentytwenty” live recording:\n\nSmile\n\nI Smile\n\nDon’t Walk Me Home\n\nMade to Last\n\nMonroe\n\nLet Me Be\n\nThe Nearness of You\n\nGo With the Flow\n\nAll Your Love\n\nFeet Don’t Touch the Floor\n\nCalling You\n\nHear Me Now\n\nOut of Order\n\nShine\n\nWaiting On the Day\n\nOn Ten\n\nStand By Me\n\nInstrumentally, Sara and her band play a wide variety musical genres on the “twentytwenty.” The musicians flow seamlessly combining pop, rock, jazz, blues, folk and country throughout the course of any given song.\n\nAs I have listened repeatedly to the new live album, I have been impressed with the quality of musicianship with the band. The live performances of existing songs from Sara’s musical catalog, brings new energy and freshness to many of the beloved tunes that Niemietz has recorded from past studio albums.\n\nOf course, the main attraction of ‘twentytwenty” is the voice of Sara Niemietz. Adjectives like exceptional, spectacular, incredible and impressive all come to my mind when I try to convey Sara’s accomplished vocal range. Niemietz expresses vocal excellence throughout her new live album set.\n\nWhile there are many marvelous songs on Sara’s new album, I will be highlighting just a few of the sensational tunes with my review. I would encourage you to purchase a copy of “twentytwenty” so that you can discover and enjoy the full range of songs that Niemietz released last month.\n\nPhoto of Sara Niemietz by Jeff Xander Photography\n\nWhen I survey the setlist of Sara’s new album, I am struck by a possibly unintentional foreshadowing of dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic. The first two songs that Niemietz and her band played in late February, just a few weeks before COVID-19 consumed America, were “Smile” and “I Smile.”\n\nSmile: Written by Charlie Chaplin, John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons (1936/1954)\n\n“Smile, though your heart is aching, Smile, even though it’s breaking,\n\nWhen there are clouds in the sky, you’ll get by\n\nIf you smile through your fear and sorrow, Smile and maybe tomorrow,\n\nYou’ll see the sun come shining through for you.”\n\nI Smile: Written by Kirk Franklin, James Harris, Terry Lewis and Frederick Tackett (2011)\n\n“Today’s a new day, but there is no sunshine, Nothing but clouds, and it’s dark in my heart,\n\nAnd it feels like a cold night, Today’s a new day, where are my blue skies\n\nWhere is the love and the joy that you promised me, Tell me it’s alright,\n\nI almost gave up, but a power that I can’t explain, Fell from heaven like a shower\n\nI smile, even though I hurt see I smile, I know God is working so I smile, Even though I’ve been here for a while, I smile, smile.”\n\nThere is an overriding theme with the above two songs and with many other tunes that Niemietz recorded for the new album: When times are bad and bleak, don’t give up. Smile. Things will get better. This affirming message from Sara is powerful and is encouraging for me as I navigate through these final troubled months of 2020.\n\nMonroe\n\nPerhaps the most melodic song on the new live album is “Monroe.” This tender ballad features Sara on acoustic guitar and outstanding standup bass playing from Jonathan Richards. Niemietz provides superb emotional outpouring with her heavenly vocals on this wonderful tune. This selection is my current favorite on “twentytwenty.”\n\nMade To Last\n\nSnuffy Walden is an excellent guitarist and his guitar presentation on “Made to Last” is absolutely transcendent. I appreciate Walden’s world-class guitar licks and the interplay of the other musicians with Sara’s stellar vocal range. The tune has an infectious rhythmic section and is a hot rocking, flame throwing masterpiece.\n\nOn Ten\n\nOne of the encore songs for Sara during her February concerts is the lively, “On Ten.” Musically, the song is a crown jewel: A combination of rock, pop, jazz, blues and old school funk. The band is in hyper-drive as they lay down fast-paced, up tempo grooves on this unforgettable musical treat. Sara and the musicians are joyful performing this celebratory delight.\n\nI highly recommend Sara’s live set compilation. For those who do not yet own a copy of the new album, here is the link to order this outstanding performance from Niemietz and her band. Available in different formats: Vinyl, DVD, CD and Digital Download: https://www.saraniemietz.com/music\n\nWith anyone who is new to Sara’s music, her “twentytwenty” album is an excellent introduction and overview of the music Niemietz has recorded over the past 10 years. No matter if you have been a fan for years or just learning about Sara’s music for the first time: The “twentytwenty” live set should be considered a priority, for adding to all personal music libraries.\n\nPhoto of Sara Niemietz by Jeff Xander Photography\n\nThe year of 2020 has been extremely hard, unpredictable and sometimes down right depressing for those around the world. This is especially true for music artists. With live concerts not being an option during COVID-19 pandemic, performers like Sara has turned negative situations into positive outcomes.\n\nI imagine that Sara will be singing a cover of Wet Willie’s 1974 hit, “Keep on Smilin” into the year 2021.\n\n“Keep on smilin’ through the rain, laughin’ at the pain\n\nRollin with the changes til the sun comes out again\n\nKeep on smilin’ through the rain, laughin’ at the pain\n\nRollin’ with the changes, singin’ this refrain”\n\nTurning lemons into lemonade is what Sara Niemietz has done throughout the year of 2020. I am confident that she will continue the same course of action until Coronavirus has subsided in our world. Keep on smiling, Sara!

In our portion of Virginia, we celebrate the rich legacy of two Appalachian mountain music pioneers: The Carter Family, founders of country music and Dr. Ralph Stanley, from the first generation of prominent bluegrass musicians.\n\nSince the early formation of Appalachian mountain music, the bluegrass genre of music has flourished in Southwestern Virginia. There is now a new generation of musicians playing bluegrass in my home city of Roanoke: The Brothers Young.\n\nThe Brothers Young are a duo of actual siblings: Ayden and Blane Young. Older brother Ayden is 15 and plays banjo, while Blane handles mandolin duties at age 11. Parents for these talented bluegrass performers are Melissa and Chad Young of Roanoke.\n\nAyden and Blane have been playing together for the past three years. Their mother Melissa Young provided the following text on how her sons became a musical bluegrass duo:\n\n“The Brothers Young is a brother duo playing bluegrass in the mountains of Roanoke, Virginia. Close to the Crooked Road – Virginia’s Heritage Music Trail of SW Virginia and heart of traditional music. Their love for Bluegrass music came from growing up listening to classics such as Flatt & Scruggs, Ralph Stanley, Osborne Brothers and many more.\n\nAyden found an old banjo at his grandparents’ house about 3 years ago and it was an instant connection! He had to learn “Foggy Mtn. Breakdown.” We were given a mandolin to borrow from a family at church since they knew Ayden was into bluegrass, but his younger brother Blane took to the mandolin and the Brothers Young was born.”\n\nMy first experience hearing the Brothers Young play music live was during May 2019, at an Anglican parish, Church of the Holy Spirit (COTHS) in Roanoke. The event was celebrating the 30-year anniversary of Quigg Lawrence, being lead pastor for the COTHS congregation. Lawrence is also a Bishop with the Anglican Church in North America.\n\nBishop Lawrence loves bluegrass music and he invited guitarist/vocalist Junior Sisk from Ferrum, Virginia, to perform music at this celebration. Ayden and Blane joined Sisk that afternoon to play various bluegrass tunes.\n\nThe second encounter that I had hearing TBY was earlier this year at Church of the Holy Spirit, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In February, COTHS had a chili cook-off fundraising event, to raise funds for Rwanda missions. Brothers Ayden and Blane provided music throughout the event that was pleasing to my ears.\n\nIn preparation for me writing this music message on TBY, I had the opportunity to speak with Ayden, Blane and their mother Melissa, with a 30-minute interview via Zoom. We spoke on a wide variety of topics, including playing with Junior Sisk and recording a couple of bluegrass songs at Mountain Fever Studios in Willis, Virginia.\n\nDuring my interview, I asked the Blane and Ayden when they started listening to bluegrass music? Ayden attributes listening to old bluegrass records when visiting his grandfather, Allen Worrell of Courtland, Virginia as a younger boy. The Brothers Young were also exposed to other types of music genres, by their parents Chad and Melissa.\n\nThe pivotal moment for heightened awareness of bluegrass music came during 2017 when Ayden brought home an old beaten-up banjo from his grandparents’ home. Soon after, Ayden started taking banjo lessons and his love for the instrument grew. Just two years later, Ayden placed 2nd at the Galax Old Fiddlers Convention for Youth banjo during August 2019.\n\nAyden disclosed to me that he considers Earl Scruggs as his biggest influence with the three-finger banjo picking style. The older brother is also versatile and accomplished, playing two other instruments: Guitar and the piano. Ayden is talented with his piano skills and has composed a few songs with this instrument, including a tune called, “Roanoke Rag.”\n\nBlane is the quiet member of TBY and plays the mandolin. Considering that he took up his instrument just two years ago, his mandolin dexterity is strong and his skills continue to improve on a monthly basis. It is impressive to me how smooth Blane performs when playing his mandolin. Ricky Skaggs is the bluegrass artist that the younger brother admires, in relation to excellent mandolin musicians.\n\nObviously, music is a big part in the lives of Blane and Ayden. Spirituality also plays an important role with the daily routines for the boys. An important mentor is Bishop Quigg Lawrence, who provides both musical and spiritual guidance for the Brothers Young.\n\nI asked Bishop Lawrence for some of his opinions on the Brothers Young as he has watched the boys grow with their musical talents over the past three years:\n\n“It has been really fun to watch these boys progress in their musicianship. They have gotten really good, really fast. I remember the first time I heard Ayden play banjo, I thought, “that little dude is pretty good and has potential.” At the time he had been playing for maybe a year.”\n\n“Blane is a kid to watch. Instead of chopping rhythm, (his little hands are too small for four finger chords), he mainly plays lead. With his current rate of progress, by the time he is 16 he will be turning heads and able to play with most anyone. Crowds find little Blane, endearing; He just grins from ear to ear and “goes for it.”\n\n“One of the things I love most about these boys has nothing to do with their talent. They are humble and know that the Lord has given them these talents. They are never preachy but neither are they shy to give the Lord credit.”\n\nOctober 2020 has been an exciting month for the Brothers Young. The duo had two Roanoke TV interviews after the release of their debut single, “Pretty Polly.” TBY spoke with Melissa Gaona on the WDBJ, “7 @ Four” show and then were featured on the WFXR, “Loving Living Local” program by Kianna Price.\n\nThe bluegrass duo recently performed their latest single, “Roanoke” live on the WDBJ7 afternoon program 7@Four and was interviewed by Melissa Gaona on July 13, 2021.\n\nBoth of the Young brothers TV appearances focused on the duo recording two songs at Mountain Fever Studios in Willis, Virginia, with well-established bluegrass artists. Ayden and Blane expressed to me how thankful they were for the opportunity to be with Junior Sisk and the other musicians assembled for their debut recording experience.\n\nThe Brothers Young had an outstanding lineup of musicians according to Melissa Young:\n\n“The boys got an amazing opportunity to collaborate with some amazing musicians back in August. Ayden plays banjo and Blane added mandolin chops. The amazing vocals from Junior Sisk and Heather Berry Mabe. On mandolin: Johnathan Dillon, guitar: Heather Mabe, fiddle: Doug Bartlett, bass: Scott Mulvahill.\n\nOn that hot summer day in August, Blane and Ayden recorded two songs with the consummate bluegrass band: “Pretty Polly” and “Little Birdie.” Also in the studio that day was Quigg Lawrence, who was the connection between Junior Sisk and TBY coming together to record music with the bluegrass all-star musicians.\n\nHere are some observations that Lawrence had when he saw the Brothers Young in the recording studio for the first time:\n\n“I was struck by how confident these kids were in the studio. At their age, I would have wet my pants to play in a recording studio with one of the best in the country, but they just jumped right in and played their hearts out. When Junior Sisk and his band heard them play during the warm up at Mountain Fever Studio, I THINK THEIR JAWS DROPPED. Sisk could not believe how much the boys had improved in one year.”\n\nTwo weeks ago, “Pretty Polly” was the first TBY song to be released as a single. The debut tune features vocals by Junior Sisk and Heather Mabe. The second TBY single to be released will be “Little Birdie” on November 13. Here is the link to purchase the “Pretty Polly” single: https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/thebrothersyoungwithjuniorsiskandheathermabe/pretty-polly\n\nI enjoyed speaking with Ayden and Blane about playing bluegrass music and being in a recording studio for the first time. At the end of our Zoom conversation, I asked the brothers about their plans for the future: Is playing bluegrass music for a living something that the brothers want to pursue when they become adults?\n\nThe consensus among the Brothers Young on future bluegrass career plans are unclear at this time. Both Ayden and Blane said they wanted to attend college after graduation from high school and explore different options with career paths.\n\nBlane and Ayden also proclaimed wisdom to me when they shared how they wanted to be guided by the path that God was directing for them, as they grow from boyhood into adults. Being a positive Christian witness is important for TBY.\n\nOfficial Facebook page for the Brothers Young: https://www.facebook.com/thebrothersyoung/\n\nOfficial YouTube channel for the Brothers Young videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/mamaov2kids\n\nFor the immediate future, playing bluegrass music is a focal point for the Brothers Young. They are committed to improving their banjo and mandolin skills, wholeheartedly maintaining excellence as musicians.\n\nI am encouraged to see the dedication and loyalty that Ayden and Blane show as they endeavor to hone their craft of playing bluegrass music together. Obviously, we do not know what the future holds in store for the bluegrass boys. I am confident the Brothers Young of Roanoke will be a positive force within the local Southwestern Virginia community from this point forward.

For TV viewing in 1975, there were only 4 options: Local affiliates for CBS, NBC, ABC and PBS. On the radio side of broadcasting, Roanoke had 7 AM and 5 FM stations. Of the seven AM stations, here is the breakdown of formats:\n\nTop 40\n\nMiddle of the Road (MOR)\n\nNews/Talk\n\nCountry\n\nReligious (2 stations)\n\nR&B/Soul\n\nOver on the FM band, there was even less variety:\n\nBeautiful Music (2 stations)\n\nPublic Radio\n\nReligious\n\nMOR\n\nWhile other radio markets had viable strong FM stations playing contemporary music such as Top 40, album rock and country back in 1975, Roanoke listeners still had to rely on AM stations to provide them with up-to-date popular music. It took another 5 years before FM radio took hold in the Roanoke area, with the advent of K92 (WXLK) 92.3 FM on January 1st, 1980.\n\nDuring the halfway point of the 70’s decade, Top 40 outlet WROV 1240 AM dominated the Roanoke radio market. The station was small in radio power: Transmitting only 1,000 watts in the daytime and 250 watts at night. Even though WROV’s coverage area was only 25 miles wide, the station totally controlled radio listenership within the Roanoke Valley.\n\nI started my first job in radio at age 18, working for WROV during April 1974. I was a student at Virginia Western Community College, obtaining an Associate Degree in Radio & TV Broadcasting.\n\nAt WROV, I was hired to be a remote engineer by the Top 40 radio station. My responsibilities at the station included setting up equipment for remote broadcasts, running the soundboard and playing records, while a WROV DJ was in charge of announcing duties.\n\nMy first remote broadcast with WROV in April ‘74 was with DJ Larry Bly at the Roanoke Catholic High School “Spring Carnival” event. My last worked remote for the station was with Starr Stevens at Discount Records, Tanglewood Mall in November 1975.\n\nIn between my debut with Bly and farewell broadcast with Stevens, I worked around 20 remote broadcasts with legendary WROV DJ Bart Prater. Some of the other DJs whom I worked multiple remotes with include Chuck Holloway, Rob O’Brady, Rich Randall and Dave Hunter.\n\nMost remotes were in the 3 to 4-hour range. The longest remote I worked was on Labor Day 1975 at Lowe’s on Orange Avenue with a legendary WROV DJ from the 60’s: Jack Fisher. It was a “solid gold holiday weekend” and I played all 50’s and early 60’s rock & roll that day.\n\nMany of my fondest memories working at WROV are with Bart Prater. He started at the station in 1968, coming from WOLD Marion, Virginia. Prater spent the next 13 years of employment at WROV, before moving over to crosstown Top 40 giant K92 during 1981.\n\nAlthough Prater was a shy person by nature, his radio personally came alive when the microphone switch was turned on from mute: Prater was a shining star and delivered big as the afternoon drive DJ for WROV.\n\nWhile I was employed at the station, Prater won the 1975 Billboard Magazine Medium-Market Radio Personality of the Year award. After winning the award, I remember Bart telling me that Top 40 KILT AM Houston had offered him a job but he turned them down. Prater said, “I didn’t like the big city and Roanoke is my home. I decided to stay here.”\n\nI have two memories working with Bart Prater that stand out for me. When WROV first bought a wireless microphone for the station, Bart and I were at Lakeside Amusement Park in Salem for an afternoon remote broadcast. Around halfway through the broadcast, Prater said he wanted to test the new wireless mic by riding on the “Shooting Star” roller coaster, while live on the air.\n\nBart had faith that the wireless mic would work throughout the roller coaster ride and decided to test it out: Live on WROV, without a test run. Prater then hopped on the Shooting Star and recited the Lord’s prayer just before descending down the ride’s first drop.\n\nPrater made history that day as he successfully spoke to his WROV radio audience live, while riding on the Shooting Star Roller Coaster at Lakeside Amusement Park. Although there were a few seconds of drop out with mic coverage, Prater could be heard loud and clear throughout his historic ride. It was an event that I will never forget.\n\nMy second most memorable activity with Bart happened on the first day of spring 1975. It was sunny and warm that day in Roanoke and Prater wanted to do a remote broadcast outside of the WROV building this afternoon. The station’s studios were located on the corner of 15th St and Cleveland Avenue, along the banks of the Roanoke River.\n\nI happened to be at the station that day and Prater asked me to run the main board for a couple of hours of his afternoon DJ shift, while he did a remote broadcast outside of the WROV building. I eagerly said yes and jumped at the chance to do a remote broadcast: This time inside of the main WROV studio while Prater sat outside of the building with a wireless mic for the remote broadcast.\n\nPrater got to soak up the sun at the place he fondly called “PD Bottom” and I got to run the board inside the main studio. It was thrilling for this 19-year old teen. During my two hours running the board, I played the WROV number 1 song twice that day: “Philadelphia Freedom” by Elton John.\n\nDuring my time working at WROV, we had many famous rock artists drop by the station for promotional visits. The biggest personality to appear at our studios was Wolfman Jack.\n\nCanadian rock band the Guess Who performed at the Roanoke Civic Center in April and they were going to play their summer of 1974 hit, “Clap For the Wolfman” at this show. Joining them for this one song was legendary DJ Wolfman Jack.\n\nThe day before the Guess Who concert, “The Wolfman” came by the WROV studio to be interviewed by DJ Chuck Holloway on his evening air shift. Wolfman Jack took over the controls on the WROV board and conducted a two-hour air shift for the station that night. WROV DJs Larry Bly, Bart Prater and Chuck Holloway all were in studio when “The Wolfman” made his historic Roanoke on-air appearance.\n\nTwo other highlights happened for me at WROV during 1975:\n\nI met members of the Average White Band and jazz pianist Les McCann while working a remote broadcast at Discount Records, located at Tanglewood Mall.\n\nWhen Suzi Quatro was "
