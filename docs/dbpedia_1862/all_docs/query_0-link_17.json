For the Nick Hornby novel, see Funny Girl (novel).\n\n1964 musical based on the life of Fanny Brice\n\nFunny GirlMusicJule StyneLyricsBob MerrillBookIsobel LennartBasisThe life of Fanny BriceProductions\n\n1964 Broadway\n\n1966 West End\n\n1966 Australasian tour\n\n1996 US Tour\n\n1999 Melbourne\n\n2015 Menier Chocolate Factory\n\n2016 West End revival\n\n2016 Melbourne\n\n2017 UK Tour\n\n2022 Broadway revival\n\n2023 US Tour\n\nFunny Girl is a musical with score by Jule Styne, lyrics by Bob Merrill, and book by Isobel Lennart, that first opened on Broadway in 1964. The semi-biographical plot is based on the life and career of comedian and Broadway star Fanny Brice, featuring her stormy relationship with entrepreneur and gambler Nicky Arnstein.\n\nBarbra Streisand starred in the original Broadway musical, produced by Brice's son-in-law Ray Stark. The production received eight nominations at the 18th Tony Awards. The original cast recording of Funny Girl was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nA Broadway revival opened April 24, 2022, starring Beanie Feldstein as Brice.[1][2] Lea Michele stepped into the lead role that September, with rave reviews prompting a new Broadway cast recording two months later.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nStark married Fanny Brice's and Nicky Arnstein's daughter Frances Brice in 1940. In telling Fanny's story, Stark produced the Broadway musical, film version and film sequel Funny Lady.[3]\n\nRay Stark commissioned an authorized biography of Brice, based on taped recollections that she had dictated, but the result of which she was unhappy with. Stopping the publication of The Fabulous Fanny, as it had been titled by the author, eventually cost him $50,000. Stark then turned to Ben Hecht to write the screenplay for a biopic, but neither Hecht nor the 10 writers who succeeded him were able to produce a version that satisfied Stark. Finally, Isobel Lennart submitted My Man, which pleased both Stark and Columbia Pictures executives, who offered Stark $400,000 plus a percentage of the gross for the property.[4]\n\nAfter reading the screenplay, Mary Martin contacted Stark and proposed it be adapted for a stage musical. Stark discussed the possibility with producer David Merrick, who suggested Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim compose the score. Sondheim told Styne \"I don't want to do the life of Fanny Brice with Mary Martin. She's not Jewish. You need someone ethnic for the part.\" Shortly after, Martin lost interest in the project and withdrew.[5]\n\nMerrick discussed the project with Jerome Robbins, who gave the screenplay to Anne Bancroft. She agreed to play Brice if she could handle the score. Merrick suggested Styne collaborate with Dorothy Fields, but the composer was not interested. He went to Palm Beach, Florida for a month and composed music he thought Bancroft would be able to sing. While he was there, he met Bob Merrill, and he played the five melodies he already had written for him. Merrill agreed to write lyrics for them; these included \"Who Are You Now?\" and \"The Music That Makes Me Dance\". Styne was happy with the results and the two men completed the rest of the score, then flew to Los Angeles to play it for Stark, Robbins, and Bancroft. Bancroft was at odds with Merrill because of an earlier personal conflict, and after listening to the score, she stated \"I want no part of this. It's not for me\".[5]\n\nWith Bancroft out of the picture, Eydie Gormé was considered, but she agreed to play Brice only if her husband Steve Lawrence was cast as Nick Arnstein. Because they thought he was wrong for the role, Stark and Robbins approached Carol Burnett, who said \"I'd love to do it but what you need is a Jewish girl.\" With options running out, Styne recalled Barbra Streisand, whom he remembered from I Can Get It for You Wholesale, and thought that she would be perfect. She was performing at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village at the time; Styne urged Robbins to go see her there. He was impressed and asked her to audition. Styne later recalled, \"She looked awful ... All her clothes were out of thrift shops. I saw Fran Stark staring at her, obvious distaste on her face.\" Despite his wife's objections, Stark hired Streisand on the spot.[5]\n\nRobbins had an argument with Lennart and told Stark he wanted her replaced because he thought she was not capable of adapting her screenplay into a viable book for a stage musical. Stark refused and Robbins quit the project.[5]\n\nFunny Girl temporarily was shelved, and Styne moved on to other projects, including Fade Out – Fade In for Carol Burnett. Merrick signed Bob Fosse to direct Funny Girl, and work began on it again, until Fosse quit and the show went into limbo for several months, at which point Merrick suggested that Stark hire Garson Kanin. It was Merrick's last contribution to the production; shortly afterward he bowed out, and Stark became sole producer.[5]\n\nStreisand was not enthusiastic about Kanin as a director and insisted she wanted Robbins back, especially after Kanin suggested \"People\" be cut from the score because it didn't fit the character. Streisand already had recorded the song for a single release, and Merrill insisted, \"It has to be in the show because it's the greatest thing she's ever done.\" Based on audience reaction to it, Kanin agreed to let it remain. By the time the show opened in Boston, audiences were so familiar with \"People\" that they applauded it during the overture.[5]\n\nThere were problems with the script and score throughout rehearsals, and when Funny Girl opened at the Shubert Theatre in Boston it was too long, even after thirty minutes had been cut. The critics praised Streisand but disliked the show. Lennart continued to edit her book and deleted another thirty minutes before the show moved to Philadelphia, where critics thought the show could be a hit if the libretto problems were rectified.[5]\n\nThe New York opening was postponed five times while extra weeks were played out of town. Funny Girl played two tryout periods in Philadelphia at the Forrest and Erlanger theaters. Five songs were cut, and \"You Are Woman\", a solo for Sydney Chaplin, was rewritten as a counterpoint duet. Streisand was still unhappy with Kanin and was pleased when Robbins returned to oversee the choreography by Carol Haney.[5]\n\nKanin's novel Smash is based loosely on his experience directing Funny Girl.\n\nProductions\n\n[edit]\n\nBroadway\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter 17 previews, the Broadway production opened March 26, 1964 at the Winter Garden Theatre,[6] subsequently transferring to the Majestic Theatre[7] and The Broadway Theatre, where it closed on July 1, 1967 to complete its total run of 1,348 performances. The musical was directed by Garson Kanin and choreographed by Carol Haney under the supervision of Jerome Robbins. In addition to Streisand and Chaplin, the original cast included Kay Medford, Danny Meehan, Jean Stapleton, and Lainie Kazan, who also served as Streisand's understudy. Later in the run, Streisand and Chaplin were replaced by Mimi Hines and Johnny Desmond, and Hines' husband and comedy partner Phil Ford also joined the cast.\n\nWest End\n\n[edit]\n\nStreisand reprised her role in the West End production at the Prince of Wales Theatre directed by Lawrence Kasha, which opened April 13, 1966. When Streisand became pregnant and had to drop out of the show, her understudy Lisa Shane, wife of The Italian Job director Peter Collinson, took over, and continued to perform until the show closed.[8]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Australasian premiere season commenced March 4, 1966, at the Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney. The production starred Jill Perryman as Fanny Brice, Bruce Barry as Nick Arnstein, Evie Hayes as Mrs. Brice, and Bill Yule as Eddie Ryan.[9]\n\nIn 1999, The Production Company produced Funny Girl at the Arts Centre Melbourne, starring Caroline O'Connor and Nancye Hayes.[10] The production was revived in 2016, with O'Connor and Hayes reprising their roles.[11]\n\nA concert version was staged at the Sydney Opera House from July 12–14, 2018. The role of Fanny Brice on stage was shared by Michala Banas, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Casey Donovan, Virginia Gay, Verity Hunt-Ballard, Dami Im, Maggie McKenna, Zahra Newman, Caroline O’Connor, Queenie van de Zandt and Megan Washington. The show also starred Trevor Ashley, Nancye Hayes and Don Hany as Nick Arnstein.[12]\n\nNorth American tours\n\n[edit]\n\nThe First National Tour gave top billing to Lillian Roth as Mrs. Brice, Anthony George as Nick, with Marilyn Michaels as Fanny billed third.[citation needed]\n\nA 1996 United States National tour starred Debbie Gibson as Fanny Brice and Robert Westenberg as Nick Arnstein. The planned 30-city tour started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in October 1996, but ended prematurely in November 1996 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.[13][14][15][16][17]\n\nA 2023 United States national tour of the 2022 Broadway revival opened in Providence, Rhode Island on September 9, 2023,[18] starring Katerina McCrimmon, Stephen Mark Lukas, and Melissa Manchester.[19][20]\n\nWest End revival\n\n[edit]\n\nThe show's first ever full-scale revival began previews at the Menier Chocolate Factory on November 20, 2015, officially opening December 2 for a limited run to March 5, 2016. The production starred Sheridan Smith, with Darius Campbell as Nick, directed by Michael Mayer, with a revised book by Harvey Fierstein.[21][22] The entire run sold out within a day, making it the Menier's fastest selling show on record. Following this, the show transferred to London's Savoy Theatre on April 9, 2016, for a run through to September 10, 2016.[23] The show subsequently extended until October 8 due to phenomenal public demand.[24] However, Smith became indisposed on April 28, 2016, and the show was halted 15 minutes in. She was replaced by her understudy Natasha J Barnes,[25] who continued to play the role until Smith's eventual return on July 8.[26][27]\n\nA UK tour of the Menier production began in February 2017 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester.[28][29] After very favourable reviews, both Smith and Barnes returned to the role of Fanny Brice and alternative venues throughout the UK tour.[30]\n\nParis\n\n[edit]\n\nA Paris production opened in November 2019 at Théâtre Marigny, directed and choreographed by Stephen Mear and featuring Christina Bianco as Fanny.[31] The show received unanimous rave reviews, with significant praise for Bianco. The production was extended, doubling its initial run dates.[32]\n\nBroadway revival\n\n[edit]\n\nA revival production began Broadway previews on March 26, 2022, at the August Wilson Theatre with an official opening on April 24, 2022, starring Beanie Feldstein as Fanny Brice, directed by Michael Mayer, music directed by Michael Rafter, with a revised book by Harvey Fierstein. The production also starred Ramin Karimloo as Nick Arnstein, Jared Grimes as Eddie Ryan, and Jane Lynch as Mrs. Brice.[33] The production received mostly negative reviews from critics, though Grimes received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical.[34][35][36] On July 10, 2022, Feldstein announced that she would depart the production at the end of the month, instead of September as previously planned; the following day, the production confirmed that Lea Michele and Tovah Feldshuh would replace Feldstein and Lynch respectively from September 6, with Julie Benko as Fanny in the interim.[37][38] On August 9, 2022, Lynch announced that she would depart the production on August 14 instead of the previously planned date in September and that standby Liz McCartney would play the role of Mrs. Brice until Feldshuh began her run.[39] On March 28, 2023, Paolo Montalban and Anne L. Nathan replaced Peter Francis James and Toni DiBuono as Florenz Ziegfeld and Mrs. Strakosh, respectively.[40] From June 27 to July 16, Stephen Mark Lukas played Nick Arnstein when Karimloo went to Italy to star in The Phantom of the Opera.[41]\n\nProducers announced in March 2023 that the show would close September 3 after 599 performances.[42] The production successfully recouped its $16.5M capitalization.[43]\n\nLea Michele assuming the role of Fanny Brice parallels her Glee character storyline, where Rachel Berry lands her dream role in Broadway's (fictional) first revival of Funny Girl.[44] Michele's performance turned declining box office numbers around and received critical acclaim in the role with universally positive reviews, including many citing superior vocals compared to her predecessor.[45]\n\nOther productions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 23, 2002, a concert version for the benefit of the Actors' Fund was staged in New York City at the New Amsterdam Theatre. Performers included Carolee Carmello, Kristin Chenoweth, Sutton Foster, Ana Gasteyer, Whoopi Goldberg, Jane Krakowski, Judy Kuhn, Julia Murney, LaChanze, Ricki Lake, Andrea Martin, Idina Menzel, Bebe Neuwirth, Kaye Ballard, Alice Playten, Lillias White, Len Cariou, Jason Danieley, Peter Gallagher, Gary Beach, Brad Oscar, Richard Kind, and The Rockettes.[46][47]\n\nIn regional theatre the Paper Mill Playhouse, Millburn, New Jersey, production ran in April to May 2001 with Leslie Kritzer and Robert Cuccioli. The New York Times reviewer noted: \"What makes it all the more impressive is that few actors, or theater companies outside of summer stock, dare to attempt Jule Styne's and Bob Merrill's grand spectacle that propelled Barbra Streisand's career nearly 40 years ago.\"[48] The Westchester Broadway Theatre production ran from March to June 2009, with Jill Abramovitz as Fanny.[49] The production at Drury Lane Oakbrook ran from December 2009 to March 7, 2010. Gary Griffin was the co-director with Drury Lane artistic director William Osetek, with the cast that featured Sara Sheperd.[50]\n\nA revival directed by Bartlett Sher had been announced to premiere at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in January 2012[51] with Lauren Ambrose starring as Fanny Brice and Bobby Cannavale as Nick Arnstein,[52] and then open on Broadway in April 2012.[53] However, on November 3, 2011, producer Bob Boyett announced that this production has been postponed. He said \"We have made the extremely difficult decision today to postpone our production of Funny Girl. Given the current economic climate, many Broadway producing investors have found it impossible to maintain their standard level of financial commitment.\"[54]\n\nThe first lavish Israeli production of the musical premiered in 2016, 52 years after the original Broadway premiere. There was a controversy about the casting for the role of Fanny Brice. The role was promised for actress Tali Oren, who was a freelanced actress, but then the role was offered to Mia Dagan who was signed with Beit Lessin Theatre. Dagan, who jumped on the opportunity in the first minute, took the role and signed off the contract with Beit Lessin. The production also included Amos Tamam as Nick Arnstein.[citation needed]\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nThe musical is set in and around New York City just before and following World War I. Ziegfeld Follies star Fanny Brice, awaiting the return of her husband Nicky Arnstein from prison, reflects on their life together, and their story is told as a flashback.\n\nOriginal Broadway Version\n\n[edit]\n\nAct 1\n\nFanny is a stage-struck teen who gets her first job in vaudeville. Her mother and her mother’s friend Mrs. Strakosh try to dissuade her from show business because Fanny is not the typical beauty (\"If a Girl Isn't Pretty\"). But Fanny perseveres (\"I'm the Greatest Star\") and is helped and encouraged by Eddie Ryan, a dancer she meets in the vaudeville shows. Once Fanny's career takes off, Eddie and Mrs. Brice lament that once she's on Broadway she'll forget about them (\"Who Taught Her Everything?\"). Fanny performs a supposedly romantic number in the Follies, but she turns it into a classic comic routine, ending the number as a pregnant bride (\"His Love Makes Me Beautiful\"), causing an uproar.\n\nShe meets the sophisticated and handsome Nicky Arnstein, who accompanies Fanny to her mother's opening night party on \"Henry Street\". Fanny is clearly falling in love with Nick, while acknowledging their complex vulnerabilities (\"People\"). Later they meet in Baltimore and have a private dinner at a swanky restaurant and declare their feelings (\"You Are Woman, I Am Man\"). Fanny is determined to marry Nick, regardless of his gambling past (\"Don't Rain on My Parade\").\n\nAct 2\n\nThe two marry, move to a mansion on Long Island, and have a daughter, Frances (\"Sadie, Sadie\"). In the meantime, Mrs. Strakosh and Eddie suggest to Mrs. Brice that she should find a man to marry, now that her daughter is supporting her (\"Find Yourself a Man\"). Fanny has become a major star with the Ziegfeld Follies (\"Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat\"). Nick asks Ziegfeld to invest in a gambling casino, but although Ziegfeld passes, Fanny insists on investing. When the venture fails and they lose their money, Fanny tries to make light of it, which propels Nick to get involved in a shady bond deal, resulting in his arrest for embezzlement. Fanny feels helpless but stronger than ever in her love for him (\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\").\n\nIn the present, Fanny is waiting for Nick to arrive and has time to reflect on her situation. Nick arrives, newly released from prison, and he and Fanny decide to separate. She is heartbroken, but resolves to pick up her life again (\"Don't Rain on My Parade (Reprise)\").\n\n2022 Broadway Revival\n\n[edit]\n\nAct 1\n\nIn the present, Fanny Brice sits in her dressing room whilst preparing to star in the Ziegfeld Follies, awaiting news to hear if her husband, Nicky Arnstein, has been freed from prison and reminiscing on her earlier life (\"Who Are You Now?\") In the past, Fanny is a stage-struck teen, though her mother and her mother’s friends Mrs. Strakosh and Mrs. Meeker try to dissuade her from show business because Fanny is not the typical beauty (\"If a Girl Isn't Pretty\"). This is proved true when at her first vaudeville job as a chorus dancer, she is fired by the theater's owner, Tom Keeney. She confides to her friend Eddie Ryan, who got her the job, that she knows she will succeed (\"I'm the Greatest Star\"). Later, rehearsing with Eddie to re-audition for Keeney, Mrs. Brice echos Fanny's point (\"I'm the Greatest Star (Reprise)\") and Fanny revolves to audition again for Keeney. After \"Eddie's Tap,\" Fanny nervously performs her first number \"Cornet Man,\" though eventually, she wins over the audience and the attention of handsome gambler, Nicky Arnstein, who is able to wager Keeney a higher pay for Fanny and gives her his card.\n\nA year later, Fanny receives a telegram from Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. asking her to meet him at his theater, which Fanny proposes is connected to her interaction with Nick. At the theater, Fanny argues with Ziegfeld over his song choice for her but is forced to perform the song. However, she turns the supposedly romantic number, \"His Love Makes Me Beautiful,\" into a comedy in which she portrays a pregnant bride. Backstage, Fanny's family and friends are thrilled but Ziegfeld reprimands her to which she apologizes, though he admits he found the act funny. Nick appears backstage, congratulating Fanny on her performance, and escorts her home (\"I Wanna Be Seen With You Tonight\") where her mother and close friends have thrown her a party, celebrating her success (\"Henry Street\"). Later in the evening, Fanny opens up to Nick about her desire to find love (\"People\"), and Nick admits that he would initiate a relationship between them, but acknowledges that he is leaving New York the next day.\n\nSometime later, Fanny is touring with the follies and she and Nick both find themselves in Baltimore. Nick brings her to dinner at a fancy establishment, where she panics in response to his somewhat rapid advances, though she eventually gives in (\"You Are Woman, I Am Man\"). Later, the follies company is preparing to leave Cleveland and Fanny and Nick appear arm in arm. However, he tells her he will not be following the company, as he has to win back his money in Monte Carlo. He tells her he loves her but when she asks him to marry her, he insists that they cannot wed until he is rich again. In a last minute decision, she decides that she needs to follow him in pursuit of marriage, no matter what it means for her career (\"Don't Rain on my Parade\").\n\nAct 2\n\nFanny surprises Nick in Monte Carlo (\"Entr'acte\"/\"Don't Rain on my Parade (Reprise)\"). He tells her that he has won back his wealth and the two are married and move to a mansion on Long Island, with Fanny soon revealing that she is pregnant (\"Sadie, Sadie\"). Back on Henry Street (\"Sadie, Sadie (Playoff)\"), Mrs. Brice and Eddie lament that Fanny no longer needs them (\"Who Taught Her Everything She Knows?\"). A few months later, as Fanny prepares to go back to rehearsals for a new show, Nick abruptly tells her that he is heading to Philadelphia to find investors for a casino he's building in Miami. Fanny reacts badly, nervous about leaving their daughter, Frances, for a whole day, though Nick promises that he will only be gone for a day, but in the end, she convinces him to stay and she is welcomed back to the theater (\"You Are Woman (Reprise)\"/\"Henry Street (Reprise)\"). Nick follows her to the theater and attempts to convince Ziegfeld to invest in his project, but Ziegfeld dismisses him. In response, Fanny decides to invest $68,000 of her money into Nick's project. Over the next few days, Nick travels to Florida and enters in a series of business deals with Fanny's money (\"Temporary Arrangement\").\n\nOn Fanny's opening night for her new show, she anxiously waits Nick's arrival, who is still traveling, telling Eddie that this would be the first opening night of hers he has missed. After her performance (\"Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat\"), Fanny's mother comforts her before Nick appears in her dressing room, revealing that a hurricane in Florida has destroyed the casino and lost them their money. She assures him that they will rebuild their success and that the most important thing to her is him (\"Who Are You Now? (Reprise)\"/\"People (Reprise)\"). The following year, Nick is involved in a business proposal to become a partner at a talent agency without putting up any money, though he sees through the act and realizes that Fanny has put up the money on their behalf. Nick reacts badly, insisting that he does not need her help to succeed and calls about a mob deal he was informed about, agreeing to join the deal in exchange for $68,000 (\"You're a Funny Girl/Beekman Call\"). Back at the follies, Fanny prepares a new routine (\"What Do Happy People Do?\"), but her mother arrives to inform her that Nick has been arrested for embezzlement. When Fanny insists that Nick couldn't have known the deal was faulty, her mother calls her out for making him feel unimportant in her life. Alone, Fanny reflects on how important he is to her (\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\").\n\nFlashing back to the present, (\"Dream Ballet\"), three years after the arrest, Fanny and Eddie share one last tender moment as Nick appears in the doorway. She insists that she's willing to change to make their relationship better but he abruptly asks her for a divorce. She is taken aback but thanks him for making her feel \"almost, sorta...beautiful.\" He assures her that she is beautiful, then leaves.
