        "text": "Broadcast From:\n\nApril 26-June 29, 2011\n\nJudges:\n\nAdam Levine\n\nBlake Shelton\n\nCee Lo Green\n\nChristina Aguilera\n\nHost(s):\n\nCarson Daly\n\nAlison Haislip (Social Media Correspondent)\n\nBroadcaster:\n\nNBC\n\nWinner:\n\nJavier Colon\n\nThe Voice is an American reality talent show. The series is part of The Voice franchise and is based on a similar competition format in the Netherlands, The Voice of Holland. The show is hosted by Carson Daly, with Alison Haislip serving as the backstage and social networking correspondent. The winner receives $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Republic Records. Christina Aguilera, Cee Lo Green, Maroon 5 lead vocalist Adam Levine and Blake Shelton are the coaches. Each team of singers are mentored and developed by their coach. In the second stage, coaches have two of their team members battle against each other by singing the same song, with the coach choosing which team member to advance. In the final phase, the remaining contestants compete against each other in live broadcasts. The television audience helps to decide who advances. When one remains for each coach, the four contestants compete against each other in the finale.\n\nThe American series premiered on April 26, 2011 on the NBC television network. The winner of the first season was Javier Colon, mentored by coach Adam Levine, the finale airing on June 29, 2011. It immediately proved to be a hit for NBC and the network renewed the show for a second season.\n\nOverview\n\nThe series consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase and live performance shows. Four coaches, all famous musicians, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each coach has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute) to decide if he or she wants that singer on his or her team; if two or more coaches want the same singer (as happened with all but one singer in the premiere episode), then the singer gets to choose their coach. In the finale 32 (live shows), Aguilera, Green, Levine and Shelton were joined by Sia Furler, Monica, music producer Adam Blackstone and Reba McEntire.\n\nAuditions\n\nContestants auditions were held in eight cities across the United States between mid-January and mid-February 2011: Chicago, New York, Miami, Nashville, Minneapolis, Austin, Los Angeles and Seattle. Contestants were also allowed to submit an online application, which ended on March 1, 2011. For the online auditions, contestants were required to sing one of ten pre-selected songs. Contestants on The Voice as revealed by airing of promotional advertisement or shows were Javier Colon, Frenchie Davis, Nakia, Lukas Rossi, Cherie Oakley and Dia Frampton.\n\nCoaches, Host and Social Media Correspondent\n\nIn late February 2011, NBC began announcements of the coaches for the series. First to sign on were Cee Lo Green and Adam Levine (frontman for Maroon 5). Christina Aguilera came on board in early March 2011. Blake Shelton was added as the final coach on March 7, 2011.\n\nCarson Daly was announced as the show's first host. Alison Haislip was announced as the show's \"backstage online and social media correspondent\" during the live shows.\n\nTeams\n\nColour Key:\n\nGold: Winner\n\nSilver: Runner-up\n\nBronze: 3rd/4th Place\n\nBlue: Eliminated in the Live Shows.\n\nPink: Eliminated in the Battles.\n\nCoaches Top 32 Artists Adam Levine Javier Colon Casey Weston Devon Barley Jeff Jenkins Angela Wolff Tim Mahoney Rebecca Loebe Casey Desmond Cee Lo Green Vicci Martinez Nakia Curtis Grimes The Thompson Sisters Niki Dawson Tje Austin Emily Valentine Kelsey Rey Christina Aguilera Beverly McClellan Frenchie Davis Raquel Castro Lily Elise Justin Grennan Tarralyn Ramsey Julia Eason Cherie Oakley Blake Shelton Dia Frampton Xenia Jared Blake Patrick Thomas Serabee Sara Oromchi Elenowen Tyler Robinson\n\nBlind Auditions\n\nColour Key:\n\n✔: Coach hit his/her \"I WANT YOU\" button.\n\nPink: Artist defaulted to this coach's team.\n\nBlue: Artist elected to join this coach's team.\n\nSilver: Artist eliminated with no coach pressing his/her \"I WANT YOU\" button.\n\nEpisode 1 (April 26, 2011)\n\nThe first of two Blind Auditions taped episodes was broadcast on April 26, 2011.

The tour featured the top two finalists from each team, including Javier Colon, Dia Frampton, Vicci Martinez, Beverly McClellan, Xenia, Frenchie Davis, Nakia and Casey Weston. Out of the six dates, the New York show was a sell-out. However, as overall ticket sales were lackluster, the tour was cancelled in subsequent seasons.

The series debut garnered 11.775 million viewers from 9 to 11pm. It peaked at 10:45pm with 13.398 million viewers (live+SD).\n\nRolling Stone's Mallika Rao said of the show's premiere episode, \"Could this concept be the best Dutch import since tulips and Eddie Van Halen?\" Despite a high viewership in its debut, the show has received mixed reviews on Metacritic, which holds at a 58."
