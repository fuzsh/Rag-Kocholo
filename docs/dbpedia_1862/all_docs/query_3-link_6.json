        "text": "Some of our favorite bands are up for awards in this year's Boston Music Awards. Bad Rabbits, the Wandas, Casey Desmond, Kingsley Flood, Gentleman Hall, Mean Creek and more. You may or may not agree, but either way support local music. So head over to BostonMusicAwards2011.com now and vote for your favorites. Here is the history from their website:\n\nNow entering it’s 24th year, the event itself is less of a traditional awards show and more of rolling party with multiple stages and extended sets from nominated artists.\n\nThis year’s event will once again be held at The Liberty Hotel in Boston on November 20th. We are ecstatic about this year’s lineup. Once again, the BMAs will feature some of the region’s most compelling emerging and established talent from Garage to Rock to Pop to Blues’Metal, Punk, Indie, Americana, International, Jazz, Hip Hop, RNB, Electronic, Folk’and everything in between. The party will roll! We look forward to seeing you there and celebrating the collective accomplishments of our unique and immensely talented music scene.\n\nWho is eligible for aBoston Music Award?\n\nA musician, producer or industry professional who has strong ties to New England. We define strong ties as someone who is a New England native or has lived here for a substantial period of time who has actively worked or is actively working here. (John Mayer who went to Berklee for one year does not qualify). The timeframe for consideration for this year’s awards is November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011.\n\nWhat is the Mission of theBoston Music Awards?\n\nTo bring together the music community of New England to honor its best and brightest performers while raising money for music charities to ensure our stages and studios are filled with talent for years to come. The event is the one time of year that the entire community can come together and celebrate our own. We also strive to generate regional and national exposure for nominated and winning artists.\n\nWhere does the money go?\n\nSince 2003, any proceeds from the event have gone to various music charities throughout New England. We have funded scholarships to Berklee, music education programs in schools, etc. Recently, we aligned with Music Drives Us, a non-profit that provides funding for music education programs. For the past few years the money to put on the BMAs and fund our charitable efforts has been raised exclusively through sponsorship and partnerships.\n\nHow are thenominees chosen?\n\nLast year, we revamped our nominating and voting \"Academy\" to include over 150 active participants in all genres of the music community in New England. The Academy includes venue owners, booking agents, managers, writers/bloggers, DJs, program directors, music business owners, distributors, retailers, producers, publicists and others. We will continue to try to update and expand this list to ensure that it is truly representative of people who have their finger on the pulse of ALL music genres in Boston. The BMA office gets nomination requests throughout the year, which we pass on to the nominating committee. Nominees can be viewed and voted for at www.bostonmusicawards2011.com/vote.\n\nWho votes for the winners?\n\nOnce the ballot is created, the Academy votes for the winners. The Academy vote counts for 2/3, while the online public vote counts 1/3."
