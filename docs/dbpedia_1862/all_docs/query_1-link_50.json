        "text": "How do we detach shame from our desires? How can we live in the discomfort of hiding our longing? Only Child, the musical project of songwriter Christopher James Martin, asks and seeks to answer those questions on debut EP Srs One, set for May 2023 release through producer Casey Desmond’s Jungle Up Records. The EP is led by the bouncing electro-pop single “Don’t Call Me BB”, a campy kiss off anthem with a chorus that’s impossible to forget, and sassy synth-pop follow-up “Defeater.” Try to resist the temptation to send either to your ex. They’re just not worth your time.\n\nInspired by queer-fronted pop acts Tegan and Sara, Erasure, Shamir, and Christine and the Queens, Only Child combines ambient instrumentation with vocal hooks to craft sweet and sour pop songs. “‘Don’t Call Me BB’ started with a straightforward beat I learned at summer camp, an otherwise miserable experience for me,” says Martin. “It was one of the first times I thought about music in an obsessive way, which was the beginning of my relationship with songwriting.”\n\nAfter singing about the nuances of modern relationships in Boston band All Eyes on Me, Only Child is forging a new path ahead, glazed in beats and treats with personal compositions written from the heart. From collaborating with Boston’s synth-pop queen Casey Desmond to assembling his own “butch band” for the “Don’t Call Me BB” music video, Only Child is both personal and collaborative. But it’s purely Only Child. “I want there to be a space for my songs that was more lighthearted, more upbeat, even if they might be lyrically similar to the songs I wrote for All Eyes on Me,” Martin adds.\n\nWith Srs One, Only Child is making that space on his own terms.\n\nHow did the band form and what does the band name mean?\n\nChristopher James Martin: Only Child started as a way for me to release songs on my own and play shows without having to necessarily consult with a band about every decision, which can take a lot of time and require a lot of compromise on everyone’s behalf. That being said, I truly love all my bandmates and consult them often about creative and style decisions even when they are from my solo releases. I started writing under a different name but the name Only Child soon found me and seemed like It was a better fit. I am an only child and it seems to be something that people always have a reaction to or an opinion about. The name seemed simple, honest, and straightforward while also being evocative.\n\nPrevious musical projects? How’d you first get into music?\n\nI was a late bloomer, and realized somewhat later in life I wanted to learn how to play music. I had many friends in bands and was always jealous of them and curious about the creative process. I got a guitar for my 19th birthday and quickly went about teaching myself how to play. From the get go I started writing my own songs and really took to it. During my college years I would cobble together lyrics and notebooks and slowly piece together what would become my first songs. In 2007 I got a MacBook and started to record myself. I released a lot of those early songs in a band I formed with my best friend Susannah called All Eyes On Me. We got together with our other bandmate Mary Lee Desmond in the early 2010s and released some music and played lots of shows in and around Boston and New England for the better part of the 2010s.\n\nFirst concert that you ever went to?\n\nThe FIRST concert I ever went to was The White Stripes at the Orpheum in 2003. Other than that, I grew up going to see my good friend and collaborator Casey Desmond play shows at her venue The Magic Room and all around the city.\n\nWhat’s your writing process like?\n\nEvery song is slightly different; sometimes I start with a riff or some chords on the guitar that sticks with me. I usually need to play that over and over for a long time, like a few months, before I can come up with some type of melody to sing on top of it. Other times, I start right away in my DAW putting together drums, synths, and vocal loops until a song forms. Every so often that process can be accelerated and I will write the majority of the song in one sitting. Weirdly enough, those tend to be my favorite tunes! Lyrics tend to be the last thing I finish after a lot of editing to make sure what I want to say is coming out clearly.\n\n5. What other artists or songs inspire your music?\n\nUsually the songs that inspire me are ones that have a mysterious combination of organic and electronic instrumentation, lots of hooks, and clever lyrics or wordplay. I think the best pop songs are about longing, or unrequited love, and those are also a major part of the queer experience. Tegan and Sara are my first inspirations and kickstarted my love for songwriting. I chose the song ‘Boyfriend’ from their 2018 album Love You To Death. “Boyfriend” to me is a perfect example of queering the narrative and adding a flair for melodrama to your narrative. Learning about them also gave me an urge to research other queer artists. My song “Srs One” is very sonically inspired by the song “A Little Respect” by Erasure. The way the catchiest part of the song occurs as a pre-chorus and gives way to a sense of relief in the chorus felt like a revelation to me the first time I heard it. I named the genre of music I make as “Camp Pop” and I feel like all these songs are all giving that vibe.\n\nWhat’s the live experience like and your philosophy on playing live? Do you think the music live should be identical to the recorded version or should it be it’s own thing?\n\nI do think a live version should be a different experience from the recorded version. I think if you worry too much about what a song will sound like live when you are writing or recording it can hinder the creative process and limit what you can accomplish. What I love about playing with Only Child is subverting expectations. I play solo but use tracks to fill out my sound, which I think makes me a unique performer. When I load in by myself, I think a lot of people expect to hear something quiet and confessional, then are surprised by a fuller pop performance. The tracks make it harder to differentiate too much from the original structure of the song, but I try to find moments of improvisation within them.\n\nHas the band toured? What has the touring experience been, best shows? worst shows?\n\nOnly Child is a newer project that has started mostly in the pandemic, so I’m focusing more on releasing music and getting my name out there. Please book me on your Summer Tour though! My other band toured around New England. The best thing I like about playing shows in new places for unfamiliar faces is the chance to win over someone or find like-minded people and new listeners. I can’t think of any ‘worst’ shows off the top of my head but I feel like any show with subpar sound or technical difficulties really stresses me out, especially when I’m relying on the tracks to fill out my sound.\n\nWhat’s up next for the band?\n\nMy EP comes out May 26. I’m playing the Acton Pride Festival on June 17, which I’m looking forward to. Then a show at the Jungle on July 8. I’m going to be working on my first LP over the summer. Also I’m playing the Hope Fest in Salem in September, which I’m super excited for! Thanks for the questions!"
