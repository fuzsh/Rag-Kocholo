        "text": "Written for the sesquicentennial of the St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in November 2019 by Patrick O’Connor who kindly allowed us to share it here.\n\nYesterday, Today, and Tomorrow\n\nIn the year of our Lord, 2019, one hundred and fifty years after the building of our church, we give thanks to Almighty God for His Providential Care and for the gifts which he has showered so graciously upon the parish of St. Thomas Aquinas. Holy, Holy, Holy is His Name.\n\nWhen our parish was founded in 1869, Jamaica Plain was a lovely pastoral village, called the ‘Eden of America.’ This area of Boston between Dedham and Roxbury was a beautiful rolling countryside, with magnificent estates, fruit orchards, and gardens. Jamaica Plain with its quiet pond was the summer residence of government officials, professional and literary celebrities, and successful businessmen. Many people from Europe who came to Boston settled in this area to work and live.\n\nIn those days many newcomers from the Emerald Isle found ready employment in domestic service in Jamaica Plain. Some with their love of the soil became gardeners, while others became workers on the estates, horse trainers, coachmen, and so forth. There was no Catholic church in the vicinity, so Catholics who wished to attend Mass had to walk or ride on horseback or take some horse-drawn vehicle to the nearest church about five miles away-St. Joseph Church at Tommy’s Rock in Roxbury. Today, many of us who drive cars to go a few blocks might consider such a trip extraordinary. In those days, however, Catholics made the trip as a matter of course to receive the ministrations of their church.\n\nBy 1867, Catholics in Jamaica Plain were numerous enough to attract the attention of the Diocese of Boston and the Most Rev. John J. Williams. He asked Rev. Patrick O’Bierne, founding pastor of St. Joseph Parish in Roxbury in 1845 to investigate where to build a new church. On June 18, 1867, Fr. O’Bierne purchased land on South Street from a generous Protestant landowner, Abner Child who lived adjacent at 65 South Street.\n\nFather Magennis was born in Lowell on March 7, 1843, the feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas and the son of Thomas and Mary Magennis. Both were immigrants from Ireland and raised a family of four. He had a younger brother a priest, Rev. Charles B. Magennis who died young at the age of 25 in 1867. The family moved to Worcester in his youth. He attended Holy Cross in Worcester. He prepared for the priesthood at the Grand Seminary in Montreal and was ordained there on December 22, 1866 by Bishop Bourget. Returning home to Boston in January, 1867, he was assigned to St. Joseph Parish in Roxbury.\n\nYoung and energetic, Fr. O’Bierne requested Fr. Magennis take charge of the new parish. His appointment as founding pastor took effect on January 4, 1869. St. Thomas was his patron saint and in accordance with his wish, the new parish was named St. Thomas Aquinas. The arrival of Father Magennis brought great joy to the Catholics in this area. His new parishioners, in a new land, had little to offer their pastor other than devotion, energy, love, and loyalty.\n\nFather Magennis promptly set up his modest home at 793 Centre Street, next door to the First Congregational Church and opposite Greenough Avenue. With his zeal and warm, out-going personality, the young priest soon won many friends. The task of a founding priest is not an easy one. Not only must he become acquainted with his new parishioners and evoke their aid, he must also find a suitable location for his church, choose an architect, raise the needed funds, and so forth.\n\nEarly Aid\n\nHappily, the spirit of good will was awake in Jamaica Plain and many non-Catholics helped Father Magennis to establish his parish. Indeed, the spirit of Ecumenism 150 years ago in our parish was a providential forecast of the Ecumenism which our church encourages and fosters today.\n\nFather Magennis celebrated the first Masses in our parish in his home on Centre Street. But his neighbor, the Rev. C. H. Doyle, Minister of the First Congregational Church, offered Fr. Magennis the use of his church. Soon the selectmen gave their approval for the use of the Town Hall, later known as Curtis Hall, as a temporary location for the celebration of the first public Masses.\n\nAnother non-Catholic, Mr. Abner Child, a wealthy gentleman whose home was near, and whose land extended along St. Joseph Street, befriended Fr. Magennis in many ways. Mr. Child sold some of his property to the Diocese of Boston as a site for the new church. His interest in the progress of St. Thomas Aquinas Parish continued while he lived, and at his death, he bequeathed a generous amount of money for the poor of the parish. In the vestibule of the upper church, inside the main door, there is a small plaque in memory of the goodness and generosity of Mr. Abner Child. It reads “In memory of Abner Child, an honest, faithful and useful man.”\n\nSubsequently when the need for a convent became apparent, a five-room house on Harris Ave, owned by a prominent citizen, Dr. Winkler, was acquired and moved to St. Joseph Street. The stone needed for the foundation was donated by another generous non-Catholic, Mr. Scott, who refused to accept the money offered him by the young pastor. Thus the list of early non-Catholic benefactors is long and Fr. Magennis, throughout his long years as our pastor, was helped by such men as Nelson Curtis, Abner Child, Andrew J. Peters, Fr. Faulkner, Robert Keddie, George Bowditch, Moses Williams, George Harrish, Charles Rogers and Thomas Evans. The respect and admiration which these men felt for Fr. Magennis was expressed in a very practical fashion when they elected him as a member of the School Board.\n\nThe construction of St. Thomas Aquinas Church was begun in 1869. Architect was Patrick C. Keely. A native of Kilkenny, Ireland where he was born on August 9, 1816, he emigrated to the Unites States in 1842 and quickly went on to a brilliant career designing churches throughout the nation. According to one legend, a group of loyal parishioners appeared at the invitation of Fr. Magennis, “Come out,” said the young pastor, “and help dig the foundation of your church.” The resulting excavation was the locale of the first church fair. By the end of 1869, the church basement was ready for use.\n\nThe new church\n\nOn Sunday, August 17, 1873, five years later, the present church was completed and dedicated with Archbishop Williams presiding. The dedicatory sermon was preached by the Most Rev. P. T. O’Reilly, visiting from Springfield.\n\nAt this time the neighboring parishes close to St. Thomas Aquinas were St. Joseph, Roxbury (1845); St. Francis de Sales, Roxbury (1867); Mission Church, Roxbury (1871); St. John the Evangelist, Canton (1861); and St. Mary, Dedham (1866). Fr. Magennis built his first rectory on Jamaica Street in what is now the convent yard. Later it was moved to its present location on South Street where it is still in use.\n\nWith his election to the School Board, Fr. Magennis became acutely aware of the need for Catholic education in his parish. Without delay he started a Sunday School in the basement of his church. In October, 1873, he visited the Sisters of St. Joseph in Brooklyn, New York, to invite them to teach in our parish. When he returned home, Fr. Magennis was accompanied by four nuns of the Order: Sister Mary Regis, Sister Clare, Sister Dolores, and Sister Fidelis.\n\nThe New Convent\n\nThese four Sisters founded the Motherhouse of the St. Joseph Order in their first residence, five-room house owned by Dr. Winkler. The building which was on Harris Avenue was moved to St. Joseph Street. (The rectory garage is now situated on this site.) Later, the convent was moved again to another site across the street.\n\nWithin a few days of their arrival, the Sisters instituted classes in the basement of the church. There were three grades with an enrollment of 200 girls. In 1877, the school admitted boys to its classes becoming the first parochial school of this kind in New England, offering to boys and girls an opportunity for Catholic education through all grades.\n\nThe First School Building\n\nOn Sunday, July 22, 1888, amid heavy rain falling, the laying of the cornerstone of the school took place. The Most Rev. Matthew Harkins, Bishop of Providence, RI presided in place of Archbishop Williams. The building was completed by September, 1889 at a cost of $30,000 on Jamaica Street. Archbishop Williams, in the presence of invited clergy and religious blessed the school on August 31, 1890 at an afternoon ceremony. There were eight rooms, a lower hall with meeting and social rooms, a large assembly hall on the top floor and a bell tower. The bell in the tower was a personal gift of Pope Leo XIII, after whom the school was named. Affectionately called “The Voice of Leo,” the bell rang the Angelus for many years. It was finally kept in sacred silence when it showed signs of age, but it is interesting to note that its last sounds were heard on November 11, 1918, when rejoicing children from the neighborhood climbed the tower and banged it with sticks to announce the signing of the Armistice that ended World War 1. In 1919, the original school was enlarged. The upper hall and bell tower were torn down and at that time, the new school was renamed St. Thomas Aquinas School.\n\nFr. Magennis’s keen interest in education did not stop with the building of his parish school. He was indeed far ahead of his time in promoting education for the handicapped. In 1899 he opened a school for deaf-mutes in Boston, using the old convent building of our parish. Five years later, this school moved to the town of Randolph. In 1905, one year later, the State of Massachusetts subsidized this school for deaf-mutes with the proviso that any child sent by the state should be admitted regardless of creed or nationality.\n\nThe pioneer work achieved by Fr. Magennis in the field of education was recognized and honored. In December, 1907, at a reception observing the 40th anniversary of his ordination, Rev. Dr. Shanahan, Professor of Dogmatic Theology at Catholic University and a former student in St. Thomas Aquinas School spoke of Fr. Magennis as follows: “Msgr. Magennis was a champion of Catholic Education in an era when the idea was unpopular. He helped to lead and shape public opinion in the parish school movement; appearing on one occasion before the State Legislature in defense of parental rights. He had the courage of his convictions and acted upon them, trusting to his people for the financial support needed to promote the spiritual welfare of their children; nor was his confidence in his people misplaced.”\n\nMissionary Churches\n\nEver mindful of the welfare of his parishioners and realizing the magnitude of his parish, Fr. Magennis began to erect chapels at strategic points and to encourage the formation of new parishes within his administrative domain.\n\nOn Nov. 23, 1869, Fr. Magennis purchased land on Baker Street in West Roxbury on which he built a small wooden church, dedicated on October 29, 1871. On December 15, 1874, it burned down. On a new lot on Spring Street, he built a second edifice, a school-chapel and dedicated on October 17, 1875. This became an independent parish named St. Theresa of Avila on January 1, 1896 under the pastorate of Rev. Patrick F. Boyle. In May, 1892, the Redemptorist Fathers erected a combination school-chapel in the Hyde Square section of Jamaica Plain. On June 7, 1892, the Blessed Sacrament Parish was established with the appointment of the founding pastor, Rev. Arthur T. Connolly. On July 7, 1893, Fr. John F. Cummins, a curate in Jamaica Plain in the early years of the parish was transferred from the pastorate of St. John the Evangelist Parish in Hopkinton to become founding pastor of Sacred Heart Parish in Roslindale.\n\nIn 1896, he erected a chapel on Brookside Street near Egleston Square. Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel was dedicated on Sunday, August 23, 1896. In July, 1908, an independent parish was established here under the pastorate of Rev. George Lyons.\n\nOther Events in the pastorate\n\nFr. Magennis enjoyed traveling. Toward the end of 1889, he undertook an eight month tour of Europe and the Holy Land with three priests (Rev. John J. McNulty, Rev. Michael J. Flatley, and Rev. Richard Neagle). Returning home, he was welcomed back with a reception on Sunday evening, May 25, 1890. In the spring of 1896, he toured Europe to improve his health. While in Rome, he was named a monsignor by Pope Leo XIII. He was welcomed home at a reception in Curtis Hall on May 10, 1896. On Saturday, May 8, 1897, he departed for Naples with Archbishop Williams, from NY on the Kaiser William making his ad limina visit to the Pope. He returned on July 22, 1897. He celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his ordination with a Mass of Thanksgiving on Christmas Day, December 25, 1891. The parish turned twenty five in 1894.\n\nOn Sunday, October 2, 1898, Mass was celebrated in honor of three events: the silver jubilee of the Sisters of St. Joseph in the parish; the dedication of a school for deaf mutes on the parish property; and the investiture of Msgr. Magennis in the robes of a monsignor with Archbishop Williams attending. He noted the 40th anniversary of his ordination on December 22, 1906. A celebration in his honor took place on Thursday, March 7, 1907 at Curtis Hall. The date was the patronal feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas and his 64th birthday. Other Masses and receptions followed over the weekend with children enrolled at the school and alumni and the Sisters of St. Joseph attending.\n\nAt a reception held for him he said with profound emotion:\n\nIt is obvious that I am among friends. I have been greatly blessed with the esteem, loyalty and love of my parishioners. This reception tonight is not so much an honor to me as an honor to the memory of all the men and women who helped me so greatly in my early struggles to build St. Thomas Aquinas Parish. Without their support nothing could have been accomplished.\n\nMsgr. Magennis died on February 23, 1912 at the rectory. He was 68 and ended a pastorate of forty four years. He was deeply mourned, not only by the parish but by the city. His funeral Mass took place on Monday, February 26 with Cardinal O’Connell attending. The eulogy was pronounced by Rev. George A. Lyons, pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish. In a touching tribute, a squad of boys from the School for the Deaf in Randolph (founded by Msgr. Magennis) formed an honor guard as the remains were carried from the church. He was laid to rest at Calvary Cemetery in the Roslindale section of Boston.\n\nEight years later, his sister with whom he had a close relationship died on September 29, 1920. She was 75 years old and a retired teacher. Her funeral Mass took place at St. Thomas Aquinas Church on Saturday, October 1. She was laid to rest with the monsignor at Calvary Cemetery.\n\nOur Second Pastor, Msgr. Moriarty, 1912-1928\n\nMsgr. Edward J. Moriarty was born in East Boston on May 28, 1856, the son of James and Catherine Moriarty. Both were immigrants from Ireland and raised a family of six. He attended English High School in Boston, class of 1873 and St. Laurent College in Montreal. He prepared for the priesthood at St. Joseph Seminary in Troy, New York. He was ordained there on December 18, 1881 by Bishop McNeirney.\n\nHis first assignment was to St. Bernard Parish in Concord. During his years in Concord, he had charge of the Concord Reformatory as chaplain (1881-1883). He then transferred to St. Joseph Parish in the West End and served as chaplain at the state prison in Charlestown (1883-1895). In 1895, he was appointed pastor of St. Bernard Parish in Concord. In May, 1903, he transferred to the pastorate of St. Peter Parish in Cambridge. During his time in Cambridge, he was named a monsignor on April 6, 1909.\n\nHis appointment to Jamaica Plain took effect in May, 1912. Seeing the need for improvements to the church, he set about to plan a major overhaul of the church both inside and outside. The main entrance was redesigned with a recessed main door and two octagonal tourelles over the façade window. Inside, the windows along the nave were raised higher with a gothic appearance. Cardinal O’Connell, in the presence of many priests and parishioners rededicated the church on Sunday, November 1, 1914.\n\nTwo other parishes came about during his pastorate. In August, 1918, St. Andrew the Apostle Parish in the Forest Hill section took territory away from St. Thomas Aquinas parish. In July, 1927, Holy Name Parish in the West Roxbury-Roslindale area was established under the pastorate of another former curate, Rev. William P. McNamara. In December, 1921, he noted the 40th anniversary of his ordination.\n\nAnother major project of Msgr. Moriarty was erecting a high school. The new St. Thomas Aquinas High School was dedicated on Sunday, September 11, 1927. The following Tuesday, the school welcomed a freshman class of 100 boys and girls. The Sisters of St. Joseph had charge of the girls. Graduates of the Boston College School of Education had charge of the boys. The architectural beauty of the school, its modern equipment, its advanced curriculum and its competent teaching staff made it one of the best schools in the Archdiocese. One of the innovations of the time was the use of ramps instead of stairways.\n\nDeclining in health, Msgr. Moriarty died on August 30, 1928 at his summer home in the Point-of-Pines section of Revere. He was 72. Cardinal O’Connell presided at his funeral Mass on Monday, September 3. The eulogy was pronounced by Rev. Louis F. Kelleher. He was laid to rest at Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden.\n\nMsgr. Ambrose F. Roche, 1928-1935\n\nMsgr. Roche was born in Wincona, Minnesota on October 8, 1854, the son of Nicholas E. and Ellen Roche. The family moved East. He had a brother, James. He attended Chelsea schools and St. Bonaventure College in Alleghany, NY. He prepared for the priesthood at St. Joseph Seminary in Troy, NY. He was ordained on December 18, 1880 by Bishop McNeirney.\n\nHis first assignment as parochial vicar was to St. John the Baptist Parish in Quincy (1881-1896). During his time at St. John’s, he was editor of the Quincy Monitor, a literary magazine sponsored by the St. John Catholic and Literary and Athletic Association. He was also a member of the Quincy school board. In June, 1896, he was appointed pastor of St. Paul Parish in Hingham. He had charge of missions in Hull and Nantasket. He bid farewell to Hingham on Christmas Eve, 1899. On December 31, 1899, he took charge of the pastorate of the new St. Mary Parish in West Quincy, previously a mission of St. John the Baptist Parish in Quincy. A major event in his pastorate was beginning the construction of a new St. Mary Church. Archbishop Williams took part in the laying of the cornerstone of the lower church on Sunday, September 23, 1900. The church was opened at Christmas, 1900. In July, 1908, he was appointed pastor of St. Patrick Parish in Watertown. There, he founded a highly successful commercial school. During the consistory in Rome in November, 1911 in which Cardinal O’Connell received the red hat, he was named a monsignor. On November 7, 1928, he was appointed the third pastor of St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in Jamaica Plain. He celebrated his golden jubilee on Sunday, December 21, 1930 with Cardinal O’Connell attending at St. Thomas Aquinas Church. He was known to be a scholar of music, composer, organist and singer.\n\nIn the midst of the depression years, he set about to improve the curriculum of the high school and in 1930-1931, he founded St. Thomas Aquinas Commercial Institute. True to the tradition of the parish, this school was one of the finest of its kind. Courses in law and insurance were available to the students. They were taught accounting and office management and were also trained in the use of modern office machines. The far-sightedness of Msgr. Roche’s plan is well known today in the success of the Institute’s graduates throughout the Boston area.\n\nMsgr. Roche was a profound scholar. His knowledge was encyclopedic and it was not unusual for him to preach an eloquent sermon on medicine, law, or politics. He had a deep civic pride and was a militant in his efforts to keep undesirable businesses out of his parish. He often appeared in person or sent his representatives before licensing boards to protest against businesses which he deemed unsuited to the parish. Msgr. Roche also encouraged the formation of the Daughters of Isabella in the parish. He was the State Chaplain of the Daughters, and on May 4, 1930, the St. Thomas Aquinas Circle No. 506 of the Daughters of Isabella was instituted. The first chaplain was Father Maurice Flynn. Msgr. Roche did much to foster a happy combination of education and sports. He formed the St. Thomas Literary and Athletic Association. The parish football, baseball and basketball teams gained increasing fame and at the same time the debating clubs and discussion groups earned their own reputation.\n\nOn March 15, 1935, after seven years of zealous devotion to our parish, Msgr. Roche died, greatly mourned by his parishioners. He had guided his people during the great depression, when material wealth was scarce, but he left a spiritual wealth of dedication and of priestly zeal to enrich the parish. The Most Rev. Francis J. Spellman, auxiliary bishop of Boston presided at his funeral Mass on Monday, March 21. The eulogy was pronounced by Rev. Michael Splaine. He was laid to rest at St. Mary Cemetery in Quincy .\n\nArrival of Msgr. Casey, 1935-1949\n\nMsgr. Roche was succeeded by Msgr. William J. Casey, who came to our parish familiar with its needs. He had lived in our rectory as a guest of Msgr. Moriarty during the erection of a new church in Forest Hills-St. Andrew the Apostle, of which he was appointed founding pastor in August, 1918. Msgr. Casey was born in Newburyport on February 1, 1872, the son of William and Catherine Casey. Both were immigrants from Ireland and raised a family of eight. He attended schools in the Immaculate Conception Parish there. Prior to entering St. John Seminary, he attended St. Michael College in Toronto. He prepared for the priesthood at St. John Seminary. He was ordained on December 18, 1896. He celebrates his first Mass on December 20 at the Immaculate Conception Church in Newburyport. His first assignment was to Immaculate Conception Parish in Malden (1897-1917).\n\nMsgr. Casey was pastor of four parishes:\n\nSt. Joseph, Holbrook; appointed on February 19, 1917\n\nSt. Andrew the Apostle, Forest Hills; appointed on August 12, 1918\n\nSt. Patrick, Roxbury, appointed on January 19, 1926\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, Jamaica Plain; appointed on April 10, 1935\n\nAs founding pastor of St. Andrew’s, he erected the new church of English gothic architecture, dedicated by the Cardinal on May 11, 1924. He also erected an adjacent rectory and parish hall across from the church. During his years at St. Patrick’s, a new school was erected on Mt. Pleasant Ave and the convent enlarged. The cornerstone to the school was laid on Sunday, December 8, 1929.\n\nContinued Growth\n\nThe Holy Name Society with Fr. Maurice Flynn as director reached a membership of 1, 600 men, making it one of the largest organizations in the Archdiocese. The Ladies Sodality under the direction of Fr. John L. Parsons had to be divided into two sections because of its large membership. Novenas were a part of the devotional program and the great numbers of people attending the Novena of the Miraculous Medal bore witness to the dedication of our parishioners. Msgr. Casey’s work received papal recognition in August, 1938 when he was named a monsignor. He also served as chaplain of the Massachusetts Catholic Women’s Guild and as a Diocesan Consultor. In the late 1930’s, our church building was nearly seventy years old and in need of renovation. The convent was also in need of repair. The high school, now ten years old also needed enlarging for the population tide in urban areas was also appearing in our parish. Msgr. Casey launched a building and renovation program. He repaired the convent and redecorated the interior of the church. He enlarged the high school by adding a three story wing. Boys were also admitted, making the school co-ed.\n\nThis period during the late 1930’s and early 1940’s marked a great upsurge in the cultural life of the parish and the athletic fame of our school. The CYO was formed with headquarters in the former convent on St. Joseph Street. Here, under Fr. Flynn’s direction, the athletic clubs of St. Thomas took shape, grew and earned their fame. Invitations from all over New England came to the St. Thomas Aquinas teams. During this period, there were nine baseball teams, eight football teams, and seven basketball quintets. The parish also developed an excellent reputation in swimming, tennis, hockey, wrestling, golf, boxing, and bowling.\n\nThe cultural life of the parish flourished simultaneously. Under Fr. Ryan, the League of the Sacred Heart and the Altar Boys’ Guild became groups in the parish. Under Fr. Riley, St. Anne’s Sodality and the Discussion Club added new members. Under Fr. Parson’s, Our Lady’s Sodality, the Literary Society, the Little Theatre, and the Cinema Society became important in the social life of our parishioners. During these years annual dramatic presentations gave outlets to the abundant talent of our parishioners. Popular dramas were stages: The Valley of the Mohawk ; Peg-O-My-Heart; When Irish Eyes are Smiling; and The Arrival of Kitty.\n\nWhen World War II came, Msgr. Casey guided his parishioners during their dark days of trial and sorrow, not sparing himself in the performance of his priestly duties. A happy event after the war ended in 1945 was his golden jubilee celebration on December 18, 1946. After fourteen years of dedicated spiritual leadership, Msgr. Casey died on December 1, 1949 at the age of 77. Archbishop Cushing presided at his funeral Mass on Monday, December 6 at St. Thomas Aquinas Church. The eulogy was pronounced by Rev. Edward J. Riley, pastor of St. Mary Parish in Billerica. He was laid to rest at St. Mary Cemetery in Newburyport. Many dignitaries throughout the city paid tribute to him at his death. Merchants in the neighborhood closed their stores during the funeral Mass.\n\nMsgr. Keenan, 1949-1967\n\nMsgr. Keenan was born in Lowell on May 18, 1883, the son of Catherine E. Keenan. He came from a family of three, having two sisters. He was ordained on March 18, 1913 by Cardinal O’Connell. His assignments as parochial vicar included St. Mary, Quincy, 1913; St. Ann, Gloucester (1913-1926); St. John the Evangelist, Winthrop (1926-1928); Most Precious Blood, Hyde Park (1928-1929) and St. Columbkille, Brighton (1929-1935). He then went on to serve as pastor of St. John the Evangelist Parish in East Bridgewater (1935-1939) and Sacred Heart in Weymouth (1939-1949). His appointment to Jamaica Plain took effect on December 28, 1949. He found our parish well-rounded in it spiritual, educational and social well-being. He was deeply religious man with a very strict sense of duty and obligation, and his parishioners soon discovered and regarded with admiration his high standards of excellence.\n\nThe Renovation Period\n\nMsgr. Keenan found that eighty years had taken its toll on the church and seventy-five years had left their mark on the convent. He renovated the convent promptly and then turned his attention to the church. The upper and lower churches were completely redecorated and painted. A new organ was installed and the old pews replaced. When the work was finished, the people of the parish were were delighted with the artistic changes that had been accomplished without destroying the original beauty of the church.\n\nLike his predecessors, Msgr. Keenan maintained the highest possible education standards in our schools. One of his important achievements was the installation of closed circuit television in both schools. Parking in the vicinity of the church had been a problem for some time and a parking lot was set up on South Street. In 1953, at the request of the Archbishop, the pastor formed the Parish Council of Catholic Women, an affiliate of the growing National Council. An annual day of recollection was inaugurated. The First Friday Adoration Society was formed with the Blessed Sacrament exposed throughout the day. Later the Adoration period was extended and the Blessed Sacrament was exposed throughout the night.\n\nSubsequently, devotions to Our Lady of Fatima were also added to the functions of the Parish Council of Catholic Women. A Social Service Committee instituted visits to three hundred men and women confined to the rest homes in the parish. Another annual event held every spring was a Day of Recollection for Women. The day included Mass, a coffee hour, guest speaker and closing with the rosary and benediction. In September, 1957, the zeal and devotion of Msgr. Keenan received recognition from the Vatican and he was elevated to the rank of Domestic Prelate. Two other priests serving with distinction in Jamaica Plain, Msgr. Francis J. Desmond, rector of the Cardinal O’Connell Minor Seminary and Msgr. William J. Desmond, pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish were also honored. In 1960, Msgr. Keenan initiated the Legion of Mary and the Men’s Nocturnal Adoration Society. A happy occasion for the parish was his golden jubilee. He celebrated a Mass of Thanksgiving on March 19, 1963.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas Band\n\nIn November, 1962, the CYO program introduced the band as a major activity under the direction of Father Edmund J. Sviokla. The band’s first public appearance was in March, 1963 in the St. Patrick’s Day parade in South Boston, followed by its introduction in the CYO competition circuit. In five years, the band rose from Class C to Class A-1 and became the Archdiocesan Class A-1 Champions, the highest diocesan rating. During these years, the band performed, exhibited, and competed at the New York Worlds Fair, Expo 67, VFW National Convention, New York, the Disneyland Marching Band Contest, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parades in 1967 and 1968, at Convention Hall in Philadelphia, and finally at the inaugural day parade on January 20, 1969. The band also performed in many institutions to bring comfort and entertainment to those in need. Concerts have been given at the Shattuck Hospital, the Norfolk and Concord prisons, the Holy Ghost Hospital and at the Mattapan and Fernald Hospitals. The band program involved about 250 children. Throughout the year, devoted parents and many tireless and nameless workers dedicated themselves to our youth in order to keep their musical performance up to a high standard as well as moral code.\n\nOn March 31, 1967, after fifty four years as a priest, Msgr. Keenan felt the time had come for him to rest from his labors. With deep regret, he announced his retirement to Regina Cleri and bade farewell to his beloved parishioners. His piety and priestly dignity had been a constant inspiration during his eighteen years at St. Thomas Aquinas Parish. Well did his parishioners know that every day, at some hour, he could be found in his church praying before the altar. Although he sought no limelight and refused to project himself or assert his personality, at his departure, he left countless staunch friends to whom he would always be an inspiration. Blessed with a long life, Msgr. Keenan died on December 24, 1974 at Regina Cleri. He was 91. His funeral Mass took place on Friday, December 27 at St. Joseph Church in the West End. The eulogy was pronounced by the Most Rev. Joseph F. Maguire. He was laid to rest at St. Patrick Cemetery in Lowell.\n\nMsgr. Joseph P. Donelan, 1967-1974\n\nOn April 13, 1967, Msgr. Donelan was appointed the sixth pastor. Born in Roxbury on November 14, 1909, the son of Mathias B. and Elizabeth Donelan, he was the oldest in a family of eight children. He was ordained on May 3, 1940 by the Most Rev. Richard J. Cushing, Auxiliary Bishop of Boston at the time and celebrated his first Mass at All Saints Church in the Highland section of Roxbury. After serving as parochial vicar in various parishes throughout the Archdiocese, he was appointed Director of the Archdiocesan Councils of Catholic Men and Women on February 11, 1953. He was also appointed chaplain in-residence at St. Patrick Manor in Boston. Later that year, in September, he was named a monsignor. Much would happen during his pastorate. In accordance with Vatican II reforms the sanctuary was redesigned with a new altar facing the congregation. Mass on Saturday evening to fulfill the Sunday obligation began on July 5, 1969.\n\nOne happy event was the centennial of the parish in 1969. A centennial planning committee was formed to plan events. Cardinal Cushing celebrated the centennial Mass of Thanksgiving on Saturday, October 18, 1969 in a church packed with clergy, the Sisters of St. Joseph and parishioners. A dinner/dance followed at Moseley’s on the Charles in Dedham. A year later, the Archdiocese and the entire City of Boston mourned the passing of Cardinal Cushing on November 2, 1970, ending an era of tremendous growth in the Archdiocese. The Cardinal made numerous visits to St. Thomas Aquinas Parish during his time as Archbishop. As in every parish, Mass was offered in his memory at the church. In December, 1972, the Sisters of St. Joseph and the Sisters of Notre Dame da Namur announced their leaving numerous parish schools scattered around the Archdiocese. On the list was St. Thomas Aquinas Grammar School which led to the school closing in June, 1973 and the convent being abandoned. All praise to the Sisters of St. Joseph for delivering a fine education to generations of children in the parish.\n\nWhile on a visit to New York City, Msgr. Donelan died suddenly on October 8, 1947. He was 64. His funeral Mass took place on Saturday, October 12 with Cardinal Medeiros presiding. The eulogy was pronounced by the Most Rev. Joseph F. Maguire. He was laid to rest at St. Joseph Cemetery in West Roxbury.\n\nThe pastorate of Rev. John E. Thomas, 1974-2000\n\nA new era began on December 14, 1974 with the appointment of Rev. John E. Thomas as the seventh pastor. Born in Lowell on December 10, 1924, he was the son of Christina C. (Martin) and John E. Thomas and came from a family of three. After graduating from Lowell High School, he attended Boston College and then entered St. John Seminary in 1945. He was ordained on May 3, 1950 and celebrated his first Mass at St. Rita Church in Lowell.\n\nHis first assignment was to St. Philip Neri Parish in the Waban section of Newton (1950-1955). Subsequent assignments were to parishes in Chelmsford, Lowell, and Salem. In 1960, he joined the St. James Missionary Society and spent the next ten years in Peru. Returning home to Boston, he was then assigned to St. Paul Parish in Dorchester for a year and then to St. Stephen’s in the North End where he maintained ties to the St. James Missionary Society. On Sunday, May 18, 1975, Fr. Thomas celebrated a Mass of Thanksgiving for the 25th anniversary of his ordination and greeted parishioners at a reception. The high school, led by Sister M. Thereislla graduated its last class of 58 girls on May 30, 1975. A farewell reception honoring the Sisters was held on Saturday, June 5 in the high school.\n\nMuch would happen with the parish property during the 1970’s. Toward the end of the decade, the abandoned grammar school and convent were torn down to make way for badly needed parking for parishioners. The lower church was transformed into a small chapel and a dividing wall. The remaining space became the parish hall with a kitchen and bathroom facilities. In October, 1981, ground was broken on the parking lot across from the front of the church as construction got underway on a 75 unit apartment building for the elderly. The 43,000 square feet lot was sold by the parish to make way for the building named the Farnsworth House. Built with HUD mortgage financing and rental subsidies, the building was dedicated on December 1, 1982.\n\nAs 1982 came to an end, the upper church reopened for Mass following a major renovation of the interior. Designed by Keefe Associates of Boston, work got underway that summer and involved a new seating arrangement around a new sanctuary and new lighting, painting and carpeting of the interior. The Most Rev. Daniel F. Hart blessed the new sanctuary in January, 1983. On Saturday, September 17, 1983, Cardinal Medeiros passed away at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Brighton. As in every parish, Mass was offered in his memory. The following spring, the Archdiocese welcomed his successor, Archbishop (and later Cardinal) Bernard F. Law. The Cardinal made his first visit to St. Thomas Aquinas Parish on December 4, 1985, closing a week long mission with Mass. Another parish mission took place during the week of May 14-18, 1989.\n\nA new use for the high school building was found in November, 1987. Renovations got underway to house the Nazareth Family Center, relocating from 420 Pond Street and previously known as Nazareth Child Care Center. The institution began in 1864 in the South End of Boston and moved to a new site in 1953 in the Moss Hill section of Jamaica Plain. The 125th anniversary of Nazareth was commemorated with a dinner/dance on Friday, October 5, 1989 at the Marriott Long Wharf in Boston.\n\nSister Jeanne Gribaudo joined the parish staff as pastoral associate in the fall of 1991. She grew up in Sacred Heart Parish in Roslindale and attended Boston Latin Academy and Stonehill College. She taught for two years at St. Columbkille School in Brighton and then joined the Sisters of St. Joseph in Brighton. Having a good rapport with young people, she was quick to revive the CYO program with social and athletic events for teenagers not only at St. Thomas Aquinas Parish but also at Our Lady of Lourdes. One of her proudest accomplishments was adopting a parish in Chimbote, Peru with Fr. Thomas and serving as chaperone for teenagers who journeyed to the parish bringing medical supplies and clothing in December, 1995. She also did great work running a summer day camp for children and served as an advisor on Youth Affairs to Mayor Menino.\n\nThe first tri-parish confirmation took place at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in May, 1993. Youngers from Blessed Sacrament and Our Lady of Lourdes joined with youngsters from the parish to receive the sacrament.\n\nThe 125th anniversary of the parish occurred in 1994. Cardinal Law visited for the occasion on Sunday, April 10, celebrating a Mass of Thanksgiving and greeting parishioners at a reception in the parish hall. Another happy event was commemorating the 125th anniversary of the arrival of the Sisters of St. Joseph in the parish and the archdiocese in the fall of 1873. On Sunday, October 5, 1997, Sisters, parishioners and Mayor Thomas Menino, a 1961 graduate of the high school all came together for a prayer service. The Mayor read a proclamation declaring October 5 as ‘Sisters of St. Joseph Day’ and took part in a tree planting ceremony. A reception followed in the parish hall.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, Fr. Thomas announced his time as pastor would end on August 1, 2000 and he would be granted senior priest/retirement status. In the presence of an overflow crowd of parishioners and clergy and religious, he celebrated a Mass of Thanksgiving for his golden jubilee on May 7, 2000 and greeted parishioners in the parish hall, later named in his honor in appreciation for his quarter century as pastor. With the retirement of Fr. Thomas, Sister Jeanne decided to move on to new assignment at Regis College in Weston. A special farewell Mass and reception in her honor took place on Sunday, June 11, 2000. A week later, she joined twenty youngsters from the parish making another trip to Peru, departing on Friday, June 23 and returning on July 2. In retirement, Fr. Thomas lived at Carmel Terrace in Framingham. His health began to decline as he underwent heart surgery. He made a surprise visit back to the parish on Sunday, April 27, 2003 celebrating Mass and greeting parishioners afterward. Several priest-friends and Sister Jeanne attended the Mass too.\n\nFather Thomas died on Easter Sunday, April 8, 2007 at Metro-West Medical Center in Framingham. He was 82. The Most Rev. Robert F. Hennessey presided at his funeral Mass on Wednesday, April 11. The eulogy was pronounced by Fr. Bill Pearsall, a close friend from the St. James Missionary Society. Assisting was the Most Rev. Thomas V. Daily of Brooklyn, NY. He was survived by a sister, Eleanor Prendergast of NH and a brother, General Edward J. F. Thomas (Ret. U.S. Army of VA), and several nieces and nephews. He was laid to rest at St. Patrick Cemetery in Lowell.\n\nEntering the new century\n\nRev. Gerald D. Perno was appointed the eight pastor on August 1, 2000. Born in Cambridge on Nov. 20, 1955, he came from a family of five and attended the grammar and high school in St. Mary of the Annunciation parish. Prior to entering St. John Seminary, he studied at Marquette University in Wisconsin. He was ordained on May 5, 1982 by the late Cardinal Medeiros. Tall and friendly, the new pastor was eager to get to work in his new role as pastor. An installation Mass with the Most Rev. John P. Boles presiding took place on Saturday, September 24, 2000. Overall, Fr. Perno did good work as pastor, but his pastorate was short. Declining in health and having personal problems, he decided to resign on June 21, 2004. Recovering, he returned to ministry in September, 2005, serving as chaplain at the Quigley Memorial Hospital and Chelsea Soldiers Home. He died suddenly on June 4, 2006 after being stricken at Mass at the Old Soldiers Home. He was 50. Bishop Boles presided at his funeral Mass on Thursday, June 8 at St. Mary of the Annunciation Church in Cambridge. He was laid to rest at Cambridge Cemetery.\n\nReconfiguration\n\nShortly after his appointment as Archbishop of Boston on August 1, 2003, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley took a look at the number of parishes scattered throughout the Archdiocese. Many parishes had declined in Mass attendance. The small number of new priests being ordained every year and older priests retiring added to staffing woes. One such parish was the nearby St. Andrew the Apostle Parish in Forest Hills. After a careful assessment of the situation, St. Andrew’s was suppressed on January 1, 2000 and made a mission of Sacred Heart Parish in Roslindale. One Mass was celebrated every Sunday. As the Mass attendance continued to decline, the last Sunday Mass at St. Andrew’s took place on June 27, 2004. The school closed in June, 2005. Later, the property was sold to the Bethel AME community in Forest Hills.\n\nEarly in 2004, the Archbishop announced an ambitious proposal to suppress parishes with a goal of strengthening remaining parishes throughout the Archdiocese. In May, a list of parishes being suppressed with effective dates was announced in The Pilot. One parish on the list was Blessed Sacrament in Jamaica Plain. The final Masses took place on Sunday, August 29, 2004, ending a great history at a great parish. Thereafter, English and Spanish speaking parishioners were invited to join Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Thomas Aquinas Parishes. On September 20, 2004, Fr. Michael J. Harkins arrived as the ninth pastor. Prior to his appointment to Jamaica Plain, he was serving as administrator of Blessed Sacrament Parish in Cambridge. The parish was suppressed that month and Fr. Harkins celebrated the closing Mass on Sunday, September 18.\n\nBorn and raised in Dorchester, the son of Mildred and Fred Harkins, he attended St. Peter Grammar School and Catholic Memorial in West Roxbury. He was ordained on May 5, 1979 by Cardinal Medeiros in the seminary chapel. He celebrated his first Mass on May 13 at St. Peter Church in Dorchester. With Bishop Boles presiding and members of his family attending, Fr. Harkins was installed as pastor on Sunday, November 21, 2004. A reception followed in the parish hall. He then set about his work, welcoming parishioners from Blessed Sacrament and strengthening the life of the parish as best he could. He also took an interest in the defunct pipe organ in the choir loft and encouraged efforts at fundraising to restore it. With a decline in Sunday Mass attendance, a summer schedule with two Masses at 8:30 and 10:30 went into effect in 2008. In 2009, the Sunday Mass schedule included two in English at 9 and 11 and Mass in Spanish at 12:30. Fr. Harkins pastorate ended on March 1, 2011. As of this writing, he is currently parochial vicar in the collaborative of St. Rita Parish in Lowell, St. Mary Magdalene Parish in Tyngsboro; and St. Marguerite in Dracut.\n\nCollaboration\n\nA new approach to avoid suppressing and strengthening parishes begun by Cardinal O’Malley was grouping nearby parishes into a collaborative with one pastor and parochial vicars having charge of one, two or three parishes. The first such collaborative in phase one was formed on March 1, 2011 with the appointment of Fr. Alonso Macias Zakoda taking charge of St. Thomas Aquinas Parish, Our Lady of Lourdes Parish and St. Mary of the Angels Parish in Roxbury. A native of Mexico where he was born on January 9, 1961, Fr. Alonso prepared for the priesthood in his native land and was ordained on October 17, 1988. Thereafter, he held various assignments in Mexico. In 2001, he transferred to the Archdiocese of Boston and was assigned to St. Mary of the Annunciation Parish in Cambridge.\n\nThe two Sunday Masses at 9 and 11 were combined into one Mass at 10 a.m. The Spanish Mass remained at 12:30 p.m. His pastorate was brief, ending on June 5, 2012. As of this writing, Fr. Alonso he is currently parochial vicar at St. Patrick Parish in Lawrence. Becoming our current pastor on the same date in the Jamaica Plain-Roxbury collaborative was Father Carlos F. Flor. Father Carlos was born in Villena, Spain in 1967, the son of Carlos and Mari Carmen. He comes from a family of three having two sisters. He prepared for the priesthood at the International Archdiocesan and Missionary Redemptorist Mater House of Formation in Newark, NJ. He was ordained in New Jersey on May 24, 1997. After ordination, he served in three parishes in the Archdiocese of Newark. On loan, he came to the Archdiocese of Boston. In 2004, he was assigned as parochial vicar at Immaculate Conception Parish in Revere.\n\nJoining Fr. Carlos on the parish staff has been Fr. Migel Angel Bravo Alvarez (2014-2017) and currently Fr. Andrea Povero, since his ordination on May 18, 2018. A big help to the collaborative too has been the assistance of Msgr. Charles Bourque and visiting priests. And so we come to the 150th year of the parish. An outdoor cook-out with music and games for youngsters took place on Sunday, June 23 at the parking lot behind the church. Cardinal O’Malley visited on Sunday, November 24 to celebrate a Mass of Thanksgiving at 11 a.m. A reception followed in Fr. Thomas Hall. To bring the anniversary year to a close, a dinner/dance took place in the parish hall on Saturday evening, November 30.\n\nPlease note: the text from the 1969 centennial book was used in this writing with some changes and revisions."
