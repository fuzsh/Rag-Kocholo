        "text": "D18 Weekend The Boston Globe FRIDAY, DECEMBER 16, 2005 w7 Tf For rising singer, career is a family affair -i -I mi I VP A \"I want to see myself succeed,\" says Desmond, a former high school honor student who won a merit scholarship to Lesley. \"I'd like to go on tour, it would be great to get signed. That's what we're aiming for.\" The collective pronoun is apt. Desmond's fledgling career has so far been a group effort, a family affair spearheaded by her well-connected mother and wacky rock theatrics of the parents' band. Kathy figures the family which owns the Sound Museum rehearsal complex in Boston has the largest library of local music outside of a radio station .\n\n\"If it's good we play it in our house,\" she says, and that includes everything from bluegrass, Celtic, and classical to the Ramones, Blue Oyster Cult, and John Zorn. In fourth grade Des ville, at Windham Hill founder Will Ackerman's Imaginary Road studios in Vermont (Desmond and Ackerman co-wrote a track on the CD), and at LA's Hyperion Studios. Desmond reports that her music is being played on 92 stations across the country, including modern rock station WBCN and various college stations in Boston, as well as on podcasts in Sweden and Japan. Shred, local music director at WBCN, describes Desmond as \"young and talented\" but says her career development will take time. \"They need to keep putting her in front of people.\" To that end, Desmond's mother is trying to hire an outside booking agent and a manager .\n\n\"It's not an easy thing,\" Kathy says. \"She's just starting to get noticed. I'm taking it fast. I really am. I think now that she's on the radio it'll happen.\" Whatever \"it\" is .\n\nFor her part, Desmond is happy to muse about a future as an illustrator, or in the fashion world, or as a pop star, or blending music and design into some sort of multimedia project. She fully expects to return to college and doesn't seem to be at all in a hurry to arrive anywhere in particular. Anything and everything seems possible. She is, after all, only 19. DESMOND Continued from Page D16 freak shows and such evocative M-tles as \"Ulcer Gulch,\" have spawned mainstream songbird Casey Desmond is stranger than the giant papier-mache craniums mom and dad like to wear onstage .\n\nThe Bentmen gene has, clearly, skipped a generation. The younger Desmond's heroes are Tracy Chapman and Garbage \"the solo folk women and the big rock bands\" and her new self-titled album is a hook-filled collection about \"love and relationship things.\" If you assume Desmond's radio-ready tu-neage is the deceptively sweet sound of rebellion, you'd be wrong. \"Music isn't my way to rebel,\" she says. \"It's my way to speak. I use the words I usually use .\n\nMy music is me.\" Desmond has been taking frequent naps in recent weeks on a couch at Lesley University's Art Institute of Boston, where she studies illustration and fashion and dates a Bulgarian exchange student named Svetlin. Next week is finals week and she's working-round the clock to finish her class projects and promote her self-released album. After that, Desmond is taking a break from school, and her double life will contract in pursuit of a single, and singular, goal: making it in the music business. father. Kathy concedes that adding professional stresses to the already loaded parent-child dynamic can be tricky .\n\n\"Des and I know so many people,\" she says. \"We've played every club, we know people in radio and press. We just want to help her any way we can. Yes, there's a little bit of the 'Oh, you're her mom thing. People think she won't be as good Casey Desmond plays a Season of Giving holiday show, with a Toys for Tots drive, at the Middle East Upstairs on Sunday featuring special guests Emily Grogan, the Snow Leopards, and Static of the Gods .\n\nDoors are at tickets are call 617-864-3278 for info. Bring an unwrapped toy to be entered in a prize drawing. DOMINIC CHAVEZGLOBE STAFF Casey Desmond's third, self-titled album is a hook-filled mixture of rock and folk far different from the sound of the singer's parents, who are in the Boston band the Bentmen. With solo disc, Gap Band leader reinvents himself as 'king of as I say she is. And we've had our fights .\n\nWe're explosive. She doesn't want to hear me say, You really need to work on But the benefits are she's progressed so much as an artist.\" Growing up in the Desmond family means 19 years of tutelage, immersion-style, in a home where musical tastes far exceed the \"Hey, it's hard in this business,\" Wilson says. \"It's hard because a lot of programmers want to tell me I'm too old to be on the radio. You have to reinvent. If some young kid programmer don't like your record, it don't get played .\n\nI'm too old? It's crazy.\" The singer, who founded the Gap Band with his brothers in the early '70s, doesn't divulge his age. \"I'm ageless,\" he says. \"It doesn't do nothing but toy with your mind when you think about your age, man. Ain't nothing old about me.\" Wilson's hits with the Gap Band \"Outstanding,\" \"Yearning for Your Love,\" \"I Don't Believe You Want to Get Up and Dance (Oops, Up Side Your Head)\" are frequently sampled on modern ByRashodD.Ollison THE BALTIMORE SUN Charlie Wilson may end the statement with an infectious, high-pitched giggle, but he's only half-joking. \"I'm the king of the singer-songwriter says .\n\n\"Bobby Brown ain't been showing up lately.\" Wilson is calling on his cellphone from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, where he's waiting for his flight to an engagement in Indiana. With a new, well-received solo album riding the charts, the R. Kelly-produced \"Charlie, Last Name Wilson,\" the Gap Band lead singer may be on to something. If you consider the major influence Wilson has had on male singers of the hip-hop era (Kelly, Aaron Hall, and mond sang a duet on \"Tip-toe Through the Tulips\" with Tiny Tim, who was opening for the Bentmen. Two years later she got her first guitar .\n\nIn between art club, school plays, countless youth groups, and six years of competitive Irish step-dancing, Kathy and Bill's oldest daughter locked herself in her room and wrote songs. Adore, Des mond's high-school glam-rock band, self-released a CD. After Adore broke up the young singer took her parents' advice to spend more time working on her folk-pop material, and she subsequently made a solo acoustic CD. Her third and latest album was recorded in Boston at guitarist Taylor Barefoot's studio and Division in Somer- and hip-hop songs. Signed to Jive Records, Wilson is one of the few funk-era vocalists on a major label these days .\n\nHis peers Michael Henderson, Teddy Pender-grass, Jeffrey Osborne are either largely inactive or recording for small, independent labels. \"I've got Jive behind me, so that makes a difference,\" Wilson says. \"I can name a lot of huge stars from yesterday who ain't getting no love from the industry, which is sad. I feel lucky 'cause it's rough out here.\" When Wilson isn't playing solo dates or shows with his brothers around the world, he's at home on his 20-acre ranch in Acton, a rural community in Los Angeles County. \"It's a cool, little country town,\" he says .\n\n\"It's quiet as hell.

I didn't want to lose old fans, but I'm gaining new ones. I had to understand that I wasn't cutting a Gap Band record. I could go to the edge, so to speak.\" With its beat-driven arrangements and rap cameos, \"Charlie, Last Name Wilson\" is much slicker than the work Wilson does with his brothers Ronnie and Robert of the Gap Band. The funk factor is virtually nonexistent, and Wilson is transformed into a cornrows-wearing mack daddy .\n\nOn just about every track, especially the title cut, he epitomizes the flashy older guy in the club, the one trying to woo the young honeys with his smoothed-out game.
