        "text": "BosTen is your weekly guide to the best events and coolest happenings in and around Boston.\n\nThis week’s BosTen offers a mix of in-person and virtual things to do in Boston this weekend. Have an idea about what we should cover? Leave us a comment on this article or in the BosTen Facebook group, or email us at [email protected].\n\nHelp to end hunger with The Empty Bowls Project\n\nFood insecurity has always been an issue in Boston, but the pandemic has worsened the situation for many. The Empty Bowls Project, a grassroots organization that seeks to raise awareness and funds to end hunger, will be holding a fundraising event at the Roslindale Substation this Sunday at 5 p.m., with proceeds benefitting the Roslindale/Hyde Park Neighborhood Food Action Collaborative. Tickets will include a handmade ceramic bowl from Create: Art in Community and a serving of soup. A take-out option will be available for those who cannot stay for the event. Donations from those who cannot attend are welcomed as well. — Joel Ang\n\nLearn how to shuck oysters at ReelHouse Marina Bay’s Shuck & Sip\n\nShucking oysters is one of those activities that embodies the spirit of New England. As such, if you live here, it’s a rite of passage to learn how to handle those bivalves. Luckily, ReelHouse Marina Bay in Quincy is hosting an oyster shucking class on Thursday at 6 p.m. where you’ll get to learn a vital life skill. Tickets also include two different oyster tastings with wine pairings — and the great view comes free. It’s hard to imagine an event that could be a better harbinger of the one thing that brings all Bostonians happiness: summer. — Joel Ang\n\nHear the howl of the wolves when Los Lobos arrive at Bull Run\n\nLos Lobos may be best known for its brief time in the commercial spotlight thanks to its cover of Richie Valens’ “La Bamba.” But between 1983 and 2021, Los Lobos has been nominated for 12 Grammys in nine different categories (including Best Musical Album for Children) and won a total of three in two categories. Los Lobos’s 2021 album “Native Sons” includes covers of songs by familiar L.A. artists like The Beach Boys, Jackson Browne, Buffalo Springfield, and War (their version of “The World is a Ghetto” features vocals by Boston legend Barrence Whitfield), and several who are lesser-known to pop audiences, including Lalo Guerrero y Sus Cincos Lobos, Willie Bobo, Don & Dewey, and the Jaguars, as well as one original, “Native Son.” The second of their four currently scheduled New England stops is at Bull Run this Thursday at 7:30 p.m. — Blake Maddux\n\nTake in the breathtaking works of J.M.W. Turner\n\nThe renowned British painter Joseph Mallord William (J.M.W.) Turner was born in 1775, and died in 1851. That’s a fact. But due to his tendency to be more secretive than open about his life and work, in between those dates, there’s a lot of murkiness about the man. “Turner’s Modern World,” the upcoming exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts that opens this Sunday, may not help in putting the pieces of his life together, but the 100+ examples of his paintings, watercolors, drawings, and sketchbooks will certainly aim a spotlight on his creative gifts. Looking at the exhibit as a whole, you can appreciate Turner’s genius. Look at the pieces chronologically, and you will discover how he evolved as an artist, from the meticulous and more traditional approach of the breathtaking “Fall of the Rhine at Schaffhausen” (1805-6) to the nearly abstract “The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons” (1834) and the luminescent, impressionistic study “Venice with the Salute” (between 1840 and ’45), in which subject matter takes a back seat to ambiance. — Ed Symkus\n\nLearn about natural wine at Rebel Rebel\n\nRebel Rebel is a nationally recognized natural wine bar at Somerville’s Bow Market that exists to break down the patriarchy of the old-school wine world. With that context in mind, it should come as no surprise that Rebel Rebel has decided to name an upcoming educational class as “WTF is Terroir,” explicitly stating that no other word has been used in the wine world “with such gatekeeping gusto.” Yup, no barriers here — everyone’s welcome for some great wine and a great time. Tickets include a one-hour session complete with three tasting pours. — Joel Ang\n\nGet weird with the Boston Underground Film Festival\n\nIt’s officially spring film festival season, with a total of four Massachusetts movie showcases starting this week. The first of note is the Boston Underground Film Festival, which brings its typical collection of cinematic oddities to the Brattle Theatre from March 23-27. One must-see is the Thursday evening screening of “Freakscene: The Story of Dinosaur Jr.,” the New England premiere of a documentary about the influential alt rock group founded in Massachusetts. For a full schedule and ticketing info, check out the BUFF website. — Kevin Slane\n\nExpand your worldview at the Salem Film Fest\n\nAs Massachusetts’ largest international documentary film festival, the Salem Film Fest offers residents a window into many different worlds and perspectives over the course of its 11-day run. The fest is split in two, with virtual offerings available streaming online from March 24 to April 3 and in-person screenings from March 24-27 at Cinema Salem, Peabody Essex Museum, The Cabot, and Endicott College. To grab online passes or five-ticket bundles, head to the SFF website. — Kevin Slane\n\nImmerse yourself in the Boston Israeli Film Festival\n\nLike Salem Film Fest, the 2022 edition of the Boston Israeli Film Festival will be both in-person and online. Fest director Lisa Gossels is moderating a number of panels and has picked a diverse array of films and TV shows that capture the zeitgeist of contemporary Israel. Be sure to check out “Dead Sea Guardians,” a documentary starring three environmental activists — an Israeli, a Palestinian, and a Jordanian — who join forces for a historic swim to raise awareness about impending environmental catastrophe. For a full list of programming, check out the BIFF website. — Kevin Slane\n\nWatch local singers unleash their inner diva\n\nCatch some of the most talented young local vocalists paying tribute to the women who revolutionized the music industry with “Muse: A Salute to Divas Showcase” at the Cabot this Friday. Six singers will take the stage to showcase the works of women musicians who have inspired them, including former “American Idol” and “The Voice” contestant Amanda Mena and former “The Voice” contestant Casey Desmond. — Kevin Slane\n\nFeel the rhythm of Las Cafeteras at Crystal Ballroom\n\nHead to Somerville this Friday to see Las Cafeteras, a Los Angeles group that will blend Latin roots, Afro-Mexican Son jarocho, and other genres at the Crystal Ballroom. The sextet is known for busting out traditional instruments like the 8 string Jarana and Quijada (donkey jawbone) while inspiring social change with their lyrics. — Kevin Slane"
