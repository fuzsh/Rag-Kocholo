Students who display strength in these values demonstrate to us that they are on a path to alumni leadership.\n\nEach year, nine Compass Awards are presented. The eight undergraduate colleges are represented as well as one award representing the Alumni Relations. As part of the Compass Awards program, two additional honors are made.\n\nThe Wendy Breen Kline Award, established in 1997 and named in honor of the late Wendy Breen Kline, BB’84, PAH’88, is presented to one undergraduate senior who embodies both leadership and volunteer spirit.\n\nThe Garnet Award recognizes one junior or third-year undergraduate student who has demonstrated the same core values as the Compass Award recipients, making an impact in our community while showing promise for even greater success at Northeastern in the future. The Garnet Award debuted in 2014.\n\nThis program evolved from the Professional Promise Awards, a past model that was successfully established and implemented by the Alumni Association Board for several years."
