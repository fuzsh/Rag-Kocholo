        "text": "By: Roisin Casey\n\nHorror is one of America’s most popular genres, with its overall box office revenue between 1995-2023 tying (ironically) with comedy at 34.3 billion dollars.\n\nHuge horror franchises like Scream and Saw have both released additions to their sagas in 2023.\n\nHowever, the general genre of horror has spanned beyond jump-scares and serial killers. The last few decades have seen swaths of experimental, psychological, and folk horror, and has gradually developed into a diverse umbrella term for several different subgenres.\n\nSo, in honor of Halloween season and Hispanic Heritage Month, I decided to zero in on one of these subgenres: Mexican horror.\n\nMexican horror, both individual in its plotlines and simultaneously influenced by foreign cinema, rose in popularity between 1930 and 1950.\n\nIn its beginnings, films in this genre saw well-known villains such as vampires and werewolves, but also creatures traditional to Mexican folklore, such as La Llorona.\n\nMore recent Mexican horror films have more interpretive villains, many pertaining to current events and issues.\n\nWhile many American viewers might see these more poignant plotlines as mere derivations of more well-known American films, Mexican horror is individually influential to the point that certain Mexican directors are regarded as masters of the genre.\n\nThis month I picked three Mexican horror films to focus on, their release dates spanning over a period of about 80 years- Phantom of the Monastery (1934), Cronos (1993), and Tigers are Not Afraid (2017).\n\nPhantom of the Monastery (1934) – directed by Fernando de Fuentes\n\nStarring: Marta Roel, Carlos Villatoro, Enrique del Campo\n\nPlot: Three companions find themselves lost in the woods far from home. When a mysterious apparition of a shadowy monk directs them to the nearby abandoned monastery for shelter, they soon find that the ruins contain something much more sinister than empty rooms and mice.\n\nPlenty of sinful romance, eerie visual effects, and noir suspense.\n\nMy rating: ★★\n\nMy review: Though it had its merits, Phantom of the Monastery is definitely not for everyone. The pacing is very slow, and its payoff and ending feel rushed and anticlimactic.\n\nThe style is very different from what modern horror has evolved into, which is to be expected, and the viewer should not expect an action-packed slasher.\n\nHowever, I was really impressed by many of the visual effects and shadow/lighting work, especially since effects of the time period are exclusively practical allowing less room for nonrealism. Despite the slowness, the creepy parts were decidedly creepy.\n\nThough I would not exactly recommend this movie to the casual horror enjoyer, I am very glad I had the opportunity to add it to my watched list.\n\nWhere to watch: Criterion Collection.\n\nCronos (1993) – directed by Guillermo del Toro\n\nStarring: Federico Luppi, Ron Perlman, Tamara Shanath\n\nPlot: An elderly man and his granddaughter stumble upon a mysterious golden device within an antique in their family-owned shop. Their discovery unleashes a domino effect of revenge, destruction, death, and…undeath?\n\nMy rating: ★★★\n\nMy review: The art house horror film that essentially launched del Toro’s career, Cronos, is considered by some to be Part 1 in an unofficial trilogy, in tandem with The Devil’s Backbone (2001) and Pan’s Labyrinth (2006). Practical effects went pretty wild in this one as well. Had me buggin’ (ha, ha).\n\nEvery scene had a distinguishable and unique feel, and the sheer distinction between the tones of the beginning and the end of the movie is almost jarring.\n\nAgain, the pacing was rather slow, but the underlying themes of the story and potential interpretations of the Cronos device were really intriguing.\n\nI would tentatively recommend this movie to those who are interested in expanding their knowledge of traditional horror but want to try something new.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream on Criterion Channel or Max.\n\nTigers are Not Afraid (2017) – directed by Issa López\n\nStarring: Paola Lara, Juan Ramón López\n\nPlot: A group of orphaned children armed with three wishes band together in efforts to evade both the cartel that killed their parents and the lingering shadows of their pasts.\n\nWhen one of the children obtains a phone that contains incriminating evidence of the leader of the cartel, the lines between reality and the supernatural blur, and things get much more complicated.\n\nMy rating: ★★★★\n\nMy review: A beautiful movie, both from a visual and contextual perspective. The main body of the film’s story is acted almost exclusively by amateur child actors, which is often seen as a sentence of death to quality.\n\nBut in this case, the acting was actually quite good- the dialogue played to the actors’ strengths and was often paired with handheld camera shots, which I felt added to the uncertain and childlike tone of the film.\n\nLópez also intertwines the harsh reality of the cartel and their influence over Mexican society and masterfully intersperses heartwarming scenes with jarringly tense ones, which are still further intertwined with more traditional horror elements.\n\nI really enjoyed it and I think this is a movie that everyone should consider adding to their watchlists.\n\nWhere to watch: Rent this movie on Amazon, Apple TV, or Vudu, or stream on AMC+.\n\n**Please check trigger warnings for Cronos and Tigers are Not Afraid (especially the latter) before watching.\n\nTo contact this writer email Muse Newspaper at musebsa@bsfa.org.\n\nFeatured images curtesy of Wikipedia (Phantom of the Monastery), The Criterion Collection (Cronos), and Wikipedia (Tigers are Not Afraid).\n\nBy Ronan Goeke\n\nThe Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO) began its concert series on September 28, 2023.\n\nHeadlined by Dvořák’s famed Symphony No. 9 (titled “From the New World”), the weekend marked the orchestra’s first concert series performance with new music director Jonathan Heyward, the first Black music director of a major American orchestra.\n\nHeyward, a cellist and graduate of Boston Conservatory, started his career at the Hallé Orchestra in England. Since then, he served as the chief conductor of the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie and is now starting his directorship of the BSO this season, breaking a barrier in the historically white-dominated field.\n\nAn Amer’ican in Baltimore\n\nAfter the traditional playing of the national anthem, the program began with Amer’ican by James Lee III of Morgan State. Lee composed the work as a response to the Native American themes of Dvořák’s Ninth and other folk-influenced artwork.\n\nThe haunting bassoon and oboe soli swept over the subdued strings, soon followed by an exhilarated build to the final smashing chord. Amer’ican was warmly received by the audience, bringing a smile to Lee’s face as he stepped on stage to take a bow.\n\nHeyward was then joined by Jean-Yves Thibaudet for Gershwin’s Piano Concerto in F. The jazz-influenced music traveled through the ensemble, marked by an impressively warm and prominent bass clarinet.\n\nAs the beat jumped from the woodwinds and fell back to the snare drum, Thibaudet quickly moved into the smooth melody of the solo piano part. His heavy emphasis on the left hand sometimes overpowered the melodic line from the right, a trait that would be heard throughout.\n\nWhen the gentle low strings joined in, the timing was excellent; it was like Heyward and Thibaudet were telepathically connected.\n\nThe second movement had wonderful solos from the horn, trumpet, oboe, and violin; the resonant tones matched the orchestra well.\n\nThe bombastic start of the third movement was clearly articulated by the deft winds. The final minutes of the piece were resplendent, sometimes becoming too much; from our seats in the upper left, the piano was often inaudible, an issue heard in the first movement as well.\n\nThibaudet received much applause after the vivacious ending. But, even though the soloist was well in time with the ensemble, Thibaudet’s performance was like that of a Well-Tempered Clavier concert: extremely strict in speed and rigid in movement.\n\nHis playing lacked the free, loose nature with which one should perform Gershwin. The orchestra was stylistically appropriate throughout, but did not match the piano.\n\nRegardless, Thibaudet’s performance was impressive, particularly as the third movement hurdled towards a quick ending. His use of reverb was clean and allowed for the over-exaggerated lower notes to impose their sonority over the audience.\n\nOverall, it was a splendid performance of a marvelous concerto, followed by a lovely encore by Thibaudet that further showed his minimal use of rubato.\n\nAfter intermission, the principal violist took the mic and honored the recent death of Delmar A. Stewart, who had been a BSO violist for 46 years. As a tribute to Stewart, the ensemble played “Nimrod”, the gentle ninth variation from Elgar’s Enigma Variations.\n\nThe stirring performance was filled with emotion, but much too loud. The start of “Nimrod” is marked pianississimo (very soft), yet the strings began at a mezzo piano (moderately soft); this was likely due to Heyward’s unnecessarily big movements, but why is that needed when the strings could simply look towards their concertmaster?\n\nInto the New World\n\nA moment of silence led into the beginning of Dvořák’s “From the New World” Symphony. The low strings thundered across the music hall, precisely followed by the roar of the timpani and a well-tuned wind entrance.\n\nThe main theme in the horns was prominent but balanced with the volume of the orchestra, and the flute and clarinet were closely connected. Repeating back to the main theme, the winds effectively replicated their style from the first time.\n\nWhole and balanced brass chords started the largo (very slow) second movement, the climbing strings anticipating the famous cor anglais solo. The deep woodwind entered, but right after the first note, the sound dropped; after a quick recovery, the performer played the rest of the solo with a beautifully open sound. The low strings were enchanting, underlying the upper strings and woodwinds with a firm but kind foundation.\n\nDespite having an excellent tone throughout, the orchestra was still too loud. The music is not marked pianississimo like the Elgar, but was still heard at a general volume of mezzo piano.\n\nAgain, Heyward was the culprit, having such animated gestures that it only made sense to play too loudly. Furthermore, Heyward did not express the same level of emotion as, say, the cor anglais soloist or the low strings.\n\nBe that as it may, Heyward’s conducting brought forth exact timing from different sections, and the low strings at the end finally delivered the quiet volume we were yearning for.\n\nThe opening statement of movement three had defined attacks. Here, Heyward’s exuberant conducting paid off; the timing was accurate, the musicality evident, and the cues together.\n\nGrand brass filled the concert hall with the main theme as the fourth movement began, further exhibiting their exceptional tone. The clarinetist sang through their instrument as the luscious solo soared over the orchestra.\n\nYet, the further into the movement the orchestra got, something became apparent: the energy levels were slowly decreasing.\n\nWhile the third movement had been bouncy, the fourth became fatigued and almost bored; the ensemble did not drag, but the spike in energy that one expects from the end of the symphony did not come.\n\nIn fact, the ending was almost rushed; the marked meno mosso e maestoso (less motion and stately) was almost the exact same tempo as the first statement of the movement’s theme, and the following allegro con fuoco (quickly with fire) was indistinguishable from the previous tempo.\n\nFor the ending of such a monumental symphony, one expects every single sound to be juiced. After the last note from the whole orchestra, the winds sustained the final notes, decreasing in volume to… a mezzo piano.\n\nIt was as if Dvořák wanted to challenge the orchestra to play his marked dynamic (pianississimo), and the group did not win that challenge.\n\nThe fourth movement was rather disappointing compared to the verve of the other movements.\n\nEven so, the orchestra stayed together and maintained a quality tone throughout, concluding the night with a fine performance of Dvořák’s “From the New World” Symphony.\n\nHeyward: An Analysis\n\nNow, the million dollar question: how did Heyward perform as conductor? Well, it’s evident that Jonathan Heyward is part of the school of modern conductors derived from Seiji Ozawa, characterized by animated movements, high energy, and very thorough preparation.\n\nSome conductors do not plan their movements before performance, but this is not the case for the Ozawa school, where every single motion is carefully planned out prior to rehearsals.\n\nThis technique brings the orchestra together and creates precise entrances, but can also cause a lack of expression in the quieter sections, an issue we saw in the Elgar and the second movement of “New World”.\n\nIn what is an odd defiance of the Ozawa technique, the conductor seemed to not know what to do with his left hand.\n\nConductors often use the right hand to indicate time and the left to show volume and expression, sometimes keeping time with both to be very clear. With Amer’ican, he almost always used both hands for time, which makes sense given the work’s complicated rhythms.\n\nIn the concerto, the left hand usually stayed in front of his stomach; it was intentionally out of the way so that the soloist had room for his own interpretations.\n\nIn the Dvořák, however, the left hand sort of… hung out. When it wasn’t directing time with the right, the hand was awkwardly positioned in front of him, like he was gesturing for something without actually moving.\n\nThe last issue is Heyward’s small quirk: adjusting his glasses during the music.\n\nHe didn’t adjust them often, but when he did, it was almost interruptive to the flow of his conducting.\n\nIn movement one of “New World”, the conductor was using wide motions to indicate a sweeping melody, but his left hand suddenly flew up to fix his glasses, leaving his right hand beating time with no purpose.\n\nOdd quirks aside, Heyward’s conducting featured a vast array of motions. His marcato pounding in one moment of Amer’ican was immediately followed by gentle swaying from side to side, maintaining a stable tempo but expressing the dance-like quality of the music.\n\nHeyward was successful in creating a unique approach that engrossed the audience, partly due to the odd left hand, but primarily because of the verve and wide selection of motions with which he informed the orchestra how to perform.\n\nConclusion\n\nHearing a masterpiece like Dvořák’s Ninth is always a joy, especially when a new music director brings such unique stylistic choices to the ensemble. But, playing a new piece like Amer’ican is no easy task, especially when it contains difficult rhythms.\n\nNonetheless, the ensemble delivered a wonderful performance that evidently pleased the composer.\n\nThe orchestra followed their conductor well and was in time throughout the performance; their impressive tone was also audible in all three works.\n\nWhile Thibaudet’s performance was lacking in style, he was well connected to the orchestra through a passionate conductor, and the clean use of reverb allowed the lower notes to wash over the audience.\n\nAlbeit a few missed attacks, the orchestra was superb; the strings were warm and resonant, the percussion clear and well-blended, the woodwinds stylish and in sync, and the brass whole and prominent.\n\nAll this was topped with the proverbial cherry that is Jonathan Heyward: bright, happy, and prepared to transform our local Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.\n\nTo contact this writer, email Muse Newspaper at musebsa@bsfa.org.\n\nBy: Ronan O’Comartun\n\nIn my last election coverage article, by saying “Student Government at BSA is still in its infancy, and there is a glimmer of hope that one day it will evolve into something impactful,” I did not mean some weird co-parenting cop-out allowing both Chloe McNeill and Jamir Lawson to take office.\n\nFormer President Quinn Bryant made a loudspeaker announcement the afternoon of May 25th revealing that Jamir Lawson and Chloe McNeill will be Student Government Association co-Presidents.\n\nThe decision was reached after a 45 minute discussion between Lawson, McNeill, former President Quinn Bryant, and the two SGA advisors Meg Grouzard and Jocelyn Providence.\n\nOne of the two opponents won by four votes (this counts as one percent).\n\nNo one besides Grouzard and Providence knows the final results concerning who came out on top.\n\nFour votes is a small margin to win by but it still means that someone won.\n\nWhile the ratio of the victory may have been small, that does not diminish the fact that this outcome does not benefit the students, but rather McNeill and Lawson’s personal interests.\n\nBy acting as co-President to each other, both McNeill and Lawson get what they want: a small amount of influence and a nice line on their college resumes.\n\nThe SGA, advised by Election runners Meg Grouzard and Jocelyn Providence, refusing to release the official ballot results creates suspicion among the student body and undermines the process of free and fair elections.\n\nWhy is there not a student representative looking over the final votes? Why is the SGA administration keeping the winner secret?\n\nBy allowing McNeill and Lawson to co parent BSA, the SGA diminishes its role, making whoever holds office look like the winner of a sad participation trophy. Everybody wins! What’s even sadder than winning a participation trophy is not winning a participation trophy – my thoughts and prayers go out to Day’Shaun Barrett.\n\nHow can you expect to make the administration and foundation that already does not take student government seriously have an ounce of respect for the student body when they have Bert and Ernie representing them?\n\n“I also pushed for our SGA to be more serious…damn… a lot of members who were elected, …damn, this actually sounds crazy. A lot of members… damn. A lot of members that were elected kind of took it as a joke at first, and only a handful of students, in my opinion, took it seriously. So I wanna bring more seriousness and more officialness to our SGA,” Lawson says of the BSA foundation not taking SGA seriously.\n\nLawson continued, “because when people take it as a joke, and take it as like, you know, like, oh, blah, blah, blah, it kind of loses its value. And especially from an adults’ point of view. They’re reluctant, because they think, oh, these are kids, they can’t sit in on these meetings.”\n\nI did not edit these quotes: Lawson felt so strongly that he needed to say “damn” three times.\n\nThese two individuals sat down in a room and decided that instead of taking political responsibility over who lost and who won, they would rather the winner remain unknown so that they could both take office.\n\nMcNeill says, “Fear of the lack of political influence wasn’t ever a personal issue for me. If I lost, then I lost. I feel like this way we can both address the things that we were campaigning for while also having the support of each other for working and for reflections. I think we can tackle more issues with both of us there.”\n\nI personally believe that it will prove more difficult for both candidates to navigate their political duties whilst having to agree or compromise on everything.\n\nThere are two ways to fix this political disaster, both that were decided against by the candidates.\n\nA runoff between McNeill and Lawson takes place.\n\nWhoever won by four votes takes office.\n\nThese are not my original ideas, but the ideas presented at the sit down between Lawson and McNeill by Grouzard and Providence.\n\nA runoff would yield similar results because of how few votes Day’Shaun received, but that is still no reason to not have one as it sustains principles of democracy and allows the voices of all students to be heard.\n\nIt’s somewhat bizarre that one of the solutions to this problem is actually the very outcome we initially anticipated – the logical and intended result of this event – yet here we are.\n\nWhat will happen next time when a candidate wins by seven votes instead of four, will their opponent be outraged that there wasn’t some sort of co-president seance?\n\nLawson and McNeill’s reluctance to have a runoff or simply allow the real winner to be revealed makes it clear they would rather have this political calamity take place than face the idea that they might lose.\n\nI have respect for the SGA and its advisors, and I want to emphasize that this article does not intend to criticize them personally. However, I strongly believe that democratic procedures should be upheld in a democratic election.\n\nThe bottom line is that no matter how little SGA actually matters at BSA, students voted under the assumption that one president would be elected and represent them and that is not the way things played out.\n\nTo contact this writer, email Muse Newspaper at musebsa@bsfa.org.\n\nFeatured photo: Jamir Lawson and Chloe McNeill, the two SGA presidents. Photos by Asad Ali for the BSA Muse.\n\nBy: Scarlett O’Comartun and Jude Harvey\n\nMany students roam the halls of Baltimore School for the Art’s very own fourth floor. Said floor is home to some of BSA’s brightest teachers, for example, Valerie Johnson, Ileana Imhoff, and Maria Tronolone.\n\nBut how do students get to this sweet haven you might ask? And what does it say about them?\n\nMain stairway – Risk Takers\n\nThe main stairway is for people who are either going to get water in the middle of class or who have incredible amounts of patience. You have guts if you go up the main stairway.\n\nYou have top-notch behavior when going up or down this red carpet. It is the perfect place to show off the outfit you had planned the night before or strut your stuff in front of your hallway crush.\n\nAlthough it might not be avoidable, the main stairway is only safe in the dead middle of class periods. For if one attempts during transition periods, the possibility of tripping and ramming into another student’s crotch is enevedable. If you take these stairs, you are a risk taker.\n\nYou probably really like The 1975 or wear those slippers made of rubber golf balls. You have no fear and don’t mind the awkward smile you have to exchange when you bump into someone and they turn around to glare.\n\nThe only upside to the main stairway is when the devil has taken over you mid-academic class and your absolute quench for water becomes your main priority, then you can race down those main stairs like your life depends on it and feel that sweet paper rim on your tongue.\n\nThen those steps are like walking down a cloud. Or those foam slippers made out of rubber golf balls.\n\nBack stairway – Go Getters\n\nAlthough the back stairway may seem like a place to hike up your Y2K low rise jeans, eat an in-between class granola bar, or take a moment of peace, it’s not. Many people take this route, even though it’s shadowy and lacks renovations. Watch out for running into Mr. Ventimiglia.\n\nBut do take a second to stand and watch the choir class as they sing along to Mozart on the second floor through the tiny window.\n\nOn your way to your after-lunch classes, be sure to watch out for the hundreds of empty water containers right by the door; or are they modern art? We will never know. Stay clear!\n\nBe sure to be cautious when exiting to the first floor through these stairs because you will have to successfully navigate through the backrooms of the stage design and production department if you ever want to see the light of day again.\n\nMake sure to add the looming doom of the stage design room that you pass in between the first and second floor to your phobia list.\n\nYou also might bump into the occasional class-skippers who think they’re being sneaky by lurking in the shadows of the dark halls.\n\nIf you take the back stairway up, you’re a go-getter! A fast walker who just hates staring straight at people’s behinds as they move at a snail’s pace up the stairs. You enjoy the Silence of the Lambs aesthetic and find comfort in the Brazil-like, uncanny valley atmosphere.\n\nFront elevator – Newbies\n\nThe front elevator is located to your left as you walk through the front doors and is a well-lit and obvious way to get to the fourth floor. The ride takes you to many stops, including the second floor, for musicians who don’t like walking up the stairs.\n\nThis elevator is almost always jam-packed. If you are coming from a crowded class or lunch period, be prepared to be uncomfortably close to people, hear their music full blast through their earbuds (or with no earbuds at all!), or be turned away awkwardly by the already sardine-packed students in the elevator.\n\nAnd be sure to protect your sinuses from the whiffs of Ariana Grande perfume you will inhale. There will also be a stop at the third floor where people will complain about how it is not that far from the lower floors and students should just walk.\n\nIf you take this elevator, you are either more of a newbie or a teacher. You like the obvious way and have not yet learned, or simply do not care, that there are less stressful ways to make your way up to the fourth floor.\n\nBack elevator – Subtle Loners\n\nThe back elevator, which you can find to your right as you walk through the main doors, is more exclusive. Even though it’s in clear sight, people tend to forget about it due to the dim lighting.\n\nBut, if you learn the ways of it, you can learn to enjoy its fake wood paneling and slight smell. This lift’s basement stop also comes with a free show! Students get the joy of gawking at the set of abandoned washing machines as they wait somewhat patiently to hear those music-to-the-ear elevator dings.\n\nIf you take this elevator, you are more of a subtle loner. You enjoy the peace and quiet, but like seeing a few film students taking giant carts of film equipment down from the third floor.\n\nYou’re a mellow student, but probably take weekly trips to the nurse because you “have a migraine.”\n\nYou may be the kind of person who enjoys a bit of Arctic Monkeys or wears sweatshirts with niche pictures on them that only certain people would understand. You probably have Letterboxd and are sure to ask Mr. Roblin if he “ever had an emo phase” so you two can relate.\n\nThis is also the elevator that defiant visual artists slip into on their way to the top of the building in the morning in an attempt to get out of the routine bag checks. We see you!\n\nSPECIAL OPTION:\n\nMain stairs, film stairs, then main stairs – Free Spirit\n\nIf you decide to take the long way to the fourth floor, which is up the main staircase, through the music department, up the stairs leading to the film department, and then up the main stairs, you are a stroller.\n\nYou are a wanderer, a free spirit, and a nomad. You’re a real Jack Karouac, On The Road! You don’t need no schedule and no man!\n\nWhen given an icebreaker on the first day of school, such as two truths and a lie, one of them is definitely your star sign, and Never On Sunday is where you call home.\n\nYou are almost always late to class because it takes 15 minutes to go this way. Some of your favorite activities might include going to the bathroom during class and sitting on the toilet on your phone, starting BSA finest people instagram pages, and eating those smiley face french fries in the cafeteria.\n\nIn conclusion, we all fit one of these stereotypes, even if we would not like to admit it. And we most definitely all know the back stairway go-getter or a front elevator noob.\n\nSo next time, join those free birds on their way to the fourth floor. Or take a risk and walk down the main staircase at 3:51pm.\n\nWe can all find contentment in the fact that no matter what way, route, or mode of transportation students take to the fourth floor, We all have shortness of breath far into our next class.\n\nTo contact these writers email Muse Newspaper at musebsa@bsfa.org.\n\nPhotographs taken by Quinn Bryant for the BSA Muse.\n\nBy: Malik Savage\n\nTyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who lived in Memphis, Tennessee, was brutally assaulted and ultimately killed by five Memphis Police Department officers. The incident has reignited debate over the decades-long issue of police brutality, especially in the newer age of video and social media. After being captured on film by police body cameras and a nearby pole camera, footage of the encounter spread like wildfire on the news and social media. But what complicates this case is that all five officers involved in the killing were also Black: Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills, Emmitt Martin, Justin Smith, and Tadarrius Bean.\n\nThis cuts against the routine narrative of excessive, targeted police violence simply being the result of individual or interpersonal racism; in other words, the “bad apples” in a good system. After George Floyd’s death at the hands of officer Derek Chauvin, then-National Security Advisor for the Trump Administration Robert C. O’Brien took to CNN to say, “We have got great law enforcement officers, not the few bad apples, like the officer that killed George Floyd. But we got a few bad apples that have given law enforcement a bad name; 99.9 percent of these guys are heroes. […] I think they’re the minority. […] and we need to root them out.”\n\nThe danger of this argument not only lies in its dismissiveness of the issue, but also in its shift of blame. In his statement, O’Brien had no issue seeing that Chauvin be blamed for Floyd’s death, but while personal accountability is especially important, it can remove focus from the bigger picture: the system. If one only focuses on the individual, nothing else changes. The idea that these cases of excessive police violence are incidental encourage complacency in small steps toward progress. The firings and arrests of these officers does offer a sense of justice, but it doesn’t dismantle the system that produced them. It is not only necessary that we remove the bad apples, but that we also chop down the tree responsible for their initial growth.\n\nNewer cops who join the force are compelled, if not trained, to assimilate into that police culture, pushing their limits of authority to the extreme. But the officers who killed Tyre Nichols were not new; all five had been employed in the Memphis Police Department since 2020 (Haley and Bean), 2018 (Martin and Smith), and 2017 (Mills). These are notions embedded into an officer’s psyche early into their career, so consequences only propagate as time goes on.\n\nThis span of consequence from police culture—from the direct permissiveness of violence to an overall lack of accountability—calls for public action. For insulation to be disrupted, the force must come from outside. A way in which individuals can help disrupt this is to watch the videos that are released of these encounters in order to combat the policing culture that allows excessive violence to pervade and go unpunished. However, the funnel through which the video is being seen is an important caveat. In today’s age, the spread of misinformation runs rampant on the Internet, and spreads well beyond the heart-wrenching genre of unequivocal police violence footage, admitting space for false narratives. On the opposite end of the spectrum, social media—especially Twitter—allows for videos to be uploaded with very little to no context, so people are inclined to make uninformed judgments. This is also harmful to the cause of dismantling the police system.\n\nOne sound way of receiving information regarding police encounters is through visual investigations and articles, such as coverage by the New York Times. Robin Stein, Alexander Cardia, and Natalie Reneau’s “71 Commands in 13 Minutes” is an article which analyzed the videos released of Nichols’s encounter, offering detailed information and context necessary to form illuminated judgments, all without even having to watch it. The Times has also released investigative coverage on the cases of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Ahmaud Arbery. When researching such disputed information, it is important to make the distinction between whether it is being distributed with the intention to enlighten, or to push a particular agenda.\n\nAlthough difficult, this is how the system can be worked against from outside. An institution designed for public safety cannot be allowed to operate largely in private, especially in such a culture of protecting and promoting officers prone to violence.\n\nTo contact this writer, email Muse Newspaper at musebsa@bsfa.org.\n\nHeadline photo credit goes to Gerald Herbert for the Dallas Morning News.\n\nBy: Mia Curtis for the BSA Muse\n\nDisclaimer: This is meant purely for entertainment purposes and is in no way directed toward our lunch staff at BSA, who we appreciate for their hard work preparing food for us every day.\n\nPizza\n\nEasily the most popular lunch at BSA, the pizza is a familiar and comforting break from the typical cafeteria food. Everyone knows what pizza is. Just about everyone has had a slice or two in their life. The cafeteria used to serve a different kind of pizza seemingly every-other week. I’m sure most people remember the mini circle pizzas and the square slices however, recently, they’ve stuck to one type of pizza, which has come with some upsides as well as downsides.\n\nOf course, It’s pizza. It’s very likely the most looked-forward to lunch on the whole cafeteria menu. However, it has some problems. The first, and biggest of these problems is definitely sauce inconsistency. One minute, you’ll be biting into a nice normal slice of pizza, and the next it’s just cheese bread. Sauce is a vital part of pizza and a lack of sauce destroys the pizza’s appeal. There are some smaller issues such as the uncanny flavor of the sauce as it sits in an odd place between sweet and savor or the sauce to crust ratio, but they are inconsequential in the shadow of sauce inconsistency.\n\nDespite these issues, we’ll focus on the positives as they outway any criticism. First of all, temperature, the pizza’s always hot when it’s served. There’s plenty of cheese and it’s just the right amount of crust to hold the pizza together. It is not super greasy, but it isn’t dry either. The pizza isn’t anything groundbreaking or particularly special but, it’s a slice of pizza and that’s all it needs to be.\n\nFried Chicken\n\nRecently, the kitchen has added a new meal to its menu: the fried chicken drumstick. This dish is typically served alongside french fries or steamed corn. The new lunch option has proven controversial, as it has caused division among students. Some enjoy the lunch, commenting on its crispy exterior and apparently tender inside. Others liken the fried chicken to “fried rat,” expressing a pointed distaste for the meal and its appearance.\n\nAs someone who has never personally tried the fried chicken drumstick, I asked several students about their personal opinions on its quality. Blanche Brody, a Junior actor says “It’s interesting. It could be a lot different, but it sure is chicken”.\n\nPorch Longshore, another junior actor, has a similar opinion as they state “It’s a solid 2/10. It has some good parts, mostly it is very bad”.\n\nSolidifying the generally negative views of the fried chicken, Alessandra Brown, a junior dancer says “I’d say it could be a lot worse. However, it’s also not my favorite, and on days that there is fried chicken in the cafeteria, I will usually get anything else they’re offering… it’s just kinda greasy.”\n\nFinally, Ella Haber, a junior visual artist, describes the dish as being “like a fried clump.” She goes on to call it “a mystery box” because “You open it up and it’s like there’s a bunch of veins and fatty little clumps. My fork broke inside of it and that says something about the chicken.”\n\nChicken Patty\n\nAside from pizza, the chicken patty sandwich has become a favorite among students. With its presentation and appearance it creates a welcoming first impression of a simple chicken sandwich. The meal is appealing both in looks and taste. The chicken is consistent throughout the patty, it’s tenderness is balanced with a slightly crispy exterior which adds a satisfiying crunch. The bun, despite only being wheat bread, compliments the patty well in texture and taste which completes to the dining experience of the chicken sandwich as a whole.\n\nThe slight sweetness of the chicken is balanced well with the bland profile of the bun. The crispy chicken exterior and tender chicken interior are paired well with the soft, barely stale bread. Overall, the chicken sandwich is and will continue to be a strong favorite in the cafeteria.\n\nDeli Sandwich\n\nIn the first couple of weeks of the school year, the kitchen served only cold foods. The most common of which was the deli sandwich. There’s nothing special about the sandwich, but it serves as an excellent go-to when you want something quick and easy to eat.\n\nThe deli sandwich typically consists of a hoagie roll, American cheese, and some type of lunch meat, usually ham or bologna. On one or two rare occasions, the deli sandwich has been served with lettuce. It’s a staple lunch food and fits perfectly into the school cafeteria setting. The bread, surprisingly, doesn’t seem to be whole wheat, and the meats and cheese aren’t bad. Sure, american cheese creates an odd texture in the cold sandwich, but ultimately it makes sense.\n\nPeanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich\n\nPeanut butter and jelly. A classic sandwich combo and a sandwich most kids will have eaten before graduating elementary school. The cafeteria makes all the right choices when it comes to PB & J. First, creamy peanut butter. As any respectable critic knows, peanut butter can make or break a quality PB & J. As I always say, “When in doubt, creamy peanut butter sorts it out.” While crunchy peanut butter has potential, often providing a new texture to the familiar sandwich, it proves to be too abrasive for many students. This makes it a poor candidate for cafeteria food, which should ideally appeal to as many students as possible.\n\nIn the interest of catering to many students, sun butter sandwiches are also available for students with nut allergies. Due to the nature of a PB & J, pre-assembly of the sandwich is a bad move – the jelly would deep into the bread, creating a soggy, unpleasant dining experience. The cafeteria sidesteps this issue by separating the bread from the peanut butter and jelly, in turn allowing students to apply their preferred amount of peanut butter or jelly to the bread.\n\nThis article was submitted to the BSA Muse by an external contributor.
