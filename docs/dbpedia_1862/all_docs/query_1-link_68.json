        "text": "The synth pop song 'Hvrt (Feat. Casey Desmond)' by US artist 'CARV.R' is an extremely melod­ic piece, for the oth­er­wise rather grim dark synth sound of the artist. Listening to the latest releases, I have noticed that the songs with the guest sing­ers enhance the sound of \"CARV.R\" enormously.\n\nThis is also the case with 'Hvrt' (Hurt). The synths have a cer­tain snap­pi­ness and are beau­ti­fully crisp. Mixed with the har­mo­ni­ous, soft vocals of Casey Desmond, the com­pos­i­tion is just com­plete, sat­ur­ated and gives the song just enough pop to make the song pleas­ing. I really like it!\n\nThis song is part of our Spotify playl­ist ‘New Synth Pop Songs 2022‘. The playl­ist is updated con­tinu­ously. Follow this playl­ist now and don’t miss any of the latest synth pop hits in 2022.\n\nListen to 'CARV.R – Hvrt (Feat. Casey Desmond)' on Spotify\n\nListen to 'CARV.R – Hvrt (Feat. Casey Desmond)' on Bandcamp\n\nHvrt (Feat. Casey Desmond) by Casey Desmond\n\nLyrics of 'CARV.R – Hvrt (Feat. Casey Desmond)'\n\nWe piss and moan\n\nDon’t get along\n\nYou’re stub­born like a stone\n\nAnd you don’t like my tone\n\nWe battle at midnight\n\nEach word is a choke\n\nI nev­er want to fight\n\nI’m bet­ter off alone\n\nYou know I couldn’t and I had to escape\n\nI saw you gun­ning when I run away\n\nWhy do we hurt the ones we love?\n\nI keep on fall­ing when I see your face\n\nI wouldn’t have it any oth­er way\n\nWhy do we hurt the ones we love\n\nThe push and pull\n\nThe pain fulfills\n\nYou beat me down until\n\nThere’s no one at the helm\n\nWalking on such a thin line\n\nI’m want­ing you still\n\nYou come in for the kill\n\nAnd all against my will\n\nYou know I couldn’t and I had to escape\n\nI saw you gun­ning when I run away\n\nWhy do we hurt the ones we love?\n\nI keep on fall­ing when I see your face\n\nI wouldn’t have it any oth­er way\n\nWhy do we hurt the ones we love\n\nCARV.R about 'Hvrt'\n\nHVRT the new track by CARV.R fea­tur­ing Casey Desmond plunges the listen­er into a ret­ro­fur­tur­ist­ic, swirl­ing under­tow abet­ted by com­plic­ated reverb tinged per­cus­sion and addict­ive melod­ic hooks. The haunt­ing synth melod­ies are entwined with the radi­ant vocals of Casey and the enthralling accom­pa­ny­ing vocal har­mon­ies of CARV.R. There is indeed some­thing unset­tling, yet enti­cing, about the clev­er jux­ta­pos­i­tion of the plead­ing and ques­tion­ing lyr­ics with buoy­ant vocals and CARV.R’s com­plex, layered synth sound­scape. HVRT is an incred­ible evol­u­tion and fusion of dark synth ele­ments trans­port­ing the listen­er to an altern­at­ive and sat­is­fy­ing timeline while explor­ing the clouded aspects of dys­func­tion­al­ity that occur some­times with those that we love."
