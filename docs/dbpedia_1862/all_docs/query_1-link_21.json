        "text": "You could forgive Casey Desmond for stealing away to Cape Cod for a restorative vacation these past few weeks. The girl’s been busy.\n\nHaving wrapped a stint on NBC’s “The Voice” – where her teammate on Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine’s team, Javier Colon, went all the way – Desmond is finally looking to finish a new album, which will be her first since 2008.\n\n“The people I met were amazing,” Desmond said of her time on the hit show. “Everyone I met on that show had their stuff together and it was inspiring to be stuck in a hotel room with them because you get wrapped up in this musical world with people who have similar goals to you. It gets you really excited, even though at first, it’s ‘This person does country,’ or ‘This person does R&B.’”\n\nMuch like Colon, Desmond said she had to be convinced to audition. “The Voice,” she agreed, was in its first season and thus completely new and untrusted.\n\n“I never wanted to do ‘American Idol,’ but they weren’t really looking for drama, they were looking for real artists,” she said. “So I went for it.”\n\nThe show helped re-ignite her buzz, Desmond said, and she now has new management and is finally pushing forward to finish the as-yet-untitled new album. She’s found a strong partner in Robert Ellis Orrall, the Winthrop-bred, now Nashville-based veteran songwriter co-writing many of Desmond’s newer material, including her recent “Talking to God.”\n\nHer musical pursuits aren’t limited to singing and songwriting, either; of late, Desmond’s been re-mixing songs by local artists and friends.\n\nDesmond, of course, has other inspiration, too: local musician and Sudbury native Robbie Lordi, to whom she became engaged during a road trip to New Orleans last year."
