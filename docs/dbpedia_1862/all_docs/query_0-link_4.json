What is considered pop music varies greatly depending on the year (or possibly time of day), the place, and the person answering the question.\n\nThe Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (original 1983 edition) says\n\n\"Pop is the melodic side of rock -- the legacy of show tunes and popular songs of the prerock era. Pop's standards of what makes a well-constructed song still apply to much of rock, which strives for memorable tunes and clear sentiments; the tension between pop virtues (such as sophisticated chord structures and unusual melodic twists), and incantatory, formulaic blues elements animates much of the best rock, like that of the Beatles.\"\n\nNot bad. But perhaps not complete enough (and over 20 years old, though more current descriptions are not necessarily better). Pop includes \"power pop\" and \"pop/rock,\" but is not limited to those. Most music described as \"Beatlesque\" is considered pop. Pop music can be based on any number of styles, including folk, country, punk, blues, reggae, garage rock, as well as many others. That doesn't mean that everything in those categories are pop, but some things are. It can rock hard or not at all, though having a melody (often with hooks) is generally a necessary component.\n\nBut what it basically comes down to, adapting Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's words regarding pornography, is \"I know it when I hear it.\"\n\nYou can check out NE PopFest 2006, NE PopFest 2005 and NE PopFest 2004 by clicking these links or the posters below.\n\nFor more information about the festival, visit the NE PopFest FAQ page.\n\n[ PopFest Home ] [ PopFest FAQ ]\n\nTo get email address, enter verification code then click here."
