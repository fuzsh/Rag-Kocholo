        "text": "Ian Desmond. It may not be fair to Colorado Rockies fans but I’m starting my review of their favorite team discussing Ian Desmond. It may seem like a weird topic to begin on, but Desmond and the 2017 Rockies will always go hand in hand in my memory.\n\nDesmond has had a… strange MLB journey. After putting together three consecutive seasons of at least four fWAR, he sputtered during 2015 in a contract year. The team he came up with, the Washington Nationals, did extend him a qualifying offer, but Desmond chose to enter free agency.\n\nDesmond was a cautionary tale for free agents receiving qualifying offers on a down year. No one had ever accepted a qualifying offer through 2015, so Desmond was simply reacting per the norm, but he had significant trouble finding a suitor. Perhaps it had to do with the first round pick attached to him (any team outside of the top ten picks who signed Desmond would have to forfeit their top pick), but the then-30-year-old sat and waited for a contract he deemed fit for his value.\n\nDesmond eventually had to wait and sign with the Texas Rangers on a one-year, $8 million prove-it contract — a far cry from where he and his agent had believed they were set to earn. To add to the controversy, the Rangers were set at the shortstop position. The team announced they were going to move Desmond to the outfield.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, Desmond started the season incredibly strong. He must have been motivated to prove all teams who passed on him they made a mistake. He made the all-star team — as an outfielder — for his first-half efforts.\n\nDesmond did fall off quite a bit in the second half, enough for the Rangers not to extend him. He was again given a qualifying offer at the end of the season… and again rejected it.\n\nBut this time he was able to find his suitor… and I have brought this tangent back to the Rockies. Colorado certainly did not want their target to choose elsewhere; the man who couldn’t find a lengthy contract from any team just a year ago was given five years and $70 million. The price, and years, weren’t all the Rockies were giving up. Due to Desmond receiving a qualifying offer, the Rockies had to give up their first round pick as long as it wasn’t in the top 10. But Colorado had “earned” the 11th pick in the draft. They had to give up the highest possible pick a team could in the qualifying offer system.\n\nThese aren’t the only specifics of this story that will last long in my brain. The Rockies had their outfield set going into the 2017 season; Charlie Blackmon and Carlos Gonzalez in two of the spots and between Gerardo Parra and top prospects David Dahl and Raimel Tapia, the other spot was covered.\n\nShortstop wasn’t an option for Desmond either as Trevor Story was entering his sophomore season after a breakout rookie campaign.\n\nThe Rockies announced they were moving Desmond to first base. They paid $70 million and five years for a guy to play a position he had never played before. A position usually designated for power was given to a guy who had never hit more than 25 home runs. I couldn’t let this get out of my head.\n\nThe Rockies were in a pivotal season in 2017. They had enough talent on the team to make some noise but the construction seemed a bit off. Gonzalez was on his last year of the contract, Blackmon had two years left, and Nolan Arenado had only three years remaining. A young pitching staff had begun prospering in 2016, perhaps ready to move the team into contention heading into 2017.\n\nWith the window closing on the position player stars with the hope of the window just opening for the pitching staff, more of an effort to match the two seemed like it would have been a smart move.\n\nInstead, the Rockies went the Desmond route and spent a lot of money on their bullpen. It’s hard to critique them too hard because a postseason berth was achieved in 2017. Behind MVP efforts from two stars, Colorado was able to hold off St. Louis and Milwaukee to get into the one-game Wild Card playoff.\n\nDid The Roster Meet Expectations?\n\nThe Rockies lineup wasn’t necessarily projected to be “stars and scrubs,” but they turned out succeeding with the strategy. Injuries kept Desmond and Dahl out of the lineup and Tapia never consistently stuck in the lineup. With Gonzalez having the worst season of his career, the depth in the outfield completely disappeared.\n\nThe middle infield duo of DJ LeMahieu and Trevor Story both dropped in production from their previous year significantly. The late-offseason re-signing of Mark Reynolds turned out to save the Rockies quite a bit as he was productive enough for a backup first baseman.\n\nCatcher was a complete failure until the deadline trade for Jonathan Lucroy stabilized the spot for a few months.\n\nBut luckily the lineup was completely carried by Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado. Both were among the crowded group worthy of NL MVP consideration. No position player duo in the National League was worth more fWAR than the Rockies third baseman and center fielder. Of course the team had to be pleased with their star players’ performances, but one has to wonder if their career years were somewhat wasted as they were not able to achieve a large amount of success.\n\nThe youth of the rotation allowed a wide array of projections the majority of which they surpassed. Even when held to 110 innings pitched, Jon Gray showed the capability of being an ace in the future. German Marquez and Kyle Freeland were both able to put up 150+ quality innings, a remarkable accomplishment pitching half their games at Coors Field.\n\nChad Bettis’s 2017 journey is an incredible story and getting any contribution from him coming back from cancer was as improbable as it was uplifting.\n\nTyler Chatwood and Tyler Anderson were the pitchers who fell on the downside of those wide projections, but it was nearly impossible for everyone on the staff to “hit”.\n\nThe Rockies first-half success was largely accredited to a great performance from the bullpen. They were a little over-taxed, again due to the young rotation (and Coors), and their numbers did begin to drop after the all-star break. Another smart deadline move to go out and get Pat Neshek helped take some of the weight off the heavily-used arms.\n\nGreg Holland was one of the best gambles of the offseason; Mike Dunn was far from. Adam Ottavino and Carlos Estevez didn’t quite take their next step, but Jake McGee was more than just a LOOGY in his walk year.\n\nIt’s not really possible to give a yes-or-no answer if the roster exceeded expectations. It missed in a lot of areas, but much like the entire season, a lot of wrongs were forgiven by Blackmon and Arenado.\n\nBarrel Stats\n\nBarrels by Rockies hitters — 201 (12th in NL, 27th in MLB); Barrel/PA — 3.24% (13th in NL, 28th in MLB)\n\nTop barrel hitters:\n\n· Charlie Blackmon — 43 (5.93% (per PA))\n\n· Nolan Arenado — 41 (6.03%)\n\n· Trevor Story — 30 (5.41%)\n\nBarrels allowed by all Rockies pitchers — 221 (third in NL, fourth in MLB)\n\nBarrel FIP by all Rockies pitchers — 4.24 (seventh in NL, 13th in MLB)\n\nBarrel FIP by Rockies bullpen — 3.92 (second in NL, eighth in MLB)\n\nTop Barrel FIP (starters)\n\n· Jon Gray — 3.35\n\n· Tyler Anderson — 4.31\n\n· German Marquez — 4.40\n\nTop Barrel FIP (relievers)\n\n· Jake McGee — 3.24\n\n· Greg Holland — 3.35\n\n· Scott Oberg — 3.60\n\nHighlighted Stat\n\nWe all know about the “Coors effect,” and no, I’m not talking beer here. It’s become a common Twitter joke to attribute any out-of-the-norm numbers occurring at the Rockies home park to simply, #Coors.\n\nIf you’re reading this article, there’s no doubt you’re aware of the thin air experienced due to Denver having near-mile high elevation above sea level which allows baseballs to fly farther. Rockies hitters and numbers are thus susceptible to large effects on their statistics due to home runs being “easier” to come by.\n\nBefore we go any further, I’d like to set a definition. For this study, I compiled all balls hit labeled a line drive or fly ball per BaseballSavant.com (the database which stores all Statcast tracking numbers). I eliminated pop-ups from the study because I was aiming to get the population of all hard-hit balls, taking out the “can-of-corns”. Baseball Savant also allows the capability to remove line drives hit to an infielder; for this story’s purpose, I have removed those as well. I will simply label these types of hits as LD/FB (line drives and fly balls).\n\nWould it surprise you Coors had only the 13th highest ratio of home runs to LD/FB in MLB last season? Yes, fly balls go farther in the thin air of Denver, but Coors also has large perimeters in an attempt to corral a percentage of those “helped” deep balls.\n\nNot only do Rockies pitchers have to try to keep batted balls down in fear of leaving the yard, but also to help their outfielders from running all over that vast perimeter.\n\nOf all LD/FB hit in 2017, Coors had the lowest catch percentage — or balls converted to outs — in all of baseball by a significant margin. Only 50.5 percent of LD/FB were caught at Coors (both by Rockies and opponents). The next lowest catch percentage by stadium was Wrigley Field at 54.5 percent. MLB average for 2017 was 57.7 percent.\n\nNow where my mind went to first was what if the Rockies just had a subpar outfield defense? They did rank slightly below average according to Fangraphs’ outfield UZR (17th in MLB). According to the LD/FB study, no team was better by a larger margin on the road in catch percentage than the Rockies. (They had the 11th highest road catch percentage in MLB). It also wasn’t close — Colorado was eight percentage points better away from Coors; the next closest team was the Boston Red Sox at just above four percentage points.\n\nAnother data point I pulled was how opponents fared in the same ballpark. Rockies opponents also had a 50.5 catch percentage at Coors, however, making that argument moot. The ball park affected both the home and road teams nearly equally.\n\nBy this study, it does seem that the Rockies outfield defense certainly held their own, but were harmed by their ball park more than anything else. Again, the strategy does seem to point Rockies pitchers have to do their best to keep the ball out of the air when they’re pitching at their home park.\n\nFortunately for the Rockies front office, they did a pretty good job at finding guys to do exactly that. Rockies pitchers allowed the highest groundball rate of any team in baseball at 48.5 percent. They did an even better job at home; their 51.8 percent ground ball rate at home also led all of baseball.\n\n*I’m planning on extending this study of catch percentage in its own piece, which should post in the near future. Once posted, I’ll link it here.*\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nThe Rockies have been one of the more active teams thus far in the offseason, but mostly in one specific way. Colorado thrived in the first half in large part due to an excellent bullpen; they look to be planning on doubling down with the same strategy in 2018.\n\nThey began the offseason by bringing in the 30-year-old Bryan Shaw, who has spent most of his career somewhat under the radar with the Cleveland Indians. Shaw’s most impressive attribute — his 2017 55.9 percent ground ball rate. Along with a six percent walk rate, Shaw seems like a perfect fit to call Coors his home\n\nThey then re-signed McGee to make sure they have a proven left-handed reliever when needed before recently bringing in Wade Davis. McGee nor Davis has as impressive of ground ball rates as Shaw, but will serve their own purpose. McGee will continue as a LOOGY specialist, while Davis has the experience of closing out ball games on a contender as he showed last season in Chicago. The Davis signing seems similar to the Greg Holland signing of last season, and the Rockies hope for the same success.\n\nAs for the offense, there needs to be a bit more power in the lineup, along with more consistent production throughout. Yes, I started this piece out criticizing the Desmond signing, but he does have the ability to prove me wrong (slightly — there’s no way that signing ever pans out).\n\nThe big concern with Desmond is if he can stay healthy for a whole season and the same concern exists with the return of Dahl. There’s a possibility if Desmond slates in at first and Dahl replaces Gonzalez seamlessly (the 2016 version), this can be an above-average MLB lineup.\n\nThe other big move the Rockies made this offseason is the acquisition of Chris Iannetta to plug in the catcher position, which mostly disappointed a season ago. Iannetta is one of the better offensive catchers in the game and will fill out some of the consistency needed in the bottom of the lineup.\n\nMaybe the Rockies surprise and make a move for a power bat to put at first and shift Desmond back to the outfield to help the depth there. Or perhaps a similar move could be made for a corner outfielder, but don’t forget the amount of ground each man has to cover out there at Coors. Can’t just plug in a power guy and not expect to lose a lot of defensive protection."
