        "text": "Interviews\n\nBiscuits with Shelby Williams!\n\nStandard\n\nOne of the things that us dancers have always struggled with, is feeling less than par. Sometimes, it ends up being the downfall of our career as a student. We spend hours in front of a mirror, so that is more than enough time to tear ourselves down. We are being compared to our fellow dancers in auditions for coveted spots. As human nature, we can become jealous and bitter, if we don’t muster up that confidence in our self.\n\nShelby Williams has now become the poster child for finding that inner confidence and being able to laugh at yourself! You all know and love her as BiscuitBallerina on Instagram. She is a dancer with The Royal Ballet of Flanders. I am such an advocate for finding your own beauty, so I reached out to her to help spread our message of self love and acceptance!\n\nDanceTchrProbs: Hi Shelby! Thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to share your story with me and my followers! First off, tell us about yourself! Where did you grow up and where did you train?\n\nBiscuitBallerina: I am from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I started off with dance in a local studio called 2M’s where I attended ballet and tap/jazz once a week. When I was 11, I became more serious about my ballet training at The Dancer’s Workshop, where I stayed until I was 15. My sophomore year of high school, I moved to Washington D.C. to attend the Washington School of Ballet for 1 year, followed by 3 years in Houston in the Houston Ballet Academy and Houston Ballet II.\n\nDTP: What were your aspirations as a young dancer?\n\nBB: As a young dancer, I wasn’t gifted with the best facility for ballet (inflexible with knees that wouldn’t straighten and feet that wouldn’t point), so most of the positive attention I got as a student was from being quick to learn things. This led me to understudy a lot of parts in school productions even if I wasn’t necessarily suited for them, all because my teachers trusted me to jump in for something last minute and know it in case someone got injured. The variety that came with such responsibility was interesting to me, so I soon figured out that if I was going to be a professional dancer, I wanted to be one in a company where I could have as much diversity in my work as possible.\n\nDTP: Did you ever compete as a kid? What circuit(s)?\n\nBB: I didn’t go to a competition school ever, but I did compete in YAGP twice. Once in the junior division and once in the senior division. I didn’t make it to the New York finals either time!\n\nDTP: What were your favorite moments as a young dancer?\n\nBB: My favorite moments as a young dancer were the times I got to watch professional dancers rehearse and perform. Seeing how the professionals would constantly work on the details of things made them so relatable and gave me so much hope and inspiration for my future as a dancer. Summer intensives were also so thrilling! It was an amazing feeling to be in a new city surrounded by peers who were just as enthusiastic about dancing as I was.\n\nDTP: You talked about how great your Summer intensive experiences were. What intensives did you attend and which were your favorites? Why?\n\nBB: The first summer intensive I attended was a very small week long one in New Orleans when I was 12, followed by 3 summers at ABT’s programs (the first in Austin, TX, and then 2 summers in NYC), 1 summer at Kaatsbaan, and 3 summers at Houston Ballet’s summer intensive. They were all special in their own way. The first in New Orleans was a great place to start for me because I had never danced all day like that before, but because it was only a week, I wasn’t too overwhelmed. I remember loving for the first time feeling of being completely immersed in dance. I adored my summers with ABT because I got to see so many of the stars I admired perform and even had a few teach class. New York is also just so thrilling I felt like I saw a lifetime of shows while there and would even go take class at Steps on our day off just to feel more of the NYC dance scene buzz. In the end, Houston Ballet was my favorite because it seemed to be the most rigorous program out of the ones I’d experienced. I was hungry to learn and wanted to be pushed as much as possible, and Houston Ballet certainly did that. It’s why I chose to stay there year round after the summer intensive ended.\n\nDTP: Tell us a bit about your daily routine as a company member of Royal Ballet of Flanders?\n\nBB: We start our work day at 10:00 AM with an hour and a half technique class followed by a 15 minute break. We then have rehearsals for whatever program is coming up until 5:30 with an hour lunch break usually around 2:00 PM and a 15 minute break somewhere in the afternoon. Once a week I have a Dutch class in the morning before work, which is provided by my company (Dutch is the language spoken in Flanders, the part of Belgium where I live). At the end of the day, I usually try to stay in the studio for at least 15 minutes and stretch out a bit before heading home, and once a week I’ll linger a bit longer and film a couple of things for Biscuit Ballerina.\n\nDTP: What are some of your favorite ballets and variations to watch and or perform?\n\nBB: As far as classical ballets go, I’m a fan of La Bayadere and Don Q. Gamzatti used to be my dream role and the Kingdom of the Shades can be stunning. I just love the sass and playfulness that comes with all of the character in Don Q. I go all fan girl for many recreations of the classics though. I adore the productions of Giselle by Mats Ek and David Dawson. Each of them came up with their own reinterpretation of the story and portrayed it beautifully in a new way that was more relevant to today. I’m just dying to see the new production of Giselle by Akram Khan after hearing all about it from friends!\n\nDTP: Who are some dancers and choreographers that you look up to? Any favorite companies, aside from your own?\n\nBB: There are too many to name! I love any seeing any dancer who brings their personality to the stage. Dancers that make me feel as if I’m watching them in their natural habitat rather than in a show are the ones that I can’t take my eyes off of. As far as choreographers go, I am a huge fan of William Forsythe’s work. It’s evolved so much over several decades and I love to seeing the different aspects of dance and theater which he explored and continues to explore over such a long career. Seeing his recent piece, “Blake Works” at the Paris Opera left me wanting to groove my way out of the opera house. I also really enjoy both seeing and performing works by my artistic director, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. The way he curates all aspects of a piece to come together brings emphasis to the fact that all parts of a performance are art, not just the choreography, and they should all contribute equally to the meaning of the piece. It pulls me into both the analytical and spiritual side of dance. Companies that I always enjoy seeing are Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, Hofesh Shechter Company, and American Ballet Theater. Pina Bausch’s work just taps so deeply into human emotions and experiences that you can’t help but have it resonate with you somehow. When I see Hofesh Shechter’s dancers perform, I get the feeling that with each pulse, the blood rushing through their veins is telling their bodies they have to dance; it all looks so impulsive in them most addictive way possible. Since I was a young student, there has always been something magical about ABT, especially in full length classics. Their production of “Romeo and Juliet” featuring Alessandra Ferri was the first performance to ever move me to tears when I was 14.\n\nDTP: Did you ever receive a piece of advice from any of your teachers while training that has stuck with you?\n\nBB: When I was in Houston Ballet II, my director Claudio Munoz told me something that stuck with me. He pointed out that I’m not your typical ballerina who will succeed based on the shape of my legs and feet or my flexibility. I initially took this as an insult, but then he continued. He said that I had a knack for neoclassical and contemporary work because of my athleticism and curiosity, which was a strength even as a ballet dancer. He told me I shouldn’t fight my strengths just because it’s not what is typically expected of a ballerina, but rather embrace them and find ways to use them to my advantage. I think this is true of any style of dance (or any profession really!); there will always be the staple skills or qualities which typically allow someone to succeed, but we shouldn’t let the norms prevent us from recognizing our unique traits which we have to offer. I took his advice to heart and continued to explore the possibilities of both ballet and contemporary dance throughout my career and I am so happy I did! I can continue to work on that which doesn’t come naturally, but I am also able to enjoy utilizing my other strengths as well, and be proud of it. I’ve recently been promoted from the corps de ballet to soloist, and I can say for a fact it was because of my atypical strengths rather than the cookie cutter traits which we are often pressured to have.\n\nDTP: What or who has been the biggest inspiration in your life, either dance or personal life?\n\nBB: My parents have been a huge inspiration to me, and have never discouraged me from pursuing something if I really wanted it. They really instilled in me the belief that if you’re truly passionate about something, the possibilities are endless.\n\nDTP: So let’s talk about Biscuit Ballerina! When did you start the account?\n\nBB: I started Biscuit Ballerina at the end of August 2017. It still blows my mind that it has grown so quickly!\n\nDTP: Oh, wow! It has definitely blown up! Tell us about how and why you started Biscuit Ballerina? How do you feel it has helped you both as a person and as a dancer?\n\nBB: Biscuit Ballerina started as a way for me to cope with facing my own imperfections on a daily basis as a student. Being in front of a mirror all day while also lined up next to your peers isn’t the easiest for a teenager to deal with. When I would start to be too hard on myself or couldn’t get out of a negative mental state, I would exaggerate all the mistakes I was being called out for in order to find the humor in them, be able to giggle a little bit, and then get back to the serious work with some of the weight of my own self criticism lifted off of my shoulders. It has stuck with my throughout my career and had helped me to be a much happier dancer who appreciates my quirks much more than I think I ever would have had I not found the humor in them. I think it has also helped make feelings of jealousy less prominent, which is always a struggle in such a competitive profession.\n\nDTP: If you could dance on any stage, with any artist or dancer, who would it be and why?\n\nBB: I would love to dance to music played by Yo-Yo Ma on any one of the outdoor theaters in Italy. I’m so moved by the sound of the cello and Yo-Yo Ma is a legend. The only way the euphoric feeling of dancing to great music could be intensified would be by being outside with fresh air and sunshine!\n\nDTP: What advice do you have for young dancers?\n\nBB: Never forget why you dance. When we don’t allow ourselves as dancers to remember what it is about dance that brings us joy, it just becomes tedious work. Also, always be respectful. Anytime some makes the effort to give you a correction, they deserve at least enough of your respect to be heard and considered.\n\nDTP: Give us 5 random facts about yourself!\n\nBB: 1. I speak German, French, a little Dutch, and fabulous Spanglish.\n\n2. I once was stranded in France after an audition and all flights were cancelled, so I took 28 hours of train travel back to the opposite side of Germany, arriving in the morning on a Sunday in time for a Sunday matinee performance of La Bayadere. I was exhausted, but adrenaline got me through!\n\n3. I wear Freed of London classic pointe shoes.\n\n4. I trip on the street all of the time. I have friends who aren’t dancers who ask me how I can be so graceful on stage but so clumsy in the real world.\n\n5. I make my own ice cream! I love getting creative and some of my favorite flavors are chai tea ice cream and pumpkin caramelized pecan ice cream.\n\nI am so excited for you all to fall more and more in love with Biscuit Ballerina! I absolutely loved getting to know her more! Shelby recently launched her website, http://www.BiscuitBallerina.com, so check that out! Be sure follow BiscuitBallerina and Sheby’s personal account, ShelbysBiscuitLife on Instagram. Thank you so much for reading!\n\nXOXO,\n\nDanceTchrProbs\n\nThree Cheers For Carisa!\n\nStandard\n\nThere are so many avenues in which to take after being a trained dancer. You can go to New York and audition for a new contemporary company. You can move to Los Angeles and be a back up dancer for some of the world’s biggest stars. You can become a teacher. You can transition into choreography. You can even be a dancer and root on professional athlete’s.\n\nI feel that unfortunately, some professional teams aren’t taken seriously. They are seen more as cheerleaders or meat for the fans to look at, etc. But I know first hand, that these girls on these teams work just as hard as any other professional dancer. I was recently followed by Carisa McMilan and quickly made contact with her because she is a retired Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders is one of America’s biggest and most respected professional dance teams so I jumped at the chance to interview her and shed some light on the professional team environment and what it takes to make their roster!\n\nWithout further ado, here is my interview with Carisa!\n\nDanceTchrProbs: Hi, Carisa! Thank you so much for taking some time out of your schedule to interview with me! I know my readers and I appreciate it! Give us a little bit of background on your training as a student.\n\nCarisa McMilan: I started taking ballet, tap, and jazz classes at the age of three. My childhood dream was to become a principal dancer for the New York City Ballet. I received my first pair of pointe shoes at the early age of nine. When I was 10, my family moved to Kentucky. I continued my training in all three styles, with a strong focus in ballet at the Louisville Ballet School. There, I was cast in the Nutcracker and Alice in Wonderland for the Louisville Ballet Company. After one year, my family relocated to Apex, North Carolina. During my first year there, I was cast as Clara in the Carolina Ballet Company’s first Nutcracker. This was a dream come true! I continued to perform in the Nutcracker with them for the next two years. During my middle school years, I also received a scholarship to attend the Pacific Northwest Ballet’s summer intensive program in Seattle.\n\nOnce I started high school, I fell in love with dance team. I enjoyed the sporting event atmosphere and the unique jazz style, as well the camaraderie that came along with it. I stopped tapping, lessened my focus on ballet, and became the captain and choreographer of the team my senior year. From there, I went on to Appalachian State University to get my BFA in Dance. I joined the dance team my sophomore year and was the head captain and choreographer for both my junior and senior year. During one of my summers of college, I interned at Broadway Dance Center in New York City.\n\nDTP: I love all of the ballet training you received as a student! It is so important regardless of what we want to do as dancers. Were you a competitive dancer as well? Where did you receive your training? What was one of the most valuable lessons you learned as a pre-professional student?\n\nCM: I trained at traditional dance studios growing up, so I did not compete. I did the bulk of my dance training at Carolina Dance Center in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nOne of the most valuable lessons I learned as a pre professional student is that it’s okay to walk away if you feel burned out. What I didn’t share in my previous response is that I actually quit dance after my spring recital 8th grade year. It was a difficult decision to make. I felt so guilty because I didn’t want to let anyone down, but I wasn’t passionate about dance anymore. I dreaded going to class, and struggled to push myself when I was at the studio.\n\nAlthough it was hard for my parents and teachers to accept, I’m glad that in the end they supported my decision. I didn’t attend any classes the whole summer. I enjoyed my time off at first, but then found myself frequently dancing in my room late at night. That’s when I realized that I did truly love dance. I enrolled back into classes starting the Fall of my freshman year.\n\nDuring this time off, I finally had time to reflect on what dance meant to me. I realized that just because I didn’t want to be a ballerina anymore, didn’t mean that I wasn’t supposed to dance at all. There were other avenues, I just needed to figure out which path was right for me.\n\nI hold this lesson close to my heart not only because it gave me reassurance that I was meant to dance, but it helps me tremendously with my students. They feel comfortable talking to me when they are experiencing the same struggles. They don’t have to feel guilty about letting me down because I’ve been through it and know that it’s not personal.\n\nI’ve talked to several teachers about this who have never doubted their dedication to the art. For some of them, it’s hard to understand that just because a student’s passion waivers, doesn’t mean they don’t love it. Personally, I would rather a student take some time off to think things through than come to class and be miserable. As many already know, there is no off-season in dance. Sometimes you have to make one. Making a student feel guilty is doing a disservice to both the student and the teacher. If their heart is truly in it, they’ll come back and have a deeper appreciation.\n\nDTP: Those are some very valid points. Sometimes we don’t know how much we love something until it is taken from us. So, what made you want you audition for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders?\n\nCM: When it came time to graduate from App State, I wasn’t ready to end my dance team experience. I realized that this was where my passion truly lied, and being a head dance team coach at a university was my ultimate goal. At the young age of twenty-one though, I wasn’t ready to give up my performing career just yet. This led me to my decision to tryout for the ultimate dance team, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.\n\nDTP: I love that your training led you to a love for dance team. It is such a difference from the tradional conservatory life you were exposed to primarily. So give us a little bit of insight about the DCC audition process.\n\nCM: The preliminary and semi-final round for the DCC fell right in between my last week of classes and exam week. I flew out of Charlotte to Dallas the Friday before the first round. The preliminary round is very intimidating and overwhelming. Somewhere between 200-300 girls show up, and you have about a minute and a half to impress them. You go on to the floor in groups of six with 8-10 judges in front of you. You introduce your name, age, where you are from, and one interesting fact about yourself. They turn on a song for about 45 seconds to a minute and you have to freestyle. This is your only chance to catch their eye.\n\nAfter making some cuts, the following day is semi-finals. They teach you a 45-second routine and a short version of their famous kick line. They teach both routines fairly quick, and then you audition in groups of six again. What I wasn’t aware of was they make you take a written test after everyone’s performed! This written test covered everything under the sun and it was timed! It asked questions on nutrition, Cowboys and DCC history, Texas history and politics, current events, EVERYTHING! I thought this was going to be given at Finals, so I was not prepared. They announced who made it to the third round, and I flew back to North Carolina to finish my senior exams.\n\nDuring the two weeks in between Semi-Finals and Finals, I finished my exams, graduated, studied for the DCC panel interview, practiced the tryout routine and kick line, and choreographed my solo. At Finals, you interview in a groups of four. Just like the written test, you never knew what they were going to ask you. The following day, you get a number first thing in the morning. That number determined the order of solos, as well as the groups you would be placed in to perform the tryout routine and kick line. This was a very LONG day! You don’t realize how truly exhausted you are until they leave to deliberate. It was the longest wait of my life.\n\nAfter deliberation, they announced each number that made it into training camp! I had two weeks to move out of my college apartment, drive my car down, and find a place to live to start this new chapter. Training camp was every week, Monday through Friday, until mid-August. Every day was overwhelming and stressful. You could get cut at any point and the routines continued to pile up. By the time we went into the season, we were responsible for knowing around forty-five dances!\n\nDTP: I knew it would be a lengthy process but wow, that is a lot! It has to be such a great feeling knowing you made the team after the entire process! Once you made the team, how long were you a member of the DCC? Do you have any favorite moments from your experiences on the team?\n\nCM: I was a DCC for two years. I had so many fun experiences, it’s hard to narrow it down! Two of my favorite memories though would be them finally announcing that we had made the squad my first year, and the USO tour my second year. There is nothing better than working as hard as you can for something and fulfilling your goals. The USO tour was amazing because we got to interact with so many soldiers in South Korea, and see a different part of the world. I also really enjoyed getting to perform at the opening of the Cowboys training camp in Oxnard, California, as well as going to Canada for the Edmonton Rush events.\n\nDTP: That is awesome that you were able to see the some of the world with the organization! Through all of those amazing experiences, what did you learn from being a Cowboys Cheerleader?\n\nCM: What I learned from being a member of the DCC is to always keep an open mind, and to put yourself out there. To be honest, even though I had trained extensively as a dancer my whole life, their unique style was hard for me to grasp. I felt really vulnerable and defeated at times, but I’m proud of myself for not letting it get the best of me and always trying to be better. I’m also glad that I found the courage to try out. Failure is my biggest fear and always has been. There are times I look back on my experience, and realize how many amazing opportunities I would’ve missed out on if I hadn’t tried out. Since then, when that fear and doubt creeps back in my head, I tell myself that if I don’t try, I will never know what cool experience could’ve come out of it. Every experience is a lesson to be learned.\n\nDTP: That is such an important lesson to be taught and is so valuable in every aspect of life. NOw that you have moved on from the DCC, what are you up to?\n\nCM: After retiring last Spring, I got really involved with the dance studio I teach at in Dallas. I became the competitive Ensemble Director, and choreographed a large amount of solos for the following competition season. I’ve been able to travel back to North Carolina to teach several master classes around the Raleigh area, as well as to help out and choreograph basketball routines for the North Carolina State University Dance Team. I even had the opportunity to choreograph a NDA Nationals routine for a local Raleigh High School. The plan was to move down to Dallas for the DCC and return to NC after I retired. I’m so glad I stayed in Dallas for another year and experienced so many choreography and teaching opportunities, but I’m ready to return to North Carolina to be closer to family. I will be moving back to the Raleigh area in the Summer of 2015. It will definitely be a bittersweet move as I have fallen in love with the city of Dallas and my sweet students\n\nDTP: Studio teaching is so rewarding, but sometimes it is just time to go home. I understand completely! If you could sum your entire DCC experience into oe word, what would that be?\n\nCM: It would have to be surreal. I never thought I would have the courage to pursue something so big, let alone achieve it. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders organization is so iconic and an honor to be apart of. It was very stressful, exhausting, and difficult at times, but that’s what made the once in a lifetime opportunities mean so much more! I’m forever thankful for the woman the organization has shaped me into becoming. Being a part of it gave me the push I needed to become the choreographer and teacher that I needed to be to pursue my dreams in the next chapter. Sometimes, it feels like I dreamed the whole experience, but I’m so grateful that it was real life. 🙂\n\nDTP: Love that. We never know what our life experiences are gearing us up for. Do you have any words of advice to those who may want to try out for professional sports dance teams?\n\nCM: The greatest advice I have to offer is don’t give yourself any excuses for failure. Do everything in your power to reach your goal so that you can look back with no regrets. Whether it’s making yourself stretch or going to dance classes every day, you will feel more confident going into this process if you know you did everything you could to make your goal achievable.\n\nDTP: So incredibly true. Okay, last but certainly not least, give us five random facts about yourself!\n\nCM: 1. I’m still scared of the dark and have not overcome my fear of the boogieman (no matter how hot it is, I MUST have my feet under the covers so he can’t grab me while I’m sleeping).\n\n2. During my Broadway Dance Center internship in NYC, I had the opportunity to be in a photo shoot, and appeared in Dance Spirit Magazine.\n\n3. I’m addicted to sriracha popcorn.\n\n4. I have a hard time getting rid of things because I find sentimental value in EVERYTHING!\n\n5. Up until DCC, I calmed my nerves before performances with naps. When I was younger, I would literally sleep in the backseat of my parents’ car the whole way to the shows.\n\nThank you again for spending some times with me and my readers! I really appreciate it!

In a world where we are driven by beauty and image, and in an industry where you can be cut from an audition because you don’t look the part, there are very few beacons that encourage diversity in body type.\n\nWhen I heard about a show on Ovation called Big Ballet, I was immediately drawn to it. Daniel Jones is the Artistic Director and Choreographer of the Big Ballet UK. They are a company made up of dancers of all shapes and sizes. I watched the show and fell in love with the idea of embracing someone’s passion and love for dance instead of limiting them due to their size.\n\nI recently had the opportunity to interview one of their dancers, Donna Hargreave, about her time with the company and what she has learned throughout the process. Read on to see her side of dance!\n\nDanceTchrProbs: Tell us a bit about your background as a dancer.\n\nDonna Hargreave: I started to dance at the age of 4, I did all genres, ballet, tap, modern, tap and stage. From day one, I was hooked. I continued to dance until I was 18 years of age. At this point I reached a crossroads in my life. At only 4 feet 11 inches I am considered small in the dance world. So I followed my head and chose a career in Nursing, which I have to say I have never regretted. I never ever let the dance go, it is a passion, so I continued with adult classes, but mainly in modern and tap. I still do exams with the International Dance Teachers Association in tap.\n\nDTP: What made you want to be a part of Big Ballet?\n\nDH: Initially I was very unsure, as it would be a large undertaking and commitment. My husband, Nigel, family and dance teacher encouraged me to audition, as I think they realised how much I would gain from the experience. I wanted to be part of something that challenged the preconceived ideas is shapes, sizes and in my case age in the world of ballet. And hopefully inspire others and change, dance should be accessible to all!\n\nDTP: I am located in the US and we only got about 5 episodes of the show. Is the company still together? Do you have an on running series still?\n\nDH: Yes. 11 of the original 18 are still together, and have formed the company, Big Ballet UK, under the Artistic Direction of Daniel Jones. Although there are no plans as yet to televise more of our journey, the journey still continues. We train 1-2 times a week, doing Circuit training, classical ballet training and preparing choreography for new performances. In August we were fortunate to be invited to perform at the Royal Ballet School, London. We performed excerpts from The Nutcracker, choreographed by Daniel Jones.\n\nDTP: Where did you find your biggest supporter? What about your biggest critic?\n\nDH: In my younger years I am eternally grateful to my parents. I am the eldest of 4children, 3 girls all dancers. My parents never questioned a penny, despite money being tight. My dance teachers were and still are an inspiration, for the endless hours spent improving technique, sharing their dance knowledge and planting the seed of love for dance in my heart. I am my biggest critic!!!!!!\n\nDTP: What about the company? Who was the biggest supporter? Biggest critic?\n\nDH: Whilst training for the programme and to this day, the company ballerinas spend a lot of time together. We very quickly became a family, brought together from different backgrounds, through auditions with an overwhelming passion for dance. Daniel Jones, Monica Loughman, Wayne Sleep and the production company believed in us and the impact we could have on the dance world. I suppose we have many sceptics, who does not when they are trying to inspire change? But this is the Big Ballet Uk’s journey. It has been truly magical and continues to be so.\n\nDTP: What is our favorite part about being a part of the Big Ballet?\n\nDH: The chance to dance, ‘ live the dream’. At the age of 49, it’s the reawakening of endless possibilities. I have found the ballerina in me again.\n\nDTP: What advice do you have for any dancer facing adversity because of body type?\n\nDH: Embrace who you are. Celebrate your womanly curves, we are all a product of our relationships and life. Big Ballet Uk hopefully showed that whatever your size, shape, age, nothing is a barrier. Dance from the heart, beauty is from within.\n\nDTP: What has been your favorite production?\n\nDH: The two productions I have performed in, have been very different, mainlydown to the circumstances. Swan Lake, was a truly amazing experience, that started this magical journey, culminating into a great sense of achievement. The Nutcracker, with the new company and Daniel Jones, was equally as awe inspiring, but it also felt that it belonged to the ballerinas involved. With that comes a responsibility, which we embrace and a great sense of pride.\n\nDTP: What inspires you?\n\nDH: My children, Kathryn is 20, a dancer/dance teacher. Ben is 17, in upper sixth at school and captain of his senior rugby team. They are the best thing I have ever dine in my life, they accept me for who I am, support all I do, criticise me for all I do wrong! But most of all it’s the unconditional love.\n\nDTP: Do you have any desire to choreograph or further the creative portion of your dance career?\n\nDH: My real job is owner of a beauty salon and boutique with my sister Tracey. My job is fulfilling, creative fashion excites me, people interest me, and I get great satisfaction from helping ladies, play dress up and go home happy, feeling beautiful. These skills have also been of great help in my new role as Head Of Costume with Big Ballet Uk. I will definitely leave the choreography to our expert, Daniel Jones, he creates beautiful movement that compliments our diverse ballerinas.\n\nDTP: What was the response to Big Ballet in the UK? Where are you located and where do you train?\n\nDH: The response to Big Ballet, was phenomenal, beyond anyone’s expectations. We train 1/2 times a week, more if we have a performance, at Shona Boocock Academy Of Dance (one of the swans). Our journey and plans continue under the direction of Daniel Jones. All I can say, is watch this space!!!\n\nDTP: What have you learned from being a part of the Big Ballet Uk?\n\nDH: Patience. To believe in myself. I have a willingness to learn. I have an eagerness to please. I need to challenge myself. I also needed to fulfill a childhood dream.\n\nI am 50 next year a milestone age, I am super excited about what life has in store for me. My new role as a ballerina, with Daniel Jones andBig Ballet, is the biggest challenge, but I know the rewards will be phenomenal. I am ready to work hard, fulfill my new role and enjoy every minute.\n\nDTP: What is next for you and the Big Ballet?\n\nDH: I am 50 next year a milestone age, I am super excited about what life has in store for me. My new role as a ballerina, with Daniel Jones and Big Ballet, is the biggest challenge, but I know the rewards will be phenomenal. I am ready to work hard, fulfill my new role and enjoy every minute.\n\nFor more information on Big Ballet UK, be sure to like their Facebook page and follow them on Twitter!\n\nThe Dynamic Duo!\n\nStandard\n\nCutting Edge Dance Center is a force to be reckoned with in our competitive dance scene. After interviewing these two, I now see why. The studio has set an expectation and their dancers and staff, rise to it and exceed it. The love for dance that co-owner Patrice Barakat and instructor Mark Meismer have for dance is immense and it trickles down to their students. You can see it in their social media posts and most importantly, their dancing. Read on to see what inspires these two, how they work together and some of their favorite moments!\n\nDanceTchrProbs: Go ahead and introduce yourself and give us a brief history of your dance experience and studio history.\n\nPatrice Barakat: Hi, I’m Patrice Barakat. I co-own Cutting Edge Dance Center in CA with my sister, Suzanne. This is our 6th year in Business. I grew up training with the industries top teachers & choreographers in the competition world. For the past 18 years, I have had the privilege to travel nationwide as guest choreographer for numerous studios/events.\n\nMark Meismer: Hi 🙂 my name is Mark Meismer I have been in the entertainment industry working as a professional dancer and choreographer for the past 18 years. I have had a blessed career in TV, film and concert dance. I currently teach on the dance convention NUVO and choreograph and work for Cutting Edge Dance center.\n\nDTP: How did you two meet? What is your relationship in regards to the studio?\n\nMM: When we were little. We used to compete against each other…\n\nPB: We went to the Orange County High School of the Arts together and were kind of always the “go to” dance duo.\n\nMM: After HS we went on our individual career paths, but when Patrice opened Cutting Edge, I knew it was something I wanted to be a part of. Each year, I get more and more involved and I would definitely say we are creative partners.\n\nPB: Yes, we make a lot of the decisions together.\n\nDTP: I know you two are close. How do you maintain a strong work and personal relationship?\n\nMM: We don’t really know. We genuinely laugh a large majority of the time we are together.\n\nPB: We have such a history and so much respect for one another that our trust level is immeasurable.\n\nMM: We always get the job done, we know what the other is going to say before we even say it.\n\nPB: So, somehow, that works for us. Our friendship and working relationship is one in the same.\n\nDTP: Patrice, as an owner, what have you found to be the most effective way to stay in communication with your staff? And with your dancers and families?\n\nPB: Definitely email and social media.\n\nDTP: Now to learn more about the studio. What sets Cutting Edge Dance Center apart from the rest?\n\nPB: I don’t know that it’s apart from the rest, so to speak, but the quality I am definitely most proud of is our bond. The love. The laughter.The hard work. But we laugh our way through the most intense of rehearsals, and the kids are sweating and “dying” but living and laughing as one cohesive unit. Our motto is, “We BELIEVE in One Love” and we really stand by that. In-house competitiveness is NOT tolerated and it’s really made such a difference. It’s a beautiful, supportive energy and I’m so proud of it. We also stress the importance of versatility to our dancers. They train in all styles and it’s just so fun to watch them be stunning in a lyrical, then ghetto in hip hop and then not taking themselves too seriously, they go out and kill a cheesy musical theatre. It’s so much more fun that way.\n\nMM: I was going to say the same thing. You have to find the right fit for you, but our motto really works for us and the kids truly dance for the person next to them. We strive to continue to push the kids to grow and grow and grow. Each year they HAVE to be better. It’s amazing to be a part of.\n\nDTP: I think that is a beautiful thing. When you set a standard, people rise to it or don’t. Mark, you hit the nail on the head with having to find the right fit. How many hours do your competitive dancers spend in class a week, on average? How many of those are ballet?\n\nPB: We have dancers that drive from as far as Redlands, Redondo Beach, Wrightwood and Newport – all an hour one way in different directions. So we try to accommodate the schedule to get as much in as possible. They’re required two, hour and a half ballet classes per week, many take 3. And they are required to take a technique class in every style that they compete in, with additional optional classes such as progressions, stretch/conditioning etc.\n\nDTP: That is a great schedule. Ballet is where it’s all coming from, so I applaud your dancers tenacity with taking as much as they can. What have been some defining moments for you as teachers and as a studio owner?\n\nMM: A defining moment for me was Star Showcase at KAR Nationals in Las Vegas 2012. We won Intermediate Grand Champions with “Gentle Savior” and Elite with “Fix You.” I honestly didn’t think we’d win both. The kids truly were dancing for their lives and for every ingredient to come together TWICE, it was magical and a moment we’ll never forget.\n\nPB: A moment I will always remember is, in our 3rd year of existence, we qualified with two dances for the FDC’s World’s Championship. Our Hip Hop, “Who We Are,” choreographed by Marissa Osato, placed 4th, and Mark’s senior small group “Heaven,” placed 2nd. But the best part was the buzz there. Dancers from all over the country in the holding area stopped what they were doing and applauded our dancers as they walked off stage. Our dancers were dumbfounded by the support and that in itself felt like we won. It’s not always the trophy that matters. It’s the experience. The way it feels in your soul. The memories the dancers create together – it’s priceless.\n\nDTP: Do you have a preference of competition or convention? Pros and cons of either or both?\n\nMM: Being that I teach on NUVO, I understand the importance of conventions. It’s about pushing yourself outside your comfort zone and seeing/experiencing other dancers to grow from. Convention is such a great venue to be inspired by. I feel like dancers work harder at convention than their own studios. I like to do competition and convention, they’re both important. Convention is about the education and classes while competition is an amazing performance opportunity and to see beautiful pieces from surrounding studios as well.\n\nPB: We have studio staff on two major conventions. As mentioned, Mark is on NUVO and Marissa Osato, our contemporary and hip hop teacher, is on West Coast Dance Explosion. So we definitely stress the importance of attending to our dancers. There is so much knowledge to be gained and we love the kids to be exposed to so much incredible talent in the world. We love competitions as well. We do six regionals per season. We value the benefit of being on stage numerous times with the same pieces. We stress that if there is growth, they’ve done what we’ve asked of them.\n\nDTP: All very valid points. When choreographing, what inspires you? Do you guys work together often?\n\nMM: First and foremost for me is music.\n\nPB: I agree, 100%.\n\nMM: Every year, we do more and more together. We work quickly and finish each other’s movements, like we finish each other’s sentences.\n\nPB: We choreograph about 10 pieces at Cutting Edge together, aside from our individual pieces. We are taking our “act” on the road this year. Mark and I will be choreographing the University of Tennessee’s Jazz Nationals Dance together. We’re SO pumped.\n\nDTP: A real life Roxie and Velma! Minus the crime ha! Any favorite dances or moments as a team in the studio?\n\nMM: “Heaven” for me. It was a piece I created for my dad, as he passed away from cancer days before I choreographed it. It was something I will always treasure and hold dear to my heart. “Fix You” as well. That was for my mom, battling cancer at the time, and she beat it. Those were powerful for me, but I truly love so many.\n\nPB: “Thataway” was a Musical Theatre piece I created in 2009 – our first competitive year. It won our very first National Grand Championship that year. A huge accomplishment for year one. I just loved how the kids dove in to the characters. This year, I’d have to say, “Rhapsody”… Mark and I created it together and it’s just a fun mix of jazz/lyrical/silliness and I love it so much. One of my favorites I’ve ever created is also a Trio called Name of Love. It was one of those where everything just came together and clicked and the 3 girls’ passion, friendship and bond made them take my work to another level. That was a year people knew their names. I wish I could list 33 dances! I love so many!\n\nDTP: What is your favorite part about being a teacher?\n\nPB: The relationships. Watching the growth, week after week, year after year. Being so many of the dancers “rock,” I just love it. I feel so lucky to have been a teacher for so long. This is my 21st year. What?\n\nMM: Making an impact on a child’s life is such an important job and to be able to make a difference in so many kids lives is so rewarding. Most of these kids won’t go on to be professional dancers, but we’re teaching life lessons. I love being a part of shaping and molding the next generation.\n\nDTP: Most definitely. So man life lessons to be learned through dance education. What is your favorite style to choreograph and why?\n\nMM: Lyrical. It’s just so amazing to express the lyrics through your body of movement. It’s the most emotional style and I love bringing that out in dancers.\n\nPB: Musical theatre and lyrical. I love musical theatre cause it’s just so fun to portray different characters. A lot of people do jazz to musical theatre music and that’s not who I am at all. I love authentic, straight off the Broadway stage movement. [And] Lyrical because it’s just so beautiful. The feelings and emotions you can express through your body is everything.\n\nDTP: What have been some of your favorite gigs?\n\nPB: For the last 8 years I’ve been the jazz choreographer for the University of Tennessee, including 3 National Championships. The journey with that school is amazing.\n\nMM: Being the assistant choreographer to Mia Michaels on the Celine Dion show “A New Day” in Las Vegas was definitely one of my favorites.\n\nDTP: How do you stay current and educated as a teacher?\n\nMM: Teaching with the amazing NUVO faculty and seeing amazing dancers across the country each weekend def inspires me.\n\nPB: I travel across the country as a head judge for Kids Artistic Revue and seeing what people are doing and taking our dancers to conventions along with the desire to always bring new life to our dances keeps me inspired.\n\nDTP: If you could work with anyone, dead of alive, who would it be?\n\nPB: Marilyn Monroe. There is an energy she possessed that is so vibrant and inviting. I think it would have been amazing to create on her.\n\nMM: I’ve been so blessed to work with so many amazing and wonderful people as a dancer and choreographer, I can’t think of anyone off the top of my head!\n\nDTP: If you could leave every student who took your class with one piece of advice, what would you leave them with?\n\nPB: I would leave them with the importance of believing in themselves. Our world is tough and we have to be on our own side. I’ve looked at dancers that fall out of something so many times and said, “You weren’t believing in it. Do it again and believe…because you can.” And almost every time, without exaggeration, it’s significantly better. So as Tinkerbell as it sounds, I truly feel like if I died today, I will have made a difference, because of the huge amount of dancers who have thanked me for teaching them the power of believing.\n\nMM: My advice would be always leave with your heart and dance from a real and honest place. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. You give and put in a 100%, and you get 100% out of class. If you put in 5%, you get 5%. Dance like it’s the last time you will ever dance again. We don’t know what tomorrow holds so be present and live in the moment. Cherish each moment you get to dance and walk out of the door proud of yourself for the work you put in. Being a dancer is an incredible gift!\n\nDTP: Thank you again to the both of you for your love and passion that you share and spread through our community! I applaud you and look up to you both!\n\nBe sure to follow Mark on his Twitter and Instagram and Patrice on her Twitter and Instagram! Also, check out the Cutting Edge Dance Center website for more information on the studio And Mark’s website for more information on him!\n\nNational Tap Dance Day!\n\nStandard\n\nIt’s National Tap Dance Day! I am taking this opportunity to hit that small, but talented component of the dance world. For those of you that know me or have followed me for awhile. I am very picky about tap – just like everything else. I love when I come across someone in the tap industry that is equally as passionate about that genre of dance as I am about mine.\n\nI recently had the opportunity to interview Ryan Casey. Some of you may know him, and some of you may not. After getting to know him through this interview, you should know him, or at least of him. At the age of 24, he has had a brilliant career thus far and is on his way to great things. So without further ado, I introduce to you, Ryan Casey.\n\nDanceTchrProbs: Hey Ryan! Thanks for taking some time out for my readers and I. We definitely appreciate it. Could you give us a rundown of your dance bio. What styles, aside from tap, did you train in?\n\nRyan Casey: I started with tap and jazz when I was 5 – they are definitely my first and greatest loves – and then added ballet and hip hop a few years later, when I joined the Legacy Dance Company. I’ve also trained for over a decade in the Jump Rhythm Jazz technique of Billy Siegenfeld.\n\nDTP: What are some lessons that you learned while training as a pre-professional student?\n\nRC: What I value most about my pre-professional education is the advice I received about how to be a professional and the professional opportunities I had – which is ultimately, I think, the goal of that training. My teachers held me responsible for my costumes, my punctuality, my attitude. Because I got to study and perform with master artists, and travel to participate in showcases and workshops, I learned how to conduct myself maturely, represent myself appropriately, and be the young professional that I am today. When I moved to New York after graduating high school, I was ready for the opportunities that awaited me not just because I had been trained well technically, but also raised well as a professional. That’s something that’s very important to me as a teacher: of course, I want my kids to be able to execute their steps cleanly and rhythmically, but I also want them to know how to be part of a show, how to dress for a master class, how to take responsibility for their choreography, etc. I see a lot of young dancers – and older dancers, for that matter – who are wonderful technicians and performers, but lacking in what I think really counts: professionalism.\n\nDTP: That is a brilliant encasing of your experience as a student and I think that is something that all dancers need to know and teachers need to teach. So, what drew you to the art of tap?\n\nRC: Initially, tap was my favorite style because it was the one at which I excelled the most. I came to appreciate it because, as any tapper will tell you, the most satisfying thrill of the art form is the ability to be simultaneously a dancer and a percussive musician. Rhythm and musicality are simply entrancing.\n\nDTP: How do you define your tap style?\n\nRC: Broadly speaking, it’s full-bodied and rhythm-based; the two, of course, go hand in hand. I incorporate the athleticism of the upper body and arms with my choreography, and I always start first with the rhythm: What do I want to hear? What do I want the audience to hear? I devise steps based on energy and sound, as opposed to shape. I struggle to define my own dancing more specifically – when my students look at a step of mine and say, “Oh, that’s so you,” I’m never quite sure what they mean – but I think my work is usually witty, engaging, and accessible to all audiences, which is important to me.\n\nDTP: Balancing technique and entertainment is no easy feat, so kudos to you. Your students will definitely benefit from that in all the styles they train in. You auditioned for SYTYCD. Give us a rundown of how that experience was for you. How far did you make it?\n\nRC: It was an exhausting two days; much more sitting around and waiting than actual dancing. When I heard about the auditions, I had no intention of going, but my dance teacher insisted; she told me she’d be at my house at 5 a.m. on the morning of the audition to drive me there, and she was. Even though I didn’t make it past the choreography round (I think they foresaw problems partnering me with anyone), I was grateful for the experience. I still feel that I represented tap very strongly, and was at that time one of the few to do so. It’s funny to me that, five years later, people still ask me about it and look me up on YouTube. I still tell funny stories about the audition process to my students. I just never thought anything would come of it. (And yes, Cat Deeley is as charming in person as she seems!)\n\nDTP: You are a tall guy at 6’8″. I have often seen tall or long-limbed dancers be afraid of their size or length. Did you ever struggle with that? If so, how did you overcome it? Do you have any advice to those who may be struggling with overcoming this mental block?\n\nRC: I was frequently self-conscious about my body while growing up as a dancer. It took many years and many ballet and jazz classes for me to learn to use my arms and upper body to their full extent; I still take jazz regularly for that reason. If you are lanky and long-limbed, you have to embrace it rather than fight it. Use it as a tool to help, rather than hinder your dancing. I spent a lot of time considering how best to use my body, developing steps and sequences that would accentuate and spotlight my unique physicality. In fact, I’ve devoted a whole suite of dances, “The Tall & Short of It,” to the subject of my height and my journey from self-consciousness to self acceptance.\n\nDTP: What inspires you as you create your choreography?\n\nRC: Lately, I’ve really enjoyed creating suites – three or four dances developed around the same theme or character, or telling a short story. I think I appreciate the opportunity to create a narrative on a small scale. I’m often inspired either by a particular character – I’m working on a suite about hipsters – or a broader idea, like a work I created that was all about my height. I also love finding songs that I can use ironically; I’m using Tower of Power’s “What is Hip?” for my hipster suite, for instance, and have enjoyed dancing a solo piece to “Your Feets Too Big.”\n\nDTP: That sounds fun! If you get footage of it, I would love to see it and I am sure my readers and followers would as well! If you could work with anyone, dead or alive, who would it be?\n\nRC: I would love to have met Gregory Hines! So many mentors of mine speak so highly of him and what an incredible person and dancer he was. I remember exactly where I was when I heard that he had passed the way some people remember where they were when JFK was shot. I feel like he and I would have had some lively conversations. Bob Fosse is another dancer I would have been thrilled to work with. As someone with an unusual physique, I have always been drawn to his work and the unusual, captivating, ironic movements he choreographed. I’m consistently enthralled by movement that’s different, fresh, innovative.\n\nDTP: I do love me some Fosse. If you could have every student who left your classes with one piece of advice, what would it be?\n\nRC: Everything has rhythmic potential.\n\nDTP: I like that. So Ryan, what has been a defining moment or moments for you in your career?\n\nRC: There have been so many thus far! I’m fortunate to have been able to participate in the YoungArts program and the inaugural tap program at The School at Jacob’s Pillow, and I got to perform at my college graduation at Lincoln Center (!). And I’ll never forget the feelings – exhilaration, exhaustion, pride, disbelief – I had after I finished the first show that I had choreographed, directed, produced, and starred in.\n\nI also vividly remember one moment that I don’t think I’ve ever shared. My first festival teaching gig was a few years ago in Canada, at an event a friend of mine ran called “Tap Into a Cure.” The stage manager for the concert was none other than Shelley Tookey – Stacey’s mom. I was performing a new piece that combined tap with original poetry, and as it was my first serious piece of choreography, and an experimental one, at that, I was still terrified about its reception. After my tech rehearsal, I came offstage and Shelley was in the wing. “That was brilliant,” she said. All I could think was, Oh, my God! Stacey Tookey’s mom said I was brilliant! I’ll always remember that – LOL!\n\nDTP: Not going to lie, I probably would have thought the same thing! 6 things you can’t live without?\n\nRC: Cupcakes; chocolate milk; a good book; my tap shoes; Janet Jackson; bear hugs.\n\nDTP: Tell us a little more about you!\n\nRC: My favorite color is blue (it comprises most of my wardrobe, including my tap shoes).\n\nI was born on November 14. My favorite book is Great Expectations, my favorite movie is probably Clue, and my favorite ice cream flavor is black raspberry.\n\nWhen I’m not dancing, I’m a freelance journalist for publications like Dance Studio Life and Dance Spirit. I attended NYU for journalism and literature, so I’m also a literary nerd, hoping to obtain a Master’s degree someday in the Victorian novel.\n\nDTP: What is next for you?\n\nRC: On Father’s Day, I’m presenting my new show, “Class Act,” in Boston. It’s an ode to big band jazz, inspired by The Great Gatsby, Vaudeville, film noir, and Fred Astaire.\n\nThen I have a busy summer schedule: I’m teaching at the Southern Vermont DanceFestival, Point Tap Festival, and Tap United, and I’ll be presenting work with the Inside/Out series at Jacob’s Pillow on July 9 and then performing in Tap City’s “Tap & Song” in NYC on July 10. In the meantime, I’ll be developing new work as an artist in residence at The Dance Complex in Cambridge, MA. I feel very fortunate and am looking forward to it all!\n\nDTP: You’ve got a lot going for you. I can’t wait to see where it all takes you! Thank you again for taking the time out of our forever full schedules for us!\n\nBe sure to follow Ryan on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for the latest! Also, check out his website for more fun stuff!!\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! Get those tap shoes on and tap for your lives today! Happy National Tap Dance Day!\n\nXO,\n\n#DanceTchrProbs\n\nLittle Miss Moffet!\n\nStandard\n\nYou may not know her, but you definitely know her dancers. Alexa Moffett is a young, insanely talented choreographer that is taking the competition and convention scene and the dance world by storm. Take a moment to get to know her, see what makes her wheels turn, and what she is up to next!\n\nDanceTchrProbs: Hey, Alexa! Thanks for taking the time to interview with me! Can you give us a brief history of your dance background?\n\nAlexa Moffet: I started dancing at 10 years old and was put on a competitive team. I had never danced in my life and I even learned my ballet positions off a video my mom rented from the library. I danced with girls much younger than myself due to my lack of training, but caught up by the next year. When I turned 12, we moved to Arizona from Minnesota and I continued my training. I started choreographing solos and assisting drill team at age 15. When I was 17 I was choreographing about 20 solos and teaching drill team. My solos were unbeatable and different than the typical Arizona style of dance. I was offered 3 different positions from studios in AZ and Club Dance is where I ended up at. I had to give up dancing to continue my job and to this day still makes me wonder what path I would’ve been on if I hadn’t. I had to start from scratch with the girls and for two years, my life was on pause, working with them every second I could to prepare them. My first solo I choreographed at Club Dance was Jaycee’s ‘Roxie’ and my first group number was ‘When You Believe.’ Training new and young dancers is one of the hardest jobs, but the girls were up for the challenge and went from being unknown to undefeated. In the last two years my kids and choreography have been featured on America’s Got Talent Season 8, Dance Moms, Abby’s Ultimate Dance Challenge Season 2, X Factor, Disney Channel, Bun Heads, and some more exciting things for the girls and I very soon. In 2013, I also started my own traveling workshop with my good friend, Molly Long, that we will be expanding world wide this year.\n\nDTP: Quite the career you have for someone so young! Definitely a testament that anything is possible with hard work, from both you and your dancers. Run us through a typical day in the life of Alexa…\n\nAM: Wake up, ignore dance mom texts, get some coffee, respond to the moms if I decide, studio, gym, and occasionally have a real life and see my regular friends at nights!\n\nDTP: Ha! I am sure we can all relate to some of that. What inspires you daily? And what inspires you choreographically?\n\nAM: My students. My students inspire me all the time. I love to see them improve and want something. When I’m choreographing I can vision the girls and know exactly what to give to them. They are what keeps me teaching.\n\nDTP: I can most definitely agree with that. Your Club Dance girls are known for being insanely flexible. What techniques, other than just basic stretches, do they perform?\n\nAM: We have a great stretch class that I teach for my workshop…book me and you can find out my secrets. Hehe!\n\nDTP: A magician never reveals her secrets. Totally understandable. So, If you could work with anyone, dead or alive, who would it be?\n\nAM: MOLLY LONG MY BESTIE 😉\n\nDTP: Well, that was easy! What is your favorite style of dance to perform or choreograph and why?\n\nAM: Anything that makes you feel good. Something that has a story I can act or relate to.\n\nDTP: I am confident in saying we all agree. It’s why we dance. If there is one thing that you could have every dancer who ever takes your class take with them, what would it be?\n\nAM: If you don’t work hard you don’t deserve it. I take my classes extremely seriously and don’t put up with anything but 500 percent. I want you to work for it until you cry you’re so happy.\n\nDTP: That is a beautiful mantra. Success comes with work and dedication. I love that you instill that in your students. What are some valuable life lessons that you learned during your days as a competitive/studio dancer?\n\nAM: I’ve learned to work for what I have. Every ounce of success I’ve had has been 100% because of pushing myself to never give up on my dreams. My entire dance career has always been people telling me I was never good enough and could never do it. So I proved them wrong.\n\nDTP: I love that. Nothing ever comes from listening to the nay-sayers. Let us know more about you! What is your favorite color? Birthday? Favorite song right now? Favorite musical?\n\nAM: My favorite colors are blue and purple. Birthday is August 6th. I’m liking Little Mix’s new album, even though it’s a bit cheesy. And Sister Act is my favorite musical!\n\nDTP: 6 things you could not live with out.\n\nAM: iPhone, music, Addison Moffett, coffee, socks, and lulu. Things I could live without:\n\nDance moms having my phone number, crying children, mornings, bad feet, and airplanes.\n\nDTP: HAHAHAH! Yesssss! So what is the next big thing for Alexa Moffett?\n\nAM: Expanding our workshop to worldwide and more! You’ll have to wait and see!\n\nThanks for reading, everyone. We are both appreciative! Be sure to follow her on Twitter and on Instagram for the latest ad the greatest!\n\nXO,\n\n#DanceTchrProbs\n\nMad About Christina!\n\nStandard\n\nYou all know her. Some of you may even envy her. You fawn at her every move. If you don’t, you may now. Christina Ricucci is a young and extremely talented dancer.\n\nDanceTchrProbs: Tell us a little about yourself. Age, Studio, When you started dancing, and anything else you would like to include!\n\nChristina Ricucci: I started dancing when I was 2, my mom put me in combo class and I wouldn’t pay attention at all! I just sat on the floor in front of the mirror and made funny faces haha! I guess I never stopped dance class since then! I am now 15, I dance at Murrieta Dance Project and Dimitri Kulev Classical Ballet Academy and I’m just as busy as ever! But I love it!\n\nDTP: What made you want to start dancing?\n\nCR: When I first started dancing I was 2, and my mom signed me up so I kind of just went along with the ride. It wasn’t until I was 9 and I moved to my current studio MDP, that I realized that this is really what I wanted to do.\n\nDTP: How many of hours do you spend in classes? How many of those hours are dedicated to ballet training?\n\nCR: I train 35 hours a week in ballet, contemporary, jazz, lyrical, tap and hip hop. I have about 5 private lessons a week and I take about 18 hours a week of ballet/pointe. Ballet is very important to me because it really strengthens my dancing and technique and if I miss a couple ballet classes here and there, I definitely notice a huge difference in my dancing! Usually before a competition, I will try to squeeze in a few extra ballet classes in to my schedule because it really helps that much!!\n\nDTP: I am very pleased to hear that! Maybe that will shape the image some students have of ballet. What is your favorite thing about dance?\n\nCR: My favorite thing about dance would be how I feel when I dance. It’s kind of an indescribable feeling, but it makes me almost forget about other things going on in my life and let’s me be free. It puts me in a state of openness and it makes me feel passionate and grateful that I am able to do what I do.\n\nDTP: That’s beautiful. Nothing is more rewarding than being able to surrender to music and movement. What’s been your greatest dance accomplishment to date?\n\nCR: My greatest dance accomplishment would have to be winning Teen Best Dancer 2013 at The Dance Awards last summer. It was something I had trained for all year, When I won, I was so overwhelmed, thankful and honored. I felt such a sense of accomplishment because it was my dream to be able to tour with JUMP and NUVO, learning from and working with those amazing choreographers and it came true! I still can’t believe it!\n\nDTP: If you could share one bit of information to dancers, what would it be?\n\nCR: A piece of advice for dancers would definitely be GO TO BALLET CLASS!! It seriously is SO important for your training and I can’t stress it enough! It may not be fun sometimes and it’s hard work, but it is the foundation of every dance style and there such beauty and strength in ballet.\n\nDTP: Tell us about your first solo.\n\nCR: Hahahah my first solo! Wow. Okay, I was 4 years old, and I did a singing/tap solo to ‘Hey, Look Me Over’ ! I was wearing a black and pink dress and a pink and black striped hat. I remember that I didn’t really know what I was doing and I was just having fun with it! That’s all that really matters!\n\nDTP: Tell us about your favorite solo?\n\nCR: My favorite solo I’ve ever done, would have to be my solo last year, “Remember” choreographed by Travis Wall. It meant so much to me. I remember when Travis was telling me what he wanted to do for my solo that year. He said he wanted to push my performance and really get an emotion out of me that would add to my dancing. It took me so long to figure it out, but one day I had a break-through and my teacher and I were bawling haha! It was just a solo that pushed me so much and made me a better dancer.\n\nDTP: Who is your favorite choreographer or teacher to work with to date?\n\nCR: I have been so lucky to have worked with amazing choreographers like Travis Wall, Stacey Tookey, Nick Lazzarini, Teddy Forance, Jason Parsons, Lauren Adams and Jessie Hartley-Riley. But, my favorite would definitely be Travis Wall. He is seriously my idol haha! I freak out a little whenever I see him! My friends make fun of me haha! He is just so talented and he always pushes me so much. I’ve been lucky enough to assist him this year at NUVO and it is the best feeling ever being onstage with someone you look up to so much! I really hope to be in his company, Shaping Sound, one day.\n\nDTP: You now travel a lot as The Dance Awards Teen Best Dancers. What has that taught you? Have you noticed a difference in the dancers in different parts of the country?\n\nCR: Traveling the country as Teen Best Dancer with JUMP and NUVO had been the greatest dance experience of my life!!! You build a super close relationship with all of the teachers and they really care about you and your career as a dancer and they want you to be the best you can be. It’s amazing! The tour experience has taught me so much – how to pick up choreography really fast and demonstrate it, knowing what each individual teacher is looking for, and of course being a more versatile dancer! I am really working on my hip hop this year! It’s funny because I actually notice a huge difference of the dancers in the different parts of the country I go to! They all have a really distinct style and I enjoy watching all the different ways the dancers approach the choreography. It’s an experience like no other.\n\nDTP: If you could work with any instructor or choreographer, who would it be?\n\nI’ve been so fortunate to work with people I admire SO much like Travis wall, Nick Lazzarini, Teddy Forance, Stacey tookey, Jason Parsons, Mandy Moore and so many more! Someone who I haven’t worked with would be Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson from Complexions, or Crystal Pite who works with Netherlands Dans Theatre, or Andy Pellick.\n\nDTP: What are some of your dance related goals? Some of your non-dance related goals?\n\nCR: My dance goals for the future would be to eventually get into my dream college, The Juilliard Scool! I went to their summer intensive and fell in love. Some companies that I would love to be in someday would be Shaping Sound or Stacey Tookey’s company, Still Motion. Or even some European companies like Netherlands Dans theatre. Some of my non-dance goals would be to work in the acting/singing business. I do both, and they both interest me very much. I definitely want to be involved in the entertainment business no matter what.\n\nDTP: What’s your favorite genre of dance?\n\nCR: My favorite style of dance would be contemporary or ballet for sure. Hard but fun!\n\nDTP: If you would work with any musician, who would it be and why?\n\nCR:If I could work with any musician, it would definitely be Lorde!! She is my favorite!! I’m seriously obsessed with her. I really want to see her in concert one day! But, either Lorde or Beyonce because they are my two faves!\n\nDTP: Quick – six things you can’t live without! GO!\n\nCR: 6 things I can’t live without! Wow! Ok…God, my family, my best friends, my phone, dance, and FOOD haha!\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to interview with me! I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know you better and I know that my readers and followers will as well!\n\nBe sure to follow Christina on Instagram and Twitter, and stay tuned for more great interviews, tips, and other fun dance stuff!\n\nXO,\n\n#DanceTchrProbs\n\nIntroducing Sloan-Taylor Rabinor. @sloaner7\n\nStandard\n\nI have been extremely fortunate to have worked with, for and taught some amazing dancers, choreographers and studio owners. This girl is definitely one of them. Her effervescent attitude and love for our art is truly something to be respected. She has grown to be an amazing performer and I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to watch the process. So without further ado, here is my first DanceTchrProbs interview.\n\nDanceTchrProbs: Thank you so much for giving me some time out of your already busy schedule. I know how difficult it can be to just answer a few emails in our industry, so my readers and I are very thankful! Can you give us a Cliff’s Notes version of your bio?\n\nSloan-Taylor Rabinor: Sloan-Taylor grew up and trained in Phoenix, Arizona. At the age of 17, she began traveling and assisting choreographers such as Brian Friedman, Laurieann Gibson, Wade Robson, and Mia Michaels. Sloan’s love for dance took her to Los Angeles in 2009. Starting out fresh in a new place Sloan’s ability took her straight to the top, landing her a spot as a backup dancer for Lady Gaga’s iconic performance on the 2009 VMA’s. Sloan’s talent and ambition placed her on the original screen test for “Foot Loose”. Sloan has been in music videos such as “Bad Romance” and Telephone” as well as Selena Gomez’s “Come and Get it”. She has also danced on Ellen, X Factor (UK), Oprah, AMA’s, Grammy,s , Billboard awards,and VMA’s. Her latest accomplishments include Glee and completing the Born This Way Ball, touring with Gaga for more than a year and a half and stopping in more than 20 countries.\n\nDTP: What are some valuable lessons you learned as a young competition/studio dancer?\n\nSTR: I learned how important it is to mimic the choreographer or teacher. Yes everyone needs to find a sense of self and their own movement but there is something so valuable about being able to do EXACTLY how the choreographer has asked!\n\nDTP: That is a great point. With you bringing movement quality up, I must ask. You’ve got a unique movement quality about you. Who, or what, do you attribute that to?\n\nSTR: I attribute a lot of my quirky style to Jaci Royal. She, to me, is someone who thinks so outside the box and never reuses things. I never know what to expect from her and I always feel so challenged!\n\nDTP: Challenge is great, but requires a great deal of inspiration to rise to and surpass. Who or what inspires you daily? As a dancer?\n\nSTR: Any type of physical activity inspires me daily. For example, I am newly certified as a Pilates instructor and even some of the exercises we do, I look at and say, “Ooooooh, that’s pretty!” Of course new music as always but I do find that I am most often lyrically driven. If the songs words ring true, I am so in!\n\nDTP: Run us through a typical day in your life.\n\nSTR: Oh, Lord! The life of the energizer bunny, that’s my life. Being a dancer is the life of a hustler. When people ask me what I do when I’m not on the road or working I say, “I am always working…” If I’m not getting paid, I’m training to be better at my craft. I am obsessed with fitness. I love to run, do yoga, Pilates, spin, boxing. You name it, I’m there! I think it’s so important to be a strong dancer. I might not be able to get my leg up technically but I find that when dancers start to tire out, I still have a lot more to give. I wake up everyday and eat a healthy breakfast. Then I check out the dance schedule and decide what and how many classes I will be taking. Normally bothering my agency is in there somewhere. Right now I am also trying to schedule Pilates privates every few days!\n\nDTP: Agents are a huge component of our industry as a performer. Tell us about your best audition? Worst audition? Favorite audition?\n\nSTR: My best audition was the 2009 VMA audition for Lady Gaga. It’s the audition that got me in this camp. It was also like my first big audition and I remember saying to my friends, “How weird would it be if I got this job?” When my agency called me and told me I had been put on hold, I threw my face into my covers and just shook my head.\n\nWorst audition was when I went to this random casting and they kept asking me to “furry” my “brows.” You can imagine. I obviously wasn’t getting it, haha!\n\nDTP: Gaga was a huge gig for you. What did you learn about yourself? Best memory?\n\nSTR: I learned so much about myself on the road. Of course you are always in close proximity to one another, tour buses aren’t that spacious, but you also have a lot of alone time. I learned how important it is to rest when I really need it and how important it is to reach out to loved ones just to say hi! You miss a lot of important things while traveling, like birthdays, anniversary’s, family dinners and such. You have to trust that the people who love you, really love you. But, remember that they are also human and want to know that they are being thought about and not forgotten!\n\nMy best memory on tour was my first show in Phoenix. There is NO better feeling then performing for your hometown. I cried my eyes out after I got off the stage like ” holy shit…i made it…” It’s euphoric.\n\nDTP: I remember that show! I was with your Mom. She was so proud and happy as was I! Moving away from family is always hard, not to mention the stress of being in a new place alone. Any tips to give to dancers making the move to a city and auditioning?\n\nSTR: YES! Get in front of people. Put yourself out there. Introduce yourself. They’ll never know your name if you don’t show up. This industry is about who you know, so you have to hustle to let people know you’re present! Also, get head shots and keep ’em current. It’s annoying but do it!\n\nDTP: That is all some really sound advice. Now to get to know you a little more! What was your most embarrassing dance costume growing up? Favorite costume?\n\nSTR: My most embarrassing dance costume I have ever had was in 6th grade choir and I was the feather duster from The Beauty and The Beast. My mom feathered out my jazz pants. I think she thought it was cute. I did not…ha!\n\nMy favorite costume growing up was probably my Hokey Pokey costume, done with Mario Velez, haha! It made me feel so fly! Especially with my pigtails!\n\nDTP: Favorite color? Birthday? Favorite song right now? Favorite musical act?\n\nSTR: My favorite color is orange. I feel like no one even notices it and gives it the proper love it deserves, so it’s mine, all mine. My birthday is December 10th.\n\nMy favorite song right now is probably Change by Banks. Brian [Friedman] showed it to me and I can’t stop listening to it. Like…I need help. Ha.\n\nDTP: 6 things you could not live without\n\nSTR: Almond milk, my iPod, my black lululemon pants, my sister/niece, and my legs…haha!\n\nDTP: Legs are definitely important. What’s the next big thing for Sloan-Taylor?\n\nSTR: There are so many things I feel like that are going to happen in my life. The older I get, the stronger I feel. My dream list is actually overwhelming. But, in the near future I would like to be asked to come back on tour – fingers crossed! I would also like to get my personal training certification this year as well. I feel like my life is just starting…it’s amazing.\n\nThank you so much for allowing us all to get to know you, Sloan! Be sure to follow Sloan on her social media outlets if you don’t already!\n\nInstagram: sloaner7\n\nTwitter: sloaner7\n\nBe sure to also check out her new fitness and dance blog at http://sloan-taylor.com/\n\nPhoto credits: Ian Stuart Photography, CW ARTRAVE Release party"
