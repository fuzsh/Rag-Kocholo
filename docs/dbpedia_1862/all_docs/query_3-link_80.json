That involvement started with a surprisingly emotional response (Jud has admired Young Chief Joseph for 35+ years) to a 1996 New York Times article Jud stumbled across by Timothy Egan about the Nez Perce being “invited to ‘return’ to Wallowa”. Egan’s article mentioned Taz Conner, Soy Redthunder, and Terry Crenshaw. Thanks to Soy Redthunder, Jud was able to get in touch with Taz and after an exchange of letters, met him in-person at CTUIR in Spring of 1997. He also eventually met Terry Crenshaw. In his meeting with Taz, they talked and Taz liked Jud’s illustrated book project idea: “Wallowa: 10,000 Years and Counting” - about the “return”, centered on the Tamkaliks Celebration. Jud continues to work on this project today.\n\nJud grew up in Denver, Colorado and took an early turn to art and bohemia in high school. He went to the University of Denver on a track scholarship and graduated in 1965 with a degree in painting. In 1967 he was drafted by the U.S. Army and spent two years at Ft. Campbell in Kentucky. Jud is a father and grandfather, a 3-4 day/week bike-rider, and an artist with a long, varied history. He has had exhibitions in NYC, Boston, Denver, San Francisco, Slovenia, Japan, and South Korea. Between 1984 and 2003, Jud built parade floats with his late friend Kip Farris. Jud is also the author of The Book of Jabbo: Revelations in Six Languages.

In a hurry to get home to eastern Oregon, she worked in the family trade of horse & mule packing into the Lostine & Minam drainages. During that time, she frequented the Tick Hill trail on the grounds, volunteered at the Nez Perce in the Wallowa Art Show and built relationships with many of the local people involved in the project. As a culmination of an assortment of non-profit experiences, in 2013 she came onboard at the Nez Perce Wallowa Homeland as the Office Manager, happy for the opportunity to support one of few intercultural organizations in the area.\n\nMary is determined to bring up her two children here and see them share her strong connection to the Wallowa mountains. Her work at the Homeland has given her a better understanding of how to steward this place, pass that along to her family, and understand the many ways it has shaped the people who have lived here; past, present, and future. In addition to her work at the Homeland, Mary is also a chicken farmer and operates a state inspected poultry processing facility. Her legendary chicken feed recipe is now carried by Grain Growers and sold by the ton.\n\nExofficio, Confederated Tribes of the Umatillia Indian Reservation\n\nBobbie is the director of Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, a museum on the Umatilla Reservation.

He worked closely with Taz Conner and Terry Crenshaw, serving as Chair for most of the 90’s when the organization was young and they really had to work hard to convince people that the project was for real. In a similar vein to his 30 year commitment to the Lion’s Club, Jo has remained an active partner in NPWH activities for the last 26 years. He has contributed countless hours and personal funds to the cause, and in years past you could always find him holding the drum mic during Tamkaliks. “Bottom line, we’re all alike … especially kids.
