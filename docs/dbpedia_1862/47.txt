The Boston music scene has been undergoing major shifts this year, with the closure in January of the Sound Museum — a popular practice space in Allston — and the opening of one of its successor in Dorchester last month. More than 800 musicians have been dealing with the convulsions caused by various development projects and property shifts forcing them to find new options to keep their art alive.

William “Des” Desmond, whose family ran the Sound Museum in various locations for decades, also runs Magic Room in Norwood, an intimate and memorable music venue located in the Norwood Space Center.

Music flows through the Desmond family, with Casey Desmond — Des’ daughter — having a musical career of her own. In 2011, she appeared on The Voice, on a team coached by Adam Levine of Maroon 5. She has four albums to her credit.

Deeply devoted to ensuring a vibrant music scene in and around Boston, Des and family have turned the Magic Room into the kind of venue that is fun on its own, with trinkets and collectibles throughout, a great stage, fantastic lighting and sound, and a growing awareness of the kind of one-of-a-kind evening fans can have there.

Tribute bands have become the norm for Magic Room this year, and we’re pleased to be bringing the music of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers to life in this unique setting — and in a part of Boston we don’t get to visit often.

To join us for this special evening, buy your tickets now. They are $20 each pre-sale, and $25 each the day of the show.

WooHoo!!
