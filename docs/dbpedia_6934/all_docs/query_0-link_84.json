In Hattingen, the chance of a wet day over the course of September is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 33% and ending it at 29%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 38% on December 25, and its lowest chance is 26% on March 3.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during September in Hattingen is essentially constant, remaining about 2.3 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 4.2 inches or falling below 1.0 inches.\n\nThe highest average 31-day accumulation is 2.3 inches on September 10.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of September in Hattingen, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 52 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 3 minutes, 53 seconds, and weekly decrease of 27 minutes, 8 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is September 30, with 11 hours, 40 minutes of daylight and the longest day is September 1, with 13 hours, 32 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Hattingen is 6:44 AM on September 1 and the latest sunrise is 46 minutes later at 7:30 AM on September 30.\n\nThe latest sunset is 8:16 PM on September 1 and the earliest sunset is 1 hour, 6 minutes earlier at 7:10 PM on September 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Hattingen during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during September, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:14 AM and sets 16 hours, 37 minutes later, at 9:51 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:34 AM and sets 7 hours, 51 minutes later, at 4:24 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Hattingen is essentially constant during September, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 13, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 2% of the time, while on October 7, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Hattingen is essentially constant during September, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 9.4 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on January 17, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 12.7 miles per hour, while on August 4, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.3 miles per hour.\n\nThe wind direction in Hattingen during September is predominantly out of the west from September 1 to September 29 and the south from September 29 to September 30.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Hattingen typically lasts for 7.0 months (215 days), from around April 10 to around November 11, rarely starting before March 15 or after April 30, and rarely ending before October 16 or after December 6.\n\nThe month of September in Hattingen is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in September in Hattingen\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in September in Hattingengrowing seasonSep1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292930300%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%AugOct100%Sep 16100%Sep 1690%Oct 1690%Oct 16NowNowvery coldcoldcoolcomfortablewarm\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Hattingen are increasing during September, increasing by 251Â°F, from 1,612Â°F to 1,863Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Hattingen is decreasing during September, falling by 1.5 kWh, from 4.4 kWh to 2.9 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Hattingen are 51.399 deg latitude, 7.186 deg longitude, and 331 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Hattingen contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 561 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 364 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (1,224 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (3,209 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Hattingen is covered by artificial surfaces (43%), cropland (22%), trees (18%), and grassland (17%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (46%) and cropland (29%), and within 50 miles by cropland (45%) and trees (22%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Hattingen, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Hattingen.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Hattingen according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Hattingen is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Hattingen and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nDÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (EDDL, 42%, 20 mi, southwest, -187 ft elevation change)\n\nDortmund Airport (EDLW, 41%, 20 mi, northeast, 92 ft elevation change)\n\nCologne Bonn Airport (EDDK, 17%, 37 mi, south, -30 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Hattingen and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
