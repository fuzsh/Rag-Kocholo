        "text": "Perc is one of modern electronic music’s reference points: an internationally touring DJ and live act, founder of the scene leading Perc Trax label and one of the most respected producers in techno today. From his earliest releases in 2002 to his current position as one of the most forward-thinking individuals in techno Perc (aka London based Ali Wells) has continued to challenge and innovate as his recognition has grown.\n\nAs a performer Perc has taken his sound across the world to such seminal clubs as Berghain, Fabric, Tresor, Fuse, Space Ibiza, Concrete, Unit in Tokyo and to festivals including Awakenings, Glastonbury, Unpolished, Mayday, Reaktor, Unsound, Dour, Soenda, 10 Days Off, Extrema and many more.\n\n2017 saw Perc reach a new heights as his ‘Bitter Music’ LP not only launched an extensive world tour but also produced the biggest track of his career in the shape of the infamous ‘Look What You Love Has Done To Me’, one of the most played techno tracks of that year. After remixing his way through 2018, he revealed his first original release in two years when ‘Three Tracks To Send To Your Ghost Producer’ came out in March 2019.\n\n2020 saw Perc charge into a new decade with headline sets at Unpolished and Vault Sessions in the Netherlands and his first ever gigs in China and Taiwan, plus his debut at New York’s must play spot Basement. Three tracks have now been adapted from his Unpolished set to create ‘Fire In Negative’ his first full EP release in almost 18 months, being released once again on his own Perc Trax label.\n\nAfter 18 months hidden away in this studio as the UK went through a succession of Covid-19 lockdowns, Perc emerged at the end of 2021 reinvigorated and with a new three track EP ‘Greed Dance’ to release on Perc Trax. This post-pandemic momentum has pushed him into 2022 with releases on Possession, RAW and his own ‘Dirt’ single on Perc Trax in September 2022 plus a radical remix of Marc Acardipane’s hardcore classic ‘Pitch-Hiker’. Add to this gigs across Europe including two stand out sets at Awakenings, extensive tours of North & South America, Australia and Asia and it is clear the Perc shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.\n\nRead More"
