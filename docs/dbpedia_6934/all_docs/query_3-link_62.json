        "text": "Overview\n\nExperience the Middle Ages with 1,111 steps around the Old Town Hall. We start at the legendary Horkenstein and follow the course of the medieval city wall before we take a closer look at the most famous sights of the romantic old town with the customs house, the iron house, the old town hall and the St. Georg church. Finally, we visit - if requested - outside of the regular opening times, perhaps the most beautiful, but certainly the most famous, half-timbered house in the old town of Hattingen: the iron house with the museum of the local club Hattingen / Ruhr. When our city tour ends at the Horkenstein again, you will have learned about early petrifications, medieval toilets, inner city fountains and urban redevelopment plans. In the museum in the iron house from 1611, house fountains, creaking oak floorboards, low doors and small sash windows promise pure timber framing joy!"
