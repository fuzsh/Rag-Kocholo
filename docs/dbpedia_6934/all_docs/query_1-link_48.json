        "text": "FROM A RIBBON FACTORY TO EUROPE'S LEADING RIBBON PRODUCER.\n\nOur family-run company’s success story began early on: established in 1893 as a raffia ribbon factory, the international breakthrough came in 1974 with decorative ribbons.\n\nToday, export accounts for 30 % of the annual sales volume. In 1990, the subsidiary MOREX was founded for the American market.\n\nOur continuous corporate development growth is the result of consistent innovation in production technology and a sure sense of new trends and target groups.\n\nWith this know-how C.E. PATTBERG is today one of the most versatile ribbon manufacturers. The own brand PRÄSENT is known worldwide and is rightly considered a synonym for decorative ribbons.\n\nQUALITY MADE IN GERMANY\n\nOur extensive know how makes us one of the most diverse manufacturers, whose brand PRÄSENT obtained worldwide brand awareness for decorative ribbons of the highest quality. PRÄSENT ribbons add that special something to everyday life and give each occasion its own unique touch – whether for presents, arts and crafts or décor. All of our products are made in Germany – something that is near and dear to our hearts. Our production in a three-shift operation with 160 employees guarantees that your large orders are completed on time.\n\nDecorative ribbons are, however, only one aspect of our product line. In our 40,000 m² production area, we also manufacture technical films and labeling tape for top international companies in the cable industry."
