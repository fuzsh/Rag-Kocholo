        "text": "Background: Collagenous colitis is clinically characterized by watery diarrhoea and can histologically be diagnosed by a thickening of the subepithelial collagen layer and an inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. So far, the pathogenesis of collagenous colitis and the role of luminal factors remain unclear.\n\nMethods: This clinical pilot investigation was conducted with an open-label design to monitor the clinical effects of EcN on stool frequency and stool consistency in 14 patients (11 female, 3male; age: 58.1 +/- 9.6 years). Due to the open-label protocol EcN was administered at different doses (1 - 6 capsules/day containing 2.5 - 25 x 10 (9) viable bacteria each). Except for two patients who discontinued treatment, therapy duration was at least 4 weeks.\n\nResults: The results indicate a marked clinical response to the oral administration of EcN with a reduction of the stool frequency > or = 50 % in 9/14 (64 %) patients. Stool frequency clearly (p = 0.034) decreased from 7.6 +/- 4.8/day to 3.7 +/- 5.8/day at the end of therapy (between 4 and 18 weeks). Moreover, stool consistency changed in 7/14 patients from watery or slimy to soft (6 pts) and normal (1 pt), respectively."
