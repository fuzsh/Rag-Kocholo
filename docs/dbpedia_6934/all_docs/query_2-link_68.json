        "text": "Tailor-made design and customised fabrication capabilities\n\nOur engineers are constantly improving designs and systems to ensure longevity, increased effectiveness and reduced wear.\n\nMade in Germany, our modular systems and experienced products guarantee safety, the highest quality and optimised performance.\n\nDevelopment of mining innovations\n\nHalbach & Braun contributes to the research and developments of mining technology with innovative designs for conveyor systems, including armoured face conveyors (AFC) and beam stage loaders (BSL).\n\nWe also develop double life pans, smart pans, cross frames, side and overhead discharges, roller curves, coal ploughs, main and tail drives, belt drives, gearboxes, shark sprockets, boot ends (Matilda) and impact or pick drum crusher systems for a wide range of materials.\n\nThese include coal, lignite, granite, limestone, oil shale, oil sand, salt, slag and ore.\n\nIn addition to this, our high-quality product range also includes chain and belt gearboxes and complete drive systems. All this enables us to supply customised and advanced solutions that meet the individual needs of our customers worldwide.\n\nOpen-pit and bunker discharge systems\n\nGranite and other solid rocks, limestone, oil shale, salt, slag, ore and furthermore are mined in large quantities.\n\nHere, too, we are able to supply complete open pit / bunker discharge systems for transport and crushing these various materials. Stationary, semi-mobile or mobile plants are available for different applications.\n\nFully and semi-automatic mining 4.0 systems\n\nWith our expert knowledge and the strength of our partners, we are going to be able to supply complete mining 4.0 systems for all mines worldwide.\n\nMining 4.0 is a synonym for all innovative activities on the raw material sector with a focus on automation, autonomy, networking and artificial intelligence.\n\nRenowned mining solutions\n\nHalbach & Braun’s longwall mining, short wall mining, pillar extraction and quarry systems are used all over the world.\n\nMany companies have already become long-term partners and increased their performance using our equipment.\n\nIf you too want to enhance your productivity, please ask our sales department in our headquarters for reference lists and more information.\n\nAbout Halbach & Braun\n\nThe mining industry has a long history in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, particularly in the Ruhr region, the major industrial conurbation along the Ruhr River.\n\nCoal mining is still going to play an important role in the future. The extremely dangerous and arduous work requires constant innovation in equipment and technology to reach the highest safety for miners, machines and environment worldwide.\n\nOur regular innovations and inventions have helped to shape the mining industry for almost one 100 years. Our first patent, the Schüttelrutsche or jigger conveyor, was followed by the first single chain conveyor system ever produced."
