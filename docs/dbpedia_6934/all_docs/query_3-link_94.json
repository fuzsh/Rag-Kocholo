Here you can stroll through narrow streets and enjoy the half-timbered houses from different eras. The Old Town Hall and St. George's Church are particularly worth seeing. The Henrichshütte Museum in the nearby district of Westfalen is also worth a visit: there you can learn all about the history of the iron and steel industry in the region.\n\nCultural highlights can also be discovered in Hattingen: The Theatre on the Volme offers a wide range of programmes from plays to cabaret, while the LWL Open-Air Museum in Hagen provides an insight into life in the countryside in earlier times.\n\nThose who enjoy culinary delights will be delighted by the regional specialities: be sure to try the famous \"Rübenkraut\" - a spread made from sugar beet syrup - or enjoy hearty home cooking such as beef roulades or kale with Mettwurst.\n\nFor outdoor activities, the nearby Baldeneysee is particularly suitable: here you can go sailing, surfing or simply stroll along the shore. Lake Harkort is also a popular destination - there are numerous opportunities for fishing and swimming.\n\nAnd what to do if the weather doesn't cooperate? Then a visit to the Hattingen leisure pool is a good idea: Here you can swim, take a sauna or whizz down the giant slide.\n\nAll in all, Hattingen is definitely worth a trip - whether as a day trip from surrounding towns such as Bochum or Dortmund or as a longer destination for anyone looking for peace and nature.
