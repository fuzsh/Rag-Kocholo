        "text": "Get ready to enter a paradise of shopping and entertainment. Ruhr Park is Bochum's popular local shopping destination with endless shops, cafes and restaurants. Popular with the younger crowd, the mall has over 120 stores with well-known brands like H & M, Esprit, Orsay and many more. The dining options here are plenty as there is a food-court called Via Bartolo. If you're in the mood for shopping, this is definitely your one-stop shopping destination.\n\nLocated right near the center of the city, Carlplatz is one of the most prominent streets in the area. It is lined on one side by the Benrather Street, which is another famous stretch. In the area surrounding this street lie attractions like the Düsseldorfer Marionetten-Theater, and several restaurant and eateries, thus making Carlplatz a must on your list of places to visit in the city. The street is also where the weekly Farmer's Market takes place.\n\nWhen it was built in 1804, the 'Kö', as it is affectionately known to locals, was situated in a slightly run-down area on the edge of the city. As Dusseldorf grew, Königsallee became more central and things really took off after a face-lift at the start of the 20th Century. An underground station was opened, the pavements were widened and the street lamps, kiosks and telephone boxes were restored. Nowadays the boulevard is Dusseldorf's number one shopping street and has enhanced the city's reputation as being one of Europe's major fashion centers.\n\nHeinemann Confiserie is a renowned name in Germany for their excellent pastries, chocolates and Champagne truffle. Founded by Hermann Heinemann in 1932, they have many branches in various German cities. Dusseldorf itself has four including two cafe-restaurants. This one in Königsallee is a popular spot for sweet lovers. Shop for their delicate confections such as truffles, tortes, candies, cakes, chocolates and other baked goodies. These delightful treats are beautifully packed and neatly arranged. Definitely tempting and equally delicious, they also make an excellent gift choice.\n\nDesigned by Walter Brune, Schadow Arkaden opened its doors in 1994. This rhombus-shaped shopping center has over 55 stores including salons and a gym. Spread across two levels, shop for the latest designs in their branded boutiques such as Arqueonautas, Zara and Esprit or for beauty products. For a unique gift, Jochen Schweizer and David Geschenke are great options. Theater an der Kö is a nice spot to catch up on the latest in the city's theater scene. There are plenty of dining options as well with the likes of Poccino, Palatini, Bullhut BBQ, Mr. Wok and Metzgerei / Bistro Ludwig. Schadow Arkaden is a wonderful place for retail therapy when in Dusseldorf-Stadtmitte.\n\nGaleria Kaufhof celebrated its 120th birthday in 1999. There is something for everyone here, workaholics, for example, have the opportunity to do their grocery shopping in the basement supermarket up until 8p. You can also find all your household gadgets in this section. Cosmetics, hosiery, jewelry, watches and stationery can be found on the ground floor. The first floor is entirely devoted to women's needs: small boutiques such as Esprit, Mexx, Oasis and More and More have taken residence here. Men and children, naturally, are catered for on the upper floors."
