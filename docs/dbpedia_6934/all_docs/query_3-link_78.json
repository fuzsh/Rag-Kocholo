        "text": "The Bügeleisenhaus, located in the old town of Hattingen in the southern Ruhr area, is a half-timbered house built in 1611. Its unique shape, reminiscent of an iron, has given it its name. This distinctive shape is a result of the house's location at the intersection of two alleys.\n\nThe Bügeleisenhaus as a Museum\n\nFrom 1962 to 2021, the Bügeleisenhaus was home to the Museum of the Hattingen/Ruhr Local History Association. The building's trapezoidal floor plan, which narrows towards the south side, follows the course of the two intersecting alleys.\n\nCurrent Status of the Bügeleisenhaus\n\nAs of December 5, 2021, the museum located in the Bügeleisenhaus has been closed and the building is no longer open to the public."
