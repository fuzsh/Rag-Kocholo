The provision of Section 59 UrhG conforms to the directive based on Art. 5 Para. 3 Letter c of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 22, 2001 on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related property rights in the information society (\"InfoSoc-RL\") to be interpreted. The directive-compliant interpretation shows that aerial photographs are also covered by § 59 Para. 1 UrhG and the use of tools does not lead out of the protective barrier. www.klebba.legal"
