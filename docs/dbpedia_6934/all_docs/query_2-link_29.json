        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nArterial spin labeling (ASL) (2,3) employs spatially selective RF pulses to create noninvasive perfusion or angiographic images. Conventional ASL uses RF pulses to label the endogenous blood water protons from all feeding blood vessels. However, control over which arteries are labeled can be used to measure the tissue regions that are perfused by particular vessels (4–8) and to characterize the dynamics of flow through vessels, occlusions (9), arteriovenous malformations (10), and aneurysms (11). Related information obtained with catheter angiography is already widely used for clinical management (12–14), but catherization poses much greater risk than MRI (15).\n\nArterial selective labeling with ASL requires creating an image where only blood flowing through the artery of interest is labeled while the other arteries are unlabeled. Multiple approaches to achieving such selective labeling have been proposed, as described in a recent review (16). The use of selective RF pulses for pulsed labeling can achieve hemispheric selective or even individual vessel selective labeling (6,8,16). Continuous ASL methods can provide higher perfusion signal and signal-to-noise ratio and may provide simpler and more precise labeling of individual vessels. A separate RF coil to label blood can be used for vessel selective continuous labeling (17–19), but this requires special hardware and a substantial distance from labeling plane to the imaging region. As an alternative, magnetic field gradients can be used for localization of labeling with continuous ASL. A continuous ASL method using an oblique labeling plane combined with a head transmit receive RF coil has been reported (7,20). This method is not compatible with large volume transmission and array coil reception, however. Werner et al. (21) introduced a modification of the amplitude modulated control method (22) for multislice continuous ASL in which the labeling plane is tilted and rotated such that only blood flow in the neighborhood of a single point could be efficiently labeled. Though the tilting of the labeling plane requires a greater distance between the labeling location and the imaging region than for non-selective ASL, this approach was highly successful for selective labeling.\n\nThe introduction of pulsed continuous ASL (pCASL) (23,24) has made continuous labeling more practical on clinical scanners and also increased labeling efficiency relative to the amplitude modulated control technique. Since pCASL introduced gaps between RF pulses, additional gradients can be added to localize labeling without tilting the labeling plane. Wong has reported a strategy to encode all vessels of interest using Hadamard type encoding (25) based on pCASL. To achieve this encoding, images are acquired with fixed gradients perpendicular to the labeling plane added. While this approach is efficient for characterizing flow through all vessels, it requires a relatively complex geometric prescription of the scan, and may require measurement of labeling efficiencies of each vessel to correct for imperfect Hadamard encoding. Measuring selective flow though one vessel may be all that is required, for example, when stenosis in a particular vessel, or collateral flow from a particular territory is being assessed. Selective labeling of an individual vessel, analogous to single vessel catheter injection, may be desirable.\n\nHere we propose a single artery selective labeling method that requires only the specification of the target vessel position as input. The method employs pCASL to achieve high continuous labeling efficiencies. Rotating in-plane gradients are added to pCASL to achieve localized labeling while spoiling the undesired labeling of other vessels. This method effectively labels a disc around the targeted vessel ( )\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPulse Sequence Design\n\nThe selective labeling method is based on PCASL (23), which can achieve high labeling efficiency for vessels across the labeling plane. The labeling of PCASL is achieved with a train of equally spaced, selective RF pulses. The labeling achieved is comparable to that of a constant RF and gradient with amplitudes equal to the time average of the RF and gradients for the PCASL. Our modification of the PCASL pulse sequence to achieve single artery selective labeling is shown in . In addition to the labeling gradient along the flow direction, we introduced in-plane gradients between the RF pulses. The in-plane gradients produce a phase shift between vessels. Single vessel selectivity is then achieved by rotating the direction of the in-plane gradients in analogy to the method of Werner et al. (21). Application of the gradients in the gaps between the RF pulses does not tilt the labeling plane, and hence the interference with nearby tissue above the labeling plane that can occur with the Werner et al. method need not occur with PCASL.\n\nThe in-plane rotating gradients should selectively label a disc. The center of the selective disc is on the targeted single vessel. The center of the disc is controlled in the pulse sequence by the phases of the RF pulses. Each RF pulse must be incremented in phase relative to the prior pulse by an angle determined by the applied gradients and the desired disc center. This phase shift is given by\n\nΔφ = γGzaveΔzΔt + γGxaveΔxΔt + γGyaveΔyΔt\n\n[1]\n\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, Δt is the time spacing between the center of two RF pulses, Gzave, Gxave, Gyave are the time average gradients between the center of two RF pulses along z, x and y directions respectively, Δz is the offset distance from the isocenter to the labeling plane, Δx is the projection distance of the segment from the isocenter to the target vessel along the gradient x direction, and Δy is the projection distance along the gradient y direction (see ).\n\nThe fully refocused control approach (23) was found unsuitable for selective labeling because the control always produced less labeling than the label. Instead, the control of Wong (25), which employs the same gradients as the label but with alternating RF pulse sign was used.\n\nNumerical Simulations\n\nNumerical simulation of the Bloch equations was used to explore the labeling efficiency for vessels as a function of distance from the targeted vessel. Integration of the Bloch equations was performed for a blood isochromat starting 10s x velocity below the labeling plane, until ending 10s x velocity above the labeling plane, with an integration step size of 0.01 ms. The integration employed finite rotations around the effective field to increase accuracy with modest step size (26). T1 and T2 relaxation were included in the simulation but any magnetization transfer (MT) effects were not. The simulation was implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.). It required 1 s to calculate the efficiency for each velocity on a 1.8 GHz Pentium III Dell Inspiron 700m computer with Windows XP.\n\nA Hanning window shaped RF pulse of 500 μs duration with an average B1 amplitude of 1.7 μT and a spacing between two RF pulses of 1500 μs was used. A longitudinal gradient amplitude Gzmax of 9 mT/m during the RF pulse and a time average z gradient Gzave of 0.5 mT/m were assumed. Average in-plane gradient strengths Gxy (0.2–1.0 mT/m), and rotation rates between two consecutive RF pulses Δθ (10°–90°) were explored. Due to unsatisfactory results with fixed amplitude in-plane gradients (see results), amplitude modulation (AM) was explored. In the rotating strategy with AM, only a 15° rotation rate between two consecutive RF pulses was simulated. We multiplied the in-plane gradient amplitudes by a modulation function. This modulation function was constant within each Δt. Across Δt’s, the modulation function was a periodic triangle function. A periodic triangle function with minimum value 0.5 and maximum value 1.5, with period TAM of NAM (192 in this study) times the Δt was used ( ). Several kinds of different modulation waveforms were explored. The waveforms were based on triangle function y (i) = 2/NAM (i%NAM − NAM/2) + 0.5, square function y(i)=4.8/NAM2(i%NAM−NAM/2)2+0.6, square root function y(i)=6/7·(2/NAM·∣i%NAM−NAM/2∣+0.5), and exponential function y(i) = (e2/TAM (i%TAM−TAM/2) +0.5)/(e − 0.5), where y(i) is the modulation value for the ith Δt, and % is modulus operator. The triangle function was chosen because the residual peaks of the triangle function were the smallest compared with other functions. The much larger period of the AM than the gradient rotation period was chosen to achieve slow modulation of the in-plane gradient amplitudes. The modulation was tended to modify the amplitude of the rotating gradients in a slow speed so that it can mimic the superstition of selective profiles with different rotating gradient amplitudes. For the rotating strategy with fixed amplitude, the residual peaks were both with positive and negative signals. Changing gradient amplitude corresponds to changing radius of labeling disc, which tends to cancel positive and negative gradients. Relaxation times T1 and T2 of 1.55 s (27) and 0.25 s (28) for blood were assumed.\n\nBecause simulations of the single vessel PCASL approach show sensitivity to the relative timing of the RF waveforms and the time the spin crosses the labeling plane, the labeling efficiency for a single velocity was calculated by averaging the efficiency with different delays between the RF waveform and the spin position timing. The delays varied from zero to the total period of the RF and gradient waveforms. A step size equal to one fifth of an RF spacing was used. In the case of the rotating strategy with the fixed amplitude for in-plane gradients, the period was Δt times 360/Δθ; while in the case of the rotating strategy with amplitude modulation, the period was TAM. Laminar flow (vmax is the velocity at the center of the vessel) was assumed to estimate the labeling efficiency over the vessel’s cross-section. The total efficiency for a vessel with laminar flow was calculated as the weighted average of the efficiencies at many different individual velocities (26):\n\neff=2vmax2∫0vmaxvε(v)dv\n\n[2]\n\nwhere ε(v) is the T1 decay corrected efficiency for spins with velocity v. T1 decay corrected efficiency compensates for blood T1 relaxation after passing the labeling plane. The integration was evaluated within an error of 1% of the efficiency value using a recursive adaptive Simpson quadrature algorithm (29). The labeling efficiency was simulated for a range of vessel velocities.\n\nBecause static magnetic field perturbations may cause the resonance frequency of spins at the labeling plane to differ from the expected value for a uniform field and gradient, we also explored the effect of off-resonance on labeling efficiency.\n\nIn vivo Measurements\n\nIn vivo studies were performed to show the feasibility of the single artery selective ASL on human subjects and to verify the consistency between the in vivo efficiency and simulation results. Single artery selective PCASL was implemented to test for the artery selectivity of the pulse. A hanning window shaped pulse of 500 μs duration with average RF irradiation amplitude of 1.7 μT, a time between successive RF pulses of 1.5 ms, and a labeling duration of 1.5 s were chosen; Longitudinal gradient amplitude of 9 mT/m during the RF pulse, with average gradient amplitude of 0.5 mT/m were used; Average in-plane gradient amplitude of 0.28 mT/m, and a rotation rate of 15° increment between RF pulse repetitions were chosen. A post-labeling delay of 1.5 s (30) was selected to allow enough time for the labeled blood to arrive in the region of interest. Nonselective PCASL was performed within the same acquisition, immediately after selective pulsed-continuous ASL sequence, to serve as an efficiency reference.\n\nAll labeling strategies were implemented before a single-shot Fast spin echo (FSE) sequence with a partial k-space image acquisition. The sequence was performed with a TE of 25 ms in a 5-mm-thick axial slice through the superior part of the lateral ventricles. FSE images were obtained using 64 × 64 matrix on a 24-cm field of view. Raw data were saved from each channel of the coil array. The total time between image acquisitions, including labeling preparation and FSE echo train was 6 s.\n\nEight different subjects (five males and three females, 21–50 years old) were studied. The study protocols were approved by the local institutional review board and all subjects provided written informed consent. Imaging was performed on a GE 3.0 Tesla HD scanner using the receive-only 8-channel head array coil and the body transmit coil. Two separate studies were performed. Both studies began with a brain localizer and a 3-dimensional MR angiogram to choose the labeling location.\n\nThe first study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of artery selective labeling with near optimal parameters from the simulations. Perfusion territory images were acquired with labeling of the left internal carotid, right internal carotid and basilar artery in four volunteers. The amplitude modulated version of the selective labeling strategy was employed. Each sequence automatically acquired 4 dummy scans to achieve steady state magnetization, 12 interleaved artery selective label and control pairs and 12 interleaved nonselective pairs for a total scan time of 5.2 minutes.. The superior inferior labeling location of the basilar artery was placed approximately 1.3 cm superior to the merging of the vertebral arteries. At this level, the internal carotid arteries are approximately 2.6 cm from the basilar artery. The labeling plane for the internal carotid arteries was selected 1.3 cm inferior to the merging of vertebral arteries so the two internal carotid arteries are well separated. The center of each target vessel was measured on the 3D MR angiogram and then numerical values were entered into the sequence as user control variables.\n\nThe second study was designed to measure the inversion efficiency profile as a function of distance offset between the center of labeling and the target artery. Four volunteers were imaged in this study. Perfusion signal was measured at distance offsets from the targeted internal carotid artery of 3 mm towards the posterior direction, 0 mm and 3 mm, 9 mm, 15 mm, 22 mm, 29 mm, 36 mm, 43 mm, 50 mm, 70 mm towards the anterior direction. The amplitude modulated version of the selective labeling strategy was employed. For each distance offset, the sequence was performed for 28 repetitions: 4 repetitions for signal stabilization, 6 label and control pairs of artery selective labeling, and 6 pairs for nonselective labeling. We chose the right internal carotid as the target artery. As an add-on to this study, we investigated whether the amplitude modulated in-plane gradients were required as predicted by simulation. We measured the efficiencies for the rotating strategy both with fixed amplitude and with amplitude modulation at certain fixed distance offsets. Due to time restrictions, we could only measure the efficiency at a single distance offset in each volunteer (115 mm with two volunteers, 235 mm with one volunteer, 330 mm with one volunteer, all towards the anterior direction).\n\nTo show the feasibility of volumetric acquisition with selective labeling, control minus label difference images were acquired in 2 volunteers with the 2D sequence replaced with an interleaved 3D sequence. The amplitude modulated version of the labeling was employed and applied to the right internal carotid artery. Background suppression with the selective region expanded to a 192-mm axial slab was performed and image acquisition was an interleaved stack-of-spirals FSE acquisition. One of eight interleaved spiral gradient waveforms was performed for each excitation at each of 40 centrically-ordered slice encodes. The eight interleaves were acquired in separate acquisitions with a TR of 6 s. Three averages of label and control pairs required a total of 288 s. The resulting images had nominal in-plane resolution of 3.4 mm and slice thickness of 4 mm.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAll image data were saved as raw echo intensities and reconstructed offline with custom software. Partial Fourier raw data was acquired at lines −m ≤ u ≤ N/2 (m = 6, N= 64). The low frequency phase map of each coil was estimated from the average signal of the control image in the nonselective PCASL. The low-resolution phase maps were used to correct the phase of the image from each coil. The final image was combined from each coil image, weighted by the conjugate of the low-resolution phase map (31).\n\nFor the first study, region of interests (ROIs) for each subject were manually drawn on the selective PCASL images: left internal carotid territory, right internal carotid territory, and basilar territory. Regions of interest for the two anterior and the posterior territories were defined using the known anatomy and the clear separation of the territories on the selective images. To avoid any contribution of multiple vessels near the boundaries of the territories, ROI’s were restricted to the center of the territories. For the second study, the target artery (right internal carotid) territory was drawn on the selective PCASL image. Contralateral ROI’s were drawn on the subtraction image between nonselective and selective.\n\nThe difference between control and label was averaged across all repetitions for selective PCASL and nonselective PCASL. The relative efficiency of selective PCASL was defined as the ratio of the average difference signal over the ROI between selective PCASL and nonselective PCASL. The relative efficiency was calculated for the target territory ROI and the contralateral ROI for each distance offset of the second study."
