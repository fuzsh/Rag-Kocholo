He followed it with a supporting role in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), and a starring role as Rust Cohle in the first season of HBO's crime anthology series True Detective (2014), for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. His subsequent film roles include starring in Interstellar (2014) and The Gentlemen (2019), as well as voice work in Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), Sing (2016), and Sing 2 (2021).\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMatthew David McConaughey was born on November 4, 1969 in Uvalde, Texas.[1][2] He has Irish heritage, particularly from the County Cavan/County Monaghan area.[3] His mother, Mary Kathleen (née McCabe), a published author and a former kindergarten teacher,[4] was from Trenton, New Jersey.[5] His father, James Donald McConaughey, also had Irish roots.[3] He was born in Mississippi in 1929 and raised in Louisiana[6] where he ran an oil pipe supply business; he played for the Kentucky Wildcats and the Houston Cougars college football teams.[7] Jim was selected by the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) in the 27th round of the 1953 NFL draft. He was released before the season began and never played an official league game in the NFL.[8] McConaughey's parents married each other three times, having divorced each other twice.[9] He has two older brothers, Michael and Patrick (who was adopted).[10] Michael, nicknamed \"Rooster\", is a millionaire who starred in the CNBC docu-series West Texas Investors Club.[11] The family were Methodists.[12]\n\nHe is a relative of Confederate brigadier general Dandridge McRae.[13]\n\nMcConaughey moved to Longview, Texas, in 1980[5] and later attended Longview High School. In 1988 he went to Australia thinking he would be attending a high school in Sydney. Instead he lived in Warnervale, New South Wales for a year while he went to Gorokan High School (he was a Rotary Youth Exchange student) and worked as an assistant for an attorney and as a bank teller for ANZ.[14][15]\n\nHe attended the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin), where he joined the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.[16] He began in the fall of 1989 and graduated in the spring of 1993 with a Bachelor of Science in Radio-Television-Film.[17]\n\nHis original plan changed as he had wanted to attend Southern Methodist University until one of his brothers told him that private-school tuition would have been a burden on the family's finances. He had planned to attend law school after graduation from college[18] but discovered he did not have any interest in becoming a lawyer.[5]\n\nCareer\n\nEarly 1990s–2000: Breakthrough and rise to prominence\n\nIn the early 1990s.

He was not originally cast in the film, as the role of Wooderson was originally small and meant to be cast locally for budget purposes.[27] At the time of casting, he was a film student at the University of Texas in Austin and went out with his girlfriend to the Hyatt hotel bar.[28] He approached casting director Don Phillips.[29] Phillips recalls, \"The bartender says to him, 'See that guy down there? That's Don Phillips. He cast Sean Penn in Fast Times.' And Matthew goes, 'I'm gonna go down and talk to this guy.'\" Phillips also recalls that Linklater didn't like McConaughey at first \"because he was too handsome\". During production, another character named Pickford was meant to be a larger role. Due to the behavior of the actor playing Pickford with other cast members, his screen time was cut in favor of McConaughey's character, Wooderson. Linklater recalled \"There was another actor who was kind of the opposite [of McConaughey]. He wasn't really getting along with everybody. I could tell the actors weren't responding to him.\"[30] Much of the Wooderson role was improvised or written on the spot.[30] Dazed and Confused was released on September 24, 1993, in 183 theaters, grossing $918,127 on its opening weekend. It went on to make $7.9 million in North America.[31] The film received positive reviews from critics. The film generally gets favorable reviews.[32] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 92% approval rating. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Featuring an excellent ensemble cast, a precise feel for the 1970s, and a killer soundtrack, Dazed and Confused is a funny, affectionate, and clear-eyed look at high school life.\"[33] In her review for The Austin Chronicle, Marjorie Baumgarten gave particular praise to Matthew McConaughey's performance: \"He is a character we're all too familiar with in the movies, but McConaughey nails this guy without a hint of condescension or whimsy, claiming this character for all time as his own\".[34]\n\nIn 1994, McConaughey acted in Angels in the Outfield, The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Daniel Johnston's music video \"Life in Vain\".\n\nMcConaughey acted in Herbert Ross' Boys on the Side, which premiered on February 3, 1995.[35] That year he also acted in a crime thriller, Brian Cox's Scorpion Spring.[36] John Sayles' Lone Star (1996) is a neo-Western mystery film set in a small town in South Texas.

Jackson, and Kevin Spacey share the top billing. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 67%. The critics' consensus reads: \"Overlong and superficial, A Time to Kill nonetheless succeeds on the strength of its skillful craftsmanship and top-notch performances\".[40] In the U.S. it reached number one during its first two weeks and grossed over $108 million domestically, and an additional $43,500,000 was made internationally.[41] At the MTV Movie Awards, McConaughey won Best Breakthrough Performance.[42] Larger Than Life is a road comedy film starring Bill Murray and directed by Howard Franklin; McConaughey played a supporting role.[43] Also that year he acted in Glory Daze.[44] McConaughey starred in the science fiction film Contact (1997), directed by Robert Zemeckis, an adaptation of Carl Sagan's 1985 novel of the same name; Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan wrote the story outline for the film.

But believe me, I noticed there were other things that were not coming in. And if they were coming in, it was in an independent form with a much smaller paycheck, and nobody really wanting to get behind them ... But I knew I could say no to the things I'd been doing. In saying no to those things, I knew work was going to dry up for awhile ... Year and a half, still nothing. At two years, all of a sudden, in my opinion, I became a new good idea for some good directors.[62]\n\n2011–2014: Established actor\n\nIn 2012, McConaughey starred alongside Channing Tatum in Magic Mike, based on Tatum's early life; it was directed by Steven Soderbergh.[64] Also in 2012 came Mud, which gained him praise for his role as a fugitive.[65]\n\nHe returned to his East Texas roots, working again with director Richard Linklater on Bernie, playing district attorney Danny Buck Davidson.[66] In June 2012, McConaughey was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[67]\n\nIn 2013 he portrayed Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club.
