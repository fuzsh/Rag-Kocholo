        "text": "James Lloyd Daniels, age 77, of Walton, KY, passed away on Thursday, April 25th, 2024. Jim was a U.S. Army Reservist and National Guard veteran serving the states of Kentucky, Indiana, and Mississippi. He was an air traffic controller and retired - after more than 40 years of employment - as a Maintainability Engineering Specialist for General Electric Aircraft Engines. Not only did he engineer and work on planes, Jim also had his private pilot’s license. Jim invented and patented a tool used on jet engines, as well. After retiring from the aerospace industry as an engineer, Jim worked as a substitute teacher for Grant County, Kenton County, and Walton-Verona schools. He enjoyed helping and working with kids by serving as a Boy Scout leader for over 50 years. Jim started Troop 833 in Walton, KY and led the Ida Spence Troop (for at-risk boys) in Covington, KY. He was also a Kentucky Colonel. Jim enjoyed 60’s music and listening to the blues. He and his wife, Donna Kay, served on the Cincinnati Blues Society membership committee. Jim was also an avid fisherman, talented musician, and enjoyed discussing all things aviation and automotive. Jim was preceded in death by his parents, Lewis and Jean Daniels; son, SGT. William Bradley Daniels; and sister, Janice Schneider. He was beloved and respected by his family, including his wife - for over 60 years - Donna Kay Benke Daniels; his children, Scott Daniels (Erika) and Katie Morgan (Jim); brother, Mike Daniels (Donna Jean); brother-in-law, Bill Schneider; grandchildren, Alexandra Daniels, Taylor Mabbett, Jillian Daniels, Josh Daniels, Charlette Cripe, Kai Daniels, Landon Daniels, Cian Daniels, Hank Coy, and Will Morgan; and great-grandchildren, Chayton and Brynn Daniels, Grayson, Lilly, and Theo Cripe, Meadow and Arthur Mabbett, and Saylor Coy. Visitation for Jim will be Saturday, May 4th, 2024, from 10 a.m. to 12 pm, with the funeral service beginning at noon at the Church of the Redeemed, 68 South Main St., Walton, KY 41094. Interment, with military honors, will be at Gardnersville Cemetery, immediately following the services.
