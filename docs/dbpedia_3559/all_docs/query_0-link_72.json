        "text": "1960\n\nThe Rev. David O. McCoy, Athens, Ohio, reports, \"I’m doing my best to keep active. My number one way is to go to the gym five days a week. In addition, my wife, Chris, and I are getting out and about: I saw three shows in Wooster in July; spent a couple of weeks at my cottage on a lake in Canada; traveled to the Orkney Islands in Scotland; doing some Sunday supply work at our local Episcopal Church; even got to Cincinnati for a Reds game!\"\n\n1961\n\nDaniel O. Holland reports, \"Our move to the South has proven to be the best move ever. Since moving to Virginia, I’ve been called ‘sweetie, sweetheart, honey and love,’ something that never happened when I lived in the North! Patty is a member of two local symphony orchestras, one of which, Waynesboro Community Orchestra, recently was named the best community orchestra in the country. Active in three poetry/literary/musical groups, I get to read my poetry and song lyrics at three grand venues every month. I contribute a poem on Facebook every day. Standing offer to all Kenyon men and women to come visit. Word of caution: you may never want to leave!\"\n\n1962\n\nPaul C. Heintz, Radnor, Pennsylvania, reports, \"Still practicing law after 58 years with the firm I joined after Penn Law School. Flying air-planes since my solo 65 years ago. My wife, Jane (aka Saint Jane), still tolerates me after 60 years. We spend more time than ever with our four children and seven grandchildren, four of whom are in college. Being able to join my classmates every five years on The Hill since graduation has been a blessing.\"\n\n1962\n\nHarvey F. Lodish, Brookline, Massachusetts, updates, “Though I closed my research laboratory in 2019, I remain on the active MIT faculty and continue to teach.” Harvey wrote from a sabbatical leave in Africa, where he was teaching biotechnology in Uganda, Ghana and Malawi “with the aim of encouraging students and young faculty members to start biotech companies that can deal with these countries’ many unmet medical and agricultural needs, and making contacts for them in the Boston biomedical ecosystem that can help with specific technologies. This January I will spend two weeks in Gambier, teaching a half-course on biotechnology. Students will read and discuss key research papers that underlie recent successful gene and cell therapies — the same papers I use in my MIT biotech seminar. Eleven years ago at Kenyon, I taught a similar seminar course on stem cells; the students were as good as the seniors in my class at MIT, and their term papers were on average better written.”\n\n1962\n\nRichard A. Rubin, Mill Valley, California, remembers, “As editor of the Collegian my junior year, I crusaded to have the college eliminate the dreaded compulsory chapel requirement. Not only had it deprived generations of homework- or party-weary students hours of precious sleep on Sundays, it forced them to worship at places perhaps not of their own choosing, at odds with the fundamental values of a liberal arts education. Happily, the board of trustees agreed to its rescision. To my surprise, I received a very gracious and approving letter from the Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of Ohio — who happened to be the chair of the Board of Trustees at the time!” Richard also recalled visiting Paul L. Newman ’49 in 2005 at his home, along with former president Georgia Nugent and fellow trustee David Horvitz. Richard’s friend Maurice Kanbar H’06, a San Francisco inventor/philanthropist, recently deceased, had just made a $1.25 million gift to the College — contingent upon Newman’s willingness to meet. “The meeting was a great success,” Richard recalls, “with Newman refusing assistance, preparing and serving lunch — Newman’s Own, of course. I will never forget his self-effacing response when I asked if we could have our photo taken: ‘Sure, but you realize a hundred of these is worth one Robert Redford.’”\n\n1962\n\nRobert D. Vance, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, is “long retired from the UNC philosophy department but continues to teach some courses in Duke’s Lifelong Learning Institute. My hobbies now include photography (with periodic exhibitions), and my workouts include water volleyball.” Bob and Terry were headed to Bogota, Colombia in December to visit two sons and their grandchildren.\n\n1963\n\nAlan W. Beck, New Albany, Ohio, submits, \"I have been reflecting on life in Gambier in the ’50s, with two grocery stores, a Sohio station and a barbershop on the main block and (until 1954) no dorms west of the gates at Philander’s Well, where 308 ended at 229. In 1954, my mother, a faculty member, was told she should not march with the men in the convocation and graduation processions, and she was refused admittance to the Phi Beta Kappa meetings because she was a woman. Ivy League Phi Beta Kappa meant nothing if the person was a woman. Kenyon has come a long way in 70 years, from the Pajama Parade (“hazing”?), which stopped in the early 1960s while I was a student, to now having our second woman president!\"\n\n1963\n\nCalvin S. Frost, Lake Forest, Illinois, says his 60th reunion was “a wonderful experience. Since May, I have continued to work, garden and play. Just back from Brussels and Amsterdam and headed to India for 10 days shortly. Our small business now has 160 employees, including our daughter Cynthia Frost ’84, son-in-law Richard C. Hoffman ’89, and grandson Alexander B. Hoffman ’20.”\n\n1963\n\n“In late August, our children made us an amazing 60th-anniversary party. All 12 grandchildren took part, alongside old and new friends. President Biden and Jill Biden sent us an engraved congratulation card.” After a fall cruise and then a family Thanksgiving in Atlanta, Neal was headed to Belize in late January. “Grandson Kio’s high school graduation in mid-May, the Kenyon Bicentennial Celebration in Gambier, and our grandson Max’s graduation in June and our grandson Max’s graduation in June at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. It is good to have so much to look forward to.”\n\n— Neal M. Mayer, Millsboro, Delaware\n\n1963\n\nRobert H. Scott, Joplin, Missouri, shared fond memories: “L. Mifflin ‘Miff’ Hayes and I both went to Duke Law. I went on active duty as an Air Force JAG officer, serving my last year in Thailand on the Mekong River during the Vietnam War. Returning to the U.S. to practice law, spent 11 years in Cincinnati before returning to my family home in Joplin as a partner in Roberts, Fleishaker, and Scott after a friend was appointed federal judge. Raising our young family outside the world of corporate practice is a decision I am glad we made, as we had time to enjoy our children growing up far more.” Robert has published 30 books, including eight novels, with the ninth out now (visit amazon.com/stores /author/B00G1OJNTS). “Sadly, I lost my wife of 43 years, Sandy, to cancer in 2009. But the children and grandchildren keep me busy.… While I will not likely make any reunions or the 200th celebrations, I wish all the very best.”\n\n1964\n\nJohn B. Hattendorf, Newport, Rhode Island, traveled to London for a three-day meeting of the Anglo-Swedish naval history society “Wrestling with three books in process,” he writes. ‘Reflections on Naval History: Collected Essays,’ the third volume of my collected essays, from 2011 to 2021. The second, written with Geoffrey Till, ‘Recovering Naval Power: Henry Maydman and the Recovery of the Royal Navy,’ is an edition of a completely overlooked book from 1691 with great relevance to the naval situation today. Finally, for Oxford University Press’s Great Battle Series, a book on the memory, commemoration and various historical interpretations of the 1805 naval Battle of Trafalgar.”\n\n1964\n\n“Living on an island, we think, is wonderful, and Nantucket is a fab-ulously beautiful place, but small. Leaving the island, particularly during the off-season, is a long-term island tradition. So we took to the road with trips to Tunisia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and then Paris and London. All were interesting — I will say the food is better in Paris. We’re back on the island and devot-ing the fall to raising a new puppy.”\n\n— Martin McKerrow, Nantucket, Massachusetts\n\n1964\n\n“I came to Kenyon in fall 1960. A clarinet enthusiast, I asked Professor Paul Schwartz about opportunities to play A. Rubin ’62, myself, and another whom I can’t recall on standard B-flat clarinets, and Alexander McNamara on bass clarinet. We rehearsed in the Harcourt Parish Episcopal Church and performed several recitals there, plus at least one in the Knox County Memorial Theater, to meager yet appreciative audiences. Fast forward to 2007: I received my master’s in clarinet performance from Arizona State University at age 65. Now aged 81, I’m back playing principal clarinet in the Scottsdale, Arizona, Philharmonic Orchestra. Gratefully, our concerts are so well-attended that people are sometimes turned away at the door. ”\n\n— Walter W. Nielsen\n\n1964\n\n“At a recent college sports-themed dinner, I finally got a chance to wear my Kenyon letter sweater. I’m happy to say that after nearly 60 years it not only was in good condition, but it still fit. I spend most of my time now playing golf. I’ve managed to shoot my age well over 200 times.”\n\n— Eric A. Summerville, Saint James, North Carolina\n\n1966\n\nCharles S. Evans resides at Highland Green, a 55+ senior community in Topsham, Maine, “just across the river from Brunswick and Bowdoin College,” he reports. “I am now the senior staff physical therapist at the Veterinary and Rehabilitation Center of Cape Elizabeth. I have been doing PT on dogs now for 22 years at a variety of 24/7 hospitals.” Charles plays in a rock-and-roll band called Off Their Rockers, sings in a church choir and is a board member of the Brunswick Senior Center.\n\n1966\n\n“Our son Zachary graduated from Landmark College in December, with a bachelor’s in computer science. My wife, Lisa Rubin, is in leadership on the board of Master Voices, a volunteer singing ensemble, well-known here in the arts scene. After many years of giving short views on the Bible portion of the week, I’m setting out to teach others how. We are making Shabbat services more participatory, as well as delving into the multiple meanings of Torah portions.\n\n”\n\n— Carl S. Mankowitz, New York City\n\n1966\n\n“Gretchen and I are catching up on travel. In June we did a 23-day Med cruise that started in Barcelona, visited ports all the way to Jerusalem, and finished in Trieste. In September, we spent three weeks hiking in Scotland, first on the Fife Coastal Path near Edinburgh, and later on the Great Glen Way near Inverness. In December, we headed to Norway for a 15-day northern lights cruise that started in Bergen and ended in Oslo.”\n\n— Richard T. Nolan, Red Lodge, Montana\n\n1967\n\nPhil Cerny, updates, “Fairly quiet here in York, U.K., but keeping busy. Still singing at the Black Swan Folk Club and playing in the house band, Ramshackle. Although I’m officially retired from academia — the University of Manchester in 2004 and Rutgers University-Newark in 2010 — I still publish and go to international conferences, most recently Athens, Toronto, Potsdam, and Prague this summer.” Last February, Phil published “Heterarchy in World Politics” (Routledge).\n\n1967\n\nEdward J. Forrest Jr., Marietta, Georgia, recalls, “(Then-admissions director) Tracy Scudder set the tone — amazing tweed sport coat, button-down collar and sage advice: ‘Gentlemen! Welcome to Kenyon. You will be treated as an adult until you prove yourself otherwise.’” Edward asserts that “some Tales of Kenyon range from ‘whales’ to ‘problematic.’” And: “Please remind Dr. Schnall the Kenyon Riots were far deeper than plugging Philander’s Well, which was traumatic and never allowed in those times. However, the installation of stop signs and their bold enforcement? That frosted the pumpkin!”\n\n1967\n\nLawrence C. Schmidlapp was re-elected for a seventh term as mayor of Centre Island, New York, a Nassau County village on a 605-acre peninsula in Oyster Bay Harbor. “Also elected commander of my American Legion post,” he adds.\n\n1968\n\nMichael A. Liff shares, “In Portland, Maine, for the last eight years. Probably our last stop until assisted living!” Michael works part-time for the Maine Celtics, a G-league pro basketball team. “I get a paycheck from the Boston Celtics! For a lifelong basketball fan, how cool is that! The Kenyon Owls? From the Lords to the Birds! Didn’t Temple University get there first? My last day at Kenyon was our 1968 graduation. I really don’t miss the place — it’s always been about the people. There is no way to put into words how much I think about and miss fraternity brothers and friends.\"\n\n1968\n\nPierce E. Scranton Jr., Ketchum, Idaho, reflects, “The classic wide-eyed, bushy-tailed new freshman was me in 1964. Admitted as an experiment — no one had ever applied from my high school. … I logged in Alaska for three summers, working my way through Kenyon. I drank deep from the cup.” Pierce became an orthopedic surgeon, sent a son to Kenyon, became a member of the Board of Trustees, and won awards and honorary degrees. “I founded a mission in Vietnam taking care of land-mine victims and disabled children. Maybe all because Professor Bob Burns called me back after I’d turned in an honors thesis and said, ‘Pierce, I won’t accept this. You can do better.’”\n\n1968\n\nJohn D. Sinks, Arlington, Virginia, continues his genealogy hobby now that health conditions and the risk of COVID have ended his ballroom dancing. Newly accepted in the Huguenot Society of the Founders of Manakin in the Colony of Virginia, he continues to be a member in the Jamestowne Society, Sons of the American Revolution, First Families of Kentucky and the Society of the Cincinnati of the State of South Carolina.\n\n1968\n\nMark E. Sullivan practices law in Raleigh, North Carolina. “Busy with travel, including business trips to Kansas City; Fargo, North Dakota; and Hawaii — mainly concerning military divorce training and teaching. Looking forward to our Reunion and hope to be part of a ‘fraternity sing’ on the steps of Rosse Hall.”\n\n1970\n\n“I have three vivid memories of Kenyon: The night of the first draft lottery. Not great for some of us! Professor Bruce Gensemer suggested that I become an econ major; I’m an economist today, so thanks, Bruce! Endless rounds of APBA baseball games with friends when it was raining — 75 percent of the time? My only question: Where was the sushi bar in 1970?\n\n”\n\n— Frank J. Berardino Jr., Delray Beach, Florida\n\n1970\n\nRobert C. Boruchowitz works part-time at the School of Law, where his upcoming courses include law and the Holocaust and abuses of executive power. “I am an expert witness in several cases involving public defense and serve on state and national committees working to improve public defense,” he adds. “I sometimes wonder how we got to be in our mid-70s. Did we ever think about that in 1970?”\n\n1970\n\nPeter M. Cowen, Wilmington, North Carolina, notes, “Retirement continues to be full. I FaceTime with the Rev. Karl D. Ruttan, Andrew D. Stewart, and William S. Koller Jr. on a somewhat regular basis (all Delt brothers).” His recent travels have taken him to Bermuda, Norway, and Maine. “Met two Kenyon alumni on a canal boat tour in Amsterdam (great fun; she was a swimmer); ran into Donald L. Shupe ’81 randomly at a restaurant in Wilmington (we both have Kenyon license plates and the swimming connection); and finally had a most enjoyable breakfast reminiscing session with Delt Big Brother Timothy R. Holder ’68 (another swimmer), who also lives in Wilmington! Go Lords!”\n\n1970\n\nThe Rev. John K. Morrell, River John, Nova Scotia, reflects, \"The Kenyon experience was much more than classes, books, reports, and labs. We were also involved in sports and humanities, and, in my case, I became engrossed in theater. My freshman year I watched a Gilbert and Sullivan production and was enthused. For my sophomore and senior years, I appeared and sang in two productions. During my junior year abroad I sang in the Beirut College for Women's production of “Patience,” and at McGill University in Montreal, I appeared in three productions. With my retirement from full-time ministry at St. Mark’s Anglican Church in 2018, I became involved with the North Shore Players. Now preparing a world premiere of Gary L. Blackwood’s musical 'We’re All Bound to Go' and MCing our annual Christmas variety shows.\"\n\n1970\n\n“Three Kenyon events will always be significant for me: my commissioning as an Air Force second lieutenant in 1970; my presentation to the College of a memorial marker on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Air Force ROTC at Kenyon; and commemoration in 2022 of the 50th anniversary of the closure of Kenyon ROTC.”\n\n— William F. Paraska, Alpharetta, Georgia\n\n1971\n\n“Another summer of working with Oak Park (Illinois) Festival Theatre, the Midwest’s oldest professional, outdoor, classical theatre. Now helping with the 2024 season. A play of mine, ‘Envoy,’ with earlier productions in Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York, was presented at SUNY Binghamton in early October. The rest of my time is busy with theatre work, teaching, writing, and volunteering.”\n\n— Belinda Bremner\n\n1971\n\n“I retired after a long career as a federal prosecutor and then a white-collar defense lawyer. My wife of 46 years and I have three adult children and currently live in a multi-generational house in Baltimore with our daughter 4-month-old grandson and our youngest son. We frequently see Jeff Franklin ’70 and his family; David Cronin ’72; Jeff Oppenheim; and Ransom Griffin.\n\n”\n\n— Christopher A. Myers, Baltimore\n\n1971\n\nNorman E. Schmidt, Cleveland, reports, \"At the swimming and diving reunion, I enjoyed meeting up with Douglas M. Neff and teammates William S. Koller Jr. ’70, James F. Loomis ’73, James Lucas ’73, John A. Davis ’73, David H. Cannon ’73, William R. Wallace ’72, John E. Davis ’75, Lawrence H. Witner ’69, John A. 'Jack' Kirkpatrick III ’73, and others a little younger (like frat bro Stuart S. Wegener ’75) and older (James G. Carr ’62), and even one I coached (Carol S. Leslie ’84). The event was terrific. I continue to play golf with John H. Emack ’72 about once a week; he still wins handily, but we have fun and even get some exercise. John and I recently got together with Arthur B. “Chip” Sansom ’73 to celebrate the life of Gregg J. DeSilvio ’74, who died recently. Chip is my DEKE little brother, and Gregg was Chip’s little brother. I also had the pleasure of meeting up with David Gregg when he was in Cleveland recently. I seem to be completely retired. Case Western Reserve University did not employ me this year to work with seniors planning to become science teachers.\"\n\n1972\n\nSamuel Barone, Mount Vernon, Ohio, has been invited to join the board of the Philander Chase Conservancy. “I’m looking forward to expanding my understanding of land trusts in general, and those protecting the Greater Gambier environs in particular. And, of course, putting 50-plus years of Knox County knowledge to work in service of Kenyon,” he writes.\n\n1972\n\n“I continue to practice law and was recently named Best of the Bar White Collar Criminal Defense by the Philadelphia Business Journal.”\n\n— Barry Gross, Media, Pennsylvania\n\n1973\n\n“Great to see classmates at our 50th this spring! I even stayed on campus, which brought back a lot of great memories. Up here in Michigan, I’m a substitute teacher three days a week and still volunteering at the Sloan Museum in Flint on Thursdays. I have even subbed in kindergarten and first grade.”\n\n— Jeffrey L. Bennett\n\n1973\n\n“Retired two years ago — 44 years practicing law was enough! Doug (also a lawyer) and I have two children — Hallie, a school administrator, and Jack C. Godshall ’06, who works at Blackrock. We have three grandchildren and hope to have more! We like to travel, most memorably to Vietnam and most recently to Hawaii.”\n\n— Cathy A. Carter Godshall, Akron, Ohio\n\n1973\n\nShelley A. Hainer, New York City, conducts sensory awareness sessions online and in person — in Berkeley, California, last spring; New York City last fall; and next fall in Spain. See Shelley’s “Leaders in the Spotlight” inter-view with the Sensory Awareness Foundation on YouTube or visit shelleyhainer.com. Shelley enjoyed meet-ing Leonie J. Deutsch, JoAnn and Christopher A. Bloom, Jeffrey A. Wolin ’72 and John M. Himmel in Chicago; Jack Y. Au and Marcia Barr Abbot in NYC; and Colleen Kelly-Eiding. “Shimmers remain in the wake of our 50th reunion afterglow. I loved being in Gambier, in the community of like-minded humans. Rekindled, refreshed and newly engaged connections with Thomas E. Allen, Katie Fishman Eastridge, Bonnie Levinson, Katherine Cushman, David W. Cronin and Kerry H. Pechter among them, and a beautiful in-person visit with my freshman advisor, Professor Emeritus Robert Bennett. As a practicing meditator of four decades, the middle way resonates powerfully with Middle Path, my time at Kenyon and beyond.”\n\n1973\n\nMitchell L. Jablons, Watchung, New Jersey, reflects, \"I didn’t realize semi-retirement is a full-time job. Between exercising, travel, friendships, family responsibilities and a once- or twice-a-week job as an anesthesiologist, my days are full. My Kenyon liberal arts education has been a great launching pad to enjoy intellectual challenges as I age. Just glad I received it at a time when the cost was a fraction of what it is currently.\"\n\n1973\n\n“Kenyon is a great teacher both inside and outside the classroom. I was reminded of that again while joining 500-plus members of the Kenyon swimming nation for\n\na reunion last year honoring Hall of Fame inductees and the incomparable Coach Jim Steen. We connected with this generation of swimmers and teammates and others from the Coach Dick Sloan era. Coach Sloan and the culture of Kenyon swimming he created made a very real difference in my life and career. I learned the real power of a shared vision and goals, the understanding that individuals can be more than they believed, that a team could be more than it thought, the value of consistent hard and focused work, the imperative of not making excuses, the importance of leadership, and that ‘luck is when preparation meets opportunity.’ Very thankful. Plus, it was a blast swimming in reunion relays with teammates Charles D. Welker, James Lucas, John A. Davis and James F. Loomis 50 years after graduation. I left with one big regret: I had lost touch with Coach and never told him how much he meant to my life at Kenyon and afterward. Fortunately, teammate Norman E. Schmidt ’71 had his email. I wrote Coach a longish thank-you note and included the fact that Sara and I now spend most of our time on Bald Head Island off the coast of North Carolina. He immediately wrote back. It turns out he and his wife, Diane, have been living about a mile from the marina where we catch the ferry to the island. We have been driving past his house for years. The next day we got together. He is 87 and still serves on the town’s planning board. Diane is an accomplished artist. The world worked in a wonderful way.”\n\n— John A. Kirkpatrick III, Bald Head Island, North Carolina\n\n1973\n\n“Congrats to the women’s lacrosse team on a successful season! You make us pioneers so proud! Recently I moved to Idaho and have been settling into a new home and community. Been out birding with Golden Eagle Audubon and continuing my country line dance classes. By the time you read this, I will have been to Antarctica via the Falklands and South Georgia, then Patagonia and Valparaiso. I’ll be doing a bit of citizen science for NASA on this trip and hopefully visiting the Argentinian research station on Antarctica, weather permitting. Here’s to everyone enjoying our second seventies!”\n\n— Shirley J. Leow\n\n1973\n\nBonnie Levinson, Delray Beach, Florida, had a “fabulous” 50th reunion, “plus those of us in New York this summer got to join Marcia Barr Abbot and Jack Y. Au at Jack’s favorite Chinese eatery. My summer was filled with travel, art and family. My solo exhibition “Metanoia” at Roxbury Abbey in the Catskills was thrilling, with 49 pieces presented in conversation with the stained glass and soaring architecture. Then a family wedding in Tuscany and an adventure driving tour throughout the winding mountain roads of Sardinia. The colors and textures of sea and sky are already influencing my work in the studio.”\n\n1973\n\n“We have a brand-new emergency department at the University of Cincinnati, but business is the usual. I recently spent some time with Steven C. Carleton ’78 and Kevin A. Conry ’71. Being smarter than me, they are both retired and enjoying life. I would retire, but I don’t know how to do anything else.”\n\n— Edward “Mel” J. Otten\n\n1973\n\nMark Sandson offers his first-ever class note. “So I have a lot of territory to cover! After a mediocre career at Kenyon I went on to law school at Emory. Thereafter I practiced law in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for 30 years before being appointed to the Superior Court and serving there for about 15 years. I served on the family, general equity, and criminal divisions. My last and favorite assignment was in recovery court, where I finally found my calling. When I turned 70, I was determined to be constitutionally infirm. as the NJ Constitution requires all superior court judges to retire on their 70th birthday. After I had stressed the importance of employment at a living wage with benefits, I was asked to stay on and help run a Supreme Court committee to help get New Jersey’s 130,000 probation clients good jobs. This is what I am doing every day now, and loving it.”\n\n1973\n\nAnn Starr, Columbus, Ohio, reflects, “When I entered in the first class of women in 1969, I had been at Kenyon in some sense since 1964, when Gambier’s school system merged with Mount Vernon’s. In junior high, my closest friends were the children of Professor Michael, Professor Schwartz, and Dean Edwards. I slept over and dined at faculty homes, played the jukebox at Dorothy’s and bought candy from Mr. Hayes. As a student, I house-sat over the summers for professors Baly, Seymour and Crutwell. I knew where the wild blackberries grew in the summer. I picked gallons of them and baked pies that I shared with the Warners and Greenslades. By the time I was 20, I was an old-timer. I’ve been back rarely, but I recently spent the day with Jacqueline E. Robbins and Thomas P. Stamp, loyal alumni who have lived in Gambier and served the college after earning their graduate degrees. I think there were 800 or fewer students when we were there, and even fewer when I was a girl. Nostalgia, nostalgia! … ‘My’ Kenyon is fully alive inside my memory; Kenyon College keeps growing and changing, keeping up with its generations of students.”\n\n1974\n\nM. Christine “Mary” Anderson, Cincinnati, informs, “Carol A. Heiberger and I had a wonderful time in London and Athens last April. Thank you to Julia Miller-Vick ’73 and James W. Vick for taking the time to share their expertise on Athens. I go to Atlanta as often as possible to see my grandson. I also chair the board of King Studios, a nonprofit preserving the history of iconic independent recording company King Records.”\n\n1974\n\nThomas A. Andrew, Washington, Massachusetts, updates, “After 35 years teaching and coaching at the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island — and a 44-year career overall — I retired in 2022. My wife, Katy, and I sold our home and now enjoy our mountainside woodland home in the Berkshires as our primary residence. We hit the road periodically, especially to see our granddaughters play soccer (of course!) — one as a first-year at James Madison University and the other as a sophomore at Barrington High School.”\n\n1974\n\nLean’tin Bracks, Old Hickory, Tennessee, observes, “Our May 2024 Reunion will be 50 years since graduating and 200 for the College as a whole. Wow, time flies! The first time I experienced a true fall season was on Middle Path. A Texan who grew up on the coast surrounded by palm trees, I saw the leaves changing colors as a glorious gift from nature, indeed a spiritual experience. (Oh, then there was the first time I saw snow!) I have retired from Fisk University in Nashville as a full professor of African American literature and spend my time keeping my granddaughters and writing. The second edition of my resource book was released in October. All is well, and I send greetings to my alma mater and the Black Student Union, long may they endure.”\n\n1974\n\nJames E. Breece III, Litchfield, Connecticut, remains active in the Chinese, Japanese and Southeast Asian art worlds. “I was recently involved in a new show at Harvard Art Museums called “Objects of Addiction: Opium, Empire, and the Chinese Art Trade.” My involvement was not only the loan of a key object (Hong bowl) but also as the driving force behind a free 23-page booklet — rather than a cocktail-table book for the show. We printed 10,000 booklets so they would reach more people than a typical show hardback catalog. Peter Hoover ’71 claims I am addicted to the objects. My son Jeb, James E. Breece IV ’04, would not disagree.”\n\n1974\n\nKevin Fitzgerald, Nahant, Massachusetts, informs, “In 2011, I was in a fire when a gasoline tanker tipped over on the highway. They say to add your age (60) to your percentage of third-degree burns (55) and that is your mortality rate. I am 115 percent dead, statistically. I am a third of the way through a chemotherapy program for B-cell lymphoma. If I am already statistically dead, I figure the cancer has nothing to work on. I want to be clear: I am not a glass-half-full person. I believe I was given a full pour, and it is up to me to make the most of it. (I don’t drink anymore, so that glass is iced tea.) God bless you for your friendship; if you are having troubles, mine are neither better nor worse than yours. We all survive based on the strength we are given by those around us. Treasure your loved ones as they treasure you.” Kevin is counsel to the Massachusetts House of Representatives Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security, where “the title is much bigger than the paycheck, but the work is fascinating.”\n\n1974\n\nDan E. Patterson, Dallas, writes, “Some of my fondest memories of Kenyon are the amazing fall weather. I have been serving on the board of The Gund art gallery for the past few years, and we had a board meeting on cam-pus when leaves were at their peak. My second grandchild (a boy) lives near me in Dallas. Endless blessings. I have been in frequent touch with Richard I. James, who retired from the ministry and is trying to move closer to his grandchildren in Idaho.”\n\n1974\n\nStewart F. Peck and Renee Peck ’75 welcomed a fifth grandchild, their second granddaughter, in June. “I am still practicing law in New Orleans and hope to cut back next year to travel more, take classes in Spanish, art history and drawing, and play more golf and pickleball. Had a great reunion with my soccer teammates last spring on the team’s 75th anniversary. In recent times I have been trying in multiple ways to pay forward the financial help and great education I received at Kenyon.”\n\n1974\n\nMartha S. Schulman had an eventful 2023: “My third grandchild, Fiona, was born in February. I am so very fortunate that both of my sons and their families live near me in Richmond, Virginia. In mid-September, I received a kidney transplant, which came sooner than I expected. I received excellent care at VCU Health, and that wonderful care continues at home through my partner of 20 years. There is so much to be grateful for!”\n\n1974\n\nSidney E. Wanetick writes, “As our 50th approaches, I frequently reflect on the twists and turns of life. My father, who never went to college, told me college would be the best years of my life and to enjoy it. For two years I took him very literally and enjoyed myself way too much. The light bulb went off when Dr. Jegla, my physiology professor, suggested I consider dropping pre-med and finding another vocation. At a Reunion weekend years later, I was having a beer with Dean Edwards — whom I got to know well, as many of you may remember. I mentioned how five of us PEEPS had fared. Four physicians: Joseph J. Baem — who, I am sad to report, passed away in July — Paul Shapiro, Stuart B. Weiner and me. And one dentist: Thomas F. Northway. Dean Edwards replied, ‘I wouldn’t have put money on it.’ But we all made it, because the unique experience that is Kenyon impacts our lives profoundly and stays with us forever.” Sidney spends winters in Mexico and summers in Carlsbad, California, “where we bought an old — not to be confused with charming — townhouse, gutted and remodeled it, and are determined never to move again!”\n\n1975\n\nJoan Baldwin, Falls Village, Connecticut, reports, “I had the bittersweet pleasure of being present for J. Bradley Faus’ last day of teaching. It’s a Hotchkiss School tradition for the community to applaud a faculty member as they leave class on the last day of school. I met Brad in an art class September of our first year. A decade or so later we found ourselves at Hotchkiss. I remain the school’s curator of special collections.”\n\n1975\n\nAnne G. Campos, Hancock, New York, is writing a book tentatively titled “Speaking from the Margins” that “loosely applies Josef Alber’s color theory — (color) is almost never seen as it really is — to life as work in progress,” she explains. “Nothing is obvious until it is. The book will create a retrospective sketch that incorporates movement through boundaries, two centuries and constant encounters with the laws of motion — specifically, for every action, there is an opposed and equal reaction.”\n\n1975\n\nConstance Chapman Dillon updates, “After 14 years in Naples we moved to the Chattanooga area in 2018, first building a home west of town up on the Cumberland Plateau, then moving into the city in 2022. We’re right downtown, so we can walk to restaurants, museums and enjoy all the activities the city offers. It was great to have a visit recently from Elizabeth K. Parker and her husband, Mark.”\n\n1975\n\nSteven C. Durning, Holliston, Massachusetts, reports, “On Sept. 23, a group of us gathered at a daylong event graciously hosted by Thomas A. Lucas and his wife, Shari, at their home 40 miles north of New York City. Most came from far away. Our guiding spirit was Kevin J. Martin, who suggested that we give ‘Tom Talks,’ which some of us did. We caught up with each other, ate and drank, remembered, processed once again what Mark C. Fox ’76 meant to us, sang along to Peter H. Frank’s guitar, and contem-plated our approaching 50th Reunion. Many thanks to all for making the effort, including Alice Cornwell Straus, Brad Foote, Murray J. Smith and Janet Byrne Smith ’76, Karen Mesberg and Scott M. Univer ’73, Matthew S. Mees, Michael C. Davis, Arthur M. Marx and Pamela A. Martin-Diaz.”\n\n1975\n\nAfter 46 years of teaching at the secondary school level, J. Bradley Faus retired to Charleston, South Carolina. “We remoeled our home and moved in this fall. We plan to summer on the Maine coast and winter in Charleston while spending time visiting our children in Denver. I am building a studio and will be focusing on making art in addition to pursuing various environmental, social and political interests. Stay in touch (jbfaus4@ gmail.com).”\n\n1975\n\nBrooks Jackson, Iowa City, Iowa, stepped down as the dean of medicine for the University of Iowa Health Care System, and before that dean of medicine at the University of Minnesota, and before that chair of pathology at Johns Hopkins. “I will continue my research full time and see patients in my specialty of transfusion medicine,” he explained. “I still have a number of projects in Uganda, China, Brazil and, more recently, Zambia, so I will be busy traveling and on a lot of video calls. But I should have more time for running, creative writing, music composition and seeing our three sons and my wife of 37 years.”\n\n1975\n\nEmily Crom Lyons, Darien, Connecticut, announces, “Renee (Brandt) Peck and I are celebrating our seventh decade with a trip by jet around the world. Bucket-list trip for us both, with world highlights around the globe. Bon voyage!”\n\n1975\n\nCharlotte “Shami” J. McCormick updates, “My husband and I are currently living in Geneseo, New York, enjoying the fine art of grandparenting Rhys McCormick, age 3. Our winters are spent in the milder climate of Richmond, Virginia. Turning 70 has given me a different perspective on being old — as in, ‘Surely, I’m not … am I?’ Gail Jacobs Gordon and I got together with other chums in Chautauqua, New York, to celebrate seven decades and be inspired by Bonnie Raitt, who gave a fierce concert! Recently I had the pleasure of working with David I. Jaffe ’78 and Adam T. Petherbridge ’08 in NYC on an evening of Chekhov. I keep my oar dipped in theater but am doing a lot of writing and editing. Working for BGG Creative Studio on a children’s adventure series and brushing up on my playwriting.”\n\n1975\n\nRichard H. Miller and his wife, Cherie, celebrated their 25th and moved from their COVID haven in Big Sky, Montana, to New York City, where Cherie leads Apple’s New York office and Rick “unofficially” transferred to Bryan Cave’s NYC office. “After 18 months we have settled in,” he reports, “mastered the subway and figured out NYC’s underground economy — which is how life really happens and things really get done. We also learned the two no-no’s of living in New York: no cars and no kids! We live in Nomad — a short walk to the theater district and countless interest-ing restaurants. Would love to see anyone who may be passing through.”\n\n1975\n\nPamela Cole Schneider informs, “My husband, Tim, and I continue to enjoy our home in central Florida (north of Orlando, south of Ocala and not The Villages). We are renovating a property we plan to flip, Tim is restoring a 1970s vintage Ford pickup truck, and I continue to work on dressage training with my Lusitano gelding. We had a fun and informative visit to London, Normandy, Paris, Krakow and Berlin on a WWII history tour sponsored by the Ohio State University history department. My daughter was married in mid-September, and we enjoyed a large festive celebration in the Finger Lakes region. After the wedding, Tim and I toured Lake Placid, New York; Stowe, Vermont; and the White Mountains in New Hampshire.”\n\n1975\n\nPaul Silver, Silver Spring, Maryland, updates, “As I read note after note of classmates retiring, I have started a new job at the tender age of 70. After almost 19 years at George Washington and almost my entire career as both a psychiatrist and internist at academic medical centers, I have joined a private practice at Sibley Hospital in D.C. Nonetheless, I will continue to teach at GW and, perhaps, Hopkins, with which Sibley is affiliated. After living with us for nine years, my father passed away this spring just after his 100th birthday. For a year and a half we had a four-generation household while one of my daughters, her husband and three children also lived with us. Seeing my 2-year-old grandson talking with his great-grandfather was particularly cute. My daughter and family moved to Olney, about 10 miles away, so it is now just Shelly and me. A bit too quiet at times. Son Ari and his six live outside Philadelphia, and Sarah and her six are in Baltimore, so all are in easy driving distance.”\n\n1975\n\nMurray J. Smith, Gambier, thanks Thomas A. Lucas, Shari Krikorian and their son Nate “for hosting (and tolerating)” the above-mentioned mini-reunion. “Shout-out to Kevin J. Martin for being the lead organizer, and to Matt Mees’ wife, Elizabeth, for listening quite patiently to the old war stories.”\n\n1975\n\nAaron B. Webber updates, “Have had the happiest year with my new husband, Jack MacLeod. After 10 years in England, we are moving to Portugal, where his mother’s family is from. Time to put toes in sand.”\n\n1976\n\nJames M. Borgman reports, “A 2020 safari in Botswana was to have been our way of celebrating Christopher J. Myers’ retirement from his career as head of IT at the Providence Performing Arts Center. Sadly, Chris passed away before we could realize that vision. But three years later, his wife, Elizabeth “Betsy” Murdock Myers; my wife, Suzanne; and I completed the journey, celebrating the wonder of it all with Chris in our hearts.”\n\n1976\n\nChristina Barros Kramer retired after 30+ years of work in international health, having visited over 40 countries and lived abroad four years. “I loved work,” she notes, “and I love retirement. I now volunteer at several places, including an equine therapy program and grant writing for a nonprofit in Nepal. Living in Alexandria, Virginia, with husband and two sons. I’m still in close touch with Elizabeth R. Honecker ’77.”\n\n1976\n\nTanna L. Moore writes, “Serendipity has led me to be very engaged in hosting international students and businesspeople from around the world through my engagement with Global Minnesota and the Humphrey School of Public Policy. It takes a bit of getting used to the diplomatic language after being in business for over 40 years … never a straight answer. I’m also deeply engaged in the music world, hosting mid-career classical musicians for the Lakes Area Music Festival. They have actually motivated me to start playing piano again. Splitting time between Minneapolis; Crosslake, Minnesota; and Charleston, South Carolina. I’m kind of going with the flow and loving it.”\n\n1976\n\nRabbi Charles P. Rabinowitz, Larchmont, New York, shared, “When I arrived at Kenyon for the first time, sitting in the back seat with my bike against my knees, I was the youngest member of my class, at just 17. I had spent my last year of high school in Israel and thought in Hebrew, translating back into English, that first semester. My academic journey began with Professor Eugen Kullmann, who knew my grandfather and father and knew that I would continue the rabbinic service of my family. He had a tremendous influence on me.” Charlie is co-editor of the revitalized Journal of Jewish Spiritual Care and just completed a memorial book edited by Rabbi Steven J. Lebow ’77. For the third year running, Charlie and his family met Stephen W. Grant in Ogunquit, Maine, “for walks along the coast, good seafood and better conversation,” he notes.\n\n1976\n\nJanet Byrne Smith and Murray J. Smith ’75 moved to Gambier in 2017 after 32 years in northern New Jersey and commuting into Manhattan, she notes. “We were in desperate need of a break from the crowds, noise and pressure, and we’ve found it here. I was able to continue working part-time from Gambier until early 2020, but then the pandemic hit; and I have not looked back. For the last few years, I have been more and more involved with the Knox County Democratic Party.” Janet canvassed area households to urge Yes votes on Ohio’s reproductive freedom ballot issue, which passed in November. “I swim almost daily in Kenyon’s amazing pool, the likes of which is completely unavailable in the New York City metropolitan area, and this summer I participated in the inaugural Total Performance Masters Swimming camp held at Kenyon. I was by far the oldest and slowest, swimming alongside several former Ladies swimmers, but we all had lots of fun, and our coach, Danielle M. Korman ’06, was phenomenal. Murray and I travel as much as we can, with trips to Mexico City, Alaska and Nova Scotia planned for 2024.”\n\n1976\n\nDeborah E. Tepper moved from Cape Cod back to her hometown of Pound Ridge, New York. “It was a difficult decision,” she explains, “but we are now two miles from our grandchildren and enjoy the peace and quiet of living on the edge of a forest. There is time to garden, as well as work on environmental advocacy and animal protection causes. It’s an easy trip to NYC for shows, too.”\n\n1976\n\nJoel E. Turner and Timothy P. O'Neill '76 recently visited Ben Drake, professor of English at Kenyon from 1972 to 1976, at his home in Peachtree City, Georgia. Their talk ranged from Shakespeare to Milton to the Kokosing to Ben’s work with the Highlander Center to the birds and trees in the woods behind Ben’s home. Ben revealed that he was using a replica/copy of Shakespeare’s First Folio as a stand for his computer — a copy he had bought from Terence W. McKiernan in 1976. Tim subsequently “delivered the folio back to Terry in Boston, a truly poetic reunion.”\n\n1976\n\nMichael W. Young, Carlsbad, California, announces a monthly LinkedIn audio program, “Clinical Trials: OBQ (One Burning Question).” Alongside six co-moderators, he and his fellow hosts discuss the design, development and execution of clinical trials for new pharmaceuticals. “A year of programming thus far included a four-month series on JEDI (justice, equity, diversity, inclusion) in clinical trial enrollment,” he informs. “Pleased to note we’ve had over 1,000 people join the live audio sessions to date! Happy to connect with any life sciences alumni at linkedin.com/in/mwyoungrx.”\n\n1977\n\n“After having done almost no traveling the past few years, my partner, Jeff Meckling, and I headed to southern California for a week in September. I wandered the terrific Hollywood Farmers Market with Margrit B. Polak Shield, got lessons in olive harvesting from a grower in Ojai, and revisited those lovely spots I knew in Santa Barbara, where William T. Haebler Jr. and J. Lindsey Flexner and I moved right after graduation. Great trip!”\n\n— Mieke H. Bomann\n\n1977\n\nPatrick J. Edwards, Boulder, Colorado, celebrated a 40th wedding anniversary with his wife, Maryann, in the U.K., returning on the Queen Mary II. “Recently enjoyed my 50th Lake Forest H.S. reunion, even though there seemed to be some older folks attend-ing?” he jokes. “Joined our local volunteer fire department in the Boulder foothills and playing tennis — my team just represented Colorado in USTA play against other mountain states in Utah.”\n\n1977\n\nJerome “Jerry” Mindes, Rockville, Maryland, is the senior advisor for inclusive development on a new USAID project to advance the next generation of development assistance. He’s also enjoying his volunteer work on the Alumni Council and with the Alumni Friends of DISCO, a committee of students with disabilities.\n\n1977\n\nDonald B. Taber married Dorota Podlaska, an artist. They live on a small farm in southern Portugal “with plenty of room for visitors,” he notes.\n\n1979\n\nMary Anne Cunningham retired in 2020 from a long career with nonprofits, she informs, “most recently a 26-year stint using my Kenyon history degree at the Oberlin (Ohio) Heritage Center. … It’s been my good fortune that Kenyon roommate Allison Gould Gallaher worked across the street at Oberlin, and we could get together for lunch regularly — and continue to do so.”\n\n1979\n\nWai-Kwong Kwok reports, “Finally retired from Argonne National Laboratory in September after work-ing there since 1984! Looking forward to new adventures, Seido Karate (in Chicago and Manhattan), and especially spending time with the grandkids!”\n\n1979\n\nAnn Hess Myers and Kurt J. Myers ’78 are “retired and enjoying life!” Ann submits. “Kurt retired in May 2023 from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation after 25 years, most recently as deputy secretary for driver and vehicle services. I retired in October 2022 after 40 years in fundraising. We spend our time in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Chatham, Massachusetts, with our 16-year-old golden retriever, Bexley.”\n\n1979\n\nBarry Rosenberg and his wife, Marilyn, welcomed their first grandchild in July and are now happy members of a three-generation household. “I’m still working as a course developer at Google. Last summer, I got to hang out with David D. Peterson and Kenton J. Blagbrough on Cape Cod. Zoom calls with Thomas L. Pappenhagen and David R. Bucey were a big upside to the pandemic.”\n\n1979\n\nTracy Teweles, Wilmette, Illinois, had “a truly lovely reunion with Leslie Andren Olsen,” she reports. “We were next-door carrel mates in the library our senior year, where we became friends. Over lunch we realized — again — how much we have in common!”\n\n1979\n\nMark L. Thomay, Middleburg Heights, Ohio, played golf with his basketball teammate Scott D. Rogers ’80: “He’s still The Man! Happy to report that my wife, Joan, and I are greatly blessed with seven grandchildren, all boys!”\n\n1979\n\n“Really looking forward to going back to campus next May. Being retired, my husband and I have been able to spend five months at our camp in the Adirondacks, with family coming and going. Lots of hiking! I am still involved with some volunteer organizations, which I enjoy very much. Two grandchildren and one on the way!”\n\n— Margaret Whitman, Baltimore\n\n1980\n\nVirginia Calhoun de Millan, Chiapas, Mexico, updates, “After 20 years of studying and teaching linguistics, first language acquisition vs. second language learning, and the neuroscience of language development in babies at the Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas, I’m having a ball watching all this happen in real time with my delightful 18-month-old grand-son Xun (Juan/John; in Mayan, Tsotsil). He now understands and responds to nearly every conversation around him, Spanish or English: pointing at the appropriate things or carrying out complex commands. His language production is a little slower: Mama, Dada and the sounds produced by dogs, cats, horses, owls, motor-cycles and blenders. As my daughter and son-in-law work full time, I get to be the Dictadora Vitalicia del Lenguaje.”\n\n1980\n\nQuentin R. Hardy, Berkeley, California, updates, “I’m writing a lot about AI at Google, and on the side have writing projects about bookbinding and Renaissance science. My Kenyon education is invaluable for them all. My wife just finished her year of nasty cancer drugs and is doing great.” He adds, “I was in Montana a few times in the spring for the terminal months of Joe Goia ’77. Several other friends — Christopher M. Bench ’05, Thomas E. Fath ’78, Tom Ford ’79 P’07, Gary D. Snyder ’79, Kyle W. Henderson ’80, among others — visited, for which Joe was very grateful.”\n\n1981\n\nWilliam H. Derks returned to Kenyon “for the first-ever swimmers reunion and the induction of Jim Steen into the Kenyon Athletic Hall of Fame (about time). Hundreds of swimmers returned, including a great representation by the ’81 grads, including James F. Parker, Steven R. Counsell, William A. Fullmer and Donald L. Shupe Jr. The weekend included some great times at the VI and the beer tent, beyond the more formal events and the stellar alumni relays. That pool even made the old guys feel fast again. Now back in North Carolina, where I have lived for the last 37 years, working as a civil engineer and on the board of directors of a successful land development consulting firm. All three kids grown up and on their own, leaving Colleen and me enjoying being empty-nesters.”\n\n1981\n\nWendy A. MacLeod’s newest play, “Posterity,” winner of the Sue Winge Playwriting Award, was produced in Philadelphia at Villanova Theatre in November by the graduate acting students, directed by Ed Sobel.\n\n1981\n\nDavid P. Rose celebrated the wedding of daughter Abigail last summer in Maine. “She currently works in the advancement office at Kenyon,” he notes. “Kenyon folks in attendance: Kyle A. Laux ’03, Maya A. Artis ’13, Anna V. Harnsberger ’23, Abigail, me, Myles H. Alderman Jr. ’82, Stephen Honig ’68 and Ugnius ‘Ugi’ Zilinskas ’21. We also celebrated my son’s marriage in June and welcomed my first grandchild, Emmet, in December 2022. She is a beautiful red-headed girl with a terrific smile.”\n\n1982\n\nSylvia S. Duggan, Philadelphia, works part time as an assistant for a small church preschool and enjoys “going to the occasional Phillies game with Kristen M. Richardson ’84. Love keeping in touch with Kenyon friends online. One of my children is grown and flown to Baltimore and the other at home finishing up a COVID-interrupted college journey.”\n\n1982\n\nHilary Quay Sparks-Roberts, Old Lyme, Connecticut, writes, “In light of our upcoming bicentennial, I find myself reflecting on Kenyon highlights: starting a campus chapter of Amnesty International; seeing the gorgeous Paul Newman at close range in the Village Market and later hearing him and his wife on stage at Rosse Hall; collaborating with fellow students and faculty to raise awareness about the lack of accessibility on campus; playing volleyball with an amazing group of women and then charging up the hill to make choir practice; and hearing from poets and politicians — especially the fiery debate between Ramsey Clark and Gen. William Westmoreland. And all of this on top of the perpetual academic demands and delights among inspiring professors. I am forever grateful.”\n\n1982\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Brian K. Wilbert retired from full-time ministry on Dec. 31, 2022. He continues to work as the archivist for the Episcopal Diocese of Ohio and as a Sunday supply priest at St. Paul’s Church in Norwalk, Ohio. Brian is the convener of the Province V Archivists and Historians of the Episcopal Church and serves as a trustee with the Oberlin Heritage Center. He is also helping his siblings care for their 85-year-old mother, who comes to stay with him and his husband, Yorki Encalada, at their home in Oberlin for a week every month. In his spare time, Brian continues to work on his 1924 Model T Ford, genealogy and collecting antique phonographs.\n\n1982\n\nMichael K. Zorek notes, “As Kenyon approaches its bicentennial, it sometimes feels like we graduated 200 years ago! It’s nice to be in touch with classmates, mostly with Michael G. Berick; even though he and his family live in L.A., we remain close friends! … It is fun to speak with recent graduates who frequent the Drama Book Shop here in New York City while they look for material to inspire them as they write plays, direct or act. A recent customer I spoke with was the daughter of Neil L. Pepe ’85, who has been the artistic director of the Atlantic Theater Company in New York since 1992. A not-so-recent grad who visited recently was Matthew C. Pasher ’88.”\n\n1983\n\nSusan A. Apel, Blawnox, Pennsylvania, joined the Alumni Council for a three-year term. “If anyone has any concerns or questions, please let me know (saapel17@ gmail.com).”\n\n1983\n\nWilling L. Biddle updates, “After 30 years of building a real estate investment trust focused on shopping centers in the New York area, we sold the company to a larger REIT, and I am lucky to be able to retire. Looking forward to the third chapter in life with many adventures and friends!”\n\n1983\n\nJohn N. Cannon, Shaker Heights, Ohio, recovered well from total knee replacement in the spring and summer, and now needs a hip replacement. But after Oktoberfest, he headed off to Austria and Prague.\n\n1983\n\nPeter C. Fischelis reports, “This summer we spent a great day in Niantic, Connecticut, with our Kenyon soccer coach, Jeff Vennell, and his wife, Judy. Patrick B. Grant ’85 and Gwynith Mayers Grant ’86, William H. Alderman ’84 (with partner Lori Goldenberg) and George H. Carroll were all in attendance.” Peter is in his 11th season as varsity coach of the Concord-Carlisle girls soccer team.\n\n1983\n\nWilliam S. Sondheim, Fairfield, Connecticut, informs, “This summer I became a grandfather of a beautiful girl named after my mom. All three of my grown kids have found wonderful life partners, and Cathy and I feel very blessed with our family finding happiness. Work has been more challenging, with the Hollywood actors and writers strike affecting my ability to get new films into production. Still consulting for Bleecker and Neon Pictures and a few others, so staying busy despite tough entertainment environment.”\n\n1984\n\nAmy E. Chenoweth observes, “I can hardly believe this spring marks 40 years since graduation. I always smile when I see the occasional purple Kenyon College decal here in central Virginia. After nearly 30 years, I have left full-time nursing (oncology, surgery and anesthesia, nursing education) and am now working part time as a nursing clinical instructor and trying my hand at freelance health writing. Thank you, Kenyon, for a writing-intensive and literature-loving education!”\n\n1984\n\n“After 27 years of service to the state university system of Florida, I retired from the role of chief procurement officer at the University of Florida, in Gainesville. I am now enjoying not: having to get up at a specific time; having multiple meetings, virtual or in person; being in charge of people; and navigating the complexities of a large public institution. I do miss (some) colleagues but look forward to the next chapter.”\n\n— Lisa (Stearns) Deal\n\n1984\n\nCynthia Frost, Lake Bluff, Illinois, notes, “Now that our kids are grown and gone, a few old friends from Kenyon have been able to rekindle past camaraderie. I recently went on my fourth, maybe fifth trip with Carolyn S. Lackey, William H. Knopp, Pam Sweet and Bennett A. Blau,” Cindy shares. “Together, we have toured Chicago, Sonoma, New Hampshire, many places in the Boston area and now the Highlands of Scotland. Those who journey to the town of Gambier are destined to reunite in the journey around our wondrous world. The question is: Where next?”\n\n1984\n\nDonata A. Rechnitzer, Frankfort, Ohio, updates, “Instead of retiring, I transitioned from medical director for three urgent care centers doing direct patient care to a work-from-home physician reviewer for a large insurance provider. Some might say I have gone to the ‘dark side,’ but I love it! I now take vacations, and have time to plan for our 40th Reunion! I really hope to see Christopher C. Penn, Deborah L. Winkle and Katherine (Webster) Kindbom in 2024 … hint, hint!”\n\n1985\n\nRichard K. Lincoln Jr. updates, “After almost five years living and traveling on our boat, Apricity, we have returned to a terrestrial life. We have settled in southeastern Massachusetts, and I plan to re-enter the workforce in the coming months. After a life mostly without seasons for the past four years, I am looking forward to New England’s seasonal changes.”\n\n1985\n\nPeter A. Propp informs, “With kids well out of the house and parents sadly gone, I’ve returned to the software business, tapping into my 15 years of experience at IBM, to help lead KnockMedia, a full-stack UX shop at Yale Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut. We build online platforms for global brands like Yale University, Home Depot, Booking.com and TED Talks. I also volunteer on a variety of local and regional initiatives and serve on a few boards. My latest instrument is mandolin, and I occasionally get a chance to perform or jam. And the Propp family’s favorite annual event is the Newport Folk Festival, where Suzanne and I experience amazing music with Julia Lyon Borden ’83, her husband, Tom, and our kids and friends.”\n\n1985\n\nFrank R. Virnelli Jr. reports, “J. William “Billy” Pinkston III, Matthew F. Rhoa, John Callinan and I celebrated our 60th birthdays in Napa, California, during the third weekend of September. Officially, the occasion was a surprise party for Matt, attended by his family and friends from high school to today. We had a tour and wine tasting followed by the party itself at a different ranch. Although we are in constant contact electronically, it was great to see each other in person and spend time together.”\n\n1986\n\nWilliam I. Hitchcock writes, “Happily still teaching history at UVA. Spent the fall of 2023 at Oxford University. I’m working away on a new book about how Americans responded to the rise of fascism in Europe in the 1930s.”\n\n1987\n\nStephanie L. Abbajay shares, “What a busy year this has been! I’ve been promoting my book “A Bar in Toledo,” working on the sequel, running David Stine Furniture and visiting old friends all over — including Joseph E. Lipscomb, Linda Djerejian Eigeman and Christopher J. Eigeman, Ed Wood, and Robin (Zaplar) Goodstein. E.W. Gentry Sayad ’86 and I have lunch and dinner regularly in St. Louis, and we even hosted Curt B. Kinsky ’85 and Mary E. Abbajay ’86 this summer. For my 40th high school reunion I spent some time in Toledo. September 19, 2023, also marked a sad anniversary: Forty years ago, my brother Robert R. Abbajay ’85 died at Kenyon. You may recall he was a junior while Mary was a sophomore and I was a freshman. Bobby’s death was an epic tragedy that rocked my family to the core. But that tragedy was made bearable — even now, 40 years later — by the incredible outpouring of love and support from the Kenyon community. From his brothers in Beta Theta Pi to my then-new friends in Norton Hall, to the faculty, staff and student body, the Kenyon community rallied around me and my family in the most open-hearted and supportive way. It was incredible. And I still feel it today, as his friends and brothers send Mary and me notes of love and support. In honor of Kenyon’s Bicentennial, and in honor of Bobby’s death, I’d like to increase foundational support for the Robert Abbajay Memorial Scholarship. I can think of no better way to honor Kenyon’s legacy and Bobby’s memory.”\n\n1987\n\nDavid F. Hanson notes, “I’m still living in Columbus and working as an attorney at the Ohio Public Defender. I make it up to Gambier often for a variety of things, and enjoy being ‘Uncle Dave’ to friends’ kids at Kenyon.”\n\n1987\n\nJoseph T. Leone caught up with Christopher D. Klein ’88 in Milwaukee at his youngest daughter’s first communion, he informs. “Got to spend some time with his two older kids (both flown the coop, more or less). Great time! All good here in Madison. Playing gentleman farmer (sheep, cattle, laying hens) in between writing patent applications!”\n\n1987\n\n“Our daughter Alexa is a freshman in high school and starting to think about colleges. Michael is a nurse anesthetist retired from the Navy. I am a pediatric surgeon specializing in neonatal, general and thoracic surgery for children. I love hearing updates from classmates and I figured it was my turn!”\n\n— Fawn C. Lewis, Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\n1987\n\nKeri Waltner submits, “I continue to teach high school in Falls Church, Virginia, but I have switched from teaching German to teaching ESOL (more job security). My husband teaches history in a neighboring district. My two young adult children took some time off after high school to work, but both have recently decided to start a program at the local community college. They live only 20 minutes from us, so we have the best of both worlds — we get together often as a family, but we have the house to ourselves.”\n\n1988\n\nPaul A. Baier declares, “Life in Boston has been good. I’ve been enjoying staying in touch with the Kenyon basketball team from our years. Also working with generative AI, things like ChatGPT, for business, and would welcome connecting with other AI enthusiasts.”\n\n1988\n\nJessica Brown moved to Colorado to launch a public creative and performing arts school outside of Denver in Aurora, the Charles Burrell Visual and Performing Arts School. “We launched the K-12 school last year and named it after the first African American musician to contract with a major symphony. Charles Burrell is often called the Jackie Robinson of classical music. When not at work, I can be found hiking and checking out lots of wonderful mountain towns. I hike with field hockey teammate Sarah Q. “Sally” Wagner ’86 and see Douglas Gertner ’81 at music house parties that he hosts.”\n\n1988\n\nTara L. Jones, Eugene, Oregon, reports that her pantry is stocked with her own grape and aronia juice, apple cider, applesauce, raisins, and dried mulberries, aronia berries, pears and apples. “All this work was made possible, in part, by my decision to work even more part-time than previously: from 30 hours to 12. I’m loving it! With the dark months of the year approaching, I look forward to getting back to my piano and guitar, open mics, composing, meditation and all the other things that got put on hold during all the sunny months in the garden.”\n\n1988\n\nG. Stephen McCrocklin, Louisville, Kentucky, had a fun year of travel. “I met Tim Holmes in San Rafael, California, last September; David P. Diggdon in Seattle in July; Sophia R. Heller in New York in August; and in September Paul C. Bingaman and Sonya (Kane) Bingaman ’89, who live near Meersburg, Germany. Of course we took in Oktoberfest. Sure is fun having classmates all around the globe! Andrew G. McCabe, I’m coming for you next in D.C.! Check out my online company that teaches reading to kids grades 3–8 at WeTeachReading.com!”\n\n1988\n\nJeffrey A. Richards, Columbus, Ohio, enjoyed reconnecting with Reunion committee members and friends while attending the Homecoming game (Kenyon 40, Hiram 16). “Had a good time with former football players Joseph A. Coates ’85 and David F. Hanson ’87, and with Scott H. Ehrlich ’89 and Robert J. Zaiser ’86, who are parents of current players.”\n\n1988\n\nKevin B. Richardson reflects, “Leafing through the latest copy of the Bulletin, I was struck by the fickleness of time. Not long ago, starting in the back — just my weird habit? — only a few page turns reached the Class of 1988. As I turned and turned and turned some more, I realized that 35 years have passed. Kenyon really was an amazing springboard into adulthood. And now as I think about retirement, I wonder how I could have let that connection slip away. I hope by writing this I can reconnect a bit — and also encourage those folks on the ‘pages nearer the back’ to keep their connection!” Kevin and his wife celebrated their 35th anniversary with a trip to Jordan.”My oldest is busy here in Atlanta with my three grandchildren, 11, 7 and 4. And I am immensely enjoying building a world-class HR department for a growing automation company. Having started with two, I’ll soon have 18 people on my team; as much as I complain about Gen Y and Z, I am truly enjoying coaching and mentoring the next generations. Still writing and struggling to learn guitar.”\n\n1988\n\nTamsin Smith, San Francisco, informs, “Dead & Company concerts in San Francisco brought several alums out west, and Oliver J. Janssen ’86 and Caitlin M. Long hosted an unforgettable reunion with Wallace C. Henderson ’85, Patrick T. Flood ’87, Lawrence P. Kass ’85, David W. Seevers and Philip E. Cable ’85. So fun. My eldest, Scully, teaches English lit at Berkeley High, and Tabitha is in her second year at Northeastern. I’m still consulting on brand strategy but devoting more and more time to my creative pursuits — painting, poetry and art essays. I also started a songwriting collaboration with my partner. Our first LP is now streaming on all the var-ious platforms, or listen on www.wundercat.us.”\n\n1988\n\nShelley G. Swank-Anderson and Kevin J. Anderson are empty-nesters now that son Scott is off to DePauw. “He was admitted to Kenyon, but really likes the vibe of the Tigers, so he is the only Anderson who is not a Lord/Lady/Owl. It’s fun learning other colleges’ traditions! We actually own black and gold fan gear now! Our daughters, Kiele L. Anderson ’21 and Leah N. Anderson ’23, struggle to cheer for DePauw teams, except men’s tennis, because they do still strongly root for their brother! Formerly a goalie, Leah was named NCAC Defensive Player of the Year, and in Kiele’s senior year she won the ’21 Falkenstine Award. Kevin still works as a banker in Peoria, Illinois, and I try to be helpful in the community with Meals on Wheels and substitute teaching. I am considering getting more involved with the local Multiple Sclerosis Society, as time and confidence permit.”\n\n1988\n\nBeth Miyashiro Vivio reports, “We ended an action-packed summer with a month in Park City, Utah, the perfect place to escape Florida heat and hurricanes. Right after leaving Utah, I headed to Gambier for my first KFEC meeting. I had such a great time getting to know my fellow committee members from different classes and enjoyed getting to hear from President Kornfeld. I had a visit with retired Professor Robert Bennett in Gambier, and then the next day when he and his husband, Larry, flew into St. Petersburg.”\n\n1989\n\nChandra Billiar Andersson cheers, “Hello, Cleveland! After working in banking and then raising three kids (now 22, 23 and 25) in New York City, I have just moved back to my hometown. I enjoyed getting involved with Kenyon alumni through the NYC regional committee and Reunion planning, and I am excited to reconnect with fellow grads here on the North Shore. I will be starting a master’s in mental health counseling in the spring.”\n\n1989\n\nSusan Bloom Hudgins launched a new business, Blooming Brains Coaching. “I offer a blend of college consulting, executive function coaching, and writing and reading support to students of all ages. I love it! My son William B. “Dell” Hudgins ’22 works in Richmond, Virginia, with Philip F. Abraham ’79. When he interviewed for the job, he was unaware of the connection but was wearing his Kenyon tie! My youngest, Porter, returned with me to Gambier to help plan our 35th. Susan also visited Melissa Thorn Tierney and her husband, Bill, in Boston.\n\n1989\n\nKyla K. Carlson, Kirkland, Washington, serves on the Alumni Council and Reunion Planning Committee, and visits daughter Shea C. Wilt ’25 on campus — which “gives me the opportunity to return to Kenyon frequently, for which I am always grateful. Where else can I attempt to re-create my early 20s? (Spoiler: Monday mornings after a weekend of tequila consumption as a 56-year-old are definitely harder!)” In September, Kyla joined Shea’s 8 a.m. behavioral science class taught by Iris Levin. “I honestly was riveted, especially when Dr. Levin showed videos of crows and experiments that high-lighted their amazing intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.” Kyla also enjoyed seeing Jeannine M. Gury, Lisa (Betson) Resnik and Edgar Arceo P’15, with whom Shea discussed neuroscience and studio art career opportunities. “When I’m not trying to relive my college years, I am working to get the Seattle Regional Association back on its feet post-COVID. I’m AP coordinator (and wear several other hats) at a 6-12 public school in Bellevue, Washington, where working with teenagers every day keeps me on my toes.”\n\n1989\n\nMarc D. Monseau and his wife, Susanna, moved to the Center City neighborhood of Philadelphia from Princeton, New Jersey, “to see what it is like to live in a city once again,” he shares. “We decided to do so after spending six months in Turku, Finland — where we both taught. Though I’m continuing to run my digital communications and marketing agency from the upper floor of an 1820s townhouse in Philly’s Queen Village district, I also just started teaching full time as a visiting professor at the College of New Jersey.”\n\n1989\n\nChristopher P. Toft and Nicole Dunn Toft ’92 took daughter Lucy to L.A. in August, where she is now an Occidental College first-year. “Janie, our oldest, is blazing her own trail by holding down three part-time jobs, making progress toward her undergrad degree and brilliantly acting in or handling tech responsibilities for theater productions.” Janie also recorded some songs with five-time Grammy nominee Liam Davis ’90, Chris notes. Also in August, Chris directed a production of Harold Pinter’s “Betrayal” for Edge of the Wood, a Chicago theater company. “I had a great lunch with Lawrence C. Grimm a few months back, and I continue to enjoy seeing him on some of the big Chicago stages. I’ve also frequently seen Liam, Eric M. Ziegenhagen ’93 and Mark Revermann ’99. Anne B. Cadigan ’92 and I correspond religiously about our N.Y. Times Spelling Bee scores.” Chris is VP of Advancement for Adler University. Nicole leads the education and mission committee for Edgebrook Community Church, “rules” the local women’s tennis scene and cements friend groups from high school to Ladies’ basketball to Teach for America alums.\n\n1989\n\nSarah Wilsman updates, “I’ve been at OverDrive, a tech company based here in Cleveland for five years helping schools build their digital collections. I work for Sora, the sister app of Libby — stop paying for Audible! Your public library gives you free access to audiobooks.” Sarah recommends listening to the Newman memoir “The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man,” which talks about Paul’s time at Kenyon, including his arrest in Mount Vernon. “I spend my free time volunteering, hiking and watching my granddog.”\n\n1989\n\n“After the long haul of the past three years, my work as a staff chaplain is entering a post-pandemic phase. Taking a break from training new chaplains, I am working on translating my eleven years of spiritual care practice in didactics, exercises and work processes, and lecturing at the IU School of Nursing. After a two-week training in October I saw Michael J. Mullen ’90 and Jeffrey A. Richards ’88 on my way home.”\n\n— Eric A. “Kip” Williams, Indianapolis\n\n1990\n\nJoseph C. Bline, Dublin, Ohio, dropped off his oldest, Steven Bline ’27, at Kenyon on Aug 19. “He is living in McBride Hall, and I am surprised how little has changed in 33 years. I was filled with pride and nostalgia as I walked around campus with him. Special thanks to Professor Gordon G. Loveland ’89 for being his physics advisor.”\n\n1990\n\nJennifer A. (Neiderhouser) Hedden relocated to Greenville, South Carolina, after the death of husband Chris. “After 14 years in Oakland, California, I am grateful for South Carolina’s lush greenery, frequent rain storms, abundant lightning bugs and absence of earthquakes. The joys and quirks of my new hometown are many, and I’ve been delighting in them all.”\n\n1991\n\n“Kathy and I are so proud for the upcoming graduation of our daughter Emma F. Abate ’24. It’s been a great experience com-ing back to Gambier and rekindling relation-ships over the last few years. It’s almost like I never left!”\n\n— Gregory J. Abate, Hollis, New Hampshire\n\n1991\n\nRichard H. Barron updates, “After 30 years of coaching college basketball, I retired to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, with my wife, Maureen, and son, Billy. Our twin daughters play softball at Swarthmore, and Billy and I won the state championship in basketball at Hilton Head Prep, where Maureen is a teacher. I am filling my days as a boat captain with Salty Dog at the South Beach Marina.”\n\n1991\n\nChristopher Kaufman Ilstrup, Montpelier, Vermont, spent the summer “cleaning up after the devastating July floods; the climate crisis is more real every day. At Vermont Humanities, I’m honored to work with the Vermont Arts and Culture Disaster and Resilience Network and the National Endowment for the Humanities, supporting the dozens of libraries, museums, galleries and other cultural organizations affected by the flooding. I was able to take a quick break in September to travel to London and visit with classmate Robert D. Schroeder, while Sarah S. Young ’95 swung through Vermont in early October.”\n\n1991\n\nKristin (Schelter) Macdonald reports, “I’ve lived in England for 23 years, currently in the bucolic Cambridge countryside, in a converted barn with my three wonderful sons, golden retriever and elderly cat. Oliver is in his second year at University of Nottingham, and twins Jasper and Angus are in 11th grade, doing their A levels. Oliver’s university housing accommodations are a far cry nicer than Bexley 112, with its walls made of paper, the shower serving nicely as a keg storage unit, and rooms so small we stacked our desks on top of each other to allow room to move. That being said, hand on heart, I made my most treasured friendships whilst at Kenyon. I regularly see my wonderful sister-in-law Julia R. (Fischoeder) Schelter and Shirley Y. Chung on Cape Cod and am still in touch with Heather (Huffman) Carskaddan, Nancy Cooper Coles and Kirstin (Peters) Dunlop. Though I have not been back since, I return often in my mind. My B.A. in English led to exciting executive positions at Ducati, Bvlgari, Bally, Fairchild Publications and more. When the children arrived, I retrained, designing and planting private residential gar-dens for 10 years. Now in retail, sourcing and selling antiques and vintage items at a tiny boutique called Oxbow & Peach, just outside of Cambridge.”\n\n1991\n\nJulie K. Roth updates, “Both our kids have launched, and both are now at University of Michigan — happy mama. I continue to work for the city of Ann Arbor’s Office of Sustainability and Innovations, now as energy manager, working to move the city to community-wide carbon neutrality by 2030. Any free time I find is usually on the tennis court.”\n\n1991\n\nLisa Timmel began a full-time job in Central Park this September after three years of volunteering. “My section is in the North Woods,” she explains, “one of the park’s ‘natural areas’ where we focus on cultivating and caring for native plants, keeping invasive plants under control, and less pleasant things like cleaning up trash left behind by park patrons. My favorite feature of my area is the native plant meadow at 102nd and the East Drive. Right now it’s full of goldenrod, rye grass, ironweed and asters and teeming with bees, hummingbirds and warblers.”\n\n1992\n\nKate Blanchard writes, “My spouse and I have been living in Minneapolis for almost a year, and it has been great to reconnect with folks around the Twin Cities. Recently, we went to hear Mike Cougar Hallenbeck play with his band. John W. Ursu and Matthew C. Gladue ’93 were also in the audience. Soon after, a more official alumni event, complete with sunset over Lake Minnetonka, was hosted by Chris T. Kirwan ’05 and M.E. Kirwan ’05. Kenyon is a gift that keeps on giving!”\n\n1992\n\nJenna J. Blum, Boston, is promoting her most recent book, “Woodrow on the Bench,” a memoir “about my beloved old black Lab.” She teaches, speaks, and is also “running my author interview company A Mighty Blaze, which puts authors with new books online so you can see your favorite writers in your living room without even having to put on pants! Recently, I interviewed Ann Patchett, Peter Heller and Andre Dubus. If you’re literarily minded, please visit the Blaze on all social platforms. Speaking of visiting, for two summers running I’ve hung out with Sharon Stochholm Wetzel, Jennifer (Bowman) Ryznar, Amy E. Haid and Megan Lewis-Schurter ’91 in beautiful Harbor Springs, Michigan, and in Colorado, where Meg and I went to a writing retreat in a nunnery! Our abiding connection continues to be a chief joy of my life.”\n\n1992\n\nPaul A. Hamann, Vancouver, Washington, started his sixth year as an instructional coach. “As much as I miss having a classroom,” he offers, “I have to say that a day when I can help a teacher, especially a new one, is every bit as satisfying as the best day in the classroom. I’m as excited to do my job as I ever have been. Meanwhile, my two sons are now in high school and middle school, and my wife teaches social studies — it’s a ton of fun to work together!”\n\n1992\n\nJoshua P. Rupright, San Francisco, describes “a fun and productive 2023 connecting with fellow Owls! SF sight-seeing and dinner with Tiel Arnot ’91, seeing Guy J. Tino perform in Connecticut, and hosting a great crew for the 1st Annual Memorial Day Weekend Goonfest at the ShermShack.” Attendees included Christian L. “Smitty” Smith, Joshua Zuckerberg, William B. Gregg ’91, Stephen M. Wrinn ’91 and Silvio A. “Sandy” Spadavecchia ’89. Also “a frothy summer afternoon hang with Jay B. Khetani on his back porch in Concord, Massachusetts, dinners in NYC with Richard A. Thompson III, golf in White Plains with Richard C. Mathes\n\n’89, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Fest with Joshua W. Danson ’94 and generally keeping it hazy here in S.F. with Alexander W. Kriney. Who’d I miss? Finley is a senior at Kent but unfortunately she shows no interest in Kenyon for next year. Griffin just started seventh grade at the Cathedral School for Boys and is enjoying his time in the Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys.”\n\n1993\n\nMary Kay Costello completed graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, shifting her career from info tech to become a speech language pathologist. She reconnected with roommate Katja Zerck at the 20th.\n\n1993\n\nKevin C. Kropf writes, “Imagine my surprise when a Class of ’93 classmate showed up for a cam-pus visit with her son at the college where I work. Double the surprise to find out Tobey K. Cronnell and I have lived a scant five miles apart for the past seven years without either of us knowing it. It has been great catching up since then here in Springfield, Missouri. Also connected with Gregory D. Smith when he was in town for work in September. We talked about all the fun he missed at the Reunion. One more neat Kenyon encounter was meeting Gwyndolyn E. Harrison ’94 at a St. Louis Cardinals game last summer.”\n\n1993\n\nVanessa Picard and Robert J. Wellman “née Bobbo,” of Pittsburgh, report, “Quotidian days slip into months and the months into years; children mature (fortunately) as do our remaining parents (unfortunately). We look at each other and still see the 18-year-old neophytes who met in Gund in 1989. Sadly, we then look in the mirror and wonder what the hell happened. Bobbo still plans on establishing a global hegemony via a steel empire (his employer — the same since 1994 — remains in the dark). Meanwhile, Vanessa steadfastly perfects her jousting skills when not shuttling their children to cross country and crew practices.”\n\n1993\n\nAmy C. Smith informs, “We couldn’t make it to Kenyon this summer, so Kim M. Sarnecki, Jennifer W. Shearin, Cheryl M. (Kluck) Nizam and I met in Nashville for our own reunion weekend. Kim lives in Issaquah, Washington, with her partner of 29 years. She’s CEO of Together Center, a human services hub and afford-able housing campus in Redmond. She’s also granny to two adorable 6-year-olds. Cheryl lives in Olympia, Washington, with her husband of 25 years. A luthier specializing in restorations and instrument-making, she’s mom of a freshman in high school and a college-age film major. Jen lives in northern Virginia and has taught high school social studies in Arlington for 25 years. She’s also mom of a freshman in high school and a seventh-grader. I’m in Atlanta, with my husband of 27 years, working as a nonprofit board governance consultant. I have a son in grad school in New York, and my daughter Audrey Smith ’27 is a freshman at Kenyon.”\n\n1993\n\nKelli J. Stenstrom and Matthew C. Schwab were married at Lion Rock Farm in Sharon, Connecticut, on Sept. 30, 2023, “after a nearly 30-year delayed engagement,” they share. “We were very happy to have a robust Kenyon contingent to help us celebrate, including John D. and Quimby Margaretten; Anne T. (Hickey) Meehan and Andrew D. Meehan ’90; Lisa Kay Primmer and Ryan Primmer, Karin A. “Kaki” Kinne McGeary, Elyse Forkosh Cutler, Rebecca A. (Palash) Barth and Patrick T. Sheehan. We also bought a house and moved to Riverside, Connecticut. Nothing like a lot of life changes at once!”\n\n1993\n\nAnn H. (Rittenbaum) Allain shares, “Life is good in Rhode Island. I am in my 19th year as a school counselor at a small independent day/boarding school, St. Andrew’s. Indigo (18), Jude (15) and I live in a house on campus which is beautiful, especially when the leaves start to change. Indigo is a freshman at Framingham State University and plans to study criminology. Jude is a sophomore at St. Andrew’s. Of course I am biased, but they are really great kids, and I am grateful for the life we have together.”\n\n1993\n\nAnthony R. Brown and his wife, Mariel, welcomed a baby in late May, Piper Joanna Brown. “We’re raising Piper at our farm in Monkton, Maryland, but also a few days a month at our apartment in lower Manhattan — better bagels. Peter D. Apple is Piper’s godfather.”\n\n1994\n\nKatherine Farnham updates, “I am a senior architectural historian at AECOM, where I’m part of a team designing ADA improvements to Amtrak stations nationwide. Outside of work, but very similar to work, I’m vice-chair of my township’s historical commission. I am also president of the Skycastle French Hounds basset pack and spend a lot of time training and hunting around Chester County, Pennsylvania, with our 16 Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen hounds — a rare-in-the-U.S. dog breed that won the 2023 Westminster Kennel Club dog show. My son Ned is a senior in high school, and my husband and I are almost empty-nesters. My daughter Helen is a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh, which has given me multiple opportunities to see Amy Katz Leaman and her family.”\n\n1994\n\nMichael P. Rutter, East Arlington, Massachusetts, submits, “I read a book or two now and again. Time permitting, I dig into academic classes. I’ve taken up running to reverse the spread of gravity. My wife and I do the best we can to raise our twin daughters, nearly teenagers, to be good humans and better stewards of the planet. I have a fantastic dog named Luna (who we call Tuna). I count myself lucky, gainfully employed in higher ed, and grateful for cool autumn mornings, silent, pitch-dark winter evenings and spring-to-summer transitions that inevitably erupt into beauty and chaos. Sure, I’d like a beach house — but for now, this is enough.”\n\n1995\n\nNatasha Carrasco Stillman updates, “Kia ora from Wellington, New Zealand. After several years in eastern Germany, I returned to New Zealand and have been working within the Outbreak Response Directorate, Te Whatu Ora Health NZ, National Public Health Service. … I have segued into the artificial intelligence/equity space, where I assume I will be happily ensconced for several years, because it’s definitely not boring and I hate being bored above all else.”\n\n1995\n\nAaron J. Derry, Missoula, Montana, shares, “For about one and a half years, I’ve been joining Todd J. Czartoski, Julian M. Murchison, Andrew M. Guest ’94 and Ryan J. McNulty ’94 every other month for book club on Zoom. Turns out these guys are still very thoughtful, high-character people, and I find myself enriched after every conversation. Best thing to come out of COVID for me in terms of getting reconnected with good people.”\n\n1995\n\nMichael S. Epstein, Cincinnati, notes, “Wife Mary M. Mason and I spent a great long weekend with Timothy J. Barry and family early last summer. Had a really great time catching up! I don’t know how the rest of you are celebrating your 50th birthdays, but for mine, I got a tattoo. My first. One that commemorates the most important risk I ever took, kissing Mary for the first time. Of course that happened at Kenyon, and the great tie-in is the tattoo is the GPS coordinates of that fateful smooch, translated into Hebrew and in the form of a tree. In my work life, I deal with risk and response all day long; to this day, after nearly 1,000 incidents from hurricanes to security issues, none have scared me as much\n\n1995\n\nAlice Mulvaney Link greets, “Hello from Alabama! My family ended up here after my husband, Col. Ryan Link (USAF Ret.), finished his career in the military after 26+ years. We spent our final assignment at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, and we enjoyed it immensely. My girls — middle school at the time — were the perfect age to travel around Europe and only got a little bit tired of churches and castles. (We’d throw in a water park or amusement park every now and again to prevent total rebellion.) Ellery, Megan and Sophia are now seniors in high school, and the college application process x3 is exhausting, emotional and exciting. So far it seems they will end up not in Alabama and not with a sister. I’ve finally gone back to work full time as a veterans’ disability attorney for a firm in Maine, working remotely.”\n\n1996\n\nChristopher C. Ellsworth, Mount Vernon, Ohio, notes, “I’m happy to report that year 22 at Kenyon is off to a good start. Attended the recent Homecoming festivities and loved watching the football team win and Kenyon embrace balloon culture! I love balloons!”\n\n1996\n\nMatthew J. Gernstein writes, “Rubbing elbows with Washington’s elite. At an event a few weeks ago, my arm bumped into Kamala Harris. The Secret Service was not happy about that and pushed me out of the way. Living in Arlington, Virginia. Near a motorcycle gang. Well, not a motorcycle gang per se — more like a bunch of Deloitte bro’s who own BMWs. I’m gainfully employed as a practitioner of the law. Probably not after they read this, though. Clearly, adulthood is going great.”\n\n1996\n\n“I’ve started teaching as an adjunct professor at Loyola University Chicago’s Quinlan School of Business, where I got my M.B.A. in 2008. It’s been fantastic engaging with undergrads, although grading really is a thing! I’ve also got a weekly radio show on WMXM. org, Mondays from 7 to 9 p.m. Central. If you’re into great music from different eras and genres, I invite you to tune in!”\n\n— Mark F. Haggarty\n\n1996\n\nGerald “Jerry” Kelly reports, “Busy, enriching years in Gambier! My spouse, Lori, and I have farmed flowers at the Kenyon Farm and completed a bunch of projects here at our house, just off the north edge of campus. Lori owns a flower and wine shop in downtown Mount Vernon, and I’m retired from my tech and solar careers, still doing small-press publishing and writing a hitchhiking memoir. Since 2015, I’ve been teaching an environmental studies course with Professor Eric Holdener. Our students are designing clean energy systems that now adorn rooftops on the Village Inn and Village Market, Gund Commons, Hoehn-Saric House, the Kenyon Farm and a number of residences in and around the village.”\n\n1996\n\nAbby S. Peck updates, “After eight wonderful years in Portland, Maine, I accepted a position as director of corporate and foundation relations at Clemson University in South Carolina. Being a northerner in the South is definitely leading to some culture shock! I can’t fault the weather, though, and it’s great job experience. Silvia L. Mercado Masters flew in from Chicago to help me get settled that first week. I’m a little farther from England now but still able to travel over to see my partner, Hazel, every few months. Who knows where I’ll land next?”\n\n1996\n\nAndrew S. Richmond happily announces the opening of an antiques and art auction house near Marietta, Ohio. “Meander Auctions had its first auction in September, and we are excited to see where this takes us. Grateful to classmate Joseph F. Herban for helping me vet the building we purchased for our new endeavor.”\n\n1996\n\n“After working at Kenyon and living in Knox County for 19.5 years, I am excited to share that I am the new university librarian at John Carroll University. Over the summer, my family and I moved to Shaker Heights, Ohio. Still in the process of settling in, but so far we love it up here.”\n\n— Julia M. Warga\n\n1997\n\nGeorge L. Hawkey, Seattle, works for Microsoft in the gaming and media space. George married his wife, Bénédicte, whom he met in 2017 during a business trip to Tokyo. “We spent a few years doing the long-distance thing, city-hopping, and I was lucky enough to spend months of that time in Japan. Thankfully, she decided to settle in Seattle for a while as she finishes up her M.B.A. at HEC in France. Teenage boys, 16 and 13, keep things interesting. One dreams of professional skate-boarding, the other of pro basketball stardom — so we’ll see how those play out.”\n\n1997\n\nStacey D. Nichols, Westerville, Ohio, marvels, “Thirty years! That is how long some of us have known each other. Lots of reminiscing lately with my former Gundie roommate Kelli A. Schrade — you know, the girl who arrived with her stuff packed in a boat! Helping out with First Year Move-In Day was a blast, seeing all of the wide-eyed freshmen with their insane amount of stuff and scared and excited looks on their faces. Best part was welcoming Benjamin Priestland ’27, son of our very own Jessica L. (Stockdale) Priestland. I had the opportunity to check out the new construction and the purple Adirondack chairs, and to soak up all things Kenyon before heading back to Columbus and the real world.”\n\n1998\n\nFrederick C. Bierman, Brooklyn, New York, informs, “Had a delightful dinner with Peter M. Sughrue Jr., Joseph D. Goldberg ’99 and James C. Stover ’99 in NYC, where Peter and I see each other frequently. Jamie has returned to his roots in New Jersey but can be found haunting the bars near Penn Station while waiting for the train. Joe was in town (from Oakland) for work, and it was great fun to catch up. Missing was Andrew B. Solar ’99, who has moved back to New York City and looks forward to getting back into musical theater and the Jets — two things he missed while living in Chicago.”\n\n1998\n\nSara E. Reish Desmond, Melrose, Massachusetts, landed a book contract with a University of Wisconsin press, Cornerstone. “My collection of short stories, ‘What We Might Become,’ will appear soon. One, ‘Cicadas,’ was published by the Kenyon Review several years ago. I’d be so appreciative if you’d consider pre-ordering when the collection becomes available. And once I know where I’ll be showing up on a (very modest) book tour, I’d love to see any and all Kenyon folks!”\n\n1998\n\nMcClain “Macy” L. Howarth enjoyed seeing many friendly faces at the 25th Reunion. “I was also completely in awe of the breathtaking new buildings and over-all changes on campus,” she notes. “I continue to live in Lexington, Massachusetts, with my husband, Bridger, and 11-year-old daughter, Livy. I work at a health-care startup, Devoted Health, and dedicate time to Be The Match, an organization near and dear to my heart after it helped enable a successful stem-cell transplant for me nine years ago.”\n\n1998\n\n“I continue to work at Columbus State in administration but now am fully remote. My husband, Jason, teaches middle school science, looking ahead to possible retirement in a few years. Most important, we are adjusting to empty-nester life. Auggie and Olivia are both at Denison University (classes of ’25 and ’26).”\n\n— Kathryn (Snyder) Howe, Upper Arlington, Ohio\n\n1999\n\nCourtney K. Bambrick teaches first-year writ-ing and public speaking at Thomas Jefferson University’s East Falls campus in Philadelphia. “Having a single full-time position after adjuncting for well over a decade has allowed me to prioritize my own writing and publishing, in addition to serving as poetry editor with Philadelphia Stories. After nine years, I am fairly acclimated to Delco. I hope to catch up with neighbors Krista M. Apple, Patricia M. McCartney and Meredith J. Methlie ’00 eventually!”\n\n1999\n\nChristopher A. Junkin updates, “After living in San Francisco, Philadelphia, London and New York in the years since Gambier, I just moved to the suburb of Pelham, New York, with my wife, Doro, and 9-year-old son, Anders. Still practicing architecture in Manhattan, but we will miss Brooklyn, which we called home for 11 years. I am also proud to announce Charles K. Sheldon’s intent to compete in next year’s Finnish Hobby Horse Championships.”\n\n1999\n\nZachary Nowak is the director of a study abroad program in Italy. He’s taken up sketching: “still pretty mediocre but getting better slowly.” He’d look forward to visits if you’re going to be near Perugia.\n\n1999\n\nAndrew W. Shannon has been busy at a new emergency medicine residency at Lakeland Regional Health in central Florida since leaving Jacksonville last year. “A challenge, for sure. Managed to make it to N.C. to celebrate Shannon A. Byrne’s wedding in April, and also caught up with Eliza Andrews ’00 and Lindsay M. (Irvin) Doyle there.”\n\n1999\n\nShelby (Van Voris) Schoenborn updates, “My lieutenant colonel husband retired after 23 years active duty in the Army. We’re enjoying retired life with our high schooler, Chloe — an avid rower at Tampa Prep here in Florida. I work with the veterans community at the VA in clinical cancer research. We lost my mom, Michelle “Mickie” Merian ’73, in March 2022. She moved to Tampa to be with us for her retirement, so the loss is difficult for us. We spent time this summer in the U.K., Germany, Poland, Finland and Sweden. I had the opportunity to meet the always lovely Mary Elizabeth Wilson in Berlin.”\n\n2000\n\nBenjamin D. Bagocius published “Queer Mrs. Ramsay, or Virginia Woolf’s Geomorphic Family” in Modern Fiction Studies and “Pheoby’s Queer Quietness in Their Eyes Were Watching God” in Mississippi Quarterly: The Journal of Southern Cultures. His first book of poems, “The Canaanite Woman,” appeared in 2022, and “The Gospel According to B.” comes out in 2024. Other recently submitted work on the mystical aesthetics of Virginia Woolf, Kazimir Malevich and Emily Dickinson soon to appear. “Learning Finnish to become more involved in the Finnish literary community.” Visit BenjaminBagocius. com.\n\n2000\n\nKelly P. Dillon, Grove City, Ohio, was named director of faculty development at Wittenberg University, after earning tenure promotion. “My husband, Eric, and I continue to marvel at our sons Jackson (16) and Benjamin (14) as they navigate high school, marching band, base-ball and the post-COVID landscape.”\n\n2000\n\nScott M. Kenemore, Evanston, Illinois, announces that the sci-fi/horror novel he wrote during COVID has been purchased by Skyhorse and will be published in the summer of 2024. “It’s currently titled ‘The Goo’ … though we’ll see if that sticks; publishers sure do like to change my titles. It imagines a future in which Google has become a religion, and a team of astronauts exploring a strange new planet find themselves mysteriously and irresistibly compelled to kill one another.”\n\n2000\n\nRachel I. Leber, Portland, Oregon, graduated from naturopathic medical school in June. “I’m taking some much needed time off before I start working with patients,” she informs. “Still playing in a samba percussion group, dancing, cycling and yoga-ing, and getting inspired for what’s ahead.”\n\n2000\n\nMichael S. Lewis, Concord, New Hampshire, submits, “The deteriorations we have seen throughout the country have caused me to develop a fairly robust civil rights practice. In one recent case, I sued a police chief and other municipal officials for retaliating against a local Jewish woman who criticized their lackluster response to neo-Nazi threats.” He worries about the inability of government leaders to respond to challenges, noting, “I’m really worried about what the next decade will bring. On the bright side, ice cream still tastes good.”\n\n2000\n\nIrene (Amanda) Loy is now the patron services and outreach manager with Westminster University Performing Arts Center in Salt Lake City. “It’s the perfect work blend with my low-residency Ph.D. program in creative research through Transart Institute/Liverpool John Moores University, which I expect to complete in October 2025. Last year, I got to go to Siena, Italy, to see Il Palio — a long-time goal of mine. I also enjoyed the publication of my first book of poetry by Common Meter Press, in July 2023.”\n\n2000\n\nSiiri C. Morley sends greetings from “the Smiling Coast of Africa, The Gambia!” With husband Jeremy and 6-year-old son Indigo, Siiri has relocated to become country director with the Peace Corps. “Jeremy and I met as Peace Corps volunteers in Lesotho. My job is both inspiring and challenging. I draw on my international studies and anthropology learnings from Kenyon every day as I work with local staff, government partners and U.S. volunteers. … We are enjoying the beautiful coastline — surfing/paddling opportunities included! — the stunning countryside, the food and, most especially, the warmth of the people.”\n\n2000\n\nMaraleen D. Shields left private practice after nearly 20 years to become the second executive director of the Pennsylvania Interbranch Commission for Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in its 20-year history. “An incredible opportunity to repurpose skills I developed as a trial attorney to advocate for meaningful change in Pennsylvania on a broad range of issues,” she explains. She also ran a half-marathon in November, her third in two years. “Hoping to break 1:40. Also continuing to expand my Spanish skills with two little training/practice partners, my kids Cole (13) and Sage (7).” She was appointed to Kenyon’s Board of Trustees in April.\n\n2001"
