        "text": "Both Democrats and Republicans in Kentucky are focusing on a special state House election, which could be the only race this year. The special election for the 56th House District will likely place added pressure on both parties to come through with a victory.\n\nRight now, Democrats have a five seat majority over Republicans in the state house. But if GOP nominee Lyen Crews can defeat Democrat James Kay on June 25, that will shrink the margin to four seats.\n\nRepublican Party of Kentucky chairman Steve Robertson says the 56th special election is Round 2 in a multi-year fight for the state house between his party and the Kentucky Democratic Party.\n\n\"Let's be realistic this election is going to be a big priority for both parties,” says Roberston.\n\nThe race could also be the first test of Super PAC might, as both Democratic and Republican Super PACs are been formed to influence state House races."
