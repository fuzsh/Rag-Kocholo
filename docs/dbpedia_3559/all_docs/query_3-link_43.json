        "text": "James Edwin Cramer, 77, of Columbia, Missouri died at home on Saturday, November 18, 2023 from Parkinson’s Disease with dementia resulting from exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.\n\nJim was born to Romona Ann (Donaly) Cramer and H. Edwin Cramer in Broken Bow, Nebraska on May 8, 1946. He attended Kansas State University and the University of North Dakota graduating with a BA degree in German in 1968. He was drafted by the Army and served with the Headquarters Support Battery, 4th Battalion, 42nd Artillery, 4th Infantry Division in Vietnam. Upon honorable discharge, he promptly took his army earnings and bought 1962 VW Bug, living in it for 9 months while enjoying Europe and becoming fluent in German.\n\nOn his return to the states, he attended graduate school at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln earning both a M.S. in Education and teaching certification. He taught German in Slayton, Minnesota before moving to Hastings, Nebraska where he taught German, coached wrestling and met his future wife.\n\nJim married Mary Kay McCart, librarian at the Junior High School, and they accepted teaching positions with the Department of Defense Schools for the children of military personnel stationed in Germany. They worked in Kaiserslautern, Ramstein Bad Kreuznach, Frankfurt, and Wiesbaden. While in Germany they attended several Oktober Fests and traveled throughout Europe. During this time, in the midst of the Cold War, they witnessed the build-up of military reinforcements to stop any Soviet Union advance at the Fulda Gap, and were in Berlin to witness in real time the Berlin Wall as it came down.\n\nJim and Mary took a sabbatical from work to finish their Ph.D.’s in Elementary Education and Reading at Ball State University. In 1990, they returned to the U.S. and took positions as assistant professors at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Jim later taught at Stephens College and the University of Missouri in Columbia, and at the Corbin Campus of Eastern Kentucky University.\n\nJim loved adventures and learning new things. He got his pilot’s license, took up scuba, sailing, downhill and cross-country skiing, hiking, backpacking, and fly fishing. This expertise served them well. In 2006, he and Mary put all of their belongings into storage and hit the road in a 5th wheel. They spent the next 10 years traveling and volunteering at National Forests, National Parks, and Fish and Wildlife Refuges in 12 states. Jim loved the different locations and habitats, especially learning what made them unique and to have the time and access to learn about and appreciate their diversity.\n\nAfter their 5th wheel was destroyed in a tornado that came through Jefferson City, Missouri in 2019 (no one was in it), Jim and Mary decided it was a sign to settle in one place. They purchased a condo in Columbia, Missouri, and finally retired.\n\nThrough all his travels and adventures, Jim always kept in touch with his many classmates from Bellevue, NE and friends from his numerous adventures and jobs. Wherever Jim was he made friends, whether in the mountains of Colorado, or at the local coffee shop. His sense of humor, kindness, wit and genuineness created lasting friendships.\n\nJim is survived by his wife, Mary Kay (McCart) Cramer of Columbia, Missouri, his sister, Carol Hannah (Bill) Williams, of Omaha, Nebraska; nieces and nephews, Amy (Michael) Ryan, Ann Williams, and David (Christy) Williams, Anthony, Michael (Allison) and Liliana Silvidi, by great nieces and nephews Olivia Ryan, Luke and Elle Miles and Sam and Cooper Williams. Jim is also survived by his rescued Golden Retriever, Ryeley.\n\nJim was preceded in death by his parents."
