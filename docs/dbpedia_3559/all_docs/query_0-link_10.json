        "text": "Donations to university endowments have always been controversial due to donors‚Äô potential sway over student applications and school policies. The prevalence of donations in the form of private-company shares has added more complications: ¬∑ The CEO of a Texas hemp farming company donated $237 million worth of shares in a private company to Florida A&M at a recent graduation ceremony, at which the donor was also a commencement speaker. As it turns out, there had been no independent valuations of the shares, which may very well be worth ‚Ä¶ nothing? (Miami Herald: https://lnkd.in/gzffQWFe) ¬∑ But relationships could also sour even if valuations go up. Bill Ackman donated $10 million of shares in then-private Coupang to Harvard in 2017. The company went public in 2021 and the shares were worth $85 million. Ackman later found out that the endowment had already sold the shares prior to the company‚Äôs IPO. ¬∑ What‚Äôs more, Ackman‚Äôs donation was structured such that if the shares fell below $10 million, he would make up for the difference, whereas if they rose to above $15 million, he would have the right to allocate the excess to any ‚ÄúHarvard-related initiative of his choice.‚Äù (WSJ: https://lnkd.in/gXAyDTkv) Speaking of private investments, Princeton‚Äôs allocation to PE and VC has grown to 40% (FT: https://lnkd.in/grBec_2e). There‚Äôs a case to be made that endowments could afford to go down the liquidity curve, and the Princeton model has been the envy to many. But periodic performance benchmarking does matter, not the least because external managers charge hefty fees as they would any asset owner (CEPR: https://lnkd.in/g_JgGKeR). #privateequity #privatecredit #endowment #collegeendowment #universityendowment #hedgefund\n\nI previously discussed my disdain that Bradley University (my alma mater) was planning to cut the school's entrepreneurship program. They're also ceasing majors and concentrations in economics and math. This is based on low enrollment representing <3% of the student body. The alumni association letter also stated \"While we recognize that these changes may create concerns among the broader Bradley community, we remain confident that this approach will ultimately bring our university to a secure future of renewed relevance and reach.\". I remain confident that this is a short-sighted strategy that firmly roots Bradley in tradition instead of growth. Universities need to run programs encouraging innovation instead of \"business as usual\". While my confidence in the university has diminished, I do have extreme confidence in one thing: I will not be donating to the university.\n\nMeet the Leaders Behind the Movement: PLAN4SUCCESS College Advisory Board!

It was a surprisingly ‚Äúchalky‚Äù first week of March Madness. The favorites mostly took care of business in the first two rounds: - All 1 and 2 seeds made it to the Sweet 16 for just the fifth time in the tournament‚Äôs history - The average margin of victory in the first weekend was 15.8 points ‚Äî second highest since 1985 That being said, we did see a few upsets in the opening slate of games. - 14-seed Oakland shocked Kentucky - 13-seed Yale took down Auburn - 12-seed James Madison ousted Wisconsin People know these Cinderella‚Äôs, but what is this Grand Canyon University that took down dark horse favorite Saint Mary's? Answer: GCU is the biggest school you‚Äôve never heard of. The private institution, located in Phoenix, Arizona, is the largest Christian university in the country, with a sizeable on-campus population (25,000) and a total enrollment of roughly 118,000 students due to the 92,000 online students. This is significant and somewhat different from the usual online student presence at universities that is predominantly focused on grad programs. But what makes GCU most unique is that they‚Äôre the only former for-profit, publicly traded entity in the March Madness field. In fact, their former holding company is still trading -- $LOPE. The school has drawn the ire of the Department of Education and the FTC for its questionable non-profit status and from opposing schools for their outsized spending, but it's pressing on -- using athletics as a means to grow their revenues and name recognition (the school has a goal to grow to 50,000 on-campus students by the end of the decade). The stranger than fiction story is both unsettling and somewhat appropriate for the uncertain times college athletics finds itself in. In this week‚Äôs SBP, you‚Äôll learn: - Grand Canyon University‚Äôs checkered past as a non-profit and for-profit, and their hybrid(?) profit model that has drawn the ire of other schools and government entities - Why a strong athletics program helps a school like GCU - How the GCU model could become a playbook for other investors interested in breaking into college athletics Check it out below üëá https://lnkd.in/gd2sAm-e\n\nThe brouhaha on US universities, with rich folks pulling donations, proves clearly that colleges and universities have sold out to rich folk (read #Nobel #AngusDeaton's new book). Here are some points to consider: 1. The University of Chicago (where I desperately wanted to go as my 1st econ book was #FreetoChoose), instead of naming their business school after #Nobels #MiltonFriedman or #GeorgeStigler, name the school after an alum who donated money made from creating basic indices for investors to buy. In other words, send the message to current and future students, that it is money that matters, not exactly education or changing the world. 2. Members of the #Boards or #investmentcommittee of #colleges and #universities are stacked with biggest donors, not folks who know the most about #education or #investments. If you want to be on the Board, you have to commit a certain level of donations; a friend at an endowment jokes about a \"value\" investor on his Board who will reject anything with an equation or \"quant\". Money talks! 3. The connection with dubious folks - #SBF and #Stanford; #Epstein and my alma mater; and so many more. Money talks.. 4. #Finance faculty writing papers with no practical relevance based on \"Epstein-Zin\" utility functions and charging $50K - $100K for speeches (and running cabals at the journals they control), while adjuncts teach classes and students are pushed into debt. The great #Nobel #FrancoModigliani taught into his 80s, read student papers and was always available and never took consulting money. He must be rolling in his grave. Money talks. This quote cracks me up - ‚ÄúI do not like making something like this about money ‚Äì but it appears to be one of the only paths that has any hope of mattering, and it has become clear that it is the only voice some of us have,‚Äù said hedge fund billionaire Cliff Asness, who just finished a five-year pledge to UPenn. PUH-LEASE! https://lnkd.in/e98vDrvX\n\nOne of my favorite articles, written as the pandemic was raging and financial concerns were mounting for many colleges and universities, continues to offer insights into the what's, how‚Äôs, and why‚Äôs (and why-not's) of university endowments. \"University endowments are vehicles to create and ensure perpetual, intergenerational wealth transfer. Ensuring intergenerational equity, while certainly a goal, is becoming increasingly difficult as university expenses are outpacing revenues. The costs of delivering a university education are increasing beyond many families‚Äô ability to pay.\" \"Endowments are established to provide guaranteed sources of funding to support students, faculty, programs, and facilities. They are not meant to be savings accounts that can be accessed without bound during times of need or even crisis. Doing anything to permanently reduce the power of these precious and generous gift instruments, entered into in good faith with donors over generations, would hurt the university in future generations and likely severely impact the trust and relationships that have been stewarded for many years and upon which universities depend (and will increasingly depend) for philanthropy.\" #highered #collegesanduniversities #endowments #philanthropy #postpandemic #intergenerationalwealthtransfer #intergenerationalequity #donors #donorintent #stewardship #foundations #development #cultivation\n\nùêìùê® ùêíùê≠ùê´ùê¢ùêØùêû. ùêìùê® ùêíùêûùêûùê§. ùêìùê® ùêÖùê¢ùêßùêù. Our #DNA is encompassed in those words. We believe that to find excellence, we must consistently strive to improve our understanding of the world and continuously seek knowledge. However, when striving to achieve excellence and especially academic excellence, one should not strive to make ends meet. This is why we decided to make a donation to the Bradford Futures Fund and support a University of Bradford student throughout the duration of their studies. The Bradford Futures #Fund was established to provide support to University of Bradford undergraduate students who come from traditionally non-privileged backgrounds struggling to cover living expenses. This support helps alleviate some of the #financialburdens students face and allows them to focus on their studies. Two thirds of students at the University of Bradford are the first in their families to pursue higher education. The decision to obtain a #bachelorsdegre is not only a gateway to a better future for themselves, but also their families and their communities. Since the first scholarships were awarded in the academic year 2021-2022, the demand for support has increased as has the cost of living. Our very own CEO, Dr Efstathios Vassiliadis, is a University of Bradford MBA graduate. We know firsthand about the quality of education the university offers and we feel honoured to be one of the scholarship donors that makes it possible for students at Bradford to continue to strive, seek and find knowledge. ‚Äúùòóùò≥ùò∞ùò∑ùò™ùò•ùò™ùòØùò® ùò∞ùò±ùò±ùò∞ùò≥ùòµùò∂ùòØùò™ùòµùò™ùò¶ùò¥ ùòßùò∞ùò≥ ùò¥ùòµùò∂ùò•ùò¶ùòØùòµùò¥ ùò∏ùò©ùò∞ ùò¥ùòµùò≥ùò™ùò∑ùò¶ ùòßùò∞ùò≥ ùò¥ùò§ùò™ùò¶ùòØùòµùò™ùòßùò™ùò§ ùò¨ùòØùò∞ùò∏ùò≠ùò¶ùò•ùò®ùò¶ ùò¢ùòØùò• ùò¥ùò¶ùò¶ùò¨ ùòµùò∞ ùò§ùò∞ùòØùòµùò≥ùò™ùò£ùò∂ùòµùò¶ ùòµùò∞ ùò¥ùò∞ùò§ùò™ùò¶ùòµùò∫ ùòµùò©ùò≥ùò∞ùò∂ùò®ùò© ùòµùò©ùò¶ùò™ùò≥ ùò•ùò¶ùò∑ùò¶ùò≠ùò∞ùò±ùòÆùò¶ùòØùòµ ùò™ùò¥ ùò¢ ùòÆùò™ùò¥ùò¥ùò™ùò∞ùòØ ùòßùò∞ùò≥ Evnia. ùòûùò¶ ùò¥ùò¶ùò¶ùò¨ ùòµùò∞ ùò¥ùò∂ùò±ùò±ùò∞ùò≥ùòµ ùòµùò©ùò∞ùò¥ùò¶ ùò¶ùòßùòßùò∞ùò≥ùòµùò¥ ùò¢ùòØùò• ùò¶ùòØùò¥ùò∂ùò≥ùò¶ ùòµùò©ùò¢ùòµ ùòµùò©ùò¶ ùò¥ùò±ùò™ùò≥ùò™ùòµ ùò∞ùòß ùò®ùò™ùò∑ùò™ùòØùò® ùò¢ùòØùò• ùò¥ùò¶ùò≠ùòßùò≠ùò¶ùò¥ùò¥ ùò§ùò∞ùòØùòµùò≥ùò™ùò£ùò∂ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØ ùò™ùò¥ ùò¢ùò≠ùò¥ùò∞ ùò±ùò¢ùò¥ùò¥ùò¶ùò• ùòßùò≥ùò∞ùòÆ ùòµùò©ùò¶ùòÆ ùòµùò∞ ùòµùò©ùò¶ ùòØùò¶ùòπùòµ ùò®ùò¶ùòØùò¶ùò≥ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØ ùò∞ùòß ùò¨ùòØùò∞ùò∏ùò≠ùò¶ùò•ùò®ùò¶ ùò¥ùò¶ùò¶ùò¨ùò¶ùò≥ùò¥.‚Äù Dr Efstathios Vassiliadis, Evnia Group CEO #Evnia_CSR #ToStriveToSeekToFind #Evnia_Filotimo #fundingopportunity #fundingnews #education #educationforall #educationequity #educationaljourney #scholarships #scholarshipopportunity"
