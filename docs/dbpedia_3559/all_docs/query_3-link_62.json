        "text": "The annual NCES Back to School Readifest and Open House was held on Monday, August 13, 2024, from 5 to 7:00pm. Families with children of all ages participated in the yearly event, and the parking lots stayed almost completely full between the hours of 5:00 to 7:00pm, with a very long line going in the front door of the elementary school.

Mr. Peters has been charged with one count of Speeding â 19MPH Over Limit; one count of Failure to Produce Insurance Card; one count of Failure of Non-Owner Operator to Maintain Required Insurance/Security, 1st Offense; and one count of Fleeing or Evading Police, 1st Degree (Motor Vehicle). According to the uniform citation, Carlisle Police Officer Scott Johnson was running mobile radar on Maysville Road, when he observed Mr. Peters traveling at a high rate of speed and verified this with mobile radar, at 74MPH in a 55MPH zone. Officer Johnson pulled to the shoulder to make a turn and had to wait for vehicles to pass. Mr. Peters made a quick right onto Old Paris Road and accelerated. Officer Johnson activated his emergency equipment and tried to make up the distance. Mr. Peters made it around the curve at Clark Liquor and pulled behind the building. Officer Johnson came around the curve, but didnât see the vehicle, so he did a U-turn, and went back to check the driveways, just prior to the curve, with no luck. Officer Johnson turned back around and then saw Mr. Peters vehicle come back out of the lot at Clark Liquor, and activated his emergency equipment again, and made the stop. Upon contact, Officer Johnson instructed Mr. Peters to step out of the vehicle and placed him in cuffs. Officer Johnson asked Mr. Peters âWhy did you do that?â, and Mr. Peters said he was in a hurry to get his pizza at Easy Riders. Officer Johnson then asked Mr. Peters if he was in such a hurry to get his pizza, why did he pull in there (at Clark Liquor), and Mr. Peters said he wanted a pop, but didnât buy one. Mr. Peters stated that he had heard the officerâs siren, but hoped the officer didnât see him, because he had a warrant. Once Officer Johnson informed Mr. Peters of his charges, Mr. Peters said, âYouâre going to have to call an ambulance,â and fell to the ground saying he was having a heart attack. Mr. Peters was checked and transported by Nicholas County EMS to the Bourbon County ER, where he was medically cleared. Roger Peters was lodged in the Bourbon County Detention Center on a $2,500.00 cash bond and is scheduled to appear in Nicholas County District Court for arraignment on Wednesday, Sept. 4, 2024, at 10:30am. All persons are to be presumed innocent until proven guilty or pleading guilty.\n\n18th Judicial Circuit, Division 1, Chief Circuit Judge Jay Delaney has set a trial date for Cheyeene Clifford, who has been lodged in the Bourbon County Detention Center since June 6, 2023. The trial is set for Dec. 9-13, 2024. Mr. Clifford was arrested for a motor vehicle accident that occurred on June 3, 2023, which took the lives of two young men, 20-year-old Gage Gaunce and 17-year-old Clay Welch, and injured two others, Emily Earlywine and Dylan Saucedo. Mr. Clifford was not injured in the accident. Mr. Cliffordâs lawyer informed Judge Delaney, that âMr. Clifford would like to have his day in court.â He asked the judge about a possible bond reduction, but Judge Delaney said he had already made that decision in May and that the decision would stand. Mr. Clifford has been charged with murder; assault - 1st degree; failure of owner to maintain required insurance - 1st offense; no registration plates; tampering with a witness; operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol â 1st; failure to wear seat belts; and reckless driving. He has a $500,000.00 cash bond. According to the uniform citation for Mr. Clifford, on June 3, 2024, Nicholas County Sheriff Jeff Sidles and Deputy Sheriff Shane Adams responded to an injury accident at 4099 Myers Road. Deputy Sheriff Adams arrived on scene before Sheriff Sidles. Deputy Sheriff Adams advised that a red 2013 Dodge truck, that belonged to Mr. Clifford had run off the road, struck a tree, and then flipped over on its side over an embankment. Deputy Sheriff Adams told Sheriff Sidles that there were two male subjects that had passed away at the scene, and two other victims were being airlifted. Both victims that were airlifted had serious injuries. Mr. Clifford told Deputy Sheriff Adams that he wasnât driving the vehicle, and that another person was driving. Mr. Clifford then asked Deputy Sheriff Adams if he could go to the hospital with his father, and at that time he left. When running the information on the truck, it came back that the tags were expired, and Mr. Clifford was unable to present any proof of insurance. Through investigation it was determined that Mr. Clifford was in fact driving the vehicle at the time of the accident. After obtaining search warrants for medical records, it was determined that Mr. Cliffordâs blood alcohol was well over the limit at .14, nearly double the legal limit of .08. In the two hours before the crash, dispatch received a call about a vehicle driving recklessly, with people hanging out the windows. Carlisle Police located the vehicle, and let Mr. Clifford, who was driving, and the other passengers go, with only a warning, at approximately 9:56pm. It was reported that Mr. Clifford and the others went to the Gyp Joint, located in Pleasant Valley in Nicholas County, where only Mr. Clifford went inside, while the others waited out in the parking lot. Mr. Clifford was eventually kicked out of the bar and was told that everyone âmust immediately leave the premises.â The fatal accident occurred shortly afterwards. Mr. Cliffordâs next scheduled court date is on Oct. 7, 2024, in Nicholas County Circuit Court, for a pre-trial conference.\n\nOn Saturday, July 27, 2024, the Nicholas County Public Library hosted the Waves On Wheels program, through the Newport Aquarium. The Waves On Wheels program brought a stingray from their aquarium, to allow visitors to the library to get an up close and personal look at this wonderful aquatic creature. There was a total of two shows. The first show began at 11am for kids 5 years of age and under, and the second show began at 12pm for kids over 5 years of age. Each show ran approximately 45 minutes. According to Librarian Hannah Albright, âThe Nicholas County Public Library always tries to provide programs that are fun or educational. We understand many of our patrons are of lower income, so we make sure that everything we do is offered for free to the public. We felt the stingray program would be beneficial as many kids might not have the opportunity to go to the aquarium and see them elsewhere. The stingrays were provided by the Newport Aquarium with their Wave on Wheels program. This is where certain animals can be transported for educational purposes. I applied for a scholarship and was accepted, so the library did not have to pay anything for the two program sessions- they were entirely free. The stingray was named Stevie. Besides Stevie, the aquarium employees also brought stingray and shark bones and eggs. They also had toys and giant posters for the discussion as well. We had over 100 people total in attendance, which is amazing for two program sessions on a weekend. The first group was kids 5 and under, as they are at a different level, and can get more restless. Because of this, we wanted them to have their own special time catered to them. The second group was kids over 5, and they were very involved with asking questions and enjoyed learning a lot about stingrays. The kids even got to pet the stingray, at the end! They were very excited about this! After the last session, our FedEx delivery guy showed up- and even he got to pet Stevie! He said it was the highlight of his day.â A fun time was had by all who attended.

Agency Manager Phillip Greene welcomed everyone who attended, which included men, women, and children of all ages, to the event, which included an absolutely delicious meal, consisting of pulled pork BBQ sandwiches, hot dogs, baked beans, chips, and various type of yummy desserts.

Phillip Greene spoke to the crowd about the recent dry spell in the county and mentioned that while KFB has not met their state quota, Nicholas County was the first county in the state to meet its quota. The meeting ended with the election of KFB Directors and Officers, and the giving away of a multitude of door prizes.\n\nA large crowd of spectators, and a plethora of horses and riders, attended a horse show at the Nicholas County Fairgrounds, located at West End Park, Carlisle, Ky., on Saturday, July 27, 2024. The night consisted of lots of fun and fundraising, with the net proceeds benefiting Jacob Hobbs, who is battling Stage 4 colon cancer, and the Hobbs family. The gate admission was only $5 per car/truck, and class #âs 3 â 28 were only $10 per class. The first two classes, Lead Line (any age) and Stick Horse Race, were both free entries. Some of the various classes includedâ¦ Beginner Rider (12 & under), Costume Class (walk only), Toilet Paper Race (which required 2 horses and riders riding side-by-side at different gaits), Ride A Buck Bareback Class, Walking Horse Trail Pleasure, Water Glass Class, Flat Shod Racking, Baby Bottle Class, Spotted Pleasure, Ladies Pleasure, and many more.

According to the uniform citation, Officer Johnson was contacted by a female individual, with a residence on Moorefield Road. She advised Officer Johnson that her mailbox had just been blown up with an explosive, at approximately 1:17am. She advised the officer that she and her husband had found the vehicle at East End gas station, but the vehicle had left before Officer Johnson got there. The female individual identified the vehicle as a Tahoe, being driven by a male person. She advised that Oscar Saucedo had gotten into his car, and was hiding, with his seat laid back. The male person denied having anything to do with the incident, however he and two other kids advised that Mr. Saucedo insisted that he wanted to blow up a mailbox, and that the three individuals all told Mr. Saucedo not to do it. They then drove out Moorfield Road, and Mr. Saucedo got out and put a large firework in the mailbox, destroying it and all the mail inside. Oscar Saucedo was arrested at approximately 2:22am, and transported to the Bourbon County Detention Center. He is scheduled to appear in Nicholas County District Court for arraignment on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, at 10:30am. All persons are to be presumed innocent until proven guilty or pleading guilty.\n\nThe June 2024 Summer Reading Program, held at the Nicholas County Public Library, finished up this past week with special events held at the library, including Pirate Day for the kids and Boba Tasting for the adults on Monday, June 24th, tie dye for the kids and Burnacoâs Tex-Mex food truck on Tuesday, June 25th, a petting zoo for the kids featuring farm animals from Colsonâs Hope Swiss Farm located in Cynthiana, Ky. on Wednesday, June 26th, farm life for the kids on Thursday, June 27th, and an Art Gallery on Friday, June 28th.

Judge-Exec. Steve Hamilton called the meeting to order with roll call, with all magistrates present, sans one. The purpose of the special-called meeting was âfor the purpose of adopting a resolution authorizing the Nicholas County Judge-Executive to sign a promissory note with City National Bank to effect the borrowing of funds for improvements to the nursing home building and other expenses, and to consider other relative issuesâ, which the court agreed to. This resolution will speed up the process for the reopening of the nursing home, by Legacy Health Services, Inc., which also operates the nursing home in Flemingsburg, Ky., as well. Judge-Exec. Hamilton says that Legacy is raring to get the facility back open, but the court has to check off items that need fixing, such as the sprinkler system, the awning, and refrigeration and boiler issues. He does say that the court has always been committed to making the reopening of the nursing home possible, and that it has been a long, drawn-out process, but that there is finally some progress being made, and that they are finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel, and the reopening is on the horizon. He says that there have been some expenses along the way, but that the court was trying to keep the costs down, and making sure that everything has been and is being done correctly. County Attorney Dawn Letcher reiterated that the court has faced some hurdles along the way, that seemed unpassable at times, but they have all worked together and have always been committed to get the facility reopened which will bring nursing home residents and jobs back to Nicholas County. Judge-Exec. Hamilton says that a walkthrough of the facility should be in the next few weeks, and that the reopening of the nursing home is âcloser than we was, and more sooner, rather than later.â He does say that the facility would be hiring in phases and could possibly bring back 50+ jobs to Nicholas County. More announcements regarding the nursing home facility will be forthcoming.\n\nThe June 2024 Summer Reading Program, held at the Nicholas County Public Library, finished up this past week with special events held at the library, including Pirate Day for the kids and Boba Tasting for the adults on Monday, June 24th, tie dye for the kids and Burnacoâs Tex-Mex food truck on Tuesday, June 25th, a petting zoo for the kids featuring farm animals from Colsonâs Hope Swiss Farm located in Cynthiana, Ky. on Wednesday, June 26th, farm life for the kids on Thursday, June 27th, and an Art Gallery on Friday, June 28th.
