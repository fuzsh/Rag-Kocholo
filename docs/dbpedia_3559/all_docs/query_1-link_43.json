Wright, Jr. (born December 22, 1922, Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.â€”died May 6, 2015, Fort Worth) was an American politician and legislator who was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1954 and began representing Texas the following year.

After the war he entered politics as a Democrat and was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1946. He was defeated for reelection after serving one term and subsequently served as mayor of Weatherford, Texas, from 1950 to 1954. He then successfully sought election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1954 and was reelected consecutively 17 times after that. He made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 1961."
