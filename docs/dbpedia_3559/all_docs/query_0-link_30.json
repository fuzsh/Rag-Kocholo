        "text": "Erskine honored its college and seminary graduates May 4, welcoming Dr. Carol M. Swain (pictured above at podium) as commencement speaker. “Graduation means that you will be stepping into the unknown,” Swain said. “You should expect challenges and disappointments, sprinkled with pleasant surprises and unexpected victories.”\n\nSwain said she never expected to embark on an academic career and calls herself “the accidental professor.” She retired in 2017 as Professor of Political Science and Professor of Law at Vanderbilt University. Prior to her work at Vanderbilt, she served on the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University (now the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs). She is a blogger, podcast host, public speaker, media commentator, and the author of nearly a dozen books, including The Adversity of Diversity, Countercultural Living, and Black Eye for America.\n\nGrowing up in poverty, Swain dropped out of school and earned her undergraduate degree as well as advanced degrees after she had become a mother. “Each of us has a call on our life. You should always remember that,” she said.\n\n“I can attest to the fact that life will take you in unexpected directions,” Swain told her audience, but she emphasized that trust in God is of first importance. “God takes you in unexpected directions. He wants us to live our lives with boldness and courage.”\n\nSwain, who experienced a Christian conversion in her forties, said that God “knows our fears about the future.” In her own life, she said, “many of the things that seemed like missed opportunities”—jobs she applied for but did not secure, her unfulfilled desire to become a nurse—worked for her good.\n\nLamenting that “We have become a nation of covenant breakers who are no longer willing to keep commitments,” Swain told the students, “We must strive to keep our commitments to one another,” and asked, “Is your word your bond?”\n\nSwain challenged the members of the graduating class to stand up for Jesus Christ, who is revealed in scripture. “Stand up and become godly leaders who can help bring revival to our nation,” she said. “Now get your degree and go in peace.”\n\nCollege awards announced during the commencement exercises by Dean of the College D. Shane Bradley included the Younts Excellence in Teaching Award, given to Associate Professor of English Dr. Christine Schott.\n\nStudent awards announced by the dean were the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award, given to John Paul Bell, Jr. of Due West, S.C., a summa cum laude graduate who completed a double major in Chemistry and Mathematics with Departmental Honors in Chemistry and a minor in Physics; the Mary Mildred Sullivan Award, given to summa cum laude graduate Sharon Lee George of Spartanburg, S.C., who completed a triple major in History, Psychology, and Bible and Religion, receiving Departmental Honors in all three majors; and the H.M. Young Ring, the highest honor for a member of the senior class, given to Neal Richard Blank of Camden, S.C., a summa cum laude graduate who completed a double major in Psychology and History, with Departmental Honors in Psychology and a minor in Biology.\n\nTwo members of the Erskine College Class of 2024 tied for highest academic average—triple major and Sullivan Award winner Sharon Lee George and Benjamin Clifford Headley of Moreland, Ga., who completed a double major in Bible and Religion and English with Departmental Honors in English and a minor in Information Technology.\n\nSeminary awards were announced by Dean of the Seminary Dr. Seth Nelson. The Bruce G. Pierce Award for Christian Leadership was given to Scott Hultstrand of Houston, Texas, a Master of Divinity degree recipient. The dean also recognized Dr. Loyd D. Melton, whose retirement as John Montgomery Bell Professor of New Testament was announced in February. Melton has been named Distinguished Professor of New Testament Emeritus and will continue to serve the seminary in a part-time capacity.\n\nErskine President Dr. Steve Adamson introduced the commencement speaker, and Board of Trustees Chairman Michael S. Whitehurst greeted the assembled students, faculty members, and guests.\n\nServing as faculty marshals were Dr. George Schwab, crucifer, and Dr. William B. Evans, mace bearer. The Rev. Joshua C. Chiles, chaplain, offered the invocation and Dean of the Seminary Dr. Seth J. Nelson gave the benediction.\n\nThe graduates were inducted into the Erskine Alumni Association by Dr. Sanita Cousar ’77, president, who also announced the senior class gift—two bench swings to be placed near the student recreational volleyball court on campus. Student contributions will also be used for enhancements to the court.\n\nEach graduating student wore a “Stole of Gratitude” during the commencement ceremony. The graduates were urged to give the stole to a family member or to another person who offered them support and encouragement during their college years.\n\nMusic for the event was provided by the Erskine College Choraleers, directed by Dr. Keith Timms and accompanied by Prof. Sharalyn Hicks, pianist, and Erskine College Sinfonia, led by Professor Jon Michael Brock, conductor. James Alexander Thomas, a graduating music major with a minor in biology, led the singing of the alma mater.\n\nSee more Commencement 2024 photos HERE.\n\nThis year’s graduates are listed below:\n\nBachelor of Arts\n\nGraduates, Jan. 11, 2024: Harrison Graham Bernard, Weddington, N.C.; Christen Hope Jordan, Lexington, S.C.; Thomas Simon LaFrancis, Blacksburg, S.C.; Ashley Elizabeth Owens, Williamston, S.C.; Katelyn Marie Suttles, Gray Court, S.C.; DuJwan R.
