        "text": "A Note About Room Numbering\n\nThe three primary House office buildings—Cannon, Longworth and Rayburn—share a room numbering system for above-ground rooms that might confuse visitors at first. The system is fairly straight forward and can be used to identify most member and committee offices merely by knowing the correct room number regardless of building.\n\nAll Cannon above-ground rooms are three digits. As you would expect, the first digit indicates the floor level. For example, 303 Cannon is on the 3rd floor.\n\nAll above-ground Longworth rooms are four digits and start with the number 1. The second digit from the left indicates the floor. For example, 1309 is on the third floor of the Longworth building.\n\nAll above-ground Rayburn rooms are also four digits, but start with a 2. The second digit indicates the floor number. For example, 2125 is on the first floor of Rayburn."
