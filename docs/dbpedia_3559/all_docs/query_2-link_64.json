        "text": "Kay Norton (Ph.D. Musicology, University of Colorado-Boulder 1990) is Professor of Musicology in the School of Music. She researches music’s association with wellness, American sacred music, and music of the American South, and previously held faculty positions at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, and Brenau Women’s College (now University) in Georgia.\n\nNorton’s interest in synthesizing musicology with research in the health sciences is exemplified in Singing and Wellness: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Proof (Routledge, 2016) and “How Music-Inspired Weeping Can Heal” (Journal of Medical Humanities, 2011). She is a Clinical Professor of Medical Humanities in the Creighton University School of Medicine (Phoenix campus), and has presented for international audiences at the Institute of Cognitive Neurology, Buenos Aires, Argentina (2020); International Association for Music and Medicine, Barcelona, Spain (2018); Neurosciences and Music VI, Boston (2017); Exploring the Mind through Music, Rice University (2016); and International Conference on Palliative Care, Montréal (2014). In 2009 and 2010, Norton led an interdisciplinary faculty team in designing an interactive website to provide caregivers with help in offering musical interventions to people who suffer from dementia. She was co-principle investigator in a grant-funded conference which featured collaborations among ASU’s School of Music and College of Nursing faculties, and internationally renowned scientists from outside ASU (2008). With Esther Morgan-Ellis, Norton co-edited the Oxford Handbook for Community Singing (forthcoming May 2024). In 47 chapters, authors exemplify community singing as an interdisciplinary field of study that encompasses diverse methodologies and objects of inquiry, and in the process bring together recent research from the fields that have historically engaged with the practice of group singing, including group dynamics, ethnomusicology, music history, music education, music therapy, community music, church music, music performance, sociology, political science, Latin American and North American studies, media studies, embodied psychology, theology, and philosophy.\n\nAs an Americanist musicologist, Norton's career-long specialization is hymnody, gospel, and sacred song. She is currently working on a contextualized biography of Sallie Martin, Black gospel pioneer (On the Road with Sallie Martin, Mother of Gospel Music, under contract, University of IL press, 2025). Other publications may be found in the Journal of the Society for American Music (2017), American Music (2003), and in festschriften honoring American music scholars Michael J. Budds (2020), John Graziano (2011), J. Bunker Clark (2007), and William K. Kearns (1999). She was lead curator of an interdisciplinary installation, \"Dynamic Journey: Transformations of Slavery-era Spaces, Routes, and Sounds\" (2007). Norton has presented her Americanist research at professional organizations including the Society for American Music (where she was Vice President for two terms), American Musicological Society, American Folklore Society, and the Society for Ethnomusicology.\n\nNorton teaches courses and seminars on Music and the Brain, Gender and Music, Aesthetics of Music, 1920s American Music, and 19th-century Music.\n\nBOOKS\n\n1. *Singing and Wellness: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Proof. Routledge, 2016.\n\n“Norton’s compelling research shows a deeply engaged scholar ably traversing cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives in search of answers to the question of how and why singing affects us so profoundly.” —Sarah Schmalenberger, University of St. Thomas\n\n“Norton’s stimulating book draws on both scientific and humanistic disciplines to explain why humans sing and the effects this has on their nature, culture, and wellbeing. With its emphasis on the promotion of health through song it is set to become essential reading for anyone interested in this topic.”—Penelope Gouk, University of Manchester\n\n“Keeping the singing voice at the center, Singing and Wellbeing: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Proof is diagnostic, prescriptive, historically grounded, philosophically attuned, and beautifully pitched.”—Nina Eidsheim, University of California, Los Angeles\n\n2. *Baptist Offspring, Southern Midwife—Mercer’s Cluster of Spiritual Songs (1810): A Study in American Hymnody. Warren, MI: Harmonie Park Press, 2002.\n\n“[Norton] has systematically measured it, analyzed its components and helped us focus on it in such a waythat it shines surprisingly clearer and brighter for all of us.” Mary Louise VanDyke, Bulletin of the Society for American Music 28, no. 2 (summer 2002): 29.\n\n“While retaining standard hymnological inquiries into biographical, bibliographical, and literary matters, Norton sets those interests in a much wider context that also includes race, class, gender, religious and regional history, and musical resources. . . . That Norton has applied such an agenda to Mercer’s text is an important and salutary development in hymnological studies because it aligns the field more closely with contemporary historical and literary methods.” Stephen A. Marini, Notes, the Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association (June 2003): 884-86.\n\n“Since The Cluster has no music, Norton has created a tune repertory reflective of its musical environment by studying the history of each hymn text and matching them to possible tunes. . . . Kay Norton is to be commended.” Harry Eskew, American Music 23, no. 1 (spring 2005), 108-09.\n\n“Most hymnologists, musicologists, and church musicians never even ask the question about where tunes come from. Kay Norton not only pondered this question but came up with the answer.” C. Edward Spann, Baptist History and Heritage (Summer/Fall 2003): 112-113.\n\n3. *Normand Lockwood: His Life and Music. Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1993.\n\n“A welcome book . . . this may be the only book that will be published on this important, oft neglected composer, and there is much of value in it. Recommended to all large academic libraries and to all libraries supporting a music department.” J. L. Patterson, Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries 31, no. 5 (January 1994).\n\n“Norton has constructed an insightful profile of her subject’s personality as a composer, teacher, and human being . . . perhaps the crowning achievement of Norton’s research is the concluding section which is a catalogue of Lockwood’s complete oeuvre, including pieces that remain in manuscript.” Richard L. Bobo, Sonneck Society Bulletin (former name of the Bulletin of the Society for American Music) 20, no. 2 (summer 1994): 35.\n\nBOOK CHAPTERS\n\n*“How a Hymn Captured a Cherokee Community’s Destiny,” in Music, American Made: Essays in Honor of John Graziano. ed.
