Sharon was born on Oct. 21, 1943 in Sedalia, Mo. She attended Farley Elementary School and Butler High School (class of ’62), both in Huntsville, Ala. After high school, Sharon became a licensed practical nurse and worked in Huntsville Hospital. Majoring in math and minoring in art.

Sharon earned an MBA Degree at Indiana State University, and a Certificate in Accounting at the University of Miami. She returned to The University of Alabama to teach in the College of Business and earn the ABD Degree. Sharon served as a nurse at Huntsville Hospital, Boaz-Albertville Hospital, and the University of Alabama Student Infirmary.

Her last job was that of budget analyst for Kentucky’s Lexington/Fayette Urban County Government for over a decade.\n\nSharon’s love for reading never waned, her favorites being numerous murder mystery authors and all of Jane Austin’s books. In South Carolina, she joined the community service organization - the Charleston Hat Ladies Society, and the Jane Austen society. Sharon embraced life with a passion for ballroom dancing, her favorites including the foxtrot, waltz, west coast swing, rumba, cha-cha, and the Argentine Tango. She also enjoyed table games including hand, knee, and foot; flip six; and especially mah jongg.\n\nButler High classmates wrote in her yearbook: Sharon giggled her way through school. Her classmates wrote in her yearbook: Precious things come in small packages. If you are loved elsewhere as you are here, you will never have to worry. Another wrote Stay as sweet and wonderful as you are and everyone will love you. She did, and they did. Never speaking an ill word to or about anyone, Sharon lived a life of service to her family and others, always putting the needs of others ahead of her own. After the pandemic, her cremains will be buried near her parents and grandpa in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nIn lieu of flowers please consider donations to the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance at the following link: https://give.ocrahope.org/give/186942/#!/donation/checkout?c_src=OCRAweb&c_src2=header"
