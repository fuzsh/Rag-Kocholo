        "text": "In my ongoing exploration of new types of synthetic surfaces for use in my artwork, I am testing a roll of vinyl sold for signage and banners. This particular one is the Insignia brand sold by Breathing Color. The roll is opaque white, 17 inches by 10 feet long, and cost me $20. The description on their website reads, “water resistant smooth opaque flexible PVC banner with a tear-resistant polyester fabric embedded between two white vinyl layers and a non-glare finish.”\n\nI tested a few different art mediums on it, and with a few exceptions, they worked rather well. This sheet is 17×20 inches. I drew on it with different types of dry media, from graphite to charcoal, and different types of paints that I use. You’ll notice in some of these detail shots that the surface, although described as “smooth,” has a slight dot texture on it that reminds me of a half-tone print.\n\nDRY MEDIA: Pencils worked okay. The hard leads all looked the same, but the softer 8B looked darker, as it should. Charcoal and soft pastels surprised me by how well they adhered to this. The soft pastel stick really shows that dot texture, but it’s less noticeable in charcoal. Erasing doesn’t work well due to that texture; although, charcoal almost erased completely. Being able to draw on something this size is very promising.\n\nINK MARKERS: All of these worked very well. The Signo pen has a hard ball point tip so it skips a bit on the texture, but the softer pens like the Premier or Microns went down smoothly.\n\nDIPPING INKS: The only one of these with a problem was the Sumi ink when diluted to a wash where it slightly beaded up on the water-resistant surface. Also, the Sepia shellac ink took a long time to dry in the dark areas. Brush or pen each worked well.\n\nAQUEOUS PAINTS: Here I tried out watercolor, gouache, and casein. Watercolor beads up too much to be useful. Gouache did too, but I discovered if I painted a little gum arabic medium first it adhered better, but still beaded up when diluted. However, when I painted on dried ink from a Prismacolor marker, it didn’t bead up at all. Casein had no problems, and didn’t bead up when diluted, which surprised me.\n\nACRYLIC PAINT: These paints work very well, and dries quickly as you might expect. I applied them right from the tube, and slightly diluted with water. The undiluted layers are very streaky at first, but adding more paint when that dries will make them more opaque. I got a nice bubbly effect in the diluted areas that reminded me of a 1960’s illustration technique, i.e. Bernie Fuchs.\n\nOILS: As with acrylics, oils right from the tube lay down very thin and streaky, but work fine otherwise. On the left side I used odorless mineral spirits to dilute the paint without troubles. The paint will take a long time to dry, more than usual, but the diluted area was dry enough the next day to paint over.\n\nSUMMARY: This is the first time I’ve ever tried using this surface for artwork, so more time will give me more experience. So far, I’m encouraged. It’s very durable, several mediums work very well on it, and I don’t mind the texture. It’s available in very large rolls at a price that beats high quality paper or canvas.\n\nOne of the things that remains to be determined is the best way to present the finished art. How should I mount it? I assume a vinyl adhesive would work, but how well? If the paint were in a thick impasto (something I hardly ever do) it would need to be completely glued to a firm backing, or else it would sag from the weight. Can it be stretched on a frame, or just tacked on the edges somehow? More experiments are ahead on this topic. If anyone reading this has some experience with this material I’d like to hear your thoughts.\n\nI recently picked up a roll of paper that I wanted to test for artwork. The product is called “silicone vapor shield,” which is a silicone coated paper sold as a moisture barrier underlayment for wood floors.\n\nWhat attracted me to this was the size, price, and availability. The roll is @3ft x 72ft. I bought it at a local Home Depot for $16. The silicone is coated on one side, the other side is regular raw paper. I should mention that I have no idea what kind of paper is used, or how the coating might affect the paper long term, so it should be treated as non-archival.\n\nThe above image shows drawing media applied to the raw, uncoated side. It behaves just like regular paper stock, and takes all the different mediums very well. The paper is 6 mil, which is fairly thin, like a printed poster, but the silicone makes it relatively stiff.\n\nAbove I painted on the raw side with watercolor. In the first image I just taped it down, and the thin paper buckled a bit. Later I stretched to to one of my home-made stretcher bars, and it shrank tight as a drum. This will work well with watercolor or gouache.\n\nHere I tested mediums on the back side of the watercolor test I had made. Some mediums worked well on this silicone coating, some didn’t work well at all. The worst were mediums that were very wet, like the gouache or wet inks. Many pencils worked fine, but didn’t get very dark, and the powdery types like pastels or charcoal won’t work at all. Acrylic and oil paint went down okay, but there’s not much adhesion to this surface. The coating also makes wet mediums dry much more slowly.\n\nIn the image on the right you can see how easy it was to scratch through the acrylic and Pitt marker. The acrylic resisted scratching better when I added a medium. The oils beaded up slightly when diluted with oil medium or thinned with solvent, but still coated rather well. I think this would work okay as an undertone layer. I didn’t see any oil or solvent penetrate through to the other side. The initial layer of either acrylic or oil is thin and streaky, less so with more opaque pigments, and subsequent layers on top of that would look normal. Even this beading up still makes an interesting texture that could be useful. Painting over a beaded acrylic layer with oils, or drawing over it with the layout marker could make an nice effect.\n\nIn summary, keeping in mind the caution on treating this as not acid free, I see this as a useful, economical surface for drawing or painting at a fairly large size for paper stock, especially for sketching purposes."
