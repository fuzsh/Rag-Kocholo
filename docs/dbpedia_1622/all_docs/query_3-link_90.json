        "text": "This collection of essays highlights the enduring significance of provenance and its implications for historians and art historians, as well as students and researchers engaged in museum studies. It also offers an opportunity to demonstrate its relevance to other fields of expertise, such as conservation, visual culture studies, aesthetics, authentication, and connoisseurship versus technology as a means of establishing attributions and detecting forgeries. Provenance is still of vital importance to jurisdiction, whether it concerns property law or ownership. It also remains topical because of the ongoing debates over looted art in the 1930s and 1940s and the illicit trade in antiquities conducted from Iraq and Syria by terrorist groups.\n\nThe recent documenta 14 (2017) addressed the question of art theft and war spoliations, taking as its point of departure the case of Cornelius Gurlitt (1932-2014). One can fully embrace the curatorial engagement in revising exclusive Western canons of art history. However, this revision was accomplished by means of objects of colonial appropriation. In such instances, the critical reflexive turn of Western art his­tory upon its canonical self stumbles against the violence of looting and dispos­session often inflicted in the name of scientific ideals and accumulation of knowledge, leading to yet another &quot;story of wheels within wheels&quot;.\n\nAlthough the famous \"Chart,\" created by Alfred Barr in 1936 for the \"Cubism and Abstract Art\" exhibition, has been discussed in terms of how it created a teleological time line for the avant-garde, recent discoveries and revelations concerning the fate of modern art before and during the Second World War mean that is is now possible to ask new questions. In the face of destruction and loss of thousands of works of art, a process that was well underway by 1936 in Germany and Russia, what do we really know of modern art? When the Chart was drawn by Barr, much of the art connected to the movements listed on the grid was already out of public reach. This paper discusses absence and not presence of art and examines the impact of what has been lost upon the idea of the avant-garde."
