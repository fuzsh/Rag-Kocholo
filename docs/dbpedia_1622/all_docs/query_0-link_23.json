JULY, 1923 Page 1 Page 2 ARTS & DECORATION Entrance to the Park 1 __ 1 lEHl Court of Honor FOR SALE TREVANO CASTLE s^gSLi CZAR NICHOLAS II. of All the Russias EMPRESS VICTORIA of Great Britain and India EMPRESS EUGENIE of the Empire of France EMPRESS ELIZABETH of the Empire of Austria and many other equally famous personages have been entertained as guests at TREVANO CASTLE, famous for its beauty and location on the exquisite Lake of Lugano, Switzerland, one of those Baronial Estates that usually remain in families of distinction through many successive generations, but Trevano Castle is a singular exception. Years ago the owner could have sold this estate for over one million dollars, but he did not want to sell. Now, desiring to return to the United States, he offers it at an absurdly low price. {>mm^^ ^^^^REVANO CASTLE was built 51 years ago by a Russian nobleman asso- >r ciated through the Minister of Public Works in the government railway M I development of Russia. The Czar's architect Botta, the famous sculptor S i Vela, and Beranger, landscape gardener of the Paris municipality, were ^^^_^V engaged to design and create the enormous structure and dependencies and park. Over $2,400,000 is said to have been expended. The property measures about 75)/2 acres. Most of it is laid out as a park with varied and rare flora. A grand gateway, a large fountain with statue of Neptune, and long, spacious avenue shaded by tall palms, cedars, araucarias, acacias, camelias. hydrangeas, etc., lead to the entrance court in which stands a magnificent, antique Japanese fountain of three bronze lotus-leaf bowls more than ten feet high. Trevano Castle is partly furnished. It adjoins Lugano and stands on a plateau overlooking Lugano Lake, mountains and city, facing precisely south with an exquisite and vast panorama of Italian and Swiss scenes. From its roof over 14 picturesque villages can be seen to the north. The south facade is ornamented with sculptures by Vela. The Castle, rising from massive stone terraces and wide balustraded flights of steps, has a frontage of 174 feet with a depth of 168 feet. It contains probably the most beautiful Roman atrium ever built, about 100 feet in length, with 68 large columns and heavy traverses of multicolored Macchia Vecchia marble, 286 colonnettes of Bohemian cut glass, bronze lamps, floors of marble mosaics, marble fountain, statue of Venus and Cupid, magnificent double staircase of Carrara, a reproduction of a throne under whose dais here Empresses Victoria of England, Eugenie of France. Elizabeth of Austria, Czar Nicholas II. and others equally famous have sat. The whole atrium is lighted from 3 double glass roofs. Opening from the atrium are a large Vestibule entrance, the Salon d'Honneur, the Salon Imperatrice, prepared years ago for the visit of Empress Eugenie, and the Salon Egyptien; a Billiard Room, Study, Writing-room; the Concert Hall, decorated in white and gold with oil paintings on walls and ceiling, large mirror, pipe organ, 2 Steinway concert grands; the Dining- room with numerous fine walnut carvings of historical heads, walls covered with rare, old embossed leather, carved fireplace, two large carved sideboards and 4 serving tables; and the former Russian Church, now a Gymnasium. From the marble fountain in the center of the atrium, the grand Carrara staircase leads to the solarium (altrium gallery) on the second floor. Opening upon this gallery are 16 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms with hot and cold water, large linen and sewing-room, four large porches on the second floor and 4 on the ground floor, 4 private stairways, 3 tower rooms. There is a modern central hot-water heating system and electric lighting throughout. One wing of the Castle is a complete opera house provided with stage scenery, mechanism and appliances, for the successful production of grand opera. Here Gounod conducted his immortal \"Faust,\" and Glinka's \"Life for the Czar\" was given in the presence of the Czar Nicholas II. The other wing has a large kitchen, store room, servants' dining-room, pantry, ice storehouse, laundry and drying room, 12 servants' rooms and 2 baths, and a splendid wine cellar. The park contains a granite kiosk with balcony giving an extended view over city, mountains and lake to the south; large greenhouse and grotto-fountain of unusual beauty under the south terrace; Roman swimming pool, with dressing-rooms and 2 large statues by Vela. Under the park are 3 grottoes, 340 feet in length, aquariums and numerous water plays. There are several springs on the property, a pond, Swiss chalet, wood-house, milk-house, 5 hothouses, sheep-house, farm barn with stalls for 16 cows, 3 gardeners' houses, stable for 8 horses, garage for several cars, Manager's 22-room residence, etc. Price $500,000 Address J.

Everybody expects it to come true some day. But the idea is so full of the unknown, so imaginary, so adven- turous, so wonderful, that to most people it remains a dream. Make the dream come true. Under the experienced management of the American Express Travel Department a cruise around the world is a very practical possibility — easily arranged, easily financed. It is the most real, the most stimulating, the most luxurious experience of a lifetime. It is so easy to make the dream come true. Consider the coming Cruise of the Cunarder FRANCONIA. Built especially for long distance cruising, and just launched, the FRANCONIA is the last word in modern ship construction. Safe and speedy — a floating palace of luxurious recreation — a fine and comfortable club with every convenience and refinement sug- gested by 80 years of Cunard experience — and with perfect manage- ment and ship discipline at sea. Under charter of the American Express Travel Department, the FRANCONIA sails from New York November 15th — returning March 27th. 30,000 wonder miles leisurely covered in 133 never- to-be-forgotten days. Carefully planned shore excursions from all ports of call included in initial cost. Special inland trips optional. Itinerary includes — Havana, Panama Canal, San Francisco, Hilo, Honolulu, Japan (13 days — Yokohama, Kamakura, Tokyo, Kobe, Kyoto, Nikko, Inland Sea, Miyajima), Shanghai, Hongkong, Manila, Batavia, Singapore, Rangoon, Calcutta, Colombo, Bombay, Port Tewfik, Cairo, Naples, Monaco, Gibraltar — and home. The Franconia Party will be limited. Reservations should be made now. Interest in World Cruising has been so stimulated by the success of last year's American Express' World Cruise that an early closing of bookings is indicated. Make the Dream come true. Write for full details — deck plans and illustrated book of the Cruise. Experienced travel representatives of the American Express will give you every assistance in perfecting your plans.

My feminine stars have all been superb women. Their strangely variant types, Mrs. Leslie Carter, Blanche Bates, Ina Claire, Frances Starr, Lenore Ulrich, Mrs. Fiske, Fay BaJnter, Henrietta Crosman prove the catholicity of my taste in loveliness\" Beauty As I See It The Dean of American Play Producers Stresses the Value of Little Things in Life and Art By DAVID BELASCO V^~^EAUTY is truth! When the ■ W curtain rises upon the premiere H v^^ of a play of mine, and I hear H ^ft that faint sound as of a chorus WL*^^r of sighs, or the ripple of a slight O wind among the trees, I know what it means. Half a century of service to the American stage has taught me the meaning of that half ethereal, half sibilant noise. It falls upon the ear of the tired ar- tist who has given his best, as sweetest music from attentive spheres. It is the expression of approval. That sound from my audience at first sight of the setting, and before an actor has uttered a word, is the seal stamped upon the fidelity of execution. It is a recog- nition of familiar things. It is a salutation to the truth. I am a simple fellow. I like simple things. Life is simple. Truth is simple. This is an age of infatuation with words. A phrase becomes the fashion. It enjoys a brief vogue. It vanishes as a butterfly disappears in the autumn. For example: \"the last analysis.\" Everyone grew weary of that group of words. Someone threatened to kill the next man who David Belasco, in addition to being Dean of American play-producers, is foremost among those of his craft who have consis- tently and intelligently striven to place the modern drama upon a footing with the fine arts. To his meticulous care in the presen- tation of every one of his long line of dramatic successes he has added a sincere regard for the verities and an unflagging in- sistence upon the authenticity of every ob- ject employed in his stage pictures. No one labors so untiringly over the details of a production; none has a richer background of experience plus an artist's sensitiveness to the value of the right thing in the right place. It is no mere figure of speech to call Mr. Belasco \"the wizard of the stage.\" His is the wizardry bom of taking infinite pains; his the soul of the practical (esthete. used it. It was not I, though my fatigue might have expressed itself in that impulsive utterance. We had, then, \"intrigue,\" used as a verb. Then \"gesture,\" that tiresome illusory set of letters! And now \"complex.\" Maddening word! The attempt to fit it with life is oftenest made. Life is not a set of complexes; it is not even complex. Its aims, its duties, its functions are simple. Sim- plicity, which is directness, is a part of truth, therefore a part of beauty. I have been called a realist. I dislike the term. I am a naturalist. The naturalist seeks the beauty in nature and translates it into art. The realist seeks the ugliness of life and stresses it. I have been called a ro- mantic producer. That characterization I accept with a smile, a bow and my hand on my heart. It proclaims me a discoverer of what is. For life pulses with romance. It is all about us. If we do not perceive it our powers of perception are dull. My mother taught me to seek the beauty in the world. In the twilight hour, when her many daily tasks were done, she would lift me to her knee and strain me close to her heart. Held thus, she would tell me sto- ries. We were of a romantic race, she told me. Although she and my father were both English they had come of the Portugese fam- Page 10 ARTS & DECORATION ilies that had fled to England after the Moor- ish invasion. She used to whisper in the twilight stories of the magnificence and the chivalry of the Belascos family. Grandees, she said they were, and throbbing with the charm and beauty of life. She told me that she was the first woman to cross the Isthmus of Panama and that she had crossed its moun- tains on muleback. She recalled the rever- ence of the rude miners in the train, of how after the arrival of herself and my father there was a great flood and that in a room in which the furniture was afloat in the wa- ter I was born. To all of us children to- gether she told the usual fairy stories, but to me, strained there to her heart at twi- light, she narrated the other stories — the true stories. She told me the stories of kings and queens, of the pomp and splendor of their courts, of their loves and sorrows, their misery set in the midst of magnificence. When I was ten years old she asked an aunt for books about the lives of kings and queens. I remember those books. There were four of them; dull, green books, heavy and with closely printed pages, the storehouse of life that abounds. For the humble little boy living on Clara Street, in San Francisco, they unlocked the treasure-chest of the past ; the heart history of the vanished days. My mother was a beautiful woman. I used to think her most beautiful at twilight. Mr. Belusco at the time of his great production of \"Du Barry,\" with Mrs. Leslie Carter in the leading role Her black hair seemed one with the gather- ing night. Her large, dark eyes, were to me as brilliant as the stars. She taught me to watch for the coming of the stars. She told me all of the little she knew of astron- omy. She said that Venus was the tender planet that ruled the hearts of all lovers. She crushed me close to her in one of our twi- light confidences and said \"Davey, look often at the sky. It will keep your soul from sli linking. Don't look anymore than you must at the ugliness of life. Anytime you put your little head out of the wnidow you can see ugly things. You can see disease. You can see poverty. You can see cheats and frauds. You can see a woman beating her child or a man flogging his wife. But these, thank God, are not all of life. Look for the prettiness of life. Promise me to look for it, Davey.\" With wondering eyes upon her face that was turned to the stars, I promised. I have kept that promise. Ever since then I have sought beauty ,and found it. I found it in the pictures and the story of Mary Queen of Scots. She was my first love. I disliked Queen Elizabeth for perse- cuting her. I found excuses for the lovely Queen of Scotland. She had several lovers, yes; she had ordered the death of one of them. But there were good reasons for her actions, I was sure, had one but known them. She was not by nature fickle, not innately cruel. When I came adventuring to New York and was stage director at the Madison Square Teatre, Dr. Mallory, who owned the theatre and was publisher of the \"Church- man,\" invited me to go to Europe as his guest. It was my first trip abroad. The marvel of it! The day after my arrival Dr. Mallory asked me where I wished to go. I answered \"To Westminster Abbey.\" He took me there and left me at the tomb of Mary Queen of Scots. All day I remained David Belasco, at the age of two, in the arms of his mother — a rare photograph greatly prized by the noted dramatist-producer beside that tomb, recalling all I had ever read of her life, its romances and tragedies. I stayed there vivifying her experiences, dramatizing them. I have never been there since. I have not wanted to go. That ex- perience had been complete. Another visit would have been an anti-climax. SEEKING what my beloved mother called \"the prettiness of life\" I have always tried to translate it through stagecraft. I have been a continuous seeker for it. I was not above selling newspapers and blackening shoes to maintain myself in that search. But I lifted my eyes from my task — I caught glimpses of lovely faces seen through car- riage windows. I captured a rose that had fallen from the bosom of a passing beauty, and carried it to the humble Clara Street home as a gift to my mother. I paid a hard- earned quarter for a seat in the gallery of a theatre and reached an eighth heaven of emotion when the hero clasped the heroine to his breast as the final curtain descended. I became a call-boy at the Baldwin The- atre, then a prompter, and then assistant man- ager at fifteen dollars a week. Beautiful womanhood passed in splendid procession be- fore my dazzled eyes. Rose Coghlan came from her reign at Wallack's Theatre, swept me with a withering glance and said: \"Take direction from that boy? I won't.\" But she did, and the haughty beauty and the boy assistant-stage-director became warm friends. She recalled the incident when she played in my production of Deburau last season. Ade- laide Nielson did not resent my youth. She confided in it. She told me the story of her inner conflicts. Some day I may tell that story of pathos and ultimate tragedy, the heart history of a genius. Mary Queen of Scots was the most beautiful woman of his- tory to me. I admired her red hair, her white, white skin, the softness of her eyes. Adelaide Nielson was the most beautiful woman I ever saw. There is no beauty like hers in the world to-day. I am pledged to no type of beauty. 1( my search for beautiful women for my stage productions I seek not beauty of a kind, but kinds of beauty. I may admire a tall woman but not because she is tall. I may admire her symmetry. Her hair may be softly, and naturally, golden. Her hands may be as though modelled in ivory. I may admire a petite woman but not because she is petite. Her eyes may be glorious. Her lips may be finely cut. Her chin may be piquant. I have no fixed standard of feminine beauty. I at- tempt no classification of it. There are as many kinds of women as there are leaves and no two leaves were ever duplicates. No two women were ever exact duplicates, not even twins. The beauty of woman is individual — in her soul, her heart, her mind. The first thing and the last in acting is temperament. There must be heart, heart, heart. Soul is only a glow. The definite tiling is the heart, the capacity to feel. In- telligence is desirable but it is secondary. The merely cerebral actor is never great. On the stage the heart is mightier than the brain. So in seeking beauty for the stage I seek the quality of a warm and tender spirit. The calculating person, the cheat, the fraud, the liar, must go. The stage has no need of them, no use for them, save in the occasional Mr. Belasco's latest portrait, made in his famous studio-workshop at the top of the Belasco Theatre, New York role of misers. I converse with an applicant for an important part in one of my com- panies. As a diver goes into the sea for pearls I explore her heart for its treasures. If she has ideals, whimsical fancies, loyalty and enthusiasm they reflect in her face and I know I have found beauty. Beauty is spiritual and fashions the human form and features through a lifetime. TTLLEN TERRY gave admirable advice to her niece who was going on the stage for the first time. \"God bless you, dear child,\" she whispered with a loving, womanly pat on her shoulder. \"Put something of beauty into everything you do.\" That has been my motto in productions. Once it nearly cost me my life. I under- took to produce a play that had a good idea in it. It was written by a man who had been tried for murder and who had escaped the death penalty. A new trial had been granted him while he was in the death-house. His father and mother came to me with the play he had written. The plea of the mother to do what I could for her son profoundly (Continued on page 60) JULY, 1923 Page 11 Five Unusual Gardens In Massachusetts The quaint, old-timy New England garden of Mrs. George Hawley at North Formal garden, with fountain, on the Isaac Thomas Estate at Ipswich Another designed garden at Ipswich owned by George E. Barnard, Esq. Greek summer-hot ith sculptured balustrade and pool in the grounds of the Misses Hunt at Beverly Farms Old town-pump in the garden of Mrs. James Simpson at Salem Page 12 ARTS & DECORATION A Small Country House of Delightful Design The house is owned by Charles E. Mclnnes, Esq., and is located in Hunting- don Valley, near Philadel- phia. Set in a rolling piece of woodland of about five acres, it has a natural spring in a hollow thirty feet below the crest on which the house stands. This offered an opportunity for developing a bog-garden and a small lake and water - supply station for the house and its units By laying the main build- ing out along the natural contours of the land and using the earth from the excavation to form a ter- race on the hillside above the lake and garden, suffi- cient space was secured at the rear of the property for an interesting group of outbuildings, vegetable gar- den, tennis court, etc., so that the property has two decidedly different and very pleasing aspects Entrance to house showing porch giving upon the road and its wealth of shrubbery Owing to the steep grade of the plot on which this house is erected, it was a matter of debate between the architect and the own- er as to whether the site was available for a resi- dence at all, but, as is so often the case, the obstacle of the grade became one of the most attractive fea- tures of the design The natural setting in which the Mclnnes house is placed glorifies its outlines and proportions. Bowered in trees of heavy leafage and set o with flowering shrubs and a garden rich in color, it is an ideal summer residence It is quite appropriate that the villas of Italy should be cast in the classical mould so indigenous to that land; the chateaux of France stand as a true ex\\ pression of French aspira- tions, but somehow the transplanting of these styles to the American country- side is not convincing, does not ring true The architecture is of the early American type (not Georgian), ex- cepting the entrances upon which no embellishment was attempted, the proportioning of the masses and grouping of the gables and chimneys furnishing the effect desired Tenant house on property ts modified Cotswold cottage effect JULY, 1923 Page 13 The buildings on this property are an example of what may be done with very humble building materials, sueh as are a characteristic feature oj much of the residential work about Philadelphia.

The structure is in harmony with the house proper, and its stucco walls make a perfect back- ground for the flowering shrubs and vines Only a very small gamut of the color scale was used throughout the composition; the soft - weathered gray of the shingled roof, the white textured surface of the walls and the green of the window blinds consti- tute the entire color scheme. Nature, with her harmonizing touch, has proved these sufficient to blend with the natural beauties of which she was so prolific upon this site. It is not a difficult matter for a designer to hold the attention of the observer by the use of costly material or by using gigantic scale in his design, but the architect finds his most discour- aging task in trying to evolve from simple materials and forms that elu- sive atmosphere which means so much to the country house • yi.C<?MD • fL00l.' fLAU Detail of garden entrance, a study in simple forms based on Colonial motifs and enhanced by the boxed firs Spring-house containing the water-pumping ap- paratus for supplying the main house and the other buildings on the estate Most of the stone used in the work was taken out of the cellar excavation, and the boulders and flat stones used for the bog garden and terraces were found upon the place. Of course, this method of building is much less expensive than that employed for country houses in other sections of the country. Highly finished and expensive materials are avoid- ed; in fact, they would be inconsistent with this type of design. But when the results are con- trasted with the style of house in which pressed brick, red tile roofing and muck ornamentation is used, the Philadelphia type of country house does not suffer by comparison The design of this house and its accompanying buildings and their construction is the work of Carl A.

The canvas is to hang in the main salon of the much-dis- cussed \"Leviathan,\" the monster American transatlantic steamship, which formerly was the German liner \"Vaterland.\" The Harding portrait will be placed in the same frame and same position formerly occupied by the ex-Kaiser, a fact which would seem to accent the complete triumph of democracy and the glory of America's part in the World War. Mr. Christy, famous as an illustrator, has proved his right to a high place among our native portraitists in this admirable canvas. The reproduction is made by courtesy of M. Knoedler & Co.

The light comes through mellow glass to reflect from old oak and brass and linger on the color notes An Ideal Elizabethan Decorative Scheme The Chief Factors in a Tastefully Treated Room are Scale, Color and Simplicity By C. J. CHARLES \"\"■T^^^URE primary colors are em- ■ M ployed only by the entirely un- I W sophisticated, who achieve their J^I^__ successful combination instinc- '\"• \"* tively, or by the cultured who have an innate color sense and who have given the matter deep thought and are bold enough to have the courage of their convic- tions. They use them, with form, as part of a definitely thought-out plan to attain a gratify- ing ensemble, as it is chiefly with these that they must produce the effects, create illusions, give apparent height to low walls, turn bare- ness into comfort and make the habitation liveable in the artistic sense. Bright colors are not necessarily gaudy, provided they are combined with regard to their relative values and juxtaposi- tion and, furthermore, they give a permanent satisfaction that can never be counted on with the mix- tures now so prevalent, which though pleasing for a costume of the moment, or the like, are not suited for house decoration, and where found in any quantity are usually the resort of those who have no great knowledge of the subject or genius for evolving a fine color scheme. With these bright colors there is. to my thinking, nothing that blends s6 well as oak ; in addition to this it has subtle color itself and like finely-colored fabrics improves with age. It is effective as a back- ground for any desirable object, whether armour, tapestry, oil painting, engraving or delicate watercolor drawing. Like a Per- sian carpet, one may say that \"it goes with everything.\" It should ahvays be remembered in the decoration of a room, or This is the fifth of the series of articles by experts in interior decoration. The ideas which Charles, of London, here gives to the readers of Arts & Decoration will be found particularly interesting and informative. His reputation on both shores of the Atlantic, based on twenty-five years' experience in decorating in Old English styles, assures the correctness of his judgment and the sound- ness of any work he undertakes. indeed, of any decorative object, that it is far better to err on the side of simplicity than of over-elaboration — that misplaced \"decora- tion\" is \"worse than waste\" and merely an offence to good taste. room-kitchen in the Elizabethan style, with pi against the old oak background which brings the u pleasant harmony Now, the best period of oak is undoubtedly the Elizabethan, when having passed through the rough baronial hall (or hovel) stage when the walls were decorated with the armour in use, trophies of the chase and the women's needlework, when furniture was rare and all too substantial, England was then at a period of high culture and the houses became homes. The rooms were decorated in a style that was graceful and beautiful. The furniture, em- bellishments and fabrics were made and deco- rated by craftsmen, in the truest sense of the word, and their handiwork, though it may be successfully copied or adapted by sympathetic workmen, has never been surpassed. That is the reason why I delight to decorate in this period which for many years I have studied and collected genuine pieces. Thus I now propose to set down my ideal scheme for an Eliza- bethan cottage in this country, where I find the people, if any- thing, more sympathetic to purity of style and possessing individual- ity and refinement, with a keen appreciation for the beautiful, and what is almost as important and closely related to this feeling, they are not so inclined to go on curio hunting expeditions, the result of which will almost invariably de- stroy the most beautiful of rooms. Nowhere is full and unreserved confidence more freely bestowed than in America : this is refreshing and inspiring to the artist and en- courages him to exert his even- effort, with a result that his work represents the very essence of his brain and knowledge. The true artist will not, how- ever, abuse this confidence ; he will study his client so that the result will be eminently pleasing to both.

I do not H know how many of your country \"\"^^L— people are here, for nowadays there is not that distinguishing cut in cos- tume which formerly made us \"spot\" an American across the street. The explana- tion is probably that the women, when they reach this side, proceed to adorn themselves with Paris gowns, while usually the first en- gagement of the men is to visit an English tailor. The great events have been the two courts at Buckingham Palace, attended altogether by some fourteen hundred persons. Presenta- tion at Court is, next to her wedding, the most important event in an English woman's life, for that means she has the entry to the highest society in the world in any country. For weeks before, dressmakers had been busy and the presentees were practising how to make the deepest and most graceful curtsey on being introduced to royalty. It is a very beautiful ceremony, the King and Queen in the throne-room wearing the most gorgeous crown jewels, surrounded by high officers of the state in resplendent uni- form, the men in velvet and knee breeches, and the ladies mostly in white, long-trained gowns, with the Lord Chamberlain proclaim- ing the names of the ladies presented. American women are welcome at Bucking- ham Palace, but there were so many applica- tions for presentation to the King and Queen that a gentle hint had to be given that the number be restrained. At the two Courts, By SIR JOHN FOSTER FRASER European Correspondent for Arts & Decoration however, twenty-five of your country women made their obeisance before the Throne. In each case the presentation was made by Mrs. Post Wheeler, the wife of your Charge a\" Affaires while the Ambassador is holidaying at home. The Post Wheelers live in my village of Chelsea, indeed are quite close neighbors of mine, and no folk in the diplo- matic circle are more popular than they are among Londoners. pERHAPS it was a reciprocal spirit which prompted our new Prime Minister to sug- gest Mr. Austen Chamberlain should succeed Sir Auckland Geddes as Ambassador at Wash- ington, since the United States sends a famous politician to represent it at the court of St. James. Mr. Chamberlain declined because he thought the high dignity of an Ambassador- ship was offered him as a solatium for not being given an important office in the Govern- ment ; and he is not to be smoothed down like that. If Mr. Chamberlain had come your way he would haye been the delight of your comic artists, for he always wears a monocle (sleeps with one it is rumored), just as our comic artists like to picture Yankees wearing thick tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses which strike us as ponderously quaint — as I have noticed your vaudeville audiences shriek with mirth at the silly-ass Englishman always having difficulty with the \"window in his eye.\" Mr. Chamberlain's stepmother was Miss Endicott, of your country, whom his father, the great Joseph Chamberlain, met when he was attending a conference in New York. She is now the wife of Canon Carnegie of St. Margaret's, which is a sort of parish church to the House of Commons ; indeed, Canon Carnegie is chaplain to the House. Most men drift into politics, but Austen Chamberlain was trained from boyhood by his father for a political career. There has always been something of the machine-made politician about him, very capable but rather out of touch with the human world. One of the disadvantages of being the son of a great man is that people constantly say: \"Ah, but Austen isn't the man Joe was.\" Twice he has been within grasp of the Premiership. Years ago when Mr. Balfour retired he would have had it were it not that Mr. Walter Long had champions; so both stood down and Mr. Bonar Law, rather a dark horse, was selected. Now when Mr. Bonar Law retired Mr. Chamberlain had been leader of the House and his party and might have had full claim had he not got into disfavor because of his association with Mr. Lloyd George. So he was pushed aside for Mr. Stanley Baldwin. If Austen feels a little peeved with fate that only shows he is human. ^7\" HEN I hear people say that England has no country clubs, I demand : \"What about Hurlingham and Ranelagh?\" Here are two beautiful estates on the out- skirts of London which are ideal country clubs, beautiful old-fashioned houses with extensive grounds where there are polo matches and tennis and dinner parties, and {Continued on page 49) Page 18 ARTS & DECORATION A Man's Apartment in Simple Taste The rooms pictured here are from the New York apartment of Mr. Frank Madison Dick. The air of richness, comfort and simplicity achieved in the fur- nishing is characteristic of a man's home. The ceiling, walls and woodwork throughout are painted and glazed to a soft ivory tone. The oriental rugs in the living- room and dining-room show subdued and harmonious coloring. With the quite plain walls and furniture, the figures of these rugs are a desirable asset to the deco- rative scheme. (Below) The old Colonial pieces in this bedroom are pleasantly emphasized by the gay English print that is used for the draperies and coverlet. Against the glass of the windows are double sash curtains of fine ecru dotted muslin, exactly matching the wall color. These are cleverly hung so that the lower sash raises its curtain with it when it is pushed up, allow- ing the air unobstructed entrance. (Above) The dining-room is dominated by the Eliza- bethan refectory table. This room is peculiarly free of any suggestion of over-ornamentation. The leading color is a sharp green. This, too, is taken from the linen of the draperies, duplicates of those in the living-room. There are green velvet pads tied in the chair seats which are deeper in shade than the piece of antique green brocade which covers the wall at the back of the console buffet, and adds distinction to the room. The glass curtains of golden-yellow silk gauze, by in- tent and reflection, deepen the tone of the ivory walls, woodwork and ceiling. The background of this linen shows the same shade of yellow, with here and there masses of beige color introduced. There is also green in touches, from jade to grass green, and occasional brilliant lines of lacquer red. Photographs by courtesy of Kimbel & Son (Right) The linen used for draperies in the living- room and dining-room appears again as the covering for some of the chairs and pillows in this room. The fabric shows a fascinating Chinese design which pro- vides the basis for the color treatment throughout. The large davenport is covered in beige velvet, one armchair in jade green and the others in the Chinese linen. Some pieces of brilliant green glass — vases and candy jars — are well-placed in the room, while strong splashes of red point the scheme. The unusual shade of Chinese red appears in the overmantel brocade, and the plain vellum lamp shades are brilliant with it. It is repeated again in the single chair pillow, while the back, sides and shelves of the open bookcase are lac- quered in the same stunning color.

The house is of local stone and half -timber, in modern English style. The stone, which is of granite formation, was taken from the excavation and dressed and fitted on the spot. The general arrangement of the interior consists of an Italian entrance-hall with fireplace, iron stairs and oak panelling to the ceiling. There is a large living-room, oak-panelled, and a living- porch on the Sound side. Opening from the en- trance-hall is a sun-room in Chinese design, with tile floor and fountain, and semi-circular glass bay leading to a slate terrace to the garden beyond. To the left of the entrance-hall is a large dining- room with fireplace, in the Georgian style, off which is an octagonal breakfast-room with case- ment doors leading to a rose garden.

The grouping is most unusual and the mirror fits admirably with the table and is nicely set off by the sidelights with candles for illumination The Mirror Most Ancient of Decorative Accessories Its Origin Goes Back to Primitive Man and is Shrouded in the Twilight of Mythology By MARY HARROD NORTHEND Author of \"Colonial Homes and Their Furnishing,\" \"Historic Homes of New England/' \"Remodeled Farmhouses,\" etc. ^Tf^ OST ancient of all acces ^m I ^^ sories is the mirror, that ml ^B reflecting hit of vanity ^J[ H JW which means so much in ^V^^L— Z^ our daily life, as well as in x^\"\"\" our scheme of decoration. Its origin is shrouded in the twilight of my- thology, and our only real clews are the frag- ments which mother earth and the tombs have rendered back to us, sometimes in a fair state of preservation. We know that glass was made by the Egyptians, yet the only mirrors that have come down to us from them, as well as from all other ancient sources, are of metal, very highly polished, and often containing silver and gold. The first form of the mirror was the hand-glass, and it is the fragments of this that remains to us. We know, however, that metal mirrors were made in sections so arranged in grooves in the wall that they could slide up and down to show the figure at full length. Cleopatra is supposed to have possessed such a mirror, but its magnificence can only he imagined, as no authentic descrip- tion of it is available. Glass mirrors coated with tin have been found in Italy that were used in the days of Pompey, but just when and where silver- backed glass was first employed has never been definitely established. As early as 1373 the Germans had acquired a knowledge of glass mirror work, and in the fifteenth century they invented a curious form of mirror construc- tion called the \"bull's eye.\" In the sixteenth century the Venetians did much business in the manufacture and exporting of glasses with quicksilver backs, and in 1665 the French Government induced twenty of these glass- workers to come to Paris, where in the year 1691 a method of making plate glass was per- fected which made France thereafter the mir- ror market of the world. The history of mirror-making in England might be said to date from 1670. From this time on, rapid strides were made in the man- ufacture of looking-glasses, those of the Queen Anne and Georgian periods being particularly notable. Mirror glass in its very early stages was Very unusual is this walnut-framed mirror which hangs over a walnut bureau in the home of George H. Davis, Esq., of Boston. Note the carved shell ornamentation at top of mirror \"blown\" and beyond the length of three and one-half feet was too thin to serve as mirror*. In case a greater length was desired, it was necessary to add a second piece, and thus the longer glasses of the early eighteenth century were made in two pieces, one overlapping the other, or finished with a molding to hide the intersection. In the latter part of the eighteenth century, Chippendale-made mirrors of great charm were made, and it was during this time that Chinese designs became popular. Later, Hep- plewhite and the Brothers Adam designed mirrors of real worth, the former in shield and oval shapes, usually in pairs. During the earlier part of the Georgian period the revival of the Queen Anne mirror began, and by 1800 the lines of this model were much in evidence. Previous to this, look- ing-glasses were manufactured in large num- bers in this country, and from 1780 to 1790 the famous \"Constitution\" glasses were made. This period also marked the vogue of the quaint Girandoles and Bull's Eyes. Mantel glasses were in great demand throughout the eighteenth century, but more especially after 1760, when both oval and ob- long shapes began to be popular. The cheval- glass, never at any time a common piece of furniture, enjoyed its greatest favor about 1830. Some excellent designs of this type had been previously fashioned by the great English cabinetmakers, notably Sheraton, but compara- tively few have survived in this country. At the present time, mirrors of the better type follow the old designs, so our better grade of modern mirrors are modern only in so far as they are reproductions. Of course we have progressed in the quality of the glass used, and we have varied the designs to suit our needs — notably the combining of small pieces JULY, 1923 Page 23 to form a grouping that fits into framed wall space over a sideboard or other feature — but in framing we have had the good sense to fol- io -v the simple lines and exquisite ornamenta- tiOTis of the old types. The word mirror is interesting, meaning as it does \"to look\" and \"wonderful,\" but the word is no more interesting than the object itself. Until a comparatively recent period, the mirror was regarded as strictly utilitarian with little value attached to its decorative worth. The vogue of antiques swept the en thusiast into research of hitherto unappreciated accessories, including the mirror, and as a con- sequence we learn what a thoroughly decora- tive object it was. The old mirrors had a real place in the furnishings, and when we came to realize what they could be made to do to- day, we set about with characteristic thor- oughness to combine our superior modern re- flecting surfaces with the exquisitely designed frames of the old types. While they still serve the purpose of allowing us to see our- selves as others see us (their first requisite) in addition they have come to play a real part in interior decoration, and thus fulfill their secondary mission \"to reflect\" and incidentally enhance and augment whatever there is of beauty and charm within their range. In the small apartment they are particu- larly effective in that they increase its apparent size. Rightly placed, the mirror endows the small room with a sense of space and light truly remarkable. Observe the work of ex- pert interior decorators in any type of room, and note the importance they attach to the mirror. It enters into every scheme they de- vise, and its placing is not haphazard, but carefully planned to catch and reflect the most attractive part of the room. Adroit mirror usage in the small, rather shadowed hall creates an atmosphere of cheer- fulness. Place within its range a bowl of pretty flowers, apple blossoms, roses, or simple •Jlrden blooms and note the brightening effect that the reflection of their colors creates. From another angle the gay chintz hangings at one of the living-.room windows, glimpsed .through the open door, are repeated in the mirror surface, supplying a vivid touch to the somber wall on which the mirror hangs. The value of a mirror in such a spot cannot be overestimated, so if your hall is a bit shadowy, by all means employ a mirror to give the needed brightening touch. In rooms facing the north, in which the sun refuses to shine during the long winter months, use a mirror in conjunction with touches of orange, or red. No colors bring such a warmth of tone as orange or red, yet they are infrequently employed, because they are so little understood. Let us suppose our choice for effect is orange, our bedroom, and our wall-covering putty tones. Hang the mir- ror above the black chest of drawers which shows as decoration narrow bands of orange. Choose an orange runner for the bureau top, softened at the end with blendings of old blue. Repeat these tints in the curtain hangings, and on the floor lay a two-tone blue rug. Intro- duce a predominance of orange in the chair cushions, and hang within range of the mirror a wall pocket of blue lustre filled with a tangle of orange bittersweet vine. Border the blue bedspreads in orange, and then behold the result ! The vivid orange will be repeated from every angle in the mirror's reflecting surface, bringing the glint of sunlight to add a welcome touch, but its vividness will not be over-emphasized, thanks to the toning influ- ence of the ebony and the softening shadows of blue. The average living-room shows space for two mirrors, if we are fortunate enough to In a room reflecting French periods this delight- fully designed mirror hangs in a well-selected corner over a desk in daily use be able to spare two for this apartment. Over the mantel, the simple oblong mirror in dull gilt frame is a pleasing choice, or if your scheme of decoration calls for a smaller mir- ror in this space, one of the oval mirrors of the Adam type will meet your needs. Between two windows and above a console, a Queen Anne mirror is particularly fine, as is a Co- lonial mirror framed in dull gilt, perhaps showing a decoration of grapes in the paneled space just etched above the glass panel, fin- ished in the same dull gilt, or having an etched glass panel set into a rounded top. If you are fortunate enough to possess an antique mirror, such as a Constitution or Rococo, by all means let your living-room have the benefit of its presence, for either is a choice bit that will add immeasurably to the charm of the ensemble. Fortunately the average living-room in the small house is arranged with proper regard for its size and lighting facilities, hence the need of mirror placing to secure light and space is not important here, though it is worthy of the attention thus bestowed upon them. A good idea is to have some growing things — a few colorful geraniums or a group- ing of flowers in a pretty bowl — within range of the living-room mirror, thus being able to enjoy their loveliness in double measure. The mirror, of course, reflects whatever its range of vision includes, but it seems to reflect with more vigor the glorious beauty of lovely flowers, as though loath to lose the gay com- panionship of their nodding heads. In the dining-room above the console the square mirror of good size is very popular at the present time, or if console tables are used, the small-sized oval mirror, one over each table, is much in vogue. Both these arrange- ments are admirable, especially if their range includes the china cupboard filled with peasant pieces of lustre ware. Another ar- rangement particularly good, if dark tones {Continued on page 63) Girandoles, while ornamental, are useless as looking-glasses because of their convex surface which distorts all reflected objects.

T. Haines-Halsey, Municipal Art Commissioner of the City of New York and a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Crosstnan s work is dis- tinguished for its breadth of handling and its decorative quality. He paints with a full and colorful brush, and his interpretations of the varying moods of nature are infused with the spirit of the poet expressing himself in the medium of oils \"The Approaching Storm.\" In this canvas, Mr. Crossman has caught the dramatic rush of the wind, the advancing batallions of cloud, the terror of darkness which precedes the downpour of rain. The sullen sea, the straining trees, the wind-lashed houses all make for a picture in which the con- flicting elements are the essence of drama. The canvas has the thrill of a battle and the moving simplicity of nature itself in one of her terrible moments \"Fleeting Clouds.\" In sharp contrast to the above is the peace of the sun-flecked valley under a sky of drifting cloud-banks. The haze of a hot summer after- noon is registered in a painter-like manner and the composition is pleasing and provocative of dreams. Among our landscape men, Mr. Crossman has taken his place as a sound and imaginative delineator of the worth-while phases of out-of-door life JULY, 1923 Page 27 A DESIGN BY WILLIAM MORRIS ^PRINTED ON LINEN ERHAPS one of the most influ- ential artists of the latter 19th Century England was William Morris. Together with a group of fellow artists he strove to turn the taste of that day away from the vulgarities of the Second Empire period and its imitations to a more natural and unaffected expression of beauty. To the decorative arts particularly William Morris devoted his attention. His intimate knowledge of the technicalities of weaving and dyeing, in addition to his great ability as a de- signer, enabled him to express on fabrics some of the best of his artistic achievements. This exquisite design printed on linen in several charming color combinations is charac- teristic of William Morris' work. It is exclusive in this country with F. Schumacher & Co.

It is in such a fashionable setting and among the century-old trees of the Bois that gowns like this, delicately wrought and expressing the very essence of the wearer's personality, triumph in their beauty of contour and charm of coloring, portraying the genius of Boue Soeurs.

Its skirt and girdle are of marine taffeta, the corsage and deep paniers of delicately embroidered organdie with border and insertions of fine filet lace The crispness of taffeta as well as its high sheen make it especially attrac- tive when used as a foil for breadths of fairy-like embroidered net and mel- low lace. Colors as intense as marine blue and wood brown, and even som- ber black, assume a summery guise when combined with these airy tex- tures Lingerie Gowns are Supremely Modish In Combination with Taffeta they Figure at the Paris Races -v*m OR a Parisian the latter days of spring, the earlier months of ^^^^_ summer possess a buoyancy, an ^^^ importance peculiarly their own. \\ The races! This single ejacu- lation, and one has given voice ^^V to the activities and aspirations of the life of Paris during that fragrant arc of time which spans the calendar from the vernal equinox to the mid-summer solstice. I can think of no traditional fete which carries with it a more compelling fascination than does this one of the great French capital : the gay progress from the heart of the city to the race-track, the exhilaration of the events as they succeed each other, the groups — now bizarre, now brilliant — strolling within the enclosure, but above all else, the engaging in- sistence with which Parisiennes of distinction have continued to express an elaborate ele- gance in their robes de course, despite the in- clination of the moment which would, if given the bridle, reduce all out-of-door cos- tumes to an athletic austerity — are these not conditions which offer the very essence of en- chantment? It is essentially the creatrix of modes whose consciousness is given over as eaily as March to this momentous happening of the social year. Remembering always that a dinner at Pre Catelan or Armenonville inevitably fol- lows an afternoon at the races, she gives rein to her fancy and offers to her client a cos- tume which shall be no less effective against a background of cascaded fountains, balus- traded terraces and century-old trees than upon the bare expanse of the enclosure. Among the gowns I would suggest for the By MADAME LA BARONNE DETREILLIS al fresco life of a country given to warm sum- mers and smart functions is one which I call \"La France.\" Its slim foundation is of filmy black Chantilly over which I have thrown a floating drapery of mellow embroidered or- gandie and fine filet and which I have bodiced, girdled and aproned in taffeta as in- tensely blue as the stripe of the French tri- color. Add a hat with an upstanding flair of black lace and the wearer will have achieved an altogether perfect costume for a very formal lawn fete or a restaurant dinner, should she happen to find herself in town for a brief interlude. With each succeeding summer I grow more and more convinced of the surpassing charm of filmy fabric (rich with lace and exquisitely fine embroidery) in combination with silk or metallic textures. Crisp lengths of taffeta under the hand of an artist in clothes may be crushed into amazingly smart bows or swirled into draperies of inimitable flair, and then, like a note from a land of flowers and foliage and summer breezes, the designer will add a gauzy apron over-skirt of creamy filet and embroidered net or organdie, with perhaps a touch of heavier guipure. Could anything be more perfect for the festivities of June, July and August? One of my favorite gowns, Ascott, is an es- pecially fortunate development of the idea of lingerie and taffeta in combination. Its foun- dation is a slim, close sheath of taffeta over which is placed a billowing circular overskirt made of alternating panels of brown taffeta and finely embroidered organdie. A broad facing of brown chiffon is placed beneath the deeply indented scallops of the skirt's border, thus giving the effect of a transparent hem. The result is an impression of lightness and airiness altogether ravishing. The floating apron I have left open at the back, while just below the waistline and above the straight, closely fitting foundation skirt I have placed a bow of many loops and ends which is not un- like a bustle of the eighties, nor yet a mam- moth butterfly. And I would add just here, that two vital points should be conceded in the fabrication of a gown of this exquisite type ; the bouffant overskirt must of necessity be slashed from hem to ceinture, at the side or in the back, in order that the clinging underslip may be sensed in all of its svelte smartness, and the garniture of lace and or- gandie must be superlative in design and ex- ecution and applied with a wisdom not short of genius. Elaborate evening gowns as well as after- noon toilettes gain charm from our sheer tis- sues of embroidered organdie and lace. One of our most admired models is a lingerie gown rich with filet and point de lenise posed over an underslip of c'lotH >of gold and sashed with lengths of rose and* blue ribbon embroidered in gold roses. It is costumes such as these that we make for French women of distinction and that are worn by them at the notable events which bring the gay Parisian season to its close ; it is gowns such as these that will, I am con- vinced, have a strong appeal for those Ameri- can women whose lives are passed in sur- roundings of great luxury.

I should be frantically weary of gowns by now, if they meant only these facts of their creation. For I have planned so many miles of stitches! But a gown is much more than that ! To me, it is more than color, line, poetry. Though developing a gown is a glorious feast for the senses, particularly in these recent seasons of riotous color and subtle line. But there is more than that, too. In my eyes, a gown is always a personality. A personality as vivid, as real, as important, as though it were imbued with life. I suppose it is because I make each gown for some specific type of woman. I see her, in my imagination, long before I begin to choose fabrics or to sketch details. I begin to picture her while I study the style tenden- cies of the season, and when I review the early collections of the great Paris houses. She is a woman with certain lasting individuality, but she takes on new foibles, new lights, new graces that partake of the season's mode. I see her, know her — and then I gown her. And by crystallizing in her gowns the tenden- cies and foibles of which she is the essence, I give her reality. From being a creature of my imagination, she becomes a creature of actuality. This woman who I have built of ephemeral elements of fashion, presently I meet upon the Avenues. Then the world says that I have launched a new vogue. But I know that I have created a new feminine personality. For a woman assumes the personality of her costume, if it is a successful gown. No one could transform a woman who was a clod into a woman of spirituality merely by changing her frock. But a skilled designer can do much by subduing, emphasizing and supplementing, to develop new aspects of a woman's charm. But I digress from my party. I looked about my atelier the other afternoon. It was late, almost twilight. The last caller had given her order and gone. The girls who had been showing the new gowns were hanging the lovely things away. For a few moments the room was empty. It is a charming salon, all flattering French gray, with sparkling mirrors and gracious French furniture covered with satin damask of gray and gold. For a few moments, as I lingered there, I pictured it peopled with guests. With beau- tiful women, each one a type. Each one dressed in the gown that I have made for her. It was a party of my new exquisite evening gowns ! There was Traviata, a sophisticated frock of two shades of mauve. The woman who wears it is immaculately groomed, soignee, polished to keenness in her mind and spirit. In the dress, the darker shade of crepe, a true heliotrope, makes the skirt, but the light mauve comes down below the waist-line to meet it. Indeed, in the back, the paler color encroaches half way down the skirt. On the hips the slight fullness is gathered under tiny covered buckles. The corsage is straight and simple, as though two squares of the light crepe Avere caught together on the shoulders. The corners and edges hang in little under- By MADAME HAGUE arm draperies. The corsage blouses softly in front over an undefined waist-line. The back is Bat and straight. Two great wings of the light mauve are attached to the sides of the skirt; they fall in rippling draperies below the hem-line, and just touch the floor on each side, like little shy trains. The two-tone color scheme is carried out in the beaded embroidery. Dark heliotrope beads there are, just a hint darker than the heliotrope of the skirt. And clear crystal beads which reflect and yet lighten the lighter mauve of the corsage. They trail in graceful floral design across the front and Back, clus- tering thickest where the two shades of the color meet on the skirt. In contrast with Traviata is the ingenuous- ness of Emerande, a frock youthful and naive as a debutante. It is a shade of green much deeper than Lanvin's, but with the same cool- ness. The silhouette is straight and young. The simple corsage has rather a high neck- line, and shoulders so wide as almost to sug- gest the tiny cap sleevelets which appear on many of the sport frocks of summer. The corsage is sprinkled at wide intervals with wee nosegays of fine beads, green and crystal. The skirt is of four tiers, straight bands which gather their meager fullness on the left hip. Each tier is edged with a narrow band of fine green and crystal beads sewed in simple geometric pattern, from which hangs a little fringe of bead loops. This fringe, edging the lowest tier, makes the hem-line soft and pretty. Another green frock is named Neptune, for its pale billowy green color and its beads that sparkle like spray. It is for a woman of sooth- ing calm, quiet depths, bigness in her feelings, poise in her movements. At first glance the gown Neptune seems to be of three shades of pale green. But in reality this is an effect created by the infinite artistry with which it is beaded. The gown is an instance of that elegance and simplicity for which the best models of the seasons are remarkable. It has an air of magnificence, but an outline of straightest severity. The costume is built upon a tubelike che- mise frock of light sea-foam green. Over this is a straight beaded tunic which swings open on the left like a wrap-around skirt, showing the plain foundation as one walks. The beading is in a large geometric pattern of elongated hexagons, each enclosing a flower. From the saw-tooth hem-line the beads begin in their darkest shade, crystal of a green just a bit darker than the crepe. Half way up the skirt the beads grow gradually paler and paler green, until on the corsage they are of frosted white like the very crest of a wave. In the front, the beading leaves off in a sharp diagonal line pointing up. to the left shoulder. In the back the pattern continues in a great inverted V with its point at the high neck-line. There is no belt, but on the left hip there is gathered a chou of chiffon of three shades of green. Three loops and three ends hang softly down. The palest end trails over the floor, the next just touches, the dark- est is shorter than the skirt. No gathering of this season is complete without a white evening gown, and so I made Fleur de Lis. It is youthful and flattering, as white is always, but more elaborately beaded than a debutante's frock may be. It is for a young and spirited matron, petite, provocative. It emphasizes her youth with straight, simple lines, flat back and front, round neck accented by a wide bead band, round childish armholes, also beaded. On the hips the slight fullness is gathered on a tiny cord, as infants' clothes are corded. But splashed on the front and back is a great for- mal pattern of embroidery in crystal and pearl and brillant beads! And scattered be- low it, as though they spilled off the central motif, are little fleur de lis of beads. A new gown, Floradora, stands out vividly in the collection. And indeed it would at- tract startled attention everywhere. It shows the bustlelike movement of drapery which will mark the new fall silhouette. And its color and figure are daring. It is for the woman of restless talent, eager, extravagant, vivid with excitement and interest. Floradora is fashioned of floAvered chiffon, great American Beauty roses in their own warm tints, printed on a ground of paler rose flecked with the yellow of sunlight. It is narrow, tight almost, and quaint. On the skirt, below the hips, there is gathered a deep flounce of fine black lace. A wide girdle of the flowered chiffon comes down over the hips to meet this flounce of lace. And the girdle, fastening in the back under a great puffy flowered bow, draws the skirt and the black lace flounce up in the swing of the new-old bustle. The same hint of this autumn silhouette appears in Golden Glow, a lovely frock of corn-yellow crepe Romaine. Golden Glow is engagingly youthful, in spite of its hand- some beaded ornamentation. Over a straight foundation, an apron front ties at the back with a big crisp bow of taffeta ribbon, pull- ing the fullness back, and the hem up, in imi- tation of a bustle. The beads — amber and frosted crystal— are embroidered in a pattern of deep scallops over the corsage and the upper half of the skirt. And then, as though it were a pleasant afterthought, a light sprin- kling of silver-clear crystal beads runs through the pattern from the left shoulder down and across the front. A dark evening gown of lace is always distinguished, and it is eminently useful in these days when Ave flit from one country house to another with just a motor trunk. Instead of the usual black, I have made a broAvn lace frock that is very lovely. The lace is cobweb fine, Avith a delicate shadowy pattern of small flowers. Square Avings of lace make flattering draperies in front of and behind the arms, and flutter on down the skirt below the hem. On the front, at the left side, a splendid ornament sparkles Avith green beads, brilliant as the eyes of a peacock's tail. The ornament consists of a medallion fastened near the waist-line and long lines of beads curving like paradise plumes up to the neck and down to the knees. Oh, mine was a charming party! ^^X^ ft^LA^-£. JULY, 1923 Page 37 ii Why Boat You Get More department stores to advertise in the buses?\" an advertiser asked me the other day. I replied, \"Because I cannot put eight of them in front spaces in full runs when I have only four full runs in the front to deliver.\" Front spaces in the buses have their values as do the side spaces. The price of a front space is $6.00 per bus per month, three times the price of the side spaces ($2.00 a bus a month), each priced in my belief on the basis of the service they render the advertiser. When front spaces are used, it costs an advertiser 57 cents per thousand to reach over 38,000,000 passengers who ride inside the buses in a year. Side space advertisers reach bus passengers at the low cost of 19 cents per thousand. A proprietor of a large department store said to me last week, \"I will buy a front space when you have it, nothing else.\" He may be right, but I cannot see it that way. National advertisers go after volume circulation at the lowest rate per thousand. They use space in the buses and all are on the side. The judgment of Gluett, Peabody & Co., H. J. Heinz, F. H. Bennett Biscuit Co., Gulden Mustard Co., Mineralava, Fain Knitting Mills, G. E. Gonover Go., American Lead Pencil Go., Keys & Lockwood, Knabe Piano Co., A. Bourjois & Co., E. La Montagne's Sons, Mint Products Go., etc., all users of side space in the buses, rather convinces me that the rates for advertising spaces in the front and on the sides are about equalized. There are no front spaces at $1,800 a month open at the present time, but I will have a full run of side spaces to deliver to some advertiser on August 2nd, on the basis of a six months' or longer contract.

PAPE Illustrations by Dorothy Hay — ^^ T hardly surprises us, the rumor which is expressing itself not only through letters and cables from leading writers on fashion, but in _JR^_ those costumes as well which are the most recent output of the greatest cre- ators of feminine modes and luxurious acces- sories. The bizarre, the eccentric have had their day; style is now to be tempered by that reticent cachet which translates it from ag- gressive smartness into pronounced elegance. Skirts grow longer, draperies assume a greater intricacy and dignity, the corsage (always a crucial factor) once more lends itself to accentuation of waist-line and figure. An age of formality is upon us for reasons which the psychologist alone can fathom. The new conservatism is to be observed in color no less than in construction. Women of rarified taste, it is true, entered on the summer season with feet clad in jade or petunia kid, but one sees them now gradually abjuring these gay hues for black or dull wood brown. I know of no more exquisite example of this new tendency in dress than the brocaded sandal shown on this page. The design, chrysanthemums and foliage, is in tones of golden brown against a matching background ; the heel is high and follows an Hispanic outline and the toe just misses being acutely pointed. A small gun-metal buckle fastens the ankle strap and an inch of space between vamp and heel-foxing exposes with discerning good taste just enough of the foot's silken arch. Quite as exquisite is the black suede sandal which balances this smart confection. Its low French heel and rounding toe give it a certain practicality, as does its perpendicular instep strap reaching from toe to ankle band, while the triangular cut-outs at each side add de- cided charm. Again, patent leather offers an inimitable texture from which to build a shoe at once conservative, modish and wearable. I can think of no model better suited to its inter- pretation than the traditional opera slipper of the eighties and nineties, with its high French heel and moderately pointed toe and one single concession to modernity — the ankle- strap. An innovation, or revival, as one chooses to regard it, is the sandal of black velvet with a longitudinal instep strap, encircling ankle- strap and narrow eyelet cut-out at the toe. In less daring days before the war the heel of a velvet slipper was ever a knotty problem. Of- matching velvet it was bound to be clumsy ; of matching satin it lacked distinc- tion. But five years or so of bizarreerie in dress have made possible to the neo-formalism what the old could never have attempted ; hence the black velvet slipper of the coming season will show heels of crimson or scarlet satin or in some instances heels of gold or silver. Lest there be a regret for the voyante bro- cades and extreme designs of the style which is passing, let it be said for the reassurance of Patent leather and black velvet are ideal tex- tures for shoes of conservative construction those who still cling to these more extreme modes that elaboration, although eliminated from shoes and slippers, is ascending into hosiery. Lace stockings, not open-work silk weave but hose of actual dentelle, are to be a charmingly conspicuous feature of the ad- vancing season. These vary greatly in design. The lace may be inserted at the ankle WA instep as an elongated diamond-shaped panel or may be applied from toe to knee as an un- broken strip. In such instances an all-over pattern on a ground of fine mesh is used, while in the interest of variety yet another treat- ment has been devised ; the striking roses and foliage of Spanish lace are cut out and appli- qued to the fine texture of black hosiery on the instep and up the front length to a point just below the knee. With these delicate creations before us we still must remember that the artificer in lace has by no means said her last word, and that as the summer advances stockings of lace will become more and more diaphanous and more surprisingly beautiful. A question naturally suggests itself — will clocks be revived? Possibly; they could be utilized with de- lightful effect in combination with black slip- pers having colored heels or heels of gold or silver. It gratifies my fancy to picture a wedding slipper of white satin, austerely sim- ple, with a silver heel and a white silk stock- ing clocked in silver. There is a peculiar charm in this old-world adornment, and a coquettish piquancy, especially when worn with a rather longish skirt. One of the happiest fancies of the season, however, is to be a gauzy stocking, on the shimmering surface of which an adept in fine needlework will herself embroider a design peculiarly her own — a flight of black and silver dragon-flies, for example. But a wise prophet does not carry his prophecies too far into the future ; suffice it that for mid and late summer extremely sim- ple slippers and very lacy hose are to be the favored foibles of the hour.
