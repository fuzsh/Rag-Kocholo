THE LITERARY WEEK Having been brought up in an old-fashioned school, we were taught to regard all attempts at spelling reform as unscientific, unscholarly and detestable. And yet, when such a scholar as Professor Skeat addresses to such a body as the British Academy a paper which a first glance shows to recommend such an attempt, we feel, even before we have read the pamphlet, that there must be more to be said for the proposal than our traditions and our prejudice have allowed. And to read Professor Skeat’s pamphlet is to learn that it is our present spelling which is unscientific, unscholarly and detestable. Why do we write “ deal ” and ‘‘clean\" when we say \"deel” and “cleen”? Be¬ cause Norman scribes in the reigns of the first two Edwards did not understand the Anglo-Saxon symbol ce. Why do we write “have” and “give” for “ hav ” and *'giv,” and spell the verb \"live ” in the same way as the adjective “ live ” ? Because we are preserving a use that became useless when u ceased to be written for v, and the final e lost its significance. Why do we write “ comfort ” and “ monkey,” when we say “ cumfort ” and “ munkey ” ? Because the later Norman scribes found that um and un were indistinct—as they are apt to be to this day—in manuscript; And when we dub “labor” an American form, we are revealing our ignorance of the state of our spelling of the unaccented syllable “before Columbus was bom.” These are only a few of the stabs which Professor Skeat deals to our pride of scholarship, in a paper which will, at least, deliver the question of spelling reform from the ridicule it has hitherto endured. His point is this: that we cling to the old forms of spelling, without realising how those old forms were pronounced. Written words are mere symbols of sounds. The spoken forms change from gene¬ ration to generation (we have touched on this subject occasionally in these columns); the spellings have, indeed, been changed,in theendeavourtoget a better representation of the sounds intended to be suggested, but mainly before the increase of printing had made the public so familiar with the printed form as to dissociate it from the spoken, and then only in a half-hearted and often ignorant manner. It follows that “ a large number of our words are spelled so as to show how they were formerly pronounced, which at once explains why they are no longer phonetically exact\" Besides being cumbrous and troublesome to learn, causing unnecessary trouble to teachers and tears to children, and sending up the printing-bills of the British Empire, according to Professor Skeat’s calculation, by some thousands of pounds annually, our spelling is, there¬ fore, unscientific and unscholarly. What is the remedy ? According to Professor Skeat, to use our pretty accurate knowledge of how Latin was pronounced in classical times; to pronounce it so ourselves and make our boys pronounce it so, and to adopt the Italian sounds of vowels as our guide in phonetic spelling. That great simplification would result from a well-considered scheme of spelling reform, no one, we believe, has denied, except some few “ hard¬ shell ” objectors who declare that they will be unable to distinguish “ sea ” from “ see,” when they find no diffi¬ culty in distinguishing “see” ( videre ) from “See” (sedes). And, destestable as we shall continue to consider it to have to write “ solv,” “ promis,” “ hed,” “ peepl,” “ feeld ” “looz,” cum,” “labor,” “decalog,” “eg,” “comand” and other hideous forms which Professor Skeat recommends, we are quite aware that their beauty or ugliness is a matter of familiarity (indeed, we rather like “looz,” and “eg” is, at least, no uglier than “egg”); and, in any case, it is better to endure ugliness than to be incorrect. The people who have poured scorn on spelling reform as unscholarly must be the first to adopt a reformed spelling which is proved to be more scholarly than their own. The sentimental objection—that mistakes hallowed by time carry with them a fragrance of association more valuable than mere accuracy—is not one that can out¬ weigh the claims of scholarship and practical use. But the great point—a point on which we have no intention of pronouncing pro or con —is just that; On which side lies true scholarship ? The name of Professor Skeat is a warranty of enormous weight, but—will no champion arise to prove him wrong, and save us our eggs and our heads ? All visitors to Rome know and love the Trinita steps that run up from the Piazza di Spagna; the spot where the flower-sellers and the artists’ models gather to make a brilliant patch of colour against the prevailing red- brown tone of the city. Not all visitors, strange to say, have noticed the tablet on the wall of the house at the bottom of the steps on the right as you look up towards the church; a tablet that records the death in that house on February 23, 1821, of John Keats. The attractions of the spot are so well known that it was a foregone conclu¬ sion that some day some one would try to build a hotel there; and not long ago the house in which Keats died was threatened with demolition for that purpose. A group of British and American men of letters in Rome, at the initiative—to their honour be it recorded—of the American members, intervened to try and save it. English, Roman and American committees were formed, and after keeping their proceedings as quiet as possible lest publicity should send up the price of the house, they have obtained an option of purchase, and nearly half of the £4000 or thereabouts required for the purchase of the house. The scheme is now made public and appeals for further donations are issued. In the New York Times and Saturday Review Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson, the secretary of the American Committee, states that the project comprises the purchase of the house, the perpetual oversight and defence of the graves of Keats, Shelley and their two friends, Joseph Severn, the artist, and Edward John Trelawney, the author of \"Records of Shelley, Byron, and the Author,” who are buried beside them in the cemetery outside the Porta San Paolo; and the establishment in the Keats apparlement of a memorial library, to include editions of Keats and Shelley, bio¬ graphies, criticisms, manuscripts, letters, portraits and so forth. _ The English Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Crewe, includes nearly every distinguished man of letters living; and the project has the hearty approval of the King and the President of the United States and King Victor Emmanuel. Donations should be sent either to Mr. Harold Boulton, Honorary Secretary, 120 Victoria Street, S.W., or to Messrs. Child, 1 Fleet Street, for the account of the Keats-Shelley Memorial. Digitized by LrOOQie 4 THE ACADEMY Jour 7, igo6 A correspondent asks what is the meaning of the phrase occurring on p. 6n of last week’s Academy : “The most illustrious poet who ever was made lawyer.” We hasten to explain that “ lawyer ” should be “ Laureate,” and that the reference is to Tennyson. “ Your encouragement,” wrote Palgrave, ungrammatically, in the Dedication to Tennyson of the “Golden Treasury,\" “given while traversing the wild scenery of Treryn Dinas, led me to begin the work ; and it has been completed under your advice and assistance.” By the time these lines appear the Warwick Pageant will have been visited, described, illustrated and discussed by half Britain and three-quarters of America, and nothing remains to be said about it. It was, from all points of view, completely successful; such a spectacle as has not been seen since the age of Elizabeth, such a concentration of local force on a deed of pietas as has not occurred since the palmy days of the Miracles. It is easy to sneer at “ parish-patriotism \"; it is only irom such pride as this that the larger world-patriotism can find development, and he will never be a good citizen of the world who is not a good citizen of his town or village. With or without the authority of history, Mr. Parker began the story of Warwick with the capture by the Romans of Caradoc; and in doing so he did well from one point of view at least. We are too little interested in these early British heroes—possibly because we ourselves stand to a part of the world in the same relation as Rome once stood to us. People who are old enough to have learned their dates by the now discarded method of memoria technica may remember that: Boadicea, through loss in strife, In sixty-two destroyed her life. Caractacus in nine years more Banged his head against the door. Delight in those immortal lines and an occasional glance at Bonduca on the Thames embankment limit their interest. It is curious to note that the Romans themselves made very little of their conquests and deeds of valour in Britain. In a book recently published by the Manchester University Press, “Melandra Castle,” we find a very interesting paper by Dora Limebeer, M.A., on “Britain in the Roman Poets,” in which are collected all the references. The Romans hated service in Britain. To begin with, it was so far off—in quite another world “ penitus toto divisos orbe . . . Britannos ” says Virgil— and “ alio in orbe . . . Britannos” says a writer even so late as Claudian; sundered from Rome by a sea which was not only a terror in itself but was “ beluosus,” the home of the dread “ ballaena Britannica.” And its inhabitants, as the Roman poets saw them, were blood* thirsty savages, dyed green and blue—a barbarous practice to which Propertius compares the dyed hair of a lady he wishes to insult. It was the Romans who started the fashion of declaring our climate abomin¬ able. Service here meant no glory, no plunder, very little pay, and very hard work making roads and bridges, while the nimble Briton, “hospitibus ferus” as ever, darted about in his coracle, heaving more dangerous things than half-bricks at the stranger. “ Grandeur and wildness of scenery,” writes Miss Lime- beer, “were to most of the Romans merely untidy obstructions to comfort and conquest. . : . And why go to Britain when all that was really pleasant or useful could be enjoyed at Rome? First-rate oysters, for example, and second-rate pearls, and ornamental British chariots for fashionable use. There was British basket work for Roman ladies and hunting dogs for the men. Divisa Britannia mittit Veloces, nostrique orbis venatibus aptos. ” The hunting of their world 1 “Pictured Britons [even in Virgil’s time] were interwoven in the curtains at the theatre, and real Britons really killed each other at the triumphal games of Claudius in a mock attack or an imita¬ tion Camolodunum set up in the field of Mars.” One or two deaths that should not pass unrecorded have occurred since the publication of our last number. M. Albert Sorel, a name too little known in this country, was a historian of great eminence, who only a few weeks before his death had been awarded by the Institute the Osiris prize of one hundred thousand francs. His chief work was the unfinished \"Europe et la Revolution Fran<,aise,” a subject which his minute research and genius for interpretation had placed in a new light, and in which his admirable literary style was shown at its best. Mr. William Day, of Day and Son, the well-known firm of lithographers, will be remembered by some as having made paper money for Kossuth, and being tried with him on a charge of levying war on the Emperor of Austria. The notes were ordered to be destroyed, but a few copies were saved and are treasured by the family. George Augustus Sala was at one time a draughtsman in his office. The name of Mr. Budgett Meakin is not, perhaps, so familiar to readers of the Academy as his writing, which frequently appeared in these columns. An authority on Morocco and the Moors, Mr. Meakin, who was under forty when he died, acted as special correspondent to the Tribune at the Algeciras Conference; and another subject which he had taken up with characteristic enthusiasm was the housing of the poor. His loss will be deeply felt by the British Institute of Social Service, which he helped to found, as well as by a very large number of personal friends. We regret to learn from Budapest that Dr. J oseph Korbsy de Szanto, a distinguished member of the Hungarian Academy of Science and of the Inter¬ national Statistical Institute, and founder and director of the Bureau Communal de Statistique of the city of Budapest, died there on June 24. An interesting and authentic relic of Oliver Goldsmith —the desk chair he used when writing “The Traveller” and \"The Deserted Village\"—is to be offered for sale at Messrs. Sotheby's on Tuesday next. At the time of his death Goldsmith was in debt to his intimate friend, Edmund Bott, who had lent him a considerable sum of money; being thus his principal debtor, he at once took possession of the Doctor’s effects. The library was sold, but this chair was retained by Bott, as being the most ersonal and precious relic of his friend, and taken to his ouse in Christchurch. Its descent through the families of Mowbray and Shaw-Lefevre to its present possessor is known step by step, and documents proving its identity accompany it. _ The question of copyright exists in Roumania as else¬ where. By a law passed in 1862, the rights of an author are safeguarded for his life and the ten years following his death, but by Article 9 of the same law a foreigner, to secure these privileges, must deposit four printed copies of his work in Roumania, and must make a written request for its registration. This article, however, fell into desuetude, and in 1904 it was suppressed. Neverthe¬ less, considerable doubt seems to be felt as to the exact position of a foreign author, more especially as by a law of 1885 Roumanian authors must present three copies of their work to the State with a view to the endowment of public libraries. Two French publishers have brought a test case to the courts, and have obtained a verdict in favour of the exemption of French works from Article 9. But the High Court of Appeal has yet to give its decision. The probabilities are that Roumania will ultimately adhere to the Convention of Berne, in order to put the question of copyright on a satisfactory footing once for all. Digitized by Google JULY 7, 1906 THE ACADEMY 5 The Annual Meeting of the Library Association will be held during the first week in September at Bradford, under the presidency of Sir William H. Bailey. The provisional programme foreshadows papers on important subjects. Village Libraries. Libraries for Secondary Schools, and the Relation of Public Libraries to the Present System of Education are amongst the announcements; and a model “ bindery ” for a library will be exhibited. We are glad to see that, in addition to the exhibition of best books, it is proposed to issue a list of the best books published between January 1905 and March 1906—but why stop at March? Could it not be continued to June? The value of such a list is inestimable, and the more recent it is the greater is its value. The three-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Rem¬ brandt is to be celebrated in Amsterdam by an exhibition of modern Dutch art, including works by Alma-Tadema, Jacob Maris, Mauve, Josef Israels, and others, to which Queen Wilhelmina is lending some very valuable pictures from the Royal collections. On July 15 there will be a celebration at the statue of Rembrandt, and in the evening a torchlight procession in costume to the strains of a hymn sung by an immense choir. At Leyden a statue of Rembrandt is to be unveiled on the site of the house where he was bom, and an exhibition of his pictures and etchings will be opened. If it be true that foreign opinion anticipates the judg¬ ment of posterity, it would seem that the Pre-Raphaelite movement is destined to be misunderstood. To set the world right on this matter Mr. Holman Hunt has written two prolix volumes with which it is to be presumed M. Raymond Laurent has made himself acquainted. This critic, however, in his Introductiond Vetudedupreraphaelisme anglais, contributed to the last two numbers of the Paris review, L’Ermitage, entirely ignores that aspect of Pre- Raphaelitism of which Millais and Holman Hunt were the foremost exponents, and proceeds at considerable length to extract the essence of the movement from the pictures of Rossetti and Burne-Jones and the writings of our nineteenth-century men of letters, who, from Wordsworth to Mr. Bernard Shaw, are all swept into the net of M. Laurent’s “ pr6rapha6lisme anglais.” Setting aside his cardinal blunder in failing to distinguish between the naturalists and the medievalists, between the progressives and the reactionaries of this school, M. Laurent’s analysis of that sentimental archaism which became the Pre- Raphaelitism of Rossetti and his followers is discriminating, if it Jacks novelty. But is he not going a little too far in saying that “ Death, Tears, Love, these are the sentiments found in every Pre-Raphaelite picture, in every Pre- Raphaelite poem ” ? Of the partial nature of his investi¬ gations no better proof is needed than his final summary: “Des anthropomorphistes, grists de r£ve, 4 pris d’6ternit6, las de force et de vie passagere, des resumes de toutun grondement de passion s'apaisant, les dernieres fleurs ipanouies d’un jardin 6puis6, gorg6 de voluptueuses pro¬ ductions: voila les pr^raphaelites.\" Two purchases of national interest were made from Messrs. Christie’s picture-sale on Saturday. On behalf of the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland Messrs. Agnew paid 255 guineas for Sir Joshua Reynolds’s Portrait of Sir John Macpherson, who succeeded Warren Hastings as Governor-General of India; while Mr. Lionel Cust of the National Portrait Gallery, London, secured for 105 guineas the Small Portrait of Edward Gibbon, by H. Walton, which was recently lent by Lord Sheffield to the Oxford Historical Portraits Exhibition. At the same sale two new records were established by the 1150 guineas and 820 guineas given respectively by Mr. Hodgluns for Cosway’s drawing, The Fair Stepmother and Ladies of the Loftus Family, and Downman’s drawing of John Edwin, Comedian, and Mrs. Mary Wells, Actress (nicknamed f* Cowslip ”) in the Play of “ Agreeable Surprises The keenest contest of the day was occasioned by Turner’s The Rape of Europa, which cost Messrs. P. and D. Colnaghi 6400 guineas. If we remember rightly, this sum has only three times been exceeded for a Turner subject, the sale-room record for this master being £8610 given by Messrs. Agnew in 1899 for A View in Venice. Compared with the sums given for works by other great masters, these prices are not extravagant, but it must be remembered that the finest examples of Turner’s art are, with few exceptions, beyond the reach of dealers, and The Rape of Europa, belonging as it does to the period of the recently discovered Turners at the Tate Gallery, is probably the best example that has yet appeared at an auction. It is to be hoped that Mr. Cecil Sharp was not entirely surrounded by his friends and colleagues when he con¬ tinued his folk-song propaganda last week by a concert lecture at A£olian Hall. We recognised a good many such present, but his remarks were really addressed to people who still ask : “ What is folk-song ? ” or, “ What is the good of it ? ” He told them what it is and what is the good of it, and also gave us an amusing picture of his methods of collecting these gems of musical and poetic art, which spring straight from the heart of the people. He sits by the roadside while an old stonebreaker sings to him and covers him with a shower of small stones the while, or he braves the atmosphere of washing-day to gather spoils from an old woman, who can only sing while she is at work. All the genuine folk-song singers are very old, which is in itself sufficient reason for making haste to get their songs upon paper. Very soon the chance will be gone for ever. But Mr. Sharp asks no one to take his word for it that the songs are worth preservation. A number of very beautiful examples were sung and are published in his valuable collections of ‘‘Folk-songs from Somerset.” These go to show that there is, or was, somewhere in the English people a deep-rooted and delicate sense of musical rhythm, which should have matched our great poetry with great music. Certain adverse circumstances prevented its fruition, but no unrhythmic race could have produced such songs as “I’m seventeen come Sunday” or “ Dabbling in the Dew.” But, apart from the musical value of the tunes and the indication in them of musical possibilities as yet unfulfilled by the conscious art of the town musician, the subjects of the songs and the general tone of both words and music indicate, as Mr. Sharp pointed out, racial characteristics for which we do not generally give ourselves, or rather our country cousins, credit. Irrepressible merriment, love-making of a careless and jovial kind, the glorification of a roving life and generally of a “ gay dog ” attitude, with an occasional touch of good-humoured cynicism, are not the qualities usually attributed to the English son of the soil. Yet this is the perpetual tone of English folk-music and folk- poetry, while a strain of deep feeling is not lacking. On the other hand, the sentimentality which extols home-life of “ the arm-chair by the fire ” type, or the patriotism of “The Soldiers of the Queen,” is entirely absent, or, if found, is a sure sign of the invasion of the modern music- hall ballad. It is something to know that we are not the natural inheritors of this disease. The following are among forthcoming events; Messrs. Puttick and Simpson. Friday, July 6.—Sale of Objets d’Art, China, Old Silver, Furniture, etc., including the residue of the property of the late James Staats Forbes. Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge. Thursday, July 5 to Monday July 9 inclusive.—Sale of Books and Manuscript including the library of the late W. Jeeves, the library of Mr. F. S. Stevenson, and a portion of the library of the late Henry Tuke.—Monday and Tuesday, July 9 and 10. Sale of Autograph letters and historical documents, important letters and relics of the Wesley family and the desk chair used by Oliver Goldsmith.—Wednesday, July 11 to Saturday, July 14.

A11 English Epic. Books i.-iii. By Alfred Noyes. (Blackwood, 6s. net.) In his exordium to this poem Mr. Alfred Noyes shows himself well aware of the magnitude of the task he has undertaken. He sees as in a vision England's epic age as a theme “ Worthy the great Homeric roll of song.” In a note he tells us that he hopes to complete ‘‘the unat¬ tempted task” in twelve Books, of which we have an instalment of three in the volume before us. It cannot be said that in this he exaggerates at all. The Elizabethan age ranks as one of the greatest in the history of the world, and, if ever a hero deserved to be immortalised in poetry, that hero was Francis Drake. He, in very truth, won the world for England's domain, and while he was doing so the mother country brought forth “ souls that have swept the spiritual seas.” In the author’s own words: For round the throne of great Elizabeth Verulam, Burleigh, Sidney, Spenser, More, Clustered like stars, rare Jonson like the crown Of Cassiopeia, Marlowe ruddy as Mars, And over all those mighty hearts arose The soul of Shakespeare brooding far and wide Beyond our small horizons, like a light Thrown from a vaster sun that still illumes Tracts which the arc of our increasing day Must still leave undiscovered, unexplored. It will be noticed that Mr. Noyes has chosen blank verse for his medium of expression, and he manages it well. The lines themselves are at once musical and majestic, the epithets are charged with fire and colour and the tale is carried on with splendid energy. It begins in the Council Chamber of Queen Elizabeth. We see the mighty Bess in perplexity. Full of courage, her woman’s heart still inclines to the subtler craft of Burleigh. She knows that Mary of Scotland is waiting for a war with Spain, and that “ France o’er a wall of bleeding Huguenots watched for an hour to strike.” But in the midst of her delibera¬ tion a travel-stained seaman arrives with a tale of torture by the Inquisition. He tells his story in the greatest agitation, but with the fault of too much coherency. In such circumstances we would have expected broken words and elliptical sentences, suggesting rather than telling what he had to tell. Elizabeth arrives at a swift decision: My lords, this is the last cry they shall wring From English lips unheeded : we will have Such remedies for this as all the world Shall tremble at 1 Meanwhile Drake is lying perdu in his London lodging nursing dreams of the Spanish Main. To him comes Walsingham, and eventually Queen Elizabeth sends for the sea-hero. The interview is most successfully described. Queen Elizabeth acts right royally, although at the time her heart was torn with her love for Leicester and the obstacle to it raised by the existence of Amy Robsart. While Drake is waiting, he hears a maid singing to her, even as David sang to Saul. This gives occasion for the introduction of one of the many beautiful lyrics that adorn the poem. We quote the first and last verses of the song: Now the purple night is past, Now the moon more faintly glows, Dawn has through thy casement cast Roses on thy breast, a rose ; Now the kisses are ail done, Now the world awakes anew, Now the charmed hour is gone, Let not love go, too. Kingdoms melt away like snow, Gods are spent like wasting flames, Hardly the new peoples know Their divine thrice-worshipped names 1 At the last great hour of all, When Thou makest all things new, Father, hear Thy children call. Let not love go, too. The conclusion of the interview is that the queen gives Drake a private commission. He is to sail the flag of the pirate and stand alone till the end is reached, but he is promised final support and whatever gold is required. Then we have a hint of the intrigue with which these first Books are largely concerned: But in the room Where Drake had held his converse with the Queen The embroidered arras moved, and a lean face, White with its long eavesdropping upon death. Crept out and peered as a venomous adder peers From out dark ferns, then as the reptile flashes Along a path between two banks of flowers Almost too swift for sight, a stealthy form —One of the fifty spies whom Burleigh pai J— Passed down the gold-gloomed corridor to seek His master, whom among great books he found, Calm, like a mountain brooding o'er the sea. The result is that, when Drake starts for his expedition, he is accompanied by a creature of Burleigh’s, Thomas Doughty, who wins his way to friendship with the great seaman and actswith morethan Mephistophelian treachery. As they enter upon the Channel seas after their departure a very pretty song is introduced as sung by the seamen, of which the following is the last verse : Beyond the light of far Cathay, Beyond all mortal dreams, Beyond the reach of night and day Our Eldorado gleams, Revealing—as the skies unfold— A star without a stain, The Glory of the Gates of Gold Beyond the Spanish Main. Doughty sows dissension among the sailors, who fight like sea-wolves whenever they meet a Spaniard, hut are in¬ vaded by doubt and superstition when they think of the long voyage and its ambiguous ending. Drake's magnifi¬ cent trustfulness in human nature is finely developed, as well as the meanness of the spy by whom he is accom¬ panied. The end comes when Doughty tries tc escape in Drake’s ship, the Golden Hynde, and he is condemned to death. The end is historical. When his sentence is made known Doughty laughs. Doughty laughed out and said, “ Since I must die, Let us have one more hour of comradeship, One hour as old companions. Let us make A feast here, on this island, ere I go Where there is no more feasting.\" So they made A great and solemn banquet as the day Decreased ; and Doughty bade them all unlock Their sea-chests and bring out their rich array. There, by that wondering ocean of the West, In crimson doublets, lined and slashed with gold. In broidered lace and double golden chains Embossed with rubies and great cloudy pearls They feasted, gentleman adventurers, Drinking old malmsey, as the sun sank down. Now Doughty, fronting the rich death of day, And flourishing a silver pouncet-box With many a courtly jest and rare conceit. There as he sat in rich attire, out-braved The rest. Finally Doughty and Drake “ kissed each other, as brothers, on the cheek.” Then Doughty kneeled and Drake beheaded him with the two-edged naked sword. Our criticism on this part of the story is that it is not prepared for by the figure that Doughty cuts previously. A traitor who day by day worms himself into the confidence of his friend with the intent to betray him, whoon several occasions shows the most abject cowardice, and who is neither more nor less than a spy of the worst description, could scarcely have met his end so bravely and gaily. Excepting this one fault, however, there is little but praise to be bestowed on this fine attempt to render in verse what is perhaps the most striking and pregnant epoch in the history of England. Digitized by Google Jul* 7 , tgq/S THE ACADEMY 7 SCHILLER IN ENGLAND Schiller’s Dramas and Poems in England. By Thomas Kea. (Unwin, 3 s. 6d. net.) The greater part of this book is devoted to the dull task of exposing the various degrees of inaccuracy, flatness, and futility which distinguish most of the English versions of works by Schiller. English translators are a notorious race of evil-doers; but was it necessary, in investigating the influence exerted by the German dramatist on our literature, to collect evidence of all the misdemeanours which were committed in his name ? We do not think so, especially as Mr. Rea, in his eager pursuit of the offenders, seems to have overlooked the main point of interest in the matter. In appearance, Schiller is one of the few foreign poets who succeeded in altering the form and spirit of English poetry. During the first quarter of the nineteenth century he had as considerable a following in this country as he afterwards obtained in France. The forty English editions of his works and the seventy-three editions of English versions of his plays and poems are some evidence of this. And there is, besides, Hazlitt's record of the fact that for many years he converted English dramatic literature into a branch of German tragedy. Hazlitt, like Wordsworth, Coleridge and Scott, was among Schiller’s admirers. “ The Robbers,\" Hazlitt said, “ stunned me like a blow. . . . The last interview in Don Carlos, I remember, gave me a deep sense of suffering, and a strong desire after good, which has haunted me ever since.” In spite, however, of this, he did not attach any great literary significance to “ the loud trampling of the German Pegasus on the English stage,” for, after all, he concludes that, if the world were only what it pretended to be, “ such extravagant and prodigious paradoxes would . . . meet with sympathy in no human breast.” And, as a matter of history, “the loud trampling of the German Pegasus on the English stage,” was an event of very little literary significance. For Schiller’s influence on English literature was extra¬ ordinarily ineffectual in comparison with his influence on French literature. Undoubtedly, this influence can be traced as clearly in the plays of Wordsworth and Coleridge as in the dramas and novels of Victor Hugo and his con¬ temporaries; but in the works of the English poets the ideas of the German dramatist are not expressed with a shadow of the power and splendour with which they are set forth in the works of the French poets. In the literature of the French romantic movement these ideas are predominant. From Schiller the playwrights of the new school derived their inspiration, their art, and much of their subject-matter. In the literature of the English romantic movement, however, the influence of the author of The Robbers was a force which tended only to mislead and bring to nought the genius of the best writers. Its effect on Wordsworth is seen in The Borderers-, its effect on Coleridge is seen in Osorio ; its effect on other men is seen in some of the worst tragedies of Maturin, M. G. Lewis, and Sheridan Knowles. In fact, no English work, in which the spirit of Schiller is as potent as it is in Hernani and Les Miserables, is of any great literary value. That is, we think, the main point of interest in the study of Schiller’s influence on English literature. How was it that this influence dulled the genius of Wordsworth, and brightened the genius of Hugo ? The question is one in regard to which it is illuminating to note that on the German poets of the romantic school also the influence of Schiller was slight and ineffectual. None of them followed him, when, after a vain attempt to found a national theatre, he led his Muse back to the Canossa of French classicism. They turned instead for fresh inspira¬ tion to the folk-songs and traditions of their own people, to the impulses of their own minds, and the passions of their own hearts. And so, at last, did the English poets. There they discovered the authentic power of intuition which Schiller lacked. For Schiller’s intellect, as Carlyle acutely remarked, was systematic and scholastic rather than intuitive. In all Schiller's earlier writings, nay, more or less in the whole of his writings [said Carlyle], this comparatively barren elevation appears as a leading characteristic. . . . He dwells on old, conventionally noble themes, never looking abroad over the many-coloured stream of life, to elucidate and ennoble it. . . . The interest turns on pre¬ scribed, old-established matters ; common love-mania, passionate greatness, enthusiasm for liberty and the like. Schiller was, in fact, a poet of the French Revolution, and, in his plays, less a poet, perhaps, than a rhetorician ; as such he naturally appealed more strongly to the French writers who lived on the ideas of that Revolution, than he did to the English and German writers who were seeking for new and deeper sources of poetry. Across the sky, from which Goethe shines tranquil and clear, Schiller, like a meteor, blazed and vanished. THE LIBER STUDIORUM Turner’s Liber Studiorum . By W. G. Rawlinson. Second edition. (Macmillan, 20s. net.) For years, collectors and others interested in Turner’s “Liber Studiorum” have been awaiting the publication of the second edition of Mr. Rawlinson’s catalogue ; and, now it has appeared, all Liber lovers will feel a deep debt of gratitude towards the author for the admirable manner in which he has accomplished his task. The first edition appeared in 1878 ; and since then new facts have been brought to light, new states have been discovered, errors have been detected, modifications have been suggested, and from many sources new material has accumulated to be considered and dealt with. Now, we have the harvest of these many years of watchful work, and are intensely thankful. Mr. Rawlinson is a keen and enthu¬ siastic amateur who has taken up the cause of the Liber with ardent devotion, and the result is no mere compilation, but a work pulsating with vigorous life from beginning to end. Of the Liber Mr. Rawlinson declares : “ 1 believe that to all time it will be regarded as a monu¬ mental work of art, and that it will take rank with the highest productions of the greatest landscape-painter which the world has yet seen.” In the book before us Turner’s “ Liber Studiorum ” is reconstructed, from its inception in October 1806 under the spurring influence of the Rev. Henry Trimmer, as related in an invaluable letter by the clergyman’s daughter Mrs. Clara Wheeler (by the way, Thornbury in his revised edition, 1877, pp. 234, 491, refers to this letter, and to Mrs. Wheeler as a daughter of Mr. Wells, the artist, of Knockholt), right through its history, without a missing link, down to the admirable plates mezzotinted in recent years by Mr. Frank Short, A. R.A. We watch the plates as they are being engraved under the supervision of the great artist, learn the ridiculously small price paid to the engravers, go with the plates to the printer and find how many first-rate impressions can be taken, ascertain the system of publication, listen to the disagreements between Turner and his interpreters and printsellers, are told in how many states the plates appeared and the precise differences between the states, trace into whose hands the best impressions went, and discover where these best im¬ pressions are preserved at the present day. What more could be wished for in such a work ? One thing would have added considerably to the value of the book. The late Henry Blackburn used to insist that the slightest outline sketch conveyed to the mind a more vivid impression of a picture than much printed description; and had Mr. Rawlinson placed such a sketch, even though it had been only the size of a postage stamp, in, say, the place occupied by the initial letter of the first paragraph of each number, he would have added much interest. Then, in turning over the leaves of the book, the collector Digitized by L^ooQie 8 THE ACADEMY July 7, 1906 would grasp the Liber at a glance, for the compositions of the unpublished plates are not familiar to all, while memory may deceive us in regard to others. Let anyone place a postage stamp sideways in the spot indicated and judge for himself. There has been some doubt as to which plate was engraved first. Mr. Rawlinson for several reasons con¬ siders the Bridge and Goats, aquatinted by F. C. Lewis, the premier plate, and cannot accept the “ very ingenious argument” put forward by Mr. C. F. Bell in The Studio winter number of 1903. But, as Mr. Rawlinson accepts Mrs. Wheeler’s letter (pp. xii.-xiii.) as conclusive evidence of the genesis of the whole work during Turner’s visit to her father in October 1806, some weight should be allowed to a statement in the same letter, that “ before he [Turner] left us the first five subjects which form the first number were completed and arranged for publication.” These five plates were all engraved by Charles Turner and \"issued January 20,1807.” The Bridge and Goats bears date “April 23, 1812.” Mr. Rawlinson thinks this engraved date an error, as Turner “ was never an accurate man in such matters ” ; but he does not cite another plate to support this view. So far as we have tested, the catalogue is very accurate; and Mr. Frank Short’s technical help has been of much value. But State ii. of Plate 30 says : “ No dot in * o ’ of ‘ Athol ’ in title ”; and State iii.: \" A dot added in centre of ' o’s ’ of * Scotland ’ and ‘ Athol' in title.” We know a state with a dot in the ‘o’ of ‘Scotland,’ but without one in the ’o’ of ' Athol.’ This state is either not described or is described ambiguously. On p. 192 Mr. Rawlinson tells us: “ Kingston Bank has been engraved in pure mezzotint by Mr. Frank Short, A.R.A.” This plate can hardly be described as “ pure mezzotint,” as we have recently seen two etching state impressions. In a foot-note to p. vii. of the first edition complaint was made of the exhibiting the Liber drawings at the National Gallery. \"Not only are they becoming utterly faded and in other ways deteriorated by continual exposure. . . The drawings are still on public view and the Vaughan bequest has been added to them; but this condemnatory note has been suppressed in the present volume. Does it mean that the author has changed his views ? In the preface Mr. Rawlinson thanks only four helpers, the fourth being described as “ last, but not least.” But during such a number of years, in a work of this kind, many must have contributed information and assistance, and we expected to find at least an omnibus paragraph of thanks for help received. The work is a second edition; but the alterations are so extensive, the additional descriptions of the engravers’ proofs so important and full, and the whole work so thoroughly revised and recast, that it is pra"
