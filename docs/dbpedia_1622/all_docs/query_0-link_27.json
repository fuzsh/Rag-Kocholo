One of the first avant-garde art exhibitions in the Russian Empire, the Link Exhibition of 1908, took place in Kyiv, and Ukrainians participated heavily in all the early displays in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In the pre-war years they worked among avant-gardists in Paris, Munich, St. Petersburg, and Moscow. Early in their careers some of the great innovators of Ukrainian art, such as Volodymyr (Vladimir) Tatlin, Alexander Archipenko, Alexandra Exter, David Burliuk, Ivan Kavaleridze, Vadym Meller, and Mykhailo Boichuk, spent time in Paris, Munich, or Berlin. Burliuk and Meller exhibited with Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) group in Munich in 1912. Influences traveled from East to West, as well as West to East. Exter, for example, participated in the Link Exhibition, then in Paris, where she met Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Apollinaire, along with other artists from Ukraine, such as Archipenko, Nathan Altman, David Shterenberg, and Wladimir (Volodymyr) Baranoff-Rossiné (Baranov) living in the city. Up to the time she finally emigrated to the French capital in 1924, she divided her time between Paris, Moscow and Kyiv. Ukrainian artists made major contributions to the international avantgarde. Kazimir Malevich’s suprematism, Tatlin’s constructivism, Burliuk’s futurism, Archipenko’s cubist sculptures, Exter’s theater art, and Boichuk’s monumentalism or neo-Byzantinism represent only a few examples of their experimentation. Yet, as part of a specifically Ukrainian avant-garde they have been understudied. Even the connections between them have frequently gone unrecognized. This has obscured their contribution as a group to the international movement.\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction: The “Historic” Avant-Garde of 1910–30\n\nThe present volume brings together exploratory essays with the aim of introducing readers to this avant-garde and tracing what in fact was a generational experience that stretched from the pre-war years in Paris and Western European capitals, through the turmoil of 1917–22, to the end of the Soviet 1920s. Throughout the twentieth century the goal of international recognition remained something of an idée fixe for Ukrainians, who often made conscious efforts to bring the country’s unique traditions, sensibility, and worldview to the European cultural high table. Ironically, this goal was perhaps most successfully accomplished by the century’s first and, one might argue, least self-conscious generation, the avant-garde. It was in many respects the most closely integrated into Western European culture. Today the achievements of individual artists have been recognized in many cases, but the Ukrainian dimension to their legacy has not. Somewhat paradoxically, celebrated artists from Ukraine seldom have their roots and sense of identity acknowledged. This aspect of the interpretative matrix is not applied to them—neither, for example, to Burliuk and Malevich, who identified themselves as Ukrainians, nor to Sonia Delauney, Exter, Archipenko, and Tatlin, who linked their work to a Ukrainian inspiration. The essays that follow explore the meaning of such self-identification in specific cases and the distinct accent these artists brought to international art. Five of the essays have been modified and updated from earlier publications. The first half of the book records the emergence of artistic schools and styles, and the attempt by artists to deal with urgent political and cultural issues. Several essays deal with the cultural and political background in the 1920s. They indicate that the experience of the avant-garde in Ukraine was not the same as in Russia, a fact deliberately ignored in Soviet times and one that has so far attracted insufficient attention among Western researchers. The “Cultural Renaissance” of the 1920s in Soviet Ukraine, the Jewish artistic revival in the country during this decade, the final hurrah of the avant-garde in Kharkiv in the years 1928 to 1930, when experimentation had already been closed down in Moscow and Leningrad—all of this created a situation different from the one that existed in Russia. After contact with the West was broken off at the end of the twenties, Ukrainians were only allowed to participate in “all-Soviet” exhibitions and any attribution of particularism to their work was most commonly defined as “bourgeois nationalism.” Research into the avant-garde and a fuller understanding of this period only became possible when in the 1990s exhibitions were mounted and new materials became available following the opening of Ukrainian archives.\n\nIntroduction: The “Historic” Avant-Garde of 1910–30\n\nThe second half of the book focuses on five individuals: David Burliuk, Kazimir Malevich, Vadym Meller, Ivan Kavaleridze, and Dziga Vertov. These essays challenge some long-established views, arguing, for example, that the Ukrainian context throws light on crucial aspects in the lives and work of these figures. Each individual artist presents particular problems of interpretation, but by situating their work within an analysis of personal biography and cultural context, the essays aim to provide a better understanding of artistic achievement. The focus is mainly on the development of visual arts: painting (Burliuk, Malevich), propaganda posters (Boichuk), theater art (Meller), sculpture (Kavaleridze), and film (Vertov) are examined. Most of these artists experimented with different media. Some, such as Burliuk and Kavaleridze, were also writers, a fact only tangentially discussed in this volume. The achievements of this generation were remarkable—all the more so, it could be argued, because they were accomplished in a time of rapid cultural transformation and political upheaval. Today this legacy resonates with many contemporaries, particularly in Ukraine, where the avant-garde plays a prominent role in debates around cultural memory. The tensions that have surfaced in these debates indicate the importance of understanding the experience of the great innovators who worked in the early twentieth century. This book examines both the nexus between art and politics and the lives and works of some brilliant and still controversial figures. The search of these avant-gardists for self-awareness and a new modern identity still provides many valuable lessons for contemporaries.\n\nxiii\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–301 Modernism emerged at the end of the nineteenth century as an international movement in the arts that emphasized the idea of a radical break with the past and the possibility of a transformed world. Rejecting realism and naturalism, it searched for new literary and artistic forms, often under the influence of photography, cinema, new technologies, and recent discoveries in the sciences. Pre-1914 European modernism is today often associated with the movements of impressionism, symbolism, cubism, and abstractionism. The second wave of modernism, which spanned the years 1914 to 1930, is linked with futurism, constructivism, expressionism, and surrealism, and is also commonly identified with the avant-garde, largely because many of its members were strongly influenced by the rise of radical politics, and sometimes saw themselves as a culturally advanced party preparing the way for revolutionary change. Boris Groys has argued that the Russian avant-garde was implicated in the totalitarian politics of the twenties and thirties by virtue of its desire to restructure the world “according to a unitary artistic plan” (Groys 1992, 21). However, radical ways of seeing were as often as not rejected by the Bolshevik Party and its acolytes, particularly after they achieved power. The Ukrainian avant-garde in particular cannot be unambiguously identified with the Bolshevik Revolution. It preceded this revolution, frequently challenged it, and was ultimately destroyed by it. The propagandistic aspects of the Soviet avant-garde, which became dominant, even overwhelmingly so, in the late twenties, have attracted 1 This chapter is adapted from an article that appeared on the Zorya Fine Art website in 2005: http://www.zoryafineart.com/publications/view/11.\n\n4\n\nForging the European Connection\n\ndisproportionate attention among many scholars, who frequently allowed this political and ideological focus to overshadow other innovations. When the West rediscovered the “Eastern” avant-garde in the last decades of the twentieth century, the primary focus was often on its visionary politics and achievements in abstract art. But this movement in the arts was always a complex phenomenon, full of competing crosscurrents. In the 1990s, as new information long suppressed under Soviet rule surfaced, it became clear that the “Eastern” avant-garde not only differed significantly from the “Western,” but was more differentiated internally than had been assumed. Numerous exhibitions at this time explored the different national backgrounds of avant-gardists.2 Pre-war Paris was visited by numerous artists from Ukraine. Among them were Alexander Archipenko, Alexandra Exter, Mykhailo Boichuk, David Burliuk, Wladimir Baranoff-Rossiné (Baranov), Sofiia Levytska (Sonia Lewitska), Abram Manevych, Yosyp Chaikov (Joseph Tchaikov), Vladimir (Volodymyr) Tatlin, and Vadym Meller. They joined prominent older modernists already living there, such as Oleksandr Murashko, Lev Kramarenko, Mykola Burachek, and Ivan Trush.3 It was common at the time for students from Ukraine to be sent to France and Germany as part of their education. In fact, from 1908 to 1914 there were so many Ukrainian artists in the city that they had their own club called the “Cercle des Ukrainiens à Paris” situated in the Latin Quarter at rue Thouin 14, which housed a library with periodicals from Ukraine. Archipenko was an active member, sang in the choir and conducted tours of Paris salons (Popovych 1977, 14).4 Travel appears to have been relatively easy. Ivan Kavaleridze has recalled how simple it was to obtain a visa in Kyiv. After producing his passport and ten roubles, he picked up his visa the following day, purchased a train ticket for thirty-two roubles and sixty kopecks and caught the train (Kavaleridze 2017a, 102–3). From Western Ukraine, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, travel was even more straightforward. Although the First World War and the 1917 Revolution in the Russian Empire sealed borders and restricted movement, some artists, such as Oleksander Hryshchenko 2 These exhibitions are mentioned in chapter 11. For post-Soviet reassessments of the avant-garde by Russian scholars see Krusanov 1996, 2003, Petrova 2001. For fresh approaches by Western scholars see Antonova and Merkert 1996, Rowell and Wye 2002. For the best recent volume on Ukrainian artists in Paris see Susak 2010. 3 For a list of 250 Ukrainian artists in Paris see Susak 2010, 361–90. She writes that in 1910, there were 120 members in the Hromada, the colony of émigré Ukrainian artists in Paris (48). 4 On Archipenko’s years in Paris see Susak 2010, 67–73.\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\n(Alexis Gritchenko, Grischenko) and Mykhailo Andriienko-Nechytailo (Michel Andreenko), still found their way to Paris.5 Some figures were only briefly in the West, but still made a large impact on the international avant-garde. Tatlin visited Berlin and Paris. His mother was Ukrainian and he was known for wearing an embroidered Ukrainian shirt, singing dumas and other ancient songs, and even constructing banduras. In 1913 he found himself in Germany with an orchestra of Ukrainian bandura players, pretending to be a blind musician.6 Apparently the Kaiser himself expressed an interest in his playing and singing. Later in France, Picasso was reportedly thrilled by his performance and invited the player to his studio. Here the blind man opened his eyes in enthusiastic appreciation of Picasso’s art. In spite of Tatlin’s offer to be an assistant (washing brushes, preparing canvases), Picasso is said to have shown him the door (Bazhan 2004, 77). Since Archipenko was creating his early constructivist forms in Paris at the time, it is likely that Tatlin saw them. After returning from Paris, he began to make his own, now famous counter-reliefs in 1914 and 1915. Other cities, such as Munich, Berlin and Geneva, also attracted artists, among them Meller, Burliuk and Archipenko. After 1922, the work of Tatlin, Malevich and Exter became known in Germany, where it had a strong resonance. Malevich was in Berlin in 1927, and Boichuk visited the Bauhaus in 1926 and 1927. The latter’s Mezhyhiria Art and Ceramics Institute, created in 1928, was partly modeled after the German art school.7 Numerous artists from Lviv in Western Ukraine also worked in Archipenko’s Berlin studio in the early twenties before moving on to Paris, although the strongest contingent of artists was always in the French capital. Conceptualization of the Ukrainian avant-garde has been hampered by the fact that it has often been subsumed under the term “Russian.” For some artists this might be an adequate characterization, especially for those who were originally from Ukraine, spent time in Western Europe before the First World War, but then lived most of their creative lives in Moscow or St. Petersburg (Petrograd/Leningrad). Among them one might count Aleksandr (Oleksandr) Shevchenko, who was born in Kharkiv, 5 On the Parisian life of Hryshchenko and Andriienko see Susak 2016, 98–105, 112–19. 6 The bandura is Ukraine’s national instrument. It became popular in the sixteenth century, when wandering minstrels used it to accompany the singing of epic ballads. The instrument has between thirty-two and fifty-five strings and combines features of the lute and harp. 7 The Mezhyhiria Art and Ceramics School was founded in 1921 and 1922. It was renamed the Mezhyhiria Art and Ceramics Technicum in 1923, the Mezhyhiria Art and Ceramics Institute in 1928, and the Ukrainian Technological Institute of Ceramics and Glass in 1931.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nand then worked at Eugene Carrière’s studio and the Académie Julian in Paris (1905–6); Nathan Altman, who was born in Vinnytsia, studied under Kiriak Kostandi at the Odesa School of Art, and was in Paris on two occasions (1911–12 and 1928–35); and David Shterenberg, who was born in Zhytomyr, studied in a private studio in Odesa (1905) and then in the École des Beaux-Arts, the Vitty studio in Paris (1906–12) and Fernand Léger’s studio, exhibiting in various Paris salons before moving to Russia. However, the identity issue is a complex one. Interaction among Ukrainian artists, even when they lived in one of the two Russian capitals, was often intense, and their links with colleagues in Ukraine frequently remained strong. Shevchenko’s close collaboration with Hryshchenko (Gritchenko) in Moscow is one such case. Aware of these difficulties, art historians have sometimes identified these artists as members of both the Russian and Ukrainian avant-gardes. Another complication is the fact that many artists from Ukraine were of Jewish origin. Often their careers began in Kyiv and then moved, sometimes via Paris or German cities, to Moscow.8 They, of course, brought their own perspective to the rich interaction that produced avant-garde experimentation. As a result, many figures simultaneously belonged to, and are claimed by, the Ukrainian, Russian, Jewish, and Western European avant-gardes. Nonetheless, it is clear that a number of the most prominent figures in this European avant-garde not only came from Ukraine but drew attention to this fact. Such a self-identification was made by Burliuk and Malevich. The work of a number of others, among them Sonia Delauney, Archipenko, Exter and Tatlin, can be linked to a Ukrainian inspiration. This raises some rarely examined questions. How was their work in Europe and interaction with Western artists influenced by their origins? Are there common features among avant-garde artists who came from Ukraine? As members of Western European, Russian or other avant-garde circles, to what extent were these artists also part of the Ukrainian avant-garde movement, one with its own distinct traits and sensibility? Even a cursory examination of the artists’ biographies reveals a startling amount of travel, which, of course, facilitated the exchange of creative ideas. Discussions of the “Eastern” avant-garde have usually conceptualized influences as flowing from West (Paris, Munich, Berlin, Vienna) to East, although this view has always been challenged.9 It is now more widely 8 On Jewish artists from Ukraine who worked in Paris see Susak 2010, 122–53. 9 During the third trip of his Kamernyi Teatr to Germany in 1930, the Moscow theater director Aleksandr (Oleksandr) Tairov, who was born in Ukraine, declared that the “influence is from East to West and not the opposite” (quoted in Koliazin 1996, 174).\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\naccepted that influences in the pre- and post-war years also ran from East to West. However, artists from Ukraine also traveled in large numbers north, to the two Russian capitals. Since the focus of art historians and critics has generally been on events in these cities, they have invariably conceptualized the flow of influences as traveling exclusively from North (St. Petersburg and Moscow) to South.10 The reality here is also more complex. A pioneering, democratizing, anti-establishment impetus originated in the “South” in part as the expression of a marginalized identity. This suggests that a better conceptualization of “traffic patterns” is required, one that would allow developments in Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Chornianka (Chernianka), and other nodal points to be seen in a context that accounts for the Ukrainian dimension. A brief look at the career of Exter, for example, demonstrates the important role played by the creative ferment in Kyiv.\n\nExter Exter appeared regularly in Paris after completing the Kyiv Art School in 1906. She studied in Carlo Delvall’s studio in the Académie de la GrandeChaumière in Paris (1909), and contributed to the earliest avant-garde exhibitions in the Russian Empire, including the Link (Zveno or Lanka) Exhibition in Kyiv (1908). Through Serhii Yastrebtsov, with whom she had entered the Kyiv Art School and who wrote French poetry under the pseudonym Serge Ferat, she was introduced to Guillaume Apollinaire’s circle. Joining forces with Picasso, Braque and Léger, she began exploring cubism. In 1911 she met Sonia Delauney and was affected by the latter’s chromatic futurism. From Paris Exter then brought back to Kyiv works for Oleksandr Bohomazov, the Burliuk brothers, and others to see. In 1914 she produced the first monograph on Picasso. The interaction of the Kyiv futurists (especially of Exter, Bohomazov and Burliuk) generated some of the first avant-garde activities within the 10 Krusanov speaks of the “advance of the left into the provinces” but also admits that between January 1915 and February 1917 there were over ninety various futurist events outside Moscow and Petersburg and about sixty in the two cities (Krusanov 2003, book 2, 9). His book is constructed as a study of the dissemination of futurist ideas from the two capitals to the provinces and shows no interest in local or indigenous agency, even though he admits that from October 1917 until the Spring of 1922 Ukraine, Crimea and Southern Russia were cut off from “the center of the country” (Krusanov, 75). When he does turn to Ukraine, he focuses heavily on the activities of Russians and Russian-language publications, even though their activities in the twenties were marginal as compared to those of the Ukrainians.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nRussian Empire. All three were influential in teaching and publicizing the new art. They first presented themselves in the November 1908 Link Exhibition in Kyiv, where the main contributors were David and Vladimir (Volodymyr) Burliuk, Bohomazov, Exter, and Baranoff-Rossiné (Baranov). They again exhibited together in Kyiv in 1914 at the Ring (Russian: Koltso, Ukrainian: Kiltse) Exhibition. Artists from Russia also participated in these exhibitions and the Kyivans exhibited in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but during the years of war and revolutionary upheaval (1914–22), when Kyiv was cut off from both Western Europe and Russia, a strong indigenous avant-garde appeared. During these years an intimate awareness of Western artistic developments allowed Exter to create a unique style in both painting and set design. Beginning in 1918 Exter and Vadym Meller designed costumes for Bronislava Nijinska’s dance studio and a number of theaters in Kyiv and Moscow. Exter taught at her own studio in Kyiv (1918– 20), then at the Higher Art and Technical Studios in Moscow (1921–22) before emigrating to Paris in 1924, where she opened another personal studio. She also exhibited at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes and taught at Fernand Léger’s Académie d’Art Moderne. Her influence was also exerted indirectly through the work of numerous outstanding painters and stage designers whom she trained. They included numerous Jewish artists: Nisson Shifrin, Isaak Rabinovich, Isaak Rabichev, Boris (Borys) Aronson, Solomon Nikritin, and Aleksandr (Oleksandr) Tyshler. Exter’s international reputation was secured by her permanent move to Paris, where she was able to spread an “Eastern” influence. She blended cubism, constructivism, and primitivism in her theater designs, costumes, and art. It is less well known that in Kyiv she supported “naïve” artists, usually women artisans from villages who produced embroidered scarves and towels or woven rugs. Her interest in brightly colored folk murals, embroideries, and Easter eggs was stimulated in Kyiv, where she prepared posters for an exhibition entitled “The Folk Art of Bukovyna and Galicia,” which opened on April 16, 1917, and where on March 31, 1918, at the opening of an exhibition devoted to the decorative works of Yevheniia Prybylska and Hanna Sobachko, she gave a talk describing the colors and rhythms of decorative folk art, linking the popular love of color in “young” Slavic nations to ancient icons (Exter 1990, 18). In post-war years the Ukrainian influence in Paris was strengthened by the arrival of immigrants, who brought an awareness of the distinctive work produced in Kyiv by Exter, Meller, Bohomazov, Issakhar-Ber Rybak, and their circle.\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\nGeneralizing, one could say that Ukrainian artists in both Kyiv and Paris made important contributions to the international avant-garde in two areas. Firstly, they rekindled the already existing interest in primitivism, filtering it through an awareness of their own folk art and icon. Secondly, they infused the avant-garde with a love of color, texture and movement. Exter and Sonia Delauney (who was originally from Ukraine) are credited with transforming the muted grays and browns of Western cubism by introducing bright colors into modern design.11 Although initially criticized by Léger for her exuberant use of color, Exter insisted that this was the “Eastern” contribution to cubism. Archipenko was one of the first artists to color sculptures. After the war, Hryshchenko (Gritchenko), BaranoffRossiné and Andriienko-Nechytailo (Andreenko) augmented the influence of these “Eastern” colorists.\n\nArchipenko Primitivism stimulated interest in ancient art and monumental forms, the study of which enabled Archipenko to make an international reputation as a sculptor. His paternal grandfather had been an icon painter, and his father was an inventor and professor of engineering at the University of Kyiv. At an early age the artist became interested in the relationship between mathematics and art, as well as in Byzantine art. He studied at the Kyiv Art School from 1902 to 1905 until he was expelled, according to one account, for criticizing teachers as “too old-fashioned and academic,” and, according to another, for participating in a strike. In 1906 he held his first solo exhibition in Ukraine, then went to Moscow and in 1908 at the age of twenty moved to Paris. He quit the École des Beaux-Arts after two weeks because he found the academic system confining and tedious, and then studied independently. The Parisian years (1908–21) were his most productive. In 1909 he began making revolutionary sculptures, which he exhibited in the 11 Sonia Delauney (Terk-Delauney) was born in the Ukrainian town of Hradyzhsk near Poltava, but from age five she was raised by an uncle in St. Petersburg. Her memoirs, written late in life, begin by recognizing the profound effect on her work of her childhood in Ukraine. They provide a rhapsodic account of these early years. She studied in the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe before moving to Paris in 1905, where she married the French artist Robert Delauney in 1910. She imitated the patchwork quilt styles of peasant women and was best known for her instinctive color sense and her refusal to accept facile distinctions between the fine arts and applied or decorative arts. She was known for her robust primary colors, her work with fabric, fashion, textile, and costume design, and her color rhythms, dubbed “orphism” by Apollinaire.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nSalon des Indépendants each year from 1910 to 1914, and the Salon d’Automne in 1911, 1912, 1913, and 1919. In 1912 he opened his own art studio in Montparnasse, working alongside Modigliani and Gaudier-Brzeska. Abstract, transparent, and painted sculptures were among his many innovations. He made Medrano 1 (1912), the first sculpture in various painted materials (wood, glass, metal sheet, wire), created reliefs named “sculpto-peintures,” which were generally made of painted plaster, and produced the first modern sculptures formed with negative space (concaves and voids that created implied volumes). He called for a renewal of “ancient polychromy which is far richer than the contemporary non-colored sculpture” (Archipenko 1969, 23) and in 1913 exhibited the highly colored sculpture Pierrot at Der Sturm Gallery in Berlin. Boxing (1914) was one of the most abstract modern sculptures done to that date. From 1919 to 1921 he exhibited in various European cities: Geneva, Zurich, Paris, London, Brussels, Athens, Berlin, and Munich. His solo exhibition in the Venice Biennale was ridiculed in the June 11, 1920 edition of Il Telegrafo Livorno, and Cardinal La Fontaine, Patriarch of Venice, advised the faithful not to attend. In 1921 he opened his own art school in Berlin, and then in 1923 moved to the United States. Like other avant-garde artists of the time Archipenko tried not to copy forms in nature but to apprehend them spiritually and then capture their essence. The charm of his works, wrote Apollinaire, comes from an effortless sense of inward order (Apollinaire 1969; quoted in Karshan 1969, 12). It is a sense that comes from an awareness of ancient art: Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek, Scythian, Byzantine, and Greek. In his student days the artist had taken part in archaeological expeditions, and some critics maintain that early works such as his Woman and Suzanna (1909– 10) recall the simple but powerful expressiveness of ancient stone idols that can be found in the steppe (Olenska-Petryshyn 1997, 490). The profound influence of these statues has been indicated by the artist himself, who recalled how as a small child he played on one of them, climbing over it. However, during dark evenings, he avoided passing it, because it struck terror into him. This same statue now stands in front of the National Art Museum in Kyiv. His interest in ancient art was probably linked to his fascination with cosmic dynamism, the sense of a unity between the highest and lowest forms, between solar systems and the cells of organisms. Art for him reflected the forces of the universe, and he felt that the best art crystallized intuitively sensed forms. Apollinaire was convinced that this aspect of his work reflected the presence of ancient belief-systems (see Karshan 1969, 12–14).\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\nBurliuk David Burliuk, another major figure in the avant-garde, attended the Royal Academy of Arts in Munich (1902–3) and the Académie Fernand Cormon in Paris (1904–5), participated in the Link Exhibition in Kyiv (1908) and was a driving force behind many of the early avant-garde exhibitions in the Russian Empire. His countless lectures on the new art included one in Exter’s Kyiv studio, and he exhibited continually, both in the empire and at Western European venues, such as the Neue Kunstlervereinigung (New Artists’ Association) exhibition in Munich (1910), the Paul Cassirer Gallery in Berlin (1911), and the famous Der Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich (1912), whose almanac of the same name published his article “Die ‘Wilden’ Russlands.” In 1912 he made a second trip to Western Europe traveling through Germany, France, Switzerland, and Italy. During the years of revolution he gave improvised lectures, performances, and exhibitions, eventually bringing his family across Siberia to Vladivostok and across the sea to Japan before emigrating to the United States in 1922. Burliuk had an important early link to the Western avant-garde in Kandinsky, who had spent some of his childhood in Odesa. Partly as a result of this connection, the ground-breaking Izdebskii salons took place in Ukraine. The first, which exhibited many Westerners, was held in Odesa (December 4, 1909 to January 24, 1910) and Kyiv (February 12 to March 14 1910), before traveling to St. Petersburg and Riga. The second, which included scores of paintings by Exter, Burliuk, Konchalovskii, Lentulov, Tatlin, Larionov, Goncharova, and Kandinsky, began in Odesa (February 6 to April 3, 1911) and then traveled to Mykolaiv (Nikolaev) and Kherson (Krusanov 2003, Book 2, 6). It made an enormous impression, because it announced the presence of an indigenous avant-garde art within the borders of the Russian Empire. Burliuk’s links to Ukraine, as will be argued in a later essay, were stronger than is often admitted. David began by extolling a “wild, new beauty” that he associated with the forceful, simple and direct expression in folk creativity and ancient Scythian forms. In the course of a long creative life he would always return to this primary inspiration. Like Archipenko, he was fascinated by the powerful hidden energies within nature. The painterly expression of his intuitive apprehension of things can be found in his steppe landscapes.\n\nSophia Levytska (Sonia Lewitzka) The Ukrainian expatriates in Paris were a varied group. Sophia Levytska was an early member. She completed the Paris Academy of Art in 1905.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nBeginning as a cubist and fauvist, she moved into a post-impressionist style and became known for her illustrations of limited edition books, including Paul Valéry’s Ébauche d’un Serpent (1922) and a French translation of Gogol’s Ukrainian stories. Apollinaire followed her exhibitions and commented on the resemblance of her works to those of Sonia Delauney. Her Parisian contacts were many and her home was a frequent meeting place for Ukrainian artists. In 1931 she organized an exhibition that included Hryshchenko, Andriienko-Nechytailo, Vasyl Khmeliuk, Mykola Krychevskyi, Vasyl Perebyinis, and herself.12\n\nBoichuk In the years preceding the First World War, restoration work conducted on numerous icons had proven conclusively that they had originally been brightly colored. This came as a revelation to many. Since the late nineteenth century, excitement had also been generated by the restoration of frescoes in the most ancient Ukrainian churches, some of which like St. Sophia’s Church and St. Michael’s Church of the Golden Domes dated back to the eleventh century. In the years 1907 to 1909, Mykhailo Boichuk brought awareness of this art to Paris, where he organized a studio in which young Ukrainian and Polish artists experimented with a neo-Byzantine style, combining influences from the Ukrainian icon and folk arts, and the fresco art of the Italian quattrocento (the so-called “primitives”).13 The group’s exhibition was reviewed by Apollinaire, who was himself of Polish background and had Ukrainian sympathies. He wrote favorably of the Zaporozhian Cossacks and produced his own French version of the famous, apocryphal “Letter of the Zaporozhians to the Sultan.” It is possible that Archipenko provided him with a “copy” of the legendary letter and information about Ukrainian history.\n\nHryshchenko (Alexis Gritchenko) Hryshchenko, who arrived in Paris after the revolution, also had a strong interest in the icon. He had specializing in biology in Kyiv and Moscow universities, but had also studied art in these cities and became involved in the modern art movement in Russia. During a brief earlier stay in Paris in 1911, 12 On Levytska see Susak 2010, 75–81. 13 On Boichuk in Paris see Susak 2016, 36–46.\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\nhe had met Andre Lhote, Archipenko, and Le Fauconnier, and developed an interest in cubism. He had also taken a trip to Italy to study the early Renaissance. In analyzing the Italian art of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and the icons of ancient Rus, he found that the old masters applied “cubist” solutions to problems of space and color. In this way Hryshchenko traced a link between the contemporary avant-garde, the so-called “primitives” of the early Renaissance and the icon. He was convinced that a full understanding of the icon had only become possible with the appearance of modern art. Like Andre Benois and Aleksandr (Oleksandr) Shevchenko, he found formal similarities between ancient icons and the work of Matisse and Picasso. Although the debate on the icon had been stimulated around 1910 by the final refutation of its darkness, the icon’s formal, painterly qualities (as opposed to its religious importance or Christian symbolism) had never been investigated in the way Hryshchenko did in his two monographs, O sviaziakh russkoi zhivopisi s Vizantiei i Zapadom (On the Links of Russian Painting with Byzantium and the West, 1913) and Russkaia ikona kak iskusstvo zhivopisi (The Russian Icon as an Art of Painting, 1917). His own work blended a cosmopolitan worldview with formal features of Byzantine sacred art. In 1919, together with Shevchenko, he mounted an exhibition in Moscow called “Tsvetodinamos i tekhtonicheskii primitivism” (Colordynamos and Tekhtonic Primitivism), which was conceived as a counterbalance to production art. The two artists announced that only color, composition and “faktura” interested them. From 1919 to 1921 Hryshchenko lived in Istanbul, where he painted hundreds of watercolors. He then moved to France, where he became known for his exotic streams of oriental color. In his Moscow years Hryshchenko played a prominent role in the avant-garde, both as a painter and theorist. He was able to reconcile the Western and Eastern avant-gardes and explain their common concerns and interests. Unfortunately, his importance was never recognized in the Soviet Union, partly because his avant-gardism was painterly and not political, and partly because the regime considered him a traitor for leaving the country. As a result, his canvases were cut up and given to students in Moscow’s Higher Art and Technical Studios (Vkhutemas) to practice upon, and his name removed from art history. Later he exhibited in leading Parisian art galleries. He also displayed in Lviv in the 1930s at the Association of Independent Ukrainian Artists (ANUM, Asotsiiatsiia nezalezhnykh mysttsiv Ukrainy) and had personal shows in New York and Philadelphia. In 1963 he donated seventy works to the Ukrainian Institute of America in New York. These have now been transferred to Kyiv.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nAndriienko-Nechytailo (Andreenko) Mykhailo Andriienko-Nechytailo (Michel Andreenko) studied in Kherson before the war and placed his first cubist and abstract works in a Leipzig exhibition (1916–17). He worked in Petrograd, before returning via Kyiv to Kherson in 1918. In 1919 he studied in Odesa with Exter, and worked for the theater. The city was divided into zones and he had to cross the borders with a military escort of get to the theater and back. He then worked as a set designer in Bucharest and Prague, and finally settled in Paris in 1923. Influenced by de Chirico and the surrealists, his works in the 1930s expressed the loneliness and isolation of the individual, as well as the mysteriousness of things. In later decades he developed a naïve art that searched for harmonious forms and childlike innocence.\n\nBaranoff-Rossiné (Baranov) Wladimir Baranoff-Rossiné was also born near Kherson, and studied at the Odesa School of Art (1903–7) and the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg (1908–9). He contributed to the Link (1908) and many early avant-garde exhibitions in the empire before moving to Paris in 1910, where he exhibited under the name of Daniel Rossiné from 1911 to 1914. In 1917 he returned to Russia, exhibiting in Petrograd and Moscow before emigrating to Paris in 1925. He exhibited at the Salon des Indépendents and other venues until 1942. In the 1910s he developed a style that represented a moderate futurism that was decorative, weightless, and full of light, spiral-shaped elements with silky textures. Like Andriienko’s, his work was not politically engaged, but borrowed from the visual charm and spiritual harmony of the icon.\n\nRedko Klyment Redko studied icon painting in the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves from 1910 to 1914. Here he met Vasilii Chekrigin, with whom he discussed cubism, futurism, and other modern art movements, while examining reproductions of Picasso, Braque, Matisse, and other artists. He then studied at the Moscow Art School (1913), the Petrograd in the Society for the Advancement of Art (1914–18), and the Ukrainian Academy of Arts in Kyiv (1918–19). He was a friend of Nikritin and Boichuk. In 1920 he found\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\nhimself in Kharkiv with Nikritin and Shterenberg, and then studied in the Moscow Vkhutemas (1920–22) where he associated with Nikritin, Tyshler, and other artists from Ukraine. In the eight years he spent in Paris (1927– 35) before returning to the Soviet Union he participated in the Salon d’Automne (1927), had four personal exhibitions, and met Picasso and other leading figures. Boichuk, Sedliar and Taran spent time with him when they visited the city in 1927. Redko’s early art is abstract and constructivist, but in the twenties he moved toward a realist style.\n\nAvant-garde film Ukrainians also made contribution to other, related art forms, notably the cinema. At the same time as Oleksandr Dovzhenko and Ivan Kavaleridze were producing avant-garde films in Ukraine, Yevhen Slavchenko (Eugene Deslaw) was making a reputation as an avant-garde film maker in Paris. He emigrated as part of the exodus that followed the defeat of the Ukrainian People’s Republic (1917–20). Deslaw studied in Paris in the 1920s and at the École Technique Photo-Cinema in 1927. In that year he assisted Abel Gance in making the early French film epic, Napoléon. His abstract and experimental films include Marche des Machines (1928), La Nuit Électrique (1930), Montparnasse (1931), Négatifs (1932), and Robots (1932). He worked with Boris Kaufmann (a collaborator on Marche des Machines), Alfred Zinnemann (the photographer on Marche des Machines), Luis Bunuel, and Marcel Carné (his assistants on Montparnasse). Until 1930 he corresponded with the Ukrainian futurist journal Nova generatsiia (New Generation) and with Dovzhenko, whom he met in Paris in 1930. Deslaw is considered part of the so-called second wave of the French avant-garde, which included Fernand Léger, René Claire, Henri Chaumet, Man Ray, and Germaine Dulac.\n\nLviv Even after the Soviet borders were closed to them, Ukrainians living in Paris could maintain contacts with Lviv, which during the inter-war years found itself within the Polish state. They worked closely with ANUM and a number of them, including Andriienko, Hryshchenko, Hlushchenko, Khmeliuk, and Perebyinis, sent works to Lviv for display in the 1930s. At the end of the 1920s a group of fourteen Jewish avant-garde artists from Lviv, many of\n\n15\n\n16\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nwhom had spent time in Paris, formed the organization ARTES (1929–35). They held thirteen exhibitions in Lviv, Ternopil, Stanislaviv (now IvanoFrankivsk), Krakow, and also in Warsaw and Lodz in the years 1930–32 (Kotliar and Susak 2005, 323).\n\nKyiv milieu It is clear from even such a short survey that a cohort of remarkably talented artists from Ukraine worked in Paris in the heyday of the avant-garde. The milieus that produced them (Kherson, Odesa, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Lviv) and the connections between them have seldom been investigated. It is impossible in an overview to examine these milieus, but a glance at one, Kyiv, is instructive. The city is particularly interesting and important, because it radiated a distinct influence and style throughout the years 1910 to 1930. Why was it such a powerful generator of avant-garde activity? Perhaps because radical transformations were already occurring there early in the twentieth century due to population migration and growth, industrialization, and modernization. It was reputedly the first city within the empire and the second in Europe to have an electric tramway (streetcar), whose image figures strongly in Bohomazov’s futurist paintings, symbolizing movement and modernity’s galvanizing impact on urban life. The shock of the new, combined with the discovery of a rich and vibrant indigenous folk culture, seem to have provided the initial creative spark for the Kyiv avant-garde. Another factor was the Kyiv Art School, which from 1901 to 1920 produced many great talents, among them Exter, Meller, Kavaleridze, Archipenko, Bohomazov, Abram Manevych, Anton Pevzner (Antoine Pevsner), Aristarkh Lentulov, Isaak Rabinovich, Aleksandr (Oleksandr) Tyshler, Mark (Moisei) Epstein, Solomon Nikritin, Issakhar-Ber Rybak, and Anatolii Petrytskyi. It accepted Jewish students in substantial numbers, sometimes in opposition to the desires of government authorities. From 1901 to 1920, almost half the students in the School were of Jewish background. The resulting mix of talented and ambitious artists from different backgrounds had much to do with the generation of an innovative, creative atmosphere. At least three other reasons were important in producing the artistic ferment in Kyiv, particularly during the revolutionary years and the twenties. One was the creation by the Ukrainian government (the UNR or Ukrainian People’s Republic, 1917–20) of a Ukrainian Academy of Arts\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\nin 1917–18. It brought together some of the most talented professors, such as Vasyl Krychevskyi, Yurii Narbut, Abram Manevych, and Mykhailo Boichuk, and many gifted students. Although the institution went through two name changes under Soviet rule, it continued to exert a strong influence on artistic life in Ukraine throughout this period.14 A second was the creation of the Kultur-Lige by the same government. In pre-war years, Jewish students had graduated from a number of academic institutions such as the Kyiv Art School. Along with Jewish artists who were escaping revolutionary events in Russia, in 1918 they began participating in the work of the Kyiv Kultur-Lige, making the city into one of the world’s most dynamic centers of Yiddish culture and the Jewish avant-garde. Although, after the organization’s Sovietization in 1920, some prominent figures left, it continued its work until 1925, while its publishing house and art school survived into the thirties. A third factor was the supportive atmosphere provided in the late twenties by the Kyiv Art Institute. In 1928, at a time when doors were closing to avant-gardists in Moscow and Leningrad, Malevich joined Tatlin, Bohomazov, Boichuk, and Palmov on the Institute’s teaching faculty. Archipenko was also invited to teach there, although he declined the offer. The Institute was already the third largest post-secondary art school in the Soviet Union. Its able director Ivan Vrona dreamed of making it and the related Mezhyhiria Art and Ceramics Institute into a “Bauhaus of the East.” The connections forged at the Institute between Malevich, Tatlin, Palmov, Bohomazov, and Boichuk have yet to be fully analyzed, but they obviously stimulated creative activity. As a result of all these factors, the late twenties produced a final blossoming of the avant-garde in the city. In these years the futurist journal Nova generatsiia (New Generation) published many innovative works, such as Malevich’s history of art. In this way the Kyiv milieus nourished the avant-garde in its early years and provided it with a final refuge. There may have been deeper historical reasons for the existence of supportive ground in Kyiv. It could be argued that the country had long been a meeting ground of cultural influences and was therefore prepared to confront and even welcome novelty. Already in the seventeenth century a distinct Western culture had arisen there, one that was baroque, Latin, and relatively cosmopolitan. Ukrainian Orthodox, Polish Catholic, Jewish rabbinical and later Hassidic cultures interacted or rubbed shoulders, and continued to do so for many generations. In the nineteenth century these 14 The Ukrainian State Academy of Arts was created in 1917. It was renamed the Kyiv Institute of Plastic Arts in 1922, then renamed the Kyiv Art Institute in 1924.\n\n17\n\n18\n\nForging the European Connection\n\ninteractions were overlaid by a Russian imperial and bureaucratic culture. As a result, in the twentieth century, members of the avant-garde in Ukraine could, for example, be of Ukrainian, Polish, Russian, or Jewish origins, and might sometimes mix imperial and national or Christian and Jewish imagery in their art, much as occurred in the various literatures that were produced in Ukraine (among them Ukrainian, Russian and Yiddish). The coexistence of different viewpoints, and the possibility of shifting perspectives, is a feature of the avant-garde art from this period. Moreover, it is too rarely noted that substantial contacts with Western art in the pre-war decades had prepared the ground for the Ukrainian avant-garde. The Viennese and Munich Secessions had a strong resonance in Ukraine. The different expressions of modernity in Paris, Munich, Berlin, and Vienna were accessible to Ukrainians directly from the sources. They developed their own versions of European movements, and were from the beginning prepared not only to witness but also to participate in the creation of a new art. As a result of their interaction with Europe the Kyivans already developed a new style in the pre-war years, one that was different from that of the Western and the Moscow fauvists and cubists. Exter’s early works, such as Genoa (1913), Constructivist Composition (1916–18) and City at Night (1919), when compared with Bohomazov’s Bouquet of Flowers (1914–15), Meller’s Composition (1917–18) and Urban Landscape (1912–13), or Rybak’s City (1917) indicate a close affinity.\n\nDistinct character In the years 1908 to 1930 Kyiv produced an avant-garde with a distinct character. At the risk of misrepresenting some aspects of a varied, evolving and dynamic milieu, generalizations about its uniqueness have been made. Its style, according to Nakov, was less aggressive formally, but structurally and compositionally more solid (Nakov 1991, 18). On the whole, the Kyiv milieu focused more on skill and knowledge of a craft. Bohomazov, for example, considered artists to be superior craft workers. What Nakov calls a “modestie artisanale” (Nakov, 21) differed from the constructivism that developed in the late twenties and aimed at complete mastery of technique, materials and conception. A similar concern with artisanal skills and proficiency in a craft can be seen in Boichuk, Archipenko and the Kharkiv artist Vasyl Yermilov. Nakov has also suggested that the work of the Ukrainian avant-garde as a whole is less haunted by a sense of metaphysical angst and more concerned with inner harmony. The Kyivans were less attracted\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\nto grand philosophical constructions or extravagant world-changing theories and more focused on researching color and rhythm or the energy of materials (Nakov, 21). The Boichuk School, perhaps as a result of the search for inner harmony, often preferred a subdued, delicately graded palette with quiet, “faded” colors. But a preference for “earth-like” colors was popular with a number of artists from around 1918 until the mid-twenties, including Anatolii Petrytskyi, Issakhar-Ber Rybak and artists associated with the Kultur-Lige. Bohomazov in a number of ways typifies the Kyiv milieu. He studied in the Kyiv Art School (1902–5). After being expelled along with Archipenko in 1906, he worked with Hryshchenko in Crimea, painting in the open air, then studied in Moscow (1906–7) before returning to the Kyiv school (1908–11). He was co-organizer with Exter of the Link Exhibition (1908) and organizer of the Ring Exhibition (1914). He taught design in a commercial lycée, and in Kyiv’s Jewish lycée, and in 1922 began lecturing in the Kyiv Art Institute. In 1914 he wrote “The Art of Painting,” an unpublished text that became a manual of instruction at the Institute. It traced the evolution of the new painting through German expressionism, Kandinsky and Larionov, and offered the view that art was the distinct rhythm of its constitutive elements, of forms regulated by a complex inner logic. Like Archipenko and Burliuk, Bohomazov was fascinated with the hidden energy within matter. He saw the world as dynamic, constantly in movement and transformation. For him all forms changed as they impinged upon one another. Myroslava Mudrak has written that the artist instructed his students to “penetrate the pulsating features of their environment to draw out its qualitative and quantitative living movement” (Mudrak 1987, 138). She relates his idea of “internal agitation” to Archipenko’s attempts in his “Archipentura” to capture real motion in painting (Mudrak, 138). Bohomazov’s belief that sensation was “a physical, tactile and material sensibility” and should dictate an artist’s method aligns him with other Ukrainian artists who tended to focus on the real world, the surrounding human and natural environment, and the artist’s sensations (Mudrak, 139). Ukrainians were often concerned with discoveries that were of local provenance or inspiration. They explored folk roots, painted local scenes, and found novelty in marginalized art forms, such as hand-painted sign boards, amateur carvings, embroideries, and popular icons. By celebrating local crafts, they implicitly challenged the division between high and low genres, or between applied art and easel painting. This democratic impulse often turned into a validation of national cultural traditions. It guided not only Kyivan artists who were of Ukrainian origin, but also those who were of Jewish origin.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nLike the international avant-garde as a whole, the Ukrainian, in both its Kyivan and Parisian manifestations, had a visionary component. It aimed at a liberation of the imagination, brought important theoretical insights, and challenged accepted ways of perceiving the world by rejecting nineteenth-century forms. Stylistic integrity was more of a consideration for the Boichuk School and the Kultur-Lige, both of which aimed at the creation of an art with national roots, but most avant-gardists were more interested in personal moments of illumination and in breakthroughs to new ways of seeing and feeling. These kinds of inspired moments were sought primarily in primitivism, which for these artists usually meant folk art, ancient art or the icon. Gombrich has argued that throughout history the primitive has been extolled as a reaction to kitsch in art, to what was perceived as sugary and insipid. The primitive has been valued for providing the required antidote of a bracing, invigorating effect. The rediscovery of the icon played a similar role in overcoming established tastes. It challenged the idea, widespread in the late nineteenth century, that Western art had been making steady progress after the setback of the Middle Ages, and that this progress essentially meant moving away from the “clumsy and ugly manner of the Byzantines,” through the “skillful, but still hard and angular style of the quattrocento,” to the polish and sophistication of the Renaissance (Gombrich 2002, 8). The Ukrainian and Russian avant-gardists rejected this dismissive view of Byzantine art. They rediscovered the (often refined) beauty of the icon and the quattrocento, and confronted contemporary “realist” tastes with this revelation. The Boichuk School, in particular, made a cornerstone of these views and vigorously defended them in the 1920s. Boichuk’s careful, balanced compositions and quiet color tones aimed at portraying characters in a state of grace. In this respect he differed from Burliuk and some Russian artists, whose reworking of the icon reveled in the “crude” and “grotesque.” Their art was more reminiscent of popular lubok (broadsheet) prints and signboard art, with its strong colors and simple lines. Theoretical concerns were sometimes animated by what Nakov has called a “euphorie coloriste” (Nakov 1991, 24). Considerable research and theorizing was devoted to color by a number of figures, among them Bohomazov, Palmov, Malevich, and Hryshchenko. Both the “Kyivan” and “Parisian” Ukrainians explored the possibilities of color in their artistic practice with great intensity. Much theorizing was also focused on the energy of materials. Ukrainians seem to have drawn inspiration from physical processes occurring in living organisms (the steppe, rural landscapes, the impact of city scenes on human perceptions). This focus on the rural or natural world made them different from Italian and, to a great extent,\n\nKyiv to Paris: Ukrainian Art in the European Avant-Garde, 1910–30\n\nRussian futurists, in whose works the urban often predominated, and who glorified the city and technology as forces capable of overcoming chaos and shaping nature. Malevich, as will be argued later, hesitated between the urban and rural, particularly when he fell under the influence of the Kyiv milieu in the late twenties. In fact, many Ukrainian artists, including Malevich, Burliuk, Palmov, Bohomazov, and Boichuk, seem to have rebelled against the tendency to glorify the urban, the mechanical, and the depersonalized. Instead, they presented the natural world as an alternative ideal. Although some constructivists and production artists were interested, at least for a time, in the mechanized collective, there was considerable resistance to this aesthetic among Ukrainians in both Kyiv and Paris. Artists from Ukraine living in the West generally had little interest in extolling the machine age or political utopias, particularly in the late 1920s, when these trends became part of an almost mandatory, militantly political style in the Soviet Union. Their own negative experiences of the Bolshevik Revolution made them recoil from violence and treat impersonal mechanisms with suspicion. In general, they viewed the drive for political correctness as fundamentally destructive. This was true not only of the Parisian Ukrainians, but also of Burliuk. Even though he worked for Russkii golos (Russian Voice), a pro-communist newspaper in New York, and maintained a pro-Soviet line, he was profoundly ambivalent about the direction the regime and its art were taking. His return in the 1930s to a naïve art of innocent rural scenes aligns him with the anti-urban art favored by many of his compatriots. Ukrainians in particular were not prepared to see peasants and workers as dumb, passive raw material to be manipulated by a bolshevik vanguard. Their work, even in the Soviet Union, was usually an implicit, and sometimes an explicit, rejection of this approach. “Stalinist” constructivism, which came along in the late twenties and early thirties, and which exuded puritanical, humorless and conformist messages, led to a wrenching apart of the Kyivan avant-garde collectivity and a crushing of its creative inspiration. Also important for this generation was what Nakov has called a “charge mystique” and “une élévation philosophique” (Nakov, 15). The interest in mysticism had been an important part of Russian modernism and its so-called Silver Age. However, in the case of many Ukrainian avant-gardists the search for the inexpressible and intuitive appears to have been rooted not in metaphysical or political abstraction but in the observation of nature. If the artist was to develop a new, universal consciousness, they seemed to be saying, it would have to be done through a greater awareness of physical processes. The steppe became for them a metaphor for nature writ large, and beyond this for the cosmos. For a number—Burliuk and Malevich among\n\n21\n\n22\n\nForging the European Connection\n\nthem—it represented animation, the interaction of numerous life forms, a life process sensed rather than understood. It also represented nature’s vastness, abundance, and profusion. It was nature’s power, rather than the machine’s that fascinated them. This might also explain why the work of a number of artists, including Boichuk, Hryshchenko, Baranoff-Rossiné, and Bohomazov, has a softer, more organic appearance, as though dictated by natural growth, rather than by the superimposition of the observer’s own dissecting analysis. The sculptures of Archipenko and Tatlin are also not inspired by the machine aesthetic but by an intuitively sensed inner harmony based on ancient forms, or by an artisan’s awareness of the “natural” possibilities within materials and of the best work produced by craftsmen who work these materials. Tatlin’s monument to the Third International has often been interpreted as the communist answer to the Tower of Babel, a propagandistic, militant, visionary political statement. It has rarely been suggested that its construction resembles the splayed wooden strips used to make the bandura, a gracefully constructed, elegant and functional instrument. Seen in this way, the tower’s formal perfection is a tribute to human skill and ingenuity, both of which are rooted in a long artisanal tradition. In such an interpretation, Tatlin’s work is not simply a call to an unattainable future. (The tower, after all, leads nowhere.) It can equally well represent harmonious design, artistry, and joy in human achievement. Finally, it should be noted that, when seen in the broader European context, the importance of personal lyricism to the Kyivan and Parisian Ukrainians becomes apparent. Although initially attracted to analytical cubism, many quickly moved on to a gently intuitive, subjective expression of the visible. The Ukrainian avant-garde’s distinctiveness was therefore preconditioned by its emergence from a specific milieu (the Kyiv Art School, the Ukrainian Academy of Arts, the Kultur-Lige, the Kyiv Art Institute, and the national movement). Among its dominant traits were a passion for color; a romance with primitivism and kinetic energy; a focus on the local and national elements that were often rooted in the ancient past; a fascination with natural processes; and a concern with inner harmony and personal lyricism. Through these traits it brought its own distinct accent to the international avant-garde.\n\nPolitics and Painting\n\nPolitics and the Ukrainian Avant-Garde1 The twenty years in which the historical avant-garde burst upon the scene (1908–28) were a time of great political turmoil and intense ideological debate. Although primarily concerned with pursuing new forms of expression, many avant-gardists were both politically motivated and concerned with linking new ways of perceiving the world to the business of remaking it. Their aesthetico-cultural and political projects were often, therefore, coupled or fused. However, by the late twenties and early thirties, the era that Boris Groys dubbed “total art-politics” had taken over, and a radical simplification of form, a stridency of tone, and uniformity of expression came to dominate Soviet literature and art. Groys, Andrei Siniavsky and others have argued that the shift to this politicization of art had been psychologically prepared earlier and that the avant-garde played a significant role in the process. Most commentators, however, have viewed the two decades that preceded Stalin’s “cultural revolution” of 1928–33 as fundamentally different from the years that followed. A more sympathetic view of the historical avant-garde has situated it in a tradition going back to Kant and the romantics, a tradition in which the intellectual tried to forge a new world by an act of will, often by retreating into the inner world of the spirit. In the 1908–28 period, such utopian world-construction produced visionary, ground-breaking works. It was only in the late twenties that these visionary artist-communards received the seductive proposal of managing a great cultural-political transformation, of becoming “engineers of human souls.” Some accepted the invitation, but 1 This chapter is a shortened and modified version of my chapter “Politics and the Ukrainian Avant-Garde,” in Modernism in Kyiv: Jubilant Experimentation, edited by Irena R. Makaryk and Virlana Tkacz, 219-97 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010).\n\n26\n\nPolitics and Painting\n\nStalin’s “cultural revolution” of 1928–33 and the ensuing purges and terror should be distinguished from the earlier period. For one thing, the post-1928 period demanded a fundamental reinterpretation of the nature and function of literature and art. In literature, for instance, from the time of the romantics, as Tzvetan Todorov has pointed out, a decisive contrast had been made between belles lettres or creative writing on the one hand, and the utilitarian or practical use of language on the other (Todorov 1987, 17–18). Belles lettres found its justification within itself (was autotelic), while the practical use of language subordinated itself to external goals (was heterotelic). The autotelic view was accepted by Ukrainian modernists and symbolists for whom literature dealt with symbolic facts, mythical and metaphorical frameworks that rearranged patterns of experience and revealed the world by transcending reality. In their first collection, Sbornik po teorii poeticheskogo iazyka (The Anthology of the Theory of Poetic Language, 1916), the Russian formalists also contrasted the “autonomous value of linguistic representations” with the “practical goal” of language (Todorov, 11). Literature, according to them, foregrounded the use of language as device. The counterposition that became hegemonic in the thirties stressed the primacy of social function: literature and the arts were to serve the party’s educational and agitational tasks. Any foregrounding of artistic devices was condemned as “formalism.” To a degree, this position had indeed been prepared earlier by avant-garde groups. Mikhail Semenko, the leader of the Ukrainian futurists, had early in the twenties called the notion of art as a “self-serving category” both “inappropriate and dangerous.” According to him, it was permissible only to “exploit” the devices of art with the goal of agitating for the ideals of the working class (Semenko 1924, 227). He put forward a harder version of this line in April 1929 in a debate entitled “Who Needs Art?” when he insisted that art as an emotional category was dying: it had to be subordinated to reason and forced to perform socially useful tasks (Semenko 1929). Nonetheless, most avant-gardists found the concept of political education espoused by the party in the late twenties to be far too narrow. Writers and artists were at this time instructed to serve the party in immediate, practical ways: they were told to praise industrial projects, hail the Five-Year Plan, or denounce the regime’s critics. A crude “political” interpretation of texts and art works was used to assess “class sympathies.” Overt propaganda, absolute loyalty and a militant posture were demanded. In 1930 the declaration of the All-Ukrainian Federation of Revolutionary Soviet Writers stated: “Every revolutionary Soviet writer should be an active builder of\n\nPolitics and the Ukrainian Avant-Garde\n\nsocialism, a disciplined fighter on the front of class war—this is our slogan and our command to the Army of Ukrainian Revolutionary Soviet Writers” (Deklaratsiia 1930, 124).\n\nToward an art-politics Although neither the intransigent tone, the mandatory optimism, nor the parade-ground rhetoric were new, to be accused of “Hamletism,” or “psychologism” or “tearful lyricism” could now, in the new atmosphere prove fatal. A political charge expressed in poetry or prose carried a deadly menace, making even apparently harmless literary exchanges dangerous. This was a departure from all recent practice. At some deep level a break had occurred from the humanist tradition that celebrated the blossoming of the individual personality, and welcomed the excitement produced by original, even transgressive, thought and feelings. Whereas most “civic” writers and artists had previously attempted to assimilate political awareness to a wider spiritual culture, to integrate politics into art, from 1928 the move was to entirely assimilate literature and art to politics. The structuring of human perceptions and feelings around slogans became a conscious aim, affecting the tone, diction, imagery, and rhetorical devices of poetry, prose, drama, and the visual arts. The demand was for a simple message, narrative closure, conventional psychological portrayal, and plot structure. Works that could not be reduced to easily demonstrable political categories, that remained puzzlingly complex or sophisticated, or that challenged simple categories and schemes came under attack. After the last burst of formal innovation by the avant-garde in 1929–30, stylistic novelty and parody were eschewed. In this last fling, it appeared to many that “left art” had been used by the party in order to complete the task of “destroying” previous systems; from this moment on “left art” could be harnessed to the purpose of “constructing” whatever the regime judged to be new and useful. Ironically, both in Russia and Ukraine writers and artists who had been educated on revolt and iconoclasm appeared suddenly to have been transformed into conformist political instruments. Some, of course, refused the role. Others, although they managed to produce what Jacques Ellul has called the “overt” forms of propaganda, seemed genuinely incapable of producing the “covert,” spontaneous or subconscious ones (Ellul 1973, 61–87). Indeed, the literature and art of the late twenties and early thirties, as well as much later Soviet cultural production, can profitably be analyzed as revealing a tension or conflict between these overt and covert messages. Dovzhenko’s film Zemlia (Earth,\n\n27\n\n28\n\nPolitics and Painting\n\n1930), on the surface a call for collectivization, is at a deeper level a hymn to the countryside and ancient ways. Yurii Yanovskyi’s novel Chotyry shabli (Four Swords, 1930), which treats the revolution as national resistance, Volodymyr Gzhytskyi’s novel Chorne ozero (Black Lake, 1929), which views Soviet expansion as the spread of Russian hegemony, and Les Kurbas’s deflating production of Ivan Mykytenko’s play Dyktatura (Dictatorship, 1929)—all are prominent examples of works with ambiguous and subversive messages. Kazimir Malevich’s peasant portraits of 1928–30, as will be argued later, also resound with subversive undertones. Another category of works shuffled the evaluative signs to make it difficult for a reader to identify positive and negative characters, thus demanding of the reader a more thoughtful assessment of events. Hryhorii Epik’s novel Persha vesna (First Spring, 1931) is an example. But almost all writers knuckled under in some way, even rewriting their works to fit the new requirements. A much-lauded classic of socialist realism and a work given the status of a patristic text, Andrii Holovko’s Maty (Mother) now exists in two editions, the 1932 original and the 1935 revision. The same hold true for his Burian (Weeds, 1927 and 1932), Petro Panch’s Holubi eshelony (Blue Echelons, 1926 and 1928), and Gzhytskyi’s Chorne ozero (1929 and, after many rejected revisions, 1956). Yanovskyi’s Chotyry shabli was criticized so strongly that the author felt obliged to write Vershnyky (Riders, 1935) as an act of literary-political contrition. Students of the literary heritage today often have to deal with several possible versions of the same book— palimpsests in which imposed political sentiments and stylistic features obscure the original inspiration. Before the late 1920s the introduction of a radically new sensibility had been interpreted by most avant-gardists in a broad aesthetico-cultural and philosophical sense. It was seen as the awakening and refinement of the mind and emotions, and involvement in politics as a response to perceived inadequacies. Writers and artists criticized narrow-mindedness, backwardness, obscurantism, and prejudice. However, they were gradually compelled to voice some concerns and avoid others. For instance, the attitude to the past—a crucial indicator of political preference—went through a rapid change. Many avant-gardists who earlier appeared prepared to jettison all past values, had by the late twenties begun to conform to Moscow’s demands and refrained from criticizing the Russian imperial past. In Ukraine, the political situation was defined by the existence of two powerful revolutionary political movements—socialism and nationalism. Each claimed a different kind of awakened and transformed consciousness. Writers and artists contended with the two competing visions of liberation.\n\nPolitics and the Ukrainian Avant-Garde\n\nIn fact, in the early twenties they often found themselves attempting to reconcile them. By the end of the decade any suggestion of ambiguous and divided loyalties had been suppressed by the Soviet regime. The involvement in the struggle to create an independent Ukrainian People’s Republic (1917–20) of most intellectuals, including prominent figures like Dovzhenko and the poet Volodymyr Sosiura, could not be mentioned.\n\nNational difference The Ukrainian avant-garde negotiated four political transitions in the 1920s: the national revolution (1917–19), the establishment of bolshevik power (1919–23), the period of Ukrainization (1923–28), and the imposition of Stalinist rule (1928–33). Most individuals prudently shifted their ground, aligning their views and artistic production with changing political imperatives. Accordingly, some supported the national movement, then Ukrainization movement, and then attacked prominent figures in this movement for “bourgeois nationalism” and “formalism” in the years 1928–33. It was convenient for cultural workers to forget that prior to 1917 a nationally conscious public had emerged, which had then participated in building the UNR by lending support in turn to the Central Rada (1917–18), the German-backed Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky (1918) and the Directory (1918–19). This public had supported the creation of cultural institutions such as the Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Arts, and had provided the readers, viewers and audiences for publications, visual and performing arts. The legacy of state and nation-building in these years was unwillingly inherited by many bolsheviks who had initially rejected the call for an independent or even autonomous Ukrainian state as counter-revolutionary. Some had even disputed the fact that a separate Ukrainian nation existed. Many had, in fact, regarded the revolution as primarily a war against separatism and considered Ukrainian culture subversive almost by definition, denouncing it as “counter-revolutionary,” “Petliurite,” or “a German invention.” Others dismissed it as derivative and incomplete, merely a branch of Russian, or condemned it as fundamentally flawed: inchoate, unrefined or antisemitic. Moreover, in the early years of Soviet rule some bolsheviks felt entitled to repress all expressions of Ukrainian identity as an act of revenge against what they had been conditioned to see as “counter-revolution.” This was relatively easy in the early years of Soviet rule because the composition\n\n29\n\n30\n\nPolitics and Painting\n\nof the Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Ukraine (CP(b)U) was predominantly Russian and contained a substantial number of non-Ukrainians, among whom Jews constituted the largest component.2 Moreover, until 1926 Ukrainians made up less than half, and often less than a third, of the population in major cities. Not surprisingly, therefore, from 1919 until April 1923 one group in the CP(b)U leadership put forward a “struggle of two cultures” theory, according to which Russian was viewed as the “culture of the city” and Ukrainian as the “culture of the village.” The latter was branded as representing the backward, peasant element. According to this theory the two cultures would compete for supremacy until the final inevitable victory of the higher and more progressive culture, which was, naturally, assumed to be Russian. This view was most closely associated with Dmytro Lebed, a secretary of the CP(b)U, but it had strong support in Moscow. Grigorii Zinovev, for example, raised the same arguments repeatedly throughout the 1920s. As a consequence of this ideological influence, Ukrainian institution-building was severely hampered in the early years of Soviet rule; support for Ukrainian newspapers, publishing houses and schools was withdrawn or withheld; and Ukrainian activists within the party were frequently treated with suspicion. In fact, long after the “struggle of two cultures” theory had been officially rejected, much of the party leadership still espoused it and continued to oppose the development of Ukrainian cultural and educational institutions. Their revolutionary experience had convinced these individuals that all Ukrainians were potential nationalists and separatists. In his memoirs Nikita Khrushchev recalled that Stalin’s henchman in Ukraine, Lazar Kaganovich, “was fond of saying that every Ukrainian is potentially a nationalist” (Khrushchev 1970, 172). The situation began to change gradually. First, when the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed a constituent member of the Soviet Union (on the last day of 1922 and the first of 1923), and then when Russian chauvinism was condemned at the Twelfth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) in April, 1923. On August 1, 1923, the CP(b)U announced a policy of Ukrainization, which included support for the development of Ukrainian language in schools, educational 2 The party census from 1922 gave the total figure of CP(b)U members as 54,818. Out of these 4,647 had come from Russian and Jewish parties, while the Ukrainian parties, namely the so-called Borotbists and the Ukrainian Communist Party (UCP, which had emerged from the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party), contributed only 118 and 34 members, respectively. The breakdown of the CP(b)U’s total membership in 1923 was 51,236. Of these 27,490 (53.6%) were listed as Russians, 11,920 (23.3%) as Ukrainians, 6,981 (13.6%) as Jews, 1,241 (2.6%) as Poles, and 3,604 (7.1%) as belonging to other nationalities. See Ravich-Cherkasskii 1923, 239.\n\nPolitics and the Ukrainian Avant-Garde\n\ninstitutions and government. These concessions, Moscow realized, were required in order to obtain peace in Ukraine and to win over large sections of the population. Little, however, was done to implement the policy until 1925. During that year Ukrainians became a majority within the CP(b)U and the pressure for change increased. In May, Stalin dispatched Lazar Kaganovich to the new capital, Kharkiv, to become the First Secretary of the CP(b)U. His instructions were to instill life into the Ukrainization policy, but to keep it under close political supervision. A number of commentators have suggested that a deal had been struck between Stalin’s faction in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the leaders backing Ukrainization in the CP(b)U, with the latter agreeing to support Stalin on all-Union issues in return for a faster pace of Ukrainization. In June 1926, the Central Committee of the CP(b)U adopted further measures, which proved to be the government’s most sympathetic statement on the national question in Ukraine. However, a crucial issue emerged: the need for decisive results in Ukrainianizing the party itself. In the view of many communist party members, Ukrainization meant an “indigenization” (korenizatsiia) that would draw the local population into the party and the work of government. This would be accomplished by nourishing a Ukrainian culture that was national in form but socialist in content; in other words, one that differed only in language and modes of delivery, but whose content would be formulated in and broadcast from Moscow and Leningrad. Those who held this view were soon disappointed. In fact, as soon as the schools, media and government institutions began to actively support the use of Ukrainian, the pressure for transferring real decision-making to Kharkiv became unstoppable. Moreover, Ukrainian culture began to exhibit great vitality and assimilative power. Instead of willingly assimilating to the “superior” Russian culture, a scenario that many party leaders had assumed to be the inevitable outcome, the population began to develop cultural institutions that challenged their local Russian competitors. Those who had until then been educated in a Russian cultural environment were confronted with an identity whose existence they had never suspected and whose presence seemed foreign to them. The twenties can therefore be characterized as a struggle between Russian centralizing and hegemonist views on the one hand and demands for autonomy among national republics on the other. When, in mid-decade, Ukrainian leaders insisted upon a full emancipation of their cultural life, a conflict with russificatory tendencies came to a head. The Literary Discussion of 1925–28 was the critical turning point. In its final stages Mykola Skrypnyk, the powerful Commissar for Education in Ukraine,\n\n31\n\n32\n\nPolitics and Painting\n\nurged participants to behave with decorum, devote themselves to artistic production and avoid politics. By then, however, the political atmosphere had deteriorated, and the final debate (which was devoted to the theater and held in Kyiv on May 29 and Kharkiv from June 8 to 11, 1929) bore the character of an inquisition. During this debate the theater director Les Kurbas and the playwright Mykola Kulish faced a hostile gallery of condemnatory critics. By 1928, the party had closed down VAPLITE (the acronym for the Vilna Akademiia Proletarskoi Literatury; Free Academy of Proletarian Literature), an organization and eponymous journal that had conducted a vigorous critique of Soviet policy and party attitudes. The group’s leader Mykola Khvylovyi signed an admission of political errors and destroyed the second part of his controversial, still unpublished novel Valdshnepy (Woodsnipes, 1927). To many observers this was a signal that the tide had turned against the Ukrainization policy and the “national communists” who championed it. The show trials of 1928 signaled the beginning of a frontal attack on the entire Ukrainian intellectual and creative strata. The most famous of these trials took place in 1930. It was a kangaroo court staged in a public theater in Kharkiv, then the Ukrainian capital. Forty-five academics were accused of belonging to an underground counter-revolutionary organization, the Spilka Vyzvolennia Ukrainy (Union for the Liberation of Ukraine). The charges were entirely trumped-up and the forced confessions served as pretexts for a massive wave of arrests. By 1932–33, as collectivization, grain-requisitioning and hunger took four million lives, almost anyone could be accused of “bourgeois nationalism” and summarily executed or exiled to Siberia. Thousands of cultural activists met this fate. Skrypnyk, Khvylovyi and several other prominent Ukrainian communists committed suicide in 1933. Skrypnyk had stressed the parallel and equal development of Russian and Ukrainian languages and cultures in Ukraine. In his final years he had tried to continue Ukrainization by supporting, for example, the opening of Ukrainian theater and opera companies. However, when “local nationalism,” rather than “Russian great-nation chauvinism,” was singled out in 1928 as the principle enemy (a reversal of the stance taken in 1923) it was clear to all that a major shift in policy had occurred.\n\nAvant-gardists in the political cross-fire It was still possible in the mid-twenties to criticize imperialism and chauvinism as vestiges of tsarist rule, but attention to these issues began to draw\n\nPolitics and the Ukrainian Avant-Garde\n\nsharp rebukes from authorities, particularly in Ukraine. Mykola Kulish’s plays, which ridiculed psychological servility and contempt for Ukrainian culture as hangovers from imperial rule, produced an orchestrated response. Kurbas’s theater was closed in 1933 and the director disappeared in the gulag. At this time, Soviet Russia began “rediscovering” its own national history and traditions, revising, for example, its negative attitude toward imperial conquest, state expansion and Russian nationalism. Symptomatic of this reassessment was the enormous success, due to the sympathetic portrayal of tsarist forces, of Mikhail Bulgakov’s novel Belaia gvardiia (The White Guard, 1925) and his play Dni Turbinykh (Days of the Turbins, 1926) in the Moscow Art Theater, and the publication of Aleksei Tolstoi’s Petr Pervyi (Peter the First, 1929). The success of Kurbas and Kulish was part of the issue. In the years 1926–33 when they collaborated with the designer Vadym Meller and the composer Yurii Meitus, the Berezil Theater’s productions dazzled Kharkiv audiences, altering perceptions of Ukrainian culture. Berezil became the city’s leading theater. Entertaining, politically relevant and avant-garde, it eclipsed the achievements of Nikolai Sinelnikov in Kharkiv and Nikolai Solovtsov in Kyiv, the two Russian directors who had set the tone with their productions of Ibsen and Hauptmann. This was an unexpected and unwelcome development for those who had assumed that the Russian stage would be the sole producer of serious talent. In fact, after Kurbas’s theater was forcibly disbanded in 1933, the aging Sinelnikov was again instructed to head Kharkiv’s Russian theater—a symbolic attempt, it appeared to many, to restore pre-revolutionary Russian cultural hegemony (Revutskyi 1955, 17). Kurbas’s productions of Kulish’s “national trilogy”—the plays Narodnyi Malakhii (The People’s Malachii, 1929), Myna Mazailo (1929) and Sonata Pathétique (1930)—carried a forceful anti-colonial message. Here is how one viewer described their successes in 1931: The Ukrainian theater learned to mock the living lord [pan]. The theater used a language that cultured families of former Russian officialdom [chynushi] had employed only in barber-shops and at the Central Workers’ Cooperative. In the past, theater had tried to amuse the all-powerful russifiers, and had brought sentimental tears to the eyes of those who represented beekeeping/ melon-growing capitalists. Suddenly, this same theater recalled that Ukrainian carvers had once been the equals of the Venetians and dared to\n\n33\n\n34\n\nPolitics and Painting\n\ncompete with the theatrical culture of its time. Could Sinelnikov’s apologists forgive this? (Khmuryi 1948, 15)\n\nAccording to this account, the despised national backwardness was being presented in the theater as the product of national oppression and hegemonist views—attitudes that were still richly present in ruling circles. If we accept such an assessment, the role of the Ukrainian avant-garde should be seen as negotiating different views of modernity among viewers and audiences, attempting to create a new Soviet culture while nurturing a positive attitude toward Ukrainian culture. The dual imperatives of national and social change therefore gave the Ukrainian avant-garde a unique profile, but at the same time made its situation particularly complex.\n\nWith or without the past? The avant-garde’s aesthetico-cultural positions expressed a rejection of and simultaneously a dependence on links with the past. The struggle for the new involved eradicating aspects of tsarist rule, such as the colonizer’s contemptuous attitude and the local’s inferiority complex. Counterposed to this, however, was a celebration of the primitive and exotic, as thrilling to Ukrainian avant-gardists as the African and tribal was for French cubists. Moreover, for some an allure of the politically forbidden was attached to the repressed national past. There were avant-gardists who appeared to reject the past entirely. Mikhail Semenko and the futurists, for example, aligned themselves with those aspects of international modernism that embraced “rational” ways of perceiving and changing the world. They admired the analytical mind capable of dismantling and then recombining elements in a deliberate process. In the later twenties they were even attracted to the idea of humanity’s liberation from its own biological nature, an issue raised in Viktor Domontovych’s Doktor Serafikus (written in the twenties but published in 1947) and in Leonid Skrypnyk’s Intelihent (Intellectual, 1929). The subtext to this attraction was the belief that civilization could be transformed through a rational, planned process. However, the faith in political rationality and, even less, in forced radical social-biological experimentation was not widely shared. Most Ukrainian avant-gardists felt a stronger ownership of the “primitive,” to which in their opinion they had privileged access in their rich folk creativity. In Kharkiv, the capital of “proletarian” Ukraine, Maria Syniakova produced childlike paintings and sought inspiration in the tradition of tile\n\nPolitics and the Ukrainian Avant-Garde\n\npainting which dates back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She enjoyed presenting herself as an unschooled student of nature, although her entourage was sophisticated, including the poets Boris Pasternak and Velimir Khlebnikov, and the painter Mikhail Matiushin. Like Boichuk, Burliuk and Malevich, she linked her art to folk creativity. These artists were not depicting an encounter with a foreign Other, but rather were expressing admiration for the creativity of their “own” peasantry. A number of scholars have underscored the idea that European “primitivism” had a deeply ambivalent relationship with Western imperialism and capitalist modernity. It has been noted that Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon is riven by a conflict stemming from “an internal psychological division between attraction and repulsion, classical superego and primitive libido, and results in an aggressive attack on the image of women which may disguise a deep fear” (Butler 1994, 108–9). Richard Sheppard has argued that “whichever way one reads the painting, its violence and shock derive to a considerable extent from Picasso’s experience of the loss of tradition within which he had previously been able to work but which a part of him was trying, unsuccessfully, to retain” (Sheppard 2000, 28). The Ukrainian variant of primitivism did not suffer these complexes because it saw itself as rediscovering its own tradition. Its intimate relationship with primitivism is an additional reason why the leap to a conceptual and abstract art was quickly achieved by many artists in these years: color symbolism and simplified, abstract forms were already familiar to most artists from icon and folk art. As has been seen in the case of Exter, the search for inspiration in native traditions was also stimulated by the belief that Slavic civilizations displayed unique, non-Western features.\n\nDemocratic, multi-disciplinary spirit The Ukrainian avant-garde embraced a large range of Western cultural experiments. Osip Mandelshtam, while living alongside the Berezil company, noted that “in Berezil’s work there is something that is common to the work of all founders: it tries in the shortest possible time to give examples of the most varied genres, to outline all the possibilities, to master all the forms” (quoted in Hirniak 1982, 225). An exploration of Western cultural forms was linked to a strong belief among Ukrainians in democratic norms. One historian has argued that Ukraine’s political culture is defined by a Western attitude toward individual rights and the separation of church and state. For this reason its territories in the nineteenth century were the strongest supporters of\n\n35\n\n36\n\nPolitics and Painting\n\nliberalism and constitutionalism. By contrast, the grafting of Byzantine theocracy onto Muscovy, a state already organized along the lines of the Golden Horde, produced in Russia a political culture defined by a centralizing, despotic state (Lysiak-Rudnytskyi 1973, 15). The result, as more than one scholar has argued, was a Russian messianism that left its mark on the Slavophiles, the radical intelligentsia and the bolsheviks in the form of an inverted religiosity and maximalism (Sinyavsky 1990, 4–13). For this reason, it might be argued, the aggressive, maximalist-utopian strain was less prevalent in the Ukrainian avant-garde, even during the revolutionary years. A coexistence of different schools and tendencies could be observed in the art community, including the avant-garde: in the Academy of Arts formed in 1917–18 and in its later reincarnation as the (avant-gardist) Kyiv Art Institute during the 1920s, in the Berezil Theater’s deliberate policy of continual experimentation and their welcoming of all political groups, and in Boichuk’s collective and collaborative work within his studios of monumentalism.\n\nDeveloping a local idiom Myroslava Mudrak has argued that the Ukrainian avant-garde exhibited a principled localism, a determination to develop its own idiom out of locally available resources: The avant-garde art of Ukraine of the 1910s to 1930s was precariously hinged on an oscillating pendulum between the present and past, local traditions and cosmopolitan practices. Abstraction helped to identify the problematic and to explore and experiment with artistic systems that could direct this process into the future. What is avant-garde about Ukrainian art, then, is not its inventiveness in ‘breaking the mold’ but in its deliberate and conscious re-education and reformulation of art’s function in a national culture. By not placing novelty as a premium, but operating instead within the framework of the enduring qualities of tradition, the Ukrainian avant-garde made claims on the aesthetic past to restore it to the dignity deserving of a modernist present (Mudrak 2001, 29).\n\nThe tendency among Ukrainians was to make wider use of indigenous art forms and also to assert independence from cultural processes elsewhere, in both Russia and the West.\n\nPolitics and the Ukrainian Avant-Garde\n\nEscape from marginalization The utopian project of a reformed human nature did attract Ukrainians, but primarily as a way out of their political marginalization. The visionary dreamers of Kulish’s plays, Khvylovyi’s disillusioned revolutionaries, Volodymyr Vynnychenko’s attraction to “concordism,” Pavlo Krat’s utopian novel Koly ziishlo sontse (When the Sun Rose, 1913), or Dovzhenko’s Zvenyhora (1927)—all present unsatisfied yearnings for, or utopian projections of a reformed human order within which the Ukrainian nation is allowed to take its respected place alongside others. This no doubt formed a bedrock motivation for many avant-gardists and guided their concern with national and social emancipation. The combined revolutionary drives strengthened conviction that citadels of reaction required toppling, but also that individuals were free to borrow from an entire spectrum of liberationist currents in developing visions of an emancipated world. Freedom from imperialistic or chauvinistic attitudes played an important role in the avant-garde’s picture of a spiritually reformed humanity. Perhaps a particular fascination with human and universal energy, limitle"
