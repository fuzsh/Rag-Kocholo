        "text": "This article traces the histories of three Yiddish-language libraries in 1930s Paris. Through an analysis of borrowing practices, holdings, and events, this article illustrates how the libraries of the Kultur-lige and Medem-farband functioned as vectors of culture and politics in interwar Paris. These Yiddish libraries created public and communal spaces within which people from all corners of the Yiddish-speaking Parisian world could sit and learn about current events, literature, history, and politics.\n\nThe remnant of the eastern European Jews that arrived in Israel after the Holocaust established a vibrant center of Yiddish culture in Tel Aviv. This paper tells its story. It spotlights the uniqueness of the Tel Aviv center in comparison with similar cultural centers established by eastern European Jews in other cities around the world, both before and after the Holocaust. It portrays the Jewish cultural activists and leaders that composed the Tel Aviv Yiddish center, the special conditions that awaited them in Israel, the institutions that they established , and their aftermath. Finally, it considers the Tel Aviv Yiddish cultural center as a test case for examining the social role of the Jewish cultural center after the Holocaust. Avrom Sutzkever, 1 widely considered the last giant of modern Yiddish poetry, was the founder and editor of Di goldene keyt, the celebrated Yiddish literary journal published in Tel Aviv (from 1949 to 1995). The journal was widely read in centers of Yiddish culture throughout the world. In 1959, during a visit to Montreal, a vibrant center of Yiddish culture at the time, Sutzkever wrote a report to his colleague Mordkhe Tsanin, 2 the founder and editor of the Tel Aviv–based\n\nThis paper examines the writing of a little-known, but prolific interwar immigrant Eastern European Parisian Yiddish writer, Aron Beckerman, to demonstrate how Yiddish journalism played a pivotal role in defining Paris as a simultaneously French and Jewish space to immigrant Jews living in the city. Engaging urban historical theory on the communal-building effect that public space can have, this article argues that within Beckerman’s writings on Paris-its history and specific places within the city-we see a Paris emerge that details a universalist Republican identity, which, when read through a Jewish lens, leads simultaneously to a particular immigrant, Yiddish-speaking, leftist Jewish understanding of what it means to be \"French.\""
