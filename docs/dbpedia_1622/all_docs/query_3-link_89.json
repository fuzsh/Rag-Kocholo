        "text": "Helical waves in easy-plane antiferromagnets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSemenov, Yuriy G.; Li, Xi-Lai; Xu, Xinyi; Kim, Ki Wook\n\n2017-12-01\n\nEffective spin torques can generate the NÃ©el vector oscillations in antiferromagnets (AFMs). Here, it is theoretically shown that these torques applied at one end of a normal AFM strip can excite a helical type of spin wave in the strip whose properties are drastically different from characteristic spin waves. An analysis based on both a NÃ©el vector dynamical equation and the micromagnetic simulation identifies the direction of magnetic anisotropy and the damping factor as the two key parameters determining the dynamics. Helical wave propagation requires the hard axis of the easy-plane AFM to be aligned with the traveling direction, while the damping limits its spatial extent. If the damping is neglected, the calculation leads to a uniform periodic domain wall structure. On the other hand, finite damping decelerates the helical wave rotation around the hard axis, ultimately causing stoppage of its propagation along the strip. With the group velocity staying close to spin-wave velocity at the wave front, the wavelength becomes correspondingly longer away from the excitation point. In a sufficiently short strip, a steady-state oscillation can be established whose frequency is controlled by the waveguide length as well as the excitation energy or torque.\n\nMultiferroicity in the generic easy-plane triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO4)2\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWhite, J. S.; Niedermayer, Ch.; Gasparovic, G.; Broholm, C.; Park, J. M. S.; Shapiro, A. Ya.; Demianets, L. A.; Kenzelmann, M.\n\n2013-08-01\n\nRbFe(MoO4)2 is a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLA) that displays a zero-field magnetically driven multiferroic phase with a chiral spin structure. By inelastic neutron scattering, we determine quantitatively the spin Hamiltonian. We show that the easy-plane anisotropy is nearly 1/3 of the dominant spin exchange, making RbFe(MoO4)2 an excellent system for studying the physics of the model 2D easy-plane TLA. Our measurements demonstrate magnetic-field-induced fluctuations in this material to stabilize the generic finite-field phases of the 2D XY TLA. We further explain how Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions can generate ferroelectricity only in the zero-field phase. Our conclusion is that multiferroicity in RbFe(MoO4)2, and its absence at high fields, results from the generic properties of the 2D XY TLA.\n\nTransformation from an easy-plane to an easy-axis antiferromagnetic structure in the mixed rare-earth ferroborates Pr x Y1-x Fe3(BO3)4: magnetic properties and crystal field calculations.\n\nPubMed\n\nPankrats, A I; Demidov, A A; Ritter, C; Velikanov, D A; Semenov, S V; Tugarinov, V I; Temerov, V L; Gudim, I A\n\n2016-10-05\n\nThe magnetic structure of the mixed rare-earth system Pr x Y1-x Fe3(BO3)4 (xââ=ââ0.75, 0.67, 0.55, 0.45, 0.25) was studied via magnetic and resonance measurements. These data evidence the successive spin reorientation from the easy-axis antiferromagnetic structure formed in PrFe3(BO3)4 to the easy-plane one of YFe3(BO3)4 associated with the weakening of the magnetic anisotropy of the Pr subsystem due to its diamagnetic dilution by nonmagnetic Y. This reorientation occurs through the formation of an inclined magnetic structure, as was confirmed by our previous neutron research in the range of xââ=ââ0.67 Ã· 0.45. In the compounds with xââ=ââ0.75 and 0.67 whose magnetic structure is close to the easy-axis one, a two-step spin reorientation takes place in the magnetic field H||c. Such a peculiarity is explained by the formation of an interjacent inclined magnetic structure with magnetic moments of Fe ions located closer to the basal plane than in the initial state, with these intermediate states remaining stable in some ranges of the magnetic field. An approach based on a crystal field model for the Pr(3+) ion and the molecular-field approximation is used to describe the magnetic characteristics of the system Pr x Y1-x Fe3(BO3)4. With the parameters of the d-d and f-d exchange interactions, of the magnetic anisotropy of the iron subsystem and of the crystal field parameters of praseodymium thus determined, it is possible to achieve a good agreement between the experimental and calculated temperature and field dependences of the magnetization curves (up to 90 kOe) and magnetic susceptibilities (2-300âK).\n\nA separation of antiferromagnetic spin motion modes in the training effect of exchange biased Co/CoO film with in-plane anisotropy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, R.; Yun, C.; Ding, S. L.; Wen, X.; Liu, S. Q.; Wang, C. S.; Han, J. Z.; Du, H. L.; Yang, J. B.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe motion of antiferromagnetic interfacial spins is investigated through the temperature evolution of training effect in a Co/CoO film with in-plane biaxial anisotropy. Significant differences in the training effect and its temperature dependence are observed in the magnetic easy axis and hard axis (HA) and ascribed to the different motion modes of antiferromagnetic interfacial spins, the collective spin cluster rotation (CSR) and the single spin reversal (SSR), caused by different magnetization reversal modes of ferromagnetic layer. These motion modes of antiferromagnetic spins are successfully separated using a combination of an exponential function and a classic n-1/2 function. A larger CSR to SSR ratio and a shorter lifetime of CSR found in the HA indicates that the domain rotation in the ferromagnetic layer tends to activate and accelerate a CSR mode in the antiferromagnetic spins.\n\nMagnetic phase transition in Heisenberg antiferromagnetic films with easy-axis single-ion anisotropy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPan, Kok-Kwei\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe staggered susceptibility of spin-1 and spin-3/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet with easy-axis single-ion anisotropy on the cubic lattice films consisting of n=2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 interacting square lattice layers is studied by high-temperature series expansions. Sixth order series in J/kBT have been obtained for free-surface boundary conditions. The dependence of the NÃ©el temperature on film thickness n and easy-axis anisotropy D has been investigated. The shifts of the NÃ©el temperature from the bulk value can be described by a power law n with a shift exponent Î», where Î» is the inverse of the bulk correlation length exponent. The effect of easy-axis single-ion anisotropy on shift exponent of antiferromagnetic films has been studied. A comparison is made with related works. The results obtained are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of finite-size scaling theory.\n\nA separation of antiferromagnetic spin motion modes in the training effect of exchange biased Co/CoO film with in-plane anisotropy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWu, R.; Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0FS; Yun, C.\n\n2016-08-07\n\nThe motion of antiferromagnetic interfacial spins is investigated through the temperature evolution of training effect in a Co/CoO film with in-plane biaxial anisotropy.

We find that the resistivity is larger along an antiferromagnetically ordered direction than along a ferromagnetically ordered one, consistent with experimental observation. The anisotropic results are mainly contributed from Drude weight, whose behavior is attributed to Fermi surface topology of the ordered phase.\n\nMagnetic anisotropy in antiferromagnetic hexagonal MnTe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKriegner, D.; Reichlova, H.; Grenzer, J.; Schmidt, W.; Ressouche, E.; Godinho, J.; Wagner, T.; Martin, S. Y.; Shick, A. B.; Volobuev, V. V.; Springholz, G.; HolÃ½, V.; Wunderlich, J.; Jungwirth, T.; VÃ½bornÃ½, K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAntiferromagnetic hexagonal MnTe is a promising material for spintronic devices relying on the control of antiferromagnetic domain orientations. Here we report on neutron diffraction, magnetotransport, and magnetometry experiments on semiconducting epitaxial MnTe thin films together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the magnetic anisotropies. The easy axes of the magnetic moments within the hexagonal basal plane are determined to be along ã1 1 Â¯00 ã directions. The spin-flop transition and concomitant repopulation of domains in strong magnetic fields is observed. Using epitaxially induced strain the onset of the spin-flop transition changes from Ë2 to Ë0.5 T for films grown on InP and SrF2 substrates, respectively.\n\nMagnetic phase diagram and multiferroicity of Ba 3 MnNb 2 O 9 : A spin - 5 2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet with weak easy-axis anisotropy\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nLee, M.; Choi, E. S.; Huang, X.; ...\n\n2014-12-01\n\nHere we have performed magnetic, electric, thermal and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations on Ba 3MnNb 2 O 9. All results suggest that Ba 3MnNb 2 O 9 is a spin-5/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) with weak easy-axis anisotropy. At zero field, we observed a narrow two-step transition at T N1 = 3.4 K and T N2 = 3.0 K. The neutron diffraction measurement and the DFT calculation indicate a 120 spin structure in ab plane with out-of-plane canting at low temperatures. With increasing magnetic field, the 120 spin structure evolves intomoreÂ Â» up-up-down (uud) and oblique phases showing successive magnetic phase transitions, which fits well to the theoretical prediction for the 2D Heisenberg TLAF with classical spins. Ultimately, multiferroicity is observed when the spins are not collinear but suppressed in the uud and oblique phases.Â«Â less\n\nAntiferromagnetic Chern Insulators in Noncentrosymmetric Systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, Kun; Zhou, Sen; Dai, Xi; Wang, Ziqiang\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe investigate a new class of topological antiferromagnetic (AF) Chern insulators driven by electronic interactions in two-dimensional systems without inversion symmetry. Despite the absence of a net magnetization, AF Chern insulators (AFCI) possess a nonzero Chern number C and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Their existence is guaranteed by the bifurcation of the boundary line of Weyl points between a quantum spin Hall insulator and a topologically trivial phase with the emergence of AF long-range order. As a concrete example, we study the phase structure of the honeycomb lattice Kane-Mele model as a function of the inversion-breaking ionic potential and the Hubbard interaction. We find an easy z axis C =1 AFCI phase and a spin-flop transition to a topologically trivial x y plane collinear antiferromagnet. We propose experimental realizations of the AFCI and QAHE in correlated electron materials and cold atom systems.\n\nMagnetic properties of a quasi-two-dimensional S =1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet with distorted square lattice\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYamaguchi, Hironori; Tamekuni, Yusuke; Iwasaki, Yoshiki; Otsuka, Rei; Hosokoshi, Yuko; Kida, Takanori; Hagiwara, Masayuki\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWe successfully synthesize single crystals of the verdazyl radical Î± -2 ,3 ,5 -Cl3 -V. Ab initio molecular orbital calculations indicate that the two dominant antiferromagnetic interactions, J1 and J2 (Î± =J2/J1â0.56 ), form an S =1 /2 distorted square lattice. We explain the magnetic properties based on the S =1 /2 square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet using the quantum Monte Carlo method, and examine the effects of the lattice distortion and the interplane interaction contribution. In the low-temperature regions below 6.4 K, we observe anisotropic magnetic behavior accompanied by a phase transition to a magnetically ordered state. The electron spin resonance signals exhibit anisotropic behavior in the temperature dependence of the resonance field and the linewidth. We explain the frequency dependence of the resonance fields in the ordered phase using a mean-field approximation with out-of-plane easy-axis anisotropy, which causes a spin-flop phase transition at approximately 0.4 T for the field perpendicular to the plane. Furthermore, the anisotropic dipole field provides supporting information regarding the presence of the easy-axis anisotropy. These results demonstrate that the lattice distortion, anisotropy, and interplane interaction of this model are sufficiently small that they do not affect the intrinsic behavior of the S =1 /2 square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet.\n\nWalls, anomalies, and deconfinement in quantum antiferromagnets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKomargodski, Zohar; Sulejmanpasic, Tin; Ãnsal, Mithat\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe consider the Abelian-Higgs model in 2 +1 dimensions with instanton-monopole defects. This model is closely related to the phases of quantum antiferromagnets. In the presence of Z2 preserving monopole operators, there are two confining ground states in the monopole phase, corresponding to the valence bond solid (VBS) phase of quantum magnets. We show that the domain wall carries a 't Hooft anomaly in this case. The anomaly can be saturated by, e.g., charge-conjugation breaking on the wall or by the domain wall theory becoming gapless (a gapless model that saturates the anomaly is S U (2) 1 WZW). Either way the fundamental scalar particles (i.e., spinons) which are confined in the bulk are deconfined on the domain wall. This Z2 phase can be realized either with spin-1/2 on a rectangular lattice or spin-1 on a square lattice. In both cases the domain wall contains spin-1/2 particles (which are absent in the bulk). We discuss the possible relation to recent lattice simulations of domain walls in VBS. We further generalize the discussion to Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olsen (ANO) vortices in a dual superconductor of the Abelian-Higgs model in 3 +1 dimensions and to the easy-plane limit of antiferromagnets. In the latter case the wall can undergo a variant of the BKT transition (consistent with the anomalies) while the bulk is still gapped. The same is true for the easy-axis limit of antiferromagnets. We also touch upon some analogies to Yang-Mills theory.\n\nVoltage Control of Antiferromagnetic Phases at Near-Terahertz Frequencies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarra, Anthony; Domann, John; Kim, Ki Wook; Carman, Greg\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA method to control antiferromagnetism using voltage-induced strain is proposed and theoretically examined. Voltage-induced magnetoelastic anisotropy is shown to provide sufficient torque to switch an antiferromagnetic domain 90Â° either from out of plane to in plane or between in-plane axes. Numerical results indicate that strain-mediated antiferromagnetic switching can occur in an 80-nm nanopatterned disk at frequencies approaching 1 THz but that the switching speed heavily depends on the system's mechanical design. Furthermore, the energy cost to induce magnetic switching is only 450 aJ, indicating that magnetoelastic control of antiferromagnetism is substantially more energy efficient than other approaches.\n\nIn-plane magnetic anisotropy in strontium iridate S r2Ir O4\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNauman, Muhammad; Hong, Yunjeong; Hussain, Tayyaba; Seo, M. S.; Park, S. Y.; Lee, N.; Choi, Y. J.; Kang, Woun; Jo, Younjung\n\n2017-10-01\n\nMagnetic anisotropy in strontium iridate (S r2Ir O4 ) is found to be large because of the strong spin-orbit interactions. In our work, we studied the in-plane magnetic anisotropy of S r2Ir O4 and traced the anisotropic exchange interactions between the isospins in the crystal. The magnetic-field-dependent torque Ï(H ) showed a prominent transition from the canted antiferromagnetic state to the weak ferromagnetic (WFM) state. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to examine the isotropic and anisotropic regimes and probe the easy magnetization axis along the a b plane. The angle-dependent torque Ï(Î¸) revealed a deviation from the sinusoidal behavior, and small differences in hysteresis were observed around 0Â° and 90Â° in the low-magnetic-field regime. This indicates that the orientation of the easy axis of the FM component is along the b axis, where the antiferromagnetic to WFM spin-flop transition occurs. We compared the coefficients of the magnetic susceptibility tensors and captured the anisotropy of the material. The in-plane Ï(Î¸) revealed a tendency toward isotropic behavior for fields with values above the field value of the WFM transition.\n\nMagnetic Anisotropy by Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling in Antiferromagnetic Thin Films\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIeda, Jun'ichi; Barnes, Stewart E.; Maekawa, Sadamichi\n\n2018-05-01\n\nMagnetic anisotropy in an antiferromagnet (AFM) with inversion symmetry breaking (ISB) is investigated. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) resulting from the Rashba spin-orbit and s-d type exchange interactions is determined for two different models of AFMs. The global ISB model, representing the effect of a surface, an interface, or a gating electric field, results in an easy-plane magnetic anisotropy. In contrast, for a local ISB model, i.e., for a noncentrosymmetric AFM, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) arises. Both results differ from the ferromagnetic case, in which the result for PMA depends on the band structure and dimensionality. These MAE contributions play a key role in determining the direction of the NÃ©el order parameter in antiferromagnetic nanostructures, and reflect the possibility of electrical-field control of the NÃ©el vector.\n\nAntiferromagnetic spin Seebeck effect.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWu, Stephen M.; Zhang, Wei; KC, Amit\n\n2016-03-03\n\nWe report on the observation of the spin Seebeck effect in antiferromagnetic MnF2. A device scale on-chip heater is deposited on a bilayer of MnF2 (110) (30nm)/Pt (4 nm) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a MgF2(110) substrate. Using Pt as a spin detector layer, it is possible to measure the thermally generated spin current from MnF2 through the inverse spin Hall effect. The low temperature (2â80 K) and high magnetic field (up to 140 kOe) regime is explored. A clear spin-flop transition corresponding to the sudden rotation of antiferromagnetic spins out of the easy axis is observed in themoreÂ Â» spin Seebeck signal when large magnetic fields (>9T) are applied parallel to the easy axis of the MnF2 thin film. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the easy axis, the spin-flop transition is absent, as expected.Â«Â less\n\nAntiferromagnetic Spin Seebeck Effect\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, Stephen M.; Zhang, Wei; KC, Amit; Borisov, Pavel; Pearson, John E.; Jiang, J.

The magnetic phase diagram of Fe xNi 1-xF 2 epitaxial thin films with true random single-ion anisotropy was deduced from magnetometry and neutron scattering measurements and analyzed using mean field theory. Regions with uniaxial, oblique and easy plane anisotropies were identified. A RMA-induced glass region was discovered where a Griffiths-like breakdown of long-range spin order occurs.\n\nStrong Orientation-Dependent Spin-Orbit Torque in Thin Films of the Antiferromagnet Mn2Au\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, X. F.; Zhang, J.; Li, F.; Chen, X. Z.; Shi, G. Y.; Tan, Y. Z.; Gu, Y. D.; Saleem, M. S.; Wu, H. Q.; Pan, F.; Song, C.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAntiferromagnets with zero net magnetic moment, strong anti-interference, and ultrafast switching speed are potentially competitive in high-density information storage. The body-centered tetragonal antiferromagnet Mn2Au with opposite-spin sublattices is a unique metallic material for NÃ©el-order spin-orbit-torque (SOT) switching. We investigate the SOT switching in quasiepitaxial (103), (101) and (204) Mn2Au films prepared by a simple magnetron sputtering method. We demonstrate current-induced antiferromagnetic moment switching in all of the prepared Mn2Au films by using a short current pulse at room temperature, whereas differently oriented films exhibit distinguished switching characters. A direction-independent reversible switching is attained in Mn2Au (103) films due to negligible magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, while for Mn2Au (101) and (204) films, the switching is invertible with the current applied along the in-plane easy axis and its vertical axis, but it becomes attenuated seriously during initial switching circles when the current is applied along the hard axis because of the existence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. Besides the fundamental significance, the strong orientation-dependent SOT switching, which is not realized, irrespective of ferromagnet and antiferromagnet, provides versatility for spintronics.\n\nAntiferromagnetic nano-oscillator in external magnetic fields\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheciÅski, Jakub; Frankowski, Marek; Stobiecki, Tomasz\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe describe the dynamics of an antiferromagnetic nano-oscillator in an external magnetic field of any given time distribution. The oscillator is powered by a spin current originating from spin-orbit effects in a neighboring heavy metal layer and is capable of emitting a THz signal in the presence of an additional easy-plane anisotropy. We derive an analytical formula describing the interaction between such a system and an external field, which can affect the output signal character. Interactions with magnetic pulses of different shapes, with a sinusoidal magnetic field and with a sequence of rapidly changing magnetic fields are discussed. We also perform numerical simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-transfer torque effects to verify the obtained results and find a very good quantitative agreement between analytical and numerical predictions.\n\nSpin pumping and inverse spin Hall voltages from dynamical antiferromagnets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJohansen, Ãyvind; Brataas, Arne\n\n2017-06-01\n\nDynamical antiferromagnets can pump spins into adjacent conductors. The high antiferromagnetic resonance frequencies represent a challenge for experimental detection, but magnetic fields can reduce these resonance frequencies. We compute the ac and dc inverse spin Hall voltages resulting from dynamical spin excitations as a function of a magnetic field along the easy axis and the polarization of the driving ac magnetic field perpendicular to the easy axis. We consider the insulating antiferromagnets MnF2,FeF2, and NiO. Near the spin-flop transition, there is a significant enhancement of the dc spin pumping and inverse spin Hall voltage for the uniaxial antiferromagnets MnF2 and FeF2. In the uniaxial antiferromagnets it is also found that the ac spin pumping is independent of the external magnetic field when the driving field has the optimal circular polarization. In the biaxial NiO, the voltages are much weaker, and there is no spin-flop enhancement of the dc component.\n\nTerahertz-Frequency Spin Hall Auto-oscillator Based on a Canted Antiferromagnet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSulymenko, O. R.; Prokopenko, O. V.; Tiberkevich, V. S.; Slavin, A. N.; Ivanov, B. A.; Khymyn, R. S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe propose a design of a terahertz-frequency signal generator based on a layered structure consisting of a current-driven platinum (Pt) layer and a layer of an antiferromagnet (AFM) with easy-plane anisotropy, where the magnetization vectors of the AFM sublattices are canted inside the easy plane by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). The dc electric current flowing in the Pt layer creates due to the spin Hall effect, a perpendicular spin current that, being injected in the AFM layer, tilts the DMI-canted AFM sublattices out of the easy plane, thus exposing them to the action of a strong internal exchange magnetic field of the AFM. The sublattice magnetizations, along with the small net magnetization vector mDMI of the canted AFM, start to rotate about the hard anisotropy axis of the AFM with the terahertz frequency proportional to the injected spin current and the AFM exchange field. The rotation of the small net magnetization mDMI results in the terahertz-frequency dipolar radiation that can be directly received by an adjacent (e.g., dielectric) resonator. We demonstrate theoretically that the radiation frequencies in the range f =0.05 - 2 THz are possible at the experimentally reachable magnitudes of the driving current density, and we evaluate the power of the signal radiated into different types of resonators. This power increases with the increase of frequency f , and it can exceed 1 Î¼ W at f Ë0.5 THz for a typical dielectric resonator of the electric permittivity É Ë10 and a quality factor Q Ë750 .\n\nDuality and the universality class of the three-state Potts antiferromagnet on plane quadrangulations.\n\nPubMed\n\nLv, Jian-Ping; Deng, Youjin; Jacobsen, Jesper Lykke; Salas, JesÃºs; Sokal, Alan D\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe provide a criterion based on graph duality to predict whether the three-state Potts antiferromagnet on a plane quadrangulation has a zero- or finite-temperature critical point, and its universality class. The former case occurs for quadrangulations of self-dual type, and the zero-temperature critical point has central charge c=1. The latter case occurs for quadrangulations of non-self-dual type, and the critical point belongs to the universality class of the three-state Potts ferromagnet. We have tested this criterion against high-precision computations on four lattices of each type, with very good agreement. We have also found that the Wang-Swendsen-KoteckÃ½ algorithm has no critical slowing-down in the former case, and critical slowing-down in the latter.\n\nDuality and the universality class of the three-state Potts antiferromagnet on plane quadrangulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLv, Jian-Ping; Deng, Youjin; Jacobsen, Jesper Lykke; Salas, JesÃºs; Sokal, Alan D.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe provide a criterion based on graph duality to predict whether the three-state Potts antiferromagnet on a plane quadrangulation has a zero- or finite-temperature critical point, and its universality class.

The particular example most fully studied has a bcc/bct lattice structure with a fully compensated (110) interface plane. Only bilinear Heisenberg exchange was assumed, with anisotropy only in the antiferromagnet. In spite of the intuitive notion that exchange coupling between a ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet across a fully compensated plane of the antiferromagnet should be zero, we find strong coupling, comparable to the bilinear exchange, with a 90Â° angle between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic axes of layers far from the interface in absence of an applied field. Even though the 90Â° coupling has characteristics resembling \"biquadratic\" exchange, it originates entirely from frustrated bilinear exchange. The development of exchange bias is found to originate from the formation of a domain wall in the antiferromagnet via the strong 90Â° exchange coupling and pinning of the wall by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the antiferromagnet. Because the large demagnetizing factor of the ferromagnet tends to confine its magnetization to the plane, the exchange bias is found to depend mainly on the strength and the symmetry of the in-plane component of anisotropy. Although little effort was made to analyze specific systems, the model reproduces many of the qualitative features observed in real exchange bias systems and gives reasonable semiquantitative estimates for the bias field when exchange and anisotropy values consistent with real systems are used.\n\nThermodynamic and critical properties of an antiferromagnetically stacked triangular Ising antiferromagnet in a field\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÅ½ukoviÄ, M.; BorovskÃ½, M.; BobÃ¡k, A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe study a stacked triangular lattice Ising model with both intra- and inter-plane antiferromagnetic interactions in a field, by Monte Carlo simulation. We find only one phase transition from a paramagnetic to a partially disordered phase, which is of second order and 3D XY universality class. At low temperatures we identify two highly degenerate phases: at smaller (larger) fields the system shows long-range ordering in the stacking direction (within planes) but not in the planes (stacking direction). Nevertheless, crossovers to these phases do not have a character of conventional phase transitions but rather linear-chain-like excitations.\n\nSpin transfer torque in antiferromagnetic spin valves: From clean to disordered regimes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaidaoui, Hamed Ben Mohamed; Manchon, Aurelien; Waintal, Xavier\n\n2014-05-01\n\nCurrent-driven spin torques in metallic spin valves composed of antiferromagnets are theoretically studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function method implemented on a tight-binding model. We focus our attention on G-type and L-type antiferromagnets in both clean and disordered regimes. In such structures, spin torques can either rotate the magnetic order parameter coherently (coherent torque) or compete with the internal antiferromagnetic exchange (exchange torque). We show that, depending on the symmetry of the spin valve, the coherent and exchange torques can either be in the plane, ânÃ(qÃn) or out of the plane ânÃq, where q and n are the directions of the order parameter of the polarizer and the free antiferromagnetic layers, respectively. Although disorder conserves the symmetry of the torques, it strongly reduces the torque magnitude, pointing out the need for momentum conservation to ensure strong spin torque in antiferromagnetic spin valves.\n\nAntiferromagnetic THz-frequency Josephson-like Oscillator Driven by Spin Current.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhymyn, Roman; Lisenkov, Ivan; Tiberkevich, Vasyl; Ivanov, Boris A; Slavin, Andrei\n\n2017-03-06\n\nThe development of compact and tunable room temperature sources of coherent THz-frequency signals would open a way for numerous new applications. The existing approaches to THz-frequency generation based on superconductor Josephson junctions (JJ), free electron lasers, and quantum cascades require cryogenic temperatures or/and complex setups, preventing the miniaturization and wide use of these devices. We demonstrate theoretically that a bi-layer of a heavy metal (Pt) and a bi-axial antiferromagnetic (AFM) dielectric (NiO) can be a source of a coherent THz signal. A spin-current flowing from a DC-current-driven Pt layer and polarized along the hard AFM anisotropy axis excites a non-uniform in time precession of magnetizations sublattices in the AFM, due to the presence of a weak easy-plane AFM anisotropy. The frequency of the AFM oscillations varies in the range of 0.1-2.0âTHz with the driving current in the Pt layer from 10 8 âA/cm 2 to 10 9 âA/cm 2 . The THz-frequency signal from the AFM with the amplitude exceeding 1âV/cm is picked up by the inverse spin-Hall effect in Pt. The operation of a room-temperature AFM THz-frequency oscillator is similar to that of a cryogenic JJ oscillator, with the energy of the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy playing the role of the Josephson energy.\n\nAntiferromagnetic THz-frequency Josephson-like Oscillator Driven by Spin Current\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhymyn, Roman; Lisenkov, Ivan; Tiberkevich, Vasyl; Ivanov, Boris A.; Slavin, Andrei\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe development of compact and tunable room temperature sources of coherent THz-frequency signals would open a way for numerous new applications.

Theses two modes, distinguished by their opposite polarization and available only in antiferromagnets, give rise to a novel degree of freedom to encode and process information. We show that the spin wave polarization can be manipulated by an electric field induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and magnetic anisotropy. We propose a prototype spin wave field effect transistor which realizes a gate-tunable magnonic analog of the Faraday effect, and demonstrate its application in THz signal modulation. In conclusion, our findings open up the exciting possibilitymoreÂ Â» of digital data processing utilizing antiferromagnetic spin waves and enable the direct projection of optical computing concepts onto the mesoscopic scale.Â«Â less\n\nMagnonic analog of relativistic Zitterbewegung in an antiferromagnetic spin chain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Weiwei; Gu, Chenjie; Zhou, Yan; Fangohr, Hans\n\n2017-07-01\n\nWe theoretically investigate the spin-wave (magnon) excitations in a classical antiferromagnetic spin chain with easy-axis anisotropy. We obtain a Dirac-like equation by linearizing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in this antiferromagnetic system, in contrast to the ferromagnetic system in which a SchrÃ¶dinger-type equation is derived. The Hamiltonian operator in the Dirac-like equation is a pseudo-Hermitian. We compute and demonstrate relativistic Zitterbewegung (trembling motion) in the antiferromagnetic spin chain by measuring the expectation values of the wave-packet position.\n\nNon-volatile logic gates based on planar Hall effect in magnetic films with two in-plane easy axes.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Sangyeop; Bac, Seul-Ki; Choi, Seonghoon; Lee, Hakjoon; Yoo, Taehee; Lee, Sanghoon; Liu, Xinyu; Dobrowolska, M; Furdyna, Jacek K\n\n2017-04-25\n\nWe discuss the use of planar Hall effect (PHE) in a ferromagnetic GaMnAs film with two in-plane easy axes as a means for achieving novel logic functionalities. We show that the switching of magnetization between the easy axes in a GaMnAs film depends strongly on the magnitude of the current flowing through the film due to thermal effects that modify its magnetic anisotropy. Planar Hall resistance in a GaMnAs film with two in-plane easy axes shows well-defined maxima and minima that can serve as two binary logic states. By choosing appropriate magnitudes of the input current for the GaMnAs Hall device, magnetic logic functions can then be achieved. Specifically, non-volatile logic functionalities such as AND, OR, NAND, and NOR gates can be obtained in such a device by selecting appropriate initial conditions. These results, involving a simple PHE device, hold promise for realizing programmable logic elements in magnetic electronics.\n\nCurrent polarity-dependent manipulation of antiferromagnetic domains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWadley, Peter; Reimers, Sonka; Grzybowski, Michal J.; Andrews, Carl; Wang, Mu; Chauhan, Jasbinder S.; Gallagher, Bryan L.; Campion, Richard P.; Edmonds, Kevin W.; Dhesi, Sarnjeet S.; Maccherozzi, Francesco; Novak, Vit; Wunderlich, Joerg; Jungwirth, Tomas\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAntiferromagnets have several favourable properties as active elements in spintronic devices, including ultra-fast dynamics, zero stray fields and insensitivity to external magnetic fields1. Tetragonal CuMnAs is a testbed system in which the antiferromagnetic order parameter can be switched reversibly at ambient conditions using electrical currents2. In previous experiments, orthogonal in-plane current pulses were used to induce 90Â° rotations of antiferromagnetic domains and demonstrate the operation of all-electrical memory bits in a multi-terminal geometry3. Here, we demonstrate that antiferromagnetic domain walls can be manipulated to realize stable and reproducible domain changes using only two electrical contacts. This is achieved by using the polarity of the current to switch the sign of the current-induced effective field acting on the antiferromagnetic sublattices. The resulting reversible domain and domain wall reconfigurations are imaged using X-ray magnetic linear dichroism microscopy, and can also be detected electrically. Switching by domain-wall motion can occur at much lower current densities than those needed for coherent domain switching.\n\nCluster-Glass Phase in Pyrochlore X Y Antiferromagnets with Quenched Disorder\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAndrade, Eric C.; Hoyos, JosÃ© A.; Rachel, Stephan; Vojta, Matthias\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe study the impact of quenched disorder (random exchange couplings or site dilution) on easy-plane pyrochlore antiferromagnets. In the clean system, order by disorder selects a magnetically ordered state from a classically degenerate manifold. In the presence of randomness, however, different orders can be chosen locally depending on details of the disorder configuration. Using a combination of analytical considerations and classical Monte Carlo simulations, we argue that any long-range-ordered magnetic state is destroyed beyond a critical level of randomness where the system breaks into magnetic domains due to random exchange anisotropies, becoming, therefore, a glass of spin clusters, in accordance with the available experimental data. These random anisotropies originate from off-diagonal exchange couplings in the microscopic Hamiltonian, establishing their relevance to other magnets with strong spin-orbit coupling.\n\nContinual model of magnetic dynamics for antiferromagnetic particles in analyzing size effects on Morin transition in hematite nanoparticles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMishchenko, I.; Chuev, M.; Kubrin, S.; Lastovina, T.; Polyakov, V.; Soldatov, A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAlternative explanation to the effect of disappearance of the Morin transition on hematite nanoparticles with their size decreasing is proposed basing on an idea of the predominant role of the shape anisotropy for nanosize particles. Three types of the magnetic structure of hematite nanoparticles with various sizes are found by MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy: coexistence of the well-pronounced antiferromagnetic and weakly ferromagnetic phases for particles with average diameters of about 55 nm, non-uniform distribution of the magnetization axes which concentrate on the vicinity of the basal plane (111) for prolonged particles with cross sections of about 20 nm, and uniform distribution of the easy axes in regard to the crystalline directions for 3-nm particles. Description of the temperature evolution of experimental data within novel model of the magnetic dynamics for antiferromagnetic particles which accounts the exchange, relativistic, and anisotropy interactions is provided, and the structural as well as energy characteristics of the studied systems are reconstructed.\n\nMagnetic ground state of the Ising-like antiferromagnet DyScO 3\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWu, L. S.; Nikitin, Stanislav E.; Frontzek, Matthias D.\n\n2017-10-05\n\nHere, we report on the low-temperature magnetic properties of the DyScO3 perovskite, which were characterized by means of single crystal and powder neutron scattering, and by magnetization measurements. Below T N = 3.15 K, Dy 3+ moments form an antiferromagnetic structure with an easy axis of magnetization lying in the ab plane. The magnetic moments are inclined at an angle of ~ Â±28Â° to the b axis. We show that the ground-state Kramers doublet of Dy 3+ is made up of primarily |Â±15/2> eigenvectors and well separated by a crystal field from the first excited state at E 1 =moreÂ Â» 24.9 meV. This leads to an extreme Ising single-ion anisotropy, M â¥/M â¥~0.05. The transverse magnetic fluctuations, which are proportional to M 2 â¥/M 2 â¥, are suppressed, and only moment fluctuations along the local Ising direction are allowed. We also found that the Dy-Dy dipolar interactions along the crystallographic c axis are two to four times larger than in-plane interactions.Â«Â less\n\nMagnetic quantum oscillations in doped antiferromagnets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKabanov, V. V.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nEnergy spectrum of electrons (holes) doped into two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors is quantized in an external magnetic field of arbitrary direction. A peculiar dependence of de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) magneto-oscillation amplitudes on the azimuthal in-plane angle from the magnetization direction and on the polar angle from the out-of-plane direction is found. The angular dependence of the amplitude is different if the measurements are performed in the field above and below of the spin-flop field.\n\nCurrentless reversal of NÃ©el vector in antiferromagnets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSemenov, Yuriy; Li, Xilai; Kim, Ki Wook\n\nThe bias driven perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is a magneto-electric effect that can realize 900 magnetization rotation and even 1800 flip along the easy axis in the ferromagnets with a minimal energy consumption. This study theoretically demonstrates a similar phenomenon of the NÃ©el vector reversal via a short electrical pulse that can mediate perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the antiferromagnets. The analysis based on the dynamical equations as well as the micromagnetic simulations reveals the important role of the inertial behavior in the antiferromagnets that facilitates the NÃ©el vector to overcome the barrier between two free-energy minima of the bistable states along the easy axis. In contrast to the ferromagnets, this NÃ©el vector reversal does not accompany angular moment transfer to the environment, leading to acceleration in the dynamical response by a few orders of magnitude. Further, a small switching energy requirement of a few attojoules illustrates an added advantage of the phenomenon in low-power spintronic applications.\n\nContinuous Easy-Plane Deconfined Phase Transition on the Kagome Lattice\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Xue-Feng; He, Yin-Chen; Eggert, Sebastian; Moessner, Roderich; Pollmann, Frank\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe use large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study an extended Hubbard model of hard core bosons on the kagome lattice. In the limit of strong nearest-neighbor interactions at 1 /3 filling, the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations leads to a valence bond solid ground state. The system undergoes a quantum phase transition to a superfluid phase as the interaction strength is decreased. It is still under debate whether the transition is weakly first order or represents an unconventional continuous phase transition. We present a theory in terms of an easy plane noncompact C P1 gauge theory describing the phase transition at 1 /3 filling. Utilizing large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations with parallel tempering in the canonical ensemble up to 15552 spins, we provide evidence that the phase transition is continuous at exactly 1 /3 filling. A careful finite size scaling analysis reveals an unconventional scaling behavior hinting at deconfined quantum criticality.\n\nSpin-dependent transport in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMerodio, P.; Kalitsov, A.; BÃ©a, H.; Baltz, V.; Chshiev, M.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWe investigate the behaviour of spin transfer torque (STT) and tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) in epitaxial antiferromagnetic-based tunnel junctions using tight binding calculations in the framework of the Keldysh formalism. We find that the STT out-of-plane component exhibits a staggered spatial distribution similar to its in-plane component. This behaviour is specific to the use of a tunnel barrier and significantly differs from the out-of-plane torques reported in previous works using a metallic spacer. Additionally, we show that unlike conventional ferromagnetic-based tunnel junctions, the TMR can increase with applied bias and reach values comparable to typical magnetoresistances found for usual spin valves.\n\nThree-dimensional spin mapping of antiferromagnetic nanopyramids having spatially alternating surface anisotropy at room temperature.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Kangkang; Smith, Arthur R\n\n2012-11-14\n\nAntiferromagnets play a key role in modern spintronic devices owing to their ability to modify the switching behavior of adjacent ferromagnets via the exchange bias effect. Consequently, detailed measurements of the spin structure at antiferromagnetic interfaces and surfaces are highly desirable, not only for advancing technologies but also for enabling new insights into the underlying physics. Here using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy at room-temperature, we reveal in three-dimensions an orthogonal spin structure on antiferromagnetic compound nanopyramids. Contrary to expected uniaxial anisotropy based on bulk properties, the atomic terraces are found to have alternating in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropies. The observed layer-wise alternation in anisotropy could have strong influences on future nanoscale spintronic applications.\n\nNoncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn3Sn films\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarkou, A.; Taylor, J.

P.; Felser, C.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nNoncollinear hexagonal antiferromagnets with almost zero net magnetization were recently shown to demonstrate giant anomalous Hall effect. Here, we present the structural and magnetic properties of noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn3Sn thin films heteroepitaxially grown on Y:ZrO2 (111) substrates with a Ru underlayer. The Mn3Sn films were crystallized in the hexagonal D 019 structure with c -axis preferred (0001) crystal orientation. The Mn3Sn films are discontinuous, forming large islands of approximately 400 nm in width, but are chemical homogeneous and characterized by near perfect heteroepitaxy. Furthermore, the thin films show weak ferromagnetism with an in-plane uncompensated magnetization of M =34 kA/m and coercivity of Î¼0Hc=4.0 mT at room temperature. Additionally, the exchange bias effect was studied in Mn3Sn /Py bilayers. Exchange bias fields up to Î¼0HEB=12.6 mT can be achieved at 5 K. These results show Mn3Sn films to be an attractive material for applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics.\n\nSpin Nernst effect of magnons in collinear antiferromagnets\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCheng, Ran; Okamoto, Satoshi; Xiao, Di\n\n2016-11-15\n\nIn a collinear antiferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy, symmetry guarantees that the spin wave modes are doubly degenerate. The two modes carry opposite spin angular momentum and exhibit opposite chirality. Using a honeycomb antiferromagnet in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we show that a longitudinal temperature gradient can drive the two modes to opposite transverse directions, realizing a spin Nernst effect of magnons with vanishing thermal Hall current. We find that magnons around themoreÂ Â» $$\\\\Gamma$$ point and the $K$ point contribute oppositely to the transverse spin transport, and their competition leads to a sign change of the spin Nernst coefficient at finite temperature. As a result, possible material candidates are discussed.Â«Â less\n\nMagnetic Interaction in the Geometrically Frustrated Triangular LatticeAntiferromagnet CuFeO2\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYe, Feng; Fernandez-Baca, Jaime A; Fishman, Randy Scott\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe spin wave excitations of the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLA) CuFeO2 have been measured using high resolution inelastic neutron scattering. Antiferromagnetic interactions up to third nearest neighbors in the ab plane (J1, J2, J3, with J2=J1 0:44 and J3=J1 0:57), as well as out-of-plane coupling (Jz, with Jz=J1 0:29) are required to describe the spin wave dispersion relations, indicating a three dimensional character of the magnetic interactions. Two energy deeps in the spin wave dispersion occur at the incommensurate wavevectors associated with multiferroic phase, and can be interpreted as dynamic precursors to the magnetoelectric behavior in this system.\n\nIsotope effect in quasi-two-dimensional metal-organic antiferromagnets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGoddard, P.

A.\n\n2008-08-01\n\nAlthough the isotope effect in superconducting materials is well documented, changes in the magnetic properties of antiferromagnets due to isotopic substitution are seldom discussed and remain poorly understood. This is perhaps surprising given the possible link between the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases of the layered cuprates. Here we report the experimental observation of shifts in the NÃ©el temperature and critical magnetic fields (ÎTN/TNâ4%;ÎBc/Bcâ4%) in a Q2D organic molecular antiferromagnet on substitution of hydrogen for deuterium. These compounds are characterized by strong hydrogen bonds through which the dominant superexchange is mediated. We evaluate how the in-plane and interplane exchange energies evolve as the atoms of hydrogen on different ligands are substituted, and suggest a possible mechanism for this effect in terms of the relative exchange efficiency of hydrogen and deuterium bonds.\n\nA six-coordinate ytterbium complex exhibiting easy-plane anisotropy and field-induced single-ion magnet behavior.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Jun-Liang; Yuan, Kang; Leng, Ji-Dong; Ungur, Liviu; Wernsdorfer, Wolfgang; Guo, Fu-Sheng; Chibotaru, Liviu F; Tong, Ming-Liang\n\n2012-08-06\n\nThe field-induced blockage of magnetization behavior was first observed in an Yb(III)-based molecule with a trigonally distorted octahedral coordination environment. Ab initio calculations and micro-SQUID measurements were performed to demonstrate the exhibition of easy-plane anisotropy, suggesting the investigated complex is the first pure lanthanide field-induced single-ion magnet (field-induced SIM) of this type. Furthermore, we found the relaxation time obeys a power law instead of an exponential law, indicating that the relaxation process should be involved a direct process rather than an Orbach process.\n\nTopological antiferromagnetic spintronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÅ mejkal, Libor; Mokrousov, Yuriy; Yan, Binghai; MacDonald, Allan H.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe recent demonstrations of electrical manipulation and detection of antiferromagnetic spins have opened up a new chapter in the story of spintronics. Here, we review the emerging research field that is exploring the links between antiferromagnetic spintronics and topological structures in real and momentum space. Active topics include proposals to realize Majorana fermions in antiferromagnetic topological superconductors, to control topological protection and Dirac points by manipulating antiferromagnetic order parameters, and to exploit the anomalous and topological Hall effects of zero-net-moment antiferromagnets. We explain the basic concepts behind these proposals, and discuss potential applications of topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.\n\nEasy plane baby Skyrmions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJÃ¤ykkÃ¤, Juha; Speight, Martin\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe baby Skyrme model is studied with a novel choice of potential, V=(1)/(2)Ï32. This âeasy planeâ potential vanishes at the equator of the target two-sphere. Hence, in contrast to previously studied cases, the boundary value of the field breaks the residual SO(2) internal symmetry of the model. Consequently, even the unit charge Skyrmion has only discrete symmetry and consists of a bound state of two half lumps. A model of long-range inter-Skyrmion forces is developed wherein a unit Skyrmion is pictured as a single scalar dipole inducing a massless scalar field tangential to the vacuum manifold. This model has the interesting feature that the two-Skyrmion interaction energy depends only on the average orientation of the dipoles relative to the line joining them. Its qualitative predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations. Global energy minimizers of charges B=1,â¦,14,18,32 are found numerically. Up to charge B=6, the minimizers have 2B half lumps positioned at the vertices of a regular 2B-gon. For charges Bâ¥7, rectangular or distorted rectangular arrays of 2B half lumps are preferred, as close to square as possible.\n\nMaterials, Devices and Spin Transfer Torque in Antiferromagnetic Spintronics: A Concise Review\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCoileÃ¡in, Cormac Ã.; Wu, Han Chun\n\nFrom historical obscurity, antiferromagnets are recently enjoying revived interest, as antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials may allow the continued reduction in size of spintronic devices. They have the benefit of being insensitive to parasitic external magnetic fields, while displaying high read/write speeds, and thus poised to become an integral part of the next generation of logical devices and memory. They are currently employed to preserve the magnetoresistive qualities of some ferromagnetic based giant or tunnel magnetoresistance systems. However, the question remains how the magnetic states of an antiferromagnet can be efficiently manipulated and detected. Here, we reflect on AFM materials for their use in spintronics, in particular, newly recognized antiferromagnet Mn2Au with its in-plane anisotropy and tetragonal structure and high NÃ©el temperature. These attributes make it one of the most promising candidates for AFM spintronics thus far with the possibility of architectures freed from the need for ferromagnetic (FM) elements. Here, we discuss its potential for use in ferromagnet-free spintronic devices.\n\nAntiferromagnetic spintronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaltz, V.; Manchon, A.; Tsoi, M.; Moriyama, T.; Ono, T.; Tserkovnyak, Y.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAntiferromagnetic materials could represent the future of spintronic applications thanks to the numerous interesting features they combine: they are robust against perturbation due to magnetic fields, produce no stray fields, display ultrafast dynamics, and are capable of generating large magnetotransport effects. Intense research efforts over the past decade have been invested in unraveling spin transport properties in antiferromagnetic materials. Whether spin transport can be used to drive the antiferromagnetic order and how subsequent variations can be detected are some of the thrilling challenges currently being addressed. Antiferromagnetic spintronics started out with studies on spin transfer and has undergone a definite revival in the last few years with the publication of pioneering articles on the use of spin-orbit interactions in antiferromagnets. This paradigm shift offers possibilities for radically new concepts for spin manipulation in electronics. Central to these endeavors are the need for predictive models, relevant disruptive materials, and new experimental designs. This paper reviews the most prominent spintronic effects described based on theoretical and experimental analysis of antiferromagnetic materials. It also details some of the remaining bottlenecks and suggests possible avenues for future research. This review covers both spin-transfer-related effects, such as spin-transfer torque, spin penetration length, domain-wall motion, and \"magnetization\" dynamics, and spin-orbit related phenomena, such as (tunnel) anisotropic magnetoresistance, spin Hall, and inverse spin galvanic effects. Effects related to spin caloritronics, such as the spin Seebeck effect, are linked to the transport of magnons in antiferromagnets. The propagation of spin waves and spin superfluids in antiferromagnets is also covered.\n\nPrecessional switching of antiferromagnets by electric field induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya torque\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, T. H.; GrÃ¼nberg, P.; Han, S. H.; Cho, B. K.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAntiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) have attracted much interest from many researchers as promising candidates for use in ultrafast, ultralow-dissipation spintronic devices. As a fast method of reversing magnetization, precessional switching is realized when antiferromagnetic NÃ©el orders l =(s1+s2 )/2 surmount the magnetic anisotropy or potential barrier in a given magnetic system, which is described well by the antiferromagnetic plane pendulum (APP) model. Here, we report that, as an alternative switching scenario, the direct coupling of an electric field with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, which stems from spin-orbit coupling, is exploited for optimal switching. We derive the pendulum equation of motion of antiferromagnets, where DM torque is induced by a pulsed electric field. The temporal DM interaction is found to not only be in the form of magnetic torques (e.g., spin-orbit torque or magnetic field) but also modifies the magnetic potential that limits l 's activity; as a result, appropriate controls (e.g., direction, magnitude, and pulse shape) of the induced DM vector realize deterministic reversal in APP. The results present an approach for the control of a magnetic storage device by means of an electric field.\n\nDynamical current-induced ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic resonances\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuimarÃ£es, F. S. M.; Lounis, S.; Costa, A. T.; Muniz, R. B.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe demonstrate that ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic excitations can be triggered by the dynamical spin accumulations induced by the bulk and surface contributions of the spin Hall effect. Due to the spin-orbit interaction, a time-dependent spin density is generated by an oscillatory electric field applied parallel to the atomic planes of Fe/W(110) multilayers. For symmetric trilayers of Fe/W/Fe in which the Fe layers are ferromagnetically coupled, we demonstrate that only the collective out-of-phase precession mode is excited, while the uniform (in-phase) mode remains silent. When they are antiferromagnetically coupled, the oscillatory electric field sets the Fe magnetizations into elliptical precession motions with opposite angular velocities. The manipulation of different collective spin-wave dynamical modes through the engineering of the multilayers and their thicknesses may be used to develop ultrafast spintronics devices. Our work provides a general framework that probes the realistic responses of materials in the time or frequency domain.\n\nAntiferromagnetic opto-spintronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNÄmec, P.; Fiebig, M.; Kampfrath, T.; Kimel, A. V.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nControl and detection of spin order in ferromagnetic materials is the main principle enabling magnetic information to be stored and read in current technologies. Antiferromagnetic materials, on the other hand, are far less utilized, despite having some appealing features. For instance, the absence of net magnetization and stray fields eliminates crosstalk between neighbouring devices, and the absence of a primary macroscopic magnetization makes spin manipulation in antiferromagnets inherently faster than in ferromagnets. However, control of spins in antiferromagnets requires exceedingly high magnetic fields, and antiferromagnetic order cannot be detected with conventional magnetometry. Here we provide an overview and illustrative examples of how electromagnetic radiation can be used for probing and modification of the magnetic order in antiferromagnets. We also discuss possible research directions that are anticipated to be among the main topics defining the future of this rapidly developing field.\n\nPerspectives of antiferromagnetic spintronics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJungfleisch, Matthias B.; Zhang, Wei; Hoffmann, Axel\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAntiferromagnets are promising for future spintronic applications owing to their advantageous properties: They are magnetically ordered, but neighboring magnetic moments point in opposite directions, which results in zero net magnetization. This means antiferromagnets produce no stray fields and are insensitive to external magnetic field perturbations. Furthermore, they show intrinsic high frequency dynamics, exhibit considerable spin-orbit and magneto-transport effects.

We report studies on films with the structure glass /150 Ã Re/[13 Ã Co/tRe]16/50 Ã Re, with tRe ranging from 3 to 40 Ã . These structures were grown by magnetron sputtering in a system with a base pressure of 1Ã10-7 Torr with deposition rates of 0.3 and 0.4 Ã /s for Co and Re, respectively. x-ray diffractograms indicate the structure to be highly textured with the c axis perpendicular to the sample plane. The superlattice structure was obtained from high-angle Î¸-2Î¸ scans. First-, second-, and third-order satellites are observed on both sides of the central [002] peak. Periodicity and bilayer composition are obtained from comparison of the data with a theoretical calculation of the x-ray diffractogram. Thickness calibration was confirmed by Rutherford backscattering and profilometer data. In-plane magnetization and magnetoresistance data (ÎÏ/Ï) indicate that stronger antiferromagnetic coupling and highest ÎÏ/Ï occur for tReâ6 Ã . The saturation field (Hs) needed to align contiguous antiferromagnetically coupled Co layers is about 1 T. This corresponds to an exchange coupling between the Co layer Jâ-1 erg/cm2. (ÎÏ/Ï) reaches 2% in samples deposited at 170 Â°C. This data confirms results obtained by Parkin et al.1 in Co-Ru and Co-Cr superlattices.\n\nMagnetoelectric control of spin-chiral ferroelectric domains in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKimura, Kenta; Nakamura, Hiroyuki; Ohgushi, Kenya; Kimura, Tsuyoshi\n\n2008-10-01\n\nWe have grown single crystals of a triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLA), CuCrO2 , and investigated the correlation between magnetic and dielectric properties.

Polycrystalline, highly textured film stacks of Ta/MnN/CoFeB/MgO/Ta were grown on SiOx by (reactive) magnetron sputtering and studied by x-ray diffraction and Kerr magnetometry. Nontrivial modifications of the exchange bias and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy were observed as functions of both film thicknesses and field cooling temperatures. In optimized film stacks, a giant perpendicular exchange bias of 3600 Oe and a coercive field of 350 Oe were observed at room temperature. The effective interfacial exchange energy is estimated to be Jeff = 0.24 mJ/m2 and the effective uniaxial anisotropy constant of the antiferromagnet is Keff = 24 kJ/m3. The maximum effective perpendicular anisotropy field of the CoFeB layer is Hani = 3400 Oe. These values are larger than any previously reported values. These results possibly open a route to magnetically stable, exchange biased perpendicularly magnetized spin valves.\n\nSpin-Chirality-Driven Ferroelectricity on a Perfect Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMitamura, H.; Watanuki, R.; Kaneko, Koji\n\nMagnetic field (B) variation of the electrical polarization P c ( â¥c) of the perfect triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO 4) 2 is examined up to the saturation point of the magnetization for Bâ¥c.

This means antiferromagnets produce no stray fields and are insensitive to external magnetic field perturbations. Furthermore, they show intrinsic high frequency dynamics, exhibit considerable spin-orbit and magneto-transport effects.

Here we use polarized neutron scattering to study the spin space anisotropy of spin excitations in Fe1.07Te exhibiting bicollinear antiferromagnetic (AF) order, the parent compound of FeTe1 -xSex superconductors. We confirm that the low-energy spin excitations are transverse spin waves, consistent with a local-moment origin of the bicollinear AF order. While the ordered moments lie in the a b plane in Fe1.07Te , it takes less energy for them to fluctuate out of plane, similar to BaFe2As2 and NaFeAs. At energies above E â³20 meV, we find magnetic scattering to be dominated by an isotropic continuum that persists up to at least 50 meV. Although the isotropic spin excitations cannot be ascribed to spin waves from a long-range-ordered local-moment antiferromagnet, the continuum can result from the bicollinear magnetic order ground state of Fe1.07Te being quasidegenerate with plaquette magnetic order.\n\nAntiferromagnetic Resonance and Terahertz Continuum in Î±-RuCl_{3}.\n\nPubMed\n\nLittle, A; Wu, Liang; Lampen-Kelley, P; Banerjee, A; Patankar, S; Rees, D; Bridges, C A; Yan, J-Q; Mandrus, D; Nagler, S E; Orenstein, J\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe report measurements of optical absorption in the zigzag antiferromagnet Î±-RuCl_{3} as a function of temperature T, magnetic field B, and photon energy âÏ in the range â¼0.3-8.3Â meV, using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy. Polarized measurements show that threefold rotational symmetry is broken in the honeycomb plane from 2 to 300Â K. We find a sharp absorption peak at 2.56Â meV upon cooling below the NÃ©el temperature of 7Â K at B=0 that we identify as the magnetic-dipole excitation of a zero-wave-vector magnon, or antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR). With the application of B, the AFMR broadens and shifts to a lower frequency as long-range magnetic order is lost in a manner consistent with transitioning to a spin-disordered phase. From a direct, internally calibrated measurement of the AFMR spectral weight, we place an upper bound on the contribution to the dc susceptibility from a magnetic excitation continuum.\n\nDisappearance of Ising nature in Ca3ZnMnO6 studied by high-field ESR.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuan, M Y; Ouyang, Z W; Guo, Y M; Cheng, J J; Sun, Y C; Xia, Z C; Rao, G H; Okubo, S; Ohta, H\n\n2014-06-11\n\nHigh-field electron spin resonance measurements of an antiferromagnet Ca3ZnMnO6 isostructure, with the Ising-chain multiferroic Ca3CoMnO6, have been carried out. Two distinct resonance modes were observed below TN = 25âK, which is well explained by conventional antiferromagnetic resonance theory with easy-plane anisotropy. The zero-field spin gap is derived to be about 166âGHz, originating from the easy-plane anisotropy and exchange interaction. OurÂ result suggests that the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, which may induce spin canting, is absent. Disappearance of Ising anisotropy in Ca3ZnMnO6 suggests that the Co(4+) ion, as well as the Co-Mn superexchange, plays an important role for the Ising nature in Ca3CoMnO6.\n\nElectron gas at the interface between two antiferromagnetic insulating manganites\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCalderÃ³n, M.

We find that a ferromagnetic and metallic electron gas is formed at the interface between the two layers. We confirm the metallic character of the interface by calculating the in-plane conductance. The possibility of increasing the electron-gas density by selective doping is also discussed.\n\nAntiferromagnetic skyrmions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTretiakov, Oleg; Barker, Joseph\n\nSkyrmions are topologically protected entities in magnetic materials which have the potential to be used in spintronics for information storage and processing. However, skyrmions in ferromagnets have some intrinsic difficulties which must be overcome to use them for spintronic applications, such as the inability to move straight along current. We show that skyrmions can also be stabilized and manipulated in antiferromagnetic materials. An antiferromagnetic skyrmion is a compound topological object with a similar but of opposite sign spin texture on each sublattice, which e.g. results in a complete cancelation of the Magnus force. We find that the composite nature of antiferromagnetic skyrmions gives rise to different dynamical behavior, both due to an applied current and temperature effects.

Temperature-dependent THz spectroscopy reveals a strong absorption mode centered near 1 THz, which upon heating from 4 to 450 K softens and loses intensity. A comparison with the estimated eigenmode frequencies implies that the observed mode is an in-plane antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR). The AFMR absorption strength exceeds those found in antiferromagnetic insulators, driven by the magnetic field of the THz radiation, by 3 orders of magnitude. Based on this and the agreement with our theory modeling, we infer that the driving mechanism for the observed mode is the current-induced NSOT. Here the electric field component of the THz pulse drives an ac current in the metal, which subsequently drives the AFMR. This electric manipulation of the NÃ©el order parameter at high frequencies makes Mn2Au a prime candidate for antiferromagnetic ultrafast memory applications.\n\nLarge valley splitting in monolayer WS2 by proximity coupling to an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Lei; Yang, Ming; Shen, Lei; Zhou, Jun; Zhu, Tao; Feng, Yuan Ping\n\n2018-01-01\n\nLifting the valley degeneracy is an efficient way to achieve valley polarization for further valleytronics operations. In this Rapid Communication, we demonstrate that a large valley splitting can be obtained in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides by magnetic proximity coupling to an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate. As an example, we perform first-principles calculations to investigate the electronic structures of monolayer WS2 on the MnO(111) surface. Our calculation results suggest that a large valley splitting of 214 meV, which corresponds to a Zeeman magnetic field of 1516 T, is induced in the valence band of monolayer WS2. The magnitude of valley splitting relies on the strength of interfacial orbital hybridization and can be tuned continually by applying an external out-of-plane pressure and in-plane strain. More interestingly, we find that both spin and valley index will flip when the magnetic ordering of MnO is reversed. Besides, owing to the sizable Berry curvature and time-reversal symmetry breaking in the WS2/MnO heterostructure, a spin- and valley-polarized anomalous Hall current can be generated in the presence of an in-plane electric field, which allows one to detect valleys by the electrical approach. Our results shed light on the realization of valleytronic devices using the antiferromagnetic insulator as the substrate.\n\nAntiferromagnetic Resonance and Terahertz Continuum in Î± - RuCl 3\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nLittle, A.; Wu, Liang; Lampen-Kelley, P.; ...\n\n2017-11-28\n\nWe report measurements of optical absorption in the zigzag antiferromagnet Î±-RuCl 3 as a function of temperature T , magnetic field B , and photon energy â Ï in the range ~ 0.3 â8.3 meV, using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy.

The AC spin current excites two evanescent modes in the antiferromagnet, which, in turn, create DC spin current flowing back through the antiferromagnetic surface. Spin diode based on this effect can be used in future spintronic devices as direct detector of spin current in the millimeter- and submillimeter-wave bands. The sensitivity of such a spin diode is comparable to the sensitivity of modern electric Schottky diodes and lies in the range 102-103 V/W for 30 Ã30 nm2 structure.\n\nHow to manipulate magnetic states of antiferromagnets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSong, Cheng; You, Yunfeng; Chen, Xianzhe; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Wang, Yuyan; Pan, Feng\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAntiferromagnetic materials, which have drawn considerable attention recently, have fascinating features: they are robust against perturbation, produce no stray fields, and exhibit ultrafast dynamics. Discerning how to efficiently manipulate the magnetic state of an antiferromagnet is key to the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this review, we introduce four main methods (magnetic, strain, electrical, and optical) to mediate the magnetic states and elaborate on intrinsic origins of different antiferromagnetic materials. Magnetic control includes a strong magnetic field, exchange bias, and field cooling, which are traditional and basic. Strain control involves the magnetic anisotropy effect or metamagnetic transition. Electrical control can be divided into two parts, electric field and electric current, both of which are convenient for practical applications. Optical control includes thermal and electronic excitation, an inertia-driven mechanism, and terahertz laser control, with the potential for ultrafast antiferromagnetic manipulation.

Starting from a model tight-binding Hamiltonian, we obtain the quantum kinetic equation within Keldysh formalism and expand it to the lowest order in spatial gradient using Wigner expansion method. In the diffusive limit, these equations track the spatio-temporal evolution of the spin accumulations and spin currents on each sublattice of the antiferromagnet. We use these equations to address the nature of the spin transfer torque in (i) a spin-valve composed of a ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet, (ii) a metallic bilayer consisting of an antiferromagnet adjacent to a heavy metal possessing spin Hall effect, and in (iii) a single antiferromagnet possessing spin Hall effect. We show that the latter can experience a self-torque thanks to the non-vanishing spin Hall effect in the antiferromagnet.\n\nSpin transport and spin torque in antiferromagnetic devices\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nZelezny, J.; Wadley, P.; Olejnik, K.; ...\n\n2018-03-02\n\nFerromagnets are key materials for sensing and memory applications.

Strong coupling would be achieved if the externally generated field had a sign alternating on the scale of a lattice constant at which moments alternate in AFMs. However, generating such a field has been regarded unfeasible, hindering the research and applications of these abundant magnetic materials. We have recently predicted that relativistic quantum mechanics may offer staggered current induced fields with the sign alternating within the magnetic unit cell which can facilitate a reversible switching of an antiferromagnet by applying electrical currents with comparable efficiency to ferromagnets. Among suitable materials is a high NÃ©el temperature antiferromagnet, tetragonal-phase CuMnAs, which we have recently synthesized in the form of single-crystal epilayers structurally compatible with common semiconductors. We demonstrate electrical writing and read-out, combined with the insensitivity to magnetic field perturbations, in a proof-of-concept antiferromagnetic memory device.

S.; Singh, Sanjay; Caron, L.; Hansen, Th.; Hoser, A.; Kumar, V.; Borrmann, H.; Fitch, A.; Devi, P.; Manna, K.; Felser, C.; Inosov, D. S.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nBy means of powder neutron diffraction we investigate changes in the magnetic structure of the coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Ge caused by an application of hydrostatic pressure up to 5 GPa. At ambient conditions the kagomÃ© layers of Mn atoms in Mn3Ge order in a triangular 120â spin structure. Under high pressure the spins acquire a uniform out-of-plane canting, gradually transforming the magnetic texture to a noncoplanar configuration. With increasing pressure the canted structure fully transforms into the collinear ferromagnetic one. We observed that magnetic order is accompanied by a noticeable magnetoelastic effect, namely, spontaneous magnetostriction. The latter induces an in-plane magnetostrain of the hexagonal unit cell at ambient pressure and flips to an out-of-plane strain at high pressures in accordance with the change of the magnetic structur"
