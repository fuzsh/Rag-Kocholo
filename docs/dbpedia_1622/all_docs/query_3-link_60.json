        "text": "A new concept of endometriosis and adenomyosis: tissue injury and repair (TIAR).\n\nPubMed\n\nLeyendecker, Gerhard; Wildt, Ludwig\n\n2011-03-01\n\nPelvic endometriosis, deeply infiltrating endometriosis and uterine adenomyosis share a common pathophysiology and may be integrated into the physiological mechanism and new nosological concept of 'tissue injury and repair' (TIAR) and may, in this context, just represent the extreme of a basically physiological, estrogen-related mechanism that is pathologically exaggerated in an extremely estrogen-sensitive reproductive organ. The acronym TIAR describes a fundamental and apparently ubiquitous biological system that becomes operative in mesenchymal tissues following tissue injury and, upon activation, results in the local production of estradiol. Endometriosis and adenomyosis are caused by trauma. In the spontaneously developing disease, chronic uterine peristaltic activity or phases of hyperperistalsis induce, at the endometrial-myometrial interface near the fundo-cornual raphe, microtraumatisations, with activation of the TIAR mechanism. With ongoing traumatisations, such sites of inflammation might accumulate and the increasingly produced estrogens interfere in a paracrine fashion with ovarian control over uterine peristaltic activity, resulting in permanent hyperperistalsis and a self-perpetuation of the disease process. Overt autotraumatisation of the uterus with dislocation of fragments of basal endometrium into the peritoneal cavity and infiltration of basal endometrium into the depth of the myometrial wall ensues. In most cases of endometriosis/adenomyosis a causal event early in the reproductive period of life must be postulated, rapidly leading to archimetral hyperestrogenism and uterine hyperperistalsis. In late premenopausal adenomyosis such an event might not have occurred. However, as indicated by the high prevalence of the disease, it appears to be unavoidable that, with time, chronic normoperistalsis throughout the reproductive period of life accumulates to the same extent of microtraumatisation. With activation of the TIAR mechanism followed by\n\nAcute Kidney Injury due to Menstruation-related Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation in an Adenomyosis Patient: A Case Report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSon, Jungmin; Seong, Eun Young; Song, Sang Heon; Lee, Soo Bong; Kang, Jin; Yang, Byeong Yun; Lee, Su Jin; Choi, Jong-Ryeol; Lee, Kyu-Sup; Kwak, Ihm Soo\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe authors report a case of acute kidney injury (AKI) resulting from menstruation-related disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in an adenomyosis patient. A 40-yr-old woman who had received gonadotropin for ovulation induction therapy presented with anuria and an elevated serum creatinine level. Her medical history showed primary infertility with diffuse adenomyosis. On admission, her pregnancy test was negative and her menstrual cycle had started 1 day previously. Laboratory data were consistent with DIC, and it was believed to be related to myometrial injury resulting from heavy intramyometrial menstrual flow. Gonadotropin is considered to play an important role in the development of fulminant DIC. This rare case suggests that physicians should be aware that gonadotropin may provoke fulminant DIC in women with adenomyosis.

Experimental retrospective study. University hospital. Twenty-four patients with adenomyosis, 19 with ovarian endometriomata, and 9 with fibroids or benign ovarian cysts. Hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. Immunostaining for Cdc42 of eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues. In eutopic endometrium of patients with adenomyosis and with fibroids or benign ovarian cysts, the intensity of Cdc42 immunostaining was weaker, especially in the specialized stromal cells, compared with cases with ovarian endometriosis (chi(2) test, P=.003). Expression of Cdc42 in eutopic endometrium showed a trend to be higher in the secretory than in the proliferative phase and in patients with ovarian endometriotic cysts compared with patients with adenomyosis (unpaired t test, P=.005), especially in the proliferative phase. An abnormally high expression of Cdc42 in eutopic endometrium in the secretory phase may contribute to the development of ovarian endometriosis, but it does not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis.\n\nHistory of adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenagiano, Giuseppe; Brosens, Ivo\n\n2006-08-01\n\nAlthough the claim has been made that there are early descriptions of what today we call endometriosis and adenomyosis in theses presented in Europe in the late 17(th) and during the 18(th) centuries, the first description of the condition initially named 'adenomyoma' is that provided in 1860 by the German pathologist Carl von Rokitansky, who found endometrial glands in the myometrium and designated this finding as 'cystosarcoma adenoids uterinum'. Over the following 50 years 'adenomyoma' (and endometriosis) were considered pathologies separate from the so-called 'haemorrhagic ovarian cysts', and it was not until 1921 that this condition was recognized to be of endometriotic origin. The first systematic description of what is today known as adenomyosis was the work of Thomas Stephen Cullen who, at the turn of the 19(th) century, fully researched the 'mucosal invasion' already observed by a number of investigators in several parts of the lower abdominal cavity. Cullen clearly identified the epithelial tissue invasion as being made of 'uterine mucosa' and defined the mechanism through which the mucosa invades the underlying tissue. In 1925, 2 years before Sampson created the term 'endometriosis', Frankl created a name for the mucosal invasion of the myometrium and clearly described its anatomical picture; he called it 'adenomyosis uteri' and explained that 'I have chosen the name of adenomyosis, which does not suggest any inflammatory genesis as do terms like adenometritis, adenomyositis, adenomyometritis, still employed'. The current definition of adenomyosis was finally provided in 1972 by Bird who stated: 'Adenomyosis may be defined as the benign invasion of endometrium into the myometrium, producing a diffusely enlarged uterus which microscopically exhibits ectopic non-neoplastic, endometrial glands and stroma surrounded by the hypertrophic and hyperplastic myometrium'.\n\nValue of in vitro acoustic radiation force impulse application on uterine adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBildaci, Tevfik Berk; Cevik, Halime; Yilmaz, Birnur; Desteli, Guldeniz Aksan\n\n2017-11-24\n\nAdenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glandular and stromal tissue in the myometrium. This phenomenon can be the cause of excessive bleeding and menstrual pain in premenopausal women. Diagnosis of adenomyosis may present difficulty with conventional methods such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Frequently, diagnosis is accomplished retrospectively based on the hysterectomy specimen. This is a prospective case control study done in vitro on 90 patients' hysterectomy specimens. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and color elastography were used to determine the elasticity of hysterectomy specimens of patients undergoing indicated surgeries. Based on histopathological examinations, two groups were formed: a study group (nÂ =Â 28-with adenomyosis) and a control group (nÂ =Â 62-without adenomyosis). Elasticity measurements of tissue with adenomyosis were observed to be significantly higher than measurements of normal myometrial tissue (pÂ <Â 0.01). Uterine fibroids were found to have higher values on ARFI study compared to normal myometrial tissues (pÂ <Â 0.01). The findings lead to the conclusion that adenomyosis tissue is significantly softer than the normal myometrium. ARFI was found to be beneficial in differentiating myometrial tissue with adenomyosis from normal myometrial tissue. It was found to be feasible and beneficial to implement ARFI in daily gynecology practice for diagnosis of adenomyosis.\n\nAdenomyosis and Endometrial Cancer: Literature Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nHabiba, Marwan; Pluchino, Nicola; Petignat, Patrick; Bianchi, Paola; Brosens, Ivo A; Benagiano, Giuseppe\n\n2018-06-06\n\nTo confirm the origin of cancer found in both the endometrium and the myometrium is difficult. Cancer may spread from the endometrium into adenomyotic foci or vice versa. Also, premalignant changes may arise at either or both sites. Investigating disease origin enhances our understanding of pathophysiology and prognosis. Additional critical questions are whether women with adenomyosis have a higher risk of endometrial cancer; whether the invasive properties and prognosis of cancer in adenomyosis differ from those arising in the eutopic endometrium and whether the ectopic glandular tissue in adenomyosis becomes altered in the presence of eutopic endometrial cancer. A final question is whether cancer arising within adenomyosis carries a worse prognosis because of its location within the myometrium and the possibility that the presence of adenomyosis facilitates invasion of cancer arising in the eutopic endometrium. The present review explores currently available literature in an attempt to answer these questions and to examine clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis and prognosis. Â© 2018 S.

A retrospective study was conducted on 129 women who underwent abdominal hysterectomy for treatment-resistant menometrorrhagia. The patients were divided into four groups according to the postoperative histopathology: concomitant adenomyosis and leiomyoma (nâ=â33), adenomyosis only (nâ=â26), leiomyoma only (nâ=â48) and controls (nâ=â22). Patients without any organic uterine pathology constituted the control group. Age at menarche was higher in the concomitant adenomyosis and leiomyoma group compared to the adenomyosis only group (Pâ=â0.006). The mean age (Pâ=â0.007), age at menarche (Pâ=â0.001) and gravidity (Pâ=â0.001) were higher in the concomitant adenomyosis and leiomyoma group compared to the leiomyoma only group. Preoperative hemoglobin was lower in the concomitant adenomyosis and leiomyoma, adenomyosis only, and leiomyoma only groups than the control group (Pâ<â0.008). On receiver operating characteristic analysis, hemoglobin <10.9âmg/dL had a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 70%, respectively, in discrimination of any uterine organic pathology, including adenomyosis only, leiomyoma only, and concomitant adenomyosis and leiomyoma, from the control group. Patients in the adenomyosis group were older (OR, 1.20; 95%CI: 1.05-1.50) and had a lower age at menarche (OR, 0.42; 95%CI: 0.19-0.89) than the other groups. Preoperative anemia may be a useful predictor of adenomyosis. Older patients, and patients who had a lower age at menarche, were also more likely to have adenomyosis. Â© 2015 The Authors.

Endocannabinoid mediated apoptotic mechanisms of endometriosis and adenomyosis are not known. We hypothesized that the down regulation of endocannabinoid receptors and/or alteration in their regulatory enzymes may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and adenomyosis through apoptosis. Endocannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, their synthesizing and catabolizing enzymes (FAAH, NAPE-PLD, DAGL, MAGL) and the apoptotic indexes were immunohistochemically assessed in endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues. Findings were compared to normal endometrium and myometrium. Endometrial adenocarcinoma (Ishikawa) and ovarian endometriosis cyst wall stromal (CRL-7566) cell lines were furthermore cultured with or without cannabinoid receptor agonists. The IC50 value for CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists was quantified. Cannabinoid agonists on cell death were investigated by Annexin-V/Propidium iodide labeling with flow cytometry. CB1 and CB2 receptor levels decreased in endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues compared to the control group (p=0,001 and p=0,001). FAAH, NAPE-PLD, MAGL and DAGL enzyme levels decreased in endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues compared to control (p=0,001, p=0,001, p=0,001 and p=0,002 respectively). Apoptotic cell indexes both in endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues also decreased significantly, compared to the control group (p=0,001 and p=0,001). CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist mediated dose dependent fast anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were detected in Ishikawa and ovarian endometriosis cyst wall stromal cell lines (CRL-7566). Endocannabinoids are suggested to increase apoptosis mechanisms in endometriosis and adenomyosis. CB1 and CB2 antagonists can be considered as potential medical therapeutic agents for endometriosis and adenomyosis. Copyright Â\n\nAdenomyosis\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... relieves symptoms.

Uterus macro-preparations obtained after hysterectomy in 60 patients with pelvic pain on a background of diffuse adenomyosis II-III degree were used for morphological examination, and macro-preparations received from 30 women with adenomyosis without pain syndrome. The diagnosis of adenomyosis was confirmed by sonography and magnetic resonance imaging. The expression of VEGF in tissues of the endometrium and myometrium was determined using the immune-histochemical method. The significance of differences of the compared parameters was determined using the criterion of Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney. The differences were considered statistically significant when pâ<â0.05. It was found that a higher expression of VEGF is characteristic for patients with pelvic pain associated with adenomyosis, compared to women with adenomyosis and abnormal uterine bleeding, both in epithelial cells of ectopic endometrium (14.7âÂ±â1.6% against 10.7âÂ±â1.6%, pâ<â0.01), and in smooth myocytes of the myometrium (12.6âÂ±â1.4% against 9.6âÂ±â1.2%, pâ<â0.01) and in the stromal cells of the myometrium (10.1âÂ±â1.9% versus 7.4âÂ±â1.8%, pâ<â0.01). An increased expression of VEGF in the tissues of the uterus is one of the most important pathogenetic mechanisms of algogenesis with adenomyosis, associated syndrome of chronic pelvic pain, compared to the silent form of the disease.\n\nExpression of GRIM-19 in adenomyosis and its possible role in pathogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Jing; Deng, Xiaohui; Yang, Yang; Yang, Xingsheng; Kong, Beihua; Chao, Lan\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo study the expression of the gene associated with retinoid-interferon (IFN)-induced mortality 19 (GRIM-19) in the endometrial tissue of patients with adenomyosis and to describe the possible pathogenic mechanisms of this phenomenon. Experimental study using human samples and cell lines. University-affiliated hospital. Ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissues were obtained from 30 patients with adenomyosis, whereas normal endometrial specimens were obtained from 10 control patients without adenomyosis. Patients with rapid pathology report-confirmed adenomyosis were recruited, and eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue samples were collected from patients who had undergone hysterectomies by either the transabdominal or laparoscopic method at Qilu Hospital. Normal endometrial tissue was collected from a group of control patients without adenomyosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to evaluate the expression of GRIM-19, phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Y705) (Y705) (pSTAT3(Y705)), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in endometrial tissue samples. The protein levels of GRIM-19, pSTAT3(Y705), STAT3, and VEGF were detected by Western blot. Apoptosis in endometrial specimens was assayed by TUNEL. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody directed against CD34 was performed to detect new blood vessels in the endometrial tissue. GRIM-19 small interfering RNA and a recombinant plasmid carrying GRIM-19 were constructed to evaluate the effects of GRIM-19 on the downstream factors pSTAT3(Y705), STAT3, and VEGF in Ishikawa cells. The expression of GRIM-19 was down-regulated in the eutopic endometria of patients with adenomyosis compared with the endometria of patients in the control group, and it was further reduced in the endometrial glandular epithelial cells of adenomyotic lesions. Apoptosis was reduced in the eutopic endometrium compared with the control group, and it was significantly reduced in ectopic endometrial tissues.

Twenty-four hours after photodynamic therapy, we evaluated tissue morphologic features. Department of obstetrics and gynecology at a university hospital in Japan. Immunodeficient mice. Tissue grafts were taken from women with adenomyosis attending a university hospital. Photodynamic treatment. Peak fluorescence after intraperitoneal ALA administration and tissue histological changes 24 hours after photodynamic therapy. Peak fluorescence was observed 3 hours after intraperitoneal administration. Histological studies revealed decreased numbers of epithelial and stromal cells in adenomyosis models after therapy. Photodynamic therapy with ALA caused extensive cell death in human adenomyosis tissues implanted into nude mice. Photodynamic treatment using ALA is a potential treatment for patients with adenomyosis uteri.\n\nSurgery in adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nOliveira, Marco Aurelio Pinho; Crispi, Claudio Peixoto; Brollo, Leila Cristina; Crispi, Claudio Peixoto; De Wilde, Rudy Leon\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAdenomyosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium. The true prevalence is unknown and has been reported to range from 1 to 70%. It has a significantly negative impact on women's quality of life, causing abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and chronic pelvic pain. The definitive treatment for adenomyosis is hysterectomy, although it does not contemplate patients who wish to preserve their fertility. The aim of this paper is to discuss the latest evidence on the surgical techniques for the treatment of adenomyosis published in medical-scientific databases. A comprehensive literature search for articles published from 1996 to 2017 related to surgery for adenomyosis was made in Pubmed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, in English, by the following MeSH terms: adenomyosis, surgery, pathogenesis, dysmenorrhea and infertility. There is extensive evidence on several surgical approaches for the improvement of adenomyosis-related symptoms; however, there is no robust evidence that they are effective for infertility. The management of adenomyosis is quite complex and controversial. Complications after extensive uterine reconstruction, such as uterine rupture, should be considered and discussed with the patient. There are still limited data to support surgery effectiveness, especially for infertility, and further well-designed studies are required.\n\nPositive associations between upregulated levels of stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in endometriosis/adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Hsin-Shih; Tsai, Chia-Lung; Chang, Pi-Yueh; Chao, Angel; Wu, Ren-Chin; Chen, Shun-Hua; Wang, Chin-Jung; Yen, Chih-Feng; Lee, Yun-Shien; Wang, Tzu-Hao\n\n2018-01-01\n\nStress-induced phosphoprotein-1 (STIP1), an adaptor protein that coordinates the functions of HSP70 and HSP90 in protein folding, has been implicated in the development of human gynecologic malignancies. This case-control study investigates STIP1 serum levels and tissue expression in relation to endometriosis/adenomyosis in Taiwanese population. Female patients with surgically confirmed endometriosis/adenomyosis were compared with women free of endometriosis/adenomyosis. Serum STIP1 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surgical tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Both epithelial and stromal cells in surgical tissues of endometriosis and adenomyosis expressed STIP1 and MMP-9. Notably, MMP-9 expression was significantly decreased when STIP1 expression was knocked-down. In vitro experiments revealed that STIP1 was capable of binding to the MMP-9 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional expression. The preoperative serum STIP1 levels of patients with endometriosis/adenomyosis were significantly higher than those of the controls. In brief, our data suggest an association between STIP1 levels and endometriosis/adenomyosis.\n\nTransforming growth factor Î²1 signaling coincides with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation in the development of adenomyosis in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, Minhong; Liu, Xishi; Zhang, Hongqi; Guo, Sun-Wei\n\n2016-02-01\n\nDo platelets have any role in the development of adenomyosis? Activated platelets coincide with the release of transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1 and induction of the TGF-Î²/Smad signaling pathway as well as evidence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (FMT) in a mouse model of adenomyosis, resulting ultimately in fibrosis, as in adenomyosis. Both EMT and FMT are known to play vital roles in fibrogenesis in general and in endometriosis in particular. EMT has been implicated in the development of adenomyosis, but this was based primarily on cross-sectional observation. It is unclear as to whether adenomyotic lesions and their microenvironment have the machinery to promote EMT and FMT, resulting ultimately in fibrosis. There has not been any published study on the role of platelets in the development of adenomyosis, even though adenomyotic lesions undergo repeated cycles of tissue injury and repair, which implicates the involvement of platelets and constitutes an environment conducive for fibrogenesis. Adenomyosis was induced in 28 female ICR mice by neonatal dosing of tamoxifen. Another 32 were neonatally dosed without tamoxifen. These mice were sacrificed serially and their tissue samples were subsequently evaluated. Female ICR mice with and without induced adenomyosis were sacrificed in batch at 5, 10, 15, 42 and 60 days of age. The depth of myometrial infiltration of endometrial tissues was assessed and immunohistochemistry analysis of biomarkers of EMT and FMT, as well as TGF-Î²1, phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) and markers of proliferation, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposits was performed in ectopic (for adenomyotic mice) and eutopic (controls) endometrial tissue samples. Masson trichrome and Van Gieson stainings were performed to quantify the extent of fibrosis in lesions. Progesterone receptor isoform B (PR-B) staining also was performed. While TGF-Î²1 immunoreactivity was\n\nDienogest reduces proliferation, NGF expression and nerve fiber density in human adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakeuchi, Arisa; Koga, Kaori; Miyashita, Mariko; Makabe, Tomoko; Sue, Fusako; Harada, Miyuki; Hirata, Tetsuya; Hirota, Yasushi; Fujii, Tomoyuki; Osuga, Yutaka\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTo evaluate the in vivo effect of dienogest on proliferation, apoptosis, aromatase expression, vascular density, nerve growth factor (NGF) expression and nerve fiber density in human adenomyosis tissue. Twelve women who underwent hysterectomy for adenomyosis were enrolled. Six patients received dienogest treatment prior to hysterectomy (dienogest group), and age-matched six patients who had not received any hormonal treatment for â¥3 months before surgery (control group). Cell proliferation, vascular and nerve fiber density in adenomyosis tissue were evaluated by staining for Ki67, von Willebrand factor and PGP9.5, respectively. Apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL assay. The expression aromatase and NGF were evaluated by staining for corresponding antibodies. The proportion of Ki67 positive epithelial cells was significantly lower in samples from dienogest-treated patients in comparison with controls (p<0.05). The density of blood vessels in adenomyosis was marginally lower in the dienogest group in comparison with controls but statistical significance was not reached (p=0.07). The intensity of NGF expression and the density of nerve fibers were significantly lower in the dienogest group compared with controls (p<0.05 for both). This study demonstrates that adenomyosis, taken from patients treated with dienogest, shows remarkable histological features, such as reductions in proliferation, NGF expression and nerve fiber density. These findings indicate the impact of dienogest on local histological events, and explains its therapeutic effect on adenomyosis. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Smooth muscle cells of the uterus surrounding the adenomyosis colonies become hypertrophic, which may lead to abnormal contractions of the uterine wall. Adenomyosis is an estrogen-dependent disease with abnormal uterine bleeding and dysmenorrhea as typical symptoms. The disease may even be asymptomate. The diagnosis is made by histologically or ultrasonic or MRI imaging. Adenomyosis can be treated with hormonal medications. Fertility-sparing radiologic and surgical techniques are also available.\n\nAdenomyosis: a life-cycle approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenagiano, Giuseppe; Brosens, Ivo; Habiba, Marwan\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe life-cycle approach to endometriosis highlighted unexpected features of the condition; the same approach was therefore applied to gain insight into the clinical features of adenomyosis and to draw a comparison with endometriosis. This is possible today thanks to new imaging techniques enabling non-invasive diagnosis of adenomyosis. The specificity and sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasound remain uncertain. Unlike endometriosis, little information is available on the presence of classic adenomyosis in adolescents, except for rare cystic forms that may not represent the true disease. Adenomyosis is most likely to affect adult women, although most reported incidences are still based on post-hysterectomy studies, and are affected by diligence in histopathologic diagnosis and the adopted cut-off point. The traditionally accepted associations of adult adenomyosis, such as multiparity, a link to infertility and its effect on pregnancy are uncertain. Active adenomyosis has been found in pre- and peri-menopausal women and in postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen. In conclusion, major diagnostic limitations and the systematic bias of hysterectomy make it difficult to draw firm conclusions from existing evidence. In addition, no information is available on the natural history of adenomyosis and no study has systematically evaluated its existence in adolescents. Copyright Â© 2014 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

A total of 108 individuals including 50 patients with adenomyosis and 58 controls who were admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Bursa, Cekirge State Hospital and Derince Training and Research Hospital between April 2015 and December 2015 were included. The Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) were used to evaluate symptoms. Irritative urinary symptoms such as nocturia and frequency were seen more frequently in the adenomyosis group (pâ¯=â¯0.001 and pâ¯=â¯0.035). Overactive bladder symptoms were more common in the adenomyosis group (pâ¯=â¯0.0001).

This results in myometrial hyperplasia, uterine enlargement and causes menorrhagia, dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia for which there is no known cure other than hysterectomy. The success of LITT in the treatment of uterine leiomyomata suggested that this might also be effective for the treatment of adenomyosis. Initially LITT was carried out on patients with adenomyosis prior to hysterectomy, then on patients who had completed child-bearing and finally on those who desired a family. Not only were symptoms relieved but pregnancies occurred spontaneously. The KTP 532 nm component of the KTP/YAG laser, which is absorbed by red pigment, was used with a 600 micrometer fiber with a bare tip via a needle microstat at laparoscopy. Holes were drilled in the abnormal tissue 3 cm apart and the laser fiber then slowly withdrawn, the object being to coagulate the surrounding blood vessels and adenomyotic tissue. The number of joules required depended on the volume of tissue treated.\n\nMyostatin, follistatin and activin type II receptors are highly expressed in adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarrarelli, Patrizia; Yen, Chih-Fen; Arcuri, Felice; Funghi, Lucia; Tosti, Claudia; Wang, Tzu-Hao; Huang, Joseph S; Petraglia, Felice\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo evaluate the expression pattern of activins and related growth factor messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in adenomyotic nodules and in their endometrium. Prospective study. University hospital. Symptomatic premenopausal women scheduled to undergo hysterectomy for adenomyosis. Samples from adenomyotic nodules and homologous endometria were collected. Endometrial tissue was also obtained from a control group. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and immunohistochemical localization of activin-related growth factors (activin A, activin B, and myostatin), binding protein (follistatin), antagonists (inhibin-Î±, cripto), and receptors (ActRIIa, ActRIIb) were performed. Myostatin mRNA levels in adenomyotic nodule were higher than in eutopic endometrium and myostatin, activin A, and follistatin concentrations were higher than in control endometrium. No difference was observed for inhibin-Î±, activin B, and criptoÂ mRNA levels. Increased mRNA levels of ActRIIa and ActRIIb were observed in adenomyotic nodules compared with eutopic endometrium and control endometrium. Immunofluorescent staining for myostatin and follistatin confirmed higher protein expression in both glands and stroma of patients with adenomyosis than in controls. The present study showed for the first time that adenomyotic tissues express high levels of myostatin, follistatin, and activin A (growth factors involved in proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis). Increased expression of their receptors supports the hypothesis of a possible local effect of these growth factors in adenomyosis. The augmented expression of ActRIIa, ActRIIb, and follistatin in the endometrium of these patients may play a role in adenomyosis-related infertility.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the impact of each of them on reproductive outcome. In respect to myomas, current evidence implies that submucosal ones have an adverse effect on conception and early pregnancy. A similar effect yet is not quite clear and has been suggested for intramural myomas. Still, it seems reasonable that intramural myomas greater than 4âcm in diameter may negatively impair reproductive outcome. On the contrary, subserosal myomas do not seem to have a significant impact, if any, on reproduction. The presence of submucosal and/or large intramural myomas has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In particular increased risk for miscarriage, fetal malpresentation, placenta previa, preterm birth, placenta abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, and cesarean section has been reported. With regard to adenomyosis, besides the tentative coexistence of adenomyosis and infertility, to date a causal relationship among these conditions has not been fully confirmed. Preterm birth and preterm premature rupture of membranes, uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony, and ectopic pregnancy have all been reported in association with adenomyosis.

The common symptoms include dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and abnormal uterine bleeding, but these do not allow diagnosis. Therefore, imaging plays an important role because establishment of the correct preoperative diagnosis is critical to avoid unnecessary intervention. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a highly accurate noninvasive modality for diagnosis of adenomyosis, differentiation of adenomyosis from other gynecologic disorders, and planning of appropriate treatment. Although the typical MR imaging findings are well established, adenomyosis actually varies widely in terms of histopathologic features (adenomyosis with sparse glands), growth patterns (polypoid adenomyoma, adenomyotic cyst, and miniature uterus), responses to hormonal activity (tamoxifen, decidual changes), and responses to treatment (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist). The MR imaging findings of adenomyosis occasionally mimic those of uterine malignancy or ovarian cancer. Furthermore, malignancy occasionally develops in otherwise benign adenomyosis. Pitfalls in diagnosis of adenomyosis include myometrial contractions, leiomyoma, adenomatoid tumor, metastases, endometrial carcinoma, and endometrial stromal sarcoma. Knowledge of the various appearances of adenomyosis and the possible pitfalls in differential diagnosis help guide the determination of appropriate treatment options.

However, the recent development of high-quality non-invasive techniques such as transvaginal sonography (TVS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hysteroscopy has renewed interest in diagnosing adenomyosis in the office prior to any treatment. Hysteroscopy offers the advantage of direct visualization of the uterine cavity, and since nowadays it is performed in the office, it can be offered as a first-line diagnostic tool for evaluation of uterine abnormalities in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding and/or infertility. The available data clearly indicate that high-quality mini-hysteroscopes, saline as a distension medium, and atraumatic insertion technique are essential for the success of office hysteroscopy. The procedure is indicated in any situation in which an intrauterine anomaly is suspected; it is immediately preceded by a physical exam and a TVS to evaluate uterine characteristics, and it is followed by a second TVS to take advantage of the intracavitary fluid for a contrast image of the uterus. Although diagnostic hysteroscopy does not provide pathognomonic signs for adenomyosis, some evidence suggests that irregular endometrium with endometrial defects, altered vascularization, and cystic haemorrhagic lesion are possibly associated with the entity. In addition to the direct visualization of the uterine cavity, the hysteroscopic approach offers the possibility of obtaining endometrial/myometrial biopsies under visual control. Since they can be performed in the office, the combination of TVS, fluid hysteroscopy and contrast sonography is therefore a powerful screening tool for detecting endometrial and myometrial abnormalities in association with adenomyosis.\n\nProteomics Identification of Annexin A2 as a Key Mediator in the Metastasis and Proangiogenesis of Endometrial Cells in Human Adenomyosis*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhou, Shengtao; Yi, Tao; Liu, Rui; Bian, Ce; Qi, Xiaorong; He, Xiang; Wang, Kui; Li, Jingyi; Zhao, Xia; Huang, Canhua; Wei, Yuquan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAdenomyosis is a common estrogen-dependent disorder of females characterized by a downward extension of the endometrium into the uterine myometrium and neovascularization in ectopic lesions. It accounts for chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and infertility in 8.8â61.5% women worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms for adenomyosis development remain poorly elucidated. Here, we utilized a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/MS-based proteomics analysis to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins in matched ectopic and eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis patients. A total of 93 significantly altered proteins were identified by tandem MS analysis. Further cluster analysis revealed a group of estrogen-responsive proteins as dysregulated in adenomyosis, among which annexin A2, a member of annexin family proteins, was found up-regulated most significantly in the ectopic endometrium of adenomyosis compared with its eutopic counterpart. Overexpression of ANXA2 was validated in ectopic lesions of human adenomyosis and was found to be tightly correlated with markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and dysmenorrhea severity of adenomyosis patients. Functional analysis demonstrated that estrogen could remarkably up-regulate ANXA2 and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in an in vitro adenomyosis model. Enforced expression of ANXA2 could mediate phenotypic mesenchymal-like cellular changes, with structural and functional alterations in a Î²-catenin/T-cell factor (Tcf) signaling-associated manner, which could be reversed by inhibition of ANXA2 expression. We also proved that enforced expression of ANXA2 enhanced the proangiogenic capacity of adenomyotic endometrial cells through HIF-1Î±/VEGF-A pathway. In vivo, we demonstrated that ANXA2 inhibition abrogated endometrial tissue growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis in an adenomyosis nude mice model and significantly alleviated hyperalgesia. Taken together, our data\n\nDuration of dysmenorrhoea and extent of adenomyosis visualised by magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nKissler, S; Zangos, S; Kohl, J; Wiegratz, I; Rody, A; GÃ¤tje, R; Vogl, T J; Kunz, G; Leyendecker, G; Kaufmann, M\n\n2008-04-01\n\nEnlargement of the junctional zone (JZ) on T2-weighted resonance imaging of the uterus has recently been established as the major criterion for adenomyosis in patients with endometriosis. This study was conducted to analyse the extent of adenomyosis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and relate it to the duration of dysmenorrhoea. This was a prospective study of 70 patients presenting with the complaint of severe dysmenorrhoea. Forty patients (57%) reported dysmenorrhoea as their major complaint and 30 patients (43%) suffered additionally from infertility. Group I (n=40) consisted of patients with dysmenorrhoea of between 1 and 10 years' duration, group II (n=30) consisted of patients with dysmenorrhoea of longer than 11 years' duration. All patients underwent laparoscopy to detect the presence and degree of endometriosis, and all patients underwent T2-weighted resonance imaging of the uterus to detect the extent of adenomyosis by measurement of the \"junctional zone\". In group I, adenomyosis could be detected via MRI in 21 patients (52.5%), while 19 patients (47.5%) showed no signs of adenomyosis. By contrast, in group II a distinct enlargement of the JZ, as the major radiological criterion of adenomyosis, could be observed in 26 patients (87%), while only 4 patients (13%) revealed no signs of adenomyosis (p=0.04). The mean thickness of the JZ was significantly enlarged in group II (11.07 mm) compared with group I (6.38 mm; p<0.0001). The prevalence of adenomyosis in endometriosis after dysmenorrhoea of more than 11 years' duration was 87%. In deep infiltrating endometriosis, a correlation between a specific localisation and dysmenorrhoea can often not be found. Recently, endometriosis and adenomyosis have been believed to result from a common uterine disease, the dislocation of the basal endometrium. Our data clearly show that dysmenorrhoea of long duration in patients who have had endometriosis for over a threshold value of 11 years is significantly related\n\nClinical characteristics indicating adenomyosis at the time of hysterectomy: a retrospective study in 291 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaran, F Andrei; Wallwiener, Markus; Kabashi, Drita; Rothmund, Ralf; Rall, Katharina; Kraemer, Bernhard; Brucker, Sara Y\n\n2012-06-01\n\nTo better characterize adenomyosis as a disease entity. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of women undergoing hysterectomy with a histologic diagnosis of adenomyosis, adenomyosis and leiomyomas, and leiomyomas alone. The study included 291 women: 38 with adenomyosis alone, 56 with adenomyosis and leiomyomas, and 197 with leiomyomas alone. In univariate analysis, women with adenomyosis were younger (p = 0.018) and had lower uterine weights (p < 0.001) and more disease-specific symptoms (p = 0.008). In multinomial logistic regression analysis, a lower uterine weight (OR 0.99, CI 95% 0.99-1.0), pelvic pain (OR 4.8, CI 95% 1.5-15.2), a history of smoking (OR 2.6, CI 95% 1.1-6.5) and at least one delivery (OR 4.3, CI 95% 1.5-12.3) were associated with a greater likelihood of having adenomyosis but not leiomyomas alone. Women undergoing hysterectomy with adenomyosis alone have different clinical characteristics from women with adenomyosis and leiomyomas and from those with only leiomyomas.\n\nAbnormal expression of Nrf2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Ning; Du, Baoying; Zhou, Hao; Shen, Fengxian; Li, Juan; Xie, Zhenwei\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo explore the expression level of Nrf2 in adenomyosis and study the mechanism of abnormal expression of Nrf2 in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. Western blot, immunohistochemistry(IHC) and real time PCR were used to measure Nrf2 expression levels in tissue and cell samples. Knockdown and overexpression of Nrf2 were used to investigate the variation of migration ability of endometrial glandular cells as well as the regulatory mechanism. Nrf2 protein levels were significantly higher in the eutopic and ectopic endometrial glands when compared with control cases using IHC and western blot methods. (p< 0.05). However, there was no statistical difference in Nrf2 mRNA expression levels between the adenomyosis and control groups. Using an agonist and Nrf2 siRNA, we regulated the Nrf2 protein levels of primary cultured endometrial glandular cells. With increased expression of Nrf2, cell scratch assay showed that the agonist-treated group migrated significantly faster than the control group, with MMP9 protein level markedly elevated. In contrast, Nrf2 siRNA-treated group migrated slower than the control group, with decreased expression of MMP9 protein. All of the scratching healing spaces and protein levels between the treated and control groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05). Abnormal expression of Nrf2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of adenomyosis. Specified reduction of Nrf2 expression could prove to be a new therapeutic target in the clinical treatment of adenomyosis.\n\nExpression of CD56 in patients with adenomyosis and its correlation with dysmenorrhea.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Fei; Shi, Xixi; Qin, Xiaoyan; Wen, ZeQing; Zhao, Xingbo; Li, Changzhong\n\n2015-11-01\n\nTo investigate the expression of CD56 in endometrial samples from patients with adenomyosis and its relationship with menstrual cycle phase and severity of dysmenorrhea. 40 patients with histologically proved adenomyosis (proliferative n=20; secretory n=20) and dysmenorrhea were examined in this study, control groups includes 20 patients with adenomyosis without dysmenorrhea (main complaint: menorrhagia) and 20 patients without adenomyosis who had undergone hysterectomy for non-endometrial pathology (no dysmenorrhea medical history). Immunohistochemical staining against CD56 was performed for the eutopic and ectopic endometrium from patients with adenomyosis and the control samples. The expression of CD56 was determined by calculating the H-score and the severity of dysmenorrhea was determined using the visual analogue scale. The menstrual cycle status and the disease severity were compared to the levels of staining. CD56 was expressed mainly in the endometrial glandular epithelium in patients with adenomyosis and normal endometrium. The epithelial staining intensity of CD56 in ectopic lesions of adenomyosis with dysmenorrhea was obviously higher than in the corresponding eutopic endometrium and control groups (P<0.01). There were no statistical differences in the expression between normal endometrium, eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis with dysmenorrhea and adenomyostic samples without dysmenorrhea. For eutopic endometrium in adenomyosis with dysmenorrhea, expression was higher in the secretory phases than in the proliferative phase (P<0.05). The increased CD56 immunoreactivity correlated with the severity of dysmenorrhea (spearman rho=0.84, P<0.01). These findings suggest that the expression of CD56 in adenomyosis is positively associated with the severity of dysmenorrhea. Endometrial glandular epithelium is likely to secrete more CD56 and stimulating nerve growth in the stroma, which could then play a role in the pathogenesis of adenomoysis-related dysmenorrhea\n\nIntrapartum uterine rupture with coincidental uterine adenomyosis in an African wild dog (Lycaon pictus).\n\nPubMed\n\nNewell-Fugate, Annie; Lane, Emily\n\n2009-12-01\n\nA 7-yr-old African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) multiparous bitch experienced severe dystocia and death one day after the onset of parturition. Necropsy revealed three placental attachments in the right uterine horn and one in the left. A full-thickness rupture of the right horn at the middle placental attachment and an autolysed fetus free in the abdomen were present. Death was attributed to hypovolemic and endotoxemic shock after uterine rupture. Myometrium adjacent to the rupture and in the left uterine horn was subdivided into irregular pseudolobules by fibrous connective tissue tracts containing small endometrial glandular acini suggestive of adenomyosis, which may have facilitated uterine rupture. This is the first reported case of dystocia-induced uterine rupture and of adenomyosis in a wild dog.\n\nAbnormal expression of Nrf2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of adenomyosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhou, Hao; Shen, Fengxian; Li, Juan; Xie, Zhenwei\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective To explore the expression level of Nrf2 in adenomyosis and study the mechanism of abnormal expression of Nrf2 in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis.

One hundred and fifty three patients were examined. Ninety-seven patients were with suspected adenomyosis and 56 patients were with unremarkable myometrium. Adenomyosis was confirmed in 39 cases (A subgroup) and excluded in 14 cases (B subgroup) in the main group based on morphological examination. All patients underwent ultrasound examination using an Aixplorer (Supersonic Imagine, France) scanner with application of shear wave elastography during transvaginal scanning. Retrospective analysis of the elastography criteria against the findings from morphological/histological examination was performed. The following values of Young's modulus were found in subgroup A (adenomyosis): Emean - 72.7 (22.6-274.2) kPa (median, 5-95th percentiles), Emax - 94.8 (29.3-300.0) kPa, SD - 9.9 (2.6-26.3) kPa; in subgroup B (non adenomyosis) - 28.3 (12.7-59.5) kPa, 33.6 (16.0-80.8) kPa, 3.0 (1.4-15.6) kPa; in the control group - 24.4 (17.9-32.4) kPa, 29.8 (21.6-40.8) kPa, 2.3 (1.3-6.1) kPa, respectively (Pâ<â0.05 for all comparison with subgroup Ð and the control group).

However, there is no report demonstrating the natural course from adenomyosis to adenocarcinoma. We report a patient (a 41-year-old Japanese woman) who was observed every 6 months after being diagnosed with adenomyosis at our University Hospital. Although she went through menopause at age 51, she occasionally complained subsequently of abnormal genital bleeding. Eleven years after the initial diagnosis, endometrial cytology revealed the presence of malignant cells. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated replacement of the adenomyotic lesion by a poorly demarcated lesion, compared to the findings on prior MRI. Consequently, we performed a modified radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, under a presumptive diagnosis of adenocarcinoma arising in adenomyosis. Histological diagnosis revealed an endometrioid adenocarcinoma (G3) transformed from adenomyotic epithelium, which was classified, according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, as stage Ic, pT1cN0M0. In this patient, periodic MRI evaluations, in conjunction with pathological examination, identified the transformation from adenomyosis to adenocarcinoma.\n\nImaging for uterine myomas and adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nShwayder, James; Sakhel, Khaled\n\n2014-01-01\n\nUterine myomas and adenomyosis are common findings, in particular in patients with symptoms of abdominal enlargement, pelvic pressure, abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia.

Several patterns of 'abnormality' described on imaging have been linked to adenomyosis, but the correlation is weak and the diagnostic accuracy is low outside of a research context. Nevertheless, thickening or abnormality of the subendometrial myometrium, the outer part of the 'endometrial-subendometrial myometrium unit' (thought to be important in human fertility) has been repeatedly documented on imaging, called 'adenomyosis' and linked to infertility. This paper discusses the value of the physiological endometrial-subendometrial myometrium unit in human fertility, reviews the current criteria for its imaging, and reports on its relationship to fertility. It is proposed that endometrial-subendometrial myometrium unit disruption disease is considered as a new entity (distinguished from adenomyosis), the diagnosis of which is feasible and straightforward on imaging and expressed mainly by pathological thickening or abnormality of the subendometrial myometrium (myometrial halo or junctional zone). The study also reports on the influence of abnormal thickening or disruption on human fertility and outcome of assisted reproduction techniques, and demonstrates that this new entity is epidemiologically different from adenomyosis.\n\nInfluence of adenomyosis on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in women with endometriosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nScala, Carolina; Leone Roberti Maggiore, Umberto; Racca, Annalisa; Barra, Fabio; Vellone, Valerio Gaetano; Venturini, Pier Luigi; Ferrero, Simone\n\n2017-12-20\n\nSeveral studies investigated the correlation between endometriosis and adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. However, the role of adenomyosis as a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes in women with endometriosis has yet to be established. The aim of this study was to explore if fetal and maternal outcomes, in particular the incidence of small for gestational age (SGA) infants, are different in pregnant women with endometriosis (E) and the concomitant presence of diffuse (EDA) and focal ademonyosis (EFA). This is a retrospective analysis of a database collected prospectively during a three-year period. We included 206 pregnant women with endometriosis; 148 (71.8%) with E, 38 (18.4%) with EFA and 20 (9.7%) with EDA. Adenomyosis was diagnosed by ultrasonography, it was classified in focal or diffuse. The study included patients who conceived spontaneously or by assisted reproductive techniques. The three groups were similar in demographic characteristics (age, body mass index, mode of conception). Patients with diffuse adenomyosis compared with those with only endometriosis had significantly lower PAPP-A MoM (0.61 vs 0.88 MoM, p<0.001), higher mean uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA PI) in the 1st (2.23 vs 1.67, p<0.001) and 2nd (1.30 vs 0.94, p<0.001) trimester of pregnancy, and higher incidence of SGA (40% vs 10.8%, p<0.001; respectively). No statistically significant difference was found in patients with focal adenomyosis compared to those with only endometriosis. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that diffuse adenomyosis (OR=3.744 CI 95%1.158-12.099; p=0.027) was the only independent risk factors for SGA. The presence of diffuse adenomyosis in pregnant women with endometriosis is is strongly associated with SGA infants. Women with diffuse adenomyosis should be treated as being at high risk of placental dysfunction, therefore, these pregnancies might need a closer monitoring. This article is protected by copyright.

Although there is a lack of consensus on adenomyosis classification, three subtypes are described, internal, external adenomyosis, and adenomyomas. Using TVS, whatever the subtype, pooled sensitivities, pooled specificities, and pooled positive likelihood ratios are 0.72-0.82, 0.85-0.81, and 4.67-3.7, respectively, but with a high heterogeneity between the studies. MRI has a pooled sensitivity of 0.77, specificity of 0.89, positive likelihood ratio of 6.5, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.2 for all subtypes. Our results suggest that MRI is more useful than TVS in the diagnosis of adenomyosis. Further studies are required to determine the performance of direct signs (cystic component) and indirect signs (characteristics of junctional zone) to avoid misdiagnosis of adenomyosis.

Dysmenorrhea, abnormal uterine bleeding, chronic pelvic pain, and deep dyspareunia are common symptoms of this pathological condition. However, adenomyosis is often an incidental finding in specimens obtained from hysterectomy or uterine biopsies. The recent evolution of diagnostic imaging techniques, such as transvaginal sonography, hysterosalpingography, and magnetic resonance imaging, has contributed to improving accuracy in the identification of this pathology. Hysteroscopy offers the advantage of direct visualization of the uterine cavity while giving the option of collecting histological biopsy samples under visual control. Hysteroscopy is not a first-line treatment approach for adenomyosis and it represents a viable option only in selected cases of focal or diffuse \"superficial\" forms. During office hysteroscopy, it is possible to enucleate superficial focal adenomyomas or to evacuate cystic haemorrhagic lesions of less than 1.5âcm in diameter. Instead, resectoscopic treatment is indicated in cases of superficial adenomyotic nodules > 1.5âcm in size and for diffuse superficial adenomyosis. Finally, endometrial ablation may be performed with the additional removal of the underlying myometrium.\n\nUterine adenomyosis and in vitro fertilization outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nVercellini, Paolo; Consonni, Dario; Dridi, Dhouha; Bracco, Benedetta; Frattaruolo, Maria Pina; Somigliana, Edgardo\n\n2014-05-01\n\nIs adenomyosis associated with IVF/ICSI outcome in terms of clinical pregnancy rate? In a meta-analysis of published data, women with adenomyosis had a 28% reduction in the likelihood of clinical pregnancy at IVF/ICSI compared with women without adenomyosis. Estimates of the effect of adenomyosis on IVF/ICSI outcome are inconsistent. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted. A Medline search was performed to identify all the comparative studies published from January 1998 to June 2013 in the English language literature on IVF/ICSI outcome in women with and without adenomyosis. Two authors independently performed the literature screening, scrutinized articles of potential interest, selected relevant studies and extracted data. Studies were categorized based on research design. Of the 17 articles assessed in detail, 9 were finally selected based on diagnosis of adenomyosis at magnetic resonance imaging or transvaginal ultrasonography. The quality of studies was evaluated by means of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A total of 1865 women were enrolled in the 9 selected studies, 665 of whom in 4 prospective observational studies, and 1200 in 5 retrospective studies. The dichotomous data for clinical pregnancy and secondary outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and were combined in a meta-analysis using the random-effects model. The heterogeneity Cochrane's Q and the I(2) statistics were calculated. Egger's approach to testing the significance of funnel plot asymmetry was also used. The clinical pregnancy rate achieved after IVF/ICSI was 123/304 (40.5%) women with adenomyosis versus 628/1262 (49.8%) in those without adenomyosis. The RR of clinical pregnancy ranged from 0.37 (95% CI, 0.15-0.92) to 1.20 (95% CI, 0.58-2.45), with a significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2) = 56.8%, P = 0.023). Pooling of the results yielded a common RR of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55-0.95).

Uteri were obtained from women undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions, including 26 cases of uterine leiomyomas, 24 cases of adenomyosis, 18 adenomyomas and 6 cases of autopsy specimens. Specific histochemical staining techniques were employed in order to demonstrate the distribution of elastin. The distribution of elastin components in the uterus was markedly uneven and showed a decreasing gradient from outer to inner myometrium. No elastin was present within leiomyomas, adenomyomas or adenomyosis. The distribution of elastin may help explain the normal function of the myometrium in labor. It implies that the uneven distribution of elastin components and absence of elastin within leiomyomas, adenomyomas and adenomyosis could be of some clinical significance. The altered elastin distribution in disease states may help explain such symptoms as dysmenorrhea in uterine endometriosis.\n\nFocal adenomyosis (intramural endometriotic cyst) in a very young patient - differential diagnosis with uterine fibromatosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nManta, L; Suciu, N; Constantin, A; Toader, O; Popa, F\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntroduction. Adenomyosis is a widespread disease usually affecting the late reproductive years of the womenâs life, which has a great impact on their fertility. The most common form is diffuse adenomyosis, while focal adenomyosis, a cystic variant, is very rare, particularly in patients younger than 30 years old. Materials and methods. We reported a rare case of a 20-year-old Caucasian woman with cystic adenomyosis who was admitted in our service with severe chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and menorrhagia, who had received conservative surgical treatment to preserve fertility and improve her obstetrical prognosis. Results and Discussions. Although the necrobiosis of a uterine fibroid was suspected preoperatively, the extemporaneous histopathological exam revealed adenomyosis associated with fibroleiomyoma with hyaline dystrophy and multiple foci of endometriosis of cystic formation in the wall of a young woman without any risk factors. Conclusion. Although a rare lesion in young patients, cystic adenomyosis should be considered when chronic pelvic pain is exacerbated during menstruation and is associated with a uterine tumor. In young patients, the differential diagnosis should be made with uterine malformations (hematometra), necrobiosis of uterine fibroids, pelvic endometriosis. The surgical treatment should be conservative with the excision of the lesion, always taking into account fertility preservation in young patients.

Materials and methods In all, 245 patients with adenomyosis who underwent ultrasound guided HIFU (USgHIFU) were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after HIFU treatment. The non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio, energy efficiency factor (EEF) and greyscale change were set as dependent variables, while the factors possibly affecting ablation efficiency were set as independent variables. These variables were used to build multiple regression models. Results A total of 245 patients with adenomyosis successfully completed HIFU treatment. Enhancement type on T1 weighted image (WI), abdominal wall thickness, volume of adenomyotic lesion, the number of hyperintense points, location of the uterus, and location of adenomyosis all had a linear relationship with the NPV ratio. Distance from skin to the adenomyotic lesion's ventral side, enhancement type on T1WI, volume of adenomyotic lesion, abdominal wall thickness, and signal intensity on T2WI all had a linear relationship with EEF. Location of the uterus and abdominal wall thickness also both had a linear relationship with greyscale change. Conclusion The enhancement type on T1WI, signal intensity on T2WI, volume of adenomyosis, location of the uterus and adenomyosis, number of hyperintense points, abdominal wall thickness, and distance from the skin to the adenomyotic lesion's ventral side can all be used as predictors of HIFU for adenomyosis.\n\nVery early stage adenocarcinoma arising from adenomyosis in the uterus.\n\nPubMed\n\nHsu, Ming-I; Chou, Szu-Yuan; Lin, Sey-En; Liang, So-Jung; Chiu, Hsiao-Chen; Hsu, Chun-Sen\n\n2006-12-01\n\nMalignant transformations of adenomyosis in premenopausal women with normal endometrium are extremely rare. We report a case of adenocarcinoma arising from an adenomyotic focus in the uterus, which was found unexpectedly in a woman undergoing myomectomy for adenomyosis. A 47-year-old premenopausal woman presented with massive vaginal bleeding and anemia. She was admitted and underwent myomectomy under the initial diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma. Microscopic studies revealed endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which was a malignant transformation of a focus of adenomyosis in the surgical specimen. A total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was then performed. Pathologic studies showed no residual tumors in the entire resected specimen except for the previous lesion. The endometrium had normal thickness with mild proliferative activity throughout the cavity. There was no atrophic or hyperplastic change in the whole endometrium. The adenocarcinoma was present exclusively in the myometrium, and a transition between the carcinoma and the adenomyotic glands was observed. This case report presents evidence that adenocarcinoma may a rise de novo from an adenomyotic lesion in the uterus.\n\nAdenomyosis: from the sign to the diagnosis. Imaging, diagnostic pitfalls and differential diagnosis: a pictorial review.\n\nPubMed\n\nValentini, A L; Speca, S; Gui, B; Soglia, G; Soglia, B G; MiccÃ², M; Bonomo, L\n\n2011-12-01\n\nAdenomyosis is a pathological gynaecological condition characterised by benign invasion of the endometrium into the myometrium. It is often misdiagnosed, or is not easily recognised, although it is responsible for disabling symptoms such as menorrhagia, abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhoea and infertility in premenopausal women. The aim of this pictorial review is to analyse the features of adenomyosis by illustrating the most usual and typical imaging patterns, along with the unusual appearances, seen in a vast array of gynaecological imaging modalities. The different findings of focal and diffuse adenomyosis along with the diagnostic limitations of ultrasound, hysterosalpingography and magnetic resonance imaging are described, as are the pitfalls and differential diagnosis with other pathological conditions that are often misdiagnosed as adenomyosis. The role of the different imaging modalities in planning appropriate treatment and their usefulness in monitoring therapy are also discussed.\n\nAn unusual case of uterine cotyledonoid dissecting leiomyoma with adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nShimizu, Ai; Tanaka, Hoshihito; Iwasaki, Sari; Wakui, Yukio; Ikeda, Hitoshi; Suzuki, Akira\n\n2016-08-04\n\nCotyledonoid dissecting leiomyoma is a rare variant of uterine smooth muscle tumor with an unusual growth pattern that shows intramural dissection within uterine myometrium and often a placenta-like appearance in its extrauterine components. We present a unique case of cotyledonoid dissecting leiomyoma with adenomyosis. A 40-year-old Japanese female presented with prolonged menorrhagia and severe anemia. She had a pelvic mass followed-up for 6Â years with a diagnosis of leiomyoma. However, increase in tumor size and cystic changes with hemorrhage were found by magnetic resonance imaging, and total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy was performed. Macroscopically, the placenta-like exophytic mass protruding from the posterior uterine wall was composed of multiple nodules containing numerous hemorrhagic cysts. The mass showed continuity as a white multinodular dissecting mass infiltrating the posterolateral myometrium. Microscopically, both extra-and intrauterine portions of the mass were composed of nodules that contained swirled neoplastic smooth muscle cells with marked hyalinized degeneration, as observed in cotyledonoid dissecting leiomyomas of conventional type. In addition, numerous non-neoplastic glands of endometrial type surrounded by abundant endometrium-like stromal cells and non-neoplastic smooth muscle cells were found in the tumor, suggesting that it involved a part of concomitant adenomyosis originating from the nontumoral myometrium. Thus far, over 30 cases of cotyledonoid dissecting leiomyoma have been reported, none of which have described the presence of adenomyosis within the tumor. The present case suggested that cotyledonoid dissecting leiomyoma might have a unique clinical presentation involving concomitant uterine adenomyosis. It is critical for pathologists, gynecologists, and radiologists to be cognizant of cotyledonoid dissecting leiomyoma variants for timely and appropriate diagnosis and treatment.\n\nActivation of the MAPK/ERK Cell-Signaling Pathway in Uterine Smooth Muscle Cells of Women With Adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nStreuli, Isabelle; Santulli, Pietro; Chouzenoux, Sandrine; Chapron, Charles; Batteux, FrÃ©dÃ©ric\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe investigated whether the myometrium might be intrinsically different in women with adenomyosis. We studied whether the mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPKs/ERKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/AKT (PI3K/mTOR/AKT) cell-signaling pathways, implicated in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, might also be activated in uterine smooth muscle cells (uSMCs) of women with adenomyosis and measured the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), proinflammatory mediators that modulate cell proliferation and have been shown to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway in endometriosis. The uSMC cultures were derived from myometrium biopsies obtained during hysterectomy or myomectomy in women with adenomyosis and controls with leiomyoma. Proliferation of uSMCs and in vitro activation of the MAPK/ERK cell-signaling pathway were increased in women with adenomyosis compared to controls. The activation of the PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway was not significant. The ROS production and ROS detoxification pathways were not different between uSMCs of women with adenomyosis and controls suggesting an ROS-independent activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Our results also provide evidence that protein kinase inhibitors and the rapanalogue temsirolimus can control proliferation of uSMCs in vitro suggesting an implication of the MAPK/ERK and the PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathways in proliferation of uSMCs in women with adenomyosis and leiomyomas.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a critical role in producing pain, neural plasticity, immunocyte aggregation and release of inflammatory factors. This study aimed to investigate the expression of NGF and its two receptors in uteri and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in an adenomyosis mouse model, as well as their relationship with the severity of adenomyosis. Forty newborn ICR mice were randomly divided into the adenomyosis model group and control group (n = 20 in each group). Mice in the adenomyosis model group were orally dosed with 2.7 Î¼mol/kg tamoxifen on days 2-5 after birth. Experiments were conducted to identify the expression of NGF- beta and its receptors, tyrosine kinase receptor (trkA) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), in the uterus and DRG in four age groups (90+/-5 d, 140+/-5 d, 190+/-5 d and 240+/-5 d; n = 5 mice in each group) by western bolt, immunochemistry and real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Adenomyosis, which became more serious as age increased, was successfully induced in dosed ICR mice. NGF-beta, trkA and p75NTR protein levels in the uterus and trkA mRNA levels in DRG were higher in the older aged adenomyosis model group than those in controls (190+/-5 d and 240+/-5 d groups, P < 0.05). The expression of NGF-beta and its receptors in the uterus increased gradually as age increased for adenomyosis mice (190+/-5 d and 240+/-5 d, P < 0.05, compared with 90+/-5 d) but it showed little change in control mice. The mRNA level of trkA in DRG also increased as age increased in the adenomyosis model group (190+/-5 d and 240+/-5 d, P < 0.05, compared with 90+/-5 d) but was unchanged in controls. The mRNA level of p75NTR in DRG was not different between the adenomyosis and control groups and was stable from young to old mice. NGF- beta can be used as an indicator for the severity of adenomyosis\n\nUtero-tubal sperm transport and its impairment in endometriosis and adenomyosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKissler, Stefan; Zangos, Stephan; Wiegratz, Inka; Kohl, Joachim; Rody, Achim; Gaetje, Regine; Doebert, Natascha; Wildt, Ludwig; Kunz, Georg; Leyendecker, Gerhard; Kaufmann, Manfred\n\n2007-04-01\n\nThe uterus is composed of different smooth muscle layers that serve various functions. First, menstrual debris is expulsed at the time of the menses. Second, sperm is transported in the preovulatory phase to maximize fertility, and third, the human embryo is placed in an adequate setting during implantation. Endometriosis is a gynecologic disorder leading to severe pain symptoms such as severe pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea), chronic pelvic pain, pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), and abnormal uterine bleeding. Besides, endometriosis is often associated with female infertility and exhibits a massive impairment in the physiology of uterine contractility that can be documented by the in vivo examination method of hysterosalpingoscintigraphy (HSSG). In addition, endometriosis is associated in 80-90% of subjects with adenomyosis and our data clearly indicate that sperm transport is disturbed by hyperperistalsis when at least one focus of adenomyosis can be detected via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and turns into dysperistalsis (a complete failure in sperm transport capacity) when diffuse adenomyosis affecting all myometrial uterine muscle layers is detected. Hence, dysperistalsis is significantly associated with reduced spontaneous pregnancy rates. We therefore recommend MRI and HSSG in every sterility workup.\n\nA rare case of uterine adenomyosis in a Siamese cat.\n\nPubMed\n\nBulman-Fleming, Julie\n\n2008-07-01\n\nA 12-year-old, female Siamese cat with a long-term history of megestrol acetate treatment for suppression of estrus was presented with vomiting and abdominal pain.

From January 2010 to December 2011, 350 patients with adenomyosis were treated with USgHIFU. Among the 350 patients, 224 of them completed the two years follow-up. The patients were followed up at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after HIFU treatment. Adverse effects and complications were recorded. All patients completed HIFU ablation without severe postoperative complications. 203 of the 224 patients who showed varying degrees of dysmenorrhea before treatment had the symptom scores decreased significantly after treatment (P<0.001). The relief rate was 84.7%, 84.7%, and 82.3%, respectively at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment. The menstrual volume in 109 patients with menorrhagia was significantly improved after treatment (P<0.001) with a relief rate of 79.8%, 80.7%, and 78.9%, respectively at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after HIFU treatment.

There were 22 cases of adenomyosis hysterectomy in the adenomyosis group and 12 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III removal of the uterus in the control group. USMC were separated and cultured in vitro, incubated with different concentrations of estrogen and progesterone. We used reverse transcription-PCR to dectect the expression of large-conductance calcium- and voltage-sensitive potassium channel Î± subunit (BKCa Î±) and voltage-gated potassium channel 4.3 (Kv4.3). The mRNA expression of BKCa Î± and Kv4.3 in the adenomyosis group (4.43Â±2.05 and 4.52Â±1.97) were significantly higher than those in the control group (0.83Â±0.25 and 0.86Â±0.19, P<0.05). In the control group, Kv4.3 mRNA decreased after treated with 0.1 nmol/L (0.17Â±0.10) and 1.0 nmol/L (0.13Â±0.08) estrogen than before (0.55Â±0.29, P<0.05).

There is an abnormal expression of potassium channels in the adenomyosis USMC, which is regulated by high concentration of estrogen and might be resistant to progesterone.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging of degeneration of uterine adenomyosis during pregnancy and post-partum period.\n\nPubMed\n\nHirashima, Hiroto; Ohkuchi, Akihide; Usui, Rie; Kijima, Shigeyoshi; Matsubara, Shigeki\n\n2018-03-08\n\nDegeneration of adenomyosis during pregnancy and the post-partum period is very rare.

The noncontrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 22âweeks demonstrated a poorly demarcated hypointense area at the posterior uterine wall on T1- and T2-weighted imaging. The 2nd MRI 2âweeks after the cesarean section showed hypointensity on a T1-weighted image and hyperintensity on a T2-weighted image, allowing confirmation of the diagnosis of degeneration of adenomyosis.

Patient concerns: A 38-year-old woman presented with amenorrhea for 8 weeks and serum HCG levels of 1455 mmol/L. The B ultrasound showed an endometrial thickness of 1.7âcm, and the presence of a cystic structure (16 6âmm) at the right uterine horn. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) accurately detected and confirmed the position of the cystic structure with its clear boundaries. Diagnoses: Cornual ectopic pregnancy in adenomyosis. Interventions: The diagnosis was confirmed and treated by HIFU ablation. Total ablation was performed for 738 seconds without any bleeding. Outcomes: Serum HCG levels decreased to <â0.1âmmol/L after 60 days post operation, and follow-up for 11 months showed a regular menstrual cycle without dysmenorrhea. Gestational sac was not obvious at postoperative 90 days by MRI. The adenomyosis associated lesion with blood perfusion became smaller at postoperative 90 days. Lessons: In this case, we successfully performed HIFU ablation and treated the cornual ectopic pregnancy in an adenomyosis patient for the first time, without any adverse complications.

The patient complained of an irregular menstrual cycle and abnormal genital bleeding that gradually increased in amount and frequency. The patient finally became severely anemic, and a hysterectomy was therefore performed. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated hyperplasia of the endometrium, with a myometrial lesion, where a high signal intensity multicystic mass was observed. The preoperative diagnosis was complicated by confusing MRI results. Postoperative macroscopic examination revealed a villous endometrium and a myometrium thickened with multiple small cysts containing serous transparent fluid. The final diagnosis, based on the hysterectomy specimen, was adenomyosis coexisting with simple endometrial hyperplasia.

A total of 41 patients with adenomyosis suffering from pelvic pains and menorrhagia were recruited. First group was managed with oral dienogest (2 mg/day, orally) while the second group received triptorelin acetate (3.75 mg/4 weeks, subcutaneous injection) for 16 weeks. Outpatient follow-up was undertaken after 8 weeks but mean values were calculated at baseline and after 16 weeks (end of treatment). A total of 41 women were allocated to treatment with dienogest (n = 22) or triptorelin acetate (n = 19); 19 (86.4 %) and 18 (94.7 %) % of the respective groups completed the trial. Significant reductions in pelvic pains after 16 weeks treatment were obtained in both groups demonstrating the equivalence of dienogest relative to triptorelin acetate. Triptorelin acetate was more effective in controlling of menorrhagia and reduction of uterine volume. Dienogest may be a valuable alternative to depot triptorelin acetate for treatment of premenopausal pelvic pains in women with uterine adenomyosis.\n\nTreatment of cornual pregnancy in a patient with adenomyosis by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Lixia; Xu, Linying; Xu, Xiaoyan\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCornual ectopic pregnancy in adenomyosis patients is a rare clinical condition, which may require careful approach for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

In this case, we successfully performed HIFU ablation and treated the cornual ectopic pregnancy in an adenomyosis patient for the first time, without any adverse complications.\n\nHow to use PRICE treatment for soft tissue injuries.\n\nPubMed\n\nNorton, Cormac\n\n2016-08-24\n\nRationale and key points This article assists nurses to use the acronym PRICE (protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation) to guide the treatment of patients with uncomplicated soft tissue injuries to their upper or lower limbs. Â» Treatment of soft tissue injuries to limbs is important to reduce complications following injury, alleviate pain and ensure normal limb function is restored promptly. Â» Nurses should have an understanding of the rationale and evidence base supporting PRICE treatment of soft tissue injuries. Â» Providing accurate information to patients and carers about the management of soft tissue injuries and anticipated recovery time is an important aspect of treatment. Â» Further research is required to develop best practice in the treatment of soft tissue injuries.

Studies on endometriosis or adenomyosis and risk of preterm delivery and/or SGA infant were included. The systematic search was conducted for all published articles in PubMed and Embase published from 1950 to 2017 using specific search terms. After duplicates were removed, two authors independently reviewed all studies, initially based on title and subsequently based on abstract. Studies considered relevant were read in full text by both reviewers to identify if studies met the inclusion criteria. The search found 21 studies on a total of 2Â 517Â 516 women meeting the inclusion criteria. Women with endometriosis had an increased odds of preterm delivery [odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% CI 1.28-1.69] and SGA infant (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.549). Compared with endometriosis, adenomyosis implied an even higher odds of both preterm delivery (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.88-5.09) and SGA infant (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.71-6.09) as well. Women with endometriosis or adenomyosis had a higher odds of preterm delivery and having a child that was SGA compared with women without endometriosis or adenomyosis. The odds of both adverse birth outcomes was highest among women with adenomyosis. The results suggest a closer prenatal monitoring among pregnant women with endometriosis or adenomyosis.

This was a retrospective cohort study. The data was collected from 417 symptomatic adenomyosis patients who underwent ultrasound-guided HIFU between January 2012 and December 2015 at 1st Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. Among them were 260 patients with diffuse adenomyosis (Group D) and 157 patients with focal adenomyosis (Group F). All patients underwent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) one week before and the day after HIFU treatment. Successful treatment with HIFU was measured by the non-perfused volume ratio (NPVR). Intraprocedural and postprocedural adverse effects and complications were recorded to assess the safety of the procedure. Patients were followed-up for three months post-treatment. Complications were given a grade A through F according to the SIR Standards. All patients successfully completed the procedure, non-perfused regions appeared in 415 (99.5%) patients. The non-perfused volume ratio (NPVR) of Group D was significantly lower than that of Group F (P<0.05). During the procedure, the odds ratio of skin-burning pain was 1.7 (OR=1.617, 95% CI: 1.103-2.532), when comparing Group D with Group F, while the odds ratio of inguinal pain was equal to 2.0 (OR=2.038, 95% CI: 1.161-3.580), when Group F was compared to Group D. 97 patients (23.3%) received nominal therapy due to complications ([Society of interventional radiology, SIR]-B grade), among them, there were 62 cases (23.8%) in Group D and 35 cases (22.3%) in Group F. No significant difference was found between the two groups (P>0.05) and neither of the reported complications of SIR-C-SIR-F occurred within the two groups. Based on our results, ultrasound-guided HIFU is safe for the treatment of diffuse adenomyosis, and controlling the ablation zone is crucial to ensure patients' safety.
