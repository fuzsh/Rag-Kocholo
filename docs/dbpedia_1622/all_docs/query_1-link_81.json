        "text": "LOS ANGELES: “Oppenheimer,” a solemn three-hour biopic that became an unlikely billion-dollar box-office sensation, was crowned best picture at a 96th Academy Awards that doubled as a coronation for Christopher Nolan.\n\nAfter passing over arguably Hollywood’s foremost big-screen auteur for years, the Oscars made up for lost time by heaping seven awards on Nolan’s blockbuster biopic, including best actor for Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. and best director for Nolan.\n\nIn anointing “Oppenheimer,” the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences did something it hasn’t done for more than a decade: hand its top prize to a widely seen, big-budget studio film. In a film industry where a cape, dinosaur or Tom Cruise has often been a requirement for such box office, “Oppenheimer” brought droves of moviegoers to theaters with a complex, fission-filled drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb.\n\n“For better or worse, we’re all living in Robert Oppenheimer’s world,” said Murphy in his acceptance speech. “I’d like to dedicate this to the peacemakers.”\n\nAs a film heavy with unease for human capacity for mass destruction, “Oppenheimer” also emerged – even over its partner in cultural phenomenon, “Barbie” – as a fittingly foreboding film for times rife with cataclysm, man-made or not. Sunday’s Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles unfolded against the backdrop of wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and with a potentially momentous US election on the horizon.\n\nThe most closely watched contest of the Academy Awards went to Emma Stone, who won best actress for her performance as Bella Baxter in “Poor Things.”\n\nIn what was seen as the night’s most nail-biting category, Stone won over Lily Gladstone of “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Gladstone would have become the first Native American to win an Academy Award.\n\nInstead, Oscar voters couldn’t resist the full-bodied extremes of Stone’s “Poor Things” performance. The win for Stone, her second best actress Oscar following her 2017 win for “La La Land,” confirmed the 35-year-old as arguably the preeminent big-screen actress of her generation. The list of women to win best actress two or more times is illustrious, including Katharine Hepburn, Frances McDormand, Ingrid Bergman and Bette Davis.\n\n“Oh, boy, this is really overwhelming,” said Stone, who fought back tears and a broken dress during her speech.\n\nSunday’s broadcast had razzle dazzle, including a sprawling song-and-dance rendition of the “Barbie” hit “I’m Just Ken” by Ryan Gosling, with an assist on guitar by Slash and a sea of Kens who swarmed the stage.\n\nBut protest and politics intruded on an election-year Academy Awards, where demonstrations for Gaza raged outside the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Late during the show, Kimmel read a critical social media post from former president Donald Trump.\n\n“Thank you for watching,” said host Jimmy Kimmel. “Isn’t it passed your jail time?”\n\nNolan has had many movies in the Oscar mix before, including “Inception,” “Dunkirk” and “The Dark Knight.” But his win Sunday for direction is the first Academy Award for the 53-year-old filmmaker. Addressing the crowd, Nolan noted cinema is just over a hundred years old.\n\n“We don’t know where this incredible journey is going from here,” said Nolan. “But to think that I’m a meaningful part of it means the world to me.”\n\nDowney, nominated twice before (for “Chaplin” and “Tropic Thunder”), also notched his first Oscar, crowning the illustrious second act of his up-and-down career.\n\n“I’d like to thank my terrible childhood and the academy, in that order,” said Downey, the son of filmmaker Robert Downey Sr.\n\n“Barbie,” last year’s biggest box-office hit with more than $1.4 billion in ticket sales, ultimately won just one award: best song (sorry, Ken) for Billie Eilish and Finneas’ “What Was I Made For?” It’s their second Oscar, two years after winning for their James Bond theme, “No Time to Die.”\n\nBut after an awards season that stayed largely inside a Hollywood bubble, geopolitics played a prominent role. Protests over Israel’s war in Gaza snarled traffic around the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, slowing stars’ arrival on the red carpet and turning the Oscar spotlight toward the ongoing conflict. Some protesters shouted “Shame!” at those trying to reach the awards.\n\nJonathan Glazer, the British filmmaker whose chilling Auschwitz drama “The Zone of Interest” won best international film, drew connections between the dehumanization depicted in his film and today.\n\n“Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people, whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel, or the the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims, this dehumanization, how do we resist?”\n\nThe war in Gaza was on the minds of many attendees, as was the war in Ukraine. A year after “Navalny” won the same award, Mstyslav Chernov’s “20 Days in Mariupol,” a harrowing chronicle of the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, won best documentary. The win, a first for The Associated Press and PBS’ “Frontline,” came as the war in Ukraine passed the two-year mark with no signs of abating.\n\nMstyslav Chernov, the Ukrainian filmmaker and AP journalist whose hometown was bombed the day he learned of his Oscar nomination, spoke forcefully about Russia’s invasion.\n\n“This is the first Oscar in Ukrainian history,” said Chernov. “And I’m honored. Probably I will be the first director on this stage to say I wish I’d never made this film. I wish to be able to exchange this (for) Russia never attacking Ukraine.”\n\nIn the early going, Yorgos Lanthimos’ Frankenstein-riff “Poor Things” ran away with three prizes for its sumptuous craft, including awards for production design, makeup and hairstyling and costume design.\n\nKimmel, hosting the ABC telecast for the fourth time, opened the awards with an monologue that emphasized Hollywood as “a union town” following 2023’s actor and writer strikes, drew a standing ovation for bringing out teamsters and behind-the-scenes workers — who are now entering their own labor negotiations.\n\nThe night’s first award was one of its most predictable: Da’Vine Joy Randolph for best supporting actress, for her performance in Alexander Payne’s “The Holdovers.” An emotional Randolph was accompanied to the stage by her “Holdovers” co-star Paul Giamatti.\n\n“For so long I’ve always wanted to be different,” said Randolph. “And now I realize I just need to be myself.”\n\nThough Randolph’s win was widely expected, an upset quickly followed. Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron” won for best animated feature, a surprise over the slightly favored “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” Miyazaki, the 83-year-old Japanese anime master who came out of retirement to make “The Boy and the Heron,” didn’t attend the ceremony. He also didn’t attend the 2003 Oscars when his “Spirited Away” won the same award.\n\nBest original screenplay went to “Anatomy of a Fall,” which, like “Barbie,” was penned by a couple: director Justine Triet and Arthur Harari. “This will help me through my midlife crisis, I think,” said Triet.\n\nIn adapted screenplay, where “Barbie” was nominated — and where some suspected Greta Gerwig would win after being overlooked for director — the Oscar went to Cord Jefferson, who wrote and directed his feature film debut “American Fiction.” He pleaded for executives to take risks on young filmmakers like himself.\n\n“Instead of making a $200 million movie, try making 20 $10 million movies,” said Jefferson, previously an award-winning TV writer.\n\nThe Oscars belonged largely to theatrical-first films. Though it came into the awards with 19 nominations, Netflix was a bit player. Its lone win came for live action short: Wes Anderson’s “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,” based on the story by Roald Dahl.\n\nHistorically, having big movies in the mix for the Oscars’ top awards has been good for broadcast ratings. The Academy Awards’ largest audience ever came when James Cameron’s “Titanic” swept the 1998 Oscars.\n\nWinners in key categories for the 96th Academy Awards\n\nHOLLYWOOD: Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer\" was the big winner of the night with seven awards, while \"Poor Things\" — a female take on the Frankenstein story — won four.\n\nBest picture: \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest director: Christopher Nolan, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest actor: Cillian Murphy, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest actress: Emma Stone, \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest supporting actor: Robert Downey Jr, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest supporting actress: Da'Vine Joy Randolph, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nBest original screenplay: Justine Triet and Arthur Harari, \"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\nBest adapted screenplay: Cord Jefferson, \"American Fiction\"\n\nBest international feature film: \"The Zone of Interest\" (United Kingdom)\n\nBest animated feature: \"The Boy and the Heron\"\n\nBest documentary feature: \"20 Days in Mariupol\"\n\nBest original score: Ludwig Goransson, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest original song: Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell, \"What Was I Made For?\" from the \"Barbie\" soundtrack\n\nBest cinematography: Hoyte van Hoytema, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest film editing: Jennifer Lame, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest makeup and hairstyling: \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest costume design: \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest production design: \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest sound: \"The Zone of Interest\"\n\nBest visual effects: \"Godzilla Minus One\"\n\n(AFP)\n\nDUBAI: Although “Kaos” is steeped in the world of ancient Greek myth, its story of an aging, vain, thin-skinned despot desperate to be worshipped and prone to lash out indiscriminately in rage if he feels slighted is, sadly, very of-the-moment.\n\nIn this case, that despot is Zeus (played beautifully by Jeff Goldblum), king of the deities, who lives on Mount Olympus with his wife (who’s also his sister — that’s the ancient Greeks for you) Hera (a regal and weary-of-cleaning-up-Zeus’-messes Janet McTeer).\n\n“Kaos” is set in an alternative modern world where pantheism is still the prominent religion, and where the deities — and other figures from Greek mythology — move among humans. We jump into the action on the holy day of Olympia, when humans celebrate Zeus (via, among other ways, human sacrifice of a willing volunteer). A new monument to him is due to be unveiled, but when it is, it has been vandalized by a gang of Trojans. Coupled with the discovery of a new wrinkle on his forehead, this is enough to send Zeus spiraling, and he decides that an old prophecy about the end of his reign must be coming true — leading to ever-increasing paranoia and bad choices.\n\nThe catch is, at least according to the narrator, Prometheus (whom Zeus considers his closest friend, despite condemning him to an eternity chained to a rock while an eagle pecks at his liver), the prophecy is coming true. Or, at least, a series of events that will have the same effect is in motion.\n\nOstensibly, “Kaos” is a comedy. And there are certainly some very funny moments. But it’s also much deeper than that. In the first two episodes alone there are ruminations about the loneliness of falling out of love with your partner, gender politics, and the potential damage of parental expectations; (off-camera) infanticide; a magnificent scene of a young couple wordlessly pleading with The Fates to be allowed to enter the Underworld and try to recover their deceased son; and many takes on the danger of power. In other words, there’s a lot to sink your teeth into. And that’s without mentioning all the great portrayals of other figures from Greek myth (including Orpheus, Dionysus, Hades, Medusa, and Cassandra).\n\nShow creator Charlie Covell has crafted something very special with “Kaos.” It’s an intelligent, compelling, very funny, and deeply moving show that richly rewards — and deserves — your attention.\n\nDUBAI: From long-awaited sequels to an intriguing biopic, these are the Fall/Winter films we’re most looking forward to\n\nGladiator II\n\nStarring: Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Connie Nielsen\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nWhen: Nov. 21\n\nDiscussions about a sequel to Scott’s huge 2000 hit “Gladiator” reportedly began the following year. It was another 17 years before official confirmation of “Gladiator II” was given, and a further five years before filming actually began. So there’s a considerable weight of expectation for all involved, particularly Paul Mescal, who is essentially stepping into the sandals of Russell Crowe’s iconic Maximus Decimus Meridius — albeit as a different character. Mescal plays Lucius, grandson of Rome’s former emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and son of Lucilla (Nielsen) — Marcus Aurelius’ oldest child — making Lucius the former heir to the Roman Empire. He is living with his family in North Africa when the Roman army invade and he is captured and forced into slavery. Inspired by the story of Maximus, Lucius resolves to fight as a gladiator and resist tyranny, under the guidance of the power-hungry Macrinus (Denzel Washington).\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nStarring: Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, Jenna Ortega\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nWhen: Sept. 5\n\nThe sequel to Burton’s 1988 cult-classic comedy horror sees Keaton reprise his role as the decidedly non-woke ‘bio-exorcist’ Beetlegeuse, while Ryder and Catherine O’Hara return as Lydia and Delia Deetz, and Ortega plays Lydia’s teenage daughter Astrid. Thirty-six years on from the events of the original, the three generations of Deetz females return to the family home in Winter River, where Astrid accidentally opens the portal to the Afterlife, allowing Beetleguese to return to the world of the living and wreak havoc again.\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux\n\nStarring: Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga, Zazie Beets\n\nDirector: Todd Phillips\n\nWhen: Oct. 3\n\nThe sequel to Phillips’ acclaimed 2019 movie “Joker” once again features Phoenix as the title character, loosely based on the arch-rival of Batman from DC Comics. Set two years on from the events of “Joker,” Arthur Fleck/Joker is now a patient at Gotham’s Arkham Asylum, where he falls in love with his music therapist Harleen ‘Lee’ Quinzel (Lady Gaga). The pair begin to experience shared delusions, and Quinzel transforms into her alter-ego of Harley Quinn. Outside the psychiatric hospital’s walls, Fleck’s followers launch a protest movement to secure his release.\n\nWicked\n\nStarring: Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Michelle Yeoh\n\nDirector: Jon M. Chu\n\nWhen: Nov. 21\n\nThe first of a two-film adaptation of the hugely successful stage musical of the same name, which is based on character’s from “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.” It is set in the Land of Oz, and follows green-skinned Elphaba (Erivo) — a misunderstood young woman who ultimately becomes the Wicked Witch of the West, adversary of Dorothy Gale in the “Oz” novels — and her friendship-turned-rivalry with the popular Galinda Upland, who becomes the mighty Glinda the Good. When the pair encounter the Wizard of Oz, their lives take very different trajectories.\n\nA Complete Unknown\n\nStarring: Timothée Chalamet, Edward Norton, Elle Fanning\n\nDirector: James Mangold\n\nWhen: Dec. 24\n\nChalamet plays arguably the world’s greatest singer-songwriter, Bob Dylan, in this biopic that covers Dylan’s rise to prominence in the New York (then wider US) folk-music scene up to his controversial (for folk-music aficionados) switch from acoustic to electric instrumentation on his fifth album in 1965, and his subsequent live performances over the next couple of years (including his famed appearance at the Newport Folk Festival), where he was booed by many in the audience for what they saw as a betrayal of his roots, but which has since been recognized as one of his most inspiring creative periods and a vital moment in the development of folk rock.\n\nNosferatu\n\nStarring: Bill Skarsgard, Nicholas Hoult, Lily-Rose Depp\n\nDirector: Robert Eggers\n\nWhen: Dec. 24\n\nRemake of the seminal silent German 1922 classic (itself based on Bram Stoker’s “Dracula”), about a young woman, Ellen (Depp) who becomes the obsession of Count Orlok (Skarsgard), a terrifying vampire who will stop at nothing to possess her. It requires some serious self-confidence to remake such an acclaimed piece of pop-culture, but Eggers has considerable pedigree as writer-director of two of the most accomplished and atmospheric horror (or, at least, horror-adjacent) films in recent memory, “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse.”\n\nLOS ANGELES: Alana Hadid, often only recognized as the sister of supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid, is amplifying her own voice for the Palestinian cause.\n\nDeeply passionate about her heritage, Hadid has been using her platform to bring attention to the struggles of the Palestinian people, particularly in the light of the ongoing events in Gaza.\n\nHer activism is not restricted to just the online space; it is a deeply personal commitment to highlighting the stories that matter, she said.\n\n“I was always hearing stories, stories about the cities and the towns that their ancestors helped build. The lives that they had and their lives as refugees and then eventually in the United States.\n\n“But I was very proud, always proud of being a Palestinian. That was what I learned as a child,” Hadid told Arab News.\n\nShifting her focus to filmmaking, Hadid — along with brothers Badie Ali and Hamza Ali — co-founded Watermelon Pictures, a production company with a mission to create compelling, impactful stories that resonate with global audiences.\n\nThrough her work in film, she aims to bridge the gap between mainstream media and the often-overlooked narratives of the Palestinian people.\n\n“I was honored to be asked to be the creative director of Watermelon Pictures. I think it’s not only a passion project for Hamza and Badie, but it is an opportunity for Palestinians to have a place to go to tell their stories.\n\n“I get emotional about it. I think it’s just one of the most beautiful things that people have a place where they can put their stories. And we know that we have a safe place for that,” said Hadid.\n\nThe production company’s debut project, the 2024 documentary “Walled Off,” delves into the realities of life under occupation, offering a poignant and raw look at the experiences of Palestinians.\n\n“The Waldorf Hotel’s design is by the graffiti artist Banksy. It contains a secret museum. And essentially the hotel has a view of what we call the worst view in the world, the apartheid wall.\n\n“So really, this hotel provides the framework for the film and just demonstrates the difficulty of living under military occupation,” said Hadid.\n\nThrough this film and her future projects, Hadid seeks to amplify marginalized voices and bring a human face to the political issues that often dominate headlines.\n\n“Watch our social media and our website to see what’s coming next. But we have a lot of stories. We haven’t heard these stories and these stories have been censored for so long.\n\n“So, we’ve been flooded with not only movies that have already been made that really need to be seen, but also with filmmakers, actors, editors. And we’re really excited to just be a hub for that for Palestinians,” she said."
