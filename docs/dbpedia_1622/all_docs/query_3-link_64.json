        "text": "LOS ANGELES: “Oppenheimer,” a solemn three-hour biopic that became an unlikely billion-dollar box-office sensation, was crowned best picture at a 96th Academy Awards that doubled as a coronation for Christopher Nolan.\n\nAfter passing over arguably Hollywood’s foremost big-screen auteur for years, the Oscars made up for lost time by heaping seven awards on Nolan’s blockbuster biopic, including best actor for Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. and best director for Nolan.\n\nIn anointing “Oppenheimer,” the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences did something it hasn’t done for more than a decade: hand its top prize to a widely seen, big-budget studio film. In a film industry where a cape, dinosaur or Tom Cruise has often been a requirement for such box office, “Oppenheimer” brought droves of moviegoers to theaters with a complex, fission-filled drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb.\n\n“For better or worse, we’re all living in Robert Oppenheimer’s world,” said Murphy in his acceptance speech. “I’d like to dedicate this to the peacemakers.”\n\nAs a film heavy with unease for human capacity for mass destruction, “Oppenheimer” also emerged – even over its partner in cultural phenomenon, “Barbie” – as a fittingly foreboding film for times rife with cataclysm, man-made or not. Sunday’s Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles unfolded against the backdrop of wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and with a potentially momentous US election on the horizon.\n\nThe most closely watched contest of the Academy Awards went to Emma Stone, who won best actress for her performance as Bella Baxter in “Poor Things.”\n\nIn what was seen as the night’s most nail-biting category, Stone won over Lily Gladstone of “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Gladstone would have become the first Native American to win an Academy Award.\n\nInstead, Oscar voters couldn’t resist the full-bodied extremes of Stone’s “Poor Things” performance. The win for Stone, her second best actress Oscar following her 2017 win for “La La Land,” confirmed the 35-year-old as arguably the preeminent big-screen actress of her generation. The list of women to win best actress two or more times is illustrious, including Katharine Hepburn, Frances McDormand, Ingrid Bergman and Bette Davis.\n\n“Oh, boy, this is really overwhelming,” said Stone, who fought back tears and a broken dress during her speech.\n\nSunday’s broadcast had razzle dazzle, including a sprawling song-and-dance rendition of the “Barbie” hit “I’m Just Ken” by Ryan Gosling, with an assist on guitar by Slash and a sea of Kens who swarmed the stage.\n\nBut protest and politics intruded on an election-year Academy Awards, where demonstrations for Gaza raged outside the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Late during the show, Kimmel read a critical social media post from former president Donald Trump.\n\n“Thank you for watching,” said host Jimmy Kimmel. “Isn’t it passed your jail time?”\n\nNolan has had many movies in the Oscar mix before, including “Inception,” “Dunkirk” and “The Dark Knight.” But his win Sunday for direction is the first Academy Award for the 53-year-old filmmaker. Addressing the crowd, Nolan noted cinema is just over a hundred years old.\n\n“We don’t know where this incredible journey is going from here,” said Nolan. “But to think that I’m a meaningful part of it means the world to me.”\n\nDowney, nominated twice before (for “Chaplin” and “Tropic Thunder”), also notched his first Oscar, crowning the illustrious second act of his up-and-down career.\n\n“I’d like to thank my terrible childhood and the academy, in that order,” said Downey, the son of filmmaker Robert Downey Sr.\n\n“Barbie,” last year’s biggest box-office hit with more than $1.4 billion in ticket sales, ultimately won just one award: best song (sorry, Ken) for Billie Eilish and Finneas’ “What Was I Made For?” It’s their second Oscar, two years after winning for their James Bond theme, “No Time to Die.”\n\nBut after an awards season that stayed largely inside a Hollywood bubble, geopolitics played a prominent role. Protests over Israel’s war in Gaza snarled traffic around the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, slowing stars’ arrival on the red carpet and turning the Oscar spotlight toward the ongoing conflict. Some protesters shouted “Shame!” at those trying to reach the awards.\n\nJonathan Glazer, the British filmmaker whose chilling Auschwitz drama “The Zone of Interest” won best international film, drew connections between the dehumanization depicted in his film and today.\n\n“Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people, whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel, or the the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims, this dehumanization, how do we resist?”\n\nThe war in Gaza was on the minds of many attendees, as was the war in Ukraine. A year after “Navalny” won the same award, Mstyslav Chernov’s “20 Days in Mariupol,” a harrowing chronicle of the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, won best documentary. The win, a first for The Associated Press and PBS’ “Frontline,” came as the war in Ukraine passed the two-year mark with no signs of abating.\n\nMstyslav Chernov, the Ukrainian filmmaker and AP journalist whose hometown was bombed the day he learned of his Oscar nomination, spoke forcefully about Russia’s invasion.\n\n“This is the first Oscar in Ukrainian history,” said Chernov. “And I’m honored. Probably I will be the first director on this stage to say I wish I’d never made this film. I wish to be able to exchange this (for) Russia never attacking Ukraine.”\n\nIn the early going, Yorgos Lanthimos’ Frankenstein-riff “Poor Things” ran away with three prizes for its sumptuous craft, including awards for production design, makeup and hairstyling and costume design.\n\nKimmel, hosting the ABC telecast for the fourth time, opened the awards with an monologue that emphasized Hollywood as “a union town” following 2023’s actor and writer strikes, drew a standing ovation for bringing out teamsters and behind-the-scenes workers — who are now entering their own labor negotiations.\n\nThe night’s first award was one of its most predictable: Da’Vine Joy Randolph for best supporting actress, for her performance in Alexander Payne’s “The Holdovers.” An emotional Randolph was accompanied to the stage by her “Holdovers” co-star Paul Giamatti.\n\n“For so long I’ve always wanted to be different,” said Randolph. “And now I realize I just need to be myself.”\n\nThough Randolph’s win was widely expected, an upset quickly followed. Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron” won for best animated feature, a surprise over the slightly favored “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” Miyazaki, the 83-year-old Japanese anime master who came out of retirement to make “The Boy and the Heron,” didn’t attend the ceremony. He also didn’t attend the 2003 Oscars when his “Spirited Away” won the same award.\n\nBest original screenplay went to “Anatomy of a Fall,” which, like “Barbie,” was penned by a couple: director Justine Triet and Arthur Harari. “This will help me through my midlife crisis, I think,” said Triet.\n\nIn adapted screenplay, where “Barbie” was nominated — and where some suspected Greta Gerwig would win after being overlooked for director — the Oscar went to Cord Jefferson, who wrote and directed his feature film debut “American Fiction.” He pleaded for executives to take risks on young filmmakers like himself.\n\n“Instead of making a $200 million movie, try making 20 $10 million movies,” said Jefferson, previously an award-winning TV writer.\n\nThe Oscars belonged largely to theatrical-first films. Though it came into the awards with 19 nominations, Netflix was a bit player. Its lone win came for live action short: Wes Anderson’s “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,” based on the story by Roald Dahl.\n\nHistorically, having big movies in the mix for the Oscars’ top awards has been good for broadcast ratings. The Academy Awards’ largest audience ever came when James Cameron’s “Titanic” swept the 1998 Oscars.\n\nWinners in key categories for the 96th Academy Awards\n\nHOLLYWOOD: Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer\" was the big winner of the night with seven awards, while \"Poor Things\" — a female take on the Frankenstein story — won four.\n\nBest picture: \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest director: Christopher Nolan, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest actor: Cillian Murphy, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest actress: Emma Stone, \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest supporting actor: Robert Downey Jr, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest supporting actress: Da'Vine Joy Randolph, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nBest original screenplay: Justine Triet and Arthur Harari, \"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\nBest adapted screenplay: Cord Jefferson, \"American Fiction\"\n\nBest international feature film: \"The Zone of Interest\" (United Kingdom)\n\nBest animated feature: \"The Boy and the Heron\"\n\nBest documentary feature: \"20 Days in Mariupol\"\n\nBest original score: Ludwig Goransson, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest original song: Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell, \"What Was I Made For?\" from the \"Barbie\" soundtrack\n\nBest cinematography: Hoyte van Hoytema, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest film editing: Jennifer Lame, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest makeup and hairstyling: \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest costume design: \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest production design: \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest sound: \"The Zone of Interest\"\n\nBest visual effects: \"Godzilla Minus One\"\n\n(AFP)\n\nDUBAI: Fans gave a warm welcome to Dubai-based Hollywood star Lindsay Lohan at Disney’s D23 fan convention at The Honda Center in Anaheim, California.\n\nOn Saturday, Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, the stars of the upcoming “Freaky Friday” follow-up, revealed to fans for the first time the sequel’s official title, “Freakier Friday,” expected in cinemas in 2025.\n\nLohan, who wore a black and white Balmain ensemble to the event, took to Instagram to share her excitement. “What a wonderful time I had at @disneyd23 Thank you for the overwhelming response of love and excitement for FREAKIER FRIDAY,” was how she captioned her carousel images from the event.\n\nDirected by Nisha Ganatra and produced by Kristin Burr, Andrew Gunn and Curtis, “Freakier Friday” picks up years after Curtis and Lohan’s characters, Tess and Anna, first endured an identity crisis: Anna has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate challenges that come when two families merge, they discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lohan also revealed that “Star Wars: Acolyte” star Manny Jacinto will play Lohan’s character’s husband in the film.\n\n“Manny is lovely. So funny,” Lohan said of her onscreen love interest.\n\nIt was also announced that original cast member Chad Michael Murray will be returning to play Jake in the sequel, fuelling fans’ excitement that they will get to see Lohan and Murray’s characters together 20 years after the original film.\n\nWhile it appears that they won’t be in a romantic relationship, Curtis teased, “Chad is in it. And boy, oh boy, is Chad in it.”\n\n“Freakier Friday” also stars Mark Harmon, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky and Rosalind Chao. New cast members include Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan. Executive producers are Nathan Kelly, Ann Marie Sanderlin and Lohan.\n\nAside from Jacinto as Lohan’s onscreen husband, no further details have been released about the roles played by Butters, Hammons and Ramakrishnan — although it is likely at least one of them will be playing Lohan’s daughter and another one may take the part of her almost-stepdaughter.\n\nIf you’ve caught glimpses of actress Blake Lively smiling brightly as she wears dreamy, floral-inspired garments for the press tour of her latest film, “It Ends With Us,” you might be fooled into assuming that her character — a florist aptly named Lily Blossom Bloom — has a tranquil life that is just a walk in the park.\n\nLily certainly wakes up and smells the roses — even if they are found to be prickly, with bloody thorns.\n\nTrigger warning: the narrative explores themes related to domestic violence and childhood trauma. The author of the 2016 novel on which the film is based, Colleen Hoover, has said the story was inspired by her parents’ relationship.\n\nThe story is ripped straight from a heartbreaking headline that many women know all too well: You think that your life is finally going perfectly and you’ve found the right partner, only to find that nothing is what it seems. The hand that once held you tenderly is the one that hits you. The face that you once found comfort in becomes the one that is most terrifying to you.\n\nLike a fresh flower, your dreams can sometimes shrivel up and die.\n\nLily — named after a flower traditionally used at funerals —is perhaps Lively’s most emotionally raw character and one which fully shows her range as an actress. Over the course of the film she is funny, joyous, endearing, sad, confused, vulnerable, strong, scared and empowered.\n\nThe film is directed by Justin Baldoni (“Jane the Virgin”) who also stars as Lily’s husband, Dr. Ryle Kincaid. It also showcases the acting chops of comedians Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj, who play a happily married couple who help Lily along on her journey; as well as Brandon Sklenar, as Atlas — Lily’s first love who reappears in her life when she least expects it.\n\nIn what is perhaps the most emotional scene in the entire movie, you can hear the gothic, choir-inflected, layered vocals of Lively’s real-life friend Taylor Swift as she sings the 2020 sleeper hit, “My Tears Ricochet.” The haunting song made the unraveling scene seem much more dire.\n\nWhile the story’s climax does feel like it was hastily wrapped up in a neat bow, it’s also the ending most of us would hope for if we were in that situation.\n\n“It Ends With Us” is both love story and cautionary tale. It speaks of resistance, perseverance, and friendship.\n\nThe film starts and ends with Lily driving a car on an open road. But she is not the same, and, after watching the rollercoaster of a narrative unfold, neither is the viewer."
