        "text": "Elliot Aronson American psychologist\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nElliot Aronson (born January 9, 1932) is an American psychologist who has carried out experiments on the theory of cognitive dissonance, and invented the Jigsaw Classroom, a cooperative teaching technique which facilitates learning while reducing interethnic hostility and prejudice. In his 1972 social psychology textbook, The Social Animal, he stated Aronson's First Law: \"People who do crazy things are not necessarily crazy,\" thus asserting the importance of situational factors in bizarre behavior. He is the only person in the 120-year history of the American Psychological Association to have won all three of its major awards: for writing, for teaching, and for research. In 2007 he received the William James Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Association for Psychological Science, in which he was cited as the scientist who \"fundamentally changed the way we look at everyday life.” A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Aronson as the 78th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. He officially retired in 1994 but continues to teach and write.\n\n21st-century psychologists · 61T\n\n20th-century psychologists · 972T\n\nPeople from Revere, Massachusetts · 43T\n\nStanisław Aronson Polish Jew/Israeli citizen/former officer:Polish Home Army (AK) as Lieutenant\n\n0 0\n\nrank #7 ·\n\nStanisław Aronson (nom de guerre \"Rysiek\") (born 1925 in Warsaw) is a Polish Jew and an Israeli citizen, as well as a former officer of the Polish Home Army (AK) with a rank of Lieutenant.
