        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus returns for Season 2 of her award-winning podcast, Wiser Than Meâ¢. Each week, she has funny, touching, personal conversations with iconic older women who are brimming with the kind of unapologetic attitude and wisdom that only comes with age. Julia sits at the feet of some extraordinary teachers this season (discover who in the trailer), and of course her 90-year-old mom, Judy. Tune in to laugh, cry and get wise. All Hail Old Women!Â Photo: Ryan Pfluger and August Image\n\n4.8 (8388)\n\nCOMEDY\n\nDive into the heart of America's childcare crisis with No One Is Coming to Save Us, hosted by veteran reporter Gloria Riviera. In Season 4, weâre peeling back the layers of our nationâs most pressing challenges - intergenerational poverty, homelessness, and climate change - to uncover their deep, often surprising connections with childcare. Each Thursday, join us as we unravel these complex issues, revealing how they intersect and impact the future of our children.Â No One Is Coming To Save Us is produced with Neighborhood Villages, a systems change nonprofit that envisions a transformed, equitable early childhood education system that lifts up educators and sets every child and family up to thrive.\n\n4.4 (965)\n\nKIDS & FAMILY\n\nTo be human is to fail â period. And not just to fail once, but to fail a lot. As the author Samuel Beckett said: âFail again. Fail better.â This saying means a lot to me and my family â so much so that my daughter got a tattoo of it. Why are we, and so many others, so deeply concerned by failure? And if itâs something we all do so often, why are we so afraid of it â especially those of us here in win-at-all-costs America? In this podcast, I sit down with successful, thoughtful people like Ben Stiller, Bette Midler, Sean Penn and more to talk about failure â or what they labeled âfailure,â but what was really an unparalleled opportunity for growth and revelation. I even want to delve into my own hardest moments, when I wrestled with setbacks, shame, and fear. Weâll still fail again. And again. But maybe if we fail better, weâll feel better -- and maybe if we can all laugh together in failure, that's a start.\n\n4.5 (311)\n\nSOCIETY & CULTURE\n\nAre you living your best life now? Not always? This is a podcast for you. Duke Professor Kate Bowler is an expert in the stories we tell about success and failure, suffering and happiness. She had Stage IV cancer. Then she didnât. And since then, all she wants to do is talk to funny and wise people about how to live with the knowledge that, well, everything happens.Â Find her online at @katecbowler.

Through shocking discoveries - and Stanley Tucciâs artistry - an enthralling personal history comes to life. When documentarian David Modigliani was a kid, his grandfather, Franco, won the Nobel Prize. But, Davidâs always been more fascinated by the love story that made it possible -- his grandparents' romance on the run from Fascist Italy. When he digs into their story, he uncovers a darker side to their fairytale escape: a brother left behind to face the Nazi occupation - and startling personal connections between his family and Benito Mussolini. In the Tribeca-winning podcast, PACK ONE BAG, he returns to Italy to investigate his family's past, carrying a pressing question: if Fascism takes over your country, do you stay, or do you try to flee? And what happens if you canât? From Live Action Projects, Gilded Audio, and Lemonada Media. Sales and Distribution by Lemonada Media https://lemonadamedia.com/\n\n4.9 (348)\n\nHISTORY"
