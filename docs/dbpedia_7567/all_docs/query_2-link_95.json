        "text": "Sarah Silverman is the latest stand-up comedian headed to Netflix.\n\nThe streaming giant announced Monday that it will debut a new special from Silverman in late spring. The untitled special will film later this month for a May 30 premiere.\n\nLiam Lynch will direct the special, with JASH signing on to produce with Thruline’s Amy Zvi. (Silverman founded JASH, a comedy-driven media company, alongside fellow comedians Michael Cera, Tim Heidecker & Eric Wareheim and Reggie Watts.)\n\nThe comic, best known for her Comedy Central series, won an Emmy in 2014 for her HBO special Sarah Silverman: We Are Miracles. Her other acting roles include such series as Masters of Sex and The Good Wife. Silverman’s film roles include Wreck It Ralph and A Million Ways to Die in the West, as well as the upcoming releases The Book of Henry and Battle of the Sexes.\n\nShe also is the author of the 2010 best-selling memoir The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee."
