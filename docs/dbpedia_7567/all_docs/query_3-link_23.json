        "text": "Comedian\n\nPlace Of Birth:\n\nBedford, New Hampshire\n\nBest Known As:\n\nOver-the-edge star of TV's The Sarah Silverman Program\n\nComedian Sarah Silverman found success in the early 2000s as a good-looking, foul-mouthed Jewish girl who makes jokes about taboo subjects. Silverman grew up in New Hampshire and started her comedy career in New York at the end of the 1980s. After brief stint with Saturday Night Live (1993-94), she moved to Los Angeles, where she worked in comedy clubs and got bit parts in TV shows and feature films. She released a concert film in 2005 (Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic) and by the beginning of 2007 she was starring in The Sarah Silverman Program on Comedy Central. The show highlighted Silverman's comic persona: a self-interested nitwit prone to saying wildly inappropriate things in socially awkward situations. Since then she has made dozens of guest appearances on television, voiced many animated features and shorts and had critical success with TV specials, including the Emmy-winning We Are Miracles (2013). Silverman's credits include stints on Crank Yankers (created by her then-boyfriend, TV host Jimmy Kimmel), a memorable part as the roommate's uptight girlfriend in the Jack Black movie School of Rock (2003) and the animated features Wreck-It Ralph (2012), Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018) and The Bob's Burgers Movie (2022).\n\n4 Good Links\n\nThe YouTube channel with her podcast\n\nNew Yorker profile from 2005\n\nHer profile from the Jewish Women's Archive\n\n2022 story on one of her autobiographical projects\n\nSee also:"
