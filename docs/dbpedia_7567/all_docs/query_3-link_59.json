        "text": "Bio:\n\nSarah Silverman (born Sarah Kate Silverman on December 1, 1970 in Bedford, New Hampshire) is an American comedian, actress and voice actress. As a teenager, Sarah suffered with depression and isolation. She found solace in comedy. While attending summer school in Boston, Sarah tried stand-up at an Open Mic night. Bitten by the performance bug, Sarah enrolled in New York University but dropped out to focus on her comedy full time. Sarah was a fixture on the stand-up circuit until her big break in 1993, landing a gig as a writer and performer for Saturday Night Live. Though she only appeared in a few skits, and was subsequently fired, she turned this disappointment into a success with positive appearances on Mr. Show, The Larry Sanders Show and in movies like There’s Something About Mary. Sarah made her network stand-up debut with Late Show with David Letterman in 2007. That year, The Sarah Silverman Program debuted on Comedy Central and she hosted the MTV Movie Awards. During a January 2008 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Sarah presented then-boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel a music video entitled “I’m F****ing Matt Damon.” It became a viral hit and won her an Emmy Award for Outstanding Music and Lyrics. Sarah continued to perform stand-up and appear in a variety of roles, most notably lending her voice to the 2012 Disney animated film, Wreck-It Ralph.\n\nBest Known For:\n\nSarah Silverman is best known as a stand-up comedian, as well as voicing the character Vanellope in 2012’s Wreck-It Ralph."
