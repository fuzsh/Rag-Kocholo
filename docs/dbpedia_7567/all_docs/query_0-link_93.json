No topic is off limits, from politics to the rampant overuse of cologne. Your voicemails dictate the trajectory of the show, but Sarahâ€™s always driving. Yes, things will get weird. But weird is her sweet spot. New episodes of The Sarah Silverman Podcast from Lemonada Media premiere every Thursday. \n\nYou can leave a voice memo for Sarah at speakpipe.com/TheSarahSilvermanPodcast.\n\nSales and Distribution by Lemonada Media https://lemonadamedia.com/",
