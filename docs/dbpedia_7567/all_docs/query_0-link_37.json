        "text": "Sarah Silverman is an American actress, stand-up comedian, singer, writer, and producer. Known for her sassy remarks and tongue-in-cheek humor, she rose to prominence due to her satirical comedy. She is also known for voicing her opinion on social taboos and controversial topics, including racism, sexism, and religion. Interestingly, she developed a passion for comedy at a very young age. She started performing in her teens at local clubs and community theatres. Eventually, she dropped out of ‘New York University’ to pursue a full-time career in comedy. Though she received a major break after she was roped in as a writer and performer at ‘Saturday Night Live,’ she could not make most of the opportunity as she was ousted after the first season. The disappointing start did dishearten this young and talented comedienne but she made a comeback with HBO’s sketch comedy ‘Mr. Show,’ featuring Bob Odenkirk and David Cross. Since then, she has been cast in several television shows. She has also been featured in films where she has played comic and serious roles. She hogged the limelight with her controversial statements and performance in a show titled ‘Jesus is Magic.’ In 2005, a film version of the same was released. Two years later, she was seen in the flagship program ‘The Sarah Silverman Show’ which ran until 2010 on ‘Comedy Central.’ The show became one of the most popular series for its politically incorrect humor."
