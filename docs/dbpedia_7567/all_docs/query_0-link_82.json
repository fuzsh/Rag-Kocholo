        "text": "Sarah Silverman is no stranger to controversy. Throughout her three-decade career, the Jewish American comedian has never been afraid to break boundaries and speak her mind—for better or worse.\n\nIn October, the 53-year-old star was blasted for her comments about the Israel-Hamas war, with social media users accusing Silverman of being a \"genocidal maniac.\" Now, the Saturday Night Live! star has spoken out for the first time on the backlash she received.\n\nOn October 7, Hamas launched a shock attack on southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking a further 240 hostage. Israel subsequently fired airstrikes on Gaza, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspending supplies of food, medicine, energy and fuel into the territory.\n\nA ground offensive was launched into Gaza. Since the fighting began, at least 15,000 Gazans have been killed, Reuters reported, while 1.7 million people have been left homeless.\n\nAfter news broke of the initial Hamas attack, Silverman took to social media to share her dismay. She posted clips of music festival-goers who were taken captive and quotes about antisemitism, and despite previously describing herself as a \"Jewish agnostic,\" said the event had encouraged her to start praying.\n\nOn October 18, after Netanyahu cut off supplies to Gaza, Silverman reposted a statement to Instagram that caused uproar.\n\n\"Many are saying that it's inhumane that Israel is cutting off water/electricity to Gaza,\" the statement—originally shared by user @elianaeatz—reads.\n\n\"Israel made it pretty simple—'release the hostages and we will turn it back on.' Instead of pleading with Hamas to release civilian hostages which include babies and toddlers there are politicians (cough cough AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]) calling Israel inhumane.\n\n\"If that isn't enough for you: Israel does not need to supply Gaza with these resources (which they do, for free). If Hamas didn't spend billions of dollars on terrorism they would be able to build the infrastructure to support themselves.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Sarah Silverman for comment via email.\n\nSilverman deleted the post soon afterward, but it had already begun trending on X—the social network formerly known as Twitter—where users accused the Emmy winner of being pro-genocide.\n\nIn a new interview with the Los Angeles Times, Silverman said she regrets sharing the statement and has been reassessing her public persona.\n\n\"I know that I speak out about stuff, and that's a role that I've taken on,\" she told the publication. \"But there's a balance between that and centering yourself, or thinking that what you have to say is incredibly important.\"\n\nSilverman also confessed to being stoned with she posted the statement, but that she usually \"makes very measured decisions\"—even while high.\n\n\"I f***** up,\" she said. \"I try not to define people by their worst moments. But it's gonna pass, or it won't. I can't control it.\"\n\nDespite the outrage her comments caused, Silverman is used to weathering public outrage and media storms.\n\nIn 2022, a comedy sketch of the Wreck it Ralph star wearing Blackface resurfaced after she got into a social media spat with rapper Kanye West over his antisemitic remarks.\n\nOriginating from 2007, the sketch was featured in an episode of The Sarah Silverman Program called \"Face Wars.\" In the show, Silverman wore dark make-up to figure out if it's harder to be Black or Jewish in the U.S., a move she has since called \"aggressively stupid.\"\n\nIn 2001, she came under fire after using an ethnic slur for Chinese people during an appearance on Conan, with the backlash worsening after she got into a debate with Asian American civil rights activist Guy Aoki on Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect.\n\nIn her interview with the Los Angeles Times, Silverman said that she doesn't \"think of myself as a political comedian.\"\n\n\"Maybe holistically I am. I don't know,\" she added. \"Are we not all at a crossroads in this moment?\""
