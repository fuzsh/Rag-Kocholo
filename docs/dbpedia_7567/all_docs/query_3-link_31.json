        "text": "Sarah Silverman is a two-time Emmy Award-winning comedian, actress, writer, and producer. Her new special Sarah Silverman: Someone You Love is now streaming on Max and the album is available on vinyl and all streaming platforms. She also continues to host her critically acclaimed, weekly podcast, The Sarah Silverman Podcast, which relaunched on October 19 through Lemonada on all platforms and TBS’ Stupid Pet Tricks, an expansion of the famous David Letterman late night segment. The show airs Mondays at 9/8c. Sarah also appeared in Netflix’s Emmy-nominated Maestro, a biopic on the life of composer Leonard Bernstein, where she portrayed Bernstein’s sister Shirley. She also executive produced the short film Jack and Sam, which follows two Holocaust survivors who were miraculously reunited after 80 years, and are now spending the precious time they have left rekindling their friendship and educating others about the dangers of hatred. In Spring 2022, Silverman’s off-Broadway musical adaptation of her 2010 New York Times Bestselling memoir \"The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee\" had a sold-out run with the Atlantic Theatre Company. Silverman previously hosted the Emmy and Writers Guild-nominated Hulu series I Love You, America. She continues to lend her voice to several animated series, including Bob’s Burgers.\n\nSilverman has made memorable guest appearances on several acclaimed and notable television shows, including Monk, which earned her a 2008 Primetime Emmy Awards nomination for “Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.” Her additional television work includes buzzed-about roles on HBO’s Crashing, Masters of Sex, The Good Wife, The Larry Sanders Show, Seinfeld, and Mr. Show with Bob and David. Silverman has hosted several major awards shows, including the 2007 MTV Movie Awards and the Independent Spirit Awards.\n\nSilverman grew up in New Hampshire and attended New York University for one year. In 1993 she joined Saturday Night Live as a writer and feature performer and has not stopped working since.\n\nYONDR:\n\nThis event will be a phone-free experience.
