        "text": "Sarah Silverman has been pushing buttons her entire life. From the age of three, she was already making adults uncomfortable with swear words she learned from her father. Flash forward to today and she's still making adults feel uncomfortable with comedic barbs. As a woman in comedy, Silverman has spent her career acting as crudely as television will allow in an effort to challenge the notions that female comedians can't be crude, or aren't funny, or shouldn't act a certain way.\n\nDespite her lighthearted humor and refusal to take anything too seriously, there's a lot that Silverman cares about. Quotes, stories, and anecdotes from past interviews prove that there's a lot more to Silverman than a sailor's mouth. If so, then who is Sarah Silverman? Her bio would show a formerly failed comedian who worked her way back onto screens with her own TV show, comedy specials, and movies. But Silverman's history and tidbits of trivia also display her as a stark feminist, proud Jew, talented comedian, political and human rights activist, and much more.\n\nPeople often dismiss Silverman for her crass language and tendency to make people feel uncomfortable. But the reasons why Silverman's comedy makes people feel uncomfortable often say a lot about our societal stigmas and our unconscious and institutionalized prejudices. Whether you're a fan of her or not, her life's work has always been about pushing societal norms. Dismissing her as gross or rude fails to recognize the real joke. So in order to get a better perspective on what makes Silverman so funny, here are 19 interesting facts you may not know about the comedian."
