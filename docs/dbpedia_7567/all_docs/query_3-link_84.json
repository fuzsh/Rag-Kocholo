        "text": "Sarah Silverman is a two-time Emmy Award-winning comedian, actress, writer, and producer. Her new special Sarah Silverman: Someone You Love is now streaming on Max. The digital version of the comedy album is available now on major music streaming platforms and the vinyl will be available on December 15th, 2023. She also continues to host her critically acclaimed, weekly podcast, The Sarah Silverman Podcast, which relaunched on October 19 through Lemonada on all platforms. Sarah can next be seen in Netflix’s Maestro, a biopic on the life of composer Leonard Bernstein. She will star opposite Bradley Cooper as Bernstein’s sister Shirley. The film debuted at the Venice Film Festival this past September ahead of its theatrical premiere on November 22 and Netflix release on December 20. Other upcoming projects include TBS’ Stupid Pet Tricks, an expansion of the famous David Letterman late night segment. In Spring 2022, Silverman’s off-Broadway musical adaptation of her 2010 New York Times Bestselling memoir \"The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee\" had a sold-out run with the Atlantic Theatre Company. Silverman previously hosted the Emmy and Writers Guild-nominated Hulu series I Love You, America. She continues to lend her voice to several animated series, including Bob’s Burgers."
