        "text": "Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like Sarah Silverman in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming. They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking Sarah Silverman or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.\n\nSarah Silverman's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Sarah Silverman for your party. As long as your funding is commensurate with the price range to book Sarah Silverman, CTI will propose your event to the official agency representing Sarah Silverman. After we consult with them, we will provide a personal and accurate quote that includes: final costs, availability, and actual interest in being hired for your specific event or party.\n\nCTI can give you the accurate Sarah Silverman booking price once we submit your event details to their camp. \"How much does it cost to book Sarah Silverman for an event?\" is a frequent question we get. The final Sarah Silverman booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Sarah Silverman charge for an event. An example fee to book Sarah Silverman is in the starting range of $150,000-$299,000. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement."
