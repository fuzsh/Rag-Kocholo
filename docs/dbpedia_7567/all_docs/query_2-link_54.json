From her ace-telling (we crowned her the champ) of the Aristocrats joke to a killer takedown of Hugh Hefner, her comedy is laser-light on. But she’s also not afraid to apologize if she feels it’s appropriate, sometimes 14-years after the fact.\n\nSince she has a musical opening in late April, we thought now would be a good time to splash you with some cool facts about Sarah Silverman, who once pleaded with the Pope to sell the Vatican.\n\n15 Sarah Silverman Stood Up To Michael Richards On The Set Of Seinfeld\n\nOn her podcast, Sarah recalled the ‘bad experience’ she had working with Michael Richards during her guest-appearance on Seinfeld. She flubbed a line and Richards went off on her, in character. She recalls “getting a lump in her throat” during the incident and later thinking, “f*ck this guy.”\n\nThe next day, Richards pretended like nothing had happened, but Sarah Silverman was having none of it. She called him out on his terrible behavior, and he accepted the criticism.\n\nThis story turned out a whole lot better than another involving Richards' terrible behavior.\n\n14 Sarah Silverman Became A Vegetarian After Witnessing Total Horror At A Turkey Farm\n\nIn the November 2009 issue of Marie Claire, the comedian/actor told the story:\n\n“When I was 9 or 10 years old, my dad took me over to a neighboring farm to help get stuff for the meal. The farmer, Vic, told me to look at all the turkeys and pick one out. I saw a cute one with a silly walk and cried, ‘Him!’ Before my pointing finger had even dropped to my side, Vic had grabbed the turkey by the neck and slit throat. Blood and feathers went flying. I had sentenced that turkey to death! Up until then, I didn’t know where meat came from—and I’ve been a vegetarian ever since.”\n\nYeah, that would do it.\n\n13 Sarah Silverman Once Wrote An Article For… Penthouse?\n\nWhen it starts.. “It was an opportunity I could not pass up. And just when I thought things couldn’t get any better, I found out that this, my very first piece, would appear in time for Thanksgiving,” you know it's going to be vintage Sarah Silverman.\n\nAnd she doesn't disappoint, covering everything from b-hole waxing to a more serious yet hilarious observation that “P.P.’s make me see my own beauty. For instance, I have a long neck. It’s sexy to have a long neck, and I have one. My neck is four inches long — and that’s when it’s flaccid.”\n\n12 Sarah Silverman Was The First Female Guest On Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee\n\nSarah was Jerry's first guest of Season Two. They tooled around L.A. in a 1969 E-Type Series Two before stopping off at a place called Millies for some food and of course, coffee.\n\nAnd no one spilled any.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11 Sarah Silverman Has Been Punched In The Face Three Times\n\nAccording to this article, the first time was in New York City when she was handing out flyers for a comedy club when some teens started harassing a fellow flyer distributor.

A fan punched her in the face after she said, “Hi.” After she composed herself, Sarah watched security drag him away and has the remorseful look the man had on his face burned in her brain.\n\n\"She found the whole thing, “heartbreaking.”\n\n10 Sarah Silverman Was Fired From Saturday Night Live Via Fax\n\nSarah claims to have not written “one funny sketch” during her time on the show. She doesn't talk about her SNL experience much in interviews because she finds it ‘boring’. She once told Terry Gross that she wasn't ready for the show yet.\n\nShe was, in fact, fired via fax but later used her SNL experience during an episode of The Larry Sanders Show called, “The New Writer.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9 Sarah Silverman's Mom Was George McGovern’s Campaign Photographer\n\nSarah Silverman's mother was George McGovern's photographer during the 1972 Presidential campaign.
