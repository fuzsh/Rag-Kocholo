        "text": "April 16, 2014\n\nSarah Silverman for Congress in 2016, New Hampshire, 1st Congressional District.\n\nAnd what's not to like? Forty-three now, she's smart, well-educated, articulate, outspoken--and of course funny. She grew up in Manchester, NH. She is very likely a Democrat. Interesting fact: Silverman's mother, Beth Ann, was Sen. George McGovernâs personal campaign photographer during his 1972 presidential bid.\n\nPosted by Holden Oliver (KitzbÃ¼hel Desk) at 11:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nOctober 23, 2011\n\nSarah Silverman for Congress: Mixed Marriages.\n\nPosted by Holden Oliver (KitzbÃ¼hel Desk) at 11:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nJune 02, 2011\n\nSarah Kate Silverman for Congress in 2012 (NH CD1): \"Unforgivable\" if she doesn't run.\n\nPosted by Holden Oliver (KitzbÃ¼hel Desk) at 12:00 AM | Comments (0)\n\nApril 30, 2010\n\nSarah Kate Silverman for Congress, or Queen, or Something.\n\nRight now, America needs shock troops. Yanks don't think much on their own anymore. So Sarah's our girl.\n\nThe Future is Not for Weenies. Sarah Kate Silverman doesn't have President Obama's no-spine/sand/stones problem; she would man up to Congress. Sarah would just say it. It's not just Obama. Even our best politicians can't say what they feel and think. No-Stones is an epidemic. You can't say anything interesting at work. Even Alpha males are on the outs--we are breeding them out. Our younger workers were brought up on gender neutral role models.\n\nWhat's up? Are we turning into Canadians and the Junior League?\n\nKeep reading. We'll get to Sarah.\n\nWe hope for a different kind of culture revolution. We seek to include different ideas and expressions: old, new, objectionable, dumb-downed, bland, trite, creative, stupid, smart. But let's not leave anyone out. This is America, Jack.\n\nFor example, after the Revolution, when politically-correct culture, and other goofy forced-conformity social agendas wane and disappear, you will be able to say what you want.\n\nOkay, anything that puts kids at risk--and about Mothers--will not be fair play. But you will be able to use words like \"secretary\", \"stewardess\"--and even \"stew\", if you've had a few drinks on the plane.\n\nYou will have choices.\n\nSarah Silverman is saucy and attractive. If you don't think that's very important, you're wrong--but you can write us an angry letter, not invite us to parties, or tip off Nina Totenberg and NPR.\n\nIf you're a lawyer, you will start using the term \"Chinese wall\" again. You will be able to swear, and loudly, in the workplace, and start war stories with: \"You know, I had this case in the Southern District, back in 1987, when men were men.\"\n\nAfter the Revolution, you will be able to flirt, and be playful and even a tad eccentric, at work.\n\nIf someone you work with is lazy and disorganized, you will be able to say things like, whoa, that dude Josh \"is lazy and disorganized\" rather than have to say it's so awesome that Josh is \"low profile/independent/a team member requiring minimal face time/empowered by his flexible hour arrangement/a pioneer in work-life balance\".\n\nThe expression \"Not Work-Oriented\" will be okay, too.\n\nUsing \"not work-oriented\" rather than \"lazy\" is also a proven attention-getter. Granted, it's too indirect. It's soft. Sounds a bit PC. But think of it as a transitional term you can employ until people start saying what they mean.\n\nFor example, we have used \"not work-oriented\" frequently in recent years in telephone conversations with people, unknown to us, who check references, of former employees, who we know too well. Saying that your ex-employee Kendall, who had top grades at Dartmouth and Duke Law, and had interviewed well, is \"not work-oriented\" is easier, faster and frankly more fun than struggling through on the phone with:\n\nMr. Bloor, it just wasn't a 'fit'. Kendall has many gifts. But we always knew she would flourish more in an alternative work setting where, you know, team members were, uh, not required to do any work per se, or actually perform, or add value. You know what I mean.\n\nAfter the Revolution, you will also be able to use your real name when you give your opinion in the ether of the Internet.\n\nIn fact, anonymity will be banned--and reserved for rape victims, Iranian and Cuban dissidents, Ned Beatty \"Deliverance\" casualties, and the ballot box at primary and general elections. You will be able to utter all manner of potentially rude, offensive, defamatory and even straight-up tacky things--but you will take responsibility by backing it all up with your real name.\n\nMales will be different. My own offices over the last 5 years has been full of \"sweet\" and \"dainty\" males who, frankly, I am a bit nervous about being with at night. They are not gay, even though at first I thought a lot of them were. (It's natural to wonder--so no letters, please.) They are not show-tunes flashy or YMCA-esque or anything. It's just that they are way too \"nice\".\n\nWay way too nice. Someone did a terrible thing in raising them. They are confused. The don't get what is okay/not okay about being a human being. They don't even swear well. The are not warriors. They are stone-creepy \"men\".\n\nAfter the Revolution, we'll get some of the more boorish and traditional--but at least authentic--males back. That would be \"nice\", too.\n\nMore great news: In the New Order of Things, long after PC culture has dissipated and died, the Seas will not turn Red. No One will go to Hell. The Family Unit will not Implode. The Clintons won't Abduct Your Kids.\n\nSo....you get the idea. We don't like \"PC culture\" that much--sane First Amendment people of any political persuasion never do unless to make fun of it--and so we do cherish Sarah Silverman.\n\nRight now, America needs shock troops. Yanks don't think much on their own anymore. We are too bland and nice. Too consensus-driven. So Sarah's our girl.\n\nBesides, Sarah is saucy and attractive. If you don't think that's important, you're wrong--but you can dash off an angry letter, not invite us to parties, or report us to Nina Totenberg and NPR.\n\nSilverman's also a fine comic, writer, actress, musician, and rebel's rebel who never met a taboo she did not like.\n\nWhile at first blush Silverman's humor may seemed based on stereotypes, she's smart and ironic, not mean, and an unrelenting satirist of life and priorities in America.\n\nMeet Lenny Bruce's adorable grandchild who has escaped from Scarsdale, New Canaan or Shaker Heights and now has a bunch of uncomfortable questions for us all. She's going to ask them, e.g., \"Sell the Vatican, Feed the World\".\n\nLet's see, what else?\n\nHer sister is a Rabbi. But Jesus is Magic? She's ethnically Jewish--but for years allegedly wore a St. Christopher medal from her boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel (\"It was cute the way he gave it to me. He said if it doesn't burn a hole through my skin, it will protect me...\").\n\nShe claims ancestry from Hungary, Poland, France and Slovakia. She does not drink. For you snobs, she graduated from a prep school in New Hampshire. She attended NYU. She turns 40 this year.\n\nHow about this: Can we run her for Congress in, say, California, New York, or New Hampshire, this year or 2012?\n\nThat might help move things along. That would be \"nice\".\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 12:59 AM | Comments (0)\n\nApril 18, 2010\n\nSarah Silverman's 100% sane reaction to Pope's Malta promise.\n\nSilverman: Something more comprehensive, maybe? Good news: Benedict said something in Malta (MSNBC piece). Bad news: Way too late and no one believes him even a little. This is not our kind of Pope yet. Too bad. As religions go, his started out as one of many good ones. They are only as holy as their leaders.\n\nDo all organized religions via their leadership break bad? And go jack-ass on us? One interim option: Read Cicero instead, and do the Antler-Dance.

If you don't think that's very important, you're wrong--but you can write us an angry letter, not invite us to parties, or tip off Nina Totenberg and NPR.\n\nThe Future is Not for Weenies.
