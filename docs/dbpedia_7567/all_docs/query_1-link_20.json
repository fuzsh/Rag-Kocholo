        "text": "Sarah Silverman is a stand-up comedian, actress, singer, producer, and writer. When attending New York University, she began to pursue the Manhattan comedy scene and logged as much time in the comedy clubs as she did in the classroom. In 1993, she joined \"Saturday Night Live\" and has since built a successful career in comedy. Silverman became politically active during the 2016 United States presidential election, campaigning for Bernie Sanders.\n\nSilverman was a writer and performer on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and she starred in and produced \"The Sarah Silverman Program,\" which ran from 2007 to 2010 on Comedy Central. She released an autobiography, \"The Bedwetter,\" in 2010, which she adapted into an off-Broadway musical in 2022, earning her Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations. In addition to her work on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Sarah Silverman Program,\" she also appeared in other television programs such as \"Mr. Show,\" \"V.I.P.,\" and \"Star Trek: Voyager,\" among others. She starred in films, including Who's the Caboose?, School of Rock, Wreck-It Ralph, A Million Ways to Die in the West, and Ralph Breaks the Internet.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2018, Silverman hosted the Hulu web television late-night talk show \"I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman.\" In 2020, she launched \"The Sarah Silverman Podcast,\" discussing various topics and responding to listener call-ins. Silverman's comedy often addresses social taboos and controversial topics, including racism, sexism, homophobia, politics, and religion. Her work in comedy has earned her two Primetime Emmy Awards and several nominations, including ones for a Screen Actors Guild Award for her lead role in \"I Smile Back\" and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\"\n\nOn October 10, 2019, Silverman was featured in a 30-minute YouTube documentary called \"Laughing Matters,\" created by SoulPancake in collaboration with Funny or Die, where a variety of comedians discuss mental health. She is open about her lifelong battle with clinical depression, which at one point led to her developing an addiction to Xanax. She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug Zoloft. Silverman is also known for her activism and advocacy work, particularly in the areas of reproductive and LGBT rights."
