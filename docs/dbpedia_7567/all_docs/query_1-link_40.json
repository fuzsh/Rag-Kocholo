        "text": "American comedian Sarah Silverman was born in 1970, in Bedford, New Hampshire. After dropping out of New York University, Silverman focused on the stand-up comedy circuit and received her big break in 1993 as a writer and performer on Saturday Night Live. After that stint, she worked many years as a writer, comedian and actress, becoming known for her good looks and politically incorrect statements. Her 2005 film, Jesus Is Magic, released and highlighted her one-woman comedy show. Two years later, she starred in The Sarah Silverman Show. Silverman continues to write and act on TV and in film."
