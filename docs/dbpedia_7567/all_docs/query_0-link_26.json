        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus returns for Season 2 of her award-winning podcast, Wiser Than Meâ¢. Each week, she has funny, touching, personal conversations with iconic older women who are brimming with the kind of unapologetic attitude and wisdom that only comes with age. Julia sits at the feet of some extraordinary teachers this season (discover who in the trailer), and of course her 90-year-old mom, Judy. Tune in to laugh, cry and get wise. All Hail Old Women!Â Photo: Ryan Pfluger and August Image\n\n5.0 (7)\n\nCOMEDY\n\nTo be human is to fail â period. And not just to fail once, but to fail a lot. As the author Samuel Beckett said: âFail again. Fail better.â This saying means a lot to me and my family â so much so that my daughter got a tattoo of it. Why are we, and so many others, so deeply concerned by failure? And if itâs something we all do so often, why are we so afraid of it â especially those of us here in win-at-all-costs America? In this podcast, I sit down with successful, thoughtful people like Ben Stiller, Bette Midler, Sean Penn and more to talk about failure â or what they labeled âfailure,â but what was really an unparalleled opportunity for growth and revelation. I even want to delve into my own hardest moments, when I wrestled with setbacks, shame, and fear. Weâll still fail again. And again. But maybe if we fail better, weâll feel better -- and maybe if we can all laugh together in failure, that's a start.\n\n0.0 (0)\n\nSOCIETY & CULTURE\n\nThe epic true story of an Italian Jewish family, split apart by love, fascism and war. Through shocking discoveries - and Stanley Tucciâs artistry - an enthralling personal history comes to life. When documentarian David Modigliani was a kid, his grandfather, Franco, won the Nobel Prize. But, Davidâs always been more fascinated by the love story that made it possible -- his grandparents' romance on the run from Fascist Italy. When he digs into their story, he uncovers a darker side to their fairytale escape: a brother left behind to face the Nazi occupation - and startling personal connections between his family and Benito Mussolini. In the Tribeca-winning podcast, PACK ONE BAG, he returns to Italy to investigate his family's past, carrying a pressing question: if Fascism takes over your country, do you stay, or do you try to flee? And what happens if you canât? From Live Action Projects, Gilded Audio, and Lemonada Media.

One of those places was Samâs childhood home in the English village of Great Chishill, literally called The Pink House. It was a space of total warmth and love where Sam felt safe enough to find their voice. On the podcast, Sam is sitting down with good friends and queer icons to explore their own âPink Houses,â how they navigated early struggles and ultimately found their place in the world. From Elliot Pageâs childhood bedroom to Joel Kim Boosterâs joyful stint at a Cold Stone Creamery, Sam and their guests bring us transformative stories of belonging, chosen families, and the journeys we take to become who we were destined to be. This series feels like lighting a warm candle and enjoying a cup of tea with a dear friend. Learn how to love yourself, show up for others, and create a world that supports beauty of all kinds.
