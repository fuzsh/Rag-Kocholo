        "text": "AKA Sarah Kate Silverman\n\nBorn: 1-Dec-1970\n\nBirthplace: Bedford, NH\n\nGender: Female\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Comic, Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: The Sarah Silverman Program\n\nSarah Silverman first performed stand-up at 17, at a club in Boston. After a brief stint as a college student, she was supporting herself with comedy by the age of 20, and by age 22 she was on SNL, alongside Phil Hartman, Mike Myers, and Adam Sandler. She says she was fired from SNL in a fax, but within weeks she was a regular on Mr. Show with Bob and David. She worked steadily in films and on stage through the 1990s before returning to the tube for Greg the Bunny with Seth Green and Crank Yankers with Jimmy Kimmel, who was her romantic entanglement for several years.\n\nRecognisable (yet uncharacteristic) Silverman performances include Kramer's girlfriend on Seinfeld, as Cameron Diaz's girlfriend in There's Something About Mary, and as Jack Black's roommate's girlfriend in School of Rock. She also starred in a 2005 comedy concert film, Jesus Is Magic.\n\nIn a 2001 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, she told a joke with the punchline, \"I love chinks,\" for which the Media Action Network for Asian Americans demanded an apology. NBC and O'Brien both apologized, but Silverman never did. The joke is about trying to get out of jury duty, and as Silverman told it, a friend suggested to her, \"Why don't you write something inappropriate on the form, like 'I hate chinks'?\" But she says she did not want to be thought a racist, so instead, \"I just filled out the form and I wrote, 'I love chinks' -- and who doesn't?\"\n\nFather: Donald Silverman (author, The Enemy Is Me)\n\nMother: Beth Ann Halpin (m.
