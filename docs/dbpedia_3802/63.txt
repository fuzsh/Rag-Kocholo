We had a truly wonderful stay in this amazing property, with a really helpful and friendly team. The property was beautiful, spacious and in impeccable condition, and exceeded our expectations from the listing. Whilst being on a small complex of holiday homes, our little house and garden area felt peaceful and private. It consistently felt like the owners had gone that extra mile to make everything effortlessâ€¦ including a lovely welcome pack, local information shared, car chargers, games room and thoughtfully equipped property overall. We would not hesitate to recommend.

GARETH, LOUISE, LUCY &AMP; DOM EDMONDS

To celebrate my wife's 70th birthday we booked the Farmhouse, Sycamore and Oak Cottage. Which perfectly housed our family of 10 and 12 close friends. Ages ranged between 78 and 4 months and we all spent a wonderful weekend in this splendid location. We cannot speak highly enough of the quality of all the accommodation and everyone was impressed with the facilities. With most taking advantage of the hot tubs. The reception staff are very friendly and helpful and we could not have chosen a better spot. We even had beautiful weather, which made our visit even more fabulous. May congratulations to the owners and team - they couldn't have provided anything more for their guests.
