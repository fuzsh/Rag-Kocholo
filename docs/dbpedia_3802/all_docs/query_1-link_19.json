        "text": "Make sure you can afford it\n\nMake sure that you can afford the rent being asked, either from your own income or with available State support, such as:\n\nHousing Assistance Payment (HAP)\n\nRent Supplement\n\nRental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)\n\nIf you will be claiming Rent Supplement or HAP, make sure that you know the local maximum rent level allowed. There is some flexibility in certain situations, allowing for higher rents to be covered.\n\nKnow about your equality rights when renting residential property\n\nLandlords cannot discriminate against potential tenants on grounds of:\n\nGender\n\nCivil status\n\nFamily status\n\nSexual orientation\n\nReligion\n\nAge\n\nDisability\n\nRace\n\nMembership of the Traveller community\n\nYou also cannot be discriminated against when renting because you are getting a:\n\nHousing Assistance Payment (HAP)\n\nRent Supplement\n\nAny other social welfare payment\n\nThis means that landlords cannot state when advertising accommodation that HAP or Rent Supplement is not accepted, and they cannot refuse to rent you accommodation because you are getting a social welfare payment. This is outlined in the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015.\n\nIf you feel you have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, you can find out more about making a complaint under the Equal Status Acts.\n\nRead more on the website of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC).\n\nKnow your rights and responsibilities\n\nBe aware of your rights and your obligations as a tenant and your landlord's rights and obligations. For example, your landlord must provide you with a rent book and ensure that the accommodation meets certain minimum physical standards. They must also register the tenancy with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) every year.\n\nIf the landlord wants you to sign a fixed-term lease, don't agree unless you are sure you want to stay for that length of time. If you leave before the end of a fixed-term lease, you may lose your deposit.\n\nIf you are renting a room in your landlord's home, your tenancy is not covered by landlord and tenant legislation, but it is covered if you are renting a self-contained apartment or flat. Read more in our document on Sharing accommodation with your landlord.\n\nMake an inventory\n\nAt the start of a tenancy ask the landlord for a written list of all furnishings and appliances. You and the landlord should sign this list to show that you agree on the furnishings supplied and their condition. This will help to prevent disputes during your stay and when you are leaving. This list should be included in the rent book.\n\nMake sure that you note any signs of damage by previous tenants. You could photograph or otherwise record the existing condition of the property including any damage to walls, furniture or appliances.\n\nIf there are outstanding repairs, ask the landlord to state in writing that they will be completed.\n\nWhat is a holding deposit?\n\nSome landlords or agents may ask you for a holding deposit when you decide to take the accommodation. This is a sum of money you pay to hold the property before you sign the lease and enter into a contract with the landlord. You should always get a written receipt for a holding deposit. Holding deposits are often not refundable if you don’t take up the accommodation.\n\nwhat is a security deposit?\n\nYou will be asked for a security deposit before moving into the accommodation. The landlord holds this deposit as security to cover any rent arrears, bills owing or damage beyond normal wear and tear at the end of the tenancy.\n\nHow much should I pay for a deposit?\n\nYou cannot be forced to make upfront payments of more than 2 month’s rent. This includes a deposit of a month’s rent and one month’s rent in advance. This restriction applies to all tenancies created from 9 August 2021 and is set out in the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021.\n\nStudents in student-specific tenancies can opt-out of this restriction and pay a larger upfront payment if they want. The RTB has a guidance document (pdf) and FAQs (pdf) about this legislation.\n\nCan I get help to pay a deposit?\n\nIf you are getting a social welfare payment and are unable to pay the deposit, the Department of Social Protection’s representative (formerly the Community Welfare Officer) may be able to help with paying a deposit under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.\n\nIf you are in emergency homeless accommodation, your local authority may help with your deposit to get accommodation under the HAP scheme. You should contact the housing section of your local authority for further information on this.\n\nCan I lose my deposit?\n\nYou should get a receipt for any deposit you pay. Your rent book should state how much of a deposit you paid. You may lose your deposit if:\n\nYou leave without giving proper notice, or leave before the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nYou cause damage to the accommodation beyond normal wear and tear\n\nYou leave with bills or rent unpaid.\n\nRental scams are when someone tries to take money from you when you are trying to find somewhere to rent. For example, the person might claim they can’t show you accommodation they have advertised, then take your deposit and disappear.\n\nWhen you are looking for a place to rent, you should be aware of rental scams and how to avoid them. Before you make any payment or agreement with your landlord you should always view the property in person and make sure you are happy with the tenancy terms and conditions.\n\nTypes of rental scams\n\nRental scams generally fall into one of the following 3 categories:\n\nThe scammer asks for a deposit but claims they can’t show you the property as they are out of the country\n\nThe scammer is living at the property, shows it to different people and asks for rent off each one. They then disappear with the money.\n\nThe process seems to go as normal, however, you are given fake keys and the scammer disappears\n\nHow do I avoid getting scammed?\n\nThere are a number of things you can do to try and avoid being scammed. You should:\n\nInspect the property in person. Do not rely on online videos or photos when viewing a property. Take a picture of the landlord or letting agent’s ID where possible.\n\nUse a secure payment method. Avoid making cash payments or transferring money directly to someone without verifying their identity and visiting the property. Get a receipt for any payments you make and avoid using unsecure payment methods like wire transfers or cryptocurrency.\n\nAsk for a contract. Request a written contract, such as a tenancy or licence agreement. This will explain the terms and conditions of your tenancy.\n\nDo your research. Be familiar with current rental prices in the area you want to rent. If something appears too good to be true, investigate further before making a payment.\n\nTake your time. Don’t rush into making a decision. Scammers will often try to rush you, but it is important to take your time and do your research before making a decision.\n\nLook for advice. If you are unsure about something and suspect it may be a scam, you can contact Threshold for advice.\n\nWhat should I do if I’ve been scammed?\n\nIf you realise you’ve been scammed, you should contact your bank or credit card company immediately.\n\nIf you have transferred money online or have given your bank details to someone, your bank can cancel your cards.\n\nIf you have been charged already, you may be able to get the transaction reversed.\n\nYou should report the incident to your local Garda station. You should also report the scam to Threshold, who can help make other people aware of the scam."
