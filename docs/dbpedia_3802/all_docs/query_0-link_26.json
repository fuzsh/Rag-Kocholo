        "text": "The Boston Daily Globe: Friday, June 19, 1885.... Double Sheet. CAPTURED BY CANNIBALS. BY THOMAS W. KNOX .\n\nPART I. In many ways the world is rapidly becoming prosaic. The age of chivalry was gone long azo, if we may believe a celebrated writer; steam has destroyed the romance of the sea; the mystery of the unexplored rescions of Africa exists no longer: the maelstrom isa myth; the sources of the Nile have been visited and described, and even the sea serpent has fallen before the searching gaze of star-eyed science. The car of Juggernaut, which once crushed hundreds of victims in its annual processions, now remains harmless in its temple; the cremation of living widows at the sides of their dead husbands is rigidly prohibited through the length and breadth of India; and the kings of Uganda can today receive distinguished visitor without slaughterSTARE a dozen courtiers in his honor. The horrible fascination that clings to the cannibal and the story of his performances is greatly circumscribed, as the labors of missionaries and the spread of connerce have demonstrated that man can be put to better uses than to be served up for provisions .\n\nBut the cannibal still lingers in some parts of the world, though he is only to be found by those who seek him with great diligence. Within the memory of those of us who have not yet passed beyond middle life the inhabitants of the Feejee Islands were noted for their habit of devouring the bodies of their enemies, and also. under certain circumstances, those of their friends; since missionaries and merchants were established there, and the islands became subject to Great Britain, the British prejudices have prevailed, and the practice is now confined to a few benighted tribes of the interior. When the missionaries began their teachings the natives gave ready approval to the scriptural injunction \"love your enemies,\" but they were disappointed to learn that it had no reference to the love of a gourmet for a canvas back duck. Tanoa, the old ruler of the Feejees and father of the late King Thakombau, had a palate so delicate that he could distinguish between the English sailor or the French one when served at the table, and he could even name the people of the different islands of the Feejeean group when a slice of each was placed before him .\n\nAn acquaintance of mine claims to have had a narrow escape from being the piece de resistance at one of Tana's banquets, and of being taken to and into the royal bosom. He told me the story one day when we were sailing over the Pacitic, and wondering if the good old times of the cannibals would ever come again. was on a whale ship,\" said he, \"that was cruising in the South Pacific and had put into the Feejees for water. The ship was old and leaky, the captain was a tyrant and his first mate a brute, and every sailor on the ship was ready 10 desort at the first opportunity. We had a chance to go into one of the groups where there were no cannibals, but the captain knew that if he did there wouldn't be a man of us left: his only hope of holding on to a crew was by having them choose between the ship and the natives, who would eat them up .\n\nThe most frightful stories were told about the practices of the people, and not one of us would venture a yard from the beach where we landed to get water. We kept the natives at a distance and made them understand that while we would leave plenty of trinkets and old hoops on the shore to pay for the water, we wouldn't go near the little creek on the beach unless they stayed a good way off from it. They had no canoes there, and so they didn't bother us by trying to get on board. \"One afternoon a party. of us had gone ashore to till the last of the casks: the mate was with us and it was one of his ugliest days, for he kicked us about as though we had no more feeling than the boat or the ground we stood on .\n\nBecause didn't please him about something he struck me with an oar. and then I struck back with my fist and downed him. The rest of the men pulled ane off, but they didn't pull very hard, as they were all right glad to see the fellow pounded at last. When they got us apart I saw what I had done, and knew the mate would have his revenge on me as soon as we got to sea again. I thought it all over in second, and in my frenzy concluded I might as well be eaten by the savages as beaten to death by the mate and thrown over for the sharks before we made another port .\n\nturned and went straight for the bushes, where I knew the natives were watching just said good-by to my shipmates and nothing more. They yelled for me to come back, but I didn't turn nor stop. The inate started after me, but he thought better of it and wheeled around before going twenty yards. live or ten minutes I wag in the middle of a group of natives, who were armed with spears and clubs and had their bodies streaked and painted in a hideous way. They wore no clothing except a strip around the waist, and more than half of them could not boast as much as that .\n\nThey tore off my clothes and then examined my limbs exactly as a butcher examines 41 OX to ascertain his condition. One old fellow. who seemed to have some sort of authority over the rest pinched my arm till I almost screamed with pain; the fact that I didn't scream seemed to impress him favorably, and at a word from him I was less rudely treated after that. wasn't a particularly good prize, as the hard fare on the ship had made que pretty thin, and my ribs fairly stuck out you might count 'em. I saw they disapproved of me, but probably they reasoned that half a loaf was better than no bread, and so they took me along .\n\n\"Three of the natives escorted me through the tropical forest, white the rest remained, probably with a view to making more captures if opportunity offered. or to gather up whatever the ship's crew should leave behind in payment for the privilege of taking water. We did not stOp we had gone a couple of miles back from the shore and ascended a hill. Through a rift in the trees I saw the bont return to the ship with the water casks, and in a little while the anchor was raised and the old craft sailed out of the bay and stood away to sea. I was alone with the cannibals .\n\n\"We waited for the men who had stayed behind, and as 50011 as they jomed us the march was resumed. A little before sunset we caine to a village of thatched huts, perhaps twenty or thirty in all, in a sort of irregular circle surrounding all open space; in the centre of this space was raised platform over which WitS thatched roof elevated on posts about ten feet high. This was the council hall where all public business was transacted; served as a lounging place by day, and also as a hotel where strangers could be lodged at night. The sides of the structure were entirely open when we arrived, but in less than a quarter of hour the building was completely enclosed by strips of wide, matting stretched between the posts. Was made to understand that 1 must remain in the council hail, and to make sure that did not run away two of the natives were at my side, or, rather, one was constantly at each side of me .\n\nThey brought me some roasted bread fruit and raw cocoanuts, gave me a mat to lie oll and another for covering, and while never relaxing their vigilance toward me they treated ine with kindness and respect. PART 11. didn't sleep well, you may be sure, and what sleep I had was disturbed by unpleasant dreams, which seemed to foreshadow my fate. But when waking I consoled myself with the reflection that Lahould have been 10 better off had I stayed on the whaleship and been subjected to the mate's cruelties. In the morning they fed me again with bread fruit and cocoanut .\n\nto which was added fish which had been roasted over the coals and was really very good. The whole population, men, women and children, came to look at ine, and after a good deal of jabbering, of which I could not understand a word, but which evidently referred to me, two of the men started through the forest in a direction opposite to the one whence we came. Then the conference broke up, but for the rest of the day I was au object of curiosity. \"For three days I was kept a close prisoner, and on the morning of the fourth was taken through the woods by a winding path. perhaps twenty miles, to a large villave, assembled where hundreds of natives were as if for a grand festival .\n\n'The village surrounded an open space of at least an acre in extent. At one end of this space was 1 mound or platform, perhaps eight feet high, and in front of the platform was a stone that looked like a large gate-post. Old Tanoa and his principal officers were sitting on the mound just behind the stone: the natives, armed with their clubs and spears, were scattered over the level ground and waiting for the terrible ceremonies to begin. was led to the foot of the mound, where other prisoners, their hands want feet securely tied with cords, were lying on the ground, and at a word from the king I was similarly bound and placed by their side. The crowd opened so as to make a lane from the stone to the end of the plaza, and then began the terrible ceremonies which preceded the cannibal feast .\n\n\"Fires were burning at the rear of the mound and I could see the smoke rising in feathery curls from at least a dozen places. Tanoa waved his hand as a signal that all Was ready, and immediately several athiletie fellows stepped from the crowd; two of them seized each prisoner and carried him about fifty yards away from the front of the mound and then placed him on the ground again. All my fellow-victims were natives, and, as I afterward learned, were uptured in a foray upon a neighboring land. the in cannibal days to devour their prisoners of war and those killed in battle. Tribes often went on the war-path solely for the purpose of obtaining victims to be served up as food, very much as in other lands expeditions are organized for hunting deer or other wild animals whose flesh is edible .\n\nThe crews of wrecked ships or boats were always killed and eaten: they were regarded as the gifts of Providence, and the people often besought their gods to send them a wreck that they might be provided with food. This superstition regarding those who were unfortunate enough to be cast on their shores was more firmly fixed in the minds of the cannibals than any other, and they clung to it after relinquishing their claim to make war in order to eat those whom they captured. couch shell was blown as the signal for beginning the slaughter. One of the prisoners was seized by his two enstodians, who each grasped an arm and a leg, and then ran rapidly along the lane till they dashed their victim's head against the great stone I have described. Then another and another was disposed of in the same way and carried off to the rear of the mound, and my turn had arrived! Horrible as was this mode of death, it was after all a merciful one, as it was unaccompanied by torture .\n\nA single blow against the stone and all was over. \"I had been lying on my back, with my head turned to one side, during the dispatching of my companions in captivity, and, with my experience as a sailor, had managed to work loose the knots that bound my hands, but I did not remove the cord. My executioners seized me in the customary manner and started on their deadly mission. As they did so they doubled my legs under me so that the knot around my ankles touched my hands. Instantly I unfastened the cord, but still held hands and feet as closely together as though the lashings were secure .\n\nAnd now for the grand stroke which should save me. \"Suddenly, I gave a violent spring with hands and feet that threw my bearers to the ground, as they were totally unprepared for anything of the kind. I went to the ground with them. but was up in an We were not six feet away from the foot of the execution stone, and the head of one of my late bearers touched it. the agility of a cat-for I was a great deal younger then than now--I sprang to the top of the mound, and right in front of old Tanoa .\n\nI Aung my arms wildly about. and then dropped on the ground at his feet. I afterwards learned that he thought I was invoking the vengeance of heaven upon him for the great peril I had passed through, and my prostration was to indicate that he was the greatest of terrestrial sovereigns. I really had no thought further than to ask that he would spare my life, though I had counted upon the dramatic effect of my having released myself from my bonds and stood before him. wild shout went up from the crowd, and the king sat as though he had never been more surprised in his life .\n\nIf I had been down by the stone I should have been finished off in a minute, but at the feet of the king was safe until he ordered otherwise. as it would be highly improper for the warriors to mount the platform while his majesty was there. The seconds seemed like hours while I waited for the king's decision, which he finally gave: 'The dead are dead, and shall be eaten; the white man shall \"The bodies of had been killed were cooked and devoured: I was allowed to go about wherever I pleased, but was always accompanied by two warriors. They offered to show me the ovens, but I had no liking for the horrible sight and indicated my desire to get 8.9 far from it as I could. Besides my inettable disgust I was fearful that the king might change his mind or that some of his subjects would take upon themselves the task of executioner and despatch me without the royal leave .\n\nBut I must do them the justice to say that from that time on they never manifested the least desire to barm me. \"I was sent back to the village where I was first taken after my capture, and became the slave of the chief, but my slavery: was of the lightest sort. I was treated more like a companion than a 'servant, possibly for the reason that, as the Feejeeans can practically live without work, there was very little work to do. I learned a good deal of their language, went with them in the forest and in pursuit of fish, and loitered around the council hall when there was nothing else to do. \"I lived there nearly a year, and if I could have been assured that there was no danger of being slaughtered and eaten should have been, the perfectly willing to stay among those people rest of my life .\n\nThey were unwilling to have me leave them, and twice when ships came in for water they hurried me away from the coast to make sure that I did not escape; whether they desired my society or were actuated by the fear that should tell about their customs I never knew, but certainly they tried every means in their power to prevent my leaving them. \"In course of time they grew less watchful, and I occasionally went off by myself for a few hours without exciting suspicion. always went toward the coast, but invariably took a circuitous route: when in sight of the sea 1 scanned it carefully for a sail. and if none was in sight immediately retraced my steps to the village. Toward the end of the year I did this every day or two, or as often as I thought it safe .\n\nI generally returned with a bunch of bananas or a cluster of bread fruit, so that my absence was ostensibly in search of food. day my heart came into my mouth! I looked through a rift in the trees a ship was standing into the little bay where our old whaler had anchored at the time I had my fight with the mate and threw myself into the arms of the cannibals. Away I went down the path as fast as I could run; luckily I didn't meet any one. and went at such a pace that no pursuer could have caught me. Out I came on the beach just as the anchor went down to the sandy 'bottom .\n\nI looked back and thought some of the village people were coming. I didn't wait to make sure of it. but plunged in and swam off to the ship. \"It was a long swim, and I was near drowning. but I got there all right and was hauled on board .\n\nThe captain heard my story, then ordered me to be dressed and set to work, and went to work with a will. He was a rough, blunt, good-hearted man from New Bedford. His mate was pretty severe with the men, but a vast improvement on my old one. All's well that ends well, and I have nothing particularly to regret in that eventful residence in Feejee. afterward learned that my former ship went down with all on board a few weeks after I deserted her .\n\nand so my escape to the man caters was my Origin of a Name. (Troy Pickens county, has a post office named \"Talking Rock.\" The origin of the in the vicinity large stone upon which name is thus stated: Some one discovered had been painted the words: \"Turn me over.\" It required considerable strength to accomplish this, and when it was done, the command: \"Now turn me back, and let me fool some one else.\" was found painted on the other side of the stone.

How They Beat the TransContinental Railroad. Turning Up in the Cars at the Most Unexpected Times. Running the Greatest Risks in Order to Make Connections .\n\nYork CHEYENNE, June have never been more numerous along the line of the Union Pacific than they are now. The road swarms with them, and they are going in every direction. Conductors and train men have harder work than usual running these fellows down. Sometimes they seem to rise right up out of the ground, and such a thing as getting away from them seems out of the question. A and thinlyclad young fellow ambled into the depot here last night, and, after endeavoring to scrape an acquaintance with several people .\n\nsaid to a bystander: \"I've beat my way from Chicago, and am going through to the coast in the same fashion.\" \"You don't mean to say that you beat a passenger train all the way from Chicago, do you?\" asked the man spoken to. \"I replied the tramp, grinning. \"I came through on express time. and got here just as quick as the man who road in the parlor car, which I Further conversation elicited the fact that the tramp had curled himself up under a seat in the smoking car and had not once been detected during his long ride. The quarters were not comfortable, but the fellow did not look as though he had ever had a great deal of comfort in the world, and he was not the worse for it .\n\nThe talk was in full progress when a brakeman who was waiting for his train observed: \"That seat racket is what gives us passenger men more trouble than any other. In the first place, only a small and lean man or boy can get under a seat, and it is not always possible to see under them. Some passengers' are ugly at the company, and when they find stowaways they take pains to conceal them from us, and rather enjoy feeding them. Since this last run of tramps got so bad our conductor has made us go through the train and look under the seats after leaving each station. \"Last week I did this regularly in two cars, and found nobody .\n\nAlong toward midnight. The Conductor Entered the smoking car in a big hurry, and undertook to go through it at a rapid rate, when he tripped on something and fell the whole length of the car. He swore so that nearly all the passengers raised themselves up to see what was the matter, and I came in just at that minute in a hurry, too, and fell just as the conductor had, striking my lantern against his. and breaking them both. Then he jumped on me for not attending to my business, and we went back and found a couple of suspicious-looking feet sticking out from under a seat .\n\nWe knew what that meant, and rousing up the passengers we hauled out a thin young fellow who was sleeping on the floor under a seat, and whose feet had accidentally got into the aisle. Of course we dumped him off at the first station, and then accused two of the passengers of hiding him, but they swore they had never seen him before. When the conductor found that he could not get any satisfaction out of them he began on me, and since then I have made it a point to get down on my knees and crawl through the car after leaving each station. The passengers don't like it, but it can't be helped.\" In spite of the care taken by the railroad men, they tind it impossible to prevent hundreds of impecunious adventurers from beating their way over the lines. Putting them off only delays them; it does not prevent them from reaching their destination in the course of time .\n\nThey haunt the depots and side tracks, and the moment a train stops they are on. \"I've known these tramps,\" said a freight brakeman, \"to get on when the train was in motion and take their places on the trucks. They become surprisingly expert in these things. We have been lying on sidings many a time where there were a lot of tramps, and knowing that they were only awaiting a good chance to get on, we would stand along the track watching them. As soon as the train got under way they would approach the cars and .\n\nseizing the hand rail, swing themselves in on the bumpers and crawl down on the trucks. I don't believe there are a dozen train men from Omaha to San Francisco that could or would do that trick with the cars in motion, but these fellows never seem to have any trouble with it. Of course, a slip of any kind Would be Sure Death, kind of travel is The Dust and the Noise. Otherwise it's very comfortable. What time does the next east-bound freight come but, SO far as I know, none of these tramps ever gets killed, not when there is a brakeman around to get it, any way .\n\nRunning this way from station to station, I have seen the same tramps at every station for 200 miles. When we left one station they would be on the platform, singing and dancing, and when we drew up at the next there were the same fellows, and all the time between the two places a not one of them could be seen from the tops or the ends of the cars. They were all underneath, hanging on to the trucks, the brake chains. and, I sometimes think, the wheels.\" A seedy man, who looked as though he had been on the road a good while, introduced himself to the crowd with a remark to the effect that he was a brake-beam tourist; that he had never paid the overland roads a doliar, and never would. took a prejudice agin these railroaders when they first came out,\" he continued, \"and the only thing I'll ever have to do with 'em is to hump it along on the trucks .\n\nI've got a claim up in the country, about forty miles from Ogden, and I'm on my way to Missouri to attend my daughter's wedding. The old woman went on past here Friday, and she is now five days ahead of me, but I'm making pretty fair time. I had about the softest snap you ever see for 300 miles this side of Ogden. I had a truck with a plank on it, and I was getting along beautiful when one of the boxes got hot, and the men, coming around with torches to pack it, got on to me. I had to come out, of course, and being a little old and stiff, I couldn't catch on to that train again, and I had to wait thirty-six hours before got another .\n\nI only changed cars three times coming from Ogden here. \"You was a-sayin' that you never knew one of us to get killed. I have, though. I was with two men last summer beating our way from Rawlins west, when one of them was lost. Of course I don't know that he was killed, but I have mighty strong suspicions that way .\n\nThe three of us were on one truck. and things were goin' along so smooth that we got kind of reckless, and one of the men, a haymaker from Ohio, lost his grip somehow and disappeared. As the train was making pretty good time, and there were about fifteen cars behind us. I think I know what became of him. The only objection I have to this along?\" Just as he said the words a freight train lumbered up and paused a moment before taking a side track .\n\nThree er four dirt-begrimed fellows sauntered into the waiting room. looked at the clock, and backed up to the empty stove as if expecting to find some warmth there. The man who had just spoken looked them oyer carefully, and pronouncing them \"no good\" got a man off in the corner, and proceeded to talk him to death. Five minutes later one of the new comers undertook to get away with a satchel and overcoat lying on a settee, and he and his associates were promptly That's arrested and of carted off to jail. the curse the business,\" said the old man .\n\nof those chaps have no principle, and ride around just to pick up things that don't belong to them. It's different with me. In the first place, I enjoy the travelling, and in the next, there's nothing wrong In it, so long as you don't hurt anybody. The moment they pass: a law agin it I'll quit it and go The city marshals of railroad towns in the West are very active in fighting the tramp evil, and the companies see that they do not lose anything by it. The other day Officer Bean of this city drove about a dozen tramps out of town, and both he and the train men supposed that the train got away without them; after the cars had gone some distance Bean, looking after them, saw the gang sitting on top of the train with their feet hanging over the sides .\n\nIt was just getting dusk, and if they had not been discovered they would have ridden there all night, getting down between the cars and hiding on the bumpers when occasion demanded. Going to the telegraph office, the marshal telegraphed to the conductor that the crowd was on his train, and at the station where the first stop was made they were rounded up, and the train got away. A favorite resort of the city marshals is to arrest the tramps and then promise them immwnty if they will leave the town on foot. In this town the road west is visible for iniles, while that east is soon lost sight of by a curve. When taken to the track the invariably that thev want to go east, but the officer always makes them travel west, where he can follow them with a telescope for A long distance .\n\nPatriarchal Canary, Sacramento Record Union. 1 Professor J.

SUFFERERS FROM HO Nervous Debility, Youthful PE Indiscretions, Lost Manhood, BE YOUR OWN PHYSICIAN! Many men, from the effects of youthful weakness that has reduced the general sysimprudence, have brought about a state of tem so much as to induce almost every other disease, and, the real cause of the trouble scarcely ever being suspected, they are doctored for everything but the right one. Notwithstanding the many valuable reniedies that medical science has produced for relief of this class of patients, none of the ordinary modes of treatment effect a cure. During our long and extensive tice in these special cases we have experimented with and discovered new and concentrated remedies .\n\nWe now offer the same: to the weak and debilitated and all those who have tried every other method unsuccessfully. To such we can honestly recommend our genuine CONCENTRATED REJUVENATING EAST INDIAN REMEDY. This unrivalled medicine is adapted to every condition of nervous debility and weakness in either sex, and especially in those cases resulting from imprudence and its attendant train of evils. The recuperative powers of this restorative are truly astonishing, and its use contiuued for a short time changes the languid, debilitated, nerveless condition to renewed life and vigor. Price per package, or, we will furnish six packages, which will cure most cases, for 85, fully prepaid by mail .\n\nAddress or call on New England Medical Institute, 24 Tremont Row, BOSTON, MASS.
