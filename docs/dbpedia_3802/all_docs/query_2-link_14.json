The cottage is sat within the grounds of Rievaulx Abbey amidst the rolling North Yorkshire countryside and in the valley of the ancient River Rye. The cottage was bullt using reclaimed abbey stone and close inspection reveals the medieval masons' marks on many of the blocks used in its construction. The interior of the cottage is spacious and comfortable for a family holiday so you may be tempted to simply stay at home and catch glimpses of the abbey through the cottage windows. Access to the abbey is through a gate from the cottage's private garden. It is adjacent to a cottage belonging to a local working estate.

Click on the hotspots and spin around to see right into each room.\n\nDiscover Rievaulx Abbey\n\nStep out of the cottage and you're in the abbey grounds, where the Cistercians were part of the greatest ecclesiastical organisation ever seen and where Rievaulx Abbey owned lands all over Yorkshire. So, it's no wonder Henry VIII wanted to get his hands on it. The abbey was founded in 1132 and when St Aelred became abbot 15 years later, there were 140 male choir monks and 500 lay brothers. And what a life they led - rising at 1.30am in summer (an extra hour in bed was allowed in winter) they would work and pray for 10 hours before enjoying their first meal. The walk from Rievaulx to Helmsley Castle, another English Heritage property, can be done in less than an hour and taking your time is the best way to walk along the three-mile trek. Author James Herriot lived near Rievaulx and described the view over the Vale of York as: \"the finest in England\".\n\nFind out more"
