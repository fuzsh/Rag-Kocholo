        "text": "BEFORE MAKING A BOOKING REQUEST THROUGH US, PLEASE READ THESE BOOKING TERMS CAREFULLY. WHEN YOU MAKE A BOOKING REQUEST THROUGH US (WHETHER BY THE SITE, EMAIL OR TELEPHONE), THESE BOOKING TERMS ARE DEEMED TO BE ACCEPTED BY YOU. WE DRAW YOUR ATTENTION IN PARTICULAR TO THE PARAGRAPHS HEADED 'OUR ROLE AND SCOPE OF OUR LIABILITY' (PARAGRAPH 3), 'WHAT WE ARE AND ARE NOT LIABLE FOR' (PARAGRAPH 16) AND 'OWNER'S LIABILITY' (PARAGRAPH 17). ALL KEY DEFINITIONS ARE IN THE 'WELCOME' PARAGRAPH.\n\n2 MAKING YOUR BOOKING\n\n2.1 To be eligible to make a Booking: To be eligible to make a Booking (i.e. to enter into a Booking Contract with us and Rental Contract with the relevant Owner):\n\n2.1.1 you must be 18 years of age or over and have the legal capacity to enter into legally binding agreements;\n\n2.1.2 you must register with us on our Site (in advance or when Booking) or by telephone by providing your full name, telephone number, email address and any other information that we may request in order to process your registration; and\n\n2.1.3 you must possess a valid payment method such as a valid debit or credit card, PayPal account or any other digital option as accepted by our Site.\n\n2.2 What you confirm: By submitting a Booking to us, you confirm that:\n\n2.2.1 everything in paragraph 2.1 is true and accurate; and\n\n2.2.2 you and the Guests agree to these Booking Terms.\n\n2.3 How to make a Booking: You may make a Booking directly using our Site or by contacting us by telephone or by email using the details contained at paragraph 21. If you provide your Booking details to us by email, we will send to you a link to the Site so that you can make a Booking and pay us online or we shall arrange to call you and follow the telephone Booking procedure outlined at paragraph 2.5.2.\n\n2.4 What making a Booking means: By making a Booking through us you are making an offer to:\n\n2.4.1 enter into a Rental Contract with the applicable Owner in relation to the Property you have selected;\n\n2.4.2 enter into the Booking Contract with us; and\n\n2.4.3 pay us all amounts due in respect of the Deposit and Total Charges.\n\nPlease note that no Rental Contract creates any type of landlord and tenant relationship. A Rental Contract only creates a temporary licence to occupy.\n\n2.5 The Booking Process: The following steps must take place before a Booking can be confirmed:\n\n2.5.1 For Site Bookings:\n\n2.5.1.1 You submit your Booking Details to us on the Site and provide your payment details which will be used by us to process the payment of your Deposit or Total Charges. Before submitting your Booking on the Site, the Booking process will give you the opportunity to review your Booking, including these Booking Terms and the Booking Details and, if you require, allow you to make any amendments to your Booking; and\n\n2.5.1.2 you will receive an on-screen acknowledgement of your Booking and a receipt for your payment by email at the email address you have provided us.\n\n2.5.2 For telephone Bookings:\n\n2.5.2.1 We will read to you your Booking Details and various other details for you to confirm they are accurate and you are happy with these details. You may make any required amendments at this point. After this, we will then request your payment details and we will process payment of your Deposit or Total Charges in respect of your Booking; and\n\n2.5.2.2 we will verbally confirm your booking reference and will send you a receipt for your payment by email at the email address you have provided to us.\n\n2.6 Confirming your Booking: Provided we have successfully processed your Deposit (and any other payment, if required) and the Property is available for the Holiday Period, we will send you an email (or a letter if you have not provided us with an email address) confirming your Booking together with a link to these Booking Terms and other details relating to your Booking. We call this the “Booking Confirmation”. Please note that you must check your emails and post regularly. If we do not hear from you within 24 hours of sending, we will take it to mean you are happy with these details. Also, please let us know promptly about any change to your postal or email address so that you inform us how to communicate with you.\n\n2.7 When your Booking is confirmed and when contracts are formed: When we provide you with the Booking Confirmation (which will be at the point we send you the email or post you a letter confirming your Booking), we are accepting your offer as outlined in paragraph 2.4 (including accepting your offer acting on the applicable Owner's behalf as its agent). It is at this point, when we send you the confirmation email or letter, which is your Booking Confirmation, that you enter into the legally binding Rental Contract with the Owner and the legally binding Booking Contract with us.\n\n2.8 Your responsibility to check the Booking Confirmation: Please check all the details in your Booking Confirmation promptly after receiving the Booking Confirmation and notify us as soon as possible, and in all cases within 24 hours of receipt of your Booking Confirmation, if you think there are any mistakes or errors with your Booking. If you notice that it is you who have made a mistake, we may be able to amend your Booking but you could incur additional costs (see paragraph 10). If we have made a mistake with your Booking or it contains any errors, which are our fault, you will need to contact us with 24 hours of receipt of your Booking Confirmation to confirm your correct Booking Details to us so we can then reissue your Booking Confirmation. You will not incur any additional costs for this.\n\n2.9 When we may cancel after a Booking Confirmation and costs involved: Even after we have sent you the Booking Confirmation, we on behalf of the Owner, have the right to cancel a Booking where we reasonably believe that:\n\n2.9.1 the Booking is not legitimate;\n\n2.9.2 you have broken or are likely to break any of the Booking Terms relating to a previous or current Booking;\n\n2.9.3 any information you have supplied is incorrect or insufficient; or\n\n2.9.4 you have behaved in an inappropriate, abusive or unlawful manner to us, our staff or any Owner.\n\nIf we cancel your booking in any of these circumstances we will tell you in writing and neither we nor the applicable Owner will have any further responsibility to you and you may have to pay us and the Owner and third parties (as applicable) all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in providing you with the Booking Services, Sykes Other Services, Rental Services and Third Party Other Services respectively up to the date we cancel the Booking.\n\n2.10 Unavailability of the Holiday Period. We may also, acting on behalf of the Owner, have the right to cancel a Booking even after we have sent you the Booking Confirmation, where the Owner notifies us that the Property is unavailable for your intended Holiday Period (and this is not due to an Unexpected Event (when clause 13.1 applies) or for one of the reasons referred to in clause 12 (when clause 12 applies)). If this occurs, the Owner shall refund you: (i) the Rental Charges that you have already paid for the Booking; (ii) the amount equivalent to the Booking Fee; (iii) the Sykes Other Services Charges and the Third Party Other Services Charges that you have already paid for the Booking; and (iv) any other compensation that may be due to you (other than any low deposit charge you have made directly to us). In these circumstances, and sometimes in other circumstances too, the Owner may be liable to pay us certain cancellation changes for failure to make the Property available for your Holiday Period, but this does not concern you, and you have no responsibility for such charges which are a matter between the Owner and us.\n\n2.11 Restrictions on Holiday Periods: There may be some restrictions on Bookings:\n\n2.11.1 Maximum Holiday Periods: The maximum holiday period for any Booking is generally 28 consecutive days, and is always subject to availability of the particular Property. However, certain Properties may have a shorter maximum Holiday Period, which will be clearly stated on the relevant Property description page on our Site. You will not be permitted to make a Booking for a Holiday Period which is longer than this maximum period.\n\n2.11.2 Minimum Holiday Periods: Certain Properties will only be available for Bookings of a minimum holiday period. Again this will be clearly stated on the relevant Property description page on our Site. You will not be permitted to make a Booking with a Holiday Period that is shorter than this minimum period.\n\n4 CHARGES AND PAYMENT\n\n4.1 What we tell you about the charges and when: Before submitting your Booking to us, you will be presented with or told the Total Charges payable for your Booking, together with a partial breakdown of the Total Charges such as:\n\n4.1.1 the Booking Fee. This becomes non-refundable once your Booking is confirmed by us with a Booking Confirmation (other than as set out in paragraphs 2.10 and 11); and\n\n4.1.2 any additional charges quoted during the Booking process when you make your Booking, for example, heating supplements, pet charges and other services you have purchased which may be part of the Rental Services and therefore part of the Rental Charge owed to an Owner; or which may be part of the Sykes Other Services or Third Party Other Services (and therefore part of the Sykes Other Services Charges owed to us or Third Party Other Services Charges owed to us for a third party, which we may collect on behalf of a third party).\n\n4.2 What we tell you about the Deposit and the Balance: If you are paying a Deposit rather than the entire Total Charges when making your Booking, you will also be presented with the date by which you will need to make payment to us for the Balance. The date you are required to pay the Balance will normally be 6 weeks before the start of your Holiday Period. Please note that we may (but are not obliged to) contact you via the contact details you provide us with to remind you of the due date for payment of the Balance. You should also take note of when the Balance is due for your own reference. However, if the date the Balance would normally fall due for your Booking has already passed, we will ask you at the time of the Booking to pay the Balance too.\n\n4.3 Forms of payment: We currently accept various forms of payment including via credit and debit card, PayPal or some other digital options. Please refer to our Site for details of the payment cards and other methods of payment that we currently accept.\n\n4.4 Price fluctuations: Charges may change from time to time due to changes in demand, such as school holidays, but changes will not affect any Booking you have made which we have confirmed with a Booking Confirmation (subject to what we say in paragraphs 4.7 and 4.8).\n\n4.5 Taking payments at the time of Booking: We take the payments due at the time of Booking from your chosen payment method once you have entered or otherwise provided your payment details and confirmed you wish to pay for the Booking, subject to payment authorisation.\n\n4.6 Taking payments after you receive your Booking Confirmation: If the Balance or any other additional payments are due after you receive your Booking Confirmation, then:\n\n4.6.1 if you authorised us to take payment for these amounts from your chosen payment method when you made your Booking, we will automatically take payment using your original payment method. If there has been a change to the Total Charges (for example, due to changes in exchange rates), we will contact you before taking the changed payment (see paragraph 5.2 below); or\n\n4.6.2 if you did not authorise us to take payment from your chosen payment method for these amounts when you made your Booking, or your chosen payment method that you authorised us to take payment from has expired or cannot be used by us and we contact you to inform you of this, you will need to make these payments either by using the payment feature within your account on the Site or by contacting us by telephone using the number set out in paragraph 21.\n\n4.7 Pricing errors found before a Booking Confirmation: We use our best efforts to ensure that these stated charges are correct at the time when you submit relevant information onto our systems. However, it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the charges on the Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check these prices as part of our confirmation procedures so that:\n\n4.7.1 where the actual Total Charges are less than those quoted to you at the time you made your Booking, we will charge the lower amount when providing you with the Booking Confirmation; and\n\n4.7.2 where the actual Total Charges are higher than those quoted to you at the time you made your Booking, we will contact you as soon as possible to inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to book the Property at the correct (higher) charges or cancelling your Booking. We will not process your Booking or issue the Booking Confirmation until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you within a reasonable time using the contact details you provided during the Booking process, we will treat the Booking as cancelled, refund the amounts you have paid us, and notify you in writing.\n\n4.8 Pricing errors found after a Booking Confirmation: If we accept and process your Booking where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing or we identify it within 48 hours of us accepting and processing your Booking, we may cancel your Booking, and refund you any sums you have paid to us.\n\n4.9 If you think the amounts due are wrong: If you think any amounts of which we notify you as due are wrong, please contact us promptly to let us know. You will not have to pay any interest until the dispute is resolved. Once the dispute is resolved we will charge you interest on correctly notified sums from the original date that such payments were due (see paragraph 5.3 below).\n\n4.10 VAT: Total Charges include VAT, where applicable, which you shall be responsible for paying.\n\n4.11 Total Charges are per Property: Total Charges quoted are per Property (and not per person). It is your responsibility to check the total price before completing the Booking process.\n\n4.12 Good housekeeping bond: Please note some Owners may charge a 'good housekeeping bond', which will be included alongside the charges quoted to you during the Booking process. If applicable to your Booking, the ‘good housekeeping bond’ may be paid by you via the two different methods explained in paragraphs 4.12.1 and 4.12.2 below:\n\n4.12.1 Payment to the Owner: we will tell you during the Booking process that the Owner will communicate directly with you to collect and (if appropriate) return this bond. We have no control over the payment or return of such bonds by the Owner. The Owner must, within 7 days of the end of the relevant Holiday Period return all or part of the bond to you and, if retaining any part of the bond, notify you in writing of the reasons for doing so; or\n\n4.12.2 Payment deducted by us: we will tell you during the Booking process that we will hold the payment details you used to make your Booking in order to collect the ‘good housekeeping bond’ via this payment method (if appropriate) and you authorise us to take this payment. If the payment details you have used to make your Booking have expired or cannot be used by us to collect the ‘good housekeeping bond’, then we shall contact you to arrange immediate payment of the bond from you. If you cancel the payment method provided to us for this purpose you must immediately provide us with an alternative payment method and authority for us to use it. The Owner must, within 7 days of the end of the relevant Holiday Period, notify us if they wish to claim all or part of the bond from you. If the Owner fails to notify us within this period then we will not collect any payment from you. If we do collect all any part of the bond, we will notify you in writing of the reasons for doing so. We have no control over whether the Owner instructs us to collect any part of the bond on their behalf, if you do not agree with the bond payment made to the Owner or deducted by us on behalf of the Owner, please follow the complaints procedure set out in paragraph 19.\n\n5 CURRENCIES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS\n\n5.1 Base currency: Unless otherwise stated, all charges are quoted in British Pounds Sterling.\n\n5.2 Different currencies: During the Booking process you may be presented with an option to pay for your Booking in one or more currencies. The payment currencies we accept for a particular Booking will be notified to you during the Booking process. The exchange rate for all payments will be based on exchange rates set by our internal systems, which may increase or decrease based on changes in the market. If on the date your Balance is due, changes to these exchange rates results in an increase of 5% or more to the Total Charges we quoted at the time you made your Booking, then we may increase the Balance to include this additional amount. If you do not wish to pay this amount, you may end your Rental Contract giving notice within 14 days of the date we notify you of the increase and we will refund you as outlined in paragraph 11.4.\n\n5.3 Interest for non-payment or late payment: If you do not make any payment to us by the date that payment is due we and/or an Owner may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 4% a year above the base lending rate of the Bank of England from time to time (but at 4% a year for any period when that base rate is below 0%). This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest together with any overdue amount.\n\n6 GIFT VOUCHERS\n\n6.1 Ordering gift vouchers: You may order gift vouchers by contacting us by email or telephone and we will send the vouchers using one of the methods that we have said is available to you that you choose and address that you specify in the form within 30 days of the date we receive your form. If you have not received your gift voucher or code within the applicable period, please contact us using the details set out in paragraph 21.\n\n6.2 Denominations: Gift vouchers are available in denominations of £25 and can be used to pay for Bookings in part or in full. Where the cost of a Booking is less than the value of the gift voucher, the remaining balance of the gift voucher remains valid and can be used for future Bookings (though it must be used before the voucher’s validity period expires). No cash refunds will be given.\n\n6.3 Redeeming gift vouchers: A gift voucher can be redeemed when making a telephone Booking by providing us with the unique code that appears on the gift voucher.\n\n6.4 Validity period of gift vouchers: Gift vouchers are valid for a period of 2 years from the date of purchase and can be used for any Booking with a Holiday Period that starts before the voucher's validity period expires. Any remaining balance on a gift voucher may no longer be used after expiry of its validity period.\n\n6.5 Bookings subsequently cancelled purchased with a gift voucher: If a Booking is purchased with a gift voucher and that Booking is subsequently cancelled, any refunded amount will be credited to the gift voucher, but the original expiry date of the gift voucher remains the same.\n\n6.6 Limits on use of gift vouchers: Gift vouchers cannot be exchanged for cash, replaced if lost or damaged and are non-refundable. We do not permit you or any third party to sell or trade our gift vouchers unless we have given you our written permission to do so.\n\n7 YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n7.1 Information you provide: You must make sure that all the information you provide in connection with your Booking, including all Booking Details, are true, accurate, current and complete.\n\n7.2 Your responsibility for transactions made under your name or account: You accept full financial and other responsibility for all transactions made under your name or account that you hold with us. We will notify you of any payments that are due and you shall be responsible for paying them within the timescales that we specify.\n\n7.3 Your promises to us and to Owners: You promise to us and to each Owner (as applicable) that before, during and after the Holiday Period:\n\n7.3.1 the number of people and pets occupying the Property will not exceed the number stated in the Booking Confirmation;\n\n7.3.2 you cannot arrange for additional visitors to come to the Property or hold events (such as parties, celebrations or meetings) at the Property without obtaining the written consent of the Owner in advance;\n\n7.3.3 the Property will be used solely for the purpose of a holiday or private accommodation by you and your Guests and will not be used for any commercial or business purpose. To be clear, you and your Guests are permitted to use the Property as private accommodation for work or business trips;\n\n7.3.4 you will (and you will ensure that your Guests will) show all due consideration and respect for the Owner, their representatives, neighbours and other persons or parties that have a connection with the Property. This includes refraining from abusing your right to use the Property or Rental Services or participating in any illegal, dangerous, offensive, inappropriate, violent or anti-social behaviour towards such people;\n\n7.3.5 you will (and you will ensure that your Guests will) use the Property and Rental Services lawfully, will not abuse or damage any facilities provided as part of the Rental Services and will comply with any health and safety or other policies or instructions notified to you by us or the Owner in connection with the Property or Rental Services;\n\n7.3.6 you will allow the Owner or any representative of the Owner (including any tradespeople) to access the Property at any reasonable time during the Holiday Period provided the Owner (or us acting on the Owner’s behalf) provides you with reasonable advance notice (except where the Owner requires access to the Property due to an emergency, for example, if repairs need to be carried out or the Owner becomes aware that you have breached, or has reasonable suspicion to believe that you will breach these Booking Terms);\n\n7.3.7 you will keep the Property and all furniture, utensils, equipment, fixtures and fittings in or on the Property in the same state of repair and condition as at the start of the Holiday Period and you will ensure that at the end of your Holiday Period the Property is left in the same state of order and cleanliness in which it was found. The Owner (or us acting on their behalf) may charge you for any additional, reasonable charges for professional cleaning after the end of your Holiday Period where you have failed to comply with this paragraph. These charges are necessary in order to return the Property to its original state of cleanliness and tidiness for future bookings by other customers;\n\n7.3.8 you will report as soon as possible to the Owner (or to the Owner’s representative) any breakages or damage caused by you or your Guests during the Holiday Period. Without affecting any other remedies that the Owner has under the Rental Contract, you promise to fully reimburse the Owner for the cost of replacement or repair for such breakages or damage. We may facilitate the collection of such payments from you on the Owner's behalf;\n\n7.3.9 you will arrive at the Property no earlier than the time confirmed in your Booking Confirmation on the first day of your Holiday Period and you will vacate the Property by no later than the time confirmed in your Booking Confirmation on the last day of your Holiday Period) or any other times as otherwise agreed with the Owner in writing;\n\n7.3.10 you will not allow any person other than you and your Guests to use the facilities and amenities of the Property without the express permission of the Owner;\n\n7.3.11 you will provide us or the Owners with any information that is reasonably requested from you or your Guests;\n\n7.3.12 you will keep the location of all keys/access cards for the Property, which the Owner shall provide you (or otherwise provide you details of in the Booking Confirmation), confidential and return all of them and other access mechanisms at the end of your Holiday Period to the location requested by the Owner in the Booking Confirmation or as the Owner may otherwise request from you; and\n\n7.3.13 you will notify all Guests before the Holiday Period starts of your and their obligations under this paragraph 7.3.\n\n7.4 Your responsibility for Guests: You will be responsible for all Guests staying at the Property and the things they do (and do not do) even if you do not stay there yourself during the Holiday Period.\n\n7.5 Your responsibility for travel and health documentation: You will be responsible for ensuring that you, your Guests and any pets have the relevant travel and health documents and requirements needed for visiting the country in which a Property is located. These include any passport or other identification documents, visa requirements and, in the case of pets, any vaccines or microchips. We will not be liable for any expenses incurred resulting from your missing, incomplete or incorrect documentation or any non-compliance with such requirements.\n\n7.6 Your responsibility to comply with the law: You will be responsible to ensure that you and your Guests comply with applicable laws (such as restrictions on travel or staying at properties due to health or lockdown or due to inclement weather).\n\n7.7 Failure to comply with anything in this paragraph 7: If you or any Guest fails to comply, or is likely to fail to comply, with any of the requirements set out in this paragraph 7, the Owner (or the Owner’s representative) may refuse to allow you and your Guests to enter and stay at the Property or can require you and your Guests to leave the Property before the end of the Holiday Period. In either case, you will be treated as having broken the terms of Rental Contract and your Booking will be cancelled. In these circumstances, you will not receive a refund of any of the Total Charges and neither we or the Owner shall be responsible for any other costs and expenses you have to pay due to you not being able to stay in the Property, such as the cost of finding any alternative accommodation or making alternative travel arrangements. This may also affect our decision as to whether or not to accept any future Booking from you.\n\n7.8 Failure to comply with anything in these Booking Terms: We shall also not be responsible for having to find alternative accommodation for you if you have breached any of your obligations under these Booking Terms.\n\n8 AN OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n8.1 An Owner’s promises to you: An Owner will:\n\n8.1.1 perform the Rental Services using reasonable care and skill;\n\n8.1.2 provide an accurate, complete and up to date description of the Property, and as soon as reasonably possible; notifying you in writing of any changes to the description of the Property and/or Rental Services relating to your Booking which would make our descriptions of the Property inaccurate, incomplete or misleading;\n\n8.1.3 subject to the exceptions in paragraphs 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6, ensure that the Property is vacant, not make any use of the Property (including conducting any viewings of the Property) and ensure that you and your Guests have exclusive access to the Property and Rental Services for the full period of the Holiday Period unless the Owner is entitled to refuse you and your Guests access to or requires you to leave the Property in accordance with paragraph 7.7;\n\n8.1.4 ensure that the Property is properly maintained, clean, tidy and in good repair at the start of the Holiday Period;\n\n8.1.5 ensure that the Owner, the Property and the Rental Services will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in particular, relating to fire, health, safety, utilities and planning and data protection;\n\n8.1.6 ensure that the Owner has the right to provide the Rental Services, let the Property and otherwise enter into the Rental Contract with you;\n\n8.1.7 maintain, at the Owner's expense and with a reputable insurance company, insurance policies to meet the Owner's liabilities under the Rental Contract with you;\n\n8.1.8 co-operate with you on all matters relating to the Rental Contract, including providing the Rental Services and processing any refunds that may be due to you (which we may facilitate);\n\n8.1.9 provide Property access details to you (including all cards and access codes) so you can make use of the Property for the Holiday Period and ensure that suitable arrangements are in place for you to collect and return the keys/access cards for the Property;\n\n8.1.10 show all due consideration and respect to you and your Guests including refraining from any dangerous, offensive, inappropriate, violent or anti-social behaviour towards you and your Guests;\n\n8.1.11 comply with the terms of the Rental Contract;\n\n8.1.12 respond to queries, complaints and problems which arise during or after the Holiday Period and use best efforts to resolve them (and we shall also try and facilitate a resolution if the Owner requests us to, or the Owner has previously authorised us to do so, on their behalf); and\n\n8.1.13 if VAT forms part of the Total Charges, provide you with a VAT invoice if you request one in writing.\n\n9 PETS\n\n9.1 Allowance for pets and extra charges: Pets are only allowed at a Property where this is expressly stated in the applicable Property description on the Site. There may be an additional charge for bringing pets, which we will notify you of at the time of Booking.\n\n9.2 Pets in a Property when they are not allowed: If a pet is taken to a Property that does not allow pets, or the stated number/size of pets is exceeded, the Owner (or the Owner’s representative) has the right to:\n\n9.2.1 refuse to allow you and your Guests to enter or stay in the Property; and/or\n\n9.2.2 ask you and your Guests to leave the Property before the end of the Holiday Period; and you must comply.\n\n9.3 Pets in a Property when they are not allowed – and ending the Rental Contract: If the Owner exercises their rights under paragraph 9.2, the Owner may end the Rental Contract in accordance with paragraph 12.\n\n9.4 Damage by pets, traces of pets – and extra charges: You will be responsible for all damage caused by your and/or your Guests' pets. For any pets allowed in the Property, you should remove all traces (inside and outside) from the Property of pet occupation before you and your Guests vacate the Property at the end of the Holiday Period. The Owner may make an additional, reasonable charge for professional cleaning after your Holiday Period due to any pets that have stayed at the Property.\n\n9.5 Pet rules: You must not allow pets on beds or on furniture within the Property. Pets must not be left alone in the Property (which include the garden and any outside areas) at any time.\n\n9.6 Breaking the pet rules and ending the Rental Contract: If you break the terms of paragraphs 9.4 or 9.5, the Owner (or their representative or us on their behalf) may notify you that you have broken those terms and if you continue to do so may end the Rental Contract and require you and your Guests to leave the Property before the end of the Holiday Period.\n\n9.7 Registered assistance dogs: Registered assistance dogs are allowed in all Properties featured on our Site, even where the property description states that pets are not allowed, provided that you comply with the provisions in paragraph 9.4. You must notify us of the intended presence of any assistance dogs before Booking so that we may make the Owner aware of this.\n\n9.8 Allergy to animals: If you or your Guests have an allergy to animals, please be aware that we and Owners cannot guarantee that an assistance dog, or other animals, have not stayed in a particular Property recently. We, and the Owners, cannot accept responsibility for any health condition which may occur as a result of any animals having been present in a Property. It is your responsibility to make specific enquiries before making a Booking through us if you or your Guests have an allergy.\n\n10 AMENDING, CANCELLING OR TRANSFERING A BOOKING AFTER A BOOKING CONFIRMATION\n\n10.1 Amending a Booking after the Booking Confirmation: If you would like to amend your Booking after the Booking Confirmation, please contact us directly using the contact details in paragraph 21. We will contact the Owner to see if the Owner agrees but we cannot guarantee that the Owner will agree to meet your request. The Owner may or may not agree.\n\n10.1.1 If the Owner does not agree, please remember that it is up to the Owner and we act only as the Owner’s agent. Your contract is with the Owner.\n\n10.1.2 If an Owner does agree to amend the Booking, there may additional charges and an administration charge. The additional charges may be due to the Owner under the Rental Contract (which could occur, for example, if your Booking has been amended for a more expensive or longer Holiday Period) or due to us under the Booking Contract (for example, to cover our costs of making the amendment). However, we will always notify you of these charges in advance and you will be responsible to pay them. If there are charges due to the Owner we will collect them, as usual on behalf of the Owner.\n\n10.2 Cancelling a Booking after you receive your Booking Confirmation because you have changed your mind: If you change your mind after you receive your Booking Confirmation:\n\n10.2.1 you are not entitled to cancel the Booking Contract for a particular Booking and obtain a refund for the Booking Fee as we will already have supplied the Booking Services to you for that particular Booking;\n\n10.2.2 if you wish to cancel the Rental Contract with the Owner more than 6 weeks before the start of the Holiday Period, you will be entitled to a refund of the Rental Charges you have paid minus: (i) the Deposit (excluding any Third Party Other Services Charges which you may or may not be entitled to a refund of pursuant to your arrangements with the relevant third party); and (ii) all reasonably incurred charges for any other services that the Owner provided to you up to the date you cancelled the Rental Contract; and\n\n10.2.3 you do not have a right to cancel the Rental Contract with the Owner 6 weeks or less before the start of the Holiday Period. You may, however have the right to end the Rental Contract in accordance with paragraph 11, under which you may be entitled to a refund for any Rental Charges you have paid. You may also be entitled to a refund of the Booking Fee, Sykes Other Services Charges and/or Third Party Other Services Charges payable under the Booking Contract in certain situations in accordance with paragraph 11.\n\n10.3 Transferring a Booking after a Booking Confirmation: You may not transfer your Rental Contract or a Booking Contract to another person. If you do not stay at the Property during the Holiday Period but your Guests do, you will still be legally responsible for all your obligations under the Rental Contract and these Booking Terms and your Guests' compliance with them. Please see paragraph 7.4 for more details.\n\n11 YOUR RIGHTS TO END A RENTAL CONTRACT\n\n11.1 Your rights to end a Rental Contract other than where you change your mind (as outlined in paragraph 10.2): You may immediately end a Rental Contract:\n\n11.1.1 if the Owner has committed a serious breach of its obligations to you as set out in these Booking Terms;\n\n11.1.2 if we or an Owner have told you about a material error in the charges or Booking Details or a significant error in the description of the Rental Services relating to your Booking and you notify us that you do not wish to proceed; or\n\n11.1.3 if we notify you about a change to the Total Charges due to changes in the applicable exchange rate and you notify us that you do not wish to proceed in accordance with paragraph 5.2.\n\n11.2 What refunds you are entitled to if you end a Rental Contract in these circumstances: If you end a Rental Contract for any of the reasons in paragraph 11.1.1 then within 14 days of the date you notify us that you wish to end the Rental Contract for these reasons the Owner will refund to you (which we shall try and facilitate acting as the Owner’s agent) the Rental Charges that you have already paid for the Booking and the amount equivalent to the Booking Fee, the Sykes Other Services Charges (excluding any low deposit charge you have made directly to us) and Third Party Other Services Charges that you have already paid for the Booking.\n\n11.3 If you end a Rental Contract for any of the reasons in paragraph 11.1.2 then within 14 days of the date you notify us that you wish to end the Rental Contract for these reasons:\n\n11.3.1 depending on who is at fault for the error, either we or the Owner will refund you (and we shall try and facilitate this acting as the Owner’s agent) any of the Rental Charges, Sykes Other Services Charges and Third Party Other Services Charges you have paid and any other amounts paid by you for the Booking under paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 less the amount under paragraph 11.3.2; and\n\n11.3.2 although it has nothing to do with your Rental Contract, depending on who is at fault for any error, either we will refund the Booking Fee in these circumstances or the Owner will refund you an amount equivalent to the Booking Fee in these circumstances.\n\n11.4 If you end a Rental Contract for any of the reasons in paragraph 11.1.3 then within 14 days of the date you notify us that you wish to end the Rental Contract for these reasons the Owner will refund to you (which we shall try and facilitate acting as the Owner’s agent) any of the Rental Charges you have paid less any costs the Owners have reasonably incurred in providing you with the Rental Services up to the date of termination.\n\n11.5 Your consumer rights: You have certain legal rights as a consumer under the law and nothing in these Booking Terms, a Rental Contract, a Booking Contract or your Booking affects these legal rights. Advice about your legal rights in relation to the services we and Owners provide is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. For detailed information please visit the Citizens Advice website www.adviceguide.org.uk or call 03454 04 05 06.\n\n12 OUR AND OWNERS’ RIGHTS TO CANCEL YOUR BOOKING OR END A RENTAL CONTRACT\n\n12.1 Our and Owners’ rights to end a Booking or Rental Contract (no refund): Without affecting any other right or remedy available to us or an Owner, an Owner (or we, on an Owner’s behalf) may cancel your Booking or bring to an end a Rental Contract if:\n\n12.1.1 you do not make any payment when it is due and you still do not make payment within 7 days of the date your payment is due (though we will send you a reminder that your payment is due);\n\n12.1.2 you do not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information, including any Booking Details, that is necessary for us to provide Booking Services or Sykes Other Services or for a relevant third party to provide the Third Party Other Services or for the Owner to provide the Rental Services;\n\n12.1.3 you fail to perform or comply with any of your obligations (when we consider your failure to be serious or important) contained in the Rental Contract, the Booking Contract or these Booking Terms, including if:\n\n12.1.3.1 you or your Guests do not comply with the obligations set out in paragraph 7;\n\n12.1.3.2 you do not comply with the applicable rules on pets in accordance with paragraph 9; or\n\n12.1.3.3 you fail to pay any good housekeeping bond on the date that payment of the bond is due in accordance with paragraph 4.12; or\n\n12.1.4 you are declared bankrupt, make any arrangement with or for the benefit of your creditors, are unable to pay your debts or have a county court administration order made against you.\n\n12.2 Consequences if a Booking or Rental Contract ends in the circumstances of paragraph 12.1: If a Booking or Rental Contract ends for any of the reasons in paragraph 12.1, then you will not be entitled to any refund of any Total Charges or other charges that you have paid in connection with your Booking. Also, neither we nor the Owner shall be responsible for any other costs or expenses you have to pay due to this (such as the cost of finding any alternative accommodation or making alternative travel arrangements).\n\n12.3 Our and an Owner’s rights to end a Booking/ Rental Contract (as applicable) (refund): Without affecting any other right or remedy available to us or an Owner, we or we on an Owner’s behalf (as applicable) may cancel your Booking or bring to an end a Rental Contract if:\n\n12.3.1 we have ended our agency agreement with the relevant Owner before your Booking for the relevant Property was made;\n\n12.3.2 we become aware of any health and safety or quality-related issue with the applicable Rental Services or Property or its immediate surroundings (for example contamination to the Property's water supply).\n\nThe Owner may still be liable to us for cancellation charges in these circumstances if the Owner is at fault (as this shall not be deemed an Owner’s right to cancel in accordance the Rental Contract without the need to pay us any cancellation charges), but this does not concern you, and you have no responsibility for such charges.\n\n12.4 Consequences if a Booking or Rental Contract ends in the circumstances of paragraph 12.3: If a Booking or Rental Contract ends for any of the reasons in paragraph 12.3, we:\n\n12.4.1 may (but are not obliged to) arrange alternative accommodation for you and your Guests of an equivalent type and standard in a similar location. We will not be responsible for any costs associated with arranging alternative accommodation and arranging this may be subject to the payment of additional charges by you if the Total Charges for the alternative are higher than those actually available to you under the cancelled Booking (which might not be all of the Total Charges under the cancelled booking – see 12.4.2 below). We will always get your approval in advance of arranging any alternative accommodation and notify you of the additional costs; and\n\n12.4.2 will try and facilitate the payment of a refund from the relevant Owner of the Rental Charges, or if the Owner is in breach as regards the cancellation, the Rental Charges and any other amounts paid by you under paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 in relation to the cancelled Booking, that in both instances the Owner may be liable for. Please note, in these circumstances you will not be able to recover the Booking Fee as this amount is non-refundable (we would have already completed the Booking Services for your original Booking) or the charges for Sykes Other Services that we have performed or for any Third Party Other Services that a third party has performed from us.\n\n13 EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR OR THE OWNER’S REASONABLE CONTROL\n\n13.1 Force majeure leading to cancellation: We, acting on the Owner’s behalf, and the Owner have a right, to end the Rental Contract and cancel your Booking if an event occurs beyond your, our or the Owner’s reasonable control (which is what we call an “Unexpected Event”). Examples of Unexpected Events include any law, guidance or action taken by a national or local government or public authority or any consequences of them; a fire or accident; epidemic or pandemic; act of God, flood, adverse weather conditions or other natural disaster, or any other event of any nature which prevents or is likely to prevent:\n\n13.1.1 you and your Guests from staying at the Property for some or all of the Holiday Period; or\n\nfrom the Owner complying with its obligations under its Rental Contract with you.\n\n13.2 Alternatives after such a cancellation: If an Unexpected Event happens that results in your Booking or Rental Contract being cancelled by us on the Owner’s behalf or by an Owner, you may select one of the following alternative options:\n\n13.2.1 as part of our Booking Services under our Booking Contract with you, we will try and help arrange alternative accommodation for you and your Guests of an equivalent type and standard in a similar location. However, we will not be responsible for any costs associated with arranging alternative accommodation and arranging this may be subject to the payment of additional charges by you if the Total Charges for the alternative are higher than those actually available to you under the cancelled Booking. We will always get your approval in advance of arranging any alternative accommodation and notify you of the additional costs; or\n\n13.2.2 the Owner will refund you the Rental Charges minus any cost and expense the Owners have reasonably incurred in providing you with the Rental Services up to the date of termination. Acting as the Owner’s agent, we will try and facilitate this refund to you from the Owner.\n\n13.3 Notification of options: If an Unexpected Event occurs, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible after we are aware of it and inform you of the available options.\n\n13.4 Consequences after an option has been provided: After providing you with your preferred option under paragraph 13.2, we and the applicable Owner shall have no further responsibility to you in relation to your original Booking.\n\n14 OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF A RENTAL CONTRACT ENDING FOR WHATEVER REASON\n\n14.1 Consequences of a Rental Contract ending: If the Rental Contract ends during or at the end of the Holiday Period, you must:\n\n14.1.1 leave the Property together with all Guests as soon as possible;\n\n14.1.2 notify the Owner (or their representatives) and us that you and your Guests have left the Property and, if relevant, the reasons for doing so; and\n\n14.1.3 return the keys/access cards to the location instructed by the Owner.\n\n14.2 Consequences of your decision to leave the Property before the end of the Holiday Period: If you leave the Property before the end of the Holiday Period of your own accord (and not due to an Unexpected Event or because you have ended the Rental Contract with one of your rights under paragraph 11.1) no refunds for any charges are payable.\n\n15 INSURANCE\n\n15.1 Some important advice: You are strongly advised to take out travel insurance with a reputable provider before booking to cover your Booking. If you do not do this then you are strongly advised at least to take out travel insurance with a reputable provider before departing for your holiday. Any insurance should ideally cover you for the total cost of your Booking (and your stay if that is different). It is your responsibility to check that your insurance cover is sufficient for your own purposes and any likely risks that may affect you or your holiday.\n\n17 OWNERS' LIABILITY\n\n17.1 What Owners are always responsible for: An Owner does not exclude or limit in any way their responsibility to you where it would be unlawful to do so.\n\n17.2 An Owner’s responsibility is limited to ‘foreseeable’ losses: Where an Owner is responsible to you, they shall not be responsible to you for any losses unless they are a ‘foreseeable’ consequence of the Owner’s failure to comply with a term of the Rental Contract. Losses are ‘foreseeable’ where they were contemplated by the Owner at the time we sent you a Booking Confirmation.\n\n17.3 Personal Belongings and Injury: You acknowledge that personal belongings and vehicles (together with their contents) belonging to you and your Guests are left at the Property entirely at your and their own risk. An Owner accepts no liability for any loss, damage or injury to you or your Guests, or your or their personal property during the Holiday Period, except to the extent such loss, damage or injury is caused by the Owner’s negligence.\n\n18 PRIVACY POLICY AND COOKIE POLICY\n\n18.1 Privacy Policy: We take your privacy very seriously. Please read our Privacy Policy to see how we use your personal information, including the information you submit about yourself when making a Booking. By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to our use of that information in the ways described in our Privacy Policy, including sharing your information with Owners for the purposes of their provision of the Rental Services.\n\n18.2 Cookie Policy: Like many online services we use a feature called a 'cookie', which is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device's hard drive. References in these Booking Terms to 'cookies' also include other means of automatically accessing or storing information on your access device. By accessing the Site and/or entering into a Booking Contract with us, you are providing your consent for us to use cookies in the ways described in our Cookie Policy. However, you may delete any of these cookies at any time if you wish - please see our Cookie Policy for detailed information on the types of cookies we use on the Site, the purposes for which we use each cookie, how you can disable and enable the use of certain cookies and the consequences of doing so.\n\n18.3 Recording telephone calls: We may record telephone calls between us for monitoring and training purposes. If there is a dispute between us, we reserve the right to review any recorded calls between us and to use those recording in the process of that dispute.\n\n19 COMPLAINTS\n\n19.1 Complaints generally: If you have any complaint please contact us by telephone or using our relevant contact details that we’ve provided on the Site promptly. If the complaint:\n\n19.1.1 is about the Booking Services, Sykes Other Services or Third Party Other Services, we shall deal with it on our own behalf as it relates to the Booking Contract between you and us; or\n\n19.1.2 is about the Rental Services or the Property, we shall deal with it on behalf of the Owner, as the Owner’s agent – and sometimes we may need to refer it back to the Owner directly or take instruction from the Owner – because the complaint relates to the Rental Contract between you and the Owner. In that case:\n\n19.1.2.1 Complaints while at the Property: If you are still staying at the Property and wish to make a complaint about a Property or Rental Service, we would suggest that in the first instance you contact the relevant Owner (or the Owner’s representative locally) as soon as possible (and during the Holiday Period) because your Rental Contract is directly with the Owner (and not us). This will give you and the Owner the best opportunity to resolve your complaint during the Holiday Period (and will hopefully assist in any issue, loss or damage either not being suffered or it being reduced) and we encourage all Owners to take complaints from holidaymakers seriously and to do their best to resolve them, where possible during the Holiday Period.\n\n19.1.2.2 If you are dissatisfied with how an Owner deals with your complaint or wish to contact us directly: If having complained to an Owner during the Holiday Period, you still wish to direct any complaint to us and/or are dissatisfied with the Owner's response to any complaint directly to the Owner, please contact us as soon as possible (and if you can within 7 days of the end of the Holiday Period for the relevant Booking, though if you fail to do so this will not limit your ability to make a complaint) with full details of your complaint and the Owner’s response (if any). Though please note, you must provide us with evidence of your complaint (including photographs), which shows us that the Owner had not complied with its obligations under these Booking Terms. For example, you must provide us with photographic evidence which we can identify as showing the Property failing to comply with paragraph 8.1.4 at the start of your Holiday Period. This will help us to deal with your complaint on behalf of the Owner as quickly and effectively as possible and to deal with it as follows: We will use our reasonable efforts to contact an Owner on your behalf to attempt to facilitate a resolution of your complaint by the Owner. As we act only as an agent for the Owner, we cannot accept any legal responsibility for your complaint. If we help to sort out a complaint, we are doing so as an agent only and have no legal responsibility to you for any refund or compensation; but we will try and persuade the Owner to act reasonably.\n\n19.2 Your legal rights: Nothing in this Complaints paragraph 19 affects your legal rights or any right you may have to bring legal proceedings against an Owner under a Rental Contract.\n\n20 OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS\n\n20.1 Electronic communications: You agree to receive communications from us and Owners electronically and that electronic communications will satisfy any legal requirement for communications to be in writing. Where these Booking Terms say something is ‘in writing’ or similar, it includes by email.\n\n20.2 Transferring Rental Contract and Booking Contract: An Owner may transfer his rights and obligations under the Rental Contract to a purchaser of the Owner’s Property (New Owner) or to a member of the same group of companies as itself (Owner Group Company). The New Owner or Owner Group Company (as applicable), and not the Owner, will be responsible for performing the Owner’s rights and obligations under the Rental Contract from the date of transfer. We may transfer our rights and obligations under the Booking Contract to a member of the same group of companies as ourselves (Sykes Group Company). The Sykes Group Company, and not us, will be responsible for performing our rights and obligations under the Booking Contract from the date of transfer. Any transfer of this nature that would be detrimental to you is not permitted unless you agree otherwise. We will inform you of all transfers of this nature. This may include us issuing you with a revised Rental Contract on behalf of a New Owner or revised Booking Contract. The only difference between the original Rental Contract or Booking Contract and the new Rental Contract or Booking Contract is the person your contract is with i.e. it is the New Owner, Owner Group Company or Sykes Group Company rather than the Owner or us (as applicable).\n\nWe or an Owner may transfer our rights and obligations under the Booking Contract or Rental Contract to a person or legal organisation who is not a New Owner, Owner Group Company or Sykes Group Company. We or the Owner will contact you to let you know if this is planned. If you are unhappy with the transfer, you may contact us or the Owner to end the relevant contract within 14 days of us or the Owner telling you about it and we or they (as applicable) will refund you any payments you have made in advance for services that have not been provided under the relevant contract. Please note though that this refund will not include our Booking Fee which will be non-refundable as we will have already completed the Booking Services, our charges for the Sykes Other Services that we have performed or any charges for Third Party Other Services that are subject to your agreement(s) with a third party.\n\nYou have no similar rights to transfer a contract (see paragraph 10.3).\n\n20.3 No third party rights: Each Booking Contract for the provision of the Booking Services and Sykes Other Services is between you and us. Each Rental Contract is between the you and the relevant Owner. Each contract for Third Party Other Services is between you and the third party providing those services. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of the terms of each respective contract.\n\n20.4 Separate paragraphs: Each of the paragraphs of these Booking Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.\n\n20.5 Waiting to enforce a right: If we or an Owner do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Booking Terms, or if we or an Owner delay in taking steps against you in respect of you breaking a term of a Booking Contract or Rental Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us or an Owner (as applicable) taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but continue to provide the Sykes Other Services, then we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.\n\n20.6 The law that applies to all this: Any Booking Contract and Rental Contract (and all the relevant Booking Terms within them) are governed by English law.\n\n20.7 If you, we or an Owner ever need to go to court: You can bring legal proceedings in respect of any Booking Contract or Rental Contract in the English courts. If you live in Scotland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of any Booking Contract or Rental Contract in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of any Booking Contract or Rental Contract in either the Northern Irish or the English courts. If you are domiciled in a country of the European Union (such the Republic of Ireland) you can bring legal proceedings in respect of any Booking Contract or Rental Contract in either the courts of the EU country where you are domiciled or the English courts.\n\n20.8 Resolving disputes without going to court: Alternative dispute resolution is where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and aims to settle it, without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we or an Owner has handled any complaint, you may want to contact an alternative dispute resolution provider. In respect of disputes concerning ourselves (and not those between you and an Owner), we are a subscriber to the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR), an independent charity which is approved by the CAA, Chartered Trading Standards Institute, the Gambling Commission and Ofcom to provide dispute resolution for disputes between customers and businesses. CEDR can provide the customers of travel businesses with access to legally binding arbitration, provided the dispute is considered to be within scope of matters that they can arbitrate on. You can view the details of what CEDR can arbitrate about, and when to they can do this, by visiting their website: https://www.cedr.com/consumer/holidays/packageholidays/."
