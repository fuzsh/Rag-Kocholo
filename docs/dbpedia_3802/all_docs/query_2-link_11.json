They benefit from our attractive location, and are complemented by original features and pleasant gardens. We invest much of our time and money into designing attractive homes with quality kitchens and bathrooms, ensuring that you have all the character of a period building but are equipped with the amenities needed for modern living.\n\nWhen you rent a cottage from us, we do not sign you up and then forget about you. We constantly plan and implement modernisation, repairs and improvements. We also perform annual property health checks.\n\nWe are a family run business who own, manage and live on the Estate. We manage every step of the process through the one contact. We also use a notes system to record and keep track of all communications.\n\nWhen you rent a home from us, we do not forget and abandon you once you’re in. We have a set plan of constant modernisation and improvements for all of our homes to ensure that our tenants remain happy throughout their stay.\n\nAll of our cottage rentals are within the Estates boundary, and have been built over the last 600 years in a distinctive Estate style. They benefit from our attractive country location, have original features and pleasant gardens. We invest much of our time and money into designing attractive homes with quality kitchens and bathrooms.\n\nThrough our improvement and repairs process, your home will always feel warm and clean. From Revesby, you get the added value of being a part of a special community with great local services e.g. great schools, the village hall and pub.\n\nWe provide wonderful properties to rent in the Revesby area, and we’d love to hear from you if you’re interested in being one of our tenants.\n\nWe are a long standing traditional family owned and managed Estate. This gives you assurance of our financial stability – as we have been here for generations we are not going to sell your home. We have a great relationship with all of our tenants, as reflected by the length of time they stay with us.\n\nAll information relating to tenancies and tenants is security stored within the Estate Office. Our local area and community has a very low crime and antisocial behaviour rate, making it a safe location to live in.\n\nCosts do rise and inflation takes place, so rent increases are inevitable. We believe the mechanism of rent increases should be transparent at the start of a tenancy. We increase by small increments on a cycle as opposed to large jumps."
