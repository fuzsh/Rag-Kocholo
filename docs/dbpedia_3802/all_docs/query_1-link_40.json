But there’s also a romance to this work,\" says Lisa Calvo, owner of Sweet Amalia Oyster Farm.\n\nFor three decades, most recently with Rutgers University, Lisa studied shellfish pathology, helping to develop oysters resistant to disease. As a side hustle, she launched Sweet Amalia, which was named for her daughter, who, as a toddler, would slurp oysters straight off the reef. The project began as a learning laboratory for studying aquaculture so that Calvo might better assist other farmers, but, a couple of years ago, it became her full-time occupation. Now, on a six-acre, intertidal plot located off of Route 47, Calvo and her team harvest approximately 3,000 oysters per season.\n\nExperience the world of oyster farming firsthand with a deluxe getaway in Cape May that pairs hard work with fine tastes. On the storied banks of the Delaware Bay, you'll receive a shucking lesson and an oyster tasting led by Sweet Amalia's experienced oyster farmers. And, to round out your stay in Cape May, you'll enjoy a world-class dinner in the Ebbitt Room that incorporates tide-to-table oyster recipes from Chef Jason Hanin.\n\nIncluded in your stay:\n\nDeluxe Overnight Accommodations at The Virginia Hotel or The Beach Plum Farm Cottages\n\nAn In-Depth Tour and Hands-On Oyster Shucking Lesson at Sweet Amalia Oyster Farm\n\nAn Oyster Tasting and Picnic Lunch at Sweet Amalia Oyster Farm\n\nA Delicious Dinner in the Virginia's private Richmond Room on Tuesday evening, featuring a themed menu prepared by Executive Chef Jason Hanin\n\nAll transportation provided to and from Sweet Amalia Oyster Farm\n\nReserve Your Stay\n\nSeptember Package\n\nPackage available:\n\nMonday, September 16 through Wednesday, September 18, 2024\n\nBook The Virginia Hotel Book The Beach Plum Farm Cottages Call: (855) 290-8467\n\nOctober Package\n\nPackage available:\n\nMonday, October 28 through Wednesday, October 30, 2024\n\nBook The Virginia Hotel Book The Beach Plum Farm Cottages Call: (855) 290-8467\n\nThe Holiday Home\n\nAvailable Friday, November 8 through Tuesday, December 10, 2024\n\nA guided candle and wreath-making décor experience, immersed in the holiday magic of our farm.\n\nBeautiful décor is at the heart of Beach Plum Farm’s holiday magic.
