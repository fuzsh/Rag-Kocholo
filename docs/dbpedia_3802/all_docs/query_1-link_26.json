We never charge you more than you would pay to book directly on the supplier site and if you become a Last Minute Cottages member, you can save even more, which means you’ll always pay the lowest price with us.\n\nHow can I book a property?\n\nWith live prices and availability, all of our properties are bookable online. We connect you with the best professionally managed properties, and our marketing leading customer service team can help you every step of the way.\n\nCan I book a short break?\n\nMany of our owners allow short stay bookings of 2, 3 or 4 nights. Depending on the property, short stays are available either throughout the year, though in peak periods such as summer break duration can be more restrictive. Any search on our site only shows bookable properties.\n\nDo you have properties with hot tubs?\n\nYes, we have over 15,000 properties across the UK with hot tubs that are instantly bookable online.\n\nWhat time can I check-in and when am I required to depart?\n\nCheck-in would usually be between 3pm to 4pm and check-out is usually at 10am. This will be confirmed on your final booking though.\n\nAre towels and linen provided?\n\nMost property owners will provide linen and towels at no extra cost. This is usually noted on the property description, although if this isn’t stated then just get in contact with us to check.\n\nWhat is your cancellation policy?\n\nAs we act as a marketplace advertising properties on behalf of property managers, this means the policy will change for each property manager. The cancellation cost can vary depending on the time of the cancellation."
