Those were all very nice to see. I collected Tibet actively about 15 years ago, and then, five years ago, sold the last of the best of them to a University of Michigan Chinese doctoral candidate at a coin show in Ann Arbor. He had a real jones, came by several shows in a row. I could not fault his eye. He knew the best pieces.

As a result of a different discussion on another kind of board entirely, I posted this to my blog:

A lot of new research has been published since Kann. If you are serious about the tangka itself or Tibet generally, more modern resources will meet your needs for accurate information. As always, make sure that your purchases are genuine: If you don't know your coin, know your dealer.
