        "text": "Tibet is a mysterious and beautiful place, and many people are attracted by its rich and colorful culture. However, most people do not understand the monetary system and use of this place.\n\nTibetan currency refers to currency originating in Tibet, minted in Tibet (except for a few exceptions), and circulating in Tibet and its surrounding Tibetan areas.\n\nAlthough the major historical events recorded in Tibetan coins took place in the historical stage of Tibet, they greatly overloaded the time and space of the plateau, directly or indirectly affecting China's overall interests and the country's diplomatic pattern. It is a concrete reflection of Tibet in the political context of China's unification, so it has richer connotations and far-reaching research value. It not only had a large number of very close ties with the Central Plains but also had direct and close ties with neighboring countries such as Nepal and India (then the East India Company). Many of these coins are the direct result of major historical events that took place within these countries.\n\nTibet Currency and History\n\nThe minting and issuance of Tibetan coins is not very long, from the 90s of the 18th century to the early 50s of the 20th century, the entire time span is only a short hundred years. However, it has left us with a very rich and precious historical and cultural heritage. The coin is an important physical basis for the political, economic, military, and cultural research of a country or region. There is no other currency in the world whose creation and demise are directly linked to the major historical events in the region as the Tibetan currency. Many of these varieties are direct products of the politics, economy, and military of that period. Almost all the major historical events in Tibet in modern times have been reflected in Tibetan coins. It is no exaggeration to say that the vast majority of Tibetan coins, behind each coin, have a rich history. Unlike other currencies, which are only a single economic function, Tibetan coins have been closely linked to many factors such as politics, economy, and military since its birth. And political and military needs far outweigh its economic attributes. Its history function is unmatched by other currencies. This is an extremely important feature of the collection of coins and an important aspect of the potential value of the collection. Tibet cannot find a second physical form that can systematically and richly record Tibet's modern history like Tibetan currency.\n\nThe renminbi replaces the Tibetan currency\n\nThe integrity of the People's Republic of China's monetary sovereignty and the unification of the monetary system were fully and thoroughly realized only when Tibetan currency was abolished, foreign currency and silver dollars were banned, and the renminbi system was established. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the central authorities have prudently and steadily handled the issue of Tibetan currency in light of the special and complicated nature of Tibet, from allowing Tibetan currency to continue to circulate without collecting or paying for it, gradually weakening it, to changing the Qamdo area from using silver dollars to a mixed circulation market for renminbi and silver dollars, suspending Tibet's currency reform, until collecting and exchanging Tibetan currency, banning foreign currency and silver dollars, and establishing the renminbi as the standard currency of Tibet. The renminbi has replaced the Tibetan currency, strengthened ties between Tibet and the motherland's hinterland, and provided a certain economic foundation for preparations for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nTibet's monetary system and coin usage\n\nThe currencies of Tibet are mainly the renminbi and Tibetan currency. Tibetan currency refers to the currency issued by the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, which is divided into four denominations: 1 yuan, 5 Mao, 2 Mao, and 1 Mao. Unlike the renminbi, the back of the Tibetan coin is printed in Tibetan, and at the same time, the circulation and circulation area of the Tibetan coin are relatively small, so it is still relatively inconvenient to use.\n\nAs an ethnic minority region, Tibet's currency use is naturally influenced by ethnic culture. In Tibet, there is a unique and ancient way of trading called \"exchanging specialties\", that is, exchanging special products for the goods you need. In some remote areas, this form of trading still exists and is considered a cherished cultural tradition by Tibetans.\n\nIn daily life, the use of money in Tibet also shows some characteristics. For example, in some cities and regions in Tibet, especially tourist areas, some shops, and tourist attractions will have some tip boxes, and tourists can put bits and pieces of banknotes or coins into it as a token of gratitude. At the same time, due to historical reasons, Tibetans' pursuit of gold and silver jewelry is also very high, and many Tibetans will choose to exchange gold and silver directly when buying gold and silver jewelry. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in ancient Tibetan areas.\n\nOverall, Tibet's use of currency is relatively special, reflecting the unique and colorful cultural traditions of the region. By gaining an in-depth understanding of Tibet's monetary system and usage, you can better feel the charm and history of this place."
