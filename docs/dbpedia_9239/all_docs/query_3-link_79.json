        "text": "1The “Forum der Völker” in Werl, Germany was founded by the Franciscan order. It hosts the largest ethnological museum in Westphalia and at the same time the largest ethnological collection of a missionary society in Germany, with substantial colonial and postcolonial holdings from Asia and Oceania. After the Franciscans left their convent in Werl, the museum has been closed since 2019. In 2023, I pursued initial provenance research funded by the German Lost Art Foundation DZK (Deutsches Zentrum für Kulturgutverluste) that allowed paradigmatic insights into the collection strategies of a proselytizing order and into the entanglement histories of the collected objects. This article focuses on the provenance of artefacts from China assembled between 1903 and 1953 and objects from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea of the early post-colonial period. I aim to reveal the acquisition circumstances of objects and the associated strategies of appropriation of a Christian mission.\n\n3My provenance research was carried out using an interdisciplinary approach. I examined the museum’s documentation material and visual sources. In addition to this archival and source-critical historic approach, I pursued an ethnologically oriented methodology through surveys and interviews in order to generate information about the various actors involved. Likewise, an art-historical approach using iconological and stylistic methods helped to collect object-related provenance characteristics. Labels, inventory numbers or price tags provided information on auctions, market value or former ownership whereas signatures, marks, material, working techniques or other stylistic characteristics allude to the producer and add regional or chronological information. This initial provenance research (Erstcheck) in a missionary museum lays the foundation for possible more in-depth provenance research and offers an orientation in how to deal with objects of problematic provenance in a missionary context.\n\n5In 1983, with the reopening and extension of the museum building in Werl, various collections of Franciscan monasteries of the Netherlands and Germany as well as donations from private collectors were incorporated, aided by new acquisitions. The regional scope of the museum expanded and countries from four continents were represented with a new didactic concept. Today, the ethnographic collection consists of around 15,200 objects, in addition to a collection of 3,186 coins and early currency as well as more than 47,000 visual sources, mainly assembled in the mission territories of the German and Dutch Franciscan order. Between 1983 and 2019, the museum director Fr Reinhard Kellerhoff (1924–2022) expanded the collection while creating a centre for intercultural encounter (Reinking, 1989; Kellerhoff, 1999, 2012).\n\nMateriality as a sensitive object category\n\nContexts of appropriation in China, 1903–1953\n\n17In order for provenance researchers to critically illuminate the background behind the missionaries’ collecting activities of China objects, more archival work would be needed in order to evaluate the contexts of acquisitions case by case, such as an in-depth study of the order’s publications, the missionaries’ personal letters, a review of the image archives in Paderborn, where the Franciscan archive is located, and in the large visual collection in the museum of Werl as well as consulting the recording of the museum.\n\nPrivate collections endowed to the missionaries\n\n20The same collector also donated several religious statues from Thailand and Cambodia to the museum. If proven authentic, this cultural heritage of Southeast Asia also holds significant cultural and religious value for the countries of origin. During the political instability between the 1970s and 1990s in Cambodia, many of these artefacts were looted and transferred to other countries (Phalravy, 2024). More investigations on this stock of Buddhist images might reveal critical provenance backgrounds.\n\n21The museum in Werl served as a heritage keeper for non-European objects in the Westphalian region. Most often the provenance of bequests from private collectors, among them colonial-period administrators and military, is not known. Three examples from problematic contexts may demonstrate. In 1990, the museum director accessed a bow from Oceania owned by Adalbert Heppner (?–1917), an admiral of the Hohenzollern shipyard. In 2001, the director also acquired the bequest of photos and art works of the naval ship machinist Hermann Stilcke (1882–1962), including an ink pen with lion carving, silk, statuettes, clothing accessories, jewellery, paintings, and vessels made of porcelain or metal. In 1911, Stilcke was on board of the German gunboat Iltis II to China and he took a picture of the vivid art trafficking on the ship (Geilich, 2006, pp. 206–210). He obtained artefacts from China as souvenirs; the context of others such as a “sacred water vessel” seems sensitive. The image collection of the museum also consists of the sensitive holding of a photo album from around 1900–1905 compiled by prison chief guard Curt Arthur Tzschabran (1877–1936) who probably joined the Boxer War. The album shows German military personnel in China, the building of the German railway line and an execution. Four men are being beheaded, guarded by British and Japanese soldiers. Either Fr Kellerhoff did not know about the circumstances of these holdings or took these collectables without critical investigations.\n\nSummary: Missionary collections and restitution initiatives\n\n22In the article, I have addressed objects, in particular ritual implements or religious arts, which were transferred to a Christian context by reinterpreting them as counter-images for the missionary task in terms of their so-called civilizing mission. Examples in the article reveal that Catholic missionaries commodified devices of local worship and showed an ambivalence towards human remains and weapons. I have referred to unclear changes of ownership, power relations and potentially sensitive contexts that demonstrate an extremely complex and ambivalent relationship between proselytizing actors and the proselytized societies. Some objects, partly donated by private collectors, were taken via looting, art and antiquities theft or just without permission.\n\n23Ethnographic missionary collections would pave the way to initiate collaborative museum work with the communities of origin in order to initiate dialogue and communication on their material culture (cf. Scholz, 2021). The renewed understanding of mission in the Catholic Church following the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965 makes partnership-based cooperation likely today. First, it has to be clarified whether objects were obtained in sensitive contexts, were looted or taken without permission. Second, it has to be investigated if some objects stored in the mission collection have any significance for the communities of origin. Processes of reassessment and the search for tradition must also be taken into account, which often form the basis for negotiations in restitution processes. I therefore argue that direct contact with the communities of origin should be established proactively, arranged through the local Catholic churches in this region that emerged from the missions."
