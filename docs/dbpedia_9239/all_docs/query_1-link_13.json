        "text": "The use of money in China could be traced back to at least four thousand years ago. China was also the first country to use paper money, or credit currency in the world. Due to the difficult of language and communication, it is not an easy thing for me to study the numismatic history of Tibit. Tibit as a part of Chinese family of nationality, but paper money was only introduced into this minority nationality area in the early 20th century. I posted below is a Tibet 100 Tam Srang Note. This note is believed to be printed in 1937 and it was printed by Cha-Hsi Motor Plant or Cha-Hsi Le-K'ung Mint [The Lhasa Mint of the Tibet Local Government], and or known as the Trabshi Lekhung by Western.\n\nNote:\n\nAccording to the books of \"A Study of Tibetan Paper Money with a Critical Bibliography\" by Mr. Wolfgang Berisch. Only 50,000 notes with the denomination in \"Tam Srang\" (with the red octogonal seal which was usually used on the earlier issues of Tam notes) were issued. After 50,000 notes of 100 Tam Srang had been issued, the denomination was changed to \"srang\". A different red seal and some changes in the design of the obverse of thenotes were introduced. Obverse\n\nThis note was printed by Cha-Hsi Motor Plant or Cha-Hsi Le-K'ung Mint [The Lhasa Mint of the Tibet Government] in 1937.\n\nIt is printed in red and yellow from blocks bearing various patterns on paper. [100 Tam Srang note needed to repeat printing for 13 times.] The red outer frame is ornated with the rhomboid patterns. The first inner frame is ornated with the common patterns, Symbol of eight good omens. The top left and bottom right corners of the inner frame are each ornated with the two black serial numbers filled in with a pen in Tibetan script for security. The top corners of the second inner frame of the note are ornated with the four Tibetan characters \"Tam Srang\" means tael whereas the two bottom vertices bear the Tibetan Numbers \"100\". Nine Tibetan text , meaning the \"Tibetan government is all victorious anywhere\", is printed horizontally across the top centre of the second inner frame in black. The row of Tibetan words , meaning the \"Government and Religion in one and the paper money valued at 100 Srang\" printed horizontally across the bottom centre of the second inner frame in black. Two lions are holding with a fruit bowl is printed at the centre of the note between two geometrical seals, Dalai Lama's red octogonal seal and Cha-Hsi Le-K'ung Mint black rectangular seal. [Please be noted that the later issued 100 srang notes, the red octogonal seal would be changed with a small red circular seal. The underprint with four rats pattern also would be changed later.]"
