        "text": "US Passed Resolve Tibet Act\n\nFor Prelims: China-Tibet Issue, India-China Relations, India-US Relations, Buddhism, Dalai Lama.\n\nFor Mains: Effect of Policies & Politics of Countries on India's Interests.\n\nSource: BS\n\nWhy in News?\n\nRecently, the US Congress passed the Promoting a Resolution to Tibet-China Dispute Act, also known as the Resolve Tibet Act.\n\nThis legislation aims to promote a peaceful resolution to the Tibet-China dispute according to international law and the United Nations (UN) Charter through peaceful dialogue without preconditions.\n\nWhat is the Resolve Tibet Act 2024?\n\nAbout:\n\nIt is a legislation passed by the United States Congress in June 2024.\n\nIt is the third notable act by the US government regarding Tibet, following the Tibetan Policy Act (2002) and the Tibetan Policy & Support Act (2020).\n\nKey Provisions:\n\nIt aims to strengthen the US's position on Tibet and pressure China into resuming negotiations with the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Act aims to enhance US support for Tibet and empower US State Department officials to actively counter disinformation about Tibet from the Chinese government.\n\nThe Act will also push for negotiations \"without preconditions\" between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives or the democratically elected leaders of the Tibetan community.\n\nIt underlines the Tibetan people's right to self-determination and human rights, noting China's duty as a signatory of international human rights covenants.\n\nIt recognizes and addresses the distinct historical, cultural, religious, and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.\n\nIt also aims to empower the international community to stand up for justice and peace in Tibet.\n\nDifference with Earlier Acts:\n\nUnlike the 2002 act, which recognized China's claim over Tibet, the Resolve Tibet Act directly challenges this claim.\n\nThe 2002 act encouraged dialogue with the Dalai Lama, but only in his capacity as a spiritual leader, not as a political representative. In contrast, this Act urges China to engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his democratically elected representatives, without preconditions.\n\nThe Tibetan Policy & Support Act of 2020 also pushed for constructive dialogue, but the Resolve Tibet Act goes further by stating that these talks should aim to \"resolve differences\" between the parties.\n\nHow is India’s Relation with Tibet?\n\nThe Younghusband Mission (1903-1904): The British military expedition to Tibet, led by Colonel Younghusband, aimed to establish a British presence in the region and counter growing Russian influence.\n\nThis led to a conflict with Tibetan forces, culminating in the British victory and the signing of the Lhasa Convention of 1904.\n\nAnglo-Russian Convention (1907): This agreement aimed to settle outstanding colonial disputes between Colonial Britain and Russia.\n\nAccording to this agreement, two great powers would not negotiate with Tibet, except through the mediation of the Chinese government.\n\nIndia's Relationship with Tibet: Despite the Sino-Russian treaty, India maintained close ties with Tibet through the influence of Buddhism.\n\nThe spread of Buddhism from India to Tibet and the presence of influential Buddhist monasteries fostered strong cultural and religious connections between the two regions.\n\nThe Indo-Tibetan Border: The Sino-Indian border dispute, particularly in the Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh regions, has been a major point of contention between India and China.\n\nThe status of Tibet and its historical relationship with India have been central to this ongoing dispute, with both countries claiming sovereignty over the disputed territories.\n\nIndia’s Stand on Tibet: Since 2003, India has recognised Tibet Autonomous Region as part of the People's Republic of China following the signing of the Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation between India and China.\n\nIn 1959, India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama after a failed uprising.\n\nWhat is the Background of the China-Tibet Dispute?\n\nTibet's Independence Claims:\n\nTibet is an autonomous region on the Tibetan Plateau, with a distinct culture, language, and religious tradition centred around Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nIn 1913, the 13th Dalai Lama announced Tibet's de facto independence after the fall of the Qing dynasty, claiming Tibet was never a part of China.\n\nHowever, successive Chinese governments, including the People's Republic of China (PRC) established in 1949, have consistently claimed sovereignty over Tibet.\n\nChinese Invasion and the Seventeen Point Agreement:\n\nFrom 1912 to 1949, Tibet was not under the control of any Chinese government, with the Dalai Lama's government ruling the region.\n\nIn 1951, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China invaded Tibet, and Tibetan leaders were forced to sign the Seventeen Point Agreement which nominally guaranteed Tibetan autonomy but allowed the establishment of Chinese civil and military headquarters in Lhasa (capital of Tibet).\n\nThe Tibetan people, including the Dalai Lama, have rejected the validity of this agreement, considering it a forced occupation and an act of \"cultural genocide.\"\n\n1959 Tibetan Uprising and Aftermath:\n\nIncreasing tensions between Tibet and China led to a major uprising in 1959, during which the Dalai Lama and thousands of Tibetans fled to India, seeking asylum.\n\nThe Tibetan exiles formed a government-in-exile, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), based in Dharamshala, India.\n\nSince the 1959 uprising, China has tightened its control over Tibet, severely restricting freedoms of speech, religion, and press, and engaging in human rights abuses such as forced abortions, sterilisations, and the demographic shift through the influx of ethnic Han Chinese.\n\nWhile China has invested in infrastructure development in Tibet, these efforts are widely seen as part of a larger strategy to consolidate its control over the region.\n\nDalai Lama\n\nTradition: The Dalai Lama belongs to the Gelugpa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the largest and most influential tradition in Tibet.\n\nHistory: There have been only 14 Dalai Lamas in the history of Tibetan Buddhism. The first and second Dalai Lamas received the title posthumously. The current Dalai Lama is Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th in the line.\n\nSpiritual Significance: Dalai Lamas are believed to be manifestations of Avalokiteshvara (Chenrezig), the Bodhisattva of Compassion and Tibet's patron saint.\n\nBodhisattvas are enlightened beings who aspire to achieve Buddhahood to benefit all sentient beings and vow to be reborn to help humanity.\n\nThe process to Choose the Dalai Lama:\n\nReincarnation Search: The process of selecting a Dalai Lama involves identifying the reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama, who serves as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism. The search typically begins after the passing of the incumbent Dalai Lama.\n\nHigh Lamas of the Gelugpa tradition and the Tibetan government are responsible for finding the next Dalai Lama. If multiple candidates are identified, a public ceremony involving the drawing of lots is held to determine the true successor.\n\nRecognition and Training: The selected child, usually very young, is recognised as the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and undergoes rigorous spiritual and educational training.\n\nRole: The Dalai Lama's role includes both spiritual and political leadership in Tibetan Buddhism. The selection process is crucial to Tibetan cultural and religious traditions.\n\nDuration: The search can take several years; for example, it took 4 years to find the current (14th) Dalai Lama.\n\nGeographical Scope: The search is generally limited to Tibet. However, the current Dalai Lama has suggested that he might not be reborn or, if he is, it would not be in a country under Chinese rule.\n\nWhat is the Global Stand on China-Tibet Issue?\n\nChina's Stance: China claims Tibet has been part of its territory since the 13th century and its policies aim to develop the region. It argues Tibet is an autonomous region with significant rights and accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking independence.\n\nChina has expressed concerns over the future selection of the Dalai Lama. It fears that the Dalai Lama's successor might be chosen to challenge its authority in Tibet.\n\nSupport for Tibetan Autonomy/ Independence: Some Western countries, like the US and Canada, have expressed support for Tibetan autonomy and human rights.\n\nThe Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), the Tibetan government-in-exile led by the Dalai Lama, is not recognized by the international community, including India.\n\nNon-Interference and Neutrality: Many countries, especially those with ties to China, maintain a neutral stance and prioritise diplomatic and economic cooperation with China.\n\nNeighbouring countries like Nepal and Bhutan take a cautious approach to avoid tensions with China.\n\nHuman Rights Concerns: International organisations including the United Nations (UN) have expressed concerns about human rights abuses in Tibet, including restrictions on religious freedom and cultural suppression.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Question (PYQ)\n\nPrelims:\n\nQ1.

These are businesses that produce, process, and preserve goods and commodities.\n\nClassification:\n\nMSME Regulation in India:\n\nThe Ministry of Small-Scale Industries and the Ministry of Agro and Rural Industries were merged in 2007 to form the Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises.\n\nThis ministry develops policies, facilitates programs, and monitors implementation to support MSMEs and aid in their growth.\n\nThe Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development Act of 2006 addresses various issues affecting MSMEs, establishes a National Board for MSMEs, defines the concept of \"enterprise,\" and empowers the Central Government to enhance MSME competitiveness.\n\nSignificance of the MSME Sector:\n\nGlobal:\n\nAccording to the United Nations data, MSMEs account for up to 90% of businesses, over 60% to 70% of jobs worldwide, and half of global GDP.\n\nIndia:\n\nGDP Contribution and Employment Generation: MSMEs currently contribute approximately 30% to India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), playing a crucial role in driving economic growth.\n\nAs per the data of Udyam registration portal, more than 46 million MSMEs (second only to China's 140 million) and over 200 million jobs are registered with the MSME Ministry.\n\nExport Promotion: Currently MSMEs contribute nearly 45% of India's total exports.\n\nThe Indian handicraft sector, which is dominated by small-scale artisans and enterprises, has a global market and generates significant export revenue for the country.\n\nContribution to Manufacturing Output: MSMEs contribute significantly to the country's manufacturing output, particularly in sectors like food processing, engineering, and chemicals.\n\nRural Industrialization and Inclusive Growth: MSMEs play a pivotal role in driving rural industrialisation and promoting inclusive growth.\n\nThe Khadi and Village industries sector, consisting of small-scale units, has been instrumental in providing employment opportunities in rural areas and empowering local communities.\n\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship: The MSME sector fosters innovation and entrepreneurship, as it is often easier for small businesses to adapt to changing market conditions and introduce new products or services.\n\nInternational MSME Day 2024\n\nIt is observed on 27th June annually to recognise the significance of MSMEs and their contribution to the economy.\n\nThe theme of MSME Day 2024:\n\nThe theme for MSME Day 2024 is “Leveraging Power and Resilience of Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) to Accelerate Sustainable Development and Eradicate Poverty in Times of Multiple Crises.”\n\nHistory and Significance:\n\nIn April 2017, the United Nations designated the 27th June as Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises Day.\n\nThe day aims to enhance national capacities for unleashing the full potential of MSMEs in achieving Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWhat are the Key Amendments Proposed in MSME Development Act, 2006?\n\nMSME Development Act, 2006: It provides a framework for the promotion and development of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the country.\n\nObjectives:\n\nFacilitating the promotion and development of MSMEs.\n\nEnhancing the competitiveness of MSMEs.\n\nProviding easy access to credit, marketing assistance, and other support services.\n\nPromoting entrepreneurship and skill development.\n\nKey Amendments Proposed:\n\nFaster Payment Resolutions: The Samadhan portal is proposed to upgrade from a grievance tracker to a full-fledged online dispute resolution platform for MSMEs.\n\nThis empowers MSMEs to file complaints, receive responses, and participate in mediation all online, expediting payments.\n\nStrengthened MSME Representation: The National Board for MSME will include representatives from all State Secretaries, fostering better policymaking that reflects ground realities and addresses MSME challenges across India.\n\nModernising the Act: The 2006 MSME Act requires updates to address contemporary issues like persistent delayed payments and the evolving support needs of MSMEs. Amendments aim to create a more responsive legal framework for their growth.\n\nWhat are the Key Initiatives Announced by the Ministry of MSME?\n\nMSME Trade Enablement & Marketing (TEAM) Initiative: It aims to facilitate the onboarding of 5 lakh micro and small enterprises onto the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC).\n\nThe government will provide financial assistance for onboarding, cataloguing, account management, logistics, packaging material, and design.\n\nHalf of the beneficiary MSEs will be women-owned enterprises.\n\nYashasvini Campaign: This is a series of mass awareness campaigns for formalising women-owned informal micro enterprises and providing capacity building, training, handholding, and mentorship to women-owned enterprises.\n\nThe campaigns will be organised by the Ministry of MSME in collaboration with other Central Ministries/Departments, State Governments, and Women Industry Associations, focusing on Tier 2 and 3 cities.\n\n6 Pillars for the Government's MSME Initiatives:\n\nBuilding a Stronger Foundation: This pillar focuses on formalising businesses and ensuring easier access to credit, vital for the growth and stability of MSMEs.\n\nExpanding Market Reach: The government aims to increase access to domestic and international markets for MSMEs, along with encouraging e-commerce adoption to expand their reach further.\n\nTechnological Transformation: This pillar emphasises leveraging modern technology to boost productivity and efficiency within the MSME sector.\n\nSkilling the Workforce: Enhancing skill levels and promoting digitalisation in the service sector are crucial for MSMEs to keep pace with the evolving market.\n\nGoing Global with Tradition: The government will support traditional industries like Khadi, Village, and Coir to help them compete in the global marketplace.\n\nEmpowering Entrepreneurs: This pillar prioritises fostering enterprise creation among women and artisans, promoting inclusive growth within the MSME sector.\n\nWhat are the Recent Government Initiatives Related to MSMEs?\n\nRaising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP) Scheme\n\nCredit Guarantee Trust Fund for Micro & Small Enterprises (CGTMSE)\n\nInterest Subsidy Eligibility Certificate (ISEC)\n\nA Scheme for Promoting Innovation, Rural Industry & Entrepreneurship (ASPIRE)\n\nCredit Linked Capital Subsidy for Technology Upgradation (CLCSS)\n\nZero Defect & Zero Effect (ZED)\n\nCHAMPIONS Portal\n\nWhat are the Challenges Faced by MSMEs?\n\nLimited Access to Finance and Credit: MSMEs often struggle to obtain formal financing and credit facilities, hindering their growth and expansion.\n\nOnly 16% of MSMEs have access to formal credit, leading many to rely on informal sources at higher costs.\n\nTechnological Deficiency: There is a significant lack of technological advancements and limited digital infrastructure, which restricts their ability to innovate and compete effectively.\n\nLimited access to research and development facilities and challenges in adopting Industry 4.0 technologies further hinder their competitiveness.\n\nMarket Access and Competition: MSMEs face limited market access and intense competition from large-scale enterprises, which undermines their market share and profitability.\n\nSkilled Labour Shortage: Acquiring skilled labour and managing talent is a persistent issue, affecting the quality and efficiency of operations.\n\nA report by Assocham estimates that India has a skills gap of 23 million workers, making it difficult for MSMEs to find qualified employees, which impacts productivity and innovation.\n\nEconomic Vulnerability: MSMEs are particularly vulnerable to economic downturns and market fluctuations, which can significantly impact their stability and growth prospects.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, around 21% of MSMEs in India permanently closed due to the economic impact, making them more vulnerable to economic downturns.\n\nRaw Material Shortage: MSMEs struggle with fluctuating raw material prices and limited financial capacity for bulk purchasing.\n\nThis is particularly challenging for small textile units, which often face difficulties with cotton price volatility, impacting their profit margins and competitiveness.\n\nIssues With Current Litigation System: The expensive legal process makes it hard for small businesses to seek justice.\n\nThe current system takes too long to resolve disputes, worsening the financial difficulties of small businesses.\n\nThe Samadhan portal only provides information for analysis and does not help directly resolve disputes.\n\nWay Forward\n\nFinancial Empowerment and Access: Enhance access to formal credit through targeted schemes, collateral relaxation, and promoting alternative financing options like venture capital, angel investors, and peer-to-peer lending platforms.\n\nDigital Transformation and Market Expansion: Impart digital literacy, and technical skills, facilitate e-commerce integration, subsidise investments in digital infrastructure, and establish linkages with large enterprises for subcontracting.\n\nRegulatory Reforms and Skilling: Simplify regulations, implement single window clearance systems, conduct regulatory impact assessments, launch targeted skill development programs aligned with industry needs, and promote entrepreneurship education at all levels.\n\nEstablish mentorship programs connecting successful entrepreneurs with inspiring MSME owners.\n\nInfrastructure, Risk Management, and Policy Awareness: Investing in developing reliable power, transportation, and communication infrastructure for MSMEs to thrive.\n\nDevelop risk management strategies like insurance schemes and encourage product/market diversification to improve resilience.\n\nGlobal Competitiveness and Quality Enhancement: Promoting the adoption of quality management systems, and developing export-oriented MSME
