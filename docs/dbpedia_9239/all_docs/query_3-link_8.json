        "text": "The 1954 film \"Rear Window\" has a scene where actress Grace Kelly is reading a book.\n\nGrace Kelly reading book\n\nThe book is Beyond the High Himalayas by William O. Douglas and published in 1952.\n\nI have an interest in old travel books and I obtained a copy from the usual source and read it.\n\nWilliam O. Douglas was a US Supreme Court Justice who liked to travel. In 1951 he spent some time in Ladakh, Northern India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.\n\nPart of his trip involved trekking in the Ladakh area and there he travelled with an Indian trip manager and with porters to carry the supplies.\n\nLadakh which was close to Tibet which Douglas could not visit as the country was closed to foreigners.\n\nOccasionally Douglas would discuss money and he mentions that (in 1951) an Indian rupee was worth US 20 cents and an Afghanistan rupee was worth US 30 cents.\n\nIn Ladakh he met refugees fleeing the Communist Chinese invasion of Tibet.\n\nIn one chapter Douglas describes a song sung by Tibetan women describing the currency inflation caused by the invaders:\n\nIn the religious city of Lhasa this year\n\nChinese soldiers have arrived like hail\n\nWhether as liberators it is in doubt\n\nOr to tie the throats of the poor\n\nFor things that formerly cost a tranka\n\nWe now pay a full do-tse\n\nSo let us dance!\n\nIn a footnote Douglas notes that a tranka was worth about US five cents and a do-tse about seventeen dollars.\n\nThe \"tranka\" had to be the Tibetan tangka but what was a \"do-tse\"?\n\nTibet had several forms of money at the time (1951) and English spellings of the Tibetan currency names varied.\n\nThere was the silver tangka and the silver srang.\n\nTibet Tangka, Silver, Undated\n\nBase Silver, 27 mm, 3.60 gm, probably minted 1912-25 at Dokde (Dodde Valley) near Lhasa\n\nTibet 1-1/2 Srang, Silver, 1937\n\nSilver, 23 mm, 5.65 gm, minted 1936-1946, date cycle 16 year 11 (AD 1937)\n\nA srang was worth about 6-2/3 or 6.667 tangka, thus a srang was worth about 33 US cents.\n\nI did find a couple of references to the \"do-tse\", it was not a coin but a unit of money. One reference mentioned that 40 do-tse is 2000 \"sang\" and another that 100 silver do-tse was 5000 \"sang\".\n\nThus a do-tse was worth 50 srang. 50 srang would then (1951) be worth around US $16.66, close to the seventeen dollars quoted by Douglas.\n\nThe unusual Tibetan coins and currency disappeared by the late 1950's when the Chinese authorities ordered the residents to use Chinese money."
