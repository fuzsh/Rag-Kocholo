        "text": "Tibet is located on the Tibetan plateau of Central Asia. It is known as 'the Land of Snows' or 'the Rooftop of the World'. To the West, Tibet has represented a forbidden land of strangers and or an exotic region of mystery. I agree that Tibet is mysterious in a way few other places are.\n\nCoins used in Tibet were imported from Nepal during the middle of sixteenth century. Many debased silver coins were struck in Nepal and sent to Tibet. Later, the minting of adulterated coins which had been the cause of the war between Tibet and Nepal in 1791. The Eighth Dalai Lama requested the Qing Government for military help, and Nepal troop (Gurkha) was defeated by the Qing army.\n\nAccording to a Chinese reference 'ÂÃ¾Ç¬ã¨s½×ÂO²Ä¤»¿è - Zang Xue Yan Jiu Lun Cong', (page 87, ISBN7 223 00747 8/2. 46) the Qing Government had paid 10,520,000 taels in weight of silver for the Qing troop during the war. The amount of silver was equal to one quart of the total annual income of the Qing Government at that time.\n\nAfter the war, the Qing Government promulgated the new regulations '´Ü©wÂÃ¤ºµ½«á³¹µ{¤G¤Q¤E±ø - The Authorized Regulations for the Better Governing of Tibet' in 1793. This new royal decree of 29 article was published in order to strengthen the Qing Government's control over Tibet.\n\nIt is believed that Tibet had begun its own coinage probably in about 1760s. The first coin was minted by the order of Regent of the Tibet government Dican Hutuktu. As I know that the first Tibetan coin bears only the motifs of Buddhisim to assert its local origins, there is no any inscriptions on the both sides of the coin.\n\nSome Western scholars believed that the first Tibetan mint opened in 1791, but operations were suspended two years later. In 1792, Qing government established a second mint in Lhasa to issue silver coins for the local market until 1836. But I have collected some speciments of Tibetan Tangka which denoted minting in 1791. Might be the dies had already prepared in 1791, but they were used two years later. Really, I am confused with the dating of the early Tibetan Tangkas. This can only prove that there were at least two mints existed in Tibet during the 1790's. The Tibetan silver coins normally were known as Tangkas, they were minted in Tibet during the period of 1791 to 1946. They exhibit a wide array of varieties and yet the features of Tibetan tangkas remained nearly invariable for over a century.\n\nTwo major types of Tangkas have been catalogued. The early minted Tangka coin features of a lotus in an inner circle, surrounded, in eight compartments, by the eight lucky symbols on one side, and on the other side, it features of an inner square with the date, surrounded by scrolled ornaments. I cannot determine the minting place of Kong-par Tangkas which denoted minting during the 1790's. Mr. Oliver D. Cresswell believed that they were probably minted in Giamda.\n\nFor the later minted Tangkas, it features on the reverse with a wheel symbol surrounded, in eight compartments, by the legend [Dgar Ldan Pho Rdang Co Las Nam Rgal] with means 'The gaden palace victorious on all sides'.\n\nNormally Tangkas don't bear a denomination, and only the first six coins listed bear a date. They were minted between 1791 to 1891. They are known as \"Kong-par Tangka\" coins. For those bear without date are known as \"Gaden Tangka\" which will be talking about in a near future."
