        "text": "Tibet lies at the center of Asia, with an area of 2.5 million square kilometers. The earth’s highest mountains, a vast arid plateau, and great river valleys make up the physical homeland of six million Tibetans. It has an average altitude of 13,000 feet above sea level. From 1949 to present, Tibet is comprised of the three provinces of Amdo (now split by China into the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu & Sichuan), Kham (largely incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Qinghai), and U-Tsang (which, together with western Kham, is today referred to by China as the Tibet Autonomous Region).\n\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) comprises less than half of historic Tibet and was created by China in 1965 for administrative reasons. It is important to note that when Chinese officials and publications use the term “Tibet,” they mean only the TAR. Tibetans use the term Tibet to mean the three provinces described above, i.e., the area traditionally known as Tibet before the 1949-50 invasion.\n\nIt is generally held that China and Tibet were independent prior to the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), and that Tibet has been ruled by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) since 1959. The nature of Tibet’s relationship with China in the intervening period is a matter of debate:\n\nThe PRC asserts that Tibet has been a part of China since the Mongol Yuan dynasty.\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) asserted that “Tibet was placed under the sovereignty of China” when the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) ended the brief Nepalese rule (1788-1792) from parts of Tibet in 1793.\n\nThe Tibetan Government in Exile asserts that Tibet was an independent state until the PRC invaded Tibet in 1949-50.\n\nSome Western scholars maintain that Tibet and China were ruled by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, that Tibet was independent during the Chinese Ming dynasty (1368–1644), and that Tibet was ruled by China or at the very least subordinate to the Manchu Qing during much of the Qing dynasty.\n\nSome Western scholars also maintain that Tibet was independent from 1912 to 1950, although it had extremely limited international recognition\n\nIndependence for Tibet came in 1911, following the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the surrender of Chinese imperial troops to the Tibetan Army. From 1911 to the late 1940s, Tibet avoided most foreign influences and was considered to be an independent state. But in 1949-50, the newly founded People’s Republic of China invaded the Himalayan nation, eventually occupying half the country by 1951. In May of that year, Tibet was forced to sign the so-called “17 Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet,” which gave China control over the Tibetan region.\n\nDespite over 40 years of PRC administration occupation and repression, the Tibetan people refuse to be conquered and subjugated. The present Chinese policy, a combination of demographic and economic manipulation, and discrimination aims to suppress the Tibetan issue by changing the very character and the identity of Tibet and its people.\n\nInstitutions And Organizations\n\nTibet Governance Lab (Tibet GovLab)\n\nThe Tibet Governance Lab based at the Elliott School of International Affairs advances scholarship, research, and new perspectives on key issues of governance and public policy in contemporary Tibet. The program promotes research initiatives and program activities that produce fresh insights, analyses, and approaches to understanding the social, economic and institutional challenges confronting the Tibetan region.\n\nThe Guhyasamaja Center\n\nThe Guhyasamaja Center is a community of spiritual friends in the Washington DC metro area dedicated to the practice of Tibetan Buddhism. committed to helping all beings fulfill their highest potential — boundless wisdom and compassion inspired by an attitude of universal responsibility. Our primary focus is the exploration of the mind — how to understand and work with our mind to overcome inner causes of suffering and dissatisfaction (such as hatred, greed, and ignorance) while cultivating inner causes of happiness (such as love, compassion, patience, and wisdom).\n\nRIGPA Washington D.C.\n\nRigpa aims to present the Buddhist tradition of Tibet in a way that is both completely authentic and as relevant as possible to the lives and needs of modern men and women.\n\nMahayana Sutra and Tantra Center of Washington, DC\n\nThe Mahayana Sutra and Tantric Center of Washington, DC, was established in 1979 by the late Hlaramapa Geshe, Khensur Lobsang Tharchin Rinpoche. It was incorporated as a non-profit religious organization dedicated to the preservation and dissemination of Buddhist knowledge (according to the Gelukpa Tibetan Buddhist tradition).\n\nThe Office of Tibet\n\nThe Office of Tibet in Washington, D.C. represents His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Central Tibetan Administration in North America. The main responsibility of this Office is to work for the promotion of His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s three principal commitments- Promotion of Human values, Promotion of religious harmony, and Preservation of Tibetan culture and religion.\n\nTibet Community of NJ & NY\n\nThe Tibetan Community of New York & New Jersey not-for-profit organization focused on supporting the survival of Tibetan culture and identity, and to enhance the quality of life for all Tibetans living in the local community and worldwide.\n\nCentral Tibetan Association\n\nThe Central Tibetan Administration or CTA is an organization based in India. The CTA is also referred to as the Tibetan Government in Exile which has never been recognized by China. It is formed by Tibetans inside Tibet and its internal structure is government-like. In addition to political advocacy, it administers a network of schools and other cultural activities for Tibetans in India.\n\nInternational Campaign for Tibet\n\nThis organization serves as the largest Tibet support group in the world, the International Campaign for Tibet is defined by acts of skillful compassion. They work in areas such as government advocacy, empowerment, and also provides funds to support Tibetans who can make a significant contribution to their community in the fields of visual arts and media, and environmental and women’s rights.\n\nCenter for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS)\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is a bipartisan, nonprofit policy research organization dedicated to advancing practical ideas to address the world’s greatest challenges.\n\nThe Brookings Institution\n\nThe Brookings Institution is a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, DC. Our mission is to conduct in-depth research that leads to new ideas for solving problems facing society at the local, national, and global levels.\n\nThe Wilson Center\n\nThe Wilson Center, chartered by Congress in 1968 as the official memorial to President Woodrow Wilson, is the nation’s key non-partisan policy forum for tackling global issues through independent research and open dialogue to inform actionable ideas for the policy community."
