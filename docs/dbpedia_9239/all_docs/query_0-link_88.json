        "text": "Early history to the 9th century\n\nCredible history begins late in the 6th century, when three discontented vassals of one of the princes among whom Tibet was then divided conspired to support the neighbouring lord of Yarlung, whose title was Spu-rgyal btsan-po. Btsan-po (mighty) became the designation of all kings of Tibet (rgyal means king; and spu, the meaning of which is uncertain, may refer to a sacral quality of the princes of Yar-lung as divine manifestations). Their new master, Gnam-ri srong-brtsan (c. 570c.619 CE), was transformed from a princeling in a small valley into the ruler of a vigorously expanding military empire.\n\nGnam-ri srong-brtsan imposed his authority over several Qiang tribes on the Chinese border and became known to the Sui dynasty (581618) as the commander of 100,000 warriors. But it was his son, Srong-brtsan-sgam-po (c. 617650), who brought Tibet forcibly to the notice of the Taizong emperor (reigned 626649), of the Tang dynasty. To pacify him, Taizong granted him a princess as his bride. Srong-brtsan-sgam-po is famed as the first chos-rgyal (religious king) and for his all-important influence on Tibetan culture, the introduction of writing for which he borrowed a script from India, enabling the texts of the new religion to be translated. He extended his empire over Nepal, western Tibet, the Tuyuhun, and other tribes on Chinas border; and he invaded north India.\n\nIn 670, 20 years after Srong-brtsan-sgam-pos death, peace with China was broken and for two centuries Tibetan armies in Qinghai and Xinjiang kept the frontier in a state of war. In alliance with the western Turks, the Tibetans challenged Chinese control of the trade routes through Central Asia.\n\nThe reign of Khri-srong-lde-brtsan (755797) marked the peak of Tibetan military success, including the exaction of tribute from China and the brief capture of its capital, Changan, in 763. But it was as the second religious king and champion of Buddhism that Khri-srong-lde-brtsan was immortalized by posterity. He initially had prohibited Buddhism, but that restriction was lifted in 761. In 763, when he was 21, he invited Buddhist teachers from India and China to Tibet, and about 779 he established the great temple of Bsam-yas, where Tibetans were trained as monks.\n\nBuddhism foreshadowed the end of Spu-rgyals Tibet. The kings did not fully appreciate that its spiritual authority endangered their own supernatural prestige or that its philosophy was irreconcilable with belief in personal survival. They patronized Buddhist foundations but retained their claims as divine manifestations.\n\nDisunity, 9th to 14th century\n\nIn the 9th century, Buddhist tradition records a contested succession, but there are many inconsistencies; contemporary Chinese histories indicate that Tibetan unity and strength were destroyed by rivalry between generals commanding the frontier armies. Early in the 9th century a scion of the old royal family migrated to western Tibet and founded successor kingdoms there, and by 889 Tibet was a mere congeries of separate lordships. In 843, during that period, Glandar-ma (reigned 841846) ordered the suppression of Buddhism, and Tibets Buddhist traditions were disrupted for more than a century.\n\nTibetan generals and chieftains on the eastern border established themselves in separate territories. The acknowledged successors of the religious kings prospered in their migration to the west and maintained contact with Indian Buddhist universities through Tibetan scholars, notably the famous translator Rin-chen bzang-po (died 1055). In central Tibet, Buddhism suffered an eclipse. A missionary journey by the renowned Indian pandit Atisha in 1042 rekindled the faith through central Tibet, and from then onward Buddhism increasingly spread its influence over every aspect of Tibetan life.\n\nInspired by Atisha and by other pandits whom they visited in India, Tibetan religious men formed small communities and expounded different aspects of doctrine. Atishas own teaching became the basis of the austere Bka-gdams-pa sect. The Tibetan scholar Dkon-mchog rgyal-po established the monastery of Sa-skya (1073), and a series of lamas (Tibetan priests) founded several monasteries of what is generally called the Bka-brgyud-pa sect.\n\nAlthough it has been widely stated that the Tibetans submitted about 1207 to Chinggis (Genghis) Khan to avert an invasion, evidence indicates that the first military contact with the Mongols came in 1240, when they marched on central Tibet and attacked the monastery of Ra-sgreng and others. In 1247, Köden, younger brother of the khan Güyük, symbolically invested the Sa-skya lama with temporal authority over Tibet. Later Kublai Khan appointed the lama Phags-pa as his imperial preceptor (dishi), and the politico-religious relationship between Tibet and the Mongol empire is stated as a personal bond between the emperor as patron and the lama as priest (yon-mchod).\n\nA series of Sa-skya lamas, living at the Mongol court, thus became viceroys of Tibet on behalf of the Mongol emperors. The Mongols prescribed a reorganization of the many small estates into 13 myriarchies (administrative districts each comprising, theoretically, 10,000 families). The ideal was a single authority, but other monasteries, especially Bri-gung and Phag-mo-gru of the Bka-brgyud-pa sect, whose supporters controlled several myriarchies, actively contested Sa-skyas supremacy.\n\nThe collapse of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 also brought down Sa-skya after 80 years of power. Consequently, when the native Chinese Ming dynasty (13681644) evicted the Mongols, Tibet regained its independence; for more than 100 years the Phag-mo-gru-pa line governed in its own right.\n\nA proliferation of scholars, preachers, mystics, hermits, and eccentrics, as well as monastic administrators and warriors, accompanied the subsequent revival of Buddhism. Literary activity was intense. Sanskrit works were translated with the help of visiting Indian pandits; the earliest codifiers, classifiers, biographers, and historians appeared. In an outburst of monastic building, the characteristic Tibetan style acquired greater extent, mass, and dignity. Chinese workmen were imported for decorative work. Temple walls were covered with fine frescoes; huge carved and painted wooden pillars were hung with silk and with painted banners (tankas). Chapels abounded in images of gold, gilded copper, or painted and gilded clay; some were decorated with stucco scenes in high relief; in others the remains of deceased lamas were enshrined in silver or gilded stupas. Under Nepalese influence, images were cast and ritual vessels and musical instruments made in a style blending exuberant power and sophisticated craftsmanship; wood-carvers produced beautiful shrines and book covers, and from India came palm-leaf books, ancient images, and bell-metal stupas of all sizes.\n\nTibet, 14th to 19th century\n\nThe Dge-lugs-pa (Yellow Hat sect)\n\nFor 70 peaceful years Byang-chub rgyal-mtshan (died 1364) and his two successors ruled a domain wider than that of the Sa-skya-pa. Thereafter, although the Phag-mo-gru Gong-ma (as the ruler was called) remained nominally supreme, violent dissension erupted again. In 1435 the lay princes of Rin-spungs, ministers of Gong-ma and patrons of the increasingly influential Karma-pa sect, rebelled and by 1481 had seized control of the Phag-mo-gru court.\n\nAlready a new political factor had appeared in the Dge-lugs-pa sect. Its founder was a saintly scholar, Blo-bzang grags-pa (died 1419), known as Tsong-kha-pa for his supposed birthplace of Tsong-kha in eastern A-mdo. After studying with leading teachers of the day, he formulated his own doctrine, emphasizing the moral and philosophical ideas of Atisha rather than the magic and mysticism of Sa-skyathough he did not discard the latter entirely. In 1409 he founded his own monastery at Dga-ldan, devoted to the restoration of strict monastic discipline. Tsong-kha-pas disciplinary reform appealed to people weary of rivalry and strife between wealthy monasteries. Tsong-kha-pa probably did not imagine that his disciples would form a new sect and join in that rivalry, but, after his death, devoted and ambitious followers built around his teaching and prestige what became the Dge-lugs-pa, or Yellow Hat sect, which was gradually drawn into the political arena.\n\nIn 1578 the Dge-lugs-pa took a step destined to bring foreign interference once more into Tibetan affairs. The third Dge-lugs-pa hierarch, Bsod-nams-rgya-mtsho, was invited to visit the powerful Tümed Mongol leader Altan Khan, with whom he revived the patron-priest relationship that had existed between Kublai Khan and Phags-pa. From this time dates the title of Dalai (Oceanwide) Lama, conferred by Altan and applied retrospectively to the two previous hierarchs. The holder is regarded as the embodiment of a spiritual emanation of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Tibetan: Spyan-ras-gzigs; Chinese: Guanyin)and hence of the mythic monkey demon and progenitor of the Tibetans. The succession is maintained by the discovery of a child, born soon after the death of a Dalai Lama, into whom the spirit of the deceased is believed to have entered. Until 1642 the Dalai Lamas were principal abbots of the Dge-lugs-pa, and in that year they acquired temporal and spiritual rule of Tibet. With Altans help virtually all the Mongols became Dge-lugs-pa adherents, and on Bsod-nams-rgya-mtshos death they acquired a proprietary interest in the order and some claims on Tibet itself when the fourth Dalai Lama was conveniently discovered in the Tümed royal family.\n\nTo support their protégé, the Mongols sent armed bands into Tibet. Their opponents were the Red Hat Lama, head of a Karma-pa subsect, and his patron the Gtsang king. That phase of rivalry ended inconclusively with the early death of the fourth Dalai Lama and the decline of Tümed Mongol authority in Mongolia. The next came when Güüshi Khan, leader of the Khoshut tribe, which had displaced the Tümed, appeared as champion of the Dge-lugs-pa. In 1640 he invaded Tibet, defeating the Gtsang king and his Karma-pa supporters.\n\nThe unification of Tibet\n\nIn 1642 with exemplary devotion, Güüshi enthroned the Dalai Lama as ruler of Tibet, appointing Bsod-nams chos-phel as minister for administrative affairs and himself taking the title of king and the role of military protector. These three forceful personalities methodically and efficiently consolidated the religious and temporal authority of the Dge-lugs-pa, establishing a unique joint control over the region by both Mongols and Tibetans. Lhasa, long the spiritual heart of Tibet, now became the political capital as well. Dge-lugs-pa supremacy was imposed on all other orders, with special severity toward the Karma-pa. A reorganized district administration reduced the power of the lay nobility.\n\nThe grandeur and prestige of the regime were enhanced by reviving ceremonies attributed to the religious kings, by enlarging the nearby monasteries of Bras-spungs, Sera, and Dga-Idan, and by building the superb Potala Palace, completed by another great figure, Sangs-rgyas-rgya-mtsho, who in 1679 succeeded as minister regent just before the death of his patron the fifth Dalai Lama. By then a soundly based and unified government had been established over a wider extent than any for eight centuries.\n\nThe installations of the fifth Dalai Lama (the Great Fifth) at Lhasa (1642) and the Qing, or Manchu, dynasty in China (1644) were almost synchronous. In 1652 the fifth Dalai Lama went to Beijing to meet with the Qing emperor Shunzhi. Prior to the Dalai Lamas return to Tibet the following year, the Shunzhi emperor conferred upon him a golden album and a golden seal and formally proclaimed him the Dalai Lama (which, to the Qing, was an honorific title). In addition, a Qing envoy accompanied the Dalai Lama back to Tibet and conferred Qing legitimacy to the Güüshi Khan on behalf of the emperor. Good relations with Tibet were important to the Manchu because of the Dalai Lamas prestige among the Mongols, from whom a new threat was taking shape in the ambitions of the powerful Oirat of western Mongolia. The Dalai Lama also expected more support from the Qing government to confirm his political power over Tibet, as Mongolian control there gradually weakened.\n\nElsewhere, Lhasas expanding authority with both Mongolian and Tibetan martial forces brought disagreements with Bhutan, which held its own against Tibetan incursions in 1646 and 1657, and with Ladakh, where a campaign ended in 1684 in Tibetan withdrawal to an accepted frontier when the Ladakhĭ king appealed for help to the Muslim governor of Kashmir.\n\nTibet under Manchu overlordship\n\nThe Dalai Lamas death in 1682 and the discovery of his five-year-old reincarnation in 1688 were concealed by Sangs-rgyas-rgya-mtsho, who was intent on continuing the administration without disturbance. He informed the Manchu only in 1694 or 1696 (sources disagree). The Kangxi emperor (reigned 16611722) was incensed at the deception. In 1703 he discovered an ally in Tibet and an antagonist to Sangs-rgyas-rgya-mtsho when Lha-bzang Khan, fourth successor of Güüshi, sought to assert rights as king that had atrophied under his immediate predecessors. The behaviour of the sixth Dalai Lama, Tshangs-dbyangs-rgya-mtsho, who preferred poetry and libertine amusements to religion, gave Lha-bzang his opportunity. In 1705, with the emperors approval, he attacked and killed Sangs-rgyas-rgya-mtsho and deposed Tshangs-dbyangs-rgya-mtsho as a spurious reincarnation. The Tibetans angrily rejected him and soon recognized in eastern Tibet the infant reincarnation of the dead Tshangs-dbyangs-rgya-mtsho.\n\nIn 1717 the Oirat, nominally Dge-lugs-pa supporters, took advantage of Tibetan discontent to intervene in a sudden raid, defeating and killing Lha-bzang. Fear of hostile Mongol domination of Tibet compelled the emperor to send troops against the Oirat. After an initial reverse, his armies drove them out in 1720 and were welcomed at Lhasa as deliverers, all the more because they brought with them the new Dalai Lama, Bskal-bzang-rgya-mtsho. For the next 200 years there was no fighting between Tibetans and Chinese. However, after evicting the Oirat, the emperor decided to safeguard Manchu interests by appointing representatives - generally known as ambans - at Lhasa, with a small garrison in support. The Tibetans, interpreting this as another patron-priest relationship, accepted the situation, which generally left them to manage their own affairs. It was only in recurring crises that Manchu participation became, briefly, energetic. Imperial troops quelled a civil war in Tibet in 1728, restored order after the political leader was assassinated in 1750, and drove out the Gurkhas, who had invaded from Nepal in 1792. As Manchu energy declined, the Tibetans became increasingly independent, though still recognizing the formal suzerainty of the emperor, behind which it sometimes suited them to shelter. At no time did the ambans have administrative power, and after 1792, when Tibet was involved in wars with Ladakh (1842) and Nepal (1858), the Manchu were unable to help or protect them.\n\nAdministration and culture under the Manchu\n\nNo Dalai Lama until the 13th approached the personal authority of the Great Fifth. The seventh incarnation was overshadowed by Pho-lha, a lay nobleman appointed ruler by the Manchu. The eighth was diffident and retiring. But after the Pho-lha familys regime, Dge-lugs-pa clerics resumed power and held onto it through a series of monk regents for about 145 years.\n\nChinese contacts affected Tibetan culture less than might be expected. They helped shape the administrative machinery, army, and mail service, which were based on existing institutions and run by Tibetans. Chinese customs influenced dress, food, and manners; china and chopsticks were widely used by the upper classes. The arts of painting, wood carving, and casting figures continued on traditional lines, with much technical skill but few signs of innovation. An important effect of Manchu supremacy was the exclusion of foreigners after 1792. That ended the hopes of Christian missionaries and the diplomatic visits from British India, which had been started in 1774. Tibet was now closed, and mutual ignorance enshrouded future exchanges with its British neighbours in India.\n\nIn 1753, Kelzang Gyatso founded the Tse-School in the Potala Palace and built the new palace of Norling Kalsang Phodrang at the Norbulingka.\"At the request of the Shabdung Rinpoche Jigmi Dagpa (Jigs med grabs pa, 17241761), spiritual and temporal ruler of Bhutan, Dalai Lama VII helped in the creation of a gold-and-copper monastery roof in Bhutan.\"\n\nThe symbol of the empire was, presumably after the establishment of a state council (Kashag) in the 18th century, the Buddhist Wheel of Law or chakra. This wheel appears on coins from this time.\n\nWheel of Law\n\nNorbulingka Summer Palace, Lhasa, 1755\n\nTHE WHEEL AND DEER EMBLEM\n\nThe Buddhist emblem of a golden eight-spoked wheel flanked by two deer represents the Buddhas first discourse, which he gave in the Deer Park at Sarnath, near Varanasi. This discourse is known as the first turning of the wheel of dharma, when the Buddha taught the doctirnes of the Four Noble Thruths and the Eightfold Noble Path to five Indian mendicants. As a symbol of the Buddhas teachings a gilded three-dimensional wheel and deer emblem is traitionally placed at the front of monastery and temple roofs, from whewre it shines as a crowning symbol of the Buddhaddarma. Tis emblem similarly appears over the four gateways of the divine mandala palace.\n\nThe origin of the wheel and deer emblem probably predates Buddhism, as both the insignia of the wheel, and the motif of two deer flanking the deity Shiva Pashupati, have been found on clay seals unearthed from the ancien Indus valley civilization (cica 2500 BCE). These ancient seals of Shiva as Pashupatinat, the Lord of the Animals, probably form a link between early Shaivism and the first disciples of the Buddha. The Deer Park at Sarnath, to which Shakyamuni Buddha returned after his enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, an where he delivered his first discourse, was probably a sacred grove dedicated to Shiva Pashupati whene Shaivite yogins lived and practiced. Sarnath is very close to the ancient city of Kahi (modern Varanasi), the Çity of Light, which was primarily sacred to Shiva. With tge establishment of the great stupa and monastic academy at Sarnath, it is possible thatthe early Buddhists took the iconic image of Pashupati flanked by two deer, and replaced the central figure of Pashupatu with the iconic symbol of the Buddhist wheel. The wheel and deer motif then became and emblem of the supremacy of the Buddhas teachings over its early predecessor.\n\nThe monastic academy at Kushinagara, where the Buddha was crenated, is believed to have had the emblem of a funeral pyre between two sal trees over its gateway. It may have been that each of the sacred sites connected with the major events in the Buddhas life displayed specific eblems to commemmorate these events. However, the wheel and deer emblem eventually became the enduring symbol of an establishment where the Buddhas teachings are transmittted and where the endless wheel of the dharma continues to turn.\n\nThe to deer peacefully rest in attentive obedience on either side of the golden wheel, whith the male deer to the right and the female to the left. The male deer is sometimes depicted withe the single horn of the seru deer (unicorn) or rhinoceros, and on gilded bronze sculptures the sexual organs of the two deer may be shown. The gentleness and grace of the deer represent the qualities of the true Buddhist mendicant. [2]\n\nThe chakras, which are held in various Buddhist temples in Tibet and held by two deer, can be considered the achievements of the (Tibetan Buddhist) Church. This is all the more so because these animals, called seru in Tibetan, one of which has a horn on the center of its forehead, are described as rhinoceroses. (symbolizing abstinence and loneliness), an animal (xiniu) that in the Chinese military hierarchy is the symbol of a commander of the 7th rank.\n\nOn top of Buddist temples the dharmachakra is often supported by a male and a female deer kneeling and in adoration\n\nThe dharma wheel is said to have been offered in the form of a thousand-spoked wheel to Śākyamuni Buddha (= Gautama Buddha 480-400BC) by Brahma when requesting him to teach the sacred dharma. At that moment, from the forest came a pair of male and female deer, also known as the krishnasara (Tib.kri sha na sa ra) antelope of compassion. With unblinking gaze, they looked at the wheel with joy and delight.\n\nSubsequently, the Buddha related the noble eight-fold path with the wheel. Likewise, he related the male and female beings whose mind-streams are touched by this path with the pair of male and female deer. Ever since then, the wheel flanked by a pair of deer has been a special symbol for Buddhists.\n\nThubten Gyatso declared independence from China in early 1913 (13 February), after returning from India following three years of exile. He then standardized the Tibetan flag in its present form. At the end of 1912 the first postage stamps of Tibet and the first bank notes were issued. Thubten Gyatso built a new medical college (Mentsikang) in 1913 on the site of the post-revolutionary traditional hospital near the Jokhang.\n\nFlag of Tibet, officially used 1912-1959.\n\nWithin a yellow bordure a white mountain charged with two snow lions supporting a yin - yang symbol and the auspicious triple jewel. Above the mountain is a golden sun with blue and red rays. (From: W. Smith: Flags. 1975 p. 25.)\n\nOn the flag of Tibet, the chakra has been replaced by a (rising) sun radiant which, in combination with the white triangle representing a mountain, represents the Tibetan Empire.\n\nIn addition, there is the triple jewel and the yang-yin symbol that should be more closely associated with the 13th D.L. and that is held by two snow lions.\n\nParted per pile the chief gironny of twelve Gules and Azure, the base Argent charged with two lions supporting a yin - yang symbol and the auspicious triple jewel by way of crest. In nombril point a rising sun radiant Or; in chief, dexter and base a bordure Or.\n\nThe modern Tibetan national flag was adopted in 1916 Its international debut was in the National Geographic Magazines Flags of the World issue of 1934. It even featured in a cigarette-card series in Europe in 1933. The flag was probably too new to appear in the very first flag issue (1917) of the National Geographic, but Tibet does receive mention in an article on medieval flags in that same issue. According to an eminent vexillologist, Professor Pierre Lux-Worm, the national flag of Tibet was based on an older 7th century snow lion standard of the Tibetan Emperor, Songtsen Gampo. It should be borne in mind that over 90% of the flags of the nations in the UNO were created after WWII, including the national flag of China. The Tibetan flag made its official international appearance in 1947, at the First Inter-Asian Conference, which Mahatma Gandhi addressed. The Tibetan flag was displayed alongside other flags of Asian nations, and a circular flag emblem placed before the Tibetan delegation on the podium.\n\nThe flag consists of a stylized representation of a mountain and a sun radiant. In front of the mountain is an achievement\n\nTibet itself is represented as a mountain in the form of a white triangle\n\nLike the symbol for China designed by Sun-yat Sen in 1906, the Tibetan sun has twelve rays. In the Chinese case, they symbolize the continuous process of progress. The sun itself is the heavenly symbol that symbolizes supreme power. The Tibetan sun is a symbol of freedom, happiness and prosperity. Its 12 rays represent the 12 descendants of the six aboriginal tribes of Tibet, the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru, and Ra which in turn gave rise to the (twelve) descendants. Their colours red and blue are symbolic of the two black and red guardian deities (male and female) with which Tibet has been connected since times immemorial.\n\nThe central element of the achievement is the yin-yang symbol in yellow and blue. This is the chinese symbol of the two First Causes or Creative Opposites such as heaven and earth, light and dark, male and female, stillness and movement, etc. This can be understood as the symbol of the driving force of the head of state in the person of the Dalai Lama who unites both principles.\n\nOn either side of the yin-yang symbol are two snow lions holding up the Triple Jewel (konchog-sum). This is the Buddhist symbol of the holy trinity Buddha, Dharma and Sangha that every professing Buddhist deals with on a daily basis. Dharma is the word of Buddha or the Buddhist teachings. Sangha is actually the Buddhist monastic order but is understood by the Tibetans as Lamaism or the Tibetan Buddhist Church.\n\nThe snow lions can be interpreted differently. In the Bon religion prior to Buddhism, the lion is the third mythological creature. In Buddhism, the lion or a pair of lions is the support of the throne of Buddha, and various deities are literally depicted in Buddhist iconography as being carried by a lion. Notwithstanding, its meaning as a chinese military rank symbol should also be noted.\n\nLastly, the adornment with a yellow border symbolises that the teachings of the Buddha, which are like pure, refined gold and unbounded in space and time, are flourishing and spreading."
