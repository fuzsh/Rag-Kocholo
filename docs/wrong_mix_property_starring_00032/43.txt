Even if Joe Jonas isn’t exactly a spider web thrower on TV, he doesn’t harbor any resentment. He remembers his audition for the lead part in the 2012 movie The Amazing Spider-Man, which eventually went to Andrew Garfield on a podcast via Us Magazine. Even though the movie franchise made an incredible $8.9 billion at the box office, Jonas is not sorry about the chance lost.

“In the moment, you’re destroyed or you’re defeated. But you realize this person was brilliant. I remember years ago I was up for Spider-Man and I was so, so excited and it was the year Andrew Garfield got it.

Obviously, he was the right one. I was like, ‘I got an in here’. But you know what? I love the process of auditioning and putting yourself out there and having to prove yourself.”

The web-slinging responsibilities were meant for Garfield, despite Jonas’s intense love for the part, and he accepts this with grace. Fans of Garfield’s eccentric and passionate interpretation of the web-slinging hero agree with this sentiment. Even though Jonas may not have taken on the role of Spider-Man, it’s obvious that his acting career is only getting started.
