Joe Jonas is going to be guest-starring on TV Land’s uber-popular new show “Hot in Cleveland.” The “Burnin’ Up” singer, whose acting credits include the Disney Channel flick “Camp Rock,” will appear in an August episode of “Cleveland” as Valerie Bertinelli’s son. And since the sitcom’s already been renewed for a second season, it’s a safe bet that his first appearance won’t be his last.
