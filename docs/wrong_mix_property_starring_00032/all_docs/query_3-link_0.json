        "text": "The pied-a-terre that divorcing couple Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner called home in New York City has just hit the market for a tad shy of $6 million, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nLocated in the Nolita neighborhood in downtown Manhattan, the light-filled property is a three-bedroom, three-bath condo in a luxury boutique building that includes just 11 residences. It clocks in at 2,907 square feet and includes an open-plan living space and a kitchen that’s equipped with Imperial Danby marble countertops, Miele appliances and SieMatic cabinetry. The primary suite, featuring a walk-in closet and en-suite bath, opens directly onto a 1,450-square-foot landscaped private terrace that offers sweeping views of the city.\n\nThe unit, which also boasts custom oak floors and a Daikin central air system, is listed with Carl Gambino of The Gambino Group at Compass and Adam Modlin of Modlin Group.\n\nAccess to the condo is provided by a keyed elevator which opens onto a private foyer and the building also features a 24-hour doorman and additional storage.\n\nIn 2021, Jonas and Turner sold a mansion in the L.A. neighborhood of Encino for $15.2 million. And just this past August, the two sold a six-bedroom, nine-bath mansion (with a private dock) in Miami for $15 million. Both properties had been listed with Gambino.\n\nBack in 2020, the condo in Nolita had previously been on the market for $5.9 million; it was purchased in 2018 for $5.6 million in 2018, according to The Real Deal.\n\nScroll on for more pictures of the condo in Nolita:"
