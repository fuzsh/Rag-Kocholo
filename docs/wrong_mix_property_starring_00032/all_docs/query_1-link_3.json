        "text": "\"Shane never forgets...\"\n\nIt's officially been 10 years since Camp Rock came out, and I'm feelin' pretty emotional (translation: old) about the whole thing.\n\nAnd I'm not the only one! After all these years, Joe Jonas just revealed that he still has a lot of feelings to sort out:\n\nIn case you're trying to remember what *exactly* Joe is bitter about, it appears he's actually talking about how Camp Star beat Camp Rock in Camp Rock 2:\n\nFans (including Dani) were quick to correct the artist formerly known as Shane, and he had this response:\n\nSo he, um, hilariously misspelled Shane Gray's last name and also didn't really answer the question â€” but it doesn't matter because he was just trying to do a cute thing to commemorate this momentous day, sweeties!!!\n\nHappy Camp-rock-iversary, y'all!!!! Now we just need a reunion...\n\nShare This Article"
