        "text": "It's faintly terrifying. It's the sound of a million tills ringing. And of a hundred light bulbs going on above the heads of harassed record company executives.\n\nThe screaming that accompanies the London appearance of the Jonas Brothers, Disney's latest clean-cut teen pop idols, at the premiere of the TV movie that has helped propel them to stardom in the US, is at once the sound of pop's past and its future. From the Monkees on, television and films have played a role in bringing music to the teen masses. But the Disney franchise machine, spinning off albums, theatrical performances and concerts from the likes of High School Musical and Hannah Montana, takes it to another level entirely.\n\nCamp Rock, which airs on the Disney Channel in the UK tonight, is a vehicle for perhaps the company's biggest stars to date - Nick, Kevin and Joe Jonas. It also acts as the debut for another, Demi Lovato, whose first album will be co-produced and co-written by the Jonases. As hundreds of kids pour out of the premiere, wide-eyed and breathless, it is clear they have found their soundtrack to the autumn. And other broadcasters and record labels are looking on, eager to make their own version of the Disney model.\n\nNext month, ITV launches Britannia High. The \"Fame meets High School Musical\" weekly show will feature songs by Take That's Gary Barlow and a cast of fresh-faced wannabe stars. It will culminate in a 90-minute finale showcasing songs from the series and the \"journeys\" of the individual characters at a fictional performing arts school.\n\nA co-production between ITV and Globe Productions (the TV arm of Universal, the world's biggest record label), it borrows shamelessly from the Disney lexicon. Rich Ross, president of Disney Channels Worldwide, says: \"We have these touch points that underpin everything we do. One of them is 'express yourself', another is 'celebrate your family.'\" The blurb from Britannia High's advance publicity reads: \"They're learning to be the best they can, in every possible sense, learning as much about life, themselves and each other as they do about their art.\"\n\nAs the music industry is looking beyond traditional revenue streams for new income, so mass-market broadcasters, which have always relied on advertising revenues, are looking to global sales and licensing deals for growth. ITV's hope lies in coming up with formats and ideas that, like Britannia High, can be sold around the world. It also hopes to use the show, the brainchild of Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips and theatre producer David Ian, as a model for future co-productions with major record labels.\n\n\"We're very excited by it. It's one we hope will be an all-singing, all-dancing 360-degree proposition. What we want to do is offer it on as many platforms as possible around the main broadcast. We would hope to be successful with international exploitation of the format and programme sales. You're looking to create something that can be replicated anywhere else in the world,\" says Kate Little, director of business affairs at ITV Productions. Expect to see a raft of spinoff programmes, supplemented by content on the internet, mobile phones and ITV's digital channels. Add to that soundtrack albums, downloads and merchandise. It is no coincidence that ITV has recently hired a raft of senior US executives well versed in the art of creating global brands.\n\n\"The main ambition for Britannia High is that it rates well and gradually grows into an international property. It doesn't have to sell x-thousand albums or launch an artist straight away,\" says David Joseph, the chairman and chief executive of Universal's UK division.\n\nThe link between the Disney behemoth and the ITV attempt to replicate its success is Universal, which distributes some artists signed to Disney subsidiary Hollywood Records, including the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus, the star of Hannah Montana. But what Universal really wants is its own slice of the action. Among the major labels, casting around for new models to compensate for plummeting CD sales and the impact of digital piracy, there is a new enthusiasm for trying to combine television and the internet to create a direct route to the hearts of young fans.\n\nSo how did Disney find this new way to sell music?\n\n\"David Agnew, who runs the Walt Disney record label in the States, says he is the envy and the scourge of his colleagues,\" says Gary Marsh, president of entertainment for Disney Channels Worldwide. \"The envy because he has the power of Disney Channel to help launch these acts, and the scourge because they don't. Television has become the new radio. Our audience, the six- to 12-year-old demographic, is acutely attuned to the music world. By and large, the record companies dismissed them as too poor, too uninterested, too parochial. We figured out a model that feels like music just for them, that somebody thought through and delivered to the place that is most natural for them to consume it.\"\n\nDavid Joseph says access to a platform - be it primetime ITV with Britannia High, or the social network Bebo with its interactive drama experiment The Secret World of Sam King - is now crucial in launching a pop act, because the old routes such as Saturday morning kids' TV and pop magazines like Smash Hits have died.\n\n\"The single biggest change in the pop market in the last five years is that you now look at the platform as much as the music or the artist,\" he says. \"It's more difficult, but if you get it right the rewards are greater. If you hit the bullseye it's exciting. With all of this stuff, Disney included, the songs have to be great. When you go to a Jonas Brothers concert, you still get the same sensation as when you saw Take That in 1992.\"\n\nThe reason that rivals will find it so hard to replicate Disney's global success is demonstrated by its impressive - and slightly terrifying - efficiency. Months before Camp Rock hit town, Disney began bombarding journalists with figures about High School Musical's global dominance. To take just one, the High School Musical 2 soundtrack was the biggest-selling album in the world last year, shifting more than 6m copies. And the biggest seller the year before? The first High School Musical soundtrack.\n\nThen comes the hype about the US version of Camp Rock (24.5 million viewers over its opening weekend in the US; the song This Is Me rocketing to the top of the iTunes chart). And that's before seemingly the entire Disney board hits town, together with the cast, for the impeccably organised premiere.\n\nWhile the rest of the industry gave up on the under-14 market to target less challenging, less volatile areas, Disney seized its opportunity. \"Clearly, the paradigm has changed. What has really accelerated in the last three or four years is that the Disney Channel has become an incredible content creation machine for the rest of the Walt Disney company. It is a fundamental shift in how business is done and how television is perceived within the company,\" says Marsh.\n\nMark Sutherland, global editor of trade magazine Billboard, says Disney is practising what every other major label preaches when it comes to the much-discussed, but rarely realised, \"360 degree\" model. \"They have been clever in the way they've gone about this. They're not just selling records, they're signing talent and applying it across multiple platforms,\" he says.\n\nThe other thing Disney has on its side is a keen appreciation of the need for a bottom-up, viral buzz in the digital age. The Jonas Brothers' most recent video has been viewed almost 30m times on YouTube. \"The successes we've had would still have been successful, and the failures would still have failed, without the global digital model,\" says Marsh. \"What it's done is accelerate the process geometrically. You've supercharged the curve. That's what the internet has done.\"\n\nCombine that viral buzz with saturation television coverage - Disney will typically air each movie dozens of times across its various kids' channels - and the audience will develop a far deeper relationship with the artists than a record company marketing budget can create.\n\n\"Our relationship between the performers and the audience is fundamentally different because of the way they experience this talent,\" says Marsh. \"You see these kids in a storytelling context, so you know who they are. Your relationship to them is as a friend. It's as though you're buying your best friend's record. That's why it's working.\"\n\nThere is another useful side effect to targeting under-12s, Marsh says. \"Our audience is either too young or too well supervised to steal. They're buying the music, they're actually buying it. This is a dream come true for a label.\"\n\nHowever, new star Demi Lovato, in town with the Jonas Brothers as part of the aforementioned media blitz, has forgotten to read the script. \"I probably shouldn't say this for business reasons,\" she says. \"But if someone stole my music, I'd be honoured that someone was listening to my song. I love making music so that people can listen to it rather than to make money out of it.\"\n\nKevin Jonas, the eldest brother, jumps in to save his Camp Rock co-star. \"And then buy a T-shirt! That's why the internet has played such a huge part in both our careers - that's why the demand for the new album here was so quick. They had already heard the last one and they wanted more.\"\n\nFor those tiring of the Disney production line, there is little respite. High School Musical 3 is on its way, as a theatrical release rather than a TV movie, and Lovato and the Jonas Brothers have new TV series to look forward to. Inevitably, Camp Rock 2 is already in production.\n\nThe last word goes to Rich Ross of Disney: \"In the old days, the line used to be 'the hits that keep on coming'. We're making that a reality again.\""
