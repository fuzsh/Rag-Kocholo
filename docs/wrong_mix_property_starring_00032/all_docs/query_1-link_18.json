        "text": "It wasn’t long ago that Joe Jonas was selling out arenas and stadiums with his sibling partners in the Jonas Brothers. But with his new band, DNCE, he’s playing clubs as well as opening for Selena Gomez on her Revival Tour.\n\nAnd he’s having the time of his life.\n\n“It’s been incredible,” Jonas, 26, said during a stop at the Magic Bag in Ferndale last fall. “It’s nice going on a tour when you know it’s sold out. You feel like you don’t have to do as much work.”\n\nExcept, of course, on stage, where DNCE’s dance-infused party songs are designed to be a workout for both the band and its audience.\n\n“We definitely have fun, and on stage we try to bring a party everywhere we go,” explained Jonas, who had the idea for DNCE several years ago but got serious about it last year, when the Jonas Brothers went on hiatus and he hooked up Jonas Brothers band drummer, drummer Jack Lawless, to start recording material. They subsequently recruited guitarist JinJoo Lee from South Korea, who had toured with the Jonas Brothers as well as Cee-Lo Green, and multi-instrumentalist Cole Whittle from Semi Precious Weapons.\n\n“Obviously we take the music very seriously and we’re proud of the body of work. But when you come to the show you can tell that it’s just a good time. We try to make it light, fun, crazy and make people feel like they’re on a spaceship with us somewhere, having a blast.”\n\nThe DNCE rocket is just achieving liftoff, however. Its “Swaay” EP last year launched the double-platinum, Top 10 hit “Cake By the Ocean,” while the group’s debut album is headed for hoped-for release later this year. With no Jonas Brothers reunion in sight – although Jonas said “You can never say never” – DNCE is a long-term concern, whether or not it reaches the same heights as its predecessors.\n\n“I definitely would say yeah, I want to continue this journey,” said Jonas, whose acting credits include Walt Disney’s two “Camp Rock” films, the JONAS” series, “Hot In Cleveland” and a cameo in Vampire Weekend’s “Giving Up The Gun” video. “It’s been nothing but fun, and I really want to be able to continue to be in this band and create, and hopefully this ride won’t stop any time soon.”"
