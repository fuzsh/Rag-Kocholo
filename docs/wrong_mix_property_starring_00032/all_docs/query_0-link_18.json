        "text": "Why does this story matter?\n\nAccording to a TMZ report, Jonas is seeking a divorce from Turner. After dating for a year, and being engaged for another two, the pair got married in 2019. They have two daughters from their marriage of four years- the elder daughter who is three years old, and the one-year-old younger one. Jonas is reportedly seeking joint custody of the kids.\n\nTurner roasted Jonas in front of a live audience\n\nIt was during Netflix's Jonas Brothers Family Roast when Turner roasted her husband. She started with how she chose to move to the US to be with him, and the differences between England and the US. Citing one of the differences, she said, \"The sequel to Camp Rock is called Camp Rock 2 whereas in England it's called a load of s*t.\"\n\nOn her decision to not date an actor\n\nTurner also recalled her decision of not dating an actor and then ending up marrying Jonas. \"I said when I started acting that I would never date an actor. And after I saw Camp Rock 2, I knew it was safe to date Joe.\" She didn't stop there. She also roasted the other two Jonas Brothers, Kevin Jonas and Nick Jonas, over their singing.\n\nAll you need to know about their split\n\nAs mentioned by Jonas on the legal documents submitted by him, the reason for their split is because their marriage is \"irretrievably broken,\" reportedly. However, a TMZ report, quoting a source, claimed that it was their lifestyle differences that led to the chasm. \"She likes to party, he likes to stay at home. They have very different lifestyles,\" the report read."
