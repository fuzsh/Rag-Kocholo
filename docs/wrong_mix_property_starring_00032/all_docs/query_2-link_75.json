        "text": "Wayne Township Community Theatre continues its 2015 Theatre Season with “Disney’s Camp Rock: The Musical” directed by Tara Roberds, opening this Friday.\n\nThe musical is the stage adaptation of the “Camp Rock” movies that premiered on the Disney Channel, featuring songs and characters from the 2008 and 2010 movies and a story based on “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.” There are more than a dozen songs featured in the show including “This Is Me,” “Can’t Back Down,” “It’s On,” and “We Rock.” 35 students and adults from Wayne Township and Hendricks County are featured in the production.\n\nPerformances will take place at 7:30 p.m. on August 21, 22, 28, 29 and at 2:30 p.m. on August 23 and 30. Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for seniors and $8 for students. Tickets can be purchased at the door or by calling the Box Office, 317.988.7966. The show will be performed in the Theatre at Ben Davis. Please enter through Door #2. The show is appropriate for all ages.\n\nThe production will transport audience members to summer camp at Camp Rock – the ultimate camp for aspiring musicians.\n\n“Everyone will enjoy this feel-good, high energy, fast-paced production that’s like a rock show!” says director Tara Roberds. “There is a song every two minutes and the music is very contagious, so the audience is certain to have a great time. We’re proud to feature many Wayne Township students and parents in starring and featured roles in our show. Connie Barnett, Ben Davis Class of 1974 and long time Wayne Township employee and community theatre veteran stars as one of our camp directors, as well.”\n\nWhen Camp Rock opens for the summer Mitchie Torres (Morgan Barnett, 2014 graduate) arrives and greets her friends from last summer. Everyone is welcomed by Camp Rock’s founder, Brown Cesario (Julie Sharton). When Mitchie starts off Opening Jam she is joined by Connect 3 front man Shane Gray (Kyle Berry) along with his brothers, Nate (Noah Sigler) and Jason (Owen Meyer).\n\nIn spotlight-absorbing fashion, Tess Tyler (Kayla Richardson) takes the stage. This summer at camp is supposed to be all about the music and having the time of their lives. But Brown’s rival and former band mate Axel Turner (Connie Barnett) invites campers to visit the brand new, flashy Camp Star across the lake which now threatens Camp Rock’s very existence.\n\nTo keep the doors open, Mitchie steps up, rallies her fellow Camp Rockers, and gets them into top shape for the ultimate showdown! Other Wayne Township students in the show include Ally Johnson, Destiny Smith, Shelby Woodcock, Julianna Hagen, Annelise Hartman, Cheyanne Riedy, Ruby Berry, Abigail Jewell, Lexie Bordenkecher, Jai Stubblefield and Chealsy Nunn."
