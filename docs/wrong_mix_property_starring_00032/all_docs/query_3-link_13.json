        "text": "Sophie Turner is grateful Taylor Swift let her stay in her New York City apartment amid her divorce from Joe Jonas.\n\n“Taylor was an absolute hero to me this year,” the “Game of Thrones” alum told British Vogue for her June 2024 cover story, published Wednesday.\n\nTurner, 28, met Swift, 34, approximately 10 years ago, but they were not close initially because Jonas, also 34, had briefly dated the “Love Story” singer in 2008.\n\nHowever, Turner shared that she reached out to Swift for help in September 2023 because she and the estranged couple’s two daughters, Willa, 3, and Delphine, 1, needed a place to stay after Jonas filed for divorce, to which the Grammy winner offered up her pad.\n\n“I’ve never been more grateful to anyone than I am for her because she took my children and me, and provided us with a home and a safe space. She really has a heart of gold,” the actress gushed.\n\nPage Six exclusively reported in October 2023 that Swift had let Turner crash at her $50 million Tribeca compound rent-free after the English star initially stayed at a hotel in Midtown.\n\nTurner was spotted entering and leaving the apartment several times and hanging out with Swift in the fall, but she has since moved back to her native UK.\n\n“The support I had from the women in my life during that time was the most amazing thing to see. I felt so held and so protected,” she shared to the magazine.\n\nThe “X-Men” star remembers her split from the Jonas Brothers member — and the immediate aftermath — as “the worst few days” of her life.\n\n“It felt like I was watching a movie of my life that I hadn’t written, hadn’t produced or starred in. It was shocking. I’m still in shock,” she recalled in the interview.\n\nTurner also candidly addressed reports that claimed Jonas had left her because “she likes to party” while he preferred to “stay at home” with their kids.\n\n“It hurt because I really do completely torture myself over every move I make as a mother – mum guilt is so real! I just kept having to say to myself, ‘None of this is true. You are a good mum and you’ve never been a partier,'” she said.\n\nTheir divorce took a bitter turn when it came to their custody agreements. At one point, Turner even filed a child abduction lawsuit against Jonas because she claimed he had been withholding their girls’ passports so they could not move to the UK.\n\nThe “Cake by the Ocean” singer denied the allegations, and she eventually dismissed the case in January.\n\nThe former couple agreed to settle their divorce privately and eventually reached a temporary custody agreement.\n\nHowever, Turner filed to “reactivate” their divorce in March after they were unable to settle custody issues.\n\nDespite the speed bumps in their relationship, Turner explained that she hopes to still be amicable with Jonas for the sake of their daughters.\n\n“I’m unhappy with the way everything played out, especially when it comes to my children. They’re the victims in all of this. But I think we’re doing the best we can,” she told the publication. “I’m confident that we can figure it out. Joe is a great father to our children and that’s all that I can ask for\n\n“My dream is to have a huge Christmas where my daughters can have their dad there, Joe’s whole side of the family, their grandparents. I don’t care about the politics, I just want the girls to feel loved and have everyone show up for them.”"
