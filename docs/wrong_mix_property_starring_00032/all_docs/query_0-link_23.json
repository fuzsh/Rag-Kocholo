        "text": "Joe Jonas scaled the heights of stardom with his siblings as a member of The Jonas Brothers, but after they parted ways he managed to carve out his own musical identity. Born August 15, 1989 in Casa Grande, Arizona, he formed the group with his brothers Kevin and Nick in 2005, when they were all teenagers. Their 2006 debut album, It's About Time, made little impact, but its self-titled 2007 follow-up was phenomenally successful, making the band a teen-pop sensation. Though their Disney movie and TV appearances gave them a full-on boy-band fanbase, The Jonas Brothers weren't a prefab group-they wrote their own songs and played their own instruments. 2008's A Little Bit Longer and 2009's Lines, Vines, and Trying Times were hugely popular as well, but the band called a time-out in 2010 that would soon become permanent. In 2011, Joe stepped out on his own with the solo album Fastlife. Seeking to establish his own sound apart from his brothers, he pursued a style informed more by R&B, electronic, and dance flavors than the pop-rock favored by The Jonas Brothers. But the album achieved only middling sales figures, and generated no major hit singles. Over the next few years, Jonas made a multitude of guest appearances, singing on recordings by Gloria Estefan, Nelly, Ciara, and others. After The Jonas Brothers officially broke up for good in 2013, Joe eventually found himself another band. In 2015 he co-founded the group DNCE with Jack Lawless, JinJoo Lee, and Cole Whittle. The band mixed funk, pop, and rock influences on their self-titled 2016 debut album, which went Gold and spawned the triple-Platinum Top 10 single \"Cake by the Ocean,\" definitively proving to the public that there was life for Joe Jonas beyond boy-band superstardom. However, Jonas reteamed with his brothers in 2019, touring behind the release of their reunion single \"Sucker.\" This announcement coincided with Jonas' marriage to British actress Sophie Turner in May 2019 after two years of dating."
