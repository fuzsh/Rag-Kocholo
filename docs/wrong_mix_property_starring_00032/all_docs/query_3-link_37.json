        "text": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner have tied the knot for the second time - two months after they famously wed in an impromptu Las Vegas ceremony.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers singer, 29, and Game of Thrones actress, 23, exchanged vows at the Château de Tourreau in Sarrians, France, on Saturday at a star-studded event.\n\nThe bride’s former Games of Thrones co-star Maisie Williams served as her maid of honour and her new sisters-in-law Priyanka Chopra and Danielle Jonas were bridesmaids. Of course, Joe’s brothers Nick and Kevin were by his side.\n\nSophie wore a Louis Vuitton gown for her walk down an aisle, reportedly decorated with white flowers and glass candles.\n\nPre-ceremony, the couple partied separately. \"Sophie was drinking champagne with her girlfriends and brunch was also delivered. Joe had a few shots with his groomsmen to ease the nerves,” E! Online reported.\n\nThe couple were spotted greeting friends at the picturesque Château de Tourreau in Sarrians, south-east France, on Thursday before they were photographed arriving at a rehearsal dinner in red ensembles, as their guests wore white.\n\nThe two officially married in a surprise Las Vegas ceremony, complete with an Elvis impersonator, following the Billboard Music Awards on May 1.\n\nHowever, actress Priyanka Chopra, the wife of Joe’s brother Nick, revealed shortly afterward that a more elaborate ceremony was on the way.\n\nFans had suspected wedding bells would ring - again - soon, thanks to some romantic posts the two had shared from Paris, a possible location for a fairy tale wedding, and a comment from none other than Dr. Phil.\n\nHe wrote, “Easy now! 1 week to go! Ha! See you at the wedding!” on June 22.\n\nThe couple met in late 2016, after Joe direct messaged Sophie on Instagram, on the suggestion of mutual friends.\n\nThey were reportedly dating exclusively by the end of the year, before announcing their engagement in October 2017.\n\nWith additional reporting by Raechal Shewfelt.\n\nGot a story tip or just want to get in touch?
