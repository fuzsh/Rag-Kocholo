        "text": "American singer, songwriter, and actor Joe Jonas and English actress Sophie Turner seem to have stuck a classic case of the celebrity actual estate fickle. Even though they purchased it best just over a year in the past for $11 million, the pop superstar (and reality festival judge) and the âGame of Thronesâ alum have hoisted their swank Eighties waterfront mansion in an exclusive Miami enclave in the marketplace at almost $17 million.\n\nThe couple moved to Miami from Los Angeles, where they sold an Encino mansion for $15.2 million to famous person DJ Zedd, and settled in the guard-gated Bay Point group, where listing agent Carl Gambino of Compass informed The Wall Street Journal that other high-profile residents come with coupled singer/songwriter Enrique Inglesias and retired tennis player Anna Kournikova.\n\nRELATED:Joe Jonas And Sophie Turner Sell Their Los Angeles Mansion for $15.2 Million\n\nAccording to Dirt, Dominating its .37-acre waterfront nook parcel, the Jonas-Turner house spans almost 10,500 square toes, with part a dozen bedrooms and 8 and a half bogs. Marketing subject material suggests the home is âpaying homage to Frank Lloyd Wrightâs legendary creations.â And it does bear one of the crucial architectâs signature hallmarks, equivalent to in moderation selected natural materials used in cutting edge and unexpected tactics, and airy, light-filled spaces with monumental home windows that let for a very easy back and forth between indoor and outside areas.\n\nThe couple engaged interior fashion designer Sarah Ivory to refresh where. (As was once pointed out via WSJ, Ivory is married to Gambino.) Water options in the soaring, coral-walled atrium entry were replaced with lush, tropical vertical gardens, and an amoebic gold-toned espresso table and deeply tufted, low-slung furniture covered in wealthy jewel-toned fabrics, it all set upon a plum-hued silk rug underneath a lavender glass chandelier, have been hired as plush foils to the massive double-sided coral stone fireside and the geometric wood frieze that ornaments the 30-foot-high front room.\n\nOther highlights include sleek, chef-accommodating kitchen arranged round a double-wide snack bar island thatâs topped with a stone counter that waterfall over the ends, and a proper dining area decked out with hand-painted jungle themed de Gournay wallpaper. The antique Venetian glass chandelier and bamboo chairs painted a very Lilly Pulitzer colour of green upload to the roomâs old-school Palm Beach vibe.\n\nColors are paler, extra muted in the most commonly monochromatic bedrooms, while the family room showcases a meandering Hans Hopfer-designed Mah Jong settee lined in a kaleidoscopic array of materials from Missoni Home.\n\nOutside, amid lush foliage, emerald carpets of lawn and lighted bushes, thereâs an outdoor kitchen and two swimming pools, one for the grownups and the opposite for the children. A low coral stone wall and a towering row of palm bushes supplies a display screen of privateness between the pool and the 94-foot dock that runs along the waterway that gives easy get admission to to both the bay and the open waters of the Atlantic.\n\nGambino declined to make known to WSJ why Turner and Jonas have determined to sell so soon when they moved in so, who is aware of in the event that they plan to buy once more in Miami, high-tail it again to Los Angeles, or perhaps even relocate to Turnerâs native England. Whatever they do, for now they still have a place in Manhattan to name home, a three-bedroom loft in Nolita that they purchased in 2018 for $5.6 million and unsuccessfully attempted to sell in 2020, first at $6.5 million, then at $5.9 million and finally at $5.4 million earlier than it was once taken off the marketplace.\n\nREAD NEXT: Gisele BÃ¼ndchen Purchases $11.5 Million Estate In Miami Near To Tom Brady\n\nSources: The Wall Street Journal, Dirt\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmajp5Vit7C6wKxkmqaUYsCwvMeinGaspae7pr7SZpysrJGpsm61zWakopmdnnq0sculqmaen6d6coOMpqClpJmku3A%3D"
