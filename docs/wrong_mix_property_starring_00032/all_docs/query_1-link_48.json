        "text": "General\n\nWhat is Jonas Vinyl Club (JVC)?\n\nJonas Vinyl Club is a mail order subscription service and shop designed especially for fans of the Jonas Brothers. It is operated under license from Nick, Joe and Kevin to Vinyl Moon, LLC, a California company that’s been making amazing vinyl records for years.\n\nHow do I join Jonas Vinyl Club?\n\nThe Jonas Vinyl Club is closed to new members at this time. All JVC records are available to purchase individually in the Shop. Existing members will continue their membership until they have received all of their records.\n\nWhen will I receive my records?\n\nFor those who have purchased a JVC Membership plan, we will ship your JVC records and extras in the middle of each month (generally around the 15th).\n\nHere's the monthly schedule:\n\nJanuary's box:\n\n• Lovebug / Lovebug (Live From L.A. 2013) single\n\n• Burnin' Up / Hello Goodbye / Infatuation 10 inch single\n\n• Joe poster #2\n\nFebruary's box:\n\n• A Little Bit Longer LP\n\n• Photobook #2\n\nMarch's box:\n\n• Nick Jonas & the Administration Who I Am LP\n\n• Nick poster #1\n\nApril's box:\n\n• Paranoid / Keeps on Pilin' Up single\n\n• Fly With Me / Before The Storm single\n\n• Kevin poster #1\n\nMay's box:\n\n• Lines, Vines & Trying Times LP\n\n• Photobook #3\n\nJune's box:\n\n• Nick Jonas - Live at the Wiltern double LP\n\n• First Time / Paranoid (Live from L.A. 2013) single\n\n• Nick poster #2\n\nJuly's box:\n\n• Meet You In Paris single\n\n• Pom Poms 10 inch single\n\n• Kevin poster #2\n\nAugust's box:\n\n• V LP\n\n• Photobook #4\n\nSeptember's box:\n\n• Jonas Brothers Live NYC 2007 LP\n\n• JB custom slip mat\n\n• Band poster #1\n\nOctober's box:\n\n• S.O.S. / Move On single\n\n• Hold On / Take A Breath single\n\n• 45 record adapter\n\n• Photobook #1\n\nNovember's box:\n\n• Jonas Brothers LP\n\n• Band poster #2\n\nDecember's box:\n\n• Joe Jonas Fastlife LP\n\n• When You Look Me in the Eyes / Out of This World single\n\n• Joe poster #1\n\nPLUS, FOR DELUXE CLUB MEMBERS ONLY, YOUR 12th AND FINAL MONTHLY BOX WILL CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING:\n\n• It's About Time LP\n\n• LIVE 2009 Soundcheck EP\n\n• Jonas LA soundtrack LP\n\n• Jonas 3D movie soundtrack double LP\n\n• Camp Rock 7 inch single\n\nPlease note some shipments may arrive earlier or later - we will advise members via email of any substantial changes to the release schedule.\n\nFor International orders, who is responsible for import taxes and duties?\n\nSometimes there is a separate, additional import fee that is calculated by customs after your package has shipped. We cannot estimate this fee, but it is usually a percentage of the retail price. The customer is responsible for all import taxes & duty fees. You will have to pay this fee in order to receive your package, or else it will be returned to us. If you are placing an international order, please include your phone number in your shipping address so the shipping carrier can contact you. We are not responsible for packages held or sent back as a result of you not paying this import fee.\n\nFor International orders, how much will the customs form declare for the value of each shipment?\n\nWe will allocate the total replacement value of your JVC Membership pro-rata across all of your shipments.\n\nWill the records include digital downloads?\n\nJVC is vinyl only! :)\n\nWill my colored vinyl records look exactly like what is shown on your website?\n\nThe short answer is not exactly. Each colored vinyl record is made by hand and is unique. Some have more pigmentation, some have less. These variations are a normal part of the custom vinyl manufacturing process in which a vinyl press operator adds various amounts of PVC color pigment to the press as each copy is formed. None will look exactly like the photos on our website (all of which were provided to us from our vinyl vendor), but they will be close (i.e., similar color[s] depicted, similar \"effect\"), but they will not be exactly the same. We have no way of knowing what each copy looks like as they arrive into our warehouse fully sealed in their jackets, and we send them to you fully sealed.\n\nManaging Your Orders\n\nWhat methods of payment do you accept?\n\nWe accept VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.\n\nWhere are my records?\n\nOnce your package has shipped, we will send tracking information to the email you provided to us when you placed your order or started your membership.\n\nU.S. orders are shipped via USPS Media Mail and usually delivered within 10 business days of shipment.\n\nWe have used USPS successfully to ship tens of thousands of records, but the COVID-19 crisis is taking its toll on its systems and personnel. Its tracking system appears to be missing a large percentages of packages (resulting in no acknowledgment of receipt or tracking updates), and delivery time for Media Mail is now running 3 weeks late in certain areas of the U.S. Despite the crisis, 99.9% of packages are successfully delivered by USPS - please have patience.\n\nAll countries outside of the U.S. are shipped using DHL eCommerce, which ships your order to a hub near your address before the final delivery is handled by local carriers. International orders are usually delivered within 3 to 10 weeks of shipment.\n\nPlease note that DHL has advised us that because of the current COVID-19 crisis:\n\n- some of their systems are crashing worldwide which adversely affects their tracking system;\n\n- many of their employees are out sick; and\n\n- the number of aircraft available for their deliveries has been significantly reduced.\n\nThis means that you may not be able to rely on DHL's tracking system and might have to wait longer than normal for your deliveries.\n\nIf you've received a shipment notification and still have not seen your record after the above time frames, feel free to contact support@jonasvinylclub.com Please note that we are not responsible for lost packages resulting from incorrect shipping addresses provided to us. A confirmed delivery receipt from USPS tracking constitutes fulfillment of your order - we are not responsible if your package is lost or stolen from your delivery address after we have received a delivery confirmation from USPS. If your package is returned to our warehouse due to shipping address error, we will contact you for an updated shipping address via the email provided with your membership. You will be responsible for paying reshipping costs for any package delivered by us twice due to an incorrect shipping address, or unpaid customs fees. If within 10 business days we do not receive a response from you regarding a new shipping address or do not receive payment for the shipping cost associated with the second shipment to your corrected address, we reserve the right to refund your order.\n\nHow do I change my shipping or billing address?\n\nTo change your shipping address, please contact support@jonasvinylclub.com.\n\nTo change your billing information, log in to your account by clicking My Account from the main menu at the top of the site (if accessing on mobile), or the account icon (if accessing from a desktop computer).\n\nClick on the 'Manage Subscription' link to change your subscription details.\n\nTo update your billing information, click 'Billing information' from the dropdown menu. From here, you can select 'Update Card' or 'Edit' under 'Billing Information' to view or update your payment info.\n\nHow do I cancel?\n\nJVC Membership cannot be cancelled. All Membership and product purchases are final. Your purchase is non-refundable. You are solely responsible for the use of any credit card or other payment method used in your name, including by any person(s) whom may have obtained your credit card or payment information through fraud or theft.\n\nWhat if my payment is declined?\n\nIf your payment is declined for any reason, we will re-attempt your payment method before reaching out to you with the email we have associated with your membership. We cannot ship your records until any billing issues are resolved, so please make sure you provide us an email account that you check regularly.\n\nWhat should I do if any of my records arrive damaged or don’t arrive at all?\n\nWe ship our records in specially-made LP mailers that minimize potential damage, but sometimes things happen. If you receive a damaged record from us or anything else wrong\n\nwith your order, please reach out to support@jonasvinylclub.com, and we’ll do our best to make it right. Please note that we may not be able to replace or refund for slight cosmetic wear that may occur during shipping. If any item in your order has been damaged, please email us a written description of the problem along with a photo of the damage to support@jonasvinylclub.com. Once we have assessed and validated your claim, we will issue a return label to you via email. Once the returned item has been received at our warehouse, we will provide a replacement copy. If a replacement copy is unavailable, we will issue a refund of a portion of your purchase price that reasonably relates to the item you did not receive.\n\nMembers have a maximum of 60 days from the date of shipment to notify us at support@jonasvinylclub.com about any claim that their package was lost or an item was missing or defective in order to be eligible for replacement or refund.\n\nIf an item you have ordered runs out of stock after your order has been placed, we will contact you via email to exchange the item for another item of equal value. If we do not receive a response from you within 10 business days regarding our proposed replacement item we will assume the replacement offered is satisfactory and ship it to you, or we reserve the right to refund a portion of your purchase price that reasonably relates to the item you did not receive.\n\nIs there anywhere you don't ship?\n\nDue to unreliable delivery, we no longer ship to the following counties:\n\n- Brazil\n\n- Chile\n\n- Russia"
