        "text": "Tag: camp counselor\n\nCompleting your Online Visa Application Form\n\nWith many peoples visa appointments at the U.S. Embassy fast approaching, and having recently completed the application process myself, I thought I would give you all a few tips on how to survive the dreaded visa form! Just kidding by the way, it’s really quite simple but quite time consuming and not to be rushed!\n\nIf you haven’t already completed Part One of the application (and got yourself an Application ID beginning AA…), check out my my guide to the first steps of applying for that all-important visa HERE!\n\nCamp agencies normally provide detailed, in depth instructions on how to correctly complete a visa application, so I am just providing you with a few heads up and things to watch out for on the application.\n\nFirstly, here is the link to the online visa application website: https://ceac.state.gov/GenNIV/Default.aspx\n\nSecondly, here is a list of things you will need handy completing the visa application:\n\nYour passport.\n\nYour National Insurance number.\n\nInformation regarding your employment history for the last 5 years (including dates of employment).\n\nInformation about your parents (including full names, addresses and dates of birth).\n\nTwo additional points of contact that are not related to you (I normally choose two close friends/family friends/neighbours) – including their names, addresses and contact details.\n\nAn online version of a passport-style photo.\n\nThe name of your Camp Director, their contact details and the camps address.\n\nYour social security number (if you are a returner and have one from a previous year).\n\nAny previous visa information (again, if you are a returner).\n\nMy first piece of advice is to SAVE EVERYTHING!!!!! As soon as you have completed a page, before you move on to the next one make sure you select save application at the bottom of the page. Trust me, no one wants to have to complete more than one of these a year!! Also, take your time with your visa application. Its super important that you get all of the information correct and if in ANY doubt, contact your agency.\n\nHere is what the page will look like when you open the link. Enter the country you are applying for the visa in (in my case, England), enter the code shown and then select ‘Retrieve an Application’ (if you wrote down your AA… number when you first started the visa process!).\n\nThe first few pages of the application are generally straight forward – mostly personal details including; your given name (make sure you enter your name as it is shown on your passport – in my case, Eleanor not Ellie!), date and place of birth, nationality and National Insurance number. Personal details are followed by address and contact details, and then passport information.\n\nThe first tricky question is the passport/travel document type. For the majority of us normal folk, you need to select ‘Regular’. If your parents happen to be Diplomats, you may need to contact your agency before proceeding with the visa application.\n\nThe second tricky part in this section is the ‘Where was the passport/travel document issued?’ question on the Passport Information page. On the photo page of your passport, you may find it says ‘IPS’ under the ‘Authority’ heading. If you see this or ‘UKPA’, then that is acceptable to put as your answer to this question.\n\nContinuing on, the next section is ‘Travel Information’. It is important you select the correct option here, so that you don’t end up applying for the wrong type of visa! As we are applying for a J1 visa, select ‘Exchange Visitor’ from the list of options for the ‘Purpose of trip to the US’. See the pictures below for an example!\n\nNote: the ‘Help’ notes on the right hand side of the page (see the red arrow on the first picture) can be really helpful – make sure you read them if you get stuck!\n\nYour intended date of arrival should be the date you are scheduled to arrive in the US, and intended length of stay is generally 4 months (check your specific agency instructions – I followed the instructions for USA Summer Camp/Camp Leaders).\n\nThe address where you will stay in the US is where you enter your camp’s address – see my example below.\n\nThe next section requests information about your previous travel to the US and visa history. Answer appropriately to yourself, and provide details where required. This is followed by your US point of contact, where you usually enter the name of your Camp Director and their contact details (use the same address for the camp as you used in the previous section).\n\nThe next section is where you need to enter information about your family, followed by your employment history for the past 5 years – both pretty straight forward!\n\nAfter this comes a few pages worth of ridiculous security questions, including ‘Are you coming to the United States to engage in prostitution?’, ‘Are you a member or representative of a terrorist organisation?’ and ‘Have you ever engaged in the recruitment or the use of child soldiers?’. I’m not entirely sure anyone with that kind of background would select ‘yes’ to any of those questions, but I’m hoping that you will be able to select ‘no’ to all of the above.\n\nFinally, you will need to provide your SEVIS number (provided to your by your camp agency), upload your passport-style photo, and sign and submit the form. Make sure you print off the confirmation page that appears once you have submitted your application, and take it along with you to your visa appointment.\n\nThings you MUST take to your visa appointment:\n\nVisa confirmation page (see picture above – also known as a DS-160 visa application form).\n\nPassport\n\nAppointment instructions (emailed to you when you book your visa appointment).\n\nOne AMERICAN passport photo (make sure you select the ‘American’ option in the photo booth – American passport photos are more square (2 inches x 2 inches) than the ones we use for British passports).\n\nDS-2019 form (most agencies (Camp Leaders, USA Summer Camp, Camp America) will provide you with this on the day. Some agencies, such as Wildpacks, will send you this in the post prior to your visa day).\n\nSEVIS receipt.\n\nProof of intent to return to UK after camp has ended. This could include documents such as:\n\nUniversity details (for the forthcoming details).\n\nProof of employment upon return (e.g. contract/letter from employer).\n\nProof of housing upon return (e.g. rental contract, letter from landlord).\n\nAny other evidence of social/economic ties to your home country (some people take a letter from their parents).\n\nIf you have any questions AT ALL about your upcoming visa appointment, or need some help completing your application, leave me a comment and I will get back to you! My visa appointment is coming up on Thursday (9th March, 2017) and I am excited for a trip to London, and to catch up with my southern camp friends while I’m down there!\n\nKeep your eyes peeled for my upcoming journal post about my trip to the US embassy!\n\nRelationships at Camp\n\nAs Olivia Newton-John said back in 1978; ‘summer lovin’, had me a blast’ and boy, she wasn’t wrong! Before going to camp in 2015, I was a strong, independent woman – and then I met Ben…\n\nCamp is obviously all about the campers, but if you throw a group of young people together and give them time off in the middle of nowhere with not a lot to do, things are going to happen. There are several different types of hook ups that can happen at camp, and here are a few:\n\nThe Newbie\n\nA new girl/boy arrives at camp and at first, they are generally overwhelmed by everyone and everything. To the returners, you are fresh meat and it’s generally a race to see who gets there first and calls dibs (tragic really!). Newbies, you basically have the pick of the bunch! Take your time and choose wisely, who knows where it could lead!\n\nThe First\n\nThere are people whispering during staff week about who fancies who (yes, we are basically back at primary school), and who is going to be the first to make make a move. No one wants to be remembered as the guy/girl who was the first person to hook up with someone last summer but hey, someone has to take one for the team!\n\nThe Day-Off Hook Up\n\nAfter too many hours spent sunbathing on your day off, the heat goes straight to your head and you end up randomly getting together with one of the girls/boys on your day off. You don’t really mention it to anyone and pray that no one noticed you were gone, but of course everyone will know sooner or later – gossip at camp spreads like wildfire! You’ll regret it but the great thing about camp is that there’s always new drama, and people quickly forget.\n\nThe Rebound\n\nPeople move on quickly at camp. The person you hooked up with last week may have moved onto someone new this week with no explanation as to why! Make sure you’re not anyone else’s rebound – or you could get yourself involved in some serious camp drama!\n\nThe ‘Camp Goggles’\n\nWhen I asked Ben how he would describe ‘camp goggles’, he said:\n\n‘Camp goggles are basically when you get to week six of camp, and even the trees start to look attractive’.\n\nSome people aren’t involved in any kind of relationship throughout the majority of the summer, and then week six comes along and you suddenly see that certain guy/girl in a different light. You may find yourself saying to your bestie ‘Oh, Fred is looking mighty fine today’ when in reality, Fred would definitely be a 5/10 tops in the real world. You end up getting together and then you go home, look through his Facebook profile pictures and think to yourself ‘what was I ever thinking?!’. I like to tease Ben that I’ve had my camp goggles on for a year and a half now…\n\nThe ‘One’\n\nI never expected in a million years that I would go to summer camp and come home with a boyfriend, and I’m definitely not the only one (although I made the mistake of choosing one that doesn’t lives in England – what was I thinking?!). I know at least 5 couples who have met at camp and have gone on to have long-term relationships waaaay after summer has ended – with one couple even getting married in the Fall last year (congrats again Sam and Dan!). Anyway, I have kind of kept my blog a Ben-free zone so far but if there’s any day to share him all with you, Valentine’s Day is as good as any. Camp has changed my life in so many ways, but finding him will always be the best one.\n\nSummer camp is a great place to meet like-minded people and have some fun, but here are a few words of advice when it comes to relationships at camp:\n\nDo NOT (under any circumstances!!) discuss your/other peoples relationships with the campers. Yes, they’re not stupid and yes they will get suspicious if you even so much as TALK to a member of the opposite sex, but never ever ever ever discuss what is going on outside of camp with them. I spent my whole summer pretending I didn’t even know who Ben was. If the campers caught me speaking to him and asked me about it later on in the cabin, I would simply say ‘who is Ben? I don’t know anyone called Ben’. It drove them crazy but camp is all about them, not what their Counselors get up to during their time off camp.\n\nDon’t let camp relationships interfere with your job, or distract you from the real reason that you are at camp. You are there, first and foremost, to make sure the campers have the BEST summer of their lives. My camp director likes to call this ‘white and yellow square time’. The white square represents the most important reasons you are at camp; to teach campers, to have new experiences, to learn new things… while the yellow square represents personal reasons such as camp relationships and enjoying days off. The white square is much bigger than the yellow square, and you need to remember that throughout the summer.\n\nDon’t get caught! If you do end up being in a relationship at camp, make sure you keep it away from camp. Being caught in a compromising position with another staff member on camp property can lead to you being fired… and it’s totally not worth it!\n\nHappy Valentines day! xo\n\nSummer Camp vs Camp Rock\n\nSo if you follow me on Twitter (@how2survivecamp if you don’t!), you’ll know that I watched Camp Rock a couple of nights ago. As a huge fan of cheese and a good singalong film, I think Camp Rock is a GREAT film. 9 years later (can you believe it?!), I still have the songs on my iPod so the kids at camp can singalong during cabin clean up (I obviously NEVER listen to them outside of camp of course… *rolls eyes*).\n\nAnyhow, I decided to list all the similarities and differences between Camp Rock and real summer camp so all the newbies out there will know what to expect this summer. Here goes…\n\nSimilarities\n\nCamp Rock is set on a beautiful, picturesque lake. The majority of summer camps are set on a lake and the waterfront is a place where many of the activities on camp will take place.\n\nMitchie’s parents discuss at the beginning of the film that they can’t afford to send her because it’s too expensive. This is no joke – the majority of summer camps cost a FORTUNE for the campers!! Camps can range up to as much as $10,000 for an 8 week stay which is CRAZY, but totally worth it!\n\nMany camps are the summer home to the children of famous people. A couple of years ago I had the pleasure of meeting a certain Desperate Housewives star when she camp to drop her daughter off. Many celebrities themselves have too been to summer camps, such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Denzel Washington, Seth Rogan, Mark Zuckerberg and Zooey Deschanel.\n\nAt Camp Rock, Tess is the diva of the camp. Prepare yourself, all camps have diva’s (both campers and counselors).\n\nThe campers (and counselors) break out into random synchronised songs without any advance warning – especially during meal times. If you don’t like to sing, I suggest you spend the next couple of months either learning to love it or practising your lipsynching skills.\n\nDifferences\n\nThe campers at Camp Rock are all practically borderline adults. At real camp, campers ages can range from around 5 to 16 years old.\n\nTess rocks up to Camp Rock in a limo, sans parents. Campers usually get dropped off by their parents who swing by in their huge SUV’s that are so big, they make my Citroen C1 look like a toy car. I’m yet to see even the famous ones arrive by limo!\n\nI never saw anyone on Camp Rock lugging HUGE trunks out of the cars on Camp Rock, or sweating while they are trekking them across camp in the midday sun. Real camp is a lot less glamorous, and a lot more hard work on opening day!\n\nI’m yet to meet a camper who also works in the kitchen during his/her spare time! Campers are kept as far away as possible from the kitchen – counselors too for that matter!\n\nThe campers at Camp Rock seem to spend a lot of time unattended, whether in their rooms rehearsing or while eating their lunch in the dining hall. At camp, it’s rare the campers are ever alone without a Counselor in sight. Most camps don’t allow campers in the cabins during free time unless their is a Counselor present, and they are always accompanied at meals/during activities.\n\nAlthough campers often break into spontaneous, synchronised song, it’s rare that a dance ever accompanies it unlike at Camp Rock (unless you count the actions to the Banana song!). And I’ve never seen anyone dancing on the dining hall tables at my camp – there’s a stage for that!\n\nThe Counselors at Camp Rock (minus Shane Grey aka Joe Jonas) all seem pretty old to me. I find that the majority of Counselors at camp tend to be in their 20’s.\n\nGenerally you will find that the campers spend their free time making friendship bracelets and playing Tetherball (check out my Camp A-Z Glossary if you have no idea what Tetherball is!), rather than rehearsing labouriously for the upcoming talent show (although this has been known to happen!).\n\nThe cabins on Camp Rock look pretty cosy with a few single beds dotted around, rugs on the carpet and curtains on the windows. Usually camps aren’t quite this glamorous, and you might find yourself sleeping in a cabin with bunk beds and a carpeted floor if you’re lucky!\n\nCamps are usually a technology-free zone. The kids at Camp Rock have mobiles (aka ‘cell phones’) and laptops, which for me defeats the whole point of going to camp and getting away from the real world!\n\nThe campfire at Camp Rock is HUGE! Camps usually have a campfire circle surrounded by wooden benches that the campers/Counselors sit on. If the fire was that big at real camp, we would all be burning alive.\n\nThe campers at Camp Rock all look very clean and presentable with brushed hair and ironed clothes. Half the fun of summer camp is that you don’t have to worry about brushing your hair in the morning (until visiting day comes around of course!).\n\nSadly The Jonas Brothers don’t come with the camp package, and are yet to perform at the end of summer show at any real camp.\n\nSo although there are definitely more differences, Camp Rock is a great feel-good film to get you in the mood for a summer at camp. If you haven’t already watched it, give it a go!\n\nSummer Camp Packing List\n\nIf there is one thing I do know about in life (apart from summer camp, obvs), it’s packing. In my world, there is no such thing as over packing and I love to pack for all possible occasions. I have compiled a list of all the essential* things I take to camp and could not survive without each summer.\n\n*whether or not you consider things such as cabin decorations a ‘necessity’ is for you to decide!\n\nThe first debate is whether to take a suitcase or a rucksack. Personally I have always taken a suitcase to camp and so do most other people, but the choice is entirely yours. I have devised a Pro/Con list for both below to help you decide!\n\nSuitcase\n\nPros:\n\nGenerally larger than a rucksack – more room for that extra pair of shoes!\n\nMore room on the way there means there’s also more room on the way back to fit in all of your American purchases! Branded clothes in the U.S. are SO cheap compared to England, and people always expect presents!\n\nSuitcases have wheels – pretty self explanatory really.\n\nI find clothes tend to get less creased in a suitcase – no one wants to arrive at camp and have to start ironing!\n\nI like to take a small rucksack/day bag as hand luggage to use on days off etc., and a suitcase allows me room on my back to do so.\n\nCons:\n\nSuitcases have wheels. This is\n\nexcellent for when you arrive in America and have to wheel your case around the airport, but not so great when you arrive at camp and your suitcase refuses to wheel down the gravel driveway/over the tree roots surrounding your cabin.\n\nThere is not often not a whole lot of room in your cabin to store a huge suitcase for the summer.\n\nIf you’re planning on hiring a car/campervan to travel with friends after camp, fitting everyone and their suitcases in can be a tight squeeze! I speak from experience – it’s not fun!\n\nRucksack\n\nPros:\n\nRucksacks are great when you arrive at camp and there are zero paths in sight to wheel a suitcase on!\n\nLimited space in a rucksack means you have to be choosier about the things you take, and can prevent overpacking.\n\nThey fold/store easier than a rigid suitcase.\n\nThey are useful for if you want to continue to travel after camp. This year I am planning on going to Australia straight after camp, so will be taking a rucksack for onwards travel.\n\nCons:\n\nI like to make the most of the 23kg luggage allowance on offer (because why not?!). As a 5ft 2 (OK, 5 foot 1 and a half) female, carrying 23 kg’s on your back is no easy challenge.\n\nSee above comment about creased clothes.\n\nSee above comment about small daysack. No one wants to be that person wearing two rucksacks, right?!\n\nSo, you see the dilemma. The pro’s of the suitcase have always outweighed the con’s for myself, which is why I have always taken a suitcase. This year, I will be taking both (my rucksack is going inside the suitcase until it is needed in September!). Make the right choice for you!\n\nNow for the important part – what to pack. Let’s start with the essentials – clothes. Here is what I would typically take with me for a summer at camp. I have split it into two sections; camp clothes and off-camp clothes. Camp clothes should be things that you aren’t afraid to get dirty or covered in paint, and clothes that you might not necessarily bring home with you at the end of summer. Off-camp clothes are things to wear for your days/nights off, and for your post-camp travels.\n\nClothes\n\nCamp Clothes\n\nShorts.\n\nI would recommend around 7 pairs of shorts. I usually take sports shorts to wear at camp, as they are lightweight, easy to move in and keep you cool in the sun.\n\nYou may need a certain type of shorts for occasions such as Opening Day – for example, my camp requires us to wear khaki coloured cargo shorts on Opening Day. Make sure to ask your Camp Director before you leave for camp!\n\nShirts.\n\nYou will more than likely be given staff t-shirts to wear around camp each day – check with your camp or ask previous staff.\n\nIf it is your first time at camp, and you don’t have old staff shirts to wear, I would take 3/4 t-shirts that you can wear during pre-camp/staff training.\n\nI also pack a plain white t-shirt and a plain black t-shirt. Lots of camps play games that involve being in teams, so plain, cheap t-shirts (head to Primark!) always come in handy. You may even end up tie dying the white one at some point during the summer – camps love tie dye!\n\nHoodies/Jumpers.\n\nCamps often sell/give staff a camp hoodie, so I would pack 1/2 other jumpers/hoodies that you can wear around camp in the evening when it gets cooler.\n\nJacket.\n\nWhen it rains in America, it really rains! Make sure you pack a good lightweight, waterproof jacket for rainy days.\n\nBathing Suits.\n\nI take 2 bathing suits that are acceptable to wear around the campers. Some camps only allow you to wear one piece swimming costumes on camp – check with the camp before you arrive. I suggest two as one may not dry in time to be worn again – and no one likes putting on damp swimwear!\n\nPyjamas.\n\nI take around 3 pairs of short pyjamas, plus a full length pair. Although it sounds crazy, early June in America can be COLD at night. I made the mistake of just taking shorts in my first year and was so cold when I went to bed at night, I ended up lending someone else’s pyjama bottoms.\n\nPants/Socks/Bras.\n\nAlthough laundry is done weekly when the campers arrive, it may not be done as often before then. I normally take around 15-20 pairs of pants (just to be safe!).\n\nAt least 10 pairs of socks – they always go missing or shrink in the laundry! I usually take sports socks that are comfortable and I can wear with my trainers.\n\nI take around 4/5 sports bras, plus around 3/4 ‘normal’ or ‘bralette’ style bras.\n\nShoes.\n\nI take 2 pairs of trainers with me – one older pair that I don’t mind getting paint on during evening activities and one nicer pair to wear at my activity.\n\nCROCS! I know I’ve said it a million times, but I can’t tell you how valuable Crocs are at camp. Until recently, my camp did not allow open-toed shoes in the dining hall. Wearing trainers all the time in 30 degrees heat can result in some seriously sweaty feet, and there is nothing better than taking your shoes off and putting on your Crocs after a long day.\n\nFlips flops – a must for the camp showers.\n\nAccessories.\n\nWaterproof watch.\n\nHat.\n\nSunglasses.\n\nIf you are a returner, you may also want to pack any camp/tribal clothes from previous years at camp.\n\nOff-Camp Clothes\n\nI would normally take around 6/7 outfits that I can mix and match to wear off of camp. These normally include:\n\n5/6 Tops – vests/shirts/t-shirts.\n\n4/5 Bottoms – denim shorts, patterned shorts, skirts etc.\n\n3 Casual Dresses/Playsuits.\n\n1 Smart Dress – formal wear for the end of camp meal etc.\n\n1/2 Pairs of Jeans – I usually take one pair of black skinnies and a blue pair.\n\nJacket/Cardigan – something to wear on your nights off when it is cooler in the evening.\n\nShoes.\n\n1 pair of Converse.\n\n1/2 pair of smart flats/sandals.\n\nAccessories.\n\nSunglasses.\n\nJewellry\n\nRemember, you can always borrow other Counselors off-camp clothes (if you make friends with people of the same size) – permission granted!\n\nToiletries\n\nCamps usually do a staff trip to the local Walmart/Target during staff training, so don’t waste your luggage allowance taking huge bottles of shampoo etc! Toiletries are pretty cheap over there too and come in HUGE sizes (like everything else in America) that will provide you with enough to last you the whole summer. Here are the toiletries/accessories I take with me to camp:\n\nShampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, contact lens solution (all travel sized).\n\nToothbrush.\n\nRazor.\n\nDeodorant – A word of advice, spray deodorant is SO expensive in America. Why, I hear you ask? I HAVE NO IDEA! The majority of Americans use roll-on, so I like to take enough spray deodorant to last me the summer.\n\nHairbrush/bobbles/hair grips.\n\nFace wipes.\n\nContact lenses – make sure you take enough to last you the whole summer and a few extra in case of any mishaps. If you wear monthlies, consider taking a few dailies for day off trips to the lake etc.\n\nAny tablets/pills/creams you will need throughout the summer.\n\nMake up.\n\nTweezers\n\nNail clippers/scissors.\n\nSunscreen. You can buy this in the States of course, but I find it to be cheaper in England and buy a couple of bottles to take with me each year.\n\nThings I buy once I arrive:\n\nAll of the travel sized items above, in full size.\n\nShaving cream.\n\nRazors.\n\nFace wash.\n\nNail polish remover.\n\nCotton wool pads.\n\nFemale hygiene products.\n\nCotton buds (or Q Tips as the Americans call them!).\n\nBug spray.\n\nMoisturiser\n\nExtras\n\nWithout a doubt, 50% of my suitcase is filled up with junk from this ‘extras’ category. The below are not mandatory, but may make your time at camp much more enjoyable.\n\nPictures/photographs to decorate your cabin. Campers love to see photographs of who you have left back at home (especially any pets!), and the photos will cheer you up if you are ever having any fed-up moments (it happens to us all).\n\nDecorations for the cabin. I like to pin up flags and hang bunting around the cabin to give it a ‘homely’ feel.\n\nA toy/stuffed animal – meet Pierre, my #1 travel companion and great distractor for homesick campers! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nA small rucksack (for days off etc. as mentioned above).\n\nWater bottle.\n\nFlashlight/torch.\n\nJournal\n\nCamera (plus any necessary batteries).\n\nChargers (phone/camera etc.).\n\nSocket adapters.\n\nGames to keep your campers entertained on rainy days (I LOVE Dobble/Uno/any card game that can keep them quiet (ish) for hours!).\n\nHeadphones.\n\nSpeakers. I like to play music during cabin clean up to motivate the campers in a morning!\n\niPod.\n\nNail varnish.\n\nBooks/Kindle.\n\nBeach Towel (for days off at the beach/lake).\n\nFancy dress items. I LOVE fancy dress, so I take many outfits and props that can be used for different costumes. This can include face paints, wands, plastic glasses, crazy hats, hair accessories and much more – use your imagination! You may also want to bring something American themed for the 4th of July celebrations!\n\nTravel documents – IMPORTANT!!! Make sure you have your passport, visa papers and any other document you may need to travel.\n\nInternational Driving License. If you plan on hiring a car in the USA, many companies require you to have an International Driving Licence. You can purchase one of these for just £5.50 at selected Post Office Branches.\n\nExtras you can buy at once you arrive at camp:\n\nThe following definitely aren’t essentials, but may make your time at camp much more comfortable/enjoyable.\n\nUnderbed storage boxes.\n\nShoe rack.\n\nMattress topper – camp beds aren’t exactly known for their comfort!\n\nClip-on fan (a lifesaver in the summer heat!).\n\nFriendship bracelet string.\n\nDuck tape.\n\nWater bottle.\n\nStationery set.\n\nInflatables -everyone loves a lilo on a day off!\n\nShower caddy (to store all your toiletries in – makes like 100x easier when you are traipsing across camp to the showers!).\n\nThings camp normally provide for you:\n\nDouble check with your camp before you arrive, but international Counselors are usually provided with the following:\n\nBedding/sleeping bag.\n\nShower towels.\n\nLaundry bag.\n\nWell, that about sums up my camp packing list! My advice would be to write your name on absolutely EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!! Camps usually hire a company do collect and wash the laundry each week, and things often get mixed up in wash bags etc. Happy packing!\n\nCounselor Files: Amy Llewellyn\n\nAmy (more commonly known as Amy Vid) has spent her past two summers at sunny Camp Chinqueka, a girls sleepaway camp in Connecticut, and is already looking forward to a third! Find out what she loves about camp, and her advice to people thinking about applying for summer 2017.\n\n1. What is/was your role at camp?\n\nI am the Video Counselor at camp. My role is not only to take video as an activity and teach the girls all I know about video and video making, but also to film all the amazing and fun stuff that happens daily at camp. Once I have filmed it, I then put it all together into a bunch of fun videos for the campers to watch at the end of their time at camp, and throughout the year when they get a little camp sick and want to reminisce – or have a laugh!\n\n2. Why did you decide to work at a summer camp?\n\nI decided to work at a summer camp for a number of reasons. First, I was looking for a new adventure / challenge. Second, I love travelling (I haven’t spent as long as a year in England since i left university!) and third, I LOVE kids. I was considering going into teaching as a profession, but wasn’t sure whether or not it was for me. I decided a summer camp would give me a good insight into working with children whilst being an adventure for me too.\n\n3. Which agency did you apply through, and would you recommend them to a friend?\n\nI went with Camp America. I would recommend doing your research and finding the best agency for you as each one will work differently. Camp America was best for me as they were so helpful, the application was easy to fill in and they organise everything for you from booking your flights to meeting you at the airport and making sure you have a smooth journey to camp. If you’re more confident / independent, there are other agencies out there that do less and cost less! Check all your options…\n\n4. What is the best thing about being a Camp Counselor?\n\nThe best thing about being a Camp Counselor is the feeling you get when you know you have changed a child’s life for the better. Whether it be from a letter they send you after camp, a message begging you to come back next summer, or just seeing them grow and develop throughout their time with you at camp – and of course the mass amounts of fun you have every single day.\n\n5. What is the worst thing about being a Camp Counselor?\n\nThat it only lasts for 3 months of the year and cannot be considered your permanent job! Although if it were, you would be truly truly EXHAUSTED.\n\n6. What is your favourite camp memory?\n\nMy favourite camp memory would have to be the moment when a camper who had been terribly homesick during her time at camp (and I had tried my best to comfort / distract over the session) said to me so flippantly and with a genuine smile on her face ‘when i go back to sleep away camp..’. It was a great feeling knowing I had helped change her mind about camp!\n\n7. What are three items that you could not live without at camp?\n\nBugspray\n\nAt least one fancy dress/ silly outfit\n\nEnglish teabags & chocolate.\n\n8. Do you have any advice for people applying to work at a summer camp?\n\nWhilst the application may seem long and difficult, it is totally worth it!! The application has to be difficult because remember, you’re about to spend your summer being responsible for so many parents’ pride and joy – their whole world – it’s a big deal! Be the best Counselor that you possibly can, be the Counselor that campers are still raving about to their friends/family at Christmas, that gets letters and messages from campers begging you to return to camp. And make the most of it!\n\nCounselor Files: Jess Toogood\n\nJess (more commonly known at camp as ‘DooWop’) is 22 years old and works at Camp Conowingo, a Girl Scout camp, in Maryland. She has worked there for the past three summers and when asked about returning in 2017, Jess says ‘summer number 4, I’m coming for ya!’.\n\nHere is what Jess has to say about her summers spent in the USA…\n\n1. What is/was your role at camp?\n\nI have actually had a different role every summer I have been at camp. My first summer, I was a Unit counselor, looking after the girls each week, taking them to their activities and keeping them safe. I was also High Ropes trained my first year so I helped up on the Ropes Course when my girls were there.\n\nMy second summer I was STEM Manager (Science Technology Engineering & Maths), ‘teaching’ STEM to the girls. I was also Kayak, Canoe and Archery trained so would run sessions in those areas as well.\n\nMy third summer I moved back into units but this time as a Unit Leader. It was the same role as in my first summer but I was also supervising the UC’s and would be their first port of call if they had any issues.\n\nThis summer, I will be the CIT/JC Unit Leader, training up the next generation of counselors\n\n2. What is a Girl Scout camp?\n\nA Girl Scout camp is very rustic. For example, we only have 4 flushing toilets in the pool house that the girls can only use when they are at the pool. All the other times, they either have to use a latrine or a port-o-potty. So it’s not for everyone, but I love it. We also have cookout every Wednesday where the girls plan their meal and then cook it over a fire. We’re also all about inspiring the next generation of girls and hopefully open their eyes up to several possibilities that their futures hold. We run sessions such as STEM, Nature, Sport, Archery and Rockwall, as well as giving the Unit Time to plan their own activities relevant to the theme of the session.\n\n3. Do you need to be a Brownie/Guide to work at a Girl Scout Camp?\n\nAbsolutely not, no.\n\n4. I heard that at Girl Scout Camps, you all have nicknames as the campers can’t know your real name. Is this true?\n\nThat is true! We use nicknames so we\n\naren’t a ‘best friend’ to the girls. The camps didn’t want something too professional such as ‘Madam’, or a name with too much power such as ‘Mom’, so we all have nicknames. My nickname is DooWop which my brothers gave to me but others range from things like Red and Ringo, all the way through to everyday nicknames such as Coco.\n\n5. What is the daily routine like at camp?\n\nOur daily routine is pretty standard. Depending on how far away from main camp you are and how slow your kids are at getting ready depends on what time you get up, but you just gotta make sure you’re down at the dining hall for flag at 7.45. Breakfast finishes at 9 and then it’s into sessions. Lunch is 12.30 and then rest hour is 1.30. Sessions carry on at 2.30 until flag at 5.45. Dinner then happens and there are 2 more sessions before bed. Each session is an hour and a half long. On Thursday’s we have all camp activities, ranging from a Beauty Pageant to a 4th of July Carnival to Campers vs Counselors Capture the Flag.\n\n6. What is your favourite thing about working at a summer camp?\n\nI absolutely love the people that are drawn to camp. My best friends are people that I met at camp and even though they are majorly long distance friendships, they are some of the best friendships I’ve ever had. Also, the feeling of making a kids summer is completely unlike anything else.\n\n7. If you could change one thing about summer camp, what would it be?\n\nMake it last all year round.\n\n8. What are three items you couldn’t live without at camp?\n\nCROCS – I love my crocs a lot and every year I get asked by new internationals what is something they should definitely pack and when I say Crocs, I always get laughed at. Then when we hit week 3 or 4, they’re getting their own pair!\n\nCamera – I am a picture fiend and will always take as many photos as possible until it annoys someone. Also, how else are you gonna keep your insta feed popping?\n\nHead torch – or a ‘flash light’. This is especially important for us ’cause we have no electricity on our campsites and aren’t allowed phones in front of the kids, so when you have a homesick camper you want to be able to see them! Also, no one likes going to the toilet in the dark…\n\n9. What are your favourite ages campers and why?\n\nI LOVE the older kids (15+), they give me such joy and I feel like I can make the most difference with them. Younger kids are nice and all but there’s only so many times I can sing Frozen to keep them happy.\n\n10. If you had one piece of advice for people thinking of applying to work at a summer camp in 2017, what would it be?\n\nDO IT! As cliché as it sounds, it will be the best summer of your life and you will meet some of the most incredible people and experience some incredible things.\n\nThe Reality of Returning Home from Summer Camp\n\nSo another summer is over (*sobs*), and the majority of camp counselors all over the world have now returned home. Here is the depressing/miserable/gloomy (insert any synonym for sad) reality of returning home from summer camp…\n\nNobody wants to sing with you at meal times.\n\nAnd all think you are crazy when you suggest singing the ‘Superman’ Grace before a meal.\n\nYou no longer have a lake…\n\n… or a blob!\n\nBack to English portion sizes.\n\nAmerican food at home costs a fortune.\n\nLucky Charms, Peanut Butter M&M’s, Cheetos… the list is endless.\n\nYou need a REASON to wear a fancy dress outfit.\n\nLuckily, Halloween is on the way!\n\nOne word: rain.\n\nNo explanation needed.\n\nAnd why is it so cold in this country?\n\nBack to lectures.\n\nOr even worse still, back to work.\n\nSo there you have it. The reality of returning home after camp is not great, HOWEVER, there is all of this to look forward to next year. Check out my ‘before camp’ section if you are interested in working at a summer camp, but prepare yourself for all of this when you get back home – trust me, its worth it!!\n\nA Day in the Life of a Camp Counselor\n\nSo if you have never been to camp before, you may be wondering what you get up to day to day. Below I have laid out the daily schedule at my camp (although I believe most camps will have a similar schedule!). Most camps have some form of a bugle/bell system to ensure that the whole camp is running on the same time! Although it seems very hectic, there are actually times in the day where you do get to breathe a little and process your thoughts.\n\nDaily Schedule (remember, this will vary slightly from camp to camp).\n\n7.25 am – First Call.\n\nThis is the first bugle of the day and is in place to wake everyone up, ready for the busy day ahead!\n\n7.30 am – Reveille\n\nThis is the second bugle of the day, meaning now is definitely the time to wake up and get out of bed (if you haven’t already!).\n\n7.50 am – Flag Circle\n\nA lot of summer camps will raise the American flag up the flag pole every morning. The campers and counselors all stand around the flag circle while the flag is raised, often to the American National Anthem.\n\n8.00 am – Breakfast\n\nBreakfast is a feast of American cereal (hello Lucky Charms, Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks!), and hot breakfast items. A time to energize before the crazy morning ahead!\n\n8.45 am – Squads\n\nAll staff and campers are assigned an area on camp to clean, and this area is rotated daily for campers. It may be emptying trash, helping to clean the showers or sweeping the dining hall floor.\n\n9.00 am – Cabin Cleanup\n\nThe campers return to their cabins to make their beds, tidy their trunks and ensure that the cabin is nice and clean ready for cabin inspections! The cabin with the most points at the end of the week wins a PIZZA PARTY!!!! Best. Prize. Ever.\n\n9.30 am – Morning Activities\n\nThis may differ at camps, but my camp has 3 x 50 minute activity periods in a morning. The campers are assigned activities with their bunks/cabins, and they must go to the activity assigned to them. There are a HUGE range of activities on camp, such as Sports, Arts and Crafts, Ropes, Fencing and many many more. The campers at my camp have one period every morning at the Waterfront, having swimming or boating lessons, but this will be different at every camp! This is your time to teach the campers different skills and make them want to sign up to your activity later on in the day!\n\n12 pm – Free Time\n\nPhew, you made it through the morning!! Now its time to chill out, catch up with other staff on how their mornings went or hang out with the kids on the playground!\n\n12.25 pm – Lunch\n\nAfter all the morning fun, you will be STARVING by lunch time! Lunch often involves soup, a hot meal and the best part – pudding! A lot of camps also have a salad bar if you are looking for an alternative or a more healthy option!\n\n1.15 pm – Sign Ups\n\nAfter lunch, the campers have the chance to sign up for two afternoon electives. The campers can pick any activity for these periods, so make sure you have something fun planned so you get lots of sign ups!\n\n1.30 pm – Rest Hour\n\nIf you don’t already know, rest hour is the BEST hour! Campers and staff return to their cabins for a quiet hour in the middle of the day when it is the hottest. The older the campers get, the more likely they are to nap which means you can too (YAY!). Junior campers often don’t see the point in rest hour, as they are ALWAYS full of energy! The campers can read, write letters home or make friendship bracelets if they’re not tired. Trust me, you will be!\n\n2.30 pm – Candy Canteen\n\nSo the campers have had an hour to calm down, and now its time to get them going again before their afternoon of fun electives!\n\n3 pm – Afternoon Electives\n\nMy camp has 2 x 1 hour electives in the afternoon, but this will vary at different camps. Try to vary the things you do each day to keep the activity fresh and keep campers wanting to sign up!\n\n5 pm – Free Time\n\nMore free time, woohoo! A great time to hang out in the staff lounge and maybe a chance to Skype your parents (before they forget who you are), enjoy the staff swim in the lake or FINALLY have a much-needed shower!\n\n5.50pm – Flag Circle\n\nAs the day comes to an end, its time to lower the flag for the day before dinner.\n\n6pm – Dinner\n\nSome camps have a canteen-style approach, where campers line up and collect their own food. Other camps have assigned tables where the campers take turn at being ‘waiter’, and the table eats ‘family-style’. Dinner is more hot food and more pudding, again with the salad bar option.\n\n7pm – Evening Activity\n\nEach evening consists of an evening activity to entertain the campers. This can be anything from a traditional campfire, talent shows, awards events or whole camp games such as Capture the Flag. This is ended by the singing of ‘Taps’ before the campers return to their cabins. Evening activities are often where fancy dress items come in handy!\n\n8.30pm – Cabin Time\n\nThe campers often have time to get ready for bed/wash/brush their teeth before lights out/flashlight time. Lights out time varies depending on age, but is often between 9-10pm.\n\nSo there you have it! A day in the life of a camp counselor. As you can see, each day is jam packed, and it is important that everything runs on time. Sundays at my camp were often more relaxed, with a later breakfast and time for a swim. And of course, each week you get one much-needed day off where you can explore local sights/parks, or hang around camp and try to catch up on some sleep!"
