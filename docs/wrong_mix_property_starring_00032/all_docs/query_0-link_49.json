        "text": "After four years of marriage, Joe Jonas has filed for divorce from Sophie Turner.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers singer filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on Tuesday (Sept. 5) that stated “the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.”\n\nThe news comes amid a firestorm of rumors alleging a breakup, but both Jonas’ and Turner’s social media activity seemed to indicate that there was no merit to the divorce reports. On Monday, Jonas posted a photo that not-so-subtly flaunted his wedding ring days after divorce rumors reached a fever pitch. As for Turner, her most recent Instagram post, dated Aug. 14, celebrated Jonas and his brothers’ latest world tour. On Aug. 12, the Grammy-nominated trio kicked off their massive “Five Albums. One Night. The World Tour” trek at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York.\n\nNonetheless, the court documents, which were filed in Miami-Dade County, Florida, reveal a different story. Jonas’ petition states that the couple’s two children have been residing with him in Miami and other U.S. locations but that “it is in the best interests of the minor children that the parties have shared parental responsibility.” Moreover, his petition indicates some kind of prenuptial agreement between the couple.\n\nBillboard has reached out to reps for both Jonas and Turner, as well as Jonas’ lawyer.\n\nJonas and Turner first met in 2016. They were engaged the following year and married in 2019. The couple legally married in Las Vegas in May 2019, a month before having a full ceremony with friends and family at Chateau de Tourreau in the south of France. Jonas and Turner share two children: daughter Willa and a second daughter who arrived in July and whose name is yet to be revealed.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers have amassed six top 10 albums on the Billboard 200, including three No. 1s. The sibling band has also scored three top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including the 2019 No. 1 hit “Sucker.”\n\nJoe Jonas’ band DNCE has charted a pair of projects on the Billboard 200. Their self-titled debut studio album topped out at No. 17 and spawned the Hot 100 top 10 hit “Cake by the Ocean.” As a soloist, Jonas reached No. 15 on the Billboard 200 with his debut album and No. 9 on the Hot 100 with the Camp Rock soundtrack single “This Is Me” (with Demi Lovato)."
