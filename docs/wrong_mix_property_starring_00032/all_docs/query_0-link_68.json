        "text": "Joe Jonas auditioned for the role of Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-Man back in 2010, and while he admits to being destroyed when the role ultimately went to Andrew Garfield, he holds no regrets. And even though the franchise made over a billion dollars from its box-office collections, Jonas still holds his head high, not for the lost opportunity, but for the experience learned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Jonas is an American multi-talented artist who has made his mark as a singer, songwriter, and actor. The pop rock group he created with his elder brothers, Nick and Kevin, is the one for which he is most well-known, the Jonas Brothers. The Jonas Brothers had great success in the 2000s, putting out multiple hit albums and hosting their own Disney Channel series, Jonas.\n\nAlso read: From Joe Jonas to Jake Gyllenhaal, 5 Ex-boyfriends of Taylor Swift Who Became the Victims of Her Songs After Breakup\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Jonas Swings for Spidey but Webs Go to Andrew Garfield\n\nEven if Joe Jonas isn’t exactly a spider web thrower on TV, he doesn’t harbor any resentment. He remembers his audition for the lead part in the 2012 movie The Amazing Spider-Man, which eventually went to Andrew Garfield on a podcast via Us Magazine. Even though the movie franchise made an incredible $8.9 billion at the box office, Jonas is not sorry about the chance lost.\n\n“In the moment, you’re destroyed or you’re defeated. But you realize this person was brilliant. I remember years ago I was up for Spider-Man and I was so, so excited and it was the year Andrew Garfield got it.\n\nObviously, he was the right one. I was like, ‘I got an in here’. But you know what? I love the process of auditioning and putting yourself out there and having to prove yourself.”\n\nThe web-slinging responsibilities were meant for Garfield, despite Jonas’s intense love for the part, and he accepts this with grace. Fans of Garfield’s eccentric and passionate interpretation of the web-slinging hero agree with this sentiment. Even though Jonas may not have taken on the role of Spider-Man, it’s obvious that his acting career is only getting started.\n\nAlso read: “He never wanted to break up his family”: Heartbreaking Truth About Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s Marriage Comes Out After They File For Divorce\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is demonstrating his versatility and commitment to the profession with his part in the upcoming military drama Devotion. Therefore, even though we might not witness Joe Jonas flying between buildings while sporting red and blue tights, his acting career seems to have a bright and interesting future. Even while the Spider-Man franchise’s billion-dollar movie office gain may have been alluring, Jonas’ career in the field is still developing."
