        "text": "Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato’s joint “Future Now” tour is well underway. As if we weren’t excited enough, the Lovato/Jonas collaboration was just kicked up a notch. Actually, scratch that — several notches.\n\nLast night at Demi and Nick’s Washington D.C. show, they had a very special guest join them onstage. Joe Jonas — you know, Nick’s brother and Demi’s ex-boyfriend and former costar — hopped up onstage to sing with the duo. And the fans weren’t the only ones who were surprised because it seems like Demi had literally NO idea that this was coming.\n\nWhen Joe took the stage, Demi had a priceless expression of complete shock. Joe immediately started singing “Gotta Find You”, the song that he and Demi sang together in Camp Rock. Demi joined in after a while, and it was the ultimate throwback to their Disney days. Nick also sang along and played guitar.\n\nAfter they finished that song, Demi and Joe hugged it out while fans screamed in excitement. Joe took the mic and said, “Now that we’re done with that sentimental bullsh*t, let’s have some fun!” He then performed DNCE’s hit “Cake By The Ocean” alongside his brother.\n\nJoe and Demi also sang “This Is Me” from Camp Rock, with Nick on guitar, to add the finishing touches to the nostalgic performance.\n\nJoe tweeted today that he will “never forget” sharing the stage with Nick and Demi.\n\nYou can watch the performances below!"
