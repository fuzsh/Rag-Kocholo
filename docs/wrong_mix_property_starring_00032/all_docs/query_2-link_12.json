        "text": "Camp Rock offers summer camp for children ages 4 years old (fully potty trained) up to age 12 years. Campers are grouped by age. Some ages will be combined based on class size and summer camp registration. Camp Rock does not provide one-on-one assistance for campers.\n\nThe following age groups are more likelly to have activities scheduled around the same time (i.e. Lunch Shift, Special Guests, Presentations):\n\n4-5 Years (Must be age on the date of 1st attendance and fully potty trained)\n\n6-7 Years\n\n8-9 Years\n\n10-12 Years\n\n\"LEADERS-IN-TRAINING\" PROGRAM (L.I.T.)\n\n\"Leaders in Training Program\" (Ages 13-15) Previously enrolled campers who are now 13 yrs. old may apply to be a part of the \"Leaders in Training\" program. A limited number of teens will be selected each summer to participate. L.I.T. Candidates may select one or more of the following leadership pathways: Logistics & Facilities Management, Business Management, Culinary Arts, or Child Development.\n\nCamp Rock's day officially begins by 8:30 AM. We offer before-care services from 7-8 AM. All campers enrolled in the before care program must be dropped off by no later than 7:30 AM. Campers arriving after 7:30 AM will need to wait in the car line that begins at the assigned times:\n\nCampers arriving late (after 8:30 a.m.) must be walked to the office by their parents. We do ask that all campers arrive by no later than 8:30 a.m. so that they do not miss their assigned activity times.\n\nCampers will be dropped-off and picked-up as follows:\n\n• A-G: Drop Off – 8:00 a.m., Pick Up: 3:45 p.m.\n\n• H-N: Drop Off – 8:10 a.m., Pick Up: 4:00 p.m.\n\n• O-Z: Drop Off – 8:20 a.m., Pick Up: 4:15 p.m.\n\nCampers must be picked up by their assigned pick up times to avoid late pick-up fees. Early dismissals from camp must be scheduled in advance with the camp office. We will not be able to accomodate early dismissals after 3:00 p.m. Campers will need to wait for their assigned dismissal times.\n\nOur summer camp curbside drop off and pick up times are listed below:\n\nBefore Care (additional cost or package selections): 7-8 AM (Drop off ends @ 7:30 AM)\n\nCamp Morning Arrival Drop-Off: 8:00-8:30 AM (Please be on-time for camp)\n\nCamp Dismissal Pick-Up Window: 4:00-4:30 PM (assigned times)\n\nAfter Care (additional cost or package selection): 4:00-6:00 p.m.\n\nCampers may bring their own lunch and or purchase a weekly hot lunch pass. Camp lunches are served at summer camp each day.\n\nNEW!!! Dinner- Campers and parents may purchase dinner from \"Martha's Kitchen.\" Please visit www.marthas2go.com to order or learn more!\n\nA snack will be provided daily to campers. We also have a \"Snack Shack\" available for campers to purchase snacks in addition to their lunch during their lunch period. Campers may bring cash, load funds onto their Camp Rock account, or purchase a \"Camp Rock Snack Shack Go Pass\" to the Snack Shack. The \"Snack Shack Go Pass\" enables cardholders to receive discounted snowballs, a weekly prize, and a daily standard item from the Snack Shack.\n\nCampers bringing lunch should note the following stipulations:\n\nWe are a \"NUT FREE\" facility: we do have various campers and staff with nut allergies. No food is permitted containing nuts! Sunbutter is permissible!\n\nCampers bringing lunch should be able to prep their meal and manage their meals on their own. Please pack items that your child can easily open to minimize food handling.\n\nCampers will NOT have access to heat their food. Please place items needing to remain at a warm temperature inside a thermos or temperature-controlled container.\n\nCampers should have their lunch box containers clearly labeled with their full name.\n\nPlease utilize cooling aids for lunches requiring cooling outside of \"cool room temperatures.\"\n\nDinner- Campers and parents may purchase dinner from \"Martha's Kitchen.\" Please visit www.marthas2go.com to order or learn more!"
