Purchased in 2021, the celebrity lovebirds chose this stately residence as a primary location to settle down and raise their two young daughters. Their firstborn daughter Willa was born in 2020, and her little sister joined the family in 2022; the celebrity couple has been known to keep their family matters private, and their newborn daughter’s name has yet to be disclosed.\n\nAfter two years of living in this stunning home, the couple made a profit of US$4 million (approximately S$5.43 million) when the property was recently sold to a private buyer for US$15 million (approximately S$20.36 million). Inspired by the iconic mid-century modern work of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the six-bedroom property has a remarkable build. It boasts floor-to-ceiling glass panels throughout the abode, and comes fitted with nine bathrooms, a pool, jacuzzi, and a separate children’s pool. There is even a private yacht berth with direct access to the bay and ocean.\n\nTap our link in bio to see more. \n\n-\nphotography Michael Stavaridis and Alex Tarajano\n\n#tatlerhomes\".",
