        "text": "In Vanity Fair's popular lie detector video series, Joe Jonas revealed some interesting facts about himself.\n\nOne of the most notable was his reaction to being asked if he would date Pete Davidson and Kanye West.\n\nWhen asked about Pete, Jonas didn't hesitate to answer, \"Yes.\"\n\nHowever, when asked about Kanye, Jonas answered \"No,\" with a chuckle.\n\nThe humorous clip has gone viral on TikTok, and brings back a joke that Jonas' wife Sophie Turner made during a roast.\n\nJonas and Turner frequently have fun poking fun at one another and garnering comments about how \"iconic\" they are, and it seems fans have rightfully concluded the couple are made for each other.\n\nThat was further illustrated in the 2021 Netflix comedy special The Jonas Brothers Family Roast, when Turner told Joe not to wait up for her, because “Pete Davidson slipped me his phone number.\"\n\nThe joke followed the appearance of Davidson in the audience, dressed as a JoBros super fan.\n\n\"A Little Bit Longer is both my favorite album, and what Sophie wishes Joe’s penis was... Winter is coming, Sophie not so much,\" Davidson joked during the short appearance.\n\nOne commenter on TikTok pointed out that Jonas' response to being asked about dating Pete or Kanye was true.\n\n\"Lie detector determined he was telling the truth,\" they said.\n\nAnother person joked, \"I feel like Joe and Sophie give strong bi couple vibes lol.\"\n\n\"Celebrities: they’re just like us!\" someone else said.\n\nOne commenter summed up the video with, \"Valid points have been made.\"\n\nThe interview also featured questions about Jonas' brothers, Nick, Kevin, and Frankie, and their lives growing up as Disney Channel stars, including their show JONAS, which Joe said he doesn't regret.\n\nWatch the full lie detector interview, below:"
