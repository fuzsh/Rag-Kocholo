        "text": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner have been one of the most loved couples in Hollywood since they got together in 2016, but the pair have now confirmed that they are ending their marriage.\n\nOn 5 September 2023 Joe Jonas filed for divorce after four years of marriage citing, 'The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken'.\n\nThe following day both Joe and Sophie posted the same statement on their Instagram accounts: 'After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage. There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.'\n\nComments were disabled on both posts.\n\nWhen the pair first met seven years ago, their respective fanbases were delighted the Jonas Brothers and Game of Thrones crossover, and they went on to have two children together.\n\nBut how did Joe and Sophie meet? And when did they get married? Here is the duo's complete relationship timeline.\n\n2016: How did Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner meet?\n\nHow did the former couple actually meet? Well it was a good old DM slide on Instagram, back in 2016, that marked the beginning of their love story.\n\n'We had a lot of mutual friends, and they'd been trying to introduce us for a long time,' Northampton-born Sophie, 27, recalled to Harper's Bazaar.\n\nShe added, 'We were following each other on Instagram and he direct messaged me one fine day, out of the blue.'\n\nFrom there, the musician, 34, invited Sophie to hang out when his tour reached the UK. After her friends admitted they found it 'hilarious', they convinced her to go.\n\nThe pair agreed to meet up at a bar, but the TV star confessed that she brought her 'rugby boys' along for safety (in case this Joe Jonas wasn't the Joe Jonas).\n\nShe was pleasantly surprised to find that he brought along no entourage, just a friend.\n\nShe expanded in an interview with ELLE, 'I remember us two spending only a couple of minutes on the dance floor, and then we found a space in the far corner and we just talked. We talked for hours, and hours, and hours. And I wasn’t bored. It wasn’t contrived, it wasn’t small talk - it was just so easy. Soon, we were inseparable. And then I went on tour with him.'\n\nAnd the rest was history. The duo even became the poster couple for the term 'short king' after fans realised that Joe Jonas is 5'7\" whilst Sophie Turner stands at 5'9\".\n\nNovember 2016: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are spotted at a Kings of Leon concert\n\nThey had not gone public with their relationship by this point, but fans spotted them having a whale of a time at a Kings of Leon gig in Amsterdam.\n\nA concertgoer noted, 'When the lights went down and Kings of Leon started they were dancing together and singing along. Joe would kiss her cheek as they danced next to each other.'\n\nDecember 2016: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are confirmed to be dating\n\nAfter spending Thanksgiving weekend together, a source confirmed to People that Joe and Sophie were together.\n\n'They're dating exclusively. [Joe] was playing the field, but he really likes her and is willing to settle down for her,' the insider shared.\n\nJanuary 2017: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner make it Instagram official\n\nSophie kickstarted the new year by sharing Joe for the first time on her Instagram - always a big step in any relationship!\n\nUnderneath an image of him smoking a cigar on a boat, the actress wrote, 'Miami Daze'.\n\nSeptember 2017: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner adopt a dog\n\nThe couple welcomed a new member to the family, a Siberian Husky puppy named Porky Basquiat. Just a few months later, they became dog parents for a second time when they brought home Porky's brother, Waldo Picasso.\n\nOctober 2017: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner announce their engagement\n\nA year after finding an instant spark, the couple announced they were engaged.\n\nJoe fittingly captioned an image of his fiancée's ring, 'She said yes', while Sophie wrote, 'I said yes.'\n\nThe post clocked up plenty of interaction from fans and loved ones, with Joe's brother Nick writing, 'Ahh! Congratulations to my brother… and sister-in-law to be on your engagement. I love you both so much.'\n\nApril 2018: Sophie Turner opens up about being engaged\n\nShe detailed how finding love was a different fulfilment to the success she has enjoyed in her career.\n\n'It's lovely to be engaged. Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person, like I'd find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There's a sense of peace that comes with finding your person. But there's a drive that comes with your career.'\n\nOctober 2018: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner make their red-carpet debut\n\nTwo years after meeting and a year on from their engagement, Joe and Sophie finally graced the red carpet together at the Louis Vuitton show during Paris Fashion Week.\n\nSophie shared a photo from the evening on Instagram, writing, 'With my love in Paris.'\n\nMarch 2019: Sophie Turner stars in the Jonas Brothers' music video for Sucker\n\nThe Jonas Brothers recruited their respective partners to star in their music video for Sucker, meaning Sophie was joined by Kevin's wife Danielle Deleasa and Nick's wife Priyanka Chopra for the project.\n\nSophie reflected, '[With Game of Thrones] you have to be done with this scene by a certain time and you have to say these words and stand at exactly these spots, because otherwise it wouldn't work. Whereas with a music video, it's just much more kind of free and loose and improvisational.'\n\nMay 2019: Sophie Turner reveals she and Joe Jonas split for a day\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with The Sunday Times, Sophie credited Joe for saving her life during a period when she was 'very mentally unwell'. She also revealed that she and Joe had broken up at one point during their relationship, but it wasn't long before they were back together.\n\nShe admitted, 'It was the worst day of our lives. For a second we both had cold feet, then 24 hours later we were both, like, \"Never mind.\"'\n\n1 May 2019: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner get married\n\nAfter getting engaged in October 2017, Joe and Sophie said, 'I do' in May 2019, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Respectively, they were aged 29 and 23.\n\n'We had to get legally married in the States, so we thought it'd be really fun to get all of our friends, invite them out, and do an impromptu wedding. And we actually had some people that I didn't really even know that well there,' Joe revealed to GQ.\n\nThe couple exchanged vows at A Little White Wedding Chapel - hours after the Billboard Music Awards.\n\nJune 2019: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner wed for the second time, in France\n\nThe following month, the celebrations continued when they held a second wedding in Carpentras, France on 29 June. It was a private affair only attended by their closest family and friends.\n\nOpening up about married life with her husband months later, Sophie said, 'With Joe, I always felt like I was the one who was punching, like, way above my league. And I still feel like that. He’s so handsome, talented, funny, charismatic. I’m really lucky to be with him and have someone like him who wants to be around me and spend time with me.'\n\nJuly 2020: Do Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner have children?\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child, a daughter Willa, on 22 July. The news came a month after Sophie was pictured with a bump during an outing in LA.\n\nTheir reps confirmed the happy news, saying, 'Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas are delighted to announce the birth of their baby.'\n\nMay 2021: Joe Jonas gets candid about lockdown with his family\n\nDuring an appearance on CBS Mornings, Joe weighed in on how he was 'grateful' and 'thankful' to spend more time with his family during the pandemic.\n\nHe said, 'It's been forced time at home — I'm always on the go, I'm always moving and travelling and touring. To be in one place for a solid amount of time and having my feet on the ground and be with my family, my immediate family, is time I don't think I'll get back.'\n\nSeptember 2021: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner relocate to Miami\n\nAfter selling their Los Angeles home, Joe and Sophie moved to Miami after snapping up an $11 million abode.\n\nBut Sophie has admitted she would one day love to return to her home country, telling Elle, 'I really love living in America but, for my mental health, I have to be around my friends and my family. And also for my daughter – I would love her to get the education and school life that I was so lucky to have. England would ideally be the final destination, but [Joe] might take quite a bit of convincing!'\n\nMay 2022: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner announce second pregnancy\n\nAfter Sophie was pictured cradling her baby bump at the Met Gala, she confirmed the same month that she and Joe would be welcoming a second child.\n\nShe told Elle, 'It's what life is about for me — raising the next generation. The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We're so excited to be expanding the family. It's the best blessing ever.'\n\nJuly 2022: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner welcome their second daughter\n\nThe couple have never divulged their second daughter's name, but reps confirmed to People on 14 July that they had become parents for the second time.\n\nThey told the outlet, 'Joe and Sophie are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl.'\n\nNovember 2022: Joe Jonas details keeping his marriage private\n\nIn an interview with Mr Porter, the musician explained why he chooses to keep his personal life largely under wraps.\n\n'I want to feel like an open book. But when [Sophie and I] started dating, I realised that I didn't have a ton of stuff that was just for me. And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.'\n\n2023: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner continue to support each other with their endeavours\n\nIn January, Sophie was by her husband's side when he and his brothers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n'To see the hard work and love and light you boys bring to your music… It’s an honour just to watch from the sidelines. After almost 20 years of hard work, you boys are so deserving of this. I’m so lucky to count you as family. I’m proud of you every day,' the TV star wrote on Instagram.\n\nIn March, the glamorous couple attended the Vanity Fair Oscars party.\n\nThen last month, Sophie was every inch her husband's biggest fan as she attended the Jonas Brothers' gig at Yankee Stadium, New York. She later took to Instagram with an image of her kissing his hand, writing, 'Long long New York nights' in homage to the band's song, Montana Sky.\n\nSeptember 2023: Joe Jonas reportedly files for divorce\n\nThe following day, the pair issued a joint statement on Instagram, confirming that they were ending their marriage 'amicably', adding 'there are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision'.\n\nWhere are Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner's children now?\n\nAccording to legal documents, 'The children are currently temporarily physically located with the Mother within the Southern District of New York.' However, she plans to return to England with both children.\n\nWhat lawsuit has Sophie Turner filed?\n\nSophie filed a lawsuit in a Manhattan court last Thursday requesting to secure 'the immediate return of children wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained'. Apparently, the former couple had purchased a house in the UK which they hoped to make their 'forever home' and had started looking at schools for their eldest daughter. But since separating, Joe would like their joint custody agreement to allow their children to live both in the UK and the US.\n\nAccording to the filing, Joe's attorney confirmed on 19 September that he won’t return the passports or consent to the daughters moving to England, prompting Turner’s lawsuit. Apparently, she also intends to file a similar lawsuit in the UK, where her case would allegedly be a 'breach' of her custody rights. Joe has denied via his spokesperson that he ever “abducted” his children."
