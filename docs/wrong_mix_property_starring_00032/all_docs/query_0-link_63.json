        "text": "Power couple status? Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood — and their respective net worths prove it. The pair married in 2019 and their combined fortunes have only grown since then. However, in September 2023, reports of their split circulated and their reportedly pending divorce means their combined worth may take a hit.\n\nWhat Is Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas’ Combined Net Worth?\n\nSophie is worth an estimated $10 million, while Joe is worth an estimated $50 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, totaling a combined net worth of $60 million. Between 2022 and 2023, each added $2 million more to their respective bank accounts.\n\nHow Does Sophie Turner Make Money?\n\nThe actress is best known for her former role as Sansa Stark on HBO’s Game of Thrones. The U.K. actress was on the fantasy series from 2011 to 2019 and was featured in a whopping 59 out of 60 episodes.\n\nAdditionally, in 2016, Sophie landed the role of Jean Gray in X-Men: Apocalypse. She returned to the role, this time as Jean Gray and Phoenix, for X-Men: Dark Phoenix in 2019. Sophie portrayed Margaret Ratliff in the 2022 Netflix miniseries The Staircase, appearing in all eight episodes. She starred in the 2022 films Survive and Broken Soldier.\n\nHow Does Joe Jonas Make Money?\n\nJoe and his brothers Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas formed the Jonas Brothers in 2005. Since then, they became one of the most recognized musical groups in the world. As of 2023, they have six studio albums, three live albums, one compilation album and 27 singles, among other incredible accolades. In 2023, the brothers dropped their latest LP, simply called The Album, followed by a massive North American arena tour. The tour kicked off with two shows at New York’s Yankees Stadium in August.\n\nOutside of the Jonas Brothers, the New Jersey native pursued his own musical career with the group DNCE. In addition to Joe, DNCE members include drummer Jack Lawless, bassist and keyboardist Cole Whittle and guitarist JinJoo Lee. In September 2015, their biggest hit single, “Cake by the Ocean,” reached the Top 10 on Billboard’s hot 100.\n\nIn addition to singing, Joe is also an actor. In 2008, he played Shane Grey in Disney Channel’s Camp Rock alongside his brothers and Demi Lovato. In 2010, Joe returned to the role once more in Camp Rock: The Final Jam. Moreover, from 2009 to 2010, the “Sucker” artist played Joe Lucas on Jonas.\n\nAre Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas Still Together?\n\nOn September 3, 2023, multiple outlets reported the pair were headed towards a divorce after four years of marriage, with Joe consulting a high-powered divorce lawyer. However, at a concert in Austin, Texas, that evening, the singer was wearing his wedding ring again after going without it several times in recent weeks."
