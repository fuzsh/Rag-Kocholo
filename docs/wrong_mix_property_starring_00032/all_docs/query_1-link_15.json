        "text": "On Wednesday, January 3, Joe Jonas was spotted on a getaway in Mexico with 33-year-old model Stormi Bree. Page Six ran photos of Bree and Jonas, 34, together at a private airport in Cabo San Lucas that day. On January 4, they were seen together in Aspen, Colorado.\n\nThe sightings come after Jonas filed for divorce from Sophie Turner on Sept. 5, 2023. “After four wonderful years of marriage, we have mutually decided to end our relationship,” Jonas and Turner said in a joint statement released on September 6. “There are many speculative narratives as to why, but truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.” This is Jonas’ first romance since his breakup.\n\nWhile Bree and Jonas had more outings after their January debut, the couple hit pause on their relationship in May 2024. Ahead, everything you need to know about Bree and her history with Jonas.\n\nBree and Jonas took a break from their relationship in May 2024.\n\nA source told Us Weekly on May 31 that Jonas and Bree were no longer seeing each other. Their romance “cooled off,” the insider said, adding, “Joe has a very busy schedule between his kids and his career, so his romantic life has to take a back seat for now.”\n\nBree and Jonas have been dating for “a few months” as of March 2024.\n\nA source spoke to Us Weekly about the couple’s relationship on March 4, saying, “Joe is still dating Stormi, and things are going really well. They haven’t used the love word yet, but they’ve been seeing each other for a few months now and have been getting more serious over the past several weeks.”\n\n“[She] makes Joe really happy,” they continued. “[He’s] excited about where things are going. He hasn’t introduced his kids [with ex Sophie Turner] to Stormi yet, but if things continue going well like they have been, then he would definitely be open to them meeting sometime soon.”\n\nPhotos of Bree and Jonas kissing came out on March 4.\n\nProof of Bree and Jonas’ rumored romance came out on March 4. Photos of the couple kissing in Bondi, Australia, on March 3 surfaced on U.S. outlets. See them here.\n\nOn Feb. 28, 2024, Bree spent some time with Jonas and his brothers in Australia.\n\nWhile the Jonas Brothers were on tour in Australia, Bree was photographed spending some quality time in Bondi with Jonas and his friends. The group was dressed casually for lawn bowling. Jonas and Bree kept close to each other in pics.\n\nJonas and Bree were photographed out in New York City together on Feb. 19, 2024.\n\nJonas and Bree continued to spark dating rumors when they were photographed on a walk in New York City the Monday after Valentine’s Day week. They did not show PDA in photos but kept close to each other. See pics here.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2024, Priyanka Chopra shared a post with Jonas and Bree.\n\nJonas’ sister-in-law Priyanka Chopra posted—and quickly deleted—a picture of her and her husband Nick on a double-date with Bree and Jonas. In the photo briefly shared to her Instagram story, four hands were shown clinking champagne glasses at dinner. One of the hands appears to have the exact tattoo that Bree has on her right hand, so fans were quick to jump to the conclusion that it was in fact the model.\n\nBree and Jonas were spotted together twice in early January 2024 in Cabo, then Aspen.\n\nOn January 4, DeuxMoi, an unverified celebrity gossip account, posted a blurry pic of what appears to be Jonas and Bree having dinner together to its Instagram story.\n\n“Joe Jonas and his new girlfriend Stormi Bree are also at Casa Tua Aspen tonight,” an anonymous tipper wrote to the account.\n\nSoon after, Bree posted a selfie in her Instagram Stories of herself wearing a beanie that looks very much like one that Jonas has been photographed wearing in London. Jonas also shared clips of his Aspen adventures, including shots from a chair-lift that Bree was likely on. However, they did not appear on each other's timelines or in Stories.\n\nIt is unknown how Bree and Jonas met.\n\nWhile Bree and Jonas were seen together on January 3 and 4, there is no information as to how they actually met and got to know each other. Bree and Jonas don’t even follow each other on Instagram.\n\nA source told US Weekly, “Joe is enjoying spending time with Stormi. His main priority and focus will always be his children, but at the same time, he’s putting himself out there and is open to what’s to come.”\n\nThe insider added, “Things are still very new, but he’s happy and he’s open to seeing where things go.”\n\nBree is a 33-year-old model.\n\nStormi Bree Henley was born in Crossville, Tennessee on Dec. 6, 1990, so she is a Sagittarius. Jonas is a Leo, also a fire sign, making them an interesting astrological pairing. Sagittarius and Leo, the AstroTwins wrote for ELLE.com, is a “lively match of two compatible Fire signs, filled with fun and adventure.”\n\nShe is signed to Photogenics Media modeling agency in Los Angeles.\n\nBree is a former pageant queen.\n\nOn Oct. 5, 2008, Bree competed in the Miss Tennessee Teen USA 2009 pageant for the first time and took home the crown. On July 31, 2009, she represented Tennessee in the Miss Teen USA 2009 pageant, and she won that too, making her the second teen from her state to hold the title.\n\nBree has done some singing and acting.\n\nAccording to her IMDb page, Bree is most known for acting in the films Hot Water, 2307: Winter’s Dream, and the short film Midland. She also made an appearance in the “Boyle’s Hunch” episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Additionally, she auditioned for season 10 of American Idol in 2011, but she was eliminated in the first round of Hollywood week.\n\nShe went on to do some record production in the late 2010s. She told Galore in a March 2016 interview that she has an interest in writing film score music. “I come from the theater world, and opera—and obviously some country stuff because I’m from Tennessee—but [writing film scores is] what I want to do until I’m like 80,” she said. “I wanna be sitting in a dark room tweaking on a computer and scoring until I’m like 80. That’s how my brain processes: in strings and orchestra. So it’s kind of like I’m incorporating that into the project. While I’m young, I thought I would do songs I’ve written and put them in that world.”\n\nBree grew up doing theater and playing piano.\n\nShe shared her performing background with Galore in 2016, saying “I started piano at five, I played my whole life. I play by ear. I took 10 years of [music] theory but I’m crap at theory. I also grew up in the theatre, I did my first production when I was seven. I think I did like 18 productions. My whole life I was an employee of a theater company so I split my time between that work and school. And I was home-schooled for a little while while my dad traveled but I grew up in theater. And then when I was 18, I went to film school at New York Film Academy for acting, and I did some indie films and some short films. I eventually wanna do more acting but for the moment, like in the last three months, I’ve slowed down on the acting so I can really focus on my own music and finishing it and putting it out and also production.”\n\nShe discussed her songwriting, saying she likes writing in metaphors: “One of my favorite songs was for the band DMT. I like to write in metaphors. It was about being in an alley and shooting someone and they’re already on the ground and looking at them being like, don’t go. It’s a metaphor for a relationship. You don’t know that it’s dead and you’re standing over this thing that you just killed. I like writing in metaphors because you can express emotion without it being too loaded. It can be more relatable because you can take it either way. You can take it and make your own story about it. I like to kind of give things a double meaning. It’s fun, it’s more interesting like that. And also obviously relationship stuff and the dynamic between two people and missing someone always gives you a lot of content that you can write about. I like to keep it kind of general so you can make your own story out of it. Or at least keep it abstract.”\n\nBree started her own jewelry shop on Etsy.\n\nBree has a handmade jewelry business called linked in her Instagram bio. According to Etsy, she joined the site in 2012. “Welcome to my little creative world, hope you find something you love <3,” she wrote in her shop description.\n\nBree has one child.\n\nIn July 2017, Bree and her partner at the time, 25-year-old model Lucky Blue Smith, welcomed their now-6-year-old daughter Gravity. It was both their first child. Smith has gone on to have two other children with wife Nara Pellman. Smith and Pellman are expecting their third child currently.\n\nBree walking with Smith in a runway show in 2017.\n\n“Welcome to the world little angel, the most perfect beautiful gift I could’ve ever dreamed of 🖤little miss Gravity Blue,” she wrote on Instagram when Gravity was born.\n\nBree’s father is famous too in the golf community.\n\nBree isn’t the only member of her family that has been in the spotlight. Bree’s father Kip Henley was the winner of The Big Break II on The Golf Channel back in 2004."
