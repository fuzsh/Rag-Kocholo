        "text": "In an alternate world, we’d have had Joe Jonas as The Amazing Spider-Man, but we’re in the real world, and the actor lost the role to Andrew Garfield. Speaking to the Just for Variety podcast, the actor reminisced on auditioning for the role pre-2012 but discovered Garfield won the part instead.\n\nJonas had just starred in Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam and a new Jonas Brothers series two years before The Amazing Spider-Man ‘s release. Then in 2011, he released his debut solo studio album, Fastlife, so he thought it was a no-brainer to win the role.\n\nBeing Vulnerable And Trying New Things\n\nThe actor was 21 when he auditioned for the role, and with his success in Hollywood by then, he thought Marc Webb, a former music video director, would put a nice word in. Unfortunately, he thought wrong and lost the role to Garfield, who was 27.\n\nJonas confessed that Webb did the right thing in choosing Garfield and doesn’t regret auditioning. The singer said he loved the idea of being vulnerable, putting oneself out there, and having to prove oneself.\n\nGarfield Had The Better Resume\n\nIt helped that Garfield had an impressive resume by that time, having starred in The Other Boleyn Girl and The Social Network.\n\nGarfield impressed Webb during a scene with Gwen where he ate a cheeseburger while calming her down. It felt natural, and Webb was sold!\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man was the first live-action Spider-Man movie to star Gwen Stacy as Peter Parker’s love interest. Like many people, Emma Stone, who played Gwen, wrongly thought Mary Jane was Peter’s only love interest.\n\nMoving On To Bigger Things\n\nJonas did much better in his singing career as he created a band called DNCE following the Jonas Brothers’ break up. Then, they made a Top Ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with Cake by the Ocean.\n\nThen Jonas became a judge on The Voice Australia in 2018, and by 2019, the Jonas Brothers reunited. They returned with a vengeance, landing on the Top Ten with their single, Sucker starring all their wives.\n\nLife With Sophie Turner"
