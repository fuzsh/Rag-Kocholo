        "text": "They're both talented, good-looking, and famous, but Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato don't exactly have the world on a string: Simpler pleasures, of the sort afforded to other kids their age, sometimes elude them. Earlier this year, when the Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam costars decided to test the romantic possibilities of their rock-solid friendship, they felt compelled to do so in public; when they broke up just a few months later, Joe announced it by issuing a statement, and Demi—always true to her loyal fans—decided to confirm the details on Twitter. \"I kind of learned throughout this whole experience that having my private life public isn't as awesome as it might seem,\" the seventeen-year-old says with a rueful little laugh.\n\nEven the process of scheduling their pre-split sit-down with Teen Vogue, for example—at which the then-couple agreed to interview each other—was complicated by their inability to appear together without risking mass hysteria. But for the most part, they seem to be fairly at ease with all the attention: After a daylong press junket, Demi's famous laugh is still as loud as ever, and Joe, 20, is chipper and ready to chat. (Naturally, they were more subdued when they spoke to Teen Vogue again after their breakup, but more on that in a bit.)\n\nDemi Lovato: What's your favorite thing about me?\n\nJoe Jonas: Do you really want me to answer that? Why don't you tell me: On set, what was your favorite snack? Because I think I already know.\n\nDemi Lovato: The tomato-cheese quesadillas. Do you remember those? They were so good. What did you think it was?\n\nJoe Jonas: Cheese sticks.\n\nDemi Lovato: We didn't have cheese sticks!\n\nJoe Jonas: Well, for some reason, I imagine you eating a lot of cheese sticks.\n\nDemi Lovato: [Laughs] Thanks.\n\nJoe Jonas: They just seem like something you would like.\n\nDemi Lovato: I do love cheese sticks.\n\nJoe Jonas: There you go.\n\nDemi Lovato: So what was the hardest thing for you about making Camp Rock 2?\n\nJoe Jonas: Finding time to sleep. There were so many things to do. If I wasn't on set, I was cooking or working out. What about you?\n\nDemi Lovato: I think it was balancing sleep too. Even though I wasn't working out, I was dancing, sometimes for hours on end.\n\nJoe Jonas: Have you ever been to a real summer camp?\n\nDemi Lovato: Yeah, I went to church camp when I was in the sixth grade. What about you?\n\nJoe Jonas: I went to sleepaway camp seven years in a row. I was such a pro. We had these relay races at the end of every summer, and the majority of the competitions were eating contests. Sometimes you would have to eat, like, a whole can of Spam; once I ate four raw potatoes. I didn't really recover for weeks after that.\n\nDemi Lovato: Eww!\n\nJoe Jonas: In some ways, making this movie felt like camp all over again. During breaks, we weren't hanging out in trailers—we were going down to the lake or playing in the woods.\n\nDemi Lovato: We met when I auditioned for Jonas. What was your first impression of me?\n\nJoe Jonas: I saw right away how smiley you were. Obviously, I didn't have a say in who was going to be cast, but it ended up being a good thing that you didn't get that role. If you had, you wouldn't have been in Camp Rock.\n\nTEEN VOGUE: You guys were friends before you started dating. Whose idea was it to take the next step?\n\nJoe Jonas: Mine.\n\nTEEN VOGUE: So, Demi, you didn't already fancy him?\n\nDemi Lovato: I had always fancied him. Want to know what actually happened? One night I asked him, \"What is the deal? We're perfect for each other. What are you doing?\" And he was like, \"This is really awkward. I have to go.\"\n\nJoe Jonas: I needed time to think.\n\nDemi Lovato: And I thought, Great, I just ruined a friendship. But then the next day, he came knocking at my door.\n\nJoe Jonas: Once she confronted me, I kind of confronted myself.\n\nTEEN VOGUE: Joe's been in a couple of very high-profile relationships—with Taylor Swift, and Camilla Belle—and Demi's dated Trace Cyrus. Was it ever hard to see each other with other people?\n\nDemi Lovato: Every girlfriend he had, I always wanted to have a friendship with, because I felt like if she was worthy enough to be with him, then she must be great. It sucked, watching, but I was always happy for him.\n\nSOURCE\n\nthis is why i buy vogue, because teenvogue has disney herpes."
