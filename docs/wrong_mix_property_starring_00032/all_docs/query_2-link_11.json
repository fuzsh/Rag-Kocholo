        "text": "...but bring them up in the training and instruction of the lord.\n\nephesians 6:4\n\nCRM's policies are made with safety being paramount. Our policies aren't meant to be restrictive but allow for our camp program to thrive with the highest quality experience valued for each camper.\n\nCell Phone Policy\n\nCamp Rock, along with summer camps across the country, will continue to enforce a no camper cell phone policy. We can appreciate the desire for parents and guardians to be in contact with their camper while they are at camp however the risks of allowing campers to have cell phones continue to outweigh the benefits in the camp community.\n\nCell phones continue to advance and offer multi-use functions like camera, video recording, music player, texting, web browsing, and video games that can put campers at risk of emotional injury when misused or unsupervised. In addition to these factors, cell phones can be expensive and the outdoor camp environment can be hard on electronics. We encourage letters from home and encourage campers to write letters while they are here.\n\nCamper Contact Policy\n\nCamp Rock does not allow parents to call their child just to check in with them. We will allow for parents to communicate to their child in special cases. If you'd like to update your child in the week or simply send a note to encourage them you may mail them a letter or you may email them.\n\nIf you would like to send a letter to your child, address it to:\n\nCamper’s Name\n\nCamp Rock\n\n8092 Road 81\n\nBridgeport, Nebraska 69336\n\nRemember, mail delivery generally will take 2-3 days. Please send them early enough in the week to guarantee they are still at camp when the mail arrives.\n\nEmail a note to your camper: office@camprock.net\n\nPlease put your camper’s full name in the subject line of your email. We will print off emails daily to be handed out with the regular mail. Please note: We will not print attachments or print emails in color.\n\nMedications\n\nMedications (prescription and over-the-counter) must be turned in at registration to the Health & Safety Coordinator. Our preference is that all medications be in the original bottle. Our Health & Safety Coordinator will make sure that all campers receive their proper medications at the proper times.\n\nParents/Guardians are asked to give any additional instructions or descriptions of special needs when the medications are turned in at Check-In. Certain medications, such as inhalers and epi pens, still need to be checked in, however they will be given to the child or counselor to keep with them, as per your instructions.\n\nCheck In\n\nOur goal is to keep Check-In as quick as possible. It benefits parents and grandparents who need to get back to\n\nwork and it benefits the campers to avoid the elongated good-bye which many times can lead to homesickness.\n\nDuring the check-in process, you can expect the following things to happen:\n\nMoving in will take place when everyone has arrived for your campers bunk group. While waiting for all campers\n\nin your child’s bunk group, they will be playing games and getting to know their fellow bunkmates as well as their counselor.\n\nVisitors policy"
