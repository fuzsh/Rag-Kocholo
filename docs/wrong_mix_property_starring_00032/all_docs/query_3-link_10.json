        "text": "Though one might think it would make for a pretty solid bachelor pad, Joe Jonas has re-listed his NYC condo for a dollar shy of $6 million, according to the New York Post. The singer, who is currently in the middle of a highly publicized divorce from Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, bought the three-bedroom, three-bathroom home in Manhattan’s Nolita neighborhood in 2018 for $5.5 million. The former couple wed a year later in a Las Vegas elopement, followed by a more elaborate wedding reception in France a month later.\n\nJonas first listed the nearly 3,000-square-foot apartment for $6.5 million in July 2020, right before he and Turner welcomed the first of their two children. From there, the unit went on and off the market several times, dropping to as low as $5.4 million in November 2020. It was last available in 2021.\n\nLocated on the second floor of a 2015-built luxury condominium, the city abode boasts a spacious open floor plan with a light neutral palette and blonde oak flooring. A modern white kitchen features a long eat-in island with a marble countertop, black-and-white patterned floor tiles, and an adjacent dining space lit by floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nThe primary bedroom is equipped with a roomy walk-in closet, an ensuite bathroom with dual vanities, and glass doors leading out to a sprawling 1,450-square-foot terrace, which can also be accessed from an airy sitting area in the main living space. Keys to the dwelling also come with access to a landscaped rooftop terrace and a 24-hour doorman."
