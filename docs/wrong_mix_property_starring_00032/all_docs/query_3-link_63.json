        "text": "English actress (born 1996)\n\nFor the businesswoman, see Sophie Turner Laing.\n\nSophie Belinda Turner (born 21 February 1996)[2] is an English-American actress. She made her acting debut as Sansa Stark in the HBO epic fantasy television series Game of Thrones (2011–2019), for which she received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2019.\n\nTurner appeared in the 2013 British drama television film The Thirteenth Tale and made her feature film debut in the psychological thriller Another Me (2013). She appeared in the action comedy Barely Lethal (2015) and portrayed a young Jean Grey / Phoenix in the X-Men film series (2016–2019).\n\nTurner was born in Northampton,[3] England on 21 February 1996, the daughter of Sally, a nursery school teacher, and Andrew, who works for a pallet distribution company.[4] She moved to Chesterton, Warwickshire when she was 2 years old. She attended Warwick Prep School until she was 11, and later attended the independent The King's High School for Girls. Turner has been a member of the Playbox Theatre Company since she was 3 years old.[5][6] She has two older brothers.[7] Her twin died in utero.[8]\n\nShe grew up in a large Edwardian house, near Leamington Spa, saying, \"My childhood was pretty fun. We had pigsties, barns and a paddock, and used to muck around in the mud.\" Turner had a tutor on the set of Game of Thrones until age 16. She achieved five GCSE A-grades and four Bs, including a B in Drama.[7]\n\nTurner was cast as Sansa Stark, a young noblewoman, in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones in August 2009.[9] Filming began in July 2010, when Turner was 14 years old.[10] Sansa was Turner's first television role.[2] Turner's drama teacher encouraged her to audition for the part,[11] and she dyed her blonde hair auburn for the role, although in season 7 she began wearing wigs. In 2012, she was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series – Supporting Young Actress for her performance as Sansa, alongside her on-screen sister, Maisie Williams. Turner appeared in all eight broadcast seasons.[12]\n\nWhile playing Sansa Stark, Turner was told to lose weight and she said she suffered from mental health problems while spending her teenage years on screen.[13][14] She also had an eating disorder.[15][16]\n\nIn 2013, she had her first movie role as the lead character in the independent thriller film Another Me, based on the novel of the same name by Catherine MacPhail. She starred as Adeline March in the 2013 television film The Thirteenth Tale. In 2013, she was cast in the comedy film Barely Lethal, alongside Hailee Steinfeld, which was released on 29 May 2015 in a limited release and through video on demand.[17][18]\n\nTurner also narrated the audiobook version of the Lev Grossman short story ‘The Girl in the Mirror’,[19] which was included in the short fiction anthology Dangerous Women and was edited by George R. R. Martin. In 2014, she narrated the audiobook City of Heavenly Fire by Cassandra Clare.[20][21] The same year, she was the face of Karen Millen's \"The Journey\" campaign.[22] Turner played mutant Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse, which was released in May 2016 to mixed critical success.[23] During summer 2016, she hosted the web video Powershift in partnership with the Huffington Post.[24][25]\n\nIn March 2017, she announced she had become patron of Women for Women, an organisation that supports female war survivors.[26] In August 2017, Turner said she believed her social media following was responsible for her successful casting in an unnamed project rather than her abilities as an actress, saying, \"[I]t was between me and another girl who is a far better actress than I am, far better, but I had the followers, so I got the job.\"[27] In June 2017, she began a collaboration with Wella Hair, becoming its first international brand ambassador.[28]\n\nIn November 2017, Turner was cast to play Juliane Koepcke in the movie Girl Who Fell From the Sky. She is also attached to produce the movie.[29] In March and April 2018, she filmed the independent film Heavy in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[30] Turner reprised her role as Jean Grey in the X-Men film Dark Phoenix, which takes place in 1992 and follows the events of Apocalypse. The film was released in June 2019.[31][32]\n\nShe has been featured in print work for the luxury designer brand Louis Vuitton.[33] In September 2019, Turner was cast in the thriller television show Survive.[34]\n\nIn 2022, Turner appeared in a minor role as Erica in the teen black comedy Do Revenge. Turner figures in a pivotal scene where her character is accused of drug possession and has an \"over-the-top\" reaction. The scene went viral due to Turner's delivery of the line, which she admitted was intentionally played to emulate cinema outbursts from actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson.[35]\n\nTurner began dating American singer Joe Jonas in 2016.[36] They became engaged in October 2017[37] and were married on 1 May 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada.[38] The couple lived in New York City as of May 2019.[1][39] They held a second wedding ceremony in Carpentras, France on 29 June 2019.[40] The couple have two daughters, born July 2020 and July 2022.[41][42] Turner was the inspiration behind the song \"Hesitate\", written as a love letter to her by Jonas, for the Jonas Brothers reunion album, Happiness Begins.[43]\n\nIn early September 2023, Jonas filed for divorce from Turner in Miami, Florida.[44] This was then confirmed by both Turner and Jonas via Instagram to be a mutual decision.[45][46] Later that month, she sued her estranged husband to allow their daughters, who were born in the United States, to return to England, as the former couple had registered the latter as their permanent residence in April earlier that year.[47] Jonas and Turner reached a temporary custody agreement in October.[48]\n\nShe is currently dating Peregrine Pearson, son of Michael Pearson, 4th Viscount Cowdray.[49] He is a member of the Pearson family and heir apparent to the viscountcy.\n\nYear Title Role Ref. 2013 Another Me Fay / Lila Delussey [50] 2015 Barely Lethal Heather / Agent 84 [51] 2016 X-Men: Apocalypse Jean Grey [52] 2018 Josie Josie [53] Time Freak Debbie [54] 2019 Dark Phoenix Jean Grey / Phoenix [55] Heavy Maddie 2022 Every Last Secret Penelope [56] Do Revenge Erica [57] StoryBots: Answer Time Lady Eleanor\n\nYear Title Role Notes Ref. 2011–2019 Game of Thrones Sansa Stark Main role [58] 2013 The Thirteenth Tale Young Adeline March/Vida March Television film [59] 2020 Survive Jane Main role [60] Home Movie: The Princess Bride Westley Episode: \"Chapter Six: The Fire Swamp\" [61] 2021 The Prince Princess Charlotte Main voice role [62] 2022 The Staircase Margaret Ratliff Main role [63] 2024 Joan Joan Hannington Main role [64] TBA Haven Zara Main role [65]\n\nYear Title Artist(s) Ref. 2014 \"Oblivion\" Bastille [66] 2019 \"Sucker\" Jonas Brothers [67] 2020 \"What a Man Gotta Do\" Jonas Brothers [68]\n\nMajor associations Year Award Category Work Result Ref.\n\n2011\n\nScreen Actors Guild Award Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series Game of Thrones Nominated [69]\n\n2013\n\nNominated [70]\n\n2014\n\nNominated [71]\n\n2015\n\nNominated [72]\n\n2016\n\nNominated [73]\n\n2017\n\nNominated [74]\n\n2019\n\nNominated [75] Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series Nominated [76]\n\nMiscellaneous awards Year Award Category Work Result Ref.\n\n2011\n\nScream Awards Scream Award for Best Ensemble Game of Thrones Nominated [77]\n\n2012\n\nYoung Artist Awards Best Performance in a TV Series – Supporting Young Actress Game of Thrones Nominated [78]\n\n2015\n\nEmpire Hero Award Empire Hero Award Game of Thrones Won [79] EWwy Award Best Supporting Actress, Drama Game of Thrones Nominated [80]\n\n2016\n\nHuading Awards Best Global Actress Herself Won [81] Glamour Awards Best UK TV Actress Game of Thrones Won [82] Venice International Film Festival International Movie Award Herself Won [83] EWwy Award Best Supporting Actress, Drama Game of Thrones Won [84]\n\n2017\n\nKids Choice Awards Favorite Squad X-Men: Apocalypse Nominated [85]\n\n2019\n\nSaturn Award Best Supporting Actress on Television Game of Thrones Nominated [86] Teen Choice Awards Choice Sci-Fi/Fantasy Movie Actress Dark Phoenix Nominated [87]"
