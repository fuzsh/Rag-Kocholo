Her name is Carrie. Carrie is the best example of Maltreatment. As the director mentioned in the in the ( ), this show is not just about a girl looking for revenge. It is a morality play warning us against the effects of what many young people who are simply ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù deal with everyday bullying. There is a statics indicate there are 2.1 million bullies in American schools, and 2.7 million victims of bullying. The main characters in the show were Madeleine Ellingson as Carrie White, Brooke Aston as Margaret White, Elizabeth Campbell as Sue Snell, Dylan David Farris as Tommy Ross and Katie Lee as Chris Hargensen. I have to say, it is one of the best show I have ever seen, I like it. Madeleine Ellingson was great. She played the character perfectly. I think in the horror story the main character should always be quiet and angry at the same time, so you can surprise the audience in a sudden moves, and that what I noticed in Ellingson. She was so quiet. She knew what she was doing. And she have a nice voice when she sang I was shocked, I didn‚Äôt thought she can sing like that. Also Brooke Aston mother of Carrie, her voice is amazing, but the most thing attracted me in her character was the way she talk, you can feel the tone of the mother. So I think she was also good. But in my opinion the best actor was Katie Lee. Katie played the character of the meanest girl in the school, and the reason why I think that she is the best because when you see her you hate her. And therein lies the ingenuity of Katie, how she made me hate her. That shows she is playing the character perfectly. On the other, Dylan David Farris was good, I‚Äôm not sure if the character supposed to be like that or he was just normal, I didn‚Äôt noticed anything amazing or bad in his chractter.. He was so normal. Overall, The show was excellent. The choice of music was good, the Band was perfect, all the members did a great job especially who played the Piano. In conclusion, Sue Snell said ‚Äùwhat does it cost to be kind‚Äù. If we think about it, if every person in the world tried to be kind, there will no be bullies contrary, probably this will encourage people to communicate with others. Also you don‚Äôt know maybe someday you wil need someone to be kind with you. ...\n\nCodeavour 5.0 International Impact Report - The Biggest International AI, Cod...\n\nCodeavour 5.0 International Impact Report - The Biggest International AI, Cod...Codeavour International\n\nUnlocking potential across borders! üåç‚ú® Discover the transformative journey of Codeavour 5.0 International, where young innovators from over 60 countries converged to pioneer solutions in AI, Coding, Robotics, and AR-VR.
