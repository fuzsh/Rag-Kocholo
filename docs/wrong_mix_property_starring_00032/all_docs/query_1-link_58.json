        "text": "Tag: camp america\n\nRelationships at Camp\n\nAs Olivia Newton-John said back in 1978; ‘summer lovin’, had me a blast’ and boy, she wasn’t wrong! Before going to camp in 2015, I was a strong, independent woman – and then I met Ben…\n\nCamp is obviously all about the campers, but if you throw a group of young people together and give them time off in the middle of nowhere with not a lot to do, things are going to happen. There are several different types of hook ups that can happen at camp, and here are a few:\n\nThe Newbie\n\nA new girl/boy arrives at camp and at first, they are generally overwhelmed by everyone and everything. To the returners, you are fresh meat and it’s generally a race to see who gets there first and calls dibs (tragic really!). Newbies, you basically have the pick of the bunch! Take your time and choose wisely, who knows where it could lead!\n\nThe First\n\nThere are people whispering during staff week about who fancies who (yes, we are basically back at primary school), and who is going to be the first to make make a move. No one wants to be remembered as the guy/girl who was the first person to hook up with someone last summer but hey, someone has to take one for the team!\n\nThe Day-Off Hook Up\n\nAfter too many hours spent sunbathing on your day off, the heat goes straight to your head and you end up randomly getting together with one of the girls/boys on your day off. You don’t really mention it to anyone and pray that no one noticed you were gone, but of course everyone will know sooner or later – gossip at camp spreads like wildfire! You’ll regret it but the great thing about camp is that there’s always new drama, and people quickly forget.\n\nThe Rebound\n\nPeople move on quickly at camp. The person you hooked up with last week may have moved onto someone new this week with no explanation as to why! Make sure you’re not anyone else’s rebound – or you could get yourself involved in some serious camp drama!\n\nThe ‘Camp Goggles’\n\nWhen I asked Ben how he would describe ‘camp goggles’, he said:\n\n‘Camp goggles are basically when you get to week six of camp, and even the trees start to look attractive’.\n\nSome people aren’t involved in any kind of relationship throughout the majority of the summer, and then week six comes along and you suddenly see that certain guy/girl in a different light. You may find yourself saying to your bestie ‘Oh, Fred is looking mighty fine today’ when in reality, Fred would definitely be a 5/10 tops in the real world. You end up getting together and then you go home, look through his Facebook profile pictures and think to yourself ‘what was I ever thinking?!’. I like to tease Ben that I’ve had my camp goggles on for a year and a half now…\n\nThe ‘One’\n\nI never expected in a million years that I would go to summer camp and come home with a boyfriend, and I’m definitely not the only one (although I made the mistake of choosing one that doesn’t lives in England – what was I thinking?!). I know at least 5 couples who have met at camp and have gone on to have long-term relationships waaaay after summer has ended – with one couple even getting married in the Fall last year (congrats again Sam and Dan!). Anyway, I have kind of kept my blog a Ben-free zone so far but if there’s any day to share him all with you, Valentine’s Day is as good as any. Camp has changed my life in so many ways, but finding him will always be the best one.\n\nSummer camp is a great place to meet like-minded people and have some fun, but here are a few words of advice when it comes to relationships at camp:\n\nDo NOT (under any circumstances!!) discuss your/other peoples relationships with the campers. Yes, they’re not stupid and yes they will get suspicious if you even so much as TALK to a member of the opposite sex, but never ever ever ever discuss what is going on outside of camp with them. I spent my whole summer pretending I didn’t even know who Ben was. If the campers caught me speaking to him and asked me about it later on in the cabin, I would simply say ‘who is Ben? I don’t know anyone called Ben’. It drove them crazy but camp is all about them, not what their Counselors get up to during their time off camp.\n\nDon’t let camp relationships interfere with your job, or distract you from the real reason that you are at camp. You are there, first and foremost, to make sure the campers have the BEST summer of their lives. My camp director likes to call this ‘white and yellow square time’. The white square represents the most important reasons you are at camp; to teach campers, to have new experiences, to learn new things… while the yellow square represents personal reasons such as camp relationships and enjoying days off. The white square is much bigger than the yellow square, and you need to remember that throughout the summer.\n\nDon’t get caught! If you do end up being in a relationship at camp, make sure you keep it away from camp. Being caught in a compromising position with another staff member on camp property can lead to you being fired… and it’s totally not worth it!\n\nHappy Valentines day! xo\n\nSummer Camp vs Camp Rock\n\nSo if you follow me on Twitter (@how2survivecamp if you don’t!), you’ll know that I watched Camp Rock a couple of nights ago. As a huge fan of cheese and a good singalong film, I think Camp Rock is a GREAT film. 9 years later (can you believe it?!), I still have the songs on my iPod so the kids at camp can singalong during cabin clean up (I obviously NEVER listen to them outside of camp of course… *rolls eyes*).\n\nAnyhow, I decided to list all the similarities and differences between Camp Rock and real summer camp so all the newbies out there will know what to expect this summer. Here goes…\n\nSimilarities\n\nCamp Rock is set on a beautiful, picturesque lake. The majority of summer camps are set on a lake and the waterfront is a place where many of the activities on camp will take place.\n\nMitchie’s parents discuss at the beginning of the film that they can’t afford to send her because it’s too expensive. This is no joke – the majority of summer camps cost a FORTUNE for the campers!! Camps can range up to as much as $10,000 for an 8 week stay which is CRAZY, but totally worth it!\n\nMany camps are the summer home to the children of famous people. A couple of years ago I had the pleasure of meeting a certain Desperate Housewives star when she camp to drop her daughter off. Many celebrities themselves have too been to summer camps, such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Denzel Washington, Seth Rogan, Mark Zuckerberg and Zooey Deschanel.\n\nAt Camp Rock, Tess is the diva of the camp. Prepare yourself, all camps have diva’s (both campers and counselors).\n\nThe campers (and counselors) break out into random synchronised songs without any advance warning – especially during meal times. If you don’t like to sing, I suggest you spend the next couple of months either learning to love it or practising your lipsynching skills.\n\nDifferences\n\nThe campers at Camp Rock are all practically borderline adults. At real camp, campers ages can range from around 5 to 16 years old.\n\nTess rocks up to Camp Rock in a limo, sans parents. Campers usually get dropped off by their parents who swing by in their huge SUV’s that are so big, they make my Citroen C1 look like a toy car. I’m yet to see even the famous ones arrive by limo!\n\nI never saw anyone on Camp Rock lugging HUGE trunks out of the cars on Camp Rock, or sweating while they are trekking them across camp in the midday sun. Real camp is a lot less glamorous, and a lot more hard work on opening day!\n\nI’m yet to meet a camper who also works in the kitchen during his/her spare time! Campers are kept as far away as possible from the kitchen – counselors too for that matter!\n\nThe campers at Camp Rock seem to spend a lot of time unattended, whether in their rooms rehearsing or while eating their lunch in the dining hall. At camp, it’s rare the campers are ever alone without a Counselor in sight. Most camps don’t allow campers in the cabins during free time unless their is a Counselor present, and they are always accompanied at meals/during activities.\n\nAlthough campers often break into spontaneous, synchronised song, it’s rare that a dance ever accompanies it unlike at Camp Rock (unless you count the actions to the Banana song!). And I’ve never seen anyone dancing on the dining hall tables at my camp – there’s a stage for that!\n\nThe Counselors at Camp Rock (minus Shane Grey aka Joe Jonas) all seem pretty old to me. I find that the majority of Counselors at camp tend to be in their 20’s.\n\nGenerally you will find that the campers spend their free time making friendship bracelets and playing Tetherball (check out my Camp A-Z Glossary if you have no idea what Tetherball is!), rather than rehearsing labouriously for the upcoming talent show (although this has been known to happen!).\n\nThe cabins on Camp Rock look pretty cosy with a few single beds dotted around, rugs on the carpet and curtains on the windows. Usually camps aren’t quite this glamorous, and you might find yourself sleeping in a cabin with bunk beds and a carpeted floor if you’re lucky!\n\nCamps are usually a technology-free zone. The kids at Camp Rock have mobiles (aka ‘cell phones’) and laptops, which for me defeats the whole point of going to camp and getting away from the real world!\n\nThe campfire at Camp Rock is HUGE! Camps usually have a campfire circle surrounded by wooden benches that the campers/Counselors sit on. If the fire was that big at real camp, we would all be burning alive.\n\nThe campers at Camp Rock all look very clean and presentable with brushed hair and ironed clothes. Half the fun of summer camp is that you don’t have to worry about brushing your hair in the morning (until visiting day comes around of course!).\n\nSadly The Jonas Brothers don’t come with the camp package, and are yet to perform at the end of summer show at any real camp.\n\nSo although there are definitely more differences, Camp Rock is a great feel-good film to get you in the mood for a summer at camp. If you haven’t already watched it, give it a go!\n\n19th & 21st January, 2017.\n\nOver the past week, I attended not ONE but TWO Camp America recruitment fairs (my first ever fairs, how exciting!). I had the BEST time finding fab new Counselors to work at camp this summer, and I wanted to tell you all a little bit more about my experience at the fairs…\n\nThe first fair I attended was the Manchester recruitment fair held on Thursday 19th January 2017 at Old Trafford. As we arrived (I travelled to the fair with my Camp Directors and other camp staff), queues of eager young people were already beginning to form outside. All I can say is that I’m glad it wasn’t me – Manchester is hardly known for its tropical climate at this time of year!\n\nAt the fair, more and more previous camp staff began to arrive to catch up and help recruit newbies for the summer! It was great to catch up with everyone and for me one of the best things about summer camp is how you can go for so long without seeing a camp friend but you instantly pick things back up when you see them again. It’s a strange relationship, but I wouldn’t have it any other way!\n\nAnyway, back to the day! The crowds came rushing in, eager to bag themselves a job working at a summer camp. There were so many different camps at the fair, and lots of choice on offer. It was clear to see who had done their homework prior to the fair day, as\n\nthey already knew which camps they were interested in and their location at the event. Good on you, guys!\n\nThe thing that shocked me about the camp fair was just how many parents (and even GRANDPARENTS) were in attendance!! A lot of Camp Directors I spoke to on the day said that was a HUGE turn-off for them – I mean if you can’t make it to the fair by yourself, what are the chances of getting to America by yourself in the summer?! A camp recruitment fair should be treated like any other job interview. Would you take your parents to your part-time job interview at New Look? I should hope not. (By the way, we didn’t hire anyone who was walking around with a parent – sorry!).\n\nWe had a great day at the fair and managed to hire some great staff for next summer, including Counselors for Fencing, Woodshop, Arts and Crafts, Drama and Martial Arts. I am SO excited to work with them in the summer! Congratulations to all who managed to get hired at the Manchester camp fair!\n\nThe next stop was a trip to London, which involved hiring even MORE fab staff for summer 2017 and catching up with old camp friends (yay!). The London fair was held on Saturday 21st January 2017 at the Queen Elizabeth II centre. We thought there was a long line in Manchester, but then we got to London! WOW!!!!! The line was already HUGE a couple of hours before the fair was due to begin, and it just kept on getting bigger and bigger as the day went on.\n\nI spent most of the day chatting to people, finding out their skills and talents and giving advice (helpful, I hope!) to those who needed it. After attending a fair and spending time chatting to potential Counselors, my top tip would be to stick to what you have chosen to do. For example if you come to the fair wanting to be a lifeguard, stick with it!! Many conversations I had with people would go like this:\n\nMe: ‘Hi, can I help you? What kind of role are you looking for?’\n\nThem: *looks at the list of roles available* ‘Well, I was wanting a role as a Lifeguard’\n\nMe: ‘OK, cool! Unfortunately we’re not hiring any lifeguards today, but I know that loads of camps are!’\n\nThem: ‘OK well I can see you are looking for support staff… or woodshop?’\n\nMe: ‘Yes, do you have any woodshop skills? Any experience with making things out of wood or using tools?’\n\nThem: ‘Urrr well not really, I helped make a box in D.T. at school six years ago’\n\nMe: ‘OK I’m not sure you have the right kind of experience here but if you want to be a lifeguard, stick at it! It’s a highly desired qualification to have, and there will be a camp out there for you!’\n\nNo lie. Don’t just settle for any job – find the right one for YOU! London was another success for my camp as we managed to find a new Assistant Nurse and a Sailing and Sports Counselor. Welcome on board!\n\nAfter a long exhausting day at the fair, it was time to go and get ready to go for drinks with the camp family. We went to a piano bar near Embankment called Players Bar. When it was first suggested, I was skeptical as to what piano music involved (I had visions of slow jazz in my head) and whether that it would be the place for me on a Saturday night. But it was AMAZING! It’s quite a small bar with a piano in the corner, and a live singer/pianist playing all great singalong songs – from Oasis to the Backstreet Boys. It was so good to catch up with them all, and we had a great night!\n\nI loved attending my first ever camp fairs, and hopefully this will be the start of many more! Thanks to all who read and shared my ‘Camp Fairs Survival Guide‘ – I hope it was useful for you! I know there are still more fairs coming up over the next month or so, so if you haven’t already been placed – don’t worry! Here are some dates for your diaries:\n\nCamp America Fairs:\n\nSaturday 18th February 2017 – London\n\nCamp Leaders Fairs:\n\nSaturday 4th February 2017 – Manchester\n\nSunday 5th February 2017 – Glasgow\n\nAlternatively, many people (like me!) get hired online. If you didn’t manage to get yourself a job at camp fair, or weren’t able to attend – don’t worry! Check out my blog post about how I got hired online with Wildpacks back in 2014.\n\nCongratulations to all who have been hired, and good luck to those who are still looking!\n\nWhy choose Camp America?\n\nCamp America is a HUGELY popular agency choice for many people wanting to go and work at summer camp in the USA. Established in 1969, Camp America (CA) are experienced in recruiting international staff to work at American summer camps. CA recruit over 7000 people per YEAR from countries worldwide, creating a truly international experience for its staff, and they also work with the most amount of US summer camps; meaning you have a higher chance of being placed for the summer of your dreams!\n\nIf you are ever talking to a ‘non-camp’ person (basically the equivalent of a ‘muggle’), you will often hear them say ‘Oh, you did Camp America?’, regardless of the agency you went to camp with. Camp America is the agency that hired you, but if even the MUGGLE people know about it, then surely it must be the original, the most popular, and therefore one of the BEST!\n\nBelow is a break down of the costs involved, and also what the package includes, for first-time counselors.\n\nFirst-Timer Costs\n\nThe cost to go to camp in 2017 with Camp America is £772. This includes:\n\nFlights – a return flight to the USA.\n\nMedical insurance for the ENTIRE trip to the U.S.\n\nVisa documentation and support.\n\nA police background check.\n\nPre-camp meet ups/CA Orientations – a chance to meet people from your camp and ask any questions you may have!\n\nTransportation from a New York airport to a selected CA hotel/hostel for an overnight stay.\n\nFood and accommodation for the entire time you are at camp.\n\n24 hour support throughout the whole trip.\n\nHere is a break down of the costs involved:\n\nPre-Placement\n\nStep One: Apply – £0.\n\nIt is free to register and apply with Camp America (CA) – nothing to lose!\n\nStep Two: Application Fee – £35.\n\nOnce you have completed enough of your CA application, you will be prompted to book an interview with an interviewer in your local area. If for any reason you are unsuccessful at this stage, this money will be refunded to you.\n\nStep Three: Police Check – £53.\n\nAll agencies, including CA, require you to have a background check to enable you to work with children and young people at camp.\n\nStep Four: Assessment and Circulation Fee – £134.\n\nThis is the exciting part where CA readies your application for potential camps to view!\n\nTotal for pre-placement = £222.\n\nPost-Placement\n\nStep One: Confirmation Fee – £100.\n\nOnce you have been placed (YIPEE!) at a camp, this fee is to confirm your commitment to the placement.\n\nStep Two: Medical Insurance – £212.\n\nCamp America cover you for the ENTIRE time you are in the U.S., including your post-camp travels.\n\nStep Three: Medical Form – £?.\n\nI went for a health check-up with the nurse at my local surgery, and she was happy to sign/stamp the medical form free of charge. Find out if your local GP/nurse will do the same before paying for a medical!\n\nStep Four: Visa – £120.\n\nThis includes all your visa paperwork and essential U.S. embassy appointment (extra costs may incur for your travel to the embassy i n London, check out Megabus for cheap deals!).\n\nStep Five: Pre-Camp Meet Up – £0.\n\nCamp America host pre-camp meet ups prior to your departure, a great opportunity to meet other people and ask any questions you may still have.\n\nStep Six: Airport Taxes and Fuel Surcharge – £118.\n\nAlthough the cost of your flight is included in your fee’s, CA do pass on the airport tax and fuel surcharge.\n\nStep Seven: Regional Flight Surcharge – £?.\n\nFlights with Camp America typically depart from London. If this is not convenient for you, you are able to fly from Belfast, Edinburgh or Glasgow airports. There is currently no cost for this, but if you apply late, there will be an additional fee. What are you waiting for?!\n\nStep Eight: Return Flight – £0.\n\nIncluded in your fee’s is a return flight from New York. You will need to select the date of your return flight home prior to leaving for camp. However, you are able to purchase a ‘flexible flight pass’ that will allow you to depart from different airports across the U.S. at a time and date that will suit you. In addition, you can select a flight home as late as TWO weeks before camp – perfect if you are not 100% sure of your post-camp plans yet!\n\nTotal for post-placement = £550.\n\nTotal Cost: £772\n\nAs a first-timer using Camp America, your camp will pay a fee to CA to cover your agency sponsorship, admin fee’s and flights. Camps will take this out of the ‘pocket money’ you earn throughout the summer, and what is left is your much-deserved pay check!\n\nIf you have anymore questions about Camp America, check out their website HERE!
