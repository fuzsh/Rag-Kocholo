        "text": "Divorce is coming.\n\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner both have multi-million dollar careers in the entertainment industry.\n\nWith their impending divorce on the horizon, their finances will play a major role in the outcome of their split.\n\nHere’s a look at their individual estimated net worths and how their divorce could affect their bank accounts.\n\nJoe Jonas’ divorce from Sophie Turner\n\nThe Jonas Brothers band member filed to divorce Turner on Sept. 5 after four years of marriage amid rumors that were having “serious problems” in their marriage.\n\nMaking matters worse, Turner claimed found out about her divorce through social media.\n\nWhile some sources claimed that Turner’s partying habits caused their relationship to crumble, others asserted that the British actress was homesick and wanted to move their family across the pond.\n\nThings have quickly turned nasty for the estranged pair. Amid their separation, Turner sued Jonas to have their two daughters return to England. But Jonas fired back, telling Page Six via a rep in a statement that he did not “abduct” their children.\n\nTheir divorce battle, which features an ironclad prenuptial agreement, is expected to be a long and bumpy ride\n\nSophie Turner’s suspected earnings\n\nTurner made her rise to fame at just 13 years old when she was cast as Sansa Stark in HBO’s hit series “Game of Thrones.”\n\nWhile it’s unclear exactly how much she raked in from her iconic role, Turner reportedly earned $253,000 per episode during the 8-Season series, according to Marie Claire.\n\nThe Hollywood star also earned big bucks from her roles in major movies including “X-Men: Apocalypse,” which grossed $543.9 million at the box office, and “Dark Phoenix,” which brought in $252.4 million.\n\nAnd acting isn’t Turner’s only source of income. She also became a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton in 2017.\n\nWhile it’s unknown how much she has earned for the brand partnership, Emma Stone was reportedly paid $12.8 million for her deal with the LVMH fashion house, so it’s safe to say Turner’s LV paycheck is no pocketful of pennies.\n\nTurner’s estimated net worth comes out to a staggering $10 million, according to celebritynetworth.com.\n\nJoe Jonas’ suspected earnings\n\nWhile Turner has made millions in her own career, it’s Jonas who is the breadwinner of the family.\n\nThe singer is most famous for being part of the widely popular band the Jonas Brothers, alongside his siblings Nick and Kevin Jonas.\n\nThe JoBros have been making hits since 2005, selling out shows around the globe and even having a Las Vegas mini-residency in 2023.\n\nAnd even when Joe went off on his own to form the band DNCE, he found continued success as a musical artist.\n\nAside from singing, the “Cake By the Ocean” crooner has raked in a substantial income from his acting gigs.\n\nHe and his brothers starred in the Disney series “Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream,” before Joe landed a lead role alongside Demi Lovato in “Camp Rock” and “Camp Rock 2.”\n\nThe Jonas Brothers then premiered their second Disney series, “Jonas,” and Joe has also appeared in a number of other projects including, “Hot in Cleveland,” “Zoolander 2,” and “Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation.”\n\nThanks to his big-time rockstar career and side projects, Joe has an estimated net worth of a whopping $50 million, according to celebritynetworth.com.\n\nReal estate portfolio\n\nJust one month before their split, the estranged couple sold their waterfront mansion in Miami for $15 million.\n\nOffloading their property, which they purchased in 2021 for $11 million, could have been a sign that there was trouble in paradise considering they listed the home for nearly $17 million.\n\nThey reportedly found their “forever home” in London, having entered into a contract two months before breaking up.\n\nThe duo also shared a ritzy condo in New York City, listing the pricey pad for $5.9 in 2020.\n\nBefore moving to Miami, they previously resided in a $15 million contemporary home in Encino, Calif., which was purchased by DJ Zedd in 2021.\n\nJudging by their expensive real estate habit, it’s safe to say they were living quite comfortably on both their budgets.\n\nPrenuptial agreement\n\nJoe and the “GoT” actress have an ironclad prenuptial agreement that will pretty much ensure that the “Sucker” singer gets to keep his hard-earned cash.\n\nThe duo reportedly signed the binding paperwork weeks before their Las Vegas wedding in 2019.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Joe will “keep all of his royalties from the music” with his brothers as well as anything he earned from his other band, DNCE.\n\nMeanwhile, Turner will keep the money she earned from “GoT” and “any residuals from her acting career.”\n\nTheir real estate will also be divvied up fairly. Both parties agreed in the prenup that any properties purchased before they got married will remain with the rightful owner and “the only property that will be split amongst the two stars will be the marital home.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nEach star will also “keep the rights to their image and likeness and businesses associated with their celebrity status.”\n\nThe only thing to battle out in court is the child support and custody agreement of their two children: Willow, born in July 2020, and their younger daughter whose name is unknown and whom they welcomed in July 2022.\n\nTurner and Joe are planning to have “shared parental responsibility” for the girls, according to court docs obtained by Page Six. They will also form a parenting plan and will both be required to provide financially for them.\n\nTheir custody battle is already off to a rocky start, with Turner suing her estranged husband for the return of her children and Joe firing back a livid response."
