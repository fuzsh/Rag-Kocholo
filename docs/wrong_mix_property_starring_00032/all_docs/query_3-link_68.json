        "text": "Sophie Turner wants to put the divorce filed by her estranged husband Joe Jonas on hold until a federal court can rule on her custody lawsuit, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.\n\nAs we previously reported, Turner's lawsuit accused Jonas of refusing to return their daughter's passports in an attempt to block them from returning to England.\n\nIn newly filed court documents, filed in Miami Dade County, Turner asked the judge to stay the divorce battle.\n\nThe Game of Thrones star filing also included a letter from Steven Anderson, the director of the U.S. State Department’s Office of Children Issues informing the judge that the children, Willa and Delphine, are the subject of an “international child abduction” case under the Hague Convention.\n\n“This fact may affect your administration of the custody proceeding before you,” the two-page letter addressed to 11th Judicial Circuit JudgeDavid Young stated.\n\nJonas, 34, filed for divorce earlier this month and has been looking after his two daughters while Turner worked on a television project in England.\n\nTurner claimed she was blindsided by the divorce and accused the singer of “refusing” to ship the kids overseas to be with her. Jonas claimed his ex was playing the system and the public.\n\n\"After multiple conversations with Sophie, Joe initiated divorce proceedings in Florida, as Florida is the appropriate jurisdiction for the case,” Jonas' rep said in a lengthy statement obtained by TMZ."
