        "text": "If fans thought that Joe Jonas‘ divorce from Sophie Turner was a done deal, they might have been surprised to learn that the former couple had put the proceedings on ice. Last fall, when the 28-year-old actress and the 34-year-old singer were in the throes of breaking up (and things were getting nasty), they were able to come to a temporary custody agreement for their daughters, Willa, 3, and Delphine, 20 months, and they put their divorce on hold in hopes of mediating their split.\n\nNow, Turner’s lawyers are asking a Miami-Dade County judge to “reactive” their divorce case because there is no reconciliation on the horizon — Turner has moved on with aristocrat Peregrine Pearson and Jonas is dating model Stormi Bree. According to documents obtained by People, the Game of Thrones star’s lawyers are noting “that the abatement has come to an end and this case is to be re-activated.” It’s time for Turner and Jonas to move forward with their separate lives.\n\nThe temporary child custody agreement was put in place in October 2023 and allowed the children to live in both the U.S. and the U.K. with their parents. “After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the UK. We look forward to being great co-parents,” the former duo said in a statement last fall. It remained in effect until January 2024.\n\nIn the initial stages of their divorce, Turner claimed that Jonas wouldn’t release their daughters’ passports to allow them to travel to England with her. There were also different points of view on whether they had intended to make England their “forever home” which resulted in Turner filing a “wrongful retention” case against Jonas. The lawsuit has since been dropped because their parenting plan had been approved by judges on both sides of the Atlantic as of Jan. 11.\n\nUnfortunately, mediation has not worked in finalizing their property and permanent child custody details and that’s why Turner has asked the judge to “reactive” their divorce case. Jonas’ rep downplayed the court documents to Page Six, claiming, “The filing was a legal formality, and the couple continues to negotiate an amicable resolution.”\n\nThe former couple never gave a concrete reason for their split, but their joint statement tried to show a unified front despite the contentious battle behind the scenes. “After four wonderful years of marriage, we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” the statement read. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but truly this is a united decision, and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”"
