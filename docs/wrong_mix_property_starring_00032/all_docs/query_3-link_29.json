        "text": "Sophie Turner is breaking her silence about the days following her split from Joe Jonas in September 2023.\n\nThe actress sat down with British Vogue to discuss her upcoming series, Joan, the six-part ITV drama that follows the true story of Britain’s notorious jewel thief Joan Hannington. During the conversation, the Game of Thrones star got candid about her split from the Jonas brother and how much she was affected by the reports alleging she was a bad mother who liked to party.\n\n“I mean, those were the worst few days of my life,” Turner told the publication. “I remember I was on set, I was contracted to be on set for another two weeks, so I couldn’t leave. My kids were in the States, and I couldn’t get to them because I had to finish Joan. And all these articles started coming out.”\n\nShe continued, “It hurt because I really do completely torture myself over every move I make as a mother – mum guilt is so real! I just kept having to say to myself, ‘None of this is true. You are a good mum, and you’ve never been a partier.'”\n\nWhile there are some things the Do Revenge actress can’t publicly discuss for legal reasons, she previously claimed that she learned about their split when the media did after Jonas filed for divorce. Then, it wasn’t long before the stories about her being a “wayward mother” began.\n\n“I mean, it’s unfathomable the amount of people that will just make shit up and put it up based on a picture,” she said. “A picture might tell a thousand words, but it’s not my story. It felt like I was watching a movie of my life that I hadn’t written, hadn’t produced or starred in. It was shocking. I’m still in shock.”\n\nShe recalled there were days when she didn’t know if she was “going to make it.” She would call her lawyer saying, “‘I can’t do this. I just can’t.’ I was just never strong enough to stand up for myself.” After two weeks of feeling that way, Turner’s lawyer reminded her she was fighting for her children, and that’s all she needed to hear.\n\n“Once anyone says to me, ‘Do it for your kids,’ I’m doing it,” she added. “I wouldn’t do it for myself, but I’ll find the strength for them.”\n\nFollowing the news of the split, Turner was seen hanging out with Taylor Swift on several occasions. The singer-songwriter briefly dated Jonas when she was 18, and their split is said to be the inspiration for her song “Forever & Always” from her Fearless album.\n\n“Taylor was an absolute hero to me this year,” The Staircase star said. The women had met about 10 years prior to becoming friends. When Turner was in New York in September without somewhere to stay, she reached out to Swift to see if she might know someone who was renting a place. The Tortured Poets Department artist instead offered up her own place for free.\n\n“I’ve never been more grateful to anyone than I am for her because she took my children and me, and provided us with a home and a safe space,” the actress said. “She really has a heart of gold.”"
