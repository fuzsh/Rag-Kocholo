        "text": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas have worked out custody of their children, at least for now. In January of this year, Turner’s lawsuit against Jonas was dismissed, and the pair reached a custody agreement. Speaking to British Vogue, Turner says she’s “unhappy” with how it all went down, and dreams of a more peaceful co-parenting future for Willa and Delphine. “My dream is to have a huge Christmas where my daughters can have their dad there, Joe’s whole side of the family, their grandparents,” she says. “I don’t care about the politics, I just want the girls to feel loved and have everyone show up for them.”\n\nIn the same interview, Turner said the legal battle really took it out of her. “There were some days that I didn’t know if I was going to make it. I would call my lawyer saying, ‘I can’t do this. I just can’t.’ I was just never strong enough to stand up for myself,” she says. But her lawyer reminded her she was doing this for her kids: “Once anyone says to me, ‘Do it for your kids,’ I’m doing it. I wouldn’t do it for myself, but I’ll find the strength for them.” Turner cites Taylor Swift as an incredible support at this time, lending her a place to live in New York. “I’ve never been more grateful to anyone than I am for her because she took my children and me, and provided us with a home and a safe space,” she says. “She really has a heart of gold.”\n\nTurner also opened up about her feelings of alienation when living in 1) America and 2) the JoBro demimonde. As far as being a Jonas Wife, she bristled at having her identity effectively reduced to “groupie.” While living in America, Turner says she found the prevalence of gun violence in schools terrifying, and living in Miami alienating. “We were in this community full of 50-year-old men, so imagine trying to make friends on the dog walk,” she says. “I just felt like a little bird trapped in a gilded cage.”"
