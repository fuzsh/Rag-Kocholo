        "text": "Singer-songwriter Joe Jonas and “Game of Thrones” actress Sophie Turner are parting ways with their waterfront Miami mansion.\n\nThe celebrity couple found a buyer for their Bay Point estate at 4400 Island Road, according to the listings’ websites, which show a sale is pending. The property, in Miami’s Bay Point neighborhood, is asking $15.5 million.\n\nJonas and Turner paid $11 million for the 10,400-square-foot mansion, with six bedrooms and eight and a half bathrooms, in 2021. The renovated house sits on a 0.4-acre lot with a koi pond, wine cellar, fireplace and pool. Its previous owners include Cuban-American musician Willy Chirino. It was built in 1980.\n\nThe listing agent is Carl Gambino of Compass, who declined to comment.\n\nIf it trades for the current asking price, Turner and Jones will have sold it for 40 percent more than they paid less than two years ago. The home hit the market in November for nearly $17 million, and was re-listed in April.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nAbout a week after they acquired the Miami home, Jonas and Turner sold their Encino estate for $15.2 million.\n\nJonas had already spent some time in Miami before the purchase. In 2019, he and brothers Nick and Kevin filmed their music video for “Cool” in Miami in 2019.\n\nThe Bay Point sale went into contract in late April, according to a source.\n\nBay Point, north of downtown Miami and the Miami Design District, is among a number of South Florida neighborhoods where prices have grown dramatically in recent years — outside of already pricey areas like Miami Beach.\n\nIn February, the CEO of Adonel Concrete sold his waterfront mansion at 4505 Sabal Palm Road for $38.5 million, a new record for Bay Point. That was more than double the previous record, which was the $18 million sale of the waterfront home at 580 Sabal Palm Road."
