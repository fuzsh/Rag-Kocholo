Doha\n\nDoha is the capital city of Qatar and is home to 2.5 million people. Located on the coast of the Persian Gulf in the east of the country, this is one of the most popular places for tourists to stay. It has long and extremely hot summers and warm winters. As a result, people prefer visiting this area during colder seasons. It includes multiple museums and architectural monuments, which make it a popular tourist destination.\n\n2.

Here, you will find the usual supermarkets and high-end designer stores. Moreover, it consists of a cinema, bowling alley, ice rink, and food court.\n\n7. Doha Corniche\n\nSituated in the West Bay, Doha Corniche is a waterfront promenade extending for about 7km. It is often considered the vantage point of most iconic pictures of Doha. Taking long strolls on these roads will give you peace of mind as you enjoy the stunning view of this city's skyline.\n\nIn addition, most celebrations of national holidays, including Qatar National Day and National Sports Day, are centred on the Corniche, making it a popular tourist destination.\n\n8.

It is surrounded by traditional Arabic architecture, a mosque and numerous stalls selling all kinds of traditional Arabic clothing, spices and souvenirs. Moreover, you will be able to explore the delicious street food of Qatar here in small eateries like Baba Chapatea. The best part is that it is close to the sea, which creates a beautiful ambience and stunning visuals.\n\n11. Fuwairit Beach\n\nFuwairit is often considered one of the most beautiful beaches in Qatar, attracting beach lovers worldwide. Unfortunately, it is about 100 km from Doha, which makes it slightly difficult to reach. Therefore, you will need a private car for an off-road experience while driving up to this beach.\n\nHowever, once you get here, the journey will seem worth it. The beach and its adjoining hills offer a perfect spot for sunbathing and relaxation. If you are interested in photography, you can visit the Coral Hills.\n\n12. Khor Al Adaid\n\nAs you pass by the breathtaking highway 8 near to Peloponnese Peninsula, ensure to stop at the Corinth Canal area. Please park your car near the destination and walk on the bridge to praise the builders' craft as they managed to dig deep down to build a canal. Then, you can enjoy a pleasant boat ride from one end of the canal and back.\n\nConsidering the most famous things in Qatar, there can be various factors besides places. These are listed below.\n\n13. The 2022 FIFA World Cup\n\nThis is one of the major events that are making Qatar famous recently. The much-awaited FIFA World Cup of 2022 will be held in Qatar, its first occurrence in any Middle Eastern country. The popularity of this event is evident from the growing investment already made in it. Moreover, it will be the first-ever winter World Cup, attracting tourists and sports lovers from across the globe.\n\n14. Qatar Airways\n\nWhile listing the famous things of Qatar, one might consider its airline. Qatar Airways is one of the largest, operating across 150 destinations. The 5-star flights of this airline have gained popularity, as these offer exceptional hospitality and luxury options to travellers. Moreover, this airline has operated multiple new-age aircraft, including A380, A350, and the Dreamliner.\n\n15. Pearls\n\nOver the years, Qatar has gained popularity for being a centre of producing and distributing pearls. Pearl production is the backbone of this country's economy. Cheaper pearls from places like Japan have reduced the popularity of Qatar's pearls. However, if you are looking for real pearls, you can always purchase these while visiting Qatar. The entire Persian Gulf is used for pearl hunting in Qatar.\n\n16. Gas and Oil Exports\n\nThe growing economy of Qatar is a result of its successful exports. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) by the state-owned Qatar Petroleum company is the biggest export object. Its supremacy is evident as it controls 14% of the world’s natural gas reserves. Moreover, Qatar is the second-largest exporter of natural gas. Oil production has contributed to Qatar's national economy since 1940, and its quality has made it famous worldwide.\n\n17. Al Jazeera Media\n\nThe Al Jazeera Media Network is one of Qatar's biggest state-run news and media houses. It has gained a positive reputation for covering news and current affairs in English and Arabic. Emir Sheikh Ḥamad ibn Khalīfah Āl Thānī started this broadcasting house in 1996, and since then, it has gained fame from the viewers for covering a huge range of topics while staying unbiased.\n\n18. Falconry\n\nThe wildlife of Qatar also adds to its fame and popularity among tourists. Falconry has therefore gained popularity, adding to Qatar's traditional culture. Furthermore, the nomadic Bedouin people of Qatar use Falcons to add to their hunting efforts, thereby turning it into a hobby. Moreover, this activity has been added to the ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List’ by UNESCO. This makes it a common tourist activity, which increases its attraction.\n\n19. Oryx\n\nIf you are into animals and wildlife, Qatar can bless your eyes with Oryx, the national animal of this city. In addition, you can catch the sight of a species of antelope, having distinctive long straight horns and a majestic presence. Unfortunately, even though there have been conservation efforts, such animals still roam free. Therefore, the harsh desert can fulfil your dreams of catching wildlife.\n\n20. Oud\n\nShopping for souvenirs is common when visiting a foreign country. Among other things, you can find Oud, which is a quintessential Qatari perfume. Even though duplicate fragrances with this name are available worldwide, authentic Oud is only available in the local stores of Qatar. These come in small glass vials; you can take dabs of the aromatic liquid. Moreover, this brand also offers wood and oil.\n\n21. Textiles\n\nWhile visiting Qatar, you can explore an impressive range of woollen textiles. Among these, pashmina shawls are the most popular. These shawls are available across the world at a high price. However, you can find them at a much lower range in Qatar. Apart from that, you can also purchase woollen clothing items and stack them for winter, as these are available at a lower price range.\n\n22. Al Dhakira Mangroves\n\nIf you feel exhausted from the heat and desert, you can travel to Al Dhakira Mangroves for some natural beauty. It is located in Mangrove Bay. Further, you can use a kayak to explore this Arabic jungle and capture photographs. Moreover, you will find local wildlife, including reef egrets, terns and herons, while paddling to the country's northeastern coast. Al Dhakira is also a fishing spot for those who are interested.\n\nHopefully, now you know what Qatar is famous for. As this article pointed out, this place consists of multiple places, attractions and things which can keep you engaged as a tourist. Moreover, you can explore Arabian history and culture by visiting the museums. Overall, even though it is known for being a commercial area, Qatar will be your perfect holiday destination."
