        "text": "Riyadh (AsiaNews / Agencies) â€“ Shelving almost two years of severe tensions, Saudi Arabia has invited Qatar to two emergency summit meetings in Arab countries, scheduled for May 30th in Mecca. At the center of the summits is the ongoing clash - so far only verbal, but there is a strong risk of a military escalation as threatened by the White House itself - between the United States and Iran, which could destabilize the entire Middle Eastern region.\n\nThe news was given by the Doha Foreign Ministry, which says that the Emir of Qatar Sheik Tamim ben Hamad al-Thani \"received a written message\" inviting his government to participate in the meetings in the holy city. In recent days the head of Doha diplomacy Mohammed ben Abdelrahmane al-Thani received the secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (CCG) Abdullatif al-Zayani, to mend relations in the Arab world.\n\nOn May 18, Riyadh called for a meeting of the CCP countries and the Arab League following several \"incidents\" from the surrounding mysterious occurrences in the Gulf waters. Among the reasons for concern are the recent attacks by drones launched by Houthi rebel militias in Yemen towards Saudi Arabia's oil pipelines.\n\nSaudi Arabia has called the Mecca summit for May 30 to \"discuss aggression and its consequences on the region\". It is, the note adds, \"to consult and coordinate with the brother leaders\" about \"all the issues likely to reinforce the security and stability of the region\".\n\nThe Arab countries therefore seem intent on closing ranks, filing recent grievances, facing the common Iranian \"threat\". In recent days, the Qatari foreign minister had called for a \"dialogue\" between Iran and the United States, in an attempt to avert the arms race."
