        "text": "Iranian Azerbaijan is traditionally inhabited by Azeris, speaking a Turkic language, and Kurds, speaking an Iranian language. The region's formation in its current borders dates back to Turkmanchay Treaty of 1828. By that treaty, the boundary between the Russian Empire and Persia was set at the Aras River, and Persia ceded to Russia the control of several Azeri areas in the South Caucasus, which is now an independent country known as the Republic of Azerbaijan. Despite being a minority, the Azeri population in Iran is larger than the population of independent Azerbaijan. Despite sharing a common cultural and linguistic heritage, due to centuries of separation under different political systems, the Azeris of Iran tend to be more conservative and religious than those of independent Azerbaijan.\n\nThis region, especially eastern parts of it, is probably one of the most beautiful places in Iran. The region is known for its friendly people, and also known for the great food.\n\nIranian Azerbaijan is comprised of four provinces: Ardabil, Zanjan, East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan."
