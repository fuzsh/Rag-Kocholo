        "text": "What is the terrain and geography like in Qatar?\n\nOverview\n\nA sovereign Arab State on the western shore of the Arabian Gulf, Qatar occupies a 4,200-square-mile peninsula and several small offshore islands. The Qatar Peninsula projects north into the Gulf for about 100 miles and has a maximum width of about 55 miles. The land is mainly flat (the highest point is 103 meters) and rocky. Notable features include coastal salt pans, elevated limestone formations (the Dukhan anticline) along the west coast, under which lies the Dukhan oil field, and massive dunes surrounding Khawr al Udayd, an inlet of the gulf in the southeast known to local English speakers as the Inland Sea.\n\nOf the islands belonging to Qatar, Halul is the most important. It lies about ninety kilometers east of Doha. A permanently settled island, it is a vital storage center and tanker terminal for three offshore oil fields. Hawar and the adjacent islands immediately off the west coast are the subject of a territorial dispute between Qatar and Bahrain.\n\nThe capital, Doha, is located on the central east coast on a sweeping (if shallow) harbor. Other ports include Umm Said, Al Khawr, and Al Wakrah. Only Doha and Umm Said can handle commercial shipping, although a large port and a terminal for loading natural gas are planned at Ras Laffan, north of Al Khawr. Coral reefs and shallow coastal waters make navigation difficult in areas where channels have not been dredged.\n\nIn the south, at the neck of the peninsula, Qatar borders the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Riyadh, the Saudi capital, lies 250 miles due west beyond the Jafura Desert.\n\nThe port of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, is about 150 nautical miles southeast. The vast Rub' al-Khali Desert, one of the largest and driest deserts in the world, lies below Abu Dhabi and extends to Qatar's southern border.\n\nBahrain is the nearest seaward neighbor to the north. Although Bahrain's capital, Manama, is 100 miles from Doha, only 20 miles separate the two countries at the narrowest part of the channel into the Gulf of Salwa.\n\nThe Gulf's eastern (Iranian) shore is 120 miles beyond Qatar's northern tip. The nearest Iranian port, Busheir, lies about 250 miles east of Doha. The Iraqi port of Basra, on the north shore of the Gulf, is 350 miles away. The southern Strait of Hormuz, 310 miles from Doha, provides access to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. Thus, Qatar occupies a central position in the Arabian Gulf.\n\nThe overall outline of the peninsula was not defined on European maps until well into the 19th century. However, Karsten Niebugh briefly described the arm in his Voyage en Arabie, published in Switzerland in 1780. The historical appearance of Qatari place names on European maps strongly suggests that, until recently, international navigators were familiar only with the northern end of the country and the eastern pearling banks.\n\nQatar's terrain is monotonously flat, except for the Dukhan anticline in the west and some low rock outcroppings at the northern end of the east coast. Blown sand covers much of the south, and shifting dunes predominate in the southeast. The Dukhan anticline rises from the west coast as a chain of separate hills of up to 325 feet in height, about 35 miles long and 3-5 miles wide, covering the country's onshore oil fields.\n\nNatural vegetation, including semipermanent pasture, is limited to areas surrounding wells, depressions, and short drainage courses active only after the winter rains. Most flora is confined to the northern half of the country. Elsewhere, only sparse patches of camel thorn and isolated date palm plantations relieve the featureless terrain.\n\nThe coastline is uneven and rises gently on both sides of the peninsula. Sandy reefs abound in the surrounding shallows. Extensive salt flats at the landward end of the peninsula, between Salwa on the west coast and Khor al-Odeid on the east, support the local belief that Qatar was once an island, separated from what is now the Saudi Province of al-Hasa. strategic location in central Persian Gulf near major petroleum deposits"
