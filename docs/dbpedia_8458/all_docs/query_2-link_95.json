        "text": "In 2023, I want to share the stories, humanity, and experience of my encounters with others who love to travel. In this second installment, I’m going to introduce you to the inspiring destination of Qatar.\n\nSituated in the Middle East, Qatar is surrounded by the Arabian Gulf on three sides and borders Saudi Arabia in the south. As one of the countries in the region that connects East and West, the Qatari government has conducted a ‘soft power’ investment in culture, sports, tourism, and branding to showcase its unique charms, which has gained the country very positive international recognition. The hosting of the 2022 World Cup placed Qatar in the center of the world stage, attracting 1.2 million tourists worldwide. In preparation for the World Cup, the country accelerated the construction of its tourism infrastructure, including transportation, accommodation, restaurants, entertainment, and scenic spots. The 2023 Asian Cup and other major events, such as the Formula One and the Doha International Horticultural Expo 2023, will also be held in Qatar.\n\nWhen it comes to Qatar, many people marvel at its wealth. Indeed, Qatar's per capita GDP has been consistently ranked one of the highest in the world, reaching nearly 70,000 US dollars in 2021. In addition, it is one of the most densely populated Arab countries, with about 3 million citizens and an average of 1.8 children in each family.\n\nDuring my visit, I felt a deep sense of the beauty and charm of its cultural tourism. This included some of the world's most modern cities, beautiful cultural venues, and a Middle Eastern ambience where the desert meets the ocean and the mysteries of the Islamic world are on display.\n\nIt was late at night when I landed in Qatar. Due to Qatar's current visa-free policy for Chinese tourists, there is no need for any prior visa arrangements, making the entire entry process smooth and convenient. Qatar Airways passengers who require transit time of over five hours at Doha Airport can enjoy the \"Doha City Tour\" offering short excursions within Qatar.\n\nOn the ride from the airport to the hotel, we passed the Doha Corniche, a waterfront promenade extending seven kilometres from which one can appreciate the prosperity and charm of Doha Bay. Qatar's urban nightscape lighting was also awe-inspiring. One end of the old city is brilliantly lit, allowing you to admire the Museum of Islamic Art and the National Museum of Qatar at night. Likewise, the CBD in the new district, with its bright neon-lit skyline of skyscrapers rising from the waterfront, reminded me of Singapore or Hong Kong, China.\n\n01 Museum Tour\n\nMy first stop was the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, which famed architect I.M. Pei designed at the age of 91. The museum is on an island by a seaside promenade, facing the Persian Gulf and surrounded by vast swaths of greenbelts. The museum gives the impression of a girl standing quietly by the sea, but a closer look reveals a specific undefinable power.\n\nThe exterior is French limestone, and the simple low-key geometric design provides a solid and imposing appearance against the seascape. At the same time, the sunlight and nightlights create an ever-changing profile of the building. My colleagues informed me that the Mosque of Ibn Tulun inspired the museum’s design. From the outside, it takes on the allure of a woman wearing a veil, with the upper part appearing as a gap in a crescent moon, like eyes exposed from behind a veil.\n\nThe interior design of the museum is even more ingenious. I was amazed by the multi-story atrium, which provided a sense of religious space while also housing a café beneath a silver dome facing the sea behind a giant glass curtain. Besides the building itself is a work of art, the many treasures in its collection spanning from the 7th century to the 19th century are not to be missed. These include the original manuscript of the medieval Persian epic \"Shahnameh\" (also known as \"the Book of Kings\"), the planispheric astrolabe invented by Persian mathematicians in the 10th century, and a carved emerald plaque from the defunct Mughal Dynasty.\n\nThe National Museum of Qatar is another masterpiece of world-class architectural design. Pritzker Prize-winning designer Jean Nouvel says, \"Everything about this museum is designed to make visitors feel the desert and the sea.\" It took quite a long time to build the museum due to its highly complicated-looking overlapping and interlocking facades.\n\nThe museum showcases the development of Qatar's early cities and houses numerous archaeological and historical treasures, manuscripts, photographs, jewellery, and clothing. The tour guide told me that the circular design of the exterior of the museum incorporates elements of the \"Desert Rose,\" which is not a plant but a rose-like natural phenomenon formed by the crystallization of desert minerals unique to arid coastal areas.\n\n02 Desert Trip\n\nThis piqued my curiosity, and I asked the driver to take me to see the real \"Desert Rose\" the next day.\n\nFrom a distance, I was shocked at its size, like mushroom clouds hovering over the desert - white and flawless, even crystalline under the sunlight, and very unique.\n\nThe four-wheel drive also brought me to the desert's edge, the Persian Gulf's seaside. The clear blue ocean blended with the yellow and white dunes to create a fantastic scene of intertwined sand and sea, full of visual impact.\n\nThe surprise of this desert trip was seeing the work of minimalist master Richard Serra: East- West/West-East. This is one of the loneliest works of art in the world.\n\nThe minimalist sculptor and photographer is known for producing spectacular abstract sculptures. As our vehicle moved through a desert as quiet and empty as the moon, there suddenly appeared four huge, stunning, and mysterious black monoliths standing vertically in a half-mile-long straight line along the east-west direction at irregular intervals like an \"iron and copper wall.\" The sharp color contrast made it stand out starkly against the brown desert, conveying a sense of loneliness and the passing of time.\n\nAlthough Serra's work is a landmark of Qatar, it is not on the radar of most tourists. I strongly recommend a visit to this off-the-beaten-track spot in the hope that more people will have the opportunity to see and appreciate it.\n\n03 Katara Cultural Village\n\nAfter admiring Serra's work, we drove back to Doha from the desert for a visit to the Katara Cultural Village.\n\nThe cultural village was financed and constructed during the reign of Qatari King Hamad. It was intended to preserve the traditional culture and aesthetics of Qatar and the Arab world to the greatest extent possible – a place for East and West to meet, exchange, and appreciate their cultures and various art disciplines without prejudice. The area is also home to the Qatar Fine Arts Association, the Qatar Photographic Society, the studios of Qatar Television, and the Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nThe entire cultural village is filled with a strong traditional Arabic atmosphere and Muslim cultural elements while there is no lack of fashion sense. Not only can you see mosques of various sects, but there is also an annual youth film festival held every November. The amphitheater boasts a chic atmosphere and natural echo effects.\n\nFurther on, I was amazed by the newly opened Qatar Galeries Lafayette. The interior of the traditional Muslim building was turned into a European ancient Roman-style space, which is eye-catching.\n\n04 Souq Waqif Traditional Night Market Tour\n\nAs night fell, I visited the traditional Souq Waqif market. Here, you can get lost in the intertwined alleys at any moment, as if you’ve entered the magical world of the One Thousand and One Nights.\n\nThe market is relatively empty during the day and gradually comes alive after nightfall. The shops stretch for miles. It is no exaggeration to say that one can find everything they want here: falcons, jackals, and even Aladdin's magic lamp! There is also a falcon market with local characteristics outside the primary market. Being the favorite \"pet\" of many Middle Eastern people, this kind of raptor is worth an exorbitant amount of money and has become a symbol of the owner's wealth and status.\n\nTraditional pearl divers meticulously crafted pearls in their workshops while men and children read and played chess in the teahouses. An enthusiastic old gentleman pulled me into a government-run chess hall where the players introduced me to “Dama” chess, a popular form in Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey. I didn’t last three games with them!\n\nSo many interesting things were hidden in the market; it was overwhelming. For example, I was very impressed by an Iranian restaurant named \"Parisa\" in the old market. \"Parisa\" means \"Fairy-like\" and this restaurant brought the style of Persian architecture to the extreme.\n\nUpon entering, one goes through a radiant passageway made up of thousands of pieces of crystal and colored glass, as if entering a time tunnel and falling into a holy Persian sanctuary instantly. I’m sure that shortly, as more tourists come to Qatar, this corridor will become a famous must-see spot.\n\nOn the last day of the trip, I was invited to meet with the Qatar Tourism Board and Qatar Airways, headed by CEO Mr. Akbar Al Baker, where the two sides signed a group cooperation agreement.\n\nMr. Al Baker is an international friend with deep affection for China. During the pandemic, he sent 91.9 tons of pandemic prevention supplies and donated 430,000 masks and 120,000 bottles of disinfectant to China when we needed them most. Under his leadership, Qatar Airways has become famous for its \"five-star service\" and has been rated number one in the world by the World Aviation Rating Company many times. At the same time, Qatar Airways is also the first foreign airline company to announce the opening of a global “green” channel for pandemic relief supplies. It has sent 250 passenger planes to support China's fight against the pandemic. Mr. Al Baker promised and guaranteed an air bridge for China-Qatar friendship.\n\nOn the way to and from the business meeting, we also passed the Fairmont & Raffles Hotels, the leading hotels of the World Cup. The complex was built with the national emblem of Qatar as its inspiration. With the Fairmont Hotel and the Raffles Hotel located in two semicircles, from a distance, the site conveys a strong sense of traveling back in time. Many people have joked that \"Qatar is full of Nobel Prizes in architecture.\" However, when you see it with your own eyes, you’ll know this is no exaggeration.\n\nAnd that concludes my short trip to Qatar. Besides the scenery, Qatar's cultural character impressed me most during this trip. As early as 2008, Qatar formulated the 2030 National Vision to free the country from dependence on the energy industry and avoid falling into the \"resource curse\" trap. Qatar's tourism, aviation, cultural, and sports industries are essential in reaching this goal. The 2022 World Cup allowed the world to witness firsthand Qatar's magnificent turnaround and how it has successfully enhanced the country's soft power. And these multicultural efforts will eventually turn \"witness\" into \"experience\" through tourism and exchange, thus placing Qatar's national calling card firmly in the hearts of people."
