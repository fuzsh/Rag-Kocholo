        "text": "The Qatar Grand Prix is a recent addition to the Formula 1 calendar, making its debut in 2021. The race is held at the Losail International Circuit, a track designed initially for MotoGP. The addition of the Qatar Grand Prix to the F1 calendar is a testament to the sport's flexibility and adaptability, especially in the face of global challenges such as the pandemic.\n\nâ\n\nThe Qatar Grand Prix fills a significant spot in the F1 calendar. Its addition is part of F1's expansion into the Middle East, following the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The Qatar Grand Prix is set to be a fixture in the F1 calendar for at least a decade, with a 10-year deal signed to host F1 from 2023 onwards.\n\nâ\n\nDescription of the Qatar circuit and its layout\n\nâ\n\nThe Losail International Circuit is a modern track located not far from the capital, Doha. The circuit is 5.380 kilometers long and features 16 corners, ten to the right and six to the left. The track is surrounded by synthetic turf designed to prevent desert sand from blowing onto it. The circuit also boasts an impressive lighting system for perfect night-time racing.\n\nâ\n\nQatar track map and unique features\n\nThe track's unique features include a long 1.068-kilometer main straight, which provides ample overtaking opportunities. The circuit was designed with motorbike racing in mind, resulting in a fast, flowing layout dominated by medium and high-speed corners.\n\nâ\n\nWeather predictions for Qatar during the 2024 race weekend\n\nâ\n\nThe Qatar Grand Prix is set to take place during the last weekend of November. Weather conditions in Doha during late November to early December are still very warm in comparison to other locations. Temperatures range from 19Â°C (66Â° F) to 26Â° C (78Â°F).While the heat can pose a challenge for both the drivers and the teams, it's important to remember that the race is usually held in the evening under floodlights, which can lead to cooler track temperatures. Despite Qatar's desert setting, rain is extremely rare, so it's likely the race will proceed without any weather interruptions.\n\nâ\n\nThe current weather in Doha:\n\nâ\n\nQatar GP lap record and its history\n\nâ\n\nThe lap record for the Losail International Circuit is held by Max Verstappen, who set a time of 1:23.196 during the 2021 race.

Max Verstappen came home to take first place, also securing his third World Driver's Championship.\n\nâ\n\nQatar Grand Prix 2024 dates and schedule\n\nâ\n\nThe 2024 Qatar Grand Prix, an exciting fixture in the Formula 1 calendar, is scheduled to take place from November 29th to December 1st.

It's recommended to book early to secure the best seats and prices.\n\nâ\n\nNavigating Qatar time and time zone considerations\n\nâ\n\nQatar operates on Qatar Standard Time, which is 3 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC+3).
