        "text": "Overview\n\nUrmia (Orumieh) is the largest city in West Azerbaijan province of Iran. Urmia is situated at an altitude of 1,330 m above sea level, and is located along the Shahar Chay river (City River) on the Urmia Plain. Lake Urmia, one of the world's largest salt lakes, lies to the east of the city and the mountainous Turkish border area lies to the west. Urmia is the 10th most populated city in Iran. The city's inhabitants are predominantly Azerbaijanis, with minorities of Kurds, Armenians and Assyrians as well as Iran's official language, Persian. The city is the trading center for a fertile agricultural region where fruits (especially apples and grapes) and tobacco are grown. The Christian history in Urmia, Iran should be noted first. It is highly, and most intricately preserved. Especially seen in the many churches, and cathedrals. There were villages in the Urmia plain as early as 2000 BC, with their civilization under the influence of the Kingdom of Van. The excavations of the ancient ruins near Urmia led to the discovery of utensils that date to the 20th century BC.
