        "text": "Qatar is a small country covering an area of approximately 11,572 sq. km, while the number of its population is 2,668,811 according to latest estimates conducted by the Qatar Statistics Authority in January 2020. Of the population, 1,936,214 are male and 748,115 are female (Qatar Statistics Authority, December, 2020). Moreover, the population of Qatar by age group is as follows: 14.70% (less than 15 years old), 10.30% (15–24 years old), 73.51% (25–64 years old), and 1.49% (above 65 years old).\n\nQatar is located in the east of the Arabian Peninsula in Southwest Asia overlooking the Gulf, bordering the south of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and bordering the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain on the sea. Qatari citizens have the highest income in the world. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate of Qatar’s per capita income is expected to reach USD 61,940.00 by the end of 2021, up from $109,900 in 2012. Moreover, econometric models predict that the Qatar GDP per capita will project to around USD 62,100.00 in 2022.\n\nThe farthest two points in Qatar are 160 km apart, while the maximum width, which is roughly in the middle of the peninsula, is 80 km. Beaches and sand dunes are predominantly found along the eastern coast, especially at Khor Al-Udeid and Mesaieed. Qatar’s terrain is characterized by many geographical phenomena, including a large number of bays and inland seas scattered along the seaboard. In addition to this, there is the phenomenon of basins and depressions, called the Riyadh, which are located in the central north part of the most fertile sites that are rich in natural vegetation, while the southeast is arid desert sand. Qatar has ten provinces (Ad Dawhah, Al Ghuwariyah, Al Jumaliyah, Al Khawr, Al Wakrah, Ar Rayyan, Jariyan al Batnah, Ash Shamal, Umm Salal, Mesaieed). It also has 12 main cities (Doha, Al Wakrah, Al Khor, Al Khuwayr, Ar Rayyan, Ar Ru’ays, Dukhan, Ras Laffan, Umm Bab, Umm Sa’id, Umm Salal Ali, Umm Salal Muhammad).\n\nQatar gained its independence from the United Kingdom on September 3, 1971. The current Prince Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who was born in June 3, 1980, is the ninth ruler from the ruling family. He assumed power on June 25, 2013, launching a new era of reforms at all levels, especially sports, health, tourism, and economic and political development.\n\nIn 2020, Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz Al Thani was appointed as Prime Minister and Minister of Interior. The cabinet, which is formed under an Emiri decree, is the highest executive authority in the country, and the Prince must approve all laws and legislations. The Shura Council was founded in 1972 by Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al-Thani, who was mandated under the modified Provisional Constitution to organize the contemporary state’s structure and institutions. The Shura Council consists of 45 seats with 30 elected seats and 15 appointed by the Amir. Qatar held its first-ever Shura Council elections on October 2, 2021, which saw an impressive voter turnout of 63.5%. The Supreme Judicial Council, working independently, manages judicial affairs. At the end of the year 1999, the Prince formed a higher ministerial council mandated to examine planning for economic and industrial growth of the country in the future considering global trends.\n\nQatar is one of those small countries that the international community and its bodies and organizations have long been concerned about its weakness. The issue of vulnerability of small states was a persistent feature in international relations literature during the 1960s and 1970s. The literature tended to emphasize the limitations that size imposes on the ability of states to function competitively in the international political and economic arenas. The growth and proven track records of many small states since that period has reduced those earlier concerns. This does not, however, diminish concerns about the particular problems and risks that small states may face. International organizations such as the United Nations have commissioned researchers and research centers to prepare studies on the problems that small states confront. Titles of papers on small states frequently feature terms and phrases such as “problems,” “vulnerability,” and “small is dangerous.” In addition to these internal characteristics, small states are held to be particularly vulnerable to external forces. Their small size and strategic locations may embroil them in international politics. Particularly, larger regional or greater world powers may force a small state to acquiesce in an unequal bilateral relationship (political, security, military, economic, etc.). This increases security concerns for both the small states and the international system as a whole. Thus, small states must necessarily adopt a more defensive attitude than larger states. Peterson argues that small states must adopt at least some of several complementary strategies for survival, such as:\n\n1.\n\nStrategic good-neighborliness with neighboring countries.\n\n2.\n\nStrategic regional and international alliances.\n\n3.\n\nA strategy of creating a national brand and build a unique regional and international position.\n\nThis becomes more significant as the geopolitical region in which Qatar is located witnessed numerous political events over the past decades that increased the concerns of the Qatar. Some of these events are:\n\n1.\n\nThe Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which raised concerns of small countries in the Gulf region. Qatar was particularly concerned, as it is geopolitically located between the two rivals of the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, increasing the possibility of falling victim to the competition over geopolitical domination in the region. Watching the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, Qatar has also witnessed the tension between Iran and the UAE over three islands in the early 1970s, and the long history of the border dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia which ended only a decade years ago, on the July 6, 2008, with the two countries signing the final demarcation agreement after nearly 35 years of a border dispute that amounted to an armed clash in 1992.\n\n2.\n\nThe former Qatari leadership, which came to power on June 27, 1995, felt that some major regional countries, i.e., Saudi Arabia and Egypt, did not welcome the new regime of Qatar, considering it a source of concern. This Saudi and Egyptian attitude, the following border dispute, political conflicts, and media skirmishes have deepened Qatari fears regarding the possibility that one of the countries in the region may act against Qatar as Iraq did against Kuwait and therefore “devour” its smaller neighbor with a covering from some regional players.\n\nThus, it is prudent for Qatar to devise strategies that stand a good chance of enhancing its sovereignty and survivability. The 2008 declaration of Qatar’s National Vision could be comprehended in the context of the strategies which provide a good opportunity to strengthen the role of Qatar in the region. The National Vision “aims at transforming Qatar into an advanced country by 2030, capable of sustaining its own development and providing for a high standard of living for all of its people for generations to come.”\n\nQatar’s National Vision belongs to the government, the private sector, civil society and to all Qatari citizens. I call on all to work hard and utilize your expertise to help achieve the goals of the Vision and to advance our nation’s development. In this way, we will build a bright future for the people of Qatar.\n\nTamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, July 2008 (Qatar Vision 2030, p. 4)\n\nIn 2008, the Qatari government specified that Qatar had to balance five key challenges in order to remain true to its values. These five main challenges, as stated in National Vision 2030, include the following.\n\n3.4.1 Modernization and Preservation of Traditions\n\nThe pressures of competitiveness and modern working patterns may contradict with the traditional relations based upon trust and personal connections and produce difficulties and tensions for family life. Furthermore, accompanying economic and social progress entails greater freedom and wider selections which can potentially create challenges to deep-rooted social values highly cherished by society. However, it is always possible to combine values and culture with modernism and modern life styles.\n\n3.4.2 The Needs of This Generation and the Needs of Future Generations\n\nQatar meets the needs of this generation with simultaneously considering the needs of future generations. Through the process of intergenerational justice, Qatar aims to secure the rights of future generations by compensating for depletion of non-renewable resources via creation of new sources of renewable wealth. The National Vision aims to select the route that creates a balance between the interests of the current generation with those of future generations.\n\n3.4.3 Managed Growth and Uncontrolled Expansion\n\nWhile Qatar is expanding its economy activities, this growth and explanation should be conducted at a pace that is in accordance with the realistic expectations of sustainable improvements in livelihoods and quality of life so as not to restrain the Qatari economy and derail the country from its well-defined goals.\n\n3.4.4 The Size and the Quality of the Expatriate Labor Force and the Selected Path of Development\n\nCurrently, Qatar is experiencing a noticeable increase in its population due to the rising government expenditure, urban development, and large-scale foreign investment. Since the compositions of populations exert a significant impact on the nature of the society, the country needs to decide on the quality of labor force and the size of the population. As such, the National Vision assesses the outcomes of recruiting expatriate workforces in regard to their housing and public service needs and cultural rights and weighs the potential negative effects this might have on Qatari national identity.\n\n3.4.5 Economic Growth, Social Development, and Environmental Management\n\nThe National Vision also purports to make sure that economic development and the environment are not sacrificed for the sake of the other. Thus, Qatar should direct its future development path so as to make it in accordance with the requirement and needs of protecting and conserving the environment. If there are environmental costs for economic growth, investments should be made on technologies that assist in improving the environment.\n\nQatar’s National Vision for 2030 was approved under Emiri Decree No. 44 in 2008. One of the most important major goals of the national development strategy is to develop a general framework for the growth of Qatar and to diversify its economy, reducing its exclusive dependence on the oil and gas sector. The vision illustrates in detail the goals of Qatar in various fields and levels as follows:\n\nThe continued development of world-class infrastructure, to ensure that Qatar will continue to be a favorite destination for visitors and investors from the region and the whole world.\n\nA comprehensive world-class education system and healthcare system whose services are accessible to the whole population.\n\nTo provide a prosperous way of life for all Qatari citizens and to provide opportunities to those who need them most, such as women, people with limited physical capabilities, or young people who need empowerment to play an active role in their country, supporting their government, governmental institutions, and the private sector.\n\nIncreasing the effective participation of Qataris in the labor force by providing tools and opportunities for citizens to contribute to the economy and get rewarding jobs.\n\nPreserve Qatar’s national culture, in terms of promoting the tolerant nature of Qatari society, and embrace the Islamic values of justice, solidarity, and social and charitable work as well as supporting inherited customs and traditions. The national development strategy also prioritizes the preservation of the national architectural character and the traditional Qatari lifestyle.\n\nThe Qatari Government Communications Office, on its website, clarifies that the National Vision foresees development through four interconnected pillars of human development, social development, economic development, and environmental development (see Fig. 3.1).\n\n3.5.1 Human Development\n\nEducation is one of the basic pillars of social progress. The state shall ensure, foster and endeavor to spread it.\n\nPermanent Constitution\n\nThe first pillar of the National Vision is human development. The National Vision asserts that Qatar’s natural resources will eventually run out, consequently, the future of the country is in the hands of Qatari people who should function successfully in future’s knowledge-based and extremely competitive world. To this end, Qatar aims to advance and optimize its educational and health system. This is going to be operationalized through offering world-class educational system that presents Qatari people with first-rare educations. Moreover, Qatar is going to turn itself to a center for intellectual activity and scientific research in order to support human development. Also, the world-class healthcare system should be achieved.\n\n3.5.2 Social Development\n\nThe family is the basis of the society. A Qatari family is founded on religion, ethics, and patriotism. The law shall regulate adequate means to protect the family, support its structure, strengthen its ties, and protect maternity, childhood, and old age.\n\nPermanent Constitution\n\nSocial development is considered as the second pillar of the program for 2030. The National Vision 2030 specifies that Qatar wants to foster and develop the social aspects of its society by nurturing citizens who are able to deal with the needs of the age they are in both effectively and flexibly. The vision also aspires to create strong and coherent Qatari family that relishes support, care, and social protection. Women play an important role in the Qatar’s plan for development, and they are integral parties involved in economic and political decision-making. Surely, a sound social structure will help Qatar to preserve its national heritage, enhance Islamic and Arab values, establish a secure society, and empower its citizens to activity take part in all endeavors needed for the development of the country. Moreover, Qatar aims to foster benevolence, tolerance, and friendly dialogue and cultural exchange with people from other cultures within the Arab and Islamic world. Additionally, Qatar is commented to its responsibility to contribute to peace and international security around the world.\n\n3.5.3 Economic Development\n\nThe State shall guarantee freedom of economic enterprise on the basis of social justice and balanced cooperation between private and public activity in order to achieve socio-economic development, increase in production, achieve public welfare, raise standard of living, and provide job opportunities in accordance with the provision of the law.\n\nPermanent Constitution\n\nThe third pillar of the National Vision focuses on economic development by pinpointing that economy is the foundation for prosperity and steady development. It also specifies that natural resources should be consumed in a way that future generations possess sufficient means to meet their aspirations. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to manage these resources and keep a balance between production and reserves. The National Vision emphasizes that hydrocarbon resources should be utilized to ensure secure development for all Qatari citizens. Particularly, it mentions that “Converting these natural assets into financial wealth provides a means to invest in world-class infrastructure; build efficient delivery mechanisms for public services; create a highly skilled and productive labor force; and support the development of entrepreneurship and innovation capabilities” (National Vision, 2030, p. 24). Of course, the vision has considered some strategies to achieve these goals, empowering the private sector, training and supporting entrepreneurs, and providing financial and non-financial support mechanisms.\n\nOf course, Qatari government aims to do this through “a pathway that delivers prosperity yet avoids economic imbalances and stresses” (National Vision, 2030, p. 25). In so doing, the economic development should be aware of all the risks that may hinder or deter economic development. As such, it seems reasonable for the system to ensure low inflation rates, sound financial policy, and a safe and efficient financial system to pave the way for economic stability and growth. The National Vision has envisaged that coordination with Gulf Cooperation Council countries and with other Arab and regional economic organizations to start financial ties, trade, and investment can significantly help achieve these defined goals. The vision has also considered some strategies for reducing dependence on oil and gas and diversifying economy. Some of these strategies are (1) having a knowledge-based economy featured by a transparent and accountable government creativity and innovation, excellence in education, entrepreneurship, the efficient delivery of public services, and a world-class infrastructure, (2) developing and designing economic activities in which Qatar can provide the human needs or technical expertise, and (3) expanding services and industries with competitive advantages resultant from hydrocarbon industries.\n\n3.5.4 Environmental Development\n\nThe State shall preserve the environment and its natural balance in order to achieve comprehensive and sustainable development for all generations.\n\nPermanent Constitution\n\nWe need to care for our natural environment for it was entrusted to us by God to use with responsibility and respect for the benefit of human kind. If we nurture our environment, it will nurture us.\n\nMozah bint Nasser Al-Misnid\n\nThe fourth pillar of the National Vision 2030 is environmental development. The vision aims to plan for preserving and protecting the nature in Qatar. Thus, any economic and developmental pattern will be conducted by taking environmental protection into consideration. The National Vision 2030 (p. 30) specifies that “the environmental pillar will be increasingly important as Qatar is forced to deal with local environmental issues, such as the impact of diminishing water and hydrocarbon resources, and the effects of pollution and environmental degradation, as well as international environmental issues such as the potential impact of global warming on water levels in Qatar and thereby on coastal urban development.” Moreover, the vision aims to raise the population’s awareness about the importance of protecting nature, to enforce necessary legal enactments that protect all elements of the nature and environment, and to work with effective and sophisticated institutions that motivate citizens to use environmentally friendly technologies.\n\nThe former Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, in a speech at a seminar on Qatar’s National Strategy, held in Doha on October 28 and 29, 2008, asserted that:\n\nAchievement of the National Vision is a collective responsibility that will be motivated and led by the state, in partnership with the private sector, civil society, and academia. At all levels, we are all responsible for the formation and implementation of a National Strategy.\n\nThe General Secretariat for Development Planning website states that Qatar’s National Vision will choose the developmental path that carefully balances the needs of the current generation with the needs of future generations. It also opts for the developmental requirements and, at the same time, seeks to preserve the traditions and characteristics that distinguish the country from the others and maintain and promote these traditions.\n\nMore importantly, this strategy is developed in a collaborative effort at the level of Qatar as a whole, as it involved all groups of Qatari society. It can be called “a strategy for Qatar … made in Qatar which is developed by people of Qatar, for the people of Qatar.” The national development strategy was prepared according to a consultative mechanism, with large-scale participation from all segments of society in order for the national strategy to reflect the aspirations and dreams of all Qataris.\n\nThe national development strategy is the vehicle that will take it there, ensuring unparalleled standards of living and allowing all Qataris—men, women, and youth—to fulfill their potential and realize their dreams and ambitions. The national development strategy will bring tangible benefits to all Qataris, which will be felt in their everyday lives and on every level, from enhancing the economic environment for businesses, investors, and job seekers, presenting better opportunities for education, more holistic healthcare, and more efficient government services.\n\nReturning to the previously discussed process of building the national brand, it is noted that the case of Qatar represents a rare model in the Arab region in terms of practical application and even professional to the theory of nation branding, as well as the principles, terms, and conditions for the ideal branding. The beginning was in 2008, when the Qatari Supreme Will determined to ratify Qatar’s Vision for 2030. This vision reflects the political will and strategic vision of Qatar’s political leadership. In a further step toward the formulation of this vision, the government of Qatar called on all governmental parties, the private sector, and civil society to form working groups identifying their missions as follows:\n\nWorking Group I: Qatar’s National Strategy, issues and challenges\n\nWorking Group II: The formulation of national strategies, stakeholder participation and capacity building, best practices and lessons learned from international experiences\n\nWorking Group III: National strategies based on results, setting goals, monitoring and evaluation, best practices, and lessons that can be learned from international experiences\n\nThe General Secretariat for Development Planning adopted a thoughtful and detailed framework to produce a national development strategy, based on cooperation and coordination among all stakeholders, allowing the collection of ideas and suggestions from these entities and including them within the recommendations of the strategy. Practically, periodic meetings and workshops were held in which various sectors of society participated introducing their views, opinions, and suggestions in their respective competence regarding the national development strategy. At the same time, there were a variety of other channels enabling continuous and active dialogue and communication between the General Secretariat for Development Planning and citizens and residents of Qatar, as well as all stakeholders.\n\nRegarding the case of Qatar, after about 13 years of ratifying the National Vision 2030, with the detailed analysis and the guidance of theoretical rules of Qatar’s nation branding, as well as the elements and tools that were employed to ensure the comprehensiveness of the process horizontally and vertically, the elements and tools were overlapped and intertwined compatibly and integrally in an ideal process of building a distinctive and sustainable nation brand for Qatar. Overall, this chapter presented an overview of the status of Qatar and its status in the region. Moreover, this chapter discussed different geographical, demographical, economical, and political characteristics of Qatar. The next chapter discusses the Qatar nation brand in regard to different profiles."
