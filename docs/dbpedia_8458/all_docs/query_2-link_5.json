        "text": "Qatar, a small peninsular nation, lies on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, sharing a sole land border with Saudi Arabia to the south and surrounded by the Persian Gulf on all other sides. The country spans an area of approximately 11,571 km2 (4,468 mi2).\n\nThe Deserts: The landscape of Qatar is primarily flat and barren desert. Sand dunes dominate the southern part of the country, especially in the area known as the Khor al Adaid, or the \"Inland Sea\". These dunes can reach impressive heights and shift with the winds, creating an ever-changing terrain. To the north and west, the terrain turns slightly rockier and features low-rising limestone formations. The highest point in the country, Qurain Abu al-Bawl, is located here but it is only reaches 103 m (338 ft). It has been marked on the map by a yellow upright triangle.\n\nThe Salt Flats: One of the most distinct geographical features of Qatar is its salt flats or sabkhas. They form as a result of the country's high evaporation rates, which leave behind salt deposits. These salt flats are especially prevalent in the areas close to the coast, where tidal actions regularly flood the low-lying regions and then rapidly evaporate, leaving the salt deposits behind.\n\nMan-made Greenery: Despite its desert landscape, Qatar does have some green areas. These include man-made green spaces in urban centers like Doha, as well as natural vegetation found in the northern regions where rainfall is slightly higher. Here, wild plants such as the Sidra tree, which is a symbol of Qatar, can thrive."
