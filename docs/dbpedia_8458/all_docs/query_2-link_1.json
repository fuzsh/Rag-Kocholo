Later in the same year, its name was changed to Municipality of Doha by Law No. 15. Then, on 17 July 1972, Ar Rayyan, Al Wakrah, Al Khawr and Dhekra, Ash Shamal, and Umm Salal municipalities created under Resolution No.11. In 1997, Umm Sa'id municipality formed from parts of Al Wakrah (former HASC code QA.WA, FIPS code QA05) and Jariyan al Batnah (QA.JB, QA07).\n\nIn 2004, Al Daayen municipality created under Resolution No. 13. Judging from maps of the municipalities before and after this change, Al Daayen was formed from parts of Umm Salal and Al Khawr; at the same time, Al Ghuwariyah merged with Al Khawr; Al Jumaliyah merged with Ar Rayyan; and Jarayan al Batnah was split between Ar Rayyan and Al Wakrah.\n\nIn 2014, the western city of Al-Shahaniya was dissociated from Al Rayyan Municipality to form its own municipality. Integrating approximately 35% of Al Rayyan's area into the new municipality, some of Al Rayyan's western localities such as Al Gharbiam, Al Utouriya, Al Jemailiya, Umm Bab, Rawdat Rashed, Al Nasraniya, Dukhan and Al Khurayb were also included in the new municipality.[4]\n\nMunicipalities\n\n[edit]\n\nKey Municipality\n\n(Baladiyah) بلدية Population\n\n(2015)[5] Area\n\n(km2) Area\n\n(mi2) 1 Al Shamal الشمال 8,794 859.8 331.9 2 Al Khor الخور 202,031 1,613.3 622.8 3 Al-Shahaniya الشحانية 187,571 3,309.0 1,277.6 4 Umm Salal أم صلال 90,835 318.4 122.9 5 Al Daayen الضعاين 54,339 290.2 112.0 6 Ad Dawhah (Doha) الدوحة 956,457 202.7 78.3 7 Al Rayyan الريان 605,712 2,450 946.0 8 Al Wakrah الوكرة 299,037 2,577.7 995.2 Dawlat Qatar دولة قطر 2,404,776 11,621.1 4,486.7\n\nFormer municipalities\n\n[edit]\n\nAl Jemailiya (until 2004)[7]\n\nAl Ghuwariyah (until 2004)[7]\n\nJariyan al Batnah (until 2004)[7]\n\nMesaieed (Umm Sa'id) (until 2006)[8]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nISO 3166-2:QA\n\nQatar National Day\n\nList of cities in Qatar"
