        "text": "A helicopter carrying President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday in the country’s mountainous northwest, according to state media, deepening the turmoil that has gripped the nation on both the international and domestic fronts in recent months.\n\nMr. Raisi, 63, was traveling from Iran’s border with Azerbaijan to inaugurate a joint dam project. The helicopter, carrying Mr. Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, state media reported, crashed near the city of Varzaghan around 1 p.m. local time, in bad weather and thick fog.\n\nSearch and rescue teams scoured an area of tall mountains and dense forest through rain and fog for more than 10 hours. At one point the authorities called off the aerial search because of the weather, dispatching on foot soldiers, elite commandos of the Revolutionary Guards and 40 rescue teams to locate the crash site.\n\nEven well into the night, state media had not yet reported on casualties, or on the condition of the president or anyone else aboard. The cause of the crash was also unknown."
