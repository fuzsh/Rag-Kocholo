        "text": "The Middle East is a region that spans parts of Western Asia and North Africa. It is home to several countries that are culturally, historically, and religiously significant. The region is characterized by its diverse landscapes, including deserts, mountains, and coasts. The Middle East has a rich history and is known for its contributions to art, science, and literature. The region is also known for its political tensions, including conflicts related to religion, resources, and borders. Some major conflicts include World War I, World War II, the Arab-Israeli Wars , the Iran-Iraq War, and the Persian Gulf Wars. Overall, the Middle East is a fascinating and complex region with a rich cultural heritage.\n\nIf you want to discover more in-depth information on the Middle East as a region, check out our Profiles of Middle Eastern Countries!\n\nTest your regional knowledge with our arts and culture quiz on Middle Eastern Mythological Creatures!\n\nClick on a country for a more detailed map, or try our map index.\n\nHistory of the Middle East\n\nThe Middle East has a rich and complex history that spans thousands of years. It is home to some of the oldest civilizations in the world, including Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), Persia (modern-day Iran), and Egypt. Throughout history, the Middle East has been marked by numerous power changes, with many different empires vying for control over the region, like the Ottoman Empire. The region has also been the site of numerous conflicts and wars throughout history, including the Crusades, World War I, and the Gulf War.\n\nGeography of the Middle East\n\nThe Middle East is situated at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is bordered by multiple oceans and seas: the Mediterranean Sea to the west, the Red Sea to the south, the Caspian Sea to the east, and the Arabian Peninsula to the south. Several countries also border the Persian Gulf, namely, Iran and Saudi Arabia. The entire region is home to a diverse range of landscapes, including deserts, mountains, and coastal plains.\n\nMiddle Eastern Exceptions\n\nIt should be noted that although countries like Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Pakistan, and select other Levant countries do share a similar cultural heritage and historic importance, they are not actually categorized as “Middle Eastern” countries. Instead, their position on the world map allows them to fall under the jurisdiction of South or Central Asia.\n\nAdditionally, areas like the Gaza Strip and West Bank have long been contested between Palestinian and Israeli politics, as well as other partially recognized states in the Middle East that have had close historic ties with Asian countries, such as India or other nations from Southeast Asia.\n\nOther countries in Africa, namely Sudan and Tunisia, lie at the boundary of the Middle East and North Africa, with many of their cultural practices and backgrounds being heavily influenced by both regions. As such, they have been classified as “transition countries” due to their connection to two distinct areas.\n\nTourist Attractions in the Middle East\n\nThe Middle East is a region that has a lot to offer to tourists, with a wide variety of attractions that cater to different interests.
